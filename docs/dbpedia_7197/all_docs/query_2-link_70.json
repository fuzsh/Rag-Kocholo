        "text": "The Oscars has decided its winners for 2024 so there's no better time to catch up on all ten nominees for Best Picture.\n\nWhether you're looking to recreate the Barbenheimer experience, or see why Emma Stone and Lily Gladstone were fighting it out for Best Actress in a Leading Role for their performances in Poor Things and Killers of the Flower Moon, there's ways to do so. Some of the nominees are still in cinemas, while others are available to stream ‚Äî or will be soon.\n\nHere is everything you need to know about how to watch the Oscars winners at home.\n\nüçø Oscars 2024 recap\n\nOppenheimer wins big\n\nThe Oscars as they happened\n\nThe biggest Oscars moments from Ken to John Cena\n\nITV's Oscar show was a dud\n\nThe best Oscars red carpet moments\n\nAmerican Fiction | Prime Video\n\nSign up to Amazon Prime\n\nAmerican Fiction, Cord Jefferson's satire on the book and film industry has gained huge critical acclaim thanks to its sharp script and impressive performances by Jeffrey Wright and Sterling K Brown, both of whom were nominated for Oscars. Jefferson won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\nFor those hoping to watch the film ahead now, one way to do so is to go to a cinema near you or the movie is available to stream on Prime Video.\n\nAnatomy of a Fall | Buy & rent\n\nJustine Triet's Palme d'Or winning film Anatomy of a Fall quickly became one of the most talked about foreign films of the year. It follows a woman who is suspected of murdering her husband, and the moral dilemma it poses when their blind son is the only witness. It won Best Original Screenplay at the Oscars.\n\nThe film is still showing in cinemas, but it is also available to buy and rent on all good retailers, like Apple TV, the Sky Store, Prime Video and the BFI Player.\n\nBarbie | Sky Cinema and NOW\n\nSign up to Sky Go\n\nGreta Gerwig and Margot Robbie were the undisputed champions of the box office in 2023 thanks to their film Barbie, which surpassed ¬£1bn at the box office and has become a huge cultural milestone in cinema. The film follows Robbie's Barbie as she travelled to the real world in order to learn why strange things have been happening to her, and Ken (Ryan Gosling) is along for the ride. It won Best Original Song at the Oscars.\n\nFor those who didn't catch it in the cinema, or simply want to enjoy it again, they can do so by streaming the film on Sky Cinema and NOW in March.\n\nThe Holdovers | Buy & rent\n\nPaul Giamatti gave Cillian Murphy a run for his money in the Best Actor in a Leading Role race this year, and that is thanks to his performance in The Holdovers. Da'Vine Joy Randolph won in the Best Supporting Actress category.\n\nAlexander Payne's moving film portrays three unlikely characters finding comfort in each other's company over the Christmas holiday. The film is in cinemas now but is also available to buy and rent on services like Apple TV, the Sky Store, Prime Video and Google Play.\n\nThe Holdovers will also arrive on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray and DVD from 22 April.\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon | Apple TV+\n\nSign up to Apple TV\n\nMartin Scorsese's brutal epic Killers of the Flower Moon depicts the shocking true story of the Osage nation murders in the 1920s. It was a period when countless Native American people were killed after the community discovered oil on their land and became targets as a result. The film didn't win any Oscars in the end, despite 10 nominations.\n\nRead more: Killers of the Flower Moon: The shocking true story behind Leonardo DiCaprio's new film\n\nThe movie premiered on Apple TV+ in January, and is only available to stream on the platform. Those without a subscription can choose to buy and rent the film digitally, though.\n\nMaestro | Netflix\n\nBradley Cooper's biopic of composer Leonard Bernstein earned him a Best Actor nod as well as Best Film, his co-star Carey Mulligan also has a Best Actress nomination. It won zero Oscars from seven nominations.\n\nThe movie is a Netflix original and so after a stint in cinemas it was made available to stream on Netflix, where subscribers can now watch it.\n\nOppenheimer | Buy & rent\n\nChristopher Nolan's film depicting the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer and the creation of the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in World War II. It, like Barbie, was the film of 2023 and has been dominating the awards season ever since. It won seven Oscars, including Best Picture.\n\nThe film is currently only available to buy and rent from digital retailers like Sky, Apple TV and Prime Video, but Oppenheimer will be available to stream on NOW from 12 April.\n\nPast Lives | Netflix\n\nCeline Song's moving portrayal of love and fate dazzled viewers when it was first released in 2023, and it has rightly seen critical acclaim for the director and her two leads Greta Lee and Teo Yoo during awards season. At the Oscars the movie was nominated for Best Film and Best Original Screenplay, but won zero.\n\nFor those interested in catching Past Lives after the Oscars, it is available to stream on Netflix in the UK. Viewers can also buy or rent it digitally on other platforms, like the Sky Store, if they are not a Netflix subscriber.\n\nPoor Things | Disney+\n\nSign up to Disney+\n\nYorgos Lanthimos has once again triumphed in awards season with his latest film Poor Things, which has gained the most critical acclaim for Emma Stone's portrayal of Bella Baxter. The movie follows her character as she is brought back from the dead and rediscovers the joys of life, and she won her second Best Actress Oscar for the trouble.\n\nPoor Things is available to stream to Disney+ subscribers. The platform has even launched a new deal for a limited time for new and returning subscribers.\n\nThe Zone of Interest | In cinemas and digitally\n\nJonathan Glazer was the dark horse of the competition with his film The Zone of Interest, which depicts the life that SS Officer Rudolf H√∂ss and his wife Hedwig are trying to build for their family just outside of the Auschwitz concentration camp. Like Anatomy of a Fall, it is nominated for Best Film and Best International Feature Film at the Oscars. It won the latter and also Best Sound.\n\nRead more: Oscar-nominee Jonathan Glazer's huge impact on British culture before Zone of Interest\n\nThe film is currently in cinemas and it was made available to rent and buy digitally on realtors like the Sky Store, viewers with a Curzon cinema subscription can also rent the film from home if they wish."
