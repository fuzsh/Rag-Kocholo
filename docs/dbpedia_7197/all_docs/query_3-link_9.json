        "text": "Warner Leroy Baxter (March 29, 1889 – May 7, 1951) (The book Celebrities in Los Angeles Cemeteries: A Directory gives his date of birth as March 29, 1891:[1] American Classic Screen Profiles gives the date as March 29, 1892.)[2] was an American actor, known for his role as The Cisco Kid in In Old Arizona (1929), for which he won the second Academy Award for Best Actor in the 1928–1929 Academy Awards.[3] He frequently played womanizing, charismatic Latin bandit types in westerns, and played The Cisco Kid or a similar character throughout the 1930s, but had a range of other roles throughout his career. Warner Baxter started his movie career in silent film. Baxter's most notable silent films are The Great Gatsby (1926) and The Awful Truth (1925). When talkies came out, Baxter became even more famous. Baxter's most notable talkies are In Old Arizona (1929), 42nd Street (1932), Slave Ship (1937), Kidnapped (1938), and the 1931 20 minute all-star ensemble short film, The Stolen Jools. In the 1940s he was well known for his recurring role as Dr. Robert Ordway in the Crime Doctor series of 10 films.\n\nBaxter also has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame making him one of fewer than a hundred male actors in Hollywood history to receive both an Academy Award and a Walk of Fame star.\n\nBaxter originally worked as an insurance agent, sales manager and commercial traveller. Baxter began his movie career as an extra in 1914 in a stock company and quickly rose to become a star. He had his first starring role in 1921, in a film called Sheltered Daughters, before starring in 48 features during the 1920s. His most notable silent roles were in The Great Gatsby (1926), Aloma of the South Seas (1926) as an island love interest opposite the famous dancer Gilda Gray, and a handsome but alcoholic doctor in West of Zanzibar with Lon Chaney.\n\nBaxter's most famous starring role was as the Cisco Kid in In Old Arizona (1929), the first all-talking western, for which he won the second Academy Award for Best Actor. He also starred in 42nd Street (1933), Grand Canary (1934), Broadway Bill (1934) and Kidnapped (1938).\n\nBy 1936, Baxter was the highest paid actor in Hollywood, but by 1943 he had slipped to B movie roles, and he starred in a series of \"Crime Doctor\" films for Columbia Pictures. Baxter made over 100 films between 1914 and 1950.[4]"
