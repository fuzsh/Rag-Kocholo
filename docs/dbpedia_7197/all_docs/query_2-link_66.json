        "text": "Refresh\n\nIt's a few hours to the event, let's get stuck into what you need to know.\n\nThe red carpet has already kicked off as some of the stars have started arriving. Among the early arrivals are Jamie Lee Curtis (last year's best supporting actress winner), Past Lives star John Magaro, and the Godzilla Minus One team who are nominated for best visual effects. They've even found a great way to honor the monster too, just look at those shoes!\n\nWhile we get started, it’s a perfect time to take a look at the nominees. Leading the way is Oppenheimer, which has 13 nominations, closely followed by Poor Things at 11. There are also nods for The Holdovers, Past Lives, and Killers of the Flower Moon.\n\nIn the acting categories, it's looking very tight, but let's take a rundown of who's vying for what.\n\nIn the best actor category, Bradley Cooper is up for Maestro; Colman Domingo is up for Rustin; Paul Giamatti is up for The Holdovers; Cillian Murphy is up for Oppenheimer, and Jeffrey Wright is up for American Fiction.\n\nIn the best actress category, Annette Bening is nominated for Nyad; Lily Gladstone for Killers of the Flower Moon; Sandra Huller for Anatomy of a Fall; Carey Mulligan for Maestro, and Emma Stone for Poor Things.\n\nIn the best supporting actress category, the nominees are: Emily Blunt for Oppenheimer; Danielle Brooks for The Color Purple; America Ferrera for Barbie; Jodie Foster for Nyad, and Da’Vine Joy Randolph for The Holdovers.\n\nAnd finally, the best supporting actor category features: Sterling K Brown for American Fiction; Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon; Robert Downey Jr for Oppenheimer; Ryan Gosling for Barbie, and Mark Ruffalo for Poor Things.\n\nThen we've got the Best Director category, featuring Justine Triet for Anatomy of a Fall; Martin Scorsese for Killers of the Flower Moon; Christopher Nolan for Oppenheimer; Yorgos Lanthimos for Poor Things, and Jonathan Glazer for The Zone of Interest.\n\nBased on our Oscars 2024 predictions, we're thinking this one is Nolan's to lose at the moment...\n\nLet's take a look at some of the new arrivals on the red carpet. Nominees Sandra Hüller and Colman Domingo are here.\n\nIn our final look at the nominees, let's talk Best Picture. There are 10 amazing films hoping to win big. The list is as follows:\n\nAmerican Fiction\n\nAnatomy of a Fall\n\nBarbie\n\nThe Holdovers\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon\n\nMaestro\n\nOppenheimer\n\nPast Lives\n\nPoor Things\n\nThe Zone of Interest\n\nIt's definitely a hard category to call, but based on the awards season so far (including the at the 2024 BAFTAs), we're going to hedge our bets on Oppenheimer at this point.\n\nNow, let's chat how you can actually watch the show.\n\nThe ceremony will be broadcast on ABC for viewers in the US. Meanwhile, if you're in the UK, you'll be able to watch live on ITV.\n\nTimings wise, the ceremony will begin at 4pm PT/7pm ET/11pm GMT, which is an hour earlier than its usual time slot.\n\nFor more details, check out our 2024 Oscars watch guide.\n\nAnother nominee has arrived: Emma Stone, who is nominated for playing Bella Baxter in Poor Things. The film is nominated for 11 awards tonight, including Best Picture and Best Director.\n\nHave you managed to watch all of the nominees this year? Well, if you’re still hoping to add some to your watchlist, we’ve also compiled a list of where to stream every Oscar-nominated film.\n\nNot everyone who we expected would be nominated for this year's awards made the final cut...\n\nThe biggest snub was Barbie's Margot Robbie and Greta Gerwig. Neither were nominated for Best Actor or Best Director. The move caused quite the stir, with Ryan Gosling even sharing a statement on it. Read all about that here...\n\nMore nominees have arrived! Paul Giamatti and Danielle Brooks are here...\n\nI've been trawling the internet to find the best trivia about this year's Oscars. Here's some of my favorites:\n\nFilms are getting lengthy! The average runtime of the Best Picture nominees are 138 minutes.\n\nJohn Williams has earned his 54th nomination this year for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, making him the most Oscar nominated person of all time.\n\nThe Holdovers breaks a record as the first Christmas film nominated for Best Picture since Miracle on 34th Street.\n\nThere are four Oscar-nominated couples this year: Justine Triet and Arthur Harari; Christopher Nolan and Emma Thomas; Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, and Margot Robbie and Tom Ackerley.\n\nAnother big arrival! Anatomy of a Fall star Messi is already seated inside and ready for the ceremony. This is good news as there had been some reports that talented four-legged actor would not be allowed to attend. Pawesome news.\n\nBest director nominee Christopher Nolan has also arrived, ahead of the ceremony. He's looking like the one to beat at the moment, so this could be a big night for him and the rest of the Oppen-homies!\n\nAnother big arrival! Cillian Murphy is here. Could tonight mark his first Oscar win?\n\nThe final arrivals are making their way along the carpet. Including Lily Gladstone and Da'Vine Joy Randolph. Take a look below!\n\nWe're now just a couple of minutes out from the ceremony! Grab your popcorn and any last minute snacks and get ready for some tearful speeches and lots of glamour...\n\nAfter a slight delay, the 96th Academy Awards are underway! We begin with a montage of the nominees for this year's ceremony.\n\nHost Jimmy Kimmel is here and his monologue is predictably full of jokes, and no one is safe. Greta Gerwig gets a call out for her snub (as do the voters for not securing her nomination), a quip about Cillian Murphy's name, and a very on the nose Robert Downey Jr. joke.\n\nAnd, of course, there's a quip about the length of this year's nominees...\n\nAfter a lengthy opening monologue, the first award of the night is here: Best Supporting Actress!\n\nThe winner of the first actor is The Holdovers' Da'Vine Joy Randolph. She was up against Oppenheimer's Emily Blunt, The Color Purple's Danielle Brooks, Barbie's America Ferrera, and Nyad's Jodie Foster.\n\nNext up is Animated Short Film and Animated Feature, awarded by Furiosa's Chris Hemsworth and Anya Taylor-Joy.\n\nThe former goes to: War is Over! Inspired by the Music of John & Yoko\n\nThe latter goes to: The Boy and the Heron\n\nThe winners couldn't be there in person so Hemsworth and Joy accepted it on their behalf.\n\nDuring the break between awards, let's reflect on Da'Vine Joy Randolph's incredibly moving speech.\n\n\"God is so good,\" she said. \"I didn’t think I was supposed to be doing this as a career. I started off as a singer, and my mother said go across the street to that theatre department – there’s something for you there.\"\n\nNow it's time for the award for Best Original Screenplay. The winner is: Anatomy of a Fall by Justine Triet and Arthur Hariri.\n\nAccepting the award, Triet said she thinks it will help her \"through her midlife crisis\".\n\nKeeping with the screenplays, the next award is Best Adapted Screenplay. The Oscar goes to American Fiction.\n\nCord Jefferson picks up the award and in his speech he thanks the cast and crew of the film. \"I've been talking a lot about how many people passed on this movie,\" he shared, adding that he doesn't want to seem vindictive, but wants Hollywood to give more people a chance. \"Instead of making one $200 million dollar movie, try making 20 $10 million dollar movies.\"\n\nWe've got our first performance of the night. From Barbie, it's a beautiful stripped back version of 'What Was I Made For?' performed by Billie Eilish and Finneas O'Connell. Aside from a pink spotlight, the staging is low-key, and earlier on the red carpet Eilish says this was intentional. She wants the emotional song to \"speak for itself.\"\n\nMake-up and hairstyling is next. Presenting the award is dynamite duo of Catherine O'Hara and Michael Keaton.\n\nThe winner of this one is Poor Things!\n\nStraight onto the next award then, it's the Oscar for Production Design. Poor Things wins again! Shona Heath and James Price were there to accept the award.\n\nWell, this isn't a moment we thought was coming, but John Cena is here and he's naked. Yes, you read that right. As part of Jimmy's monologue, he recalled a streaking moment in the past, and Cena was recruited for the bit. \"The male body is not a joke,\" he said before giving out the award starkers.\n\nLook we have a picture for you, but you might want to avert your eyes. Don't say we didn't warn you...\n\nAmid all of that, the Oscar for the Best Costume Design was given out. That one went to Poor Things, which has been on a great run for the past few categories. Could this mean the tide is turning in their favor? We'll have to wait and see...\n\nWe've got a second performance of one of the nominees for Best Original Song. From Killers of the Flower Moon, it's 'Wahzhazhe (A Song for My People)'. It's performed by Osage songwriter Scott George and Osage singers. The performance had everyone on their feet with a standing ovation.\n\nNow it's time for International Feature Film. The Oscar goes to The Zone of Interest.\n\nJonathan Glazer accepted the award for this one, giving a poignant speech. \"Our film shows were dehumanization leads,\" he said.\n\nThis win also marks the first time that the UK has won in this category.\n\nWe have a real-life Barbenheimer here as Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt unite on stage. Their exchange is probably the funniest moment of the ceremony so far, complete with kensplaining, as they introduce a segment on stunt performers.\n\nIt's another big one! It's time for Best Supporting Actor. Once again, five Oscar-winners are there to introduce all of the nominees. Ke Huy Quan, Mahershala Ali, Tim Robbins, and Christoph Waltz. We also got a great Iron Man 2 reunion as Sam Rockwell introduced Robert Downey Jr.\n\nAnd the winner is Robert Downey Jr.! He wins his first Oscar for the role in a fantastic speech, thanking his wife and co-stars. \"I'd like to thank my terrible childhood and the academy in that order,\" he said before adding: \"What we do is meaningful, and the stuff that we decide to make is important.\"\n\nIt's time for a Twins reunion: Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito are here to present the next award. The pair bond over both trying (and failing) to kill Batman, before directing their ire to the Dark Knight himself as they fired off insults at stone-faced Michael Keaton.\n\nAnd the Oscar for Best Visual Effects goes to Godzilla: Minus One. Carrying an Oscar and a mini Godzilla, Takashi Yamazaki thanked everyone from those involved in the movie to Rocky Balboa in a moving speech.\n\nThe next Oscar goes to Oppenheimer, who wins for Film Editing. Jennifer Lane accepted the award, marking her first win.\n\nIt's time for another performance. From American Symphony, Jon Batiste performed 'It Never Went Away'. A stripped back and beautiful performance from the Oscar nominee.\n\nNow it's time for the Best Documentaries, presented by Barbie stars America Ferrera and Kate McKinnon.\n\nThe Last Repair Shop won the Oscar for Best Documentary Short.\n\n20 Days in Mariupol won the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature.\n\nThere's often a lot going on in the background of the Oscars – and this year is no different. However, we think this may be one of our all-time favorite Oscar moments. Just look at Messi the dog clapping.\n\nDune: Part Two star Zendaya announces the next award for Best Cinematography. And the Oscar goes to: Oppenheimer. Hoyte van Hoytema accepts the award, giving a moving speech where he championed celluloid.\n\nWe're zooming through the awards now. Best live-action short goes to Wes Anderson for The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar. This is Anderson's first ever Oscar.\n\nIt's time for a tally update. At the moment, Oppenheimer and Poor Things are tied with three wins each. American Fiction, Anatomy of a Fall, The Zone of Interest, and The Holdovers all have one. There's not been any big surprises yet, either.\n\nCan you feel the Kenergy? It's time for Ryan Gosling's performance of 'I'm Just Ken'.\n\nFalse alarm! We've got the announcement for Best Sound now. The Oscar goes to The Zone of Interest. Accepting the award are Johnnie Burn and Tarn Willers.\n\nRyan Gosling's performance of 'I'm Just Ken' was something to behold. Wearing a pink sparkly suit, a cowboy hat, and sunglasses, he took to the stage with Ken dancers, much to the amusement of Margot Robbie. If that wasn't enough, we got Ken cameos, singalongs from Greta Gerwig and Emma Stone, and a guitar solo from Slash.\n\nThat was Ken out of Ken in my mind, can anything beat it?\n\nIt's Best Original Song is coming up soon, and Gosling will be hoping to win. Before that though, Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo are here to announce the Oscar for Best Original Score.\n\nThe Oscar goes to Oppenheimer! Ludwig Göransson accepts the award.\n\nNow it's Best Original Song, which goes to Billie Eilish and Finneas O'Connell. This is the pair's second Oscar after winning previously for No Time to Die. \"I had a nightmare about this last night,\" Eilish begins, before admitting that she was really not expecting to win. \"I'm grateful for this song and the movie and how it made me feel.\"\n\nWell, now it's time for the big four: Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and Best Picture. Will it be a Oppenheimer sweep? We'll soon find that out...\n\nBefore we get into those, it's time for the In Memoriam section. Among those honored this yeah are Michael Gambon, Andre Braugher, Jane Birkin, and Matthew Perry. Accompanying the section was a beautiful performance of 'Time to Say Goodbye' by Andrea Bocelli.\n\nNow it's best director time! And the winner is Christopher Nolan. Winning for Oppenheimer, this is Nolan's first Oscar. To celebrate the moment, he thanked his cast and crew, as well as emotionally thanking his wife and producing partner. \"We don't know where this incredible journey is going from here, but to know that you think I'm a meaningful part of it means the world to me,\" he said of film history.\n\nNow, it's time for Best Actress. This was one of the most contested categories but the winner is: Emma Stone for Poor Things. This is her second Oscar after winning for La La Land.\n\n\"This is really overwhelming,\" the visibly emotional actor said as she accepted her award (and dealt with a minor wardrobe mishap).\n\nIt's time for the final award! Best Picture is being announced by legend Al Pacino!\n\nIt's Oppenheimer! The film has won seven Oscars, completing it's sweep with the Best Picture award. Christopher Nolan and his cast went up on stage to announce the award.\n\nEmma Thomas says that she's been \"dreaming\" about this moment for so long. \"The reason this movie was the movie it was was Chris Nolan,\" she added. \"The thing that's fantastic about this job is that it's about collaboration.\"\n\nThe big winner of the night was Oppenheimer, taking home seven awards.\n\nPoor Things won four Oscars, while The Zone of Interest won two. American Fiction, Anatomy of a Fall, Barbie, and The Holdovers all won one.\n\nRead our full list of winners right here.\n\nOppenheimer's win marks the return of the blockbuster winner at the Oscars. It's the highest-grossing Best Picture winner since The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King back in 2003.\n\nHowever, Oppenheimer is far from your typical big screen biopic. Speaking to Total Film for our in-depth cover feature, we spoke to Christopher Nolan and his team about bringing it to theaters.\n\nYou can have a read of that huge cover feature right here, to get some exclusive insight into how the film was made.\n\nNot only that, but Oppenheimer actually won our best film of 2023 too. For why it landed the top spot, here's our feature on exactly what makes it so memorable.\n\nWell that's it! As the stars get ready to party into the night, our watch has ended.\n\nThe 2024 Oscars may not have had many surprises, but with Ken-ergetic performances and some show-stopping speeches, it was a great celebration of the year in film that's been."
