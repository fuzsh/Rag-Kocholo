        "text": "Who would have thought that an overture from the French opera “Guillaume Tell” written in 1829 by Gioachino Rossini, would become more famous as the theme song for a TV western…? However, which of you cannot remember the sound of the “William Tell Overture” as The Lone Ranger and Tonto rode onto the scene, while the announcer excitedly exclaimed,” A fiery horse with the speed of light, a cloud of dust and a hearty Hi-Ho Silver! The Lone Ranger!” Just the sound of the song and the excitement in the announcer’s voice made you sit on the edge of your seat, waiting for the episode to begin. It started out as a radio show in 1933 and transferred to TV from 1949 to 1957…That’s a lot of “Hi-Ho’s”\n\nTV was in black and white back then but the old westerns were always thrilling and exciting to watch. I know, I know, most of the acting definitely wasn’t Oscar Grade and the filming angles were pretty standard, also the plots were usually thin with the same scenario played out over and over again.\n\nBUT WE DIDN’T CARE…!\n\nThese were our hero’s and good guys\n\nAnd\n\nThey would ALWAYS win in the end!\n\nWe had a TV program that came on every afternoon after school (I think it came on just after the Micky Mouse Club) It was called “The Six Gun Playhouse” It featured most all of the old western cowboy shows, including vintage movie cowboys. Like, Tom Mix, I don’t think anyone had a taller 10 Gallon Hat until Hoss Cartwright on “Bonanza” Tom was the ultimate cowboy and in the 1920’s he made over 160 cowboy films. He was dubbed as the first “King of the Cowboys” My sister and my buddy Jimmy were avid watchers of all these legends.\n\nI guess the earliest one I can find and vaguely remember was the silent film cowboy, William S. Hart. He started his acting career in 1949 and actually knew the real Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson. He has a Star on the “Hollywood Walk of Fame” He is remembered as a foremost western star of the silent era who \"imbued all of his characters with honor and integrity.\"\n\nI suppose my favorite big screen movie cowboy will always be John Wayne. (Marion Robert Morrison) He played in so many of the early “B” movies that you can hardly count them. To me he always stood tall, walked proud, rode hard & hit hard…My Hero…! Here he is in “The Angle and The Badman” along with Gail Russell.\n\nHis fame will never be forgotten. One of his last Great Characters was as the U.S. Marshall, Reuben J. “Rooster” Cogburn, In the movie “True Grit” Who could forget the famous scene where he puts the reins in his teeth and with a six gun in one hand and a rifle in the other…rides head on at the bad guys, shootn and yellin! WOW, that was Great Stuff…!\n\nI loved watching all the older western stars, some of my other favorites cowboys were Hopalong Cassidy, played by William Boyd. He wore this really neat black outfit with two six shooters strapped on his waist. along with his horse “Topper” and his sidekick George “Gabby” Hays. They would save the damsels farm from the evil land baron and make peace between the cattlemen and the sheep herders.\n\nGabby Hays also rode as a sidekick with Roy Rogers and Gene Autry in numerous films.\n\nThen there was Bob Steel, He always had a glare in his eyes that was unmistakable. Born Robert A. Bradbury. In the 20’s, 30’s and 40’s he played in numerous “B-Westerns” and was a hit on TV reruns.\n\nHow about The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok with Guy Madison and Andy Devine as Jingles his side kick. Andy would always be riding behind and hollering in his scracthy voice “Hey Wild Bill…Wait for Me…!”\n\nYou can’t count out Red Ryder and Little Beaver. Several stars played Red Ryder, Don 'Red' Barry, Bill Elliot and Allen Lane Daisy got on the band wagon and merchandised/licensed the famous Red Ryder BB Gun. I bet you probably had one…I know I did. (do you know who the kid is on the right? It's Robert Blake...!)\n\nYa just can’t get a more cowboy sounding name that Buck Jones His real name was, Charles Fredrick Gebhart…Not so cowboy’ish and thus the new name. He was another “B” movie favorite in the western heyday. He started as a back up to Tom Mix and went on to star in his own movies.\n\nThen came\n\nThe Singing Cowboys…!\n\nAh, Yes…! You couldn’t just shoot straight, ride good and save the day…NO…You had to Sing too…! Thus, two famous cowboys come to mind…Guess Who…?\n\nYep…You are So Right…!\n\nGene Autry and Roy Rogers along with Dale Evans\n\nThe sang their way into the hearts of every Red Blooded American. They became the Western Cowboy Icons of the day.\n\nBorn Orvon Grover \"Gene\" Autry, he was more than a Cowboy Star, he was an American singer-songwriter, actor, musician, rodeo performer and business tycoon (for all you baseball fans, you know he owned the Los Angeles - Angels from 1961 to 1997.) Gene stared in 93 films, then he along with his horse “Champion” and had the “The Gene Autry Show” on TV, which ran from 1950 to 1956.\n\nI suppose that Roy Rogers will always be synonymous as one of the Western Heroes of all times. I’ll just bet you can still sing along to the song “Happy Trails” As the camera would pan up over the entrance to the Double ‘R’ Ranch. Once again you knew you were in for a Rootin-Shootin Time, as Roy & Trigger, Dale & Buttermilk, Pat Brady plus his Jeep ‘Nellybelle’ and Bullet the Wonder Dog, would, once again Save the Day…! This show ran for six seasons from 1951 to 1957. (100 episodes)\n\nDid you ever notice several things in these old westerns…Things like?\n\n1. Their Six Shooters had 20 plus bullets in them.\n\n2. Their hats NEVER came off in a fight.\n\n3. The hero could knock the bad guy out with ONE punch.\n\n4. There was always a hill, when they tackled the bad guy off their galloping horse.\n\nBut, you probably knew these things already…!\n\nOne of my all time favorite ones for a FUN time was “The Cisco Kid” which incidentally started out as a silent film in 1914. Numerous films were made with different actors playing Cisco. Warner Baxter, Cesar Romero, and Gilbert Roland. I believe that everyone’s favorite will always be, Duncan Renaldo as the Cisco Kid. Along with his horse Diablo, his faithful compadre Poncho, played by Leo Carrillo with his horse Loco. From 1950 to 1956 they made 156 episodes and they were the first ones to start making TV episodes in color. After saving the farm and retrieving the stolen money…I know you remember their famous parting lines just before they rode off in a cloud of dust. They would make some really bad joke and laughingly say to one another, “O-Poncho\" – \"O-Cisco”\n\nWagon Train with Ward Bond and Rawhide with Clint Eastwood had special memories and stars that lit up our TV screens at night.\n\nThe classic and long running hour “Gunsmoke” starring James Arness as Marshall Matt Dillon blasted its way from radio onto the TV screen from 1955 to 1975 with an unbelievable 20 seasons and 635 episodes…Wow…! This paved the way for a barrage of TV westerns: Bonanza, The Big Valley, High Chaparral, Have Gun Will Travel, Wanted Dead or Alive, The Rebel, Sugarfoot, Cheyenne, Maverick along with several others that came on the TV scene.\n\nI wanted to have Paladins gun and holster Sooooooo Bad…! Even as a kid I made my own ‘First Ever’ Business Cards, just like his and handed them out when I played cowboys with my friends. Too much fun…!\n\nOne of my favorite 'Adventure' western heroes was “ZORRO”. I have always been a fan of the swashbuckling Black Caped hero since I saw Tyrone Powers in “The Mark of Zorro” man o man, I was hooked. He had one of the forever classic sword fights with non other than (Sherlock Holmes) Basil Rathbone who played the villain. The first one to play the infamous character was Douglas Fairbanks Jr. in the 1920 Silent Film version with the same title.\n\nThen of course there was the TV series with Guy Williams as Zorro. I watched this one every time and all the time...!\n\nWell Pardoner, I Gotta pull back on the Reins and say “Whoa…!” I know I have left some of your favorites out but I could go on for a long long time about these guys. I love all of these wonderful heroes. As kids we pretended to be every one of them. Armed with our cap pistols and cowboy hats, we ran around the neighborhood playing Cowboys and Bad guys forever. These western heroes will never die as long as the legend of the old west is kept alive. They are running most of these old western series again on special TV channels and I believe that the ratings are quite high.\n\nSo, I hope you buckled up your holster and put your spurs on\n\nAs you traveled back to those\n\nRootin-Tootin-Shootin Times\n\nWhen the Good Guys ALWAYS Won\n\nHave a Blessed Day"
