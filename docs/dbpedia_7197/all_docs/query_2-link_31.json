        "text": "Netflix shares Wes Anderson's response to win\n\nNetflix released a statement on X sharing director Wes Anderson's reaction to winning his first Oscar.\n\n“If I could have been there, I (along with Steven Rales) would have said “Thank you” to: the family of Roald Dahl, the team at Netflix, Benedict and Ralph and Ben Kingsley and Dev and Richard and Bob and Adam and Jeremy and John and Jim and Rich and Jim and Polly and more,\" Anderson said in the statement. \"And also I would have said: if i had not met Owen Wilson in a corridor at the University of Texas between classes when I was 18 years old, I would certainly not be receiving this award tonight\n\nHe said that he and Rales were unable to be at the Oscars because they're currently in Germany, where they will start shooting their new movie on Monday.\n\nSpeaking to the press room backstage following his win, director Nolan described making \"Oppenheimer\" as the \"greatest thrill.\"\n\n\"The film ends on what I consider a dramatically necessary moment of despair,\" Nolan told reporters, before adding it's important viewers of the film \"don't despair\" themselves.\n\nHe cited generally lower nuclear proliferation rates following the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which was signed by several of the major nuclear powers that pledged to stem the spread of nuclear technology.\n\n\"In the last few years, it's gone the wrong way,\" Nolan continued. \"And it's very important that rather than despair, in reality, people are looking at advocacy, the supporting organizations are working to pressure politicians and leaders to reduce the number of nuclear weapons in our world.\"\n\nWatch Da’Vine Joy Randolph accept the best supporting actress award role for “The Holdovers.\"\n\nActor Eva Mendes, who is married to Ryan Gosling, posted a photo of herself rocking a pink jacket to commemorate her Ken's epic Oscars performance.\n\n\"You took Ken all the way to the Oscar’s, RG,\" she wrote in her Instagram post. \"Now come home, we need to put the kids to bed\"\n\nA final tally\n\nHere's a look at home the films fared tonight:\n\n—\"Oppenheimer\": 7\n\n—\"Poor Things\": 4\n\n—\"Zone of Interest\": 2\n\n—\"American Fiction\": 1\n\n—\"Barbie\": 1\n\n—\"Anatomy of a Fall\": 1\n\n—\"The Holdovers\": 1\n\nAnd the movies that went home empty-handed:\n\n—\"Killers of the Flower Moon\": 0\n\n—\"Past Lives\": 0\n\n—\"Maestro\": 0\n\nOne Oscar tradition remains: The show ran late.\n\nThe show, which started at 7 p.m. ET (an hour earlier than usual), was supposed to be three hours long and end at 10 p.m. ET. Instead, it wrapped up around 10:30 p.m. ET.\n\nRunnig late, after we lost an hour of sleep? Time to catch some ZZZ's.\n\nAnother Scorsese movie goes 0 for 10\n\n\"Killers of the Flower Moon\" is the third Martin Scorsese film to receive 10 nominations but win nothing at the ceremony.\n\nIt follows \"Gangs of New York\" in 2003 and \"The Irishman\" in 2020.\n\nThe fact that he was actually won a best director Oscar for a best picture winner (\"The Departed\") probably makes it easier to swallow for the legendary filmmaker, but it's clear the academy is mostly just happy to nominate his movies when he works in the historical epic vein. (To be fair, \"The Aviator\" and \"Hugo\" both won multiple awards.)\n\n'Oppenheimer' producer Emma Thomas accepts best picture prize\n\nThomas, who co-produced \"Oppenheimer,\" gave the last big speech of the night in accepting the award for best picture.\n\nShe paid tribute to the cast, the crew, IMAX chief executive Richard Gelfond and her husband, \"Oppenheimer\" director Christopher Nolan.\n\n\"The reason this movie is the movie it was was Chris Nolan,\" she said. \"He’s singular, he’s brilliant ... and I’m so grateful for you.\"\n\nJimmy Kimmel jokes about the Oscars best picture envelope\n\nThe host referred to his previous 2017 hosting gig with the infamous \"Moonlight\" and \"La La Land\" best picture envelope mix-up after Emma Stone accepted a surprising best actress win.\n\nKimmel 'thanks' Trump for harsh Truth Social post\n\n\"Has there EVER been a WORSE HOST than Jimmy Kimmel at The Oscars,\" former President Trump posted on Truth Social.\n\nKimmel, in turn, read it aloud during the show. “Isn't it past your jail time?\" Kimmel joked.\n\n'Oppenheimer' matches 'Schindler’s List' 30 years later\n\nWith seven wins, Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” matches the “Schindler’s List” total from 30 years ago.\n\nWhy is that significant? Both are Universal releases, both are about World War II and both are about horrifying subjects that still shape the world (antisemitism and the threat of nuclear war) nearly eight decades later.\n\nNolan's best director win also mirrors “Schindler” helmer Steven Spielberg’s victory three decades ago. At the time, Spielberg was very much like Nolan: a blockbuster director with several critically acclaimed films who had yet to find Oscar glory. Spielberg, fittingly, presented this year’s best director trophy to Nolan.\n\nDisclosure: Universal is owned by the same company as NBC News.\n\nand\n\nIn accepting her award, Stone took to the stage saying she was panicking before thanking her fellow nominees.\n\n\"I don't know what I'm saying. I'm totally — OK,\" Stone said as she tried to calm her nerves.\n\n\"The other night I was panicking that something like this could happen and Yorgos said, 'Take yourself out of it,'\" Stone said of director Yorgos Lanthimos.\n\nStone talked about how Lanthimos reenforced the collaborative process of moviemaking. She thanked him for giving her the role of Bella Baxter.\n\nAs she left the stage, she urged the crowd not to look at the back of her dress, which had ripped. She joked that the dress rip may have occurred during the \"I'm Just Ken\" performance.\n\nBest picture winner\n\n“Oppenheimer” wins the best picture Oscar.\n\nBest actress winner\n\nEmma Stone wins the best actress Oscar for “Poor Things.”\n\nIn his best director acceptance speech, Nolan thanked his cast and collaborators, reserving particular praise for his wife, Emma Thomas — \"the producer of all our films and all our children. I love you.\"\n\nNolan and Thomas have collaborated on all of the films he has directed, including the blockbuster Dark Knight trilogy and the mind-bending action epic \"Inception.\"\n\nNolan's win cements his status as one of the foremost directors in contemporary Hollywood. He was previously nominated in the best director category for the World War II thriller \"Dunkirk,\" released in 2017.\n\nBest director winner\n\nChristopher Nolan wins the best director Oscar for “Oppenheimer.”\n\nMurphy, a first-time nominee and winner, dedicated his best actor Oscar to \"peacemakers everywhere.\"\n\nHe alluded to the fact that we are \"living in Oppenheimer's world,\" defined in part by the risk of nuclear annihilation and weapons of mass destruction.\n\nBest actor winner\n\nCillian Murphy wins the best actor Oscar for “Oppenheimer.”\n\nNicolas Cage (\"Leaving Las Vegas\"), Matthew McConaughey (\"Dallas Buyers Club\"), Brendan Fraser (\"The Whale\"), Ben Kingsley (\"Gandhi\") and Forest Whitaker (\"The Last King of Scotland\") are paying tribute to this year's crop of nominees.\n\nFour categories left\n\nThere are four categories left.\n\nWhich, as Kimmel noted, \"shouldn’t take long, and yet it will.”\n\nThere are so many running late jokes that I've lost count. We know.\n\nAlexei Navalny opens the in memoriam at Oscars\n\nA clip of Alexei Navalny in the 2022 documentary \"Navalny\" opened up the in memoriam tribute segment. Navalny died earlier this year while in custody in a Russian prison.\n\nThe tribute portion also featured a live performance by Andrea Bocelli with his son Matteo Bocelli.\n\nBillie Eilish is now the youngest two-time Oscar winner in history at 22 years old.\n\nAccepting the award, she giggled saying that she had a nightmare the night before the ceremony and that she never expected to win — before thanking the academy.\n\n\"I feel so incredibly lucky and honored,\" Eilish said before thanking \"Barbie\" director Greta Gerwig.\n\n\"I'm thankful for this song and this movie and for the way it made me feel.\"\n\nShe and brother Finneas O’Connell, who also won for their James Bond theme, “No Time to Die,” in 2021, also thanked \"Barbie\" star Margot Robbie, as well as their parents.\n\nThis is the first win of the night for \"Barbie,\" which was nominated for eight awards.\n\nElphaba and Glinda are here in green and pink\n\nCynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, who co-star in the upcoming \"Wicked\" movie adaptation, presented the award for best score. We will all be changed \"For Good\" when that movie finally comes out later this year.\n\nLudwig Göransson worked with his wife, a violinist, on best score\n\nGöransson, on his second win after \"Black Panther\" for \"Oppenheimer,\" thanked director Christopher Nolan for choosing to highlight the violin in the score. That allowed him to work with his wife, Serena McKinney, a violinist.\n\nBig night for people who listen to the \"Oppenheimer\" score at their desk every day, e.g., me.\n\nBest original song winner\n\n“What Was I Made For?” from “Barbie” wins the best original song Oscar. The music and lyrics are by Billie Eilish and Finneas O’Connell.\n\nTarn Willers and Johnnie Burn wished everyone a happy mother's day in their Oscars speech.\n\nThe pair also thanked the academy for \"recognizing the art of sound and film such an extraordinary year for sound and film.\"\n\n\"My mother wouldn’t have understood this,\" Burn said. \"She always said, 'What do you mean you do the sound and film? They sound right to me?'\n\nBest original score winner\n\nLudwig Göransson wins the best original score Oscar for “Oppenheimer.”\n\nThe Oscars felt the Kenergy\n\nRyan Gosling, in a sparkly pink suit and sunglasses, began his Ken serenade in the audience of the Dolby Theatre before making his way onto the stage to join other Kens dressed in black and sporting cowboy hats.\n\nSpotted in the sea of Kens who joined Gosling: \"Barbie\" co-star Simu Liu. The Kens were joined by Slash and Wolfgang van Halen, Eddie van Halen and Valerie Bertinelli’s son.\n\nGosling returned to the crowd to say hi to several Barbies, including his old \"La La Land\" co-star and Oscar nominee, Emma Stone.\n\nThe performance ended with a standing ovation. But for a movie that is going to end the night with maybe one Oscar, \"Barbie\" seems to be the most popular in the room ... just saying.\n\nBest sound winner\n\n“The Zone of Interest” wins the best sound Oscar.\n\nZendaya, the queen of young Hollywood, is so powerful she didn't need a presenting partner to announce the best cinematography award.\n\n'Oppenheimer' builds momentum\n\nAfter falling behind \"Poor Things,\" \"Oppenheimer\" pulled even for the lead in tonight's total tally. The epic biopic now has three Oscars, winning for best supporting actor, best editing and best cinematography. These wins bode well for its chances to win best picture.\n\nIn accepting his speech for \"Oppenheimer\" best cinematography, Hoyte Van Hoytema cracked a joke that aspiring filmmakers should use the new, trendy celluloid — a medium that has been popular since the 1950s.\n\nBest live action short film winner\n\nWes Anderson’s “The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar” wins the best live action short film Oscar.\n\nMstyslav Chernov accepts award for ‘20 Days in Mariupol’\n\nIn a rousing acceptance speech, “20 Days in Mariupol” director Mstyslav Chernov condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine, saying he would trade all of the film's success if it meant a different outcome.\n\n“This is the first Oscar in Ukrainian history, and I’m honored,\" he said. “But probably I will be the first director on this stage to say I wish I never made this film.\"\n\n“20 Days in Mariupol\" follows a team of Ukrainian journalists reporting in a city besieged by Russia.\n\n“I wish to be able to exchange this for Russia never attacking Ukraine, never occupying our cities,\" he said.\n\nBest cinematography winner\n\nHoyte van Hoytema wins the best cinematography Oscar for “Oppenheimer.”\n\n\"The Last Repair Shop\" director Kris Bowers, whose film looks into those who help revive broken musical instruments for students in the Los Angeles Unified School District, thanked the \"heroes in our schools, who often go unsung, unbanked and unseen.\"\n\nBowers, who brought 12-year-old violinist Porché Brinker on stage, emphasized the importance of music education.\n\n\"L.A. is one of the last cities in America to give public school students free instruments,\" Bowers said. \"We need to fix that because music education isn’t about creating incredible musicians. It’s about creating incredible humans.\"\n\nBest documentary feature film winner\n\n“20 Days in Mariupol” wins the best documentary feature film Oscar.\n\nBest documentary short film winner\n\n“The Last Repair Shop” wins the best documentary short film Oscar.\n\nLame thanked \"Oppenheimer\" producer Emma Thomas and director Christopher Nolan, who are married, in her acceptance speech for best film editing.\n\n\"I was terrified when I first got hired to work for you,\" she said, addressing Nolan. \"It felt like you took a huge risk on me, and you never made me feel that way,\"\n\nShe also described Thomas as a \"bad-ass producer,\" saying she's in \"awe\" of her.\n\n'American Symphony' snub\n\nJon Batiste performed a moving rendition of his nominated song \"It Never Went Away\" from the documentary about him and his wife, Suleika Jaouad, \"American Symphony.\" Notably, the film was not nominated in the best documentary category.\n\n'Twins' stars Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito reunite on Oscars stage\n\nSchwarzenegger, the former California governor, and DeVito graced the stage to present several categories. In between announcing the winners, the two reminisced about their roles in different \"Batman\" movies.\n\n“Arnold and I are both presenting for an obvious reason: We both tried to kill Batman,” DeVito joked. \"How did Batman beat you?\n\n“He used my one weakness against me,” Schwarzenegger replied.\n\n“Heat?” DeVito asked.\n\n“Love,” Schwarzenegger said.\n\nThe team behind \"Godzilla Minus One's\" visual effects brought Godzilla figurines on stage with them to accept the award.\n\nFilmmaker Takashi Yamazaki said in his acceptance speech that getting on the stage \"felt out of reach.\"\n\nHe added that \"everyone has a chance\" to make it on the Oscars stage.\n\nBest film editing\n\nJennifer Lame wins the best film editing Oscar for “Oppenheimer.”\n\nBest visual effects winner\n\n“Godzilla Minus One” wins the best visual effects Oscar.\n\nand\n\nPublicists are having a major night. Da'Vine Joy Randolph and Robert Downey Jr. have both thanked their publicists, among other winners tonight.\n\nThe publicist nods join a 2024 awards season trend of thanking under-recognized staff members.\n\nAyo Edebiri started the trend by thanking assistants at the Golden Globes, while Downey thanked his stylists at the Oscars.\n\nWe need a Messi cam\n\nMessi, the border collie star of \"Anatomy of a Fall,\" was shown clapping from his seat for Robert Downey Jr.'s best supporting actor speech. More Messi please!\n\nRobert Downey Jr., accepting supporting actor Oscar, jokingly thanks his 'terrible childhood'\n\nIn his acceptance speech, \"Oppenheimer\" star Downey thanked his \"terrible childhood and the academy — in that order.\" He also paid tribute to his wife, Susan Downey.\n\nThis is his first Oscar win. He was previously nominated for his lead role in \"Chaplin\" and his supporting performance in \"Tropic Thunder.\"\n\nBest supporting actor winner\n\nRobert Downey Jr. wins the best supporting actor Oscar for “Oppenheimer.”\n\nFive previous supporting actor winners are now on the stage.\n\nSam Rockwell (\"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\"), Ke Huy Quan (\"Everything Everywhere All at Once\"), Tim Robbins (\"Mystic River\"), Mahershala Ali (\"Moonlight,\" \"Green Book\") and Christoph Waltz (\"Inglourious Basterds\") are on hand to present the Oscar to the next member of their club.\n\n'The Zone of Interest' director Jonathan Glazer deplores 'dehumanization' in Israel-Hamas war\n\nGlazer, accepting the best international feature Oscar for \"The Zone of Interest,\" decried the \"dehumanization\" of the Israel-Hamas war, referring explicitly to the victims of the Oct. 7 terror attack in Israel and the victims of Israel's military operations in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe director said \"The Zone of Interest,\" a challenging drama that follows a Nazi commandant who lives with his family right outside the walls of the Auschwitz death camp, was designed to \"reflect and confront us in the present.\"\n\nGlazer's speech the most politically charged moment of the night so far and one of the most direct engagements with the Middle East crisis during any recent Hollywood awards show.\n\nRyan Gosling and Emily Blunt bring 'Barbenheimer' to stage\n\nThe first \"Barbenheimer\" mention of the night came when Emily Blunt and Ryan Gosling came together to honor the stunt performing community.\n\nDuring their time on stage, Gosling told Blunt he knew why the phenomenon was called \"Barbenheimer\" and not \"Oppenbarbie.\"\n\nIt's because \"you were riding Barbie's coat tails all summer,\" he joked.\n\nBlunt quipped: \"Thanks for Ken-splaining that for me.\"\n\nGosling then tried to rip the microphone away when Blunt suggested his abs were painted on.\n\nBest international feature film winner\n\nThe United Kingdom’s “The Zone of Interest” wins the best international feature film Oscar.\n\nIncredible moment: 'Killers of the Flower Moon' song performed by Osage people\n\nThe second Oscar-nominated original song to be performed live tonight was \"Wahzhazhe (A Song for My People),\" from Martin Scorsese's \"Killers of the Flower Moon.\"\n\nThe group of Osage performers onstage drew a standing ovation from the audience in the theater.\n\nScorsese's film, an adaptation of a nonfiction book by journalist David Grann, chronicles the serial murders of Osage people in 1920s Oklahoma.\n\n'Poor Things' leads early with three wins\n\nThe second-most-nominated movie of the year has the most wins so far in the ceremony. Eleven-time nominee \"Poor Things\" has won for makeup and hairstyling, production design and costumes. \"Oppenheimer,\" the leader with 13 nominations, hasn't won anything ... yet.\n\nJohn Cena shows up for the biggest laugh of the night\n\nKimmel alluded to an infamous incident at the 1974 Oscars when a streaker ran across the stage, then asked how people would react if that happened today.\n\nThat's when John Cena showed up behind him, seemingly nude, and said: \"I changed my mind! I don't want to do the streaker bit.\"\n\nCena then walked over to the microphone to present the Oscar for best costume design — with a giant envelope covering his private parts.\n\nBest costume design winner\n\n“Poor Things” wins the best costume design Oscar.\n\nThe glam is very important when it comes to lights, camera, action!\n\nThis year's Oscar for best hair and makeup went to Nadia Stacey, Mark Coulier and Josh Weston from \"Poor Things,\" who all thanked their families in their acceptance speeches.\n\nThe first-time Oscar winners for production and set design showed up hungry to accept their awards.\n\nJames Price from \"Poor Things\" gave a nod to the dessert Emma Stone's Bella Baxter stuffs her face with, while Shona Heath and Zsuzsa Mihalek were also recognized.\n\nWhat's with the tux bats?\n\nThe style for men this year certainly appears to be the large-drop butterfly bow tie — many men are wearing the long descending bows. Whether you call them tux bibs or tux bats, it's an interesting older-fashioned trend in a year characterized by sparkle-wear.\n\nBest production design winner\n\n“Poor Things” wins the best production design Oscar.\n\nBest makeup and hairstyling winner\n\n“Poor Things” wins the best makeup and hairstyling Oscar.\n\nDespite starting an hour early, this year's Oscars ceremony still ended up being behind schedule. It doesn't feel any different — and we still have a long ways to go!\n\nBillie Eilish and Finneas O’Connell perform 'What Was I Made For?'\n\nWith her ethereal, breathy vocals and the stage cast in pink, Billie Eilish performed a haunting version of \"What Was I Made For?\" from \"Barbie,\" which is nominated for best original song.\n\nThe song began as a stripped-down ballad with Finneas O’Connell on the piano before revealing an orchestra accompanying the brother-sister duo.\n\nJefferson, accepting the best adapted screenplay Oscar for writing \"American Fiction\" (which he also directed), pleaded with the entertainment industry to make more small-scale movies.\n\nHe also implored Hollywood to take more chances on first-time or unproven talent, saying the next Martin Scorsese or Greta Gerwig could be out there.\n\nFor those keeping track, \"Oppenheimer\" will need to win its next 11 nominations to tie the record for most wins by a movie, held by \"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,\" \"Titanic\" and \"Ben-Hur.\"\n\nBest adapted screenplay winner\n\nCord Jefferson wins the best adapted screenplay Oscar for “American Fiction.” The script is based on the novel “Erasure” by Percival Everett.\n\nJustine Triet, accepting the Oscar for best original screenplay, joked that her victory will help her through her mid-life crisis.\n\nTriet co-wrote the script for the cerebral French legal thriller with her husband, Arthur Harari.\n\nTriet and Harari walked to the main stage to the tune of 50 Cent's \"P.I.M.P.\" In the film, a steel drum cover of \"P.I.M.P.\" plays a pivotal role.\n\nBest original screenplay winner\n\nJustine Triet and Arthur Harari win the best original screenplay Oscar for “Anatomy of a Fall.”\n\nWhat's going on with some of these jokes?\n\nYour trusty livebloggers are groaning over some of Jimmy Kimmel's one-liners, especially that crack about \"The Boy and the Heron.\"\n\nBest animated feature winner\n\n“The Boy and the Heron” wins the best animated feature Oscar.\n\nBest animated short film winner\n\n“War Is Over! Inspired by the Music of John and Yoko” wins the best animated short film Oscar.\n\nIn her acceptance speech for best supporting actress, Randolph thanked her mother for encouraging her to try acting.\n\n\"I started off as a singer, and my mother said to me, go across that street to the theater department,\" Randolph said. \"There's something for you there.\"\n\n\"For so long, I have always wanted to be different, and now I realize I just need to be myself,\" she said.\n\nWe're not crying, you are.\n\nRita Moreno is back on the Oscars stage\n\nOne Latina icon introduces another!\n\nWhile introducing the best supporting actress nominees, Moreno honors America Ferrera’s “tour de force” performance as Gloria in \"Barbie.\" Moreno playfully sang Ferrera’s name in a nod to her Oscar-winning role in “West Side Story” and her iconic performance of “America.”\n\nKimmel wasn't met with many laughs after his jokes about the best picture-nominated film \"Killers of the Flower Moon.\"\n\nIn his opening monologue, Kimmel decided to roast the length of the film, a Martin Scorsese-directed crime-drama about the serial murders of members of Osage Nation known as the Reign of Terror.\n\n\"When I went to see 'Killers of the Flower Moon,' I had my mail forwarded to the theater. 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is so long, in the time it takes you to watch you could drive to Oklahoma and solve the murder of yourself.\n\nWith the scarce laughter in the room, it was clear that audience members were less than thrilled.\n\nBest supporting actress winner\n\nDa’Vine Joy Randolph wins the best supporting actress Oscar for “The Holdovers.”\n\nPrevious winners are on hand to introduce acting nominees\n\nFive previous winners of the best supporting actress Oscars are on stage right now introducing this year's crop of nominees. They're each paying tribute to the current contenders — a nice format that the Oscars producers haven't used on the telecast since 2009.\n\nKimmel's tongue-in-cheek monologue, in which he teased the nominees, was warmly received.\n\nFrom his first joke about the show's slight delay — noting that they were running five minutes behind despite starting an hour earlier than normal — to the final moment in which he touched on the writers strike, many in the room appeared to applaud most of the jabs.\n\n“Before we celebrate ourselves let’s have a very well-deserved round of applause for people behind the scenes,\" Kimmel said, introducing many of Hollywood's hardest-working employees and bringing them to the stage.\n\nDuring the year of Barbie, the \"Barbie\" snubs stood out right from the top of the show.\n\nMargot Robbie was not nominated for best actress and Greta Gerwig was not nominated for best director, prompting outcry — which Kimmel acknowledged during his opening monologue, saying many people wanted Gerwig to win for her direction.\n\n\"I know you’re clapping, but you’re the ones who didn’t vote for her,\" he added.\n\nThe Oscars ceremony opened with multiple shots of Robbie in her title role, both during the movie montage and as the first joke in Kimmel's monologue. \"Barbie\" did receive nine nominations, including Ryan Gosling for supporting actor and \"I'm Just Ken.\"\n\n“Ryan and Margot, I want you to know that even if neither one of you wins an Oscar tonight, you both already won something much more important,” Kimmel added. “The genetic lottery.”\n\nKimmel opens with an apparent dig at AI\n\n\"Look at these beautiful human actors,\" host Jimmy Kimmel cracked as he started his monologue. It came across as a dig at artificial intelligence. The tech continues to be a big source of panic in Hollywood. Writers, actors and other laborers in showbiz are worried about being replaced by AI, even after negotiating protections during last year's strike talks.\n\nICYMI: Messi the dog is in his seat\n\nMessi the dog, star of \"Anatomy of a Fall,\" appears to be seated and ready for the ceremony to begin.\n\nEarlier on the red carpet, the film's director, Justine Triet, assured Variety that the dog would be a no-show at tonight's ceremony. After \"running jokes\" with host Jimmy Kimmel, it looks like the canine star is confirmed to be in attendance.\n\nKimmel gave him a shout-out to the pup in his monologue, calling his performance \"incredible.\"\n\nThe show kicks off with a montage of major nominees\n\n... including the 10 best picture contenders. Let's go!\n\nLAPD orders protesters near Dolby Theatre to leave\n\nand\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department has ordered protesters near the Dolby Theatre to leave the area immediately.\n\nAhead of the Oscars ceremony, about 200 people turned up to protest Israel’s war in Gaza in response to the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel.\n\nSome red carpet arrivals were slowed by as much as an hour, according to The Associated Press.\n\nAs its officers maintained the multi-block security zone around the venue, the department declared a citywide tactical alert, which allows supervisors to keep officers on-duty beyond their shift times in case extra police are needed for specific incidents.\n\nThe tactical alert appears to have been declared in response to the protest. No arrests have been made.\n\nThe department already had the area around the theater cordoned off as part of its customary security measures for the Academy Awards, and the FBI was assisting with security measures as a precaution.\n\n\"The FBI has a presence at various special events, to include the Academy Awards, in order to share intelligence and to support our partners at the LAPD who have the lead on securing venues for functions in the city of Los Angeles,\" the bureau said in a statement last week.\n\nLily Gladstone's full-circle yearbook superlative\n\nLily Gladstone could make her high school superlative come true 20 years after her classmates predicted she was “Most Likely to Win an Oscar.” A now-viral yearbook photo of the actor and her classmate Josh Ryder has been resurfaced since her nomination as a poignant predictor of her success.\n\nRyder recorded a heartfelt video wishing his former classmate good luck ahead of what could be a historic win for best actress.\n\n\"So this is where it started, and look at you now,\" Ryder says, holding up their 2004 yearbook. \"We are so proud of the journey that you've been on. ... How lucky is the world to get to witness you creating magic. So good luck tonight. No matter what happens, you've got a lot of people on your corner.\"\n\nDa’Vine Joy Randolph has swept awards season\n\nDa’Vine Joy Randolph is considered a lock in the best supporting actress category.\n\nRandolph, who played school cafeteria manager Mary Lamb in “The Holdovers,” has already dominated awards season. She has already nabbed a Golden Globe, a Critics’ Choice Award, a BAFTA and a Screen Actors Guild Award.\n\nVanessa Hudgens announces pregnancy on red carpet\n\nVanessa Hudgens is pregnant.\n\nThe “High School Musical” star, who is co-hosting an ABC Oscars pre-show, debuted her baby bump while walking the red carpet.\n\nWearing a long-sleeved black dress, Hudgens appears in photos placing her hands on her stomach while posing for pictures.\n\nHudgens and husband, baseball player Cole Tucker, got married in December in a ceremony in Mexico.\n\nThe two were first spotted together in late 2020. Hudgens told \"Entertainment Tonight\" in April 2021 that they met on a Zoom meditation led by podcaster Jay Shetty.\n\nJulianne Hough, her carpet co-star, and other actors congratulated Hudgens as she interviewed them.\n\nColman Domingo says he cares 'deeply about depictions of Black men in the world and making spaces for women'\n\nOscar-nominated actor Colman Domingo opened up about his responsibility to the roles he plays.\n\nDomingo, who earned a best actor nomination for his role in the drama \"Rustin,\" told E! News he hopes people know that he aims to \"humanize all these men that I play, whether they’re heroes or villains.\"\n\n\"I don't want them to just be put in marble because they're a hero or some sort of civil rights figure,\" said Domingo, who is also in \"The Color Purple.\" \"And I don't want them also to be villainized because they are a hurt person hurting people.\"\n\nDomingo, who's only the second openly gay man to earn an Oscar nomination for playing a gay character, added that he cares \"deeply about depictions of Black men in the world and making spaces for women and in all of our communities as well.\"\n\n\"I feel like the industry has now seen me at my fullest and see how I want to actually shape and reshape this industry with everything that I have,\" he said.\n\nThe actor stunned with not only his moving words but also his look. Draped in a Louis Vuitton suit and country western boots, David Yurman jewelry and an Omega watch, Domingo certainly captured eyes across the carpet.\n\n\"I wanted to just shine like a diamond,\" he said.\n\nJodie Foster says she doesn't think about her age\n\nJodie Foster, 61, told Laverne Cox on E! News that she's \"happier than I've ever been\" in her 60s. Foster is nominated for best supporting actress for her role in \"Nyad.\"\n\nPour one out for the movies that got zero Oscar nominations\n\nOscar pundits largely agree that this year's slate of nominees is one of the strongest in recent memory. But a handful of acclaimed films released last year were totally locked out of the running.\n\nThe list includes A.V. Rockwell’s “A Thousand and One,” Andrew Haigh's \"All of Us Strangers,\" Wes Anderson's \"Asteroid City,\" Sean Durkin's \"The Iron Claw,\" Ava DuVernay's \"Origin\" and Sofia Coppola's \"Priscilla.\"\n\nP.S. I was hoping that \"BlackBerry\" would get more awards attention. Glenn Howerton, who co-starred as a foul-mouthed tech executive, deserved a spot in the best supporting actor conversation.\n\nDwayne 'The Rock' Johnson praises 'Oppenheimer'\n\nDwayne Johnson, who is presenting tonight, said he's excited to celebrate \"passion, hard work\" at the Oscars. When it came to his favorite films of the year, he gave a shout-out on the E! red carpet to \"Oppenheimer\" and commended director Christopher Nolan for doing a \"brilliant job.\"\n\nJohnson also talked up \"Smashing Machine,\" his upcoming movie with \"Jungle Cruise\" co-star Emily Blunt, who's nominated for best supporting actress for \"Oppenheimer.\" \"Smashing Machine\" has another \"Oppenheimer\" connection, too: It's being directed by Benny Safdie, who played Edward Teller in Nolan's epic.\n\nKe Huy Quan says his phone was ringing off the hook after first win\n\nActor Ke Huy Quan, star of last year's Oscar darling \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" and a winner for his performance in that movie last year, spoke on the red carpet about the way his win affected his career.\n\n\"Last year, I ran up to Steven Spielberg ... and he said, 'Ke, you’re an Oscar-winning actor now,'\" he told ABC News.\n\nQuan said that he didn't quite grasp what that meant at the time but that starting the next day, he immediately started getting calls, and new roles were ready for him. He reflected on a time before all the success.\n\n\"I remember what it was like, all those years trying to convince producers and filmmakers to give me an opportunity,\" he said.\n\nThe category where there's actual suspense\n\nVanity Fair declared that this year's Oscars will probably be \"very predictable,\" but there's at least one major category where there's suspense: best actress.\n\nLily Gladstone (\"Killers of the Flower Moon\") and Emma Stone (\"Poor Things\") are widely seen as the front-runners in the best actress race, and they've each scooped up precursor awards this season.\n\nGladstone won a Screen Actors Guild Award. Stone, who just hit the red carpet, won a British Academy Film Award and a Critics' Choice Award. They both won Golden Globes.\n\nI'd put my money on Gladstone, who seemed to have momentum in recent weeks. If she wins tonight, she would make history as the first Native American person to earn a competitive acting Oscar.\n\n‘Barbenheimer’ account for 88% of best picture slate’s box office haul\n\nIt was no surprise that Warner Bros.′ “Barbie” and Universal’s “Oppenheimer” were among the 10 best-picture nominees announced for this year’s Academy Awards ceremony. The duo exploded into cinemas in July, generating big box-office bucks and enchanting critics and audiences alike.\n\nHelmed by academy darlings Greta Gerwig and Christopher Nolan, respectively, the films were on Oscars prediction lists for months. Although Gerwig missed out on a best director nomination, both filmmakers got nods for their screenplays.\n\nThe tag team of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” also represented 88% of the cumulative box-office haul generated by the best picture nominees before their nominations, according to data from Comscore.\n\nThe 10 best picture films together tallied $1.09 billion at the domestic box office before the Oscar nominees were announced. That’s the fifth-highest haul for the slate of nominees since the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences began nominating 10 titles for the top award in 2009.\n\n“Barbenheimer” accounted for $963.1 million of this year’s figure.\n\nAmerica Ferrera is reportedly handing out the loveliest Oscars souvenirs\n\nFerrera, who was nominated for a best supporting actress Oscar for her role in the blockbuster hit \"Barbie,\" is spreading the love on the red carpet.\n\nHer team reportedly has been handing out heart-shaped temporary tattoos on the red carpet, according to Variety. And the tats come in a bag aptly labeled \"It is literally impossible to be a woman!\" — a reference to her character Gloria's iconic speech in the film.\n\nWe want one!\n\nEmma Stone says 'Poor Things' poses life's important questions\n\nEmma Stone is nominated for best actress for her role in \"Poor Things\" about a woman who has the brain of a baby transplanted in her head.\n\nShe says she hopes the film raises existential questions, like \"If you could explore the world freely, what would you be and who would you become?\"\n\nDanielle Brooks says her nails pay tribute to her Oscar nomination\n\nDanielle Brooks, who is nominated for best supporting actress for her performance as Sofia in \"The Color Purple,\" told E! News that she has 26 crystals on each of her nails because she's the 26th Black woman to be nominated in the category.\n\nDwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union are parent goals\n\nFormer NBA star Dwyane Wade and actor Gabrielle Union stopped on the red carpet to talk about the documentary \"The Dads,\" for which Wade was executive producer. The doc follows five dads as they share their hopes and worries for their trans children.\n\nWade and Union have proudly supported their trans daughter, Zaya.\n\n\"As parents we try to tell our kids there are no boundaries on their futures, but there are boundaries on their future in some communities,\" Wade told ABC News on the carpet.\n\nPaul Giamatti on what he hopes 'The Holdovers' means to viewers\n\nPaul Giamatti, who's nominated for best actor for his role in \"The Holdovers,\" spoke about the film on the E! red carpet.\n\n\"I think it's a good story about empathy. ... You never know who is going to change your life,\" he said.\n\nAmerica Ferrera and Billie Eilish have arrived\n\n“Ugly Betty” fans, this is our moment.\n\nBest supporting actress nominee America Ferrera looks stunning, aptly rocking a Barbie-pink gown on the red carpet. I can’t help but think of how far we’ve come since Betty Suarez walked into the Mode office wearing a Guadalajara poncho. If you know, you know.\n\nBillie Eilish has also arrived ahead of what could be her second best original song win for \"What Was I Made For?\" Eilish, 22, and her brother, Finneas O'Connell, previously won for their James Bond theme song, \"No Time to Die.\"\n\nBest documentary nominees ride school bus to Oscars with L.A. music students\n\nOscar nominees from the documentary short film \"The Last Repair Shop\" boarded a school bus from the Los Angeles Unified School District alongside music students to get to the ceremony. A jubilant scene shot from inside the bus and posted on X by Los Angeles Times photojournalist Allen J. Schaben showed students and nominees dressed in their Oscar evening wear as the bus pulled up to the red carpet.\n\nThe documentary short follows the few remaining people who repair musical instruments for the 80,000 students the L.A. district serves. It's the second-largest school district in the country, behind New York City’s.\n\nMark Ronson teases Ryan Gosling's 'Just Ken' performance\n\nRonson will take the stage tonight with Gosling, who is scheduled to perform \"I'm Just Ken.\"\n\nRonson told Laverne Cox on the red carpet, \"It's an absolutely bananas spectacle. We are only ever going to get to perform this song maybe once with Ryan. ... He has sort of put us all on his shoulders, Ken's shoulders. ... We were backstage before — 'we can't believe we're a part of this.'\"\n\nThe stars of ‘Nai Nai & Wài Pó’ came to slay\n\nThe two grandmas who star in the Oscar-nominated documentary short \"Nai Nai & Wài Pó’\" may have already won the red carpet.\n\nChang Li Hua and Yi Yan Fuei, who are director Sean Wang's paternal and maternal grandmothers, rolled up to the red carpet in wheelchairs, wearing show-stopping colorful power suits and shades, because they're that cool.\n\nThe two have stolen countless hearts for their quirkiness and free spirits, which were on full display in Wang's 17-minute documentary. The short takes an intimate look at the pair's unique sisterhood. The film may be rife with laughter and moments of levity, but it also doesn’t avoid talk of mortality and loss.\n\n“The days we spend feeling pain and the days we spend feeling joy are the same days spent,” Yi Yan Fuei says in Mandarin. “So I’m going to choose joy.”\n\n'Past Lives' star Teo Yoo honors pet tortoise, Momo\n\nTeo Yoo, star of the best picture nominee “Past Lives,” wore a pin on the red carpet to memorialize his pet tortoise, Momo. The German South Korean actor’s fan club call themselves Momos after his beloved pet, who died last year.\n\nHe has yet to get a new tortoise. “I’m going to grieve for a while,” he told Variety on the red carpet.\n\n'American Fiction' star Erika Alexander pays emotional tribute to her mother\n\nActor Erika Alexander, who stars in the nominated film \"American Fiction\" sent an emotional message to her mother on the red carpet.\n\n\"Hi, Mom. It's Erica. Thank you,\" Alexander said before she referred to the 1986 film “My Little Girl,” which she appeared in. \"Thanks for the sacrifice, putting me in that acting course, where they found me in a Merchant Ivory [Productions] film, like, 40 years ago, and spending your last monies on educating your children.\"\n\nShe added, \"I want to say this is your victory. And I walk in this space because of you. And we're not done yet. Thank you, Mom. Love you.\"\n\nAlexander — who plays Coraline, a divorcée who begins a relationship with novelist Monk, played by Jeffrey Wright — called back to when she was discovered at 14 years old at a summer acting class and was cast in the independent film.\n\nSome nominees are wearing 'Artists 4 Ceasefire' pins on red carpet\n\nRed pins in support of a cease-fire between Israel and Gaza have shown up at previous award ceremonies this season and now are appearing on the Oscars red carpet. The pins are from a group called #Artists4Ceasefire, which also wrote an open letter asking President Joe Biden to call for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war.\n\n\"What Was I Made For?\" singer Billie Eilish, \"Origin\" director Ava DuVernay, \"Poor Things\" actor Ramy Youssef and more stars wore the pins on the red carpet.\n\nKaouther Ben Hania, the director of the nominated documentary \"Four Daughters,\" and Misan Harriman, the director of the nominated live action short film \"The After,\" were also seen wearing the pins.\n\n\"A lot of people are going to be wearing these pins tonight,\" Youssef told Variety. \"We want to use where we’re at to speak to people’s hearts.\"\n\nJustine Triet sparkles on the carpet\n\nJustine Triet has arrived at the Oscars in a sparkly suit.\n\nThe French director behind one of this season’s buzziest films, “Anatomy of a Fall,” is now part of the short list of women nominated for best director.\n\nTriet joins Greta Gerwig, Kathryn Bigelow, Chloé Zhao, Sofia Coppola, Emerald Fennell, Jane Campion and Lina Wertmüller in accomplishing the feat. Bigelow, Zhao and Campion are the only women to have won.\n\nTriet is the only woman nominated in the category this year after Gerwig’s “Barbie” snub heard around the world. She's also nominated for best original screenplay, and her film is competing for best actress, best original screenplay, best editing and the coveted best picture.\n\nEva Mendes posted her support for her Ken\n\nEva Mendes is showing support for her best supporting actor-nominated husband, Ryan Gosling. In an Instagram post, Mendes shared a video of herself in front of what appears to be Gosling's dressing room at the Oscars, set to the song \"I'm Just Ken.\"\n\n\"Always by my man,\" Mendes captioned her video.\n\nGosling will perform the song with a fleet of Kens during the telecast.\n\nSandra Hüller didn't want to know 'Anatomy of a Fall' mystery\n\nSandra Hüller, who is nominated for best actress for her starring role in \"Anatomy of a Fall,\" said the actors opted not to learn the true reason her character's husband mysteriously died.\n\n\"I really wanted to know, but then all of us figured it would be nice to play with a question,\" she told E! News on the red carpet.\n\nMessi the dog is here after all!\n\nAmid reports that Messi, the canine star of \"Anatomy of a Fall,\" would miss this year's ceremony, the border collie has been spotted at the Oscars.\n\nJimmy Kimmel, who is hosting for the fourth time, posted a video with Messi to Instagram this afternoon. “Running jokes before the Oscars,” Kimmel said in the caption.\n\nHopefully Kimmel can get a few more laughs out of the human audience tonight.\n\nMaitreyi Ramakrishnan of 'Never Have I Ever' pokes fun at her first time at the Oscars\n\nActor Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, who is attending the Oscars for the first time this year, hilariously roasted herself while on the red carpet talking to Variety.\n\n\"Am I giving like 'first time at the Oscars' energy?\" asked Ramakrishnan, star of Netflix’s “Never Have I Ever.” \"You can be honest. I know I am. I'm giving tourist.\"\n\nRamakrishnan may feel that way. But with her rocking a stunning black and white gown and a glow of confidence on the carpet, we think she's giving seasoned vet.\n\n'Godzilla Minus One' nominees honor monster on carpet\n\n\"Godzilla Minus One\" became the first film in the \"Godzilla\" franchise to get an Academy Award nomination.\n\nThe film's nominees, who received a nod in the best visual effects category, came to the Oscars dressed very on theme.\n\nMasaki Takahashi, Takashi Yamazaki, Kiyoko Shibuya and Tatsuji Nojima rocked Godzilla-themed shoes.\n\nA look at Margot Robbie's most notable 'Barbie' looks\n\nand\n\nThis Barbie's got amazing red carpet looks.\n\nMargot Robbie, the star of \"Barbie,\" has used the Mattel doll's iconic looks as inspiration for many red carpets since the film's debut last summer.\n\nHere are some of our favorites:\n\nWill Robbie rock another look on the Oscars carpet? We'll find out very soon.\n\nJohn Williams, at 92, is nominated for the 54th time\n\nNo living person has more Oscar nominations (54) than John Williams, composer of iconic scores for films such as “Jaws,” “Star Wars” and three “Harry Potter” films. In fact, no person other than the late Walt Disney (59) has more total nominations to his or her name. And at 92, Williams is also the oldest Oscar nominee in history. All told, he has won five Academy Awards, the most recent for “Schindler’s List” at the 1994 ceremony.\n\nThis year he’s up for “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” the fifth film in the franchise and the first without Williams’ most frequent collaborator, director Steven Spielberg. Originally, Williams wasn’t even supposed to write the full score for the new Indy film, just some themes. But, he told Variety, he fell head over heels for Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s character, Helena, composed a theme for her — and just kept going from there.\n\n“Helena’s Theme,” incidentally, has already won Williams another award: his 26th Grammy.\n\nHollywood's newest celeb is the dog from ‘Anatomy of a Fall’\n\nMessi, the border collie who played Snoop in “Anatomy of a Fall,” has been lauded for his breakout performance in the film, which is nominated for best picture.\n\nThe pup delivered a poignant performance in a pivotal scene and even trained for two months to learn how to play dead effectively. Last year, his hard work paid off: He claimed the Palm Dog — the most prestigious prize available to canine performers.\n\nBut even four-legged stars can be subjected to the pressures of Hollywood.\n\n“I’m a little bit scared that he’s just going to be typecast in roles where he has to die,” Messi’s owner told Variety. “These are the kind of roles we’re being asked to do now.”\n\nSadly, Messi is not eligible for an Academy Award tonight.\n\nHe was, however, at the Academy Award Nominees Luncheon in February, when Neon (the distributor of \"Anatomy of a Fall\") posted a picture of him on Instagram.\n\nTonight, it’s unclear whether he will be spotted by pupparazzi on the red carpet. The Hollywood Reporter reported Friday that the VI-pup will not be attending the ceremony. But one social media image circulating over the weekend suggested otherwise.\n\nRyan Gosling and other performers at this year’s Oscars\n\nThe vocalists behind the five nominees for best original song are expected to perform:\n\n—Gosling and Mark Ronson (“I’m Just Ken” from “Barbie”)\n\n—Billie Eilish and Finneas O’Connell (“What Was I Made For” from “Barbie”). The song is considered the front-runner, especially after it won song of the year at the Grammys.\n\n—Becky G (“The Fire Inside” from “Flamin’ Hot”)\n\n—Jon Batiste (“It Never Went Away” from “American Symphony”)\n\n—Scott George and the Osage Singers (“Wahzhazhe ((A Song for My People))” from “Killers of the Flower Moon”)\n\nShould creators be interviewing celebrities at red carpet events?\n\nAs awards season wraps up, several viral exchanges between a handful of influencers and A-list stars have prompted some people online to ask: Why are influencers getting tapped for these events in the first place?\n\nThe discussion came to a head last month after the People’s Choice Awards, where “Barbie” actor America Ferrera appeared to be startled by TikToker Harry Daniels on the red carpet. Some online called his bit — in which he asked people to choose between “having a gay son or thot daughter” — disrespectful.\n\nThe following weekend, creator Juju Green, better known as Straw Hat Goofy online, garnered backlash after having referred to the popular “when your card declines at therapy” meme in a video from the Film Independent Spirit Awards carpet, where he recorded “Killers of the Flower Moon” star Lily Gladstone. The video has been removed from TikTok, but many stitched it in their own critical responses.\n\nThe academy has tapped Amelia Dimoldenberg, creator of the YouTube interview series “Chicken Shop Date,” to be a “social media ambassador and red carpet correspondent\" tonight. Dimoldenberg hosted the 2023 Golden Globes red carpet, where her viral interviews helped bring attention to the show.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nSunday’s forecast is slightly cloudy, but rain-free\n\nLos Angeles has been pretty rainy lately. Luckily, today’s forecast is gloomy — but not wet.\n\nThe high is expected to be 70 degrees, according to the Weather Channel.\n\nStars are starting to arrive on the red carpet at the Dolby Theatre. We'll be on watch for some of the best looks of the night.\n\nRed carpet watch: Lily Gladstone’s ‘museum-worthy’ look\n\nLily Gladstone teased her Oscar look would be “museum-worthy” ahead of the Oscars, where she is nominated for best actress for her performance in “Killers of the Flower Moon.”\n\nGladstone, who could make history tonight as the first Native American person to win a competitive acting Oscar, said her outfit would highlight Indigenous designers.\n\n“It’s going to be just ongoing proof that Indigenous design belongs on red carpets with luxury fashion in a very centerpiece kind of way. I’m excited,” she told People.\n\nMartin Scorsese is the most-nominated living director\n\nMartin Scorsese, revered by cinephiles as one of the art form’s patron saints, goes into tonight’s ceremony as the most-nominated living director, with 10 nods to his name.\n\nHe’s nominated this year for “Killers of the Flower Moon,” and he was previously a contender for “The Irishman,” “The Wolf of Wall Street,” “Hugo,” “The Departed,” “The Aviator,” “Gangs of New York,” “Goodfellas,” “The Last Temptation of Christ” and “Raging Bull.”\n\nHe has earned the best director trophy just once, for “The Departed.”\n\nIn the 96-year history of the film academy, only one other filmmaker racked up more best director nominations: William Wyler, at 12. He won the award for “Mrs. Miniver, “The Best Years of Our Lives” and “Ben-Hur.”\n\nHere's what's on chef Wolfgang Puck's Oscars menu\n\nOscars night is going to be exciting — and delicious.\n\nAhead of tonight, Wolfgang Puck shared his menu for the 2024 Oscars Governors Ball, which happens after the ceremony. This is Puck’s third time creating the menu for the Governors Ball.\n\n“We’re going to have some traditional dishes and also some very new innovations,” Puck said on ABC’s “Good Morning America” ahead of the ceremony.\n\nMenu items include a truffle chicken pot pie, Oscar-shaped smoked salmon, golden edible Oscars and “bougie tots” — caviar-covered tater tots.\n\nColman Domingo and Jodie Foster get nods for playing gay characters\n\nStraight actors have a long history of being recognized by the Academy Awards for playing gay characters, but the list of openly LGBTQ actors who have had such recognition is much shorter. This year, however, Colman Domingo and Jodie Foster have joined that exclusive club.\n\nDomingo was nominated for best actor in a leading role for playing the title character in “Rustin,” Netflix’s biopic about the gay Black civil rights leader Bayard Rustin, an adviser to Martin Luther King Jr. and the architect of the 1963 March on Washington.\n\nFoster won two Academy Awards and was nominated for three others before she came out at the 2013 Golden Globe Awards. She was nominated this year for her supporting role in “Nyad,” yet another Netflix biopic. Foster plays out lesbian Bonnie Stoll, the real-life friend and coach of the title character, long-distance swimmer Diana Nyad. Annette Bening, who has been married to actor Warren Beatty for more than 30 years, was nominated in the best actress category for her portrayal of the outspoken lesbian swimmer.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nIt’s nominee Sterling K. Brown’s first Oscars\n\nSterling K. Brown, nominated for his role in \"American Fiction,\" is headed to the Oscars for the first time.\n\nBrown shared his reaction to the news on Instagram in January, saying it will be his \"first time going to the party.\" He called it \"an honor.\"\n\nHollywood loves a good Oscars party\n\nIf you’re a celebrity in L.A.,the week before the Oscars is a giant party. Tonight has the biggest parties of them all on deck, including:\n\n—Vanity Fair’s annual party at the Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts, Beverly Hills\n\n—The Governors Ball — the official Academy after-party at The Ray Dolby Ballroom in Hollywood\n\n—Netflix’s party at Mother Wolf in Hollywood\n\n—Universal Pictures and Focus Features’ party at Soho House in West Hollywood\n\n—Beyoncé and Jay Z’s annual Gold Party for VIPs at Chateau Marmont\n\nRead more in Variety’s round-up here.\n\nWes Anderson eyes first Oscar — in the short film race\n\nWes Anderson’s visual imprint is all over contemporary American culture, from AI-generated art to “Saturday Night Live” parodies. But the distinctive director has never won an Academy Award.\n\nWell, that could change tonight. Anderson is nominated in the best live-action short film category for “The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar,” a whimsical 39-minute tale adapted from a story of the same name by the famed author Roald Dahl. (Anderson’s take on “Henry Sugar” was one of four short films he made for Netflix.)\n\nFive of Anderson’s feature films have received Oscar nominations. “The Royal Tenenbaums” and “Moonrise Kingdom” got nods for best original screenplay. “Fantastic Mr. Fox” and “Isle of Dogs” were up for best animated feature. “The Grand Budapest Hotel” earned three nominations: best picture, best director and best original screenplay.\n\nIn this year’s best live-action short film category, “Henry Sugar” is going up against “The After,” “Invincible,” “Knight of Fortune” and “Red, White and Blue.”\n\nAngela Bassett and Mel Brooks won honorary Oscars this year\n\nThe official ceremony for the 96th Academy Awards has yet to begin, but four people have already won Oscars this year.\n\nIn early January, four Hollywood luminaries received lifetime achievement prizes at the film academy’s annual Governors Awards ceremony. Angela Bassett, Mel Brooks and film editor Carol Littleton (“E.T.,” “The Big Chill”) were given honorary trophies; Sundance Film Festival executive Michelle Satter took home the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award.\n\nBassett has earned two acting nominations, for “What’s Love Got to Do with It” and “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.” Brooks won the original screenplay Oscar for the comedy classic “The Producers,” and he later got nominated for writing “Young Frankenstein” as well as the lyrics to the title theme from “Blazing Saddles.”\n\nStudents send messages of encouragement to Lily Gladstone\n\nAhead of Oscars night, IllumiNative, a Native woman-led organization, shared a video of first grade students at Stamiksiitsiikin (Bullshoe) Elementary in Browning, Montana, sending good luck and congratulations to “Killers of the Flower Moon” star Lily Gladstone, who is nominated for best actress.\n\nThe Blackfeet immersion class shared messages of encouragement and held signs reading “Good luck Lily.”\n\n“Their enthusiasm and support are a testament to the pride and inspiration Lily Gladstone has sparked in Native communities and beyond,” IllumiNative said.\n\nGladstone, who has Blackfeet and Nez Percé heritage, responded to the video on Thursday in a post on X with a series of emoji.\n\nIllumiNative also has a watch party kit available to “join the celebration of Native representation at the Oscars.”\n\nWhy America Ferrera’s ‘Barbie’ monologue resonated\n\nAmerica Ferrera delivered one of the year’s most memorable monologues in her role in \"Barbie\" as Gloria, a Mattel employee with an imagination so expansive it summons Barbie to the real world. Movie fans around the world reacted with awe, and sometimes criticism, to the 2 ½-minute speech, which relayed the baggage that comes with simply existing as a woman in the world.\n\n“You have to never get old. Never be rude, never show off, never be selfish, never fall down, never fail, never show fear, never get out of line. It’s too hard. It’s too contradictory. ... And it turns out, in fact, that not only are you doing everything wrong, but also everything is your fault!” Gloria tells her daughter and a group of Barbies.\n\nIn some ways, Ferrera’s path to the biggest nomination of her career reflects many of the themes she espoused in Gloria’s monologue.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nThrowback: It’s been 10 years since ‘Adele Dazeem’\n\nIdina Menzel is celebrating 10 years since John Travolta accidentally called her “Adele Dazeem” while introducing her at the Oscars. In a TikTok posted to her account, she shouted out the alias, which has been a popular meme over the last decade.\n\n“Hey Adele Dazeem, it’s Idina Menzel. I just wanted to say, ‘Happy birthday.’ Sending you so much love and positivity. I hope you have the best, best day,” Menzel jokes in the clip.\n\nTravolta’s cadence as he delivered the introduction in 2014, calling Menzel the “wickedly talented Adele Dazeem,” has been seared into our minds ever since.\n\n‘Nai Nai & Wài Pó’ celebrate nomination\n\nFilmmaker Sean Wang shared a moment of celebration with his family when they learned his short film about his grandmothers, “Nai Nai & Wài Pó,” had been nominated for an Oscar.\n\nThe 17-minute documentary takes an intimate look at the unique sisterhood between Wang’s paternal and maternal grandmothers. The pair initially met because of Wang’s parents and took a particular liking to each other.\n\nThey became close after the deaths of their husbands, and eventually they chose to live together. In the film, the grandmothers spend their days reading the paper, throwing two-person dance parties and pulling other shenanigans while ending their nights by sleeping in the same bed. There’s also the occasional fart or two.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nAwards season has been largely been apolitical. Will that change tonight?\n\nWhile awards shows can get political, particularly during election years, many stars have not been as vocal about hot-button issues such as the Gaza crisis during recent Hollywood events.\n\nJust two recent awards shows featured moments in which celebrities did make statements. At the Grammys, singer Annie Lennox called for a cease-fire in Gaza during her tribute to Sinéad O’Connor. Meanwhile, the group boygenius, which took home several Grammys, sported red pins that said “artists for ceasefire.” At the BAFTAs, \"The Zone of Interest\" producer James Wilson used his acceptance speech to call for an end to “selective empathy” in conflict.\n\nWhether the Oscars ceremony will have political moments this year is hard to predict. It’s not uncommon for the winners in the documentary categories to nod to current affairs.\n\nLast year, \"Navalny,\" a portrait of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny (who died in February), took home the best documentary feature award. In his acceptance speech, director Daniel Roher dedicated the statuette to Navalny and to all political prisoners around the world.\n\nThis year, \"20 Days in Mariupol,\" a documentary that follows Ukrainian journalists trapped in the city of Mariupol amid the Russian invasion, is among the nominees. \"The ABCs of Book Banning,\" which features interviews with kids affected by the recently banned books in certain U.S. states, is also among the documentary short contenders.\n\nMeanwhile, some stars could emulate boygenius and make more subtle statements with their fashion choices.\n\nICYMI: A casting category is coming in 2026\n\nA new category is coming to the Oscars, but not this year.\n\nThe academy announced in February that best achievement in casting will be introduced at the 98th Academy Awards for films released in 2025.\n\n“Casting directors play an essential role in filmmaking, and as the Academy evolves, we are proud to add casting to the disciplines that we recognize and celebrate,” said academy CEO Bill Kramer and President Janet Yang. Casting directors have been calling for recognition for their work since the 1990s, when a push for a casting category at the Oscars was unsuccessful.\n\nLos Angeles police preparing for possible protests outside Oscars\n\nand\n\nLos Angeles police are aware of potential protests that may target Hollywood’s biggest night, and they will respond as needed, said a senior law enforcement source familiar with preparation for the Academy Awards.\n\n“The Academy Awards is always one of the most protected events in Los Angeles and the nation,” the source said, and “that will certainly not change this year.”\n\nIn recent weeks, activists protesting Israel’s war in Gaza have called for an immediate cease-fire in public demonstrations across the U.S., including outside the Grammy Awards in early February.\n\nGreta Gerwig and Margot Robbie on ‘Barbie’ snubs\n\nAlthough “Barbie” took over the world last year, star and producer Margot Robbie was locked out of the best actress race and Greta Gerwig did not make the cut in the best director category.\n\nThe film scored eight nods total, including best picture and supporting actress (America Ferrera for her portrayal as Gloria). But many called out academy voters online, noting the irony that Ryan Gosling was nominated in the best supporting actor category (even though he’s “just Ken”).\n\nIn February, Gerwig addressed the snubs. “Of course I wanted it for Margot,” she told TIME. “But I’m just happy we all get to be there together.”\n\nShe added: “A friend’s mom said to me, ‘I can’t believe you didn’t get nominated,” recalled Gerwig. “I said, ‘But I did. I got an Oscar nomination.’ She was like, ‘Oh, that’s wonderful for you!’ I was like, ‘I know!’”\n\nRobbie similarly told the LA Times she wishes Gerwig had been honored in the directing category.\n\n“As a producer and her actor, would I have loved to see Greta nominated for directing? Of course,” she said. “But she did become the first director to have their first three solo directorial efforts nominated for best picture, which is pretty historic. She cracked the code on this film, as only she could. It is such a singular vision, and Greta brought so much humanity, creativity, inspiration, magic and joy to Barbie. And it’s because of her we’ve all received such acclaim.”\n\nOscars gets promo'd on Vegas Sphere\n\nHost Kimmel and some Oscar statuettes made their way onto Las Vegas' Sphere.\n\nThe massive, eye-catching entertainment center opened in September, and it has since been used as a way to promote many events, including the Super Bowl.\n\n\"Ever since I was a little boy growing up in Vegas, I dreamed about A. being on the Sphere and B. That there would be a Sphere,\" Kimmel wrote on Instagram.\n\nAll the LGBTQ-related films nominated this year\n\nThis year’s nominated films are a treat for LGBTQ movie fans, with queer storylines that span decades, geographies and genres. Here are a few of the films with LGBTQ themes and characters that are up for Oscars tonight:\n\n—“Rustin”\n\n—“Anatomy of a Fall”\n\n—“Maestro”\n\n—“Nimona”\n\n—“The Color Purple”\n\nRead a more comprehensive list here.\n\nTikTok will have a presence at the Oscars\n\nLive from the red carpet it’s … TikTok.\n\nTwo well-known #FilmTok creators are hosting a stream from Hollywood’s biggest night, the platform said in a news release. Joe Aragon, who goes by @cinema.joe on the platform, and Yasmine Sahid, who goes by @ladyyasmina1, will host the stream, which will be broadcast on the @tiktok, @oscars, and @abcnetwork accounts in the U.S.\n\nAragon is known for his analysis of film and movie reviews, while Sahid is known for her comedic re-enactments of popular media from the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s. The pair will “interview attendees, spotlight this year’s nominees, and share a behind the scenes look from the carpet,” according to a release from TikTok.\n\nThis isn’t the first time #FilmTok has been present at a major industry event. TikTok has partnered with Cannes Film Festival three years in a row, bringing a short-form film competition to the festival.\n\nDanielle Brooks is the sole Oscar nominee for ‘The Color Purple’\n\n“The Color Purple” made a splash at the Christmas box office, comes from a powerful literary and cinematic lineage, and scored better with critics than best picture nominee “Maestro,” according to Rotten Tomatoes. And yet it only nabbed one Oscar nomination: Danielle Brooks in the best supporting actress category.\n\nWhile the lack of other nominations for the movie left many fans scratching their heads, Brooks’ nod is nonetheless interesting for Oscar watchers. In the movie, a musical adaptation of Alice Walker’s classic Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, she plays Sofia. That happens to be the same role Oprah Winfrey played in the 1985 film adaptation -- resulting in a best supporting actress nomination for the talk show legend. Winfrey served as a producer for the new film, as did the prior movie’s director, Steven Spielberg, who was famously snubbed from a best director nomination in 1986 despite his film racking up 11 nods, including best picture.\n\nThis is also not the first time two different actors have been nominated for the same role. Some examples: Marlon Brando and Robert DeNiro both won in different years for playing Vito Corleone in the first two “Godfather” movies, Kate Winslet and Judi Dench were both nominated for playing Iris Murdoch in “Iris,” Jeff Bridges was nominated for playing Rooster Cogburn in the “True Grit” remake decades after John Wayne won for the same part, and Rita Moreno and Ariana DeBose both won best supporting actress for playing Anita in “West Side Story” — 60 years apart.\n\nWatch the Today Show break down some of the biggest snubs and surprises.\n\nCharles Melton, Greta Lee and other Asian actors shut out\n\nMany social media users pointed out that, after a historic year for Asian actors in 2023, it was disappointing to see Asian talent shut out of the acting categories this year.\n\nCharles Melton, who drew critical acclaim for “May December,” and Greta Lee and Teo Yoo, who enraptured viewers in the best picture nominee “Past Lives,” were all left out of the race. Korean-Canadian filmmaker Celine Song, who directed “Past Lives,” was also not nominated for best director — however she received a nomination for best original screenplay.\n\n‘Barbie’ cast featured in Kimmel’s fun Oscars promo video\n\nEven host Jimmy Kimmel knows people probably prefer Barbieland to the real world.\n\nSo it's no surprise that in a promo for the Oscars, the host leaned heavily into people's love for \"Barbie,\" which is nominated in eight categories this year.\n\nNarrated by Helen Mirren, who also serves as the film's narrator, the spot features Kimmel lost and looking at an Oscars road map. He enlists help from “Barbie” stars Ryan Gosling, America Ferrera and Kate McKinnon to get to Hollywood in time for the big night.\n\nWhere to stream this year’s best picture contenders\n\nThough there may not be enough time to stream all the nominees in the hours before the show, we have a guide to how you can watch any of the 10 best picture nominees from home.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nWill Smith is still banned from the Oscars post-slap\n\nWill Smith is still persona non grata at the Oscars.\n\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the organization behind the Oscars, said in 2022 that it would prohibit the “King Richard” actor from attending the ceremony for 10 years after he slapped Chris Rock for making a joke about his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith.\n\nRead more here.\n\nOscar predictions: Who are the front-runners?\n\n“Oppenheimer” is widely considered a lock for best picture. The film earned equivalent honors at the Golden Globe Awards, the Critics’ Choice Awards, the British Academy Film Awards, or BAFTAs, and the Producers Guild of America Awards.\n\nNone of the acting nominees is more of a sure thing than Da’Vine Joy Randolph, who is almost certain to win the best supporting actress trophy for her performance as a boarding school cafeteria manager mourning the death of her son in the Vietnam War in “The Holdovers.” Randolph has already nabbed a Golden Globe, a Critics’ Choice Award, a BAFTA and a Screen Actors Guild Award for her work in the movie.\n\nThe three other acting races are not as predictable, but most awards pundits have put their proverbial money on Cillian Murphy (“Oppenheimer”) for best actor, Lily Gladstone (“Killers of the Flower Moon”) for best actress and Robert Downey Jr. (“Oppenheimer”) for best supporting actor.\n\nWho’s presenting?\n\nThe roster of presenters includes the four performers who won acting Oscars at last year’s ceremony: Michelle Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan and Jamie Lee Curtis (all from “Everything Everywhere All at Once”) and Brendan Fraser (“The Whale”).\n\nThe presenter lineup includes other actors who have won Academy Awards over the years, including Mahershala Ali (“Moonlight,” “Green Book”), Sally Field (\"Norma Rae\" and \"Places in the Heart\"), Regina King (“If Beale Street Could Talk”), Jennifer Lawrence (“Silver Linings Playbook”), Rita Moreno (“West Side Story”), Matthew McConaughey (“Dallas Buyers Club”) and Lupita Nyong’o (“12 Years a Slave”).\n\nAlso on the list: Bad Bunny, Dwayne Johnson, Kate McKinnon, John Mulaney, Ramy Youssef, Zendaya, Steven Spielberg, Melissa McCarthy, Anya Taylor-Joy and Issa Rae.\n\nWhat are the most nominated films this year?\n\n—“Oppenheimer” dominated nominations, receiving 13 total.\n\n—“Killers of the Flower Moon” received 10 nominations, including a posthumous nom for Robbie Robertson’s score.\n\n—“Poor Things” also received 10 nominations.\n\n—“Barbie” nabbed eight nominations.\n\n—“Maestro” scored seven nominations.\n\n—“American Fiction,” “Anatomy of a Fall,” “The Holdovers” and “Zone of Interest” got five nominations each.\n\nJimmy Kimmel is back as host\n\nJimmy Kimmel is hosting the Oscars for the fourth time, following go-rounds in 2017, 2018 and 2023. (The show went without an emcee in 2019, 2020 and 2021; Regina Hall, Amy Schumer and Wanda Sykes co-hosted in 2022, the year Will Smith slapped Chris Rock.)\n\nKimmel’s most notable moment on the Oscars stage came during his first hosting stint, when the musical “La La Land” was mistakenly announced as the year’s best picture over the actual winner, the independent drama “Moonlight.”\n\nOscar nominees: Read the list\n\nBest picture\n\n“American Fiction”\n\n“Anatomy of a Fall”\n\n“Barbie”\n\n“The Holdovers”\n\n“Killers of the Flower Moon”\n\n“Maestro”\n\n“Oppenheimer”\n\n“Past Lives”\n\n“Poor Things”\n\n“The Zone of Interest”\n\nBest director\n\nJustine Triet, “Anatomy of a Fall”\n\nMartin Scorsese, “Killers of the Flower Moon”\n\nChristopher Nolan, “Oppenheimer”\n\nYorgos Lanthimos, “Poor Things”\n\nJonathan Glazer, “The Zone of Interest”\n\nBest actress\n\nAnnette Bening, “Nyad”\n\nLily Gladstone, “Killers of the Flower Moon”\n\nSandra Hüller, “Anatomy of a Fall”\n\nCarey Mulligan, “Maestro”\n\nEmma Stone, “Poor Things”\n\nBest actor\n\nBradley Cooper, “Maestro”\n\nColman Domingo, “Rustin”\n\nPaul Giamatti, “The Holdovers”\n\nCillian Murphy, “Oppenheimer”\n\nJeffrey Wright, “American Fiction”\n\nBest supporting actress\n\nEmily Blunt, “Oppenheimer”\n\nDanielle Brooks, “The Color Purple”\n\nAmerica Ferrera, “Barbie”\n\nJodie Foster, “Nyad”\n\nDa’Vine Joy Randolph, “The Holdovers”\n\nBest supporting actor\n\nSterling K.

Probably about an hour before at around 3 p.m. PT/6 p.m. ET.\n\nABC said it will have a 30-minute pre-show lead into the live show, hosted by Vanessa Hudgens and Julianne Hough, at 3:30 p.m. PT/6:30 p.m. ET.
