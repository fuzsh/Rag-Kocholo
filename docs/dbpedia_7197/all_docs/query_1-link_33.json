While The Kid falls for the blonde and she makes a play for him, the sheriff becomes suspicious of his absence. Eventually, The Kid's mine, worked in secret, is raided and his two coworkers are killed. With the help of Lorita, The Kid learns that Dick and Virginia are the culprits; after a showdown in which Dick is killed, The Kid escapes with Lorita at his side.",
