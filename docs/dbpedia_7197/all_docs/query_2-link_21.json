        "text": "2nd Academy Awards Date April 3, 1930 Site Ambassador Hotel Host William C. Demille Highlights Best Picture The Broadway Melody Most wins Most nominations In Old Arizona & The Patriot (5)\n\n< 1st Academy Awards 3rd >\n\nThe 2nd Academy Awards ceremony, presented by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), honored the best films released between August 1, 1928, and July 31, 1929. They took place on April 3, 1930, at an awards banquet in the Coconut Grove of The Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. Radio coverage began with this ceremony, with a local broadcast by KNX, Los Angeles. As the ceremony was being held more than eight months after the end of the eligibility period, it was decided that the 3rd Academy Awards would be held in November 1930, so as to bring the awards ceremony closer to the relevant time period. As a result, 1930 was the only calendar year in which two awards ceremonies were held. The second ceremony included a number of changes over the first. Most importantly, it was the first presentation for which the winners were not announced in advance. Additionally, the number of categories was reduced from twelve to seven.\n\nThe 2nd Academy Awards is unique in being the only occasion where there were no official nominees. Mary Pickford, a founding member of AMPAS and the wife of its first president, lobbied to be considered for the Best Actress award, inviting the judges over for tea at her home, while other actresses who were considered for the same award were not made aware of their consideration. Subsequent research by AMPAS has resulted in a list of unofficial or de facto nominees, based on records of which films were evaluated by the judges. This is the only year in which no movie won more than one Oscar.\n\nNominees & Winners[]\n\nOutstanding Picture[]\n\nSee also: Best Outstanding Picture\n\nWinner\n\nThe Broadway Melody — Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\n\nNominees\n\nAlibi — Feature Productions\n\nHollywood Revue — Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\n\nIn Old Arizona — Fox\n\nThe Patriot — Paramount Famous Lasky\n\nBest Director (Dramatic Picture)[]\n\nSee also: Best Director (Dramatic Picture)\n\nWinner\n\nFrank Lloyd — The Divine Lady\n\nNominees\n\nLionel Barrymore — Madame X\n\nHarry Beaumont — The Broadway Melody\n\nIrving Cummings — In Old Arizona\n\nFrank Lloyd — Drag; and Weary River\n\nErnst Lubitsch — The Patriot\n\nBest Actor[]\n\nSee also: Best Actor\n\nWinner\n\nWarner Baxter — In Old Arizona\n\nNominees\n\nLewis Stone — The Patriot\n\nChester Morris — Alibi\n\nBest Actress[]\n\nSee also: Best Actress\n\nWinner\n\nMary Pickford — Coquette\n\nNominees\n\nRuth Chatterton — Madame X\n\nBetty Compson — The Barker\n\nJeanne Eagels — The Letter\n\nCorinne Griffith — The Divine Lady\n\nBessie Love — The Broadway Melody\n\nBest Writing[]\n\nSee also: Best Writing\n\nWinner\n\nHans Kraly — The Patriot\n\nNominees\n\nBess Meredyth — A Woman of Affairs, Wonder of Women\n\nElliott Clawson — The Cop, The Leatherneck, Sal of Singapore, Skyscraper\n\nHans Kraly — The Last of Mrs. Cheyney\n\nBest Art Direction[]\n\nSee also: Best Art Direction\n\nWinner\n\nCedric Gibbons — The Bridge of San Luis Rey\n\nNominees\n\nHarry Oliver — Street Angel\n\nBest Cinematography[]\n\nSee also: Best Cinematography"
