It was produced by Famous Playersâ€“Lasky and distributed by Paramount Pictures.[1][2] The film is based on the 1924 Broadway play Minick by Edna Ferber and George S. Kaufman.[3]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nAs described in a film magazine review,[4] Old Man Prouty moves in with his son, inadvertently becoming a general nuisance by poking into affairs and disrupting plans for everyone. Upon discovering that his son must choose between him and his younger wife, he opts to reside at the Old Men's Home, where he finds companionship among other seniors.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nLuke Cosgrove as Old Man Prouty\n\nWarner Baxter as Fred Prouty\n\nLois Wilson as Nettie Prouty\n\nBen Hendricks Sr. as Jim Corey\n\nMargaret Morris as Lil Corey\n\nJosephine Crowell as Miss Pringle\n\nAdele Watson as Annie\n\nJames Finlayson (unknown role)\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nIn a 1925 review for The New York Times, Mordaunt Hall referred to the play Minick and wrote, \"while this narrative in shadow form still possesses an inevitable undertone of sympathy, it misses fire in some important periods through an obvious fondness for exaggeration and a tendency to ignore opportunities for suspense or subtlety, which is surprising as this picture was directed by the able and versatile James Cruze.\"[5] A 1925 review for Time Magazine noted \"Significant character study is the hardest thing to find in the cinema,\" and stated \"The subtleties of old age in the middle classes escaped even the directorial discernment of James Cruze.\"[6]\n\nPreservation\n\n[edit]\n\nA print of Welcome Home is preserved in the Library of Congress collection.[7][8]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
