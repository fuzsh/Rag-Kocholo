        "text": "Warner Baxter\n\nWarner Leroy Baxter was an American actor, known for his role as The Cisco Kid in In Old Arizona, for which he won the second Academy Award for Best Actor in\n\nthe 1928-1929 Academy Awards. Warner Baxter started his movie career in silent movies. Baxter’s most notable silent movie is probably The Great Gatsby and The Awful Truth. Today The Great Gatsby is one of many lost films of the silent era. When talking movies came out Warner Baxter became even more famous in movies than he was in silent movies. Warner Baxter’s most notable movies in the never ending talking era of film are In Old Arizona 42nd Street, and the 1931 20 minute short movie, The Slippery Pearls.\n\nBaxter was born in Columbus, Ohio, and moved to San Francisco, California with his widowed mother in 1898, when he was nine. Following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, he and his family lived in a tent for two weeks. By 1910 Baxter was in vaudeville, and from there began acting on the stage.\n\nBaxter originally worked as an insurance agent, sales manager and commercial traveller. Baxter began his movie career as an extra in 1914 in a stock company and quickly rose to become a star. He had his first starring role in 1921, in a film called Sheltered Daughters. He starred in 48 features during the 1920s. His most notable silent roles were in The Great Gatsby, Aloma of the South Seas as an island love interest opposite the famous dancer Gilda Gray and a handsome but alcoholic doctor in West of Zanzibar with Lon Chaney. His most famous starring role was as the Cisco Kid in In Old Arizona, the first all-talking western, for which he won the second Academy Award for Best Actor. He also starred in 42nd Street, Grand Canary, Broadway Bill and in Kidnapped” .\n\namzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";amzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";amzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"hwof05-20\";amzn_assoc_search_bar_position = \"bottom\";amzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"search\";amzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";amzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";amzn_assoc_region = \"US\";amzn_assoc_title = \"Shop Warner Baxter\";amzn_assoc_default_search_phrase = \"Warner Baxter\";amzn_assoc_default_category = \"All\";amzn_assoc_linkid = \"e7c1bc9faa39694178e306236677b9ca\";"
