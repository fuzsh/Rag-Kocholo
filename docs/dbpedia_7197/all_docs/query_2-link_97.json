Today, many years later, we still look to the Oscars, or Academy Awards, to point us towards the very best films each year.\n\nHave you ever wondered which Oscar Best Picture winner from our list landed the prestigious title the year you were born? We've compiled a list of every winner in that category from the past 95 years! Honestly, we want to watch them all."
