(1891–1951). American actor Warner Baxter began his career during the silent film era before successfully turning to talkies (see motion pictures). He won an Academy Award for best actor for his role as the Cisco Kid in the adventure film In Old Arizona (1929).

Warner Leroy Baxter was born on March 29, 1889, in Columbus, Ohio. When he was still a child he moved to San Francisco, California, with his mother (his father had died). Baxter began his career in vaudeville, and by 1914 he had secured a bit part in a silent film. By the early 1920s he was starring in several silent movies a year, and at the end of the decade he was able to transition into talkies successfully. Baxter became a well-known star after the film In Old Arizona. In it he used his smoldering glances and a heavy Mexican accent to charm audiences and critics alike. Baxter reprised the same role in the films The Cisco Kid (1931) and Return of the Cisco Kid (1939).

In the 1930s Baxter starred opposite several leading ladies, including Carole Lombard in the western The Arizona Kid (1930) and Loretta Young in the comedies Wife, Doctor and Nurse (1937) and Wife, Husband and Friend (1939). He was also successfully paired numerous times with Myrna Loy in films such as Penthouse (1933), Broadway Bill (1934), and To Mary—with Love (1936) and with Janet Gaynor—the winner of the first Oscar for best actress—in films such as Daddy Long Legs (1931) and Paddy the Next Big Thing (1933).
