        "text": "Thanks to the magic of DALL‑E artificial intelligence (now in its third generation as DALL‑E 3), Microsoft Designer now lets anyone generate totally unique images that have never been seen before, simply by writing a clear AI image prompt—just type what you want to see!\n\nLike any new technology, DALL‑E makes all kinds of exciting new things possible, but it also takes a little bit of experimentation to get the best results.\n\nNote: These tips for creating AI-generated art apply to both Microsoft Designer and the DALL‑E site. The benefit of using Designer is that it is also a graphic design app, so you’ll not only get unique images generated from the ideas you type, but you also can add more design elements like text or graphics and AI-powered editing experiences that will perfectly integrate it all into a design. We even have a treasure trove of Microsoft Designer templates, Pinterest templates, and other social media templates to get you started.\n\nHow to create an image with DALL‑E and Microsoft Designer\n\nUsing DALL‑E to generate images may seem deceptively simple. It's actually just simple—no deception detected. Here's how to get started:\n\nOption A: Generate a complete design\n\nThis option lets you create a complete AI-generated design, not just an image—so you'll also be including details like your intended design's format (example: A Facebook post) and purpose (Example: Advertise a sale on lighting fixtures).\n\n1. Go to Microsoft Designer.\n\n2. In the text box labeled \"Describe the design you want to create,\" enter a phrase that describes the design you want to create. Hit try for free, then pick the design that matches your vision most closely—you can edit your work from here. If you're not satisfied with any of the design options, return to the previous screen and refine your prompt.\n\nOption B: Generate a stand-alone image\n\nThis is the option we'll be focusing on today: Generating unique, high-quality DALL-E images. To do this from Designer:\n\n1. Navigate directly to Microsoft Designer's image creator.\n\n2. Designer's image generator defaults to a prompt box you can fill in to have Designer create the prompt for you. Use this option if you're coming up short on prompt ideas!\n\nIf you'd rather write your prompt from scratch, select Edit entire prompt on the bottom of the prompt box. From there, you can delete the default prompt and add your own.\n\nWhat kind of images can you generate? Anything!\n\nDALL-E's image capabilities range from simple icons and patterns to illustrations, artwork, and even photorealistic images and depictions of 3D objects.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, let's imagine we're generating materials to promote our running club.\n\nLet's type in \"an adorable character running, ink-and-watercolor illustration, colorful background\" and see what we get:\n\nNot bad for our first try, right?\n\nNote: All of the prompts we share today will be linked to the same prompt within Designer's image creator. Follow the link to try the prompt for yourself and see what your results look like!\n\nHow to write the most effective AI image prompt for DALL‑E\n\nSince you get out of it what you put into it, how do you write a good prompt for DALL‑E? In short, it's best to imagine your image already exists in some kind of online gallery, and then write the kind of short caption you might imagine appearing with it.\n\nBe specific\n\nIf you enter just a single word—like \"runner,\" for example—you could end up with anything from a photo of an elite athlete winning a marathon to a cute pencil sketch of a child running through a meadow—or, as you see in the example above, even a made-up creature! Rather than using a single word, use a phrase to describe what you're looking for. Here are a few suggestions for additional details to include in your search phrases:\n\nA few specific details about the object or character\n\nInfo about the setting or background to use for the image\n\nThe medium style in which it's depicted, such as oil painting, digital photo, or even marble statue\n\nOther adjectives, such as \"colorful,\" \"swirling,\" \"playful,\" \"happy,\" \"minimalist,\" \"geometric,\" \"vibrant,\" \"dramatic,\" \"ornate,\" \"austere,\" etc.—anything that could help build your desired aesthetic\n\nAdd directive details\n\nRather than just specifying the medium style as \"oil painting,\" you could describe it as \"oil-on-canvas, masterpiece by Caravaggio, from 1599.\" Or rather than \"photograph,\" you could request \"HD photograph, digital camera, studio lighting, large-format portrait on film.\"\n\nIncluding these extra details in your image prompts help the AI technology hone in on the type of image you mean, even if it doesn't always get it exactly right.\n\nAvoid these pitfalls\n\nThere are a few limits to AI generation, so some types of image prompts are less likely to achieve the desired effect. A few things to avoid in descriptions are:\n\nComplex scenes with multiple subjects\n\nDetailed layout requests (for example, \"A big red Object X on the left, friendly Object Y on the right, a small Object Z wearing Item A above them\")\n\nImages with multiple faces (these are often distorted)\n\nRequests for text (for example, \"a sign saying 'Happy birthday!'\"), because the generator doesn't know how to spell!\n\nWhy use AI to generate an image?\n\nWith so many existing images available, why try generating your own image using DALL‑E?\n\nTo create an original image\n\nYou're guaranteed an image that's never been seen or used before—the chance to show something truly unique to you or your brand!\n\nTo let your imagination run wild\n\nCombine all kinds of subjects, settings, and art styles, and you can create some wild and wonderful combinations to catch your audience's eye. Koala bear detective? Marble sculpture of a cartoon character? Anything is possible!\n\nTo depict imaginary people\n\nBy generating images you can include humans in your creative pieces without them needing to be real. No need to find models—or to get people to sign release forms!\n\nTo develop a signature look\n\nBy reusing the same style keywords while changing subjects, you can create multiple images over time that all look related, creating an interesting and consistent look for your brand.\n\nGenerating different image styles with AI image prompts\n\nWhen it comes to generating images, knowledge about how to describe things is power—to ask for something, you need to be able to describe it!\n\nDiscovering the names of interesting art styles is important and it can be part of the fun. Because AI generation tools are trained on real images, there's no need to use a convoluted description—just phrase things normally. Pull words and phrases from online research sources, gallery websites, and even art textbooks. The sky's the limit.\n\nTo whet your appetite, let's look at a whole range of examples for our imaginary running club.\n\nTry different art medium styles\n\nFrom watercolors to airbrushes, there are a lot of different ways to make marks on paper. Indicate the art medium style or method in your image prompts for unique results.\n\nThe four images above were generated with these prompts:\n\nPro tip:\n\nTry these words and phrases for different art styles: \"stencil art,\" \"crayon,\" \"chalk,\" \"etching,\" \"oil paintings,\" \"ballpoint pen,\" \"colored pencil,\" \"Chinese watercolor,\" \"pastels,\" \"woodcut,\" \"charcoal,\" \"screen print,\" \"photocollage,\" \"storybook illustration,\" \"newspaper cartoon,\" \"vintage illustration from [decade].\"\n\nGet a decidedly digital look\n\nFor a more contemporary feel, you can generate illustrations with a more digital look.\n\nThe four images above were generated with these prompts:\n\nPro tip:\n\nTry these phrases for different digital styles: \"digital art,\" \"vector graphics,\" \"minimalist,\" \"geometric,\" \"isometric,\" \"2.5D,\" \"matte clay,\" \"digital painting,\" \"screenshot from [a favorite game or animation],\" \"diagram,\" \"instruction manual.\"\n\nMake it retro—and make it arty!\n\nYou can call upon the whole of art history to get the style you're after! Try generating anything from ancient cave paintings to 20th-century modern art and give your piece a vintage twist.\n\nYour description might include years, art movements, media, or famous artists. And while you're at it, you can try describing it as a \"masterpiece,\" \"masterwork,\" or \"outstanding example of…\"—it never hurts to ask, after all.\n\nThe four images above were generated with these prompts:\n\nPro tip:\n\nOther art styles to try: \"surrealism,\" \"Dadaism,\" \"metaphysical painting,\" \"orphism,\" \"cubism,\" \"suprematism,\" \"De Stijl,\" \"futurism,\" \"expressionism,\" \"realism,\" \"Bauhaus,\" \"color field painting,\" \"impressionism,\" \"baroque,\" \"rococo,\" \"mannerism,\" \"ancient Egyptian papyrus,\" \"ancient Roman mosaic.\"\n\nGenerate some faux-tography\n\nFor a more realistic-looking image, you could describe a photograph.\n\nThis time, your description might include references to elements such as lighting, time of day, angle, and distance (for example, \"close-up,\" \"low camera angle\") or technical elements such as camera type, lens, and so on. For example, a photo taken by a DSLR, 35mm lens will look different from a flash photo from a disposable camera.\n\nThe four images above were generated with these prompts:\n\nPro tip:\n\nOther photography-related terms to play with: \"trail cam,\" \"CCTV,\" \"VHS,\" \"infrared photography,\" \"daguerreotype,\" \"cyanotype,\" \"photo from [a favorite magazine or website],\" \"film still from [a favorite movie or TV show],\" \"color splash,\" \"extreme close-up,\" \"wide-angle lens,\" \"telephoto lens,\" \"light leaks,\" \"autochrome,\" \"camera phone,\" \"camera obscura,\" \"warm lighting,\" \"long exposure,\" \"fast shutter speed,\" \"back lighting,\" \"low-key lighting,\" \"golden hour,\" \"blue hour,\" \"macro lens,\" \"motion blur,\" \"shallow depth-of-field,\" \"action photography,\" \"candid portrait.\"\n\nMake an object\n\nAlthough the images are 2D, you can of course describe a 3D artwork and generate images of that! When crafting your image prompt, it might be helpful to think of the object as it would appear in a photograph so, again, you can reference lighting, backgrounds, lenses and so on, to achieve the effect you want.\n\nPro tip:\n\nOther materials you might try: \"felt,\" \"tapestry,\" \"knitting,\" \"embroidery,\" \"papercraft,\" \"origami,\" \"pop-up books,\" \"modelling clay,\" \"porcelain,\" \"ceramics,\" \"terracotta,\" \"metalwork,\" \"jewelry,\" \"crystal,\" \"fiberglass\"…even \"butter.\"\n\nWrite an AI image prompt and let's go!\n\nAs you explore further, you might find yourself looking up famous art movements on Wikipedia, learning more about film stock or investigating architectural glossaries to create ever-more inventive descriptions.\n\nI can't wait to see what you come up with—give it a try today!\n\nLearn more"
