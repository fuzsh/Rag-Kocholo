        "text": "The City of Azle, in partnership with Community Waste Disposal (CWD), conducts two FREE city-wide clean-ups - one in the spring and one in the fall. Residents can drop off brush, furniture, bulky items, appliances, metal for recycling and small amounts of construction materials from do-it-yourself projects.\n\nCWD will be on site to collect Household Hazardous Waste (paints, chemicals, cleaners, used motor oil and batteries), E*waste (computers, printers, electronic devices, old television sets), used tires and a document shredder will be on site.\n\nWe ask that you pre-sort as much as possible; this will help keep traffic moving and allow staff to work as efficiently as possible. This is a free event for Azle residents and proof of Azle residency will be required by presenting your City of Azle water bill (which must show charge for garbage service) and drivers license.\n\nItems Not Accepted: Ammunition, asbestos, building materials, butane cylinders, explosives, medical waste, PCBs, propane cylinders, radioactive material, smoke detectors.\n\nIndividuals that appear to be delivering these items from a business, whether run out of a residence or not, will be rejected or charged a separate special handling fee. City and/or Contractor may reject unusual volumes of hazardous waste, electronics, household metal appliances, automotive tires or documents for shredding. Unusual Volume will be determined by:\n\nAny one material where the accumulated weight exceeds 500 pounds.\n\nAny one material where the accumulated volumes exceed 1 cubic yard.\n\nAny multiple items that accumulated volume exceed 4 cubic yards.\n\nIf you have questions, please contact Jimmy Duvall, Storm Water Manager, at 817-444-4511, or CWD at 972-392-9300/Option 2."
