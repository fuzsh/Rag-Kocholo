        "text": "AMARILLO, Texas (KFDA) - Extreme heat is not just an inconvenience, it’s a silent threat to one’s well-being and amplifies existing mental health conditions.\n\nAccording to the Amarillo Police Department, May and July had the highest domestic violence calls compared to January and April of this year.\n\n“Extreme heat can affect mental health pretty big; it increases domestic violence risk, it increases the risk of suicide, the biochemistry which is often with people with mental illness, are more susceptible to the heat increases that we see,” said Dr. James Rush, psychiatrist.\n\nExperts say those with pre-existing mental health conditions like anxiety, depression and bipolar disorder may experience worsening symptoms.\n\n“People with mental illness do not tolerate heat as well as others because of the chemistry of their illness. Patients with psychiatric disorders are also increase risk of heat illness and mortality for medications that prevent an optimal response psychological heat stress,” said Dr. Rush.\n\nThe discomfort and physiological stress caused by high temperatures can lead to irritability and aggression.\n\n“When you have a house full of people, lets say for example don’t have the ability to have air conditioning, that can kind of create some tension in the home. People tend to be a little bit more tense, irritable, less patient; it’s kind of like when you don’t feel well, you’re not at your best and you’re not calm and you’re not trying to do things that you know should be,” said Bobbi Britto, clinical director of mental health service at The Bridge Children’s Advocacy Center.\n\nHeatwaves can lead to social isolation as individuals avoid outdoor activities that can further contribute to feelings of loneliness and depression.\n\nExperts say a few coping mechanisms to follow indoors are maintain a routine, hydrate, stay connected, and engage in relaxation techniques."
