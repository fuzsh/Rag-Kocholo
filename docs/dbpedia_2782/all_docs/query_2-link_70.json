        "text": "Know that you’re not alone. More than one in ten high school students have already experienced physical aggression from a dating partner, and many were unequipped to respond after it happened. If you’re in a similar situation, the most important thing to remember is that your partner’s abusive behavior is wrong — you are deserving of a healthy, loving, and respectful relationship.\n\nCommit yourself to not making excuses for your partner’s abusive behavior and chat with us now for help creating a safety plan to fit your situation. Steps to consider next include:\n\nTalk to a trusted friend, family member, or mentor.\n\nCreate a safety plan.\n\nObtain a restraining order.\n\nContact love is respect.\n\nRemember: unhealthy or abusive relationships usually get worse. It’s important to assess your abusive partner’s level and use of force to determine the urgency of your situation and what kind of support you need to get safer.\n\nEmotional abuse may not always cause visible harm, but it does cause emotional pain and scarring and may lead to physical violence eventually. Constantly being criticized, told you aren’t good enough, or made to question your grasp on reality can cause you to lose confidence in yourself and lower your self-esteem. As a result, you may start to blame yourself for your partner’s abusive behavior — resist this impulse.\n\nRemember: emotional abuse is never, ever your fault. Talk to someone you trust like a close friend, family member, or mentor, and make a plan for your safety.\n\nContact us 24/7 via text, phone, or live chat for personalized support to help you deal with emotional abuse.\n\nIt can also refer to behavior that impacts a person’s ability to control their sexual activity or the circumstances in which sexual activity takes place, including oral sex, rape, or controlling reproductive methods and choices.\n\nEveryone has the right to decide what they do or don’t want to do sexually, and not all sexual assaults are violent “attacks.” Most victims of sexual assault know their assailant, and people of all genders and sexualities can be victims or perpetrators of sexual abuse. That includes people who are married, dating, in a “friends with benefits” arrangement, or just acquaintances.\n\nExamples of sexual abuse include:\n\nUnwanted kissing or touching.\n\nUnwanted rough or violent sexual activity.\n\nRefusing to use condoms or restricting someone’s access to birth control.\n\nPreventing someone from using protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\n\nSexual contact with someone intoxicated from drugs or alcohol, unconscious, asleep, or otherwise unable to give clear and informed consent.\n\nThreatening, pressuring, or otherwise forcing someone to have sex or perform sexual acts.\n\nUsing sexual insults toward someone.\n\nSexual abuse is never the victim’s fault. Just because someone “didn’t say no” or doesn’t resist unwanted sexual advances doesn’t mean that they consent. Physical resistance can sometimes put victims at higher risk for further abuse, and the narrative that a lack of resistance equals consent makes it more difficult for survivors to report abuse. It’s up to each of us to understand consent and to communicate and respect the boundaries of our intimate partners, without exception.\n\nYour safety should always be your first priority. Try to get to a safe place away from your attacker where you can think through your next steps. You may be scared, angry, confused, and hurt — remember that the abuse was not your fault.\n\nSteps to consider next:\n\nContact someone you trust. You may be in shock after having been sexually assaulted, and you will almost certainly feel a mix of complex emotions. Having someone there to support you can help you express and process these feelings in a way that doesn’t threaten your safety, and can give you room to focus on your healing while they help with everything else. It’s often useful to speak with a counselor, sexual assault hotline, or support group if you don’t feel comfortable reaching out to a friend or family member.\n\nGo to an emergency room or health clinic. It’s extremely important for you to seek health care as soon as you can after being assaulted. You can expect to be treated for any injuries, offered medications to help prevent pregnancy and/or STIs, and have tests run to ensure your long term wellbeing. There may also be sexual assault advocates in the area who can assist you and answer any questions. A Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) can provide these services and collect evidence in case you decide to pursue legal action in the future.\n\nReport what happened. If you determine that it’s safe for you to do so, you may report what happened to law enforcement to pursue criminal legal recourse against your attacker. If you decide to do so, it’s important that you do your best to avoid altering or destroying any evidence of the attack to prepare a stronger legal case. That means don’t shower, wash your hair or body, comb your hair, or change your clothes, even if it’s hard not to. If you’re nervous about going to the police station, it may help to bring a trusted friend with you, keeping in mind any relevant safety considerations for them as well.\n\nRemember: you always have options. Chat with us now to learn more about sexual abuse or to find available resources in your area.\n\nFinancial abuse is usually coupled with emotional or physical abuse. If you’re not in control of your finances or if your partner has taken money from your bank account, it can be especially scary to leave an abusive relationship. Chat with us now to get support and identify local resources to help you regain control over your finances — some organizations may even provide short term loans to cover important expenses while leaving an abusive relationship.\n\nYou can also consider talking to a trusted friend, family member, or legal professional about getting a protection order. No matter what you decide to do, consider making a safety plan that includes setting aside funds in a separate, private location.\n\nIf you’re being stalked, you’re likely going through a lot of stress, vulnerability, anxiety, and other emotions you may not be able to express right now, which in turn may be affecting your sleep or concentration at work or school. Every year, 3.4 million people in the US experience stalking — youth between the ages of 18 and 24 experience the highest rates.\n\nMost people assume that stalkers are strangers, but in reality, three out of four victims of stalking are harassed by someone they know. If you think you may be in danger, contact an emergency service provider to help you reach a safer place, and consider obtaining a protection order to prevent your stalker from coming near you. Understand the risks of contacting law enforcement for your own safety and others, including that the person harassing you may ultimately be arrested and convicted within the criminal legal system.\n\nRegardless of whether you intend to pursue legal action against your stalker, it’s important to save evidence of the abuse for proof in the future if you ever need it. Take time to write down the dates, times, and places of each incident that occurred, including names and contact information for people who may have witnessed what happened. Examples of such evidence include:\n\nText messages\n\nVoicemails.\n\nPictures or videos\n\nLetters, photographs, or cards\n\nUnwanted items or gifts\n\nSocial media harassment (including inappropriate friend or follow requests)\n\nStalking is a traumatic experience. You may lose sleep, feel depressed, have nightmares, or feel like you don’t have control over your life because of your experience. These reactions are normal and you should be forgiving of yourself as you heal. It can help to tell a trusted friend or loved one about your experience and work to develop a safety plan."
