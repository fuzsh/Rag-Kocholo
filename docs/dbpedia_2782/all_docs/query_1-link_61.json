To make a shot list, a filmmaker or video creative must know the classic types of shots based on attributes like shot size, shot framing, camera movement, camera mechanisms, and depth of field.\n\nWe’ll break down all the camera shots and angles you need to know for your next film. We also include camera shot examples from famous movies to help solidify the discussed concepts.\n\nThe Ultimate Guide to Shot Sizes\n\nSubscribe for more filmmaking videos like this.\n\n1\n\nCamera ShotS\n\nTHE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CAMERA SHOTS\n\nCamera Shot DEFINITION\n\nWhat is a camera shot?\n\nA camera shot is composed of the series of frames that are shot uninterrupted from the moment the camera starts rolling until it stops. Camera shots are an essential aspect of filmmaking and video productions, because by combining different types of shots, angles and camera movements, the filmmakers are able to emphasize specific emotions, ideas and movement for each scene.\n\nTypes of Camera Shots — The Shot Size\n\nCamera Shot Size Overview\n\nBelow you'll find a shot size cheatsheet to see exactly how different shot sizes will look on screen, and how to differentiate the various shot sizes:\n\nTypes of camera shots by size\n\nAt the bottom of this section we provide a link to a PDF shot list that has examples of each shot sized used in popular films and television shows.\n\nOkay, onto shot sizes! This video breaks down the essential shot sizes — from establishing shots all the way to extreme close-ups.\n\nShot Sizes Explained • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nTypes of Shots By Size\n\nExtreme Long Shot (ELS) or Extreme Wide Shot (EWS)\n\nAn extreme long shot (or extreme wide shot) make your subject appear small against their location. You can use an extreme long shot to make your subject feel distant or unfamiliar.\n\nTake a look at this extreme wide shot from one of the best action movies Mad Max: Fury Road:\n\n(EWS) Extreme Wide Shot Example in Mad Max: Fury Road\n\nIt can also make your subject feel overwhelmed by its location. Of all the various camera shots out there, consider using the extreme long shot when you need to emphasize the location or isolation.\n\nTypes of Shot sizes\n\nLong Shot (LS) or Wide Shot (WS)\n\nThe long shot (also known as a wide shot, abbreviated “WS”) is the same idea, but a bit closer. If your subject is a person then his or her whole body will be in view — but not filling the shot. Here's an example of the wide shot size from one of the best 2015 movies The Martian:\n\n(WS) Wide Shot Example in The Martian\n\nIn other words, there should be a good deal of space above and below your subject. Use a long shot (or wide shot) to keep your subject in plain view amidst grander surroundings.\n\nThe wide shot also lets us see the beautiful background imagery, as well as the onlookers which will make any big moment more cinematic.\n\nOf the many camera shots, a long shot gives us a better idea of the scene setting, and gives us a better idea of how the character fits into the area.\n\nTypes of Camera SHOTS\n\nFull Shot (FS)\n\nNow let's talk about camera shots that let your subject fill the frame while keeping emphasis on scenery.\n\n(FS) Full Shot Example in Django Unchained\n\nThis full shot from one of the best Quentin Tarantino movies Django Unchained is also a tracking shot — meaning there is camera movement featured throughout the shot. In this particular case, the camera slowly moves (or tracks) towards Django. So, technically, this shot begins in a wide shot, moves to full shot (seen above), and eventually ends in a cowboy shot.\n\nOf all the different types of camera shots in film, full shots can be used to feature multiple characters in a single shot, like this full shot size example from Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy:\n\n(FS) Full Shot Example in Guardians of the Galaxy\n\nTypes of Camera Shot Sizes\n\nMedium Wide Shot (MWS)\n\nA medium long shot (aka medium long shot) frames the subject from roughly the knees up. It splits the difference between a full shot and a medium shot. Here's an example of the medium wide shot size from one of the best crime movies, The Usual Suspects:\n\n(MWS) Medium Wide Camera Shot Example in The Usual Suspects\n\nYou can always frame camera shots from any angle as well, so don't be afraid to think about medium long shots when behind a character.\n\nTypes of Camera Shots\n\nCowboy Shot (CS)\n\nA variation on this is the Cowboy Shot, which frames the subject from roughly mid-thighs up. It’s called a “cowboy shot” because it is used in Westerns to frame a gunslinger’s gun or holster on his hip. Here's an example of the cowboy shot size from one of the best movies of 2017 Wonder Woman:\n\n(CS) Cowboy Shot Camera Shot in Wonder Woman\n\nHere is an example of a cowboy shot that's used in a film that has nothing to do with cowboys, and it's also a \"three shot\":\n\n(CS) Cowboy Shot Example in The King’s Speech\n\nTYPES OF SHOTS By Shot Size\n\nMedium Shot (MS)\n\nLet's move onto camera shots that reveal your subject in more detail.\n\nThe medium shot is one of the most common camera shots. It's similar to the cowboy shot above, but frames from roughly the waist up and through the torso. So it emphasizes more of your subject while keeping their surroundings visible. Here's an example of the medium shot size from one of the best superhero movies X-Men: Days of the Future Past:\n\n(MS) Medium Shot Example in X-Men: Days of Future Past\n\nMedium shots may seem like the most standard camera shot around, but every shot size you choose will have an effect on the viewer. A medium shot can often be used as a buffer shot for dialogue scenes that have an important moment later that will be shown in a close-up shot.\n\nIf you don't use all of the different types of camera shots in film, how can you signal anything to your viewer without shot size contrast.\n\nTYPES OF CAMERA SHOTS\n\nMedium Close Up Shot (MCU)\n\nThe medium close-up frames your subject from roughly the chest up. So it typically favors the face, but still keeps the subject somewhat distant.\n\nHere's an example of the medium close-up shot size from one of the Coen Brothers’ masterpieces No Country for Old Men:\n\n(MCU) Medium Close Up Shot Example in No Country for Old Men\n\nThe medium close-up camera shot size keeps the characters eerily distant even during their face-to-face conversation.\n\nTYPES OF CAMERA SHOTS\n\nClose Up (CU)\n\nYou know it’s time for a close-up shot when you want to reveal a subject’s emotions and reactions. The close-up camera shot fills your frame with a part of your subject. If your subject is a person, it is often their face. Here's an example of the close-up shot size:\n\n(CU) Close-Up Shot Example in The Usual Suspects\n\nOf all the different types of camera shot sizes in film, a close-up is perfect for important moments. The close-up shot size is near enough to register tiny emotions, but not so close that we lose visibility.\n\nTYPES OF Camera SHOT Sizes\n\nExtreme Close Up (ECU)\n\nAn extreme close-up is the most you can fill a frame with your subject. It often shows eyes, mouth and gun triggers. In extreme close-up shots, smaller objects get great detail and are the focal point.\n\nUse an ECU to emphasize a specific feature of your subject:\n\n(ECU) Extreme Close-Up Camera Shot Example in X-Men: First Class\n\nVisionary filmmaker, Darren Aronofsky uses various degrees of close-ups in his work, like in one of his best films Black Swan. In this extreme close-up, we see that her transformation happens quite literally. Aronofsky uses the extreme close up shot size to show feathers growing in Nina’s back.\n\n(ECU) Extreme Close-Up Example in Black Swan\n\nExtreme close-ups can be used in many different film genres, which includes comedy as well. Here's an ECU example:\n\nType of camera shots example: (ECU) Extreme Close Up in Little Miss Sunshine\n\nEstablishing Shots\n\nIt all starts with an establishing shot\n\nAn establishing shot is a shot at the head of a scene that clearly shows us the location of the action. This shot often follows an aerial shot and is used to show where everything will happen.\n\nConsider the following examples:\n\nType of camera shots: Shooting Great Establishing Shots • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nWe cover a lot of shot specs in this post, but don't worry. You don't need to memorize everything in this post. If you use StudioBinder when shot listing, all these specs are listed as checkboxes for easy selection.\n\nThis allows you to focus on creativity rather than spending effort attempting to recall shot jargon or retyping acronyms 5000 times.\n\nTypes of Camera Shots — The Shot Size\n\nCamera Shot Size Summary\n\nHow you choose to frame your subject will have a specific impact. How close or far your subject is to your camera — your shot size — will underscore how the audience should feel about it (or them).\n\nYour subject will appear smallest in a long shot (or wide shot). They will be larger in a medium shot and largest in a close-up shot.\n\nHere is a shot list with every shot size organized from wide to near:\n\nTypes of Camera Shot Sizes • Shot Listed in StudioBinder\n\nYou can create a PDF of this shot list to print or store digitally.\n\nThink about familiarity when you consider your subject’s size in your camera shots. It’s like meeting someone for the first time. You might shake hands or talk about the weather, but odds are you’ll stay at a relative distance. That’s because you haven’t built any familiarity yet.\n\nShot size is the building block for choosing camera shots, but you’ll also need to consider how framing, focus and movement can add deeper meaning to your shots. Read on to explore creative shot combinations.\n\nSpecific camera movements matter too. Are you going to rack focus while completing a dolly move? Or maybe it’s just a traditional two shot on sticks? You want to capture all these details when shot listing.\n\n2\n\nCamera Framing\n\nWORKING WITH SUBJECTS IN THE FRAME\n\nFor filmmakers and videographers, a major consideration for framing is the number of subjects you feature in your shots, and their physical relationship to each other and the camera.\n\nCamera shot Framing DEFINITION\n\nWhat is camera shot framing?\n\nCamera shot framing is the art and science of placing subjects in your shots. Camera shots are all about composition. Rather than pointing the camera at the subject, you need to compose an image.\n\nBased on how you plan to position your subjects, you'll need to adjust your camerawork. You'll want to capture your framing details on a shot list well before you arrive on set. That way you have a clear idea for the scene and can communicate your vision with ease.\n\nThat's not to say that things may not change the day of the shoot. But, having a shot list at the ready showcases that the director and DP have done their homework and are well prepared.\n\nThis video is a quick rundown of all the types of shot framing, how they work, and when you might consider using them in your next project.\n\nUltimate Guide to Shot Framing • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nHere is a shot list showcasing all the types of shot framing that you can download and use as a reference the next time you sit down to shot list:\n\nTypes of Camera Shot Framing • Shot Listed in StudioBinder\n\nTypes of camera shot framing in film\n\nSingle Shot\n\nWhen your shot captures one subject it’s known as a single shot:\n\nType of camera shots example: Single Shot in Iron Man\n\nSingle shots can be set and framed in any shot size you like, just as long as there is only one character featured within the frame.\n\nNow, why did I say featured rather than simply in the frame?\n\nThe reason is because you can have an over-the-shoulder single, also known as a \"dirty single\" that technically has more than one person in the frame, but the character in the foreground isn't featured:\n\nType of camera shots example: Over-The-Shoulder Shot in Armageddon\n\nTypes of Framing\n\nTwo Shot or 2-Shot\n\nA two-shot is a camera shot with two characters featured in the frame:\n\nType of shot example: 2-Shot in The Matrix Reloaded\n\nTwo shots are often really useful for allowing performances to play out in a single take, which can be especially useful for comedy.\n\nCamera Shot Framing In movies\n\nThree Shot or 3-Shot\n\nA three-shot features three characters in the frame:\n\nType of shot example: 3-Shot in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1\n\nThree shots are really important in adventure films, or really any film that has a group of characters, because it is an enormous time drain to shoot 3 singles just to show every character, not to mention jarring.\n\nTypes of camera shot framing\n\nOver-The-Shoulder Shot (OTS)\n\nAnother element of camera shots to consider is the perspective of the shot. An over-the-shoulder shot shows your subject from behind the shoulder of another character. Because it emulates perspective, it’s common in conversation scenes.\n\n(OTS) Over-The-Shoulder Shot Example in Westworld\n\nOver-the-shoulder shots can help to provide orientation, and connect the characters on an emotional level. Here's our breakdown of the Westworld scene and how OTS shots work so effortlessly.\n\nThe Over The Shoulder Shot Example in Film • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nTypes of Shots By Framing\n\nOver-The-Hip Shot (OTH)\n\nAn over-the-hip shot is similar to over-the-shoulder in that the camera is placed with a character's hip in the foreground, and the focus subject in the plane of acceptable focus.\n\nHere's an example of an over-the-hip shot from one of the best Steven Spielberg movies Minority Report:\n\nOver-The-Hip Shot Example in Film: Minority Report\n\nYou'll gain a similar effect from an over-the-hip shot as you would an OTS, but if you have one character standing, and the other sitting, kneeling, or any other configuration that places the subjects on \"uneven terrain\" it will often suggest a power imbalance. This is the benefit of blocking and staging your actors and camera.\n\nTypes of Camera Framing\n\nPoint of View Shot (POV)\n\nNow let's talk about choosing camera shots that show the point-of-view (or POV) of one of your characters.\n\nA POV shot is a camera shot that shows the viewer exactly what that character sees. This transports the audience into that character and there is no more literal example of this than Being John Malkovich:\n\nPoint of View Shot Example in Being John Malkovich\n\nPOV shots can also invoke horror, as seen in one of the best horror movies Halloween but that's just the beginning. In this video, watch how many ways in various genres the point of view shot can be used.\n\nType of shot example: POV shot • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nA point of view shot (POV) is generally sandwiched between two other shots, a technique called shot-reverse shot:\n\nA camera shot of a character looking at something\n\nCut to your (POV) point of view camera shot\n\nA camera shot showing the character's reaction\n\nA point of view shot shows us exactly what the character sees, and we get to understand what's generating the character's reaction.\n\n3\n\nCamera Focus\n\nTHE VIEWER'S POINT OF ATTENTION\n\nCinema and television give the director an uncanny ability to control the audience's vision. You can shift and change points of view as people learn new information, move locations, or switch perspectives.\n\nDepth of field DEFINITION\n\nWhat is depth of field?\n\nDepth of field (DOF) is the term used to describe the size of the area in your image where objects appear acceptably sharp. The area in question is known as the field, and the size (in z-space) of that area is the depth of that field.\n\nThe center most point of the field is known as the point of focus. The imaginary two dimensional plane that extends from that point is known as the plane of focus. And any part of your image that falls directly on this plane is officially in focus.\n\nThere are various types of camera focus to choose from, each with their own unique storytelling properties. Here's a video breakdown of each type with examples of how they enhance the visual storytelling.\n\nUltimate Guide to Camera Focus • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nHere is a shot list with all the types of camera shot focus:\n\nTypes of Camera Focus in Film • Shot Listed in StudioBinder\n\nPlan focus changes on your shot list\n\nFilmmakers often want to direct attention around different parts of the scene. To do this, you need to decide on the angle of shot, camera movements, and any special equipment needed to pull it off.\n\nCamera Shots Focus Types\n\nRack Focus vs. Focus Pull\n\nManipulating focus is another way of communicating with your camera shots. The vast majority of films you watch will keep their subjects in focus 95% of the time, with the odd slip up here and there.\n\nThe first assistant cameraman (or “First AC”) will pull focus to make sure that the subject stays within the acceptable focus range while they move to various depths within the frame.\n\nA rack focus is an emphasized focus pull, where the acceptable focus range is intentionally shifted from one subject to another. This is an aggressive use of focus as a story telling device:\n\nFilm Shot Types: The art of the rack focus • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nFocus Pull = Passive vs. Rack Focus = Aggressive\n\nNow, this doesn't mean that pulling focus is easy, and in fact it is much harder to maintain focus by making micro adjustments vs setting up a rack focus on a set mark. It's just a matter of the viewer taking notice.\n\nTypes of Camera Shot Focus\n\nShallow Focus Shot (Shallow DOF)\n\nIn shallow focus shots, your subject is in crisp focus while the foreground and background scenery is out of focus. This limits your depth of field to create emphasis on your subject.\n\nHere's another shallow focus shot example:\n\nFilm Shot Types: Shallow Focus Shot Example in The Night Of\n\nTypes of Camera Shot Focus\n\nDeep Focus Shot\n\nIn a deep focus shot, everything in your frame is in focus. This is when you need your audience to feel the scenery or particular scene elements.\n\nFilm Shot Types: Deep Focus Shot Example in 12 Angry Men\n\nHere's another deep focus shot example:\n\nFilm Shot Types: Deep focus staging shows two forces collide in Detroit\n\nTypes of camera shots By Focus\n\nTilt-Shift Shot\n\nA tilt-shift lens rotates perspective within the lens and emulates selective focus. It can make parts of your image appear in sharp focus while others are out of focus.\n\nFilm Shots Example: A tilt-shift lens captures a trippy bar mitzvah in A Serious Man\n\nHere's another tilt-shift shot example from The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford:\n\nFilm Shots Example: A tilt-shift lens creates dreamy distortion\n\nTypes of Camera Focus\n\nSoft focus\n\nWhereas deep focus keeps everything in focus, and shallow focus keeps something in focus, soft focus shots keep nothing in 100% sharp focus. This is caused by either a flaw in the lens itself or through special filters.\n\nThat Soft Focus Glow in Brian De Palma's Carrie\n\nSoft focus is perfect when filming a dream or memory — the glow around everything is both wistful and slightly unreal.\n\nTwo Planes of Camera Focus\n\nSplit Diopter\n\nA split diopter is an additional lens element that allows for two simultaneous focal lengths. In other words, you can achieve shallow focus in the foreground AND in the background, while the middle ground remains out of focus.\n\nSplit Diopter Shot in Jaws\n\nThis is a highly stylized shot and tends to draw attention to itself because it is \"unnatural.\" The human eye can see in deep or shallow focus but not both at the same time, which is why this type of camera shot should used with caution.\n\n4\n\nCamera Angles\n\nADJUSTING CAMERA HEIGHT FOR IMPACT\n\nIt's not enough to just understand shot size. Camera angles, and degree of those angles, can totally change the meaning of a film shot.\n\nCamera Shot Angle DEFINITION\n\nWhat is camera shot angle?\n\nThe camera shot angle is used to specify the location where the camera is placed to take a shot. The position of the camera in relation to the subjects can affect the way the viewer perceives the scene. A scene may be shot simultaneously from multiple camera angles to amplify the cinematic effect and the emotions.\n\nThere are many camera angles at a filmmaker's disposal and can even be combined for additional effect. Here's a rundown of every camera angle, how they work, and whey they might work best in your next shot list.\n\nUltimate Guide to Camera Angles • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nFor a downloadable \"cheatsheet,\" here is a shot list with the different types of camera shot angles:\n\nTypes of Camera Shot Angles Examples • Shot Listed in StudioBinder\n\nIn this section we'll cover all the different types of camera angles in film and provide you with plenty of camera angle examples:\n\nTYPES OF CAmera Angles\n\nEye Level Shot\n\nFirst, consider the most common height: the eye level shot. When your subject is at eye-level they’re in a neutral perspective (not superior or inferior). This mimics how we see people in real life -- our eye line connecting with theirs.\n\nTypes of Angles: Eye Level Shot Example in Forrest Gump\n\nHere's another eye level shot example from one of the best Tim Burton movies Alice in Wonderland:\n\nTypes of Camera Shot Angles: Eye Level Shot Example in Alice in Wonderland\n\nTYPES OF CAmera Angles\n\nLow Angle Shot\n\nA low angle shot frames the subject from a low camera height looking up at them. These camera shots most often emphasize power dynamics between characters.\n\nLow Angle Camera Shot Examples • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nA superior character with the upper hand is often framed from down low. This makes an inferior feel like they are looking up to them.\n\nTypes of Angles: Low Angle Shot Example in The Empire Strikes Back\n\nTYPES OF ANGLES: High Angle Shot Example\n\nHigh Angle Shot\n\nIn a high angle shot, the camera points down at your subject. It usually creates a feeling of inferiority, or “looking down” on your subject.\n\nBut, as the video below shows, there are creative expressions of this type of angle that can vary depending its context.\n\nTypes of Camera Angles: High Angle Shot Examples • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nHere's an example of a high angle shot from one of the best romantic movies The Princess Bride:\n\nFilm Shots Examples: High Angle Shot in The Princess Bride\n\nTypes of Camera Shot Angles\n\nHip Level Shot\n\nA hip level shot is when your camera is roughly waist-high.\n\nTypes of Camera Angles: Hip Level Shot Example in Reservoir Dogs\n\nHere's another hip level shot example from one of the best romantic comedies Punch-Drunk Love:\n\nTypes of Angles: Hip Level Shot Example in Punch-Drunk Love\n\nTYPES OF CAMERA ANGLES\n\nKnee Level Shot\n\nThis is when your camera height is about as low as your subject’s knees. They can emphasize a character’s superiority, if paired with a low angle.\n\nShot Types: Knee Level Shot in Home Alone\n\nHere's another knee level shot example:\n\nTypes of Camera Shot Angles: Knee Level Shot Example in Revenge of the Sith\n\nTYPES OF SHOT ANGLES in movies\n\nGround Level Shot\n\nA ground level shot is when your camera’s height is on ground level with your subject. Needless to say, this shot captures what’s going on the ground your subject stands on.\n\nTypes of Angles: Ground Level Shot Example in Star Wars VIII: The Last Jedi\n\nHere's another ground level shot example:\n\nShot Types: Ground Level Shot Example in Black Swan\n\nHere's another ground level shot example from one of many Stanley Kubrick's marvelous movies, Full Metal Jacket:\n\nTypes of Angles: Ground Level Shot Example in Full Metal Jacket\n\nTYPES OF CAMERA ANGLES in film\n\nShoulder Level Shot\n\nThis is when your camera is roughly as high as your subject’s shoulders. Shoulder level shots are actually much more standard than an eye level shot, which can make your actor seem shorter than reality:\n\nTypes of Camera Shot Angles: Shoulder Level Shot in Black Panther\n\nA shoulder level shot can maximize the feeling of superiority when paired with a low angle. Here's another shoulder level shot example:\n\nTypes of Camera Angles: Shoulder Level Shot Example in No Country For Old Men\n\ntypes of shots in film\n\nDutch Angle or Dutch Tilt Shot\n\nFor a dutch angle (dutch tilt), the camera is slanted to one side. With the horizon lines tilted in this way, you can create a sense of disorientation. This video breaks down a key moment in Mission: Impossible when Ethan first realizes that he's being set up.\n\nShot Types: Dutch Angle Example • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nCAMERA SHOTS ANGLE in film\n\nBird’s Eye View Shot or Overhead Shot\n\nAn overhead shot is from way up high, looking down on your subject and a good amount of the scenery surrounding him or her. This can create a great sense of scale and movement.\n\nA handy compilation of bird’s eye camera shots.\n\nHere's an overhead shot example:\n\nTypes of Angles: Overhead Shot Example in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\n\nCAMERA SHOTS By ANGLE\n\nAerial Shot\n\nWhether taken from a helicopter or drone, this is a shot from way up high. It establishes a large expanse of scenery. The opening shots of one of the best cyberpunk movies Blade Runner use them to establish futuristic cityscapes.\n\nTypes of Camera Shot Angles: Aerial Shot Example in Blade Runner\n\nAffordable drones have made aerial photography more accessible to filmmakers. Once considered a big-budget luxury or stock-footage mainstay, original aerial photography is now within reach of almost any production, all thanks to the \"rise\" of drones (and Sky-net).\n\n5\n\nCamera Movement\n\nMEANING THROUGH MOTION\n\nThe way a camera moves can give meaning to what's happening on screen. You can burst into a room, drone over from on high, pan with a head turn, and dolly-zoom for any revelation.\n\nCamera Movement DEFINITION\n\nWhat is camera movement?\n\nCamera movement is a powerful filmmaking tool employed to modify the relationship between the subject and the camera frame, with the goal of altering viewer's perspective of space and time for a more impactful and visceral visual storytelling.\n\nCamera moves set auteur directors out from the pack and wind up defining their visual style. But how can you plan all these camera movements so your story stays consistent from scene to scene?\n\nFimmaking Techniques: Camera Movement • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nTYPES OF SHOTS IN FILM\n\nStatic Shot or Fixed Shot\n\nWhen there’s no movement (i.e. locked camera aim) it’s called a static shot. These camera shots emphasize the appearance and movement of your subject against its environment, and are predominantly captured by being placed on a tripod or a dolly that remains static during the shot.\n\nStatic shots work well in every genre, but they're nice for comedy because the actor’s performance and dialogue is often the focus.\n\nStatic Shot Example in Step Brothers\n\nTYPES OF SHOTS MOVEMENT\n\nCamera Dolly Shot\n\nA dolly shot is where the camera is affixed to a mechanism called a dolly, which is a specialized push-cart built to handle heavy cinema cameras. A dolly will often have areas to attach seats for the camera operator and assistant camera operators to pull focus and control the camera.\n\nTypes of Shots in Film: Chapman Dolly UK\n\nCamera Zoom Example in movies\n\nZoom Lens Shot\n\nZoom shots are camera shots that change the focal length of the lens during the shot. This action can be a zoom out, or a zoom in, but they are different from a push in (or dolly in) because the camera is rarely changing positions, but simply altering the focal length of the zoom lens.\n\nA good way to remember this is that the camera does not zoom, but rather the lens zooms. Now, your iPhone might be able to do a \"digital zoom\" which is actually just reducing the image quality by moving in on an already captured image which is a huge faux pas in pro filmmaking.\n\nFilm Shots Examples: Quentin Tarantino's Zoom Shot\n\nHere's another zoom shot example:\n\nFilm Shots Examples: Zoom Shot in The Shining\n\nTYPES OF CAMERA MOVEMENT\n\nDolly/Zoom Shot or Vertigo Shot\n\nA dolly/zoom shot is where the camera position and focal length of the lens are simultaneously altered to create a warping effect.\n\nTypes of Shots in Film: Dolly Zoom • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nTypes of Shots in Film: Dolly Zoom • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nTYPES OF CAMERA Shots By MOVEMENT\n\nCamera Pan Shot\n\nCamera pans rotates the camera side to side on a horizontal axis. This can reveal something to your viewer or allow them to follow an action.\n\nCamera Pan Shot Example in Munich\n\nCamera Tilt Example in film\n\nCamera Tilt Shot\n\nA camera tilt is when you move your camera up and down on a vertical axis. So, it’s exactly like a pan, only vertical.\n\nCamera Tilt Shot Example in The Grand Budapest Hotel\n\nTYPES Shots OF MOVEMENT in film\n\nWhip Pan Shot or Swish Pan Shot\n\nA whip pan happens when you pan the camera from one shot to another, creating a motion blur.\n\nWhip Pans Examples • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nHere's an example of a whip pan captured on set:\n\nBehind the scenes on a whip pan setup in La La Land\n\nTYPES OF MOVEMENT in film\n\nWhip Tilt Shot or Swish Tilt Shot\n\nThe swish tilt is the same idea as a swish pan, only vertical.\n\nWes Anderson uses the swish pans and tilts extensively in The Grand Budapest Hotel\n\nTYPES OF Shot MOVEMENT in Movies\n\nTracking Shot\n\nA tracking shot moves with your subject. Sometimes it follows behind or beside them on a dolly, Steadicam or a gimbal.\n\nTypes of Shots in Film: Tracking Shots Examples • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nHere is one of the earliest tracking shot examples:\n\nTracking Shot Example in Paths of Glory\n\nTypes of Camera Movement in Movies\n\nCrab Shots\n\nThe crab shot is basically a dolly shot that moves horizontally like a crab.\n\nCrab Shot Example in Oldboy\n\nTYPES OF Camera shots by MOVEMENT\n\nArc Shot\n\nArc shots are camera shots where the camera moves around the subject in an arc pattern so as to show more of the surroundings:\n\nArc Shot Example in The Dark Knight\n\n6\n\nCamera Mechanisms\n\nUNDERSTANDING GEAR REQUIREMENTS\n\nCamera mechanisms is a fancy way of saying camera equipment. Want your camera to glide along a slider? Pushed on a dolly? Swooping with a jib arm? Hovering with a gimbal?\n\nDepending on the gear you use, the feeling of a shot can dramatically change. This is why you'll need to give the mechanism some thought when shot listing. Just remember, camera mechanisms don't just affect the look and feel of a shot, but also your budget, and prep time on set.\n\nTechnocranes don't come cheap. And setup time could put your set in a holding pattern if you don't schedule carefully. So, choose your camera mechanisms carefully when you shot list.\n\nHere's a video breakdown of the various types of camera rigs, how they work, and how they add to the \"feel\" and look of a shot.\n\nUltimate Guide to Camera Gear • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nTypes of Camera mechanisms in film\n\n1. Sticks / Tripod Shot\n\nNow let’s consider the different mechanisms that will dictate the movement in your camera shots. The most common mechanism is the tripod, or “sticks,” used for static shots and simple pans and tilts.\n\nTripods and Heads 101\n\nTYPES OF MECHANISMS in Film\n\n2. Camera Slider Shot\n\nA slider is a piece of equipment that “slides” your camera on a vertical or horizontal axis. It’s sort of like a dolly mounted on a tripod that creates smooth, sweeping camera moves.\n\nCamera Slider Shots Example\n\nYou can also use a slider with a tripod head to mimic a jib shot, but you want to be careful not to let the weight become unbalanced.\n\nCamera Slider into Camera Jib\n\nTYPES OF Camera MECHANISMS\n\n3. Handheld Camera Shot\n\nHandheld shots are held and moved by a camera operator. They aren’t stabilized and often shaky. They can add a gritty feel to a shot.\n\nHandheld camera shot example\n\nTYPES OF Camera Shots By MECHANISMS\n\n4. Steadicam Shots\n\nA Steadycam shot uses a camera stabilizing device that attaches to the camera operator. It uses a counterbalancing system for smooth and stable camera moves.\n\nSteadycam is the broad name for this camera mechanism, while the Tiffen Steadicam (with an 'i') is the model name used by Tiffen.\n\nThink: Tissue paper vs Kleenex.\n\nFun fact: the above is known as a proprietary eponym. So, now you're not only learning your camera shots, but also vocabulary. How fun!\n\nSteadycam Shot Example in Goodfellas\n\n3-Axis Gimbal Example\n\n5. Camera Gimbal Shot\n\nGimbals are another camera stabilizing device that use motorized gyroscopes to reduce friction. It is more compact than a Steadicam and completely handheld. This allows it to fit through tight spaces.\n\nCinematic Gimbal Shots\n\nTechnocrane Shots Example\n\n6. Camera Crane Shots\n\nA crane shot often sweeps up and over a scene. It is a great way to create first or final shot for a film.\n\nCrane Shot Example\n\nCamera Jib Example\n\n7. Camera Jib Shot\n\nA jib is a crane device that sweeps the camera up and over a setting. A jib is similar a crane, but with more limited range and movement. It's compact and utilizes counter-weights.\n\nA jib is a cost-effective way to get an expensive-looking crane shot\n\nDrone Shot Example\n\n8. Drone Shots\n\nThese camera shots attach to a drone to fly over or alongside your subject. They're often used for aerial shots or when shooting an exciting car chase. Drones are way cheaper than helicopters and can operate in spaces helicopters can’t.\n\nDrone Shot Example in Skyfall\n\nCablecam Example\n\n9. Camera Wire Shots\n\nIn this shot, the camera moves on a cable or wire for deliberate, smooth moves. Like drones, wires get much closer to the action than helicopters. These are often used in live concerts and sporting events.\n\nWire Shot Example\n\nUp next\n\nHow to create a professional shot list\n\nHaving knowledge of the types of shots in film, and why they’re used, is the building block to good storytelling.
