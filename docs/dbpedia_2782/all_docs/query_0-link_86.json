        "text": "Google's Pixel 8A budget phone is here, and it sells for $500 -- making it hundreds of dollars cheaper than the flagship Pixel 8, which starts at $700. So, how do these two phones stack up?\n\nLike previous Pixel A devices, this one shares a lot of commonalities with its pricier counterpart. That includes similar displays, battery life and processors. There are some slight variations between the cameras, and the Pixel 8A comes in a couple of different color options.\n\nHere's a closer look at how the specs on each device match up.\n\nSee also: Google's Pixel 8A Arrives With a Bigger Dose of AI\n\nDisplays: Similar size, same brightness\n\nThe Pixel 8A's display is about the same size as the standard Pixel 8's. The former has a 6.1-inch Actua display, while the latter's is 6.2 inches, both with a 20:9 aspect ratio. The two phones deliver up to 1,400 nits in HDR and up to 2,000 nits of peak brightness.\n\nBoth displays go up to 120Hz and include an always-on feature, which lets you see the time and any notifications on your lock screen, without waking up your phone.\n\nThe Pixel 8A features Corning's Gorilla Glass 3 cover glass, while the Pixel 8 uses the Gorilla Glass Victus cover glass, which is newer and touted as being more scratch-resistant than its predecessors.\n\nThe phones' overall dimensions and weight are almost identical. The Pixel 8A is 6 inches tall, 2.9 inches wide and 0.4-inch deep, and weighs 6.8 ounces. The Pixel 8, meanwhile, is 5.9 inches tall, 2.8 inches wide and 0.4-inch deep, and weighs 6.6 ounces.\n\nCameras: Seeing double\n\nOn the back, the Pixel 8A sports a 64-megapixel Quad PD wide camera, with a 1.89 aperture and up to 8x Super Res Zoom. There's also a 13-megapixel ultrawide camera, with a 2.2 aperture and lens correction.\n\nThe Pixel 8, by comparison, has a 50-megapixel Octa PD wide camera, with a 1.68 aperture and the same 8x Super Res Zoom. The accompanying 12-megapixel ultrawide camera also has a 2.2 aperture and lens correction.\n\nBut it's important to remember that resolution isn't all that matters in a phone camera. When CNET's Lisa Eadicicco compared the Pixel 7A to the Pixel 7 last year, she noted that the Pixel 7's camera sensor is larger and more light sensitive than the Pixel 7A's despite its lower resolution, which is important in determining image quality. We won't really know how the Pixel 8A's camera compares to the Pixel 8's until we've had a chance to test them side by side.\n\nThe wide cameras on both phones also feature optical and electronic image stabilization.\n\nThe 8A's front camera is 13 megapixels, while the Pixel 8's is 10.5 megapixels. Both have a 2.2 aperture and fixed focus.\n\nBoth the Pixel 8A and the standard Pixel 8 share many of the same camera features, including Magic Editor, Best Take, Magic Eraser, Photo Unblur, Real Tone and Portrait Mode.\n\nWhen it comes to video, the 8A's rear camera can shoot in 4k or 1080p at 30 and 60 frames per second. The front camera can shoot 4k or 1080p video at 30 frames per second. The Pixel 8 shares those same video specs, with the added option to shoot at 24 frames per second on both the rear and front cameras.\n\nBoth phones come with Audio Magic Eraser to clean up any noisy backgrounds in videos.\n\nBatteries: All-day life\n\nAccording to Google, the Pixel 8A and 8 both have batteries that can last beyond 24 hours. Using Extreme Battery Saver, the company says the phones can go up to 72 hours. Both support fast charging and wireless charging, but the flagship Pixel 8 has the advantage of allowing users to wirelessly charge other devices. That's one of the few features that separates the cheaper Pixel 8A from the Pixel 8.\n\nThe 8A has a typical 4,492-mAh battery, while the 8 has a standard 4,575-mAh battery.\n\nMemory and storage\n\nBoth phones come with 8GB of RAM, and the option for either 128GB or 256GB of storage.\n\nProcessors, SIMs and ports\n\nThe Pixel 8A and Pixel 8 share the same Google Tensor G3 processor, and Titan M2 security coprocessor. They also both feature a dual SIM, which includes a Single Nano SIM as well as an eSIM. Each also features a USB-C port.\n\nAuthentication and OS updates\n\nThe two phones have an under-screen fingerprint sensor and face unlock, as well as the option to access your phone using a pattern, PIN or password. They each come with seven years of OS and security updates.\n\nA gentle splash of color\n\nThe Pixel 8A comes in obsidian (black), porcelain (off-white), bay (blue) and aloe (light green).\n\nThe Pixel 8 is available in obsidian (black), hazel (gray), rose (pink) and mint (a light bluish green)."
