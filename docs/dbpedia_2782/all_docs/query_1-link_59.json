        "text": "Panning and zooming in to an extreme closeup of a face, but I can barely get close enough to get the face in focus and doing everything I can in adjusting focus, f-stops, etc… I’ve had to resort to pulling the camera back and can only get from torso and up to keep in focus… if I get any closer, I’m out of focus and I’m at my limit in focusing adjustments…\n\nAnyway I can cheat this extreme closeup? Did it with Depth of Field on and off with no success… pushed and pulled focus as I pan along the way but when I still get to my main target… can’t get an extreme closeup. Below are my ending stats which shows I can’t go any further in focus…\n\nDepth of field: 178\n\nAperture: 0.0\n\nLens: Fast Rectangle 50mm\n\nYou have your aperture wrong.\n\n0 is the most shallow depth of field possible. Make that a big number instead.\n\nYou may also just be dealing with the fact that your image doesn’t have the necessary resolution to maintain it’s sharpness. But then again, I have no idea what kind of footage you’re working with.\n\n“|_ (°_0) _|”\n\nSincerely,\n\nGeorge\n\n0 Aperture is actually infinite DOF, so with that set to 0 or your DOF turned off, everything should be in focus. There does actually appear to be a minimum focus distance, mine was around 275 pixels, so as long as your footage isn’t closer than that, you should be able to get it into focus regardless of your settings. If you can’t, then it simply means your footage isn’t high enough res (at least, I can’t think of anything else)."
