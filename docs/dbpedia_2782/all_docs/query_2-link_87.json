It means ensuring people with visual impairments can understand your designs with a WCAG contrast checker — lucky for you, this feature is built right into Venngage’s Accessible Design Tool.\n\nIn this guide, I’ll talk about the different types of color blindness and how it affects data visualization. Plus, I’ll share tips on using color-blind-friendly palettes to make your graphics more accessible with the help of accessible templates.\n\nI’ve also put together some ready-made color-blind-friendly palettes to inspire you. Scroll down to section 4 for that.\n\nTable of Contents:\n\nWhat is color blindness?\n\nWhat colors are color blind-friendly?\n\nHow to design charts with a color blind friendly palette\n\nWhat colors to avoid for color blindness?\n\nWhat are the 3 types of color blindness?\n\nWhy color is important to data visualization\n\nKey takeaways\n\nFirst thing’s first…\n\nWhat is color blindness?\n\nColor blindness—also known as color vision deficiency (CVD)—is a deficiency in distinguishing between different colors. It occurs when light-sensitive tissue in the back of the eye—the retina–fails to properly respond to variations in wavelengths of light, which enable people to see different colors.\n\nIMAGE SOURCE\n\nAlthough color blindness is primarily an inherited condition, it can also result from cataracts or trauma to the eye, as well as a number of diseases, including Parkinson’s, Kallman’s Syndrome and diabetes. Damage to the retina caused by aging can additionally cause color blindness.\n\nWhat colors are color blind-friendly?\n\nColorblind-friendly palettes usually use two main colors like blue and red, along with shades made from these two hues. Examples include blue/orange, blue/red, or blue/brown. Blue is a safe bet as most types of color blindness have little effect on how blue is perceived.\n\nIf you’re not sure where to start, these color blind color wheels can be a useful reference to quickly determine how your colors will translate across different forms of color blindness:\n\nIMAGE SOURCE\n\nBetter yet, I’ve put together some versatile color blind friendly palettes:\n\nHow to design charts with a color blind friendly palette\n\n1. Plan out your color scheme beforehand\n\nUsing a color blind friendly palette with accessible colors doesn’t mean you need to compromise on aesthetics or strip out all the color from your charts. By planning ahead and utilizing tools like a color palette tester, you can ensure a color blind friendly palette compliments your design, rather than clashes.\n\nIMAGE SOURCE\n\nEven with a tool like Venngage, which can drastically scale back the number of hours required to create an infographic, it’s still ideal to flesh out your color scheme before you dive in and start a new project.\n\nIf you don’t have a pre-planned accessible color scheme, you can generate one for free using Venngage’s Accessible Color Palette Generator:\n\nGone are the days of mixing, matching, testing and retesting to find a beautiful, accessible color palette. Now you can use this simple tool to generate inclusive color pairings in seconds — for free.\n\nHow does it work? In two ways:\n\nRandomize. Don’t think twice — roll the dice and generate palettes based on a random color.\n\nGenerate from HEX. Input a HEX code to discover accessible palettes based on your color of choice.\n\nNo matter which route you choose, you’ll see the contrast ratio of each color against black or white text. And every palette generated adheres to a contrast ratio of 4.5:1 as per the latest Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA.\n\nIn other words, the designs you create with these color combos will be compliant and inclusive.\n\nOnce you find a palette you love, simply click Download. You’ll get a text file with the HEX codes for that palette and for the text color that goes with it (#ffffff for white text and #000000 for black text).\n\nTry Venngage’s Accessible Color Palette Generator for free! Once you’ve narrowed down your color palette, you can upload your data. It’s simple with Venngage’s chart widgets. Double-click your chart to access your chart widget, click the green IMPORT button under the DATA tab and upload your CSV file. Your chart will visualize the data automatically.\n\nVenngage has also made it easier to customize your tables now. You can present data and highlight important information without compromising the accessibility of your design.\n\nWhen editing your table, you can choose the style and color of your fonts, and the background colors of your cells.\n\nYou can also organize your text to improve the readability. Here you can choose how to align your text horizontally and vertically within each cell.\n\nTake advantage of stylization features like these! After all, if it turns out your colors aren’t particularly suited to color blind people—and accessibility is important to you—it’s better to find this out before you’ve invested considerable time and effort in your design composition.\n\nHOT TIP: If you’re stuck, try using a tool like Coblis, a free color blind simulator which will give you a better sense of how your images will appear to people with color blindness.\n\nRelated: A Total Guide to Accessible Colors [Including Palettes & Templates]\n\n2. Avoid problematic color combinations\n\nAnother reason you should plan out your color scheme beforehand is so you can avoid using problematic color combinations, some of which can make your charts or infographics completely inaccessible to color blind people.\n\nColor combinations to avoid for people with color blindness include:\n\nRed & green\n\nGreen & brown\n\nGreen & blue\n\nBlue & gray\n\nBlue & purple\n\nGreen & gray\n\nGreen & black\n\nIf you’re stuck and absolutely must use one of these combinations, try adjusting the shades so one is extremely dark, and the other extremely light—most color blind people can detect contrast, so this likely will make things easier.\n\n3. Use highly contrasting colors\n\nAs previously mentioned, contrast isn’t an issue for most people who are color blind. Darken and lighten your colors, respectively, to make the contrast more pronounced. You can also play with different hues, as well as levels of brightness and saturation.\n\n4. Use patterns and textures\n\nUsing patterns and textures in your design is a great way to incorporate visual elements into your design which don’t rely on color.\n\nIMAGE SOURCE\n\nVenngage’s drag-and-drop design editor features a library of patterns you can use to enhance your design and make it more accessible.\n\nRelated: Color Blind Design Guidelines: How to Convey Meaning to Everyone [With Examples & Templates]\n\n5. Use symbols\n\nSymbols and icons are a great way to make your designs more accessible because they can visually punctuate a message, without relying on color.\n\nHot Tip: Venngage’s library includes over 4,000 icons you can use to make your infographics and charts more accessible.\n\n6. Make your chart monochromatic\n\nBecause color blindness doesn’t impact the ability to distinguish between different shades, consider making your charts monochromatic. Using a restricted color palette will naturally mean there are fewer opportunities to use problematic colors or combinations.\n\n7. Keep your design clean and simple\n\nWhen you’re designing for accessibility, it’s important to keep your infographics as simple and streamlined as possible. Adopting a minimalistic approach will help ensure your presentations are more easily understood, whether or not your audience is color blind.\n\nWhat colors to avoid for color blindness?\n\nColor blindness doesn’t mean people see in black and white. In fact, more than 99% of people with color blindness actually see color, just not exactly like everyone else.\n\nThe most common type of color blindness affects how people see reds and greens. Here are some color combinations to avoid to ensure your designs are more accessible:\n\nRed & green\n\nGreen & brown\n\nGreen & blue\n\nBlue & gray\n\nBlue & purple\n\nGreen & gray\n\nGreen & black\n\nWhat are the 3 types of color blindness?\n\nThere are three distinct types of color blindness:\n\nRed/Green Color Blindness\n\nAccording to Colblindor, 99% of all color blind people suffer from red/green color blindness. This is further broken down into two distinct categories:\n\nProtanopia: Also referred to as “red weakness”, individuals who suffer with this variation of red/green color blindness are unable to perceive red light.\n\nLeft: Normal vision, Right: Protanopia\n\nIMAGE SOURCE\n\nThe protanopia color spectrum looks like this:\n\nSOURCE\n\nDeuteranopia / Deuteranomaly: Also known as “green weakness”, this type of red/green color blindness renders people insensitive to green light (deuteranomaly) or unable to perceive any green light at all (deuteranopia).\n\nLeft: Normal vision, Right: Deuteranopia\n\nIMAGE SOURCE\n\nThe deuteranopia color spectrum looks like this:\n\nSOURCE\n\nRed/green color blindness is inherited, and affects males more than females. The reason for this is because the genes responsible for this condition are contained within the X chromosome.\n\nBecause women have two X chromosomes, any deficiencies in one will typically be compensated by the other. Men, however, only have one X chromosome, and don’t have a “spare” to fall back on.\n\nBlue/Yellow Color Blindness\n\nPeople who suffer from blue/yellow color blindness have difficulty distinguishing between blue and yellow colors.\n\nThis particular form of color blindness–also known as Tritanopia–is far less common than its red/green counterpart. In fact, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine, blue/yellow color blindness affects fewer than 1 in 10,000 people worldwide.\n\nBecause Tritanopia isn’t caused by a genetic trait linked to the X chromosome, it is equally present in both men and women.\n\nLeft: Normal vision, Right: Tritanopia\n\nIMAGE SOURCE\n\nThe Tritanopia color spectrum looks like this:\n\nSOURCE\n\nComplete Color Blindness\n\nPeople who suffer from complete color blindness—also known as Monochromacy—are unable to distinguish between any colors at all. Monochromacy is extremely rare, occurring in 1 in 33,000 people, according to Colour Blind Awareness.\n\nIMAGE SOURCE\n\nWhy color is important to data visualization\n\nColor plays a significant role in data visualization. For starters, colors are used to highlight important information, as well as illustrate relationships between various types of data. Color also plays an instrumental role in guiding the viewer’s eye. It can even be used to stimulate emotion through color psychology.\n\nYou can even argue that the colors used in charts and infographics actually tell the story of the data they represent. As Eva Murray writes in Forbes:\n\nIn data visualization, color sets the tone and enforces a message for the underlying visual display. It creates a certain atmosphere and can turn an unassuming visualization into an emotion-filled data story.\n\nWATCH: Everything you need to know about COLOR… in under 3 minutes\n\nKnowing how to pick colors is important, but when you’re optimizing for accessibility, there’s more to consider than color theory and design composition.\n\nRelated: 8 Best Practices for Designing for Diversity and Inclusion\n\nYou can also use Venngage’s color picker tool to easily switch out different colors, a particularly useful tool for working with color blind friendly palettes.\n\nKey takeaways for using color blind friendly palettes\n\nOptimizing your infographics and charts for people affected by color blindness is important for both accessibility and inclusivity. It’s also possible to do without compromising the aesthetic quality in the process.\n\nThe following measures can help ensure color blind people are actually able to engage with your designs:\n\nSelecting color blind friendly palettes\n\nAvoiding problematic color combinations\n\nUsing different textures and patterns to highlight important information–not just color\n\nUsing symbols and icons to supplement color-coded messages, warnings and alerts\n\nUsing highly contrasted color combinations\n\nAdopting minimalistic design to help avoid unnecessary confusion.\n\nCombining all these elements will help make your designs more accessible to color blind people. After all, the more people you can engage with, the more impactful your work will be.\n\nRelated: ADA Standards for Accessible Design: How to Be Compliant\n\nRelated blog posts:"
