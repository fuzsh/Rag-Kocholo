        "text": "CHAPTER 5\n\nProtecting Your System:\n\nPhysical Security\n\nCHAPTER 5 IN A NUTSHELL:\n\nIntroduction to Physical Security\n\nCommonly Asked Questions\n\nPolicy Issues\n\nPhysical Security Countermeasures\n\nPhysical Security Checklist\n\nIntroduction to Physical Security\n\nMost people think about locks, bars, alarms, and uniformed guards when they think about security. While these countermeasures are by no means the only precautions that need to be considered when trying to secure an information system, they are a perfectly logical place to begin. Physical security is a vital part of any security plan and is fundamental to all security efforts--without it, information security (Chapter 6), software security (Chapter 7), user access security (Chapter 8), and network security (Chapter 9) are considerably more difficult, if not impossible, to initiate. Physical security refers to the protection of building sites and equipment (and all information and software contained therein) from theft, vandalism, natural disaster, manmade catastrophes, and accidental damage (e.g., from electrical surges, extreme temperatures, and spilled coffee). It requires solid building construction, suitable emergency preparedness, reliable power supplies, adequate climate control, and appropriate protection from intruders.\n\nCommonly Asked Questions\n\nQ. How can I implement adequate site security when I am stuck in an old and decrepit facility?\n\nA. Securing your site is usually the result of a series of compromises-- what you need versus what you can afford and implement. Ideally, old and unusable buildings are replaced by modern and more serviceable facilities, but that is not always the case in the real world. If you find yourself in this situation, use the risk assessment process described in Chapter 2 to identify your vulnerabilities and become aware of your preferred security solutions. Implement those solutions that you can, with the understanding that any steps you take make your system that much more secure than it had been. When it comes time to argue for new facilities, documenting those vulnerabilities that were not addressed earlier should contribute to your evidence of need.\n\nQ. Even if we wanted to implement these physical security guidelines, how would we go about doing so?\n\nA. Deciding which recommendations to adopt is the most important step. Your risk assessment results should arm you with the information required to make sound decisions. Your findings might even show that not every guideline is required to meet the specific needs of your site (and there will certainly be some variation based on need priorities). Once decided on, however, actually initiating a strategy is often as simple as raising staff awareness and insisting on adherence to regulations. Some strategies might require basic &quot'handyman&quot' skills to install simple equipment (e.g., key locks, fire extinguishers, and surge protectors), while others definitely demand the services of consultants or contractors with special expertise (e.g., window bars, automatic fire equipment, and alarm systems). In any case, if the organization determines that it is necessary and feasible to implement a given security strategy, installing equipment should not require effort beyond routine procedures for completing internal work orders and hiring reputable contractors.\n\nDetermining countermeasures often requires creativity: don't limit yourself to traditional solutions.\n\nQ. What if my budget won't allow for hiring full-time security guards?\n\nA. Hiring full-time guards is only one of many options for dealing with security monitoring activities. Part-time staff on watch during particularly critical periods is another. So are video cameras and the use of other staff (from managers to receptionists) who are trained to monitor security as a part of their duties. The point is that by brainstorming a range of possible countermeasure solutions you can come up with several effective ways to monitor your workplace. The key is that the function is being performed. How it is done is secondary--and completely up to the organization and its unique requirements.\n\nGuidelines for security policy development can be found in Chapter 3.\n\nPolicy Issues\n\nPhysical security requires that building site(s) be safeguarded in a way that minimizes the risk of resource theft and destruction. To accomplish this, decision-makers must be concerned about building construction, room assignments, emergency procedures, regulations governing equipment placement and use, power supplies, product handling, and relationships with outside contractors and agencies.\n\nThe physical plant must be satisfactorily secured to prevent those people who are not authorized to enter the site and use equipment from doing so. A building does not need to feel like a fort to be safe. Well-conceived plans to secure a building can be initiated without adding undue burden on your staff. After all, if they require access, they will receive it--as long as they were aware of, and abide by, the organization's stated security policies and guidelines (see Chapter 3). The only way to ensure this is to demand that before any person is given access to your system, they have first signed and returned a valid Security Agreement. This necessary security policy is too important to permit exceptions.\n\nAs discussed more completely in Chapter 2, a threat is any action, actor, or event that contributes to risk\n\nPhysical Threats (Examples)\n\nExamples of physical threats include:\n\nNatural events (e.g., floods, earthquakes, and tornados)\n\nOther environmental conditions (e.g., extreme temperatures, high humidity, heavy rains, and lightning)\n\nIntentional acts of destruction (e.g., theft, vandalism, and arson)\n\nUnintentionally destructive acts (e.g., spilled drinks, overloaded electrical outlets, and bad plumbing)\n\nA countermeasure is a strp planned and taken in opposition to another act or potential act.\n\nPhysical Security Countermeasures\n\nThe following countermeasures address physical security concerns that could affect your site(s) and equipment. These strategies are recommended when risk assessment identifies or confirms the need to counter potential breaches in the physical security of your system.\n\nCountermeasures come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and levels of complexity. This document endeavors to describe a range of strategies that are potentially applicable to life in education organizations. In an effort to maintain this focus, those countermeasures that are unlikely to be applied in education organizations are not included here. If after your risk assessment, for example, your security team determines that your organization requires high-end countermeasures like retinal scanners or voice analyzers, you will need to refer to other security references and perhaps even need to hire a reliable technical consultant.\n\nCreate a Secure Environment: Building and Room Construction:17\n\nDon't arouse unnecessary interest in your critical facilities: A secure room should have \"low\" visibility (e.g., there should not be signs in front of the building and scattered throughout the hallways announcing \"expensive equipment and sensitive information this way\").\n\nSelect only those countermeasures that meet percuived needs as indentified during risk assessment (Chapter 2) and support security policy (Chapter 3).\n\nMaximize structural protection: A secure room should have full height walls and fireproof ceilings.\n\nMinimize external access (doors): A secure room should only have one or two doors--they should be solid, fireproof, lockable, and observable by assigned security staff. Doors to the secure room should never be propped open.\n\nMinimize external access (windows): A secure room should not have excessively large windows. All windows should have locks.\n\nMaintain locking devices responsibly: Locking doors and windows can be an effective security strategy as long as appropriate authorities maintain the keys and combinations responsibly. If there is a breach, each compromised lock should be changed.\n\nInvestigate options other than traditional keyhole locks for securing areas as is reasonable:\n\nBased on the findings from your risk assessment (see Chapter 2), consider alternative physical security strategies such as window bars, anti-theft cabling (i.e., an alarm sounds when any piece of equipment is disconnected from the system), magnetic key cards, and motion detectors.\n\nRecognize that some countermeasures are ideals and may not be feasible if, for example, your organization is housed in an old building.\n\nBe prepared for fire emergencies: In an ideal world, a secure room should be protected from fire by an automatic fire-fighting system. Note that water can damage electronic equipment, so carbon dioxide systems or halogen agents are recommended. If implemented, staff must be trained to use gas masks and other protective equipment. Manual fire fighting equipment (i.e., fire extinguishers) should also be readily available and staff should be properly trained in their use.\n\nMaintain a reasonable climate within the room: A good rule of thumb is that if people are comfortable, then equipment is usually comfortable--but even if people have gone home for the night, room temperature and humidity cannot be allowed to reach extremes (i.e., it should be kept between 50 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit and 20 and 80 percent humidity). Note that it's not freezing temperatures that damage disks, but the condensation that forms when they thaw out.\n\nBe particularly careful with non-essential materials in a secure computer room: Technically, this guideline should read \"no eating, drinking, or smoking near computers,\" but it is quite probably impossible to convince staff to implement such a regulation. Other non-essential materials that can cause problems in a secure environment and, therefore, should be eliminated include curtains, reams of paper, and other flammables.\n\nLocking critical equipment in secure closet can be an excellent security strategy findings establish that it is warranted.\n\nGuard Equipment:\n\nKeep critical systems separate from general systems: Prioritize equipment based on its criticality and its role in processing sensitive information (see Chapter 2). Store it in secured areas based on those priorities.\n\nHouse computer equipment wisely: Equipment should not be able to be seen or reached from window and door openings, nor should it be housed near radiators, heating vents, air conditioners, or other duct work. Workstations that do not routinely display sensitive information should always be stored in open, visible spaces to prevent covert use.\n\nProtect cabling, plugs, and other wires from foot traffic: Tripping over loose wires is dangerous to both personnel and equipment.\n\nKeep a record of your equipment: Maintain up-to-date logs of equipment manufacturers, models, and serial numbers in a secure location. Be sure to include a list of all attached peripheral equipment. Consider videotaping the equipment (including close-up shots) as well. Such clear evidence of ownership can be helpful when dealing with insurance companies.\n\nMaintain and repair equipment: Have plans in place for emergency repair of critical equipment. Either have a technician who is trained to do repairs on staff or make arrangements with someone who has ready access to the site when repair work is needed. If funds allow, consider setting up maintenance contracts for your critical equipment. Local computer suppliers often offer service contracts for equipment they sell, and many workstation and mainframe vendors also provide such services. Once you've set up the contract, be sure that contact information is kept readily available. Technical support telephone numbers, maintenance contract numbers, customer identification numbers, equipment serial numbers, and mail-in information should be posted or kept in a log book near the system for easy reference. Remember that computer repair technicians may be in a position to access your confidential information, so make sure that they know and follow your policies regarding outside employees and contractors who access your system.\n\nRebuff Theft:18\n\nIdentify your equipment as yours in an overt way: Mark your equipment in an obvious, permanent, and easily identifiable way. Use bright (even fluorescent) paint on keyboards, monitor backs and sides, and computer bodies. It may decrease the resale value of the components, but thieves cannot remove these types of identifiers as easily as they can adhesive labels.\n\nLosing a computer to theft has both financial costs (the replacement value of the equipment) and information costs (the files contained on the hard drive).\n\nIdentify your equipment as yours in a covert way: Label the inside of equipment with the organization's name and contact information to serve as powerful evidence of ownership.\n\nMake unauthorized tampering with equipment difficult: Replace regular body case screws with Allen-type screws or comparable devices that require a special tool (e.g., an Allen wrench) to open them.\n\nLimit and monitor access to equipment areas: Keep an up-to-date list of personnel authorized to access sensitive areas. Never allow equipment to be moved or serviced unless the task is pre-authorized and the service personnel can produce an authentic work order and verify who they are. Require picture or other forms of identification if necessary. Logs of all such activity should be maintained. Staff should be trained to always err on the cautious side (and the organization must support such caution even when it proves to be inconvenient).\n\nAttend to Portable Equipment and Computers:19\n\nNever leave a laptop computer unattended: Small, expensive things often disappear very quickly--even more quickly from public places and vehicles!\n\nWhile the X-ray conveyor belt is the preferred way of transporting a laptop through airport security (compared to subjecting the computer to the magnetic fields of walk-through or wand scanners), it is also a prime place for theft. Thieves love to \"inadvertently\" pick up the wrong bag and disappear while passengers are fumbling through their pockets to find the loose coins that keep setting off the metal detectors. Use the X-ray conveyor belt, but never take your eyes off your laptop!\n\nRequire laptop users to read the recommended travel guidelines that should come with the equipments's documentation.\n\nStore laptop computers wisely: Secure laptops in a hotel safe rather than a hotel room, in a hotel room rather than a car, and in a car trunk rather than the back seat.\n\nStow laptop computers appropriately: Just because a car trunk is safer than its back seat doesn't mean that the laptop won't be damaged by an unsecured tire jack. Even if the machine isn't stolen, it can be ruined all the same. Stow the laptop and its battery safely!\n\nDon't leave a laptop computer in a car trunk overnight or for long periods of time: In cold weather, condensation can form and damage the machine. In warm weather, high temperatures (amplified by the confined space) can also damage hard drives.\n\nRegulate Power Supplies:\n\nBe prepared for fluctuations in the electrical power supply: Do so by (1) plugging all electrical equipment into surge suppressors or electrical power filters; and (2) using Uninterruptible Power Sources (UPSs) to serve as auxiliary electrical supplies to critical equipment in the event of power outages.\n\nPay attention to the manufacturer's recommendations for storing portable computer batteries--they carry live charges and are capable of igniting fires if not handled properly.\n\nProtect power supplies from environmental threats: Consider having a professional electrician design or redesign your electrical system to better withstand fires, floods, and other disasters.\n\nSelect outlet use carefully: Although little thought generally goes into plugging equipment into an outlet, machines that draw heavily from a power source can affect, and be affected by, smaller equipment that draws energy from the same outlet.\n\nGuard against the negative effects of static electricity in the office place: Install anti-static carpeting and anti-static pads, use anti-static sprays, and encourage staff to refrain from touching metal and other static-causing agents before using computer equipment.\n\nProtect Output:\n\nKeep photocopiers, fax machines, and scanners in public view: These types of equipment are very powerful tools for disseminating information--so powerful, in fact, that their use must be monitored.\n\nAssign printers to users with similar security clearances: You don't want employees looking at sensitive financial information (e.g., staff salaries) or confidential student information (e.g., individual records) while they are waiting for their documents to print. It is better to dedicate a printer to the Director of Finance than to have sensitive data scattered around a general use printer. Don't hesitate to put printers in locked rooms if that is what the situation demands.\n\nLabel printed information appropriately: Confidential printouts should be clearly identified as such.\n\nDemand suitable security procedures of common carriers when shipping/receiving confidential information: Mail, delivery, messenger, and courier services should be required to meet your organization's security standards when handling your confidential information.\n\nDispose of confidential waste adequately: Print copies of confidential information should not be placed in common dumpsters unless shredded. (Comparable requirements for discarding electronic copies of confidential information can be found in Chapter 6.)\n\nPhysical Security Checklist\n\nWhile it may be tempting to simply refer to the following checklist as your security plan, to do so would limit the effectiveness of the recom-mendations. They are most useful when initiated as part of a larger plan to develop and implement security policy throughout an organization. Other chapters in this document also address ways to customize policy to your organization's specific needs--a concept that should not be ignored if you want to maximize the effectiveness of any given guideline."
