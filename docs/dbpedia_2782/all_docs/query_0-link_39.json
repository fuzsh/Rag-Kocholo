        "text": "What kind of X-Treme Ninja Course can you get? Weâ€™re glad you asked!\n\nCourse 1\n\nThis course has 14 features arranged in a closed circuit. Features include the Spider Web Climber for agility, Cheese Wall for balance, as well as Slanted Jump Boards for coordination. The features in this course are challenging and also great for those wanting to try Ninja Courses for the first time. Also, this is the original X-Treme Ninja Course and it is meant to offer everyone a chance to compete.\n\nCourse 2\n\nLike Course 1, this course also features 14 elements but unfolds in an S-Shape, challenging users to switch directions. X-Treme Ninja Course 2 is great for intermediate training, and it also offers Hanging Platforms and the Finish Wall. Additionally, this Ninja Course features a Burmese Floating Bridge for balance and Swinging Ropes to challenge grip strength.\n\nCourse 3\n\nThirdly, this Ninja Course has 20 features and is our longest, most challenging yet. Course 3 is in an S-Shape and features include the Rock Wall for building grip strength. Also, it has a Spider Walk for core strength, and Finish Wall to culminate the course with a spectacular ending! This course is not for the faint of heart, but for those ready to take being an X-Treme Ninja to a whole new level.\n\nCourse 4\n\nFinally, Course 4 may have a smaller footprint but it still packs lot to put you to the test! This course features staples like the Slanted Jump Boards, as well as challenging Hanging Platforms and the infamous Finish Wall. Lastly, Course 4 adopts a simple U-Shape design and includes everything you need in a compact layout."
