        "text": "What is Control Valve Trim?\n\nHigh Pressure Control Valve trim consists of three basic items: the stem, ball, and seat.\n\nThese are the operative parts that control the flow of liquid and gas through a valve. They are also the parts most exposed to process elements, and therefore most vulnerable to wear over time.\n\nWhat Types of Valve Trim Are There?\n\nThere are three primary types of control valve trim:\n\nSnap Trim (also referred to as Quick-Opening trim)\n\nNominal Trim (also referred to as Linear trim)\n\nEqual Percentage Trim\n\nBelow, we'll outline the specific operation and typical applications for each control valve type.\n\nWhat is a Valve's Flow Characteristic?\n\nA valve trim’s flow characteristic is the relationship between the percentage of flow and the percentage of valve stem travel between 0% and 100%.\n\n1. Snap Valve Trim\n\nSnap Valve Trim opens quickly and is used for on/off service.\n\nPrimary applications include liquid dump, pressure relief, and metering. We also offer zirconia seats for erosive applications.\n\n2. Nominal Valve Trim\n\nNominal valve trim is used for throttling liquids, liquid level control, and in applications where water hammering has been an issue.\n\n3. Equal Percentage Valve Trim\n\nEqual percentage valve trim is used to control pressure or flow of gases and vapors in throttling applications.\n\nValve trim for abrasive conditions\n\nIn oil and gas applications with highly abrasive conditions, control valves take a real beating.\n\nSand, salt, and other abrasive elements wear away the internal trim, packing, and body as it moves through the valve. Sources of valve abrasion include flowback, natural sand in the formation, and saltwater.\n\nWear and abrasion resistance is critical to optimal performance of oil and gas control valves. The premature wear abrasion causes to standard trim in control valves can cost you thousands in repairs and replacement valves, not to mention downtime. Therefore, choosing the right type of valve trim for your environment is key.\n\nKimray offers two High Pressure Control Valve trim materials designed to perform well in erosive conditions. These materials are harder than our standard trim and don’t wash out as fast.\n\nCarbide Valve Trim\n\nCarbide is a hard metal we recommend using for valve trim during flowback. In an ASTM G65 test of material loss, Carbide trim performed 2.5x better than standard D2 Steel trim.\n\nZirconia Valve Trim\n\nKimray’s wear-resistant Zirconia Trim is designed specifically for highly abrasive oil and gas applications. Zirconia offers a combination of abrasion and corrosion resistance not found in steels, alloys, or many forms of other ceramics and carbides.\n\nStellite vs. tungsten carbide vs. zirconia\n\nZirconia is a robust, hard ceramic material. It outperforms metal trim materials in abrasion resistance. This is an ideal solution for high-sand areas like North Texas, Australia, India, and China.\n\nZirconia is superior to Stellite and other metals for two reasons:\n\nIt is a harder material than metal\n\nBecause it is a ceramic and not metal, it is inert to corrosive material\n\nValve Trim Material Chart\n\nIn an ASTM G65 Sand Abrasion Test of material loss, Zirconia outperformed 316 Stainless Steel and Stellite.\n\nThe chart above shows the results of this test. It measures material loss based in cubic millimeters (mm3).\n\nKimray’s Magnesia Stabilized Zirconia valve trim performed 10 times better than Stellite Alloy and nearly 90 times better than 316 Stainless Steel. Kimray Tungsten Carbide also performed better than other metals.\n\nDo You Operate Under Extreme Conditions?\n\nValve trim performance can be affected by more than just valve abrasion. Extremely high temperatures compromise metals like Stellite. Zirconia Trim is an ideal solution for operation in extreme temperatures.\n\nThis trim is designed to perform at temperatures ranging from -200°C to 850°C. Stellite, meanwhile, is only tested for temperatures between 315°C– 600°C. And because Zirconia is not a metal, it’s not subject to NACE.\n\nZirconia Applications\n\nErosive/Abrasive Conditions\n\nFracking\n\nCoal Seam Gas\n\nValve Trim Choices Are Easy with Zirconia\n\nKimray’s Zirconia Trim combats valve abrasion more effectively than any choice on the market. That keeps your valves up and running, and your well site reaching its peak performance.\n\nZirconia Trim is available now in Kimray High Pressure Control Valves. For more information on Zirconia Trim, you can download our brochure.\n\nTHE WRONG VALVE TRIM: A use case\n\nRecently a producer in the Woodford Shale contacted us with a problem.\n\nThey had been using Kimray High Pressure Control Valves for years, but had begun to burn through a lot of trim sets in the valves, replacing them more often than expected. We began asking questions.\n\nQ: What have you been ordering?\n\nA: High Pressure Control Valve packages for all new construction\n\nQ: What type of trim are you requesting on these valves?\n\nA: 5/8\" equal percentage trim\n\nQ: What are the temperatures and flow rates of your wells?\n\nA: Conditions differ depending on the well\n\nThis was a problem we were prepared for.\n\nConditions are rarely the same well to well in the various locations and applications where Kimray customers operate. Because of this, we offer different types of valve trim designed to handle different temperatures, pressures, flow rates, and process fluids.\n\nIn this case, the equal percentage trim this customer was using was designed primarily for gas applications, where precise throttling is ideal.\n\nTheir new wells, however, were flowing liquid, and bringing a lot of sand to the surface along with it. Because they were using equal percentage trim, the valve was consistently open, subjecting the trim to the abrasive, sandy flow path. This was the central reason for the premature wear.\n\nWe advised the customer that carbide snap trim for these valves would be a better option. This would give them a harder ball and seat, and the snap trim opens and closes quickly, so it would be exposed to the abrasive flow less often and therefore last longer.\n\nWe also helped the customer resize their valves accordingly to the appropriate flow rates of the wells. Because our trim can be field converted, they didn’t have to order new valves, just outfit their existing ones with the new, better suited trim.\n\nStep-By-Step Guide to replace Valve Trim\n\nNeed to update the trim in your existing valves to handle changing conditions?
