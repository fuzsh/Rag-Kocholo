        "text": "Resolution in 3D printing can be difficult to characterize and standardize between machines and manufacturers. Ultimately, the quality and accuracy of a print depends on many factors, namely: the size, shape, and power distribution of the light curing the resin, and the scattering, bleeding, and polymerization characteristics of the resin. For example, some resins scatter light more than others, which can cause extra resin to cure and create less detailed features in a print.\n\nResolution — once referred to as ‘dots per inch’ or DPI on paper-and-ink printers — is easily understood as ink covering the X and Y axes. When 3D printing became more widely adopted, the addition of the Z-axis further complicated the definition and measurement standards for 3D printing resolution.\n\nTo determine the highest resolution 3D printing technology and manufacturer, both the ability to specifically trace a part in the XY planes and the minimum Z-axis layer height should be considered. The ability to specifically trace the intended pattern, however, relies on several factors.\n\nResolution for laser-powered SLA 3D printers is determined by four factors: spot size of the laser, the power distribution of the laser spot, the precision with which the galvanometers position the light in the XY plane, and the Z-axis minimum layer height.\n\nLaser spot size, at first glance, seems to indicate the minimum feature size possible — but that is not the case. Though it’s true that if the entire part consists of a single, round dot or sphere, then the minimum feature size is determined by the laser spot size — it cannot cure something smaller than itself. However, a dot or tiny spherical part is not realistic. For realistic parts, the laser can trace shapes and features that are smaller than its spot size, because it can move in the XY plane in increments smaller than its own spot size — tracing the ‘outside’ of a very small feature.\n\nAs an example, Form 3+ has a laser spot size of 85 microns, but an XY resolution of 25 microns. Here, XY resolution refers to how precisely the printer can draw in the XY (horizontal) plane.\n\nResolution of DLP 3D printers is determined by the pixel size (both X and Y measurements), the power and uniformity of the light, the use of anti-aliasing, and the Z-axis minimum layer height, similar to laser-powered SLA printers.\n\nThe smaller the pixel size, the greater the resolution — similar to familiar technologies such as TVs or handheld electronics. In DLP 3D printing, XY resolution is defined by the pixel size, the smallest feature the projector can reproduce within a single layer. This depends on the resolution of the projector, the most common being full HD (1080p), and its distance from the optical window. As a result, most desktop DLP 3D printers have a fixed XY resolution, generally between 35 to 100 microns.\n\nDLP 3D printers’ resolution diminishes as build volume grows bigger, because there are no projectors available with significantly more pixels. Therefore, manufacturers have to increase the distance from the light source with the same number of pixels, leading to decreased resolution and print quality.\n\nResolution of MSLA 3D printers is determined by pixel size of the LCD, the collimation and uniformity of the light source, the use of anti-aliasing, and the Z-axis minimum layer height.\n\nSimilar to DLP 3D printers, the smaller the pixel, the greater the resolution. But smaller pixels are only one factor. MSLA printers need to have highly collimated (meaning the rays are parallel) light that does not spread when passing through a pixel in the LCD screen. The light must also be extremely uniform so the resin is cured with the same optical power through every pixel in the LCD screen.\n\nLuckily, Z-axis minimum layer height is less complicated — most resin 3D printers have a standard layer height of between 25 and 200 microns. For inverted resin 3D printers, layer height is determined by the vertical depth of the resin squeezed between the build platform and the bottom of the resin tank — effectively the height of the resin cured in each layer.\n\nLong story short, does resolution actually matter in resin 3D printing? The answer is yes, but resolution itself is often just a vanity metric. It offers some indication, but it doesn’t necessarily correlate directly with accuracy, precision, and print quality. Higher resolution (smaller pixels or laser spot size in the XY dimension and smaller layers in the Z dimension) also generally comes with significant trade-offs in terms of speed or even reliability (as more layers can introduce more possibilities of error).\n\nTo see real-life examples, read our study that evaluates how SLA and MSLA 3D printers with different resolutions perform in terms of surface finish, dimensional accuracy, and minimum feature size.\n\nThe accuracy of LCD and MSLA 3D printers is affected by the uniformity and collimation of the light source, and the pixel size and quality of the LCD screen. Most LCD printers have lenses over their light sources, but most are very basic and can lead to uneven light, dark spots, or distortion — creating inaccurate parts. The quality of the LCD screen is also crucial — greater quality means the LCD screen will respond to the software programming telling it where to cover the light and where to let it through.\n\nFormlabs' Light Processing Unit 4 (LPU 4) includes a custom LCD screen with a 50 μm pixel size and pre-tuned anti-aliasing for excellent dimensional accuracy. Form 4’s Backlight Unit generates a uniform area projection of an ultra-high power light using 60 LEDs and a plano-convex lens array and optical baffle which creates highly collimated and uniform light, even at high power.\n\nThe second major factor impacting accuracy is the forces that a part experiences during printing. All inverted resin printers have two types of print forces. Peel forces occur during the peeling process of each layer as the build platform rises and the cured layer separates from the resin tank before starting a new layer. Squish forces occur on each layer when the build platform descends and squishes the print into the pool of liquid resin. These forces can cause layers to shift and deform, ultimately leading to lower dimensional accuracy.\n\nSome printers use a basic flexible film resin tank that gently separates from cured layers and minimizes peel forces. Although these tanks reduce peel forces, they have two key problems. They use a non-durable film that is easy to damage and has to be replaced frequently. They are also prone to suction forces, where the flexible film suctions onto the LCD screen and causes a spike in peel forces.\n\nForm 4, a professional MSLA printer, uses a dual-layer flexible film tank that minimizes peel forces and is extremely robust and resistant to damage. Form 4 also features a proprietary, microtextured optical film, called the Release Texture, that provides airflow between the resin tank and LCD screen, preventing suction forces and increasing accuracy.\n\nIndustrial-sized systems were more common in previous decades for large corporations who could afford both the high cost of purchase and maintenance as well as the higher square footage and infrastructure requirements of top-down stereolithography printing.\n\nDesktop-sized resin 3D printers were enabled by the invention of inverted SLA 3D printing, and as the technology was adopted by more manufacturers, smaller printers with cuboid build space of around 10-20 cm in each direction became the norm. For example, Formlabs' Form 3+ offers a 14.5 × 14.5 × 19.3 cm build volume, while Form 4 offers 30% larger build volume at 20.0 × 12.5 × 21.0 cm.\n\nSimilarly, benchtop resin 3D printing was made possible by the combination of inverted SLA technology and improved peeling techniques. Benchtop 3D printers such as Form 3L, which offers a 33.5 x 20 x 32 cm build volume, excel at prototyping human-scale consumer goods, as well as create end-use products through the use of 3D printed rapid tooling.\n\nWith DLP 3D printers, there is a direct trade-off between resolution and build volume. The resolution depends on the projector, which defines the number of pixels/voxels available. If one moves the projector closer to the optical window, the pixels get smaller, which increases the resolution, but limits the available build area. Some manufacturers use higher resolution 4K or 8K projectors, but these are very expensive, inflating the costs of the end product.\n\nLarge-format DLP printers still mostly use top-down technology, instead of inverted, which requires large amounts of resin to be available at once. As a result, desktop, small-format DLP 3D printers are generally optimized for specific use cases. They have a smaller build volume and offer a high resolution to produce small, detailed pieces like jewelry, while others can produce bigger parts but at a lower resolution.\n\nBecause LCD 3D printers rely on an array of LEDs and a similar-sized masking LCD screen, the accuracy and precision benefits remain the same as build volume gets larger. A large-format LCD or MSLA resin 3D printer will have the same accuracy as a smaller version, provided they are using an LCD screen with the same pixel size and a LED light source with the same uniformity and collimation.\n\nUnlike laser-powered SLA 3D printers, however, this does slightly increase the cost for every added LED and square cm of LCD screen added. A laser-powered resin printer can use the same laser for any size build volume, because its galvanometers can simply direct its path to farther reaches of the platform for larger sizes. However, in the interest of print speed, many benchtop large format laser-powered resin printers, like Form 3L, add a second laser unit, which increases the cost similarly to how a larger LED array and LCD screen might."
