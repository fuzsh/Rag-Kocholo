        "text": "Overview\n\nHeart disease describes a range of conditions that affect the heart. Heart diseases include:\n\nBlood vessel disease, such as coronary artery disease\n\nIrregular heartbeats (arrhythmias)\n\nHeart problems you're born with (congenital heart defects)\n\nDisease of the heart muscle\n\nHeart valve disease\n\nMany forms of heart disease can be prevented or treated with healthy lifestyle choices.\n\nSymptoms\n\nHeart disease symptoms depend on the type of heart disease.\n\nSymptoms of heart disease in the blood vessels\n\nCoronary artery disease is a common heart condition that affects the major blood vessels that supply the heart muscle. Cholesterol deposits (plaques) in the heart arteries are usually the cause of coronary artery disease. The buildup of these plaques is called atherosclerosis (ath-ur-o-skluh-ROE-sis). Atherosclerosis reduces blood flow to the heart and other parts of the body. It can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke.\n\nCoronary artery disease symptoms may be different for men and women. For instance, men are more likely to have chest pain. Women are more likely to have other symptoms along with chest discomfort, such as shortness of breath, nausea and extreme fatigue.\n\nSymptoms of coronary artery disease can include:\n\nChest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure and chest discomfort (angina)\n\nShortness of breath\n\nPain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper belly area or back\n\nPain, numbness, weakness or coldness in the legs or arms if the blood vessels in those body areas are narrowed\n\nYou might not be diagnosed with coronary artery disease until you have a heart attack, angina, stroke or heart failure. It's important to watch for heart symptoms and discuss concerns with your health care provider. Heart (cardiovascular) disease can sometimes be found early with regular health checkups.\n\nWhat is coronary artery disease? A Mayo Clinic cardiologist explains.\n\nStephen Kopecky, M.D., talks about the risk factors, symptoms and treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD). Learn how lifestyle changes can lower your risk.\n\n{Music playing}\n\nStephen Kopecky, M.D., Cardiovascular Disease, Mayo Clinic: I'm Dr. Stephen Kopecky, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic. In this video, we'll cover the basics of coronary artery disease. What is it? Who gets it? The symptoms, diagnosis and treatment. Whether you're looking for answers for yourself or someone you love, we're here to give you the best information available.\n\nCoronary artery disease, also called CAD, is a condition that affects your heart. It is the most common heart disease in the United States. CAD happens when coronary arteries struggle to supply the heart with enough blood, oxygen and nutrients. Cholesterol deposits, or plaques, are almost always to blame. These buildups narrow your arteries, decreasing blood flow to your heart. This can cause chest pain, shortness of breath or even a heart attack. CAD typically takes a long time to develop. So often, patients don't know that they have it until there's a problem. But there are ways to prevent coronary artery disease, and ways to know if you're at risk and ways to treat it.\n\nWho gets it?\n\nAnyone can develop CAD. It begins when fats, cholesterols and other substances gather along the walls of your arteries. This process is called atherosclerosis. It's typically no cause for concern. However, too much buildup can lead to a blockage, obstructing blood flow. There are a number of risk factors, common red flags, that can contribute to this and ultimately lead to coronary artery disease. First, getting older can mean more damaged and narrowed arteries. Second, men are generally at a greater risk. But the risk for women increases after menopause. Existing health conditions matter, too. High blood pressure can thicken your arteries, narrowing your blood flow. High cholesterol levels can increase the rate of plaque buildup. Diabetes is also associated with higher risk, as is being overweight. Your lifestyle plays a large role as well. Physical inactivity, long periods of unrelieved stress in your life, an unhealthy diet and smoking can all increase your risk. And finally, family history. If a close relative was diagnosed at an early age with heart disease, you're at a greater risk. All these factors together can paint a picture of your risk for developing CAD.\n\nWhat are the symptoms?\n\nWhen coronary arteries become narrow, the heart doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood. Remember, unlike most pumps, the heart has to pump its own energy supply. It's working harder with less. And you may begin to notice these signs and symptoms of pressure or tightness in your chest. This pain is called angina. It may feel like somebody is standing on your chest. When your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs, you might develop shortness of breath or extreme fatigue during activities. And if an artery becomes totally blocked, it leads to a heart attack. Classic signs and symptoms of a heart attack include crushing, substernal chest pain, pain in your shoulders or arms, shortness of breath, and sweating. However, many heart attacks have minimal or no symptoms and are found later during routine testing.\n\nHow is it diagnosed?\n\nDiagnosing CAD starts by talking to your doctor. They'll be able to look at your medical history, do a physical exam and order routine blood work. Depending on that, they may suggest one or more of the following tests: an electrocardiogram or ECG, an echocardiogram or soundwave test of the heart, stress test, cardiac catheterization and angiogram, or a cardiac CT scan.\n\nHow is it treated?\n\nTreating coronary artery disease usually means making changes to your lifestyle. This might be eating healthier foods, exercising regularly, losing excess weight, reducing stress or quitting smoking. The good news is these changes can do a lot to improve your outlook. Living a healthier life translates to having healthier arteries. When necessary, treatment could involve drugs like aspirin, cholesterol-modifying medications, beta-blockers, or certain medical procedures like angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery.\n\nWhat now?\n\nDiscovering you have coronary artery disease can be overwhelming. But be encouraged. There are things you can do to manage and live with this condition. Reducing cholesterol, lowering blood pressure, quitting tobacco, eating healthier, exercising and managing your stress can make a world of difference. Better heart health starts by educating yourself. So don't be afraid to seek out information and ask your doctors about coronary artery disease. If you'd like to learn even more about this condition, watch our other related videos or visit Mayoclinic.org. We wish you well.\n\nHeart disease symptoms caused by irregular heartbeats (heart arrhythmias)\n\nThe heart may beat too quickly, too slowly or irregularly. Heart arrhythmia symptoms can include:\n\nChest pain or discomfort\n\nDizziness\n\nFainting (syncope) or near fainting\n\nFluttering in the chest\n\nLightheadedness\n\nRacing heartbeat (tachycardia)\n\nShortness of breath\n\nSlow heartbeat (bradycardia)\n\nHeart disease symptoms caused by congenital heart defects\n\nSerious congenital heart defects usually are noticed soon after birth. Congenital heart defect symptoms in children could include:\n\nPale gray or blue skin or lips (cyanosis)\n\nSwelling in the legs, belly area or areas around the eyes\n\nIn an infant, shortness of breath during feedings, leading to poor weight gain\n\nLess-serious congenital heart defects are often not diagnosed until later in childhood or during adulthood. Symptoms of congenital heart defects that usually aren't immediately life-threatening include:\n\nEasily getting short of breath during exercise or activity\n\nEasily tiring during exercise or activity\n\nSwelling of the hands, ankles or feet\n\nHeart disease symptoms caused by diseased heart muscle (cardiomyopathy)\n\nEarly stages of cardiomyopathy may not cause noticeable symptoms. As the condition worsens, symptoms may include:\n\nDizziness, lightheadedness and fainting\n\nFatigue\n\nFeeling short of breath during activity or at rest\n\nFeeling short of breath at night when trying to sleep or waking up short of breath\n\nIrregular heartbeats that feel rapid, pounding or fluttering\n\nSwollen legs, ankles or feet\n\nHeart disease symptoms caused by heart valve problems (valvular heart disease)\n\nThe heart has four valves — the aortic, mitral, pulmonary and tricuspid valves. They open and close to move blood through the heart. Many things can damage the heart valves. A heart valve may become narrowed (stenosis), leaky (regurgitation or insufficiency) or close improperly (prolapse).\n\nValvular heart disease is also called heart valve disease. Depending on which valve isn't working properly, heart valve disease symptoms generally include:\n\nChest pain\n\nFainting (syncope)\n\nFatigue\n\nIrregular heartbeat\n\nShortness of breath\n\nSwollen feet or ankles\n\nEndocarditis is an infection that affects the heart valves and inner lining of the heart chambers and heart valves (endocardium). Endocarditis symptoms can include:\n\nDry or persistent cough\n\nFever\n\nHeartbeat changes\n\nShortness of breath\n\nSkin rashes or unusual spots\n\nSwelling of the legs or belly area\n\nWeakness or fatigue\n\nWhen to see a doctor\n\nSeek emergency medical care if you have these heart disease symptoms:\n\nChest pain\n\nShortness of breath\n\nFainting\n\nAlways call 911 or emergency medical help if you think you might be having a heart attack.\n\nHeart disease is easier to treat when detected early. Talk to your health care provider if you have any concerns about your heart health. Together, you and your provider can discuss ways to reduce your heart disease risk. This is especially important if you have a family history of heart disease.\n\nIf you think you may symptoms of heart disease, make an appointment to see your provider.\n\nThere is a problem with information submitted for this request.

There are many different types of heart disease.\n\nHow the heart works\n\nChambers and valves of the heart\n\nChambers and valves of the heart\n\nA typical heart has two upper and two lower chambers. The upper chambers, the right and left atria, receive incoming blood. The lower chambers, the more muscular right and left ventricles, pump blood out of the heart. The heart valves are gates at the chamber openings. They keep blood flowing in the right direction.\n\nTo understand the causes of heart disease, it may help to understand how the heart works.\n\nThe heart is divided into chambers — two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles).\n\nThe right side of the heart moves blood to the lungs through blood vessels (pulmonary arteries).\n\nIn the lungs, blood picks up oxygen and then returns to the left side of the heart through the pulmonary veins.\n\nThe left side of the heart then pumps the blood through the aorta and out to the rest of the body.\n\nHeart valves\n\nFour heart valves — the aortic, mitral, pulmonary and tricuspid — keep the blood moving the right way. The valves open only one way and only when they need to. Valves must open all the way and close tightly so there's no leakage.\n\nHeartbeats\n\nA beating heart squeezes (contracts) and relaxes in a continuous cycle.\n\nDuring contraction (systole), the lower heart chambers (ventricles) squeeze tight. This action forces blood to the lungs and the rest of the body.\n\nDuring relaxation (diastole), the ventricles fill with blood from the upper heart chambers (atria).\n\nElectrical system\n\nThe heart's electrical system keeps it beating. The heartbeat controls the continuous exchange of oxygen-rich blood with oxygen-poor blood. This exchange keeps you alive.\n\nElectrical signals start in the upper right chamber (right atrium).\n\nThe signals travel through specialized pathways to the lower heart chambers (ventricles). This tells the heart to pump.\n\nCauses of coronary artery disease\n\nDevelopment of atherosclerosis\n\nDevelopment of atherosclerosis\n\nIf there's too much cholesterol in the blood, the cholesterol and other substances may form deposits called plaque. Plaque can cause an artery to become narrowed or blocked. If a plaque ruptures, a blood clot can form. Plaque and blood clots can reduce blood flow through an artery.\n\nA buildup of fatty plaques in the arteries (atherosclerosis) is the most common cause of coronary artery disease. Risk factors include a poor diet, lack of exercise, obesity and smoking. Healthy lifestyle choices can help lower the risk of atherosclerosis.\n\nCauses of irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias)\n\nCommon causes of arrhythmias or conditions that can lead to them include:\n\nCardiomyopathy\n\nCoronary artery disease\n\nDiabetes\n\nDrug misuse\n\nEmotional stress\n\nExcessive use of alcohol or caffeine\n\nHeart problem present at birth (congenital heart defects)\n\nHigh blood pressure\n\nSmoking\n\nHeart valve disease\n\nUse of certain medications, including those bought without a prescription, and herbs and supplements\n\nCauses of congenital heart defects\n\nA congenital heart defect develops while a baby is growing in the womb. A congenital heart defect forms as the baby's heart develops, about a month after conception. Congenital heart defects change the flow of blood in the heart. Some medical conditions, medications and genes increase the risk of congenital heart defects.\n\nCauses of a thickened or enlarged heart muscle (cardiomyopathy)\n\nThe cause of cardiomyopathy depends on the type:\n\nDilated cardiomyopathy. The cause of this most common type of cardiomyopathy often is unknown. It may be passed down through families (inherited). Dilated cardiomyopathy typically starts in the heart's main pumping chamber (left ventricle). Many things can cause damage to the left ventricle, including heart attacks, infections, toxins and some drugs, including cancer medicines.\n\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This type is usually passed down through families (inherited).\n\nRestrictive cardiomyopathy. This is the least common type of cardiomyopathy. It can occur for no known reason. Sometimes it's caused by a buildup of protein called amyloid in the heart (cardiac amyloidosis) or connective tissue disorders.\n\nCauses of heart infection\n\nA heart infection, such as endocarditis, occurs when germs reach the heart or heart valves. The most common causes of heart infections are:\n\nBacteria\n\nViruses\n\nParasites\n\nCauses of heart valve disease\n\nMany things can cause diseases of the heart valves. Some people are born with heart valve disease (congenital heart valve disease). Heart valve disease may also be caused by conditions such as:\n\nRheumatic fever\n\nInfections (infectious endocarditis)\n\nConnective tissue disorders\n\nRisk factors\n\nRisk factors for heart disease include:\n\nAge. Growing older increases the risk of damaged and narrowed arteries and a weakened or thickened heart muscle.\n\nSex. Men are generally at greater risk of heart disease. The risk for women increases after menopause.\n\nFamily history. A family history of heart disease increases the risk of coronary artery disease, especially if a parent developed it at an early age (before age 55 for a male relative, such as your brother or father, and 65 for a female relative, such as your mother or sister).\n\nSmoking. If you smoke, quit. Substances in tobacco smoke damage the arteries. Heart attacks are more common in smokers than in nonsmokers. If you need help quitting, talk to your health care provider about strategies that can help.\n\nUnhealthy diet. Diets high in fat, salt, sugar and cholesterol have been linked to heart disease.\n\nHigh blood pressure. Uncontrolled high blood pressure can cause the arteries to become hard and thick. These changes interrupt blood flow to the heart and body.\n\nHigh cholesterol. Having high cholesterol increases the risk of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis has been linked to heart attacks and strokes.\n\nDiabetes. Diabetes increases the risk of heart disease. Obesity and high blood pressure increase the risk of diabetes and heart disease.\n\nObesity. Excess weight typically worsens other heart disease risk factors.\n\nLack of exercises. Being inactive (sedentary lifestyle) is associated with many forms of heart disease and some of its risk factors, too.\n\nStress. Unrelieved stress may damage the arteries and worsen other risk factors for heart disease.\n\nPoor dental health. It's important to brush and floss your teeth and gums often. Also get regular dental checkups. Unhealthy teeth and gums makes it easier for germs to enter the bloodstream and travel to the heart. This can cause endocarditis.\n\nComplications\n\nComplications of heart disease include:\n\nHeart failure. This is one of the most common complications of heart disease. Heart failure occurs when the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.\n\nHeart attack. A heart attack may occur if a blood clot is stuck in a blood vessel that goes to the heart.\n\nStroke. The risk factors that lead to heart disease can also lead to an ischemic stroke. This type of stroke happens when the arteries to the brain are narrowed or blocked. Too little blood reaches the brain. A stroke is a medical emergency — brain tissue begins to die within just a few minutes of a stroke.\n\nAneurysm. An aneurysm is a bulge in the wall of an artery. If an aneurysm bursts, you may have life-threatening internal bleeding.\n\nPeripheral artery disease. In this condition, the arms or legs — usually the legs — don't get enough blood. This causes symptoms, most notably leg pain when walking (claudication). Atherosclerosis can lead to peripheral artery disease.\n\nSudden cardiac arrest. Sudden cardiac arrest is the sudden loss of heart function, breathing and consciousness. It's usually due to a problem with the heart's electrical system. Sudden cardiac arrest is a medical emergency. If not treated immediately, it results in sudden cardiac death.\n\nPrevention\n\nThe same lifestyle changes used to manage heart disease may also help prevent it. Try these heart-healthy tips:\n\nDon't smoke.\n\nEat a diet that's low in salt and saturated fat.\n\nExercise at least 30 minutes a day on most days of the week.\n\nMaintain a healthy weight.\n\nReduce and manage stress.\n\nControl high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes.\n\nGet good sleep. Adults should aim for 7 to 9 hours daily.\n\nHeart disease care at Mayo Clinic\n\nWhat is cardiovascular disease?
