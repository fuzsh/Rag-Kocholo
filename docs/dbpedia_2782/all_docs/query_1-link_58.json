        "text": "1987 was a strong year for me personally in music. Watching MTV and other local and national music video programs were still happening, The Cosby Show and Family Ties dominated the television sets , and films like The Running Man, The Lost Boys, and Dirty Dancing were lighting up the movie screens.\n\nMusic was a treat too at the time. There was still a mixture of acts and genres which were all over the charts, from the debut of Richard Marx to a solo venture from Sammy Hagar who was fronting Van Halen (my favorite time of the band), and Def Leppard’s Hysteria was ready to dominate radio and video. Whitney Houston and Rick Astley were mixed in, along with the worldwide breakout of INXS. It was also where several hard rock bands decided to add a pop mix to their sound by adding keyboards like Aerosmith and Whitesnake, thanks to the success of albums like Bon Jovi’s Slippery When Wet and New Jersey. So it made sense that legends KISS would join the times as well with Crazy Nights, their fourteen release.\n\nThe band was not doing as well as they would have liked during the 1980s after taking off their makeup. Guitar member changes from original member Ace Frehley and replacements Vinnie Vincent and Mark St. John all came and went, before settling with Bruce Kulick, who made his album debut on 1985’s Asylum. Yes, the band started to bring back some lost fans with Creatures of the Night, returning to a hard rock sound after the experimental Music From The Elder, but they mostly didn’t stay long. Asylum was a great record, with songs like “Tears Are Falling”, “UH! All Night,” and the underrated “Secretly Cruel” (the record was the first hard rock, and KISS album that was in circulation at my local public library, so it became a favorite of mine just due to that). But it was Crazy Nights that got me hooked into the band and became a full-time member of the KISS Army.\n\nMy older cousin was a KISS fan from the 1970s, where I remember him playing Alive II at his house while showing me his collection of KISS merch, from the trading cards to posters, but it wasn’t until the MTV video era that I started buying discounted KISS cassettes from that time after hearing Crazy Nights.\n\nStarting with the title track, an attempt to create another rock anthem like “Rock And Roll All Night” years before, the modern sound works for the opening of the record. This was a song that was played at the high school dances in my hometown of Columbiana, Ohio. The dances were always a treat for me; being in junior high at the time, we had separate dances every month or so, but on occasion, we 7th and 8th graders were allowed to attend the high school dances where they had more rock-flavored songs. It was here I would be one of the first ones in the door to hear some of the rock songs that they didn’t play at our dances. It was here where I heard Henry Lee Summer’s songs from his self-titled album (you can read my review by typing into the archives), and Crazy, Crazy, Nights.\n\nThe underrated “I’ll Fight Hell To Hold You” showcases the drumming power of my all-time favorite drummer Eric Carr. The song has a heavy flavor but is still radio-friendly/pop that I liked in my music. Co-written with Kulick and Adam Mitchell, Paul Stanley hits a high range vocally that proves his skills are still there (which is debatable in the past several years). Some may say the vocals are too high, but for someone who loves The Beach Boys, it doesn’t bother me. The strong fills by Carr on the song get overlooked.\n\n“Bang Bang You” is a simple 1980s sex-driven song that isn’t one of the better KISS songs, but it fits in with the period that was released. A song, like the whole album, I would hear blasting in the high school parking lot from the cars while I was waiting to catch my bus to the junior high school.\n\n“No, No, No” is a musical jam spotlighting Kulick and Carr, trying to keep the fans happy with the harder rock style. Sung by Gene Simmons, this gives musical credibility to those critics who thought that KISS was just another band lumped into the glam era ’80s living off of the past success.\n\nSimmons gets another song with “Hell Or High Water,” a track that is a favorite of mine on the record after the past two average tracks. The mid-tempo style fits Simmons’ past Demon songs. The strong backing vocals give the song more power to it for a radio-friendly tune. The solid beat from Carr adds to it as well.\n\nPaul Stanley’s “My Way” is totally 1980s, co-written by Desmond Child and Bruce Turgon. In the book KISS Behind The Mask, Stanley states that the song was something he came up with while messing around with keyboards. Kulick’s guitar solo is nice here, although the theme of living life the way they want falls a little flat after the title track already has the same themes. Although not a total dud, it’s a weaker track but still fits on the album without being out of place with the 1980s vibe.\n\nAfter “When Your Walls Come Down,” one of my all-time favorite Kiss songs Especially ballads) is next with “Reason To Live,” another song I heard at the school dances all the time. The opening fill of Carr’s drums gives a different approach to the structure of the song. The positive lyrics of learning to go on after a breakup is a nice touch compared to the “we broke up and I’m sad vibe.” The second single off the record got plenty of airplay on MTV and my local video programs, and again, listen to Carr’s fills on here. It isn’t just a simple beat, but he adds just enough power but doesn’t overdo either, which is something Carr doesn’t get the credit for, being known for just the strong , hard , powerful playing. I love ballads anyway, so this fits well for me. The lyrics ” Down the line, there’s a lesson I’ve learned/You can love and get burned if it has to be/And I see a change in my life, And I’m not alone when I’m strong inside” is uplifting rock poetry. Also great was the music video.\n\n“Good Girl Gone Bad” is one of the songs by Gene Simmons that more need to hear. This is a wonderful deep cut in the band’s overall songs. Keep in mind at the time, Simmons was half into the band, focusing on his movies and television careers, along with producing other bands. Paul was basically trying to handle the band himself, while Gene would come in and do his songs and leave. Even though Gene and Paul dismiss most of this record, this gets dismissed by KISS fans, yet they point to other bands who were putting out the same thing.\n\nWhy wasn’t “Turn On The Night” a bigger hit here in the U.S. is beyond me. Another song that got plenty of play at the dances. the third single from the album didn’t chart in the U.S., and barely in the UK, the song should have been all over the radio. Co-written by Diane Warren, who would be all over radio by the 1990s is a mystery of why this didn’t gain steam. A solid pop/rock song.\n\nEnding the record is “Thief In The Night,” (another song with “Night ” in the title, which made three on the album) a song that Wendy O. Williams first recorded and co-written by Simmons and Mitch Weissman. It is a good closer for a song that Gene was pretty much not involved with the band, his tracks end up being some of the better ones.\n\nCrazy Nights is my favorite KISS album because of all the memories I have listening to the songs; from the school dances to buddies playing it on the way to the local bowling alley. It also made me fall in love with Carr’s drumming, with his strong fills but not doing too much, along with his cymbal accents while hitting the snare to give an added touch. All of the songs are under five minutes long, which is another great thing; no unnecessary solos or drawn-out choruses until fade out, which gives it a pop/radio listenable record. Plus the shattered glass cover was cool in my opinion and gave a neat aspect to the 1980s album covers. It doesn’t make sense where some KISS fans bash the album for being “too polished” or “keyboard-heavy” yet praise the records of “Permanent Vacation” or the Whitesnake release that did the same thing. Producer Ron Nevison, who was riding high helping Heart hit the charts in the 1980s, was the best producer for the band at this time. The band’s next full studio release (after a greatest hits album) Hot In The Shade used many demo versions of songs. One could argue that this was the last full attempted solid production for the band from the 1980s.\n\nJust like my love for Van Halen, which started with 5150 (or like any music listener who hears an act or band for the first time) Crazy Nights was the one that built the foundation for me to start my journey into the band. Granted it is not their best musical work (for me that will be Revenge), but it is still my favorite album, with the pop sound but still with solid musicianship that didn’t let me down.\n\nKiss is : Gene Simmons, Eric Carr, Bruce Kulick, and Paul Stanley\n\nTrack List:\n\n1. Crazy Crazy Nights 2. I’ll Fight Hell To Hold You 3. Bang Bang You 4. No, No, No 5. Hell Or High Water 6. My Way 7. When Your Walls Come Down 8. Reason To Live 9. Good Girl Gone Bad 10. Turn On The Night 11. Thief In The Night\n\nThere are several albums by the band KISS that were turning points for the group. Alive was the breakthrough album for them, in which the studio albums were not making much of a dent in terms of sales besides the diehard fans, and gave the original members the much-needed radio hit to keep the label, and possibly their careers, afloat. Alive is still listed as one of the greatest live albums in music, not just in hard rock, which captured the live concert feel of the band.\n\n1976’s Destroyer became another landmark record, with Alice Cooper producer Bob Ezrin added to the success of the band, creating one of the band’s most popular studio releases, along with the iconic cover, and the ballad “Beth,” which gave them a stronger fan base with a newer growing female audience.\n\nMusic From The Elder was their attempt at a concept album, and featured new drummer Eric Carr, after original drummer Peter Criss left after 1979’s Dynasty, but was still on the covers on 1980’s Unmasked (Anton Fig played drums on the record). It is still one of the most polarizing albums for KISS fans; some like the wanna-be Rush story album attempt, while others (me included) despise it. 1983’s Lick It Up took the band into new territory with guitar player Vinnie Vincent (who replaced Ace Frehley) being the first album without their signature makeup.\n\nBy 1992, many of the KISS Army left the group after the 1980s run, where the band was accused of following the other groups of the time (even not showing up for their tours, though the band had radio hits), instead of being the leaders of hard rock from the 1970s. Although I love the 1980s era, including Crazy Nights (my all-time favorite), many fans wanted a more hard rock sound as opposed to a radio-friendly mix with just strong solos and drumming.\n\nEnter Revenge.\n\nThis is the album many view as the best Non-Makeup album (some will argue musically their best period). With new drummer Eric Singer, who played on Paul Stanley’s solo tour and took over the Kiss duties after the death of Carr, the band got back to the “streets” so to speak. Gone was the image of flashy neon clothing, high hair, dancing spins, and a more aggressive, leather-wearing, no-nonsense attitude to the music.\n\nWhen fans saw the official debut from the album “Unholy” (the Argent cover of “God Gave Rock ‘N’ Roll To You II” appeared on a movie soundtrack, which makes “Unholy” the first official single in my opinion), fans were not only shocked that Gene Simmons was back with an angry vengeance, taking on his persona of the Demon which was missing in the 1980s, but fans were digging the heaviness of song which was on constant rotation on MTV. Those who scoffed at the 1980s videos could no longer do so when “Unholy,” and “Domino” appeared on MTV’s Headbangers Ball. It became cool again to be a KISS fan. Although many of us stayed with the music and band, we had to deal with some ridicule for doing so.\n\nReuniting Vincent for some songwriting, along with Ezrin as producer, Paul Stanley, Simmons, Bruce Kulick, and Singer shined big time (as typical Ezrin, he brought in some of “his guys” to play on a few tracks). Regardless of the fact some fans were shocked that Singer was brought in being the first blonde-haired drummer, once they heard “Heart Of Chrome,” “Thou Shall Not,” and “Unholy,” looks had nothing to do with his solid drumming, which led him to be the longest-reigning drummer. Kevin Valentine added drums to “Take It Off,” but still played in Singer’s style, which wasn’t revealed until years later with the internet era (KISS loved to keep the mystique of the members playing on all the tracks, evener in the 1970s when Frehley and Criss were not always present)\n\nRevenge is a solid album from top to bottom, and even though some may scoff at songs like the Simmons’ sung “Spit” or the ballad ‘Every Time I Look At You,” trying to keep the female audience after gaining them again with “Forever” from 1989, the flow of the album is perfectly placed. It is hard to find filler on the album, and the last track pays tribute to Carr with one of his solos added on. Regardless of the tales of how Carr may or may not have been treated in his final days, the band did right here by giving to Carr’s legions of fans who were still heartbroken over his death. For once (at least here) Simmons and Stanley admitted to their past members’ contributions.\n\nRevenge is not only a great album for KISS fans to enjoy but one that I point to for fans who never heard of the band’s songs besides “Rock And Roll All Night,” Beth,” or “Rock And Roll All Night.” I usually tell them to get Revenge or their Unplugged release to prove that the band was not just makeup and concert gimmicks, but solid musicians. This is an album that gave the band’s musical credibility getting placed on another level. The album, which was in constant rotation on cassette during my college years at Kent State University, is the first cassette I ever got from the BMG Music Club (man I miss that club) but is still played once every few months to this day. The historical aspect where this was the album (besides Alive III) with this lineup before Simmons and Stanley decided to re-unite in full makeup with Criss and Frehley for a few tours; Carnival of Souls was put on the shelf for a few years and then just placed out there without much publicity after being widely bootlegged. It is an album that is mixed in results among fans due to its attempt at a grungy sound. It is hard to find anyone who doesn’t like Revenge or at least most of the songs from it. One could argue that imagine if the band worked that well during the Carr years or even had Ezrin brought back in a few albums earlier, would Hot In The Shade or Crazy Nights have been different, and how?\n\nRevenge a much-needed boost for the group (similar to 1982’s Creatures Of The Night) in terms of bringing KISS back into the hard rock genre, and it also holds up to this day in the music. Unlike some albums of bands, the listener can sometimes tell if a record is from a certain decade ( mostly in the 1980s when keyboards were heavily used), but one would have a hard time figuring out if this record is current in music style or thirty years old, with the only exception possibly being the lyrical content, thanks to the #MeTOO movement. Revenge is one of the landmark albums that people should go to more often when it comes to important moments in KISSTORY and holds its own with some of the considered great albums by the group.\n\nTrack List: 1. Unholy 2. Take It Off 3. Tough Love 4. Spit 5. God Gave Rock ‘N’ Roll To You II 6. Domino 7. Heart of Chrome 8. Thou Shall Not 9. Every Time I Look At You 10. Paralyzed 11. I Just Wanna 12. Carr Jam 1981\n\nEvery so often I will review a music home video release, just like one of my other segments, “Childhood Classics” which looks at music releases that went under the radar or some that may have forgotten about and was an influence on my childhood, “Tracking The Times” will try and look back at these videos with a clearer picture.\n\nA video that I wore out in college was X-Treme Close -Up by KISS. My older cousin was the first person that exposed me to the band in the early 1980s when I would visit his house. He had KISS posters and albums all over his room, and played their music constantly. The visions of Gene Simmons covered in blood from the Alive II album was the first thing I remember from those visits. It wasn’t until I was in early high school that I started to actually buy KISS cassettes from the bargain bin at a store called Fisher’s Big Wheel, which was similar to K-Mart in my hometown of Columbiana, Ohio. When I started college, I was obsessed with hard rock music and my Metal Edge magazines, collecting anything I could KISS related. VHS music home videos were also popular at this time.\n\nX-Treme Close -Up was a documentary about the history of the band, told by the current members of Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley, Bruce Kulick, and Eric Singer. Although many die-hard fans scoffed at the release at times due to some of the comments made by Gene and Paul, I watched this almost every day after classes with the few KISS fans I knew of at Kent State University.\n\nThe video opens with the opening riffs of the song “Unholy,” while a few comments of Paul and Gene start until Gene’s vocals hits for the song and the music video continues with the graphics over top of the beginning. This opening segment showed a powerful, heavy beginning that would please the fans of the band, who were promoting heavily the 1992 Revenge album.\n\nThe interviews with Gene and Paul take the viewer through the band’s formation, from their first meeting, to the Wicked Lester band (the group Simmons and Stanley formed before KISS). The auditions of Ace Frehley and Peter Criss are discussed, which ended up becoming the original lineup. Throughout the interviews (which Gene and Paul tell most of the story) partial footage from the band’s 1970s’ live shows or music videos are shown, such as “Watchin’ You,” and “Hard Luck Woman,” and “Sure Know Something.” Fans of the makeup era would enjoy these segments, that was not shown before the video came out for a mass audience (there were no Youtube back then), so fans who bought the VHS got a treat.\n\nWhile Paul and Gene discuss parts of the band’s moments from Ace and Peter leaving to the various lineup members, it isn’t until Destroyer where the two actually discuss the albums of the band, focusing on the success of the song “Beth,” and a quick comment about the Alive album. The album makings are not discussed in the show besides this brief segment.\n\nThe death of drummer Eric Carr is covered as well, along with the KISS movie, which again, was a treat, since many members of the band’s crew and associates were banned for years in talking about the movie, which Gene and Paul considered an bad spot in the band’s history.\n\nThere are several great things to enjoy here, besides the concert clips of the makeup years. The fact that Eric Singer and Kulick get some interview time is vastly different than the last videos the band released; 1988’s Crazy Nights, which was just a release of the three videos from the album, and 1987 Exposed, where Kulick and Eric Carr have a very brief segment; Stanley and Simmons get most of the time between the music videos placed in. A great story about Eric Singer seeing the band in Cleveland in the 70s , only to get kicked out before the end of the show, is humorous on here. Another funny part is Singer discussing how he was impressed with the band’s mix of visuals on stage , along with the band being “heavy” in the music. This is an amusing comment, because right after he says this, the band’s video “Sure Know Something” comes in, which was considered part of the band’s disco album. Even though I love the song, watching this part today made me chuckle because it isn’t a heavy song when a member of the group just talked about a heaviness in the music, and they play one of the pop songs.\n\nListening to Simmons tell his side is always entertaining, from his bashing of critics to other bands, is Gene at his finest. Sometimes he reminds you of that crazy uncle that tells great stories at parties. I also enjoyed the image of Gene, going back to a street/metal look, as opposed to his “Phyllis Diller” look, which he talks about in the film. With fans coming back to the band, after some leaving in the 1980s, the Revenge album and look of the band brought an excitement again to many. I even remember getting a skull dress shirt, similar to what he was wearing in the interview (or even a plain black short-sleeved shirt), over the top of my black KISS shirts to wear to class every day. Gene was back into the metal star image that we wanted to see.\n\nThe video clips for the most part are limited, either starting midway through the song, especially the makeup era, but there are pretty much the full videos from the “Hot In The Shade” release here, with “Hide Your Heart” (one of my favorite of the videos), ” Forever,” and “Rise To It,” along with “Let’s Put The X in Sex” from the compilation album before. Again, for fans that wanted copies of these videos, they had to either videotape them from MTV, hoping they could get it , or buy this.\n\nOne reason why I constantly played this over and over was not only to listen to Gene’s great storytelling, but for the videos that feature Carr, who is my favorite all time drummer. Regardless of what fans think of (from rumors that have come out throughout the years concerning Eric’s sickness and how the band treated it), it was a rare aspect of Stanley and Simmons discussing Carr and his death. I also remember how many fans of the original lineup for years bashed the comments that Stanley made about Frehley not developing as a guitar player, to Carr being a much better drummer musically than Criss was in the show, but something I personally agreed with.\n\nFor fans wanting to know about the band’s history, even today, this is a good watch. Yes, it is Gene and Paul’s take on the situation, which have been changed throughout the years. But the video isn’t dated, and is still enjoyable with the official videos by the band. The commercial for the KISS action figures, and the footage of the song “Love ‘Em, Leave ‘Em” was also a favorite of mine when I first bought the VHS to today’s DVD. The release was released as a 2 movie collection DVD , with 1993’s KISS: Konfidental concert video, and have been pricey to find, but one can find a decent priced version of the film if you look. It is still one of my favorite releases, not just form KISS, but of any band. It was decades later before KISS fans got the Kissology box set series which gave more footage for fans, so this 90-minute release was a treasure, and was all we had for decades until the internet. The film brings back many college memories so much that I still have the VHS copy of it in my collection (I remember being shocked buying the VHS seeing a “Parental Warning” sticker on the cover, wondering what I was getting because I was not familiar with them on videos at the time), although I got a copy of the double filmed DVD this year. This should definitely be seen for hard rock fans, and should be owned by KISS collectors.\n\nMany music fans think of the band KISS as the group with makeup, blood spitting, fire breathing stage shows, filled with lights and pyrotechnics that influenced many of the music acts that followed them, from bands in the 1980s hard rock glam scene to acts like Garth Brooks. Some critics have scoffed at the fact that the band was all show and no substance. What these critics forget is the fact that the non-makeup years were just as good as the era when the band put on the makeup.\n\nIn his book Take It Off Kiss Truly Unmasked (Jawbone Press, 2019), Greg Prato looks at the era of the band without the makeup (the years 1983-1997). Prato, who also wrote the wonderful book about KISS drummer Eric Carr, walks the reader through each album, along with commentary from some of the songwriters, radio personalities like Eddie Trunk, and the guitarist at the time Bruce Kulick.\n\nThe Foreward of the book is written by wrestler/podcast/author/ singer Chris Jericho, who describes first seeing the “Heaven’s On Fire” video on television, which made him become a KISS fan. Jericho writes about how the non-makeup years was the KISS he was first exposed to, and has become a fan ever since, in fact Jericho has had Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons on his podcasts and his band even played the KISS Cruise.\n\nStarting off with the “Lick It Up” album, where the band made their famous unveiling on MTV without the make-up for the first time, the chapter has several different people discussing their opinions on taking the makeup off, from Geddy Lee of Rush to Mike Reno of Loverboy. Each chapter then walks through each album, along with extra contributions from people like Steve Ferris of the band Mr. Mister who at one time auditioned for the band, to podcasting personality Mitch Lafon, and singer Ron Keel, who Simmons produced his first few albums.\n\nThe text has wonderful stories from songwriters and video producers (and the album producers) telling stories that some fans may not have heard (and some that are disputed by the famous rumors). Some stories such as Bruce Kulick coming in to help on some of the “Animalize” recordings because then guitarist Mark St. John couldn’t remember the parts (which Kulick ended up being the guitarist for KISS after a few shows into that tour), how Stanley’s opening to “Heaven’s On Fire” was an accident in the studio that got kept in, and how the KISS Conventions got started due to former KISS manager Bill Aucoin not paying rent on a warehouse storage unit. More stories involve the time a radio host, who ran a pirated show, got permission from Stanley to play a track before the “Revenge” album came out, only to receive a cease and desist letter, which Paul read on the air of the show from his own label.\n\nThere are few parts of the book that didn’t make much sense to me, for being a huge fan of this time period. One part involves Judas Priest guitarist K.K. Downing discussing the music videos of the 1980s and a small story about opening for the band . Normally this would be an interesting part to the book, from someone who was a peer of KISS during the time, but there was hardly any mention (besides the one story) about KISS, and more about Priest’s budgets on their videos. Another meaningless section is an interview with Katherine Turman, a rock journalist who even wrote for Simmons’ Tongue Magazine. The topic used here is discussing the lyrical content of KISS and their views on women in the society (today and now). This part was not needed because for fans like me who have been longing for a book about this era of the band (which is actually my favorite), this conversation was almost insulting the KISS fans, by making fun of the lyrics of the band, like they were not quality songwriters or musicians. Granted some of the lyrics had cheesy, overtly sexual content which would not be accepted today, but at the time, that was what KISS wrote about, and dismissing it in a book where KISS fans would read it, seemed like all the other books and writers who goof on this era.\n\nWith that said, the book is very nicely done, including putting in excerpts from the Eric Carr book, discussing his death and his influence he had on others. This is a wonderfully historical writing, with humor and respect (for the most part) of an era where many fans still hold dear to them. KISS fans, like Van Halen and even The Beatles’ followers, are passionate about which eras (and members) they like best, and for this fan, it is great to finally see a book covering the members Bruce Kulick, Eric Carr, Eric Singer, and the albums they contributed to, with respect and not viewed as a joke. There are great tales of behind the scenes songwriting events, to the stage setups for the different tours, along with the history of the albums, singles, music videos, and long form videos. This is a book that must be added to the KISS library.\n\nTake It Off Kiss Truly Unmasked by Greg Prato (Jawbone Press, 2019) ISBN: 978-1-911036-57-9 can be found at: http://www.jawbonepress.com.\n\nFor information on the author, visit his Twitter page @gregpratowriter\n\nThe Overall\n\nPages: 287\n\nLanguage: Moderate\n\nGeared For: Ages 12 and Up\n\nFor Fans Of: Rock Music, KISS, Biographies, Non-Fiction, 80s Hard Rock.\n\nI started playing drums when I was approximately the age of 7 years old. I wanted to play the drums because my uncle was the best local drummer in my opinion, and wanted to be like him. I looked up (and still do) to him as one of my favorite local musicians. He was not only a great drummer, playing rock, jazz, Dixie, and in other style bands, but no one ever had a bad thing to say about him as a person or a drummer in the area (unlike me , who got lumped into bands where drummers were considered “not real musicians” and even had a few bands that constantly ripped me off of my pay).\n\nOne of the first records I had as a child was Rock ‘N’ Roll Love Letter by The Bay City Rollers (still to me, a very underrated band when it came to musicianship, and unfortunately was lumped in as a novelty act). The first public appearance I made playing drums was at a Kindergarten or First Grade school talent show (I can’t remember which it was) playing to Waylon Jennings’ The Theme To The Dukes of Hazard. Due to my uncle’s influence, I was taught that a good drummer learned many different styles, and the more I could play those styles, the more gigs I could get playing in various bands. The process worked for me, from playing in blues, rock, country, worship music, and helping out in bands such as hard rock and minstrel style shows.\n\nAs I wrote in my retro review on the Rush album Presto for the website Sleazeroxx (https://sleazeroxx.com/reviews/rush-presto/) , I never had to buy Rush music because my best friends had all of their cassettes. I mentioned that whenever we would go out somewhere, either to church functions, the roller skating rink, or just to cruise around town, they always played Rush in their cars. During school, they would argue with me about music, or dissect the Rush lyrics in study hall at school to interpret the lyrical content of the band.\n\nI listened to more mainstream bands like KISS and Van Halen growing up in the rock genre, along with what was being played on the radio, such as Billy Joel andDuran Duran, along with the 1970s and ’80s country acts like The Oak Ridge Boys and Jerry Reed. Since I was more into a pop sound, Rush was not a favorite of mine at first, and due to my friends constantly playing their stuff, I was over exposed to the fact the band turned me off.\n\nIt wasn’t until Presto and the MTV exposure that the album received that I finally found an album by the band that I could enjoy with my pals. Now I did like a few songs such as “Tom Sawyer,” “Limelight,” and “Closer To The Heart” from their early work, but Geddy Lee’s voice was too high for me at the time, and as a drummer, Neil Peart’s technical skills was too much for me. However, songs like “Show Don’t Tell, ” “Anagram (For Mongo),” and the very underrated “The Pass” hit the spot for me- it had a pop radio friendly style to it without compromising the artistic style where Rush fans would claim they “sold out” (whatever that term really means)\n\nThere are many things about Peart’s skills that made him legendary. Within the past ten or so years I have started to really listen , and appreciate, his drumming skills more. Maybe it is because of the lack of great songs and acts in today’s music (to me melody in songs are missing), but re-discovering his work still amazes me. Here is a drummer who wrote all of the lyrics to the songs, and to my knowledge (Rush fans will correct me if I’m wrong), Peart didn’t play any other instruments. There are several great drummers who have contributed to their band’s lyrical department (Phil Collins comes to mind), but most of them played guitar or piano to help out with the writing process. Even my all time favorite drummer Eric Carr from Kiss played bass on some of the band’s albums. Having a degree in English (and a drummer who tried to get band members to understand what I tried to write), I can really be in awe of how hard it is to write lyrics to songs, without playing another instrument. And what great lyrics they were!!\n\nAnother wonderful aspect to Peart’s life is that he was always considered one, if not THE greatest rock drummer of all time, winning multiple drum magazine awards, but yet still went off in the 1990s to learn more, by taking lessons under Freddie Gruber. When you have played your instrument for thirty some years already, touring all over the world and making a fortune, why would you want to go back and take lessons from someone? What could someone possibly teach one of the best? This is a lesson to many younger drummers (and older ones) that you can always learn something new.\n\nIn the past few years of writing this page, I had the honor of reviewing some great books, and Peart’s Far And Wide book was one of my favorites (you can find the review by typing it in the search engine in the archives) . This book (one of many) detailed Peart’s traveling on his motorcycle throughout the United States and Canada during what would be the next to last tour of the band. I could not image him wanting to play drums for two hours plus, and then chart a destination course across two countries and ride to and from the shows just to go play again. The book has great humor in it, and shows that not only as a lyricist , but an author, Peart had another gift to him on top of being the most respected drummer in history.\n\nMy favorite Peart songs? As mentioned, I love the three I named from Presto, along with “Chain Lightning.” The fills on “Tom Sawyer” are epic. I did like some of his mellower songs in terms of style, such as “Bravado,” where he does just enough to make the song complete. Many drummers point to his massive fills, along with his complex rhythms, but let’s not forget that on songs like this he carries the beat and keeps it simple at times.\n\nOther favorites of mine are “Limelight, ” “Spirit Of Radio,” ” Lakeside Park,” and how anyone not jam out to “Subdivisions?”\n\nI got to see Rush twice live in concert. My pals always went without me (probably knowing I wasn’t a huge fan at the time), but I saw them on the “Vapor Trails” tour and 2007 tour. I was in awe seeing the thousands of people air drumming throughout the show; a concert first for me. With the exception of seeing Phil Keaggy , where fans were playing air guitar throughout the set, I never seen so many people air drumming in unison as a collective group.\n\nThe death of Peart brings me back to my pals sitting in the high school library during study hall getting shushed by the library arguing over music; topics like “Who is the best lead singer,” “Who is the best drummer,” and “What is the best album” from different bands. Since one of the guys in my group passed away last year, Peart’s death is also that much saddening. Rush brought many heated arguments within that class period and on many nights riding in my friends’ cars, which a few times almost ending up with blows being thrown.\n\nFor a drummer who got kicked out of high school band for not being able to read music (I did OK I think locally by playing with many of the legends in the Youngstown , Ohio area, along with getting to open for a few national acts when they came to town), and not being a major Rush fan until the 1990s, it is a credit to Neil Peart’s skills and talents that even a non-die harder could state that in the rock genre, we lost the G.O.A.T. Since it is hard to compare musical styles (say rock verses jazz), I always had to separate the lists on who is the greatest drummer of all time ( a debate topic that many confuse their “favorite” drummer as the pick for the best overall).\n\nIn my opinion, Neil Peart was the greatest rock drummer , and next to Buddy Rich, the greatest drummer of all time. His influence on countless generations of drummers (and those who just enjoyed drumming in the air), along with the wonderful legacy lyrically and as a Rock and Roll Hall Of Famer, along with band mates Alex Lifeson and Geddy Lee, showed that a three piece band could be even more powerful than a band with four, five or even more members to create their own style without compromising integrity. And the fans stayed true to them throughout the process.\n\nRest In Peace to a rock legend, drum icon, and literary artist.\n\n“The Encyclopedia of Kiss” by Brett Weiss (McFarland, 2016) is a well-researched guide of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame band Kiss. The book covers all things Kiss, including facts that even die hard fans may not have known, or have forgotten about.\n\nThe book was written, as Weiss details in the opening, because he could not find a detailed book on facts and all things Kiss (besides a book from Japan), being a fan of the band. The research Weiss puts into the book, is remarkable, and it lives up to the subtitle “Music Personnel, Events, and Related Subjects.” It covers names such as merchandise managers to guitar techs, along with the all the members of the band and people who helped out along the way.\n\nThe Preface of the book tells how Weiss grew up being a Kiss fan, but unable to afford all of the merchandise that the band bombarded the public with throughout the years, even having to make his own toy Kiss van by putting Kiss stickers on a van. Weiss focused spending his money on the albums and the magazines that the band was featured in, along with telling the story when he and a friend were anxiously waiting for the TV movie “Kiss Meets The Phantom of the Park” debut on the television in 1978. Weiss also details the time, after the 1970s when being a Kiss fan “wasn’t cool” among other people , but still kept his love of the band (something I can relate to). The Preface proves that the author is not just writing a book to be published, but shows his love for the band in a touching background of his youth.\n\nThe book itself is easy to read , just like a normal encyclopedia. The topics are in alphabetical order, and easy to find throughout. Weiss covers all the eras of the band, not just the original lineup, so there is information on members Eric Singer, Eric Carr, Tommy Thayer, Mark St. John, Bruce Kulick, and Vinnie Vincent, as well the other bands they were in before (and with some of the members) after their time in Kiss. The collection covers the solo albums of the members, tribute albums (official and unofficial), and the concert tours listed under the name of the tours. Opening acts are mentioned briefly as well as the equipment the band members used during their time.\n\nA Kiss book would not be complete without the merchandise that the band has put out during the years, and Weiss covers them just as well as the other information. The Kiss pinball machines, toys, trading cards, books, are all in here. A surprising topic is the Kiss comic books, and named in the book is Youngstown, Ohio’s Chris Yambar, whose work is in the Simpson’s “Tree House of Horrors” comic that featured Kiss (who also contributed to my ode to the Batman TV Show in this page’s archives). The book covers the Kiss WCW wrestler, and even lists the band’s connections to people like George W. Bush and Barack Obama.\n\nThe Gene Simmons appearances are listed as well, from his movies to game shows and reality shows to interviews. The appearances of the other people in the Kiss universe, including the “fake” Peter Criss.\n\nBeing a Kiss fan, I thought I knew tons of information about the band, but this book had several things that I learned; including some of the tribute CDs that were released in other countries (one including the music geared to the baby friendly audience) to high schools creating musical productions of the band’s album “Music From The Elder,” and the tour that Gene did not spit fire on (“Hot in the Shade” Tour). I also forgot about the TV Show “PM Magazine,” which I used to watch all the time, where the band made some appearances.\n\nThere are a few errors in the book, where the author mentions the song “Dirty Livin” from 1979’s “Dynasty” album and then a few pages later, mentions the song again as “Dirt Livin,” and states that Eric Carr’s “only lead vocal with Kiss” was 1989 “Little Caesar,” but then mentions Carr singing “Beth” in 1989 on “Smashes Trashes and Hits.” Also, there is a note that Eric Carr sang on the song “All For The Glory ” on the “Sonic Boom” CD, when it was Eric Singer. Given all of the information that is listed in the book, a few errors can be overlooked, because it is very far and between. With all the research in the book, a few minor mistakes is expected, and doesn’t take away from this 236 page gem of a writing.\n\nThe text also has the author’s views on several of the track listings of the songs, along with some reviews from magazines and websites. The opinions are not offensive for those fans that love certain songs , and some may hate (and vice versa), which makes Kiss fans so unique in their love of certain albums and songs (and members) as opposed to others (This page constantly praises the “Crazy Nights” release which many Kiss fans goof on). There are some nice black and white photographs throughout the book as well covering some of the toys, comics and rarities that is worth the price of the book.\n\nI heard about this book when the author was on the Mitch Lafon “Rock Talk” podcast, and had to seek it out. Even though it is not an official Kiss book, this book is a must have to add to the Kiss collection. The research and easy to find topics, makes the book a great go-to text reference for Kisstory fans. McFarland Publishing has had many wonderful writers and books released that have been featured on this page, and “Encyclopedia of Kiss” is another wonderful piece of work. A Kiss fan’s collection is not complete without having this book on their shelf.\n\nThank you to McFarland for the Review Copy of the book.\n\n“Encyclopedia of Kiss” by Brett Weiss (2016 McFarland pISBN: 978-0-7864-9802-4 eISBN: 978-1-4766-2540-9) can be found at http://www.mcfarlandpub.com or at their order line at 800-253-2187.\n\nFor information about Brett Weiss, go to http://www.brettweisswords.com\n\nKiss has always been one of my favorite bands. Along with The Beach Boys, The Bay City Rollers, and The Oak Ridge Boys, the band was an early influence on me as a fan, and even as a drummer.\n\nMy early encounters with Kiss involved my older cousin, who had many of their albums lying around when I would visit his house to play LEGOs. I remember him scaring me with the picture of Gene Simmons from the “Alive II” album, along with him playing me the song “God of Thunder.” I would stare at his Kiss Bubble Gum Card collection in awe wondering what it was I was seeing. I remember years later in junior high, when I walked across town with my friend to look at the bargain bin cassette tapes at the local Fishers Big Wheel (which was like a K-Mart). It was there I bought my first Kiss cassette, “Destroyer.” Throughout the 1980s, I became a bigger fan of theirs, including drummer Eric Carr, and how cool he looked after reading stories about him in Metal Edge Magazine, along with other music magazines.\n\nI was also a huge fan of Gene Simmons, who was all over my TV at the time with his movies “Runaway” and “Trick or Treat,” which I watched all the time with another drummer friend of mine (Many years ago I got the DVD of the movie at a Walmart bargin bin and still love the film, and the music of Fastway who performed the soundtrack). I remember almost wearing out my VHS copy of “Kiss Meets the Phantom of The Park” when I taped it from a late night Pittsburgh TV Channel. I still have many Kiss T-Shirts and items (one of my favorite still is my Eric Carr Figure, and the “Crazy Nights” Program Book a college friend sold to me, who is even a bigger Kiss fan than I am). I saw them on the Reunion Tour in 1996 in Pittsburgh PA, “The Psycho Circus” Tour in 1998 at the same arena, and the “Farewell Tour” in Cleveland, Ohio in 2000. Even though I saw drummer Eric Singer with Alice Cooper, I have not seen him with Kiss (who happens to be my second favorite drummer behind Eric Carr, and got to talk to Singer at the Cooper show).\n\nSince Kiss was such an important part of my music listening and drumming career, I thought I’d rank my Top Kiss Albums. As passionate as Kiss fans are, I am sure this will cause some debate, but this is my ranking of my favorite albums by the band. I am not counting any Greatest Hits Collections or Live Albums on this list-this is strictly their studio work.\n\n6. “Rock And Roll Over” (1976). This album also has one of my favorite covers of the band, although many may choose “Destroyer” as the best, I love the cover so much that my girlfriend got me a coffee mug of the cover of the album. This album charted at #11 on the U.S. Album Charts, and has great songs like “Mr. Speed” (probably my favorite lesser known Kiss song ever), “Love Em, Leave Em,” and “Makin Love,” which closes the album. The song also has “Hard Luck Woman,” which became a hit for the band, which has a Rod Stewart feel to the song. There are a few songs that wear on me, but overall this is one of my tops.\n\n5. “Love Gun” (1977). This album is great all throughout with no fillers on the album. What is amazing about Kiss during the early years is that they were releasing two albums a year while touring. Today’s acts can hardly put out an album once a year. Once again, the cover is great, with the band surrounding by women in Kiss makeup. I always loved the cover just because of how Gene looks so menacing, like Count Dracula or another horror character in the painting. This was a time when the album covers meant something to the product.\n\nAnother aspect of the album I love (no pun intended) is the fact that it is a short album, with a run time of a little over 32 minutes, which leads no time for filler solos or songs just to plug up the album. I remember getting this album on cassette at a bargain bin, and practicing the parts on my drum set for hours. Although many love the album due to Ace Frehley’s “Shock Me,” I love the songs “Plaster Caster,” Christine Sixteen,” and the bands remake of “Then She Kissed Me,” a re-working of then “Then He Kissed Me” hit by The Crystals. I also like “Hooligan,” with drummer Peter Criss singing lead, which is a song I liked better than “Beth.” The album also reminds me of “The Phantom of the Park,” when some of the songs from the album was used in the film.\n\n4. “Destroyer” (1976). Most people love this album because of the famous album cover, and because it has the staples like “Beth,” Detroit Rock City,” and “Shout It Out Loud,” which are all good reasons. However, when I listen to this album, I think of songs like “King Of The Night Time World,” and “Flaming Youth.” My memories of the album is more being able to purchase my first Kiss cassette, as mentioned earlier, and the fact that so many songs are still played live today by the band shows its importance. However, some of the songs are overplayed that I need a break from hearing them, but that does not take away from how good the album is from start to finish.\n\n3. “Hotter Than Hell” (1974). This album is my favorite of the original lineup. This was their second album and has a dark theme to some of the songs, which made me afraid of the band (along with many other parents at the time when they heard and saw the band). Songs like “Parasite,” Got To Choose,” and “All The Way” are my favorites. “Watching You” and “Goin Blind” are also great in keeping with a dark tone. Even though the album only charted around #100 on the Albums Charts (they didn’t get their break until “Alive I” a few years later), this is my favorite of the originals. The cover isn’t as awesome as “Love Gun” or “Destroyer,” but the songs are what counts.\n\n2. “Crazy Nights” (1987). Now this is where Kiss fans will start attacking me, but I think this album is underrated, and it was a major part of me growing up in junior high. The song “Crazy Crazy Nights” was played at every high school dance I went to, along with the junior high dances (certain dances junior higher students were allowed to attend the high school ones). This was the album that I discovered Eric Carr’s drumming as well, who became my all time favorite drummer. I loved the shattered glass image for the cover, and thought Eric looked cool with his drummer gloves, which I didn’t see many drummers use before. Many fans think this album is too polished and Pop sounding, but when the album came out, it was no different from the stuff that was being released at the time. I still think “Reason To Live,” and “Turn on The Night” are great songs, along with the drumming on “I’d Fight Hell To Hold You.” This album gets too much criticism in my opinion (almost as much bashing as “The Elder” or “Dynasty”), but it gets high ranking for me due to the memories I have of the album growing up.\n\n1. “Revenge” (1992). It’s hard to believe this album is celebrating its 25th Anniversary this year. I remember when the video for the single “Unholy” was shown on MTV’s “Headbanger’s Ball” and I was floored by it. Gene Simmons was back in my eyes, looking mean and street-like, as opposed to the glam look he was sporting in the 1980s. This album brought back many Kiss fans that left the band in the 1980s, and made the album hit #6 on the U.S. Album Charts. I got the cassette when I was a member of the BMG Music Club, where you would get 12 cassettes for the price of one, as long as you bought it within the year. When I finally got a CD player, one of the first CDs I got from the club was “Revenge” as well. Paul Stanley recently mentioned on Chris Jericho’s podcast that the band finally was at a common cause, as opposed to the years where he was doing most of the work, while Gene was doing movies. Stanley also calls the album a rebuilding of the Kiss brand, to get back the fans that left them in the 1980s. This album was the first for Eric Singer, who fit in great with the band. This album could have been a disaster, in the fact that the fans (and the band) were just coming off of the death of Eric Carr, but this album is my favorite non-makeup era album.\n\nThe album is heavy oriented, which was needed in the band, just like “Creatures of the Night” brought a new direction for the band in the 1980s. Songs like “Domino,” “Thou Shall Not,” and “Heart of Chrome” (which Stanley recently stated is his favorite song on the album), shows more edge to the band, and that they were still able to compete with the grunge music that was started to break at the time. This album also had the ballad “Every Time I Look At You” and the catchy “I Just Wanna” for the fans that were still loving the 1980s stuff that followed out of the “Hot In The Shade” Album that was before this one. The band also brought former member guitar player Vinnie Vincent for the songwriting process, which shows that Vincent was still a great writer. The album also shows how underrated guitarist Bruce Kulick and Eric Singer really are as musicians, who do not get enough credit in the music world. I challenge anyone who doubts Singer’s work to check this album out, because he is definitely a great drummer.\n\nThis album also has a special memory for me, not just because of the music club, but I also bought my first T-shirt from online rock site Rockabilia. Back then, the company sent a catalogue through the mail, and I remember my excitement seeing the package at my college mailbox, and inside was a shirt of the band photo from the back of the CD. I wore that shirt proudly, and still have the shirt in good shape. The album was played constantly through my walks to and from classes on the college campus of Kent State University (this was before IPods and we had Walkmans).\n\nThere are many great Kiss albums like “Creatures of the Night,” “Carnival of Souls,” and “Dynasty,” and even the debut album, but there are songs I skip over on all those. (Plus I was tired of the “Carnival of Souls” after listening to bootleg copies of it for a year until the actual release). The fact that Kiss started in 1974 and is still playing today is a testament to their musicianship. The band will always have their critics, even those that refuse to accept the original lineup is not together, but I have enjoyed albums from each of the lineups. It is rare that a band with several lineups have been able to stay relevant and produce good music. Kiss is truly a musical phenomenon that has proven its longevity throughout several decades."
