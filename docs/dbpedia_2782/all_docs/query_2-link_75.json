        "text": "When it comes to selling products online, presentation is key. One of the most effective ways to enhance your store’s appeal is through high-quality product photography. Beautiful, professional-looking images can significantly boost your online store’s visual appeal and help you stand out in a crowded market.\n\nWhile investing in a professional photography studio is ideal, it’s not always feasible for new or small businesses. Fortunately, DIY product photography offers an excellent alternative. With the right tools and techniques, you can create compelling product photos that rival professional shots—all without breaking the bank.\n\nEssential equipment for product photography\n\nHigh-quality ecommerce photography in your online store can be the difference between making a sale and losing a customer. This guide is designed specifically for budget-conscious business owners, offering simple yet effective techniques to produce professional-grade product photos that drive results.\n\nLet’s explore the key items you’ll need to set up your own product photography studio:\n\nGet your free photo studio checklist\n\nCreate your own studio and capture every image your ecommerce store needs for less than $50 with our photo studio checklist.\n\nLearn more\n\nCamera\n\nThe camera you choose plays a crucial role in the quality of your product images. While high-end DSLRs like the Nikon D850 ($1,800) with a 105 mm f/1.4 lens ($740) can produce stunning results, they’re not necessary for most small businesses. In fact, you can achieve great results with your smartphone—check out our guide to smartphone product photography for tips.\n\nStart with whatever camera you have available and assess the results. Remember, the camera is just one piece of the puzzle. Great product photography is the result of thoughtful lighting, exposure, styling, and post-processing decisions.\n\nTripod\n\nA tripod is a three-legged stand that supports and stabilizes your camera. It’s crucial for product photography, ensuring consistent framing and composition across multiple shots.\n\nTripods are particularly useful when shooting with slow shutter speeds, which are often necessary when using small apertures to achieve greater depth of field. They’re simple to use: set up on a stable surface, attach your camera, and adjust the legs and head to experiment with different heights and angles.\n\nFor beginners, an affordable tripod is perfectly adequate. Many quality options are available for less than $30.\n\nWhite background\n\nA clean white background and proper light control are fundamental for professional-looking product photos.\n\nThere are numerous options for white backgrounds. If you’ll be shooting frequently, consider investing in a white sweep. Paper sweeps are particularly useful, as you can easily cut off dirty sections and roll down fresh material.\n\nFor a budget-friendly option, visit your local art or drug store and purchase poster board—often available for as little as $7 for 10 sheets. Opt for pure white, as off-white or cream backgrounds are more challenging to edit to pure white in post-processing.\n\nTable\n\nA good table allows you to easily adjust the background, lighting, and products for various setups.\n\nStandard folding tables work perfectly for product photography. Aim for a width between 24 and 27 inches, providing ample space for most product setups without being overly large.\n\nCover the table with your chosen background material, allowing it to curve up against a wall or backdrop stand for a seamless look. Ensure you can work comfortably, whether standing or sitting. The table doesn’t need to be aesthetically pleasing, since it will be covered—focus on stability and appropriate size.\n\nTape\n\nSecuring your setup is crucial for consistent shots. Tape is an excellent tool for holding your background in place.\n\nTo avoid damaging your table, use strong, removable tape like painter’s tape or gaffer’s tape. Secure the edges of your background material (such as poster board or seamless paper) to the table, ensuring it’s taut and wrinkle-free as it curves up against the wall or backdrop stand.\n\nLenses\n\nYour choice of lens significantly impacts the overall quality of your product photos. Consider your product size and shooting environment when selecting a lens.\n\nWhile lenses can be a significant investment, aim for versatility. A standard zoom lens allows you to shoot both larger products and smaller details. Two popular options are:\n\n24–70 mm f/2.8: Versatile for close-ups and wider shots, with an f/2.8 aperture for low-light situations.\n\n50 mm f/1.8: This prime lens matches the human eye’s focal length, and its wide aperture suits various environments.\n\nExperiment with different focal lengths to find what works for your products. Choose a lens that clearly and attractively showcases your product’s key features.\n\nLightbox\n\nLightboxes are excellent for product photography, creating even lighting and minimizing shadows for a professional look. They’re particularly useful for small to medium-sized products.\n\nUsing a lightbox is straightforward: place your product inside on the white background. If your lightbox has built-in lights, turn them on and adjust for even illumination. For more control, consider using external light sources.\n\nProps\n\nProps can help tell your product’s story by setting the mood, showing scale, or demonstrating use. However, it’s crucial to strike a balance—props should enhance, not overshadow, your product.\n\nFor example, when photographing a coffee mug, you might include coffee beans, a book, or a pastry to create a cozy scene. Arrange props naturally around the product, ensuring they don’t obscure key features.\n\nConsider color when choosing props to avoid clashing with your product. Take test shots and adjust your arrangement as needed to create a balanced, inviting image.\n\nOptimal lighting conditions\n\nNatural light is ideal for photography, whether indoors or outdoors. When shooting indoors, a room with large windows adjacent to a wall provides excellent lighting.\n\nOutdoors, open areas or tree-shaded spots can offer great lighting. However, controlling outdoor lighting can be challenging and may require additional tools like diffusers or reflectors.\n\nRemember, distance from the light source affects your results: closer proximity creates softer light with darker, softer shadows, while greater distance produces lighter, sharper light. Experiment to find a space where you can manipulate light to achieve your desired look.\n\nLearn more: Jewelry Photography Tips for DIY Product Photos (2024)\n\nHow to take professional product photos on a white background\n\nSet up your table\n\nSet your sweep\n\nAdjust your camera\n\nSet up your product\n\nSet up your reflector card\n\nTake the picture and evaluate\n\nRetouch your pictures\n\nOptimize images for your website\n\nHigh-quality product photos can significantly boost your customers’ confidence in your offerings. While photo editing is important, the foundation of great product photography lies in the initial shoot. Let’s walk through the step-by-step process for capturing professional-grade product photos.\n\nStep 1: Set up your table\n\nWith your gear assembled, it’s time to create your shooting area:\n\nPosition your table close to a window, without intersecting the windowsill’s shadow.\n\nStart with the window at a 90-degree angle to your setup.\n\nThe closer you are to the window and the larger it is, the softer your light will be.\n\nKey tip: Turn off all other lights in the room to avoid contaminating your set—a common mistake many beginners make.\n\nExperiment with different setups:\n\nTry rotating your set so the window is at a 45-degree angle.\n\nPosition the window directly facing your set for varied natural lighting effects.\n\nFor food photography, consider placing the window behind your setup for a dramatic effect.\n\nA garage with an open door can mimic window light without glass interference.\n\nAvoid direct sunlight on your set, as it creates harsh shadows unflattering to most products and people.\n\nStep 2: Set your sweep\n\nA sweep is a crucial element in product photography. It’s a single piece of material, typically white paper or fabric, that curves smoothly from a vertical position to a horizontal one. This seamless transition eliminates sharp corners or blemishes in the background, creating a clean, professional look for your product photos.\n\nTo set up your sweep:\n\nPosition the top of the sweep material vertically, then let it curve gently onto the horizontal surface of your table.\n\nYou may need to gently roll the board to achieve the right curvature.\n\nThe goal is to create a smooth, uninterrupted background that transitions from behind your product to underneath it.\n\nSetup options:\n\nIf possible, place the table against a wall and tape the sweep to both the wall and table.\n\nWithout a wall, create a support for the back of the sweep using bricks or a wooden block.\n\nPosition your product in the center of the flat part of the sweep, leaving room to add a white reflector card later. This setup will ensure your products appear to float in a clean, distraction-free environment, drawing all attention to the item you’re showcasing.\n\nStep 3: Adjust your camera\n\nWhile every camera is different, here are some general guidelines to get you started:\n\nSet your white balance (WB) to Auto.\n\nTurn off the flash.\n\nUse the highest quality image settings available. If available, use RAW format for maximum editing flexibility. If RAW isn’t an option, choose the largest JPG setting. Select Large for image size and Superfine for quality.\n\nSet your ISO to 100 for minimal noise.\n\nExposure settings\n\nOption A: Manual mode (M)\n\nSet your f-stop to the highest number for maximum depth of field\n\nAdjust shutter speed until the image is properly exposed\n\nUse the camera’s live view to preview your adjustments\n\nOption B: Aperture priority (Av)\n\nSet the f-stop to the highest number\n\nThe camera will automatically adjust shutter speed\n\nUse exposure compensation if needed\n\nOption C: Auto exposure\n\nIf limited to auto settings, try using the Sunset mode\n\nOn smartphones, tap the area you want properly exposed\n\nUse exposure compensation (+1 or +1½) if available\n\nPro tip: Don’t rely solely on the camera’s preview image. Use the histogram to ensure proper exposure. Adjust the exposure until the curve representing the white background touches the right edge without going over.\n\nStep 4: Set up your product\n\nPositioning your product may seem simple, but it often requires careful attention to detail. For items like bottles, ensure the label is centered and straight. Expect to make numerous small adjustments to achieve perfect alignment.\n\nStep 5: Set up the reflector card\n\nA white reflector card is your most valuable light modifier, versatile enough for any setup. It bounces light to fill in shadows, creating a more evenly lit image. Experiment with different card angles to find the most flattering light for your product.\n\nStep 6: Take the picture and evaluate\n\nAfter capturing your image, take time and examine what you’ve created. This is where experience and education come into play:\n\nWhat aspects are working well?\n\nWhat could be improved?\n\nHow can you enhance the overall image?\n\nExperiment with different techniques to refine your skills over time. Upload your images to a computer for a more accurate view, as camera displays can be misleading. Consider using software like Lightroom to organize and perform initial edits on your images.\n\nStep 7: Retouch your pictures\n\nEven well-shot photos usually benefit from some retouching. Your initial image should have a properly exposed product against a light gray background. Retouching helps:\n\nClean up the background\n\nRemove distracting shadows\n\nImprove overall brightness and contrast\n\nRetouching can be challenging for beginners, tools like Shopify Magic make the process much more accessible. This AI-powered tool allows you to:\n\nSeparate subjects from backgrounds\n\nRemove or replace backgrounds with up to four AI-generated scenes at a time\n\nCustomize aesthetics, style, and context using text prompts\n\nAlternatively, consider outsourcing to professional retouching services. Companies like Pixelz and Path offer affordable options, typically ranging from $3 to $5 per image.\n\nStep 8: Optimize images for your website\n\nImage optimization is crucial for both search engine optimization (SEO) and website load speed. Aim for a balance between image quality and file size, with a general target of less than 200 kilobytes per image.\n\nTo optimize your images effectively:\n\nResize for the container\n\nOne way to optimize your image is to resize it to fit your website’s container. For example, if your container is 684 pixels square but your image is 1500 pixels square, the larger image will still load fully, slowing down your site.\n\n1. Figure out the HTML container size\n\nUse your browser’s Developer tools to inspect the image element.\n\nRight-click on the image and choose “Inspect Element.”\n\nThe sidebar will show the container’s pixel dimensions.\n\nPro tip: Resize your image to 1.5 times the container size for retina screens. For a 684-pixel container, aim for a 1026-pixel-square image.\n\n2. Resize the image\n\nUse built-in tools like Mac Preview or Microsoft Picture for easy resizing.\n\nOpen your image in the app.\n\nAdjust the dimensions to fit your container size.\n\nExport and save as a JPEG at 100% quality.\n\n3. Compress the image\n\nAfter resizing, you’ll notice the file size is still large. Smart compression removes unused data without sacrificing quality.\n\nUse Photoshop’s Save For Web function or specialized software like JPEGmini.\n\nThese tools use algorithms to determine optimal compression.\n\nAvoid over-compression, which can make images look blotchy.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nImage size: ~1 to 1.5 times the HTML container size\n\nFormat: JPEG\n\nColorspace: sRGB\n\nCompression: Use JPEGmini or similar tool after export\n\nExpert product photography tips\n\nConsider these tips when taking product photos:\n\nUse window light vs. lightbox\n\nWindow light (natural light) is often preferable because it’s a simple one-light setup, cost-effective, and easy to use. When shooting with a light tent or lightbox, you enter into a multi-light setup, which adds complexity and usually requires more advanced knowledge.\n\nMulti-light setups introduce several challenges:\n\nCost: Lightboxes and additional lighting can be expensive, potentially costing more than hiring a professional.\n\nTechnical knowledge: You’ll need to understand how to balance exposure of different lights and position them properly. This includes learning about f-stops, shutter speeds, and their relationship to lighting.\n\nColor balancing: Each light source has a different color temperature, which can significantly affect your image.\n\nFlash complexity: If using flash instead of continuous light, you’ll face additional challenges with exposure, sync speed, and specialized triggering equipment.\n\nThe quality of light from a light tent is often very even and shadowless. While this might seem ideal, shadows are important for creating product shape and providing a sense of place. Window light often produces more dynamic and interesting images.\n\nLike anything, there are limitations to DIY. Achieving perfect results with challenging products like clear or highly reflective items typically requires a multi-light studio setup and a deep technical knowledge.\n\nUse foam boards\n\nFoam boards are versatile and essential tools for controlling light in product photography:\n\nWhite foam boards: Use these to reflect light back into shadows, brightening up the darker side of your product.\n\nBlack foam boards: These can deepen shadows, particularly useful when shooting white products on a white background.\n\nCombining boards: Use white bounce cards in front and black bounce cards behind the product for a more sophisticated lighting setup.\n\nFoam boards are ideal because they’re rigid and easy to position. You can purchase them on Amazon or at local drug stores. In a pinch, white printer paper or poster board can serve as alternatives.\n\nLearn basic photo editing techniques\n\nMastering photo editing skills can significantly enhance your product images:\n\nCost-saving: Reduces the need for professional editing services.\n\nControl: Gives you complete authority over the final look of your images.\n\nVersatility: Allows you to repurpose photos for various marketing channels.\n\nStart with Adobe Photoshop Tutorials for accessible lessons applicable to various software. After learning the basics, choose a photo editing software that suits your needs and budget.\n\nShoot multiple angles\n\nProviding various perspectives helps shoppers better understand your products:\n\nEye level: Shows the product straight on, as typically seen.\n\nHigh angle: Displays the product from above.\n\nLow angle: Captures the product from below.\n\nBird’s eye: Offers a top-down view of the product.\n\nKeep your camera and tripod in the same position during the shoot, rotating the product instead. This ensures consistency and reduces post-production editing.\n\nTry other types of product photography\n\nWhile white background shots are essential, consider incorporating other styles to enhance your product presentation:\n\nLifestyle\n\nLifestyle shots help tell the story of your product and show it in context:\n\nUse them for website content, social media, blog posts, and emails.\n\nThey help shoppers envision how and where to use your products.\n\nNotice how Allbirds uses both white background and lifestyle photos on its product pages.\n\nThis approach gives shoppers context for where and how people actually use the products. If you sell hiking boots, show them on someone’s feet during a hike. For selling clothing, show your apparel on someone walking in an appropriate setting.\n\nLearn more: Clothing Photography: Take Beautiful Apparel Photos\n\nDetailed\n\nDetailed images give shoppers a closer look at specific product features:\n\nHighlight unique aspects like zippers, textures, or special materials.\n\nHelp customers understand the quality and craftsmanship of your products.\n\nCheck out how leather retailer hardgraft uses detailed shots to show zippers, handles, and other unique features of its goods on its product pages.\n\nGroup\n\nGroup shots showcase products together, which is particularly useful for:\n\nDisplaying product bundles or kits\n\nShowcasing the variety within a product line\n\nNotice how Beardbrand uses this style to highlight the products offered in their bundles.\n\nConsider hiring help\n\nIf you’ve reached your limitations, professional photography might be a worthwhile investment:\n\nCost: Professional white background photos typically range from $30 to $60 per image.\n\nROI: Better quality photos can significantly increase online sales.\n\nExpertise: Professionals can handle challenging products or complex setups more efficiently.\n\nWrite great product descriptions\n\nPair your photos with compelling product descriptions to create high-converting product pages for your ecommerce store:\n\nProvide comprehensive information about the product.\n\nUse descriptions to influence purchasing decisions.\n\nEnsure your copy complements and enhances your visual content.\n\nMaximizing your product photos\n\nThe best ecommerce sites share a common feature: stunning product photos. While professional ecommerce photography can be expensive, there are numerous product photography tools available to help you create impressive images yourself.\n\nBy following this DIY product photography tutorial, you can produce high-quality images for your online store. As you gain confidence behind the camera, you can explore different types of photography to enhance your product presentation.\n\nThe best part? You’ll have full control over how you build your brand and showcase your products online. When done well, you’ll increase sales and conversions on your website and grow a successful online business. Who knows? You might even develop the skills to sell your own photos online one day.\n\nIllustration by Gracia Lam"
