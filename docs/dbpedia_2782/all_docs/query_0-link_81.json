Search and rescue crews pulled Barnes' body from his first-floor bedroom.\n\nAnother man who lived on Lloyd Road was injured in the EF-3 tornado that tore through the neighborhood Thursday morning. Phil Hawley was hospitalized for a cut on his arm. He was released from the hospital on Saturday.\n\nA woman was killed when a tree fell on her home in Rockingham County, raising the death toll from Debby to at least eight.\n\nIn Lumberton, a woman died in rushing water on Old Whiteville Raoad, according to Lumberton Rescue and EMS.

Downed trees and power lines have been causing problems since Debby's arrival Wednesday.\n\nAs of Thursday morning, there had been 170 lane closures or incidents caused by Debby on state maintained roads, many of which were in Fayetteville, according to the NCDOT. Cooper said Friday that the National Guard and State Highway Patrol (SHP) have been deployed across North Carolina.\n\nThere were two dam breaks Thursday in Cumberland County and Harnett County.\n\nThe road split in half after a dam collapsed in Cumberland County.

According to the National Weather Service, dozens of homes could be impacted, and roads could be closed in the Pines and Cox Ponds areas.
