        "text": "What are the different formats for video?\n\nThese are the industry standard video formats available on modern Canon cameras (not all are available on every model):\n\nMP4 (H.264): MP4 is a container file format, so you will see different MP4 variations. H.264 (or AVC) is the video compression codec most widely used for digital video today, particularly for streaming services, and these files can be played back on almost any device.\n\nMP4 (HEVC): HEVC stands for High Efficiency Video Coding. This codec – also known as H.265 – offers 50% better compression efficiency than H.264, meaning it produces smaller files and requires lower bandwidth while streaming. It is also the first to support 8K resolution.\n\nXF-AVC: This is a file format developed by Canon specifically for 4K DCI or 4K UHD footage. It's suitable for professional workflows, with creatives using it when recording high-resolution footage. The file name extension is .MXF.\n\nRAW: Much as when you capture RAW stills, some Canon cameras enable you to shoot video in RAW. RAW files contain all the colour and tonal information and image detail captured by the sensor, which is hugely useful because it allows more headroom in editing. Videographers value it particularly for capturing the widest dynamic range in a scene, enabling them to make the most of both the highlight and shadow detail in post-production.\n\nCinema RAW Light: RAW format filming has huge advantages, but one challenge is that the file sizes are very large, which can impact on your workflow. A good solution is Canon's Cinema RAW Light, which was introduced with the release of the Canon EOS C200 video camera. This format delivers a vast dynamic range, but dramatically reduces the size of the files. The file name extension is .CRM.\n\nMOV is an alternative container format, convenient for editing your footage on a computer. MOV files offer high quality, with excellent codec options including various lossy and lossless ProRes codecs for high-resolution footage, but the files can be very large. Some Canon DSLRs support shooting video in MOV format, but if you use a modern Canon mirrorless camera, cine camera or camcorder you would shoot in other formats and transcode to MOV if necessary for post-production, or export footage as MOV for delivery if this format is specified.\n\nIn the same way, you might sometimes wish to export to other formats such as WMV (Windows Media Video format) for specific delivery requirements, but all the possible permutations of post-production and delivery workflows are outside our scope here.\n\nRecording size, frame rate and compression\n\nWe've mentioned that there are many variables when it comes to video formats. In addition to selecting a codec and container format, you can choose from a range of settings that will determine the quality of your video and the resulting file sizes, which in turn affect the duration of recording possible on your memory card.\n\nIn your camera menu under Movie rec. size, you can set three important parameters:\n\nRecording size: This is what is usually called resolution in still photography – the number of pixels in each frame. Common settings available are:\n\n4K DCI (4K-D in menus): 4096 x 2160 pixels.\n\n4K UHD (4K-U in menus): 3840 x 2160 pixels.\n\nFull HD (FHD in menus): 1920 x 1080 pixels.\n\nOther options are available on different cameras, particularly pro video cameras, including 8K DCI (8192 x 4320) and 8K UHD (7680 x 4320) on the Canon EOS R5 and EOS R5 C. As you would expect, filming in 4K produces larger file sizes than filming in Full HD, other settings being equal, but normally you would simply select the frame size appropriate for your intended output requirements, or else record at the best available resolution and resize for output later, depending on the post-production options available to you.\n\nFrame rate: This defines how frequently video frames are captured, expressed in frames per second (fps). The options available here depend on what is selected under the general settings in Video system: PAL (Europe) or NTSC (North America and Japan). The standard frame rate is 25fps for PAL or approximately 30fps for NTSC. Footage shot at 50/60fps can be slowed to half-speed slow-motion when played back at 25/30fps in post-production. Higher frame rates such as 100/120fps or sometimes more are available on some cameras for super-slow-motion effects on playback at standard frame rates. You'll notice that most of the settings available end in p, such as 50p, but some end in i, such as 50i or 59.94i. The p stands for Progressive and the i for Interlaced. If it uses interlaced scanning, a display refreshes alternate lines of the image on-screen – first the even-numbered lines, then the odd-numbered lines, then the even-numbered lines again, and so on. This happens so quickly (typically 30 times a second or more) that the eye perceives a complete picture, but each field technically contains only half the image detail. All modern computer screens and TVs, as well as video on the internet, use progressive scanning, where each frame of video contains the entire image. However, broadcast video used to be interlaced as standard, because this delivers higher apparent resolutions even when bandwidth is constrained. Today, 50i is still the Broadcast Standard in Europe, but broadcast video can be either interlaced or progressive. (Modern screens automatically de-interlace any incoming interlaced signals.) Video is now typically shot using progressive settings and converted to interlaced when this is the specified delivery format. If you do use an interlaced setting, note that the quoted number is the field rate, and the frame rate is actually half that number, so 50i is 25fps and 59.94i is 29.97fps.\n\nCompression method: In addition to the codec used to encode and decode the video, you can often select a compression method. This does not determine the codec or type of compression used, but rather specifies how the codec is to be applied:\n\nAll-I: the I stands for Intraframe, and in this method each individual frame is compressed, one at a time. This does not produce file sizes as small as the other methods available, but potentially results in better quality, which is ideal for editing in particular – because there is more picture information, the files can withstand more extensive editing in post-production.\n\nIPB (Standard): also known as GOP (Group of Pictures), this method analyses one keyframe (the I frame) and subsequently records only the differences between frames instead of the full picture information for each frame. It does this using two methods: P frames (Predicted frames), which record what has changed from the previous frame, and B frames (Bi-directional predicted frames), which can reference picture information in both the previous and subsequent frames. Each I frame may be followed by a variable number of P and B frames. Depending on how much stays the same between frames, this method can result in significant file size savings.\n\nIPB (Light): this method uses the same principles as IPB (Standard) but records the video at a lower bit rate (more about this shortly). As a result, the file sizes will be smaller and the playback compatibility will be higher.\n\nLong GOP: this generally refers to an extended Group of Pictures (more than 15 frames). Long GOP is the term usually used on Cinema EOS cameras for the inter-frame compression method; on EOS hybrid cameras, the usual term is IPB. The two are basically the same method, but they differ in the number of frames in the GOP – Long GOP has more P and B frames to one I frame, meaning file sizes are smaller but the video quality is lower, although this may not be very noticeable at lower resolutions."
