        "text": "21 Genuinely Surprising Culture Shocks That People Only Experienced After Relocating To A Brand New Country\n\n\"After experiencing this, it’s very hard to go back to any other culture.\"\n\nIf you've ever traveled somewhere new, you've probably noticed some cultural norms that are totally different from back home. Now imagine picking up your life and moving from one country to another. The culture shock is very real! So redditor u/queeenlux asked, \"What was the most major cultural difference you noticed when you moved to another country?\" Here's what people said, including some members of the BuzzFeed Community.\n\n1. \"When you enter a store in Germany, you open the door to silence or a brief hello. When you enter a store in the US it's, 'Hello! How are you today? What can I do for you?' That was way too much communication.\"\n\n2. \"Moving from Spain to the US, one of the biggest cultural differences I noticed was how people here are way more focused on work and less on socializing. In Spain, we have long lunches and siestas, and people spend more time with family and friends. It feels like everyone is always in a rush and working long hours here.\"\n\n—u/sweeeetsofia\n\n3. \"When I was in Copenhagen, I tried to get food at 9:30 p.m., but literally no place within walking distance of our hotel was open. It was strange because I'm so used to having access to food around the clock.\"\n\n4. \"I moved to Italy when I was 10, and my mom would give me money to buy candy. The candy I chose had a not-so-insignificant amount of alcohol in it — which didn't stop anyone from selling it to a 10-year-old child.\"\n\n5. \"Realizing that jaywalking in Vietnam is basically an extreme sport.\"\n\n—u/thickxolivia\n\n6. \"The food culture in France. No one hurries you out of the restaurant. You can sit there and enjoy your food and friend's company for as long as you want.\"\n\n7. \"When I relocated from Germany to the US, the sheer scale of everything made a lasting impression. Roads, cars, buildings, supermarkets — they're all massive compared to what I'm used to! It was a bit overwhelming initially.\"\n\n—u/MintPeachy\n\n8. \"The biggest cultural difference was discovering that it's perfectly normal in Italy to eat dinner at 10 p.m. My stomach was on a strict early dinner schedule and unprepared for this late-night culinary norm.\"\n\n9. \"When I moved to Italy, one of the biggest cultural differences I noticed was how people perceive time. Being a bit late to a meeting or social event is totally normal and not seen as rude at all in Italy. Meanwhile, back home, punctuality was super strict. Adapting to a more relaxed attitude towards time took some getting used to. It’s a nice change, though — it’s all about enjoying the moment and not stressing over the clock!\"\n\n—u/kymitona\n\n10. \"Hailing from South Africa and moving to Denmark, I was utterly shocked by folks leaving laptops completely unattended and unlocked in cafes. I nearly had a heart attack on their behalf.\"\n\n11. \"I moved from Switzerland to the US, and I was shocked by the scale and the distance between everything. Traveling within the US is incredibly difficult if you don't have a vehicle, whereas I could hop on a train or bus (both of which were always punctual) and be in a different country for less than the cost of a tank of gas in the US. Public transport was affordable and efficient, completely negating the need for a vehicle.\"\n\n—u/verhunt\n\n12. \"In Japan, the concept of personal space on public transport doesn't exist during rush hour. It's like a game of human Tetris.\"\n\n13. \"I moved to New England and was shocked by how different the trees looked. I'd drive through the highways in New Hampshire during the fall and see all those colors in the trees. It was like I was driving inside a painting.\"\n\n—u/sirtuinsenolytic\n\n14. \"I moved to Norway for three years, and as a female, it was like living in 'easy mode.' Outside alone after dark? No worries. Camping alone in the woods? It is perfectly safe and encouraged. After experiencing this kind of safety, it's hard to return to other cultures.\"\n\n15. \"Growing up American, I was spoiled by being able to cool down whenever I wanted to easily. I could turn on the AC or order a glass of ice water. Then I moved to Europe, and it was like, 'You want ice? In water? Why?' and 'No, no AC. It is very ugly and wastes energy. Try opening a window.'\"\n\n—u/varthalon\n\n16. \"The cost of healthcare. I'm a diabetic, and I moved to Belgium. Here, insulin is free with no actual limit on boxes; needles are $14 per but a free box twice a year. Glucose test strips are free, as are dietician consultations. I have severe back issues and have had nine hospital visits this year so far. I've had x-rays and scans but still haven't seen a bill. And when I do it, it will be about €75.\"\n\n17. \"I'm American, but living in England was the first time I found that people could be comfortable not being high achievers and constantly pushing, pushing, pushing to be the best at everything all the time. It was okay just to be normal. I loved it.\"\n\n—u/ConcertinaTerpsichor\n\n18. \"The fact that everyone in Japan seems to care about the quality of the city and the wellbeing of others. I often see people walk many blocks with their trash in a plastic bag until they find a bin. I lost my wallet and got it back with all the money inside. People clean up after concerts they didn't even attend. And everywhere you go, it feels safe to walk at night or let kids commute alone on the subway during the day.\"\n\n19. \"When I moved from Europe to the States, the sheer variety of accents and dialects amazed me! I thought I had a good handle on English, but I found myself asking people to repeat themselves quite a bit. It was like learning new versions of the same language all over again.\"\n\n—u/DandelionDance1\n\n20. \"Going to the cinema in Japan was certainly an experience. It's so quiet you could hear a pin drop. There was no rustling of butts in seats, crinkling of snack packaging, shoes scuffing on the floor; no sounds of popcorn being crunched (a skill I found most impressive, but also rather disturbing), no reaction from the audience like laughter during funny scenes. I was the only one who barked out a laugh and immediately shut my mouth when I realized I was the only one who did and felt the person sitting next to me give me the side eye. Honestly, it didn't make for a great movie-watching experience. Part of why I like going to the cinema is to commiserate, laugh, scoff, sigh, and cry with my fellow moviegoers.\"\n\n21. \"Everyone calling me honey/love/sweetie in the US. Those words and terms of endearment aren’t used that casually over here in the Netherlands.\"\n\n—u/Pale-Assistant-9561\n\nDo you have one to add?
