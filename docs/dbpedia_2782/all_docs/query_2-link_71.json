        "text": "What are grief and loss?\n\nGrief is the natural emotional response to the loss of someone close, such as a family member or friend. Grief can also occur after a serious illness, divorce or other significant loss.\n\nGrief often involves intense sadness and feelings of shock and numbness. You may even have feelings of denial and anger.\n\nFor most people, the intensity of grief eases over time and the episodes of expressed grief (like crying) become less frequent.\n\nGrief is a process or journey that affects everyone differently. It can be exhausting and emotionally draining. This can make it hard to do simple things, or even leave the house. Some people cope by becoming more active.\n\nGrief has no set pattern. It’s expressed differently across different cultures. Some people like to be expressive and public with their emotions, while others like to keep their feelings private.\n\nAfter losing a loved one, you may always carry sadness and miss the person who has died. But most people are able to find meaning and experience pleasure again. Some people even find new wisdom and strength after loss.\n\nVideo provided by CarerHelp — Chris Hall: Tips for managing grief.\n\nAre there different types of grief and loss?\n\nGrief is usually described in relation to the death of a loved one, but other types of major loss can also lead to feelings of grief. The more significant a loss, the more intense your grief may be.\n\nPeople may feel grief over:\n\nThe death of a loved one (also called bereavement) — grief can be particularly severe following the death of an infant or child, or a suicide.\n\nThe diagnosis of a serious or terminal illness.\n\nThe loss of good health because of an illness, accident or disability.\n\nMiscarriage or infertility.\n\nHaving a child with a disability, a terminal illness, a mental illness or a substance abuse problem.\n\nThe loss of a beloved pet.\n\nYou may also grieve after:\n\nDivorce, separation or a relationship breakdown.\n\nGiving up something that mattered.\n\nWork changes — for example, unemployment, retirement or retrenchment\n\nMoving away or separation from family or friends.\n\nHaving an ‘empty nest’ when your children leave home.\n\nWhat are the effects of grief?\n\nYou may have intense feelings of grief. This can feel overwhelming, making it seem hard or even impossible to think about anything else. For some people, these feelings or thoughts may be so difficult to deal with that they push them down or mask them, either all or some of the time.\n\nThe effects of grief can often resemble depression. Some people do develop depression following a significant loss. If you are dealing with a major loss and finding it difficult to cope, see your doctor.\n\nImmediately after a death, those left behind often feel shocked, numb and in denial, particularly if the death was unexpected.\n\nWhen they begin to understand the reality of death, they can feel intensely sad, empty or lonely, and sometimes angry or guilty.\n\nThe feelings can be painful, constant or overwhelming. Grief can come in waves, seeming to fade in intensity for a while before returning.\n\nYou might feel or act differently to usual when you are grieving. You might withdraw and not enjoy your usual activities.\n\nSome people drink alcohol, smoke or use drugs. Some people may also have thoughts of hurting themselves or that they can’t go on.\n\nIf you need to talk to someone about your mental health, call Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636.\n\nEmotions and thinking\n\nEverybody reacts to grief differently. Common feelings include:\n\nsadness\n\nshock\n\ndenial\n\nnumbness, a sense of unreality\n\nanger\n\nguilt\n\nblame\n\nrelief\n\nSome people may:\n\nhave trouble concentrating\n\nhave vivid dreams or nightmares\n\nPhysical health\n\nGrief can be exhausting, and this may weaken your immune system. This can make you more prone to colds and other illnesses.\n\nGrief can affect your appetite and lead to changes in weight. It can affect sleep and leave people feeling very tired. It can also lead to:\n\nstomach aches\n\nheadaches\n\nbody aches\n\nSpiritual life\n\nPeople who are grieving often search for meaning and examine their spiritual beliefs.\n\nPost-traumatic growth\n\nSome people have positive experiences following grief and loss, such as different connections or a new sense of wisdom, maturity or meaning in life.\n\nComplicated grief and depression\n\nIn some people, grief can be prolonged or more intense. This may interfere with your ability to cope and function in everyday life. It may be more likely if the loss was particularly traumatic, such as a suicide or death of a child.\n\nProlonged grief (also referred to as complex or complicated grief) is a persistent form of intense grief. People find it very difficult to live with the loss.\n\nInstead of the grief intensity gradually easing, your thoughts may become stuck in a dark, sorrowful place. Some people describe this time as being emotionally paralysed and unable to think past the grief and loss. They feel very lost and alone.\n\nIn this state, it is common to:\n\nfeel confused\n\nfeel a sense of overwhelming sadness\n\nhave more extreme thoughts and behaviours, which may or may not be linked to the experience\n\nhave an ongoing longing for the past\n\nSomeone with prolonged grief may have a fixed preoccupation with thoughts and memories of the person who died, making the future seem empty and hopeless.\n\nWhen should I seek help for my grief?\n\nIf you have persistent feelings of sadness and despair and are unable to feel content, you may be experiencing depression. If your feelings are getting in the way of your everyday life, then it’s important to get help.\n\nFor some people, grief might not lessen even after time passes. The grief can significantly disrupt your life, affecting jobs, relationships and how you interact in the community.\n\nYou may need to get help if you:\n\nfeel like grief makes it very difficult to do anything\n\nhave difficulty socialising\n\nhave difficulty sleeping\n\nhave changed the way you eat (lost your appetite or are over-eating)\n\nhave intense and ongoing emotions such as anger, sadness, numbness, anxiety, depression, despair, emptiness or guilt\n\nhave thoughts of harming yourself\n\nIf you, or someone you know, is having suicidal thoughts and is in immediate danger, call triple zero (000).

Avoid recreational drugs and drink alcohol sensibly.\n\nExperiencing anniversaries\n\nBirthdays, anniversaries or holidays can trigger intense feelings of grief. It may help to mark these occasions with a simple ceremony like lighting a candle, playing music or gathering with family.\n\nHow can I support a grieving loved one?\n\nInitiate contact\n\nGet in touch and be available to spend time together. Respect that your friend may need to cry, hug, talk, be silent or be alone.\n\nListen\n\nIt can be difficult to know what to say, particularly if you have not experienced grief before. There may be no words that can really help, but listening can be a great support.\n\nDon’t be afraid to talk about the person who has died — the person you are supporting may want to hear their name.\n\nTry to avoid giving advice or using clichés. It’s more meaningful to say something like “I’m so sorry it’s such a difficult time” than give advice.\n\nDo something together\n\nSpend some time doing ordinary and positive things together, like watching a movie, going for a walk or having a meal.\n\nPractical help\n\nCooking meals or looking after children can be a great gift to people dealing with grief.\n\nBe aware\n\nGrief may last for a long time. Birthdays and anniversaries may be difficult for a bereaved person, so calling them on that day can let them know you haven’t forgotten.\n\nOther questions you might have\n\nHow long does grief last?\n\nEvery person grieves differently and there is no set timeframe for how long grief may last. Some people may mourn for 6 months, others for several years.\n\nThere are many factors involved in how long grief may last. It’s important to give yourself time to grieve and not feel rushed to ‘move on’ before you’re ready.\n\nHow do I move on?\n\nThe term ‘moving on’ can be unhelpful, because as life moves forward you need to move with it. As each day goes by you are moving forward, but the phrase moving on can feel as though you need to get over your grief.\n\nIt’s important to remember that moving on does not mean forgetting but learning how to live without that person in your life. Moving on doesn’t mean that your grief will end, but that you will learn to live with it.\n\nResources and support\n\nFor more information and support:\n\nLifeline offers 24-hour crisis support.
