        "text": "Types of Long Shots\n\nLong Shots and Extreme Long Shots\n\nBefore you consider why or how you might use an extreme long shot, you need to be super clear about what this shot looks like when compared to the long shot. Although both shots function in very similar ways, knowing which one to use and when will enhance the meaning and nuances of your story.\n\nLONG SHOT DEFINITION\n\nWhat is a Long Shot?\n\nA long shot is a camera shot that shows the entire subject from head to toe and places that subject in relation to their surroundings. The long shot is also called a “wide shot” or “full shot” and it’s used to show the relationship between characters and their environment.\n\nWhy is a long shot used? Since long shots incorporate so much background in a scene, they're commonly used to establish setting, mood, and characters' relationship to their physical space.\n\nDirector David Fincher’s use of the wide shot in the final scene of Fight Club, for instance, establishes a new relationship between the Narrator (Edward Norton) and Marla (Helena Bonham Carter) as the movie reaches its climax.\n\nJuxtaposing these characters' new relationship with the world that crumbles around them adds power to the scene.\n\nWide shot in the final scene of Fight Club\n\nThe video below breaks down what a true wide shot is, offering examples of how extreme long shots are used in movies to setup a scene and even, occasionally, for comedic purposes.\n\nWhat does an extreme long shot look like?\n\nBoth long shots and extreme long shots are commonly used to establish story. Knowing when and how to use an establishing shot is another animal, but getting comfortable with the extreme long shot is a critical next step.\n\nExtreme Long Shot Definition\n\nWhat is an Extreme Long Shot?\n\nAn extreme long shot (abbreviated as ELS) is a long shot that covers a wider area. It is also known as an extreme wide shot (EWS). The shot frames the subject from a distance and focuses on its surroundings. Remember: In a long shot, the character is usually still noticeable in the frame. But in an ELS, it’s not always necessary to see the character. The ELS or EWS functions best as an establishing shot, as more of the location is in the frame.\n\nQuentin Tarantino is one filmmaker who certainly doesn’t shy away from extreme wide shots. Here’s the opening shot of his 2009 film, Inglourious Basterds...\n\nTarantino loves extreme wide shots\n\n...and here's the full sequence.\n\nExtreme long shot film example: Inglourious Basterds Opening Scene\n\nDirector George Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road features some stunning visuals throughout its epic car chase—many of which are framed with extreme wide shots. What made these shots possible, however, wasn’t a script: The movie action was planned out solely on storyboards.\n\nWe threw a scene into StudioBinder's shot list and storyboarding software to show you how you might take Miller's approach. Notice the extreme wide shot in the first frame.\n\nSee how the extreme wide shot is worked into the full shot list\n\nIf you’ve seen Mad Max: Fury Road, you know that the film has a ton of extreme wide shots. Each shot clearly conveys the sense of danger that pervades the landscape of the film, and that's what allows audiences to experience the vastness of the Namibian desert.\n\nUltimately, extreme wide shots are what place audiences smack in the middle of your film's world. We quite literally wouldn't know where we'd be without them.\n\nCamera Shots\n\nGet Inspired. Explore More Shots.\n\nMaster every shot size, and learn how to combine them with angles and movements to take your filmmaking to the next level.\n\nClose Up Shots\n\nExtreme Close Up (ECU)\n\nClose Up (CU)\n\nMedium Close Up (MCU)\n\nMedium Shots\n\nMedium Shot (MS)\n\nCowboy Shot (CS)\n\nMedium Full Shot (MFS)\n\nWide Shots\n\nFull Shot (FS)\n\nWide Shot (WS)\n\nExtreme Wide Shot (EWS)\n\nUp Next\n\nDefining the Establishing Shot\n\nAn establishing shot is what provides audiences with the context of your story through location, time, place, mood, and usually, character. Next, we'll look at some examples of creative establishing shots in movies you love, and walk through what to consider before shooting yours.\n\nUp Next: What's an Establishing Shot? →"
