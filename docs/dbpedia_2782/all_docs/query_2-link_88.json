        "text": "AMARILLO, Texas (KFDA) - With the Olympic Games going on, gold is always on the minds of the athletes. Here in Amarillo, our Fuller and Sons Crew doesn’t care about individual awards.\n\nThis week’s clean up takes aim at an area of the city in need, and this effort was good as gold.\n\nThe crew gives a thumbs up for this clean up in the Eastridge neighborhood, so let the cleaning begin!\n\nIt’s hot as blazes in August, but a boxed up Christmas tree headed to the dump is kind of sad.\n\nThe crew tried to beat the heat on this August day, so they were out early working the alleys and finding all kinds of stuff. It seemed mattresses were a popular item to be discarded by the neighborhood, even at the busy intersection of N Mirror Street and NE 24th Avenue!\n\nIt was back into the alleys looking for more stuff deemed “not worthy.”\n\nThe Fuller and Son’s crew probably never thought this dump would be a shattering experience, but a glass screen door presented a challenge. Fortunately, there were no cuts!\n\nAfter working the alleys along Evergreen Street between Goldenrod Street and Heather Street, the crew hit the alley between Heather Street and Iris Street.\n\nThe Fuller and Son’s crew made a run to the roll-offs at Eastridge Elementary to unload.\n\nAll in all, another robust effort by the Fuller and Sons crew to help keep Amarillo beautiful.\n\nIf you know of a neighborhood in the city that needs attention, let us know here.\n\nA friendly reminder: the roll-offs are not for commercial use. They are reserved for residential use.\n\nRemember, it takes all of us to keep and make Amarillo beautiful."
