        "text": "HOUSTON (KHOU) - A middle school teacher from Houston is being called a hero after he saved a 15-year-old girl who was being sexually assaulted by confronting and scaring off her attacker.\n\nHarris County Sheriff’s Office investigators say the incident happened just before midnight last Sunday on Houston’s east side. Dramatic video shows David Garza, a middle school teacher, rush out of his apartment and into action after he says he heard a young girl yelling for help.\n\n“I looked out the window, and I saw a man beating up a woman on the ground. He was trying to take her clothes off,” Garza said.\n\nHe says he didn’t think twice about going to get his gun and confronting the attacker.\n\n“I ran upstairs and grabbed my pistol. Then, I came outside and asked what’s going on. The girl screamed, ‘I’m 15. Help me.’ So, I pointed my gun at him,” Garza said.\n\nGarza says the suspect had the victim by the hair.\n\n“He took his hands off right away. He went chasing after her, so I went chasing after him. She got away. She went to someone she knew’s apartment,” he said.\n\nA neighbor says she believes Garza saved the teenager from what could have been a tragedy. She says she saw the incident from her window.\n\n“At first, I was scared because I literally thought she was about to get raped. I think if he didn’t come out, she probably would have gotten raped,” she said.\n\nInvestigators say the 15-year-old victim was on the bus with the suspect. When she got off the bus, he followed her across the street and into an apartment complex, where he attacked her. A neighbor who knows the teen says she was heading to see a friend.\n\nInvestigators are now searching for the suspect.\n\nWhile Garza is being hailed as a hero, the teacher himself says he just did the right thing. He also says this wasn’t the first time he chased a man who was trying to harm a child.\n\n“I was scared, too. I’m not going to lie, but she needed help more than I was afraid, so I had to do it,” he said.\n\nAndy Kahan, a victim advocate for Crime Stoppers, says he’s grateful for Garza’s quick-thinking and actions.\n\n“With that, I take my hat off to you,” he said.\n\nHe adds that the suspect needs to be caught before he potentially attacks someone else.\n\n“If you’re willing to do this where everybody is and people can actually see what you’re doing, that makes me wonder: A. Is this your first time? B. We need to get you off the streets before you continue to hurt young girls again,” Kahan said.\n\nInvestigators have released a photo of the suspect. He was wearing a black hoodie with a white Reebok logo, blue jeans and white tennis shoes at the time of the attack. Anyone with information about his identity or whereabouts is asked to call Crime Stoppers."
