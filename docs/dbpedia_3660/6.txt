Cheech and Chong's song "Born In East L.A." is a satirical take on the complexities of identity and immigration in the United States. The song tells the story of a man, played by Cheech Marin, who is mistakenly deported to Mexico despite being born and raised in East Los Angeles. The narrative begins with a simple errand to the corner store, which quickly escalates when an immigration officer, played by Tommy Chong, questions Cheech's citizenship. The humor is evident as Cheech's character misunderstands the officer's questions, leading to a series of comedic exchanges that highlight the absurdity of the situation.

The song uses humor to address serious issues such as racial profiling and the challenges faced by immigrants. Cheech's character is asked to prove his American identity through stereotypical questions, such as naming the President of the United States. His incorrect answer, "John Wayne," adds to the comedic element while also pointing out the ignorance and biases that can exist in such interrogations. The song's chorus, "I was BORN IN EAST L.A.," becomes a defiant declaration of identity, emphasizing that being American is not solely about documentation but also about cultural and personal ties to a place.

As the story progresses, Cheech's character finds himself in a foreign land, struggling to navigate a world where he doesn't understand the language or customs. This part of the song poignantly illustrates the immigrant experience, capturing the feelings of displacement and longing for home. The journey back to East L.A. is depicted as a grueling ordeal, symbolizing the hardships many immigrants endure in search of a better life. The song concludes with a triumphant return to East L.A., reinforcing the idea that one's identity and sense of belonging are deeply rooted in their community and experiences.
