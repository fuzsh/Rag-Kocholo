Happy 70th birthday to Cheech Marin of the legendary stoner comedy duo Cheech & Chong. Although his television and film credits are many, many might remember in 1987 he wrote, directed and starred in Born in East L.A., a comedy that’s based on his best-selling record parody. Check out the full on 80’s video for the “Born in East LA” track from the Cheech & Chong 1985 album Get Out of My Room.
