        "text": "How wrong I was to refuse to see the Cheech Marin movie \"Born in East L.A.\" when it was in theaters.\n\nIn my defense, turning a radio hit song into a movie, instead of doing it the other way around, usually is a bad idea (\"Ode to Billy Joe,\" \"The night the lights went out in Georgia\"). And \"Born in East L.A.\" wasn't just a hit song. It was a spoof of a hit song, Bruce Springsteen's \"Born in the USA.\"\n\n\"Born in East L.A.\" is the story of a Hispanic U.S. citizen swept up by immigration authorities by mistake and dropped off in Mexico. Once there, he discovers that coming home isn't so easy for a brown-skinned dude with accented English.\n\nIt's arguably the greatest comedy of all time. At the time, 1987, it was safely fictional. But recent events prove it to have been alarmingly prophetic.\n\nThe Washington Post revealed recently that our increasingly anti-brown-immigrant government has been deporting and revoking the passports of U.S.-born Hispanics. The basis for this action is that some border-county midwives who delivered thousands of babies on this side of the border signed off on a few fraudulent birth certificates for babies born on the other side.\n\nNow our government is trying hard to throw as many of them out with the bathwater as it possibly can. Some are decorated war veterans and first responders. If you are a U.S.-born Hispanic delivered by a midwife around that time in a Texas border county, you could find yourself having to prove your citizenship. And you could find your most valid proof, your birth certificate, to be considered fraudulent until you can prove otherwise, no small task.\n\nThere but for the grace of white privilege go I. I have to wonder if I'd be able to prove that I indeed am native-born.\n\nI know, from my parents and from an aging cardboard-thick piece of paper, that I was born in what is known now as Christus Spohn Hospital Shoreline. The paper lists the date, time, and how much I weighed. And it has two tiny footprints I assume to be mine. I wouldn't blame the nuns who were in charge of Spohn at the time if they had used a standard tiny-footprint stamp for expedience. But I hope not. It's the only proof that I was not born with two left feet.\n\nThis durable hunk of paper was necessary documentation for my first communion and confirmation. I was well into adulthood before learning that it doesn't count as an official government document. But, no worries. The Nueces County Courthouse has my official birth certificate on file. And no one challenges the citizenship of a non-Hispanic white guy named Whitehurst.\n\nIf they did, I have other official government documentation. I have a passport and driver's license, both with photo ID. I also have a non-laminated, paper Social Security card with no photo. It has been through the wash a few times times since I got it in my mid-teens, so the number has faded considerably and it's a good thing I have it memorized.\n\nMany if not most of the border-county-born natives whose citizenship is being challenged have these same forms of documentation. It did not stop their passports from being revoked if they happened to be in Mexico â€” leaving them stranded in what to them is a foreign country where the people speak a language they might not know all that well, if at all.\n\nI'm sure my passport, driver's licence and birth certificate wouldn't hold up if the government were intent that they not hold up. I believe, as I have since I can remember, that my parents are who they say they are and that I am who they say I am. I can't imagine how I'd react if those unchallenged lifelong beliefs were challenged.\n\nSpeaking of beliefs, that thick-paper document with the little footprints was signed and stamped at a Catholic hospital run by nuns, which I'm pretty sure means that to dispute it would be a mortal sin punishable by eternal damnation.\n\nBurning in hell seems like a fitting punishment for challenging the citizenship of a native-born American.\n\nContact Tom Whitehurst Jr. at tom.whitehurst@caller.com, 361-886-3619 or on Twitter @WhitehurstJr."
