        "text": "These are parody and novelty songs that in some way refer to California. Many of them are songs that parody other songs that mention California. Many of these parody specific California Songs using the melody of the original song but with new lyrics, but some use the melody of a song that was not about California and make it a song about California. Some just use the melody of a California song with lyrics that are not about California at all, but they still fit here. A few are cheap political hit jobs intended to criticize the entire state and not the song, but which I found to be amusing anyway.\n\nMost of these are from the main list of songs that mention California, but some, with no link to the artist or band name, are unique to this list (or to one of the lists of cover songs) because I was too lazy to write out all their lyrics and give them a spot on the main page."
