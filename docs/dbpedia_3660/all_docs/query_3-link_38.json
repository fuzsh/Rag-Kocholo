        "text": "OK, I need some help. In \"Cheech and Chong's Next movie\" there was a hilarious scene where Chong was sitting on his motorcyle in the house with the exhaust routed out the window into the Geeky neighbors rose bushes. anyway, during that scene there was a song playing in the background. I like the song, it had a cool vibe to it. I wanna see if I can find that song. Does anyone know what band did that tune? or where I can find it? I think it might be called Hell on Wheels or something like that. i dunno. Please help!!! [img]/images/graemlins/help.gif[/img]\n\nThanks!!!!\n\nRe: Cheech and Chong soundtrack band???\n\nIt could have been something they did. Most of the songs in their movies are written and partially performed by them (mainly Cheech singing). They took pride in trying to nail different styles of music.\n\nRe: Cheech and Chong soundtrack band???\n\nSomeone asked that at IMDB as well.\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080520/\n\nFurther down, you see the cast list - note someone asks about Scott Thompson.\n\nClick his name for his bio, and you see he is also sometimes credited as Veronica Billingsley [img]/images/graemlins/laugh.gif[/img]\n\nRe: Cheech and Chong soundtrack band???\n\nthanks newc! wow, there is someone else out there who likes the tune. I wish I could find out who it was.... it was a rockin tune!\n\nRe: Cheech and Chong soundtrack band???\n\nIf you follow some of the links it does say that Cheech and Chong did write all the songs except one, and I lost the link and don't remember the guy's name or the song [img]/images/graemlins/laugh.gif[/img]\n\nRe: Cheech and Chong soundtrack band???\n\nI belive fight picker was Bruce McCullah (sp) he did that short little guy that was trying to fight with that big bastard in the bar, and kept getting the snot beat out of him. Funny stuff!!! He tried to pick a fight with someone in the pizza place too. \"the jacket's off!!!!\" [img]/images/graemlins/laugh.gif[/img] [img]/images/graemlins/laugh.gif[/img]"
