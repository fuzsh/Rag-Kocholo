        "text": "Super rare audio of Eddie Van Halen and Cheech Marin performing at a charity gig in 1985 has just surfaced!\n\nWhat you’re hearing above is a cassette audience recording of Eddie and Cheech playing cover tunes billed as Van Hey Man! at a charity gig on May 12th, 1985 at the Firestone Fieldhouse at Pepperdine University in Malibu, California. The event was to support MER or Malibu Emergency Room, a charity that created an emergency room for Malibu residents. Eddie and Cheech play a cover of Marvin Gaye’s “Ain’t That Peculiar”, Cheech’s songs “Mexican Americans” and “Born in East La”, and The Troggs’ “Wild Thing”.\n\nA big thanks to Alan Berry from The Tapes Archive who shared the audio with the VHND and Mediaaddict, who originally posted the audio in the Guitars101 forum.\n\nBerry also shared the article posted in the local newspaper. Below is the image. You can also get a closer look at the article HERE."
