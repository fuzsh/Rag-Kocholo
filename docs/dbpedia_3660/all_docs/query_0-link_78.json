        "text": "Cheech and Chong are sitting in what had been a bedroom of a Hollywood cottage, too far apart to comfortably pass a joint to each other – had there been one in the room – but comfortable enough with each other.\n\nThe duo first came to prominence in 1971. Then they followed with a heady run of successful albums and movies, until the mid-1980 s, when they split up over – pick one or all – artistic differences, egos, drugs or just because it was time.\n\nNow, the kings of stoner comedy – the hippie and the lowrider – have reunited for a live concert tour that will run “until one of us needs an operation,” says Tommy Chong, who turned 70 in May.\n\nOn this day, he and Richard “Cheech” Marin, 62 – both wearing T-shirts with marijuana references – are at the headquarters of funnyordie.com. Funnyordie is not their new slogan but Will Ferrell’s Web site dedicated to comic shorts.\n\nEarlier, Cheech and Chong had shot a get-out-the-vote video for the recent election.\n\nThe pair will be roasted Friday at the Comedy Festival in Las Vegas, with a taped (and presumably cleaned-up) version of the show airing Nov. 30 on TBS.\n\n“Roasts are great. It’s like being heckled for money,” says Chong.\n\n“But we get last up,” notes Cheech.\n\nA conversation with the pair is a combination of watching a couple of pros knocking a tennis ball back and forth and listening to an old married couple.\n\nGetting back together has been a slow, painful process for the duo, who will be in L.A. at the Gibson Amphitheatre on Dec. 6.\n\n“We were always aware of what each other was doing. And over the years, we got in touch and tried to do something, and it would fall apart for one thing or the other. We would argue. Tommy would go to jail. I was working on a series. … There were a lot of misconnections,” says Cheech.\n\nThe jail reference is to Chong’s nine-month federal prison sentence in 2003 for selling drug (bong) paraphernalia from a Web site. After their breakup, the Canada-born Chong did mostly stand-up, with a few acting roles, including a gig on “That ’70 s Show” as – what else? – an aging stoner. Recently, he wrote two best-selling books, “The I Chong” and “Cheech & Chong: The Unauthorized Autobiography.”\n\nCheech moved from comedy to a career as an actor, co-starring in the long-running series “Nash Bridges” and appearing in movies like “Desperado” and doing voice-overs in animated films like “The Lion King.” In January, he will play a priest in a Hallmark Channel movie.\n\nThe son of a police officer, Cheech moved to Granada Hills at 10 and, as a kid, delivered the Green Sheet, the precursor to the Daily News.\n\nHis lowrider character came from a brief encounter with a guy who picked him up when he was hitchhiking in the eighth or ninth grade.\n\nOver the past seven years, he has toured the country with his Chicano art. “Los Angelenos, Chicano Painters of L.A.: Selections From the Cheech Marin Collection” ended its run at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art earlier this month.\n\nOne of the last things Cheech and Chong did together was the novelty hit song “Born in East L.A.” (based on Bruce Springsteen’s “Born in the U.S.A.”), which is something they finally (and happily) get to do together on stage. (Last week, it was announced that their “Light Up America” tour is being turned into a documentary.)\n\nThough neither thinks comedy has changed much since their heyday, both note some differences.\n\n“It’s not so racial. I think we went through a Chris Rock period,” says Chong.\n\nThe pair first met in the late 1960 s in British Columbia, where Chong had an improvisational group at a topless bar in Vancouver.\n\n“In a sense,” say Cheech, “what it was was hippie burlesque. We added sex and drugs and rock ‘n’ roll. … It was actually guerrilla theater. You never knew which way the audience would go because they liked to watch naked girls.”\n\nThe problem, says Chong, was that they eventually started to attract a theater audience who “sipped tea and replaced the 20 biker alcoholics they needed to pay the rent.” So his brother, who owned the club, fired them. But he and Cheech kept going, developing their act.\n\n“Chaplin couldn’t make it big until he found the tramp,” says Chong. “Everybody loved that character because they could look down on him. That’s what happened to Cheech and me. I played the hippie, and he played the lowrider Chicano. You can’t get any lower than that. … The characters we do are just for Cheech and Chong, and they couldn’t be done with anyone else.”\n\nCheech calls their reunion “amazing. We virtually had no rehearsal. We sat down across the table and talked it over, and we went on stage. It’s like we hadn’t been away for half an hour. You know how when you have a tattoo taken off with a laser, and you have a scar that looks like the tattoo? That’s kind of like our connection.”\n\nWhile Cheech and Chong are still riffing off the same bits and songs, their audience is not necessarily the same.\n\nCheech says some 80 percent of their audience now is between 30 and 40 – not old enough to have seen them on stage.\n\n“They grew up with us,” adds Chong. “We’re really a signpost. They really don’t want to hear any political (expletive), they just want to hear the voices. And that’s like a good golden-oldies show.”\n\nRob Lowman, (818) 713-3687, robert.lowman@dailynews.com\n\nCHEECH AND CHONG\n\nWhere: Gibson Amphitheatre at Universal CityWalk, 100 Universal City Plaza, Universal City.\n\nWhen: 8:15 p.m. Dec. 6.\n\nTickets: $40.50 to $60.50."
