The song reached No. 48 on the Billboard Hot 100.[3]\n\nWritten by Cheech Marin, the song's lyrics deal with a Mexican-American from East Los Angeles who is mistaken for an undocumented immigrant and deported. The song served as the basis for the film of the same name, directed by Marin.\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nCheech Marin wrote the song without his comedy partner Tommy Chong, although Chong was credited for the song's writing on the album and single.[1] Chong was subsequently insulted when Marin asked him to perform backup vocals on the song, and it was recorded without Chong.[1] It is one of only two Cheech & Chong songs written solely by one member of the duo and not in collaboration, the other being Tommy Chong's \"Up in Smoke\".[1]\n\nMusic video\n\n[edit]\n\nA music video for the song was produced and appeared in the home video release Get Out of My Room.[4] The video featured appearances from Cassandra Peterson as Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, Jan-Michael Vincent, Ángel Ramírez and Sal Lopez.\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nThe song was released as Springsteen's \"Born in the U.S.A.\" tour was ending, missing the top 40 on the US pop chart.[5] The subsequently released music video became popular.[6]\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]\n\nChart (1985) Peak position US Billboard Hot 100 48 Australian (Kent Music Report) 53[7]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nThe song served as the basis for the film Born in East L.A., directed by Marin, which also starred the role alongside Paul Rodriguez, Daniel Stern, Kamala Lopez-Dawson, Jan-Michael Vincent and Lupe Ontiveros. The film debuted well in its first week but dropped by 40% in its second week at the box office.[8]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nDeath Valley Days, a show which featured then actor Ronald Reagan, who the protagonist of the song confuses for John Wayne when asked who the President is."
