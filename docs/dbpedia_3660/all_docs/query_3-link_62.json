        "text": "Songs with body parts in the title. That is the theme we are working on here on My Lost Treasure. I am pretty sure I would never have thought of this one on my own, but I was thrilled to see that somebody did. This suggestion came from my former coworker and facebook friend Chris Donahue.\n\nWhat better way to kick off the weekend than with a laugh? And I always laugh when I hear Cheech and Chong. I had forgotten all about this song, but it's perfect for our theme. It mentions two body parts in the title. I decided to go with the version from the movie Up In Smoke. It's shorter than the album version, but the video is so great I just had to use it.\n\nThanks for the great request Chris. keep them coming. You can email me at robyn@wpdh.com, find me on facebook, or use the comment section below. have a great weekend!"
