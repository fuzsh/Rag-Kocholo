Cause I was born in East L.A, ole I crawled under barbed wire, swam across a stream Rode in six different trucks packed like a sardine Walked all day in the burning sun Now I know what it's like to be born to run Up ahead was the promised land Shining like a star just beyond my hand All I could see was a golden door I looked up, a sign said five billion sold And I was back in East L.A Yes, I was back in East L.A You know I'm never gonna stray Cause I was born in East L.A, oh L.A East L.A\n\nThe easy, fast & fun way to learn how to sing: 30DaySinger.com\n\n1 fan\n\nSheet Music PDF Playlist\n\nWritten by: BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN, RICHARD MARIN\n\nLyrics © Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC\n\nLyrics Licensed & Provided by LyricFind"
