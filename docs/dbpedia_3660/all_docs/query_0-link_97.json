        "text": "They were the Martin and Lewis of marijuana, regarded as perhaps the funniest duo of the 1970s. But like that of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, their collaboration ultimately went up in smoke.\n\nThough the demise of Cheech & Chong wasn’t nearly as contentious as the breakup of singer-actor-Rat Packer Martin and zany actor comedian Lewis, the performers engaged in one last public hissing match before finally patching things up earlier this year. Now, differences aside, they’re back on stage with a show that features many of their best-loved bits. The show comes Sunday to the San Jose Center for the Performing Arts.\n\n“The thing we argued least about was the stage show,” Cheech Marin says by phone from his home in Malibu. “We figured if we’re going to do it, we’d better do it now. We’re calling this ‘The Catch ’em Before They Croak Tour.’ “\n\nMuch to the delight of fans, Marin, 62, and Tommy Chong, 70, are reviving the kinds of sketches that made many of their comedy discs bestsellers. They dust off their silliest musical numbers, such as “Mexican Americans,” and “Me and My Old Lady” and re-enact scenes from their movie “Up in Smoke” or revisit characters such as Marin’s creaky bluesman Blind Melon Chitlin.\n\n“The shows have been so magical,” Chong says. “I’ve never been involved in anything where we’re getting sometimes four or five standing ovations. People are just so appreciative that we found the time to give them exactly what they wanted.”\n\nThough much is made about the pair’s stoner personas (Chong spent nine months in jail for selling drug paraphernalia on the Internet), their humor isn’t all ganja-centric. Many of their most popular bits — “Sister Mary Elephant,” which pokes fun at a despotic Catholic school nun, and “Basketball Jones,” which was adopted as a round-ball anthem — are not so heavily blunted.\n\nLike great comedy tandems with roots in vaudeville, Cheech & Chong polished their routines on stage, with audiences indicating just what worked and what didn’t. They initially were part of City Works, a Vancouver sketch-comedy troupe akin to Second City in Chicago and the Committee in San Francisco. Later they toured, released comedy albums and, by the late ’70s, starred in their own movies.\n\nAs tastes changed and their popularity waned in the ’80s, the two began pursuing solo careers. Marin starred in “Born in East L.A.,” a 1987 film that borrowed its theme song from Cheech & Chong’s “Get Out of My Room” disc. He landed major roles in the TV series “Nash Bridges” and several Robert Rodriguez films (including “Desperado”). He also became a collector of Chicano art.\n\nChong continued to play endearingly clownish stoners, especially in a stand-up show that featured his wife, Shelby Chong (who is part of Cheech & Chong’s reunion shows). He, too, landed TV gigs, including a recurring role on “That ’70s Show.”\n\nIn recent years, the two came close to reuniting but undermined the chance by calling out one another in the press. Chong took a shot at Marin’s appearance in a Target store TV commercial, tagging his former compadre as a “professional Mexican” and a ”sellout.” Marin, who was directing the Broadway production of “Latinologues,” responded in the New York Daily News: “Gramps is a little old,” he was quoted as saying. “It’s so sad when stoners get to the AARP age, you know?”\n\nChong says, “We’re improvisational players. We act, and we react to any situation. What you saw publicly, when we were at odds with each other, you see in improvisational acting. You’re reacting to the reality of life, and we just took that into our personal life.”\n\nSetting differences aside, the two earlier this year plunged into informal rehearsals in the backyard of Chong’s Pacific Palisades home. The first routine they tried — one with two guys in a car from “Up in Smoke” — convinced Marin the act would fly.\n\n“We just started doing the bit — it was like muscle memories,” Marin recalls. “And we only did it once or twice before we went onstage with it.”\n\nThough the two have demonstrated plenty of versatility, Chong knows what fans want: familiar routines that express a certain affinity for the locoweed. Cheech & Chong are only too happy to oblige.\n\n“If you’re John Wayne,” Chong says, “you’ve got to wear that cowboy hat.”"
