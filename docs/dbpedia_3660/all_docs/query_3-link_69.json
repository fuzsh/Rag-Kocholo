        "text": "Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong light one up and get serious in their new documentary called Cheech and Chong’s Last Movie. The film, directed by David Bushell, will premiere at the SXSW Film and TV Festival. It will give fans an inside look at their career, and personal lives, including their ups and downs.\n\nBushell originally approached the comedic duo about a reunion film but eventually settled on a documentary. It follows Cheech and Chong growing up and eventually their introduction and decision to go into comedy together in the late 1960s. Their film Up in Smoke secured them as comedic stars and led to their long and successful career.\n\nMarin joked about participating in the documentary, “It was one of the conditions of my parole: Court mandated confession.” Bushell interviewed them separately over the course of three days each and used images, audio, video, and old interviews from their history. The documentary even explores their professional breakup in the ’80s.\n\nMarin added, “These are conversations that Tommy and I have had before because we went through a long breakup period and then came back and then broke up again. It happened probably two or three times during our career because it’s hard to maintain a partnership, especially if you have two very creative and hardheaded guys. The most important thing for me, that I got out of this process, is that everybody got to say their piece, and nobody died.”\n\nChong added that they ultimately decided to allow some of their rough past in the doc because “When you’re watching something that’s beautiful and safe and comfy, after a while you either fall asleep or you walk out bored.” Hopefully, the film will be available for audiences soon!"
