Lyrics

(Cheech:) Took a walk to the corner store Just to buy a loaf of bread and a box of s'mores Up pulled a guy in a yellow van Shiny gold badge flashing in his hand (Chong:) He said, alright all you mojados down here I want you all to hit the floor I got one thing to ask you and nothing more So answer in English, if you can Where were ya born, man (Cheech:) Huh? Where was I born? (Chong:) That's right, I said Where were ya born? (Cheech:) Hey, are you one of those dudes who do horoscopes, man Hey, I'm a Cancer with a bad moon rising (Chong:) Look here el fago, watch my lips Where were ya born? (Cheech:) I was BORN IN EAST L.A. Man, I was BORN IN EAST L.A. (Chong:) Oh yeah, you were BORN IN EAST L.A. Let's see your green card (Cheech:) Huh? Green card? I'm from East LA (Chong:) Alright, then who's President of the United States (Cheech:) Oh, that's easy, man That guy that used to be on Death Valley Days, John Wayne (Chong:) Alright, let's go, come on (Cheech:) Next thing I know, I'm in a foreign land People talkin so fast, I couldn't understand There was nobody there to lend a helping hand I was cold, it was dark where is a burger stand I want to go back to East LA I wish I was back in East LA I don't belong here in downtown T.J. Cause I was born in East LA, ole I crawled under barbed wire, swam across a stream Rode in six different trucks packed like a sardine Walked all day in the burning sun Now I know what it's like to be born to run Up ahead was the promised land Shining like a star just beyond my hand All I could see was a golden door I looked up, a sign said five billion sold And I was back in East LA Yes, I was back in East LA You know I'm never gonna stray Cause I was born in East LA, oh LA (adlibs with I'm a low rider rocker in East LA, oh LA) EAST LA!
