        "text": "Jan Hadar, the expatriate Czechoslovak director whose acclaimed movie “The Shop on Main Street” won the Academy Award for the best foreign film of 1965 as well as the New York Film Critics Award, died last Friday at Cedars‐Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. He was 61 years old and had lived in recent years in Hollywood and New York\n\nA Hungarian‐born Jew whose father, mother and sister died at Auschwitz, Mr. Kadar himself was imprisoned in a labor camp near Budapest by the Nazis in World War II and came to the United States in 1968 when Warsaw‐pact forces led by Soviet tanks invaded Czechoslovakia to suppress the liberalization known as “the Prague Spring.”\n\n“I'm still a Czechoslovak,” Mr. Kadar said in an interview a few years ago. “The home of an artist is the world. want to be a free citizen. If I cannot be free citizen at home, I try to be a citizen of the world.”\n\nWorked for State Monopoly\n\nA thoughtful man with horn‐rimmed glasses set on a slender, somewhat equine face, Mr. Kadar worked for Czechoslovak Film, the state‐owned movie‐making monopoly in Prague, during the increasing liberalization of Czech culture in the early 1960's.\n\nA number of his films won prizes, including “Death Is Called Engelchen,” which took top honors at the 1962 Moscow Film Festival, and “The Defendant,” a 1964 work. Other Kadar films included “Katka,” “Music From Mars,” “The Angel Levine,” “Adrift,” and “Lies My Father Told Me,” which won the 1975 Golden Globe Award for best foreign film.\n\nBut Mr. Kadar's most successful and widely applauded film was “The Shop On Main Street,” which, like many of his earlier works, was co‐directed by Elmar\n\nKlos. A moving drama of an old woman (played by Ida Kaminska) betrayed to the Nazis by a man who didn't have the courage not to, the film exposed the wound of conscience felt by many Czechoslovak people who became tacitly involved in the Nazi persecution of Jews, and it confronted the dilemmas of many who witnessed Hitler's crimes and persecutions.\n\nBosley Crowther, in a review for The New York Times, called it “one of the most arresting and devastating pictures I've seen from Europe or anywhere else,” a film that raised “hope that the horrible injustices committed against innocent people may bring some realization of the need of brotherhood.”\n\nJan Kadar was born in Budapest on April 1, 1918, and raised in a Slovak town called Lucenec, which was annexed by Hungary. As a young man, he studied law at the University of Prague. When the Germans came in 1938, his parents and sister were sent to Auschwitz and he was sent to a labor camp near Budapest, where he remained until 1945.\n\nAfter the war, at the age of 27, he studied at Prague's Photography and Film School. He then joined the state film company in Prague and began making documentaries, rising from lowly assistant to assistant director and then director as Czech films flowered in an artistic and political renaissance.\n\nAfter coming to the United States, Mr. Kadar kept an apartment in Manhattan but spent much of his time in California. For the last four years, he was the film maker in residence at the Center for Advanced Film Studies at the American Film Institute in Los Angeles.\n\nHe died on Friday just a few hours after being admitted to the Cedars‐Sinai Medical Center. A hospital spokesman did not disclose the cause of death. A funeral was held in Los Angeles yesterday. Mr. Kadar is survived by his wife, Judith, and a brother. Stefan."
