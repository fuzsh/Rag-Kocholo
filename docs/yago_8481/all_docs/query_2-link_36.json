        "text": "Ján Kadár (born April 1, 1918, Budapest, Hung.—died June 1, 1979, Los Angeles, Calif., U.S.) was a motion-picture director who was important in the “New Wave” of Czechoslovak cinema of the early 1960s.\n\nKadár attended Charles University, Prague, and the Film School at Bratislava, Czechoslovakia (1938). During World War II he was interned in a Nazi labour camp, after which he worked as a scriptwriter and assistant director, first at the Koliba Studios in Bratislava and from 1947 at the Barrandov Studios, Prague. While at Bratislava he made the outstanding documentary Life Is Rising from the Ruins (1945). In 1950 Kadár directed the comedy Katka (U.S. title, Katya), his first independent feature and a milestone in the postwar Czechoslovak cinema. It was followed by a series of films codirected with Elmar Klos. They include Únos (1952; Kidnap); Smrt si řiká Engelchen (1963; Death Is Called Engelchen), which won first prize at the Moscow Film Festival; Obžlovaný (1964; The Accused, or The Defendant); and Obchod na korze (1965; U.S. title, The Shop on Main Street; U.K. title, The Shop on High Street), the drama of an ordinary Czechoslovak citizen who is confronted with a personal moral decision regarding the Nazi persecution of the Jews. This film won the New York Film Critics Award and the Academy Award for best foreign-language film."
