        "meta_description": "Elmar Kloss (born Klos) was born on October 12, 1942 in Zlín. He is the son of Anna Klosová and Elmar Klos, a director who together with Ján Kadár won the Oscar for the best foreign language film in 1965 - the war drama Obchod na korze. Important figures from his family include, for example, great-grandfather Ignát Hořica, an officer, writer and journalist, or great-grandmother Marie Laudová-Hořicová, an acting diva of the National Theatre. His step-grandfather, whom he loved very much and whose fate was infamously influenced by the totalitarian regime, was Josef Januštík, the First Republic governor of the Uherské Hradiště district, later the Zlín region. Elmar's father's film career was constantly hampered by various regime restrictions – twice he was banned from films completely, once he was banned from making feature films for five years. Son Elmar graduated in film direction in 1965. In 1968, he experienced the dramatic events during the invasion of the Warsaw Pact troops in Bratislava, where he was a member of the film crew during the filming of the film Touha zvaná Anada. It was his father's last film, after which he was fired from Barrandov for political reasons. He was not allowed to continue filming, publishing or teaching at FAMU. His son Elmar was not allowed to direct independently due to personnel reasons (he did not agree with the entry of Soviet troops into the republic and refused to condemn his father for the same), and therefore he could only work at Barrandov as an assistant director. From 1981 he was a director in the dubbing studio of the Barrandov Film Studio, where he created dozens of Czech versions of foreign films. After leaving Barrandov in 1991, he became a permanent employee of Czech Television, where he made a number of other dubbings. In 2012, he received the František Filipovský Award for a lifetime of extraordinary dubbing work.",
