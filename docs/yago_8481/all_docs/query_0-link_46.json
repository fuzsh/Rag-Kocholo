        "text": "Elmar Klos, a Czech film director who shared an Academy Award for the 1965 film \"The Shop on Main Street,\" died on July 19 in Prague. He was 83.\n\nMr. Klos was in the forefront of the New Wave of Czechoslovak films in the 1960's. He collaborated for years with another film director from what was then Czechoslovakia, Jan Kadar, who died in 1979. Mr. Kadar was the other co-director of \"The Shop on Main Street,\" which won the Oscar for best foreign-language film. The duo's other films include \"The Accused\" (1964) and \"Adrift\" (1968), an American-Czechoslovak co-production in which Mr. Klos was associate director.\n\nWhen \"The House on Main Street,\" Mr. Klos's masterpiece, appeared, it was one of the few movies made in Central Europe since World War II that dealt frankly with the persecution of Jews in the Nazi era.\n\nAfter Mr. Klos's death, the British critic Derek Malcolm wrote in The Guardian that the film was \"a skillful and deeply felt re-creation\" of \"a historical nightmare.\"\n\nMr. Klos was born in Brno, 115 miles southeast of Prague. He began doing odd jobs in the film industry as a teen-ager and set up his own studio in Zlin, 48 miles north of Brno, when he was 25.\n\nAfter World War II, he became a screenwriter and went on to co-direct with Mr. Kadar beginning in the early 1950's.\n\nBut Mr. Klos became an artistic pariah in the repressive period after the Soviet crackdown in Czechoslovakia in August 1968, with its censorship and restrictions on the country's film industry. The Communist Prague Government described \"The Shop on Main Street\" as Zionist.\n\nMr. Klos was obliged to work as a construction engineer in the 1970's and 1980's, but later he lectured at the Prague film school known as FAMU. In his later years he also wrote essays and criticism."
