        "text": "The renowned work of Ladislav Grosman (1921-1981) is his Obchod na korze (1965; The Shop on Main Street). Grosman himself came from a Slovak Jewish family, went through various labor camps during the war and eventually, escaped before being transported to the extermination camp and thus had to hide-out for the rest of the war. After the war, he studied in Prague and worked as an editor and screenwriter, publishing in both Slovak and Czech. His novel The Shop on Main Street was made world-famous by the film directed by Ján Kadár and Elmar Klos, apart from other things winning the American Academy Award for the best foreign film in 1965. The screenplay and film were based on Grosman's short story Past (1962, The Trap) which was written in Slovak and published in Czech translation in the Prague journal Plamen. Arnošt Lustig, a well-known Czech writer, referred Kadár and Klos to this work. The novel The Shop on Main Street was then created immediately after the screenplay (which Grosman cooperated on) and simultaneously with the film. Grosman's literary screenplay was published for the first time in the revue Divadlo in April 1964. For the second time, it was edited in a rather different version, posthumoustly 1998. The novel was published for the first time as a serial story in the Prague magazine Mladý svět from August to December 1964. It was edited in the publishing house Mladá fronta in 1965. The film premiered the eighth of October, 1965. Therefore, there are six different versions of this work: first, the short story translated from Slovak into Czech (only 20 standard pages), second, the serial story written in Czech (about 80 pages), third, the screenplay in an older variant written Czech (published in Divadlo, about 90 pages), fourth, the screenplay in a later variant written also in Czech, published 1998 (about 100 pages), fifth the novel in Czech (about 100 pages), and sixth the film spoken in Slovak and partly in mixture of Slovak-Polish-Yiddish (128 minutes). By comparison with the film and the novel, the plot of the original short story is much briefer and simpler. They are only three plot situations in the short story Trap. The first: Kolkocký and his wife's visit in Brtko's house (chapter II in the book). The second: Brtko's \"taking over\" Rozálie Lautmanová's button shop and his agreement with Kucharský (chapter IV in the book, Kuchár in the film). The third: the final situation when the Jewish community is being rounded up to be deported, Brtko accidentally kills Mrs. Lautmanová and then hangs himself (the second half of chapter X in the book). The only figure from the short story that wasn't used in the novel or the film: the Slovak Fascist \"guardsman\" Karolko. The guardsman Peter Čarný plays his role to a certain extent and the love affair suggested between Brtko's wife Evelína and Karolko is present in her relationship to Čarný. However, many later characters don't yet appear in the short story, such as uncle Piti báči, the tobacconist Balko, the barber Katz and other Jews etc. In the Trap, the small town looks almost empty, while in the novel and film the town is full of people and colorful events. The narrator's comments play an important role in the short story. For instance, it is said at the beginning of the plot: \"Brtko doesn't feel that there was a trap set for him.\" (Grosman, 1962, p. 67) Still the serial story begins with the narrator's comment: \"The plot of our story is fictional. [...] Let us add that it happens in a picturesque valley.\" (Grosman, 1964a, no. 34, p. 13) Later, in the novel and film, such statements can't be found so often. And the action is more immediate, without any intervention from the narrator. The main character Tono Brtko is more indecisive and naïve in the later versions. He has clownish, grotesque features, along with his dog and Chaplinesque hat. The imaginative scenes at the end are also new."
