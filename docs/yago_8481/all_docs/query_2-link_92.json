        "text": "For the Italian football coach, see Karel Zeman (football manager).\n\nKarel Zeman (3 November 1910 – 5 April 1989) was a Czech film director, artist, production designer and animator, best known for directing fantasy films combining live-action footage with animation. Because of his creative use of special effects and animation in his films, he has often been called the \"Czech Méliès\".\n\nLife\n\nZeman was born on 3 November 1910 in Ostroměř (near Nová Paka) in what was then Austria-Hungary. At his parents' insistence, he studied business at high school in Kolín. In the 1920s, he studied at a French advertising school, and worked at an advertising studio in Marseilles until 1936. It was in France that he first worked with animation, filming an ad for soap. He then returned to his home country (by now the First Czechoslovak Republic, known as Czechoslovakia), after visiting Egypt, Yugoslavia, and Greece. Back in Czechoslovakia, Zeman advertised for Czech firms like Baťa and Tatra. In 1939 he attempted to make an extended stay in Casablanca, but was barred by the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia established by Nazi Germany; unable to get the necessary papers in time, Zeman was required to remain in his home country during the German occupation of Czechoslovakia.\n\nDuring the war he worked as a head of advertisement at Dům služeb in Brno. Film director Elmar Klos came to Brno to film a newsreel about window-dressing competition, which Zeman won. Klos offered Zeman a job at Zlín's animation studio. After some consideration (his wife and children were already established in Brno), Zeman accepted the job in 1943. At the studio, Zeman worked as an assistant to the pioneering animator Hermína Týrlová, and in 1945 he became the director of the stop-motion animation production group. The same year, in collaboration with Bořivoj Zeman, he made his first short film, Vánoční sen (\"A Christmas Dream\"). The short, which combined animated puppets with live-action footage, marked the beginning of Zeman's experiments with new techniques and genres.\n\nZeman then went on to solo work, including a series of satirical cartoon shorts starring a puppet called Mr. Prokouk; the series was a wide success and the character became a Czech favorite. A bet Zeman accepted, challenging him to discover a method of working with glass in animation, led to the unusual short Inspirace (\"Inspiration,\" 1948), which tells a wordless, poetic love story using animated glass figurines. Zeman then went on to the half-hour film Král Lávra (1950), based on the satirical poem by Karel Havlíček Borovský; the film won a National Award. In 1952, Zeman completed his first feature film, Poklad ptačího ostrova (\"The Treasure of Bird Island,\" 1952). It was based on a Persian fairy tale and took its visual inspiration from Persian paintings, combining multiple animation techniques in two- and three-dimensional space.\n\nIt was in 1955, however, that Zeman began the work for which he is best known: six feature films designed artistically to combine live-action and animation techniques. These were:\n\nCesta do pravěku (1955), inspired by Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth and the paintings of Zdeněk Burian. In 1966 a partly re-filmed US version was released as Journey to the Beginning of Time.\n\nVynález zkázy (1958), based on Verne's Facing the Flag, and filmed to emulate the original illustrations for Verne's novels\n\nBaron Prášil (1961), celebrating the legendary Baron Munchausen and the engravings of Gustave Doré\n\nBláznova kronika (1964), a satire of the Thirty Years' War, suggested by the drawings of Matthäus Merian\n\nUkradená vzducholoď (1966), inspired by the Verne novels Two Years' Vacation and The Mysterious Island, the Art Nouveau style, and the 1891 Prague Centennial Exhibition\n\nNa kometě (1970), an anti-war fantasy based on Verne's Hector Servadac\n\nHe was a member of the jury at the 2nd Moscow International Film Festival in 1961 and at the 7th Moscow International Film Festival in 1971. The Czechoslovakian government awarded him the title of National Artist in 1970.\n\nAfter his live-action films, Zeman experimented with more classical forms of animation, beginning with seven shorts about Sinbad the Sailor which were then expanded into the feature film Pohádky tisíce a jedné noci (1974). His final films were Čarodějův učeň (1977), from the novel The Satanic Mill by Otfried Preußler, and Pohádka o Honzíkovi a Mařence (1980). On 3 November 1980, in celebration of Zeman's seventieth birthday, President Gustáv Husák awarded him the Order of the Republic.\n\nZeman died in Gottwaldov (present-day Zlín) on 5 April 1989, a few months before the Velvet Revolution.\n\nLegacy\n\nZeman's works were influential to the Czech animator Jan Švankmajer, as well as to the filmmaker Terry Gilliam, who said of Zeman: \"He did what I'm still trying to do, which is to try and combine live action with animation. His Doré-esque backgrounds were wonderful.\" The filmmaker Tim Burton described Zeman's creative process as \"extremely inspirational\" to his own work, and identified Zeman and the animator Ray Harryhausen as his influences \"in terms of doing stop motion and a more handmade quality … Karel Zeman did that amazingly.\" Harryhausen himself also spoke in interviews of his admiration for Zeman, and the films of the director Wes Anderson have included homages to Zeman's works.\n\nThe film historian Georges Sadoul identified Zeman as having \"widened the horizons of the eighth art, animation,\" adding:\n\nHe is justly considered Méliès's successor. He undoubtedly brings the old master to mind, not only because he is an artisan impassioned by art, creating his \"innocent inventions\" with infinite patience rather than with large budgets, but also because of his ingenuous and always ingenious fantasies. Less intellectual than Trnka, but nonetheless his equal, he has great zest and a marvelous sense of baroque oddities and poetic gags.\n\nOn the occasion of an animation exhibition in 2010, curators at the Barbican Centre said of Zeman: \"although his influence outweighs his global fame, he is unarguably one of the greatest animators of all time.\"\n\nIn 2012 a museum dedicated to Zeman and his work, the Muzeum Karla Zemana, opened near the Charles Bridge in Prague.\n\nFilmography\n\nFeature films\n\nYear Original Czech title Standard English title US release title 1952 Poklad ptačího ostrova The Treasure of Bird Island N/A 1955 Cesta do pravěku Journey to Prehistory Journey to the Beginning of Time 1958 Vynález zkázy Invention for Destruction The Fabulous World of Jules Verne 1962 Baron Prášil Baron Munchausen The Fabulous Baron Munchausen 1964 Bláznova kronika A Jester's Tale War of the Fools 1967 Ukradená vzducholoď The Stolen Airship N/A 1970 Na kometě On the Comet On the Comet 1974 Pohádky tisíce a jedné noci Tales of 1,001 Nights Adventures of Sinbad the Sailor 1977 Čarodějův učeň Krabat — The Sorcerer's Apprentice N/A 1980 Pohádka o Honzíkovi a Mařence The Tale of John and Mary N/A\n\nShort films\n\nYear Original Czech title English title Notes 1945 Vánoční sen The Christmas Dream Released in the US as A Christmas Dream 1946 Křeček The Hamster 1946 Podkova pro štěstí Horseshoe for Luck The first Mr. Prokouk film 1947 Pan Prokouk ouřaduje Mr. Prokouk, Bureaucrat 1947 Brigády Voluntary work The third Mr. Prokouk film 1947 Pan Prokouk v pokušení Mr. Prokouk in Temptation 1948 Pan Prokouk filmuje Mr. Prokouk Filming 1948 Inspirace Inspiration 1949 Pan Prokouk vynálezcem Mr. Prokouk, Inventor 1950 Král Lávra King Lávra 1955 Pan Prokouk, Přítel zvířátek Mr. Prokouk, Friend of the Animals 1958 Pan Prokouk detektivem Mr. Prokouk, Detective 1959 Pan Prokouk akrobatem Mr. Prokouk, Acrobat 1971 Dobrodružství námořníka Sindibáda Adventures of Sinbad the Sailor 1972 Druhá cesta námořníka Sindibáda The Second Voyage of Sinbad the Sailor 1973 V zemi obrů.
