        "text": "Winner of the OscarÂ® for Best Foreign Language Feature in 1965, JÃ¡n KadÃ¡r and Elmar Klosâ The Shop on the High Street (aka The Shop on Main Street) is one of the cornerstones of World Cinema, and perhaps the most internationally renowned film in all Czechoslovak cinema.\n\nâTÃ³noâ Brtko, a poor carpenter, is appointed by his despised Nazi brother-in-law to be 'Aryan controller' of an old Jewish widowâs sewing shop in a Nazi-occupied Slovakia in 1942. The widow, Rozalia (Yiddish theatre legend Ida KamiÅska, nominated here for a Best Actress OscarÂ® for her performance) is near deaf, isolated and partially sighted, barely even aware of the war or able to comprehend the danger in which she lives. Believing TÃ³no is simply her new assistant, the two develop a friendship that sees him maintaining that fiction as he attempts to protect her from the encroaching Nazi horror.\n\nThe Shop on the High Street is a complex tale of common lives disturbed and destroyed by war. Wonderfully written and performed, and with an extraordinary Zdenek LiÅ¡ka score, the film becomes a devastating examination of how minor compromises can finally lead to complicity in the horrors of tyranny.\n\nAvailable on both Blu-Ray and DVD formats, The Shop on the High Street is presented from a new High Definition transfer prepared by the Czech National Film Archive.\n\n1965 OscarÂ® Winner: Best Foreign Language Film\n\n1965 Cannes Film Festival /\n\nSpecial Citation: Ida KamiÅska & Jozef Kroner\n\n1966 New York Film Critics Circle /\n\nWinner: Best Foreign Language Film\n\n1966 OscarÂ® Nomination: Best Actress - Ida KamiÅska\n\n\"The Shop on the High Street, in short, is an episode of high tragedy, a concentration of the worldâs absurdities, in which good, ignorant, and indecisive people like Brtko enable 'force' to get a firm hold\" JÃ¡n KadÃ¡r\n\n\"The most moving film about anti-Semitism ever made...\n\nThe grand theme - as of all good modern drama - can be simply stated: How much of a man belongs to authority and how much to himself? At what point must the individual say 'No'?â Kenneth Tynan\n\n\"Infinitely moving... a masterpiece, a flawless examination of the toll of indecision and the penalty of passive decency\"\n\nEleanor Perry, Life Magazine, Feb 1966\n\n\"Brilliant in performance and extraordinary in accomplishment... one of the fine films of our time, for all time\" Judith Crist, New York Herald Tribune\n\n\"A luminous parable that exhorts viewers to examine the tragedy of social and political intolerance\" KinoKultura\n\n\"The filmâs fine balancing of comic charm and brooding evil as well as its rich metaphoric language are easily evident, and it certainly deserved its Academy Award\" Senses of Cinema"
