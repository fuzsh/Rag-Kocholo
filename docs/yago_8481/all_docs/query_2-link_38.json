It is based on a 1959 autobiographical novel by Slovak author Ladislav Mňačko. The project overshadowed a previous 1960 Slovak television adaptation directed by Ivan Balaďa, and starring Ivan Mistrík. Set at the end of World War II, young partisan Pavel (Jan Kačer) is seriously injured. While lying in hospital, he thinks back over the preceding months of drama and turmoil. Kačer offers a convincing performance, adding dimensions of self-doubt and guilt to the ostensibly heroic fighter. Much of Pavel’s guilt stems from the fact that a SS unit headed by Nazi officer Engelchen has liquidated the inhabitants of two mountain villages for helping partisan forces. The film explores a number of complex moral questions, not just through the eyes of Pavel, but also through his love interest Marta (Eva Poláková).\n\nRead more"
