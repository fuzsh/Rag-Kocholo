        "text": "I start the thread about notable directors (including male and female and whatever gender directors) with the siblings Lana and Lilly Wachowski , two of the most influential movie directors ever.\n\nLana was called Larry until about 2009 and divorced his/her wife to start a new life as a transformed woman. Already as a child, she had never known whether she should line up with the boys or with the ...... According to her own statements, she later suffered from anxiety and depression. Lilly was called Andy until 2016, when she came out as a woman who had also transitioned. It is certainly interesting for transgender researchers to analyze the background of such processes if occurred in original brothers, but this cannot be a topic in detail here, since genetic aspects may be involved.\n\nThe then brothers' entry into the film business began with their screenplay for \"Assassins\" (1995) by Richard Donner starring Sylvester Stallone and Antonio Banderas, an impressive movie with great acting performances (especially Banderas´ best performance, I think). In 1996, another excellent thriller, \"Bound\", with Gina Gershon and Jennifer Tilly, was written and now also directed by the Wachowskis. That the relationship between the two female characters is strongly tinged with lesbianism certainly has something to do with the ..... inclinations of the authors. 1999 saw the launch of the legendary \"Matrix\" franchise, which set standards in the global film world in terms of aesthetics and trick technology. The role of Neo was given to Keanu Reeves after Will Smith turned down the offer, arguing that he was not convinced by the new bullet effects. He later admitted that he would certainly have screwed up the role and praised Keanu Reeves' performance. In 2005, the Wachowskis wrote and produced \"V for Vendetta\" (directed by James McTeigue), which made the Guy Fawkes mask popular, which then became an iconic symbol for political protests in the real world.\n\nTheir next directorial work was \"Speed Racer\" (2008) with Emile Hirsch, Christina Ricci and John Goodman, based on a Japanese manga series. A friend of mine, who at the time, in 2008, was a co-author on a screenplay project of mine that I then presented to a well-known Hollywood producer, was on the lighting team for \"Speed Racer,\" which was shot in Berlin, and saw Lana Wachowski often, but he/she was very reserved on the set and limited contacts with the team to the essentials. One needed a special permission to talk to him or her. I say \"he or she\" because it is not exactly clear whether Lana was already a woman at that time. In any case, Lana wore women's clothes on the set of \"Speed Racer\". I know these details from my script friend.\n\nIn 2012, they filmed the spectacular \"Cloud Atlas\" together with the German Tom Tykwer, for which they drew inspiration from Kubrick's \"2001\". In 2021, Lana Wachowski completed the fourth part of the \"Matrix\" franchise, which is set 60 years after the events of the third part.\n\nLilly and Lana Wachowski in 2012, four years before Lilly´s transgendering.\n\nLilly Wachowski.\n\nAfter the Wachowskis´ script:\n\nFirst directorial work:\n\nThe highlight of the Wachowskis' oeuvre.\n\nProduced in Germany:\n\nThe fourth part of the classic.\n\nFritz Lang (1890-1976)\n\nThe giant of German Expressionism and American noir was born in Vienna to parents of Moravian descent, growing up in the embers of the Austro-Hungarian empire he studied art in Vienna before indulging in travelling and staying in Paris a little while. During the war he fought for the Austrian army in Russia and Romania, receiving 4 wounds and losing sight in his right eye. During recuperation he dabbled in screenplays, working for Ufa and Nero films as a director from 1919. He actually turned down \"Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" to direct the crime serial \"The Spiders\", a pulpy adventure of criminal gangs and a secret Incan treasure heavily influenced by Louis Feuillade's crime serials of the 1910s.\n\nFritz Lang's more serious \"Destiny\" was partly inspired by the Indian folktale Savitri and the recent death of Fritz's mother. Critically panned for not being \"German\" enough, the tale of the Grim Reaper granting a woman 3 chances to save her missing fiance, the ghostly special effects, the expressionistic cinematography and the 3 exotic settings (Venice, the Middle East and China) were alluring to French audiences.

Inspired by the skyscrapers of New York City and the desire to \"out-Hollywood Hollywood\", Fritz Lang released the ambitious sci-fi film \"Metropolis\".

The movie became famous for depicting the first ever countdown for a rocket launch.\n\nLang's first sound movie \"M\" would rank alongside \"Metropolis\" as his greatest achievement.

I hadn't realised the level of his output. All I've seen is an apparently incomplete, restored copy of Metropolis.\n\nGrowing up as I did in a very insular Australia, I missed so much of European culture of all kinds. For us it was almost as if continental Europe didn't exist. Apart from the UK, it wasn't until 1990 that I got to visit Europe. Because they are closer, I visited Hong Kong (first of 5 trips) Japan and The Philippines in 1979.\n\nHenri-Georges Clouzot (1907-1977) sometimes nicknamed \"The French Alfred Hitchcock\" for his dark psychological crime films.\n\nIn the 1930s he wrote screenplays and directed French-language versions of German films for Ufa studios in Berlin until he was fired for being too friendly with Jewish producers. In the 40s he joined Continental Films (German film company operating in Occupied France) as a director, his debut film \"The Murderer Lives at Number 21\" (1942)a murder mystery with comic elements, Pierre Fresnay moving into a boarding house to catch a serial killer. The opening scene sets the tone for the rest of the movie:\n\nNext came his controversial film \"Le Corbeau\" (1943) depicting a small French town tearing itself apart over anonymous poison pen letters. The movie was popular with audiences yet the Vichy Government, the Catholic Church and the left-wing press hated the movie. The movie almost spelled the end for Clouzot's directing career: fired from Continental Films just before its release and charged with collaboration in the Post-Liberation era he was initially banned for life from directing movies until his ban was later commuted to two years.\n\nAfter his ban Clouzot directed two commercially successful films that couldn't have been more different: the crime film \"Quai des Orfevres\" (1947) starring Louis Jouvet and \"Manon\" (1949), an adaptation of Abbe Prevost's novel \"Manon Lescaut\" starring lesser known actors which won the Golden Lion at Venice.\n\nIt was the 1950s that really earned Clouzot his moniker \"The French Hitchcock\". After the unsuccessful comedy \"Miquette\", in 1953 he paired veteran actor Charles Vanel with crooner Yves Montand in the nerve-shredding classic \"The Wages of Fear\". Set in an unnamed South American country, four down-on-their-luck men are hired by an American Oil company to transport crates of Nitroglycerin across dangerous, unsafe roads. The first hour of the film is dedicated to building relationships and establishing character, once the trucks start rolling the suspense becomes unbearable.\n\nHe would follow that up with the horror classic \"Les Diaboliques\". Based on a novel by crime-writing duo Boileau & Narcejac, Alfred Hitchcock narrowly missed out on securing the rights to the movie (he later adapted another of their novels into \"Vertigo\"). Starring the director's wife Vera Clouzot and Simone Signoret, it covers the wife and mistress of a school principal planning his murder, but a retired Police Inspector's investigation threatens to unravel their alibi.\n\nNext up was \"The Mystery of Picasso\", a documentary showing Pablo Picasso drawing and painting in real-time on a transparent canvas. A political thriller \"The Spies\" rounded off the 50s for Clouzot.\n\nTHE MYSTERY OF PICASSO Trailer\n\nClouzot only completed two films during the 60s thanks to a heart attack during the making of \"Inferno\". In 1960 he cast Brigitte Bardot in the courtroom drama \"The Truth\", playing the black sheep of a family on trial for murdering her lover. The movie uses flashbacks to detail her backstory and build towards the murder scene, trying to determine whether it was premeditated or a crime of passion.\n\nLa Vérité 1960 - Brigitte Bardot bed scene\n\nIll-health saw him complete one more film \"The Prisoner\" along with some TV documentaries, during the 70s he worked on several unused screenplays before dying at 69 with less than a dozen feature films to his name but a strong legacy.\n\nThe most profiled, versatile and successful director of recent French cinema is Luc Besson, born in 1959, who began working as a director in his early 20s. The movie stars Jean Reno, Natalie Portman and Milla Jovovich started their careers in his films.\n\nHe was 17 when he went on the set of a short film out of curiosity. Then he told his mother at home that he wanted to go into the film business without finishing school. His mother refused to agree and got upset. But the next morning he packed his bag and left home to look for jobs as assistant director. (Btw, my son did such a training at the Munich Ufa). At 20, Besson made his first still minor film and at 24 his first major one, \"Le Dernier Combat\" (The last fight), in which Jean Reno, who had befriended Besson, appeared in a Besson film for the first time. The next important film that made Besson really known because of the wonderful underwater shots was \"The Big Blue \" (1988), a deep-sea film whose story Besson had already sketched out at the age of 15. Both of Besson's parents were professional divers, and Besson had also initially aspired to be one as marine biologist, but had an accident at 17, which is why he switched to film.\n\nIn 1990, he finally shot the first typical Besson film, a thriller with a lot of violence and eroticism, \"Nikita\". A young woman by that name is a cop killer who is pressured by a secret service to either be killed during her life sentence or to work as a contract killer. Anne Parillaud, married to Besson from 1984 to 1991, took on the lead role, and Jean Reno was in the cast again. In 1993, John Badham made a reboot of \"Nikita\" with Bridget Fonda, which is also well worth seeing. In 1997, a Canadian TV series was made from Besson's original (\"Nikita\"), which in turn was the model for the spectacular US crime show \"24\" with Kiefer Sutherland.\n\nIn \"Leon\" (1994) with Jean Reno and Natalie Portman, one of Besson's psychological characteristics is revealed: his preference for young ...... At some places, the sexual aspects of the 12-year-old character Mathilda (played by 12-year-old Portman) are obvious, and one of the scenes was even not allowed to be shown in the United States. Several newspapers revealed at the time that the film story between Leon and Mathilda mirrored a former real relationship between Besson and a 13-year-old actress (Maiwenn) who had a child from Besson at 16, when she also married him (then 33).\n\nHe shot his next two films with the young photo model Milla Jovovich, who made it big through these films, \"The 5th Element\" (1997) and \"The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc\" (1999), the former turning out to be one of the most commercially successful European films of all time.\n\nThen, with a few less known exceptions, Besson limited himself to producing with other directors until 2014, when he directed \"Lucy\" with Scarlett Johannson in a role similar to Nikita, but this time empowered by a super drug. Initially, Angelina Jolie was supposed to play the part, but she said no, as did Milla Jovovich because of her pregnancy. In my opinion, Besson's next and so far last two films, \"Valerian\" (2017) and \"Anna\" (2019), are better than \"Lucy\". \"Valerian\" convinces above all with ingenious VFX and an excellent performance by actress Carla Delevingne. \"Anna\" with the Russian model Sasha Luss as contract killer (similar to Nikita again) didn't go down well with the critics, but I was fully convinced, also in terms of Sasha Luss' performance.\n\nLuc Besson and Maiwenn in 1995.\n\nANNA Official Trailer (2019) Cillian Murphy, Luc Besson Action Movie HD\n\nANNA Official Trailer (2019) Cillian Murphy, Luc Besson, Sasha Luss, Luke Evans Action Movie HD© 2019 - SummitComedy, Kids, Family and Animated Film, Blockbu...\n\nKon Ichikawa (1915-2008) The bane of auteur theorists everywhere for his versatility and ability to handle studio-imposed projects. Out of the \"Club of Four Horsemen\" including Akira Kurosawa, Masaki Kobayashi and Keisuke Kinoshita, he had the longest career of them all and had the least problem getting his movies financed from the 70s onwards, yet his International reputation is far behind Kurosawa and Kobayashi, while in Japan his reputation lags behind all three.\n\nInfluenced by Charlie Chaplin and Walt Disney, he embarked upon a career in animation, creating one 6-minute short film at a local J.O film studio before the animation department was closed.\n\nShinsetsu Kachi Kachi Yama (1936)\n\nIn the early 40s the Japanese Government merged several film studios as part of the war effort, J.O studios merged with P.C.L and Toho Film distribution to become Toho Film Company. Ichikawa moved to Tokyo and began directing feature films from 1947 onwards (he did not serve in WW II due to illness). In 1948 he married translator and screenwriting partner Natto Wada, instrumental in his celebrated 1955-1965 period which kicked off with the Natsume Soseki adaptation of \"Kokoro\", starring Masayuki Mori as Nobuchi, a melancholy older man out of step with his times harbouring a great secret. Affectionately called \"sensei\" by a young student named Hioki, the two strike up a friendship as Hioki learns more about Nobuchi's behaviour and his past.\n\nThe following year saw the disillusioned and rebellious youth movie \"Punishment Room\", penned by Shintaro Ishihara (a key writer in the \"Sun Tribe\" youth subculture) and starring Hiroshi Kawaguchi, Ayako Wakao and Seiji Miyaguchi (Kyuzo from \"Seven Samurai\"). Kon Ichikawa also directed one of his most enduring films \"The Burmese Harp\". A WWII movie about a harp-playing soldier Mizushima who disappears after the war is lost, his comrades left in the dark about his whereabouts.\n\nThe late 50s would see Ichikawa trying his hand in several different genres. In the comic satire \"Crowded Streetcar\" he depicts a University graduate (Hiroshi Kawaguchi) struggling to adapt to working life while simultaneously skewering Japan's educational system and work culture. In 1958 he directed his personal favourite of his own movies \"Conflagration\", a Yukio Mishima novel starring Raizo Ichikawa as a stuttering Buddhist novice and Tatsuya Nakadai as a mean-spirited cripple, gorgeously photographed in black-and-white by Kazuo Miyagawa. 1959 would see another literary adaptation \"The Key\" by Junichiro Tanizaki and the bleak WWII movie \"Fires on the Plain\". A sharp contrast to his more sentimental \"Burmese Harp\" a few years earlier, the war in the Philippines is becoming desperate as one soldier wanders through the landscape encountering the horrors of war\n\nFor the movie \"Ototo\" set in 1920s Japan, Kon Ichikawa wanted a distinctive visual style similar to the 1956 version of Moby ..... Cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa pioneered the \"bleach bypass\" technique, an approach also used in \"Se7en\" and \"Saving Private Ryan\".\n\nOther films from that time include the black comedy \"Ten Dark Women\" about a TV producer's wife and 9 mistresses plotting his death which doesn't go to plan; the comedy \"Being Two Isn't Easy\" told from a baby's point of view; the true story of Kenichi Horie crossing the Pacific Ocean on his yacht (the first Japanese film partially filmed on location in America); the dazzling potboiler \"An Actor's Revenge\" foisted upon Ichikawa by studio executives as punishment for his unsuccessful artistic films. Ichikawa used the thin plot of a kabuki actor avenging the 3 men who ruined his parents' lives by experimenting as often as possible, its refusal to take itself seriously, shot in glorious Cinemascope and the mixture of traditional and jazz soundtracks makes it one of his best films.\n\nAs the 1964 Olympics drew near Kon Ichikawa was tasked with filming the official film for the Games (Akira Kurosawa was fired for wanting too much control). Utilising a crew of 500 people and recording 70 hours worth of footage, the film was edited into a 3 hour documentary which displeased the Olympics committee who wanted something commercial cut it down to 2 hours. In Kon Ichikawa's own words: \"I have attempted to capture the solemnity of the moment when man defies his limits. And to express the solitude of the man who, to succeed, fights against himself. I have tried to penetrate human nature not through fiction but in the truth of the Games.\" The documentary held the record for most attended film in Japan with 23 million admissions (\"Spirited Away\" broke the record in 2001).\n\nIn 1965 Natto Wada retired from screenwriting and Kon Ichikawa's films weren't quite the same afterwards. The Japanese film industry was changing too as the Major studios were being challenged by smaller, independent studios and the more genteel films in the traditional studio style were falling out of fashion. Kon Ichikawa became a member of the failed \"Club of Four Horsemen\" Productions along with Akira Kurosawa, Masaki Kobayashi and Keisuke Kinoshita; it only produced Kurosawa's critical and commercial flop \"Dodesukaden\" and Kobayashi's 3 hour drama \"The Fossil\". Whereas the other 3 directors completed a combined 17 movies from 1970 onwards, Kon Ichikawa directed 29 movies. \"The Wanderers (1973) was a comic criticism of modern-day yakuza films in a 19th century setting. It showed poor ronin barely able to adequately feed and clothe themselves, removing any sense of romance or honour.\n\nOne of his big commercial and critical successes was the murder mystery \"The Inugami Family\" (1976), a dying tycoon leaves all his money to family outsider Tamayo on the condition she marries one of his 3 grandsons, inevitably tearing the family apart. Once the body count piles up detective Kindaichi begins investigating the family history as the plot twists and turns its way through over 2 enjoyable hours. It was the first of 5 movies in the Detective Kindaichi series.\n\nThe Inugami Family (1976) ORIGINAL TRAILER\n\nThe original trailer of The Inugami Family directed by Kon Ichikawa. Directed by Koji Ishizaka, Yôko Shimada and Teruhiko Aoi.AKA:A Família InugamiInugami-ke...\n\nIn the 80s Ichikawa's wife passed away from cancer in the same year he directed a colourful adaptation of Junichiro Tanizaki's \"Makioka Sisters\" following a family in decline as they try to marry off the third sister Yukiko. More comic and sarcastic in tone compared to the novel (the English translation of it), the slow pace and beautiful cinematography add to the allure although anyone who loves the novel may feel disappointed at Teinosuke's change from the novel.\n\nTHE MAKIOKA SISTERS (1983) - The Criterion Collection\n\nHe also remade his Burmese Harp in colour in 1985 and directed\"Princess of the Moon\" (1987), a live-action version of the \"Princess Kaguya\" folk tale starring Ayako Wakao and Toshiro Mifune as two parents adopting a mysterious child falling out of the sky who resembles their dead daughter. The child grows up extremely quickly and eventually she has to decide whether to stick with her parents on Earth or return to her home planet.\n\nPRINCESS FROM THE MOON, Kon Ichikawa, 1986 - Moon Baby Hatching\n\nFor his last few movies he directed an adaptation of \"The 47 Ronin\", remade another crime film \"Village of Eight Tombstones\" and directed another Natsume Soseki novel \"Ten Nights of Dreams\". His last film was a bland remake of \"The Inugami Clan\" in 2006 at age 90. Kon Ichikawa died of pneumonia two years later, one of his last major interviews came in 2005 as he discussed \"The Burmese Harp\".\n\nThe Burnese Harp - Interview with Kon Ichikawa\n\nKon Ichikawa parla de \"L'Arpa Birmana\", film da lui diretto nel 1956.Sottotitoli disponibili: inglese.\n\nKarel Zeman (1910-1989) Czech director blended animation with live-action to stunning effect nicknamed \"The Czech Melies\". Jan Svankmajer, Terry Gilliam, Wes Anderson and Tim Burton have all cited him as an influence, Hollywood's stop-motion legend Ray Harryhausen also admired his work.\n\nBorn in northern Bohemia he loved puppets as a child and performed in puppet theatre, however his parents insisted he attend Business school. At 17 he moved to the Marseille working for an advertising company, marking his first animation attempt in a soap advert. In his youth he hiked through Yugoslavia, Greece, Morocco and Egypt, after completing military service he worked for an advertising company back in Czechoslovakia. During the war he worked as head of advertising in a department store; he won a window-dressing contest which caught the eye of film director Elmar Klos who offered him a job at Zlin's animation studio. Starting off as assistant to \"Mother of Czech Animation\" Hermina Tyrlova, he became director of the stop-motion department and completed his first animated short alongside Borivoj Zeman \"A Christmas Dream\": the blending of live-action and stop-motion puppets was a technique he'd bring to fruition in his feature films.\n\nIn 1952 he directed his first feature film \"Treasure on Bird Island\" a stop-motion puppet movie based on a Persian fairytale. Zeman would reuse underwater scenes and exotic locations in his later, more famous films.\n\nIn 1955 he began his most celebrated period, 6 movies made over 15 years blending live-action with animation using lots of experimental techniques. The first of these \"Cesta do Praveku\" showed 4 young boys travelling by canoe back 500 million years to find a living trilobite, seeing a whole load of dinosaurs along the journey, influenced by the paintings of Zdenek Burian.\n\nIt was also Zeman's first film released internationally, in America the movie was dubbed and called \"Journey to the Beginning of Time\". Steven Spielberg paid homage to the film's dying Stegosaurus scene in \"Jurassic Park\".\n\nHis next film was even more ambitious, a Jules Verne adaptation called \"Invention for Destruction\", the film's celebrated visual style emulating Victorian-era illustrations. The sets, backgrounds and even the costumes had to be \"lined\" to mimic engravings. The movie also blended different techniques: stop-motion, traditional, cut-outs, miniatures, matte paintings, even stock footage was incorporated into the finished film.\n\nLoosely based on the lesser known \"Facing the Flag\", it was distributed in 72 countries around the world and released as \"The Fabulous World of Jules Verne\" in America. It's the usual story of an evil millionaire wanting to take over the world from his secret island.\n\nIn 1961 he directed a version of Baron Munchausen with a visual style based on Gustave Dore's engravings. The adventure tale taking place on the Moon and Constantinople allowed Zeman to go all-out creatively, it also inspired Terry Gilliam to make his own Baron Munchausen.\n\nIn 1964 he directed \"A Jester's Tale\" following a mercenary and plowboy's comic adventures during the Thirty Years War. Not as ambitious compared to his more famous works yet still has enough humour and satire to be a success.\n\nKarel Zeman went back to Jules Verne for \"The Stolen Airship\" in 1967, showing 4 young boys stealing a Verne-esque air machine from the Centenary Exhibition in Prague, their parents worried sick the entire time.\n\nThe Stolen Airship (UkradenÃ¡ vzducholoÄ) - fantasy - 1966 - trailer\n\nThe Stolen Airship (UkradenÃ¡ vzducholoÄ) - fantasy - 1966 - trailer - Michal PospÃÅ¡il, HanuÅ¡ Bor, Jan ÄÃzek, Josef StrÃ¡nÃk, Jan MalÃ¡t, Jitka ZelenohorskÃ¡, Ä...\n\nAnother Jules Verne-inspired movie was \"On the Comet\", a giant comet pulling North Africa off the Earth along with its inhabitants. Along with a romance storyline there's a subplot involving Spanish forces helping Arabs to fight the French and even a bunch of dinosaurs turn up too. The movie was made during the Prague Spring with several key members of Czech's film industry replaced and it brought an end to Karel Zeman's most successful period.\n\nKarel Zeman: Na kometÄ / On the Comet\n\nÄeskoslovensko, 1970, 74 minReÅ¾ie: Karel ZemanScÃ©nÃ¡Å: Jan ProchÃ¡zka, Karel Zeman (na motivy stejnojmennÃ© knihy Julese Verna)Kamera: Rudolf Stahl, Bohuslav Pi...\n\nAfterwards he mainly produced short films, combining seven short films about Sinbad into \"A Thousand and One Nights\". His penultimate film \"The Sorceror's Apprentice\" was based on a fantasy novel \"The Satanic Mill\" itself derived from West Slavic folklore.

In his work he has frequently combined live action, models, pu...\n\nDutchman Paul Verhoeven, born in 1938, is one of the best-known living directors of international cinema, at least judging by the fame of his films, some of which have achieved cult status, such as \"RoboCop,\" \"Basic Instinct\" and \"Starship Troopers\". He has a reputation for provoking and polarizing with his films, and even managed the feat of having his initially woefully misunderstood and in my eyes wonderful movie \"Showgirls\" cheered by the audience at the end of the Golden Raspberry award ceremony after some excerpts were shown, an amazing example of the nonsense of pejorative slating by feckless film critics.\n\nVerhoeven made his breakthrough in 1973 with his second feature film, the erotic drama \"Turkish Delights\" starring Rutger Hauer in his first film, which was a huge success in the Netherlands and was seen by a quarter of the population, thus the most successful film of Dutch cinema. In 1974, it was nominated for an Oscar as best foreign film. In 1999, it was honored in the Netherlands as the best Dutch film of the century. A German film encyclopedia sees it differently and describes the work as a mixture of blatant ... and pleasurable sadism, which you should better not watch.\n\nAfter a few more Dutch films, Verhoeven went to the U.S. in the mid-1980s to expand his cinematic scope.\n\nHis first English-language film, \"Flesh and Blood\" (1985), set in the year 1501 and again with Rutger Hauer, proved to be a huge flop, grossing only a very small fraction of the $6.5 million production costs. The reason was probably the very negative characterization of the characters, with whom the audience was not at all sympathetic. This is hardly surprising when even the protagonist, played by Hauer, appears as a rapist. As we know, Verhoeven is a fan of Sam Peckinpah, who in 1973 showed an even more shocking .... scene in \"Straw Dogs\" with Dustin Hoffman. Verhoeven also showed several .... scenes in his much later film \"Elle\" (2016) with Isabelle Huppert, when the director was already 78.\n\nIn 1987, Verhoeven launched \"RoboCop,\" a satire on police state and a critique of the privatization of police, which was a trend in the US in the 1980s. Here he pushed depictions of violence to the extreme. Asked in a 2017 interview why he tends to depict violence in his films, he replied that it is part of the nature of the world, where violence is omnipresent. The movie made Peter Weller a star.\n\nIn 1989, \"Total Recall\" with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sharon Stone, after a 1966 story by Philip K. ...., was released. The critics had a mixed reaction, praising the ideas about identity conflicts, but finding the cinematic staging rather trashy. After all, the movie won an Oscar for its effects. The unclear ending of the film (fantasy or reality) and the performance of Schwarzenegger, as one of whose best films \"Total Recall\" is seen today, were also praised.\n\n1992 saw \"Basic Instinct\" starring Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone, after a screenplay by Joe Eszterhas, which he wrote in a few days and for which he received $3.5 million. The moral controversy about the famous interrogation scene was to be expected and is part of the business; after all, it was deliberately calculated in by the production team. But the one who was really angry about it was Sharon Stone herself, who portrayed herself as victim of a fraud. Someone from the production team had told her to take off her panties because the reflecting light from the panties would show that she was wearing something under the skirt. Apparently, the initial intent was to suggest that she was wearing NOTHING underneath despite the panties. She was then assured that one would actually not see anything of her anatomy even without the panties. Later, however, during a test screening in front of a selected audience, Sharon saw that there WAS something visible. This enraged her so much that she slapped director Verhoeven and then called her lawyer. But she later had no objection to keeping the scene because it would fit the film and the character (and probably also because it increased her fame).\n\n1995 saw the release of the aforementioned \"Showgirls\" starring Elizabeth Berkley and Gina Gershon (also starring, as mentioned, in the Wachowskis´ \"Bound\") which is my favorite Verhoeven film, but has been torn apart by critics in ridiculous uniformity. It was actually the amount of bare skin that made the poor critics sweat and drove them to protest. Anyway, the movie is an aesthetic work of art and has gradually found a huge following of fans who cannot understand what triggered the initial rejection. The script was again by Joe Eszterhas.\n\n\"Starship Troopers\" saw the light of day in 1997, starring Casper Van Dien, Dina Meyer and Denise Richards. The film is a dark satire on war propaganda and indulges in excessive depictions of violence. It would have got an Oscar for the great effects if \"Titanic\" hadn't been a competitor. Also worth mentioning is the impressive main theme by composer Basil Poledouris. Aesthetically, the work is heavily influenced by Leni Riefenstahl, whose life Verhoeven and Sharon Stone had planned to film, but had to abandon the idea because the production costs would have been too high. The critics sneered at the protagonists' wooden performances, but I think it was intentional, as it fits the film's satirical framework perfectly.\n\n2000 saw the release of \"Hollow Man\" starring Kevin Bacon, a horror film that explores the possibility of turning evil through invisibility. In Verhoeven´s own words: \"\"Hollow Man leads you by the hand and takes you with Sebastian into teasing behavior, naughty behavior and then really bad and ultimately evil behavior. At what point do you abandon him? I'm thinking when he rapes the woman would probably be the moment that people decide, 'This is not exactly my type of hero', though I must say a lot of viewers follow him further than you would expect.\" The film was smeared by the critics (of course...) but was a huge hit with audiences.\n\nI will present Verhoeven's subsequent 4 films, his late work, separately elsewhere.\n\nSTARSHIP TROOPERS [1997]– Official Trailer (HD) | Get the 25th Anniversary 4K Ultra HD SteelBook Now\n\nDo your part!

The passage of time, his films lacking availability and upstart critics disliking his style all contributed to his reputation.\n\nBorn Jacques Leon Louis Frederix in Brussels, he pursued an acting career in Paris to the disappointment of his prestigious family who had mapped out a military career for him. After appearing in a George Melies short film he signed up to Gaumont Films, starred in Louis Feuillade's \"Les Vampires\" and began directing mostly comic short films, in 1917 he married actress Francoise Rosay and was conscripted into the Belgian Army for two years putting his career on hold. After the war Feyder bought the rights to Pierre Benoit's popular novel \"L'Atlantide\" and spent over a year and 2 million francs (most expensive French film at the time) making a 3 hour epic that would seal his reputation practically overnight. Feyder's insistence on authenticity meant the adventure film was shot on-location in Algeria (40 years before \"Lawrence of Arabia\"), the film largely told in flashback of a French soldier finding the Lost City of Atlantis in the middle of the Sahara Desert.\n\nHis next project was \"Crainquebille\" from the Anatole France short story, an elderly vegetable seller gets arrested over a misunderstanding, is found guilty in a farcical trial and his life post-release nosedives. Less ambitious in scale than his previous film but more indicative of his later work, it's more poignant and sincere without being too sentimental, the realistic approach meant it was filmed on location with a couple surreal sequences and some biting satire. The movie also featured child actor Jean Forest, discovered by the director and his wife playing on the streets of Montmartre.\n\nFeyder travelled to the Swiss Alps for his 1925 film \"Visages d'Enfants\". After his wife's death and his struggles caring for his two young children, the mayor of a mountain village decides to remarry for his children's sake; his son (Jean Forest) doesn't take kindly to his new stepmother or stepsister. A silent film beautiful in its simplicity, the excellent acting, believable character motivations and stunning locations makes it poignant without being slushy or sentimental. Though critically acclaimed it was a box-office flop, over time it was largely forgotten about until its restoration in 2004.\n\nJacques Feyder directed his next two films in 1926. \"Gribiche\" starred his wife Francoise Rosay as an American millionairess adopting a working-class boy (Jean Forest) to give him a proper education and a better chance at life. Filmed in 30 days on a modest budget to please his new financial backer Alexander Kamenska (known for funding avant-garde French directors in the 20s), it made enough money to finance his epic adaptation of Prosper Merimee's novel \"Carmen\". As usual the movie was filmed on-location in Spain and looked wonderful but it felt too cold, too clinical to be truly moving, just like \"L'Atlantide\" the 2.5 hour running time worked against it. Interestingly two of the assistant directors would become hugely successful: screenwriter Charles Spaak and surrealist director Luis Bunuel.\n\nIn 1928 Feyder spent 3 unhappy years in Hollywood mostly directing French-language versions of American films, his only real achievement directing Greta Garbo in her final silent film \"The Kiss\".\n\nHis French comeback film was the hit crime melodrama \"Le Grand Jeu\" in 1934. An early precursor to noir films, young lawyer Pierre racks up so much debt thanks to his mistress Florence (Marie Bell) he has to join the Foreign Legion in Morocco to avoid scandal. While hanging around a bar owned by the shady Mr. Clement (Charles Vanel) and his partner Blanche (Francoise Rosay), he becomes infatuated with Irma (also Marie Bell) who suffers from amnesia. Using footage of legionnaires on location in Morocco it gave audiences another taste of exotic locations and doomed romance.\n\nAfter the dark drama \"Pension Mimosas\" Feyder directed his best known movie the lighthearted historical farce \"Carnival in Flanders\". A large 17th century village was constructed on the outskirts of Paris by Lazare Meerson, the celebrated visual style of the film was inspired by Flemish painters and the comic battle-of-the-sexes storyline is complemented by Francoise Rosay's towering performance as the Mayor's wife. With Spanish forces on their way to spend one night in the village, the Mayor and his advisors fearful of getting slaughtered opt for the path of no resistance, the Mayor feigning death in hope of avoiding the Spanish. The Mayor's wife on the other hand organises all the women to greet the Spaniards with beer and hospitality. The depiction of a town \"collaborating\" with the enemy saw it banned in Belgium and later banned in Germany. The film's assistant director Marcel Carne would make his directorial debut a year later.\n\nFollowing \"Carnival in Flanders\" and before the outbreak of WW II, Jacques Feyder directed \"Knight Without Armour\" in England and a couple other minor films before moving to Switzerland and filming his last completed film \"Portrait of a Woman\" in 1942. After his death in 1948 his reputation dipped as his lack of experimentation counted against him and the naturalistic acting style in his films was considered too old-fashioned. His insistence on authentic location shooting and naturalistic acting foreshadows the neo-realist movement while his melodramas were transformed into poetic realism by his former assistant Marcel Carne (\"Les Enfants du Paradis\")."
