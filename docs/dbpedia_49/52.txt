On a beautiful Tuesday morning, a group of individuals putting on protective gear, carrying brooms, wheelbarrows and shovels is seen sweeping on our Kasese campus. While sweeping, they share stories and laugh making the task at hand a joyful experience. Their visit is a wonderful reminder of the power of community and the impact that can be made when the communities come together to support our efforts.

Despite their busy schedules, Chikamphula Village Development Committee together with community members took time out of their day to support Orant’s efforts by keeping our workplace clean and tidy. Their efforts were a testament to their commitment to serving the community and making a positive difference.

As they worked, we chatted with Group Village Head Chikamphula, who was leading the group. We were glad to learn more about their initiatives and projects. Their dedication to improving the village is truly inspiring.

“Kasese Health Centre belongs to Orant Charities Africa (OCA) but in a true sense, it belongs to the community as we are the ones who benefit from it. As such, it is our responsibility to take care of it” says Group village head Chikamphula.

The Village Development Committee is a group of elected community members who monitor and support development projects in their area. Among other duties, the VDC takes a leading role in development activities that come together in a community. This involves knowing who is doing the development, how much money is budgeted for the development and where the money is coming from. This role helps in making sure that development projects are being implemented effectively and efficiently.

The VDC also takes community interests to the Area Development Committee (ADC) and the ADC takes it up to the district council. The VDC communicates what development projects the community wants to the government and other development partners. This plays a huge role in giving communities development projects that they need.
