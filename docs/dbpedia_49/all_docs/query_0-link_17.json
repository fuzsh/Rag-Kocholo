        "text": "A year round study on the forest resources was conducted from April 2010 to March 2011 in Baghmara Buffer Zone Community forest at central lowland area of Nepal. The main objective of the study was to analyze cost and benefit of the community forest after two decades of its management by local community. Quadrate survey in transects passing through different habitats and information collection from secondary sources were applied to find out the stocks of the forest resources and investment made. The annual income is more than 50,000 US$ and most of the financial resources generated are utilized for local development. From financial point of view, the forest is still in loss and the loss cannot be fulfilled even by selling the whole forest resources against to fulfill physical development and local needs.\n\np>Habitats used by the Python ( Python bivittatus ) were studied in lowland areas of Bardiya National Park, Nepal. The main objective of the study was to assess the specific habitats used by Python in the Park. In association with key informants? survey to identify the potential habitats areas, field investigation was conducted and found out the specific sites. Among twenty habitat sites of Python , three were currently used and remaining other were found as potential habitats. In total, six specific habitats such as burrow or holes were mostly preferred by Python . ECOPRINT 22: 85-90, 2015</p\n\nThe study was conducted in community-managed Baghmara buffer zone forest of Chitwan National Park, Nepal, to identify the colonization of large wildlife in rehabilitated forest areas within the protected area system. Total count of animals and review of secondary sources were employed for data analysis. The number of wildlife species recorded in the pre-community-managed phase was five, and their number was increased to ten during post-community-managed forest during this study. The total population of wildlife species recorded was 7 individuals in initial phase in the year 1995 that increased to 365 individuals after 20 years. The number of species and the size of population colonized were barking deer (n = 12), hog deer (n = 2), sambar deer (n = 23), spotted deer (n = 182), wild boar (n = 5), hanuman langur monkey (n = 1), rhesus monkey (n = 76), mugger crocodile (n = 35), tortoise (n = 25), tiger (n = 1), and rhinoceros (n = 3). Density of ungulates increased from 0.5 animal/km² to 104.2 animals/km² in post-management phase. There is an increased (P < 0.05) in prey population (ungulates), marsh mugger, and tortoise population in post-management phase.\n\nBarandabhar forest is a wildlife corridor connecting Chitwan National Park and Mahabharat foothills in Nepal's Inner Tarai. Chitwan harbors the largest population of the great one-horned rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis L.) in Nepal. Barandabhar forest serves as a highly potential alternative habitat to enable wildlife to move up to Mahabharat foothills mainly during the rainy season. The whole forest area was divided into four blocks from south to north and sampled plots along 1.5 km length transects spaced at intervals of 250 m apart for wildlife and disturbance signs. Wildlife signs were higher near the National Park (ANOVA, P < 0.001; Tukey's HSD, P <0.05). Disturbance signs were lower near the National Park and the Mahabharat Foothill forests and highest in the central part of the corridor. Wildlife signs were also affected by the distance of a sample plot from the edge of the corridor (ANOVA, P = 0.032), while disturbance signs were similar irrespective of the distance of a sample plot from the edge of the corridor (ANOVA, P = 0.56). The results illustrated that the central portion of the corridor near the East-West Highway is the weakest point in the corridor being flanked by the township of Bharatpur Municipality and the relocated village of Padampur."
