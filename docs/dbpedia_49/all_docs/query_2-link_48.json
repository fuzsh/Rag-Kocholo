        "text": "One of the most important elements of Village government is its committee structure. Most authorities, boards, commissions, and committees meet once a month and are comprised of a combination of Village Board members and appointed citizen representatives who provide a sounding board for community opinion. Committees often deal directly with citizen issues and make advisory policy recommendations to the Village Board.\n\nThe Village is always looking for people with a fresh perspective to serve on committees. Diversity, equity and inclusion form the basis of work in the Village of McFarland. We recognize having a diverse and inclusive organization allows us to benefit from a variety of perspectives and strengthens our ability to achieve our mission to best serve the residents of the Village. To continue equity in our community, we encourage all residents, including women and minorities, to apply to ensure our organization is diverse, equitable, and inclusive. Therefore, we welcome all residents to apply.\n\nInterested in serving? Please fill out the Village's Board, Commission, and Committee online application.\n\nIf you would prefer to apply via hard copy, contact the McFarland Administration Department. Then, place in the Village's drop box located at the McFarland Municipal Center, or send via mail to:\n\nVillage President\n\nP.O. Box 110\n\nMcFarland, WI 53558-0110\n\nPlease note that all meetings are held at the McFarland Municipal Center, 5915 Milwaukee Street, McFarland unless otherwise specified. Although meetings are normally held at the time and location noted, please refer to the meeting agenda to verify this information."
