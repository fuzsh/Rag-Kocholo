        "text": "The Village Development Committee (VDC) generally consists of the village chief, deputy chief, village secretary, and village representative of the Lao Women’s Union, Lao Front for National Construction, village elders, youth, and village land taxation unit.\n\nIn accordance with the Act, local bodies have been formed at three levels: Village Development Committee (VDC) at village level, Municipality at town level, District Development Committee (DDC) at district level.\n\nThe Regulation has provisions for Village Development Committee (VDC), District Development Committee (DDCs) and municipality to coordinate and implement development projects/programs and to provide approval or clearance of the proposed project.\n\nIn late June 2005, they took him to Buddhakani Village Development Committee (VDC), where he was allegedly killed.\n\nThe MoFALD has included a provision in the blended block grant guidelines for Village Development Committee (VDC), Municipalities and District Development Committees (DDC) to allocate 15 per cent of their capital grant to fund activities targeted for declaring child-friendly VDC, Municipality and DDC under the CFLG framework.\n\nSections 28 and 43 of the Act provide the Village Development Committee (VDC) a legal mandate to formulate and implement programs related to the protection of the environment during the formulation and implementation of the district level plan.\n\nVillage representatives of LWU and LFNC will be key members of the Village Development Committee (VDC) and participate when important decisions are made with regard to LENS2 activities.\n\nThe Village Development Committee (VDC), who is the main counterpart of the project at the village level, will be sensitized for the safeguard requirements so they can self- monitor any minor impact that may occur under the project.\n\nIf the terminated member decides to contest the termination ruling, the individual shall be provided a reasonable timeframe in which to respond in writing to the Board that addresses how they will rectify the reasons for the Board’s decision for membership termination."
