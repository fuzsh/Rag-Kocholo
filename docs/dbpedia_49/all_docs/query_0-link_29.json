        "text": "p>Communities have already felt the impact of climate change on their livelihoods. Since the risk of increased negative impacts is high, communities need to understand the climate change patterns, the likely impacts and measures to mitigate the negative impacts. This study was undertaken to assess climate change vulnerability, assess the associated risk and map it, and use these information to prepare adaptation plan. It was found that communities can assess the climate change vulnerability, and map the associated risks. They can prepare their adaptation plan to mitigate the likely negative impacts, and access resources from the local government to implement their action plan. This study has recommended that the community based climate change vulnerability assessment and risk mapping for adaptation planning tools and methodologies developed by this piloting study should be used by the local governments in their regular planning process to address the climate change issues at the community level.</p\n\nClimate change poses risks to the basic needs, human rights, and core values of individuals and communities. These risks are increasingly being described as risks to human security, which contrast with the more abstract notion that climate change poses risks to national security. This article focuses on the first of the commonly agreed climate change and security issues - that is the linkages between climate change and human security. It defines some of the key concepts of vulnerability, adaptation, and human security, which all come together in research and policy on climate change and human security. The relationship between these concepts is explained, as is the distinction between securities as is it has traditionally been understood within the discipline of political science, and human security. Furthermore this article provides an overview of the critical and applied uses of the concept of human security as it relates to climate change."
