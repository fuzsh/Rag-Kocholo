The Village offers a complimentary program to help residents alleviate these problems. The Building Division staff will survey the subject area and identify solutions to help reduce ponding in the rear yard. Solutions may include an installation of a catch basin in the rear yard, re-grading the yard or a shifting of downspouts. The Village identifies the solution at no cost, but does not contribute financially to the implementation. Access the Residential Yard Drainage Assistance Program (PDF) form."
