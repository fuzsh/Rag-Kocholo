        "text": "Background: In Nepal, plant resources play an important role in the health of local communities. However, in many parts of the country, this role and its patterns are understudied. The purpose of this study was to document medicinal plant species and assess their use among the Tamang community in Lalitpur district, Central Nepal. Methods: Ethnomedicinal information was collected through focus group discussions, semi structured interviews with local peoples and key informants from the Tamang community using rapid rural appraisal tools (RRA) across the five wards vz. Nallu, Chaughare, Bhardew, Dalchoki and Sankhu of the Konjyosom rural municipality. Botanical voucher samples were collected for scientific identification. The quantitative data were analyzed for informants consensus factor (ICF), fidelity level (FL) and relative frequency of citation (RFC). Results: A total of 176 plant species were recorded under 82 families and 158 genera as medicinal to treat different ailments. Among them, 169 species were angiosperms, one gymnosperm and six pteridophytes. Herbs (78 spp.) occurred most frequently in the study area, and the leaves (38 spp.) were commonly foraged. The most common route of consumption was oral (98 spp.) and the paste (36 spp.) was frequently administered. The majority of the species (58%) were collected from the forest. The ICF value ranged from 0.26 (digestive) to 0.97 (respiratory). The RFC value ranged from 0.01 to 0.87. Curcuma longa had the highest frequency of citation index of 0.87. is this RFC? Merge these 2 sentences The FL index ranged from 42.86% to 100%. The most preferred medicinal plant species was Curcuma longa which was used to treat cuts and wounds and common cold (51%). Conclusion: Medicinal plants have played a significant role in the health care of local people. This study provides a comprehensive documentation of ethnomedicinal plant species using among the Tamang community of Konjyosom rural municipality, Lalitpur district. This study concluded that it is necessary to document and preserve biodiversity and its associated knowledge, which may lead to additional research activities. Keywords: Ethnic people; Ethnobotanical, Informants, Interview\n\nBackground: Nepal is considered as a biodiversity hotspot with a multi-dimensional social system accompanied by vast amounts of plants and traditional knowledge regarding ethnobotanical practices. There are number of ethnic groups in Nepal whose culture is enriched by ethnobotanical knowledge that has been passed down over generations. Also, ethnobotanical knowledge is diverse in different regions of Nepal. The ethnobotany of Nepal and related archaic knowledge are of great importance to the advancement of local, national and global human society. In this study, we analyze ethnobotany in five districts within Annnapurna Conservation Area, Nepal’s largest protected area. Methods: Information was extracted from relevant publications from the year 1995 to 2021 from electronic databases following the PRISMA framework. Those extracted data from thirty-two publications were analyzed systematically. Results: This study revealed that the temporal research trend has varied significantly and that the number of research in the accessible areas were relatively higher. Despite the high occurrence of research focusing on ethnomedicinal uses, other ethnobotanical research focusing on Non-timber forest products,wild edible foods are still lacking. Conclusions: Priority should be given to relatively unexplored research topics and lesser explored areas such as wild edible foods and non- timber forest products, and pharmacognosy in the future, so that the research gap will be addressed which ultimately brings out the real potentiality of the ethnobotanical sector of Annapurna Conservation Area.\n\nBackground: For centuries, the Changunarayan municipality has been inhabited by people who have a long tradition of using medicinal plants to treat human ailments. Habitat degradation and improper harvesting are the major threats to the medicinal plant species in this area. The present study aims at documenting and identifying plant-based ethnomedicinal knowledge of the local people in order to preserve the dwindling indigenous knowledge. Methods: The primary information on the medicinal plants were collected through field observation, interviews, and a semi-structured questionnaire. A frequency index value was determined to compare the medicinal plants that were used frequently by the local people. Moreover, the factor of informant consensus (FIC) was determined for the assessment of homogeneity on the informants’ knowledge regarding medicinal plants. A Pearson correlation test and a simple linear regression were performed to evaluate the relationship between the age of respondents and plants described by them. Results: A total of 96 medicinal plant species belonging to 56 families and 85 genera were used for the 40 different ailments documented in the municipality. Herbs (n = 47) occurred most frequently in the study area, and the most frequently used plant part was leaves (n = 30). The majority of the species were collected from the wild (57%). Ocimum tenuiflorum and Curcuma longa had the highest frequency index of 65%. The value of Chi-square test between genders and the number of plants described by them was determined to be significant (p-value < 0.001). A positive correlation (r = 0.708) was found between the age groups of informants and the number of plants described by them. The FIC value in the study ranged from 0.4 (cardio-vascular) to 0.90 (fever). Conclusion: The medicinal plants have been playing an enormous role in the health care of the villagers, though the study area is very close to the capital city. The plants used in the study might open the way for the development of a scientifically verified botanical derivatives for modern medicine. Valuable traditional knowledge was limited to the older generation, which indicates a huge gap in knowledge transmission from the older to the younger generation."
