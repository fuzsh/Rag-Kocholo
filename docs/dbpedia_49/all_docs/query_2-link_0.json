        "text": "For Village Development Committee of Longkukro, see Village development committee (Longkukro).\n\nVillage Development Committees (VDCs) are voluntary associations of village people for local administration. They are extra constitutional authorities.\n\nVDCs consist of two members each from each caste in the village. The unity of villages can be accredited to this VDCs. The decision of VDCs are ultimate in the concerned villages and persons who disobey the judgement of VDC are boycotted from the villages.\n\nThe villagers solve local problems through the help of VDCs and they never need the help of Police and Courts. It is a great form of association by the villagers and it aims to achieve a strong socially fabricated society.\n\nAn example of a VDC is Ankapur Village Development Committee. Armoor Mandal has progressed greatly with the help of this VDC.[citation needed]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nVillage development committee (Nepal)\n\nLand-use planning"
