This report aims to help address how the city could increase the vibrancy, attraction, and economic stability of the Normandy Park commercial and mixed-use areas from the Manhattan Village Subarea, down along the 1st Avenue South corridor, then to the Normandy Park Towne Center and environs.\n\nRead the draft report\n\nNormandy Park – Seattle Southside Chamber of Commerce 2021 Business Survey Update\n\nWe partnered with the Chamber to update the 2019 Business Survey, providing a pre- and post-COVID 19 snapshot of Normandy Park business. The number of survey contacts increased to 139 in 2021. Although the outlook remains positive, COVID-19, workforce issues, and state and county regulations remain top concerns. Satisfaction with city services remains mixed, and awareness of the Seattle Southside Chamber and Highline Small Business Development Center remain evenly mixed between knowledge and use.\n\nSee the numbers\n\nThe City of Normandy Park is a beautiful waterfront community offering easy access to SeaTac International Airport and downtown Seattle.

By choosing to support local businesses, you help maintain Normandy Park’s unique and distinctive flavor.\n\nCommunity Well-Being\n\nLocal businesses build strong neighborhoods by sustaining communities, linking neighbors, and by contributing more to local causes.\n\nLocal Decision Making\n\nLocal ownership means that important decisions are made locally by people who live in the community and who will feel the impacts of those decisions.\n\nKeeping Dollars in the Local Economy\n\nYour dollars spent in local businesses have three times the impact on your community as dollars spent at national chains or outside Normandy Park. When shopping locally, you simultaneously create jobs, fund more city services through sales tax, invest in neighborhood improvement and promote community development.\n\nJobs and Wages\n\nLocally owned businesses create more jobs locally and, in some sectors, provide better wages and benefits than chains do.\n\nEntrepreneurship\n\nEntrepreneurship fuels America’s economic innovation and prosperity, and serves as a key means for families to move out of low-wage jobs and into the middle class.\n\nPublic Benefits and Costs\n\nLocal stores in town centers require comparatively little infrastructure and make more efficient use of public services relative to big box stores and strip shopping malls.\n\nEnvironmental Sustainability\n\nLocal stores help to sustain vibrant, compact, walkable town centers – which in turn are essential to reducing sprawl, automobile use, habitat loss, and air and water pollution.\n\nCompetition\n\nA marketplace of many small businesses is the best way to ensure innovation and low prices over the long-term.\n\nProduct Diversity\n\nA multitude of small businesses, each selecting products based, not on a national sales plan, but on their own interests and the needs of their local customers, guarantees a much broader range of product choices.\n\nPartnerships\n\nCommon Questions\n\nWhat resources exists for current and new business owners?\n\nFree Small Business Advising-link to SBDC Washington\n\nLink to work in NP 2044, economic development chapter or new ordinance work\n\nFor information linking Small Business Owners and Entrepreneurs to Washington State Resources visit www.business.wa.gov.\n\nI want to start a busines, what should I be considering?\n\nSelect a Commercial Center\n\nPermitted land use?\n\nDo I need any permits?\n\nHome-based business?\n\nObtain a Normandy Park Business License--*link to DOR\n\nWho does the EDC partner with\n\nThe Normandy Park EDC partners with local and regional associations and committees to continually improve the support needed to grow and thrive.\n\nSome of our partnerships include:\n\nFriends of Normandy Park Foundation\n\nAmerica's SBDC Washington\n\nSoundside Alliance\n\nSeattle Southside Chamber of Commerce\n\nLocalScape Mapping King Co.\n\nCity of Normandy Park"
