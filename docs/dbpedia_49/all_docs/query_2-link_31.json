About this handbook HelpAge International commissioned this handbook to document the process of setting up a Village Development Committee (VDC), which is a community-based committee managed by an inclusive group of community members to promote village economic and social development. The objectives of this handbook are: 1) To institutionalise and systemise the process of establishing an inclusive VDC; and 2) To serve as a guide for field staff and other organisations interested to support communities to establish inclusive VDCs using a holistic approach. How to use this handbook This handbook is intended for use by groups or organisations that are interested in supporting community-led development in Myanmar through VDCs, such as: national and local government agencies, international and local NGOs, faith-based groups, and community-based organisations. An organisation may choose to form a VDC as a first step of the community empowerment process. Once formed, the VDC acts as the representative of the community for all future development projects and/or government interventions. Community Empowerment is a process of developing poor peoples’ voice and capacity to engage with the range of institutions and individuals interacting with the ‘people sector’, enhancing their ability to take advantage of local livelihoods opportunities, and to demand other services and meet other needs. This is achieved through development and empowerment of self-managed grassroots institutions of the poor, which also promote participation and protection of typically excluded or marginalized groups, e.g. older people, children, women, people with disabilities, landless, IDPs/refugees. 8 This handbook should be used as a guide in forming a VDC. It provides recommended processes, policies and tips for organisations choosing to form VDCs, but is not an exhaustive ‘how-to’ manual. Some suggested policies or activities will need to be adjusted and adapted to meet different community needs. The practices and tips in the handbook are based on the successful experience of HelpAge International in forming VDCs in Myanmar.\n\n10. Village Development Committees in Myanmar Village Development Committees are membership-based community level organisations developed, formed and managed by an inclusive group of community members to promote village economic and social development. The model has been shown to be an effective means of promoting inclusive development that embraces vulnerable members of the community. VDCs, for example, can support livelihoods; enhance health, water and sanitation services and practices; strengthen local schooling; and help communities prepare for disasters. 9 Village Development Committees\n\n11. Above: VDC Members discuss community activities. What is a Village Development Committee? Summary This chapter introduces the definition and organisational structure of the Village Development Committee and provides an outline of the start-up timeline and the principles that should guide the VDC. 1.1 - Definition of a Village Development Committee (“VDC”) A Village Development Committee is an inclusive group of elected community members who lead their village in introducing economic and social development activities. 1.2 - Purpose of the VDC The VDC’s purpose is to: 1) Promote community development through an inclusive approach; 2) Encourage and motivate community members to help each other by providing a forum to discuss their problems and develop solutions; 3) Represent the village in interactions with external service providers and build relationships and highlight the needs of the community with all levels of government authorities and service providers; 4) Encourage and promote community support for vulnerable groups, such as older people, people with disabilities, youth and women-headed households. 1.3 - Principles of the VDC Inclusive Ensure that all members of society including older people, children, PwD and women have the right to participate in their own personal development as well as the development of their communities. Capacity and confidence enhancement Build capacity and competence, in both individuals and communities, to achieve results for themselves. Equip people and groups with knowledge, skills, and attitudes that build confidence and empower community members to take control of their lives. Integrated Recognise that age, disability, gender friendliness, environmental awareness, and disaster risk reduction are integral parts of all lines of action taken. 10\n\n12. 1.4 - VDC activities VDCs promote development by identifying and solving problems in their community. VDCs work closely with local authorities, NGOs, and with a wide range of community members, enabling them to make a positive contribution in the following areas (for further detail on VDC activities, see Chapter 8): Area Example Livelihood and food security VDCs can channel agriculture, small business and livestock assets to the most vulnerable or poor community members Healthcare VDCs can provide health-related training and basic medicines Water and sanitation VDCs can build water tanks, wells or sanitation facilities for the community Community fundraising VDC activities may raise funds for community use (micro-finance/revolving loan fund, welfare support to older people, children) Infrastructure development VDCs can provide electricity to their community or improve local roads or footpaths, small irrigation facilities Strengthen local schooling VDCs can work with the village administrator and township authority to improve schools, rural health centres, etcin their community Protection (older people, children, PwDs and women) VDCs activities can provide informal and formal social protection for vulnerable groups in the community 1.5 - What does a VDC look like? A VDC is an inclusive group of elected community members representing women, older people, and other vulnerable groups and community members. HelpAge recommends that at least 40% of the VDC members are representatives of vulnerable groups, such as women, older people, or people with disabilities. A VDC is organised into a main committee and sub-committees. The size of the committees will depend on the size of the community and should be decided collectively by the village. The following are examples of sub-committees: Livelihoods Health Fundraising Income Generating Ventures Education Protection Water, Sanitation & Hygiene Monitoring & Evaluation Disaster Risk Reduction 11\n\n13. 1.6 - A sample Village Development Committee organisation chart • In the experience of HelpAge in Myanmar, main committees have between 9 and 11 members and sub-committees have between 3 and 6 members. In total, the VDC as a whole usually consists of 25 to 30 individuals who represent and lead the wider community. • The size of the main committee and sub-committees can be larger or smaller, depending on the size of the village. • To promote inclusiveness, it is recommended that at least 40% of VDC Members are women, older people, or people with disabilities. 12\n\n14. 1.7 - The steps to form and manage a VDC Below are the main steps in the process of forming and managing a VDC. This handbook goes through each in detail. Phase Main steps Suggested timeline Select • Begin building linkages with government and local authorities and other groups in the village • Conduct initial needs assessment of villages • Select villages for forming VDC 3 months Mobilise • Launch Workshop at state & township level • Form an Advisory Group • Socialisation Workshop in villages 1-2 months Form • Elect main and sub-committee members • Define roles and responsibilities of the main and sub-committee members • Define rules and regulations of the VDC • Capacity building training for new VDC leaders 1 month Plan • Continued training of VDC leaders • Develop Integrated Community Action Plan • Develop Annual Plan and Fund Raising Plan • Develop assets (electricity, seeds bank, water facilities) management plans • Monthly work plan Month 3 onwards1 Manage • Conduct monthly meetings • Additional capacity building trainings • Build up VDC operational systems • VDC and sub-committee activities • Dispute resolution and promote unity Month 6 onwards Monitor • Monitoring & Evaluation On-going Recommended Project Cycle: 3 to 5 years 1 The planning phase is ongoing and typically begins from Month 3 with the training of VDC leaders. Following training, the ICAP is developed and eventually the Annual Plan. 13\n\n15. Planning to establish a VDC Summary Establishing VDCs should fit with your organisation’s priorities and goals. In this section you will find more information on the timeline for the entire process, as well as funding and staffing recommendations. 1.8 - Recommended timeline The recommended timeline for initial support in forming a VDC is at least 3 years, but preferably 5 years. The first 6 months is typically dedicated to needs analysis and forming the VDC. Once the VDC is running, it will be approximately 2 ½ to 3 years before the VDC begins to be self-sustainable, requiring less staff to monitor and guide the group. It is strongly advised not to reduce the timeline to less than 3 years, since the VDC will not be mature enough to sustain itself without support and guidance. Continuing to provide on-going but low-level guidance and assistance after 3 years is ideal. 1.9 - Funding for establishing VDCs The implementing organisation will require funding for forming, organisational capacity building and monitoring the VDCs. The VDCs themselves also require funding to begin their activities as per their Integrated Community Action Plans. VDCs are also encouraged and supported for conducting their own fundraising activities while initial support are given by the organisation. See Annex A for a list of items that should be considered when budgeting to form and support a VDC. 1.10 - Staffing suggestions During the 3 to 5 year establishment phase, the VDCs are trained and supported by a variety of staff, from project managers to trainers and technical officers. Below are brief descriptions of the types of functions that staff may need to take on in order to successfully form, manage and monitor the VDC. Annex A provides an example staffing chart and recommendations on how many staff may be needed. Note: The functions below are suggestions only and may be done by staff holding other job titles. Management The overall process of forming and managing the VDC should be supervised by an experienced project manager, who oversees the entire team working with the VDCs and ensure the VDCs are progressing. VDC organizational capacities are also assessed annually to plan and implement appropriate capacity building for VDC leaders. 14\n\n16. Coordination Depending on how many VDCs are being formed, a coordination role may also be needed. This function refers to the monitoring and coordination of VDCs, government authorities, township authorities and field staff. Typically, coordination is done at township levels; that is, the coordinator may be responsible for all VDCs in one township. Field staff Staff based in the field work closely with the VDC and with the village and township authorities. They may provide training and mentoring, attend the VDC monthly meetings, collect records and reports from the VDC, offer advice and resolve disputes. The number of field staff needed will depend on: • How many VDCs are being formed by the organisation • How advanced each VDC is (newer VDCs require more guidance) • Whether transportation is easy and distances short between villages Finance It is recommended to have a staff member, such as a Finance Officer, oversee all budget requirements and spending. Technical Depending on the number of communities that are supported through VDCs, technical staff may also be needed. Technical staff oversee the capacity building of VDCs in areas such as Livestock, Agriculture, Small Businesses and Health. They monitor the progress of VDC activities in these areas and regularly provide trainings to the communities. Monitoring & Evaluation Regardless of the number of VDCs that are formed, a Monitoring & Evaluation function is critical. This function refers to leading the overall M&E activities for the organisation, capacity building of VDC’s M&E Sub-Committees and for overseeing their performance. If many VDCs are being formed, the implementing organisation may wish to appoint an M&E Officer to be responsible for this function. Trainers Throughout the project, training is provided to VDC members on a variety of topics, such as inclusion, organisational planning and management, book- keeping, healthcare, fundraising, leadership, participatory development tools, ICAP development, small-scale business planning and management, conflict 15\n\n17. resolution, participatory M&E, etc. Some trainers may be external, while others are staff members. In either case, consider the following: • Trainers should speak the local language or dialect. • Trainers should have experience in participatory methodologies. • Trainers should know how to work with vulnerable groups and community groups. 16\n\n18. Understanding the community Summary This section reviews important steps in selecting and learning about the communities where it is appropriate to form a VDC. This includes beginning to build linkages, so that the VDC successfully works with the township authorities, village administrator and other NGOs or CBOs. There are four recommended steps to selecting the villages and understanding the community: building linkages; conducting a needs assessment; selecting the villages and conducting a baseline survey. 1.11 - Building linkages Forming a VDC is an important first step in the longer-term process of community mobilisation and community empowerment. Once developed, the VDC will function as a representative group on behalf of the community when working with government agencies, external service providers, or other NGOs. It is important that from an early stage the VDC work closely and build relationships with other organisations and agencies working within the community. Above diagram: The VDC is a vehicle for making the needs of the village known, for proposing solutions and for working with a variety of groups, including government authorities at the township and village levels, NGOs, and other government service providers (schools, health centres, etc.). Linking to the township authorities At all stages of the VDC’s development, it is important to link the VDC with the township authority. Below are a few suggestions on how to build the relationship between the VDC and the township. 17\n\n19. Before forming the VDC, it is recommended that the township authorities are consulted and informed about the VDC process. This is helpful for the following reasons: • When selecting the villages to implement VDC, the township authority can serve as an advisor and assist in selecting the villages for VDCs. • The township authority can facilitate the relationship between the implementing organisation and the village administrator. Before forming the VDC, the township authorities, relevant ministries and the village administrator can be informed about the VDC concept through a Launch Workshop (see Chapter 4). Once the VDC is formed and operating, one way to continue to involve the township authorities with the VDC’s progress is through Network Meetings. In the experience of HelpAge, Network Meetings are an opportunity for VDC members from multiple villages to share their progress, ask questions and establish a relationship with the township authority. Typically such meetings are held every second month between township authorities, project staff, and a few selected VDC members. Linking with other government service providers As the village becomes increasingly connected to government services, such as Myanmar Agriculture Services (MAS), veterinary, cooperative, transportation, education, health centres and others, the VDC should be recognized as the representative of the village in working with these groups and communicating the village’s needs and priorities. Project staff build the capacity of VDC members so they are comfortable working with service providers and recognize their role to coordinate between service providers and the community. Linking to the village administrator In order to function smoothly within the village, the VDC will need to work with the village administrator. At the same time, it is important that the administrator does not influence the VDC or stifle its progress. One helpful way to involve the village administrator is to invite the administrator to be part of an Advisory Group that oversees and advises the VDC. In some cases, the village administrator and others outside the VDC act as Advisors to the VDC’s M&E Sub-Committee (see also Chapter 8). Linking with other NGOs, CBOs or faith-based groups Once the VDC is formed and operating, it may begin to work with other community groups on activities or community improvement projects. It should be recognized from an early stage that any NGOs or CBOs entering the village should work with the VDC, since the VDC represents an inclusive group of community members. 18\n\n20. Linking with other VDCs VDCs have much to learn from each other by exchanging ideas and discussing solutions to common problems. It is also beneficial to have VDCs share their progress with other VDCs to motivate one another. In the experience of HelpAge, linking VDCs to each other was done through Township Committees and Annual Exchanges: Township Committees: One elected representative from the VDC or its sub-committees attends monthly meetings, where other VDC representatives from across the township attend. In the meetings, representatives share lessons learned, weaknesses or challenges in the VDCs and the group also may start working on township-level activities. Annual Exchange: VDC representatives from across the country share their ideas, challenges and success stories with one another. This provides a unique learning opportunity for VDC members. For example, 2 representatives from 10 VDCs may come together for a one-day exchange. 1.12 - Selecting the villages This section provides a recommended process for selecting the villages where it is appropriate to form a VDC. Step 1: Reaching out to the township authority See Section 3.1 “Linking to township authorities”. Step 2: Selection of Villages/Conducting a needs assessment Conducting an initial needs assessment of multiple villages helps determine which are best suited for VDCs. Each organisation may have their own methods for doing needs assessment for finalising villages to form VDCs, but it is recommended to assess more villages than necessary (for example, assessing 20-30 villages in order to select 10-15). Timing A needs assessment can take 10-15 days to complete, depending on how many villages are included. Analysis Data collected from the assessment should be analysed to determine which are the most vulnerable villages according to the selection criteria established by the organisation. Step 3: Village selection criteria It’s recommended that the final selection of villages be discussed with, and approved by, the township authority. The township authority may be able to provide additional information about the villages, allowing for more informed decisions to be made. In general, villages selected should be the most vulnerable 19\n\n21. and least developed in the township. Below are a few tips on what to consider when selecting the villages: What is the overall level of the community’s development? VDCs should be formed in communities with low level of economic development opportunities and infrastructure. Are there other social welfare groups already active in the village? If yes, consider how the VDC may work with these groups. If there are other NGOs active or other social groups providing similar assistance, the village may not be a good candidate for forming a VDC. Is the village difficult to access? Villages with difficult accessibility are often poor, and therefore good candidates for VDCs. At the same time, the practicalities of logistics, transportation and proximity to other villages selected also need to be considered to ensure you can provide the consistent support needed. Step 4: Conducting a baseline survey Once the villages are selected, it is recommended that a baseline survey is done to better understand the community’s level of development. The baseline survey is typically conducted by field staff, who collect information from a sample of households in the village through a simple, standard questionnaire. Questions should require straightforward, closed answers, allowing for easy data entry, information compilation and comparison. While conducting the survey, sometimes a focus-group session is done within each household. Understanding the community: Tips When conducting the needs assessment and the baseline survey, survey teams should be: gender balanced (both male and female staff); trained in survey and focus group techniques; and knowledgeable of the local context and language(s). It is recommended to request the village profile and data from the township authorities before visiting the village to conduct any assessment. This will provide survey teams with initial information on the village profile and population. 20\n\n22. Mobilising the community HelpAge through its community mobilization process build capacity of communities to identify their own priorities, resources, needs, and solutions in such a way as to promote representative participation, good governance, accountability, and peaceful change. Getting prepared • Be clear and knowledgeable about your goals • Know your target community and surrounding environment • Understand the fundamental concepts of mobilization. • Understand the fundamental concepts of mobilization. • You must have the required skills Knowing your goals The purpose of community mobilization may vary from one organization or community to the other. However, there are common elements which include: food security, livelihoods development, poverty eradication, good governance, empowering marginalized groups, and gender balance. Each of these goals are complex and can become challenging so there is need for field staff to be as clear as possible about their programme/projects. Know your target: For effective community mobilization, field staff should as much as possible about the nature of communities in general. The following information can be collected through formal or informal research into the target community: • Existing social organizations, economy, languages, etc. • Political/administrative structure • Demographic features and population • Economic activities • Social stratification and power relations • Organizations and their functions and activities • Leadership pattern and its influence • Cultural facets or traditions • Health, sanitation and nutrition levels • Education • Critical issues and problems Get Skills The skills that field staff need for mobilizing communities are not exceptionally difficult to learn. Since the target group is the community as a whole, most of the skills you need are based in her/his ability to communicate. Field staff will need to learn how to be a good public speaker, an effective leader and a good facilitator. Field staff must learn how to draw information and decisions out of a group, which requires a full understanding of the programme/project goals and a 21\n\n23. relaxed confidence in front of people. Field staff will also need to develop a personal character that is honest, enthusiastic, positive, tolerant, patient and motivated. Summary Once the villages are selected, it is important to inform all relevant stakeholders about the concept of a VDC and its benefits to the community. This section covers recommended initial steps in mobilising the community – the Launch Workshop held with village and township authorities; the Socialisation Workshop with the entire village; and the selection of the Advisory Group that helps to form the VDC. 1.13 - Overview: mobilise and socialise The first step to forming the VDC is to socialise the concept by explaining to all stakeholders – government and village authorities, village elders, and community members – what is a VDC, what is its purpose and how it can benefit the community. To do this, 3 steps are recommended and described in detail below. For the purposes of VDC, “socialisation” can be defined as: the act of bringing together a group of relevant people in an informal and social setting to discuss and reach a common understanding about the benefits of a VDC. 1.14 - Launch Workshop This workshop is a critical step in engaging the authorities that can support the VDC. One Launch Workshop may be done per township. See Annex B for an example agenda for this workshop. Objectives • Introduce the VDC concept and purpose to the government, township and village administrator. • Introduce the implementing organisation and review the importance of assisting older people and other vulnerable groups in Myanmar. • Explains expected roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders and communities Workshop participants Participants are typically high-level authorities, and may include the Chief Minister of the region/state, village administrator, township authorities, and any relevant ministry officers. Topics to be covered • Introduction of implementing organisation mission and vision 22\n\n24. • Importance of community-based development groups in Myanmar • Description of VDC, typical activities and VDC formation process and timeline • Expected roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders including Township and village authorities 1.15 - Village Socialisation Workshop After the launch, the village administrator and community residents should be aware of the idea of a VDC and ready to assist in forming a VDC in their village. The Socialisation Workshop is the first opportunity the entire village comes together learn what is a VDC and how it may benefit them. Please refer to Annex C for an example workshop agenda. Objectives • To socialise the overall concept of VDC to the community members • To tell them the steps of forming a VDC using a thorough participatory process • To tell them the benefits of a VDC • To ensure that the overall vision of VDC is clear to them • To secure their commitment to supporting the process Workshop participants Workshops are organised jointly by the field staff and the village administrator, and the entire village is invited to attend. Topics to be covered • Introduction to the implementing organisation • Introduction to VDC – What is it? How does it work? How it is formed? • Roles and responsibilities of VDCs and sub-groups • Examples of successful VDC activities around Myanmar 23\n\n25. • Selection of the VDC Advisory Group and its roles 1.16 - Forming an Advisory Group In order to ensure the VDC is recognized by all community members, it is recommended to form an Advisory Group. The Advisory Group is typically a small group of village leaders and elders that are supporters of the VDC and lead the VDC forming process in the village (see next chapter for the role and tasks of the Advisory Group). Once the VDC is formed, the Advisory Group may take on a monitoring role and work with the VDC’s M & E Sub-Committee. Typically, the Advisory Group consists of 3 to 5 persons, including: 1. Village administrator 2. Village elders 3. Other influential residents, such as teachers or religious leaders The Advisory Group should be elected during the Village Socialisation Workshop. When forming the Advisory Group, it is important to ensure the group understands the process of forming and managing a VDC. Socialisation Workshop: Tips It is important that the VDC is inclusive and that vulnerable groups, such as people with disabilities, older people and women-headed households are represented in the VDC. These principles of the VDC should be explained to the village administrator and to the community. To promote inclusiveness, field staff should aim to have at least 40% women participation in the VDC. It is also recommended that each sub-committee have at least 1 woman, 1 older person and 1 young woman representative. Such requirements, however, may be discussed and decided by the community. It may be helpful to explain the VDC project through short dramas - short plays which are organised by the field staff and features volunteers from the community – or other creative ways. Dramas are a fun way to explain the VDC forming process and portray a typical VDC meeting. 24\n\n26. Forming a Village Development Committee Summary This chapter explains the process of forming a VDC. This may be done through a Formation Meeting, which follows the 3 socialisation steps explained in Chapter 4. In the Formation Meeting the VDC Main Committee and Sub-Committees are elected and the VDC is formally established. 1.17 - VDC Formation Meeting Following the Socialisation Workshop, community meetings may be organised in coordination with the Advisory Group where communities are encouraged to elect VDC Members and discuss and decide the roles and responsibilities of the VDC. Please see Annex D for an example agenda for this meeting. Objectives • Explain the project and approaches • Explain the purpose of forming VDC and get community suggestions/ideas from community members • Establish the rules and regulations of the VDC Main & Sub-Committees • Facilitate the election of sub-committee members by community members • Facilitate the process of electing main committee members by sub- committees • Elect VDC leadership roles (President, Secretary, Treasurer, etc.) • Decide length of term for sub-committee and main committee members Participants The entire village and the village administrator are invited to attend. In addition field staff make special efforts to motivate older people, PwDs, women headed households, landless, marginal farmers to actively participate in project socialisation meetings through home visits and individual meetings as they normally avoid coming to meetings assuming that their voices would not be considered seriously by the other community members. The meeting is conducted by the field staff of the implementing organisation. Topics to be covered Establishing rules and regulations The rules and regulations of the VDC ensure clarity, transparency and unity in the group. The rules and regulations should be discussed and decided at the Formation Meeting. A template of VDC rules and regulations may be presented, and the community can add additional rules as they see fit. Annex E provides a template. 25\n\n27. Diagram: Recommended make up of the VDC Main Committee. Selecting the Main Committee and Sub-Committee Members In order to ensure the VDC Main Committee is an inclusive and representative group, the following process of electing representatives is recommended: • Sub-committees and their members are elected first and the Head of each sub-committee is automatically a member of the Main Committee; • Next, an additional representative from each sub-committee is voted into the Main Committee; and • Finally, a few additional community members, who are not on sub- committees, are also voted into the Main Committee. Like in any group, having capable, committed and motivated leaders is key to success. It is no different with the VDC Main and Sub-Committees. As much as possible, the selection of Committee Heads and Committee Members should be a democratic and transparent process. See Annex F for more details on the selection criteria for each role and tips on how to handle the voting process. Rules and regulations: Tip Once the rules and regulations are established, they should be made visible at every VDC monthly meeting so they can be easily referred to when needed. 26\n\n28. Sub-Committee selection The field staff may suggest sub-committees and the community members decide collectively which would be relevant for their group. Type and number of sub- committees depend on the programme of the implementing organisations. Typical sub-committees include: • Fundraising • Livelihoods • Income Generating Ventures • Health • Education • Protection Selecting the Monitoring & Evaluation Sub-Committee The Monitoring & Evaluation Sub-Committee should be an independent group and the members should not be VDC Members or on any other sub-committees. Members may include: Village Administrator, religious leaders, other eminent persons who are acceptable to the community. For additional details on the purpose and activities of the M&E Sub-Committee, see Chapter 8. 27\n\n29. Training VDC leaders Summary HelpAge considers VDC organisational capacity building as a continuous process. VDC capacity building aspects are discussed during monthly quarterly monitoring visits and also bi-annual and annual review meetings with VDC leaders to determine what additional trainings are needed and when. This section covers the necessary basic trainings for the newly elected VDC Members. Other training topics may be added later depending on the activities of the VDC. The basic trainings include: • Leadership and Structures • Participatory Rural Appraisal Tools • Integrated Community Action Plan (ICAP) and Annual Planning • Financial Management • Village Development Fund Management • Procurement • Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) The trainings ensure the VDC Members are well-equipped for their new responsibilities. Each training listed here is accompanied by a more detailed training guide in Annex G, which includes example agendas and useful templates for each training. Additional trainings should be provided to sub-committee members and VDC Members throughout the forming process. Suggested topics are also listed in Annex G. 1.18 - Training 1: Leadership and Structures Objectives • Ensure that VDC members approach their duties and responsibilities with transparency, accountability and integrity. • Ensure that VDC members are aware of the rules and responsibilities and know how to conduct the VDC meeting and recordkeeping. • Review the importance and due process in selecting suitable leaders. Before starting: Tips for working with vulnerable groups When conducting the trainings, it is necessary to understand how to work with vulnerable, diverse groups. Please refer to Annex H for more information [needs to be developed by HelpAge / or suggest deleting]. 28\n\n30. Participants Newly elected VDC Members.

Participants A few elected representatives of the VDC Main Committee or Sub-Committees are asked to attend. These trained representatives will then be responsible for supervising purchasing and procurement for the VDC. Topics to be covered • What is procurement? • Basic principles of procurement • Key steps of procurement • Adopting a procurement policy 1.24 - Training 7: Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) Objectives M&E Sub-Committee will obtain basic knowledge about M&E and become familiar with tools to monitor and evaluate the progress of their VDC. Participants M&E Sub-Committee Heads and one M&E Sub-Committee Member. Topics to be covered • What is M&E? • Introduction to the project cycle • Reporting format for VDC M&E Sub-Committee • Practice completing M&E reports 1.25 - Additional trainings As the VDC becomes more active, trainings should also be provided to the sub-committees on additional topics related to the VDC’s planned activities, such as Health, Livelihoods, DRR, Volunteer Home Care, Conflict Resolution and other topics. See Annex G for suggested training topics. 31\n\n33. Integrated Community Action Plans and Annual Plans Summary Once the VDC is formed and the new VDC leaders are trained, the group enters the planning stage. Here, there are following important steps: • VDCs organises community meetings ensuring representatives of all vulnerable groups actively participate in these meetings • Community members are helped to form groups based on the number of PRA tools to be practiced for analysis their situation. VDC leaders trained on PRA tools are assigned to each group to facilitate group exercises. • Each of the groups collectively analyses topics assigned to them and agree on actions to be taken by who and when • Once group exercises are completed, VDC leaders with support from Field Staff compile inputs received from each group using flip charts and present it to community members to validate key issues and their causes affecting them, prioritise needs and actions to be taken, resources needed for various actions, resources available locally and need to be mobilised, time frame for implementing actions, who would be responsible for what, etc to develop the draft Integrated Community Action Plan (ICAP) • ICAP is a long-term village development plan so VDC develops an Annual Plan based on their ICAP 1.26 - Participatory planning As the VDC plans its activities and priorities, the process should be participatory and inclusive. The VDC Members should lead the process and staff should simply facilitate. Staff should ensure women and vulnerable groups, such as women- headed households, older people, and people with disabilities are represented, participating and voicing their opinions and needs. The objective of the VDC is to empower a community to create solutions for their own development and the planning stage is an important step in this process. 1.27 - Creating an Integrated Community Action Plan It is recommended that each VDC begin by developing an Integrated Community Action Plan (ICAP). The purpose of the ICAP is the first and foremost step to bringing community members including most vulnerable households and stakeholders to collectively analyse their situation, identify the needs and priorities of the entire village in order to decide how the VDC can take action to improve the community. The ICAP is then used to help the VDC develop their 32\n\n34. Annual Plan. The ICAP is usually developed through multiple meetings with the VDC and other community members; project staff act as facilitators. Objectives Identify social, economic and environmental problems and analyse root causes and prioritise the needs of the community. Discuss possible actions to be undertaken by communities and the resources required and action plans. ICAP process Using Participatory Rural Appraisal tools (see Chapter 6, Training 2) the community and VDC Members work together to identify problems in their village relating to health, education, livelihoods, etc. Next, residents prioritise problems and discussing in-depth solutions to the first priority problem identified by the community. Finally, the group should plan possible solutions and a broader timeframe. This should be done by discussing what can be done by the VDC, by community members, the village administrator, government and the project field staff. See Annex G for a training guide on ICAP, including methodologies for identifying, prioritising, and solving problems. Annex I provides an example ICAP template. 1.28 - Developing the Annual Plan Developing an Annual Plan helps the VDC set goals and assign responsibilities and it is an opportunity for the Main Committee and Sub-Committees to discuss and decide on what activities will be done during the year. The Annual Plan should also include the actions the VDC will take to solve the first priority need identified in the ICAP. Objectives For each annual goal or activity, the Annual Plan should include: • Task to be done • Assigned sub-committee and other responsible person • Expected costs of activity, community contributions and resources expected from external sources • Expected income of activity • Timeline (month during which activity will be completed) 33\n\n35. Annual Plan process The Annual Plan is drafted after the ICAP process. It is created through meetings with the VDC members and the field staff. The role of the Staff is to supervise and advise as necessary, but the process should be led by the VDC Members. The following is a recommended process for developing the Annual Plan with the VDC: Each sub-committee presents their proposals for activities to the group for discussion. The VDC as a group agrees by consensus on each activity and its budget. The Annual Plan is then documented. (For example, by writing it on a large piece of paper, or printing it on vinyl, and displaying it in the venue at each monthly meeting.) At the end of the year, the Annual Plan is reviewed by the VDC and the M&E Sub-Committee to determine whether goals were met or whether adjustments should be made for the next year. Refer to Annex I for a template of an Annual Plan. Annex G provides a training guide on Annual Planning for VDC Leaders, including further details on the steps involved in the process. 34\n\n36. Managing and sustaining VDC activities Summary This section details how to manage and sustain VDC activities. Further details are provided on the structure of VDC monthly meetings, as well as more information on each sub-committee and its activities. Also included are tips on successfully managing VDCs. 1.29 - Monthly meetings Each month the VDC Main Committee and Sub-Committees meet as a group to review their progress, discuss new activities or resolve problems. During the entire project cycle, meetings are observed by field staff. Participants All VDC Main Committee and Sub-Committee members and field staff. Suggested length 2 - 3 hours Agenda and meeting minutes The VDC President and Secretary set the agenda for the meetings and also Chair the meetings. Agenda points and decisions from each meeting should be recorded by the Secretary and records should be kept for easy reference. See Annex J for an example agenda and a template for meeting minutes. Monthly meetings: Tip Consider encouraging participants to sit in a circle, to facilitate active participation and inclusivity (see photo above). 35\n\n37. 1.30 - Tip s for successful VDCs Adopting a clear mission Each member should clearly understand what the VDC does and how it may benefit their community. Each member must also understand roles and responsibilities of the others and themselves. Without clear objectives and communication, the VDC members may disagree about the VDC activities, leading the group to be divided. In order to ensure the mission of the VDC is clear to all, VDCs will often publicly post their rules, regulations and other mission statements around their meeting room. Promoting unity For the VDC to succeed, the group needs to be united and working towards the same goals. To promote unity in the VDC, consider: • Having membership cards, buttons, uniforms, or other distinguishing items for the VDC members; and • Displaying the rules and regulations, organisation chart, annual plan and photos of successful activities around the meeting venue. In extreme cases of disunity, the VDC has been dissolved and the entire VDC selection process re-started. Encouraging participation If there are members that regularly keep quiet during the meetings, consider having a Suggestion Box (pictured above) where they can anonymously leave their recommendations. Motivating members The VDC should establish an attendance policy that requires members’ attendance at the monthly meeting and determine under what conditions a member should be relieved of their duties, should they miss multiple meetings. Should attendance drop at the monthly meetings, action should be taken by the field staff and the VDC to encourage members to participate and the VDC Main Committee should try to learn why others are not attending. Accurate recordkeeping It is critical that the VDC records meeting minutes and financial information to ensure transparency among the group. The records are often a way to resolve disputes and ensure the VDC is on-track with its goals. To promote accurate recordkeeping, training should be given on the importance of keeping records and records should be regularly reviewed by field staff. 36\n\n38. 1.31 - Sub-Committees and their activities The VDC Sub-Committees lead many of the VDC’s activities. In this section, examples of typical VDC Sub-Committees are described in detail along with examples of their activities. Refer also to Annex F for detailed roles and responsibilities for each sub-committee. Livelihood Sub-Committee Many VDCs across Myanmar choose to have a Livelihood Sub-Committee, whose activities work to improve the livelihood of community members by providing training in livestock, agriculture and small business management or through other activities, such as Livelihood Asset Programs. Common objectives of Livelihood Sub-Committees 1. Provide training in livestock, skills associated with small scale businesses and agriculture techniques to community members; and 2. Select and monitor beneficiaries of any Livelihood Asset Program. Training for the Livelihood Sub-Committee It is recommended that the Sub-Committee receive training on techniques in livestock and agriculture, which they can then deliver in the community (i.e. training of trainers). 37\n\n39. Example activities of Livelihood Sub-Committees Livelihood Asset Program Many Livelihood Sub-Committees choose to develop a Livelihood Asset Program. VDCs across Myanmar do this activity very successfully. Through this activity, the poorest and most vulnerable community members receive livestock or agriculture assets (not cash) to help them generate a sustainable income. Typical assets may include goats, pigs, sheep or other livestock or fertiliser, seeds or other agricultural products or tools. After receiving an asset, the beneficiaries may have 6 months to 1 year to repay a percentage of the cash value of the asset. Typically, repayment of the full value of the asset is not required; however, decisions on the terms of the program should be made by the VDC and the implementing organisation. For further details on how to establish a Livelihood Asset Program, including necessary training and recommendations of borrowing terms, see Annex K. Diagram: Example cycle of a Livelihood Asset Program. Payback terms and purchasing terms are decided by each VDC. Livelihood Trainings In addition to providing livelihood assets, the Sub-Committee also typically organises trainings for community members about new agriculture techniques or information about how to prevent disease in livestock. 38\n\n40. Income Generating Ventures (IGV) Sub-Committee Many VDCs decide to form an IGV Sub-Committee, which creates a small, sustainable business that will consistently bring income to the VDC and promote village development. Process and training Setting up the IGV requires support and guidance from the field staff. Further detail on how to assist in setting up the IGV, including business plan templates, are provided in Annex L. Training should also be provided to the IGV Sub- Committee on business management practices and recordkeeping. Tips for successful IGVs: The selected IGV is to be decided by the VDC, but it should also depend on what livelihood or business activity is most feasible in the community. For example, it is not recommended that a village that is not near water attempt to establish a fishing business. The IGV Sub-Committee should consider not only what business will bring in most income, but also what business will benefit the community the most. The implementing organisation may wish to provide the VDC with the initial capital to start the business. For example, should the VDC want to provide electricity with a generator, the implementing organisation may consider purchasing the generator on behalf of the VDC. A realistic income goal should be set for the IGV. IGV business plans should be reviewed by the Main Committee and Sub- Committees as a group and field staff to ensure they are realistic and viable. IGVs should not promote unhealthy or unsustainable practices. Liquor stores or lottery carts do not solve the community’s priority problems and therefore should not be approved. 39\n\n41. Example Income Generating Ventures Electricity provision Many VDCs have decided to provide electricity to their village. These businesses either take the form of hydro-power or generators. Costs include purchasing the generator or installing the hydro-power wheel, repairs, fuel, and operator salary. The business not only generates income, but also directly improves the lives of all residents. Tractor rental Another successful VDC business is tractor rental. One VDC in Mah Laing Township, for example, purchased a tractor and rents it out to farmers for a daily rate. The VDC IGV is responsible for managing the rental schedule, payments and any repairs. This business generates income and reduces the time farmers spend ploughing their fields. Livestock rearing VDCs may choose to purchase livestock to raise and then sell for income. The VDC often asks a vulnerable community member to take care of the livestock; when the animals are sold, this person receives a portion of the profits. Rice or seed banks IGV Sub-Committee may run a rice or seed bank. After speaking with farmers about their needs, rice or seeds are purchased in bulk and provided to village farmers. Rather than charging farmers, they are required to pay back a portion (e.g. 25%) in seeds or rice. In this way, the bank sustains its resources. 40\n\n42. Fundraising Sub-Committee To raise money for VDC activities, many VDCs form Fundraising Sub-Committees. To be sustainable, it is important that following the initial start-up period, all VDC activities are implemented through the group’s own funds. Common objectives of Fundraising Sub-Committees Fundraising is key to support and implement the VDC’s Annual Plan. The primary objective of the Fundraising Committee is to run activities that will raise money for the Village Development Fund. How much money is raised will vary by village, but as an example, the Sub-Committee may aim to raise between 3 and 4 Lakh/year. Fundraising has the following components: • Deciding the various fundraising activities for the year • Estimating how much will be raised from each activity • Running the activity and collecting the money Training Fundraising Sub-Committee Heads should learn the basics in planning and executing fundraising activities. Annex M includes a suggested training plan. Use of the funds and fund management Please see Chapter 9. Example activities of Fundraising Sub-Committees Microloans Many VDCs choose to begin a microloan program and provide small loans to residents at a reduced interest rate. The interest payments are put towards the Village Development Fund (see also, Chapter 9). Small stores or mobile stores VDCs may choose to invest in a small store with basic items such as petrol, rice, noodles etc. In some cases the store runs from a VDC Member’s home and in others the store is a ‘mobile store’ on a motorbike. 41\n\n43. Health Sub- Committee A Health Sub-Committee is often formed to assist community members with health needs, including providing home-care for older or disabled persons, transporting emergency cases to hospital or increasing awareness about disease prevention. Training and supplies The Health Sub-Committee should receive training by the Health Officer on basic first aid care and home care practices. Each VDC may also provided with a First Aid Kit, and Health Sub-Committee members should be familiar with its contents. Example activities of Health Sub-Committees Volunteer-based home care Often VDCs develop volunteer-based home care programs, where volunteers visit elderly, disabled, vulnerable or other needy people at their home and provide basic care. In some villages, the home care is done directly by the Health Sub- Committee members, while in others community members or youth are recruited as home care volunteers. In either case, home care volunteers should receive basic training in home care practices. Medical supplies Often the VDC Health Sub-Committee manages a stock of medical supplies and is responsible for replenishing them as necessary. Emergency transport The Sub-Committee may choose to reserve an annual budget to transport emergency cases to the local hospital. Village training Health Sub-Committees often provide or arrange trainings and workshops at the village level on health related topics. 42\n\n44. Monitoring & Evaluation Sub-Committee The Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) Sub- Committee plays a vital role in the VDC’s development and sustainability. It is responsible for monitoring the progress of the Main Committee and Sub-Committees and for providing recommendations for improvement to the VDC. Training It is recommended that the M&E Sub- Committee receive a one-day training on M&E practices and principles. M&E is a new process for many committee members and it is important they understand their role clearly. See Annex G for a proposed agenda for this training. Process The M&E Sub-Committee is encouraged to attend each VDC meeting and to be aware of the activities of each sub-committee. The following three methods are often used by VDC M&E Sub-Committees to evaluate the group’s progress: • Evaluate the progress of the VDC against the Annual Plan. • Monitor the status of the beneficiaries of the Livelihood Assets or Microloans. • Provide recommendations and suggestions to the VDC. Reporting See Annex G for template forms for M&E Monthly Reports and beneficiary reports. In addition to evaluating the VDC’s progress, the M&E Sub-Committee also may serve as an important focal point for the field staff to understand the VDC’s progress and any challenges the group is facing. M&E Sub-Committee: Tips M&E Sub-Committee members should be independent from the VDC. Members who are on other sub-Committees or who are VDC members should not be on the M&E Sub-Committee. Some villages also invite the village administrator or other respected persons to act as advisors for the M&E Committee (see also Chapter 4, Section 4.4). 43\n\n45. 1.32 - Other activities by the VDC Some VDC activities are best managed by the VDC as a group rather than a specific sub-committee. These activities should be discussed and documented in the Annual Plan. Each activity usually has its own annual budget. Examples of common activities include: Education scholarships VDCs may allocate a portion of their budget to providing scholarships to students. Community donation / development VDCs may decide to work with the village administrator to financially contribute to community development projects, such as improving water supplies or rebuilding roads, public buildings and wells. Right: Communities often identify a lack of water as a priority problem in the ICAP. As a result, VDCs have built water tanks, wells and pipes that successfully deliver water to the entire community. Funeral grants A small budget is often allocated to providing funds for funerals of needy residents. Health grants A small budget may be allocated to providing funds for residents who are in need of health care, such as major surgery. Emergency funds An annual budget may be allocated for emergency funds for residents. The decision to use the funds should be made by the VDC by a vote. 1.33 - Temporary project sub-committees Should the VDC decide to pursue a large project, such as building a water tank, they may wish to develop a temporary project committee to lead it. At all times when electing new sub-committee members, the process should be democratic 44\n\n46. and transparent. The members should clearly understand their role and goals and the committee should be dissolved once the project is complete. Fund management Summary A major part of the VDC’s responsibilities is to accurately and transparently manage the Village Development Fund. This includes: • Recording income and expenses of all activities • Monitoring and growing the Village Development Fund • Transparently purchasing items (procurement) This section will describe the process involved with the 3 activities above. 1.34 - What is the Village Development Fund (VDF)? The VDF refers to all money raised and managed by the VDC, including money from fundraising efforts, asset repayments and loan interest and profit from income generating activities. Purpose The purpose of the VDF is to support the development of the community through VDC activities and community-based financing of economically viable income-generating activities by vulnerable groups. Management of the Village Development Fund The VDF is managed by the VDC Treasurer and Accountant with close supervision by the VDC Main Committee. The Fundraising Committee coordinates all fundraising efforts and loan disbursement and payments. Principles of fund management Transparent All processes should adhere by transparent procedures. Clear All transactions must be documented. Sustainable Loans and grants should only be given for sustainable and viable businesses. 1.35 - Managing income and expenses The Treasurer and Accountant work closely together to monitor and record all income and expenses of the VDC. The Fundraising Sub-committees with support from Livelihood Sub-Committees are responsible for keeping up to date records of all loans and payments for their sub-committees and reporting them to the Treasurer and Accountant. 45\n\n47. The VDC Treasurer and Accountant should receive training on recordkeeping and financial management. For more details on the role of the Treasurer and Accountant see Annex F. For details on the necessary trainings, see Annex G. 1.36 - Growing the Village Development Fund There are 4 main activities that generate funds for the VDC into the VDF. For details on each activity, please refer to Chapter 8, which describes each activity in further detail. Diagram: Fund-generating activities. Fundraising activities, interest from loans, and livelihood asset repayments are managed by the Fundraising Sub-Committee; income generating ventures are managed by the IGV Sub-Committee. All funds raised and profit generated is given to the VDC Treasurer to be added to the VDF. 1.37 - Important fund management policies Developing guidelines for managing the VDF is an important step in ensuring that all group members understand the process. Policies also help serve as a reference if there is disagreement over how to manage the money, as they are terms that the group has already agreed upon. It is recommended that each VDC develop loan management and procurement guidelines that are suited to their group’s needs, such as the two policies referred to here: Fund management: Tip To ensure transparency, the VDC Treasurer often announces the balance of the VDF and the monthly income and expenditure at the VDC monthly meeting. The Treasurer and Accountant may keep separate records, as a way to check their accuracy and have a back up, should anything happen to one set of documents. It is recommended that the VDC open a bank account, which requires the signatures of multiple officers in order to withdraw money. 46\n\n48. Loan terms and conditions Please see Annex N for recommendations on the terms and conditions and principles involved in fund management. VDC procurement process The VDC should conduct all purchasing in an ethical fashion. A Procurement Policy should be developed with the VDC and closely followed. For an example policy, see Annex O. Prior to handling Procurement, VDC members should receive training on Procurement Processes (see Chapter 6). In the experience of HelpAge, typically 3 VDC Members were selected for training: VDC President, Accountant and Treasurer. Those who receive training are then responsible for overseeing and managing the VDC’s Procurement Process. 47\n\n49. Monitoring & Evaluation Summary Throughout the VDC project, Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) should take place. This chapter provides further details on the frequency, principles and tools for the M&E process led by the implementing organisation. For details on the M&E activities conducted by the VDC M&E Sub-Committee, see Chapter 8. 1.38 - Principles of the M&E process M&E is a process which aims to assess the success or failure of projects and initiatives based on data collection, analysis and logical assessment. M&E processes are needed to objectively and accurately assess the quality of a VDC project, so that areas for improvement can be identified and acted upon (with guidance) and the overall quality of the VDC can be improved. The M&E process should be inclusive, independent and action-oriented. Inclusive Evaluate the project by speaking with multiple stakeholders. Independent M&E Officer should be an independent evaluator and should not be involved in implementing the project. Action-oriented Weaknesses should be addressed through an action plan prepared by the field staff. 1.39 - Responsibilities for M&E VDC M&E Sub-Committee VDC Advisory Group M&E by Project Staff Closely monitor progress of VDC Main & Sub- Committees Monitor progress of any loan or asset program beneficiaries Provide updates and reports to project staff Work closely with VDC M&E Sub-Committee Provide advice, guidance and feedback to M&E Sub- Committee on VDC progress Rely on VDC M&E Sub- Committee to provide updates and highlight issues Conduct independent evaluations in addition to VDC M&E Sub-Committee Extensive and external evaluations may also be conducted The VDC M&E Sub-Committee and the VDC Advisory Group should work closely and openly with project staff to share M&E information and updates. In addition to relying on the VDC Sub-Committee and Advisory Group for reporting on VDC progress, project staff should also conduct independent evaluations of the VDC. 48\n\n50. When an organisation is forming multiple OPSHGs, it is recommended that M&E should be led by an M&E Officer from the implementing organisation. To ensure objective assessments are made, the M&E activities should be done by someone who is not directly involved in the forming or management of the OPSHG and ideally should be neutral and objective in his/her assessment. 1.40 - Suggested M&E calendar It is recommended that project staff provide monthly updates on the progress of the VDC. These monthly progress reports may be provided by field staff and should also report on whether any VDCs are facing special challenges. On an annual basis, it is helpful to have an external evaluator – i.e. someone not directly involved in the VDC forming and management process – to assess the strengths, weaknesses and progress of the VDC. Following the project cycle, at the conclusion of the implementing organisation’s involvement in the VDC, quarterly visits to the VDC are helpful to ensure the group is sustaining its activities and continues to work towards community development. 1.41 - Recommended tools for M&E Conducting site visits Site visits provide a full picture of the VDC and allow evaluators to speak with a number of stakeholders involved in or with the VDC, including: • Township Level – Township authority • Village Level – VDC Main Committee, village administrator, sub-committee members, other VDC members, other residents • Field office – field staff and trainers Quantitative tools Quantitative M&E tools seek to collect objective data about the performance of a VDC, so that they can be compared over time, between VDCs, and with other similar programs. Basic types of data that could be collected might include: • Number of members • Type of activities and number of participants/beneficiaries in each • Loan data • Village identification data (income level, health indicators, etc.) Qualitative tools Qualitative tools seek to form a better understanding of the VDC’s performance based on personal accounts and individual stories about what happened over the life of the VDC and in the M&E period. Ways to record this information include: • Interviews – speaking one-on-one with people about the VDC. 49"
