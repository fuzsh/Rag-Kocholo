        "text": "Climate change is a process of change in the state of climate that can be identified using statistical tests of changes in mean or variability of its properties, which persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer. Nepal being a mountainous and economically poor country, the risk of climate change is higher here.Being agriculture the main occupation of the country, impact of drought and irregular rainfall is severe here.Keeping these facts in mind this community work was conducted. The main objective of thiscommunity work is to make the village community familiar about the climate change and its impact in environment. Similarly, this activity will help them to know the adaptation methods to cope with impact of climate change like drought. Nagarkot was selected as the study site since it lies in Bhaktapur, one of the nine highly vulnerable districts. The impact of climate change is seen in agriculture, water sector, and forest areas. The main occupation of the local people is agriculture but the impact of climate change is seen in agriculture which has made livelihood of the people difficult. The community was mate conscious about the climate change and its impact. Different methods of adaptation to climate change were discussed with the community through the household survey, focused group discussion and meetings. The materials used were posters, pamphlets, flip charts and booklets. The community work was fruitful to make the indigenous Tamang people alert about the impacts of climate change and adaptation. Similarly, indigenous knowledge of the community in agricultural practice and natural resource management was learned from the community. The community work shows there risk of drought in the village and negative consequences in agriculture. People are slowly shifting their occupation from agriculture to making local alcohol. It is due to less production from agriculture. People are also destroying the forest to produce alcohol, which is increasing the risk of deforestation in the area. It shows potential risk of drought in the study area. So, integrated approach of the institutions as well as community should be initiated to form LAPA in the VDC. Key words: Climate change, Drought, Agriculture, Rainfall, Risk Submitted by SristikaAdhikari Symbol no: 43/069 M.Sc. 3rd Semester, CDES, TU\n\nIntroduction: Global consciousness on climate change problems and adaptation revolves around the disparity of information sharing and communication gap between theoretical scientific knowledge at academic end and practical implications of these at the vulnerable populations' end. Coastal communities facing socioeconomic stress, like densely populated Sundarbans, are the most affected part of the world, exposed to climate change problems and uncertainties. This article explores the successes of a socio-environmental project implemented at Indian Sundarbans targeted towards economic improvement and aims at communicating environmental conservation through organized community participation. Case description: Participatory rural appraisal (PRA) and the wealth rank tool (WRT) were used to form a \" group based organization \" with 2100 vulnerable families to give them knowledge about capacity building, disaster management , resource conservation and sustainable agriculture practices. Training was conducted with the selected group members on resource conservation, institution building, alternative income generation activities (AIGA) like, Poultry, Small business, Tricycle van, Organic farming and disaster management in a participatory mode. The climate change 'problems–solutions' were communicated to this socioeconomically marginalized and ostracized community through participatory educational theater (PET). Discussion and evaluation: WRT revealed that 45 % of the population was under economic stress. Out of 2100 ben-eficiaries' , 1015 beneficiaries' started organic farming, 133 beneficiaries' adopted poultry instead of resource exploitive livelihood and 71 beneficiaries' engaged themselves with small business, which was the success stories of this project. To mitigate disaster, 10-committees were formed and the endemic knowledge about climate change was recorded by participatory method validated through survey by structured questionnaire. As a part of this project 87 ha of naked deforested mudflat was reclaimed with endangered mangroves involving target community members aimed to sequester CO 2 , control soil erosion and act as a barrier during natural disasters. Conclusion: This case study concluded that participatory method of communication, aiming not only to communicate theoretical knowledge, but also to devise adaptation strategies through conservation of endemic knowledge, popularizing sustainability through Micro Finance Institutions and promoting AIGA along with motivating vulnerable community to restore degraded forest lands, could be a effective solution to practically combat climate change problems.\n\nAt the end of the first semester of third year, the department of history, political science and public administration organizes an academic trip for students to embark on a week long field trip where they visit several occupational environments with the aim of providing students with a visual experience of what is learn in class. Given the fact that students have been well grounded in the theoretical underpinnings, this course exposes them to site personnel, knowledge and practices. At the conclusion of the field trip, students are expected to submit a written report, which should be a descriptive and critical analysis of their experience. The fieldwork trip to Coast region was from 4th to 10th August, 2013. In attendance were two lectures, four drivers, and a hundred and twenty two students from Moi Main Campus, Moi KPA Campus and Moi West Campus. The department of history, political science and public administration is sub-divided into two fields of discipline: 1. political science and public administration, and 2. penology and correctional Detailed information is provided in the annexes. Aim: To provide students with an avenue for practical learning in the field Objectives At the end of the field trip, the student is expected to have achieved the following objectives: 1. To gain visual experience of what is learnt in class; 2. To provide students with an avenue for interaction with other professionals in the field so as to gain a hands-on experience in the field situation; 3. To gain experience in practical work performance; In chapter one I will highlight history of the stations; vision, mission, core values, goals and objectives; Organizational structure; Roles and functions of the organization. Chapter two highlight the roles of the institutions visited in resource management, service delivery and administrative systems. Chapter three highlights the experience I personally in the course of fieldwork. Chapter four I will express challenges faced as individual or group during the field course and suggest recommendations to improve the fieldwork course schedule.\n\nThe next objective of the sub national and local community REDD awareness program was to form the REDD CSO platform. So, the national workshop and REDD CSO platform was organized on Mangshir 24th 2071. Civil Society Organizations (CSO) had been actively engaged in national REDD+ planning and formulation of R-PPs in 2010. DANAR also had actively participated on the program including FECOFUN, Forest action, ACOFUN, NFA and other. They have continued to play an active role in partnering with respective governments to implement consultation activities, and have been included as part of the national REDD+ technical bodies responsible for REDD+. That’s why REDD CSO platform was made and sharing workshop was made. The CSOs' participation in this region has contributed to significant improvements in Readiness Preparation Proposals (R-PP) prior to their submission to the FCPF. REDD+ is a new concept and most of the CSOs in Nepal and especially in the local community and CBOs are not familiar about it. In order to engage them in the REDD+ Readiness process and effective involvement in REDD plus projects at the national and local level there is a need to enhance their capacity. In the above-mentioned context, proper development of REDD+ strategy is possible through free, prior and informed consent, effective coordination and consultation with all the stakeholders particularly right holders including indigenous people, forest dwellers, forest dependents, women, youth and Dalits. Therefore, the national level CSO workshop and REDD CSO platform was organized in the Union house on 24th Mangshir 2071(10 th December 2014)."
