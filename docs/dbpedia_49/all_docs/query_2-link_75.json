        "text": "CAP support for rural development\n\nThe CAP’s contribution to the EU's rural development objectives is supported by the European agricultural fund for rural development (EAFRD). The EAFRD budget for 2021-27 amounts to €95.5 billion, which includes an injection of €8.1 billion from the next generation EU recovery instrument to help address the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe rules for rural development spending during 2021-22 are laid out in the CAP transitional regulation, adopted on 23 December 2020. The regulation largely extends the existing rules (initially in place for the 2014-20 period), with some additional elements to ensure a smooth transition to the new CAP, which began in 2023.\n\nRelated information\n\nRural development in graphs and figures\n\nPrevious programming periods\n\nRural development programmes\n\nEU countries implement EAFRD funding through rural development programmes (RDPs). RDPs are co-financed by national budgets and may be prepared on either a national or regional basis. While the European Commission approves and monitors RDPs, decisions regarding the selection of projects and the granting of payments are handled by national and regional managing authorities.\n\nEach RDP must work towards at least four of the six priorities of the EAFRD:\n\nfostering knowledge transfer and innovation in agriculture, forestry and rural areas;\n\nenhancing the viability and competitiveness of all types of agriculture, and promoting innovative farm technologies and sustainable forest management;\n\npromoting food chain organisation, animal welfare and risk management in agriculture;\n\npromoting resource efficiency and supporting the shift toward a low-carbon and climate resilient economy in the agriculture, food and forestry sectors;\n\nrestoring, preserving and enhancing ecosystems related to agriculture and forestry;\n\npromoting social inclusion, poverty reduction and economic development in rural areas.\n\nThe EAFRD priorities are in turn broken down into 18 specific focus areas. In their programmes, countries set out targets relating to their chosen priorities and focus areas, as well as a strategy for meeting their targets.\n\nWhen devising their strategies, countries select from a 'menu' of 20 broad policy measures, which can be tailored around national and regional circumstances to deliver on one or more of the EAFRD’s priorities. Progress on targets is monitored through the common monitoring and evaluation framework (CMEF).\n\nEuropean CAP Network\n\nThe European (EU) CAP Network is set up to enable networking of national CAP networks, organisations and administrations in the field of agriculture and rural development at Union level.\n\nIt serves as a forum for discussion and exchange of good practices on the implementation of the CAP for a wide variety of stakeholders, including Member State administrations, agricultural producers, evaluators, local action groups, European-wide organisations, farm advisory services providers, innovation support services and more.\n\nThe network supports the design and implementation of CAP Strategic Plans, innovation and knowledge exchange, including EIP-AGRI, and evaluation of the CAP.\n\nThe EU CAP Network provides a broad range of activities and information on the implementation of the CAP Strategic Plans across the EU, including a collection of good practices, events and publications.\n\nThe EU CAP Network replaced the European network for Rural Development (ENRD), including Evaluation Helpdesk and EIP-AGRI network.\n\nLEADER\n\nLEADER is a 'bottom up' approach, in which farmers, rural businesses, local organisations, public authorities and individuals from different sectors come together to form local action groups (LAGs). LAGs prepare their own local development strategies and manage their own respective budgets.\n\nThe LEADER approach strengthens bonds in local communities, encourages innovations across sectors, and facilitates knowledge sharing amongst LAGs at national and EU-wide levels.\n\nThanks to its success over 30 years, the LEADER approach has been adopted by the European regional development Fund (ERFD), the European social fund (ESF) and the European maritime and fisheries fund (EMFF) as part of wider community led local development (CLLD). Today LEADER / CLLD groups manage tens of thousands of projects with economic, cultural, social and environmental benefits in rural Europe.\n\nThe ENRD provides detailed information on the LEADER approach, including resources, toolkits, and a database of LAGs.\n\nThe future of rural development\n\nUnder the new CAP, rural development actions will be included under the framework of national CAP strategic plans from 2023 onwards.\n\nWithin this framework, the Commission aims to make rural development actions more responsive to current and future challenges such as climate change and generational renewal, while continuing to support European farmers in a sustainable and competitive agricultural sector. Rural development actions will also make a strong contribution to the Commission’s key priorities and strategies, such as the European Green Deal and the long-term vision for rural areas.\n\nLegal bases\n\nRegulation (EU) 1303/2013 – presents common rules applicable to the European structural and investment funds (ESIF)\n\nRegulation (EU) 1305/2013 on support for rural development by the European agricultural fund for rural development (EAFRD)\n\nRegulation (EU) 1306/2013 on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy\n\nRegulation (EU) 1310/2013 on support for rural development by the European agricultural fund for rural development (EAFRD)\n\nCommission Delegated Regulation (EU) 807/2014 on support for rural development by the European agricultural fund for rural development (EAFRD) and introducing transitional provisions\n\nCommission Delegated Regulation (EU) 640/2014 on the administration, withdrawal of support or conditions of penalties applicable to direct payments, rural development support and cross compliance\n\nCommission Implementing Regulation (EU) 809/2014 outlining how Regulation (EU) 1306/2013 the administration and control system, rural development measures and cross compliance should be applied"
