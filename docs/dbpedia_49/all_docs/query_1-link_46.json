Balla, Sukhdev Chaudhary, and Thakur B. Karkee Institute of Forestry, Tribhuvan University, Pokhara, Nepal SOURCES PRODUCER TRADER USERS The following agencies and individuals had important roles to play in our <strong>RRA</strong> training and wood energy research. The program was jointly funded by the FAO Regional Wood Energy Development Program (Bangkok), FAO/SIDAâ€™s Forests, Trees and People Program, and Khon Kaen University. We are especially appreciative of the help of Cor Veer of FAO and Drs. Terry Grandstaff, Terd Charoenwatana, and their colleagues at Khon Kaen University. Mr. Suriya and Dr. Don Messerschmidt served as research advisers in the field. We also wish to thank Dr. I.C. Dutta, Dean of the Institute of Forestry, several faculty colleagues (especially R.K. Pokharel, S.K. Shrestha, B.P. Subedi, and C. Upadhyaya), and the staff of the IOF Project for their help in many ways. Opinions expressed in this report are those of the authors, not necessarily of the sponsoring agencies."
