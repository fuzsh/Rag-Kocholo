        "text": "Venus Williams is a famous American tennis player and the elder sister of Serena Williams. Venus Ebony Starr Williams was born in 1980 in Lynwood, California, and grew up among her four sisters. She started training as a future tennis star in one of the best tennis schools in California. When she was 17 years old, she became the first unseeded participant of US Open final tournament. The first peak of her career was in the early 2000s when Venus managed to win gold in the Olympic Games in Australia, as well as a number of awards in double teaming up with his sister Serena. However, in the mid-2000s she had an injury and could not take part in many competitions. In 2008 Venus managed to win a historic Wimbledon final where she played against her sister Serena, followed by one more triumph in doubles in the 2008 Beijing Olympics. In the early 2010s, she was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease, and she was back in the game in 2014-2015, when she started winning serious international tournaments again. Since the times of the 2016 Olympics in Rio, the career of Venus started declining. Together with her sister Serena, Venus Williams is involved in a large number of various charity related projects. They are owners of NFL Team shares. In 2012, they took part in a cinema project named Venus and Serena. Venus is not married, but she dated a few celebrities like a model Elio Pis and a golfer Hank Kuehne."
