        "meta_description": "Williams was born in Lynwood, California, to Richard Williams and Oracene Price.\r\n\r\nHer talents were apparent at the age of seven when a professional local tennis player named Tony Chesta spotted Williams and quickly identified her potential in the sport.\r\n\r\nThe Williams family moved from Compton, California, to West Palm Beach, Florida, when she was ten, so that she and her sister Serena could attend the tennis academy of Rick Macci, who took notice of the sisters and who would provide additional coaching. He did not always agree with Williams's father but respected that \"he treated his daughters like kids, allowed them to be little girls\".",
