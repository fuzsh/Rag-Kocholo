        "text": "For any child growing up the first major rivalry during their formative years would usually be against their sibling. Usually, these rivalries that begin in backyards and bedrooms fade as you get older and strengthen bonds between brothers and sisters.\n\nTop level sport, however, is a less forgiving beast and has served up some remarkable sibling rivalries over the years.
