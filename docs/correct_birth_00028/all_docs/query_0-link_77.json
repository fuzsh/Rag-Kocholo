        "text": "TENNIS champion Venus Williams responded to how she deals with critics and the media.\n\nVenus gave insight into how she handles media perception and attention throughout her 26-year career in wake of tennis star Naomi Osaka withdrawing from the French Open.\n\nWho is Venus Williams?\n\nVenus Williams was born on June 17, 1980 in Lynwood, California.\n\nAlong with her sister, Serena, Venus has redefined professional tennis.\n\nVenus began playing professional tennis in 1994 and in 1997, she was the first unseeded U.S. Open women’s finalist in the open era.\n\nThroughout her career, Venus has won seven Grand Slam singles titles, 16 Grand Slam doubles titles, and four Olympic gold medals.\n\nWhat was Venus' response to how she deals with the media?\n\nReporters asked Venus on June 1, 2021 how she deals with constant media attention throughout her long and impressive career.\n\n\"For me personally, how I deal with it was that I know every single person asking me a question can't play as well as I can and never will, so no matter what you say or write, you'll never light a candle to me,\" she said.\n\n\"So that's how I deal with it, but each person deals with it differently.\"\n\nThis response came after Osaka's decision to withdraw from the 2021 French Open.\n\nWhy did Naomi Osaka withdraw from the French Open?\n\nOn Monday, May 31, Osaka announced she'll withdraw from the French Open - citing mental health reasons.\n\nThe move comes after Osaka announced that she would not participate in press interviews at the Grand Slam event to help protect her mental health.\n\nOsaka announced her resignation from the tournament on Twitter, tweeting, \"Hey everyone, this isn’t a situation I ever imagined or intended when I posted a few days ago.\n\n“I think now the best thing for the tournament, the other players and my well-being is that I withdraw so that everyone can get back to focusing on the tennis going on in Paris, Osaka wrote.\n\nOsaka said she had suffered bouts of depression since winning her first slam title at the US Open in 2018 and that talking to the media triggered anxiety.\n\n“I never wanted to be a distraction and I accept that my timing was not ideal and my message could have been clearer,” she continued in her tweet.\n\n“More importantly, I would never trivialize mental health or use the term lightly. The truth is that I have suffered long bouts of depression since the US Open in 2018 and I have had a really hard time coping with that.\n\n“Anyone that knows me knows I’m introverted, and anyone that has seen me at the tournaments will notice that I’m often wearing headphones as that helps dull my social anxiety.\n\n“Though the tennis press has always been kind to me (and I wanna apologise especially to all the cool journalists who I may have hurt), I am not a natural public speaker and get huge waves of anxiety before I speak to the world’s media.”"
