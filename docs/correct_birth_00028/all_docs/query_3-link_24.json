        "text": "Venus and Serena Williams are sisters who play tennis. They won many important tournaments from 1999 to the early 2000s. The two sometimes teamed up to win doubles (two against two) championships. Each sister won many singles championships as well. In 2002 they were the top two women tennis players in the world.\n\nVenus Williams was born on June 17, 1980, in Lynwood, California. Serena was born on September 26, 1981, in Saginaw, Michigan. The sisters’ father, Richard, taught them to play tennis when they were very young.\n\nThe Williams sisters both became professional tennis players at about age 14. Being professional means that they earned money for playing. In 1999 Serena was the first to win one of the four major tennis tournaments when she won the U.S. Open. The major tournaments are known as grand slam tournaments. She was the first African American woman to win a grand slam tournament since Althea Gibson did so in the late 1950s.\n\nIn 2000 Venus won another of the major tournaments, this one in Wimbledon, England. She and Serena won the women’s doubles competition at Wimbledon as well. Later that year Venus won the U.S. Open for the first time. Venus also won a gold medal at the Olympics in 2000. She and Serena won the gold medal for doubles. In 2001 Venus won both Wimbledon and the U.S. Open again.\n\nIn 2002 Serena beat her sister at the French Open, Wimbledon, and the U.S. Open. She became the number-one player in the world. In 2003 Serena beat Venus at Wimbledon and the Australian Open. The Australian Open victory gave her wins in all four of the major tournaments. Both sisters won many more individual titles after that.\n\nThe sisters continued to play as a doubles team as well. They won their second doubles gold medal at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China, and their third at the 2012 Olympic Games in London, England.\n\nSerena announced in 2022 that she would retire after the U.S. Open that year. She lost in the third round of the tournament. By the time her career had ended, she had won 23 grand slam tournaments."
