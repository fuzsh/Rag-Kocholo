        "text": "The courts where Serena and Venus Williams learned to play tennis are famous only to a select few.\n\nThe city of Compton is celebrated as the birthplace of the sisters’ rise to athletic stardom, but the wire nets and cracked concrete where their famed tennis careers were born aren’t the only thing missing from the area.\n\nAs Serena Williams made her run at the grand slam last week, her back story was told frequently, with reference to the courts where she learned the game.\n\nBut the community now surrounding what was East Compton Park is a far different demographic than the one that populated the area when the Williams sisters made daily visits to the two unassuming tennis courts in the late 1980s.\n\n• PHOTOS: See what the courts look like today\n\n“The community has changed a lot since then, but some of the people who know this is where they started are still around,” said Freddy Bryant, the park’s recreation services director from 1989 to 1994. “I used to watch the sisters play and they showed up almost every day like clockwork.”\n\nThe courts themselves, now a bright blue and green, bare little semblance to the coarse confines in what was gang-infested Compton. Today, the tennis courts reside in an entirely different city.\n\nThey still sit a few turns away from the small, stucco house on East Stockton Street where the Williams family lived until moving to Florida in 1991 — when Venus was 11 years old and Serena was 9 — but the East Compton neighborhood is now part of East Rancho Dominguez, an unincorporated section of Los Angeles County.\n\nThe courts have twice been renovated since 2004 in what was a series of face-lifts for East Compton Park.\n\nNow East Rancho Dominguez Park, the surrounding community that was largely black in the 1980s, is predominately Latino.\n\nNaming effort started 7 years ago\n\nWhile East Rancho Dominguez is trying to distance itself from Compton, the community is holding tightly to the Williams sisters’ legacy.\n\n• Video: Community hopes to name tennis courts in honor of Venus and Serena\n\nVenus and Serena Williams have made one public appearance at the park since moving to Florida. Early in their professional tennis careers, the sisters participated in a ground-breaking for the park’s gym that now backs up to the tennis courts.\n\nLong before Serena’s exhilarating run at the calendar grand slam, the East Rancho Dominguez community has wanted to name the tennis courts at Compton Boulevard and Atlantic Avenue after the sisters.\n\nSinetta Farley, president of the East Rancho Dominguez Neighborhood Association, began such efforts in 2008. Only recently did she receive voter approval from the neighborhood association to put the ball in the sisters’ court.\n\nFarley, 73, who has been in touch with a representative of Serena’s about the sisters attending a ceremony to name the courts in their honor, is eagerly awaiting official word.\n\n“They have obviously earned the privilege and I just hope they recognize that and come,” Farley said. “They deserve it and we deserve it as a community.”\n\nInspiration to local youth\n\nThe courts are not yet officially set to be named for the sisters, but their presence still looms large at East Rancho Dominguez Park 25 years after they left.\n\nBryant remembers the Williams sisters participating in the park’s free lunch program, among other nontennis activities offered by the county Parks and Recreation Department. Tennis is just one of many activities made available by the park’s current regime.\n\n“We tell the kids, ‘They came from the same place, the same community you did, so what’s the difference in them making it and you making it?” current East Rancho Dominguez Park recreation services supervisor Tracey Latson said. “How much cooler does that get? I’m on the court where Venus and Serena Williams played.”\n\nTheir father, Richard Williams, famously took his two tennis prodigies anywhere he could find a court on which to practice, but their home base was East Compton Park.\n\nGang wars intruded on park\n\nJames Pyles, a part-time employee of the park who taught Serena tennis for two years while their father focused on Venus, recalls the park as a central location in the Compton gang wars of the ’80s. When a gunfight broke out, those playing tennis would drop to the ground. When the shooting stopped, they would simply rise and continue.\n\n“That was how it was in all areas of the inner city back then,” said Pyles, 73. “Sometimes the shootings would happen once a week, but that was just another day at the office for us. There were drug deals going on in the park, but the drug dealers knew that the girls were going to make something of themselves, so they made sure nothing happened to us.”\n\nSerena makes reference to the regular gunfire in her 2009 autobiography.\n\n“At first, I just thought someone was setting off firecrackers or popping some balloons,” she wrote, “but once I learned what the sound meant, it would shake me up pretty good.”\n\nOn various tennis courts around Compton, Serena recalls broken glass, weeds growing through cracks and trash strewn across the playing surface below the wire nets. Pyles remembers finding used needles on the courts.\n\nBryant, however, recalls his staff maintaining the courts well at East Compton Park during his five-year stint at the facility.\n\nIn fact, many in the neighborhood during the turbulence of the ’80s say the descriptions of the area are overcooked.\n\n“From my experience, that’s an exaggeration for the simple fact you’re in Compton,” said Latson, who has worked for the Parks and Recreation Department for 30 years. “We shut the facility down at 9 and, when we shut it down, people are still out here on the courts. They play. So it’s a big misconception.”\n\nThere is no debating the homicide statistics. Compton peaked with 87 murders in 1991, three times the per-capita rate in Los Angeles. There were 65 homicides in Compton as recently as 2005, but the city had just 17 in 2014.\n\nCourts not in Compton\n\nOf course, the famed tennis courts aren’t even in Compton, as the East Rancho Dominguez residents are quick to point out.\n\n“I have to drive home to people that this is East Rancho Dominguez,” said Farley, who has lived in the neighborhood for parts of five decades. “We want our own identity. The park still has problems, but not like it did back in the ’80s. It’s the only outlet for recreation that we have and it’ll be even more of a hub when the new community center is finished.”\n\nConstruction of new gym was followed by renovation of the tennis courts in 2004 and more work on the tennis courts in early 2015, but East Rancho Dominguez Park’s current $4.7 million renovation includes a 4,200-square foot addition to the existing recreation center.\n\nThe project includes some remodeling of the existing building and new amenities like an activity room for seniors, a kitchen, a pantry, a computer room, a game room, offices and a courtyard with exercise equipment.\n\nConstruction is expected to be completed in October, a date Farley is targeting for a ceremony to name the tennis courts after the Williams sisters.\n\n“There’s two courts,” Farley said. “We can name one Serena and the other Venus.”"
