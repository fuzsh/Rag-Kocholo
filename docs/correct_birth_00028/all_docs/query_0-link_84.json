        "text": "Venus Ebony Starr Williams, a professional American tennis player, is a former world No. 1 in both singles and doubles. She is widely considered to be one of the best in the history of tennis in both singles and doubles. In addition, she and his younger sister Serena Williams have been credited with a new era of strength and athletics on women's professional tennis tour.\n\nThe Women's Tennis Association ranked Williams World No. 1 for 19 sports weeks (11 in singles and 8 in doubles). On 25 February 2002, she first ranked first in singles in the Open Era for the second time since Althea Gibson. On June 7, 2010, she and Serena won their fourth consecutive Grand Slam, reaching the world's No. 1 spot in doubles.\n\nVenus has won four Olympic gold medals, one single and three doubles in women with her sister, and a mixed doubles silver medal, tying her to Kathleen McKane Godfree for the most Olympic medals that a member of the history of tennis has won. Along with 22 double titles of the WTA and two doubles, Venus also holds the second position among Serena's successful actors, with a cumulative total of 73 WTA titles.\n\nHow old is Venus Williams?\n\nVenus Williams was born in 1980 in Lynwood, California, USA. She celebrates her birthday every year on June 17. Thus, as of January 2021, Venus Williams is 40 years old. In addition, she is the daughter of Oracene Price and Oracene Williams (father) (mother). Her parents, however, legally divorced in 2002.\n\nShe has got four siblings: Serena Williams, Yetunde Price, Isha Price, and Lyndrea Price. In addition, Richard Williams III and Dylan Starr Williams are names of his two brothers. She graduated from the Fort Lauderdale Art Institute in 2007 with a degree in Fashion Design.\n\nVenus graduated from Indiana University East with her Bachelor of Science in Business Administration. But in 2011 she ceased to play tennis after suffering from Sjogren Syndrome. The rivalry of the sisters brought them together instead of dividing them."
