        "text": "AKA Venus Ebone Starr Williams\n\nBorn: 17-Jun-1980\n\nBirthplace: Lynwood, CA\n\nGender: Female\n\nReligion: Jehovah's Witness\n\nRace or Ethnicity: Black\n\nSexual orientation: Straight\n\nOccupation: Tennis\n\nNationality: United States\n\nExecutive summary: Winner of 17 Grand Slam titles\n\nVenus Williams is a professional tennis player, famous for her dominating game, and easily recognized by her height (6'1\") splashy outfits, and cornrowed hair. She was named 2000 Sportswoman of the Year by Sports Illustrated. Her sister Serena Williams is also a top-ranked player.\n\nVenus started playing tennis at age 4, and was coached mostly by her father, who taught himself tennis from how-to-play books. The family was poor, and Venus's childhood was spent in the high-crime areas of Compton, California. Her father used to take all five of his daughters to the run-down public tennis courts, but Venus and Serena showed the most aptitude. Venus says she also learned much from watching matches on TV -- copying the footwork, and noticing that the best players found their opponents' weakness, and then kept hitting the ball into their weak zones over and over. Eventually both girls came to dominate the junior circuit, before Venus turned pro at 14.\n\nAs a professional, she has won several big tournaments. She has a multiyear, multimillion contract with Reebok, making her \"without question, the biggest woman endorser ever\". Venus also has a deal with Wilson Leather, to create and market her own line of athletic products. Venus runs an interior design company in her spare time, and said years ago that she didn't intend to play tennis competitively past age 26.\n\nFather: Richard Williams\n\nMother: Oracene Price (\"Brandy\")\n\nSister: Serena Williams (tennis player, b. 26-Sep-1981)\n\nSister: Yetunde Price (half-sister, d. 14-Sep-2003 murder)\n\nSister: Lyndrea Price (half-sister)\n\nSister: Isha Price (half-sister)\n\nBoyfriend: Hank Kuehne (PGA golfer)\n\nHigh School: (home schooled)\n\nUniversity: AA Fashion Design, Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale (2007)\n\nWinner, Australian Open (mixed doubles) 1998\n\nWinner, French Open (mixed doubles) 1998\n\nWinner, French Open (women's doubles) 1999\n\nWinner, US Open (women's doubles) 1999\n\nWinner, US Open (women's singles) 2000\n\nWinner, Wimbledon (women's singles) 2000\n\nWinner, Wimbledon (women's doubles) 2000\n\nWinner, Australian Open (women's doubles) 2001\n\nWinner, US Open (women's singles) 2001\n\nWinner, Wimbledon (women's singles) 2001\n\nWinner, Wimbledon (women's doubles) 2002\n\nWinner, Australian Open (women's doubles) 2003\n\nWinner, Wimbledon (women's singles) 2005\n\nWinner, Wimbledon (women's singles) 2007\n\nWinner, Wimbledon (women's singles) 2008\n\nWinner, Wimbledon (women's doubles) 2008\n\nWinner, Wimbledon (women's doubles) 2009\n\nOlympic Gold Medal 2000 (singles tennis)\n\nOlympic Gold Medal 2000 (doubles tennis)\n\nOlympic Gold Medal 2008 (doubles tennis)\n\nEndorsement of American Express\n\nEndorsement of Avon\n\nEndorsement of Reebok\n\nEndorsement of Kraft Foods Double Stuf Oreo (2010)\n\nOfficial Website:\n\nhttp://www.venuswilliams.com/\n\nNew!\n\nNNDB MAPPER Create a map starting with Venus Williams\n\nRequires Flash 7+ and Javascript.\n\nDo you know something we don't?\n\nSubmit a correction or make a comment about this profile"
