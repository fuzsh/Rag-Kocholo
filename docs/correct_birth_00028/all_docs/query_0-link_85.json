        "text": "A Perfect Tribute\n\nWhen it comes to honoring someone you can't just throw things together in five minutes and say you're done. You need to really think it through. So thats why my tribute made in honer of The tennis star Venus Williams consists of many components. For example I have a tennis racket surrounded by pillars and a bronze dome. I chose bronze because it will withstand weather. I also chose to do a tennis racket because it is what you use to make bold, strong, and powerful serves which gain you points. As for the pillars I will make out of cement so it is strong and durable. I will also have kiosk right next to my tribute so that visitors can go and see clips about her and of her playing and a slideshow. There will also be a button on the tribute that if you press will say a quote. The colors i have chosen for this are red and black. Red to show how bold she is and Black to show that she never gives up. The quote I have chosen to represent on my tribute is,\"Just believe in yourself. Even if you don't, pretend that you do, and at some point you will.\" I chose this quote because it shows how strongly Venus Williams believes in never giving up. If I were to give this plan to a contractor I would make sure he built my tribute 12 feet high and 6 feet wide.\n\nFun facts\n\nFavorite colors-Pink and blue\n\nFavorite Subject-Science\n\nFavorite Sports-Tennis and Football\n\nFavorite Food-Cherry Pie\n\nIntroduction\n\n\"Just believe in yourself. Even if you don't, pretend that you do and at some point you will.\" Said the tennis star Venus Williams.Venus Ebony Starr Williams was born on June 17th 1980. Venus was the fourth child in her family. Her sibling are Yetunde Isha, Lyndrea and Serena Williams. Venus' Richard Williams, her father and tennis coach, and Ocarina her mother. Venus was born in Lynwood, California, a gang infested area.\n\nEarly years\n\n\"Venus was born a star,\" as her father would say. Richard, Venus' dad was not the type of tennis coach you would expect to see. Richard actually didn't know much about tennis until he was flipping through the television channels one day when he came across something interesting. It was tennis. When he saw the winner of the match get thousand of dollars a he right then decided that he would make his two youngest daughters tennis champions. Richard had to get ready to coach his two youngest daughters so he read and watched many thing about tennis and was finally ready to coach his daughters. Yetunde was very good at tennis, Isha and Lender were awesome, and Serena might have been the best but Venus was a champion the first day. Richard explains about Venus,\" A champion has four qualities: their rough, their tough, they're strong, and they're mentally sound-she is all of that.\"\n\nChildhood\n\nVenus was born in a gang infested area of Lynwood, California. Her and her sister and her dad would go to the public courts and practice tennis while there was a gang of people sitting around. Richard had to be careful. One day Venus and Serena were shot at by a gang's members [the Bloods]. Later on the gangs in the area were so proud of Venus and Serena that they agreed to \"ceasefire\" while they were practicing. Venus also by the age of ten was able to make a serve that topped 100 miles per an hour. When Venus was 13 her family took her out of the public junior high she was currently attending in favor of home schooling her. A year after that Venus won her first real tennis match. Later on her parents cut down the time she had to practice because they believed school comes first.\n\nTurning Pro\n\nVenus Williams turned pro on October 31, 1994. She was more than ready for this. She showed this by beating No.50-seeded Shaun Stafford at the bank of west classic in California. It was a Wonderful occasion for the Williams.In 1997, Williams became the first unseeded US Open women's finalist in the Open era. At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia, Venus took home the gold medal in the singles competition, and then took a second one with Serena in the doubles event. The sisters have always credited one another both as teammates and as competitors. Together, the pair have won 13 Grand Slam doubles titles and have squared off more than 20 times, including the finals of eight Grand Slam tournaments. In 2006 Venus got a wrist injury but got back on the courts by 2007.She repeated the victory a year later, when she defeated Serena for a fifth career Wimbledon championship. A few months later, the Williams sisters teamed up to capture the doubles title at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games.\n\nTaking Time off Of the Courts\n\nIn 2011 Venus got diagnosed with Sjogrens Syndrome. Sjogrens Syndrome is an autoimmune disease that left her easily exhausted and sore. Because she got diagnosed with Sjogrens Syndrome she switched to a vegan diet and altered her training schedule to allow more recovery days. That method worked and the proof is that Serena and Venus claimed their 13th grand slam doubles title at Wimbledon in 2012. The two sister went on to defeat many others and won up to 4 olympic gold medals.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs you can see Venus Williams is truly a Famous American. She has gone through many thing in her childhood like dangers of being shot to being afraid of not being able to play again. Not only does Venus play tennis but she has other hobbies too. For example, Venus has an interest for fashion and also has her own fashion line called EleVan. As you can Venus is truly a great person."
