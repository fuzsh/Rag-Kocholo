With the return of several big names to the iconic hardcourts, this year's tournament may be the most anticipated in the California desert in years.\n\nThe 2023 tournament saw a total attendance of 441,983 fans. The event also set a single-day attendance record when just over 61,000 people attended on March 11, which included a rare sellout of Stadium 1 for a second-round match between Americans Taylor Fritz and Ben Shelton.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about this year’s event:\n\nWhere\n\nAll matches will be played at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden: 78-200 Miles Avenue, Indian Wells, Calif. 92210.\n\nWho\n\nThe field this year should be as stacked with more star power than any BNP Paribas Open since at least 2019. Top-ranked Novak Djokovic, who has not played at Indian Wells since then, is expected to return, joining Polish tennis star Iga Świątek, the top-ranked woman in the world, to headline the tournament.\n\nAlso expected to return this year will be Spanish tennis star Rafael Nadal, who missed last year’s event with an injury, and four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka, who did not play last year while pregnant with a daughter who was born in July. Tennis icon Venus Williams, who has not played at Indian Wells in five years, and Grand Slam champion Caroline Wozniacki have each accepted wild card invites to play.\n\nThen there’s the other stars of the game, such as returning champions Carlos Alcaraz, the second-ranked man in the world, and Elena Rybakina, the fourth-ranked woman. They’ll join American stars Coco Gauff, who won her first Grand Slam title last year, Jessica Pegula, Taylor Fritz, Tommy Paul, Frances Tiafoe and Ben Shelton, among others.\n\nTickets\n\nTo purchase tickets online, visit https://bnpparibasopen.com/tickets/\n\nTo purchase tickets over the phone, call 1-800-999-1585 from Monday to Friday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\nQualifying days (Sunday, March 3, Monday, March 4 and Tuesday, March 5) are $10 admission with all proceeds going to benefit The Champions Volunteer Foundation.
