        "text": "Venus Williams: 2024 net worth, stats, salary, and more\n\nWho is Venus Williams?\n\nVenus Williams, considered one of the greatest tennis players in history, has secured three Olympic women's doubles titles. As the elder sister of Serena Williams., she made history by becoming the first to achieve the singles and doubles 'double' at Sydney 2000, a feat her sibling replicated 12 years later.\n\nVenus Williams’s early life\n\nVenus Williams was born in Lynwood, California, on June 17, 1980. She picked up a tennis racket under the tutelage of their father, Richard Williams in Compton, California. He began coaching Venus when she was four years old. Even before her and her sister's birth, Richard had meticulously crafted an 85-page plan to transform his daughters into tennis stars. His inspiration stemmed from watching Virginia Ruzici play on TV and earn a significant sum, which led him to choose tennis as their path to success.\n\nVenus Williams's talents shone through at the age of seven when Tony Chesta, a local professional tennis player, spotted her and promptly recognized her potential in the sport. Venus, along with her family, moved to Florida to train under coach Rick Macci, who was the first professional coach for both Williams sisters.\n\nVenus was withdrawn from the junior circuit along with her sister by their father, Richard Williams. Richard reasoned that the girls were young and should also focus on having fun and going to school, instead of just tennis. He was also focused on safeguarding his daughters from racial abuse, having heard several parents on the circuit disparaging his daughters.\n\nHer father's words stuck with Venus as she went on to attain two degrees. Venus received her associate degree in fashion design from the Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale in 2007. She earned a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from Indiana University East in 2015.\n\nVenus Williams’s boyfriend\n\nThe tennis champion is currently single. However, there were rumors that she was dating Nicholas Hammond, a successful financier and an heir to the Annenberg family fortune. But, Venus never publicly confirmed the relationship. The two had been spotted together on several occasions. There were reports that the two ended their relationship in 2019.\n\nVenus Williams's net worth 2024\n\nVenus, a seven-time Grand Slam singles champion, has a net worth of over $12 million. Back in 2019, she was the 10th highest-paid female athlete in the world, earning $5.9 million, of which $5 million came in endorsements. As per her official WTA page at the time, Williams earned a massive sum of $42,513,897.\n\nVenus Williams’s career\n\nVenus embarked on her professional career at the tender age of 14. By the time she was 17, in 1997, she made history as the first unseeded player in the Open Era to advance to a Grand Slam final, reaching the US Open final, although she was ultimately defeated by Switzerland’s Martina Hingis.\n\nThe year 2000 marked a monumental achievement for Venus as she secured her first Grand Slam titles, triumphing at Wimbledon and then the US Open, where she bested fellow American Lindsay Davenport on both occasions.\n\nShortly after her triumph in New York, Venus traveled to Sydney, where she clinched Olympic gold in the women’s singles final by defeating Russia’s Elena Dementieva with a score of 6-2, 6-4.\n\nThe subsequent day, she partnered with Serena for the women’s doubles final, and the sisters dominated the Dutch pair Kristie Boogert and Miriam Oremans, securing victory in just 49 minutes with a score of 6-1, 6-1. With this, Venus became the first woman since Helen Wills Moody in 1924 to claim gold in both singles and doubles events at the same Games.\n\nIn February 2002, Venus ascended to the world No. 1 ranking, setting the stage for a remarkable series of four consecutive Grand Slam finals against her sister Serena, beginning from the 2002 French Open to the 2003 Australian Open.\n\nDespite encountering a series of injuries that disrupted her career, Venus established her dominance at Wimbledon, clinching the title a total of five times. Her final victory at the prestigious tournament came in 2008, where she defeated Serena in the final. Following their singles showdown, the sisters teamed up on Centre Court to secure a record 14th Grand Slam doubles title together.\n\nIn 2008, the Williams sisters also clinched their second Olympic gold medal in tennis doubles, this time in Beijing. The following year, they faced off again in the Wimbledon finals, with Serena emerging victorious.\n\nIn the subsequent years, Venus's performance saw a decline, although in 2016 she secured her 49th tournament win. She did not make a Grand Slam singles final appearance again until the 2017 Australian Open, where she faced defeat against Serena. Later that year, Venus reached the Wimbledon finals but was ultimately defeated.\n\nVenus Williams’s partnerships and endorsements\n\nWhen Venus was 15 years old in 1995, she secured her first endorsement deal with Reebok. In 2000, she signed yet another five-year agreement with the company for a reported $40 million. Throughout her illustrious career, she has collaborated with various brands including American Express, Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, Stitch Fix, Wilson, Tide, Kraft, Ralph Lauren, and Lacoste, among many others.\n\nVenus Williams’s investments\n\nIn 2006, Venus founded the clothing company EleVen, just four years after launching the interior design firm V Starr, which designed homes including those of her sister and her husband in South Florida. Continuing her journey as a successful businesswoman, Venus expanded her ventures by founding the plant-based superfood nutrition company called Happy Viking in 2020. She is also an investor in Ellevest, an online investment resource, and holds a stake in the NFL team the Miami Dolphins.\n\nIn 2023, she invested in LA Golf Club, becoming the first part-owners announced for the revolutionary golf league founded by Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy\n\nVenus Williams’s major achievement and awards\n\nAwards:\n\n1995\n\nSports Image Foundation Award for conducting tennis clinics in low-income areas\n\n1997\n\nWTA Newcomer of the Year\n\nSeptember's Olympic Committee Female Athlete\n\n1998\n\nTennis Magazine's Most Improved Player\n\n2000\n\nWTA Player of the Year\n\nWTA Doubles Team of the Year (with Serena Williams)\n\nSports Illustrated for Women's Sportswoman of the Year\n\nTeen Choice Awards – Extraordinary Achievement Award\n\nForbes The Celebrity 100 (No.62)\n\nWomen's Sports Foundation Sportswoman of the Year for team sports (with Serena Williams)\n\n2001\n\nBest Female Tennis Player ESPY Award\n\nEMMA Best Sport Personality Award\n\nForbes The Celebrity 100 (No.57)\n\n2002\n\nBest Female Athlete ESPY Award\n\nBest Female Tennis Player ESPY Award\n\nForbes The Celebrity 100 (No.60)\n\n2003\n\nThe President's Award of the 34th NAACP Image Awards\n\nForbes The Celebrity 100 (No.65)\n\n2004\n\nHarris Poll Top 10 Favorite Female Sports Star (No.1)\n\nForbes The Celebrity 100 (No.77)\n\n2005\n\nGlamour Magazine's Women of the Year Award\n\nForbes The Celebrity 100 (No.81)\n\nHarris Poll Top 10 Favorite Female Sports Star (No.3)\n\n2006\n\nBest Female Tennis Player ESPY Award\n\nBET's Best Female Athlete of the Year\n\nHarris Poll Top 10 Favorite Female Sports Star (No.1)\n\nForbes The Celebrity 100 (No.90)\n\n2007\n\nGitanjali Diamond Award\n\nHarris Poll Top 10 Favorite Female Sports Star (No.3)\n\nVogue Magazine Top 10 Best Dressed List for 2007\n\n2008\n\nWhirlpool 6th Sense Player of the Year Award\n\nHarris Poll Top 10 Favorite Female Sports Star (No.3)\n\nAnti-Defamation League Americanism Award\n\nWhirlpool 6th Sense Player of the Year Award\n\nITF Women's Doubles World Champion (with Serena Williams)\n\nWTA Doubles Team of the Year (with Serena Williams)\n\nWTA Fan Favorite Doubles Team of the Year (with Serena Williams)\n\nDoha 21st Century Leaders Awards – Outstanding Leadership\n\nForbes The Celebrity 100 (No.77)\n\nHarris Poll Top 10 Favorite Female Sports Star (No.2)\n\n2010\n\nCaesars Tennis Classic Achievement Award\n\nForbes The Celebrity 100 (No.83)\n\nYWCA GLA Phenomenal Woman of the Year Award\n\nWTA Fan Favorite Doubles Team of the Year (with Serena Williams)\n\nForbes 30 Utterly Inspiring Role Models\n\nForbes 100 Most Powerful Women in the World (No.60)\n\nHarris Poll Top 10 Favorite Female Sports Star (No.2)\n\n2011\n\nForbes The Celebrity 100 (No.86)\n\nTIME Magazine 30 Legends of Women's Tennis\n\nForbes Most Powerful Black Women In The U.S. (No.10)\n\nHarris Poll Top 10 Favorite Female Sports Star (No.2)\n\n2012\n\nWorld TeamTennis Finals Most Valuable Player\n\nWTA Player Service Award\n\nWTA Fan Favorite Doubles Team of the Year (with Serena Williams)\n\n2013\n\nBET Black Girls Rock!
