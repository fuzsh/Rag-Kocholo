        "text": "Bill Oakes fondly remembers the press conference during which USTA Southern announced it was bringing Indianapolis’ longtime ATP 250 event to Atlanta. Then-U.S. Open Tournament Director Jim Curley handed Oakes, who was to be the first director of the Atlanta Tennis Championships, a shred of paper with a simple edict.\n\n“D.F.I.U.,” Oakes says now. “Don’t f*** it up.”\n\nOakes and the team’s work assembling a sponsor roster, organizing event logistics and recruiting a player pool that included Andy Roddick, John Isner and Mardy Fish, laid the foundation for a 15-year run. The first two tournaments took place in the suburbs, and the final 12 (one was skipped in 2020 due to COVID-19) midtown at Atlantic Station, a 138-acre mixed-use development flush with restaurants and retail shops. (For his efforts, Oakes, who left after the first edition to launch the Winston-Salem Open, received a custom shirt that read “I.D.N.F.I.U.” from USTA executives.)\n\nBut the Atlanta Open — which from 2012-19 went by the BB&T Atlanta Open, in 2021 the Truist Atlanta Open, and is now without a title sponsor — will stage its final edition this month. The ATP Tour is retiring the event after 2024 as part of schedule changes that will see the Dallas Open, a fellow GF Sports & Entertainment property, upgraded to 500 status next year.\n\n“We’re not leaving because it hasn’t been a successful event,” said Peter Lebedevs, the tournament’s director since 2023 and executive vice president of tennis operations for GFS&E, which bought the event from USTA Southern in 2015. “We’re looking at [the final year] as a celebration.”\n\nFirst, there will be opportunity to reflect on the talent the Atlanta Open attracted, particularly of the U.S.-born variety. Ten of the tournament’s 13 singles winners are American, and fast-ascending Atlanta native Ben Shelton made his ATP Tour debut there in 2022.\n\nSix-time winner Isner and 2012 champion Roddick will return for a miked-up doubles showcase against the Bryan brothers as part of Monday night programming that also will honor past tournament directors Oakes, Bob Bryant and Eddie Gonzalez. The annual Sunday Showdown women’s exhibition, sponsored by UPS, will return the night prior, featuring Sloane Stephens.\n\n“We’re a little bit ahead of previous years,” Lebedevs said of ticket sales, which he added is partially attributable to those exhibitions. “If we can get to 30,000 through the doors, we’d be excited.”\n\nThe Atlanta Open’s metropolitan backdrop is unique. Each year, tournament organizers erect two competition courts — the main one holds 3,500 between general and premium seating — on an empty 6-acre lot attached to Atlantic Station, which the property uses for other events such as Cirque du Soleil.\n\nStarr Cumming, retail director at Hines, which leases and manages Atlantic Station, pitched moving the event from the suburbs while she was with prior manager North American Properties more than a decade ago. She envisioned a streamlined experience for players and a spectator base that skewed younger and more diverse. The economic impact of the move also has been tangible.\n\n“We see double-digit [percentage] increases the week of tennis for sales in our food and beverage restaurants,” Cumming said. “Our soft goods and retailers do see some single-digit increases month over month when the tennis tournament is here.”\n\nIn addition to its annual practices of offering select discounts to Atlanta Open ticket holders and running social media ticket giveaways, Atlantic Station will this year donate its central park space, Atlantic Green, for a community event for alumni and students at historically Black colleges and universities.\n\nThe Atlanta Open’s food provider for its suite seats, Proof of the Pudding, will sponsor line-call reviews with the tagline “Show me the proof.”\n\n“We just want to, on behalf of GF Sports, thank all the people in Atlanta that have supported the event over the years,” Lebedevs said. “Hopefully, we make this one the most memorable they’ve ever been a part of.”"
