        "text": "Venus Williams have a certain amount of philosophy in Venus Williams's character but it lies dormant a good deal of the time. Venus Williams are large-hearted and sincere, though a trifle blunt. Venus Williams are somewhat proud and people who ponder to Venus Williams's vanity become Venus Williams's best friends.Venus Williams have high ideals which cannot be realised. When they fail, Venus Williams allow Venus Williams'sself to be considerably dejected. There is a streak of restlessness in Venus Williams, which causes Venus Williams to cast aside an ideal before it has had sufficient time to mature. Consequently, Venus Williams do not attain the success in life, nor the happiness and comfort, that Venus Williams's qualities merit.Venus Williams know how to express Venus Williams's opinions in public and Venus Williams have a neat gift for being humorous. It follows that Venus Williams are credited by Venus Williams's friends as being jolly good company. Certainly Venus Williams are entertaining. Venus Williams's friends by the way, have considerable influence on Venus Williams and it is highly necessary that Venus Williams should chose them wisely and deliberately.Venus Williams's greatest failing is that Venus Williams are versatile and that Venus Williams's energies are directed into too many channels. Concentrate on fewer branches of work and pleasure, and Venus Williams will greatly benefit by the change.\n\nVenus Williams have the ability to seeing through anything or anyone, so it is very difficult to hide anything from Venus Williams. This clarity of insight assists in the overcoming of opposition and the achievement of satisfaction. Venus Williams have a quick grasp of any situation and the ability to solve any problem, for Venus Williams go directly to the point.Venus Williams stick to Venus Williams's aim and do not feel pressured easily. Venus Williams will be renowned as a great intellectual in the society because of the knowledge and education Venus Williams have pursued. Even if Venus Williams renounce the other aspects of life, Venus Williams should not abandon Venus Williams's knowledge. This priority will keep Venus Williams ahead of others in life. Venus Williams will receive the guidance of many learned people which will benefit Venus Williams's studies. The knowledge Venus Williams have acquired is an innate talent, which is why Venus Williams should try to imbibe some of it in Venus Williams's personal life in the process of becoming a better human being. The urge to acquire knowledge will keep Venus Williams at the top and Venus Williams will be listed among great intellectuals. Sometimes, Venus Williams's education can remain at stake because of Venus Williams's independent attitude, which is why Venus Williams should try to reform this aspect of Venus Williams's personality."
