        "text": "Early Life\n\nSerena Williams was born on September 26, 1981 in Saginaw, Michigan. She began playing tennis in California at age five and was home-schooled and coached by her parents. Her family moved from Compton to West Palm Beach when she was nine so she could attend Rick Macci’s tennis academy. He provided additional coaching. Serena Williams began playing professionally in September 1995 at age 15.\n\nVenus Williams was born June 17, 1980 in Lynwood, California. She started playing tennis at age four and moved with her family to West Palm Beach at age 10 to also attend Macci’s academy. She turned professional on October 31, 1994 at age 14.\n\nPlaying Style\n\nSerena Williams is a baseline player. She takes immediate control of rallies using a powerful serve and return and forceful groundstrokes. Her serve can be up to 128mph.\n\nVenus Williams is also a baseline player with an attacking all-court game. She is most comfortable playing on grass. She is a skillful volleyer with great court coverage. She has the record for the fastest serve by a woman, with 130mph at the Zurich Open.\n\nGrand Slams\n\nSerena Williams won 21 Grand Slam singles titles.
