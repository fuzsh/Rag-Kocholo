        "text": "Collin Morikawa has arrived as golf's next superstar. Already a two-time major champion and Olympian at just 27, Collin has matched historical performances with one of the most genuine and relatable personalities in professional sports.\n\nAfter putting the golf world on notice in 2020, Collin cemented his place in the history books in 2021. With his win at the 2021 WGC-Workday Championship at The Concession, Collin joined Tiger Woods as the only players to have won a major and a WGC title before the age of 25.\n\nAfter top-10 performances at both the 2021 PGA Championship and U.S. Open, Collin joined the exclusive club entitled Champion Golfer of the Year with his commanding performance at the 2021 Open Championship. This again linked Collin with Tiger as they are now the only two players to have won both the PGA Championship and Open Championship before the age of 25.\n\nCollin's win at the Open Championship carries further significance. He is the only player in history to win a major in his first attempt twice (his starts at the 2020 PGA Championship and 2021 Open Championship were his first ever in each respective tournament).\n\nMoreover, he reached multiple major victories in the fewest starts in the modern era, winning two major titles in just eight major championship starts. With two wins and four top-10s in his first eight starts, Collin's performance on golf's biggest stages is unparalleled.\n\nCollin became the first American to win the European Tour's Race to Dubai in commanding fashion as he came from 3 strokes back to win by 3 at the 2021 DP World Tour Championship and further established his international credentials by picking up his 6th PGA TOUR win at the ZOZO Championship in Japan.\n\nAt the 2020 PGA Championship, Collin hit one of the most iconic shots in major championship history en route to victory with his sensational drive at the par-4 16th hole, which set up an eagle that cemented his place as a major winner.\n\nHis two-shot win at Harding Park also carried historic significance, as he joined Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy as the only 23-year-olds to win the Wanamaker Trophy.\n\nTommy Fleetwood is one of Europe's leading golfers, having achieved success internationally as a four-time European Tour winner and a Ryder Cup player.\n\nBorn on January 19, 1991, in Southport, a coastal town in the north west of England renowned as a popular golfing area, Tommy first took up the game at his local municipal course before showing promise as a junior at Formby Hall under the tutelage of Norman Marshall.\n\nHe went on to enjoy a decorated amateur career, finishing runner-up in the 2008 Amateur Championship and representing Great Britain & Ireland in the 2009 Walker Cup before turning professional the following year.\n\nIn 2011, he became the youngest player to win the European Challenge Tour Rankings at the age of 20 years and 290 days after earlier winning the Kazakhstan Open.\n\nHe claimed his first European Tour title in 2013 at the Johnnie Walker Championship at Gleneagles, and finished inside the top 50 on the Race to Dubai for four consecutive seasons before landing his second title in the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship in 2017, finishing a shot clear of Dustin Johnson and Pablo Larrazábal.\n\nThat victory was the catalyst for a superb 2017 season as he finished runner up in the WGC-Mexico Championship, fourth at the U.S. Open and won a maiden Rolex Series title in the Open de France, breaking into the top ten on the Official World Golf Ranking.\n\nTommy went on to finish the year as Europe's Number One player, winning the European Tour's Race to Dubai crown ahead of fellow Englishman Justin Rose, receiving the prestigious Seve Ballesteros Award as Player's Player of the Year.\n\nHe successfully defended his Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship title in 2018 and he came agonisingly close to a first major championship when he finished runner up in the U.S. Open at Shinnecock Hills, posting a final round 63 - the equal lowest in a U.S. Open and the lowest final round in any major championship - to finish one shot behind Brooks Koepka.\n\nTommy made a record-breaking Ryder Cup debut at Le Golf National in France that September, winning four points out of four alongside his friend Francesco Molinari en route to a memorable 17½-10½ victory for Team Europe.\n\nA husband and a father, Tommy launched the Tommy Fleetwood Golf Academy in May 2019 to give kids the opportunity to take up golf and to widen the sport's appeal. His first Academy opened at Formby Hall.\n\nIn November 2019 Tommy beat Marcus Kinhult in a playoff to win the Nedbank Golf Challenge at Sun City in South Africa. Featuring three eagles in one round and starting the final round six shots off the lead, he carded a seven-under 65 to finish on 12-under-par.\n\nTommy made his second appearance in Team Europe for the 2021 Ryder Cup in Wisconsin and in November 2022 he defended his title at the Nedbank Challenge again winning ahead of Ryan Fox.\n\nTFA Dubai opened in November 2022 and is partnered by DP World as part of their performance centre at Jumeirah Golf Estates. It's success in the region has been huge and members have loved having Tommy as their local resident in Dubai.\n\nIn January 2023 Tommy was chosen by Luke Donald and Ryder Cup Team Europe to Captain the GB&I Team for the Hero Cup in Abu Dhabi, they lost unfortunately to Francesco Molinari's Team Europe but Tommy loved the experience and the team bonding that grew from the week.\n\nJust eight months later, Tommy was part of the victorious Team Europe in the 2023 Ryder Cup and has started the 2024 season in style with victory at the Dubai Invitational.\n\nFrom humble beginnings, Justin Rose has ascended to the peaks of professional golf. As a 17-year-old amateur, Justin burst onto the global golf scene with a T4 finish at the Open Championship. However, after 21 consecutive missed cuts to start his professional career, many doubted his resilience. Over the past 20 years, Justin has written one of the most complete resumes the world of golf has ever seen.\n\nA winner of over 20 tournaments worldwide, Justin's accolades include winning the 2013 U.S. Open; winning the gold medal at the 2016 Olympic Games; being a six-time Ryder Cup member; becoming the 2018 FedExCup Champion; winning the 2007 European Tour Order of Merit, and most recently being named 2021 Recipient of the Payne Stewart Award.\n\nJustin's consistent play saw him rise to #1 in the Official World Golf Ranking in 2018, joining an elite fraternity of only 24 players to have climbed to the top of golf's ranking system. Justin's warm and authentic personality makes him one of the game's greatest ambassadors and a true favourite of his peers and fans alike.\n\nBorn in South Africa, raised in England, and having lived much of his professional life in America and the Bahamas, Justin is a true global statesman. Justin and his wife, Kate, have two children, Leo and Charlotte, and are committed philanthropists. The Kate and Justin Rose Foundation, which was founded in 2009, promotes education, nutrition, and experiences for underprivileged youth. To date, they have provided more than 500,000 hunger free weekends, and more than 300,000 books to over 29,000 children in need in America.\n\nKate and Justin have also been immense advocates for Junior and Women's Professional Golf. In 2020 when Covid-19 closed sporting opportunities for women, they created the Rose Ladies Series with their own money, which has enabled LET Pros and leading amateurs to continue their golfing careers during the pandemic and has continued into this year. With the vision of encouraging and growing golf at grassroots levels, they have also been running and personally sponsoring the largest Junior Series across the UK.\n\nSahith Theegala is playing with the world's greatest golfers on the PGA TOUR, and every week the golf world is getting better acquainted with the friendly personality and nonstop work ethic that is winning him new fans every time he plays.\n\nIn September 2023, Sahith earned his first individual PGA TOUR win at the Fortinet Championship, a two-shot victory over the field. In the fall of 2022, he earned his first win at the QBE Shootout with Tom Hoge. In the 2021/2022 PGA TOUR season, Sahith's best finish was T2 at the Travelers Championship. He also finished T3 at the WM Phoenix Open, where he held the lead for the first three days, T5 at the Memorial, T7 at the Valspar Championship and T8 at the Sanderson Farms Championship. He finished in the top 30 on the FedExCup points list for the season, giving him entry to the majors and other elite events in 2023.\n\nDuring the 2020/2021 season, Sahith played on both the PGA and Korn Ferry Tours, making the cut in 18 of a total of 24 events played. He finished high enough on the Korn Ferry Tour points list to earn PGA TOUR membership for the 2021/2022 season\n\nSahith was the leading college golfer in the United States in 2020, and only the fifth player to receive all three of the top golfer awards in one season: the Fred Haskins Award, the Ben Hogan Award and the Jack Nicklaus Award. This recognition made him a player to watch as he began his professional career in 2020 after graduation from Pepperdine University.\n\nA four-year member of the Pepperdine golf team, Sahith gathered four individual tournament titles, including the Alister MacKenzie and Southwestern Invitational events in 2020. He was selected three times as an All-American, and he also had many impressive accomplishments in the highest levels of amateur competition. In 2020 he was the wire-to-wire winner of the Australian Master of the Amateurs tournament at Victoria Golf Club. He also was the champion of the 2019 Southern California Golf Association Amateur Championship, and had top ten finishes at the Western Amateur and Sahalee Players Championship. In 2017 Sahith played in the U. S. Open and PGA TOUR's Genesis Open as an amateur and was selected as a member of the 2018 Arnold Palmer Cup U.S. team.\n\nSahith is from Chino Hills, California, and now lives in Houston. He began his golf career early, exhibiting great skill and early abilities on the course. He was the champion of the prestigious international Junior World Golf Championship at ages 6, 8 and 10, and had numerous victories on the AJGA Junior circuits. By the end of high school he had played in three U.S. Junior Amateur Championships, and also won the 2010 Junior Masters."
