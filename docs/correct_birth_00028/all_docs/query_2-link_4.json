        "text": "(born 1980). An aggressive will to win and a strong all-around game characterized American tennis player Venus Williams. At the age of 17 the unseeded, relatively unknown player became the first African American to reach the women’s singles finals of the U.S. Open since Althea Gibson claimed the title in 1958. When Williams won the singles title at Wimbledon in 2000, she was likewise the first African American woman to do so since Gibson won in 1958. Williams became the top-ranked woman tennis player in the world in 2002.\n\nVenus Ebony Starr Williams was born on June 17, 1980, in Lynwood, California. Introduced to tennis when she was just a toddler, Williams pursued her interest in the game on public courts in her hometown of Compton, California, a Los Angeles suburb plagued by gangs and violent crime. She and her sister Serena were coached almost exclusively by their parents, neither of whom had any formal tennis training. In 1991 the family moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where Rick Macci, the professional coach who developed Jennifer Capriati’s game, coached the sisters.\n\nSteered by her father, Williams left junior competition at age 11 to concentrate on school. Whereas most young players are well seasoned in junior competition by the time they enter professional tournaments, Williams entered the professional tour in 1994 at age 14 with relatively little experience in match play. Her parents invested in her a strong sense of self-confidence, which grew into an undaunted will to win. An exceptionally tall player, Williams had to bend her knees deeply to return an opponent’s slices. Her powerful serve was clocked at more than 100 miles (160 kilometers) per hour.\n\nWilliams entered the 1997 U.S. Open ranked number 66 by the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA). She was the first unseeded woman ever to reach a U.S. Open singles finals since the open era began in 1968 and the first woman to reach a U.S. Open final in her debut since Pam Shriver advanced to the final in 1978 at age 16. Williams lost in the finals to 16-year-old, first-seeded Martina Hingis, but Williams’ WTA ranking improved to number 27.\n\nIn March 1998 Williams claimed her first professional singles title at the IGA Tennis Classic. Later that month she defeated top-ranked Hingis in the semifinals and then Anna Kournikova in the finals to capture the 1.9-million-dollar Lipton Championship, becoming the first U.S.-born woman to win the tournament since Chris Evert did so in 1986. After Williams’ victory, she ranked number 10.\n\nAfter Serena entered the professional tour, the sisters’ singles careers often pitted them against one another. Although Serena was the first of the pair to win a Grand Slam singles title, at the 1999 U.S. Open, Venus followed with a victory at Wimbledon in 2000. She defeated Serena in the semifinals and Lindsay Davenport in the finals, both in straight sets. At that year’s U.S. Open, Venus triumphed over first-ranked Hingis and then second-ranked Davenport to take the title. She won her second Wimbledon and U.S. Open championships in 2001. She ended both the 2000 and 2001 seasons ranked third in the world. In February 2002 she became the tenth woman ever to hold the number one spot. Later that year Serena defeated her in the finals round of the French Open, Wimbledon, and the U.S. Open, and Serena overtook her in the world rankings. Venus won Wimbledon again in 2005, 2007, and 2008. In 2017 she reached the finals of the Australian Open, where she lost in straight sets to Serena. At age 36, Venus was the oldest Australian Open singles finalist of the open era.\n\nThe Williams sisters also played doubles tournaments together, capturing titles at all four Grand Slam events: the U.S. Open (1999 and 2009), the French Open (1999 and 2010), Wimbledon (2000, 2002, 2008, 2009, and 2012), and the Australian Open (2001, 2003, 2009, and 2010). At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia, the sisters won a gold medal in the doubles competition, and Venus took the gold in singles. The sisters also won the doubles gold medal at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China, and at the 2012 Olympics in London, England."
