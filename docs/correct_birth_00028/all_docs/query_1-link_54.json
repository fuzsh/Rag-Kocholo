        "text": "While Serena and Venus Williams may take gold for being the most iconic sports sibling duo of all time, the tennis stars actually come from a very large, blended family. Serena has 11 siblings, including Venus, from both her mother and father’s sides of the family.\n\nThe Williams sisters were raised in California with their dad, Richard Williams, their mother, Oracene Price, and three half sisters (who also have the last name Price). The five girls shared a single bedroom with four beds growing up, and Serena switched off sharing the bed with a different sister every night, per the . Serena has spoken frequently about how close she is with the four sisters she grew up with.\n\nThese days, the 42-year-old tennis star has been busy building her own family with her husband, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian. The couple has two little girls, Olympia who is 6 years old, and Adira, who was born in August 2023.\n\nOf course, Serena's family has played a big role in her early success, and she has shared several memories about growing up with them.\n\nReady to meet the entire legendary family? Here everything to know about Serena’s 11 siblings:\n\nVenus\n\nVenus Williams defeated Petra Kvitova during the 2017 US Open.\n\nVenus and Serena were pretty much inseparable growing up. In fact, Serena \"worshipped\" her older sister, and it took a long time for her to separate her identity from Venus', per .\n\nRichard and Oracene were married in 1980 and welcomed Venus into their family in June of that same year. Serena was born shortly after, in 1981. They were the only two biological children born from Richard and Oracene's marriage.\n\nVenus, now 43, is a tennis legend in her own right. She became a tennis pro in 1994 and in 2000, won her first Wimbledon and US Open Titles, as well as Olympic Gold at the Sydney Olympics that year. And at that point, she proved to everyone that she was only just getting started.\n\nSince then, Venus has wracked up tons of other wins, and is considered one the greatest tennis players of all time, right alongside her sister. She has won 818 singles matches and over $42.5 million in career earnings throughout her career, per WTA Tennis.\n\nOff the court, Venus has stayed busy. She is the chief executive officer of her own interior design firm, V Starr Interiors, wrote a book, launched a fashion line called EleVen, and has two degrees from higher education institutions.\n\nYetunde\n\nYetunde Price and Serena Williams pose together at the ESPY awards.\n\nBefore marrying Richard, Oracene already had three daughters from a previous marriage. Despite a nine year age gap, Yetunde, the eldest half-sister who was born in 1972, was particularly close with Serena.\n\nYetunde was always in the stands, cheering her sisters on, and at one point, even worked as an assistant as Venus and Serena's tennis careers started picking up, per the Los Angeles Times.\n\nYetunde went on to have three children of her own and worked as a nurse. She also co-owned a hair salon with her best friend from high school, per the LA Times.\n\nSadly, in 2003, Yetunde was shot and killed in the passenger seat of her car during a drive-by shooting in Compton, Calif. She was 31. Her boyfriend, Rolland Wormley, gave an interview to the LA newspaper at the time. “These guys just started opening fire,” he said at the time. “We were just innocent passersby. Believe me, if anything, I would go through that myself twice before I let that happen to my girl.”\n\nIn 2016, Serena and Venus opened the Yetunde Price Resource Center in honor of their sister, per PEOPLE. The nonprofit, located in Compton, works to \"ensure that victims of direct or indirect senseless violence have complete access to existing resources and that where there is a dearth in services, new resources are created,\" its LinkedIn bio reads.\n\nLyndrea\n\nLyndrea Price, 45, was also an essential part of Serena and Venus’s rise to fame, helping the sister train with their father Richard. She would gather and run tennis balls for the sisters.\n\nThese days, Lyndrea does a lot of traveling and has worked as a costumer in Hollywood on projects like King Richard, Babylon, \"Abbott Elementary\" and \"Euphoria,\" per her IMDB.\n\nIsha\n\nVenus and Isha Price attend an awards show together.\n\nIsha has also been a huge cheerleader for her half-sisters Serena and Venus throughout their career. Throughout their childhood, she was right there alongside Serena and Venus as they trained. “It wasn't until I got to college that I realized that our lives weren't what other people considered normal,\" Isha shared with in 2007.\n\nIsha is now a lawyer, a producer, and a graduate of Georgetown University’s Law Center and Howard University, , per PEOPLE. Isha actually helped produce the film King Richard and is a contract and brand manager for Serena and Venus.\n\nShe's also quite the baker, and frequently posts her delicious delicacies on Instagram:\n\nIsha celebrates her sisters on Instagram, too. \"Listennnn.... yall don't know nothing about what I got... We da best! I got the best!! I LOVE MY SISTERS!!! Happy Ssisters Day!❤️❤️❤️,\" she captioned a series of photos showing herself with her Price and Williams sisters.\n\nSerena also has seven other half-siblings.\n\nBefore marrying Oracene in the 1980s, Richard Williams was married to another woman named Betty Johnson in 1965. They had five children together: Sabrina, Richard III, Ronner, Reluss, and Reneeka Williams, per The Sun.\n\nIn 2012, Richard welcomed another child, Dylan Starr Richard, with his third wife Lakeisha per Tennis.com. At the time, Serena said she loved having a little sister for the first time, but shared it made her feel like a grandma, Tennis.com reported."
