With a subtle and melodic approach to the drums, Hamilton was a quiet innovator on the jazz scene - incorporating cellist Fred Katz in his first quintet, which also included such legends as guitarist Jim Hall and reed-man Buddy Collette. Their first LP from 1955 is a cool, swinging affair that introduced the world to his particular brand of chamber bop. An absolutely beautiful album that has never gotten its proper due in the pantheon of jazz, So Far Out is here to remedy that situation with a loving reissue on 180 gram LP.\"",
