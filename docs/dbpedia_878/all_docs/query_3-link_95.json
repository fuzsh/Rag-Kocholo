        "text": "Reprinted from:\n\nFRESH SOUND\n\nPAT SENATORE TRIO/Ascensione: I don’t normally associate grandpas with sessions on Fresh Sound but you have to make an exception for this cat who you’ve heard plenty of without knowing. A member of the Tijuana Brass, a gig that eventually led to him currently being the music director for Herb Alpert’s jazz hangout, he’s played bass with everyone for the last fifty years plus, and there’s still no dust on him. A sitting down jazz set in the best possible way, Senatore is playing for the art and has more than that special something that let’s you know he’s a cat that understands art and doesn’t use it for a crutch or excuse to be precious. A delightfully breath taking set, this is an old pro not ready to go gently into that good night. A winner throughout.\n\n5015\n\nBy Don Heckman\n\nAs the warm days of September wind to a close, while autumn is just beginning to arrive, the bookings are light at clubs and concert venues around the world, but there’s still some very special music to hear.\n\nLos Angeles\n\n– Sept. 25. (Thurs.) Pat Senatore Trio. Bassist Senatore and his trio – pianist Josh Nelson and drummer Mark Ferber play selections from his exciting new album Ascensione and a forecast of what to expect from his up-coming, soon to be released CD. Vibrato Grill Jazz…etc. (310) 474-9400.\n\n****RINGER OF THE WEEK****\n\nby George W. Harris • October 2, 2014\n\nBecause I live in LA, I’ve probably seen bassist Pat Senatore more times in concert during my lifetime than any other bassist. He was the house bassist for his own club in Malibu during the 70s and 80s, and currently has been the part of the rhythm section for guests that drop in at the Bel Air club Vibrato where he manages as well. Not only that, but you’ve probably heard him a gazillion times yourselves, as he was a part of Herb Alpert’s Tijuana Brass that played major hits like “Lonely Bull” and “A Taste of Honey” so you’re no stranger to him as well.\n\nThis studio session with local studs Josh Nelson/p and Mark Ferber/dr comes off like a typical cozy night at the local jazz club. A tasty mixture of jazz standards and originals focuses on classy interplay, such as Ferber’s gently rollicking rolls on Michel Petrucciani’s “Sahara” or the lithe bop on “Con Alma” and “Minority.” Nelson’s piano work here shows why he’s the #1 call in town for supporting vocalists as he delivers melodic and subtle harmonic support on “Night Dreamer” and shows some wonderful lyricism on his own “A Change in the Wind.” And Senatore? You gotta be kidding? He’s the consummate gentleman, knowing when to deliver a subtle little solo are create a hip rivulet of a groove as on the hip “All The Things You Are.” This album makes you want to hire them next time you feel like singing for your friends or pulling out your sax and blowing for your next get together.\n\nAs Sonny Rollins once said, “Albums are an invitation to your concerts.” Consider this one as a tweet to head out to Vibrato’s.\n\nFresh Sound Records\n\nwww.freshsoundrecords.com\n\nJAZZ AROUND TOWN\n\nby Scott Yanow\n\nA new group in its early stages debuted recently at Vibrato’s. Bassist Pat Senatore, trumpeter and flugelhornist Steve Huffsteter (who does the writing for the band), tenor-saxophonist Chuck Manning and drummer Kendall Kay performed as an appealing pianoless quartet. They played such songs as “It Could Happen To You,” “Tenderly,” “Walkin,’” “Emily,” “”Autumn Leaves,” and “Body And Soul” plus originals based on the chord changes of “Stella By Starlight,” “The Thrill Is Gone,” and “On Green Dolphin Street.”\n\nThe interplay between the musicians was consistently enjoyable, with Huffsteter excelling in this setting while Manning mixed together aspects of 1950s Sonny Rollins and John Coltrane. Pat Senatore took many fine solos and enjoyed varying and breaking up the rhythm behind the other players. For the future, I would suggest having briefer solos and more group ensembles along with more harmonizing behind the solos (a la the Gerry Mulligan Quartet). But even at this early stage, this group is well worth hearing and has lots of potential.\n\n$ 3 gigs, Leopard skin tuxedos, Big Time…\n\n…in Jersey and the Real Big Time with the Tijuana Brass\n\nAfter entering Vibrato on an early Wednesday evening my companion and I were seated immediately. I was there to see and hear bassist Pat Senatore, who was accompanied by pianist Jeff Colella. My companion was Frank Collett, the esteemed pianist, who is now involved in photography. I would take notes and Frank would be taking some candid shots. Everything went well; we were promptly served our delicious meals and settled in to listen to the musicians.\n\nThe duo of Senatore and Colella was quite wonderful, so calming in this beautiful room. Both musicians were very relaxed and played with a quiet authority. People were coming in and were seated quickly by the excellent staff. A large party was seated in the center of the dining space. I noticed a striking painting on one wall and some sculptures high above the bar. This lovely, yet exciting room was created by trumpeter/producer/philanthropist Herb Albert. The art about the room is his work. Vibrato was created to be a welcoming place for patrons and musicians every night. It has hosted the best musicians from around the globe. With a few exceptions, there is no cover charge and this is another way that Alpert supports the jazz community.\n\nPat Senatore has played a pivotal role at Vibrato, as the person who is responsible for booking the talent. I wanted to find out more about Senatore and his long career. He seemed to be a low-key person, very personable and well mannered. He greeted his old friend, Frank Collett, warmly. They go way back to the days when Senatore was running the famous Pasquale’s Jazz Club in Malibu. During our dinner Frank told me that he had played piano at Pasquale’s for a long time. He made the drive over the Santa Monica mountains from his home in North Hollywood and back every night for many months. I was amazed at Frank’s dedication, his tenacity. What I learned about Senatore was quite surprising. His story is very interesting and I hope that he will write a book some day about his experiences as a traveling musician, club owner and now club booker. His story is about how our country has changed over decades. It’s about how a young kid got fascinated by jazz and followed through with some lucky breaks along the way. It all brought him here, to this beautiful jazz club.\n\nL.A. Jazz: Tell me about your early life. Where and when were you born? Big family or small? Did you like school? What were your interests growing up?\n\nContinue reading →\n\nPat Senatore Trio\n\nAscensione\n\n(Fresh Sound)\n\nDuring his years at Vibrato, bassist Pat Senatore has supported and swung a countless number of top jazz musicians on a nightly basis. After all of this time, it was long overdue for him to lead his own album. Senatore could have picked practically any musician in the jazz world for this set since he has played with nearly everyone, so it must have been a bit of an honor for pianist Josh Nelson and drummer Mark Ferber to get the call.\n\nIn addition to his occasional bass solos, Senatore contributed two fine originals (“Ascensione” and “Positano Blues”) and put together a well-rounded program that also includes two Michel Petrucciani tunes, four jazz standards and Nelson’s “A Change In The Wind.” While everyone has their spots, Josh Nelson (who deserves to be famous beyond Los Angeles) is the main soloist. His playing falls into the modern mainstream yet looks ahead and always avoids stating the obvious.\n\nFans of swinging modern jazz will find much to enjoy on Pat Senatore’s fine outing which is available from www.freshsoundrecords.com.\n\nScott Yanow"
