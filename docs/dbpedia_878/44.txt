Chico Hamilton, drummer for such jazz legends as Duke Ellington, Count Basie, and Lena Horne, has passed away at the age of 92. Hamilton came up during the post-war “cool jazz” era, notably performing as an original member of Gerry Mulligan’s quartet in the early 50’s.

Hamilton was born in L.A. in 1921, and has been a central figure of “West Coast Jazz” for most of his career. Hamilton’s early years on the scene involved playing in bands with musicians such as Charles Mingus and Dexter Gordon, while also backing vocalists including Nat King Cole, Sammy Davis Jr., and a six-year stint in Lena Horne’s band.

The drummer struck out on his own in 1955 with a trio record featuring George Duvivier on bass and Howard Roberts on guitar. From there, he formed a landmark West Coast Jazz quintet, which featured the unique instrumentation of drums, guitar, bass, flute, and cello. He maintained the quintet with extensive touring and recording through 1960. In 1961, he reworked the group, replacing the flute with assorted reeds courtesy of Charles Lloyd, and the cello with trombonist George Bohanon, and began pursuing a more avant-garde approach to jazz.

As his career progressed, Hamilton increasingly turned his attention towards composition. In 1987 he formed the group Euphoria, whom he continued to perform with through his final days. His 2001 album with the group featured special guest spots from Charlie Watts, Eric Schenkman (Spin Doctors), and John Popper, the latter two having studied under Hamilton at The New School in New York City. His final release was his 2011 album Revelation, though he had completed a follow-up, Inquiring Minds, already scheduled for release next year.
