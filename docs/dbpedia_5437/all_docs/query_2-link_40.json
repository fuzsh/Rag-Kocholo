        "text": "The Botticelli Hotel in Florence centre is located in the heart of the city, in the strategic Via Taddea, very close to the most important historical, natural and artistic sites of the Tuscan capital.\n\nThis 4-star hotel is a concentrate of elegance and refinement. It is inside the Palazzetto già Serragli, a historic building dating back to the second half of the 16th century. It has numerous modern conveniences available for the public, while preserving all the atmosphere of an ancient era.\n\nIn fact, the hotel boasts numerous important elements: the ribbed vaults on the ground floor, the “kneeling” internal window with stone shelves and iron grate, the characteristic loggia on the second floor.\n\nThe central location is ideal for the traveller who intends to spend a holiday of total relaxation and discovery of the city.\n\nThe hotel is close to the Uffizi Gallery: the famous Gallery is just one kilometre away and can be easily reached on foot.\n\nInside is the largest existing collection of Raphael and Botticelli. There are also numerous works by Giotto, Tiziano, Pontormo, Bronzino, Andrea del Sarto, Caravaggio, Durer, Rubens, Leonardo da Vinci.\n\nThis collection comes from the Medici collections, enriched over time by bequests, exchanges and donations.\n\nIt is divided into various rooms arranged by schools and styles in chronological order. It boasts the world’s best collection of Florentine Renaissance artworks, with works ranging from the 12th to the 18th century.\n\nThe location of the 4-star Botticelli Hotel in the centre of Florence allows you to quickly reach the Cathedral and admire the beauties that can be found inside, but not only that.\n\nAmong these, the Brunelleschi dome certainly stands out, the roof of the cathedral which still today is the largest masonry dome ever built.\n\nInside the Cathedral, on the other hand, it is possible to admire the largest surface ever decorated with frescoes: a good 3600 square metres completed by Giorgio Vasari and Federico Zuccari.\n\nThe façade of the Cathedral in polychrome marble, dating back to 1887 and the work of Emilio de Fabris, is the most important example of neo-Gothic style in Italy.\n\nJust over a 15-minute walk from the 4-star hotel in central Florence we find one of the most important historic parks in the city. The Boboli Gardens was born as the grand ducal garden of Palazzo Pitti and is an authentic open-air museum.\n\nIt is one of the best examples of an Italian garden in the world. It boasts a rich collection of sculptures, an extraordinary architectural-landscape setting and different types of environment.\n\nThe gardens were built between the 16th and 19th centuries by the Medici family and was later enlarged by the Habsburg-Lorraine and the Savoys.\n\nThey occupy an area of 45,000 square metres and boast paths, ponds, fountains such as that of Neptune and the Ocean. There are also nymphaeums, small temples and caves, like the famous one created by Bernardo Buontalenti. The statues and the various buildings are particularly important.\n\nThe terraced area is particularly suggestive: there, we can find the eighteenth-century pavilion of the Kaffeehaus, a rare example of rococo architecture in Tuscany, as well as the Limonaia, built by Zanobi del Rosso in the second half of the eighteenth century.\n\nJust over a kilometre separates us from one of the main squares in the historic centre of Florence, dedicated to the Basilica di Santa Croce.\n\nIt was built during the thirteenth century and during the Renaissance it became the privileged location for jousts, parties, shows and popular competitions.\n\nThe famous Basilica of Santa Croce overlooks it; it is one of the largest Franciscan churches in Italy. Inside there are works by Giotto, sculptures by Benedetto da Maiano, Desiderio da Settignano and Canova. It is also the burial place of personalities such as Galilei, Foscolo, Michelangelo, Machiavelli.\n\nThe square, one of the unmissable destinations during a stay in a hotel in central Florence, is bordered by many important buildings, such as the Cocchi-Serristori, Casa Chiavacci, Casa del Diluvio, Palazzo di Maffeo Barberini, Casa Galilei, Casa Benvenuti Galletti, Palazzo Gargiolli, Palazzo Gherardi Borghini, Palazzo dell’Antella, Casa Bartolini Baldelli, Palazzo Bartolini Baldelli.\n\nIn front of the Basilica, we find the monument dedicated to Dante Alighieri and made by Enrico Pazzi in 1865.\n\nJust 200 metres from the Botticelli Hotel is one of the historic markets of Florence, a fascinating place that boasts over 140 years of history.\n\nThe San Lorenzo Market is divided into two separate sections.\n\nThe indoor one is commonly known as the Central Market and is dedicated to food. It rises on two levels, inside a beautiful wonderful building in cast iron and glass.\n\nOn the ground floor we find butchers, fishmongers, fruit and vegetable stalls, small shops with local products such as olive oil, meat, cheese.\n\nThis section is open Monday to Friday 07.00 to 14.00 and Saturday 07.00 to 17.00.\n\nThe first floor is open 7 days a week, from 10.00 to 24.00. The 3,000 square metres of surface area host 500 seats and 12 stalls, each of which dedicated to an Italian speciality, such as cheese, Chianti, bakery products.\n\nIt is the ideal location if you want to taste some of the best Tuscan and Florentine freshly prepared specialities.\n\nThe outdoor section is open from Tuesday to Saturday and develops along the surrounding streets: here, you can find leather objects such as bags, belts, wallets and jackets, local artefacts, clothes, souvenirs of all kinds.\n\nAmong the Botticelli’s strong points is certainly its location. For example, the hotel in Florence is near Santa Maria Novella, one of the historic districts of the city, to the west of the San Giovanni area, on the right bank of the Arno.\n\nIt can only be reached on foot in 10 minutes. Just travel 750 minutes passing through Via Rosina, Via Sant’Antonino, Piazza dell’Unità Italiana, Via degli Avelli.\n\nIt is one of the most beautiful locations in the city, suggestive, captivating, full of things to see and places to visit.\n\nAmong the most important, the Basilica of Santa Maria Novella certainly stands out, one of the best examples of Gothic-Florentine style architecture in the city.\n\nIt is part of the Santa Maria Novella Museum, which also includes the Great Cloister and the Green Cloister.\n\nThe location of the Hotel, near Santa Maria Novella in Florence, allows you to quickly reach other places of worship in the same neighborhood: Church of Santi Michele e Gaetano, Basilica of Santa Trinita, Church of Ognissanti.\n\nThose who want to live a cultural experience can visit the Museo Novecento, the Marino Marini Museum, Palazzo Strozzi, the Palazzo Davanzati Museum and the Ferragamo Museum.\n\nChoosing a hotel in Florence in the Santa Maria Novella area also means being within walking distance of the city’s exhibition centre. Here we find Fortezza da Basso, Palazzo degli Affari and Palazzo dei Congressi, locations that host events of international importance.\n\nShopping lovers will be able to discover shops and shops located between Piazza della Repubblica, Via de’ Tornabuoni, Via della Vigna Nuova.\n\nAnother plus of the Botticelli Hotel in Florence is being close to the Santa Maria Novella station, the most important railway hub in the city and in the whole of Tuscany, a stop for the FrecciaRossa and Italo high-speed trains."
