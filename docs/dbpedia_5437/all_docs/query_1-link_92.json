        "text": "Arcangelo Corelli was born in Fusignano in 1653 and died in Rome in 1713. He was a composer.\n\nCorelli was born in Fusignano on February the 17th 1653 from a rich local family.\n\nHis music training began in his home town, then he studied in Faenza, Lugo and, finally, Bologna where, thanks to the teaching of great violinists like Giovanni Benvenuti and Leonardo Brugnoli, he became part of the local academy ” Accademia Filarmonica” in 1670.\n\nThe following year he moved to Rome. Here he studied composition with the tutor Marco Simonelli, he also began playing as a professional violinist in the church of “S.Lucia dei Francesi” and worked for important local personalities. Apart from some tourneés in Italy and outside the country, he lived in Rome all his life, till his death on January the 8th 1713.\n\nHe produced four collection of “Sonate a tre” (Opera I, II, III, and IV), one of Sonate for solo violin and “Basso continuo” (Opera V) and one of “Concerti Grossi” (Opera VI). Corelli is also important for his educational and teaching activity, since he started to practice violin teaching techniques that became very popular in Europe till the end of the XVIII century."
