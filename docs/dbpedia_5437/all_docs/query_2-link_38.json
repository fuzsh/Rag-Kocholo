        "text": "From cohabiting to collapsing, and vice versa, those were the movements and actions that we proposed from ‘ace for the seventh edition of Together Apart. We chose the title Cohabiting Borders with the intention of exploring the complexities that occur in the exchange of living together, and because we understand the meeting format of this program as an exercise in itself of cohabitation of a frontier: the border between our online and offline existence.\n\nFor this collective research, we also defined three axes that helped us review some possible strategies for cohabiting borders, these were: pointing frontiers, deprogramming frontiers, and metabolizing frontiers.\n\nIn this way, we were also able to observe different types of borders that contemporary artistic practices explore, from geopolitical, climatic, and technological borders, as well as the borders between forms of knowledge and methods of linking with the world.\n\nThe participating artists designed collaborative dynamics based on their areas and disciplines of knowledge but above all, opening themselves to the encounter with the experience of the other(s). In this way, great relevance was given to the exchange and the works generated from the reflection on the possible points of articulation between artists from very varied contexts.\n\nIn tune with the online environment of the program, many artists used that condition of “being connected” as an object and means of research, development and presentation of their works. They used streaming platforms such as Twitch and social media visual resources (Instagram filters) or video games. Also, several of Google&#39;s tools were used. In some cases these were useful to observe photographic records of artificially generated borders between countries (Google Street View) and in others, the artists resorted to them to point out the limiting or creative interactions that are possible between human knowledge and artificial intelligences. (Google translate). In turn, there were many proposals that involved leaving the online world towards an exploration of the environments where each artist was and the records of it through\n\nphotographs, videos and the creation of video-essays.\n\nMoved from the beginning by the desire to understand borders as membranes rather than walls, during the month of work, the artists began collaborative creative searches that have led to visual exercises that will be presented at the ´ace Foundation on Wednesday March 23 and that in many cases, they will be ongoing investigations."
