Born in Manitowaning, Helen spent most of her life in southern Ontario. She moved back to Manitoulin Island in July of last year to be close to her daughter and grandson in Little Current, and brother and nephews in Sudbury. Beloved wife of Donald Sanderson (predeceased), daughter of Art Mastin and Katherine Mastin (both predeceased), sister of her forever ï¿½baby brotherï¿½ Rennie Mastin (Sudbury), sister to Cay Mastin (predeceased), mother to Beth Richards and grandmother to Sean Redmore, aunt to nephews Rennie Jr., Ryan, Jonathon, Andrew, Ian, and Barry (predeceased), godmother to Ryan Mastin, and sister-in-spirit to Lee Davis (Auntie Lee). Helen was an accomplished athlete and at various stages of her life was passionately engaged in skiing, tennis, skating, and horseback riding. She loved animals, especially her pets, and all nature. She was an avid traveler. With her second husband, Don Sanderson, she travelled throughout Europe and the British Isles. Bridge was another passion. She looked forward every week to bridge games with her friends around Erin, Ontario, as well as a bridge club she had recently joined in Mindemoya. Helen enjoyed her fireside chats after bridge with Marion Seabrook, during which Marionï¿½s cat found a home on Helenï¿½s lap. But her favorite cats were her own, both rescue cats, Ariel and Kelpie. After supporting her first husband, Bill Richards (predeceased) to finish his Bachelors and Law Degree, Helen went back to school herself, obtaining straight Aï¿½s at York University in every course she registered for. She loved to read and was particularly interested in history. She was also an excellent and talented writer, many of her letters home faithfully preserved by her own mother for many years, and now by her daughter. Helen never had a mean word to say about anyone. She was beautiful, highly intelligent, witty, a great friend and a wonderful mother, sister, aunt and grandma. She will be dearly missed by everyone who knew and loved her.

Mike is now with his other loving family members and friends who went before him and were waiting to welcome him to his new home. He lovingly leaves his Mom and Dad, John and Sharon of Bay Estates on Manitoulin Island; his partner Lindsay Tate of Sudbury and their daughter Maraina; his former wife Denyse of Sudbury and their son Mason; his loving and supportive siblings, his sister Cheryl Fabbro (Jamie) of Sudbury, and their children Brendan, Will, Caden and Mike's namesake Mikayla; his brother Brian (Debbie) of Scottsdale, Arizona and their children Ryan and Redmond; his brother Dave (Kim) of Upland, California, and their children Cameron, Megan (predeceased) and Kristin; his Grandparents, Art (predeceased) and Winnie Hilliman of St. Catharines and Wiliam and Dorothy Savage (both predeceased) of Sudbury. Sadly missed by loving aunts, uncles and cousins. Mike enjoyed many outdoor activities including golfing and fishing and loved spending time at the camp on Manitoulin Island. He was very athletic and played many sports during his school years at R.L. Beattie and McLeod elementary schools and Lo-Ellen Park Secondary School, still holding some school and city records in track and field. His main love was hockey, playing on Sudbury's travelling minor teams, the Garson Native Sons of the NOJHL junior league and three years of major Jr. A with the Sudbury Wolves and Belleville Bulls. He was especially proud to wear the Sudbury Wolves sweater and continued to be a Wolves supporter in later life. In 1996-97 he was an assistant coach with the Wolves. Mike also attended the University of Toronto playing with the Varsity Blues for two years. Mike often jokingly reminded his younger brother Brian that he had cleared away all the hurdles for him, making his path to the NHL an easier one. Upon returning to Sudbury in 1993, Mike continued with his love of hockey, playing with the Sudbury Nooners and many other recreational teams. Mike had a way of turning most people he met into good friends, so he leaves behind many more people that he loved and who loved him. His family and friends will miss his company, his good natured kidding and his wry sense of humour which stayed with him until he left us. Mike was so happy to be a father. He was so very proud of his son Mason, who he was able to help guide through the first 12 years of his life. And he was so happy to be able to spend a few precious months with his beautiful little daughter Maraina who brightened his life while he fought so hard against his terrible disease. Rested at the Jackson and Barnard Funeral Home, 233 Larch St., Sudbury. Funeral Service was at St. Andrew's United Church, 111 Larch St, Sudbury, Saturday, December 23rd, 2006 at 11:30 am.
