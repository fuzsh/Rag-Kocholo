        "text": "Benvenuti History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nItaly\n\nThe Benvenuti family can trace its noble origins to the Italian region of Tuscany. Although people were originally known only by a single name, it became necessary for people to adapt a second name to identify themselves as populations grew and travel became more frequent. The process of adopting fixed hereditary surnames was not complete until the modern era, but the use of hereditary family names in Italy began in the 10th and 11th centuries. Italian hereditary surnames were developed according to fairly general principles and they are characterized by a profusion of derivatives coined from given names. Although the most traditional type of family name found in the region of Tuscany is the patronymic surname, which is derived from the father's given name, local surnames are also found. Local names, which are the least frequent of the major types of surnames found in Italy, are derived from a place-name where the original bearer once resided or held land. Often Italian local surnames bore the prefix \"di,\" which signifies emigration from one place to another, but does not necessarily denote nobility. The Benvenuti family lived in the lands of Tuscany.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Benvenuti family\n\nThe surname Benvenuti was first found in the area of Florence. Earliest records can be found dating back to the Benvenuti family of counts, who moved to Cingoli from Florence in 1200.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Benvenuti family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Benvenuti research.

They reflect the regional variations and the many dialects of the Italian language, each with its own distinctive features. For example, in Northern Italy the typical Italian surname suffix is \"i\", whereas in Southern Italy it is \"o\". Additionally, spelling changes frequently occurred because medieval scribes and church officials often spelled names as they sounded rather than according to any specific spelling rules. The spelling variations in the name Benvenuti include Benvenuti, Benvenuto, Benvegnu, Ventui, Venutti, Venuto, Venutelli, Begnudelli, Vignudelli, Vignodelli, Vignudini, Nuti, Nutini, Gnuti and many more.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Benvenuti family\n\nProminent among members of the family was\n\nLorenzo Benvenuti, who was born in Florence in the late 14th century, and was mayor of the city in 1418, mayor of San Giovanni in 1419, and mayor of Prato in 1421.
