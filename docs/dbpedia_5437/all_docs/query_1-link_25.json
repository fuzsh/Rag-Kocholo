Conceived and co-curated by Joseph Rodota along with Kevin Clarke of the Schwules Museum and Katherine Bucknell, the show considered Isherwood and Bachardy’s thirty-three year partnership as well as Isherwood’s earlier years in Berlin and Bachardy’s later career. It included nudes by Bachardy (generously loaned by Suzelle Smith and Don Howarth), portraits by Bachardy and David Hockney, photographs by Wayne Shimabukuro, and pieces from the museum's archive. The opening was marked by a conversation among Katherine Bucknell, Kevin Clarke, and Edmund White, followed by a reception at the museum attended by Suzelle Smith and Don Howarth, Kevin Clarke, Peter Rehberg and Chris Paxton of the Schwules Museum, and members of the Isherwood Foundation.\n\nOn June 13, 2019, Chris & Don: A Love Story, the documentary by Guido Santi and Tina Mascara, had its first Berlin screening at Village Berlin. Mascara answered questions from Peter Rehberg, head of collections and archives at the Schwules Museum.\n\nIn affiliation with the Isherwood Foundation and the Schwules Museum, the art organisation Instinct.Berlin invited artists to respond to Isherwood and Bachardy's legacy in The Cat and the Horse, an exhibition at Village Berlin (September 12-15, 2019). The opening featured a performance drawing by Gareth Ernst, based on drawings Bachardy made of Ernst.\n\nAs a man Guido was sophisticated, intuitive and gentle. As a filmmaker, he was determined, driven by a curiosity that although intensely passionate was never intrusive or predatory. After long courtship, his subjects always yielded their inmost secrets. The subjects were unconventional, the secrets arresting and inspiring. Guido searched through his camera lens for a storyline that was both true and compelling. Like all great documentary filmmakers, he knew the right questions to ask. He was an obsessive recorder, accumulating enough footage to permit him to narrate with conviction. He knew how to get down to the nerve, to the heart of things. He was a master of his art.\n\nMuch of Guido’s best work was done in collaboration with his wife, Tina. In her he found a filmmaker whose talent and sensibility complemented his own. Together they made another prize-winning film, Monk with a Camera, and the company they founded, Asphalt Stars, is currently in production on The Muslim Other and Don Bachardy: License to Look.\n\nGuido Santi, born Genoa, Italy, May 9, 1962; died Los Angeles, California, February 4, 2019.\n\nIn Italy, he earned a B.A. in Philosophy, summa cum laude, at the Università degli Studi di Urbino, apprenticed with Ipotesi Cinema, a film laboratory coordinated by Cannes and Venice award-winning director Ermanno Olmi (The Tree of the Wooden Clogs), and produced and directed hundreds of reports about technology, entertainment and social issues for Italy’s national TV, RAI. At RAI, he also produced and directed his first documentary biographies, about Luciano Pavarotti and about the Academy Award-winning director, Vittoria De Sica (The Bicycle Thief), and he wrote and directed Concertino, produced by Monica Vitti and Leo Benvenuti, about four teenagers living in the suburbs of Rome.\n\nIn Los Angeles, he earned an M.A. in Film and Television Production at USC, where he won a Tom Bush Scholarship Award for Excellence in Cinematography and a Phi Beta Kappa International Distinguished Student Scholarship Award. Later, he won a Pendleton Research and Production Grant. He produced and directed many more documentaries and TV specials about illegal immigration, gangs in Los Angeles, 9/11, and other topical subjects.\n\nHe was an assistant professor in the Department of Cinema, Photography, and Media Arts at Ithaca College in New York State, and he taught at USC, the Studio School, UCLA Extension and Columbia College, Hollywood, in Los Angeles, as well as contributing as a guest artist at workshops and seminars around the country. Since 2002, he lectured in Film Aesthetics and History of Cinema and taught cinematography and directing at College of the Canyons in Santa Clarita, California, where he was Professor and Co-Chair of the Cinema Department at the time of his death.\n\nChris & Don: A Love Story premiered at the Telluride Film Festival in 2008. It won best documentary at the Miami LGBT Festival, the Spokane Film Festival, and the Sulmona International Film Festival, and it was nominated for best documentary by the Gotham Film Award and GLAAD Media Award.\n\nIt is now available on iTunes and Prime.\n\nMonk with a Camera (2013) won Best Feature at the 2017 Rishikesh Art and Film Festival and was nominated for Best Documentary Feature at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in 2014.\n\nhttps://www.hometownstation.com/santa-clarita-news/education/college-of-the-canyons/college-of-the-canyons-professor-guido-santi-remembered-as-genuine-caring-265705\n\nThe Animals & A Meeting by the River, The Podcast\n\nThe love story of Christopher Isherwood and Don Bachardy is told through their letters, followed by an audio performance of A Meeting by the River, the play they adapted together from Isherwood’s last novel. The Animals is based on the book, The Animals: Love Letters Between Christopher Isherwood and Don Bachardy. The series is presented by Katherine Bucknell. Simon Callow is Christopher Isherwood and Alan Cumming is Don Bachardy. Anthony Page directs A Meeting by the River, starring Dominic West, Kyle Soller, Penelope Wilton and Annabel Mullion. The original music is composed by Edmund Jolliffe.\n\nThe eleven thirty-five minute episodes are available free. Listen on line at www.TheAnimalsPodcast.com or on iTunes or wherever you listen to podcasts.\n\nIn May 2017, during the David Hockney retrospective at Tate Britain, Alan Cumming and Angus Wright staged a dramatic reading from The Animals and from Isherwood’s diaries in front of David Hockney’s double portrait of Isherwood and Bachardy. Alan Cumming and Simon Callow re-staged the reading in February 2018 to a sold-out auditorium at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York to coincide with the display of the double portrait in the Hockney retrospective there."
