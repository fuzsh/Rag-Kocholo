The collection also contains significant holdings in American and European painting and decorative arts, 19th- and 20th-century art, an extensive collection of works on paper, Asian textiles, and traditional works from Africa, Oceania, and the Americas. Other highlights include the Samuel H. Kress collection of Italian Renaissance paintings and the James A. Michener collection of ukiyo-e prints.
