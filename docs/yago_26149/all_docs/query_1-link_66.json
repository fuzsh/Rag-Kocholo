        "text": "John Starr Cooke was a descendant of Dr. Comfort Starr, who came to New England, USA in 1635. He was a great patron and benefactor to Harvard College, which began in 1639 on the site of his former house Cooke’s great-grandparents Amos Starr Cooke and Juliette Montague arrived at the (then) Sandwich Isles in 1838 as missionaries. They established the Royal School where all five final monarchs of Hawaii were educated, including the final ruler Queen Liliokulana. The Cookes left missionary work in 1850 and went into business, establishing Castle and Cooke, a farm supply enterprise, with another ex-missionary family. The good fortune of the Cooke family continued as they diversified into sugar, pineapples, irrigation, railroads, shipping and banking. John Cooke’s grandparents Charles Montague and Anna Rice Cooke (also a daughter of missionaries), travelled widely, particularly to the Far East, where they indulged their passion for collecting fine art. John Starr Cooke was born in 1920, one of eight children in the family. John’s mother Lily Love died in 1933, and his father Clarence Hyde Cooke took him on a long cruise soon afterwards. In 1943, Cooke was married, on the advice of the Ouija board, to Wilma Dorothy Vermilyea, who became known as Millen Cooke. Millen Cooke was a poet, occultist and Science Fiction author, most prolific between May 1946 and May 1950. Dianetics by L. Ron Hubbard was released in mid-1950. When Millen Cooke read Dianetics later that year, she was so enthused that she immediately went alone to New York to explore this new work with serious practitioners. John followed Millen to New York, where he joined the Dianetics practitioners. Millen and John were divorced in 1951, and she was briefly married to John’s friend and associate William Belknap Jr. The Belknaps were both into Dianetics. Millen later married Brinsley Le Poer Trench, with whom she co-authored some seminal works on flying saucers. John Cooke lived in North Africa for the next six years, mostly in Tangier. In 1952, John and Mary Oser married. In early 1956 they travelled to London. John Cooke was about to purchase a Tarot deck, which had belonged to Aleister Crowley, and was annotated in Crowley’s hand. Cooke was warned against buying these cards with dire consequences predicted should Cooke proceed; Cooke bought the cards and returned to Tangier. He became paralysed from the waist down. After some unsuccessful attempts at treatment, John Cooke returned to the US, and never walked again and preferred the dignity of the wheelchair. An apparently miraculous new mystical technique was announced to the press in November 1957 by actress Eva Bartok. She claimed to have been cured of cancer by the methods of Subud. At this time, John took an interest in Subud. He helped finance Pak Subuh to come to the US. From 1958 the Subud group became a meditation group centred around John. He moved to a clifftop mansion at Carmel, California, and his reputation as a “real wizard” grew among the Beat community of San Francisco’s North Beach area. Between October 1962 and May 1963, Cooke painted the images 22 New Tarot cards with the old Tarot trump names. In November 1963, when Cooke moved to Mexico, he was soon followed by his chief disciple Michael Bowen. After some months in Mexico, Cooke sent Bowen on his way with a mission to find, befriend and evaluate Timothy Leary. Bowen and certain others became known as Psychedelic Rangers, roaming protagonists for LSD. The Rangers were loosely under Cooke’s control. Michael Bowen moved to New York and in 1965 made his way to Millbrook to meet Leary and his associates for the first of several visits. Bowen introduced Leary to the idea of a new religion, the League for Spiritual Discovery, whose sacrament was LSD. The League was an attempt to provide an appropriate setting for the drug before such legislation was enacted. Leary announced the League in September 1966. In San Francisco, Bowen joined Allen Cohen on the staff of the Oracle, the main counter-culture newspaper of the Haight Ashbury district. However, LSD was to become illegal on 6 October 1966. Michael Bowen was actively involved in the Haight Ashbury community and was at the press conference for the Council for a Summer of Love in April 1967. In 1968, John Cooke and Rosalind Sharpe published T: The New Tarot. In early 1969, Ralph Metzner added an introduction and Cooke mailed a copy to William S Burroughs, John Starr Cooke died on August 21 1976 at age 56 in Tepoztlán, Morelos, Mexico,"
