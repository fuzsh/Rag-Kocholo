        "text": "#7021, Mary Annis COOKE\n\nBorn 1846 in Honolulu, Hawaii, USA Died 1920 in Honolulu, Hawaii, USA\n\nMary was Charles' second wife. Mary was the daughter of the Rev. Amos Starr Cooke who was born 1st September 1810 in Connecticut, USA and died in Honolulu on 20th March 1871, and Juliette Montague who was born 12th march 1812 in USA and died 11th August 1896 also in Honolulu. They had married on 24th November 1836 and had 7 children. Rev. Amos and his wife were missionaries in Hawaii and ran most of the trading there. It seems that Mary's parents did not approve of the marriage so she chose to be known as Annis Montague and later as Annis Montague Turner. She became a noted prima donna and hence the name of her husband's opera company."
