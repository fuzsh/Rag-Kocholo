Under the direction of the Director of Advancement, the Associate Director of Advancement’s primary role is to institute and manage HoMA’s planned giving program, ensure ongoing and increased support from foundations and corporate funders, and oversee management of the major gift program. The Associate Director of Advancement is expected to establish a framework for strategic, integrated donor cultivation, solicitation, acknowledgement and relationship management across the fundraising spectrum and is responsible for the leadership and management of the Museum’s fundraising initiatives, including individual philanthropy (major and planned gifts, direct mail appeals, Internet outreach), foundation and corporate giving, special events special initiatives, Board giving and Campaigns.\n\nAs Associate Director of Advancement, this role will supervise and oversee major gifts, estate gifts, and corporate donations. As a key member of the museum’s Advancement team, the Associate Director will inspire and steward philanthropic support to advance the museum’s mission.\n\nHoMA was founded in 1927 by Anna Rice Cooke, the daughter of a prominent missionary family. She married Charles Montague Cooke, also of a prominent missionary family, and settled in Honolulu, building a home in 1882 on Beretania Street, on the site where HoMA resides today.\n\nFrom the beginning, Anna Rice Cooke, who spoke fluent Hawaiian, wanted a Museum that reflected the unique attributes of Hawaiʻi’s multicultural makeup. Not bound by the traditional western idea of art museums, she also wanted to create an institution that showcased the island’s natural beauty and climate in an open and airy environment. Her thoughtful consideration is evidenced in the charming courtyards that interconnect the various galleries throughout the Museum.\n\nHoMA is dedicated to the collection, preservation, interpretation and teaching of the visual arts, and the presentation of exhibitions, performing arts and public programs specifically relevant to Hawaiʻi’s ethnically diverse community.\n\nThe permanent collection has grown from 500 works to more than 50,000 pieces spanning 5,000 years.\n\nThe Museum has one of the largest single collections of Asian and Pan-Pacific art in the United States, including an unrivaled collection by artists of Hawaiʻi and the Pacific. The collection also contains significant holdings in American and European painting and decorative arts, 19th- and 20th-century art, an extensive collection of works on paper, Asian textiles, and traditional works from Africa, Oceania, and the Americas. Other highlights include the Samuel H. Kress collection of Italian Renaissance paintings and the James A. Michener collection of ukiyo-e prints. In July 2011, The Contemporary Museum gifted its collections and assets to HoMA, merging the two art museums and ushering in a renewed commitment to the art of our time.\n\nFLSA: Exempt\n\nWork Hours: Monday-Friday 8:00am – 5:00pm Some evenings and weekends\n\nMinimum Qualifications:\n\nBachelor's Degree in business administration, marketing, or related field.\n\n8 years overall development and fundraising experience for a non-profit.\n\n2 years planned giving experience.\n\n2 years major gifts and corporate partnerships experience.\n\nAbility to establish fundraising priorities; achieve annual fundraising goals; maintain contact with major donors, board members, and corporate and foundation leaders.\n\n2 years experience as a supervisor and program manager/director.\n\nKnowledge of writing and reviewing planned giving contracts and personal wills.\n\nAbility to write contracts and agreements with corporate sponsors.\n\nProficiency in Tessitura, Raiser’s Edge, DonorPerfect or comparable knowledge of a CRM.\n\nMust be detail-oriented and have excellent organizational skills.\n\nAbility to interact with the public as well as cross-departmentally.\n\nMust be a team player and willing to share own expertise for the good of the museum.\n\nHandles incoming gifts and donations in a fiscally responsible and confidential manner.\n\nProficiency in Microsoft Office Applications.\n\nAbility to manage the duties of this position without close supervision.
