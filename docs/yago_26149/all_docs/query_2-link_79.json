His father and mother wee of the noble band of missionaries, and landed in Honolulu in 1840 from their home in Maine. Upon his arrival in Honolulu Mr. Dole the elder took charge of the Punahou college, which was then about to be started, and which is to-day to be started, and which is to-day and enduring monument to his intelligence and care, for it is the Alma Mater of many of the foremost men of Hawaii. Mr. Dole lived to see the good results of his early labor, passing away in 1878.\n\nThe subject of this sketch received his primary education at this institution, and remained there and at Kauai, with a year meanwhile spent at Punanou, until he had more than attained his majority. His father was in moderate financial circumstances, and young Dole, having chosen the law as his profession, had employed himself in various capacities in order to acquire the necessary means to prosecute his studies. By industry and economy he succeeded in so doing, and at the age of 22 went to Williams college in Massachusetts and took the general course for a year, after which he entered the law office of William Brigham, of Boston. There he applied himself closely, and after a twelve-month was admitted to practice in the courts of Suffolk county, Mass. Soon after this he returned to his native islands, and was admitted to the bar of the Hawaiian islands. He began a general practice, and followed his profession until 1887, when he was appointed to the supreme bench.\n\nDuring all this time Mr. Dole had been an interested observer of political events, and had endeavored to bring about a condition of affairs beneficial to the nation, and enhance the dignity of the legal profession in Hawaii. In 1884 he first became a member of the legislature. He was also a member of the legislature in 1886, and the duties of the position were faithfully performed, in addition to the large amount of work which the interests of his clients demanded. He took a very prominent part in the reform movement which culminated int he revolution of 1887."
