        "text": "From Home to Museum: The Founding of HoMA\n\nA Short History of the Honolulu Museum of Art & HoMA Today\n\nThe Honolulu Museum of Art houses some of Hawai’i’s greatest visual treasures. They hold a large collection of cultural antiquities from around the globe including, but not limited to, Japanese prints, arts of Africa and, of course, Polynesian art. Along with these historical gems, the HoMA is home to many contemporary works that offer visitors an insight into the evolution of humanity’s expression. The HoMA now continues to provide an environment that fosters creativity, but that would not be possible without their humble beginnings rooting from passion and a vision.\n\nHoMA’s History\n\nThe HoMA derived from the mind of Anna Rice, the daughter of missionaries who taught at Punahou school during the 1800’s. On April 29, 1874, Anna married Charles Montague Cooke in Lihue, Kaua’i, and they settled in Honolulu shortly after.\n\nAfter a few years of Charles’ professional success in the lumber and shipping industry, the couple built a two-story victorian inspired house on Beretania Street. They began collecting art, starting with imports from furniture maker Yuen Kwock Fong Inn. Inn’s brother assisted in having textiles and ceramics sent from China.\n\nAs the Cookes slowly started to broaden their collection, Anna grew a fondness for the Asian arts. She collected an array of Korean ceramics, Chinese jade, and Japanese screens. The couple toured Japan in 1903 and returned with several crates of Japanese artwork, including sculptures, ornaments, and even foliage.\n\nAlthough the Cookes managed to build up a remarkable collection of Asian works, they also acquired some rather notable western art. The HoMA housed work from Californian landscapist William Keith, American artist Thomas Moran, and hosted a Dutch 17th century painting from an unknown artist titled, The Burgermeisters Family.\n\nWith the help of her daughter and daughter-in-law, Anna procured a charter for the museum in 1922. She hired a New York architect by the name of Bertram Goodhue to create a building that reflected the culture of Hawai’i through its design.\n\nHoMA Today\n\nThe museum expanded to become a place of education aside from a visual delicacy. The Honolulu Museum of Art School now offers class sessions for any experience level. The courses include multi-week classes for an array of mediums, and runs for all four seasons. The Art School building was recently renovated during Spring 2022, so they now provide updated equipment and studios fit for a more than thorough experience.\n\nHoMA is also houses the Doris Duke Theatre a hidden gem in Honolulu that offers a unique and intimate setting for experiencing the arts. The small 280 seat theatre is located in the Honolulu Museum of Art. With an excellent sound system and top-notch projection the theatre screens a variety of independent, documentary, and international films, as well as lectures, performances, and concerts. There’s always something interesting going on, so be sure to check the schedule.\n\nAs the HoMA continues to evolve, they remain loyal to the legacy Anna and Charles instilled on Beretania Street many years ago. Whether you want to see art from across oceans, or learn about some of the history of Hawai’i, the HoMa offers an experience beyond the two-dimensional page.\n\nIf you wish to visit the HoMA, their details can be found here: https://honolulumuseum.org/\n\nThe Art School’s class information can be found here: https://honolulumuseum.org/art-school/"
