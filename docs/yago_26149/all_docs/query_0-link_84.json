Sure, there is plenty of natural beauty here, but Honolulu’s charms lie in its history, culture, and culinary options. Oh, and the chance to hike up to delightful Diamond Head. Did we ever mention how beautiful Hawaii is?\n\nHonolulu is all local art and mouth-watering flavors, history, and heritage with no small amount of royalty around every corner. The Hawaiian capital is a Very Important City where the tangible impact of history fills every nook and cranny. First-timer experiences like visiting Pearl Harbor are a must, but Honolulu is a city the reveals more with each new visit. These are the best things to do in Honolulu, Hawaii’s gateway to the world.\n\nDone something on this list and loved it? Share it with the hashtag #TimeOutDoList and tag @TimeOutEverywhere."
