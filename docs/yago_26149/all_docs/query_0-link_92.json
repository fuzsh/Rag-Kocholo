        "text": "The Honolulu Museum of Art has a permanent collection that includes 50,000 pieces spanning 5,000 years. The museum is known for its significant collection of Asian art, American and European paintings and decorative arts, 19th- and 20th-century art and traditional works from Africa, Oceania and the Americas. The museum, formerly known as the Honolulu Academy of Arts, was founded in 1927 by Anna Rice Cooke and Charles Montague Cooke, both from prominent missionary families. They erected their home on Beretania Street and over the years collected art. When it outgrew their home, the Cookes established the museum. Today, the museum also hosts traveling exhibitions, monthly night events, art classes and more.\n\nRecommended for Best Attractions & Activities because: This art museum houses a variety of art from around the world.\n\nTiffany Hill's expert tip: Visit the museum's website for information on exhibitions, events, classes and films.\n\nRead more about The Honolulu Museum of Art →\n\nPhoto courtesy of IslandLeigh/iStock\n\nIn the 19th century, British sailors mistook crystals in the soil of this extinct volcanic crater for diamonds, thus the now internally known name, Diamond Head.

It's also one of Oahu's most popular hikes, and with its paved path and stairs, the 1.6 mile trail is relatively easy. And the views at the top don't disappoint. At the summit, you can see the shoreline of southeastern Oahu from Koko Head to Waianae, and in the winter, you may even be able to see breaching humpback whales in the distance.\n\nRecommended for Best Attractions & Activities because: Sure, it's a popular hike, but the views at the top make it worth it.\n\nTiffany Hill's expert tip: You'll want to take a lot of photos of these panoramic vistas.\n\nRead more about Diamond Head State Monument →\n\nPhoto courtesy of toooooool\n\nThere's a reason why President Obama and the first family vacation in Kailua each winter.
