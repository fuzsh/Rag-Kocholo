        "text": "Lot 3178. A bronze ritual wine vessel, gu, Shang dynasty, 13th-12th century BC; 11 5/8 in. (30 cm.) high. Estimate $20,000 - $30,000. Price realised $62,500. © Christie's Image Ltd 2015\n\nThe trumpet-shaped neck is flat-cast with four upright blades rising from a band of four snakes, and the middle section and spreading foot with taotie masks divided and separated by narrow notched flanges, those on the foot below pairs of confronted birds, all on a leiwen ground and filled with leiwen. A single graph is cast on the interior of the foot. The bronze has a mottled green patina.\n\nProvenance: Anna Charlotte Rice Cooke (1853-1934) Collection, Hawaii, prior to 1934, and thence by decent within the family.\n\nNote: The graph on the interior of the foot shows a human figure in profile, with prominent foot and hand reaching towards an implement, possibly a baton. The figure in profile may represent fu (father), and the implement he reaches for may identify his family name.\n\nThis gu is associated with the 'mature' style of gu from Anyang (late 13th to early 12th century BC), which all exhibit the same distinctive structure and the same decorative sequence of motifs. Compare the similar gu from the Sze Yuan Tang Archaic Bronzes, and formerly in The Mount Trust Collection, sold at Christie’s New York, 16 September 2010, lot 803.\n\nLot 3179. A bronze ritual wine vessel, gu, Shang dynasty, 13th-12th century BC; 11 7/8 in. (30.1 cm.) high. Estimate $10,000 - USD 15,000. Price realised $60,000. © Christie's Image Ltd 2015.\n\nThe vessel is of slender silhouette, and the tall trumpet-shaped neck is cast with four cicada blades filled with leiwen and pairs of eyes that rise from a band of four flower-like motifs with central 'eye', the middle section and the spreading foot are cast with notched flanges that divide and separate taotie masks, those on the foot below pairs of confronted birds. The bronze has a mottled patina.\n\nProvenance: Anna Charlotte Rice Cooke (1853-1934) Collection, Hawaii, prior to 1934, and thence by decent within the family.\n\nNote: The unusual flower-like motifs in the band at the base of the neck are also seen at the base of the neck of a bronze zun, dated 12th-11th century BC, illustrated by Robert W. Bagley in Shang Ritual Bronzes in the Arthur M. Sackler Collections, The Arthur M. Sackler Foundation, Washington DC, 1987, pp. 284-5, no. 47. The author notes, p. 286, that this motif is found as early as the Erligang phase stamped on white pottery vessels, a shard of which is illustrated with other shards, p. 131, fig. 199."
