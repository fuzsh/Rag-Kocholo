        "text": "Writers Notes: I know! I haven't spoken in so long Hi everyone! But if you have already read this series I understand skip away, But a little fun fact this series was actually meant for Romulus I wrote it for him but I got worried no one would know who he was and therefore not read it so I gave the series to Thomas instead but you know what it was meant for Romulus he can have it.\n\nPart 1:\n\nI sat, My back straight, My mind clear. My feet barely touched the marble floor, My hands barely reached the rests of the throne I sat upon. My advisers around me, soldiers surrounded me, the men, women, and children of the city all here to ask favours of the crown. I rarely spoke, I barely moved, The decisions were made for me but I was far too used to it to mind.\n\n\"My King,\" A Man bowed as he approached I nodded to him\n\n\"Speak your business\" The adviser snapped beside me\n\n\"It's the farm sir, barbarians have been raiding in the fields day and night Please I beg of you to spare but one soldier to protect the border of our lands, my farm, my home, my wife and children\"\n\n\"No Soldier's can be spared outside of city limits\" The adviser snapped\n\n\"I'm sure we can spare one,\" I said looking up to him, he didn't seem happy but nodded\n\n\"Of course my king. One. and no more\"\n\n\"Thank you my king\" He nodded before heading off\n\nI felt the glares of the staff around me so I stayed quiet until the people had all left\n\n\"An Excellent day my king\" My adviser smiled at me\n\n\"I barely did anything\"\n\n\"You did everything my king. Just appearing in person brings light into the presents lives\" He says\n\n\"They didn't seem happy to see me\"\n\n\"Of course they were,\" He says kneeling in front of me \"They adore you, they worship you, they would lay down their lives for you if you were to command it.\" he explained \"and you own them. execute with a click of your fingers, exclie with but a flick of your eyes, the people would lay down their lives to protect you, The soldiers would fall on there swords if you where to ask it of them, anything you want, you ask, or you think will be done. You are the king.\"\n\n\"Sometimes I don't feel like the king.\"\n\n\"You will. In time\" He says but as he got up I heard a strange noise from outside the room clattering and yelling \"What's happening out there?\" He shouted I got up confused about what was going on until the soldiers brought a girl in, she wore an old moth-eaten dress, she looked as old as me, her hair dirty, her skin muddy, she was barefoot, the soldiers dragged her in holding her arms tightly, even if she screamed and tried to fight with them.\n\n\"Let me go!\" she screamed\n\n\"Who are you?\" He asked her\n\n\"Let me go\" she yelled again\n\n\"Barbarian slave daughter.\" The soldier said \"she was trying to escape the palace kitchens\"\n\n\"So she's a slave girl.\" He says \"... You wanted to feel more like the king, You may execute her\"\n\n\"what?\" I asked in shock\n\n\"All slaves who run from their masters are executed,\" He said \"It's the law.\" He says handing me a sword \"as a palace kitchen worker, she is yours. You can have the pleasure of executing her\"\n\nI stared at the sword in my hand seeing my own reflection in it's blade, the sword felt heavy, too heavy for me. The men threw her onto the marble floor scraping her knees as she was thrown close to me"
