        "text": "The Last Legion is an intriguing fantasy film based on a novel, which holds the same name, by Valerio Massimo. The movie is based on events from the Fifth Century that tie the last Roman Emperor and the fall of Rome, into the legends of the Ninth Legion and King Arthur. The movie is somewhat based off of historical facts and makes a slightly plausible story line; however, the further someone would look into history, the more they would find the movie to be Hollywood fantasy. In the first paragraph, descriptions of the cinemas’ account of Romulus Augustus becoming Emperor of Rome, the fall of Rome to the Goths, and then the exile of Romulus compared to the historical account will be found. Next, The Roman’s journey to Britain and their encounter …show more content…\n\nRomulus is sent to the island of Capri where he discovers a hidden chamber within the villa. After going in, he comes across a statue of Caesar holding the fabled sword; which was forged by a Chalybian blacksmith after his military campaigns in Britain. The statue had writing near its feet proclaiming the sword was made only for who is destined to rule, which is then interpreted as a prophecy by various characters, and Romulus keeps the weapon. They are rescued from Capri by the loyal Aurelius and three surviving legionaries.

The Goths follow Romulus and enlist the help of a local Warlord called Vortgyn, who decided to either capture or kill Romulus as a gesture to Odoacer. Aurelius decides to lead an army made up of some of the Ninth that were willing to fight at Hadrian's Wall, to face Vortgyn's armies in one final battle. The battle appears hopeless until the rest of the Ninth Legion wearing their old Roman uniforms and arms appear and turn the tide of battle. Romulus kills Wulfila with Caesar's sword, avenging his parent’s death. Repulsed by the deaths in the battle, Romulus heaves away his sword which remarkably pierces a large rock and it becomes lodged there. Many years later Ambrosinus, who is known by his Druid name Merlin, takes a walk with a young boy to the battlefield to"
