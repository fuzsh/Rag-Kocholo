Told to make peace, Benny winds up giving the volatile Artie a hand with his tomato sauce. Meanwhile, Christopher and Little Carmine take a wild trip to L.A. to pursue Sir Ben Kingsley to star in 'Cleaver,' and enjoy a 'swag grab' at Lauren Bacall's expense.\n\nJoseph, Pt. 2\n\nPART 2: Joseph, sold into slavery by his brothers, uses his gift for divining dreams to rise from a slave to Pharaoh's most trusted aide, saving Egypt from seven years of famine. When his jealous brothers travel to Egypt in search of sanctuary, Joseph struggles with forgiveness before finally declaring \"forgiveness is greater than vengeance, compassion more powerful than anger.\" (Cast: Paul Mercurio, Ben Kingsley, Alice Krige)\n\nJoseph, Pt. 1\n\nPART 1: Joseph, sold into slavery by his brothers, uses his gift for divining dreams to rise from a slave to Pharaoh's most trusted aide, saving Egypt from seven years of famine. When his jealous brothers travel to Egypt in search of sanctuary, Joseph struggles with forgiveness before finally declaring \"forgiveness is greater than vengeance, compassion more powerful than anger.\" (Cast: Paul Mercurio, Ben Kingsley, Alice Krige)\n\nMoses, Pt. 1\n\nPART 1: Faith in God. Escape from slavery. The two great themes from the Old Testament book of Exodus are given thrilling new life in this recreation of how Moses led the children of Israel from bondage in Egypt to freedom in the Promised Land. Moses' story is told in all the glory and spectacle: his childhood in Pharaoh's court, God's voice from the burning bush, the dreadful plagues, the parting of the Red Sea, the bestowing of the Ten Commandments, and the long-awaited return to Canaan. (Cast: Ben Kingsley, Frank Langella, Christopher Lee)"
