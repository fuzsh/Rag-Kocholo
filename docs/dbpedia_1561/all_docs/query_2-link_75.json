        "text": "When did Virgin Australia start operating?\n\nVirgin Australia Virgin Australia, the trading name of Virgin Australia Airlines Pty Ltd, is an Australian-based airline. It is the largest airline by fleet size to use the Virgin brand. It commenced services on 31 August 2000 as Virgin Blue, with two aircraft on a single route. It suddenly found itself as a major airline in Australia's domestic market after the collapse of Ansett Australia in September 2001. The airline has since grown to directly serve 32 cities in Australia, from hubs in Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney. Aviation in Australia Virgin Australia was launched as Virgin Blue in August 2000. The timing of Virgin Blue's entry into the Australian market was fortuitous as it was able to fill the vacuum created by the collapse of Ansett Australia in September 2001. In the following years, Virgin Australia became a challenger to Qantas. Both companies launched low-cost subsidiaries: Qantas formed Jetstar in 2003 and Virgin acquired Tigerair Australia in 2013. Virgin Australia Holdings Virgin Australia Holdings Limited is the holding company that owns and operates Virgin Australia, Virgin Australia International Airlines and Virgin Australia Regional Airlines. It previously operated Pacific Blue Airlines, Tigerair Australia and joint-venture airline Polynesian Blue which were absorbed into Virgin Australia in December 2011. Its head office is located in South Bank, Brisbane. After being placed in administration in April 2020, it was purchased by Bain Capital in August 2020. Virgin Australia Airlines (NZ) Virgin Australia Airlines (NZ) Limited formerly Pacific Blue Airlines (NZ) Limited, was an airline based in New Zealand. It was established as the New Zealand subsidiary of Australian airline Virgin Blue (now Virgin Australia). It was a fully owned subsidiary of Virgin Australia Holdings. It was renamed Virgin Australia Airlines (NZ) Ltd in December 2011 when its parent company decided to bring all its airlines under the one banner. Virgin Australia On 4 May 2011, the former Virgin Blue revealed its new name, Virgin Australia, as well as its new livery. In addition to the new name, branding and livery, the airline also showed off its new flagship the Airbus A330 with new domestic business class. Boeing 737 business class seating was also revealed, to be introduced on all of Virgin's jet aircraft by the end of 2011. Pacific Blue and V Australia were both folded into the new Virgin Australia brand, following an agreement with former Virgin Atlantic shareholder Singapore Airlines, which ever since the establishment of Virgin Blue in 2000 had previously prohibited use of the Virgin brand outside Australia. Virgin Australia Virgin Australia was launched as Virgin Blue, as a low-cost airline in August 2000, with two Boeing 737-400 aircraft, one of which was leased from then-sister airline Virgin Express. Initially offering seven return flights a day between Brisbane and Sydney, this was expanded to cover all major Australian cities and many holiday destinations. The Virgin Blue name was the result of an open competition; it was a play on the predominantly red livery and the Australian slang tradition of calling a red-headed male 'Blue' or 'Bluey'. V Australia V Australia was a long-haul international airline owned by Virgin Australia Holdings that commenced operating on 27 February 2009. As part of a rebranding of all of Virgin Australia Holdings' subsidiaries, on 7 December 2011 it was subsumed into Virgin Australia. Virgin Australia Regional Airlines Virgin Australia Regional Airlines is an Australian regional airline based in Perth, servicing key towns in the state of Western Australia. The airline also flies interstate to destinations such as Adelaide, Darwin, Melbourne and Alice Springs. Formerly known as Skywest, in April 2013 the airline was purchased by Virgin Australia Holdings as its new regional offshoot. On 21 April 2020, Virgin Australia Regional Airlines' parent company, Virgin Australia Holdings went into voluntary administration due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Virgin Australia The airline launched flights between Sydney and Los Angeles in 2009, followed by flights from Melbourne and Brisbane after obtaining permission to operate an unlimited number of flights between Australia and the U.S. by the Australian International Air Services Commission. V Australia also applied to the United States Department of Transportation to operate services to San Francisco, Seattle, Las Vegas, and New York, but these plans never materialised. V Australia later launched flights to Nadi International Airport, Phuket and Johannesburg (all of which were discontinued prior to the brand being absorbed into Virgin Australia, although Virgin Australia continued to operate to Phuket until 2015, and to Nadi), and Abu Dhabi to consolidate Virgin Blue's codeshare agreement with Etihad Airways. Virgin Australia In December 2006, Virgin Australia (as Virgin Blue) announced a partnership between Australian cable television providers Foxtel and Austar, to introduce a Live2Air service on most flights by mid-2007. The Live2Air system was only available on selected Boeing 737 aircraft, and was phased out beginning in 2012.\n\nVirgin Australia commenced services on 31 August 2000 as Virgin Blue, with two aircraft on a single route.\n\nclosed_qa\n\nWhich is a species of fish? Tope or Rope\n\nElops saurus The ladyfish or tenpounder (Elops saurus) is a species of fish in the genus Elops, the only genus in the monotypic family Elopidae. Largescale mullet The largescale mullet (Planiliza macrolepis) is a species of fish in the family Mugilidae. It is found in the Indo-Pacific. Hornlip mullet The hornlip mullet (Plicomugil labiosus) is a species of fish in the mullet family from the Indo-Pacific from the Red Sea to Micronesia. It is the only species in the monospecific genus Plicomugil. Slender seahorse The slender seahorse or longsnout seahorse (Hippocampus reidi) is a species of fish in the family Syngnathidae that usually inhabits subtropical regions. Professional wrestling aerial techniques A topé (from the original Spanish tope, meaning headbutt), like the plancha, is a move most often performed by jumping from the inside of the ring and out, but instead of going over the top rope, the topé is performed by leaping forward through the ropes in order to strike the opponent with the head. In Mexico, topé also refers to any variation of a battering ram. Saddled seabream The saddled seabream (Oblada melanura), also called the saddle bream or oblade, is a species of fish of the family Sparidae. It is monotypic in the genus Oblada. Ayu sweetfish The ayu sweetfish (Plecoglossus altivelis), or sweetfish, is a species of fish. It is the only species in the genus Plecoglossus and family Plecoglossidae. It is a relative of the smelts and other fish in the order Osmeriformes. Symphurus pusillus The northern tonguefish (Symphurus pusillus) is a species of fish belonging to the family Cynoglossidae. Transparent blue-eye The transparent blue-eye (Pseudomugil pellucidus) is a species of fish in the subfamily Pseudomugilinae. It is found in Irian Jaya in New Guinea.This species reaches a length of . Zebra seahorse The zebra seahorse (Hippocampus zebra) is a species of fish in the family Syngnathidae. It is endemic to northern Australia.\n\nTope\n\nclassification\n\nWhy can camels survive for long without water?\n\nCamel Most camels surviving today are domesticated. Although feral populations exist in Australia, India and Kazakhstan, wild camels survive only in the wild Bactrian camel population of the Gobi Desert. Camelops Plant remains found in the teeth of the Rancho La Brea C. hesternus fossils further reveal that rather than being limited to grazing, this species likely ate mixed species of plants, including coarse shrubs growing in coastal southern California. Camelops probably could travel long distances, similar to modern camel species. Whether or not Camelops could survive for long periods without water, as with extant camels, is still unknown; this may have been an adaptation that occurred much later, after camelids migrated to Asia and Africa. Sechuran fox It is also thought that the Sechuran fox may have an ability to survive without water for lengthy periods, as suggested by the sparse water availability in its usual habitats. Among mammals, this is not a common ability. A specific duration they can survive without water has not been featured in the literature as of yet, as this requires more studies to confirm. Nilgai The nilgai is a browser or mixed feeder, but primarily a grazer in Texas. It prefers grasses and herbs, but also feeds on woody plants in the dry tropical forests of India. Diets generally suffice in protein and fats. The protein content of the nilgai's should be at least seven percent. The nilgai can survive for long periods without water and does not drink regularly even in summer. National Research Centre on Camels, Bikaner Camels are fondly called the Ships of the Desert because of their utility in arid climate. They can live without water for many days. They provide alternative means of goods transportation in many districts of Rajasthan, which, in turn, saves fuel and also provides livelihood to many camel herders. The Thar Desert is filled with glorious palaces, natural marvels and, of course, camels which adds to the tourism sector. Agglomerated food powder Dry agglomeration is agglomeration performed without water or binding liquids, instead using compression only. Pompeo Colonna Pope Adrian VI, however, did not survive long. He grew increasingly incapacitated, and succumbed to kidney disease on 14 September 1523. He had reigned for one year, eight months, and six days. Gyula Germanus In the course of his journeys he was the first European to pass through the Wadi Djadak and Ghureir. On the testing 28-day trip the caravan ran out of food and water. They had to eat the camels. After three days without water Germanus lost consciousness. His companions thought that his life was already beyond hope, but his faithful Arab friend was intractable and did not allow the others to leave the European traveller in the desert, or to kill his camel. Nan Bangs McKinnell Nan and Jim spent much of their married life traveling and creating together. The two are remembered as artistic partners with most of their work having been made collaboratively. The two traveled across America and the world, working at colleges and artist's colonies while developing their craft. In 1953, Nan and James attended a ceramics workshop at the Archie Bray Foundation and decided to stay and work there for several years. It was at the Bray where Nan began developing glazes. Nan's deep copper glaze is still widely used today. Her glaze-making also opened up an appreciation for the decorative side of ceramics. As Nan and Jim began working more collaboratively, Nan's decorative eye came out more. In their process, often one would throw a piece on the wheel and the other would decorate it, combining their two separate artistic eyes and influences. Nan was drawn to natural shapes and forms, drawing on flowers, leaves, insects, and other animals. Wild Bactrian camel Like its close relative, the domesticated Bactrian camel, it is one of the few mammals able to eat snow to provide itself with liquids in the winter. While the legend that camels store water in their humps is a misconception, they are adapted to conserve water. However, long periods without water will result in a deterioration of the animal's health.\n\nCamels use the fat in their humps to keep them filled with energy and hydration for long periods of time.\n\nopen_qa\n\nAlice's parents have three daughters: Amy, Jessy, and what’s the name of the third daughter?\n\nVillikins and his Dinah In Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll, Alice's fictional cat Dinah is based on one of two real kittens, Willikins and Dinah, owned by Alice's namesake Alice Liddell and her brother Henry.

Erling Vidkunsson Many of Norway's highest nobles for the next three centuries would be descended from Erling Vidkunsson. Vidkunsson's only son Bjarne Erlingsson predeceased him. His inheritance was left to his daughters, of whom Ingeborg Erlingsdottir, who married Sigurd Havtoreson (1315-1392) received Giske. Gyrid Erlingsdottir married Eiliv Eilivsson of Naustdalsætten (Old Norse Naustdalr). It has been speculated that a third daughter, Gjertrud, married Otte Rømer, but this has not been established with certainty, as the surviving sources does not name the parents or patronym of Rømer's wife. The God of Animals The God of Animals refers to Alice's questioning of whether or not a god exists. Mr. Delmar, Alice's 7th grade English teacher, discusses religion with Alice during one of their many nightly conversations about life. While both Alice and Mr. Delmar state that they do not believe in God, Alice believes there should be a God to watch over animals.

Stalemate results in a draw. During the endgame, stalemate is a resource that can enable the player with the inferior position to draw the game rather than lose. In more complex positions, stalemate is much rarer, usually taking the form of a swindle that succeeds only if the superior side is inattentive. Stalemate is also a common theme in endgame studies and other chess problems. Stalemate The outcome of a stalemate was standardized as a draw in the 19th century. Before this standardization, its treatment varied widely, including being deemed a win for the stalemating player, a half-win for that player, or a loss for that player; not being permitted; and resulting in the stalemated player missing a turn. Stalemate rules vary in other games of the chess family. Stalemate Not all variants of chess consider the stalemate to be a draw. Many regional variants, as well some variants of Western chess, have adopted their own rules on how to treat the stalemated player. In chaturanga, which is widely considered to be the common ancestor of all variants of chess, a stalemate was a win for the stalemated player. Around the 7th century, this game was adopted in the Middle East as shatranj with very similar rules to its predecessor; however, the stalemate rule was changed to its exact opposite: i.e. it was a win for the player delivering the stalemate. This game was in turn introduced to the western world, where it would eventually evolve to modern-day (Western) chess, although the stalemate rule for Western chess was not standardised as a draw until the 19th century (see history of the rule). Hexagonal chess Stalemate is not a draw in Gliński's chess, but is still counted less than checkmate. In tournament games, the player who delivers stalemate earns point, and the stalemated player (the player without a legal move) receives point. Stalemate Periodically, writers have argued that stalemate should again be made a win for the side causing the stalemate. Grandmaster Larry Kaufman writes, In my view, calling stalemate a draw is totally illogical, since it represents the ultimate zugzwang, where any move would get your king taken. The British master T. H. Tylor argued in a 1940 article in the British Chess Magazine that the present rule, treating stalemate as a draw, is without historical foundation and irrational, and primarily responsible for a vast percentage of draws, and hence should be abolished. Years later, Fred Reinfeld wrote, When Tylor wrote his attack on the stalemate rule, he released about his unhappy head a swarm of peevish maledictions that are still buzzing. Larry Evans calls the proposal to make stalemate a win for the stalemating player a crude proposal that ... would radically alter centuries of tradition and make chess boring. This rule change would cause a greater emphasis on ; an extra pawn would be a greater advantage than it is today. Stalemate The stalemate rule has had a convoluted history. Although stalemate is universally recognized as a draw today, that has not been the case for much of the game's history. In the forerunners to modern chess, such as chaturanga, delivering stalemate resulted in a loss. However, this was changed in shatranj, where stalemating was a win. This practice persisted in chess as played in early 15th-century Spain. However, Lucena (c. 1497) treated stalemate as an inferior form of victory; it won only half the stake in games played for money, and this continued to be the case in Spain as late as 1600. From about 1600 to 1800, the rule in England was that stalemate was a loss for the player administering it, a rule that the eminent chess historian H. J. R. Murray believes may have been adopted from Russian chess. That rule disappeared in England before 1820, being replaced by the French and Italian rule that a stalemate was a drawn game. Stalemate The term stalemate is sometimes used incorrectly as a generic term for a draw in chess. While draws are common, they are rarely the direct result of stalemate. Losing chess Implementations of the main variant can vary in regard to stalemate. International rules are as described above, with the stalemated player winning even if that player still has pieces on the board. FICS rules resolve stalemate as a win for the player with the fewer number of pieces remaining; if both have the same number, it is a draw (the piece types are irrelevant). Joint FICS/International rules resolves stalemate as a draw unless it is a victory for the same player under both rulesets. The stalemate in the diagram is a win for White under International rules, a win for Black under FICS rules, and a draw under joint rules. Swindle (chess) One classic way of saving a draw in a losing position is by stalemate. Almost every master has at some point spoiled a won game by falling into a stalemate trap. The defender often achieves the stalemate by sacrificing all of his or her remaining mobile pieces, with check, in such a way that they must be captured, leaving the defender with only a king (and sometimes also pawns and/or pieces) with no legal moves. Janggi In Western chess, stalemate is achieved when no legal moves are possible. However, the stalemate is not a draw in janggi. The player must pass their turn when no legal moves are possible. If neither player can move legally, or if neither player can win because neither player has enough pieces, the game ends in a draw.\n\nNo. Stalemate is a drawn position. It doesn't matter who has captured more pieces or is in a winning position\n\ninformation_extraction\n\nGiven a reference text about Lollapalooza, where does it take place, who started it and what is it?\n\nLollapalooza Lollapalooza (Lolla) is an annual American four-day music festival held in Grant Park in Chicago. It originally started as a touring event in 1991 but several years later made Chicago the permanent location for the annual music festival. Music genres include but are not limited to alternative rock, heavy metal, punk rock, hip hop, and electronic dance music. Lollapalooza has also featured visual arts, nonprofit organizations, and political organizations. The festival, held in Grant Park, hosts an estimated 400,000 people each July and sells out annually. Lollapalooza is one of the largest and most iconic music festivals in the world and one of the longest-running in the United States. Lollapalooza Lollapalooza was conceived and created in 1991 as a farewell tour by Perry Farrell, singer of the group Jane's Addiction. The first Lollapalooza tour had a diverse collection of bands and was a commercial success. It stopped in more than twenty cities in North America. In 2020, Spin rated the first Lollapalooza as the best concert on a list of The 35 Greatest Concerts of the Last 35 Years. Lollapalooza then ran annually until 1997, and was revived in 2003. From its inception through 1997 and its revival in 2003, the festival toured North America. In 2004, the organizers decided to expand the dates to two days per city, but poor ticket sales forced the 2004 tour to be cancelled. Lollapalooza Chile The annual festival launched in April 2011 in Santiago’s O'Higgins Park and features alternative rock, heavy metal, punk rock and hip-hop bands from both Chile and abroad. It was the first edition of Lollapalooza to take place outside of the United States and was followed by the launch of Lollapalooza Brazil in São Paulo in 2012. Lollapalooza Chile has been held in Santiago since 2011. It's managed by Chilean production company Lotus Productions in partnership with Lollapalooza founder and Jane's Addiction frontman Perry Farrell, and drew crowds of approximately 100,000 in 2011 and 115,000 in 2012. Lollapalooza Unlike previous festivals such as Woodstock, A Gathering of the Tribes, and the US Festival, which were one-time events held at single venues, Lollapalooza toured across the United States and Canada from mid-July until late August 1991. The inaugural Lollapalooza lineup was diverse and made up of artists from alternative rock (such as Siouxsie and the Banshees who were the second headliners), industrial music (such as Nine Inch Nails), and rap (Ice-T rapped and used the platform to launch Body Count, his heavy metal band). The premiere in Phoenix, Arizona, on July 18, 1991, was covered by a report on MTV, which ended by journalist Dave Kendall saying Lollapalooza could be the tour of the summer; the tour finished off in Seattle on August 28, 1991. Lollapalooza On November 4, 2014, it was announced that the very first European Lollapalooza would be held in the German capital of Berlin. It was scheduled for September 12–13, 2015, and the proposed location was the historical airport grounds of Berlin-Tempelhof. In the official press release, festival founder Perry Farrell stated that, Berlin's energy, vibrant art, fashion and music scenes are a mirror reflection of what Lollapalooza is all about and I can't wait to share in this cultural exchange. Lollapalooza Germany was produced by the Lollapalooza U.S. team, in addition to Melt! Booking and Festival Republic, who have helped run both Reading and Leeds festivals in England. The 2016 edition of the event took place in the Treptower Park in Berlin, on September 10–11. It drew 70,000 visitors each day. Lollapalooza In 2003, Farrell reconvened Jane's Addiction and scheduled a new Lollapalooza tour. The festival schedule included venues in thirty cities through July and August. The 2003 tour achieved only marginal success, with many fans staying away, presumably because of high ticket prices. Another tour scheduled for 2004 was to consist of a two-day festival taking place in each city. Despite a bill with Morrissey, Sonic Youth, PJ Harvey, Pixies, and the Flaming Lips as headliners, the 2004 edition was cancelled in June due to weak ticket sales across the country. In 2005, Farrell partnered with Capital Sports & Entertainment (now C3 Presents), which co-owns and produces the Austin City Limits Music Festival, to produce Lollapalooza. CSE, Farrell, and the William Morris Agency—along with Charles Attal Presents—resurrected Lollapalooza as a two-day destination festival in 2005 in Chicago's Grant Park, with an even greater variety of performers (70 acts on five stages) than that of the touring festival. The event was generally successful, attracting over 65,000 attendees, despite a 104-degree Fahrenheit Sunday (40 degrees Celsius) heat wave (two people were hospitalized for heat-related illness). Perry Farrell Perry Farrell (born Peretz Bernstein; March 29, 1959) is an American singer, songwriter and musician, best known as the frontman of the alternative rock band Jane's Addiction. Farrell created the touring festival Lollapalooza as part (one of the venues) of a farewell tour for Jane's Addiction in 1991; it has since evolved into an annual destination festival. Farrell continues to produce Lollapalooza with partners William Morris Agency and C3 Presents. Farrell has also led the alternative rock groups Porno for Pyros and Satellite Party. Lollapalooza Inspired by events such as Britain's Reading Festival—which Lollapalooza cofounder Perry Farrell had been due to play in 1990—Farrell, Ted Gardner, Don Muller, and Marc Geiger conceived the festival in 1990 as a farewell for Farrell's band Jane's Addiction. O'Higgins Park In November 2010, musician and Lollapalooza founder Perry Farrell announced that the first overseas version of the rock festival would take place in O’Higgins Park, Santiago. The inaugural Lollapalooza Chile took place on 2–3 April 2011 and drew a crowd of about 100,000, with venues including the park's Movistar Arena, La Elipse, and La Cupula Theater. Lollapalooza Chile has returned annually since then, most recently on 16–18 March 2018.

The two are remembered as artistic partners with most of their work having been made collaboratively. The two traveled across America and the world, working at colleges and artist's colonies while developing their craft. In 1953, Nan and James attended a ceramics workshop at the Archie Bray Foundation and decided to stay and work there for several years. It was at the Bray where Nan began developing glazes. Nan's deep copper glaze is still widely used today. Her glaze-making also opened up an appreciation for the decorative side of ceramics. As Nan and Jim began working more collaboratively, Nan's decorative eye came out more. In their process, often one would throw a piece on the wheel and the other would decorate it, combining their two separate artistic eyes and influences. Nan was drawn to natural shapes and forms, drawing on flowers, leaves, insects, and other animals.

Holden (automobile) The Holden HQ is yet another heavily Chevrolet inspired design, sharing likeness with the Camaro and Chevelle. The HQ was the last Holden model to feauture a Chevrolet Small Block V8 until the introduction of the Series II VT Commodore in 1999. With the HQ Monaro came the LS, a variant similar to the sedan and wagon's Premier specification. The HQ Monaro could be a lot more luxury focused, without the looming effect of homologation, as Holden's motorsport teams turned towards the smaller Torana. New York State Route 153 NY 253 was truncated southward at some point in the latter half of the 1980s to end at NY 65 in the town of Pittsford. The portion of NY 253's former routing from NY 96 (North Main Street) in Pittsford to NY 441 in Penfield was redesignated as NY 153. For many years, signs along NY 153 were holdovers from the NY 253 designation, as evidenced by covered numbers on multiple shields and reference markers along the highway. Nan Qi (artist) Nan is a contemporary Chinese ink painter depicting a variety of themes, ranging from the human form to landscapes and abstract concentric ink dots, using Chinese in and xuan rice paper. During his training as a Chinese ink painter, Nan specialised in classical landscapes inspired by Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasty artists. Early experimentation with different brush strokes and techniques, varying the dilution of ink and wash, resulted in the distinctive ink “dabs” produced in his early works. During the mid-to-late 1990s, Nan began designing and printing the catalogues for his own exhibitions, and was inspired by the dot matrices used in printing. This gave rise to a progression from ink “dabs” to more and more dot-like brush strokes, culminating in his development of his signature “halo dot” brush stroke in 2004. At this point, the themes and content of Nan’s work were becoming solidly contemporary and modern, moving away from landscapes. Over the next ten years, Nan developed a completely unique repertoire of brush strokes and ink painting techniques, including the “halo dot”, the “Nan Qi Way” for controlling ink flow into highly absorbent rice paper, and the “3D ink” technique, which allows him to create three-dimensional optical illusions by hand. Nan Bangs McKinnell In Seattle, Nan began working as a teacher once again, earning money to help support her family back in Nebraska. It wasn't long until Nan was applying for graduate school, and after a few years in Seattle, she was taking summer classes at the University of Washington where she started her art. While the men were away at war, Nan began teaching in an architectural drawing and design classes at the University. As she continued her own studies, Nan realized that painting and design were not her forte and took an introductory class in ceramic engineering and was drawn to clay as an artistic medium.

Brainstorming Individual brainstorming is the use of brainstorming in solitary situations. It typically includes such techniques as free writing, free speaking, word association, and drawing a mind map, which is a visual note taking technique in which people diagram their thoughts. Individual brainstorming is a useful method in creative writing and has been shown to be superior to traditional group brainstorming.

Brainstorming Groups can improve the effectiveness and quality of their brainstorming sessions in a number of ways. Brainstorming According to a meta-analysis comparing EBS to face-to-face brainstorming conducted by DeRosa and colleagues, EBS has been found to enhance both the production of non-redundant ideas and the quality of ideas produced. Despite the advantages demonstrated by EBS groups, EBS group members reported less satisfaction with the brainstorming process compared to face-to-face brainstorming group members. Computer supported brainstorming In computer supported brainstorming, team members contribute their ideas through electronic means either synchronously or asynchronously. The brainstorming software selected by the team mediates the individual interactions and helps to organize and shape the products of the brainstorming session. Computer supported brainstorming can be implemented using a wide variety of electronic technologies. Brainstorming Following these two principles were his four general rules of brainstorming, established with intention to: Brainstorming Directed brainstorming is a variation of electronic brainstorming (described below). It can be done manually or with computers. Directed brainstorming works when the solution space (that is, the set of criteria for evaluating a good idea) is known prior to the session. If known, those criteria can be used to constrain the ideation process intentionally. Brainstorming software Brainstorming software is computer software that is used for the development of creative ideas—brainstorming. Some formats or structures for this include flow charts, idea maps, word association and generative idea creation programs. Ideation is often associated with brainstorming software. Some of the earliest brainstorming software programs included Paramind and programs using Markov chains called Markov text generators.\n\nWe are always engaged one phone which is not good.\n\nbrainstorming\n\nWho was John Moses Browning?\n\nJohn Browning Browning influenced nearly all categories of firearms design, especially the autoloading of ammunition. He invented, or made significant improvements to, single-shot, lever-action, and pump-action rifles and shotguns. He developed the first reliable and compact autoloading pistols by inventing the telescoping bolt, then integrating the bolt and barrel shroud into what is known as the pistol slide. Browning's telescoping bolt design is now found on nearly every modern semi-automatic pistol, as well as several modern fully automatic weapons. He also developed the first gas-operated firearm, the Colt–Browning Model 1895 machine gun a system that surpassed mechanical recoil operation to become the standard for most high-power self-loading firearm designs worldwide. He also made significant contributions to automatic cannon development. John Browning John Moses Browning (January 23, 1855 – November 26, 1926) was an American firearm designer who developed many varieties of military and civilian firearms, cartridges, and gun mechanisms many of which are still in use around the world. He made his first firearm at age 13 in his father's gun shop and was awarded the first of his 128 firearm patents on October 7, 1879, at the age of 24. He is regarded as one of the most successful firearms designers of the 19th and 20th centuries and pioneered the development of modern repeating, semi-automatic, and automatic firearms. John Browning Browning's most successful designs include the M1911 pistol, the water-cooled M1917, the air-cooled M1919, and heavy M2 machine guns, the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle, and the Browning Auto-5 the first semi-automatic shotgun. Some of these arms are still manufactured, often with only minor changes in detail and cosmetics to those assembled by Browning or his licensees. The Browning-designed M1911, and Hi-Power, are some of the most copied firearms in the world. Browning Superposed It was the last firearm to be designed by John Browning. After Browning's death, the design work was completed by his son Val A. Browning. Semi-automatic firearm In 1902, American gunsmith John Moses Browning developed the first successful semi-automatic shotgun, the Browning Auto-5, which was first manufactured by Fabrique Nationale de Herstal and sold in America under the Browning name. The Auto-5 relied on long recoil operation; this design remained the dominant form in semi-automatic shotguns for approximately 50 years. Production of the Auto-5 ended in 1999. John Browning Throughout his life, Browning designed a vast array of military and civilian small arms for his own company, as well as for Winchester, Colt, Remington, Savage, Stevens, and Fabrique Nationale de Herstal of Belgium. Browning firearms have been made, both licensed and unlicensed, by hundreds of factories around the world. Browning Arms Company was established in 1927, the year after Browning's death on November 26, 1926, in Liège, Belgium. In 1977, FN Herstal acquired the company. M1917 Browning machine gun In 1900, John Moses Browning filed a patent for a recoil-powered automatic gun. Browning did not work on the gun again until 1910, when he built a water-cooled prototype of the 1900 design. Although the gun worked well, Browning improved the design slightly. Browning replaced side ejection with bottom ejection, added a buffer for smoother operation, replaced the hammer with a two piece firing pin, and some other minor improvements. The basic design of the gun was still the 1900 design. The Guns of John Moses Browning Written by former Philadelphia Inquirer author Nathan Gorenstein, The Guns of John Moses Browning details the events of John Browning's life, his inventions, and their historical impact. The book provides information on Browning's designs, as well as relevant aspects of his biography that impacted their creation. It is the first major biography to be published on John Browning.

He was previously the nation's second vice president under John Adams and the first United States secretary of state under George Washington. The principal author of the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson was a proponent of democracy, republicanism, and individual rights, motivating American colonists to break from the Kingdom of Great Britain and form a new nation. He produced formative documents and decisions at state, national, and international levels. Bibliography of Thomas Jefferson Thomas Jefferson (April 13, 1743 – July 4, 1826) was an American Founding Father, the principal author of the Declaration of Independence (1776) and the third president of the United States (1801–1809). He served in the Continental Congress, and as a wartime Governor of Virginia (1779–1781). From mid-1784 Jefferson served as a diplomat, stationed in Paris. In May 1785, he became the United States Minister to France.

She later was reclassified as an attack submarine and redesignated SSN-618. USRC Jefferson (1802) USRC Jefferson was a schooner purchased in 1802 by the United States Revenue Marine and stationed at Norfolk, Virginia where she enforced customs laws. She was named in honor of Founding Father Thomas Jefferson, the principal author of the Declaration of Independence and third President of the United States. Thomas Jefferson: Author of America Thomas Jefferson: Author of America is a short biography of Thomas Jefferson, the third President of the United States (1801–09) and the principal author of the Declaration of Independence (1776), by author, journalist and literary critic Christopher Hitchens. USRC Jefferson (1833) Named for the Founding Father and third President of the United States, Thomas Jefferson, she was the second Morris-Taney class cutter to be named after a President. First inauguration of Thomas Jefferson The first inauguration of Thomas Jefferson as the third president of the United States was held on Wednesday, March 4, 1801. The inauguration marked the commencement of the first four-year term of Thomas Jefferson as president and the only four-year term of Aaron Burr as vice president. Jefferson was sworn in by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall. Science and technology in the United States Thomas Jefferson (1743–1826), was among the most influential leaders in early America; during the American Revolutionary War (1775–83), Jefferson served in the Virginia legislature, the Continental Congress, was governor of Virginia, later serving as U.S. minister to France, U.S. secretary of state, vice president under John Adams (1735–1826), writer of the Declaration of Independence and the third U.S. president. During Jefferson's two terms in office (1801–1809), the U.S. purchased the Louisiana Territory and Lewis and Clark explored the vast new acquisition. After leaving office, he retired to his Virginia plantation, Monticello, and helped spearhead the University of Virginia. Jefferson was also a student of agriculture who introduced various types of rice, olive trees, and grasses into the New World. He stressed the scientific aspect of the Lewis and Clark expedition (1804–06), which explored the Pacific Northwest, and detailed, systematic information on the region's plants and animals was one of that expedition's legacies. Electoral history of John Adams Jefferson would win 73 of the 138 first-round votes cast in the United States Electoral College, while Adams won 65 of the 138 first-round votes cast in the United States Electoral College making Jefferson the third president of the United States (1801–1809), and Burr the third vice-president of the United States (1801–1805). It also made Jefferson the second consecutive president to have previously served as VP and Adams the first U.S. president to only serve one term.\n\nThomas Jefferson (April 13, 1743 – July 4, 1826) was an American statesman, diplomat, lawyer, architect, philosopher, and Founding Father who served as the third president of the United States from 1801 to 1809. Among the Committee of Five charged by the Second Continental Congress with authoring the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson was the Declaration's primary author. Following the American Revolutionary War and prior to becoming the nation's third president in 1801, Jefferson was the first United States secretary of state under George Washington and then the nation's second vice president under John Adams. Among the nation's Founding Fathers, Jefferson is considered unmatched in his intellectual depth and breadth. His passionate writings and advocacy for human rights, including freedom of thought, speech, and religion, were a leading inspiration behind the American Revolution, which ultimately gave rise to the American Revolutionary War, American independence, and the United States Constitution. Jefferson's ideas were globally influential in shaping and inspiring the Age of Enlightenment, which proved transformational in the late 17th and 18th centuries. He was a leading proponent of democracy, republicanism, and individual rights, and produced formative documents and decisions at the state, national, and international levels. During the American Revolution, Jefferson represented Virginia in the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, which adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. As a Virginia legislator, he drafted a state law for religious freedom. He served as the second Governor of Virginia from 1779 to 1781, during the Revolutionary War. In 1785, Jefferson was appointed the United States Minister to France, and subsequently, the nation's first secretary of state under President George Washington from 1790 to 1793. Jefferson and James Madison organized the Democratic-Republican Party to oppose the Federalist Party during the formation of the First Party System. With Madison, he anonymously wrote the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions in 1798 and 1799, which sought to strengthen states' rights by nullifying the federal Alien and Sedition Acts. Jefferson and Federalist John Adams became friends as well as political rivals, serving in the Continental Congress and drafting the Declaration of Independence together. In the 1796 presidential election between the two, Jefferson came in second, which according to electoral procedure at the time, made him vice president to Adams. Jefferson challenged Adams again in 1800 and won the presidency. After his term in office, Jefferson eventually reconciled with Adams and they shared a correspondence that lasted 14 years. He and Adams both died on the same day, July 4, 1826, which was also the 50th anniversary of Declaration of Independence. As president, Jefferson pursued the nation's shipping and trade interests against Barbary pirates and aggressive British trade policies. Starting in 1803, he promoted a western expansionist policy with the Louisiana Purchase, which doubled the nation's claimed land area. To make room for settlement, Jefferson began the process of Indian tribal removal from the newly acquired territory. As a result of peace negotiations with France, his administration reduced military forces. He was re-elected in 1804, but his second term was beset with difficulties at home, including the trial of former vice president Aaron Burr. In 1807, American foreign trade was diminished when Jefferson implemented the Embargo Act in response to British threats to U.S. shipping. The same year, Jefferson signed the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves. Jefferson was a plantation owner, lawyer, and politician, and mastered many disciplines including surveying, mathematics, horticulture, and mechanics. He was also an architect in the Palladian tradition. Jefferson's keen interest in religion and philosophy led to his appointment as president of the American Philosophical Society. He largely shunned organized religion but was influenced by Christianity, Epicureanism, and deism. Jefferson rejected fundamental Christianity, denying Christ's divinity. A philologist, Jefferson knew several languages. He was a prolific letter writer and corresponded with many prominent people, including Edward Carrington, John Taylor of Caroline, and James Madison. In 1785, Jefferson authored Notes on the State of Virginia, considered perhaps the most important American book published before 1800. Jefferson championed the ideals, values, and teachings of the Enlightenment. Since the 1790s, Jefferson was rumored to have had children by his sister-in-law and slave Sally Hemings, leading to what is known as the Jefferson-Hemings controversy. A 1998 DNA test concluded that one of Sally Hemings's children, Eston Hemings, was of the Jefferson male line. According to scholarly consensus, based on documentary and statistical evaluation, as well as oral history, Jefferson probably fathered at least six children with Hemings, including four that survived to adulthood. After retiring from public office, Jefferson founded the University of Virginia. Presidential scholars and historians generally praise Jefferson's public achievements, including his advocacy of religious freedom and tolerance in Virginia, his peaceful acquisition of the Louisiana Territory from France without war or controversy, and his ambitious and successful Lewis and Clark Expedition. Some modern historians are critical of Jefferson's personal involvement with slavery. Jefferson is consistently ranked among the top ten presidents of American history.\n\ninformation_extraction\n\nWho was Kyle Van Zyl playing against when he scored 36 of hisa teams 61 points?\n\nKayle van Zyl Van Zyl joined the Eastern Province Kings Academy, where he played for the side in the 2010 Under-19 Provincial Championship.

List the results in comma separated format.\n\nDar es Salaam Dar es Salaam is Tanzania's most prominent city for arts, fashion, media, film, television, and finance. It is the capital of the co-extensive Dar es Salaam Region, one of Tanzania's 31 administrative regions, and consists of five districts: Kinondoni in the north; Ilala in the centre; Ubungo and Temeke in the south; and Kigamboni in the east across the Kurasini estuary. Dar es Salaam Dar es Salaam (; from ) or commonly known as Dar, is the largest city and financial hub of Tanzania. It is also the capital of Dar es Salaam Region. With a population of over six million people, Dar is the largest city in East Africa and the seventh-largest in Africa. Located on the Swahili coast, Dar es Salaam is an important economic centre and is one of the fastest-growing cities in the world. Dar es Salaam Zoo Dar es Salaam Zoo is a zoological park in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The zoo is located in the Kigamboni-district in the eastern part of the city, from Downtown Dar es Salaam. Dar es Salaam Region Dar es Salaam Region (Mkoa wa Dar es Salaam in Swahili) is one of Tanzania's 31 administrative regions and is located in the east coast of the country. The region covers an area of . The region is comparable in size to the combined land and water areas of the nation state of Mauritius Dar es Salaam Region is bordered to the east by Indian Ocean and its is entirely sorounded by Pwani region. The Pwani districts that border Dar es Salaam region are Bagamoyo District to the north, Kibaha Urban District to the west, Kisarawe District to the south west and Mkuranga District to the south of the region. Dar es Salaam The Dar es Salaam Central Business District is the largest in Tanzania and comprises the Kisutu, Kivukoni, Upanga and Kariakoo areas. The downtown area is located in the Ilala district. Kivukoni is home to the Tanzania Central Bank, The Bank of Tanzania, the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange and the city's important Magogoni fish market. With businesses and offices, Kisutu is the location of Dar es Salaam central railway station, the PSPF Towers, and the TPA Tower. Anglican Diocese of Dar es Salaam At its heart is the city of Dar es Salaam, the cultural and economic capital of Tanzania (the political capital is Dodoma). Dar es Salaam The Port of Dar es Salaam is Tanzania's busiest, handling 90% of the country's cargo. It is located in the Kurasini administrative ward of Temeke District southeast of the city's central business district. Due to a huge influx of cargo and the slow pace of expansion, a new cargo port northwest of Dar es Salaam is proposed at Bagamoyo. Dar es Salaam In the 19th century, Mzizima (Swahili for healthy town) was a coastal fishing village on the periphery of Indian Ocean trade routes. In 1865 or 1866, Sultan Majid bin Said of Zanzibar began building a new city very close to Mzizima and named it Dar es Salaam. The name is commonly translated from Arabic as abode (home) of peace, from dar (house), and es salaam (of peace). Dar es Salaam fell into decline after Majid's death in 1870, but was revived in 1887 when the German East Africa Company established a station there. The town's growth was facilitated by its role as the administrative and commercial centre of German East Africa and industrial expansion following the construction of the Central Railway Line in the early 1900s. Dar es Salaam Dar es Salaam is the most populous city in Tanzania and the fifth most populous in Africa. In 2020, the population was estimated to be 6.4 million. Urban rail transit in Africa Dar es Salaam is the economic center of Tanzania. In 2012, it welcomed the Treni ya Mwakyembe commuter rail system, which can serve a total of 30,000 passengers per day. Considering Dar es Salaam is projected to hit 13.4 million by 2035, this commuter rail system is only a drop in the bucket. A one-way ticket costs $0.25, or $0.50 round trip. Instead of building out a metro project like many other African cities are undertaking Dar es Salaam is focused on creating a BRT system. Dar es Salaam similar to many other rapidly growing urban centers is faced with significant traffic issues. Due to the size of Dar es Salaam, some commuters spend up to two hours commuting each day by very informal dalla dalla minibuses. Transport in Dar es Salaam is further constrained, because the highway network was designed to only handle 35,000 people created during the colonial era.\n\narts, fashion, media, film, television, finance\n\ninformation_extraction\n\nWhat is a polygon?\n\n4-polytope The two-dimensional analogue of a 4-polytope is a polygon, and the three-dimensional analogue is a polyhedron. Complex polygon In computer graphics, a complex polygon is a polygon which has a boundary comprising discrete circuits, such as a polygon with a hole in it. Geodesics on an ellipsoid A geodesic polygon is a polygon whose sides are geodesics. It is analogous to a spherical polygon, whose sides are great circles. The area of such a polygon may be found by first computing the area between a geodesic segment and the equator, i.e., the area of the quadrilateral in Fig. 1 . Once this area is known, the area of a polygon may be computed by summing the contributions from all the edges of the polygon. Abstract polytope A digon is a polygon with just 2 edges. Unlike any other polygon, both edges have the same two vertices. For this reason, it is degenerate in the Euclidean plane. Elementary mathematics A polygon is a shape that is bounded by a finite chain of straight line segments closing in a loop to form a closed chain or circuit. These segments are called its edges or sides, and the points where two edges meet are the polygon's vertices (singular: vertex) or corners. The interior of the polygon is sometimes called its body. An n-gon is a polygon with n sides. A polygon is a 2-dimensional example of the more general polytope in any number of dimensions. Convex polygon In geometry, a convex polygon is a polygon that is the boundary of a convex set. This means that the line segment between two points of the polygon is contained in the union of the interior and the boundary of the polygon. In particular, it is a simple polygon (not self-intersecting). Equivalently, a polygon is convex if every line that does not contain any edge intersects the polygon in at most two points. Polygon soup A polygon soup is a set of unorganized polygons, typically triangles, before the application of any structuring operation, such as e.g. octree grouping. Polygon partition In geometry, a partition of a polygon is a set of primitive units (e.g. squares), which do not overlap and whose union equals the polygon. A polygon partition problem is a problem of finding a partition which is minimal in some sense, for example a partition with a smallest number of units or with units of smallest total side-length. Star-shaped polygon In geometry, a star-shaped polygon is a polygonal region in the plane that is a star domain, that is, a polygon that contains a point from which the entire polygon boundary is visible. Polygon with holes In geometry, a polygon with holes is an area-connected planar polygon with one external boundary and one or more interior boundaries (holes). Polygons with holes can be dissected into multiple polygons by adding new edges, so they are not frequently needed.\n\nA polygon is a form in Geometry. It is a single dimensional plane made of connecting lines and any number of vertices. It is a closed chain of connected line segments or edges. The vertices of the polygon are formed where two edges meet. Examples of polygons are hexagons, pentagons, and octagons. Any plane that does not contain edges or vertices is not a polygon. An example of a non-polygon is a circle.\n\nopen_qa\n\nHow do I start running?\n\nBetter Start Running Better Start Running is a 2018 American comedy drama film directed by Brett Simon and starring Alex Sharp, Analeigh Tipton, Edi Gathegi, Karan Soni, Maria Bello, Kris Jerome Flowers and Jeremy Irons.

Nan Bangs McKinnell Nan and Jim spent much of their married life traveling and creating together. The two are remembered as artistic partners with most of their work having been made collaboratively. The two traveled across America and the world, working at colleges and artist's colonies while developing their craft. In 1953, Nan and James attended a ceramics workshop at the Archie Bray Foundation and decided to stay and work there for several years. It was at the Bray where Nan began developing glazes. Nan's deep copper glaze is still widely used today. Her glaze-making also opened up an appreciation for the decorative side of ceramics. As Nan and Jim began working more collaboratively, Nan's decorative eye came out more. In their process, often one would throw a piece on the wheel and the other would decorate it, combining their two separate artistic eyes and influences. Nan was drawn to natural shapes and forms, drawing on flowers, leaves, insects, and other animals. Pong Nan Nan Yik-Pong, better known by his stage name Pong Nan (; born 15 May 1978), is a Cantopop musician, singer-songwriter and actor in Hong Kong of Hakka ancestry. Nan Bangs McKinnell In Seattle, Nan began working as a teacher once again, earning money to help support her family back in Nebraska. It wasn't long until Nan was applying for graduate school, and after a few years in Seattle, she was taking summer classes at the University of Washington where she started her art. While the men were away at war, Nan began teaching in an architectural drawing and design classes at the University. As she continued her own studies, Nan realized that painting and design were not her forte and took an introductory class in ceramic engineering and was drawn to clay as an artistic medium.

Nan Qi (artist) Nan is a contemporary Chinese ink painter depicting a variety of themes, ranging from the human form to landscapes and abstract concentric ink dots, using Chinese in and xuan rice paper. During his training as a Chinese ink painter, Nan specialised in classical landscapes inspired by Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasty artists. Early experimentation with different brush strokes and techniques, varying the dilution of ink and wash, resulted in the distinctive ink “dabs” produced in his early works. During the mid-to-late 1990s, Nan began designing and printing the catalogues for his own exhibitions, and was inspired by the dot matrices used in printing. This gave rise to a progression from ink “dabs” to more and more dot-like brush strokes, culminating in his development of his signature “halo dot” brush stroke in 2004. At this point, the themes and content of Nan’s work were becoming solidly contemporary and modern, moving away from landscapes. Over the next ten years, Nan developed a completely unique repertoire of brush strokes and ink painting techniques, including the “halo dot”, the “Nan Qi Way” for controlling ink flow into highly absorbent rice paper, and the “3D ink” technique, which allows him to create three-dimensional optical illusions by hand.\n\nMake sure you get comfortable running shoes and attire. Start with achievable goal in mind like a 5K race. If you never ran before, start gradually from a walk, to brisk walk, light jog aiming for 15-30mins initially.

She has directed episodes of The X-Files, Better Call Saul, Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead, Game of Thrones, and Westworld. Michelle MacLaren The same year she also directed the ninth episode of the HBO series Westworld. When the directors of the final season of Game of Thrones were announced, several prominent news sites, including Polygon and Nerdist, expressed disappointment that MacLaren, the only woman to direct on the series, was not included. Game of Thrones (season 3) Daniel Minahan, Alex Graves, Michelle MacLaren, and David Nutter each directed two episodes. One further episode was directed by previous series cinematographer, Alik Sakharov, whereas another was co-directed by Benioff and Weiss, both making their directorial debuts, although only Benioff is credited for directing the episode. Game of Thrones (season 4) Benioff and Weiss co-directed the season premiere after making their directorial debut in season 3, although only Weiss is credited as Benioff received credit for their previous directed episode; Alex Graves, who directed two episodes in season 3, returned and directed episodes 2, 3, 8 and 10; Michelle MacLaren, who also directed two episodes in season 3, returned to direct episodes 4 and 5; former series cinematographer Alik Sakharov, who directed in seasons 2 and 3, returned to direct episodes 6 and 7; and Neil Marshall directed episode 9 after previously directing Blackwater, the ninth episode of season 2. Michelle MacLaren She is developing a miniseries for HBO with Breaking Bad co-producer Vince Gilligan called Raven, based on the Jonestown massacre. Michelle MacLaren MacLaren made her directorial debut on the season nine episode of The X-Files, John Doe, which was written by her future Breaking Bad collaborator Vince Gilligan. She approaches shooting action sequences as mathematical deconstruction and likes using multiple cameras and wide lenses. Oathkeeper Oathkeeper is the fourth episode of the fourth season of HBO's medieval fantasy television series Game of Thrones. The 34th episode overall, Oathkeeper was written by Bryan Cogman and directed by Michelle MacLaren. It first aired on HBO on April 27, 2014. Game of Thrones Each ten-episode season of Game of Thrones had four to six directors, who usually directed back-to-back episodes. Alan Taylor directed seven episodes, the most of any director. Alex Graves, David Nutter, Mark Mylod, and Jeremy Podeswa directed six episodes each. Daniel Minahan directed five episodes, and Michelle MacLaren, Alik Sakharov, and Miguel Sapochnik directed four each; MacLaren is the only female director of the entire series's run.

The goal of process mining is to turn event data into insights and actions. Process mining is an integral part of data science, fueled by the availability of event data and the desire to improve processes. Process mining techniques use event data to show what people, machines, and organizations are really doing. Process mining provides novel insights that can be used to identify the executional path taken by operational processes and address their performance and compliance problems. Process mining Process mining starts from event data. Input for process mining is an event log. An event log views a process from a particular angle. Each event in the log should contain (1) a unique identifier for a particular process instance (called case id), (2) an activity (description of the event that is occurring), and (3) a timestamp. There may be additional event attributes referring to resources, costs, etc., but these are optional. With some effort, such data can be extracted from any information system supporting operational processes. Process mining uses these event data to answer a variety of process-related questions. Process mining The IEEE Task Force on Process Mining was established in October 2009 as part of the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society. This is a vendor-neutral organization aims to promote the research, development, education and understanding of process mining, make end-users, developers, consultants, and researchers aware of the state-of-the-art in process mining, promote the use of process mining techniques and tools and stimulate new applications, play a role in standardization efforts for logging event data (e.g., XES), Decision mining Process mining is a technique used to turn event data into insights and actions. Techniques used in process mining such as Process discovery and Conformance checking depend only one the order of activities executed in the operations. The event log not only contains the activity details, but also timestamps, resources and data accompanied with process execution. Careful analysis of the external details from the event log can reveal useful information that can be used for making predictions on decisions that might be taken in the future (decision mining), efficiency and working dynamics of the team (organisational mining), and performance analysis. Process mining organize tutorials, special sessions, workshops, competitions, panels, and develop material (papers, books, online courses, movies, etc.) to inform and guide people new to the field. The IEEE Task Force on Process Mining established the International Process Mining Conference (ICPM) series, lead the development of the IEEE XES standard for storing and exchanging event data Process mining Process mining should be viewed as a bridge between data science and process science. Process mining focuses on transforming event log into a meaningful representation of the process which can lead to the formation of several data science and machine learning related problems. Process mining The term Process mining was first coined in a research proposal written by the Dutch computer scientist Wil van der Aalst (Godfather of Process mining). Thus began a new field of research that emerged under the umbrella of techniques related to data science and process science at the Eindhoven University in 1999. In the early days, process mining techniques were often convoluted with the techniques used for workflow management. In the year 2000, the very first practically applicable algorithm for process discovery, Alpha miner was developed. The very next year, in 2001, a much similar algorithm based on heuristics called Heuristic miner was introduced in the research papers. Further along the link more powerful algorithms such as inductive miner were developed for process discovery. As the field of process mining began to evolve, conformance checking became an integral part of it. The year 2004 earmarked the development of Token-based replay for conformance checking purposes. Apart from the mainstream techniques of process discovery and conformance checking, process mining branched out into multiple areas leading to the discovery and development of Performance analysis, Decision mining and Organizational mining in the year 2005 and 2006 respectively. In the year 2007, the first-ever commercial process mining company Futura Pi was established. The IEEE task force on PM, a governing body was formed in the year 2009 that began to overlook the norms and standards related to process mining. Further techniques were developed for conformance checking which led to the publishing of Alignment-based conformance checking in the year 2010. In 2011, the first-ever Process mining book was published. Further along in 2014, a MOOC course was offered by Coursera on Process mining. By the year 2018, nearly 30+ commercially available process mining tools were in the picture. The year 2019 earmarked the first Process mining conference. Today we have over 35 vendors offering tools and techniques for process discovery and conformance checking. Task Force on Process Mining The Task Force on Process Mining has a Steering Committee and an Advisory Board. The Steering Committee, chaired by Wil van der Aalst since its inception in 2009, defined 15 action lines. These include the organization of the annual International Process Mining Conference (ICPM) series, standardization efforts leading to the IEEE XES standard for storing and exchanging event data, and the Process Mining Manifesto which was translated into 16 languages. The Task Force on Process Mining also publishes a newsletter, provides data sets, organizes workshops and competitions, and connects researchers and practitioners. Process mining There are three main classes of process mining techniques: process discovery, conformance checking, and process enhancement. In the past terms like Workflow Mining and Automated Business Process Discovery (ABPD) were used. Appian Corporation Process mining is the act of analyzing, improving, and monitoring business processes. Appian uses process mining to identify any business inefficiencies, then uses low-code to draw a visual representation of a more efficient workflow, and follows up with a second round of process mining after implementation to make sure that the new process has solved the problem\n\nProcess mining brings together data mining, data science and process management to find process efficiencies.\n\ninformation_extraction\n\nWhat are some unique curtain tie backs that you can make yourself?\n\nBrainstorming In the laboratory, directed brainstorming has been found to almost triple the productivity of groups over electronic brainstorming. Henri Barki Small Group Brainstorming and Idea Quality: Is Electronic Brainstorming the Most Effective Approach?<br> Deep foundation Secant piled walls can either be true hard/hard, hard/intermediate (firm), or hard/soft, depending on design requirements. Hard refers to structural concrete and firm or soft is usually a weaker grout mix containing bentonite. All types of wall can be constructed as free standing cantilevers, or may be propped if space and sub-structure design permit. Where party wall agreements allow, ground anchors can be used as tie backs. Brainstorming Individual brainstorming is the use of brainstorming in solitary situations. It typically includes such techniques as free writing, free speaking, word association, and drawing a mind map, which is a visual note taking technique in which people diagram their thoughts. Individual brainstorming is a useful method in creative writing and has been shown to be superior to traditional group brainstorming. Front curtain A front curtain, also known as a (front-of-)house curtain, act curtain, grand drape, main curtain or drape, proscenium curtain, or main rag is the stage curtain or curtains at the very front of a theatrical stage, separating it from the house.

Curtain tie-back A curtain knob consists of a decorative metal or wooden knob projecting directly out from the wall next to the curtain. The width of the knob serves to hold the curtain from spilling back into the window. Brainstorming Groups can improve the effectiveness and quality of their brainstorming sessions in a number of ways. Brainstorming According to a meta-analysis comparing EBS to face-to-face brainstorming conducted by DeRosa and colleagues, EBS has been found to enhance both the production of non-redundant ideas and the quality of ideas produced. Despite the advantages demonstrated by EBS groups, EBS group members reported less satisfaction with the brainstorming process compared to face-to-face brainstorming group members.\n\nThere are many items you can use to make a curtain tie back. Some ideas for this include a chain, a circle and pin, jute rope, wooden beaded rope, a necklack or bracelet, a door knob, a length of a leather belt, macrame rope, or a string of artificial flowers.\n\nbrainstorming\n\nWhat is a dispersive prism?\n\nDispersive prism In optics, a dispersive prism is an optical prism that is used to disperse light, that is, to separate light into its spectral components (the colors of the rainbow). Different wavelengths (colors) of light will be deflected by the prism at different angles. This is a result of the prism material's index of refraction varying with wavelength (dispersion). Generally, longer wavelengths (red) undergo a smaller deviation than shorter wavelengths (blue). The dispersion of white light into colors by a prism led Sir Isaac Newton to conclude that white light consisted of a mixture of different colors. Prism spectrometer A prism spectrometer is an optical spectrometer which uses a dispersive prism as its dispersive element. The prism refracts light into its different colors (wavelengths). The dispersion occurs because the angle of refraction is dependent on the refractive index of the prism's material, which in turn is slightly dependent on the wavelength of light that is traveling through it. Prism (optics) A dispersive prism can be used to break white light up into its constituent spectral colors (the colors of the rainbow) as described in the following section. Other types of prisms noted below can be used to reflect light, or to split light into components with different polarizations. Amici prism An Amici prism, named for the astronomer Giovanni Battista Amici, is a type of compound dispersive prism used in spectrometers. The Amici prism consists of two triangular prisms in contact, with the first typically being made from a medium-dispersion crown glass, and the second a higher-dispersion flint glass. Light entering the first prism is refracted at the first air-glass interface, refracted again at the interface between the two prisms, and then exits the second prism at near-normal incidence. The prism angles and materials are chosen such that one wavelength (colour) of light, the centre wavelength, exits the prism parallel to (but offset from) the entrance beam. The prism assembly is thus a direct-vision prism, and is commonly used as such in hand-held spectroscopes. Other wavelengths are deflected at angles depending on the glass dispersion of the materials. Looking at a light source through the prism thus shows the optical spectrum of the source. Dispersive prism René Descartes had seen light separated into the colors of the rainbow by glass or water, though the source of the color was unknown. Isaac Newton's 1666 experiment of bending white light through a prism demonstrated that all the colors already existed in the light, with different color corpuscles fanning out and traveling with different speeds through the prism. It was only later that Young and Fresnel combined Newton's particle theory with Huygens' wave theory to explain how color arises from the spectrum of light. Dispersive prism A different sort of spectrometer component called an immersed grating also consists of a prism with a diffraction grating ruled on one surface. However, in this case the grating is used in reflection, with light hitting the grating from inside the prism before being totally internally reflected back into the prism (and leaving from a different face). The reduction of the light's wavelength inside the prism results in an increase of the resulting spectral resolution by the ratio of the prism's refractive index to that of air. Dispersive prism Light changes speed as it moves from one medium to another (for example, from air into the glass of the prism). This speed change causes the light to be refracted and to enter the new medium at a different angle (Huygens principle). The degree of bending of the light's path depends on the angle that the incident beam of light makes with the surface, and on the ratio between the refractive indices of the two media (Snell's law). The refractive index of many materials (such as glass) varies with the wavelength or color of the light used, a phenomenon known as dispersion. This causes light of different colors to be refracted differently and to leave the prism at different angles, creating an effect similar to a rainbow. This can be used to separate a beam of white light into its constituent spectrum of colors. Prism (optics) Dispersive prisms are used to break up light into its constituent spectral colors because the refractive index depends on wavelength; the white light entering the prism is a mixture of different wavelengths, each of which gets bent slightly differently. Blue light is slowed more than red light and will therefore be bent more than red light. Perger prism The prism is not dispersive since light enters and exits the prism only at normal incidence. Since the light is reflected an even number of times by the Perger–Porro prism system, the image's handedness is not changed. Monochromator A monochromator can use either the phenomenon of optical dispersion in a prism, or that of diffraction using a diffraction grating, to spatially separate the colors of light. It usually has a mechanism for directing the selected color to an exit slit. Usually the g"
