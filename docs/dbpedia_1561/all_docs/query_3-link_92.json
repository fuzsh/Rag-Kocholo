He‚Äôs armed with a well-trained staff, luxurious surroundings, unmatched experience and a long list of A-listers.\n\n‚ÄúDallas is a tough market,‚Äù says Kevin Charles, owner of Kevin Charles Salon in Santa Barbara and, for the last nine months, Dallas. His latest creation is at McKinney and Pearl streets in Uptown.\n\n‚ÄúI always want to give value-added service. I travel first class, I love luxury cars, beautiful clothes and fine hotels. If I enjoy that, then my clients should have it, too,‚Äù Mr. Charles says. ‚ÄúWe serve champagne on Fridays between 3 and 6 p.m., wine all week long and mimosas all day on Saturdays.‚Äù\n\nBy offering such libations, Mr. Charles is sure to become the toast of the town. He honed his pampering skills by serving celebrity clients for more than 15 years at his California salon in the Four Seasons Santa Barbara. Actress Katie Holmes, supermodel Naomi Campbell and comedian Dennis Miller are just a few of his famous regulars.\n\nDallas‚Äô own bold-faced names discovered Mr. Charles while summering on the West Coast. They invited him to visit them upon their return to keep their coifs in the style to which they‚Äôd become accustomed. Soon the Dallas salon was born.\n\nThe transition to serving North Texas clients has been an easy one, he says.\n\n‚ÄúWomen in Dallas are very cultured,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThey know style and they know how to dress.‚Äù\n\nKevin Charles Salon Dallas is the first and only L‚ÄôOr√©al-approved color center in Texas. ‚ÄúWe were hand-picked by L‚ÄôOreal Paris to represent them at the highest level,‚Äù Mr. Charles says.\n\nIn Business\n\nKevin Charles Boyle, The Biltmore‚Äôs Hollywood Head Master\n\nBy Karen Taylor Perger\n\nAmerica‚Äôs love affair with Hollywood is equaled only by Hollywood‚Äôs love affair with hair. Hair was so important in Hollywood that Joan Crawford, at the height of her power as a 1930s movie star, had MGM import Sydney Guilaroff, a hairdresser she discovered in New York. He became so important to the studio that the imaginary Manhattan day spa in George Cukor‚Äôs film ‚ÄúThe Women‚Äù was even named ‚ÄòSydney‚Äôs‚Äô.\n\nReal-life celebrity stylists like Frederic Fekkai, Christophe, Art Luna, Tracey Cunningham, Oribe and Sally Hershberger, who boast almost as much charisma as the stars themselves, command over $500 a head when they dress celebrity locks.\n\nGood looks, talent and diplomatic skills help these Star-Stylists stay on top of the hair game. Kevin Charles of the Kevin Charles Salons can certainly play ball with any major league stylist in Beverly Hills, New York or around the world. After all, he has been coifing royalty and celebrities since he began his career with Vidal Sassoon in London‚Äôs upscale Mayfair District.\n\nCharles has trimmed the tresses and styled celebrities for numerous shoots including In Style, Vogue, Elle, Glamour, Vanity Fair, Self and Santa Barbara Magazine. He has also been behind the scenes cutting, coloring and styling hair and applying makeup at the MTV Awards, the Emmys, Golden Globes and the Academy Awards.\n\nKevin migrated up the coast to Santa Barbara after a stint working for Sassoon in Los Angles and opened Expose International on Coast Village Road. ‚ÄúIt was close enough for Los Angeles clients to still come and see me and it‚Äôs a great place to raise kids,‚Äù said the amiable father.\n\nThe Four Seasons Resort Hotel group sought him out for their salon space at the Biltmore. He agreed opening a satellite of his original salon in the hotel.\n\nKevin helped his close friend Frederick Fekkai open a salon on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. Kevin worked there and helped train the staff\n\nWeary of commuting between three salons, Kevin sold the Coast Village Road business, to concentrate his energies on more of his own salons and product lines.\n\nWith a client list reading like a ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs Who‚Äù of Hollywood, he has dressed the hair of models Naomi Campbell and Cheryl Tiegs. Actors Jennifer Garner, Julia Roberts, Heather Locklear, Carmen Electra, Jane Seymour, Cheryl Ladd, Kelsey Grammar, James Woods, Sir Anthony Hopkins and Kevin Costner. Musicians Ossy Osbourne and Rod Stewart, The Goo Goo Dolls, Elton John and Peter Noone. He has styled for the Kardashian weddings and the late Princess Diana to name just a few.\n\nLike his mentors Fekkai and Sassoon, Kevin has also created a hair care line. A skin care line and a spa line will soon be added to his stable of products. I sat down with Kevin in his recently remodeled (by interior designer and Montecito resident Corinna Gordon) salon. He gave me a new ‚Äúdo‚Äù while I asked him some rather hairy questions.\n\nQ. What‚Äôs the biggest difference between Santa Barbara and Hollywood hairstyles?\n\nA.The look is much more cosmopolitan in L.A. In Santa Barbara, it tends to be more comfortable and relaxed. Santa Barbarians are chic with a softer edge. They are also becoming sort of European in style.\n\nQ. How does a hairdresser stay on top in Hollywood?\n\nA. Besides artistic ability, hard work and drive, one must create a ‚Äúlook‚Äù instead of following trends. Attention to detail, personality good public relations and the ability to be confident is also very important.\n\nQ. Is there anything you must be careful about when cutting or styling?\n\nA. I focus on each individual client whether they are a celebrity or not. I take into consideration their individual style, bone structure, face shape, eye color, skin tone, height and hair type: length, hair line direction, color, shine and texture. In the case of an actor or actress, I am sometimes governed by a particular role they are playing. I also take into consideration their hobbies and interests like sports they participate in regularly.\n\nQ. Does Hollywood set the trend for hairstyles?\n\nA. I don‚Äôt think you can look at trends in hairstyles without looking at trends in fashion. Most celebrities travel extensively ‚Äì Milan, Paris, London, New York etc. When you see new trends you can see the influences coming from those places. I think ‚ÄúHollywood‚Äù provides visibility to those trends, but it does not set tends because it is not fashion‚Äôs main influence. That‚Äôs why I feel it is important that hairdressers travel.\n\nQ. With all opportunities available to you in Hollywood, why have you made the Kevin Charles Salon your priority?\n\nA. I‚Äôm still close enough to Los Angeles to be involved in the ‚ÄúHollywood Scene‚Äù. Working in Beverly Hills gave me the opportunity to progress at a faster speed, but I wanted my children and myself to have the quality and balance of life available here.\n\nQ. Why are there so many blondes in California?\n\nA. In Southern California, men tend to be more attracted to blondes. In other places and in European countries, men are more attracted to brunettes. I think fun women will have fun regardless of the color of their hair.\n\nQ. What do you do when you are not working?\n\nA. I am passionate about Formula One racing (a friend of mine owns one of the teams ‚Äì McLaren F1) I enjoy my Harley Davidson‚Äôs and I love spending as much time as I can with my wife, Beccy and my children.\n\nSB People Kevin Charles, He‚Äôs a Cut Above.\n\nBy Jenny Murray, Associate Editor of Santa Barbara Magazine\n\nHis phone rings. It‚Äôs one of his children. They talk about dinner plans and he coos salutations in his impeccable English accent. Phone rings again, Jafra Cosmetics International is on the line, they discuss his next social obligation: three months of global appearances as the face of their new hair care line. Turning his phone off, he apologizes, ‚ÄúI tell my team that when someone walks across the threshold to remember that it‚Äôs our pleasure to be serving them, I really try not to take calls.‚Äù No explanation needed. Unlike other celebrity hairdressers who charge hundreds of dollars for a cut and don‚Äôt stick around for the blow-dry, Kevin Charles is pure class. The talented entrepreneur is a committed multi-tasker. His Kinvara lines (named after his mother‚Äôs castle in the south of Ireland), Kinvara spa and cosmetics Award Collection (available at his salon, Chadwicks and on QVC), are in full bloom. He‚Äôll be handling beauty products for the five star Four Seasons Biltmore‚Äôs Resort‚Äôs new spa when it opens next year. And Charles is now in the midst of launching Jafra‚Äôs first hair care line.\n\nWith Charles at the helm, Jafra is enjoying a new sense of recognition. The success of the Kevin Charles Salon, tucked behind the historic Biltmore‚Äôs lobby is penned in his brimming appointment book. He‚Äôs Santa Barbara Magazine‚Äôs ‚Äúgo-to‚Äù guy, while also styling models and personalities for In-Style, Vogue, Elle, Glamour, Vanity fair, Self, and on screen at the MTV Awards, Emmys and Oscars‚Ñ¢.\n\nDecended from English and Irish aristocracy, Charles treats every client as if they were members of the court. With his old-fashioned view of service and cutting edge styling talent, he‚Äôs attracted a veritable ‚Äúwho‚Äôs who‚Äù of Montecito and Hollywood society, including Cheryl Ladd, Jaclyn Smith, Naomi Campbell, John Cleese, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Kevin Costner to name just a few. It‚Äôs no wonder he‚Äôs so comfortable within the orbit of ‚ÄúAmerican royalty‚Äù after all, the guy‚Äôs family does own a castle.\n\nFrom a family of lawyers and bankers, the Rugby all-star fumbled into hairdressing. He was following family tradition and studying law when it was suggested he‚Äôd be a brilliant entrepreneur, Charles wasn‚Äôt easily taken.\n\nCharles delights in giving back to the community that‚Äôs supported him. He participates in national fundraising for breast cancer awareness, multiple sclerosis (Tommy Hilfiger/VH1 fashion show raising FOUR MILLION dollars in one weekend) and the YMCA. The Museum of Art, Direct Relief International, Civic Light Opera and The Boys and Girls Club are among the local organizations that have benefited from his generosity.\n\nThe savvy businessman is an equally accomplished family man. Upon his father‚Äôs death, Charles found himself reflecting on his paternal role and the impression he wants to make on his five children, James, Sophie, Maxwell, Trinity and little Atticus (2 and 1/2 yrs old) ‚ÄúFamily is very, very important to me,‚Äù he says with conviction.\n\nWith a passion for the martial arts exceeded only by a passion for Formula One race cars, Charles knows how to have fun. He delights in coaxing stock cars around the speedway at nearly 170 miles per hour.\n\nTo be sure, Kevin Charles styles the way he drives: with precision and panache."
