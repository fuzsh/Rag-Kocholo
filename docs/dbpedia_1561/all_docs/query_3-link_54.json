We review the Jupiter science enabled by the JUICE mission, building on the legacy of discoveries from the Galileo, Cassini, and Juno missions, alongside ground- and space-based observatories. We focus on remote sensing of the climate, meteorology, and chemistry of the atmosphere and auroras from the cloud-forming weather layer, through the upper troposphere, into the stratosphere and ionosphere. The Jupiter orbital tour provides a wealth of opportunities for atmospheric and auroral science: global perspectives with its near-equatorial and inclined phases, sampling all phase angles from dayside to nightside, and investigating phenomena evolving on timescales from minutes to months. The remote sensing payload spans far-UV spectroscopy (50-210 nm), visible imaging (340-1080 nm), visible/near-infrared spectroscopy (0.49-5.56 μm), and sub-millimetre sounding (near 530-625 GHz and 1067-1275 GHz). This is coupled to radio, stellar, and solar occultation opportunities to explore the atmosphere at high vertical resolution; and radio and plasma wave measurements of electric discharges in the Jovian atmosphere and auroras. Cross-disciplinary scientific investigations enable JUICE to explore coupling processes in giant planet atmospheres, to show how the atmosphere is connected to (i) the deep circulation and composition of the hydrogen-dominated interior; and (ii) to the currents and charged particle environments of the external magnetosphere. JUICE will provide a comprehensive characterisation of the atmosphere and auroras of this archetypal giant planet.\n\nKeywords: JUICE, Jupiter, Atmospheres, Auroras, Dynamics, Chemistry\n\nIntroduction\n\nJupiter is our closest and best example of a hydrogen-dominated gas giant planet, representing a class of objects ∼10× the size of Earth that may be commonplace across our galaxy. The formation and migration of such a large planet (317.8 Earth masses, approximately 0.1% of the mass of the Sun) shaped the architecture of our Solar System, such that the origin of Jupiter is an essential piece of the puzzle of planetary system evolution, providing a window on the epoch of planet formation. Jupiter provides a perfect planetary-scale laboratory for the exploration of atmospheric physics and chemistry (e.g., climate, meteorology, and convective processes on a rapidly-rotating hydrogen-rich world), without the complicating influences of terrestrial topography or large seasonal changes.1 Jupiter also provides a means to explore how the layers within a giant planet are coupled, from the interior to the external plasma environment, and vice versa. For example, the interaction between the upper atmosphere and the plasma environment of the magnetosphere creates an auroral lightshow that is unrivalled in the Solar System. The influence of solar ultraviolet light on the chemicals in Jupiter’s stratosphere generates a rich atmospheric chemistry. And motions within the interior, from the metallic hydrogen to the deep atmosphere, influence the ever-shifting clouds and colours in the visible atmosphere.\n\nFor all these reasons and more, a comprehensive investigation of Jupiter as the archetypal giant planet is one of the two primary goals of ESA’s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE), Europe’s first mission to the Jupiter system (Witasse et al. 2024). The emergence of habitable worlds within Gas Giant systems is explored by Tobie et al. (2024) and Tosi et al. (2024), focussing on Ganymede, Europa and Callisto. The wider Jovian system, and the magnetosphere, are covered by Masters et al. (2024), Schmidt et al. (2024) and Denk et al. (2024), here we focus on the Jupiter scientific investigations enabled by the JUICE orbital tour and its suite of state-of-the-art instruments. Jupiter science, particularly atmospheric, magnetospheric, and auroral science and how they connect to the wider system of potentially-habitable satellites, formed a key component of ESA’s Jupiter mission from the outset, when it was first formulated as the multi-spacecraft Laplace mission in 2007 (Blanc et al. 2009) for ESA’s Cosmic Vision. The science case evolved as it became the Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter (JGO, Blanc and Greeley 2010), ESA’s contribution to the Europa-Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) between 2008 and 2011. Finally, Jupiter exploration was a cornerstone in the science case for JUICE (Grasset et al. 2013), which was selected (2012) and adopted (2014) as ESA’s first ‘L-class’ mission, and which launched on April 14th, 2023.\n\nThe science case presented by Grasset et al. (2013) built on the discoveries of the Galileo orbiter (1995-2003) and in situ probe (1995); the flybys of Pioneer 10 and 11 (1973, 1974), Voyager 1 and 2 (1979), Cassini (2000) and New Horizons (2007); and the wealth of remote sensing investigations from ground-based and earth-orbiting observatories. These previous missions had provided snapshots of Jupiter at specific times, often lacking adequate sampling of Jovian variability over minutes (e.g., auroras, lightning), days (e.g., storm plumes, impacts), months (belt/zone changes), and years (vortices) to determine the mean atmospheric state and the drivers of variability. JUICE would provide a continuity of data coverage over long temporal baselines to address the shortcomings of the previous snapshots, particularly the challenging Galileo observations due to the failed deployment of its high-gain antenna. JUICE would also use broad and quasi-simultaneous spectral coverage from the UV to the sub-millimetre to probe different atmospheric layers. At the time of mission adoption, the Jupiter science case (Grasset et al. 2013) aimed to provide ‘the first four-dimensional climate database for the study of Jovian meteorology and chemistry,’ creating a global picture of the processes shaping the Jovian atmosphere ‘from the thermosphere down to the lower troposphere.’ This led to three science objectives to characterise atmospheric (a) dynamics and circulation; (b) composition and chemistry; and (c) vertical structure and clouds. It also determined a series of mission requirements that would contribute to the design of the JUICE orbital tour, sampling both low- and high-latitude domains over a long span of time.\n\nSince the JUICE Jupiter science case was developed, both the orbital tour (Boutonnet et al. 2024) and the payload capabilities have been fully specified. Furthermore, NASA’s Juno mission has been providing new discoveries and insights into the planet’s interior, atmosphere, and magnetosphere since its arrival at Jupiter in 2016 (e.g., Bolton et al. 2017). Juno’s elliptical polar orbit brought the spacecraft close to Jupiter every ∼53 days (reducing to ∼40 days during the extended mission) to provide high-resolution regional views, whereas JUICE will have a near-equatorial orbit that provides opportunities for longer-term monitoring and global views. The tour strategies for Juno and JUICE are therefore different and complementary. Furthermore, Juno’s exploration of the deep interior via gravity sounding and microwave remote sensing complements the JUICE observations at lower pressures. Given the wealth of new discoveries from Juno and supporting Earth-based observations since the original JUICE objectives were developed, and new insights gained from the culmination of the Cassini mission at Saturn between 2004-2017, this paper revisits and significantly updates the JUICE Jupiter science case.\n\nThis paper is organised as follows. Section 2 provides a brief review of the Jupiter science case for JUICE, in light of the latest discoveries, and focusing on key questions and objectives that must be addressed by the tour and payload. Requirements for the tour, and the observation opportunities needed to address the science objectives, are discussed in Sect. 3. Details of the payload relevant to Jupiter science, and how the instruments will operate both independently and synergistically to achieve the science goals, are provided in Sects. 4-5. We place the JUICE science case into broader context of other missions and astronomical facilities operating in the 2030s in Sect. 6, and emphasise the need for Earth-based support from amateur and professional observers. Finally, Sect. 7 confirms how the instruments and tour achieves closure of the science requirements.\n\nJupiter Scientific Objectives\n\nJupiter’s atmosphere, and its connections to both the deep interior and external plasma environment, are to be explored via a carefully-designed remote sensing investigation (Sect. 4) across a ∼4-year orbital tour that samples a range of illumination conditions, geometries, and orbital inclinations (see Sect. 3). The original JUICE Jupiter science case was subdivided into three scientific objectives that sought to ‘characterise atmospheric (a) dynamics and circulation; (b) composition and chemistry; and (c) vertical structure and clouds.’ This led to a traceability matrix with 11 specific science investigations (Table , and summarised in Fig. ), and 12 level-one science requirements (based on Science Requirements Document JUI-EST-SGS-RS-001). These requirements on the spacecraft capabilities and tour are emphasised in boldface font and discussed in detail in this Section, but first we briefly introduce the payload elements that will be crucial to achieving the JUICE Jupiter-science objectives: an ultraviolet spectrograph (UVS, Gladstone et al. 2024, and Sect. 4.1); visible-light camera (JANUS, Palumbo et al. 2024, and Sect. 4.4); near-infrared mapping spectrometer (MAJIS, Poulet et al. 2024, and Sect. 4.2); sub-millimetre wave instrument (SWI, Hartogh et al. 2024, and Sect. 4.3); a radio science experiment for atmospheric occultations (3GM, Iess et al. 2024 and Sect. 4.5; PRIDE, Gurvits et al. 2024); and a radio and plasma wave instrument (RPWI, Wahlund et al. 2024, and Sect. 4.6). These studies, conducted synergistically by six onboard instruments and an Earth-based experiment (PRIDE), will be used to achieve the scientific goals described in the following sections.\n\nTable 1\n\nJACharacterise the atmospheric dynamics and circulationJA.1Investigate the dynamics and variability of Jupiter’s weather layer.JA.2Determine the thermodynamics of atmospheric meteorology.JA.3Quantify the roles of wave propagation and atmospheric coupling on energy and material transport.JA.4Investigate auroral structure and energy transport mechanisms at high latitudes.JA.5Understand the interrelationships between the ionosphere and thermosphere.JBCharacterise the atmospheric composition and chemistryJB.1Determine Jupiter’s bulk elemental composition to constrain formation and evolution.JB.2Investigate upper atmospheric chemistry and exogenic inputs from the stratosphere to the thermosphere.JB.3Study spatial variation in composition associated with discrete phenomena and polar vortices.JB.4Determine the importance of moist convection in meteorology, cloud formation, and chemistry.JCCharacterise the atmospheric vertical structure and cloudsJC.1Determine the three-dimensional temperature, cloud and aerosols structure from Jupiter’s upper troposphere to the lower thermosphere.JC.2Study coupling by waves, eddy mixing and global circulation across atmospheric layers.\n\nJupiter’s Dynamic Weather Layer\n\nInvestigations of Jovian dynamics and meteorology are naturally biased to the dayside top-most clouds, where contrasts in colours, and rapid motions of small-scale meteorological phenomena, reveal the banded structure of winds, aerosols, temperatures, and gaseous composition. This two-dimensional perspective samples a relatively unique interface, where the condensate cloud decks start to mingle with sunlight; where adiabatic lapse rates (both dry and saturated) become influenced by radiative heating to produce the statically-stable upper troposphere; and where photolysis of gaseous compounds by ultraviolet light can produce colourful hazes. Although visible-light images inform much of what we know today about atmospheric dynamics on Jupiter-sized worlds (Ingersoll et al. 2004; Vasavada and Showman 2005; Sánchez-Lavega et al. 2019), spectroscopy is needed to sample all the different layers within a planetary atmosphere. Spectroscopy and imaging from the UV to the sub-millimetre (Figs. and ) provides an invaluable tool to access the vertical dimension, probing the depths below the visible cloud tops (∼500−1000 mbars), and extending measurements through the cold-trap of the tropopause (∼100 mbar), the radiatively-controlled stratosphere (mbar-μbar pressures), and into the ionosphere and thermosphere (nbar pressures). Spectroscopy from JUICE will exploit reflected sunlight, i.e., the solar spectrum with significant absorption from methane and other species to sound the vertical distribution of aerosols, and thermal emission, i.e., hydrogen-helium collision-induced opacity overlain by tropospheric absorption and stratospheric/ionospheric emission bands. JUICE will use nadir views, limb views, and solar/stellar occultations, to probe the vertical domain and the transfer of energy, momentum and material between adjacent atmospheric layers.\n\nThis capability to view the Jovian atmosphere in three dimensions will be exploited over a variety of spatial scales, from the largest circulation patterns, to the smallest storm systems and waves.\n\nBelt/Zone Circulation\n\nThe dominance of the Coriolis force in the momentum balance on a rapidly rotating planet leads to the generation of a system of planetary bands. Jupiter’s system of zonal (east-west) jets has been remarkably stable over multiple years (García-Melendo and Sánchez-Lavega 2001; Porco et al. 2003; Hueso et al. 2017; Tollefson et al. 2017), despite significant variability in cloud coverage and aerosols. The jets themselves appear to be maintained by an upscale flow of energy, from the smallest scales to the largest scales, with eddies and storms feeding momentum into the zonal flows (Sánchez-Lavega et al. 2019). Given Jupiter’s rapid rotation, the jets are in geostrophic balance, as the Coriolis force is in balance with the forces exerted by the pressure gradient, and the thermal wind equation (Holton 2004) relates the vertical shear on the winds to latitudinal temperature contrasts in the upper troposphere. At altitudes above the top-most clouds, the tropospheric winds are found to decay with increasing height (Pirraglia et al. 1981; Flasar et al. 2004; Fletcher et al. 2016), and the temperature gradients and zonal jets are so well co-aligned that both are used to define the latitudes of Jupiter’s canonical warm, cyclonic ‘belts’ and cool, anticyclonic ‘zones.’ These axisymmetric bands sometimes (but not always) exhibit contrasts in aerosol properties - zones are often considered to be bright and reflective, as volatile species like ammonia become saturated and condense to NH3 ice at the cool temperatures of the zones. Conversely, aerosols evaporate/sublime in the warmer and typically cloud-free belts. But this correspondence between aerosols and the belt/zone boundaries is only well defined around the equator, with its typically-white Equatorial Zone (EZ) bordered by the typically-brown North and South Equatorial Belts (NEB and SEB). At mid-latitudes, the banding becomes more tightly packed, with Tropical Zones giving way to a series of Temperate Belts in each hemisphere, each bordered by prograde (eastward) jets on the equatorward edge, and retrograde (westward) jets on their poleward edge. Here the correspondence between the thermal/wind banding and the aerosol properties begins to break down (Fletcher et al. 2020). The last detectable zonal jets, around 65−70∘ in each hemisphere, give way to a polar region dominated by smaller-scale vortices and large cyclones (Orton et al. 2017; Mura et al. 2022), albeit still with some form of latitudinal organisation (see Sect. 2.1.2). A diagram presenting the zone/belt structure is shown in Fig. .\n\nJupiter’s belts and zones therefore appear to differ as a function of latitude, and their appearance at least at wavelengths sensitive to aerosols appears to change over poorly understood timescales (Fletcher 2017; Antuñano et al. 2018, 2019). To better understand the circulation patterns associated with the planetary banding, JUICE will probe their vertical aerosol and gaseous structures via spectroscopy, and characterise the fluxes of momentum and energy into the zonal jets. Crucially, the JUICE orbital tour enables long-term monitoring of the winds, clouds, and composition, to see how they change along with the axisymmetric ‘upheavals’ to their appearance. For example, the North Equatorial Belt undergoes periods of northward expansion and contraction with a 4-5 year period (Fletcher et al. 2017a); the Equatorial Zone exhibits periodic clearings of clouds with a 6-7 year period (Antuñano et al. 2018); the North Temperate Belt exhibits spectacular plume activity on a 4-5 year period (Sánchez-Lavega et al. 2016); and the South Equatorial Belt displays disturbances, fades (whitening) and revivals with periods of 3-7 years (Sánchez-Lavega and Gomez 1996; Fletcher et al. 2017c). These timescales, or at least their half-cycles, are within reach of the JUICE mission.\n\nMeasuring Winds: Determination of wind speed and direction requires the monitoring of cloud tracers (Sánchez-Lavega et al. 2019), usually over one Jupiter rotation (10 hours), but sometimes over smaller time-scales (0.5-2.0 hr) on particularly active regions in convective storms, turbulent regions or inside vortices. Continuum-band imaging, i.e., away from strong methane absorption, where the atmosphere is relatively transparent down to the NH3-ice cloud tops, and methane-band imaging (i.e., sensing the upper tropospheric hazes) can be used to determine how winds vary with altitude, a direct measure of the vertical wind shear that can be compared to maps of tropospheric temperatures derived from continuum spectra measured in the sub-millimetre. The resultant wind maps can reveal zonal and (weak) meridional motions, and resolve the motions of individual eddies to understand momentum convergence on the zonal jets (Salyk et al. 2006), as well as the kinetic-energy and turbulence spectra at the cloud tops. By observing how this changes with time, such maps will allow JUICE to explore the variability of the energetics of the jets, particularly in relation to discrete storm activity and planet-wide changes. JUICE will thus be able to ‘globally determine the vertical structure of zonal, meridional and vertical winds and eddy fields to understand the mechanisms driving zonal jets and meteorological activity (R1-J-5).’ The close-in orbit of Juno, whilst providing high-resolution regional views of atmospheric phenomena with JunoCam (Hansen et al. 2017), cannot provide the global temporal coverage needed to study the global windfield.\n\nThis discussion naturally raises the question of how the windspeeds change as a function of depth. Infrared imaging, particularly in the 4.5-5.7 μm range, senses thermal emission from the 2-6 bar region, with clouds in silhouette (i.e., absorbing) against the bright background. Tracking of cloud tracers at these longer ‘M-band’ wavelengths may enable JUICE to measure windshear immediately below the NH3 ice clouds, down to the levels where the NH4SH cloud is expected to form via combination of NH3 and H2S, and possibly the condensation levels of H2O clouds (see Fig. ). The Galileo probe revealed that winds appeared to strengthen from the cloud tops to the 5-bar level (Atkinson et al. 1998) for a single location (the jet stream separating the NEB and EZ), whilst microwave contrasts measured by Juno (Oyafuso et al. 2020) were suggestive of the same strengthening of zonal winds at all latitudes down to the ∼6 bar level of the H2O cloud (Fletcher et al. 2021). However, degeneracies between ammonia absorption and physical temperatures prevent a unique interpretation of microwave data, so JUICE will attempt to use visible and near-infrared observations to directly determine windshear and atmospheric stability across all of Jupiter’s belts and zones down to approximately ∼5 bars.\n\nClouds and Hazes: JUICE has two further techniques to determine the properties of the belts and zones - by mapping the distributions of aerosols and gases. The vertical distribution of aerosols - both condensed volatiles like NH3 ice, and photochemical hazes like, possibly, hydrazine N2H4 - can be derived by modelling reflected-sunlight spectra in the near-infrared, as the differing strengths of gaseous CH4 absorption provide sensitivity across a range of altitudes. The phase function of aerosol scattering can be used to investigate the size, shape, and possible chemical composition of the aerosols. This remains a considerable unknown - the clouds are certainly not pure condensates (e.g., Sromovsky and Fry 2010a; Pérez-Hoyos et al. 2020), but could be aggregates of multiple compounds, seeded around a cloud-condensation nucleus that could be photochemical in origin (e.g., West et al. 2004). However, breaking the degeneracies between the optical properties, composition, and vertical structure requires sampling the aerosol population under a range of illumination conditions and viewing geometries, from nadir low-phase imaging in noon sunlight, to observations of the dawn and dusk terminator regions. Darkening as observations approach the planetary limb and terminator can provide invaluable constraint on the aerosol properties. Diagnostic spectral signatures of pure NH3 ices, H2O ice and NH4SH all exist in the near-infrared accessible to MAJIS, particularly near 2-3 μm (Baines et al. 2002; Sromovsky and Fry 2010a, 2018), which can be used to understand the existence of fresh ices in regions of strong convective activity.\n\nThe JUICE orbital tour was required to ‘provide sufficient spectral, latitudinal, illumination and phase angle coverage to investigate Jovian aerosols from the condensation clouds to upper tropospheric and stratospheric hazes (R1-J-10).’ The nature of these Jovian aerosols is expected to be tied to their formation environments, such as fresh white condensates in cold zones, or stagnant UV-photolysed hazes in quiescent vortices, so JUICE will ‘relate the global temperature and wind structure to visible properties (albedo, winds, clouds) and atmospheric chemistry (R1-J-3).’ Finally, the ability to view the limb of Jupiter at high spatial resolution, using visible images and infrared spectral maps, could also provide access to thin, tenuous haze layers in the lower stratosphere, which in turn can be tied to the vertical thermal structure derived via sub-millimetre sounding the solar/stellar occultations. Figure shows the various altitudes and cloud layers probed by the remote sensing instruments.\n\nVolatiles and Disequilibrium Species:. Clouds are intricately linked to the supply of volatile species (NH3, H2S, H2O) to condense on condensation nuclei, and colourful aerosols are linked to the supply of chemicals (e.g., PH3, NH3, sulphur-bearing species) that can be photolysed by UV irradiation above the clouds. The strength of vertical mixing within the belts and zones is a crucial missing piece to understand this puzzle. Upper tropospheric PH3 and NH3 are known to be elevated in the anticyclonic zones and depleted in the cyclonic belts (Gierasch et al. 1986; Achterberg et al. 2006; Fletcher et al. 2009; Grassi et al. 2020). The EZ is the only region with a significant deep column of NH3 gas below the ammonia clouds (de Pater et al. 2016; Li et al. 2017). The ammonia rich EZ renders this region dark at microwave wavelengths sensitive to depths from 1 bar all the way down to 100 bar. Saturn displays a similar connection between gaseous species and the meridional circulation on the scale of the belts and zones (e.g., Fletcher et al. 2011; Laraia et al. 2013).\n\nThe meridional circulation derived from temperature measurements and jet decay was first explored during the Voyager era (Pirraglia et al. 1981; Conrath and Pirraglia 1983). The circulation associated with the equatorial zones and belts has been likened to the Earth’s Hadley circulation (Barcilon and Gierasch 1970). On the other hand, the mid-latitude jets may be similar to Earth’s Ferrel-like circulations (Fletcher et al. 2020) that may exhibit different directions (upwelling, downwelling) above and below the water-condensation level (as revealed by contrasts in microwave brightness associated with NH3 and temperatures in the 0.1-100 bar region, Duer et al. 2021; Fletcher et al. 2021). This hypothetical vertically-stacked series of cells with different circulation regimes is testable using measurements of gaseous species as tracers and the distribution of moist convection inferred from lighting (Vasavada et al. 2000; Fletcher et al. 2020). However, the belt/zone variability of several gaseous species accessible in the 4.0-5.7 μm range, including AsH3, GeH4, CO, and H2O, remains unclear, largely due to the challenge of accessing the trace abundances, and degeneracies associated with the distribution of aerosols (Giles et al. 2017; Bjoraker et al. 2018; Grassi et al. 2020). Both PH3 (160-180 nm) and NH3 (>160 nm) also provide absorption in the ultraviolet (Edgington et al. 1998; Melin et al. 2020), sensing higher altitudes of the upper troposphere where photochemical depletion dominates. It is possible that vertical motions, and associated transport of materials, is localised within discrete meteorological features (see Sect. 2.1.3), rather than being elevated over an entire planetary band. JUICE will map the spatial distributions of each of these species, and monitor their variation over months and years, in an effort to understand the belt/zone circulation patterns within and above the cloud-forming region of the troposphere.\n\nAt even higher pressures, below the cloud-forming layers, Juno has revealed that the cloud-level winds persist down to approximately 3000 km depth, decaying away before reaching the transition to metallic hydrogen (Kaspi et al. 2018, 2020; Guillot et al. 2018). The truncation of these winds could potentially be due to stabilising compositional gradients or radiative zones at great depth (Christensen et al. 2020), but must occur before differential winds reach the conducting, uniformly rotating interior where the dynamo originates (Cao and Stevenson 2017). Juno’s microwave radiometer can probe below the clouds to depths of ∼300 km, but unexpectedly found that NH3 still showed spatial belt/zone variability and global depletion (Bolton et al. 2017; Li et al. 2017; Ingersoll et al. 2017). The absence of microwave remote sensing and close-perijove gravity measurements on JUICE means that it will not directly reproduce these Juno discoveries, but it will scrutinise the interface region down to ∼5 bars - the weather layer sitting above the deeper troposphere - using infrared spectroscopy to understand how it couples to the deeper circulation patterns revealed by Juno.\n\nVortices\n\nJupiter’s banded appearance is disrupted by the presence of a diverse collection of geostrophic vortices, both anticyclones (high-pressure centres, with anticlockwise circulation in the southern hemisphere) and cyclones (low-pressure centres, with clockwise circulation in the southern hemisphere), as displayed in Fig. . These vortices possess the same sign of vorticity as the environment in which they are embedded, and are prevented from migrating with latitude by the strong shears associated with the system of zonal jets. Jupiter displays a fundamental asymmetry between the two types - anticyclones appear larger and more numerous than cyclones. Anticyclones appear to grow at the expense of other anticyclones, as was the case for Oval BA, which formed from three smaller anticyclones in the South Temperate Belt (Sánchez-Lavega et al. 2001). These vortices are relatively shallow ‘pancake-like’ structures, with horizontal extents orders of magnitude greater than their depths. They are thought to possess a midplane somewhere in the cloud-forming region (Dowling 2014; Lemasquerier et al. 2020), where tangential velocities and the pressure differences are at a maximum. Their windspeeds decay via the thermal wind equation (a ‘despinning’) with both altitude and depth. Thus an anticyclone will exhibit a cold anomaly in the upper troposphere, a cyclone will exhibit a warm anomaly, and such thermal contrasts have been confirmed by mid-infrared thermal imaging (e.g., Fletcher et al. 2010; Wong et al. 2020). Below the vortex midplane, there is evidence from Juno for warm cores beneath anticyclones, and cold cores beneath cyclones (Bolton et al. 2021; Parisi et al. 2021). However, these deep levels will not be accessible to JUICE.\n\nAnticyclones: The Great Red Spot (GRS) (Fig. a) is the largest and longest-lived of all the vortices observed in planetary atmospheres (Rogers 1995). Internally the GRS exhibits a variety of meteorological phenomena (Sánchez-Lavega et al. 2018), and the interaction of these large-scale vortices with the surrounding environment also has a significant effect on Jovian dynamics. The Great Red Spot deflects jet streams to the north and south, which generate a ‘wake’ of turbulent activity that promotes moist convective plumes (see Sect. 2.1.3). The peripheral winds appear to entrain material within the GRS (Sánchez-Lavega et al. 2021), such that the unidentified compounds responsible for the orange-red haze (Baines et al. 2019) are either irradiated for longer within the stagnant top of the anticyclone, or some unusual chromophore is supplied from below via secondary circulation with the vortex itself. UV and infrared spectroscopy will be able to measure the aerosols and gaseous composition in the GRS compared to its surroundings, and to contrast this largest anticyclone to smaller white anticyclonic ovals (Anguiano-Arteaga et al. 2021). Furthermore, the GRS has been steadily shrinking from ∼40,000 km in 1879 to its current value of ∼15,000 km (Simon et al. 2018b), resulting in changes to its velocity field, vorticity, and temperature structure at the upper cloud level. Another large anticyclone, Oval BA, undergoes colour changes, from white to red and back again (Cheng et al. 2008a). By the early 2030s, JUICE will be able to assess any changes to velocities, vorticity, aerosol coverage and gaseous composition associated with these variable anticyclones.\n\nCyclones: Temporal variability is not just a feature of anticyclones. Cyclonic vortices come in diverse shapes and sizes, from elongated and quiescent brown barges, to chaotic ‘Folded Filamentary Regions’ (FFRs) at mid-to-high latitudes, to organised arrays of circumpolar (CPCs) and polar cyclones (PCs) at both poles (Fig. i). The connections between the dynamics of these different types of cyclones remains unclear, but cyclones do appear to promote moist convective activity (see Sect. 2.1.3), which may be partially responsible for the chaotic and ever-changing appearance of the FFRs. The CPCs and PCs revealed by Juno (Adriani et al. 2018a) challenge our understanding of Jupiter’s polar domain - an octagonal arrangement at the north pole, and a pentagonal (sometimes hexagonal) arrangement at the south pole, whose long-term stability reveals the dynamics of atmospheric turbulence and the ‘beta-drift’ of cyclones (Gavriel and Kaspi 2021). The inclined phase of JUICE, with sub-spacecraft latitude reaching up to 33∘, will provide a new glimpse of the polar domain, with its FFRs and polar cyclones, several years after the culmination of the Juno mission. Whilst the JUICE inclination (see Sect. ) does not match the polar orbit of Juno, it does provide a long-term vantage point to observe how these polar features move and change over daily or weekly timescales, and a broader infrared spectral range to study their aerosols and composition. Thus the JUICE mission will be able to ‘determine the three-dimensional properties of discrete atmospheric features at high spatial resolution and track them over time (e.g., Great Red Spot, vortices, atmospheric plumes, ‘brown barges’) (R1-J-6)’.\n\nConvective Storms and Lightning\n\nOn the smallest scales, the high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy of JUICE will be able study individual storm cloud features as a window onto moist convection in hydrogen-rich atmospheres. Although latent heat release at phase transitions can drive heat transport in atmospheres, the high molecular weight of condensates (compared to the hydrogen atmosphere) can have an inhibiting effect on convection, which must be overcome (Guillot 1995; Hueso et al. 2002; Leconte et al. 2017) to generate the storms that we see. Such storms may help to regulate heat flux through the tropospheric layers, and as such may play a role in the thermal evolution and banded structure of Jupiter.\n\nStorm plumes are observed as small white spots in dynamically-active domains (Fig. c), such as the centres of cyclonic vortices (Hueso et al. 2022), or the wake of the GRS (Baines et al. 2002). Individual cumulus-like clouds can be seen in Juno high-resolution imaging, often adding texture to larger-scale stratiform clouds. These cumulus clouds are most likely powered by the latent heat release of water condensation in the ∼6-bar region, providing enough buoyancy to rise through the hydrogen-rich air. Shallow convection, at altitudes too cold for liquid water and potentially associated with latent heat release in NH3-ice cloud layers, may also be occurring (Becker et al. 2020; Hueso et al. 2022), and the complex blend of water and ammonia ice may be forming slushy ‘mushballs,’ (Guillot et al. 2020a), which trap NH3 gas, precipitate, and then release their payload at several tens of bars (Guillot et al. 2020b). Thus convective motions, and associated precipitation, play a vital role in shaping the vertical structure of aerosols and gaseous composition, both on the largest scales (belts and zones) and smallest scales (surrounding individual storm plumes).\n\nRemote sensing from JUICE will examine these thunderstorms, determining the vertical aerosol structure in the upper troposphere, and the spatial distribution of volatiles (e.g., NH3 and H2O) and disequilibrium species (e.g., PH3, AsH3, GeH4, CO) as tracers of vertical motions. Spectroscopic maps in the UV and infrared will be compared to the morphology of the cumulus clouds at the highest spatial resolutions.\n\nJUICE will also examine the distribution and energetics of Jovian lightning, using nightside imaging to detect flashes (e.g., Borucki and Williams 1986; Little et al. 1999; Dyudina et al. 2004; Baines et al. 2007), and listening for radio emissions generated by electrical discharges in the Jovian atmosphere and propagating through the plasma environment. Using this technique during the first quarter of the Juno mission, the Waves instrument has made about two thousand lightning detections. This represents the largest data set on Jovian lightning processes collected to date. Close to Jupiter, low dispersion rapid whistlers occurred at frequencies from 50 Hz to 20 kHz (Kolmašová et al. 2018), and the so-called Jupiter dispersed pulses (JDPs) were recorded at frequencies between 10 kHz and 150 kHz (Imai et al. 2019). The rapid whistlers have dispersion from units of milliseconds to a few tens of milliseconds, and the dispersion of JDPs is even lower. The latter might propagate in the free space ordinary mode through low density regions in Jupiter’s ionosphere (Imai et al. 2019). The third kind of Jovian lightning radio bursts are long dispersion whistlers lasting for several seconds, which were previously detected at frequencies of several kHz in different regions of the Io torus between 5 and 6 Jovian radii using Voyager 2 measurements (Gurnett et al. 1979; Kurth et al. 1985). Due to the larger periapsis distances of JUICE (∼9 to 20 Jovian radii, see Sect. 3) compared to Juno or the Voyagers, it will be more difficult for JUICE RPWI to detect lightning radio pulses. However, lightning whistlers from very high latitudes as well as JDPs going through the ionospheric low-density patches might propagate that far and be recorded.\n\nIn Jupiter’s atmosphere, lightning activity is predicted to show the largest emission in the Hα line at 656-nm (Borucki et al. 1996). However, nightside emissions (Fig. d) of lightning observed by Galileo at 656-nm were ten times weaker than expected (Dyudina et al. 2013). This can be a consequence of deep lightning at pressures larger than a few bar. Shallow lightning on Jupiter at pressures near 1 bar were discovered by Juno at high latitudes (Becker et al. 2020) and might be brighter at 656-nm than in clear filters. Dayside lightning in Saturn was observed in blue wavelengths during a large-scale storm (Dyudina et al. 2013). Thus, searches of lightning in Jupiter’s atmosphere by JUICE will have to use a combination of filters to test different scenarios of depth and intensity of the lightning. Furthermore, JUICE will search for Transient Luminous Events (TLEs) in the ultraviolet from the night side in Jupiter’s upper atmosphere (Giles et al. 2020b). Although lightning statistics from Galileo had suggested that lightning was predominantly found within the Jovian belts (Gierasch et al. 2000), Juno observations of microwave sferics and rapid whistlers indicated increased lightning activity at the middle and higher latitudes (Brown et al. 2018; Kolmašová et al. 2018). These distributions of lightning activity provides constraints on moist convection and the deep abundance of water (Yair et al. 1998; Sugiyama et al. 2014; Li and Ingersoll 2015). JUICE will therefore re-examine the relationships between the distribution of lightning and the distribution of cumulus-like clouds, and ‘determine the influence of moist convective processes by mapping the frequency, distribution and depth of tropospheric lightning (R1-J-7).’\n\nTropospheric Waves\n\nJupiter’s atmosphere exhibits wave phenomena at a variety of scales, each providing a means of characterising the background atmosphere through which they propagate. Longitudinal waves and curvilinear structures have been observed at the smallest scales of Galileo orbiter (Arregi et al. 2009) and Juno imaging (Orton et al. 2020), and interpreted to be gravity (i.e., buoyancy waves in a stably-stratified atmosphere) or inertia-gravity waves (i.e., sensing the Coriolis effect). Mesoscale waves modulating cloud opacity and reflectivity, often found in regions of cyclogenesis, have been observed by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST, Fig. e), Juno, and ground-based telescopes (Fletcher et al. 2018; Simon et al. 2018a). And larger planetary-scale waves have been observed at low latitudes, including the equatorially-trapped Rossby wave responsible for the chain of 5-μm hotspots (visibly-dark formations, Fig. f) on the jet separating the NEB and EZ (Allison 1990; Arregi et al. 2006), and the large-scale thermal waves that often occur over the NEB during periods of expansion and contraction (Fletcher et al. 2017a). Large-scale wave motions were recorded as movies by Cassini over two months in late 2000 (e.g., Choi et al. 2013). The polar regions are covered by high hazes that stand out in images taken in methane absorption filters and in the ultraviolet, with their edge at about 65 deg latitude undulating with wavenumber 12 (Fig. j, Sánchez-Lavega et al. 1998; Barrado-Izagirre et al. 2008). These Rossby waves, which require a gradient of the Coriolis parameter as the restoring force, are known to modulate aerosol reflectivity and upper tropospheric temperatures, but as yet the distribution of gaseous species and their phase speeds remains unclear.\n\nUnderstanding the origins of the waves (e.g., from instabilities, or arising from convection, or some other means) and the deposition of energy during wave breaking (providing or removing momentum from the zonal flows) requires assessment of their motions. Measuring the phase velocities of waves requires long-term imaging and cloud tracking, with timescales tuned to the phenomenon of interest. A JUICE requirement was therefore to ‘classify the wave activity in the Jovian atmosphere, both horizontally (multi-spectral imaging) and vertically (R1-J-11).’ We will return to the influence of wave phenomena on the stratosphere and upper atmosphere in the following sections, as a means to couple the meteorology of the troposphere with the circulations at higher altitudes.\n\nChemistry and Circulation in the Middle Atmosphere\n\nThe previous section described JUICE requirements for remote sensing of the troposphere, at the interface between the deep interior and the cloud-forming regions accessible to multi-wavelength observations. However, a key strength of JUICE is its ability to probe the radiatively-controlled middle atmosphere, namely the stratosphere above the tropopause. Here the stratified thermal structure is determined by a radiative balance (e.g., Guerlet et al. 2020) between heating (absorption by CH4 gas and aerosols) and cooling (thermal emission from ethane, acetylene, and to a lesser extent CH4), and UV photolysis of methane generates a complex network of hydrocarbon species (Moses et al. 2005) with emission features throughout the mid-infrared. The JUICE remote sensing payload is required to ‘characterise the three-dimensional temperature structure of the upper troposphere, stratosphere, and thermosphere (R1-J-9.5),’ enabling a comprehensive study of the Jovian middle atmosphere.\n\nStratospheric Temperatures: Jupiter’s stratospheric circulation exhibits similar zonal organisation as the troposphere, with bands of warmer and cooler regions revealed via thermal imaging (Fig. ). The zonal organisation is strongest at low-latitudes, where Jupiter’s equatorial stratospheric oscillation (often referred to as the Quasi-Quadrennial Oscillation, or QQO, Leovy et al. 1991; Orton et al. 1991) modulates the 10-mbar thermal contrasts at the equator on a ∼4-year timescale. Mid-infrared spectroscopy revealed that this is associated with a downward-moving chain of warm and cool anomalies (and associated changes in stratospheric zonal jets, Flasar et al. 2004; Cosentino et al. 2017a; Giles et al. 2020a), but long-term monitoring reveals that its period and phase can be substantially perturbed by tropospheric upheavals (Antuñano et al. 2021). The vertical structure of this pattern, which is thought to be driven by waves emanating from the troposphere and interacting with the mean flow (Friedson 1999), can be sounded via emission in the sub-millimetre (Cavalié et al. 2021; Benmahi et al. 2021), particularly with CH4 and H2O from the lower stratosphere up to 10 μbar, but also via occultations - radio occultations as JUICE passes behind Jupiter as seen from Earth, and stellar/solar occultations as a star or the Sun sets behind the Jovian limb (e.g., Greathouse et al. 2010). These techniques will reveal the vertical structure of the QQO. Given the expected longevity of JUICE, the pattern of stacked wind/temperature anomalies will be monitored during their descent, sampling a full ∼4-year period over the duration of the mission.\n\nGaseous Tracers: Moving to mid-latitudes, the stratosphere again demonstrates coupling to the underlying troposphere. The spatial distribution of stratospheric acetylene is asymmetric between the northern and southern hemisphere (Nixon et al. 2010; Fletcher et al. 2016; Melin et al. 2018), possibly due to a difference in the strength of vertical mixing, rather than differences in the efficiency of photochemical production. Furthermore, significant stratospheric thermal wave activity, likely to be near-stationary Rossby waves, are often reported in the northern hemisphere (Fletcher et al. 2017a) where the acetylene is at its maximum. Ultraviolet spectra from Juno, which exhibit strong C2H2 absorption, reveal that this abundance declines strongly towards the poles, as expected from the annually-averaged solar insolation, also indicating that horizontal equator-to-pole mixing is not strong enough to distribute C2H2 uniformly with latitude (Nixon et al. 2007; Giles et al. 2021b). On the other hand, the meridional distribution of C2H6 does not follow the mean solar insolation and increases towards the poles (Nixon et al. 2007), and altitude-latitude advective transport models cannot reproduce these C2H2 and C2H6 distributions (Hue et al. 2018).\n\nRecent observations of the polar regions have revealed an even more complex situation, in which the distributions of C2Hx species are not zonal. Local enhancements in abundances are correlated with the location of the diffuse auroras (Sinclair et al. 2017a, 2018, 2019). Other species, like HCN and CO2, also show enhancements/depletion in the polar and auroral regions (Lellouch et al. 2006; Cavalié et al. 2023b). This is a strong indication that auroral chemistry plays an important role in these regions. Thermal-infrared observations of the polar stratosphere and upper troposphere reveal cold polar vortices (Simon-Miller et al. 2006; Fletcher et al. 2016), possibly as a consequence of efficient radiative cooling from polar aerosols (Guerlet et al. 2020), for which C2 species are probable precursors. However, tying the aerosol distribution observed in reflected sunlight directly to the thermal structure will remain a challenge, particularly as a consequence of auroral heating discussed in Sect. 2.4.2. JUICE will investigate the thermal structure of the stratosphere via sub-millimetre sounding, as well as the distribution of tracers like C2H2 and C2H6 via UV spectroscopy (these hydrocarbons have signatures in the FUV below 180 nm, Gladstone and Yung 1983). It will also study the distribution of species deposited by Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 (SL9) like HCN, CO, CS and H2O in the sub-millimetre (e.g., Lellouch et al. 1995b; Feuchtgruber et al. 1997), to understand the middle-atmospheric circulation, from the equatorial QQO, to the mid-latitude waves, to the polar domain.\n\nStratospheric Winds: The global stratospheric temperature field, and the distributions of hydrocarbons, are just two ingredients required for understanding the global circulation. Measurements of winds in the Jovian stratosphere have presented a challenge, given the absence of identifiable cloud tracers to monitor the flows at millibar pressures. Indirect determinations via stratospheric temperature gradients and the thermal wind equation (Flasar et al. 2004; Read et al. 2006) are subject to substantial uncertainties, because there is an altitude gap of two scale heights between the level where the cloud-top winds are used as initial condition (in the upper troposphere), and the levels where the winds are derived (in the stratosphere). Direct and absolute measurement of stratospheric winds relies on high-resolution spectroscopy to reveal the Doppler shifts of individual sub-millimetre emission lines, recently demonstrated using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) (Cavalié et al. 2021; Benmahi et al. 2022). The winds are measured at the levels probed by the spectral lines, usually in the middle stratosphere with the sensitivity of ALMA. The derivation of the full stratospheric wind field then requires near-simultaneous temperature measurements to be combined with the wind observations using the thermal wind equation, as shown in Benmahi et al. (2021). Although it is an essential piece to constrain general circulation models and quasi-periodic stratospheric oscillations like Jupiter’s QQO (see Fig. ), such a combination has only been obtained once in ten years of ALMA operations. The JUICE payload will enable the first maps of stratospheric winds, using emission from CH4, H2O, CO, HCN and CS lines. Here we take advantage of an influx of chemical species from exogenic sources, such as long-lived oxygen-bearing species (H2O, CO2, and CO), HCN, and CS, many of which were deposited by the impact of the SL9 comet in 1994 (Lellouch et al. 1995a; Harrington et al. 2004) and have been slowly diffusing with latitude ever since (Moreno et al. 2003; Lellouch et al. 2006). High-resolution and high-sensitivity spectroscopy of these emission lines enables simultaneous sounding of stratospheric temperatures and direct wind measurements in the 10 μbar to 100 mbar range, with scale-height resolution, a first for an orbiting spacecraft. Combining sub-millimetre sounding, performed every orbit for the entire JUICE tour, with UV, IR and radio occultations will provide significant opportunities for synergistic science for stratospheric circulation (see Sect. 5), with the goal to ‘globally determine the vertical structure of zonal, meridional and vertical winds (R1-J-5).’\n\nGlobal Composition and Origins\n\nThe origin and migration of Jupiter played a central role in shaping the present-day configuration of our Solar System. Its bulk chemical composition (in comparison to that of the Sun) provides a window on the composition of the protosolar nebula at the time of planet formation (Atreya et al. 2003; Lunine et al. 2004; Venturini and Helled 2020). JUICE does not aim to reproduce the Juno capabilities of probing the bulk NH3 (Li et al. 2017) and H2O (Li et al. 2020) content of Jupiter’s deep interior, nor will it perform gravity sounding of the zonal flows and density gradients in the hot and fluid interior (e.g., the diffuse core extending up to 50% of Jupiter’s radius into the overlying molecular envelope, Wahl et al. 2017). Furthermore, the picture of a relatively homogeneous hydrogen-helium envelope, mixed by efficient convection associated with its high intrinsic luminosity (e.g., Guillot et al. 2004; Li et al. 2018) is no longer suitable, with a gradient in heavier elements being more likely. However, JUICE will contribute to our understanding of Jupiter’s atmospheric composition from the cloud-forming region and upwards, and is specifically required to ‘provide estimates of elemental abundances and isotopic ratios in the atmospheric envelope to constrain the composition of the deep troposphere and the origin of external material (R1-J-9),’ as woll be discussed below.\n\nTropospheric Composition and Origins\n\nThermochemistry in a strongly-reducing environment leads to the most cosmogonically abundant elements (C, N, O, S, P) appearing in their hydrogenated forms (CH4, NH3, H2O, H2S, PH3). At the low temperatures of the upper troposphere, the volatile compounds will condense to form clouds (ices of NH3 and H2O, and a combination reaction to form NH4SH, Weidenschilling and Lewis 1973), such that the main reservoirs for these gases are hidden at depth below the clouds. Furthermore, Juno has revealed that NH3 is not well-mixed even below its ∼700-mbar cloud base, remaining variable and depleted down to ∼60 bars (Ingersoll et al. 2017; Li et al. 2017). Spectroscopic measurements from JUICE will sound the abundances above, within, and immediately below the cloud-formation levels. At these altitudes, the abundances are governed by a combination of vertical mixing, saturation, and photolytic destruction (e.g., NH3 is photolysed to form N2H4, a possible contributor to aerosols in the upper troposphere). JUICE contributions are therefore likely to be lower limits for tropospheric volatile enrichments N/H, S/H and O/H. Nevertheless, mapping the latitudinal variability of these species (in relation to the belt/zone structure), and observing how they vary with time, places bulk measurements of these gases into a wider context, to understand how representative they might be of the planet as a whole.\n\nSimilarly, disequilibrium species like PH3, AsH3, GeH4 and tropospheric CO can be studied via combination of UV and 4.0-5.7 μm spectroscopy. These species are only present in the upper troposphere as the rate of vertical mixing is faster than the rate of their thermochemical destruction, leading to ‘quenched’ abundances that are representative of deeper, kilobar levels (Kaye and Strobel 1984). Their spatial and temporal variability therefore provides estimates of elemental abundances of P/H, As/H, and Ge/H that would be otherwise inaccessible. Furthermore, tropospheric PH3 and CO are limited by chemical reactions with water, providing an indirect means of estimating the deep water abundance via thermochemistry (Bézard et al. 2002; Visscher et al. 2010; Cavalié et al. 2023a). Thus, JUICE can provide indirect constraints on deep elemental abundances, without actually sampling below the cloud-forming layers.\n\nThe ratios of isotopes within a particular molecule can also reveal insights into the nature of its original reservoirs, and the proportion of ices incorporated into the forming protoplanets. In particular, Jupiter’s deuterium-to-hydrogen (D/H) ratio can be measured in methane (Owen and Encrenaz 2003), using absorption features of CH3D in the 4.0-5.7 μm range. Separating CH3D abundances from the properties of aerosols is challenging, and will rely on the techniques described in Sect. 2.1.1, exploiting reflected sunlight observations under multiple illumination conditions and geometries. Nevertheless, the JUICE estimate of D/H in methane can then be compared to estimates of the D/H in hydrogen (Lellouch et al. 2001) to understand the fractionation of deuterium between different molecules. It will also be compared to the direct in situ measurement from the Galileo probe (Mahaffy et al. 2000), to assess how well that measurement represents the global composition of Jupiter.\n\nStratospheric Composition and Evolution\n\nJupiter’s stratospheric composition is determined by photochemistry of methane (which does not condense at Jovian temperatures), alongside the influx of exogenic species from interplanetary dust, bolides and larger impactors (asteroids and comets) entering the upper atmosphere (Moses et al. 2005; Hue et al. 2018). As described in Sect. 2.2, JUICE remote sensing will be able to map the spatial distribution of stratospheric hydrocarbons, primarily C2H2 and C2H6 in the UV (Melin et al. 2020; Giles et al. 2021b, 2023; Sinclair et al. 2023) as well as CH3C2H in the sub-millimetre. An additional goal is to ‘constrain the origin of external material (R1-J-9)’ via measurements of abundances and isotopic ratios in externally sourced materials. This includes species like H2O, CS, CO and HCN originating from the cometary impact (SL9) in 1994. The latitudinal distribution of these species is expected to be governed by stratospheric circulation and diffusion since the time of impact (Moreno et al. 2003; Lellouch et al. 2006), but additional ongoing sources of exogenic materials (e.g., interplanetary dust, connections with Jupiter’s rings, or with satellites via magnetic field lines) could be determined via new spatial maps acquired by JUICE in the sub-millimetre (e.g., Connerney 1986; Moses and Poppe 2017). The vertical profiles of H2O and CO can be mapped with scale-height resolution, providing an indication of the origin of the external oxygen.\n\nJUICE has another technique to determine the origin of these exogenic species - high spectral-resolution observations in the sub-millimetre will provide estimates of isotopic ratios in those molecules, for comparison with the wider Jovian environment. Examples include D/H, 16O/18O, 16O/17O in water and CO; 12C/13C in CO; and 12C/13C and 15N/14N in HCN, each of which may allow us to connect Jupiter’s stratospheric species back to source populations in comets and other icy bodies. For example, if Jupiter’s external water originates from interplanetary dust particles and if these particles would enter the planet with slow velocities (so as not to be dissociated by the heat generated during atmospheric entry), then we would expect to find cometary D/H ratios in H2O, i.e. 1–8×10−4 (Anderson et al. 2022). Conversely, if the water were produced by comet impacts and would thus result from the recombination of cometary oxygen with Jovian hydrogen, then the water would exhibit a Jupiter-like D/H ratio, i.e. ∼2×10−5 (Lellouch et al. 2001). By comparing the potential origins of stratospheric species with what is known of Jupiter’s global composition, JUICE will be able to place new constraints on the formation and subsequent evolution of the gas giant.\n\nFinally, JUICE may be lucky and glimpse examples of ongoing evolution in stratospheric composition. The rate of impacts is being refined by Earth-based video monitoring of flashes in the Jovian atmosphere (Hueso et al. 2018b), revealing bolide flashes (i.e., impactors disintegrating in the upper atmosphere) at a detectable rate estimated to be 0.4-2.6 per year. Juno UVS has detected an impactor from orbit, and considering the probabilities of capturing such an event in a UVS scan, estimated a rate that was considerably higher (Giles et al. 2021a). Larger impactors, such as the 1994 Comet Shoemaker Levy 9 (Harrington et al. 2004), or the 2009 ‘Wesley’ asteroidal impactor (Sánchez-Lavega et al. 2009; Hammel et al. 2010), remain much rarer (Zahnle et al. 2003). Each of these events may have observable consequences for atmospheric composition (injecting water and silicate-rich materials, and producing high-temperature shock chemistry within the entry point), and the likelihood of tracking impactors in advance will improve with the commissioning of the forthcoming Vera Rubin observatory (see Sect. 6). The flexibility and agility of the JUICE spacecraft to react to unique (and potentially unexpected) events will be discussed in Sect. 3.\n\nEnergetics of the Ionosphere, Thermosphere, and Auroras\n\nBeyond the dynamics of the troposphere, and the circulation and chemistry of the stratosphere, JUICE will explore the interface between the neutral atmosphere and the external charged-particle environment. Jupiter’s ionosphere and thermosphere epitomises the JUICE goal of exploring coupling between components of the Jovian system, being influenced by the circulation and wave propagation of the lower atmosphere, and the deposition of energy in the polar region via electrons propagating along magnetic field lines. Particle and fields in situ measurements, by PEP, RPWI and J-MAG, will directly monitor the energy and momentum exchange processes in the magnetosphere responsible for these energetic auroral particles impacting the atmosphere (cf. Masters et al. 2024). This gives the electromagnetic energy flux and exact energy distributions flowing downward along the field lines, and can be compared to the auroral emissions detected in the atmosphere at various wavelengths. It will also put further constraints on the ionization, related ion-molecule and thermosphere aerosol formation chemistry, and thermal altitude profiles in the Jovian ionosphere, and electrodynamic processes that contribute to the atmosphere thermal balance. The locations of the auroral electron acceleration regions and radio emissions from atmospheric lightning can furthermore be remotely monitored by radio wave detections by RPWI.\n\nAbove the methane homopause, solar EUV and auroral precipitation shape a region comprising H2, He and H. The ionosphere is formed from layers of thermal plasma embedded in the neutral atmosphere, from EUV/XUV ionisation or impact ionisation from high-energy precipitating particles. JUICE will explore this upper atmospheric region by means of (i) both radio occultations and stellar occultations to determine electron densities (from refraction and Doppler frequency shifting) and the temperature structure of the neutral atmosphere; and via (ii) imaging spectroscopy (UV and infrared emissions from H2, H, and the H3+ ion) from the auroral regions to low latitudes. Direct measurements of stratospheric winds via sub-millimetre Doppler shifts of spectral lines will also provide constraints on the winds in this region (see Sect. 5).\n\nThermospheric Circulation and the Energy Crisis\n\nFrom stellar occultations and observations of the H3+ ion (generated on the dayside via the reaction of H2 with H2+ produced by the ionisation of H2 under solar Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) radiation, Drossart et al. 1989), it is known that Jupiter’s upper atmosphere and exosphere at low to mid-latitudes are systematically far hotter than can be explained by solar heating alone (Yelle and Miller 2004), a conundrum known as the ‘energy crisis.’ The auroral regions are bombarded by electrons that cover a broad range of energies, with low energy electrons (eVs) mainly contributing to heating the atmosphere, and the more energetic ones (100 eV and above) producing excitation, ionization, dissociation and subsequent auroral emissions, chemistry, and heating. However, thermospheric circulation models (e.g., Achilleos et al. 1998; Yates et al. 2020) suggest that the strong Coriolis forces associated with Jupiter’s rapid rotation should trap this energy at high latitudes. However, recent H3+ observations during a potential solar wind compression event have revealed a steady decrease in temperature from the auroral regions to the equator, confirming the potential redistribution of energy from high to lower latitude regions (O’Donoghue et al. 2021). This heating possibly occurs in pulses associated with a solar-wind compression, which facilitates the transport of heat to lower latitudes (Yates et al. 2014). Additional sources of heating from below (e.g., dissipation of gravity and acoustic waves propagating from the troposphere) may contribute to low-latitude variability in H3+ emission (Schubert et al. 2003), such as the possible excess heating over the Great Red Spot (O’Donoghue et al. 2016). Such sources, localised and sporadic, also contribute to the highly structured and variable H3+ density profile in altitude (Matcheva et al. 2001). Furthermore, heating not only expands the atmosphere but can also drive vertical winds and affect turbulence. The location of the homopause, below which the main atmospheric species are well mixed and above which there is a diffusive separation of species by mass, is hence a tracer of energy deposition and dynamics.\n\nRemote sensing by JUICE will ‘characterise the three-dimensional temperature structure of the … thermosphere (R1-J-9.5)’. Vertically propagating waves observed in occultations throughout the atmosphere in the IR and the UV will be directly correlated with potential sources in the lower atmosphere (e.g., moist convective events and plumes) to understand their contribution to the energy budget. The combination of UV and IR occultations is a powerful means to characterise Jupiter’s atmospheric vertical structure and composition, the dynamical coupling between layers, and the source of energy sources in the upper atmosphere. They will be complemented by measurements of the stratospheric windfield by SWI, and radio occultations (e.g., Gupta et al. 2022). In addition, UV observations will be critical to derive the global variations of the homopause in terms of height and eddy diffusion coefficient, characterising the amount of mixing, based on hydrocarbon tangential column densities from multiple UV stellar occultations, complemented by dayglow HeI 58.4 nm resonance line observations (e.g., Parkinson et al. 2006, Vervack et al. 1995). Temperature profiles associated with H2 can be derived from solar and stellar occultations in the UV (Koskinen et al. 2015). Furthermore, UV dayglow maps could help to identify the origin of the H Lyman alpha bulge, its possible connection with the auroral activity or with thermospheric/exospheric circulation, and its relation of any possible longitudinal asymmetry in HeI 58.4 nm.\n\nJupiter’s Auroras\n\nBefore the Juno mission, the main emissions (shown in Fig. ) were thought to be due to co-rotation breakdown in the middle magnetosphere, with emissions related to upward currents (Cowley and Bunce 2001) from the auroral ionosphere. Juno observations have shown that particles and plasma wave phenomena are tightly linked in Jupiter’s low-altitude auroral regions (Kurth et al. 2018; Bonfond et al. 2021; Sulaiman et al. 2022), where different latitudinally separated zones are linked to upward (zone I) and downward (zone II) electric currents (Mauk et al. 2020). Kurth et al. (2018) showed that the electron distributions and significant density depletions corresponding to zone I are coincident with brief but very intense broadband plasma waves propagating downward in the whistler mode at frequencies below 10 kHz. Sulaiman et al. (2022) identified H+ / H3+ cyclotron waves in zone I in the presence of energetic upward H+ beams and downward energetic electron beams, and large-amplitude solitary waves in zone II. Juno has also detected evidence of large-scale electrostatic potentials above the main aurora, with broad electron energy distributions (Allegrini et al. 2020). Hence, we still probably lack a complete understanding of all the phenomena that produce the aurora.\n\nThe variable magnetic footprints of Io, Europa, and Ganymede are visible equatorward of the main oval (Fig. , Grodent et al. 2008), associated with Alfvén, ion cyclotron, and whistler mode waves (Sulaiman et al. 2020), but the complex nature of their morphology and hence of the moon-plasma interaction, revealed by Juno close-in observations (Mura et al. 2018), is still to be fully understood. A magnetic footprint of Callisto was tentatively observed by Bhattacharyya et al. (2018) and further observations are necessary to confirm it. Interior to the main oval, the acceleration of charged particles may be responsible for the fluctuating polar-cap aurora (e.g., Grodent et al. 2003), with signatures of flares associated with magnetic reconnection on the dayside magnetopause being observed (e.g., Ebert et al. 2017), but the debate about whether the polar region is open or closed to the solar magnetic flux remains unresolved. These auroral signatures, from the polar cap, to the main oval and satellite footprints, are all highly variable on timescales of minutes and hours (Clarke et al. 2004); signatures of possible substorm-like injections have been proposed (Bonfond et al. 2021). Greathouse et al. (2021) reported that the bright polar emissions observed by the HST and Juno UVS on the day side dim substantially or disappear between midnight and dawn. The JUICE UVS will have extended periods of time to scan the aurora on the night side to study this dimming in more detail, especially during the high inclination phase. Long-term HST imaging programmes (Nichols et al. 2009; Clarke et al. 2009; Nichols et al. 2017), as well as Juno IR and UV imaging (Mura et al. 2017; Bonfond et al. 2017), have provided substantial increases in our understanding of auroral morphology. In particular, the comparison between UV and IR is crucial to understand the complexity of the auroral-related energization processes (Gérard et al. 2018, 2023), but a long-term programme of JUICE auroral monitoring will provide vantage points that are not possible from Earth-based facilities.\n\nVisible light studies with JANUS will greatly enhance our understanding of the aurora in this wavelength range, which, unlike the IR and UV emission, cannot be observed on the dayside of Jupiter, thus ruling out studies from the Earth or its vicinity. Limited visible light observations by the Galileo solid-state imaging (SSI) system (e.g. Fig. ) captured several classes of auroral features from a survey of the northern auroral region (Vasavada et al. 1999). These included a continuous primary arc a few hundred km wide, observed at around 245 km above the 1-bar level. This varied in morphology with local time between a single arc and a multiply-branched feature. A variable secondary arc, associated with the region just beyond Io’s torus was also visible, plus a diffuse “polar cap” emission. A spot and tail associated with the magnetic footprint of Io was also observed. As the visible emission is too faint for Juno’s JunoCam, JANUS will provide unprecedented data, at spatial resolutions as small as tens of km per pixel, and occasionally at high cadence, allowing the dynamics of these features to be captured.\n\nThe vertical structure of the auroral curtain, and its spectral properties, have been explored at high spatial resolution in the ultraviolet (Bonfond et al. 2017; Mauk et al. 2020), infrared (Adriani et al. 2017; Dinelli et al. 2017) and visible (Vasavada et al. 1999), which sense different altitudes and chemical compounds. With JANUS and MAJIS imagery at perijove, along with MAJIS and UVS occultations, JUICE will study the dynamic auroras in three dimensions and their temporal evolution.\n\nAuroral Coupling to the Stratosphere: Ion-neutral chemistry at high latitudes may be responsible for the unusual nature of upper tropospheric and stratospheric aerosols in the polar hazes (Friedson et al. 2002; Wong et al. 2000), possibly fractal aggregates (Li et al. 2013) that are numerous and reflective in the infrared (Barrado-Izagirre et al. 2008), and dark and absorbent in the ultraviolet. Remote sensing in the UV and infrared will characterise the composition and scattering properties of these polar hazes, to understand their asymmetric properties between the northern and southern poles, and their influence on radiative balance. The consequences of auroral heating are visible at stratospheric altitudes (e.g., Sinclair et al. 2018), possibly via direct Joule heating or radiative effects in the auroral-associated hazes. Sub-millimetre observations will enable joint measurements of stratospheric temperatures and winds within these auroral zones, to assess the penetration levels of auroral energy into the stratosphere. Measuring the distributions of species like C2H2 and C2H6 (e.g., Sinclair et al. 2018, 2023; Giles et al. 2023), H2O, HCN and CO2 (Benmahi et al. 2020; Cavalié et al. 2023b; Lellouch et al. 2006), will also help shed light on chemistry occurring in the auroral regions, like aerosol production (Perry et al. 1999; Wong et al. 2000, 2003; Friedson et al. 2002) and heterogeneous chemistry involving them (Perrin et al. 2021).\n\nJUICE is required to ‘investigate the unique atmospheric properties of Jupiter’s polar regions, including the influence of auroral energy deposition and ion chemistry on the atmospheric temperatures, energy budget, chemistry and cloud/ haze formation (R1-J-4)’. As we discuss in Sect. 3, the JUICE tour enables a long-term study of the Jovian auroras across multiple wavelengths, with observations tuned to the timescales of the various phenomena, observing variable emissions over minutes, hours and days as the conditions within the solar wind fluctuate. The auroras will be particularly scrutinised as JUICE reaches higher orbital inclinations.\n\nSummary of Objectives\n\nThe JUICE science case is summarised by the eleven objectives listed in Table , and by the boldface science requirements included in the text above. The requirements state that the mission ‘shall have the capability to investigate the spatial variability of Jovian dynamics, chemistry and atmospheric structure in three dimensions (R1-J-1)’, and must provide ‘long-term time-domain investigations of atmospheric processes over 2+ years, with a frequency tuned to the timescales of interest (R1-J-2).’ To do so, JUICE ‘must support global and regional spectroscopic mapping of the sources and sinks of key atmospheric species tracing atmospheric circulation and chemistry with spatial resolution <200 km/px in the VIS-NIR range, <1000 km in UV and with about a scale height vertical and 2000-4000 km horizontal resolution in the sub-millimeter range, repeated over a range of timescales from days to years (R1-J-8).’ All other science requirements (R1-J-1 to J-11) are recorded in the previous sections. An overarching theme of the JUICE science case is that the different regimes (the interior, atmospheric layers, and magnetosphere) are not decoupled from one another, so cannot be investigated in isolation - JUICE will explore the connections between all of the components within this system. We now turn to how the payload and Jupiter tour have been designed to meet these objectives.\n\nJUICE Tour: Jupiter Observing Opportunities\n\nTo meet the Level-1 science requirements described in Sect. 2, Level-2 requirements on the mission and spacecraft design were identified (Science Requirements Document JUI-EST-SGS-RS-001). To summarise those relevant to Jupiter science, the mission and spacecraft were designed to:\n\nSupport inertial pointing for solar and stellar occultations […] in orbit around Jupiter.\n\nSupport nadir and off-nadir pointing for imaging.\n\nSupport raster pointing for Jupiter […] when objects are larger than fields of view.\n\nSupport a spot-tracking mode for Jupiter.\n\nPerform limb tracking manoeuvre during radio occultations of Jupiter.\n\nSupport instrument pointing needs according to [their] requirements.\n\nProvide sufficient temporal coverage for Jovian atmospheric and magnetospheric science, [with a] Jovian tour [that] shall be at least 2.5 years.\n\nStart Jupiter atmosphere observations 6 months before the Jupiter Orbit Insertion and continue during the Ganymede phase.\n\nProvide an orbit with inclination of at least 30∘ with respect to the Jupiter equatorial plane.\n\nCo-align the boresights of instruments JANUS, MAJIS, UVS, GALA and SWI.\n\nProvide repeated observations of the same latitudes and cloud features with frequencies tuned to the timescales of interest (hours to months).\n\nEnable complete latitudinal, phase angle and local solar time coverage of Jupiter by remote sensing instruments.\n\nProvide at least two opportunities for remote sensing of Jupiter during the Europa phase when the distance to Jupiter is at a minimum.\n\nReact on short timescales to new and unexpected events in the Jovian atmosphere, such as major storms or impacts. JUICE pointing can be updated up to one week in advance, and commanding up to 3 days before the uplink, both in exceptional cases.\n\nEnable sounding of the Jovian atmosphere in radio-, stellar and solar occultations at all latitudes, repeating observations at regular times during the mission.\n\nProvide capabilities for (1) global mosaics/scans of Jupiter repeated once every 2.5 hours to build up 360-degree longitude coverage during a ten-hour rotation, and (2) repetitive imaging of discrete cloud features/ region with hourly frequency for cloud feature tracking while the feature transits from west to east (full rotation in 10 hours), repeated on subsequent rotations.\n\nEnable joint observation campaigns with remote sensing instruments (submm, IR, visible and UV), as well as ENA and Radio observations for the study of the auroral region of Jupiter, as well as the coupling between the Galilean satellites, the Jovian magnetosphere, and the high latitude regions of Jupiter (thermosphere, ionosphere and magnetosphere).\n\nThe JUICE orbital tour of the Jovian system is described by Boutonnet et al. (2024), and was designed to meet these requirements and enable the activities of the comprehensive payload discussed in Sect. 4. The JUICE orbit differs substantially from that of Juno, enabling global views over longer duration from a low-inclination orbit, and with an inclined phase offering high-resolution views of the southern hemisphere. Unlike Juno, JUICE does not spin, therefore simplifying some of the remote sensing observation sequences described in Sect. 4. Here we briefly describe the different phases of the tour of interest to Jupiter science, which are shown in Figs. and .\n\nPhase One begins some six months before Jupiter Orbit Insertion (JOI) in July 2031 according to the Crema 5.0 (Consolidated report on mission analysis) trajectory, and encompasses the first elliptical orbit around Jupiter until February 2032. The long approach to Jupiter will permit atmospheric monitoring and the generation of low-resolution movies, with the spatial resolution afforded by the JANUS camera exceeding the 150 km/pixel of the HST WFC3 instrument some 11.0 days before JOI and will exceed JWST spatial resolution at 8.5 days before JOI, respectively (see Fig. ). For much of the long first orbit, the resolution will be 200-300 km/pixel, enabling global monitoring of atmospheric phenomena. Higher-resolution observations begin in earnest in Phase Two, between February and June 2032, as the JUICE orbital energy is reduced. Five close flybys of Jupiter occur during this phase (perijoves 2-6, with perijove 1 being orbit insertion in July 2031), and provide the first real opportunity to test the JUICE remote sensing investigations with distances down to 11–13 RJ from Jupiter (Fig. ). Jupiter remote sensing will work in tandem with satellite remote sensing and magnetospheric measurements during this period, with four Ganymede flybys and one Callisto flyby during Phase 2.\n\nPhase Three provides the highest spatial-resolution Jupiter observations of the entire tour, as JUICE performs two close flybys of Europa in July 2032. Although much of the spacecraft resources and data volume will be dedicated to the Europa encounters, Jupiter science activities will aim to take advantage of these high-resolution opportunities at perijove 7 and 8 (9.4 RJ from Jupiter).\n\nFollowing the Europa encounters, JUICE then uses multiple flybys of Callisto to increase its orbital inclination up to ≳33∘ during Phase Four, the inclined phase between July 2032 and August 2033 (Fig. c). With ∼23 perijoves during this period, with distances ranging from 11-20 RJ from Jupiter, JUICE will be afforded with improved views of the atmosphere and auroras in the polar domains. The maximum orbit inclination will be attained between December 2032 and February 2033 and the highest sub-spacecraft latitude at perijove of ≳33∘ will be reached in May-June 2033 (perijoves 26 and 27). JUICE will spend more than 6 months with an orbit more inclined than 30∘. Furthermore, JUICE closest approaches and highest spatial resolutions during the inclined phase will be in the southern hemisphere, complementing the northern-hemisphere perijoves of Juno’s extended mission.\n\nAs JUICE returns to the equatorial plane, it commences the low-energy Phase Five, circularising the orbit and providing perijoves that are much more frequent, approximately every two weeks between August 2033 (perijove 32) and December 2034 (perijove 67). Spatial resolutions of visible images match those of the best Galileo images (10 to 40 km/pixel) throughout this phase, with closest approaches varying between 12-20 RJ before reaching Ganymede’s orbit at 15 RJ. Fewer satellite encounters are envisaged during this period (four for Callisto, seven for Ganymede), leaving a number of uninterrupted orbits for Jupiter science. Finally, in December 2034, JUICE enters orbit around Ganymede, with Phase Six completing its primary mission by September 2035. Short time periods during the Ganymede orbital phase will be devoted to the monitoring of Jupiter’s atmosphere, following up on dynamical, chemical, and meteorological phenomena discovered during Phases 1 through 5.\n\nSegmentation of the Tour\n\nGiven the wide-ranging objectives of JUICE, and the wealth of opportunities provided by the orbital tour, a preliminary architecture for scientific operations and scheduling had to be developed so that requirements on spacecraft resources (telemetry, power, pointing, etc.) could be better understood. Each scientific discipline, including Jupiter science, evaluated the observing opportunities during the tour. This included identifying repeated observations of the Jovian atmosphere and auroras, time-critical opportunities for occultations (radio, stellar, and solar), and any unique observational geometries for Jupiter science. Having identified optimal windows of observations for all disciplines, a preliminary ‘level-0’ segmentation plan for the tour was developed, with specific disciplines being assigned the lead for pointing/operations during different segments. Jupiter science segments had to be balanced against opportunities for magnetospheric science, satellite encounters (typically within a ±12-hour window around closest approach to a moon), windows for data downlink (typically 8 hours per day), and other segments for navigation, calibration, and distant investigations of the wider Jovian system. An example is shown in Fig. for PJ12 in September 2032. Operations will naturally be more complex during the Jupiter tour, with instruments operating simultaneously (i.e., riding along) during science segments devoted to other disciplines. Potential disruption of the established observation plan may occur with a time response of a few days only in case of e.g. unexpected events like large asteroid or comet impacts. Nevertheless, this approach enabled a thorough assessment of JUICE’s capabilities to meet the original science requirements.\n\nProposed Jupiter science investigations mainly fall into the following segment types:\n\nPerijove Windows: Jupiter science operations will focus on the ±50-hour window surrounding closest approach, with different types of observations planned for dayside, terminator, or nightside encounters. The highest spatial resolution observations are possible during these windows (particularly during Phase 3), with numerous opportunities for stellar occultations also possible. At least 50 stellar UV occultations will occur during the tour spanning a wide range of latitudes and local times, as well as repetitions to search for temporal variability. Jupiter science will be interrupted by satellite flybys and windows for downlink, but otherwise these segments will be the top priority for Jupiter science.\n\nMonitoring Observations: Outside of the perijove windows, JUICE is required to provide frequent opportunities to track the evolution of atmospheric phenomena. Monitoring will likely be organised into campaigns focusing on specific targets (e.g., tracking the changes to a storm or vortex, high-frequency auroral observations, etc.), but preliminary segmentation places a 10-hour monitoring window once every three days (approximately), with significant flexibility in scheduling.\n\nPhase-Angle Windows: When not already covered by perijove or the monitoring windows, JUICE will observe Jupiter within ±5 hours of minimum phase (i.e., dayside), the terminator crossing (90∘ phase angle), and at maximum phase (i.e., nightside). These illumination conditions (and phase angles in between) are required to characterise the scattering properties of aerosols, and to provide nightside opportunities for lightning imaging and thermal emission measurements in the absence of scattered sunlight.\n\nInclined Windows: When not already covered by perijove windows, and when the sub-spacecraft latitude exceeds ±5∘ during Phase 4, JUICE will observe for ±10 hours either side of the locations of maximum northern and southern sub-spacecraft latitude. This will enable long-term monitoring of the polar atmosphere and auroras during Phase 4. Indeed, a special ‘inclined aurora’ segment is also planned for when the phase angle exceeds 160∘. These inclined windows will be planned on a case by case basis, as overlap with magnetospheric science segments is highly likely during Phase 4.\n\nOccultation Windows: These time-critical events are scheduled independent of the perijove windows, but sometimes occur within them. A window is reserved for radio occultation ingress and egress, as the spacecraft moves behind the planet as seen by Earth. Similarly, a ±1 hour window is reserved for solar occultations, at least five of which are planned during the tour. Stellar occultations are extremely numerous, with optimal stellar types selected by the UV and IR instrument teams, and a subset of these (at least fifty) will be scheduled throughout the tour.\n\nThese generic Jupiter science segments are driven by the tour geometry, and although monitoring of atmospheric and auroral variability is a high priority, the detailed science operations plans will remove any unnecessary redundancies. Furthermore, new segments that cover multi-instrument campaigns for specific phenomena (Sect. 5) will be built into the plan. A generic Jupiter orbit is shown in Fig. , highlighting a proposed sequence of activities. This ‘level-zero’ plan for segmentation of the JUICE orbit will be the basis of a rigorous activity plan that ensures proposed observations remain within the resource envelope (data volume, power, etc.) for JUICE.\n\nTo aid in the assessment of different tours, Fig. shows the amount of time available to Jupiter remote sensing observations during each of the ±50-hour perijove windows. Once the satellite encounters, spacecraft navigation images, wheel off-loading, and downlink windows are all removed, this leaves approximately 50% of the available time for science. During phase 4, we envisage sharing of perijoves with magnetospheric science, further reducing the time available for remote sensing. However, Jupiter observations are more likely to be data-volume limited rather than time-limited, and as Figs. and reveal, there are plentiful opportunities for observations within the ‘level-0’ segmentation from (i) close proximity to Jupiter during perijoves; (ii) a range of phase angles from dayside to nightside; and (iii) a range of local times. The JUICE tour therefore fulfils the requirements listed at the start of this Section.\n\nJUICE Instrumentation\n\nBased on the tour phases and high-level segmentation described in Sect. 3, the instrument teams developed a number of observing modes that can be used in an interchangeable fashion, serving as the building blocks to develop the operations plan. In this section, we provide brief overviews of the instruments and their capabilities for Jupiter science (summarised in Table ), describing how they will operate in the Jovian system.\n\nTable 2\n\nInstrumentNameSpectral RangeSpatial PropertiesSectionReferenceUVSUltraviolet Imaging Spectrograph50-204 nm, spectral resolution <1 nm7.3∘ × 0.1∘ slit plus additional 0.2∘ × 0.2∘ box4.1Gladstone et al.
