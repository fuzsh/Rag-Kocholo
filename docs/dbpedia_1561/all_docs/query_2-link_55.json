        "text": "This is the tool we have adopted to help anyone with an interest in digital technologies and young children organize, search and save the information available in the DigiLitEY Research Methodology Database. One of the goals of WG5 in the COST Action The digital literacy and multimodal practices of young children (DigiLitEY) is to review and advance current methods used to study young children’s engagement with digital media and technologies. We would love to get your feedback regarding the usefulness of this tool and hear about the ways in which you have worked with the information by contacting the COST Action\n\nInstructions\n\nThe tool is simple to use: (1) In «Column visibility» select the items that you want to display in the search; (2) Use the search tool («Buscar») in the upper right to introduce your keywords / search criteria; (3) If you want to save the results, chose the file format and download the output."
