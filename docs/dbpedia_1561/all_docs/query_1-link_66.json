        "text": "Superfund Record of Decision (EPA Region 8): Martin Marietta Astronautics Group site, Waterton, CO. (First remedial action), September 1990. Final report\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNot Available\n\n1990-09-24\n\nThe 5,200-acre Martin Marietta, Denver Aerospace site is in Waterton, Jefferson County, Colorado. The site completely surrounds 464 acres of contaminated Air Force property, which is being addressed as a separate Superfund site. Since 1950, the Martin Marietta Aeronautics Group (MMAG) has been conducting high technology engineering, design, development, and manufacturing operations for the space industry onsite. Types of wastes generated during onsite activities include oils, metals, organic solvents, wastewater, chemical process sludges, and VOCs. From 1959 to 1980, untreated, highly concentrated waste from onsite activities was disposed of in five onsite ponds, referred to as the Inactive Site PondsmoreÂ Â» Area. Previous site remediations by MMAG from 1969 to 1985 did not address contaminant sources or migration, but included backfilling and regarding of the Rifle Range Landfill. The Record of Decision (ROD) addresses remediation of onsite contaminated soil, waste/debris, and ground water. The primary contaminants of concern are VOCs including TCE; toluene, and xylenes; other organics including PCBs, pesticides, and phenols; and metals including chromium and lead.Â«Â less\n\nCleanliness verification process at Martin Marietta Astronautics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKing, Elizabeth A.; Giordano, Thomas J.\n\n1994-06-01\n\nThe Montreal Protocol and the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments mandate CFC-113, other chlorinated fluorocarbons (CFC's) and 1,1,1-Trichloroethane (TCA) be banned from production after December 31, 1995. In response to increasing pressures, the Air Force has formulated policy that prohibits purchase of these solvents for Air Force use after April 1, 1994. In response to the Air Force policy, Martin Marietta Astronautics is in the process of eliminating all CFC's and TCA from use at the Engineering Propulsion Laboratory (EPL), located on Air Force property PJKS. Gross and precision cleaning operations are currently performed on spacecraft components at EPL. The final step of the operation is a rinse with a solvent, typically CFC-113. This solvent is then analyzed for nonvolatile residue (NVR), particle count and total filterable solids (TFS) to determine cleanliness of the parts. The CFC-113 used in this process must be replaced in response to the above policies. Martin Marietta Astronautics, under contract to the Air Force, is currently evaluating and testing alternatives for a cleanliness verification solvent. Completion of test is scheduled for May, 1994. Evaluation of the alternative solvents follows a three step approach. This first is initial testing of solvents picked from literature searches and analysis. The second step is detailed testing of the top candidates from the initial test phase. The final step is implementation and validation of the chosen alternative(s). Testing will include contaminant removal, nonvolatile residue, material compatibility and propellant compatibility. Typical materials and contaminants will be tested with a wide range of solvents. Final results of the three steps will be presented as well as the implementation plan for solvent replacement.\n\nMMU development at the Martin Marietta plant in Denver, Colorado\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n1980-07-25\n\nS80-36889 (24 July 1980) --- Astronaut Bruce McCandless II uses a simulator at Martin Marietta?s space center near Denver to develop flight techniques for a backpack propulsion unit that will be used on Space Shuttle flights. The manned maneuvering unit (MMU) training simulator allows astronauts to \"fly missions\" against a full scale mockup of a portion of the orbiter vehicle. Controls of the simulator are like those of the actual MMU. Manipulating them allows the astronaut to move in three straight-line directions and in pitch, yaw and roll. One possible application of the MMU is for an extravehicular activity chore to repair damaged tiles on the vehicle. McCandless is wearing an extravehicular mobility unit (EMU).\n\nAbbreviations, acronyms, and initialisms frequently used by Martin Marietta Energy Systems, Inc..

Since the mid 1970's, researchers at the Martin Marietta Astronautics Group Space Operations Simulation (SOS) Laboratory have been engaged in investigations of remotely piloted and supervised autonomous spacecraft operations. These investigations were based on high fidelity, real-time simulations and have covered a wide range of human factors issues related to controllability. Among these are: (1) mission conditions, including thruster plume impingements and signal time delays; (2) vehicle performance variables, including control authority, control harmony, minimum impulse, and cross coupling of accelerations; (3) maneuvering task requirements such as target distance and dynamics; (4) control parameters including various control modes and rate/displacement deadbands; and (5) display parameters involving camera placement and function, visual aids, and presentation of operational feedback from the spacecraft. This presentation includes a brief description of the capabilities of the SOS Lab to simulate real-time free-flyer operations using live video, advanced technology ground and on-orbit workstations, and sophisticated computer models of on-orbit spacecraft behavior. Sample results from human factors studies in the five categories cited above are provided.\n\nThe Shock and Vibration Bulletin. Part 1.

Many LMC sites have taken proactive steps to reduce emissions and implement low VOC coating technology. Significant administrative, facility, and material challenges remain to achieve compliance with the upcoming NESHAP and Control Technology Guideline (CTG) standards. The facilities discussed herein set up programs to develop and implement compliance strategies. These facilities manufacture military aircraft, missiles, satellites, rockets, and electronic guidance and communications systems. Some of the facilities are gearing up for new production lines subject to new source MACT standards.moreÂ Â» At this time the facilities are reviewing compliance status of all primers, topcoats, maskants and solvents subject to the standard. Facility personnel are searching for the most efficient methods of satisfying the recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring, sections of the standards while simultaneously preparing or reviewing their Title V permit applications. Facility decisions on paint booths are the next highest priority. Existing dry filter paint booths will be subject to the filtration standard for existing paint booths which requires the use of two-stage filters. Planned paint booths for the F-22 program, and other new booths must comply with the standard for new and rebuilt booths which requires three stage or HEPA filters. Facilities looking to replace existing water wash paint booths, and those required to retrofit the air handling equipment to accommodate the two-stage filters, are reviewing issues surrounding the rebuilt source definition.Â«Â less\n\n1.

SLI, part of NASA's Integrated Space Transportation Plan (ISTP), was restructured in November 2002 to focus the overall theme of safer, more affordable space transportation along two paths the Orbital Space Plane (OSP) and the Next Generation Launch Technology programs. The Orbital Space Plane program has the goal of providing rescue capability from the International Space Station by 2008 or earlier and transfer capability for crew (and contingency cargo) by 2012. The Next Generation Launch Technology program is combining research and development efforts from the 2d Generation Reusable Launch Vehicle (2GRLV) program with cutting-edge, advanced space transportation programs (previously designated 31d Generation) into one program aimed at enabling safe, reliable, cost-effective reusable launch systems by the middle of the next decade. Lockheed Martin is one of three prime contractors working to bring Orbital Space Plane system concepts to a system design level of maturity by December 2003. This paper and presentation will update the aerospace community on the progress of the OSP program, from an industry perspective, and provide insights into Lockheed Martin's role in enabling the vision of a safer, more affordable means of taking people to and from space.\n\n2002 IDA Cost Research Symposium: Estimating the Costs of Transforming U.S. Military Forces\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2002-08-01\n\nFY00 billing rates for the following contractors and locations: Lockheed- Martin (Fort Worth, Palmdale, and Marietta ), Boeing (Puget Sound, Southern...2001 âEconometric Modeling of Acquisition Category I Systems at the Lockheed- Martin Plant in Marietta , Georgia,â IDA Paper P-3590, July 2001...Improvement Group (CAIG) in the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) provides independent cost estimates and reports on life-cycle costs of major\n\nSkylab\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n1971-07-01\n\nWorkmen at the Martin Marietta Corporation's Space Center in Denver, Colorado, position Skylab's Multiple Docking Adapter (MDA) flight article in the horizontal transportation fixture.

C.; Gille, J. P.; Eberhardt, R. N.\n\n1984-01-01\n\nA number of future NASA and DOD missions have been identified that will require, or could benefit from resupply of cryogenic liquids in orbit. The most promising approach for accomplishing cryogenic fluid transfer in the weightlessness environment of space is to use the thermodynamic filling technique. This approach involves initially reducing the receiver tank temperature by using several charge hold vent cycles followed by filling the tank without venting. Martin Marietta Denver Aerospace, under contract to the NASA Lewis Research Center, is currently developing analytical models to describe the on orbit cryogenic fluid transfer process. A detailed design of a shuttle attached experimental facility, which will provide the data necessary to verify the analytical models, is also being performed.\n\nRequirements specification for nickel cadmium battery expert system\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1986-01-01\n\nThe requirements for performance, design, test, and qualification of a computer program identified as NICBES, Nickel Cadmium Battery Expert System, is established. The specific spacecraft power system configuration selected was the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Electrical Power System (EPS) Testbed. Power for the HST comes from a system of 13 Solar Panel Arrays (SPAs) linked to 6 Nickel Cadmium Batteries which are connected to 3 Busses. An expert system, NICBES, will be developed at Martin Marietta Aerospace to recognize a testbed anomaly, identify the malfunctioning component and recommend a course of action. Besides fault diagnosis, NICBES will be able to evaluate battery status, give advice on battery status and provide decision support for the operator. These requirements are detailed.\n\nSite Investigation Report. 161st Air Refueling Group, Arizona National Guard, Sky Harbor International Airport and Papago Military Reservation, Phoenix, Arizona.

R.; Buell, D. N.; Ewing, E. S.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nThis paper describes a Shuttle Derived Vehicle (SDV) launch system presently being studied for the NASA by Martin Marietta Aerospace which capitalizes on existing Shuttle hardware elements to provide increased accommodations for payload weight, payload volume, or both. The SDV configuration utilizes the existing solid rocket boosters, external tank and the Space Shuttle main engines but replaces the manned orbiter with an unmanned, remotely controlled cargo carrier. This cargo carrier substitution more than doubles the performance capability of the orbiter system and is realistically achievable for minimal cost. The advantages of the SDV are presented in terms of performance and economics. Based on these considerations, it is concluded that an unmanned SDV offers a most attractive complement to the present Space Transportation System.\n\nProsthesis Material\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1995-01-01\n\nFAB/CAM, a subsidiary of the Harshberger Prosthetic and Orthotic Center, Inc., approached Marshall for help in replacing the heavy, fragile plaster they used to produce master molds for prosthetics. Concurrently, Marshall and Martin Marietta were creating a commercial derivative of the foam insulation used to protect the Space Shuttle External Tank from excessive heat. FAB/CAM found the foam blanks to be lighter, cheaper and easier to manufacture than plaster, resulting in lower costs to the consumer. Martin Marietta markets the foam system, MARCORE, for the prosthesis market. The system also has commercial potential in high temperature insulation and structural applications.\n\nProceedings of the 36th Aerospace Mechanisms Symposium\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBoesiger, Edward A.

(APCI). The STF consists of a slush generator which uses the freeze-thaw production process, a vacuum subsystem, a test tank which simulates the NASP vehicle, a triple point hydrogen receiver tank, a transfer subsystem, a sample bottle, a pressurization system, and a complete instrumentation and control subsystem. The STF was fabricated, checked-out, and made ready for testing under this contract. The actual SH2 testing was performed under the NASP consortium following NASP teaming. Pre-STF testing verified SH2 production methods, validated special SH2 instrumentation, and performed limited SH2 pressurization and expulsion tests which demonstrated the need for gaseous helium pre-pressurized of SH2 to control pressure collapse. The STF represents cutting-edge technology development by an effective Government-Industry team under very tight cost and schedule constraints.\n\nMartin Marietta, Y-12 Plant Laboratory Partnership Program Plan\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKoger, J.\n\n1995-02-10\n\nThe Y-12 Plant currently embraces three mission areas; stockpile surveillance, maintaining production capability, and storage of special nuclear materials. The Y-12 Plant also contributes to the nations` economic strength by partnering with industry in deploying technology. This partnering has been supported to a great extent through the Technology Transfer Initiative (TTI) directed by DOE/Defense Programs (DP-14). The Oak Ridge Centers for Manufacturing Technology (ORCMT) was established to draw upon the manufacturing and fabrication capabilities at the Y-12 Plant to coordinate and support collaborative efforts, between DP and the domestic industrial sector, toward the development of technologies which offer mutual benefitmoreÂ Â» to both DOE/DP programs and the private sector. Most of the needed technologies for the ``Factory of the Future`` (FOF) are being pursued as core areas at the Y-12 Plant. As a result, 85% of DP-14 projects already support the FOF. The unique capabilities of ORCMT can be applied to a wide range of manufacturing problems to enhance the capabilities of the US industrial base and its economic outcome. The ORCMT has an important role to play in DOE`s Technology Transfer initiative because its capabilities are focused on applied manufacturing and technology deployment which has a more near-term impact on private sector competitiveness. The Y-12 Plant uses the ORCMT to help maintain its own core competencies for the FOF by challenging its engineers and capabilities with technical problems from industry. Areas of strength at the Y-12 Plant that could impact the FOF include modeling of processes and advanced materials; intelligent inspection systems with standardized operator interfaces, analysis software, and part programming language; electronic transfer of designs and features; existing computer-based concurrent engineering; and knowledge-based forming process.Â«Â less\n\nAerospace Community.

Martin Marietta is currently contracted to develop a robotic system -- the Intelligent Mobile Sensor System (IMSS) -- for the automatic monitoring and inspection of these barrels. The IMSS is a mobile robot with multiple sensors: video cameras, illuminators, laser ranging and barcode reader. We assisted Martin Marietta in this task, specifically in the development of image processing algorithms that recognize and classify the barrel labels. Our subsystem uses video images to detect and locate the barcode, so that the barcode reader can be pointed at the barcode.\n\nIn re Martin.\n\nPubMed\n\n1993-07-19\n\nThe Appellate Court of Michigan established a hierarchical process to determine whether to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining medical treatments from patients who are no longer competent. The court held that terminal illness is only one of the factors to be considered. Only when a patient is shown to lack the requisite capacity to make treatment decisions may clear and convincing evidence of that patient's prior written or oral expression of preference be considered. In the absence of such clear and convincing evidence, substituted judgment or surrogate consent based on trustworthy evidence of the patient's wishes may be employed. If neither standard can be met, only then may the best interests of the patient be considered as a last resort. The court also noted that family members as well as guardians or conservators are appropriate participants in the determination of the medical treatment of such patients. In the case under appeal, there was conflicting testimony about Mr. Martin's earlier verbal statements concerning treatment preferences under various conditions. Also expert medical testimony was in disagreement about the degree of Martin's social interactions, comprehension, and competence. Finally, the case had been brought to the trial court by Martin's mother and sister who sought to remove Martin's wife as legal guardian because they disagreed with her intention to have Martin's artificial nutrition and hydration withdrawn. The appellate court remanded the case to the trial court to consider Martin's capacity to make the decision and, if he were deemed incompetent, to determine whether without clear and convincing evidence of his preferences the decision to withdraw treatment could be exercised by a surrogate decision maker.\n\nArt concept of Magellan spacecraft and inertial upper stage (IUS) deployment\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1988-01-01\n\nMagellan spacecraft mounted on inertial upper stage drifts above Atlantis, Orbiter Vehicle (OV) 104, after its deployment during mission STS-30 in this artist concept. Solar panels are deployed and in OV-104's open payload bay (PLB) the airborne support equipment (ASE) is visible. Both spacecraft are orbiting the Earth. Magellan, named after the 16th century Portuguese explorer, will orbit Venus about once every three hours, acquiring radar data for 37 minutes of each orbit when it is closest to the surface. Using an advanced instrument called a synthetic aperture radar (SAR), it will map more than 90 per cent of the surface with resolution ten times better than the best from prior spacecraft. Magellan is managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); Martin Marietta Aerospace is developing the spacecraft and Hughes Aircraft Company, the advanced imaging radar.\n\nMagellan attitude and articulation control subsystem closed loop testing\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nOlschansky, David G.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nIn the spring of 1989, the Magellan spacecraft will embark on a two-year mission to map the surface of the planet Venus. Guiding it there will be the Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS). To ensure reliable operations the AACS is being put through a rigorous test program at Martin Marietta Denver Aerospace. Before Magellan ever leaves the Space Shuttle bay from which it is to be launched, its components will have flown a simulated spaceflight in a ground-based lab. The primary objectives of the test program are to verify form, fit, and function of the AACS, particularly subsystem external interfaces and functional operation of the flight software. This paper discusses the Magellan Closed Loop Test Systems which makes realistic tests possible by simulating the dynamic and 'visual' flight environment for AACS components in the lab.\n\nConnect the Book.

Inc. (Energy Systems), at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. We determined that the President of Energy Systems had requested a Corporate review at the three sites because of his concerns about safety incidents and accidents during the late Spring and early Summer of 1994.

The failure mechanism is cadmium migration, and the consequent development of soft shorts. A Martin Marietta Astronautics satellite program instituted an orbital management strategy for a set of these batteries that reduced the rate of degradation and brought the system to stable operation. This strategy involves: (1) minimizing the accumulated battery overcharge; (2) regular discharge exercises; and (3) periodic battery reconditioning. Because of changes in the NiCd cell manufacturing process, the actual performance of subsequent lots of NiCd cells is open to question. Future NiCd based power system designs should therefore allow for fine control of charge parameters, and an on orbit battery reconditioning capability. To minimize risk, it is much better to perform a full life test to qualify the cells before launch, rather than in parallel with orbital operations. If there are any changes in the manufacturing process of cells, it is extremely important to maintain very strong cognizance of secondary subcontractors, recognizing that the cell and battery manufacturing discipline is easily atrophied.\n\nProceedings of the 40th Aerospace Mechanisms Symposium\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLittlefield, Alan C.; Mueller, Robert P.; Boesiger, Edward A.

Developed by the Orlando Division of Martin Marietta Aerospace, Orlando, Florida, and manufactured by Harris Corporation's RF Division, Rochester, N.Y., HICOM upgrades service to users, provides better system management to telephone companies, and makes more efficient use of available mobile telephone channels through a computerized central control terminal. The real estate man, for example, was able to dial his office and he could also have direct-dialed a long distance number. Mobile phones in most areas not yet served by HICOM require an operator's assistance for both local and long distance calls. HICOM improves system management by automatically recording information on all calls for accurate billing, running continual performance checks on its own operation, and reporting any malfunctions to a central office.\n\nArt concept of Magellan spacecraft in cruise configuration\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1988-01-01\n\nMagellan spacecraft cruise configuration is illustrated in this artist concept. With solar panels deployed and having jettisoned the inertial upper stage (IUS), Magellan approaches the sun which it will orbit approximately 1.6 times before encountering Venus. Magellan, named after the 16th century Portuguese explorer, will orbit Venus about once every three hours, acquiring radar data for 37 minutes of each orbit when it is closest to the surface. Using an advanced instrument called a synthetic aperture radar (SAR), it will map more than 90 per cent of the surface with resolution ten times better than the best from prior spacecraft. Magellan is managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); Martin Marietta Aerospace is developing the spacecraft and Hughes Aircraft Company, the advanced imaging radar. Magellan will be deployed from payload bay (PLB) of Atlantis, Orbiter Vehicle (OV) 104, during the STS-30 mission.\n\nThe Aerospace Age.

L.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nAtmospheric deposition of metals emitted by anthropogenic activities has been a significant source of metal loading into soils in the United States for more than 200 years. Based on research at the Susquehanna Shale Hills CZO, we began investigating Mn inputs to soils in the northeastern U.S.A. from widespread atmospheric Mn emissions from steel manufacturers and coal-burning power plants. Total Mn inputs to Shale Hills soils at ridgetops are calculated to be 42 mg Mn/cm2. In order to more directly evaluate the link between Mn emissions and Mn enrichment in soils, we are now investigating soils around a ferromanganese refinery in Marietta, Ohio that is currently the largest emission source of manganese (Mn) into the atmosphere in the U.S.A. Particulate emissions during production are up to 31-34% percent manganese oxide (MnO) by weight. These particles range in diameter from 0.05 to 0.4 Î¼m, making them both highly mobile and respirable. In order to assess the role of soils in Marietta as sinks for atmospherically-derived Mn, a series of soil cores have been collected from a range of distances (0.5 - 35 km) from the refinery. Mn is enriched at the soil surface up to 8 times above parent material composition sampled at 1 m depth near the source and decreases as a function of distance. Total mass of Mn added to soils per unit land area integrated over the soil depth core was calculated to be 50 mg Mn/cm2Â¬Â¬ near the refinery. In contrast, 10 mg Mn/cm2 was lost from the soil profile at a distance of 35 km from the facility. Enrichment of chromium (Cr) up to 3 times was also found in surface soils near the refinery, consistent with the production of ferrochromium at the Marietta plant. Further trace element analyses are being used to fingerprint atmospheric inputs from the refinery into the soil. Models of Mn addition to soils are also being developed and compared to known rates of emission.\n\nX-33 Proposal by Lockheed Martin - Computer Graphic\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1996-01-01\n\nThis artist's rendering depicts the Lockheed Martin X-33 for a technology demonstrator of a Single-Stage-To-Orbit (SSTO) Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV), as submitted in the aerospace company's original proposal. NASA selected Lockheed Martin's design on 2 July 1996. NASA's Dryden Flight research Center, Edwards, California, was to have had a key role in the development and flight testing of the X-33. The RLV technology program was a cooperative agreement between NASA and industry. The goal of the RLV technology program was to enable significant reductions in the cost of access to space, and to promote the creation and delivery of new space services and other activities that was to have improved U.S. economic competitiveness. The X-33 was a wedged-shaped subscale technology demonstrator prototype of a potential future Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) that Lockheed Martin had dubbed VentureStar. The company had hoped to develop VentureStar early this century. Through demonstration flight and ground research, NASA's X-33 program was to have provided the information needed for industry representatives such as Lockheed Martin to decide whether to proceed with the development of a full-scale, commercial RLV program. A full-scale, single-stage-to-orbit RLV was to have dramatically increased reliability and lowered the costs of putting a pound of payload into space, from the current figure of $10,000 to $1,000. Reducing the cost associated with transporting payloads in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) by using a commercial RLV was to have created new opportunities for space access and significantly improve U.S. economic competitiveness in the world-wide launch marketplace. NASA expected to be a customer, not the operator, of the commercial RLV. The X-33 design was based on a lifting body shape with two revolutionary 'linear aerospike' rocket engines and a rugged metallic thermal protection system. The vehicle also had lightweight components and fuel tanks built to conform to the vehicle\n\nTQM in a test environment\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nChambers, Gary D.; King, Elizabeth A.; Oleson, Keith\n\n1992-01-01\n\nIn response to the changing aerospace economic climate, Martin Marietta Astronautics Group (MMAG) has adopted a Total Quality Management (TQM) philosophy to maintain a competitive edge. TQM emphasizes continuous improvement of processes, motivation to improve from within, cross-functional involvement, people empowerment, customer satisfaction, and modern process control techniques. The four major initiatives of TQM are Product Excellence, Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP II), People Empowerment, and Subcontract Management. The Defense Space and Communications (DS&C) Test Lab's definition and implementation of the MRP II and people empowerment initiatives within TQM are discussed. The application of MRP II to environmental test planning and operations processes required a new and innovative approach. In an 18 month span, the test labs implemented MRP II and people empowerment and achieved a Class 'A' operational status. This resulted in numerous benefits, both tangible and intangible, including significant cost savings and improved quality of life.

Advanced structures can reduce weights by 5-40 percent as well as relax propulsion system performance specifications and reduce requirements for labor and materials. The effect on costs will be substantial. Advanced assembly and process control technologies also offer the potential for greatly reduced labor during the manufacturing and inspection processes. Current practices are very labor-intensive and, as a result, labor costs far outweigh material costs for operational space transportation systems. The technological readiness of new structural materials depends on their commercial availability, producibility and materials properties. Martin Marietta is vigorously pursuing the development of its Weldalite 049 Al-Li alloys in each of these areas. Martin Marietta is also preparing to test an automated work cell concept that it has developed using discrete event simulation.\n\nElectro-Mechanical Actuator.

The system was designed to demonstrate the capability of large, high power linear ELAs for applications such as Thrust Vector Control (TVC) on rocket engines. It consists of a motor controller, drive electronics and a linear actuator capable of up to 32,00 lbs loading at 7.4 inches/second. The drive electronics are based on the Resonant DC link concept and operate at a nominal frequency of 55 kHz. The induction motor is a specially designed high speed, low inertia motor capable of a 68 peak HP. The actuator was originally designed by MOOG Aerospace under an internal R & D program to meet Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) TVC requirements. The design was modified to meet this programs linear rate specification of 7.4 inches/second. The motor and driver were tested on a dynamometer at the Martin Marietta Space Systems facility. System frequency response, step response and force-velocity tests were conducted at the MOOG Aerospace facility.

The antenna consists of a deployable central column and a 15 meter hoop, stiffened by cables into a structure with a high tolerance repeatable surface and offset feed location. The surface has been configured to have four offset parabolic apertures, each about 6 meters in diameter, and is made of gold plated molybdenum wire mesh. Pattern measurements were made with feed systems radiating at frequencies of 7.73, 11.60, 2.27, 2.225, and 4.26 (all in GHz). This report (Volume 1) covers the testing from an overall viewpoint and contains information of generalized interest for testing large antennas. This volume discusses the deployment of the antenna in the Martin Facility and the measurements to determine mechanical stability and trueness of the reflector surface, gives the test program outline, and gives a synopsis of antenna electromagnetic performance. Three techniques for measuring surface mechanical tolerances were used (theodolites, metric cameras, and near-field phase), but only the near-field phase approach is included.

The contractors for this cost-shared project were Lockheed Martin Missiles & Space and Ultralife Batteries, Inc. The NASA Lewis Research Center provided contract management and technical oversight. The final products of the project were a portable 15-volt (V), 10-ampere-hour (A-hr) military radio battery and a 30-V, 50-A-hr marine/aerospace battery. Lewis will test the 50-A-hr battery. The new lithium-ion polymer battery technology offers a threefold or fourfold reduction in mass and volume, relative to today s commonly used nickel-cadmium, nickel-hydrogen, and nickel-metal hydride batteries. This is of special importance for orbiting satellites. It has been determined for a particular commercial communications satellite that the replacement of 1 kg of battery mass with 1 kg of transponder mass could increase the annual revenue flow by $100 000! Since this lithium-ion polymer technology offers battery mass reductions on the order of hundreds of kilograms for some satellites, the potential revenue increases are impressive.\n\n48 CFR 945.607-2 - Recovering precious metals.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2011 CFR\n\n2011-10-01\n\n...

Jeffrey\n\n2004-01-01\n\nAerospace Meteorology came into being in the 1950s as the development of rockets for military and civilian usage grew in the United States. The term was coined to identify those involved in the development of natural environment models, design/operational requirements, and environment measurement systems to support the needs of aerospace vehicles, both launch vehicles and spacecraft. It encompassed the atmospheric environment of the Earth, including Earth orbit environments. Several groups within the United States were active in this area, including the Department of Defense, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and a few of the aerospace industry groups. Some aerospace meteorology efforts were similar to those being undertaken relative to aviation interests. As part of the aerospace meteorology activities a number of lessons learned resulted that produced follow on efforts which benefited from these experiences, thus leading to the rather efficient and technologically current descriptions of terrestrial environment design requirements, prelaunch monitoring systems, and forecast capabilities available to support the development and operations of aerospace vehicles.\n\nComputer graphic of Lockheed Martin Venturestar Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) releasing a satellite\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1997-01-01\n\nThis is an artist's conception of the NASA/Lockheed Martin Single-Stage-To-Orbit (SSTO) Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) releasing a satellite into orbit around the earth.

The Modular Power Subsystem (MPS) onboard the satellite is equipped with three NASA Standard 50 Ampere-hour (Ah) nickel-cadmium (NiCd) batteries. McDonnell Douglas Electronics Systems Company fabricated the MPS, and batteries from Gates Aerospace Batteries cells. Nominal battery performance was achieved for the first four months of spacecraft operation. First evidence of anomalous battery performance was observed in January 1992, after the first maximum beta angle (low Depth of Discharge) period. Since then, the Flight Operations Team (FOT), under the direction of Goddard Space Flight Center's UARS Project and Space Power Application Branch, has monitored and managed battery performance by adjusting solar array offset angle, conducting periodic deep discharge, and controlling battery recharge ratio. This paper covers a brief overview of the UARS, the FOT's operational battery management, and the observed spacecraft battery performance.\n\nAnalysis and test results for a molten salt thermal energy storage system\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSterrett, R.

It consists of a hot tank to store the 565 C (1050 F) salt and a cold tank to store the 289 C (550 F) salt. The hot tank uses internal insulation protected by a liner to enable the use of a carbon steel shell for structural support. Due to the lower salt temperature, the cold tank can be a carbon steel shell with external insulation. This paper describes an analytical method used to predict the thermal performance of such systems and presents experimental data from a Subsystem Research Experiment (SRE) conducted by Martin Marietta Aerospace, Solar Energy Systems under contract from Sandia National Laboratories, Livermore, CA. The results from three of the SRE test cases are compared with the STS model results. These are (1) steady state operation, (2) concurrent charging and discharging, and (3) transient cooldown. The temperature differences between the analytical and experimental results were less than 10%. The internally insulated hot tank performed well.\n\nDevelopment of design allowables data for adhesives for attaching reusable surface insulation\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nOwen, H. P.; Carroll, M. T.\n\n1972-01-01\n\nResults are presented from tests to establish design allowables data for the following room temperature vulcanizing (RTV) silicone rubber based adhesives: (1) General Electric's RTV-560; (2) Dow Corning's 93-046; and (3) Martin Marietta's SLA-561. These adhesives are being evaluated for attaching reusable surface insulation to space shuttle structure.\n\nUsing the K-25 C TD Common File System: A guide to CFSI (CFS Interface)\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNot Available\n\n1989-12-01\n\nA CFS (Common File System) is a large, centralized file management and storage facility based on software developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory.
