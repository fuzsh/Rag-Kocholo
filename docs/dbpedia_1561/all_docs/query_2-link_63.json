Statins inhibit the de-novo synthesis of cholesterol. Consequently, the liver produces less VLDL, and the serum concentration primarily of LDL cholesterol (but, to a lesser extent, also of triglycerides) is lowered. Further, statins somewhat increase HDL cholesterol. There is abundant evidence that statins lower the rate of cardiovascular events. Cardiovascular risk reduction is the better, the lower the LDL cholesterol values achieved with statin therapy are. Some evidence is available that anion exchange resins which also decrease LDL cholesterol decrease vascular risk, too. This is not the case for the ezetimibe, which strongly lowers LDL cholesterol: its potential to decrease vascular risk remains to be proven. In contrast evidence for cardiovascular risk reduction through the mainly triglyceride lowering fibrates as well as for niacin is available. Niacin is the most potent HDL increasing drug currently available and besides increasing HDL cholesterol efficaciously lowers triglycerides and LDL cholesterol. Large ongoing trials address the decisive question whether treatment with fibrates and niacin provides additional cardiovascular risk reduction when given in addition to statin treatment.\n\nStatins increase hepatic cholesterol synthesis and stimulate fecal cholesterol elimination in mice\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSchonewille, Marleen; Freark de Boer, Jan; Mele, Laura; Wolters, Henk; Bloks, Vincent W.; Wolters, Justina C.; Kuivenhoven, Jan A.; Tietge, Uwe J.

Statins reduce plasma cholesterol levels, but whether this is actually caused by inhibition of de novo cholesterol synthesis has not been clearly established. Using three different statins, we investigated the effects on cholesterol metabolism in mice in detail. Surprisingly, direct measurement of whole body cholesterol synthesis revealed that cholesterol synthesis was robustly increased in statin-treated mice. Measurement of organ-specific cholesterol synthesis demonstrated that the liver is predominantly responsible for the increase in cholesterol synthesis. Excess synthesized cholesterol did not accumulate in the plasma, as plasma cholesterol decreased. However, statin treatment led to an increase in cholesterol removal via the feces. Interestingly, enhanced cholesterol excretion in response to rosuvastatin and lovastatin treatment was mainly mediated via biliary cholesterol secretion, whereas atorvastatin mainly stimulated cholesterol removal via the transintestinal cholesterol excretion pathway. Moreover, we show that plasma cholesterol precursor levels do not reflect cholesterol synthesis rates during statin treatment in mice. In conclusion, cholesterol synthesis is paradoxically increased upon statin treatment in mice. However, statins potently stimulate the excretion of cholesterol from the body, which sheds new light on possible mechanisms underlying the cholesterol-lowering effects of statins.

The identification of PCSK9 as a key factor in the LDL clearance pathway has led to the development of new monoclonal antibodies. Here we critically review the economic evaluations published in Europe and focused on statins. We searched the PubMed database to select the studies published from July 2006 to June 2016 and finally selected 19 articles. Overall, the majority of studies were conducted from a third-party payer's viewpoint and recurred to modelling. Most studies were sponsored by industry and funding seemed to play a pivotal role in the study design. Patients resistant to LDL-C level reduction were considered only in a few studies. The place in therapy of the new class of biologic should be considered a kind of 'third line' for cholesterol-lowering, after patients have failed with restricted dietary regimens and then with current drug therapies. Otherwise they could result in hardly sustainable expenses even for developed countries.\n\nStatin Drugs Markedly Inhibit Testosterone Production by Rat Leydig Cells In Vitro: Implications for Men\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nStatin drugs lower blood cholesterol by inhibiting hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme-A reductase.

The prevailing opinion that serum cholesterol as a mediator of the disease is increased by eating saturated fats and decreased by eating polyunsaturated fats is being challenged. Evidently, the beneficial effects of statins in atherosclerosis are not mainly due to its cholesterol lowering effect, rather than to its âpleiotropic effectsâ. Other pathogenetic factors in atherosclerosis are involved, like inflammatory and immunologic processes, that can be modulated by statins as well as by other drugs or by the Mediterranean-style nutrition and by micronutrients (folate, B-vitamins).

Allan\n\n2013-01-01\n\nAlzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by severe cognitive impairment, inability to perform activities of daily living and mood changes. Statins, long known to be beneficial in conditions where dyslipidemia occurs by lowering serum cholesterol levels, also have been proposed for use in neurodegenerative conditions, including AD. However, it is not clear that the purported effectiveness of statins in neurodegenerative disorders is directly related to cholesterol-lowering effects of these agents; rather, the pleiotropic functions of statins likely play critical roles. The aim of this review is to provide an overview on the new discoveries about the effects of statin therapy on the oxidative ad nitrosative stress levels as well as on the modulation of the heme oxygenase/biliverdin reductase (HO/BVR) system in the brain. We propose a novel mechanism of action for atorvastatin which, through the activation of HO/BVR-A system, may contribute to the neuroprotective effects thus suggesting a potential therapeutic role in AD and potentially accounting for the observation of decreased AD incidence with persons on statin.

Ezetimibe inhibits cholesterol absorption but also upregulates synthesis. We tested whether ezetimibe added to ongoing statin therapy would be most effective in lowering LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) in subjects on high-potency statins and whether these effects would be related to alterations in cholesterol absorption (Î²-sitosterol) and synthesis (lathosterol) markers. Methods Hypercholesterolemic subjects (n=874) on statins received ezetimibe 10 mg/day. Plasma lipids, lathosterol, and Î²-sitosterol were measured at baseline and on treatment. Subjects were divided into low- (n=133), medium- (n=582), and high- (n=159) statin potency groups defined by predicted LDL-Câlowering effects of each ongoing statin type and dose (reductions of ~20-30%, ~31-45%, or ~46-55%, respectively). Results The high-potency group had significantly lower baseline lathosterol (1.93 vs. 2.58 vs. 3.17 Î¼mol/l; p <0.001) and higher baseline Î²-sitosterol values (6.21 vs. 4.58 vs. 4.51 Î¼mol/l, p <0.001) than medium-/low-potency groups. Ezetimibe treatment in the high-potency group produced significantly greater reductions from baseline in LDL-C than medium-/low-potency groups (â29.1% vs. â25.0% vs. â22.7%; p <0.001) when evaluating unadjusted data. These effects and group differences were significantly (p <0.05) related to greater Î²-sitosterol reductions and smaller lathosterol increases. However, LDL-C reduction differences between groups were no longer significant after controlling for placebo effects, due mainly to modest LDL-C lowering by placebo in the high-potency group. Conclusion Patients on high-potency statins have the lowest levels of cholesterol synthesis markers and the highest levels of cholesterol absorption markers at baseline, and the greatest reduction in absorption markers and the smallest increases in synthesis markers with ezetimibe\n\nHow to Lower Cholesterol: MedlinePlus Health Topic\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n... a non-statin cholesterol-lowering treatment option. ...

Here we consider the place of non-statin therapies that also reduce LDL cholesterol in prevention of CVD. Among conventional non-statins, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials showed that bile acid sequestrants, niacin and fibrates given as monotherapy each reduce CVD end points. From trials in which patientsâ LDL cholesterol was already well-controlled on a statin, adding ezetimibe incrementally reduced CVD end points, while adding a fibrate or niacin showed no incremental benefit. Among emerging non-statins, monoclonal antibodies against proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) added to a statin and given for up to 78 weeks showed preliminary evidence of reductions in CVD outcomes. While these promising early findings contributed to the recent approval of these agents in Europe and the US, much larger and longer duration outcomes studies are ongoing for definitive proof of CVD benefits. Other non-statin agents recently approved in the US include lomitapide and mipomersen, which both act via distinctive LDL-receptor independent mechanisms to substantially reduce LDL cholesterol in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. We also address some unanswered questions, including measuring alternative biochemical variables to LDL cholesterol, evidence for treating children with monitoring of subclinical atherosclerosis, and potential risks of extremely low LDL cholesterol. As evidence for benefit in CVD prevention accumulates, we anticipate that clinical practice will shift towards more assertive LDL-lowering treatment, using both statins and non-statins initiated earlier in appropriately selected patients. PMID:26376908\n\nNew Drugs for Treating Dyslipidemia: Beyond Statins\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAhn, Chang Ho\n\n2015-01-01\n\nStatins have been shown to be very effective and safe in numerous randomized clinical trials, and became the implacable first-line treatment against atherogenic dyslipidemia. However, even with optimal statin treatment, 60% to 80% of residual cardiovascular risk still exists. The patients with familial hypercholesterolemia which results in extremely high level of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level and the patients who are intolerant or unresponsive to statins are the other hurdles of statin treatment. Recently, new classes of lipid-lowering drugs have been developed and some of them are available for the clinical practice. The pro-protein convertase subtilisin/kexintype 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor increases the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor in hepatocytes by enhancing LDL receptor recycling. The microsomal triglyceride transport protein (MTP) inhibitor and antisense oligonucleotide against apolipoprotein B (ApoB) reduce the ApoB containing lipoprotein by blocking the hepatic very low density lipoprotein synthesis pathway. The apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) mimetics pursuing the beneficial effect of high density lipoprotein cholesterol and can reverse the course of atherosclerosis. ApoA1 mimetics had many controversial clinical data and need more validation in humans. The PCSK9 inhibitor recently showed promising results of significant LDL-C lowering in familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) patients from the long-term phase III trials. The MTP inhibitor and antisesnse oligonucleotide against ApoB were approved for the treatment of homozygous FH but still needs more consolidated evidences about hepatic safety such as hepatosteatosis. We would discuss the benefits and concerns of these new lipid-lowering drugs anticipating additional benefits beyond statin treatment.

Previous research suggests that exposure to direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) increases drug demand among those at comparatively low risk. Research has yet to examine whether individual-level DTCA exposure may influence statin use among men and women at high, moderate, or low risk for future cardiac events. To determine the relationship between estimated exposure to DTCA for statin drugs and two clinical variables: diagnosis with high cholesterol and statin use. We used logistic regression to analyze repeated cross-sectional surveys of the United States population, merged with data on the frequency of DTCA appearances on national, cable, and local television, between 2001 and 2007. American adults (n=106,685) aged 18 and older. Levels of exposure to statin DTCA, based on ad appearances and TV viewing patterns; self-reports of whether or not a respondent has been diagnosed with high cholesterol, and whether or not a respondent took a statin in the past year. Adjusting for potential confounders, we estimate that exposure to statin ads increased the odds of being diagnosed with high cholesterol by 16 to 20 %, and increased statin use by 16 to 22 %, among both men and women (p<0.05). These associations were driven almost exclusively by men and women at low risk for future cardiac events. There was also evidence of a negative association between DTCA exposure and statin use among high-risk women (p<0.05) CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new evidence that DTCA may promote over-diagnosis of high cholesterol and over-treatment for populations where risks of statin use may outweigh potential benefits.\n\nCurrent and future pharmacologic options for the management of patients unable to achieve low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol goals with statins.\n\nPubMed\n\nEl Harchaoui, Karim; Akdim, Fatima; Stroes, Erik S G; Trip, Mieke D; Kastelein, John J P\n\n2008-01-01\n\nLow-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering is the mainstay of the current treatment guidelines in the management of cardiovascular risk. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are currently the most effective LDL-C-lowering drugs. However, a substantial number of patients do not reach treatment targets with statins. Therefore, an unmet medical need exists for lipid-lowering drugs with novel mechanisms of action to reach the recommended cholesterol target levels, either by monotherapy or combination therapy. Upregulation of the LDL receptor with squalene synthase inhibitors has shown promising results in animal studies but the clinical development of the lead compound lapaquistat (TAK-475) has recently been discontinued. Ezetimibe combined with statins allowed significantly more patients to reach their LDL-C targets. Other inhibitors of intestinal cholesterol absorption such as disodium ascorbyl phytostanol phosphate (FM-VP4) and bile acid transport inhibitors have shown positive results in early development trials, whereas the prospect of acyl coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase inhibition in cardiovascular prevention is dire. Selective inhibition of messenger RNA (mRNA) by antisense oligonucleotides is a new approach to modify cholesterol levels. The inhibition of apolipoprotein B mRNA is in advanced development and mipomersen sodium (ISIS 301012) has shown striking results in phase II studies both as monotherapy as well as in combination with statins.\n\nPleiotropic effects of statins: new therapeutic targets in drug design.\n\nPubMed\n\nBedi, Onkar; Dhawan, Veena; Sharma, P L; Kumar, Puneet\n\n2016-07-01\n\nThe HMG Co-enzyme inhibitors and new lipid-modifying agents expand their new therapeutic target options in the field of medical profession. Statins have been described as the most effective class of drugs to reduce serum cholesterol levels. Since the discovery of the first statin nearly 30Â years ago, these drugs have become the main therapeutic approach to lower cholesterol levels. The present scientific research demonstrates numerous non-lipid modifiable effects of statins termed as pleiotropic effects of statins, which could be beneficial for the treatment of various devastating disorders. The most important positive effects of statins are anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, antioxidant, immunomodulatory, neuroprotective, anti-diabetes, and antithrombotic, improving endothelial dysfunction and attenuating vascular remodeling besides many others which are discussed under the scope of this review. In particular, inhibition of Rho and its downstream target, Rho-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase (ROCK), and their agonistic action on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) can be viewed as the principle mechanisms underlying the pleiotropic effects of statins. With gradually increasing knowledge of new therapeutic targets of statins, their use has also been advocated in chronic inflammatory disorders for example rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In the scope of review, we highlight statins and their pleiotropic effects with reference to their harmful and beneficial effects as a novel approach for their use in the treatment of devastating disorders. Graphical abstract Pleiotropic effect of statins.\n\nStatins are associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer disease regardless of lipophilicity. The Rotterdam Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nHaag, M D M; Hofman, A; Koudstaal, P J; Stricker, B H C; Breteler, M M B\n\n2009-01-01\n\nCross-sectional reports suggest that statin users are less likely to have Alzheimer disease (AD). Prospective studies have provided inconsistent evidence. Moreover, it is unclear whether the association differs for lipophilic statins, those that could more easily pass the blood-brain barrier and hydrophilic statins. To prospectively evaluate whether use of statins is associated with the risk of AD, and to determine whether associations differ for lipophilic and hydrophilic statins. 6992 participants of the prospective, population-based Rotterdam Study were followed, from baseline (1990-1993) until January 2005 for incident AD. Data on all filled prescriptions came from pharmacy records. For each date on which each event occurred, cholesterol-lowering drug use for the person who experienced the event and all remaining persons in the cohort was categorised as \"any\" or \"never\" use. A distinction was made between statin, lipophilic and hydrophilic statins, and non-statin cholesterol-lowering drugs. Data were analysed with the Cox regression analysis, adjusting for sex, age and potential confounders. During follow-up (mean 9 years), 582 persons developed AD. Compared with never use of cholesterol-lowering drugs, statin use was associated with a decreased risk of AD (HR 0.57; 95% CI 0.37 to 0.90), but non-statin cholesterol-lowering drug use was not (HR 1.05; 95% CI 0.45 to 2.44). HRs were equal for lipophilic (HR 0.54; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.89) and hydrophilic statins (HR 0.54; 95% CI 0.26 to 1.11). In the general population, the use of statins, but not of non-statin cholesterol-lowering drugs, was associated with a lower risk of AD compared with never use of cholesterol-lowering drugs. The protective effect was independent of the lipophilicity of statins.\n\nLDL Cholesterol, Statins And PCSK 9 Inhibitors\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGupta, Sanjiv\n\n2015-01-01\n\nReduction of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) is of vital importance for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Statin is the most effective therapy today to lower LDLc by inhibiting HMG-CoA-reductase. However despite intensive statin therapy, there remains a residual risk of recurrent myocardial infarction in about 20â30% cases. Moreover a few patients develop statin intolerance. For severe hypercholesterolemia, statins alone or in combination of ezetimibe, niacin and fenofibrate have been advocated. For homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HOFH), a microsomal triglyceride transfer protein MTP inhibitor (Lopitamide) and antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) (Mipomersen) have recently been approved by FDA, USA through âRisk evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)â. Possible future therapies include PCSK-9 inhibitors which have excellent lipid lowering properties. Three monoclonal antibodies (PCSK 9 Inhibitors) alirocumab, evolocumab and Bococizumab are under advanced clinical stage IV trials and awaiting approval by FDA and European Medicines Agency. PMID:26432726\n\nNovel lipid modifying drugs to lower LDL cholesterol.\n\nPubMed\n\nCupido, Arjen J; Reeskamp, Laurens F; Kastelein, John J P\n\n2017-08-01\n\nStatins have long been the cornerstone for the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, because of perceived adverse effects and insufficient efficacy in certain groups of patients, considerable interest exists in the search for alternatives to lower LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), and the recent approvals of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors underlines the success of this quest. Here, we give an updated overview on the most recent developments in the area of LDL-C lowering agents. The clinical effects of the PCSK9 inhibitors are promising, especially now that the FOURIER and SPIRE programmes are published. Most cholesterylester-transfer protein inhibitors, however, except anacetrapib, have been discontinued because of either toxicity or lack of efficacy in large cardiovascular outcome trials. Other agents - like mipomersen, lomitapide, ETC-1002, and gemcabene - aim to lower LDL-C in different ways than solely through the LDL receptor, opening up possibilities for treating patients not responding to conventional therapies. New discoveries are also being made at the DNA and RNA level, with mipomersen being the first approved therapy based on RNA intervention in the United States for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Recent years have witnessed a new beginning for cholesterol-lowering compounds. With increased knowledge of lipid metabolism a score of new therapeutic targets has been identified. Mechanisms for modulation of those targets are also becoming more diverse while statins remain the backbone of CVD prevention, the new alternatives, such as PCSK9 monoclonals will probably play an important additional role in treatment of patients at risk for CVD.\n\nComparison of a dietary portfolio diet of cholesterol-lowering foods and a statin on LDL particle size phenotype in hypercholesterolaemic participants.\n\nPubMed\n\nGigleux, Iris; Jenkins, David J A; Kendall, Cyril W C; Marchie, Augustine; Faulkner, Dorothea A; Wong, Julia M W; de Souza, Russell; Emam, Azadeh; Parker, Tina L; Trautwein, Elke A; Lapsley, Karen G; Connelly, Philip W; Lamarche, BenoÃ®t\n\n2007-12-01\n\nThe effect of diet v. statins on LDL particle size as a risk factor for CVD has not been examined. We compared, in the same subjects, the impact of a dietary portfolio of cholesterol-lowering foods and a statin on LDL size electrophoretic characteristics. Thirty-four hyperlipidaemic subjects completed three 1-month treatments as outpatients in random order: a very-low saturated fat diet (control); the same diet with 20 mg lovastatin; a dietary portfolio high in plant sterols (1 g/4200 kJ), soya proteins (21.4 g/4200 kJ), soluble fibres (9.8 g/4200 kJ) and almonds (14 g/4200 kJ). LDL electrophoretic characteristics were measured by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis of fasting plasma at 0, 2 and 4 weeks of each treatment. The reductions in plasma LDL-cholesterol levels with the dietary portfolio and with statins were comparable and were largely attributable to reductions in the estimated concentration of cholesterol within the smallest subclass of LDL (portfolio - 0.69 (se 0.10) mmol/l, statin - 0.99 (se 0.10) mmol/l). These were significantly greater (P < 0.01) than changes observed after the control diet ( - 0.17 (se 0.08) mmol/l). Finally, baseline C-reactive protein levels were a significant predictor of the LDL size responsiveness to the dietary portfolio but not to the other treatments. The dietary portfolio, like the statin treatment, had only minor effects on several features of the LDL size phenotype, but the pronounced reduction in cholesterol levels within the small LDL fraction may provide additional cardiovascular benefit over the traditional low-fat diet of National Cholesterol Education Program Step II.\n\nPharmacogenetic meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of LDL cholesterol response to statins\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPostmus, Iris; Trompet, Stella; Deshmukh, Harshal A.; Barnes, Michael R.; Li, Xiaohui; Warren, Helen R.; Chasman, Daniel I.; Zhou, Kaixin; Arsenault, Benoit J.; Donnelly, Louise A.; Wiggins, Kerri L.; Avery, Christy L.; Griffin, Paula; Feng, QiPing; Taylor, Kent D.; Li, Guo; Evans, Daniel S.; Smith, Albert V.; de Keyser, Catherine E.; Johnson, Andrew D.; de Craen, Anton J.

Here we perform a pharmacogenetic meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in studies addressing the LDL cholesterol response to statins, including up to 18,596 statin-treated subjects. We validate the most promising signals in a further 22,318 statin recipients and identify two loci, SORT1/CELSR2/PSRC1 and SLCO1B1, not previously identified in GWAS. Moreover, we confirm the previously described associations with APOE and LPA. Our findings advance the understanding of the pharmacogenetic architecture of statin response.

By doing so, they have a potent lipid-lowering effect that reduces cardiovascular risk and decreases mortality. Since the mevalonate pathway also influences endothelial function, the inflammatory response, and coagulation, the effects of statins reach well beyond their cholesterol lowering properties. As with all drugs, statins may have adverse effects; these include musculoskeletal symptoms, increased risk of diabetes, and higher rates of hemorrhagic stroke. However, the frequency of adverse effects is extremely low and, in selected patient populations, the benefits of statins considerably outweigh the potential risks.

Although statins are the most frequently prescribed cholesterol-lowering medication, there remains a significant portion of patients who require alternative treatment options. Nutraceuticals are increasingly popular as cholesterol-lowering agents. Despite the lack of long-term trials evaluating their use on cardiovascular endpoints and mortality, several studies have demonstrated their potential cholesterol-lowering effects. The purpose of this review is to provide an update on the role of nutraceuticals as cholesterol-lowering agents. The present review will focus on individual nutraceutical compounds, which have shown modest cholesterol-lowering abilities, as well as combination nutraceuticals, which may offer potential additive and/or synergistic effects. Berberine, red yeast rice, and plant sterols have moderate potential as cholesterol-lowering agents. Combination nutraceuticals, including the proprietary formulation, Armolipid Plus, appear to confer additional benefit on plasma lipid profiles, even when taken with statins and other agents. Although robust, long-term clinical trials to examine the effects of nutraceuticals on clinical outcomes are still required, their cholesterol-lowering ability, together with their reported tolerance and safety, offer a pragmatic option for lowering plasma cholesterol levels.\n\nTreatment with ETC-1002 alone and in combination with ezetimibe lowers LDL cholesterol in hypercholesterolemic patients with or without statin intolerance.\n\nPubMed\n\nThompson, Paul D; MacDougall, Diane E; Newton, Roger S; Margulies, Janice R; Hanselman, Jeffrey C; Orloff, David G; McKenney, James M; Ballantyne, Christie M\n\n2016-01-01\n\nETC-1002 is an oral, once-daily, first-in-class medication being developed to treat hypercholesterolemia. To compare 2 doses of ETC-1002, alone or combined with ezetimibe 10Â mg (EZE), vs EZE monotherapy for lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). This phase 2b, multicenter, double-blind trial-evaluated hypercholesterolemic patients (LDL-C, 130 to 220Â mg/dL) with (nÂ =Â 177) or without (nÂ =Â 171) muscle-related intolerance to â¥2 statins; 1 at lowest approved dose. Subjects were randomized to 12-week treatment with ETC-1002 120Â mg or ETC-1002 180Â mg alone, EZE alone, ETC-1002 120Â mg plus EZE, or ETC-1002 180Â mg plus EZE. EZE alone lowered LDL-C by 21%, whereas ETC-1002 monotherapy with 120Â mg or 180Â mg reduced LDL-C by 27% (PÂ =Â .0008 vs EZE) and 30% (PÂ <Â .0001 vs EZE), respectively. The combination of ETC-1002, 120Â mg or 180Â mg plus EZE reduced LDL-C by 43% and 48%, respectively (both PÂ <Â .0001 vs EZE). ETC-1002 alone or combined with EZE also reduced non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, LDL particle number, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein compared with EZE alone. Across all treatment groups, statin-intolerant patients reported more muscle-related adverse events than did statin-tolerant patients. ETC-1002 was safe and well tolerated, and rates of muscle-related adverse events were similar in all treatment groups. In patients with and without statin intolerance, daily treatment with ETC-1002 120Â mg and 180Â mg alone or with EZE reduced LDL-C more than EZE alone and had a similar tolerability profile (NCT01941836).

We conducted a retrospective, observational study to estimate the percentage changes in lipid parameters and glucose induced by different statins. We analyzed 3854 patients including those with nondiabetes and diabetes treated at the outpatient clinic between 2003 and 2013 who were statin-naÃ¯ve and maintained fixed-dose of statin for at least 18Â months. Moderate- and low-intensity statin therapy was effective in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) toÂ <100Â mg/dL (70.3%, 83.0%, and 87.2% of diabetic patients in the low-, moderate-, and high-intensity therapy groups, respectively). The rapid decrease of LDL-C was observed in the first 8Â months, and LDL-C-lowering effect was maintained throughout the observation period in even the low-intensity statin group. The effects of statins in elevating high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were similar in each statin groups, except the ezetimibe-simvastatin group (4.5Â Â±Â 2.1%) and high-dose atorvastatin groups (9.7Â Â±Â 3.3% and 8.7Â Â±Â 2.4% for 40Â mg and 80Â mg of atorvastatin/day, respectively). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased less and LDL-C decreased more in diabetes than in nondiabetes. There were no significant changes of fasting glucose after statin use in nondiabetic patients. Moderate- or low-intensity statin was effective enough in reaching National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III LDL-C target goals in Koreans. Low-intensity statin showed around 30% LDL-C reduction from the baseline level in Koreans, which is comparable to moderate-intensity statin in new guideline.

The mechanisms for neuroprotection are only partially understood, however, and pleiotropic phenomena could be involved. We have made a comparative study of 9 statins (lovastatin, mevastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, cerivastatin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pitavastatin, and rosuvastatin), analyzing several parameters that could be related to neuroprotection, such as chemical structure, lipophilicity, potential blood-brain-barrier penetration (BBB), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl co-enzyme A reductase inhibition, cholesterol modulation in neurons, glia, and human hepatocyte cell lines, and protection against neurodegeneration caused by tau hyperphosphorylation induced by okadaic acid. Our results indicate that monacolin J derivatives (natural and semi-synthetic statins) are the best candidates for the prevention of neurodegenerative conditions due to their higher potential BBB penetration capacity, cholesterol lowering effect on neurons with a satisfactory safety profile, and in vitro protection against cell death caused by okadaic acid in culture. Among the nine statins studied, simvastatin presented the best characteristics for preventing neurodegenerative conditions.\n\nMeta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of HDL cholesterol response to statins\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPostmus, Iris; Warren, Helen R; Trompet, Stella; Arsenault, Benoit J; Avery, Christy L; Bis, Joshua C; Chasman, Daniel I; de Keyser, Catherine E; Deshmukh, Harshal A; Evans, Daniel S; Feng, QiPing; Li, Xiaohui; Smit, Roelof AJ; Smith, Albert V; Sun, Fangui; Taylor, Kent D; Arnold, Alice M; Barnes, Michael R; Barratt, Bryan J; Betteridge, John; Boekholdt, S Matthijs; Boerwinkle, Eric; Buckley, Brendan M; Chen, Y-D Ida; de Craen, Anton JM; Cummings, Steven R; Denny, Joshua C; DubÃ©, Marie Pierre; Durrington, Paul N; Eiriksdottir, Gudny; Ford, Ian; Guo, Xiuqing; Harris, Tamara B; Heckbert, Susan R; Hofman, Albert; Hovingh, G Kees; Kastelein, John JP; Launer, Leonore J; Liu, Ching-Ti; Liu, Yongmei; Lumley, Thomas; McKeigue, Paul M; Munroe, Patricia B; Neil, Andrew; Nickerson, Deborah A; Nyberg, Fredrik; OâBrien, Eoin; OâDonnell, Christopher J; Post, Wendy; Poulter, Neil; Vasan, Ramachandran S; Rice, Kenneth; Rich, Stephen S; Rivadeneira, Fernando; Sattar, Naveed; Sever, Peter; Shaw-Hawkins, Sue; Shields, Denis C; Slagboom, P Eline; Smith, Nicholas L; Smith, Joshua D; Sotoodehnia, Nona; Stanton, Alice; Stott, David J; Stricker, Bruno H; StÃ¼rmer, Til; Uitterlinden, AndrÃ© G; Wei, Wei-Qi; Westendorp, Rudi GJ; Whitsel, Eric A; Wiggins, Kerri L; Wilke, Russell A; Ballantyne, Christie M; Colhoun, Helen M; Cupples, L Adrienne; Franco, Oscar H; Gudnason, Vilmundur; Hitman, Graham; Palmer, Colin NA; Psaty, Bruce M; Ridker, Paul M; Stafford, Jeanette M; Stein, Charles M; Tardif, Jean-Claude; Caulfield, Mark J; Jukema, J Wouter; Rotter, Jerome I; Krauss, Ronald M\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground In addition to lowering low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), statin therapy also raises high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. Inter-individual variation in HDL-C response to statins may be partially explained by genetic variation. Methods and Results We performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify variants with an effect on statin-induced HDL-C changes. The 123 most promising signals with P<1Ã10â4 from the 16,769 statin-treated participants in the first analysis stage were followed up in an independent group of 10,951 statin-treated individuals, providing a total sample size of 27,720 individuals. The only associations of genome-wide significance (P<5Ã10â8) were between minor alleles at the CETP locus and greater HDL-C response to statin treatment. Conclusion Based on results from this study that included a relatively large sample size, we suggest that CETP may be the only detectable locus with common genetic variants that influence HDL-C response to statins substantially in individuals of European descent. Although CETP is known to be associated with HDL-C, we provide evidence that this pharmacogenetic effect is independent of its association with baseline HDL-C levels.

Evaluation of non-cholesterol sterols (NCSs) as synthesis and absorption markers, and lipoprotein particles quality may indicate the dyslipidemia early development. This study investigates associations of different cholesterol homeostasis patterns with low-density (LDL) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL) subclasses distribution in statin-treated and statin-untreated CAD patients, and potential use of aforementioned markers for CAD treatment optimization. The study included 78 CAD patients (47 statin-untreated and 31 statin-treated) and 31 controls (CG). NCSs concentrations were quantified using gas chromatography- flame ionization detection (GC-FID). Lipoprotein subclasses were separated by gradient gel electrophoresis. In patients, cholesterol-synthesis markers were significantly higher comparing to CG. Cholesterol-synthesis markers were inversely associated with LDL size in all groups. For cholesterol homeostasis estimation, each group was divided to good and/or poor synthetizers and/or absorbers according to desmosterol and Î²-sitosterol median values. In CG, participants with reduced cholesterol absorption, the relative proportion of small, dense LDL was higher in those with increased cholesterol synthesis compared to those with reduced synthesis (p<0.01). LDL I fraction was significantly higher in poor synthetizers/poor absorbers subgroup compared to poor synthetizers/good absorbers (p<0.01), and good synthetizers/poor absorbers (p<0.01). Statin-treated patients with increased cholesterol absorption had increased proportion of LDL IVB (p<0.05). The results suggest the existence of different lipoprotein abnormalities according to various patterns of cholesterol homeostasis. Desmosterol/Î²-sitosterol ratio could be used for estimating individual propensity toward dyslipidemia development and direct the future treatment.\n\nImplications of lower risk thresholds for statin treatment in primary prevention: analysis of CPRD and simulation modelling of annual cholesterol monitoring.\n\nPubMed\n\nMcFadden, Emily; Stevens, Richard; Glasziou, Paul; Perera, Rafael\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTo estimate numbers affected by a recent change in UK guidelines for statin use in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. We modelled cholesterol ratio over time using a sample of 45,151 men (â¥40years) and 36,168 women (â¥55years) in 2006, without statin treatment or previous cardiovascular disease, from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Using simulation methods, we estimated numbers indicated for new statin treatment, if cholesterol was measured annually and used in the QRISK2 CVD risk calculator, using the previous 20% and newly recommended 10% thresholds. We estimate that 58% of men and 55% of women would be indicated for treatment by five years and 71% of men and 73% of women by ten years using the 20% threshold. Using the proposed threshold of 10%, 84% of men and 90% of women would be indicated for treatment by 5years and 92% of men and 98% of women by ten years. The proposed change of risk threshold from 20% to 10% would result in the substantial majority of those recommended for cholesterol testing being indicated for statin treatment. Implications depend on the value of statins in those at low to medium risk, and whether there are harms. Copyright Â© 2014.

This progress has not come about without resistance. Perhaps one of the most debated topics in medicine, the cholesterol controversy, could only be brought to rest through the development of new clinical research methods that were capable of taking advantage of the amazing achievements in basic and pharmacological science after the second World War. It was only after understanding the biochemistry and physiology of cholesterol synthesis, transport and clearance from the blood that medicine could take advantage of drugs and diets to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic diseases. This review points to the highlights of the history of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol lowering, with the discovery of the low-density lipoprotein receptor and its physiology and not only the development of statins as the stellar moments but also the development of clinical trial methodology as an effective tool to provide scientifically convincing evidence.

The impetus for the study is the fact that 10% of the population in the Scandinavian countries are treated with statins in order to maintain good health and to avoid cardiovascular disease by counteracting high blood levels of cholesterol. The potential benefit of treatment with statins should be considered in light of evidence that statin use has prevalent and unintended side effects (e.g. myalgia, and glucose and exercise intolerance). The LIFESTAT project combines invasive human experiments, biomedical analyses, nationwide surveys, epidemiological studies, qualitative interviews, media content analyses, and ethnographic participant observations. The study investigates the biological consequences of statin treatment; determines the mechanism(s) by which statin use causes muscle and mitochondrial dysfunction; and analyzes achievement of treatment goals, people's perception of disease risk, media influence on people's risk and health perception, and the way people manage to live with the risk (personally, socially and technologically).

Several novel agents have been developed to lower LDL-C, either as monotherapy or in combination with statins. These novel therapies include squalene synthase inhibitors, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitors, and antisense apolipoprotein B. Although each of these novel therapies effectively lowers LDL-C, challenges remain in the clinical development to assess long-term safety.\n\nLipid-lowering drugs (statins) and peripheral neuropathy.\n\nPubMed\n\nEmad, Mohammadreza; Arjmand, Hosein; Farpour, Hamid Reza; Kardeh, Bahareh\n\n2018-03-01\n\nPeripheral neuropathy is a disorder with often unknown causes. Some drugs, including statins, are proposed to be among the causes of peripheral neuropathy. This study aimed at evaluating this condition by electrodiagnostic study among patients who had received statins. This case-control study was conducted in Shiraz, Iran in 2015, and included 39 patients aged 35-55 who had received statins for at least 6 months, and 39 healthy matched controls. Using electrodiagnosis, the sensory and motor wave features (amplitude, latency and nerve conduction velocity) of the peripheral nerves (Median, Ulnar, Tibial, Sural, and Peroneal) were evaluated among the subjects. Data were analyzed using SPSS software and p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Regarding the occurrence of neuropathy, there were no significant differences in any of the definitions presented for peripheral neuropathy. However, the difference was close to significance for one definition [2 abnormalities in 2 nerves (p=0.055)]. Regarding mean values of the features, significant differences were observed in two features: amplitude of the peroneal motor nerve (p=0.048) and amplitude of the sural sensory nerve (p=0.036). Since statins are widely used, awareness regarding their side-effects would lead to better treatment. Even though no significant differences were found between the groups regarding the occurrence of peripheral neuropathy, there were significant differences in amplitudes of the sural sensory response and the peroneal motor response. This indicates the involvement of peripheral nerves. Therefore, we recommend that patients and physicians should be informed about the possible symptoms of this condition.\n\nNature's Cholesterol-Lowering Drug: Isolation and Structure Elucidation of Lovastatin from Red Yeast Rice-Containing Dietary Supplements\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nNazri, Maisarah Mohd; Samat, Farah D.; Kavanagh, Pierce V.; Walsh, John J.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nRed yeast rice, produced by fermenting the fungus, \"Monascus purpureus\", on rice (\"Oryza sativa\" L. gramineae), is commonly used as a dietary supplement.

Hypercholesterolemia is one of the primary risk factors for these pathologies, whose incidence is highly related to aging. Almost 25% of men and 42% of women older than 65 years have a serum total cholesterol level greater than 240 mg/dL. The mechanisms behind this age-related increase in plasma cholesterol are still incompletely understood, thus, the control of plasma cholesterol content in aged people is more challenging than in adults. In this review the different pharmacological approaches to reduce plasma cholesterol levels, particularly in aged people, will be discussed. In brief, current therapies are mostly based on the prescription of statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors) that are pretty effective but that exert several side effects. More attention should be given to potential drug interactions, potential age-related changes in drug pharmacokinetics, adverse effects such as myopathy and competing risks when statins are prescribed to old patients. In combination or in alternative to statin therapy, other agents might be required to reduce low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. Among the available drugs, the most commonly prescribed are those addressed to reduce cholesterol absorption, to modulate lipoprotein lipase activity and bile acid sequestrants: even these pharmacological interventions are not exempt from side effects. The use of antioxidants or organoselenium compounds and the discovery of new proteins able to modulate exclusively LDL receptor recycling such as Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 and SEC24 offer new pharmacological approaches to selectively reduce the main causes of\n\nEmerging lipid-lowering drugs: squalene synthase inhibitors.\n\nPubMed\n\nElsayed, Raghda K; Evans, Jeffery D\n\n2008-06-01\n\nLapaquistat was the only squalene synthase inhibitor in Phase III clinical trials in Europe and the United States, but was recently discontinued from clinical development. Unlike statins, the inhibition of de novo cholesterol biosynthesis by lapaquistat does not deplete mevalonate, a precursor of isoprenoids. Isoprenoids are critical in cell growth and metabolism. The present review will focus on the chemistry, pharmacology, and lipid-lowering effects of novel squalene synthase inhibitors. A search of Pubmed, IPA, and GoogleScholar for studies (animal and human) and review articles published in English between 1990 and April 2008, using the search terms \"squalene synthase inhibitors\" or \"lapaquistat\". All clinical trials identified were then cross-referenced for their citations. All literature identified was then complied for this analysis. Lapaquistat mainly targets LDL-C, but may have some effect on HDL-C and TG. Preliminary reports on Phase II and Phase III associated lapaquistat 100 mg with elevated hepatic enzymes. Hepatotoxicity, possible drug-drug interaction with statins, and the investigation of a statin/coenzyme Q10 combination are among the few challenges that impeded lapaquistat's clinical development.\n\nAchievement of cholesterol targets and prescribing of higher-cost statins: a cross-sectional study in general practice.\n\nPubMed\n\nFleetcroft, Robert; Schofield, Peter; Duerden, Martin; Ashworth, Mark\n\n2012-12-01\n\nThere is conflicting evidence as to whether achievement of cholesterol targets at the population level is dependent on the choice and cost of statin. To investigate the practice-level relationship between cholesterol quality indicators in patients with heart disease, stroke, and diabetes and prescribing of low-cost statins. Correlations and linear regression modelling of retrospective cross-sectional practice-level data with potential explanatory variables in 7909 (96.4%) general practices in England in 2008-2009. Quality indicator data were obtained from the Information Centre and prescribing data from the NHS Business Authority. A 'cholesterol quality indicator' score was constructed by dividing the numbers of patients achieving the target for cholesterol control of â¤5 mmol/l in stroke, diabetes, and heart disease by the numbers on each register. A 'low-cost statin' ratio score was constructed by dividing the numbers of defined daily doses of simvastatin and pravastatin by the total numbers of defined daily doses of statins. Simvastatin accounted for 83.3% (standard deviation [SD] = 15.7%) of low-cost statins prescribed and atorvastatin accounted for 85.7% (SD = 14.8%) of high-cost statins prescribed. The mean cholesterol score was 73.7% (SD = 6.0%). Practices using a higher proportion of the low-cost statins were less successful in achieving cholesterol targets. An increase of 10% in the prescribing of low-cost statins was associated with a decrease of 0.46% in the cholesterol quality indicator score (95% confidence interval = -0.54% to -0.38%, P<0.001). Greater use of low-cost statins was associated with a small reduction in cholesterol control.\n\nMolecular pathology of familial hypercholesterolemia, related dyslipidemias and therapies beyond the statins.\n\nPubMed\n\nFaiz, Fathimath; Hooper, Amanda J; van Bockxmeer, Frank M\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe development of the statin class of cholesterol-lowering drugs is one of the most significant success stories of modern pharmacotherapy. World-wide there are an estimated 150 million people on statins, with the emerging economies of India and China predicted to contribute significantly to that number. Notwithstanding their success, a significant number of people cannot tolerate statins because of serious side effects; of equal concern, a substantial proportion of high risk patients fail to reach cholesterol-lowering targets. For these subjects there is an urgent need for new cholesterol-lowering agents to be used alone or in combination with statins. The success of statins has been largely underpinned by knowledge of cholesterol homeostasis at a molecular level, knowledge that was first gleaned in the 1980s from Brown and Goldstein's pioneering studies of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH, OMIM 143890). Follow-up work that has identified a number of intracellular and circulating factors, all capable of disrupting LDL clearance, has revealed that the low-density lipoprotein receptor- (LDLR) mediated clearance pathway is substantially more complex than previously thought. These factors were discovered in studies of individuals with very rare inherited conditions that lead to either hypo- or hypercholesterolemia. These investigations, besides providing clearer insight into the molecular mechanisms regulating plasma LDL concentrations, have also revealed a number of novel therapeutic targets independent from statins. Consequently, a number of novel therapeutic approaches that are based on small interfering bio-molecules, including antisense oligonucleotides, are now in clinical development. These are aimed at impairing the assembly, synthesis and secretion of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins and/or accelerating their hepatic catabolism. The aim of this article is to focus on these recent advances in the understanding of the molecular basis of cholesterol\n\nAn electronic health record based model predicts statin adherence, LDL cholesterol, and cardiovascular disease in the United States Military Health System\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLucas, Joseph E.; Bazemore, Taylor C.; Alo, Celan; Monahan, Patrick B.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (or âstatinsâ) are important and commonly used medications to lower cholesterol and prevent cardiovascular disease. Nearly half of patients stop taking statin medications one year after they are prescribed leading to higher cholesterol, increased cardiovascular risk, and costs due to excess hospitalizations. Identifying which patients are at highest risk for not adhering to long-term statin therapy is an important step towards individualizing interventions to improve adherence. Electronic health records (EHR) are an increasingly common source of data that are challenging to analyze but have potential for generating more accurate predictions of disease risk. The aim of this study was to build an EHR based model for statin adherence and link this model to biologic and clinical outcomes in patients receiving statin therapy. We gathered EHR data from the Military Health System which maintains administrative data for active duty, retirees, and dependents of the United States armed forces military that receive health care benefits. Data were gathered from patients prescribed their first statin prescription in 2005 and 2006. Baseline billing, laboratory, and pharmacy claims data were collected from the two years leading up to the first statin prescription and summarized using non-negative matrix factorization. Follow up statin prescription refill data was used to define the adherence outcome (> 80 percent days covered). The subsequent factors to emerge from this model were then used to build cross-validated, predictive models of 1) overall disease risk using coalescent regression and 2) statin adherence (using random forest regression). The predicted statin adherence for each patient was subsequently used to correlate with cholesterol lowering and hospitalizations for cardiovascular disease during the 5 year follow up period using Cox regression. The analytical dataset included 138 731 individuals and 1840 potential baseline predictors\n\nIncreased statin eligibility based on ACC/AHA versus NCEP guidelines for high cholesterol management in Chile.\n\nPubMed\n\nEcheverrÃ­a, Guadalupe; Dussaillant, Catalina; Villarroel, Luis; Rigotti, Attilio\n\n2016-01-01\n\nIn 2013, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) jointly released new guidelines for cardiovascular risk assessment and cholesterol management that substantially modified the previous recommendations proposed by the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) in 2001. The relative impact of these new guidelines on potential statin use has not been estimated in Latin American populations. To estimate and compare eligibility for statin therapy based on ACC/AHA and NCEP guidelines in adult Chilean population. Using data from the last National Health Survey (2009-2010 NHS), we conducted a cross-sectional analysis in a ârepresentative sample of the Chilean adult population and calculated the proportion of individuals that would receive statins under each set of guidelines. According to ACC/AHA guidelines, the population eligible for statin treatment increased from 21.7% (NCEP guidelines) to 33.2% (overall 53% increase). This effect was more pronounced among women (29.6% under ACC/AHA vs 15.6% under NCEP) and with those of advanced age (75% of the subjects >60 years of age compared with 46% under NCEP). The newly eligible group included more women and older subjects and individuals with lower LDL cholesterol levels. Compared with NCEP recommendations, the new ACC/AHA guidelines significantly increased the number of Chilean adults eligible for statin therapy. Full implementation of the new recommendations may have important public health implications in Chile and other Latin American countries, as more women and older subjects without cardiovascular disease would qualify for statin treatment.

We also recommended refraining from therapy with ezetimibe until its efficacy in preventing cardiovascular events had been documented. At the American Heart Association scientific sessions 2014 the results of the IMPROVE-IT study were reported. In this large, randomised trial, a modest benefit of the combination of simvastatin plus ezetimibe over simvastatin alone was reported after 7 years of treatment. The efficacy of such combination therapy was similar to the efficacy of high-dose statin therapy, while the combination therapy is much more expensive. Comparing the efficacy and costs of different preventive therapies, we recommend first prescribing aspirin and a moderate dose of statin, secondly an ACE inhibitor. A high-dose statin should be considered in high-risk patients. The combination of simvastatin and ezetimibe should be prescribed only in high-risk patients (e.g. diabetics after myocardial infarction) who do not tolerate high-dose statins.\n\nEfficacy of Statin Therapy in Inducing Coronary Plaque Regression in Patients with Low Baseline Cholesterol Levels\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNozue, Tsuyoshi; Yamamoto, Shingo; Tohyama, Shinichi; Fukui, Kazuki; Umezawa, Shigeo; Onishi, Yuko; Kunishima, Tomoyuki; Sato, Akira; Miyake, Shogo; Morino, Yoshihiro; Yamauchi, Takao; Muramatsu, Toshiya; Hibi, Kiyoshi; Terashima, Mitsuyasu; Suzuki, Hiroshi; Michishita, Ichiro\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAim: The efficacy of statin therapy in inducing coronary plaque regression may depend on baseline cholesterol levels. We aimed to determine the efficacy of statin therapy in inducing coronary plaque regression in statin-naÃ¯ve patients with low cholesterol levels using serial intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) data from the treatment with statin on atheroma regression evaluated by virtual histology IVUS (TRUTH) study. Methods: The TRUTH study is a prospective, multicenter trial, comparing the efficacies of pitavastatin and pravastatin in coronary plaque regression in 164 patients. All patients were statin-naÃ¯ve and received statin therapy only after study enrollment. The primary endpoint was the observation of coronary plaque progression, despite statin therapy. Results: Serial IVUS data, at baseline and after an 8-month follow-up, were available for 119 patients. The patients were divided into three groups based on non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levelsâlow: â¤ 140 mg/dl, n = 38; moderate: 141â169 mg/dl, n = 42; and high: â¥ 170 mg/dl, n = 39. Coronary plaque progression was noted in the low cholesterol group, whereas plaque regression was noted in the moderate and high cholesterol groups [%Îplaque volume: 2.3 Â± 7.4 vs. â 2.7 Â± 10.7 vs. â 3.2 Â± 7.5, p = 0.004 (analysis of variance)]. After adjusting for all variables, a low non-HDLC level (â¤ 140 mg/dl) was identified as an independent predictor of coronary plaque progression [odds ratio, 3.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.5â9.1, p = 0.004]. Conclusion: Serial IVUS data analysis indicated that statin therapy was less effective in inducing coronary plaque regression in patients with low cholesterol levels but more effective in those with high cholesterol levels at baseline.

Design Systematic review and network meta-analysis. Eligibility Open label and double blind randomised controlled trials comparing one statin with another at any dose or with control (placebo, diet, or usual care) for adults with, or at risk of developing, cardiovascular disease. Only trials that lasted longer than four weeks with more than 50 participants per trial arm were included. Two investigators assessed study eligibility. Data sources Bibliographic databases and reference lists of relevant articles published between 1 January 1985 and 10 March 2013. Data extraction One investigator extracted data and another confirmed accuracy. Main outcome measure Mean absolute change from baseline concentration of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Data synthesis Study level outcomes from randomised trials were combined using random effects network meta-analyses. Results We included 183 randomised controlled trials of statins, 103 of which were two-armed or multi-armed active comparator trials. When all of the existing randomised evidence was synthesised in network meta-analyses, there were clear differences in the LDL cholesterol lowering effects of individual statins at different doses. In general, higher doses resulted in higher reductions in baseline LDL cholesterol levels. Of a total of 146 industry sponsored trials, 64 were placebo controlled (43.8%). The corresponding number for the non-industry sponsored trials was 16 (43.2%). Of the 35 unique comparisons available in 37 non-industry sponsored trials, 31 were also available in industry sponsored trials. There were no systematic differences in magnitude between the LDL cholesterol lowering effects of individual statins observed in industry sponsored versus non-industry sponsored trials. In industry sponsored trials, the mean change from baseline LDL\n\nTechnological advances and proteomic applications in drug discovery and target deconvolution: identification of the pleiotropic effects of statins.\n\nPubMed\n\nBanfi, Cristina; Baetta, Roberta; Gianazza, Erica; Tremoli, Elena\n\n2017-06-01\n\nProteomic-based techniques provide a powerful tool for identifying the full spectrum of protein targets of a drug, elucidating its mechanism(s) of action, and identifying biomarkers of its efficacy and safety. Herein, we outline the technological advancements in the field, and illustrate the contribution of proteomics to the definition of the pharmacological profile of statins, which represent the cornerstone of the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Statins act by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, thus reducing cholesterol biosynthesis and consequently enhancing the clearance of low-density lipoproteins from the blood; however, HMG-CoA reductase inhibition can result in a multitude of additional effects beyond lipid lowering, known as 'pleiotropic effects'. The case of statins highlights the unique contribution of proteomics to the target profiling of a drug molecule. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

To examine the impact of the 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol treatment guidelines on pharmacy utilization of cholesterol-lowering drugs in a real-world managed care setting. Pharmacy claims from OptumRx, a national pharmacy benefit management provider, for the period between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2013 (baseline period), were used to identify candidates for cholesterol-lowering therapy and to estimate the number of potential patients who will be starting or intensifying statin therapy based on the updated cholesterol treatment guidelines. Potential candidates for cholesterol-lowering treatments included patients with diabetes or hypertension aged 40 to 75 years who were not already receiving a cholesterol-lowering medication, as well as patients receiving cholesterol-lowering therapies during the baseline period. The baseline cholesterol-lowering medication market share was used to project changes in pharmacy utilization over the next 3 years. Based on the 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol treatment guidelines, there will be a 25% increase in the proportion of the overall population that is treated with statins over the next 3 years, increasing from 3,909,407 (27.7%) patients to 4,892,668 (34.7%) patients. The largest proportion of the increase in statin utilization is projected to be for primary prevention in patients aged 40 to 75 years who were not receiving any cholesterol-lowering treatment at baseline. These projected changes will increase the overall number of statin prescriptions by 25% and will decrease the number of nonstatin cholesterol-lowering medication prescriptions by 68% during the next 3 years. The new 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol treatment guidelines\n\nStatin intolerance - a question of definition.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlgharably, Engi Abdel-Hady; Filler, Iris; Rosenfeld, Stephanie; Grabowski, Katja; Kreutz, Reinhold\n\n2017-01-01\n\nStatin therapy is the backbone of pharmacologic therapy for low-density lipoproteins cholesterol lowering and plays a pivotal role in cardiovascular disease prevention. Statin intolerance is understood as the inability to continue using a statin to reduce individual cardiovascular risk sufficiently, due to the development of symptoms or laboratory abnormalities attributable to the initiation or dose escalation of a statin. Muscle symptoms are the most common side effects observed. Areas covered: The main aim of this article is to present a review on published definitions of statin intolerance. In addition, a brief review on clinical aspects and risk factors of statin intolerance is provided and features for a common definition for statin intolerance are suggested. Expert opinion: A definition of statin intolerance by major drug regulatory agencies is not available. In clinical studies, different definitions are chosen and results are not comparable; different medical associations do not agree on one common definition. There is an unmet need to establish a common definition of statin intolerance to ensure an appropriate clinical use of this important drug class. Further work is required to develop a consensus definition on statin intolerance that could have significant positive impact on both research and clinical management.\n\n[Clinical use of statins and cholesterol goals in patients with several cardiovascular risk factors].\n\nPubMed\n\nGÃ³mez-Belda, Ana; Rodilla, Enrique; Albert, Amparo; GarcÃ­a, Luis; GonzÃ¡lez, Carmen; Pascual, JosÃ© M\n\n2003-10-25\n\nOur goal was to determine the number of patients who achieve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) targets according to new guidelines. Descriptive and transversal study of patients from a cardiovascular clinic. LDL-c was calculated and targets were established according the NCEP-ATP III. 1,811 patients (46% males, 54% females) were studied. 35% of these were high-risk patients (group 1: coronary risk > 20% at 10 years), 19% were intermediate-risk patients (group 2: coronary risk 10-20% at 10 years) and 46% were low-risk patients (group 3: coronary risk < 10% at 10 years). Overall, 58% of patients achieved target LDL-c levels, yet success rates were 26% among group 1 patients, 51% among group 2 patients, and 86% among group 3 patients (p = 0.001, for differences between groups). Statin treatment was significantly related to achieving target LDL-c levels in group 1 patients (OR = 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2-2.4; p = 0.007). In group 1.41% of patients had LDL-c levels > 130 mg/dl without receiving lipid-lowering drugs. Although an overall 58% patients achieve target LDL-C levels, only one of four high-risk patients have LDL-c levels < 100 mg/dl, and statin treatment is a determining factor to achieve this goal. These findings indicate that a more aggressive treatment with statins is needed in secondary prevention.\n\nManagement of statin-intolerant high-risk patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nTziomalos, Konstantinos; Athyros, Vasilios G; Karagiannis, Asterios; Mikhailidis, Dimitri P\n\n2010-09-01\n\nStatins are an essential part of the management of patients at high vascular risk and are generally well-tolerated. However, statin intolerance will be observed more frequently as more stringent low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) targets are pursued in an ever increasing number of patients. We review the management options for high-risk patients intolerant to statin treatment. Potential strategies include switching to a different statin, reducing the frequency of statin administration, substituting statins with other LDL-C-lowering agents (e.g. ezetimibe, colesevelam or nicotinic acid) and combining low-dose statin treatment with other lipid-modifying drugs. A limited number of studies specifically assessed statin-intolerant patients and most were small and of short duration. It is therefore difficult to make evidence-based recommendations for the management of this population. In addition, all treatment options have limitations in terms of safety and/or efficacy.\n\nPLEIOTROPIC EFFECTS OF STATINS\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLiao, James K.; Laufs, Ulrich\n\n2009-01-01\n\nStatins are potent inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis. In clinical trials, statins are beneficial in the primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. However, the overall benefits observed with statins appear to be greater than what might be expected from changes in lipid levels alone, suggesting effects beyond cholesterol lowering. Indeed, recent studies indicate that some of the cholesterol-independent or âpleiotropicâ effects of statins involve improving endothelial function, enhancing the stability of atherosclerotic plaques, decreasing oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibiting the thrombogenic response. Furthermore, statins have beneficial extrahepatic effects on the immune system, CNS, and bone. Many of these pleiotropic effects are mediated by inhibition of isoprenoids, which serve as lipid attachments for intracellular signaling molecules. In particular, inhibition of small GTP-binding proteins, Rho, Ras, and Rac, whose proper membrane localization and function are dependent on isoprenylation, may play an important role in mediating the pleiotropic effects of statins.

Although well tolerated, statin-induced myopathies are the most common side effects. Compared to their pharmacologically active acid form, statin lactones are more potent inducers of toxicity. They can be formed by glucuronidation mediated by uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), but a systematic characterization of subtype specificity and kinetics of lactonization is lacking. Here, we demonstrate for six clinically relevant statins that only UGT1A1, 1A3, and 2B7 contribute significantly to their lactonization. UGT1A3 appeared to have the highest lactonization capacity with marked differences in statin conversion rates: pitavastatin â« atorvastatin > cerivastatin > lovastatin > rosuvastatin (simvastatin not converted). Using in silico modeling we could identify a probable statin interaction region in the UGT binding pocket. Polymorphisms in these regions of UGT1A1, 1A3, and 2B7 may be a contributing factor in statin-induced myopathies, which could be used in personalization of statin therapy with improved safety.\n\nMixed Messages, Mixed Outcomes: Exposure to Direct-to-Consumer Advertising for Statin Drugs is Associated with More Frequent Visits to Fast Food Restaurants and Exercise.\n\nPubMed\n\nNiederdeppe, Jeff; Avery, Rosemary J; Kellogg, Maxwell D; Mathios, Alan\n\n2017-07-01\n\nThis study examines whether exposure to direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCAs) for statin drugs is associated with non-pharmaceutical behaviors to prevent cardiovascular disease. We focus on the relationship between statin drug DTCA exposure and the frequency of (a) visits to fast-food restaurants and (b) exercise. We combine data on the televised broadcast availability of statin drug DTCAs in large media markets in the United States with 18 waves of the Simmons National Consumer Survey (NCS; nÂ =Â 120, 229) from 2001 to 2009. We find that statin drug DTCA exposure is associated, in a dose-response pattern, with modest increases in the frequency of exercise and large increases in the frequency of fast-food-restaurant visits. The relationship between statin DTCA exposure and fast-food-restaurant visits were largely consistent in direction but differed in magnitude between those without a previous diagnosis of high cholesterol and those treating high cholesterol with a statin. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of these results for future research on pharmaceutical DTCA and population health.\n\nStatins attenuate but do not eliminate the reverse epidemiology of total serum cholesterol in patients with non-ischemic chronic heart failure.\n\nPubMed\n\nFrÃ¶hlich, Hanna; Raman, Nandita; TÃ¤ger, Tobias; Schellberg, Dieter; Goode, Kevin M; Kazmi, Syed; Grundtvig, Morten; Hole, Torstein; Cleland, John G F; Katus, Hugo A; Agewall, Stefan; Clark, Andrew L; Atar, Dan; Frankenstein, Lutz\n\n2017-07-01\n\nIn patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) increasing levels of total serum cholesterol are associated with improved survival - while statin usage is not. The impact of statin treatment on the \"reverse epidemiology\" of cholesterol is unclear. 2992 consecutive patients with non-ischemic CHF due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction from the Norwegian CHF Registry and the CHF Registries of the Universities of Hull, UK, and Heidelberg, Germany, were studied. 1736 patients were individually double-matched on both cholesterol levels and the individual propensity scores for statin treatment. All-cause mortality was analyzed as a function of baseline cholesterol and statin use in both the general and the matched sample. 1209 patients (40.4%) received a statin. During a follow-up of 13,740 patient-years, 360 statin users (29.8%) and 573 (32.1%) statin non-users died. When grouped according to total cholesterol levels as low (â¤3.6mmol/L), moderate (3.7-4.9mmol/L), high (4.8-6.2mmol/L), and very high (>6.2mmol/L), we found improved survival with very high as compared with low cholesterol levels. This association was present in statin users and non-users in both the general and matched sample (p<0.05 for each group comparison). The negative association of total cholesterol and mortality persisted when cholesterol was treated as a continuous variable (HR 0.83, 95%CI 0.77-0.90, p<0.001 for matched patients), but it was less pronounced in statin users than in non-users (F-test p<0.001). Statins attenuate but do not eliminate the reverse epidemiological association between increasing total serum cholesterol and improved survival in patients with non-ischemic CHF.

Adverse effects from some statins on muscle, such as myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, are rare at standard doses, and on the liver, in increasing levels of transaminases, are unusual. Myopathy--muscle pain or weakness with blood creatine kinase levels more than ten times the upper limit of the normal range--typically occurs in fewer than one in 10,000 patients on standard statin doses. However, this risk varies between statins, and increases with use of higher doses and interacting drugs. Rhabdomyolysis is a rarer and more severe form of myopathy, with myoglobin release into the circulation and risk of renal failure. Stopping statin use reverses these side-effects, usually leading to a full recovery. Asymptomatic increases in concentrations of liver transaminases are recorded with all statins, but are not clearly associated with an increased risk of liver disease. For most people, statins are safe and well-tolerated, and their widespread use has the potential to have a major effect on the global burden of cardiovascular disease.\n\nRole of Statin Drugs for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nCassidy-Vu, Lisa; Joe, Edwina; Kirk, Julienne K\n\n2016-12-01\n\nObjective: To review the potential role and specific impact of statin drugs in women with PCOS. The evidence for this use of statins in PCOS is limited and still under further investigation. Materials and methods: A search was conducted using PubMed, DynaMed and PubMedHealth databases through October 16, 2016 using the terms polycystic ovary syndrome, PCOS, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA, statin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin and simvastatin . English-language trials evaluating statins in PCOS were obtained and incorporated if they provided relevant data for providers. Results: We summarize twelve trials involving statins in PCOS. The trials were predominantly 12 weeks to 3 months in length (8 of the 12 trials) and low to moderate dose of statin drugs were used. The majority (10 of 12) of the trials show that statins reduce testosterone levels or other androgen hormones (DHEA-S and androstenedione), half of the trials evaluating LH/FSH ratio show an improvement, and all had positive effects on lipid profiles. Conclusion: Statins show promising improvements in serum levels of androgens and LH/FSH ratios translating to improved cardiovascular risk factors above and beyond simply lowering LDL levels. More investigation is needed to determine if statins can clinically impact women with PCOS long term, particularly those who are young and are not yet candidates for traditional preventative treatment with a statin medication.\n\nLipid-lowering therapy in older persons\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2015-01-01\n\nNumerous randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies and observational studies have shown that statins reduce mortality and major cardiovascular events in older high-risk persons with hypercholesterolemia. The Heart Protection Study showed that statins reduced mortality and major cardiovascular events in high-risk persons regardless of the initial level of serum lipids, age, or gender. The updated National Cholesterol Education Program III guidelines state that in very high-risk persons, a serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level of < 70 mg/dl (1.8 mmol/l) is a reasonable clinical strategy for moderately high-risk persons (2 or more risk factors and a 10-year risk for coronary artery disease of 10% to 20%), and the serum LDL cholesterol should be reduced to < 100 mg/dl (2.6 mmol/l). When LDL cholesterol-lowering drug therapy is used to treat high-risk persons or moderately high-risk persons, the serum LDL cholesterol should be reduced by at least 30% to 40%. The serum LDL cholesterol should be decreased to less than 160 mg/dl in persons at low risk for cardiovascular disease. Addition of other lipid-lowering drugs to statin therapy has not been demonstrated to further reduce cardiovascular events and mortality.

Our objectives are to compare provider prescription of high-intensity statin therapy in patients hospitalized with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or cerebrovascular accident (CVA) before and after the publication of the 2013 cholesterol guidelines, determine potential predictors of high-intensity statin utilization, and identify targets for improvement in cardiovascular risk reduction among these high-risk populations. A single-center retrospective cohort study of 695 patients discharged with a diagnosis of ACS or CVA in the 6months before (n=359) and after (n=336) the release of the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association cholesterol guidelines. Patient characteristics were compared using analysis of variance and Ï 2 tests. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess clinical predictors of provider utilization of high-intensity statins. After the 2013 cholesterol guidelines, the rate of prescribing high-intensity statins was greater for statin-naÃ¯ve patients compared with those already on statin therapy (odds ratio [OR]0.51, P=.02). Prescription of high-intensity statins was higher for patients with ACS compared with CVA (OR 8.4, P<.001-pre-2013 guidelines; OR 4.5, P<.001-post-2013 guidelines). Prescription of high-intensity statins steadily improved over the study period, significantly among patients with CVA (P<.001). Physicians were more likely to prescribe high-intensity statins in statin-naÃ¯ve patients as compared with intensifying existing statin therapy, and their prescription pattern was lower after CVA vs ACS.

Their primary mechanism of action is the lowering of serum cholesterol through inhibiting hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis thereby upregulating the hepatic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors and increasing the clearance of LDL-cholesterol. Statins may exert cardiovascular protective effects that are independent of LDL-cholesterol lowering called pleiotropic effects. Because statins inhibit the production of isoprenoid intermediates in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, the post-translational prenylation of small GTP-binding proteins such as Rho and Rac, and their downstream effectors such as Rho kinase and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidases are also inhibited. In cell culture and animal studies, these effects alter the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, the stability of atherosclerotic plaques, the production of proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species, the reactivity of platelets, and the development of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. The relative contributions of statin pleiotropy to clinical outcomes, however, remain a matter of debate and are hard to quantify because the degree of isoprenoid inhibition by statins correlates to some extent with the amount of LDL-cholesterol reduction. This review examines some of the currently proposed molecular mechanisms for statin pleiotropy and discusses whether they could have any clinical relevance in cardiovascular disease.

Recent evidence indicates that cholesterol lowering drugs reduce the risk of aggressive prostate cancer, however the studies in this area, performed over many years, reflect much controversy and uncertainty. Here we explore the entire literature on the relationship between circulating cholesterol and prostate cancer, with consideration and criticism of the older as well as the newer studies. We consider why low cholesterol is associated with both increased and decreased risk of advanced prostate cancer, and explain why both observations are probably correct. We discuss the conflicting results of randomized placebo-controlled trials of statin drugs vs. observational studies and demonstrate that a predominance of pravastatin in the randomized trials paints a distorted view of statin effects. Lastly, we discuss new data suggesting that a critical aspect of the role of cholesterol in prostate cancer progression is through its role in intratumoral steroidogenesis. With these points addressed, the data strongly point to hypercholesterolemia as a risk factor for prostate cancer progression and suggest clinical opportunities for the use of cholesterol lowering therapies to alter disease course.

Statins, widely used cholesterol-lowering drugs, have pleiotropic mechanisms of action and were suggested as potential adjunct therapy for Ebola virus disease (EVD) during the 2013-2016 outbreak in West Africa. Here, we evaluated the antiviral effects of statin (lovastatin) on EBOV infection in vitro Statin treatment decreased infectious EBOV production in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages and in the hepatic cell line Huh7. Statin treatment did not interfere with viral entry, but the viral particles released from treated cells showed reduced infectivity due to inhibition of viral glycoprotein processing, as evidenced by decreased ratios of the mature glycoprotein form to precursor form. Statin-induced inhibition of infectious virus production and glycoprotein processing was reversed by exogenous mevalonate, the rate-limiting product of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, but not by low-density lipoprotein. Finally, statin-treated cells produced EBOV particles devoid of the surface glycoproteins required for virus infectivity. Our findings demonstrate that statin treatment inhibits EBOV infection and suggest that the efficacy of statin treatment should be evaluated in appropriate animal models of EVD. IMPORTANCE Treatments targeting Ebola virus disease (EVD) are experimental, expensive, and scarce. Statins are inexpensive generic drugs that have been used for many years for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and have a favorable safety profile. Here, we show the antiviral effects of statins on infectious Ebola virus (EBOV) production. Our study reveals a novel molecular mechanism in which statin regulates EBOV particle infectivity by preventing glycoprotein processing and incorporation into virus particles. Additionally, statins have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. Since inflammation and dysregulation of the immune\n\nPatients' Perspectives on Nonadherence to Statin Therapy: A Focus-Group Study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nVicki, Fung; Sinclair, Fiona; Wang, Huihui; Dailey, Diane; Hsu, John; Shaber, Ruth\n\n2010-01-01\n\nContext: Nonadherence to statin therapy is associated with poor cardiovascular outcomes. Objective: We explored factors and perceptions that contribute to statin therapy nonadherence. Design: We conducted a qualitative study that was based on three patient focus groups using a structured discussion guide to explore factors related to statin therapy nonadherence, information sources, perceptions of statins and cardiovascular risks factors, and suggestions for improving adherence. Participants: We enrolled 18 adult patients of an integrated delivery system who had been newly prescribed a statin between November 2006 and August 2007, with a subsequent one- to six-month gap in drug supply as documented by automated pharmacy data. Measures: We performed content analysis of verbatim focus-group transcripts to assess themes within each domain. Results: Study participant"
