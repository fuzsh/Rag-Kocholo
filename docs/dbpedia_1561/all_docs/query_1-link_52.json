This annual event, initiated by Tom Wood, first met in the spring of 1989 at the University of Delaware. Nearly 25 entomologists and students, mostly from institutions in the eastern U.S. (Delaware, Kansas, Maryland, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and Washington, D.C.) collected treehoppers and other insects, worked on collaborative projects, and enjoyed camping, eating and swimming. After a fantastic feast of turkey and steak, Stuart McKamey (Systematic Entomology Laboratory, National Museum of Natural History, Washington, D.C. ) shared a TV documentary featuring treehoppers filmed in an expedition to Ecuador (November 2008). The venture, financed by Mona Lisa Productions (Lyon France), included Stuart, who collaborated in organizing the trip, as well as membracid researchers Rex Cocroft (University of Missouri ) and Carolina Godoy (University of Costa Rica). The result is an award-winning documentary: “Aliens of the Amazon: Treehoppers,” which has been released in various versions in the U.S., Canada, France, Germany, Austria, Italy, and Belgium. [L. L.

Please include copyright information (holder and year), name of taxon (if known), and other relevant data for each image. Selected images are featured on the \"Top Pics\" page.\n\nOur current most wanted images include the genera Acanthicoides, Aleptocentrus, Ananthasubramanianum, Aspasiana, Centrobelus, Demanga, Gargarina, Gonoconophora, Insitor, Insitoroides, Matonotus, Megaloschema, Neocentrus, Neomachaerotypus, Occator, Spathenotus, and Tremembaetalion.\n\nOlivia Evangelista and Stuart McKamey recently provided images of three genera previously on our \"Most Wanted List.\"\n\n2011 Annual Treehopper Gathering: 3-5 June, Little Orleans, Maryland\n\n2011-03-20\n\nThe 19th Annual Treehopper Gathering is scheduled for 3-5 June 2011 (arrive Friday, depart Sunday), at the Little Orleans Campground, Little Orleans, Maryland. This informal event provides a great opportunity to talk and collect with others passionate about treehoppers and related insects.\n\nTo register or obtain further information, please contact Charles Bartlett. Campsites are somewhat limited, so please register with Charles if you wish to camp with our group. Participants are expected to provide their own tents, food, and camping gear, and to share in the cost of the group campground registration and the group meal provided on Saturday evening.\n\nTreehoppers Top the Headlines\n\n2011-05-06\n\nAn article featured on the cover of Nature confirms what many of us already knew: Treehoppers are Extraordinary!\n\nPrud'homme et al. (2011) present intriguing evidence that the \"pronotal\" modifications of treehoppers may arise from fused appendages of the prothorax, which are serially homologous with the wings of the meso- and metathorax. Having fused into prothoracic \"helmets\" with no function in flight, the presumptive wing elements diversified to produce the dazzling regalia that adorn members of the families Membracidae, Aetalionidae, and Melizoderidae. See also: Discover Magazine, Science Now, Why Evolution is True (Video), and Why Evolution is True (Origin of Treehopper Helmet).\n\nAmazing treehoppers also appear in a note on Myrmecomorphs.\n\n[L.

For all taxonomic names now entered in our database, the Search option returns either a taxon page (where available) or a report with nomenclatural details. Taxon pages and nomenclatural data for the species group, now in preparation, will eventually be accessible under the valid genus (Browse option) or directly through the Search option. Images are still needed to illustrate 16 genera: Acanthicoides, Aleptocentrus, Ananthasubramanianum, Aspasiana, Centrobelus, Demanga, Gargarina, Gonoconophora, Insitor, Insitoroides, Matonotus, Megaloschema, Neocentrus, Neomachaerotypus, Occator, and Spathenotus.

The new paper, which includes an interactive image depicting the anatomy of the treehopper pronotum, concurs with Yoshizawa (2011) in concluding that the prothoracic superstructure in treehoppers does not correspond to a pair of fused wings, but represents the entire prothorax, except the forelegs.\n\nPreview \"Aliens of the Amazon: Treehoppers\"\n\n2012-01-15\n\nA trailer for the film Aliens of the Amazon: Treehoppers may now be downloaded on online. This award-winning documentary was featured at the 2010 Treehopper Gathering in Little Orleans, Maryland, as noted in our news item on the event.\n\nCongratulations to Dra. Evangelista\n\n2012-03-13\n\nWe are delighted to report that Olivia Evangelista successfully defended her doctoral thesis \"Systematics and Phylogenetic Analysis of the Treehopper Subfamily Heteronotinae Goding, 1926 (Hemiptera, Auchenorrhyncha, Membracidae)\" on 23 February 2012. Working under the direction of Albino M. Sakakibara (Departamento de Zoologia, Universidade Federal do Paraná, Curitiba, Paraná, Brazil), Olive investigated phylogenetic relationships within Heteronotinae based on a combination of morphological and molecular data. The latter included six nuclear and mitochondrial markers (28S, H2A, H3, Wg, COI, ND1), which she compiled in Jason Cryan's lab at the New York State Museum, Albany. A major contributor to the Treehoppers website, Olive provided most of our content on the subfamily Heteronotinae. We are thrilled that Dr. Evangelista is part of our Team.\n\n20th Annual Treehopper Gathering: 1-3 June 2012, Little Orleans, Maryland\n\n2012-04-03\n\nJoin the 20th Annual Treehopper Gathering, 1-3 June 2012 (arrive Friday, depart Sunday), Little Orleans Campground, Little Orleans, Maryland.

It also indicates that Metcalf and Wade's 1965 catalog record of the species for \"Maine\" (citing Poisson and Monguillon, 1931) refers to Le Maine, a former province of France. Thus, Deitz and Wallace's (2012) Nearctic records for G. genistae should be updated to: \"Introduced: USA: Central & Eastern States: CT, NJ; Northwestern States: OR, WA.

You haven't seen it all! Last month, we were fortunate to stumble across an undiscovered world, as far as insects are concerned, not far from the Napo River in tropical Ecuador, and I have returned to tell, or rather to show, the tale. The best of my photos of these amazing creatures will be presented on my Flickr website starting next Monday, the 18th of November, and will continue on weekdays for four weeks. There will be between 4 and 8 photos posted each day. Treehoppers will occupy the first week.

Anyone can now purchase treehopper underwear as well as other \"popular\" treehopper products.\n\nTreehoppers have also found a place in popular films. Treehoppers are mentioned in \"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,\" a historical drama co-written and directed by Peter Weir, and treehopper sounds were used in \" \"A.I. Artifical Intelligence,\" a science fiction film directed by Steven Spielberg.\n\nLast, but not least, we recently discovered an wonderful work of art entitled the \"Green Treehopper,\" and hope someone can tell us the name of the artist who created it.\n\nSpecies Taxon Pages for Monobelini and Nessorhinini\n\n2014-01-28\n\nPopulating the Treehoppers Database is a slow process, and we greatly appreciate your patience as we develop this resource. Treehopper Taxon Pages are available for all genera and higher groups, and we have begun entering Species Pages for selected taxa.\n\nThanks to the assistance of Brendan Morris, our taxon searches now provide Taxon Pages for all valid species in the Caribbean tribes Monobelini and Nessorhinini. These pages may include synonyms (generated from our nomenclatural data), selected references (these will eventually link to a full citation), images, distribution data, diagnosis, and so forth.\n\nNote that Nomenclatural Reports are displayed for invalid taxa (genus group or higher) and for those species (valid or invalid) for which only nomenclatural data have been entered.

American Entomologist 60(1): 14-22.\n\nThis paper presents a phylogeny based on genetic barcode data for “25 species groups representing 36 telamonine treehoppers (Membracidae).” Based on a neighbor-joining analysis of a 658 base-pair segment of the COI gene, the results support the view that treehopper genera defined solely on the basis of pronotal similarity may not be monophyletic. Genetic barcoding is indeed “still in its infancy” (as noted in the paper), so stay tuned.\n\nTwo New Umbelligerus from Panama\n\n2014-06-05\n\nFlynn, D. J. 2014a.

Clark.\n\nAttendees were among the first to see printed copies of \"A review of the Planthoppers (Hemiptera: Fulgoroidea) of the United States,” by Bartlett, O’Brien, and Wilson. \"Hot off the press,\" this impressive and richly illustrated volume includes: a checklist of the 12 families, 167 genera, and 914 species occurring in the contiguous United States, plus 5 further genera (26 species) occurring in Canada and Alaska; keys to the families and genera; summaries of distribution; and an update to Metcalf’s bibliography. Another hot topic of discussion was the status of the genus Campylenchia, recently placed as a junior synonym of Enchenopa (Strümpel and Strümpel 2014a), but supported as a distinct genus in a prior molecular study (Lin, Danforth, and Wood 2004a). Attending systematists noted the need for sound phylogenetic analyses, as well as an examination of evidence from studies of life history, behavior, immatures, male mating calls, and host plant associations.\n\nParticipants collected a variety of insects at lights in the evenings. Images © Copyright 2014, by Luis Camacho.\n\nThis year’s gathering was purposely timed in order to sample species that occur a little later in the collecting season. Thus some later season species were found including a few immatures of the tribe Telamonini. Recognizing the importance of features of immatures in treehopper systematics, Stu McKamey is preparing an identification key to the nymphs of the New World tribes and genera, while Matt Wallace is focusing on the nymphs of the Telamonini. As it stands, the 2015 Gathering will likely be scheduled for early June. We hope to announce the final dates 2 or 3 months before the event.\n\nDysnycritus and the new genus Allodrillus (Membracidae: Heteronotinae)\n\n2014-08-15\n\nEvangelista, O.; Flórez-V, C.; Sakakibara, A. M. 2014a. The identity of the treehopper genus Dysnycritus Fowler, with descriptions of new related taxa (Homoptera: Membracidae: Heteronotinae). Zootaxa 3847(4): 495-532.\n\n[Dysyncritus is redefined to include only D. intectus Fowler. Allodrilus, n. gen., includes 8 spp. (7 new). Nomenclatural changes involve species moved from Dysyncritus to Smiliorachis (resulting in 2 new combinations and a new synonymy) and to Allodrilus (1 new combination). This richly illustrated work includes a key to the males of Allodrilus.]\n\nAnother Dimension to Treehopper Subsociality\n\n2014-08-25\n\nCamacho, L.; Keil, C.; Dangles, O. 2014a. Factors influencing egg parasitism in sub-social insects: insights from the treehopper Alchisme grossa (Hemiptera, Auchenorrhyncha, Membracidae). Ecological Entomology 39(1): 58–65.\n\nThis work explores the impact of maternal care on egg-parasitism in A. grossa. Females of this treehopper guard their egg masses, using their bodies and ponota to cover the eggs. Moreover, females actively ward off egg parasites by fanning their wings and kicking with their club-shaped hind legs. Camacho et al. found that increased numbers of females aggregated on a single host plant lower the risk and levels of egg parasitism through a “herd dilution effect.” The impact of possible cooperation among egg-guarding females adds another dimension to subsociality in the treehopper tribe Hoplophorionini.\n\nPyrgonota bifoliata: a Species Complex\n\n2014-08-26\n\nSu, Y.-C.; Wang, J.-F.; Villanueva, R. J. T.; Nuñeza, O. M.; Lin, C.-P. 2014a. Hopping out of Mindanao: Miocene-Pliocene geological processes and cross-island dispersal as major drivers of diversity for Philippine treehoppers. Journal of Biogeography 41(7): 1277-1290.\n\nWork on the biogeographical history of Pyrgonota bifoliata suggests that Miocene-Pliocene geological events and related cross-island dispersal contributed to species diversity in the Philippines. Using phylogenetic reconstruction based on two genes (mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 1 subunit [cox1] and nuclear wingless [wg]), the authors found evidence of nine cryptic species that form the Pyrgonota bifoliata species complex.\n\nImmatures and Host Plants of Telamonine Treehoppers\n\n2014-10-24\n\nWallace, M. S. 2014a. The host plants of the Telamonini treehoppers (Hemiptera: Membracidae: Smiliinae) and the first diagnoses of nymphs for 14 species. Zootaxa 3878 (2): 146–166.\n\nOwing to their cryptic shapes and coloration, nymphs of the treehopper tribe Telamonini (with 68 species) closely resemble parts of the plants on which they feed and develop. Wallace’s work provides the first comprehensive list of telamonine host plants along with useful morphological diagnoses and color photos for identifying the fifth instar nymphs of 15 species. The cryptic nymph of Archasia belfragei, below, is hidden in plain view (photo © 2013, by Matthew S. Wallace).\n\nMembers of this tribe are recorded from 80 host plant species in 41 genera and 22 families. The total number of hosts species/treehopper ranges from a single host (in 12 telamonine species) to 29 different hosts (in Telamona monticola). Indeed, many telamonines are recorded from more than one plant genus. The genus Quercus serves as a host for 45 of the tribe's 68 species.\n\nMaster of Science Thesis on the Membracidae of Colombia\n\n2014-11-20\n\nGonzález Mozo, L. C. 2014.

Zootaxa 3895(1): 1–30.\n\nThis useful catalogue documents 106 primary and 171 secondary membracid types held at the Museu de Zoologia da Universidade de São Paulo (MZSP). These specimens represent 82 nominal species in 17 treehopper tribes (8 subfamilies). The authors include notes on taxonomy, extensive literature sources, and for each type: precise label data and notes on the condition of the preserved material.\n\nColombian Membracidae: 474 Species in 116 Genera\n\n2015-01-15\n\nFlórez-V., C.; Wolff, M.

[in English with Spanish abstract]\n\nWith color images, diagnoses, and a key for identifying the membracid genera of Colombia, this publication increases the numbers of membracids reported for that country to 116 genera and 474 species. This research was based on the literature, field collections and observations (2011 to 2014), and the examination 3744 specimens held in ten entomological collections in Colombia. The authors provide data on biology and distribution for each genus and also highlight features differentiating the genera Anobilia and Stilbophora (Smiliinae: Tragopini), referring six species from the former to the latter as new combinations.\n\nNew Telamonine Treehopper from Costa Rica: Mutilifolia nishidai\n\n2015-01-23\n\nWallace, M.

Zootaxa 3914 (1): 83–88.\n\n© 2015, Kenji Nishida\n\nThe new genus and species Mutilifolia nishidai differs from those of all known telamonine genera in bearing two recurved teeth on the male style clasp. The species is named in honor of treehopper enthusiast Kenji Nishida, who collected the type material at the Monteverde Biological Station in the highlands of Costa Rica. Kenji regularly contributes exceptional photos of treehoppers to this Website, including the images above. The pronotum of Mutilifolia--folicaceous, highly elevated, largely green--is similar to that in species of Antianthe, Archasia, and Hemicardiacus.\n\nNeotropical Treehoppers: Recent Discoveries\n\n2015-02-09\n\nSakakibara, A.

We are not talking about George Willis Kirkaldy’s generic names for many insects, such as “Ohchisme, Dolichisme, Elachisme, Florichisme, Marichisme, Nanichisme, Peggichisme, and Polychisme,” all of which are considered sweet because the suffix “-chisme” (Greek) is pronounced “kiss-me”--nor even his treehopper genus “Alchisme,” which was perhaps more provocative when first proposed in 1904. Rather we refer to the common American pronunciation of the genus “Heranice,” which, if carelessly pronounced, may sound just as offensive as the usual American pronunciation of the name of the seventh planet from the sun. Here, we endorse the Portuguese pronunciation, in which the initial “H” is silent and the final “ce” is pronounced like the English word “see.”\n\nIn contrast, Spanish speakers would do well to Anglicize the unfortunate genus name “Llanquihuea” (based on Llanquihue, a province in Chile), thus not pronouncing the double “L” as a “Y.” Apparently, in Spanish this name sounds either hilarious or vulgar, depending on one’s point of view.\n\nTo reduce the large number of useless petitions to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature requesting the suppression of these names, we urge workers to preserve the dignity of treehoppers by pronouncing their names with care, decency, and good taste.\n\n--Treehopper Specialists’ Declaration of 1 April 2015\n\n23rd Annual Treehopper Gathering: 5-7 June 2015, Little Orleans, Maryland\n\n2015-04-07\n\nJoin the 2015 Treehopper Gathering, set for 5 to 7 June (arrive Friday, depart Sunday), at the Little Orleans Campground, Little Orleans, Maryland.

Our Saturday evening feast, always a highlight of the weekend, featured turkey (deep fried), steak, venison (all prepared by Anthony Gonzon), and teriyaki chicken (prepared by Yuri Park), as well as salads, various veggies (including baked potatoes and sweet potatoes), and desserts. Between meals, picnic tables were generally cluttered with drawers, boxes, and vials of treehoppers and other insects, including fresh insects being processed, hundreds of preserved specimens to be lent, returned, or donated to attendees or others at their home institutions, and an incredible display of treehoppers that Mark Rothschild collected this spring. (See photos 2-3).\n\nWhile Vinton Thompson was off collecting spittlebugs, his wife Ruth Moscovitch sketched the valley view from Saint Patrick’s, a church surrounded by the Little Orleans Campground. Near this church, vines of Virginia creeper host a spectacular treehopper, Telamona ampelopsidis.

Metcalf used unique bibliographic identifiers (author, year plus letter suffix) for works cited throughout his catalogues and bibliographies of the Auchenorrhyncha, the insect suborder of Hemiptera that includes treehoppers. Covering works published through 1955, his identifiers were widely used by many subsequent workers and continue to be used on such online resources as the Treehoppers Website and the Planthopper Digital Library.\n\nDrMetcalf and the Internet Archive. Using the searchable DrMetcalf database, one can easily expand Metcalf’s identifiers to full bibliographic citations that provide essential data for locating and viewing the publications. With journal articles, the full journal title, volume, and start page are often key to locating the publication (individual article titles and authors may or may not be indexed in databases). Indeed, hundreds of early publications, including rare books and obscure serials, are now available online through the Biodiversity Heritage Library and other resources of the Internet Archive.\n\nIndex to Treehopper Publications in the Digital Library for Pre-1940 Planthopper Literature.

Among treehopper enthusiasts, Walker is known for his works on the collections of the British Museum of Natural History (now the Natural History Museum), which holds many, but not all, of his types.\n\nThe following links to Walker’s treehopper publications in the Biodiversity Hertitage Library were compiled by Lewis L. Deitz and Matthew S. Wallace in July 2015: Walker 1851a; Walker 1851b; Walker 1852a; Walker 1857a; Walker 1857b; Walker 1858a; Walker 1858b; Walker 1859a; Walker 1860a; Walker 1862a; Walker 1868b; Walker 1868c; [Walker 1870a].\n\nEnter “Francis Walker” in the author search box of the DrMetcalf database to view a full list of Walker’s works in Metcalf’s bibliography of the Auchenorrhyncha.\n\nNote that \"Walker 1870a,\" of Z. P. Metcalf and other authors, is an error for “Walker 1868b” and “Walker 1868c” (here designated to conform to Metcalf’s system of unique identifiers). Based on a published extract, Metcalf catalogued the new genera and species from this work as published in 1870, however, at least two bound copies of volume 10 of the Journal of the Linnean Society of London (Friedrich F. Tippmann's copy at North Carolina State University; also Smithsonian's copy) include an initial page indicating pp. 69-132 were published 7 Aug. 1868 (Walker 1868b), and pp. 133-196 were published 25 Sept. 1868 (Walker 1868c). For purposes of nomenclature, the new taxa included were thus described in 1868 (not 1870).\n\nCarl Stål's Publications on Treehoppers\n\n2015-08-11\n\nWidely regarded as the leading hemipterist of his time, Swedish entomologist Carl Stål (1833–1878) described extraordinary numbers of treehoppers: 124 genera or subgenera, 199 species, and 1 subspecies. Even though a couple of Stål's genera later proved to be leafhoppers, 84 of his treehopper genera remain valid today, as well as 135 treehopper species, 2 subspecies (1 being a nominotypical subspecies), and his well known family group names Smiliinae, Smilini, and Tragopini. Stål published not only on various groups of Hemiptera, but also on beetles, hymenopterans, and orthopterans.\n\nAll of Stål's works on treehoppers listed here are currently in the Biodiversity Hertitage Library:Stål 1853b; Stål 1854b; Stål 1855a; Stål 1858a; Stål 1858b; Stål 1858f; Stål 1859b; Stål 1862b; Stål 1862e; Stål 1863c; Stål 1864a; Stål 1866a; Stål 1866c; Stål 1867a; Stål 1869a; Stål 1869c; Stål 1870c.\n\nThe HathiTrust Digital Library includes W.

Funkhouser’s typewritten English translations of Stål 1864a (Funkhouser’s translation); Stål 1866a (Funkhouser’s translation); Stål 1866c (Funkhouser’s translation); Stål 1869c (Funkhouser’s translation).\n\nEnter “Carl Stal” in the author search box of the DrMetcalf database to view a full list of Stål's works in Metcalf’s bibliography of the Auchenorrhyncha.\n\nL. M. H. Fairmaire’s Publications on Treehoppers\n\n2015-08-18\n\nAlthough best known for his many contributions on Coleoptera (beetles), French entomologist Léon Marc Herminie Fairmaire (1820-1906) worked also on the insect orders Hemiptera and Hymenoptera. His currently valid treehopper taxa include the genera Acutalis, Aconophora, Darnoides, Horiola, Ophiderma, and Smiliorachis and 177 species.\n\nFairmaire’s works on treehoppers are available online (either the original or a subsequently reprinted version) as follows: Fairmaire 1845a; Fairmaire 1846a; Fairmaire 1846b; Fairmaire 1846c; Fairmaire 1851a; Fairmaire 1855a [see Fairmaire 1885a, a reprint with the same pagination]; Fairmaire 1885a, [Plates 7-9]; Fairmaire and Signoret 1858a, [Plate XI]; Fairmaire and Signoret 1858b [this reprint of Fairmaire and Signoret 1858a (which see) differs in pagination].\n\nEnter \"Fairmaire\" in the author search box of the DrMetcalf database to view a full list of Fairmaire’s works in Metcalf’s bibliography of the Auchenorrhyncha.\n\nGood Vibrations Key To Insect Communication\n\n2015-09-02\n\nIn its special series \"Close Listening: Decoding Nature Through Sound,\" National Public Radio recently aired Good Vibrations Key To Insect Communication (Christopher Joyce and Bill McQuay, 27 August 2015). Highlighting the work of treehopper researcher Rex Cocroft and tree cricket researcher Laurel Symes, the link allows one to hear the original broadcast along with additional communications of treehoppers and tree crickets.

S. 2015b. Taxonomic changes in the treehopper genera Helonica Ball, Telamona Fitch, and Palonica Ball (Hemiptera: Membracidae; Smiliinae: Telamonini). Zootaxa 4007(2): 251-258.\n\nTelamona projecta Butler. © 2010, by Matthew S. Wallace\n\nWallace’s recent fingings: (1) placed Helonica as a junior synonym of Telamona ; (2) created the new combination Telamona excelsa (Fairmaire), with the new junior synonym T. unicolor Fitch; (3) reinstated Telamona projecta Butler as valid for the species formerly incorrectly identified as \"Helonica excelsa\" in the central and eastern United States (see figure, above); and (4) reinstated Palonica albidorsata (Fowler), new combination, as a valid species from Veracruz, Mexico.\n\nAs a consequence of these changes, Deitz and Wallace’s 2002 checklist of Nearctic species should be further updated as follows: p. 9, delete Helonica excelsa (Fairmaire 1846); p. 13, insert \"Telamona excelsa (Fairmaire 1846): USA: Southwestern States: TX; Central & Eastern States: AL, AR, CT, DE, FL, IA, IL, IN, KS, KY, MA, MD, MI, MN, MO, NC, NE, NJ, NY, OH, OK, PA, TN, WI. CANADA: Central & Eastern Provinces: ON, QC. Fairmaire described this species from Mexico (no locality was specified, so this species may be endemic to the Nearctic or may also occur in Neotropical Mexico)\"; insert \"Telamona projecta Butler 1877: USA: Central & Eastern States: DE, IA, IL, MD, MO, NJ, NY, SC, TN\"; delete Telamona unicolor Fitch 1851. For a prior update, see archive of past news: \"Recent Papers\" (posted 2015-07-03).\n\niDigBio Portal for Specimen Data on Treehoppers\n\n2015-09-08\n\nKatja Seltmann alerts us that thousands of specimen records for North American treehoppers are now available online at the iDigBio Portal. Moreover, label data and images for millions of biological specimens are accessible through Integrated Digitized Biocollections (iDigBio), a resource funded by the National Science Foundation. Browsing the tutorial is recommended to make searches easier and more productive. Standard search results for treehopper species include a distribution map and a list of specimen records (view sample record for Carynota mera).\n\nUsing the Advance Search with \" Membracidae\" as the search term, Charles Bartlett found more than 113,000 specimen records, including some data not currently displayed in the standard search. These detailed records can be downloaded in a csv file sent to the email account one specifies. The specimen data, which in some cases include “host associations” or “host family,” arrive in a zipped folder that includes several files--the most useful of these, the 'occurrence' file, can be opened in Microsoft Excel. Because the file structure varied among institutions, persistence and patience may aid in reviewing the data.\n\nAnother approach for retrieving data from iDigBio is iDigBio API, an abstraction layer that allows reuse and mashup of aggregated data without a knowledge of the complexity of the back-end data storage.\n\nWilliam Weeks Fowler's Contributions on Treehoppers and 10 Plates by Edwin Wilson\n\n2015-09-13\n\nWilliam Weeks Fowler (1850-1922), an English entomologist and clergyman, is best known to hemipterists for his contributions to the Biologia Centrali-Americana. Among the many new treehopper taxa that Fowler described, 26 genera, 1 subgenus, 143 species, 4 subspecies, and the tribe Acutalini (Smiliinae) remain valid. Fowler’s sections of the Biologia Centrali-Americana include 10 extraordinary plates depicting treehoppers, all drawn and printed by Edwin Wilson, of Cambridge, England (\"Introduction\" to Insecta: Rhynchota: Hemiptera-Homoptera, Volume 2, Part 1). The highlighted plate numbers under the thumbnails below link to the corresponding plates in the Smithsonian Institution's copy of this work in the Biodiversity Heritage Library.\n\nPlate 1 (Fowler 1894b).

Image © 2015, by Matt Zehr.\n\nThe North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, Raleigh, N. C., is host to BugFest, the largest celebration of insects anywhere. Year after year, this event attracts tens of thousands of insect enthusiasts. BugFest 2015 was held on 18 September 2015, and the focal insect was the \"cicada.\" Treehopper aficionados will be pleased to learn that Jason Cryan provided balance to the program by highlighting membracids and other charming cicada relatives in his superb talk Cicadas' Charismatic Cousins.\n\nTreehoppers: Under Appreciated or Keystone Taxa?\n\n2015-10-02\n\nWagner, D. L.; Gagliardi, B. L. 2015a. Hairstreaks (and other insects) feeding at galls, honeydew, extrafloral nectaries, sugar bait, cars, and other routine substrates. American Entomologist 61(3): 160-167.\n\nIn their discussion of the importance of non-floral sugar resources (NFSRs) to hairstreak butterflies, moths, and \"hordes\" of other insects, entomologists Wagner and Gagliardi suggest these non-floral resources may exceed even flowers, as the primary source of carbohydrates for thousands of adult holometabolous insects. Thus, treehoppers and other honeydew-producing Hemiptera possibly play a far greater role in the population dynamics of insects than anyone previously recognized.\n\nWe conclude that treehoppers are indeed keystone taxa. In addition to being significant components of many ecosystems around the world, treehoppers increasingly serve as model organisms for studies of ecology, evolution, and behavior, and also bring joy to all who appreciate the beauty and diversity of the natural world. [L. L. Deitz and M. S. Wallace]\n\nImmature Stages of New World Treehoppers: First Installment, Amastrini\n\n2015-10-04\n\nMcKamey, S. H.; Wallner, A. M.; Porter, M. J. 2015a. Immatures of the New World treehopper tribe Amastrini (Hemiptera, Membracidae, Smiliinae) with a key to genera. ZooKeys 524: 65-87.\n\nThis open access publication is the first in a series intended to provide a guide to identifying the immatures of the New World treehopper genera. Although focused on the tribe Amastrini, this installment reviews prior studies on nymphal membracids in general and provides an overview of the morphological features used to describe them. Here, McKamey et al. provide the first descriptions of the immatures of 8 genera (of 11 total in the tribe), along with an illustrated key to the genera and observations on their biology. With 65 figures (many in color), this work is an essential resource for identifying nymphs of the tribe Amastrini.\n\nBased on its distinct nymphal morphology, Vanduzea laeta nolina Ball is elevated to the rank of species: Vanduzea nolina, new status. Nymphal morphology is also used to support the recognition of Bajulata as a valid genus, distinct from Vanduzea.\n\nWe learn from the paper’s literature review that the earliest known study on treehopper immatures seems to have been completed between 1783 and 1794, by H. R. Scheller [published in 1869: Scheller 1869a, plates 8-10]. Nevertheless, even today the immatures of most membracid taxa remain to be described. Thus, we eagerly look forward to future papers by McKamey and associates that will describe the nymphs of additional New World genera and tribes.\n\nGuide to Treehopper Workers of the 1700s and Their Publications\n\n2015-10-16\n\nThis guide provides access to virtual copies of most of the literature on treehoppers by scholars of the 1700s, including their further works into the 1800s. One exception is Pierre A. Latreille, whose 1796a work is listed here, but not his 24 additional references on treehoppers published during the 1800s. Also excluded here are workers, such as H. R. Scheller, whose first publication appeared after 1799. The earliest work listed here is Linnaeus’s (1746a: p. 202) description of his species number 641, subsequently named Centrotus cornutus Linnaeus, 1758. Owing to modern technology and awe-inspiring international collaboration, this collection of rare and priceless publications is at your fingertips.\n\nEarly contributions on treehoppers were sometimes published over a period of two or more years and subsequently bound into a single volume with a title page and introductory materials. Because of the principle of priority among taxonomic names, it is essential to establish the actual date of publication for each section of such works that describe new taxa (the section date may differ from that on the title page). Furthermore, the sequence of sections and placement of plates may vary among various bound copies of a work. In the absence of photography, illustrations were frequently produced from copper engravings (plates), and some were individually hand-colored, each plate being a unique work of art.\n\nSelected early natural history plates with figures of treehoppers: 1, Coquebert 1799a: Pl. 8, Fig. 1; 2 , Coquebert 1799a: Pl. 9, Fig. 5; 3, Coquebert 1801a: Pl. 18, Figs. 1-10; 4, Coquebert 1804a: Pl. 21, Fig. 5; 5, Houttuyn 1766a: Pl. 81, Fig. 2; 6, Linnaeus 1761a: Pl. 2, Fig. 279; 7, Panzer 1798a: Pl. 50.19, Membracis cornutus; 8, Panzer 1798a: Pl. 50.20, Membracis genistae; 9, Donovan 1794a: Pl. 83; 10, Donovan 1820d: Hemiptera Pl. 3, C. spinosa, C. taurus; 11, Stoll 1788a: Pl.

Metcalf took care in establishing publication dates, and we follow his dates unless convincing evidence has come to our attention indicating a needed correction. In this regard, during the compilation of the present guide, we discovered Index Novus Litteraturae Entomologicae, an updated bibliography of the literature on entomology from the beginning until 1863, which appears to be a useful resource for verifying publication dates.

By the way, a “lunule” is the white crescent-shaped area at the base of one’s fingernail--lunules vary in size and may even be absent in some individuals. More frequently, early entomological workers used “lines” as a unit of measurement, but the definition of a line varied among the English, French (ligne), and Germans (linie), and, in some instances, the definition varied even within a country. The Website www.coleoptera.com includes a brief overview of early entomological measurements. To convert some of the more commonly used \"lines\" to millimeters, see “Notes on the line as a unit of measurement,” p. 11, from von Hayek, 1973, Bulletin of the British Museum (Natural History), Entomology Supplement 20: 1-309.\n\nTreehopper Publications of E. P. Van Duzee and L. B. Woodruff\n\n2015-11-09\n\nMost works on treehoppers by American entomologists Edward Payson Van Duzee (1861-1940) and Lewis Bartholomew Woodruff (1868-1925) are readily available online through the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL). Two of Woodruff’s papers (1923a, 1924a), not currently available at BHL, are accessible through the digital library JSTOR (see Options for Access). For detailed citations of the works by either author, enter his last name in the author search box of DrMetcalf. We note that \"Van Duzee 1890a,” which seems to treat only extant leafhoppers, was apparently listed in Metcalf and Wade’s 1963 bibliography on treehoppers and fossil Auchenorrhyncha in error.\n\nHemipterist Edward P. Van Duzee described 3 treehopper genera (Idioderma, Tylocentrus, and Xantholobus), 43 species (36 now valid, including 2 that are also nominotypical subspecies) and 3 subspecies (2 now valid subspecies, 1 invalid). The California Academy of Sciences, where Van Duzee served as curator (1916-1940), holds his collection of Hemiptera (164,442 specimens). Van Duzee’s 1908a plates 1 and 2, below, show simple line drawings of representative North American treehoppers.\n\nVan Duzee’s Treehopper Publications: Van Duzee 1889b; Van Duzee 1890c; Van Duzee 1892d; Van Duzee 1893b; Van Duzee 1894e; Van Duzee 1895e; Van Duzee 1905a; Van Duzee 1906a; Van Duzee 1907a; Van Duzee 1908a; Van Duzee 1908b; Van Duzee 1909a; Van Duzee 1909c; Van Duzee 1912a; Van Duzee 1912b; Van Duzee 1914a; Van Duzee 1914c; Van Duzee 1916a; Van Duzee 1916b; Van Duzee 1917a; Van Duzee 1917b; Van Duzee 1923a; Van Duzee 1925b.\n\nLewis B. Woodruff authored 18 treehopper species (16 now valid) and 2 subspecies (1 now elevated to species, 1 invalid), all belonging to the tribe Smiliini. See our news posting of 2012-09-14 [archive of past news], for further information on Woodruff, who at one time had a desk at the American Museum Natural History. The following plates are from Woodruff 1915a (pl. 4, figs. 1-5, now Atymna helena); fig. 6, now A. querci) and 1919a (pl. 23; Ophiderma spp. [Woodruff’s captions include some junior synonyms]).\n\nWoodruff’s Treehopper Publications: Woodruff 1915a; Woodruff 1919a; Woodruff 1920a; Woodruff 1923a; Woodruff 1924a.\n\n[Compiled by Matthew S.

Occurrence of treehopper (Hemiptera: Membracidae) bycatch on purple panel traps and Lindgren funnel traps in Pennsylvania, with new state records. Great Lakes Entomologist 48(3-4): 172-185.\n\nSurveys incorporating Lindgren funnel traps and purple panel traps in Pennsylvania (2009-2013) captured 57 native treehopper species, including four not previously reported for the state: Heliria gibberata Ball 1925, Palonica pyramidata (Uhler 1877), Telamona projecta Butler 1877, and Telamona westcotti Goding 1893. Barringer’s work suggests that, with proper site selection, Lindgren funnel traps may be especially useful in monitoring the seasonal distribution of treehoppers, particularly species in the tribes Smiliini and Telamonini.\n\nE. D. Ball’s Publications on Treehoppers\n\n2016-01-19\n\nAmerican entomologist Elmer Darwin Ball (1870–1943) was a specialist on treehoppers and other Auchenorrhyncha. Born in Vermont, he graduated from Iowa State College (B.S., M.S.) and Ohio State University (Ph.D.). Working briefly as a school teacher, Ball had an energetic career with appointments across the U.S.: Albion Seminary (assistant principal), Iowa State College (taught entomology and zoology; later, department head), Colorado Agricultural College (taught entomology and zoology), Utah Agricultural College (professor), the United States Department of Agriculture, the Florida State Plant Board, and the University of Arizona (dean of the College of Agriculture; director of the Agricultural Experiment Station). Moreover, he also served as the State Entomologist of Wisconsin and as the Assistant Secretary of Agriculture. Ball’s extensive collection is now held by the National Museum of Natural History, Washington, D.C.\n\nRegarding treehoppers, Ball described one subfamily (Stictocephalinae, now a junior synonym of the tribe Ceresini), 6 new genera (Bajulata, Bryantopsis, Grandolobus, Helonica, Palonica, and Telonaca–all remain valid), 58 new species (52 remain valid--3 are now also nominotypical subspecies), and 13 subspecies (all remain valid, including 1 elevated to species).\n\nPlate 1 from Ball 1903a shows 9 new species he described in the genus Telamona: Fig. 1, T. extrema; 2, T. obsoleta [= T. westcotti]; 3, T. viridia [now in Palonica]; 4, T. ehrhorni [= Heliria sinuata]; 5, T. compacta; 6, T. decorata; 7, T. pruinosa [= T. collina]; 8, T. brevis [= Telamonanthe pulchella]; 9, T. pulchella [now in Telamonanthe].\n\nPublications of E. D. Ball. All but three of Ball’s works on treehoppers are currently available online through the Biodiversity Heritage Library: Ball 1903a; Ball 1905a; Ball 1915b; Ball 1918a; Ball 1920b; Ball 1925a; Ball 1931f [needed (monograph of the tribe Telamonini)]; Ball 1932b [needed (food plants of various groups)]; Ball 1932c; Ball 1933a; Ball 1937d; Osborn and Ball 1897a [needed (hemipteran fauna of Iowa)].\n\n[Compiled by Matthew S. Wallace and Lewis L. Deitz]\n\n2015 Stamps Feature Ecuadorian Treehoppers\n\n2016-02-16\n\nAn Ecuadorian issue of stamps entitled \"Membrácidos del Ecuador\" features stunning images of treehoppers from Ecuador, taken by nature photographer Milan Kozánek of Bratislava, Slovakia. Eight species are represented including members of the Neotropical genera: Antianthe, Cyphonia, Guayaquila, Heteronotus, Membracis, Stegaspis, Thuris, and Tritropidia. For information on other \"Treehoppers on Stamps\", see our archive of past news dated 2014-02-25. Many thanks to Milan for sharing his wonderful treehopper images with the world and for bringing these stamps to our attention. We also thank Matt Bertone for assistance in preparing the figure below.\n\nImmatures and Nomenclatural Changes in Thuridini\n\n2016-02-18\n\nMcKamey, S. H.; Porter, M. J. 2016a. First immature of the New World treehopper tribe Thuridini (Hemiptera, Membracidae, Smiliinae) with a new synonym, a new combination, and a new country record. ZooKeys 557: 85-91. [available online]\n\nThis work adds Ecuador and Venezuela to the distribution of the genus Thuris (previously known from Brazil and Peru) and describes the late instar nymphs of T. binodosus (Goding), new combination [with T. depressus Sakakibara as its junior synonym]. The genus may be subsocial based on the observation of an aggregation consisting of four late instars along with four adults. Both nymphs and adults are illustrated.\n\n© 2012, by Milan Kozánek. Adult of Thuris binodosus (Goding).\n\nExcluded from Treehopperdom\n\n2016-02-24\n\nAt least 18 genera described as treehoppers have since been reassigned to various other insect groups ranging from pygmy grasshoppers to froghoppers, lacebugs, leafhoppers, and various groups of extinct Hemiptera. An example is the Afrotropical pygmy grasshopper genus Xerophyllum Fairmaire (1846a: pl. 4, figs. 10-12 [see below]) that superficially resembles members of the Neotropical treehopper genus Membracis. Thus, some genera listed in early catalogues of the family Membracidae may be missing in more recent listings for the group. Additionally, the genus Eteonus, although not initially described as a treehopper, was inadvertently listed as a membracid by Neave 1939b. The present summary directs users to the current status and placement of these bewildering genera that may seem to have vanished from treehopperdom.\n\nLeft, Fairmaire 1846a: pl. 4.
