        "text": "⛏ Kula Gold Limited's Rankin Dome Project update - from The West Australian: 'WA rare earths results trigger Kula share price hike'. \"Kula Gold’s share price jumped 40 per cent today after its Rankin Dome Project’s earn-in partner Australian Critical Minerals revealed leach results that include rare earths head grades of up to 1674ppm total rare earth oxides (TREO). ACM’s metallurgical laboratory leach tests on drill samples from the Rankin Dome project near the historic Western Australian town of Southern Cross also showed the more valuable magnetic rare earths oxides comprise 23 per cent of the TREO. The testwork by ANSTO (the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation) involved the preliminary leachability testing of selected Rankin Dome reverse-circulation (RC) drill samples for their rare earths content. A total of 18 drill samples were used to prepare seven head samples, made up of four composites and three individual samples, to produce an 80g sub-sample for leach testing. Sample head grade analyses ranged between 1148ppm and 1674ppm TREO, with oxides of the magnetic rare earth oxides praseodymium, neodymium, dysprosium and terbium determined to make up between 21 and 23 per cent of the TREO. The magnetic rare earths component is not only valuable for its application in electric motors and the high-efficiency electricity generators that are now in high demand, but it is also more easily parted from its non-magnetic rare earths by magnetic separation methods.\" ⚙ Full Article: https://lnkd.in/dpJCBMbE #exploration #mining #westernaustralia\n\nVery constructive for Laramide Resources Ltd (TSX:LAM ASX:LAM) with its 117M+ pounds of #uranium across 5 deposits in the US and Australia. Current market cap of C$200M is only 20% of where it peaked in the 2007 cycle (not inflation adjusted) when it only had roughly half the pounds it now has - so lots of room to run in here potentially. In 2007, Uranium went to $136/lb spot price and Laramide to C$16.70 at a time C$ was stronger than US$. Since then the number of shares in issue has roughly tripled although relative to its peers, its cap structure is still much tighter as the board has fought dilution over the past 16 year uranium bear market and spend was kept low even while the resource was grown. The recent preliminary economic analysis (\"PEA\") on its US Churchrock deposit showed the deposit could cashflow roughly $1B over the next 31 years at $75/lb uranium price. Uranium is now over $100 and climbing. This PEA also uses an ISR extraction rate of 1M lbs per year in its model when the company's Nuclear Regulatory Commission licence allows for 3M lbs per year. Only one permit is currently missing before the company starts production and that is relating to water reclamation. The company has received a US Department of Energy grant to work with Los Alamos labs on getting that reissued. The 2016 PEA on its Australian huge Westmoreland deposit showed a NPV of $400M (US) using $65/lb uranium spot price. Again uranium is over $100/lb and climbing... Laramide also just announced it is resuming its work with the US Forest Service on an environmental impact statement on its 10M lb La Jara Mesa deposit. This is a hard rock deposit in a mesa above a valley and critically above the local water table. Its high grade 3M lb La Sal hard rock deposit is also almost mine ready and can potentially be toll milled at Energy Fuels mill just down the road at Blanding. Energy Fuels has just announced its intention to use that mill for uranium production. Finally, great exploration results continue to be announced from last year's expansion drill program at Westmoreland. This district sized deposit just keeps getting larger and the company already has identified more step out drill targets with high scintilometer readings at surface. The resource is not only huge but almost at surface. The PEA on the existing 50M+ lb reserve uses an incredibly low 4:1 strip ratio with resulting low capex. The company is well funded so exciting times look to be ahead as this third uranium bull market finally gets underway. As Chairman and a long term investor I cannot recall a time I have been more optimistic about the future prospects for the company.

This SPP, plus the funds from the recently announced A$220M placement, together totalling A$250M, will support our growth strategy, the ongoing development of the flagship Tumas Project in Namibia and the advancement of the Mulga Rock Project in Western Australia. Tranche 1 of the placement has been completed and I have great confidence in completing Tranche 2 of the placement following the general meeting of shareholders on 30 April,” said Deep Yellow’s Managing Director and CEO, John Borshoff said. Deep Yellow Limited plans to establish a globally diversified, Tier-1 uranium company aiming to produce 10 million pounds of uranium per year. The company’s projects provide geographic and development diversity with two advanced projects, flagship, the Tumas and the Mulga Rock in Western Australia. Tumas has a resource of 121 million pounds of uranium oxide, a reserve of 67 million pounds of uranium and Inferred resources of 16.5 million pounds available to further expand the ore reserve base, with potential to add a further 10 years to the current 22-year Life-of-Mine. The Tumas Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS) completed in February 2023 was undertaken during a period of significant inflationary and supply logistical volatility. The company expects to make a Final Investment Decision (FID) on the Tumas in the third quarter of 2024 while the Mulga Rock will advance to a definite feasibility study. Deep Yellow plans further growth through development of its highly prospective exploration portfolio, the Alligator River in Northern Territory, Australia and the Omahola in Namibia. Deep Yellow believes it is advancing its growth strategy at a time when the need for nuclear energy is becoming the only viable option in the mid-to-long term to provide baseload power supply and achieve zero emission targets. “Importantly, Deep Yellow is on track to becoming a reliable and long-term uranium producer, able to provide production optionality, security of supply and geographic diversity,” the company said.\n\nDasa Uranium Project Remains on Schedule to Produce Yellowcake in Q1 2026 Toronto, ON, August 12, 2024: Global Atomic announced today its operating and financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Global Atomic President and CEO, Stephen G. Roman commented, “We continue to make significant progress at our Dasa Uranium Project, currently employing over 450 people at site and expecting to increase that number to 900 once plant construction is in full swing. We have an excellent relationship with the government and have the support of their entire cabinet, as they appreciate the jobs and economic benefit that Dasa will create for Niger.” “As for project financing, the recent C$20 million private placement has allowed continued advancement of the project while the U.S. development bank moves our debt financing facility through its approval process. Although the bank postponed their July presentation of our Project to their credit committee, we remain confident that the bank will eventually approve our Project. Should the bank further delay their approval, we will move to finalize other financing discussions, which include minority JV partners and pre-payments tied to uranium offtake.” “The Dasa Project is unique as the highest-grade uranium project in Africa and the only greenfield uranium project being actively developed today. With an IRR of 57% at a uranium price of $75 per pound, this project is compelling, and the economic returns will only improve as we move closer to production in 2026. This project will get funded and will get built.” https://lnkd.in/g7Vk6Jwg\n\nGlobal Brain has invested in MiRESSO, Co., Ltd. (MiRESSO), a company aiming to implement fusion into society through stable supply of mineral resources, through its JGC MIRAI Innovation Fund L.P. (JGC MIRAI Innovation Fund). Fusion reactor operation in several systems, including the mostly used Tokamak type, requires large amounts of beryllium (Be) as a component material for the fusion reactor blanket. However, the price of beryllium is currently very high, and since more beryllium is needed per reactor than is currently produced in the world, a supply shortage is anticipated in the future. MiRESSO is a fusion startup certified by the National Institutes for Quantum Science and Technology (QST), and the company realizes beryllium purification at an overwhelmingly low cost and reduced energy consumption through its low-temperature purification technology. MiRESSO aims to become a company that contributes to implementing fusion into society as well as securing stable supply of mineral resources from the perspective of economic security by expanding its technology to refining of other minerals and materials that require high temperature processing. Global Brain has decided to invest in MiRESSO, highly recognizing its know-how and technological capabilities for heating a mixture of beryl ore (raw material for beryllium) and reagents, and also hoping for the success of its excellent management team, the company’s impact on the fusion market, and market potential. Global Brain will contribute to the business growth of MiRESSO in cooperation with the JGC Group. https://lnkd.in/gNqJDZsb"
