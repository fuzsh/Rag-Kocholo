However, despite this broad consensus and its technical maturity, CCS has not yet been deployed on a scale commensurate with the ambitions articulated a decade ago. Thus, in this paper we review the current state-of-the-art of CO2 capture, transport, utilisation and storage from a multi-scale perspective, moving from the global to molecular scales. In light of the COP21 commitments to limit warming to less than 2 °C, we extend the remit of this study to include the key negative emissions technologies (NETs) of bioenergy with CCS (BECCS), and direct air capture (DAC). Cognisant of the non-technical barriers to deploying CCS, we reflect on recent experience from the UK's CCS commercialisation programme and consider the commercial and political barriers to the large-scale deployment of CCS. In all areas, we focus on identifying and clearly articulating the key research challenges that could usefully be addressed in the coming decade.\n\nBroader context\n\nCarbon capture and storage (CCS) is recognised as being vital to least cost pathways for climate change mitigation, and in particular the negative emissions technologies (NETs) that are key to limiting warming to “well below” 2C. However, it has not yet been deployed on the scale understood to be required, owing to a variety of technical, economic and commercial challenges. This paper provides a state-of-the-art update of each of these areas, and provides a perspective on how to the discipline forward, highlighting key research challenges that should be addressed over the course of the next decade. Importantly, this perspective balances scientific, policy and commercial priorities.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThis paper is the third installment in a series of publications over several years in Energy & Environmental Science.1,2 The first (published in 2010) provided an introduction to CO2 capture technologies, with an overview of solvent-based chemisorption (amines and ionic liquids), carbonate looping, oxy-fuel combustion technologies, CO2 conversion and utilisation (CCU) and multi-scale process engineering of CCS.1 The second installment presented an update on developments in amine scrubbing, ionic liquids, oxy-combustion and calcium looping. New topics added in this second paper include chemical looping combustion, low temperature adsorbents, direct air capture technologies, flexible CCS operation, CO2 transport and storage, and a historical overview of the UK and EU CCS policy and legislation.2\n\nDistinct from the previous installments, this third paper sets out to comprehensively review the state-of-the-art developments in CCS, whilst also providing a holistic perspective on the role of CCS technologies in mitigating anthropogenic climate change. We first discuss the current status of CCS development and highlight key CCS technologies that are near commercialisation phase (Section 2). Then in Section 3 we contextualise CCS technology by considering its representation and utilisation in integrated assessment models (IAMs), challenging the view that it is a “bridging technology”, likely to be relevant for only a few decades. We then go on to quantify and qualify the role and value of CCS at a more granular level by evaluating the way in which CCS interacts with national scale electricity systems. This in turn helps us address the question of what service CCS provides to the electricity system, with whom is CCS competing and what technologies does CCS complement.\n\nWe then move on to consider the utility of CCS in decarbonising the industrial sector, with a focus on the key emitters – the production of iron and steel, cement and oil refining and petrochemicals. Throughout, we aim to challenge the perception that industrial CCS is uniquely costly, showing that, for example, the cost of decarbonising the refining sector is essentially “lost in the noise” of market fluctuations of the end use sectors.\n\nSection 4 of the paper considers key post-combustion CCS technologies in detail. The purpose of this paper is not to enumerate the panoply of technologies that are available for capturing CO2. Rather, we focus on solid- and liquid-phase sorbents, and attempt to specify key research questions that need to be address in these areas. We then select three particularly promising alternative technologies for CCS in Section 5: chemical looping combustion, membranes and ionic liquids.\n\nIt is well known that the thermophysical and kinetic properties of the sorbents used for CO2 capture dictate both the capital and operating cost of the processes in which they are used. For this reason, there is a concerted effort to rationally design new sorbent materials, with the bulk of the effort in the development of liquid sorbents, where available theories are more readily applied. Thus, we present an assessment of SAFT-based approaches to model and design new materials in Section 6, with a focus on how efforts at the molecular and process scales might be linked.\n\nBefore CO2 can be safely and reliably sequestered, it must be transported from source to sink. Whilst the majority of studies assume pipeline transport, ship and rail transport are potential alternatives; these other transport options are discussed in Section 7. Similarly, despite the fact that CO2 transport by pipeline is exceptionally mature, the impact of capturing CO2 from a diverse set of power and industrial sources on the quality of CO2 being transported is sufficiently important to warrant careful consideration.\n\nThe typical fate of CO2 is to be sequestered, either in a saline aquifer or, potentially, used for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). The various challenges of operation, monitoring and verification of CO2 storage are discussed in Section 8, whereas Section 9 discusses CO2-EOR. A potential alternative to the storage of CO2 is its re-use – the valorisation of CO2 to produce marketable compounds. The argument is sometimes made that this can both contribute to climate change mitigation and provide an attractive revenue stream. Section 10 discusses the potential for CO2 conversion and utilisation (CCU), also its merits and challenges are presented and considered.\n\nIn light of the global commitment achieved in Paris in December, 2015,3 we have extended this paper to include key negative emissions technologies (Section 12); bioenergy with CCS (BECCS) and direct air capture of CO2 (DAC). These areas are of particular importance owing to their potential importance and their controversy.\n\nDespite the fact that there are currently 37 CCS projects at various stages in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Asia-Pacific,4 CCS continues to languish as an “orphan technology”.† With decades of technical experience across the entire value chain, it is clear that it is not a lack of technical expertise that is inhibiting the commercial deployment of CCS technology. Thus, we have devoted a section of this paper to consider “what needs to happen” from a commercial perspective (Section 13), drawing upon experience developed as part of the UK's most recent CCS commercialisation programme.5 Having provided this perspective from the private sector, we then complement this with an international analysis of the political economy of CCS (Section 14). Section 15 then concludes with a proposed approach to evaluate the utility of a “novel technology” and feasibility of particular targets by identifying limitations that might prove to be showstoppers.\n\n2 Current status of CCS development\n\nCarbon capture and storage is expected to play an important role in meeting the global warming targets set by the IPCC6 and at COP21.3 There is a suite of technologies being developed for the capture, transport, storage and utilisation of CO2. Typically, technology development will progress in a series of scale-up steps: (i) bench or laboratory scale, (ii) pilot-scale, (iii) demonstration scale, and lastly (iv) commercial scale.7Fig. 1 summarises the current development progress of different CCS technologies on the TRL scale.‡ As illustrated by Fig. 1, there is congestion of technologies at the TRL 3, TRL 6 and TRL 7 development phases. The progression of a technology beyond TRL 3 requires further research funding, whereas advancing technologies beyond TRL 5 and TRL 7 needs significant financial investment and/or commercial interest (e.g., in the case of polymeric membranes). Further detailed discussion on the technical development of the individual CCS technologies is presented in the following sections of this paper. Here in this section, we highlight the key CCS technologies that have reached (or close to reaching) the commercial phase of development.\n\nCO2 capture\n\nChemical absorption (e.g., using aqueous amine solutions) has been used to remove CO2 from natural gas for decades,11 thus, it is considered to have a TRL of 9. This technology has been utilised in two commercial-scale post-combustion capture facilities in coal-fired power plants, Boundary Dam12,13 and Petra Nova.14,15 Recent developments in polymeric membranes have enabled the technology to successfully achieve demonstration scale (TRL 7). The Polaris membrane is now available commercially and has been used for CO2 separation from syngas.16 Air Products are licensing a polymeric membrane developed at NTNU, which can be applied to coal-fired power plants and other combustion processes (still under development).17 Thus, The first “commercial-ready” direct air capture (DAC) plant recently opened in Hinwil, Switzerland on May 2017,18 with the support of cost contributions from the Swiss Federal Office of Energy. The plant supplies 900 tonnes of CO2 annually to a nearby greenhouse.19 Capture technologies that have also reached TRL 7 (demonstration) (e.g., oxy-combustion coal power plants, adsorption) could also potentially reached commercial status in the near future. In contrast to post-combustion capture, integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) with CCS has been less successful with the Kemper County IGCC Project being suspended recently.20 Southern Company's decision to halt the project came after encountering a series of problems, these include failure to meet the delivery deadline, severe technical issues and being majorly over budget.21,22\n\nCO2 transport\n\nThe technologies for CO2 transport are well established. There are >6500 km of CO2 pipelines worldwide (both on-shore and off-shore), most of which are associated with EOR operation in the United States.23 The technology for CO2 transport with ships is also relatively mature.24 As these transport technologies are currently being used in commercial applications, all have a TRL of 9.\n\nCO2 storage\n\nAs many commercial-scale CCS projects already use CO2-enhanced oil recovery (EOR), 13 of the 17 operating commercial-scale CCS projects, there is a significant amount of existing experience and knowledge, which has enabled CO2-EOR to reach TRL 9. Similarly, saline formations have been used for CO2 storage at commercial-scale project, including Sleipner CO2 Storage, Snøhvit CO2 Storage and Quest (on-shore and off-shore). In contrast, CO2 storage by enhanced gas recovery (EGR)25 and storage in depleted oil and gas fields have not reached operation at commercial-scale, thus, both are still at the demonstration phase (TRL 7). Ocean storage and mineral storage are still in the early phases of development.\n\nCO2 utilisation\n\nThere are a number of facilities that utilise CO2 for various applications. These commercial CO2 utilisation processes are TRL 9 as they are mature technologies. Most are in the food and beverage industry and some in chemical production (e.g., urea, methanol).26 Several projects utilise CO2 for mineral carbonation, for example, Searles Valley plant (US). In Saga City, Japan, CO2 capture from waste incineration is utilised for the cultivation of crops and algae.27 The CO2 for each project is mainly sourced from industrial processes (e.g., fertiliser production, ammonia production, ethylene glycol plants), but some projects capture the CO2 from power plant flue gas.26\n\nCommercial-scale CCS projects\n\nDeployment of large scale CCS projects has been slow. Of the 37 major large scale CCS projects, 17 of these are in operation, 4 in construction and the remainder are in varying stages of development.4 As shown in Fig. 2 and 3, the majority of the commercial large-scale CCS projects are located in the United States. In terms of the project life cycle (i.e., identify, evaluate, define, execute and operate), the US also has the greatest proportion of projects in operation. For all but one of these projects, enhanced oil recovery is the primary storage for the captured CO2. Furthermore, the projects in the US have the largest CO2 capture capacity compared with projects in the rest of the world: Century Plant captures 8.4 MtCO2 per year, whereas Shute Creek Gas Processing Facility capture 7 MtCO2 per year.4\n\nAlthough China has the second highest number of projects, only one of these is in the execute phase (Yanchang Integrated CCS Demonstration), and most are in early stages of development (e.g., pre-feasibility, FEED studies). The CO2 capture capacity of the projects in China range between 0.4–2 MtCO2 per year. Europe has the third highest number of large-scale projects, with two operational projects in Norway: the Sleipner CO2 Storage Project captures 1 MtCO2 per year, and Snøhvit CO2 Storage Project 0.7 MtCO2 per year. Of the five projects in Canada, three are in operation: (i) Great Plains Synfuel Plant and Weyburn-Midale Project (3 MtCO2 per year), (ii) Boundary Dam CCS Project (1 MtCO2 per year), and (iii) Quest (∼1 MtCO2 per year). There are also operating CCS projects in Brazil, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates with CO2 capture capacities ranging from 0.8–1 MtCO2 per year. A fundamental requirement for the success of CCS projects in all of these projects is the availability of safe geological storage for the capture CO2. Furthermore, other factors that can help bring CCS projects into operation phase include secure financial funding, as well as supportive policy and legislative frameworks.28\n\n3 Role and value of CCS\n\n3.1 Climate change mitigation\n\nIntegrated Assessment Models (IAMs) have been at the heart of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) assessment of pathways towards keeping average global warming to less than 2 °C within this century.6 They provide a means to explore the future role of particular technologies in meeting climate targets such as renewables or nuclear.\n\nCCS is one of the very attractive options in the IAMs mitigation portfolios, as it has a number of advantages. First, CCS can be integrated into existing energy systems without requiring large amendments to the system itself. Clearly, renewable technologies become more expensive at high penetration rates as a result of the need for the infrastructure to accommodate intermittency.29 Furthermore, CCS is a viable option for the decarbonisation of emission-intensive industries such as cement production (specific industrial CO2 capture costs are given in Section 3.3).30 And finally, CCS can be combined with low-carbon or carbon-neutral bioenergy (BECCS) to generate negative emissions,31i.e. while the cultivation of the feedstock biomass sequesters about as much CO2 as is generated during the process of producing energy (bio-electricity or biofuels), additionally capturing the latter leads to a withdrawal of CO2 from the atmosphere.32 BECCS has the double benefit of mitigating emissions and generating energy, making it attractive from the cost-optimisation perspective of an IAM.\n\n3.1.2 Current status of CCS deployment. Even though CCS thus plays a central role in IAM decarbonisation scenarios, deployment has barely reached the levels indicated by the projections of IAMs and roadmaps by the International Energy Agency.37–39 Looking into the future, only a few of the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), which countries pledged at the climate negotiations in Paris, feature CCS as a priority area.40\n\nMore specifically, a recent report on CCS by the IEA41 reviews the progress of the past 20 years and concludes that the current rate of progress is falling short of what is required to achieve climate goals. This is further underlined in the analysis of the INDCs by Spencer et al.:40 national and global scenarios based on the Paris pledges both show little deployment of CCS, with a share of CCS in electricity generation of only 3% in 2030 for the USA, China, Japan and the European Union. This is further exacerbated by the opposition against CCS, which is motivated by perceived uncertainties concerning its safety and the fear that it will serve to prolong the dependence on fossil fuels and be a barrier to greater utilisation of renewable power.42,43\n\nThe next section will present the current state-of-the-art knowledge on the role of CCS – and by extension BECCS – in IAMs. The review will first focus on an model intercomparison exercise of 18 IAMs33 (EMF27¶) and then widen towards the low stabilisation pathways in the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report6 (AR5). Secondly, an investigation of the scenarios consistent with the more ambitious 1.5 °C climate goals adopted at COP21 in Paris (UNFCCC 2015), serves to underline the main insights on CCS and puts specifically BECCS into the spotlight.\n\n3.1.4 Outlook: the future of CCS in IAMs. As the IAM community is moving towards producing input for the Special Report on 1.5 °C – upon invitation from the UNFCCC – in order to inform climate negotiations at COP23 in 2018 (and eventually the sixth assessment cycle), there are two developments, which could alter the role of CCS in their models.\n\nThe first is related to the above-mentioned concerns with respect to the high share of BECCS in low-stabilisation portfolios. More research along the lines of Smith et al.61 and Fajardy and Mac Dowell63 will help to shed light on the implications for other policy goals such as ensuring food security, as well as biodiversity and other ecosystem services. In addition, as can be seen in the adopted outline for the Special Report,65 climate change mitigation is closely embedded into a broader context of sustainable development, indicating that the new scenarios will also be designed to reflect a wider set of policy objectives.\n\nThe second development is the growing body of knowledge on other options for negative emissions and their interplay with what is currently included in the IAMs. There are already some IAMs that are experimenting with the integration of enhanced weathering66 and direct air capture (DAC) is also an important candidate for integration into the IAMs despite current uncertainty on technical performance and cost.67\n\nThe main CCS research priorities in IAMs include:\n\n• More within-model studies to understand better the interactions between CCS characteristics and modelled deployment/cumulative storage, which are difficult to discern in model intercomparisons.33\n\n• Update parameterisation with new insights from CCS research and demonstration.\n\n• Within-model studies also to better understand system dynamics.\n\n• Complement with geographically explicit techno-economic engineering approaches and geological suitability analysis to identify key areas for deployment and more realistic potentials.32,68\n\n• Explore scenarios considering technology choice depending on institutional barriers and social acceptance.\n\n• Include other negative emissions options (e.g. direct air capture, soil carbon sequestration, enhanced weathering) in addition to BECCS to decrease competition for storage capacity, and biomass (also other side effects, such as competition for land and water63).\n\nClearly, as ambitions become higher and action is further delayed, CCS will continue to play an important role in mitigation pathways. Broadening the portfolio of energy options to include CCS would improve the affordability of a near-zero emissions energy system.69 This is especially true in the case of combining it with bioenergy to generate negative emissions. Yet, especially with respect to negative emissions, many research gaps remain, which will need to be urgently addressed to keep this window of opportunity open.70\n\n3.2 Integration of CCS into the electricity system\n\nThe following modelling assessment has been conducted in the context of the UK electricity system (i.e., uses data for the UK). There are a number of similar studies on the UK energy system which evaluate different scenarios.50,51,71–74 Also, energy systems in the context of other countries have been evaluated, for example, the US,75,76 Greece,77 Poland,78 or for Europe in general.79\n\n3.2.1 Background. The UK is aiming to decarbonise the electricity system.80,81 To meet decarbonisation targets, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) recommends that grid intensity in 2030 should be no more than 50 g kWh−182 to 100 g kWh−1.83–85 This will allow the partial decarbonisation of the heating and transport sectors via electrification. The UK has also adopted the 20–20–20 targets proposed by the European Commission.86 This requires approximately 30% of electricity to come from renewable sources by 2020 to achieve the UK's overall target of 15% of primary energy from renewable sources, e.g., solar, wind and biomass, however, excludes nuclear and CCS.86,87 This has led to a suite of policies that have subsidised the production of electricity from renewable sources. A significant proportion of this has come from intermittent sources such as wind and photovoltaic (PV). In financial year 2014/15, more than 50 TWh (representing 15% of the 340 TWh generated) was from intermittent renewable energy sources (IRES).88\n\nIt has been proposed that the UK could generate a very high proportion (if not all) its energy from IRES.89–91 However, there are a number of issues that are likely to arise that could be expensive to solve or could ultimately limit the penetration of IRES. The three main factors that may constrain IRES deployment:\n\n(1) IRES technologies do not displace firm capacity on a one for one basis, nor do they typically provide ancillary services such as inertia, frequency response, or reserve capacity;50\n\n(2) Their intermittent output and the relatively unpredictable element of their output demand more of these ancilliary services from the grid than conventional plants;50,51\n\n(3) The highly correlated nature of the wind and sun across the UK means that at high penetration level, IRES output is weighted towards periods of surplus and away from times of system shortages. Consequently, the surplus causes wind output to be curtailed and become increasingly lower in value (market cannibalisation†††).92\n\nMany studies have considered some of the costs that arise from integrating IRES.93 However, in addition to cost, it is vital to include the above issues and consider the need to balance energy, whilst also considering the margin of firm capacity over peak demand and the provision of response, reserve and inertial services. Using the BERIC model,94 we provide some new analysis of these issues here.\n\n3.2.5 What next for system integration?. The decarbonisation of the energy sector will inevitably increase the average cost of electricity generation. The selection of different technologies has a significant impact on the overall CO2 intensity, value of technology addition and total system cost. It is increasingly recognised that decarbonisation targets (for both 50 and 100 g kWh−1 grid intensity) cannot be achieved solely via the deployment of intermittent renewable energy (e.g., PV, wind). To balance the use of IRES in the system, firm capacity technologies are necessary for reliable low/neutral carbon electricity. The modelling of the UK system has shown that only fossil CCS, nuclear or bioenergy could take on this essential role. Some other systems will have additional options such geothermal, reservoir hydro power or even solar + energy storage in a predictably sunny climate. It is these low carbon technologies that will compete with CCS to provide firm capacity and not IRES technologies, which operate in a different market.\n\nThe value added to the system by a certain technology is dependent on the existing energy mix and the services that the technology can provide (e.g., inertia, reserve, firm capacity). Thus, a single number such as the LCOE cannot be used to characterise the performance of a technology. Similarly, value assessment of a single technology in isolation is inadequate. A whole systems approach to valuing technologies and their impact on total system cost would recognise the role of low-carbon technologies in balancing demand and cost. Such an approach would enable better characterisation (e.g. availability, controllability, economic benefit) of different generation technologies within a given energy mix.\n\n3.3 Industrial CCS\n\nA significant proportion of GHG emissions can be attributed to industrial processes,6 contributing 25% of the global CO2 emissions.119 Thus, decarbonisation of the industrial sector will be essential to meet the CO2 emissions targets by IPCC.6 Some key industrial sectors that have been the focus of CCS studies include cement, petroleum refining, iron and steel manufacturing, and pulp and paper,120,121 with iron and steel, cement and refining being especially “high-emitting”,119 together consuming 38% (43 EJ) of total industrial energy consumption.122 CCS is regarded as a cost effective option to reduce CO2 emissions from industrial processes.119,123 The physical properties, composition and gas volume flows are different for each industrial process.124 Thus, the suitability and selection of a CCS technology would depend on these stream properties, e.g., CO2 concentration, moisture content.125–127 The challenge for the industrial sector will be maintaining international competitiveness with the implementation of technologies that reduce CO2 emissions, but increase costs.128\n\n3.3.2 Decarbonisation of the cement industry. After clean water, mankind produces a greater volume of concrete than any other product,144 and considering that each tonne of cement used within it causes the emission of around 880 kg of CO2145 (depending upon the method of production, between 600 and 1000 kg146), it is unsurprising that more than 5% of global CO2 emissions are caused by its manufacture.147 Approximately 60% of CO2 emissions from cement production arise from the calcination of limestone (CaCO3) to form CaO (the main precursor for cement production),146 with the remaining emissions from the process being from the fuel used to heat the kiln and effect the clinkering reactions. Both sources of CO2 can be treated at the same combined stack. The intrinsic emissions of CO2, which are part of the production process, mean that in order to make the scale of emissions cuts necessary to limit anthropogenic warming to 2 °C, CCS is a prerequisite.148\n\nThere are a number of different CCS technologies that are applicable to cement production; there are several variants of post-combustion CO2 capture, including solvent scrubbing or the use of solid sorbents, calcium looping, oxy-fuel and “direct capture”.145 In this context, the most obvious difference between cement production and power generation is that pre-combustion technologies are not applicable. This is because of the large quantity of process-related emissions from calcination of limestone that are not captured when pre-combustion is applied. The technologies are in general (with the exception of direct capture) conceptually similar to their counterparts in power generation, though it is notable that calcium looping utilises one of the feed stocks for cement production (CaO) as its main sorbent; this leads to significant synergies between the cement process and Ca looping. Direct capture has no obvious analogue; it utilises indirect radiative heating of the limestone-containing raw meal feed to the system to “directly” produce a pure stream of CO2. Both direct capture and oxy-fuelled systems have the potential for efficiency gains within the system, owing to either thermodynamic benefits (direct capture) or a reduction in the total amount of thermal “ballast” in the system by eliminating the nitrogen from air.\n\nThe key issue for cement CCS is to ensure that the quality of the product remains the same after the CCS system has been applied. This is the main advantage for a scrubbing system based on post-combustion capture using alkanolamines (or other sorbent-based system). Unfortunately, cement plants are not in general endowed with sufficient low-grade heat to (without the addition of a CHP plant) allow capture of more than around 50% of the CO2 produced in a cement plant.145,149\n\nOne of the first references to a zero emission oxy-fuelled kiln was made in 2006.150 The European cement research association has identified oxy-firing of a kiln to be the most potentially beneficial process for the cement industry, and a long-term project has been working towards commercialisation of the process, starting in 2007 with basic literature review, followed by techno-economic feasibility studies. Initially, it was thought that the change in the kiln environment (from air/CO2 to O2/CO2) might change the volatilities of minor species within the process. Basic laboratory tests were conducted by the European Cement Research Academy (ECRA),151 no significant variations were found in cements produced under oxy-fuelled conditions as opposed to standard cements. Such findings were confirmed recently as part of a G8 project investigating the application of oxy-firing on cement.152\n\nSimilar to the conclusions above, minimal changes to cement quality have been observed when simulating at a laboratory scale the application of calcium looping to cement production.147,153,154 No changes to cement quality would be expected using solvent-based post-combustion capture. Potential changes to cement chemistry from direct capture have not been tested yet; it is a stated aim of the current EU LEILAC project to conduct such tests.155\n\nThe cost of CO2 capture on cement plants has been studied by a number of researchers, though (as with all other industrial processes) nowhere near as comprehensively as costs for the application of CCS on power generation.****120,121 There is a broad consensus in the literature that amine scrubbing is likely to be more expensive than the two other most studied technologies, oxy-firing the kiln and calcium looping. Some recent work by Leeson et al.120,121 found that, when adjusted to a consistent year and currency basis, costs for calcium looping were between $20 and $75 per tonne of CO2 avoided (central estimate ∼$40), oxy-fuel was around $60 (only one estimate was found in the academic literature) and amine scrubbing was significantly higher, between $65 and $165 with a central estimate of ∼$106. The single study referenced in Leeson et al.120 was conducted by Mott-MacDonald (with input from Whitehopleman and the British Cement Association) and was a comparison between post-combustion and oxy-fuel capture.157 Importantly, this study only considered “partial” oxy-firing, of only the pre-calciner, the sealing of the large rotating kiln, heat transfer changes within the kiln, etc., being considered to be sufficiently challenging that deployment in the “near future with moderate risk” was unlikely. However, it was stated that no “showstoppers” were found in the potential future deployment of a fully oxy-fired system, though this was an area for basic R&D. Post-combustion capture using amine scrubbing was shown to be nearly three times more expensive. This is because of two main issues – the requirement to protect the amines used from NOX and SO2, the clean-up of which necessitates a selective catalytic reduction and wet scrubbing system, respectively; and the heavily increased fuel-burn, owing to the paucity of low-grade heat in the system. One point of note is that because the kiln would not be converted to oxy-firing in the above study, the amine scrubbing system captured significantly more CO2 (74% vs. 61%). It was also noted that integration of a cement plant with a nearby power plant would significantly reduce the costs for post-combustion capture (allowing the transfer of steam from the power station to effect the regeneration of the amines), though presumably similar benefits would accrue if an oxy-fuelled plant were located next to an oxy-fuelled power station with an oversized ASU. A recent paper158 examining the application of calcium looping to cement manufacture found that calcium looping had a high avoided CO2 (94%) in comparison to an partially oxy-fuelled plant modelled (76%); the same group has modelled the integration of a calcium looping system with a power plant and export of the spent CaO to a cement works;159 this yields some of the lowest potential costs seen for CO2 avoidance in cement manufacture, though the fuel-based emissions in the cement plant are not fully addressed. The minimum cost of CO2 avoided in the combined system was approximately 27 £ per tonne. Of course, such integration would require the co-location of the two plants, which may be geographically challenging.\n\nIt was noted in Barker et al.157 that building a plant in a far-eastern location would be significantly cheaper (more than 50% cheaper) than building it in a European location. Another study160 investigating the application of post-combustion solvent scrubbing to cement production in a similar location (China), but for a retrofit, found a cost of $70 per tonne of CO2 avoided (in this case, a CHP plant was used to make up for the lack of low-grade heat to regenerate the amines). This paper was one of the first to make the case for “carbon capture readiness” for the cement industry. This subject was also explored by Hills et al.,145 who also considered the technology readiness levels (TRLs) for different CCS technologies applied to the cement industry. The TRLs for amine scrubbing, calcium looping and partial oxy-fuel were assessed to be at or near to 6, with full oxy-fuel being a little lower (4) and direct capture somewhere in between. This work also made it clear that because cement-plant renovation and capture plant construction are likely to take similar lengths of time, it would likely save time and money to synchronise these. Discussions with cement manufacturers161 similarly have underlined the long lifespans of cement plants and the razor-sharp margins in this industry; it has also long been known that some form of tariff is required to maintain a level playing field between regions with regulated CO2 emissions and those not subject to such controls.123,162\n\nThere is a renewed drive to apply CCS to industrial processes. Norcem (in collaboration with its parent company, Heidelberg Cement and the ECRA) has led the way163 in terms of testing amines on real flue gases (Aker Solutions) and are also testing solid sorbents (RTI International), and a membrane (DNV and others). As a part of the same test programme, Ca-looping (Alstom) will be tested at IFK, Stuttgart. A 1.9 MWth Ca-looping pilot plant is integrated with a cement works at ITRI (Industrial Technology Research Institute), Taiwan,164 and has demonstrated capture >85% in a 7 hour long test; the stated aim is to progress to a 30 MWth pilot plant. The LEILAC project, headed by Calix Europe155 is a 21 million euro, 5 year project aiming to demonstrate the direct capture process. Regarding oxy-fuel combustion, ECRA has a current stated aim165 to develop a 500–1000 tpd pilot plant to be operational by 2019, with a cost between 40 and 60 million euros. The key extra cost component was stated to be the oxygen production facility.\n\n4 Post-combustion capture technology\n\nThis section discusses capture technologies that have been demonstrated at pilot plant scale or higher (i.e., at TRL of 6 or greater).\n\n4.1 Liquid-phase chemisorption technology\n\nThe classic chemical absorbent for CO2 separation applications is 20–30 wt% aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA). It was proposed in the original patent from 1930 for an amine process to separate acid gases11 and has found widespread use in industry.180 MEA is particularly suited to low CO2 partial pressure applications and as a consequence has become the benchmark amine for CO2 capture from electricity generation. In a standard CO2 separation process applied to flue gas (10–15 kPa CO2) at 40 °C, and using 30 wt% MEA and 90% CO2 removal, typical minimum stripper reboiler duties are ∼3.6–4.0 GJ per tonne CO2 captured. This value has been validated at small to medium pilot scale in a number of studies.181–184 The reboiler energy requirement is not the only metric that defines the performance of an absorbent, but reducing this value is the primary goal of much chemical absorbent research, and new absorbents are typically benchmarked against the value for 30 wt% MEA. Rates of mass transfer, stability in the presence of oxygen and elevated temperature, volatility, solids formation, toxicity and biodegradability and price are also important in real world flue gas applications. New absorbents are also benchmarked against MEA in terms of these characteristics. MEA has good rates of CO2 mass transfer, is low cost and readily biodegradable but suffers from moderate rates of oxidative and thermal degradation and moderate levels of toxicity.180 It is also corrosive when used at higher concentrations.\n\nResearch and development of new absorbents for flue gas applications has been ongoing for a number of decades. These new absorbents perform better than MEA in some or all of these characteristics. This suggests it may be time to move on from MEA and choose one of the new generation of absorbents for benchmarking purposes. As an example the formulation of aqueous piperazine (PZ) and 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) has been extensively studied. This blend has achieved ∼3 GJ per tonne CO2 captured at pilot scale and also has favourable mass transfer and stability properties.185,186 Commercial solvent technologies are also potential benchmark solvents, e.g. Econamine FG+, KS-1, and Cansolv. These advanced solvents contain proprietary blends of amines187 and have been selected for use in commercial-scale projects.14,15,188\n\nIn the following sections state of the art amine-based and multi-phase chemical absorbents will be discussed. These will be limited to absorbents that have been characterised in detail and progressed from the lab scale at least to small pilot scale testing. The reason being that this is the critical step where absorbents that have performed well in the lab can suffer from unforeseen issues that limit their utility. When numbers for reboiler duty are quoted for amines these will be based on a standard absorber/stripper process configuration without absorbent specific or other process improvements (complete list provided in Table 4). By their very nature multi-phase absorbents require process modifications which makes the comparison less clear-cut.\n\n4.1.4 Outlook for chemisorption solvents. Many new absorbents are under development at the bench scale, however very few have progressed to small scale pilot plant studies outside of the cloistered halls of technology vendors. This testing in a complete process is a critical step for the development of absorbents. Issues that may not be apparent in a laboratory environment come to the fore. For example the hydrodynamics, volatility and degradation behaviour when exposed to high shear gas flows, pumping through pipework and continuous heating and cooling for extended periods is difficult to replicate in any one laboratory experiment. So it is critical that new absorbents that show promise using the traditional metrics of capture performance are moved on to testing at pilot scale. Only this will allow the development of a more complete understanding of the critical factors that ultimately lead to success and failure.\n\nIn terms of developing the perfect amine for CO2 capture, this is a challenging task. The most common approach to-date has been to assess the performance of existing amine molecules. As a consequence of the knowledge gained doing this, there is now considerable understanding of the relationship between chemical structure and absorption performance and stability. The next generation of amines will be less a product of discovery and more a product of targeted task specific molecular design and synthesis, with multiple amino groups having complementary properties contained in single molecules. A few studies have started down this path260–263 with initial results looking promising. There is growing interest in water-lean solvents (e.g., ionic liquids, non-aqueous organic amine blends), which exhibit lower reboiler duty and higher mass transfer properties compared to aqueous formulations. However, water-lean solvent tend to be more expensive and testing has been limited to lab-scale (∼3 L).187 As expertise in the relevant synthetic chemistry increases, and these task specific molecules become available in larger quantities and at lower cost, they are likely to outperform and outlast the current suit of amines.\n\n4.2 Adsorption processes for CCS\n\nAdsorption processes were first considered in the early 1990's as an alternative to solvent processes for carbon capture.264–266 Since those initial studies, there has been a growing and sustained effort to develop adsorption technology for CO2 capture. By far, the greatest research efforts have been directed at developing improved adsorbents with higher working capacity for CO2, better selectivity, and better tolerance to impurities. New CO2 capture adsorbents are reported almost daily. The classical adsorbents (carbons, aluminas, silicas, zeolites) and modifications thereof have all been evaluated for their potential in CO2 capture applications and new adsorbents (metal organic frameworks, hydrotalcites, amine supported adsorbents, polymers, high temperature metal oxides) have all been explored for their application in a range of areas.267–270\n\nLeaving aside developments in adsorbents, important as they may be, there have also been important developments and progress in adsorption processes for CO2 capture over the last three decades. A large variety of cyclic processes have been developed, in which regeneration is accomplished by temperature, pressure, vacuum, steam or moisture, or combinations thereof. These processes have been comprehensively reviewed.269,271 Novel adsorbent structures and gas-adsorbent device geometries have been proposed and evaluated, such as hollow fibres, monoliths, radial beds, fluidised and moving beds. Hybrid adsorbent technologies have been investigated in which adsorption is coupled with other separation or reaction technologies either as a distinct unit operation or an integrated unit. The application areas for adsorption process have expanded from post and pre-combustion flue gas to process streams (e.g., food and beverage, cement, steel, petrochemical, pulp and paper, and natural gas industries) and direct capture of CO2 from air.\n\n4.2.1 Advantages of adsorption for CCS. Adsorption is an attractive technology for a number of reasons. It can be retrofitted to any power plant should the adsorption column be optimised to ensure acceptable footprint and cost. In addition, it can cover a wide range of temperature and pressure conditions so that low, medium and high temperatures adsorbents can be used and adsorbents for both pre- and post-combustion settings can be designed – here we focus on low temperature adsorbents for post-combustion (i.e., <200 °C). It is worth noting that adsorption is particularly well-suited for air capture as it involves very low CO2 concentrations. However, this is beyond the scope of this section. Air capture is discussed in Section 12.2 and further information on air capture using adsorption is available in other papers.272–274 While there is no direct and fully comprehensive way to assess the economics and energetics of adsorption compared to those of absorption, many indicators points to the cost reduction enabled by adsorption.275 Another strength of adsorption is the potentially minimal environmental footprint vis-à-vis amine-based solvents, which tend to decompose and form toxic and/or corrosive compounds. The use of waste materials as adsorbents could potentially enhance the sustainability of the process, though life cycle assessment would be needed to confirm that aspect.276\n\nConsidering the aforementioned strengths, pilot-scale CO2 adsorption projects have been proposed and implemented, enabling the community to acquire the knowledge, skills and expertise needed to improve the technological maturity of CO2 adsorption. Among them, there is the CO2CRC H3 capture project based at the International Power plant in Australia which operated from 2009 to 2011.277 Besides adsorption, the project also investigated the potential of absorption and membrane processes for CO2 capture from a coal-fired power plant. Publicly available information on the adsorbents used suggests they were provided by Monash University. The “CO2 Ultimate Reduction in Steelmaking Process by Innovative Technology for Cool Earth 50” (or COURSE 50) project was launched in Japan in 2008 at an industrial CCS to capture CO2 from the blast furnace stream at JFE Steel's West Japan Works.278,279 The capture system employs PSA and captures 3 ton per day of CO2 while also evaluating a number of zeolites and activated carbons as adsorbents.\n\n4.2.5 Outlook for adsorption technologies. Since the first work on capturing CO2 with adsorbents was conducted in the 1990's, there has been a rapid development in adsorption processes. Adsorption has evolved from technology readiness level (TRL) of 2 (bench scale work) in the 1990s to TRL 5 (pilot scale) today. Some processes have even reached demonstration scale (TRL 7), for example, the dry regenerable sorbents being trialled by KEPCO Research Institute.321 For small scale CO2 capture applications, pressure or vacuum swing cycles have already been employed in the industry sector to remove CO2. As adsorbents continue to develop, it is likely that we will see further entry of adsorption processes into areas not suited for solvent processes. For example, the food and beverage industry cannot tolerate chemical based solvents on site and the very low environmental footprint of adsorption processes is a strong advantage.\n\nOne key area that needs addressing is that of materials testing and screening. As the research community understands better the performance of adsorbents under equilibrium conditions using a ‘simple’ CO2/N2 mixture, there is now a need to ‘challenge’ the materials by running dynamic tests and use simulated flue gas streams. The former aspect will enable to derive the kinetic properties of the various adsorbents and hence provide a more realistic picture of their performance. It is recognised that some kinetic studies have already been reported but they are not yet performed systematically.353 A number of impurities contained in the flue gas could potentially impair the performance of adsorbents and therefore testing involving multicomponent streams are particularly informative. We highlight here recent work on the development of a high-throughput analyser enabling multicomponent equilibrium experiments.373 Using this set-up, it was found that of the adsorbents studied, those containing alkylamines performed well for CO2 capture in the presence of N2 and H2O. Further work around adsorber design is also crucial to allow faster cycles since it will directly influence the overall process. While the commonly proposed bed contactors include fixed bed, fluidised bed and moving bed,287 we note here the recent development of a rotary wheel adsorber to allow fast TSA cycles.374 Such rotary systems are incorporated in the Inventys© CO2 capture technology.\n\nIndustrial scale formulation of some of the novel advanced adsorbents (discussed in Section 4.2.4) will become increasingly important. To be integrated in a process, the materials must be manufactured as structured adsorbents, e.g. pellets, beads, monoliths, fibres. This is particularly true in the case of MOFs, which are still largely synthesised in a powder form. There are indications this is changing, as demonstrated by, for example, BASF and small companies such as the MOF company, NuMat, and Mosaic Materials. In the near future, we can expect the emergence of a number of spin-outs and start-ups producing MOF in different formats, e.g., Immaterial. Research studies have also started investigating the incorporation of MOFs into structured supports such as fibres and monoliths.375–381\n\nAs we have amassed more knowledge concerning CO2 adsorption, CO2 adsorbents and their performance metrics from different experimental and computational viewpoints, there is now a need to consolidate that knowledge and propose a combined multi-scale approach to the development of CO2 adsorbents and adsorption technologies. The examples of recent studies highlighted above are beginning to move towards that direction.\n\nFor mid-size CO2 capture applications, recent advances in adsorption technology are providing low cost and low energy options, thus potentially offering an attractive alternative to liquid scrubbing systems. Some promising developments include adsorbent structures, hybrid amine sorbents, low quality steam regeneration and rapid cycling. However, for large scale processes, it is unlikely that adsorbent technology will be competitive against established liquid scrubbing systems due to the complexity of large scale solids handling. Hybrid sorption enhanced reactive systems such as SEWGS have a strong role to play, particularly as hydrogen is promoted as an energy carrier in some economies. In a relatively short time, adsorption processes have developed rapidly and the future looks bright for further development and deployment in a range of CO2 capture applications.\n\n4.3 Calcium looping technology\n\nCalcium looping (CaL) technology is a relatively new alternative for post-combustion CO2 capture, and is based on the following reversible reaction:\n\nCaCO3 ↔ CaO + CO2 ΔH = −178 kJ mol−1(3)\n\nAlthough the use of lime as a means for removing CO2 from hot gases is over 100 years old, the idea of using it in a reversible scheme to strip CO2 from flue gases is relatively new382 and can be represented schematically by Fig. 10. Implicit in such a cycle is the requirement that the lime product be used in multiple cycles in order to minimise the costs, and increase the overall efficiency of the process and this demands the use of a carbonator and a regenerator, normally envisaged as being a small oxy-fuel power plant to regenerate the spent sorbent and produce a pure stream of CO2 for storage, or possibly use (see Fig. 11).\n\nThree key factors distinguish CaL from the other CCS technologies. First, because the carbonator/calciner can serve as a heat source for a steam cycle to produce additional power, the energy penalty associated with the technology can be several percentage points lower than that of conventional amine scrubbing.‡‡‡‡383,384 Second, the sorbent used, namely limestone, is available in industrial quantities, and is also a non-hazardous chemical whose price is of the order of £10–20 per tonne (∼US$13–26 per tonne). In contrast, the cost of amine solvent MEA is much greater at US$1.8–2.9 kg−1.385,386 The third benefit of CaL is that there is a possibility of using the spent sorbent in industrial processes such as cement making, which, since lime manufacture represents 50% or more of the CO2 output in cement production, offers an approach to partially decarbonise the cement industry153 or even to achieve near-zero emissions by incorporating the technology into the cement manufacturing process.145,387–389 Finally, there exists substantial capacity worldwide to take most of the spent sorbent from CaL should it become a dominant technology.390 For instance, spent CaL sorbent can be used in the production of cement clinker,153,154 ocean liming, steel manufacturing (to make slag or capture CO2), or for flue gas desulphurisation.390\n\nCaL technology has also been progressed to pilot scale. There are two major demonstration projects, one at the University of Darmstadt, in Germany391,392 and one in La Pereda, Spain,393 which have been used to extensively test circulating fluidised bed-based technology, and a 1.9 MWth pilot plant, which combines a bubbling fluidised bed carbonator and a rotary kiln calciner, in Taiwan that has been reported to have run for over 1 year.164 Based on its work, Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) estimated that the integrated CaL process would offer a carbon capture cost of less than $30 per tCO2.394 These demonstration projects mean that the technology has achieved a technical readiness level of 6.395 Moreover, there is now an extensive number of small pilot plant facilities worldwide396 being used to address various aspects of the technology, from looking at aspects of CaL, such as sorbent attrition, and the behaviour of modified and synthetic sorbents to improve their overall performance, to the development of novel configurations for CaL applications.\n\n4.3.1 Current developments. The realisation that the lime in the CaL processes suffered rapid deactivation has led to over a decade of work on improving sorbent performance, and reducing deactivation.397 The other major issue for CaL is that of attrition or sorbent loss due to mechanical impacts experienced in real fluidised beds, as opposed to the more benign testing environment which is normally provided in a thermogravimetric analyser (TGA), which is still the most common tool used to investigate sorbent performance.\n\nIt was gradually recognised that the typical TGA environment used to assess sorbent performance was associated with major flaws.397 In particular, the chemical environment was unrealistic as it missed both the positive effects of water addition on capture398–400 and the negative effects of SO2. More importantly, calcination in N2 or environments with low levels of CO2 at temperatures of 850 °C or below is unrealistic and tends to overestimate sorbent performance. In real systems, it appears that the water content typical of a combustion environment (10–20%) partially compensated for the presence of SO2,401 but higher temperatures necessary to drive calcination in the presence of nearly 100% CO2 always led to a significant deterioration in sorbent performance regardless of the modification process involved.402,403 It is also interesting to note that He et al.404 have reported a beneficial effect of steam on the ability of carbide slag to capture CO2. Finally, it is worth noting that steam has been shown to produce clear beneficial effects on the carbonation process; it also appears that it can produce significant benefits in improving sorbent performance when it is added to the calciner of a 100 kWth pilot plant.405 These benefits do not appear to be related to a lowering of the calcination temperature due to the reduction in partial pressure of CO2,406 but instead it has been suggested that they are associated with reduction in sintering produced by the lower CO2 levels in the calciner.\n\nDespite ample evidence to the contrary, numerous studies on sorbent performance are compromised by the use of low calcination temperatures and unrealistic chemical environments. This has been pointed out again recently by Clough et al.,407 who have suggested a novel TGA protocol to ensure more realistic results are obtained on modified sorbent performance.\n\nSorbent attrition is another area which has received attention over an extended period. Although there are limestones that perform extremely poorly,408 the fact that there are both fully operational demonstration units and a large number of pilot plants396 is a clear indication that natural sorbents can perform adequately in CaL processes. Nonetheless, numerous attempts have been made to improve sorbent performance by various kinds of treatment, most notably pelletisation with a support material, often with mixed results (and a critical issue in such evaluations is again that tests be performed under realistic fluidised bed conditions).409 Another critical question for all such attempts is that the cost of such approaches may easily outweigh any benefit in terms of potentially superior performance and/or mechanical resistance.410 An interesting result from the work of Erans et al.411,412 is that some additives may actually weaken the resulting sorbent, and this is only apparent when tests are performed under fluidised bed conditions and that this phenomenon counteracts any reactivity benefit associated with the additive, in this case flour incorporated into the pelletised matrix, to serve as a representative form of biomass addition.\n\n4.3.3 Hybrid systems. Although this review focuses primarily on the direct use of Ca looping for post-combustion capture, it should be noted that the technology lends itself to many other applications. Thus, for instance, CaL can be used for CO2 capture in gasification processes427 or enhanced reforming processes for hydrogen production.428,429 There has also been some attempts to explore the possibility of combining the technology in various cycles with Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC), possibly with the reduction of CuO providing the heat for calcination, thus eliminating the need for an oxy-fired calciner. Initial work in this area focused on making core-in shell pellets of combined CaO/CuO and testing them in a TGA environment,430 and more recently there has been an effort to model the performance of such particles.431\n\nIn experiments with combined CaO/CuO/calcium aluminate cements, Rahman et al.432 have obtained results which suggest this is possible, albeit that they reported a decline in the oxidation potential of such pellets in a gasification environment. Duhoux et al.433 have carried out simulations for a process combining CaL and CLC for CO2 capture and report that a combined CaL–CLC process could show a 10% process efficiency gain, and significantly increased power output.\n\nAnother interesting possibility is combining CaL with thermal storage. At the simplest level, producing CaO from CaCO3 offers the possibility of thermal storage by itself.434 In principle, this can be combined with other thermal energy storage options and Hanak et al.434 suggest that this option with cryogenic O2 storage has the potential to increase the profitability of an integrated system over that of a reference coal-fired power plant without CO2 capture.\n\nThere has also been increasing interest in combining CaL technology with solar power.389,435–437 In this case the goal would be operate the calciner using solar energy, and if this is successfully achieved the calciner could serve as part of a conventional CaL cycle and/or a source of thermal energy storage.\n\n4.3.4 Novel configurations. Currently, most suggested embodiments of CaL involved dual fluidised beds, although other designs have been suggested or used for the calciner (e.g., rotary kilns, or fixed beds). In terms of improving the operation of such systems the calciner seems to be the most promising sub-system for substantial modification. Thus, Lara et al.438 have suggested that better heat integration and the development of a cyclonic preheater to increase the temperature of solids entering the calciner might be one such option. Other options might be to operate with very high oxygen levels to the calciner and depend on the calcination reaction to control temperatures, and this is the subject of a current Research Fund for Coal and Steel EU project.439\n\n4.3.5 Outlook for calcium looping technologies. CaL is a rapidly evolving technology, which has considerable potential for post-combustion CO2 capture. At the current stage of development its overall technical readiness level can be assessed as TRL 6, based on the existence of a number of pilot plant units at the several MWth stage. However, developments are progressing to allow it to be combined with CLC, or used in thermal storage applications or for the production of hydrogen. Significant developments are also being made to combine it with various industrial processes, most notably that of cement production.147,152 However, at the current time there are no larger demonstration units, and these are urgently needed before the technology can become fully commercialised.\n\n5 Next generation CO2 capture processes\n\nThis section considers next generation CO2 capture technologies. These have been studied extensively, however, compared to conventional capture technologies (liquid-phase or solid-phase sorbents), they are in the earlier stages of development. These “new generation” technologies show particular promise in high temperature applications, with potential opportunities for use in process intensification.\n\n5.1 Chemical-looping, progress and prospective\n\n5.1.2 Motivation and current research. Why the interest after 100 years given the advantages of other commercially available processes currently used for air separation in e.g., oxy-fuel combustion? The large heat of reaction typically involved in the metal oxide redox reaction would initially seem to rule out using reaction (5) for air separation. Indeed, membrane processes in which oxygen is transferred through a metal oxide structure have many similarities to chemical looping and do not require the addition or removal of heat to drive the cycle of oxidation and reduction.446 The answer lies in the temperature at which these process run. Traditional carbon capture processes are based on low temperature absorption or oxygen production via an air separation unit. Thermodynamics requires work to be expended to separate gases, either the CO2 from the flue gases or O2 from air. This work can be provided as heat with a certain capacity to do work (i.e., exergy) or directly as compression work. In low temperature processes, the work is taken directly from the power station, for example, steam bled from the turbine is used for amine scrubbing, steam whose exergy would otherwise have been used to generate electricity. Running a high temperature cyclic process overcomes this limitation in number of ways. Firstly, the heat rejected from the cyclic chemical looping process is at a temperature above the turbine inlet temperature (for a steam plant), meaning that all the heat released can be recovered back into the power cycle. Secondly, heat release from combustion would normally be transferred from a hot flame, to a relatively cold steam cycle, destroying a large amount of the heat's potential to do work. The combustion reaction itself also destroys exergy. Using this heat instead to separate gases, before it is transferred to the power cycle, uses work potential that would otherwise have been lost.\n\nA similar argument can be made for chemical looping combustion, in which the fuel is brought into direct contact with the metal oxide. Here, the exergy loss associated with the combustion reaction itself is partially avoided. Chemical looping combustion was originally proposed as a way to increase the efficiency of fossil fuel power station because it avoided the exergy loss associated with combustion.447 Materials for chemical looping combustion need to operate with an equilibrium pO2 > O (10−7); this ensures that the partial pressure of CO (or other un-combusted fuel) is low at the exit of a well-mixed reactor. Iron oxide for example has several oxidation states which can be used to transfer oxygen, the Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 transition has a pO2 of ∼3.6 × 10−7 bar at 900 °C which means that, at equilibrium, the ratio of CO to CO2 would be ∼1 × 10−5, i.e. near complete combustion.\n\n5.1.5 Outlook for chemical looping processes. The use of a redox reaction to transfer oxygen between from the air to a process stream is a well-established idea, and processes making use of these solid oxide carriers were proposed in the early 20th Century or earlier. They fell out of favour with the development of modern air separation technologies for the production of oxygen, but are now of interest because of the ability of a chemical looping cycle (operating at a high temperature) to be heat integrated into a power plant flow sheet. Cycles based on chemical looping, theoretically at least, allow power production with carbon capture with very low energy penalties. Moving from theory to practice, particularly at power generation scale, has been the subject of a large research effort in recent years. With the current demonstrations at the megawatt scale, chemical looping has already demonstrated itself to be a promising second generation carbon capture technology.\n\n5.2 Membrane-based technology for CCS\n\nMembrane processes for CO2 capture can, in a manner similar to other technologies, be classified as pre-combustion, oxy-combustion and post-combustion processes. Here, we focus our discussion on the opportunities for process intensification through the use of membranes in CO2 capture. Inorganic membranes are capable of high temperature operation. Intensification is achieved through the integration of these membrane processes with reforming, shift and oxidation reactions. Organic membranes are unsuitable for high temperature applications, and most are also unsuitable for low temperature shift (LTS) processes (around 180–250 °C).470 We confine ourselves to the consideration of dense inorganic membranes, as porous inorganic membranes do not currently have sufficient selectivity for application to the processes of interest here. For details on other membranes that may be applied to CO2 capture processes (e.g., organic membranes and porous inorganic membranes), the reader is referred to a number of reviews published previously.471–480 In the case of application to CCS processes we thus seek to exploit high temperature membranes that are selective for hydrogen, oxygen and CO2 permeation.\n\nMembrane permeability is considered an important property of membrane material and not associated with geometry. If the permeability of the membrane is known, along with its dimensions and the driving force across the membrane, then flux can be determined and process design calculations performed. However, this is assuming that transport within the membrane is the rate-determining step. This in general need not be the case; the rate may be determined by surface exchange processes or indeed mass transfer processes.\n\nIn Section 5.2.1 we describe the properties of a membrane that are important in conferring such CCS-relevant selectivity. Furthermore, we summarise the kinetic behaviour of such membranes through the use of permeabilities. Section 5.2.1 also discusses the classes of membrane that have the potential for use in process intensification of CCS. Section 5.2.2 describes how such membranes may fit into CCS processes, and the work that has been conducted to date. We conclude with the future outlook for membrane-based CCS processes.\n\n5.2.3 Membranes: future perspective & key research needs. Here we have investigated the possibilities for intensification of CO2 capture processes through the use of membranes. The advantages of such membrane processes are clear from a thermodynamic perspective, primarily when reaction and separation are combined. This enables chemical reaction equilibrium limitations to be overcome (here, we primarily discuss the water-gas shift reaction), leading to simpler plant designs with fewer units, and as such, the future prospects of such processes should be bright. Very significant progress has been made towards commercialisation of such technologies. Tokyo Gas have demonstrated a reformer and shift unit that incorporates a Pd hydrogen-permeable membrane, advancing the technology to a TRL of 5 or 6. In the case of MIEC oxygen permeable and supported molten carbonate CO2 permeable membranes, there are currently no examples of intensified membrane processes for CO2 capture in near-commercial use, and is considered in the early stages of development at TRL 3 or 4. Such application requires a number of issues to be addressed. Membranes must be demonstrated at scale and over long periods of operation under realistic conditions. To advance the development of supported molten carbonate membranes, work should be performed to confirm they maintain their selectivity in different gas environments over relevant timescales. Problems associated with membrane sealing and failure must also be addressed. Finally, the cost associated with CO2 emissions must be sufficient to make investment in such membrane processes sufficiently attractive.\n\n5.3 Ionic liquids for CO2 capture\n\nIonic liquids (ILs) are substances completely composed of ions and are arbitrarily liquid below 100 °C.534 Those ILs with melting points below room temperature are referred to as room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs).534 ILs are now widely used in various areas of chemistry (and are emerging in areas of chemical engineering) including as solvents for organic synthesis,534–538 as solvents for and/or as agents of catalysis,534,535,539–543 in separations,544–547 for the synthesis of nanomaterials,548–552 in energy applications,553–557 and for biofuel production.558–561 The reason that ILs have garnered such interest is that they possess unusual (and often extreme) physical properties which provide some advantages in handling and storage.534 The most often cited property is a vanishingly low vapour pressure,562 which is important for CO2 capture applications, but other common IL properties include high thermal and chemical stability (also of import for CCS),563,564 non-flammability,565 and high viscosity.566 Their main strength lies in their designation as “designer solvents” because it is possible to synthetically alter the cation and anion independently, allowing for customisation of many solvent properties, including polarity, acid/base character, density, viscosity and thermal stability.534 The high thermal stability and low volatility allow for use of ILs for CO2 capture in either a pressure-swing configuration567 where CO2 desorption is not accompanied by evaporative solvent losses, or temperature-swing desorption where the high thermal stability of ILs (typically over 300 °C)538 also negates degradative solvent losses. Combined, these properties provide an opportunity to regenerate the solvent at a very wide range of temperatures and pressures, providing an excellent opportunity for process optimisation that is not available using traditional aqueous liquid capture media.1 However, the viscosities of ionic liquids are high compared to conventional solvents (66 to 1110 cP at 293 to 298 K),2,568 which may cause processing issues as discussed later.\n\nILs have been proposed for use in carbon capture for many years.569 This is mainly due to a perceived high capacity for CO2 dissolution, though as Carvalho et al.570 recently observed, this is only strictly true for certain subclasses of ILs.570 Most of the CO2 solubility work in ILs has been carried out at high pressures and with pure CO2 gas streams (in order to overcome low CO2 solubility during physisorption), conditions useful for scientific study, but unlikely to merit consideration for CCS.2,283,567,570–575 There has also been a marked emphasis on physical absorption of CO2,1,2,283,567,576–578 though many chemisorbing ILs have come to prominence recently.579–585 For the physisorption studies, the major driver of IL selection has been high capacity, with this parameter influenced mainly by the anion selection (and fluorine content) and the length of the cation alkyl chain,585 though the majority of studies have focussed on dialkylimidazolium cations.2 Despite several generation of ILs for CCS, the CO2 capacity at post-combustion CO2 partial pressures remains limited,585 unless referenced on a molar (mol L−1) rather than molal (mol kg−1) basis,570 suggesting a practical limitation that will not be easily overcome.\n\nDue to the reduced capacity at flue gas type pressures and CO2 concentrations (<0.05 mole fraction at 0.15 bar CO2 partial pressure),575 it is no longer expected that conventional, physisorbant ILs will be feasible for large scale CCS applications.585 In order to increase capacity, a range of “task-specific” ILs585–592 have been designed with functionalities (such as amine groups587 or azolates592) capable of chemisorption of CO2, thereby significantly driving up capacity at ambient pressure (0.5–2 mol CO2 per mole of IL). This has led to a diversity of structures and numerous publications on the design of anions or cations for CO2 chemisorption with ILs.593 The ability to tune the physical and chemical properties of ILs through ion design is well established.534 However, the difficulty facing chemisorbing ILs is very slow mass transport due to the extremely high viscosity of most “task-specific” ILs.594 This led to a partial divergence of academic research efforts away from solving issues with IL CCS, and toward the design and synthesis of more novel (and inevitably ever more complex) anions and especially cations for CO2 sorption. More recently, several studies have looked at physicochemical properties of IL–CO2 systems, including thermodynamic modelling,595 transport,596,597 kinetics of CO2 uptake,582,598 and the mechanisms of CO2 capture.599,600 However, in order to take full advantage of the tunable synthesis of IL structures, chemical functionalisation remains the preferred route to increased capacity.\n\n5.3.1 Functionalised ILs for chemisorption of CO2. A comprehensive review on the topic of active-site functionalised ILs in CO2 uptake was recently published by Cui et al.585 Here we provide a summary of CO2 chemisorption, discussed in the context of CCS applications at large scale. Functionalisation of ILs, particularly the cation of ILs, is a classic means of IL solvent design.534 There are several different functional group classes that have been explored for increasing the affinity of ILs for CO2, each of which is rooted in traditional CO2 binding chemistry. The starting point of this field in normally seen as the amino-functionalised ILs, as a means of introducing the most common liquid-based reactive site for the efficient and reversible capture of CO2. While this continues to dominate the literature since its inception in 2002,586 many other functionalities have since been developed.585\n\nAmine-functionalised cations. Bates et al.586 reported the first synthesis of an IL specifically designed to chemically bind CO2 with the IL 1-propylamide-3-butylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, which is essentially a cation-bound amino group. They reported up to 0.5 moles of CO2 could be captured per ion pair at atmospheric CO2 pressure. The mechanism they reported was similar to aqueous amines, though only one carbamate salt can form per two ion pairs.586 This highlights one of the drawbacks listed above for IL-based CCS: amine functionalised cations cannot bind as much CO2 per amine on a molar basis, much less compete on a mass or volume basis where the molecular weight of the IL outdistances that of a traditional amine several fold at similar densities. Further, as discussed below, the functionalisation of the cation inherently lowers electron density at the amine site, leading to reduced interactions with CO2. A similar IL, 1-(3-aminopropyl)-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, demonstrated relatively slow kinetics for CO2 uptake compared to aqueous amines, due to the high viscosity of amine-functionalised ILs. However, although the viscosity increases dramatically upon complexation with CO2,601,602 the absorption of CO2 was significantly higher than for the analogous physisorbing IL 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate. Further studies confirmed the 1 : 2 carbamate formation motif,603,604 suggesting a potential upper limit for CO2 capacity in amine-functionalised ILs. Indeed, given the much higher molar mass of the IL cation and anion (essentially “dead weight” for this application), the CO2 uptake on a mole per unit mass basis is obviously poor for any IL functionalised in this manner.570 Much cheaper and simpler anions (sulfonate) and cation units (ammonium) can be used to mitigate this effect, though only to a small extent.605 A final limitation on this approach lies in the chemical similarity to traditional amines: tertiary amine-based ILs can only perform physisorption, while primary amines can engage in chemisorption. While not surprising, this does confirm the chemical limitations of amino-functionalised ILs are analogous to those of the corresponding amines.\n\nIn order to overcome the stoichiometric limitations associated with amine-functionalised ILs, Wang et al.606 synthesised a series of tunable alkanolamine-functionalsied ILs coordinated to alkali metal ions in a quasi-aza-crown ether. This afforded an extra degree of freedom depending on the nature of the inorganic ions utilised. These led to molar ratios slightly above 1 : 2, but with much improved kinetics, indicating the carbamate mechanism still prevailed. Later, Yang and He607 used PEG-functionalised ILs chelated to Li ions to achieve molar ratios well above 1 : 2 (nearly up to 1 : 1). However, the molar mass of these ILs is very high, suggesting less improvement on a mole per unit mass basis. There are also general concerns surrounding IL cost – in order to mitigate cost concerns, Vijayraghavan et al.608 created a series of less expensive protic ionic liquids based on diamines to achieve CO2 loadings of 13% w/v, thus using lower molar mass to improve performance at the same carbamate limit. This aspect of IL design (cost) has only recently gained attention for potential large-scale application of ILs.609\n\nAmine-functionalised anions. Since the anion of the IL is the more electron rich centre, it is a natural source for CO2 interactions. This has commonly involved the use of (deprotonated) amino acids with tethered amine groups (such as lysine) as the anionic component of the IL. While amino acids are naturally abundant, there are several misconceptions about their nature. For example, they are relatively high in cost (owing to difficult synthesis or isolation), and fairly toxic.610 However, they are unquestionably biodegradable, and their use is not regulated. Their incorporation into ILs is fairly difficult, however, due to the need to use a hydroxide intermediate,611 which is normally obtained through ion exchange chromatography. Also, amino acid ILs are highly viscous, highly basic and (as with amino acids themselves) have low thermal stability. In order to overcome the relatively poor mass transport in these ILs, Zhang et al.612 synthesised silica-supported amino acid ILs with an extra amine group and created 1 : 2 complexes with CO2. The viscosity of these ILs was later reduced by using small teraalkylammonium cations in place of Zhang's tetraalkylphosphonium centres,613,614 with similar CO2 capacities. While a range of amino acids can be used, the necessity of a free amine group to increase capacity is obvious. This necessitates the use of the deprotonated, highly basic free amine form of the amino acid, with negative consequences for potential thermal or chemical stability of the IL. As the most common mechanism of IL degradation is nucleophilic attack of the cation by the anion (followed by dealkylation of the cation),615 the basic (and nucleophilic) nature of these amino anions is detrimental. More stable cations, such as tetraalkylphosphonium salts, can alleviate this effect to some extent,576,616 creating ILs which compete with aqueous amines on a (molar) capacity basis. Glycine and sarcosine ILs with phosphonium cations617,618 and tetraalkylammonium methionine619 have each shown essentially equimolar CO2 uptake, though not all amino acid ILs showed this level. Additionally, according to Luo et al.,620 functionalised methylbenzolate-based ILs and nicotinate-based ILs with an amino group at the para or ortho position exhibit both higher capacity and lower enthalpy than related structures. It was later pointed out that the absorption was significantly affected by the nature of anions, due to different entropic driving forces for the reaction with CO2.585\n\nWhile the ILs mentioned thus far relied on long chain (trihexyltetradecyl phosphonium or ammonium) cations, traditional amino acid based ILs pair a much smaller cation. This can have disadvantages for transport properties, but more importantly bring the molal (mol kg−1) absorption values up due to smaller molecular mass. Tetrabutylphosphonium cations paired with a variety of amino acid anions have shown equimolar CO2 uptake (often at several bar of pressure),621 though alkylation of the amino acid removes chemisorption possibilities.622 While transport and stability are issues with the shorter cation systems, supporting the IL on silica can help.623\n\nAprotic heterocyclic anions (AHAs). Since amine-functionalised ILs chemisorb CO2 similarly to liquid amines (by making the carbamate half of a liquid amine complex), the resultant solutions always suffer from extremely high viscosities post-capture, limiting their potential as usable solvent systems.579,582,585,612 There are many alternative structures that can bind CO2 without forming carbamates – and after all, the synthetic flexibility of ILs is what attracts researchers to the field. Therefore other anions have been employed to bind CO2 without forming high-viscosity carbamate disalt structures.\n\nAzolate ILs (aprotic heterocyclic anion ILs)624,625 capture CO2 in equimolar quantities, and the anions are fairly straightforward to obtain through neutralisation of an azole superbase. Examples such as tetraalkylphosphonium pyrazolate can capture equimolar CO2 at atmospheric pressure, while tetrazolate, triazolate, and even pyrrolidonate anions have been shown to be moderately effective, and the use of imidazolate as an anion provided a nice symmetry to the field of ILs by incorporating the most common cation structure as an anion.580 These very basic anions even sometimes show a slight decrease in viscosity upon CO2 absorption,580,626 though viscosities still typically range close to 1000 cP. Refining the structure of these salts led to the development of the aprotic heterocyclic anion (AHA) based ILs or azolide ILs.584,594,598,627–633 These anions absorb nearly equimolar amounts of CO2 at much lower viscosities than azolate ILs. Molecular dynamics simulations have shown that the CO2 uptake is enhanced through chemical interaction with the anion.624 Both kinetics625 and thermodynamics584,632 for CO2 uptake by tetraalkylphosphonium AHAs have been investigated. It is clear that substituted imidazolate anions can be used to vary reactivity, enthalpy of binding and CO2 capacity. This can clearly be attributed to the relative electron density (and therefore reactivity) of the active site on the anion. By varying the alkyl chain lengths on the cation (from 38 total carbons down to 14), the viscosity could be reduced to under 100 cP without impacting molar uptake.634 This was later attributed to differences in reaction entropy and ionicity,635 though it is additionally important to note that the uptake in moles per unit mass would now be significantly higher, resulting in an intensified process.570\n\nWhat is clear from the AHAs is that the anion basicity has a controlling influence on the CO2 uptake. This is similar to the amine-functionalised cation dominance, and is unsurprising – the more electron-rich the reactive site of the ion, the more CO2 will be chemisorbed. However, traditional ILs with very basic anions become both highly viscous and unstable, and the AHAs appear to at least be able to avoid the viscosity issues. While tuning anion basicity does enable greater control over CO2 uptake, the highly complex nature of these ion structures does not lend much promise to industrial application for cost reasons. Additionally, higher capacity through electron density increase is normally associated with higher enthalpies of binding and therefore more energy on regeneration. One proposed method to break this co-dependence is to use alkali metal salts in conjunction with IL–PEG mixtures.629,636 This enables the use of less basic azolate anions, though PEG is also a highly viscous solvent. However, equimolar absorption can be achieved with lower desorption energies.636 This can be exploited to ensure easier reversibility,637 as the balance between physisorption and chemisorption can be manipulated, changing the Gibbs free energies of the capture between somewhat negative and slightly positive.585\n\n5.3.2 CO2 capture through IL-based proton transfer. It is well established that there are acidic protons on most IL cations, most famously the C2 position of dialkylimidazolium salts.534 This can create opportunities for interactions with CO2 through the quasi-carbene structure of these moieties.638 Taken to an extreme, CO2 can be induced to react into the IL system through the construction of chemical elements designed for this to happen. The C2 proton itself can of course be removed to form an N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and this was demonstrated by Mathews et al.639 to occur during Suzuki couplings in ILs.639 Cabaco et al.638 used this to great effect to react the dialkylimidazolium cation with CO2 in a carboxylation reaction, and identified the product through IR spectroscopy. This creates a 1 : 1 CO2 complex with the cation, rather than the anion, and is a reversible adduct. However, neither the NHC intermediate, nor the ILs themselves are especially stable,581 and the presence of impurities such as water has been noted as likely to prevent this mechanism from occurring.2 The absorption was shown to proceed through an NHC–CO2 complex based on NMR results,640 and it was later demonstrated that the C2 could be deprotonated by very basic anions alone.641 Unfortunately, the theoretical mole fraction of maximum capture relative to IL is only 1 : 3 for this mechanism,585 thus leading to only moderate sorption, but these salts are more readily available for other applications,642 and the complex itself is reversible.643,644 Interestingly, tetraalkylphosphonium acetates645 also demonstrate high CO2 sorption, despite the lack of any possible NHC adduct. This can be attributed to CO2–anion interactions, though the mechanism of this remains unclear.646 As this effect is restricted to highly basic anions, and these have already been mentioned as having low stability, it is not clear how this limitation can be effectively prevented. Wang et al.647 attempted this by mixing imidazolium ILs with superbases, forming a dicationic–dianionic complex (zwitterionic imidazolium carboxylate) wherein the imidazolium cation was deprotonated by the superbase during CO2 sorption. Alkylation of the C2 position was confirmed to prevent this effect entirely, thus establishing the mechanism of equimolar capture, though the stability of the salts was not analysed.\n\nAn interesting combination of the imidazolium-anion proton transfer concept involves the use of imidazolium azolates.648,649 Here the azolate anion is used to effect deprotonation of the imidazolium cation, resulting in CO2 carboxylation. Seo et al.649 proposed that the carbene intermediate was responsible through two distinct pathways (anion–CO2 binding and NHC–CO2 complexation). However, the complex resulted in 1 : 2 complexation of CO2 and was only reversible if the resulting carbamate salt was broken. The ability to mediate CO2 chemisorption through transfer of CO2 from the anion to the cation is an interesting concept, though it is again unlikely that these carboxylated cationic complexes will form in the presence of water from flue gas; the presence of water vapour is likely to prevent the NHC intermediate from forming or from being re-protonated, resulting in diminished sorption capacity. While the AHAs can also be used to create ILs where CO2 can react directly with a protonated cation,650,651 this provides a system that has a very high regeneration energy.585\n\nA prior (similar) example of this approach was the series of “switchable” ILs demonstrated by Jessop et al.652 where a superbase (1,8-diazabicyclo-[5.4.0]undec-7-ene or tetramethylguanidine) can deprotonate the alkylcarbbonic acid formed from an alcohol reacting with CO2, forming a transiently stable salt. These CO2-binding organic liquids (CO2BOLs) have near equimolar capacity652–655 though regeneration is not trivial. Similar effects have been demonstrated for amino acid (OH) deprotonation by Wang et al.656 where a hydroxyl-functionalised IL cation and superbase combine to react with CO2. While equimolar capture is again possible, release is difficult under CO2 atmospheres, and heating can cause decomposition or volatilisation of the components. Some of the normal limitations, such as transport issues, can be obviated by using the alcohol as a diluent and reactant, as with β-amino acid anion-based ILs diluted in simple alcohols.657 This is a similar approach to MEA in water, and the methylcarbonate salt (formed in methanol) is key to the equimolar capture process (relative to the IL). A variety of cationic species were demonstrated as effective, including some relatively simple cations such as tetramethylammonium – here the small molecular weight of the cation could be advantageous for process intensification. However, there is a generic issue with superbase-IL CO2 capture – the need for releasing the CO2 under CO2-free atmospheres limits application.\n\nAn alternative approach is to directly capture the CO2-based protons through protonation of a sufficiently active amine base.658 In the presence of water, this becomes similar to aqueous amine capture processes, where a carbamate or carbonate-based equilibrium protonation will dominate, as the carbamate salt is hydrolysed into a bicarbonate salt, even with tertiary amines.659 This yields somewhat higher capacities for tertiary amines (1 : 1) vs. primary or secondary amines (1 : 2 to 1 : 1) though the absorption is very slow.1\n\n5.3.3 Hydroxylate ILs. While the reaction of CO2 with hydroxides is well known, it can also be applied to ionic liquids (or at least organic salts), as for tetrabutylammonium hydroxide aqueous solutions.660 While this is efficient sorption, the bicarbonate salt formed would not be regenerable without decomposing the cation.585 The same principle was applied to other ILs based on deprotonated alcohols, such as trifluoroethanol or other fluorinated alcohols, with equimolar sorption achieved.580 However, it should be noted that these salts are unlikely to be stable, and regeneration will be difficult to achieve without decomposition. These “superbase” ILs can be regenerated with N2 bubbling at elevated temperatures661 but this is not representative of a CO2 capture process, where the CO2 would not be released through N2 displacement.\n\nOther alcohol-based cations include phenolate anions, which Wang reviewed recently.585 These can be prepared from the corresponding hydroxide salt by neutralisation with any substituted phenol.662 This is a general limitation of strongly basic ILs – the weakly acidic conjugate species must be deprotonated by a strong base such as hydroxide, and hydroxide salts are difficult to prepare at scale. However, this did demonstrate the utility of a series of substituted phenolate ILs for CO2 uptake and the surprising variation in CO2 sorption that could be achieved by varying the electron density in the anion, as was discussed above for azolate salts. The recurring theme of tuning CO2 capture through anion electronegativity or reactivity is a core part of the appeal of ILs for use in this field, though the synthetic complexity required to achieve this may render scale-up of these salts difficult.\n\n5.3.4 ILs with multiple functional groups for capture. The ability to introduce multiple functional groups (onto the cation, anion or both) and retain a liquid state is one of the more attractive aspects of IL research. Attempts to use this for CCS purposes have met with mixed results, normally as higher capacity fights with increased viscosity due to functionalisation. For example, two amine groups on the cation have been shown to increase CO2 capacity to 1.05 equivalents,663 while three amines increases capacity to 1.49 equivalents at 1 bar.664 Even more success has been found with anion functionalisation, where (deprotonated) lysine and histidine based anions captured up to 2 equivalents of CO2 at 1 bar618,619 though the rate of absorption was very slow. This is an unfortunate consequence of increased functionality – higher capacity is a trade-off with slower kinetic uptake due to higher viscosity. It should be noted, however, that the anion functionalisation are relatively simple (amino acids) compared to functionalisation of the cation (to create aza-crown ethers, for example). Amines can also be placed on both the cation and the anion579 to increase capacity, but uptake remains slow even when immobilised on silica. Alternatively, amine-functionalised cations combined with AHAs can be used for simultaneous captures through carbamate and carboxylate mechanisms,648 though once again the increase in capacity comes at a cost of rate and water stability.2\n\nSince anion functionisation is easier (and the anions come with built-in CO2-philicity due to the negative charge), multifunctional anions have been proposed where multiple capture sites are designed to be co-operative. This is analogous to the stabilising effects present in alkanolamines, though the methods differ. For example, high CO2 capacity and reversibility can be achieved by using a second interacting site on the AHA anions (phenolate, imidazolate) to stabilise the CO2 adduct.665,666 This includes hydroxypyridine (capacities up to 1.65 equivalents) where simultaneous carbamate/carbonate formation introduces added capacity, as demonstrated spectroscopically.666 This multi-functional cooperation could provide a blueprint for future anion design.\n\n5.3.5 Methods for overcoming mass transport limits. The high viscosity of ILs is a widely acknowledged limitation in CCS-based applications. As such, several approaches have been used to get over these limitations, most notably blending ILs with water (usually), and supporting ILs on solids,585 including very high viscosity ILs, such as amino acid salts, which have been blended with water, or absorbed on silica surfaces with water.612 The mechanisms employed do change, with a transient carbamate species giving way to more stable (bi)carbonate salts,667–670 similar to aqueous alkanolamine capture. While the equimolar (to IL) CO2 sorption capacity remains, the dilution does remove some of the advantages of ILs over aqueous amines (including volumetric capacity and energy of regeneration).585,671,672 Similarly for acetate IL–water blends, the carboxylation capture mechanism gives way to carbonate formation,673 which is irreversible,644 and acetic acid,673 though the stability is concentration dependent and water content may be manipulated to form a reversible system.674\n\n5.3.6 IL blends with amines. Blends of ILs with amines have been demonstrated as a means of providing hybrid media for CCS with lower volatility and higher thermal stability than aqueous amines, at a lower regeneration energy.675,676 Blends of amino acid ILs with aqueous MDEA show high capture ability dependent on composition677 and the ability to regenerate through either pressure- or temperature-swing desorption,678,679 with superior performance at relatively low (5–10 wt%) IL concentration in 30 wt% aqueous amine.677 Other amino acid IL blends with AMP680 and MEA681,682 show similar promise, although the advantage over amino acid blends with amines remains unclear.\n\n5.3.7 Challenges and opportu"
