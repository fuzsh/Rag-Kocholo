Kathryn Cramer Brownell, who received her B.A. from the University of Michigan, is associate professor of history at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, where she teaches courses in 20th century American history. Before joining the Perdue faculty, she taught in the history department at Boston University, where she received her PhD. Her book, Showbiz Politics: Hollywood in American Political Life, (2014), explores the institutionalization of Hollywood in American politics.

Brownell is now working on a book that examines the rise of cable and the influence of 24-hour news on American political life from the 1970s through the 1990s. She is also co-editor of the “Made By History” column of The Washington Post.
