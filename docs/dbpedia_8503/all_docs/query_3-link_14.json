        "text": "Katherine (Kathy) J. Cramer is the Virginia Sapiro Professor of Political Science and the Natalie C. Horton Chair of Letters and Science at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. Her work focuses on the ways that people make sense of politics and their place in it. By listening to people talk with one another, Kathy’s research has revealed the central roles of race, place, and class in political beliefs and behaviors. Her scholarship has been recognized not only for its contributions to our understanding of American political behavior, but for her rigorous methodological innovations, employing ethnographic and community-based fieldwork to observe politics through conversations.\n\nKathy received her bachelor’s degree at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (1994) and her Ph.D. at the University of Michigan (2000). She is the co-chair of an American Academy of Arts & Science commission called Reimagining Our Economy. She is a close collaborator with the Center for Constructive Communication at the MIT Media Lab and its partner nonprofit, Cortico, and is one of the founders of Fora, a human-tech platform that enables people to understand their community members’ life experiences, amplify typically underheard voices, inform public understanding, and drive policy and decision making to better outcomes. Her book, The Politics of Resentment (2016), is widely considered one of the authoritative works on understanding the rural-urban divide in the United States and its role in contemporary politics. She is a faculty affiliate of an array of interdisciplinary programs and departments at UW-Madison. She has been elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Academy of Political and Social Science, and the Wisconsin Academy of Sciences, Arts and Letters."
