        "text": "Catherine Cortez Masto (born March 29, 1964, Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S.) is an American politician who was elected to the U.S. Senate as a Democrat in 2016 and began her first term representing Nevada in that body the following year; she was the first Latina to serve as a U.S. senator and was reelected in 2022. She previously was attorney general for the state (2007–15).\n\nCortez was born in Las Vegas, the seat of Clark county. Her grandfather was an immigrant from Chihuahua, Mexico, and her father, Manny Cortez, was an ally of Democratic politician Harry Reid. After studying finance at the University of Nevada (B.S., 1986), she earned a law degree (1990) from Gonzaga University. Cortez then worked for Gov. Bob Miller, eventually becoming his chief of staff (1995–99). During this time she met Paul Masto, a U.S. Secret Service agent, and the couple later married.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2001 Cortez Masto worked as a federal prosecutor in Washington, D.C. She then served as assistant manager of Clark county (2002–05). In 2006 she won election as the state’s attorney general, serving the full two-term limit from 2007 to 2015. Like Kamala Harris, attorney general of neighbouring California, she gained national attention for her role in a nationwide mortgage-fraud settlement that brought Nevada more than $1.9 billion. She also headed large-scale prosecutions of illegal drug and sex traffickers.\n\nIn 2015 Reid, a longtime senator, announced that he would not seek a sixth term. Cortez Masto was persuaded to run for his seat, and she faced off against Republican Joe Heck, who had served in the U.S. House of Representatives. The highly contentious campaign featured intensively negative advertisements and involved spending in excess of $100 million, much of it from out of state. Cortez Masto consistently trailed in the polls until Republican presidental nominee Donald Trump’s negative remarks about Hispanics helped consolidate southern Nevada’s heavily Hispanic vote in her favour. She ultimately carried the state by a five-point margin of victory, having campaigned on a platform that included raising the minimum wage, protecting Medicare and Social Security, and passing comprehensive immigration reform. In addition to being the first Latina elected to the U.S. Senate, Cortez Masto became the first woman to represent Nevada in that body when she took office in 2017.\n\nCortez Masto opposed many of Republican Pres. Donald Trump’s policies. During her first year in office she voted against a massive tax-reform bill and helped defeat efforts to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In 2019 the House of Representatives impeached Trump, who was accused of withholding aid to Ukraine in order to pressure the country into opening a corruption investigation into Joe Biden (in 2020 Biden became the Democratic presidential nominee). Cortez Masto voted for Trump’s conviction during the Senate trial in 2020, but the president was acquitted in an almost party-line vote. Shortly thereafter the U.S. economy collapsed as schools and businesses began closing due to the coronavirus pandemic. With its reliance on the hospitality industry, Nevada was especially hard hit, and Cortez Masto secured various relief measures for the state."
