        "text": "The eighth annual Kathryn Cramer Visiting Lecture Series will take place April 12 from 8 to 11 a.m. in the Jaffar Lecture Hall at the Wayne State University School of Medicine.\n\nAll faculty, staff, residents and students are welcome to attend.\n\nKeynote speakers include Diane Nam, MSc M.D. FRCSC; Betina Hinckel, M.D., Ph.D.; and Anna Ledgerwood, M.D.\n\nDr. Nam is a clinician-scientist in the Holland Bone and Joint Program/Biological Sciences Platform at the Sunnybrook Research Institute and an associate professor of Surgery at the University of Toronto. She is an orthopaedic trauma surgeon at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center with subspecialty expertise in polytraumatic conditions of the upper limb, and fellowship director of the Sunnybrook Orthopaedic Upper Limb program. She has a high-volume trauma and elective clinical practice managing complex tertiary referrals of post-traumatic complications/sequelae, tendon reconstruction/transfers of the shoulder and primary/revision shoulder and elbow arthroplasty. She is principal investigator of a multi-centered randomized controlled clinical trial studying a novel treatment to improve fracture healing.\n\nDr. Hinckel is an assistant professor of Orthopaedic Surgery at Oakland University and an attending physician at Beaumont Hospital. She has a special interest in patellofemoral joint and cartilage restoration. She has written multiple book chapters, review articles and original studies in those issues. She is a member of the International Patellofemoral Study Group, and completed her doctoral degree in medial patellofemoral ligament, medial patellotibial ligament and medial patellomeniscal ligament: anatomical, histological, radiographic and biomechanical study.\n\nDr. Ledgerwood is a professor of surgery for the Wayne State University School of Medicine and trauma director at Detroit Receiving Hospital. She is certified by the American Board of Surgery. Dr. Ledgerwood is a frequent guest lecture at other medical schools, and helps the American College of Surgeons verify hospital trauma centers. Her clinical interests include gastrointestinal, oncologic, bariatric, trauma, emergency surgery and critical care, with a research interest in shock, resuscitation, injury, sepsis and education.\n\nThe series is named for Dr. Cramer, a 1986 graduate of the WSU School of Medicine who joined the faculty in 1998 as a clinical specialist in orthopaedic trauma. She practiced at Detroit Receiving Hospital and Children's Hospital of Michigan until illness forced her retirement in 2003. She died in 2005.\n\nIn addition to being an outstanding clinician and educator, Dr. Cramer was an inspirational role model to female medical students, especially those considering careers in orthopaedic surgery. She achieved preeminence in the specialty during an era when female orthopaedists were a rarity.\n\n“We have a paucity of women who are applying to orthopaedic surgery and would like to promote orthopaedic surgery and women’s achievements in orthopaedic surgery,” said Rahul Vaidya, M.D., chair of the WSU Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and chief of Orthopaedic Trauma Surgery for the Detroit Medical Center. “Kathy Cramer was a prominent orthopaedic surgeon from our institution and we wanted to do something in her honor.”\n\nSince 2012, the Detroit Medical Center/Wayne State University Department of Orthopaedic Surgery has hosted the annual lecture series in Dr. Cramer’s honor.\n\nThe agenda includes:\n\n7:30 to 8 a.m.: Breakfast\n\n8 to 8:15 a.m.: Introduction, Ann Cramer\n\n8:15 to 9 a.m.: ”Fracture Healing: We Can Do Better,” Diane Nam, M.D., MsC, FRCSC\n\n9 a.m. to 9:15 a.m.: Break\n\n9:15 to 10 a.m.: “Patellofemoral Disorders,” Betina Hinckel, M.D., Ph.D.\n\n10 to 10:15 a.m.: Break\n\n10:15 to 11 a.m.: “With Liberty and Justice For All: An Update,” Anna Ledgerwood, M.D.\n\n11 to 11:15 a.m. Question and answer speaker panel\n\n11:15 to 11:30: Conclusion\n\nRSVP at https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/DMCKathrynCramer2023.
