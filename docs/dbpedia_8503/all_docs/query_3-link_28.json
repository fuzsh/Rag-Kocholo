She reveals that 'showbiz politics' were not just an amusing sideshow; instead, they became an integral part of opinion-shaping and governance.”--American Historical Review\n\n“Brownell has authored a well-written and well-researched book that will command the attention of historians interested in how politics work in modern America. The evidence and materials she has brought together will provide historians with a new way to explore what has been lacking in the study of the United States: how art intersects with political power.”--Lary May, in the Canadian Journal of History\n\n“This book makes clear that Hollywood entertainers, moguls ,and marketers became hugely powerful within our political culture—particularly related to the presidency—way before Reagan.”--Journal of American History"
