Her research and teaching focus on the relationships between media, politics, and popular culture, with an emphasis on the American presidency.\n\nSpecialization:\n\nU.S. History; 20th Century U.S. Political History, the American Presidency, and the Media\n\nHer first book, Showbiz Politics: Hollywood in American Political Life, (University of North Carolina Press, 2014) explores the institutionalization of Hollywood in American politics. This book traces the key personal relationships, institutions, and government policies that established the foundation for a celebrity political culture and made entertainment a central feature of American politics.\n\nHer second book, 24/7 Politics: Cable Television and the Fragmenting of America from Watergate to Fox News, (Princeton University Press, 2023), explores the political battle over cable television from the 1960s through today, excavating how the American political process became tethered to the business interests of a corporate cable television industry.\n\nShe also serves as Senior Editor for the Made By History column at TIME Magazine: https://time.com/author/made-by-history/\n\nTo learn more about her research and teaching initiatives and to read her recent op-eds, follow her on Twitter, @Kathryn.Brownell"
