        "text": "BOURBONNAIS, Ill. --- The University of St. Francis women's indoor track & field team claimed two individual titles and boasted four \"A\" standard marks at the Olivet Nazarene University Walter Cramer Invite on Saturday. Earning the individual crowns were Mara Bruno and Ana Mendoza Pineda.\n\nBruno won the long jump competition over 22 other individuals with a distance of 17 feet, 3.25 inches. She also placed third out of 24 performers in the 60-meter dash with a time of 7.98 seconds. That placed her just ahead of teammate Emerson Colins, who was a hundredth of a second behind at 7.99.\n\nUSF dominated the 3,000-meter event with six of the top seven finishers being Saints. That included Pineda, Bailey Wilk, Katherine Bakken and Allison Ramsey, all of whom hit the \"A\" standard.\n\nPineda was the top finisher among 28 runners with her time of 10:17.14. Wilk was next in line at 10:21.39, followed by Bakken (10:23.85) and Ramsey (10:25.58).\n\nNo team scores were kept at the meet.\n\nUSF is back in action next Friday and Saturday at the Grand Valley State University (Mich.) Big Meet.\n\nYou can keep up with everything happening around USF Athletics on Twitter @USFSaints.\n\nPlayers Mentioned"
