        "text": "The Oregon Citizens’ Initiative Review (CIR) distinguishes itself by linking a small deliberative body to the larger electoral process. Since 2010, CIR citizen panels have been a legislatively authorized part of Oregon general elections to promote a more informed electorate. The CIR gathers a representative cross-section of two dozen voters for 5 days of deliberation on a single ballot measure. The process culminates in the citizen panelists writing a Citizens’ Statement that the secretary of state inserts into the official Voters’ Pamphlet sent to each registered voter. This study analyzes the effect of one such Citizens’ Statement from the 2010 general election. In Study 1, an online survey experiment found that reading this Statement influenced Oregon voters’ values trade-offs, issue knowledge, and vote intentions. In Study 2, regression analysis of a cross-sectional phone survey found a parallel association between the Statement’s use and voting choices but yielded some mixed findings.\n\nTY - JOUR\n\nT1 - Assessing the Electoral Impact of the 2010 Oregon Citizens’ Initiative Review\n\nAU - Gastil, John\n\nAU - Knobloch, Katherine R.\n\nAU - Reedy, Justin\n\nAU - Henkels, Mark\n\nAU - Cramer, Katherine\n\nN1 - Publisher Copyright: © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.\n\nPY - 2018/5/1\n\nY1 - 2018/5/1\n\nN2 - The Oregon Citizens’ Initiative Review (CIR) distinguishes itself by linking a small deliberative body to the larger electoral process.
