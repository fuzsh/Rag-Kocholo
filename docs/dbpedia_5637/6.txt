In the 60's, 70's, and beyond, Jerry Rubin was a well-known counter-cultural leader - founder of the Yippies, Anti-Vietnam War radical, Chicago 8 defendant, New Age/Self Help proponent, and social-networking pioneer.

He's originally from Cincinnati and author Pat Thomas recently released an extensive biography of Rubin titled Did It! From Yippie to Yuppie Jerry Rubin An American Revolutionary and he's joined by Rubin's brother, Gil, in this conversation with Lee Hay.
