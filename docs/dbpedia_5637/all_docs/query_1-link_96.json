        "text": "The Chicago Seven/Eight\n\nI just finished reading the book “From the Trial of the Chicago 8/7 – The Tales of Hoffman” – edited from the official trial transcripts.\n\nLike many, I recall the drama that unfolded on the national TV news network broadcasts back in March of 1968 during the Democrat National Convention, held in Chicago. I remember the outrage I felt witnessing the assaults out on the streets while the convention continued on the floor of the International Amphitheater.\n\nMore than a few convention attendees pleaded for the police action to cease, a plea that fell on deaf ears.\n\nBut what I really never had a understanding of was what was to transpire inside the court room in Chicago beginning. The book is a chronological listing of selected dialogue exchanges taking place during the trial.\n\nThat is about all I have to relate about that time in our country’s history. Like most everything I present here, I turn to the vinyl side of things, recordings about those times, recordings by folks who factored into the story – not necessarily recordings about the story.\n\nThere was plenty of material to draw from due to the celebrity roster that he defense paraded (or attempted to parade) through the courtroom.\n\nIf you are curious, I recommend reading the book especially after all this time has passed. At times it is uplifting, at times sad, and at time disappointing on the part of both sides – including the prosecution team, the defense team, the presiding judge and the defendants. Sort of like a room full of little children at times. But those were very different times….\n\nPS: The trial resulted in many, many contempt citations as well as guilty verdicts, but over the next few following years, many charges were dropped, and many/most sentences were overturned, or imprisonments not fully enforced. Also, judge Hoffman was officially censored for some of his behavior on the bench.\n\nThe Motion Picture\n\nWith all of this, I just finished viewing the motion picture “The Trial of the Chicago 7”. I feel that it was very well done, quality actors, started off in what appeared to be an accurate historical account but then, just past the middle going into the end, Hollywood took over.\n\nBest thing to do is read the trial account above then watch and decide for yourself.\n\nChicago Seven/Eight Selected Related Discography\n\nTimothy Leary\n\nCountry Joe McDonald\n\nWilliam S.
