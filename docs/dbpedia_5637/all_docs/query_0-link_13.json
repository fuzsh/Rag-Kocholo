        "text": "Re: '60s activist Jerry Rubin dies at 56, Nov. 30.\n\nI read with great sadness Jerry Rubin's obituary. However, like so many other children of the '60s, it made me smile that his last act was one of defiance of\n\nauthority: jaywalking. To those of us who grew up during this turbulent time, Jerry Rubin was a beacon of reason and honor. His passionate disregard for the establishment embodied the free-thinking principles on which this country was founded.\n\nJerry Rubin, along with Abbie Hoffman, Rennie Davis, Tom Hayden and the rest of the Chicago Seven, brought to the forefront the hypocrisy of our government during the Vietnam era. They spoke for a generation, and they would not be repressed. While most of us were able only to attend rallies and marches between classes, these great Americans gave their freedom to represent us. Though history has been rewritten, and those who reviled only the war and the Pentagon are now portrayed as hating the brave men and women who followed their own consciences and served in Vietnam; we who were there remember only that we wanted everyone to have a voice. And what a voice Jerry had!\n\nI recently had the pleasure of watching a re-enactment of the Chicago Seven trial. What an example of spontaneous entertainment. How seriously Judge Julius Hoffman attempted to ply his lopsided justice. But what amusement it was to watch the \"defendants' \" Monty Python-like actions and reactions!\n\nAlthough Jerry moved on to the business world, I think it a bit unfair to suggest that he \"evolved from yippie to yuppie over the years.\" I'm not sure that's evolution. To grow and be successful in business does not necessarily imply that you embrace the status-greed-consumption values associated with yuppies. And although most of these notorious radicals grew older and moved on to work from within, it was heartwarming to read the update of their lives and to see that so many are still involved in environmental or social movements. Only Abbie Hoffman couldn't adapt, and we loved and admired him for that as well.\n\nJerry Rubin was and remains a hero of our time. I hope all of us will take some time to reflect on the activist part of our lives. Have we conformed to the point of apathy? Are we each still making an effort to right the wrongs of our society? Do we give back to our community its due? When was the last time you shot someone the peace sign and meant it?\n\nMignon McLaughlin said, \"Every society honors its live conformists and its dead troublemakers.\" Let us each take a moment to honor Jerry Rubin.\n\nMary L. Barnich, St. Petersburg\n\nKeep the rebates\n\nRe: Florida Power Rebate Program.\n\nI was astonished to read the article in the Dec. 1 Business section regarding Florida Power's announcement to discontinue rebates for customers who use less than 600 kilowatt hours of electricity.\n\nHere it goes again _ hit the lower minority group where it hurts the most _ people living in smaller quarters and those living on small, limited incomes. Anyone who knows mathematics can surmise that if Tampa Electric is satisfied with its profits and with fewer customers _ and is not changing its program _ Florida Power certainly doesn't need to either. In addition, Tampa Electric offers up to a $19 rebate while Florida Power has a maximum of $14.\n\nTaking away the rebate from lower income families and being able to save $19- to $20-million in 1995 and 1996 is nothing but greed.\n\nI sincerely hope that the Public Service Commission declines this request and is more compassionate than Florida Power.\n\nHelen V. Hannan, Dunedin\n\nOut of the country\n\nRe: Intolerance in Singapore by Christopher Lingle, Dec. 1.\n\nMr. Lingle describes a frightening episode portraying himself as the victim of what he charges are commonly practiced violations of what are regarded in this country as rights of freedom of the press and inalienable human rights because of an article he wrote while employed at the National University of Singapore. His assertion is that this is the status quo \"in Singapore and several other East Asian regimes\" The footnotes to the Times article indicate Mr. Lingle has resigned from his position in Singapore and is living here in the United States, in the relative sanctuary of Georgia.\n\nApparently a fugitive from Singapore's high court, he asks a question I presume to be rhetorical: \"Would you voluntarily return to face a judicial system?\" where the prime minister of Singapore has said the government would \" \"throw the book'if (I am) found guilty?\" He further declares, \"If a simple newspaper article is interpreted as a serious threatthe government admits to occupying a house of glass\" He depicts Asian democracy as depending \"on the persecution of journalists and opposition politicians to cow them into submission.\"\n\nHaving been out of the country, perhaps he was not informed. See, there was this election last month and there's this guy from GeorgiaJ.R. Ford, Crystal Beach\n\nPut increase in perspective\n\nRe: Postal rates to rise from 29-cents to 32-cents per first-class letter.\n\nWhen you see news reports about the U.S. Postal Service plans to raise the cost of mailing a letter from 29-cents to 32-cents, why do they first interview older, retired persons and make it look like they have to make a choice between mailing a letter or putting small food morsels on their plate? Let me put the stamp increase on a different perspective. If a person mailed a letter five days a week, 52 weeks a year or 260 letters a year, that person would spend $75.40 at 29-cents per letter. With the new increase to 32-cents per letter that person would spend $83.20. That is an increase of $7.80 per year. I don't know anyone who will go hungry for $7.80 over a 12-month period. Also, how many retirees mail out 260 bills or letters per year? In reality, the USPS is a self-contained private business, not government subsidized, with normal inflationary costs.\n\nI, for one, am glad to see that the cost for stamps doesn't increase every year like everything else we purchase. When you see the volume of mail moved per year (now estimated at 177-billion pieces for 1994), they do a pretty good job of keeping up with growth, and as a senior manager at the Tampa airport mail facility stated, \"Our goal is to deliver every letter every day.\" I can assure the public that 100 percent satisfaction is the goal of the USPS under the leadership of Postmaster General Marvin Runyon.\n\nRobert E. Guthrie, Largo\n\nHire more mechanics\n\nRe: USAir takes steps to reassure public, Nov. 21.\n\nI find your article regarding retired Gen. Robert C. Oaks (hired by USAir to reassure the public in regard to USAir's safety) disturbing.\n\nSince deregulation, many airlines have been reducing their aircraft technician staff and their respective salaries at all but the major stations, thus reducing the double-checks done by mechanics. Therefore, upon the plane's arrival, there usually is not a licensed mechanic at outlaying stations to do airplane checks. A plane may make several stops without any maintenance staff ever looking at the aircraft.\n\nInstead of hiring an executive possibly at a salary of $100,000, USAir, and other airlines, need to hire a number of good mechanics _ at the same cost to the airline _ and not waste the salary on Gen. Oaks who will shuffle papers in lieu of shoring up safety for the airline. Hiring Gen. Oaks is like hiring a brain surgeon to tune up your car.\n\nHire more licensed mechanics. This policy will make airlines safer, and also take the pressure off pilots when they know there is no maintenance staff from their airline at the next small station.\n\nI speak from experience; I worked for a major airline for over 15 years.\n\nPaul G. Francoeur, Oldsmar\n\n\"Business as usual'?\n\nWith great fanfare and high hopes, Republican congressional leaders are preparing to implement their \"Contract with America.\" Their contract has been designed to make sweeping changes in the way government does business. Term limits have been promised, and government has promised to take a hard look at all existing programs and to eliminate those deemed unnecessary.\n\nThis is a worthy goal. However, a second glance at the Republican reaction to the incredible statements made by Sen. Jesse Helms, coupled with his expected appointment as chair of the Foreign Relations Committee, leave me wondering if this new Congress is willing to change business as usual when it applies to them.\n\nThough common sense would suggest Sen. Helms not be appointed, Sen. Bob Dole has stated that the appointment will occur. According to Sen. Dole, not to appoint Sen. Helms would undermine the seniority system established in Congress. While this explanation might have been appropriate prior to the election, it does not support the Republican promise to change the way government does business.\n\nThough Republican leaders may feel a seniority system is best, in the rest of the working world, seniority was replaced some time ago with merit-based promotion. As a matter of fact, conservatism demands that all promotion be based on performance and ability to do the job, without regard to outside factors such as seniority, race, age or gender. Now, rather than follow the basic concepts of conservatism, Republican leaders are choosing to do their business one way, while expecting the voting public to do theirs another.\n\nI suppose we should have expected no less. When push comes to shove in Washington, \"conservative is as conservative does.\"\n\nVincent Roth, Spring Hill\n\nApology asked\n\nCarl McClendon's Nov. 20 column, The \"angry white men,\" is an example of the new party line adopted by the self-anointed pundits of the press who are struggling to find out what caused the shift in power in both houses of Congress. He has joined the media malcontents who have chosen as their scapegoat \"angry white men.\"\n\nLiberals in academia and the media predict disaster for minorities, most notably blacks, and also the poor. Any reference to or discussion of crime, welfare, immigration or affirmative action will be labeled as racist and a concession to \"angry white men.\"\n\nNot all blacks are Democrats or view white men as threats to their progress, any more than all white men are Republicans who would deny blacks their rights or freedoms.\n\nLiberals _ black and white _ feel that the federal government has all the answers to social problems, especially when the Democrats are in power. After 40 years in power, and approximately a half-trillion dollars in taxes spent on social programs, we have more problems than we ever had. What happened?\n\nThe effort by Carl McClendon and others to target \"angry white men\" as the real obstacle to continued rights and freedoms of minorities is a blatant exercise in racism designed to exacerbate friction between white men and other minorities for political purposes.\n\nThe Times and Carl McClendon owe an apology to their readers for this exercise in racism.\n\nJohn L.
