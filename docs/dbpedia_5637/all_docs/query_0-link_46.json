        "text": "#Skillsbased #Hiring Governor Healey announced that she signed an executive order instituting skills-based hiring practices for the state’s workforce. ✰Through this Executive Order, for the vast majority of job postings, the administration will focus primarily on applicants’ skills, knowledge, and abilities rather than educational credentials. Job postings will only be allowed to include degree conditions when absolutely necessary to the performance of the job. Additionally, for the first time, hiring managers will receive training and tools to implement this new hiring strategy effectively. ➡️Read the full article: https://lnkd.in/eA2yQKkm #policy #government #commonwealth #hiring #jobs\n\nDid you know that on average, it takes 17 years for evidence-based research to be implemented? This delay impacts the quality of services and thus people's quality of life. For example, even though we know that customized job development is an effective employment strategy, only 30–60% of experts agree that it is well-implemented in the real world. Learn more in our new article, Supporting Employment Consultants to Implement Supported and Customized Employment:\n\nWe hear from employers all the time in Tennessee who struggle to find capable, job-ready candidates to fill our growing workforce, especially in high-demand areas such as skilled trades. What if we told you there is a way to join a pipeline of career-ready graduates who have spent a year building a robust set of employability skills, financial literacy, and the practical know-how to succeed in any interview or job setting? We know it sounds too good to be true - but it isn't. The JAG Tennessee program does all of these things and more, and what's better is that we have years of data that bring the receipts. If you're intrigued, let's talk more about how becoming an employer partner can benefit your hiring process, your bottom line, and even your corporate social responsibility needs.

Jeff recently published a survey of creative and marketing employers experiences of hiring graduates. We talk about this, the language of recruitment and what more can be done to bridge the gap between creative employers and university careers services. There's lots here that will be useful to agencies, educators and students. https://lnkd.in/eZwr9nhH"
