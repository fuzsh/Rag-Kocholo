        "text": "Jerry Rubin, the firebrand 1960's radical who used to preach distrust of \"anyone over 30,\" died yesterday in Los Angeles. He was 56 and lived in Los Angeles..\n\nThe cause was cardiac arrest, a hospital spokesman said. Mr. Rubin was struck by a car on Nov. 15 in Los Angeles. Local authorities said he was hit while jaywalking. He underwent surgery later that day, at the University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center and subsequently was listed in critical condition there.\n\nMr. Rubin was a bearded standard-bearer of the New Left in the 1960's who helped carve himself a niche in American radical history with fey and energetic protest gestures, though his views and style changed in subsequent decades.\n\nLooking back years later, he called himself one of \"the anticapitalistic comics of the 1960's\" who used street-theater to pursue -- without much success -- \"the radical dream of transforming the system from outside.\"\n\nIn 1967, he campaigned to elect a pig as President the United States and dropped dollar bills onto the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nEarlier in the 1960's, he became a fervent opponent of the war in Vietnam, and he spoke proudly of that opposition in later decades.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
