DATE: WEDNESDAY, November 30, 1994 TAG: 9411300061 SECTION: NATIONAL/INTERNATIONAL PAGE: A-5 EDITION: METRO SOURCE: JEFF WILSON ASSOCIATED PRESS DATELINE: LOS ANGELES LENGTH: Medium\n\nEX-YIPPIE JERRY RUBIN DIES\n\nJERRY RUBIN, WHO EVOLVED from Chicago Seven radical to Yuppie businessman, died at 56 from injuries suffered when he was hit by a car.\n\nYippie-turned-yuppie Jerry Rubin was a merry master of political theater: He mocked a judge by wearing a judicial robe to court, appeared before a congressional committee in Revolutionary War costume and showed up at protests shirtless, wearing an Uncle Sam hat and toting a toy M-16.\n\nRubin died at age 56 Monday, two weeks after he was hit by a car while crossing a street. He never regained consciousness after the accident.\n\nHis former wife, Mimi Leonard Fleischman, acknowledged that his death came with a final act of nonconformity - jaywalking.\n\n``He was a great life force, full of spunk, courage and wit,'' said state Sen. Tom Hayden, a co-defendant in the Chicago Seven trial.\n\nThe son of a Cincinnati truck driver turned union official, Rubin was catapulted to fame during the Vietnam War protests of the 1960s. Along with Abbie Hoffman, Paul Krassner and other radicals, Rubin founded the Youth International Party, or Yippie movement, dedicated to disrupting ``the system.''\n\nIn 1969 he was one of eight defendants tried on charges of conspiring to incite rioting during the 1968 Democration convention in Chicago.\n\nBlack Panther leader Bobby Seale, after being bound and gagged in the courtroom, was tried separately, so the defendants became known as the Chicago Seven. Rubin and four others were convicted, but the convictions were overturned on appeal.\n\nDuring a House Un-American Activities Committee investigation into the anti-war movement, Rubin showed up in a Revolutionary War costume, with three-cornered hat.\n\n``He was a kind of Paul Revere calling attention to the war in Vietnam. ... It was a cultural civil war,'' Krassner said from New York.\n\nAfter the Chicago Seven trial, Rubin wrote a book of political autobiography called ``Do It! Scenarios of the Revolution,'' which became a bestseller.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the bearded Yippie radical evolved into a tailored, clean-shaven young urban professional, writing the book ``Growing (Up) at 37'' in 1976.\n\nIn the '80s he became known for organizing ``networking'' parties that attracted thousands of people to the Palladium nightclub in New York on Tuesday nights. During that period he confronted Hoffman, his former sidekick and a lifelong radical, in a series of ``Yuppie vs. Yippie'' debates held around the country.\n\nWhen he died, Rubin was organizing gang leaders into distributing the health drink he marketed through his Life Extension International health foods business. He had moved to Los Angeles in 1991.\n\nRubin was perhaps best known for his outrageous behavior at the Chicago Seven trial, during which the defendants baited U.S. District Judge Julius Hoffman.\n\nProsecutor Thomas Foran recalled Rubin shouting and being in an LSD-induced state during the trial.\n\n``He once told me he used LSD 300 times,'' Foran said. ``He pretty much conquered that and became a very productive person. ... Once I met him on an airplane coming back from Washington, D.C. He was trying to get me to invest in one of his companies.''\n\nby CNB"
