October 27, 1969 where he strapped on boxing gloves, landed a haymaker on the heavy iron doors and challenged Atty. Gen. John Mitchell  to come out and fight.\n\t\n\tHe was joined by fellow Yippie and Chicago 8 defendant Jerry Rubin (partially obscured), who also wore gloves, to announce a march on the Justice Department after the planned Nov. 15, 1969 Moratorium demonstration.\n\t\n\tThe Chicago 8 were antiwar activists that ranged from pacifist to Black Panther to Yippies who were charged with conspiracy to foment the disorders at the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago. \n\t\n\tTheir trial sparked a nationwide protest movement against charges brought by the Justice Department. Independent analysis had labeled the disorders a “police riot.”\n\t\n\tRubin argued that the trial was a means of intimidating the burgeoning anti-Vietnam War movement.\n\t\n\t“The purpose of the trial is to tell people to stop protesting the war,” Rubin said.\n\t\n\tRobert Greenblatt, another Yippie from their New York office said the purpose of the planned march was to force the Justice Department to halt the prosecution.\n\t\n\t“We will surround the Department of Injustice with a half-million people. With that many people, Mitchell will have to stop the trial,” said Greenblatt.\n\t\n\t“We’re willing to use any weapons, including language” Greenblatt added tongue-in-cheek.\n\t\n\t“We’re going to hang [Vice President] Spiro Agnew, John ‘Butcher’ Mitchell and ‘Adolph Hitler’ Julius Hoffman (federal judge in the Chicago trial) in effigy.”\n\t\n\tHoffman and Rubin added that they weren’t going to receive a fair trial in Chicago so they would “confront Mitchell in the streets.”\n\t\n\tBoth Hoffman and Rubin flew in for the press conference and returned to Chicago the next day for their trial.\n\t\n\tThe demonstration went off as planned November 15th. About 10,000 of the estimated 500,000 in the Moratorium demonstration continued on to the Justice Department where they broke windows and battled police with rocks and bottles.\n\t\n\tThe “Chicago 8” (later 7 after Panther Bobby Seale’s trial was severed from the others) were acquitted by the jury of the most serious charges. Judge Hoffman sentenced them and their lawyers to long prison terms for contempt and on the charges they were found guilty of.\n\t\n\tAll charges were later voided on appeal and most of the contempt citations set-aside with none of the defendants serving any jail time.\n\t\n\tThe Yippies were known for their theatrics and skillful use of earned media.\n\t\n\tFor more information and related images, see <a href=\"https://flic.kr/s/aHskdXHKxG\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">flic.kr/s/aHskdXHKxG</a>\n\t\n\tThe photographer is unknown.
