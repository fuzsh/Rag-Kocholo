        "text": "While Paul Banks is technically the lead singer of Interpol, he sees himself more as a member of a gang of musicians. Interpol formed in 1997 after lead guitarist Daniel Kessler invited Paulâwho was a student at NYU at the timeâto watch the band rehearse.\n\nIn 2002 Interpol released their era defining album,Â Turn On The Bright Lights,Â to widespread critical acclaim. At the time they were lumped together with New York Cityâs emerging âindie sleazeâ movement with bands like The Strokes, and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. Their sophomore albumÂ AnticsÂ in 2004 surpassed critics' expectations and further evolved their sound. September marks the 20th anniversary ofÂ Antics,Â and to celebrate, Interpol is embarking on an international tour where they will play the album in full.\n\nOn todayâs episode Leah Rose talks to Paul Banks about how he wrote the lyrics to key tracks onÂ Antics. Paul also explains why he hasnât listened to rock music in over 20 years. And he remembers watching a boxing match with John Frusciante and RZA from Wu-Tang, and how John forever changed the way Paul thinks about musicality in hip-hop.\n\nYou can hear a playlist of some of our favorite Interpol & Paul Banks songs HERE.\n\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.\n\nTinasheâs changing what success in pop music can look like. Back in 2014 her song \"2 On\" featuring Schoolboy Q hit big on Billboard. With major success looming, Tinashe released projects that missed the charts but gained her a strong, loyal fanbase. In 2019 she left her major label to go independent. And judging from her massive online following today, her fans have stuck behind her.\n\nIn April, she dropped the highly meme-able track \"Nasty\" that many are calling the song of the summer. âNastyâ comes from her album Quantum Baby, the second part in a trilogy of new albums.\n\nJustin Richmond spoke to Tinashe from Amazon Studio 126 about her new albums and what it took to go independent. They also talk about her role in The Polar Express and working with Tom Hanks.\n\nYou can hear a playlist of some of our favorite Tinashe songs HERE.\n\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.\n\nTrue to her Texas roots, Edie Brickell can seemingly find a song anywhereâincluding out of thin air.Â Here It ComesÂ is the new album from Edie and her collaborators, CJ Camerieri and Trever Hagen who are known as Heavy MakeUp.\n\nHeavy MakeUp is, of course, only the latest musical iteration for Edie whoâs found herself ever evolving over her career. From her first hit with the New Bohemians, co-writing their massive 1988 single âWhat I Am,â sheâs never stopped looking for songs. She even spent the better part of a decade writing and performing with Steve Martin on their very own musicalâBright Starâthat ran on Broadway in 2016.\n\nOn todayâs episode, Bruce Headlam talks with Edie, CJ and Trever about the origins of Heavy MakeUp and the recording of their new album. We'll also hear a short performance demonstrating the unique improvisational nature of their work.\n\nYou can hear a playlist of some of our favorite Heavy MakeUp & Edie Brickell songs HERE.\n\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.\n\nLegends are made at the Olympics and this summer shows across the Pushkin network are bringing their unique takes to Olympic stories. This special episode includes excerpts from a few: a Cautionary Tale about underestimating female marathoners, a Jesse Owens story from Revisionist Historyâs series on Hitlerâs Olympics, andâfrom Whatâs Your Problemâthe new technology thatâs helping Olympic athletes get stronger.\n\nCheck out other show feeds as well, the Happiness Lab and A Slight Change of Plans are also going to the Games.\n\nSylvia Blemker of Springbok Analytics on Whatâs Your Problem\n\nThe Women Who Broke the Marathon Taboo on Cautionary Tales\n\nHitlerâs Olympics from Revisionist History\n\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.\n\nShannon & The Clams were long time regulars in the Bay Area music scene. The bandâs two main songwritersâShannon Shaw and Cody Blanchard met in college in Oakland, California. They remained there for about a decade until a number of events set them adrift physically and spiritually.\n\nThe bandâs new album,Â The Moon Is In the Wrong Place, is taken from a phrase Shannonâs fiancÃ©, Joe Haener uttered shortly before his passing. Much of the album is anchored around Shannonâs grief. On today's episode Justin Richmond talks to Shannon Shaw and Cody Blanchard about moving away from Oakland, the aftermath of losing a loved one, and about their Dan Auerbach-produced album,Â The Moon Is In The Wrong Place.\n\nYou can hear a playlist from Shannon's late fiancÃ©, Joe Haener, HERE.\n\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.\n\nRandy Bachman is the Canadian guitarist and songwriter behind a slew of hits with the bands The Guess Who and Bachman Turner Overdrive. Although he was based far from the '60s powerhouse music scenes of Laurel Canyon and Swinging London, Bachman first made a name for himself performing across the Great White North.\n\nOn todayâs episode Bruce Headlam talks to Randy who dissects his hits including âAmerican Womanâ and âThese Eyes.â He also explains how he became one of the great guitarists of his generation.\n\nYou can hear a playlist of some of our favorite Randy Bachman songs HERE.\n\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information."
