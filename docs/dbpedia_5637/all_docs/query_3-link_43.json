        "text": "Jerry Rubin, Abbie Hoffman (subjects)\n\nNew York: United Press International, 1970. Vintage photograph of activist Jerry Rubin hugging his wife Nancy, with activist Abbie Hoffman to the left, just after being released by a Federal Appeals Court on March 3, 1970. United Press International stamp and date stamp on the verso, along with a printed mimeo snipe.\n\nRubin and Hoffman, along with David Dellinger, Tom Hayden, Rennie Davis, John Froines, and Lee Weiner, were part of the Chicago Seven, a group tried for conspiracy related to antiwar and countercultural protests during the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Although each of the defendants was aligned with multiple left-wing and radical organizations, Rubin and Hoffman were best known as the founders of the Youth International Party (YIP, better known as the Yippies), an organization which used theatrical protest tactics to gain attention for antiauthoritarian causes.\n\n10 x 8 inches. Very Good plus, with light creasing on the corners.\n\n[Book #155641]"
