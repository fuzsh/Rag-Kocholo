        "text": "Stew Albert, a founding member of the Yippies, was a political activist, writer, journalist, and unindicted co-conspirator in the \"Chicago Seven\" case in 1968. Born in Brooklyn in 1939, he went to Cuba in 1960 with a friend. On the plane on the way there, he met and conversed with C. Wright Mills. He graduated from Pace University with a major in politics and philosophy and worked for the City of New York welfare department as a case worker. In 1965, he bought a bus ticket to San Francisco, where he visited City Lights Bookstore and met poet Allen Ginsberg. Moving to Berkeley, he began volunteering for the antiwar Vietnam Day Committee, where he met Jerry Rubin, Tom Hayden, and other social activists. A friend of Abbie Hoffman, Stew Albert participated in some of his well-publicized stunts, such as showering the New York Stock Exchange with $1 bills and attempting to exorcize the Pentagon.\n\nIn 1967, Stew Albert was a founding member of the Youth International Party, or Yippies. Other founding members included Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, and Paul Krassner. The Yippies were known for their use of political theater to protest the Vietnam war. They organized a \"Festival of Life\" for the 1968 Democratic National convention in Chicago, but were denied permits to hold the festival in Lincoln Park, where they had planned to gather. Stew and other Yippie members ran a counter-presidential campaign with their chosen candidate, an actual pig named Pigasus. Over the course of the week, violence escalated as the Chicago police attempted to drive the demonstrators out of Lincoln Park. In the ensuing violence, Stew Albert was clubbed in the head by police. He also covered the convention as a correspondent for the Berkeley Barb , an underground newspaper based in Berkeley. In the trial of the \"Chicago Eight\" (later the Chicago Seven), Stew Albert was listed as an unindicted co-conspirator for his role in the demonstrations.\n\n1968 was also the year Stew Albert met Judy Clavir (formerly Hemblen), a fellow activist. She was nicknamed Judy Gumbo by Eldridge Cleaver, a close friend of Stew, and the name stuck. Born in Canada, she was involved with the Yippies, Women's International Terrorist Conspiracy from Hell (W.I.T.C.H.), and the women's liberation movement. In 1971, she traveled to Vietnam with Nancy Kurshan, also a Yippie, and Jeannie Plamondon, who had ties to the White Panthers, to talk with the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet Nam.\n\nIn 1969, Stew Albert played a role in the creation of the People's Park in Berkeley in 1969, and the resulting protests. His involvement landed him in Alameda County Jail for two months, and he subsequently ran for sheriff of Alameda County. He lost, but received 65,000 votes and carried the city of Berkeley. He also helped to found the Free University in Berkeley.\n\nThrough his friendships with Black Panther members Eldridge Cleaver and Bobby Seale, Stew Albert served as a liaison between the Black Panther Party and the Yippies. In 1970, when Timothy Leary, the LSD advocate, had escaped from prison, Stew Albert escorted him to Algeria to introduce him to Eldridge Cleaver, who was living in exile there.\n\nAfter the Weather Underground bombed the U.S. Capitol in 1971 to protest the Vietnam War, the Alberts held a press conference and Judy Gumbo Albert declared, \"We didn't do it, but we dug it.\" In 1972, Stew Albert and Judy Gumbo took part in protests at the Republican National Convention in Miami. He also enlisted John Lennon and Yoko Ono in a \"Beatle/Yippie pact\" that nearly resulted in Lennon's deportation.\n\nAfter finding a homing device on their car, Stew and Judy filed suit against the FBI in 1975 for illegal surveillance. They discovered that the FBI had been monitoring them and searching their cabin in the Catskills, and won a $20,000 settlement. Stew Albert later became a private investigator, and helped others obtain government files kept on them through the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nStew Albert and Judy Gumbo Albert married in 1977. They had one daughter, Jessica Albert. Moving to Portland, Oregon, in 1984, they continued to be active in various causes. Judy Albert worked with Planned Parenthood, and Stew Albert was involved with the Oregon Jewish Agenda, the New Jewish Agenda, and Israel peace activism. They co-edited The Sixties Papers , a document-based history of the era that was published in 1984. Stew Albert also wrote a 2004 memoir, Who the Hell is Stew Albert? , which reflected upon his lifetime of involvement in various causes. In 2000, Stew Albert was a consultant to the film maker Robert Greenwald for the film Steal This Movie , based on the book Steal This Book by Abbie Hoffman. He ran a website, the Yippie Reading Room, and kept a weblog from 2002 until his death from liver cancer in 2006. Two days before his death, he posted, \"My politics have not changed.\"\n\nSources:"
