        "text": "“Will You Still Need Me When I’m 74?” will be the theme of peace activist Jerry Rubin’s public birthday celebration taking place Monday, December 11 on his 74th birthday. The activist-style birthday party will feature peace songs, political comedy, a “Dump Trump” cake-cutting ceremony, and an open microphone where activists can share what they are working on to help create a better future. The free-to-the-public event is being sponsored by the Activist Support Circle and will be held from 6:00pm until 8:00pm at the GasLite located at 2030 Wilshire Blvd., Santa Monica 90403. The GasLite is easily accessible and has free parking.\n\nRubin is a longtime peace and environmental activist and has organized hundreds of events and projects since he became involved in activism in 1979. He resides in Santa Monica with his wife Marissa and their two kitty cat kids Sunny and Polly.\n\nRubin is not related to the late 1960’s peace activist and Chicago 8 Conspiracy Trial defendant, although they had become friends.\n\nThe Activist Support Circle is a support group for progressive activists that Rubin started in 2005 to help guard against activist burnout.\n\nRubin also helped start a number of other local community groups and campaigns, including: Tree Hugging Friends, Friends of Chain Reaction, the No Toy Guns Campaign, and the Campaign to Save the Muir Woods Mural.\n\nRubin says no birthday gifts are necessary but a Starbucks gift card is always appreciated.\n\nRelated Posts\n\nFarmshop Now Serving Custom Unity Coffee Brews Alongside Their Renowned Pastries\n\nNew Coffee Offerings Include Big Sur Drip, Mojave Espresso, and Los Padres Decaf Farmshop has introduced a new coffee offering...\n\nHotel Bel-Air Introduces The Living Room and The Patisserie, Two New Culinary Destinations\n\nExperience Artisanal Pastries and Premium Caviar Service at the Hotel’s Newest Dining Spots Hotel Bel-Air has introduced two new culinary...\n\nJoin Montana Avenue’s Buena Vida Tea for a Midsummer Tarot Reading with Madam Loganza\n\nExtended Hours on Thursday Offer a Magical Afternoon of Tea, Pastries, Tarot Buena Vida Tea will host a special Midsummer...\n\nIndulge in Premium Wagyu Steaks at Maple Block Meat Company X Herd & Grace’s Steak and Martini Night\n\nSample Exclusive Cuts Like the Soon-To-Launch Robbins Island Wagyu Cowboy Steak This Friday Herd & Grace, the butcher shop with...\n\nMcDonald’s Hosts Exclusive ‘Collector’s Club Poolside Paradise’ at Santa Monica Pier\n\nCelebrate with Limited-Edition Collector’s Cups, Themed Cocktails, Beachside DJ Set McDonald’s is hosting the “Collector’s Club Poolside Paradise,” a summer...\n\nAs Mpox Numbers Rise, Officials Encourage Awareness, Vaccination\n\nBy Susan Payne Cases of mpox are increasing in LA County, and it is important for residents of Los Angeles...\n\n(Video) Well Marriage Helps Couples Find Their Way Back to Each Other\n\nThis marriage counseling center is changing how the therapeutic world handles relationships. @culvercitywlanews This marriage counseling center is changing how...\n\nCulver City Unveils Final General Plan and Zoning Code for Public Review\n\nKey Documents Available Online; Public Hearings Set for August 14 and 26 Culver City has released the Final General Plan,...\n\nRecent Earthquakes in Southern California Prompt Renewed Focus on Preparedness\n\nExperts Urge Use of My Shake App and Emergency Kits as Seismic Activity Increases Los Angeles has experienced two earthquakes...\n\nProtesters Shut Down 405 in Call for Ceasefire and End to U.S. Support for Israel’s Actions In Gaza\n\nNine IfNotNow Protesters Arrested During Morning Rush Hour Demonstration in West LA American Jews and allies associated with IfNotNow LA...\n\nAward-Winning Opera Singer and L.A.
