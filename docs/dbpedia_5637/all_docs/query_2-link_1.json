        "text": "Jerry Rubin (born July 14, 1938, Cincinnati, Ohio, U.S.—died November 28, 1994, Los Angeles, California, U.S.) was an American political activist turned businessman who gained his widest renown from the anti-Vietnam War protests during the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago and the subsequent Chicago Seven trial, in which—after one defendant was removed to be tried separately—he and six others were tried on charges of conspiracy to incite violence and crossing state lines with intent to riot. After a long trial punctuated with taunts and outbursts from the defendants, they were acquitted of conspiracy, but five were convicted of incitement, and all—plus their lawyers—were cited for contempt some 200 times. The convictions were later overturned.\n\nRubin attended Oberlin College in Ohio, graduated in 1961 from the University of Cincinnati, and studied at Hebrew University of Jerusalem before briefly attending the University of California at Berkeley. Radicalized by the Free Speech Movement and a trip to Cuba, he helped found the Youth International Party, better known as the Yippies, and was one of the leaders of the 1967 antiwar march on the Pentagon. During the 1968 election campaign, he staged acts of street theatre such as promoting the Yippie candidate for president—a pig named Pigasus."
