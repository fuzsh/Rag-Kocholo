Sometime in the mid-1970s Rubin reinvented himself as a businessman â¦ Rubin's new ambition was giving capitalists a social consciousness â¦ Near the end of his life, Rubin became interested in the science of life extensionâ, but died, at only at 56 year old, ran over by a car while crossing the road along the crosswalk."
