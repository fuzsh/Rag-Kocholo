        "text": "Jerry Rubin, the anti-war radical who once told his peers never to trust anyone over 30, died Monday night at UCLA Medical Center. He was 56.\n\nRubin _ an inveterate rule-breaker for most of his well-publicized life _ had been in intensive care since Nov. 14, when he was hit by a car while jaywalking. Hospital officials said the Yippie-turned-yuppie suffered a cardiac arrest about 7:45 p.m. and could not be revived.\n\n\"He was a great life force, full of spunk, courage and wit,\" said state Sen. Tom Hayden, a co-defendant in the Chicago Seven trial.\n\n\"I think his willingness to defy authority for constructive purposes will be missed,\" Hayden said. \"Up to the end, he was defying authority.\"\n\nBorn July 14, 1938, in Cincinnati to a union organizer and his wife, Rubin was a graduate student at the University of California Berkeley when the anti-Vietnam War movement carried him to fame.\n\nIn the late 1960s, he founded the Youth International Party, the Yippies, with the late Abbie Hoffman and Paul Krassner, and honed his reputation as a master of political theater. Once, to protest capitalism, he dumped dollar bills on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange; another time, he campaigned to elect a pig as president of the United States.\n\nDressed in his trademark guerrilla chic, he cut an increasingly famous figure. But his most memorable moment as a radical came in 1968, during anti-war demonstrations outside the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.\n\nBlack Panther leader Bobby Seale and seven others _ among them Rubin, Hoffman and Hayden _ were charged with conspiracy to incite violence and crossing state lines with the intent to riot.\n\nThe court proceedings began in September 1969, becoming known as the Chicago Seven trial after federal Judge Julius Hoffman severed Seale's case from the others and ordered him bound and gagged when he protested the crusty jurist's rulings. Seale eventually was convicted of contempt of court and sentenced to four years in prison.\n\nThe trial of the seven _ Rubin, Hoffman, Rennie Davis, David Dellinger, John Froines, Hayden and Lee Weiner _ became a dramatic spectacle during which the wild-haired defendants stomped on the judicial robes they elected to wear in the courtroom.\n\nAfter 4{ months of testimony, all but Froines and Weiner were found guilty of the intent-to-riot charges. All were acquitted of the conspiracy charges.\n\nAlthough Rubin, Hoffman, Davis, Dellinger and Hayden were sentenced to prison, their convictions _ along with Seale's _ were overturned by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which cited errors by Judge Hoffman and criticized his courtroom demeanor.\n\nWhile some of the Chicago Seven remained true to their Yippie roots, Rubin evolved, discovering est, yoga, bioenergetics and a smorgasbord of self-awareness programs that eventually led him to venture banking on Wall Street and the creation of a \"networking party\" for yuppies.\n\nTwenty years later, Rubin would say that he \"missed the sense of purpose, I miss the sense of righteous anger. . . . But I'm much healthier than I was then.\"\n\nRubin's evolution did not sit well with Hoffman, who squared off with him in a series of \"Yippie-versus-yuppie\" debates in the mid-1980s.\n\nBut by 1988, when he turned 50, Rubin had revised the credo by which an entire generation had once defined itself.\n\n\"I used to say, \"Don't trust anyone over 30,' \" he told a reporter at his birthday party. \"Now I say, \"Don't trust anyone under 50.' \"\n\nRubin continued to prosper, becoming an independent marketer for a Dallas-based company that sells a nutritional drink called Wow that contains kelp, ginseng and bee pollen. Bobby Seale became one of his salesmen.\n\nIn an earlier interview, Rubin estimated that he made $600,000 in 1992. In recent years, Rubin _ divorced from his wife of 13 years, Mimi Rubin _ had lived in a high-rise apartment in Brentwood. The couple had two children.\n\nWhere are they now?\n\nWhat happened to Jerry Rubin's fellow Chicago Seven defendants:\n\nAbbie Hoffman: Committed suicide in April 1989 at 52, using phenobarbital and alcohol. Had been the most politically involved Yippie leader. Rubin was the only member of the Chicago Seven to attend the funeral.\n\nRennie Davis: Right-wing capitalist and president of a Denver think tank that develops technologies for the environment. Briefly sold life insurance and dabbled in Hinduism.\n\nDavid Dellinger: Longtime pacifist lives off grant money and lecturing fees near Peacham, Vt. Regularly fasts in a protest to change the name of Columbus Day to Native American Day.\n\nJohn Froines: Director of the Occupational Health Center at the University of California, Los Angeles. Served in the Jimmy Carter administration as director of toxic substances for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.\n\nTom Hayden: California state senator and founder of Students for a Democratic Society, headed several environmental initiatives. Was married to actor Jane Fonda for 16 years; they divorced in 1990.\n\nLee Weiner: Works with a direct-mail firm in Washington for non-profit organizations and political clients. In membership development at the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith in New York. Participated in recent protests for AIDS research and Soviet Jews."
