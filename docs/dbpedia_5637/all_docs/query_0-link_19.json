However, the subpoena was cancelled after revelations that the federal government had eavesdropped on his telephone conversations. The revelations came out during an appeal of a conviction of Rubin for organizing the 1967 demonstration at the Pentagon.\n\t\n\tCommittee chair Richard Ichord (D-Mo.) agreed to hear Rubin’s testimony in open session if he would change his clothing. Rubin, however, refused to take off the suit.\n\t\n\tRubin gave various reasons for as the symbolism of the Santa Clause suit to reporters one of which was, “The fact that Big Brother has arrived is a threat to our children. How better dramatize it than wearing a Santa Clause suit?”\n\t\n\tHe also carried a toy gun that he told reporters was for “self-defense.”\n\t\n\tIchord said his hearings showed that “communists and revolutionaries” planned the 1968 demonstrations at the Chicago Democratic National Convention. \n\t\n\tWhile being called before a HUAC hearing once ruined careers in the 1950s, activists in the 1960s were openly contemptuous of the hearings and often looked upon a subpoena to appear before the committee as a badge of honor.\n\t\n\tRubin was an early opponent of the Vietnam War, running for mayor of Berkeley on an antiwar platform and helping organize the influential Vietnam Day Committee that attempted to stop troop trains.\n\t\n\tLater helping to organize the antiwar 1967 March on the Pentagon and 1968 demonstrations at the Democratic Convention, Rubin was indicted as one of the Chicago 8 defendants whose trial transfixed the country.
