        "text": "Fifty years ago, protests at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago thrust political activist and Cincinnati native Jerry Rubin into the national spotlight.\n\nOn Aug. 28, 1968, Chicago police using tear gas and batons clashed with anti-war protesters outside the convention while television cameras were rolling and demonstrators chanted, “The whole world is watching.”\n\nThe year 1968 was a tumultuous time. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy were assassinated. The unpopular Vietnam War raged on. Tensions boiled over.\n\nThe convention chaos doomed the Democrats and helped usher Richard Nixon to the White House.\n\nDemonstrators known as the Chicago Eight, including Rubin, were charged with conspiracy to incite the riots. The publicity made Rubin a celebrity.\n\nRubin had co-founded the Youth International Party, or Yippies, which were both satirical and theatrical.\n\nRubin once tossed dollar bills onto the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, nominated a pig named Pigasus for president, hung out with John Lennon and took over “The David Frost Show.”\n\nIn October 1968, Rubin appeared before the House Committee on Un-American Activities bare-chested, carrying a toy M-16 rifle and wearing a bandolier with live bullets.\n\n“Yippies are revolutionaries,” one of Rubin’s followers told The Enquirer’s Dennis Doherty in 1968. “We have merged New Left politics with a psychedelic lifestyle. Our lifestyle – acid, long hair, freaky clothes, pot, rock music, sex – is the Revolution. Our very existence mocks America. The old order is dying. The Democratic Party is dying. &mldr; We are the politics of the future.”\n\nThe man who espoused “don’t trust anyone over 30” was 30 himself in 1968.\n\nRubin was born in 1938 in Avondale, then a predominantly Jewish neighborhood. His father was a bakery truck driver and union organizer.\n\nHe attended Ach Junior High School, then Walnut Hills High School, where he edited the school newspaper, the Chatterbox.\n\n“When I graduated from Walnut Hills I had to get away. I hated Cincinnati,” Rubin told Doherty in a 1968 interview. “I didn’t hate any persons. I hated the provincialism, and the racism. &mldr; I was bored.”\n\nHe attended Oberlin College, then the University of Cincinnati, while he worked as a reporter at the Cincinnati Post and Times-Star.\n\nDoherty, who had worked with Rubin at the Post, described him in a 1994 Enquirer story as “one of the most energetic newsmen I ever met. &mldr; He was absolutely the prototypical Jimmy Olsen, always the white shirt and the bow tie.”\n\nRubin’s political opinions weren’t as conservative. He left to study at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, then the University of California, Berkeley, where he became a counterculture radical.\n\nIn April 1969, Rubin held a rally in Eden Park to counter a Teens for Decency event at Cincinnati Gardens. Wearing a Viet Cong flag as a cape, he told the crowd of nearly 2,000, “What we want is total and complete revolution.” Then he took a collection to help pay his legal bills.\n\nThe trial of the Chicago Eight was a circus. Yippies Rubin and Abbie Hoffman openly mocked the court and were found in contempt. Rubin spent two months in jail, but the convictions were overturned.\n\nAs he aged out of radicalism, Rubin turned to self-help in the 1970s and became a Wall Street capitalist in the 1980s.\n\nRubin spoke at his alma mater in 1994, but the Walnut Hills students hoping to meet a 1960s radical got a 1990s businessman selling vitamin drink powder.\n\nHe died a few months later after being hit by a car while jaywalking across Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles."
