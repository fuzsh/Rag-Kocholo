INTRODUCTION Public awareness of dams is commonly rooted in the image of highly engineered, large concrete structures, impounding vast quantities of water. Structures such as these automatically bring to mind the great forces they contain, and the disastrous consequences that will occur should they fail. Most of these large dams were designed for the purpose of hydropower, water supply, and/or flood control, and were either built by agencies of the federal government or regulated by a federal agency. Some of the larger dams in Virginia include Smith Mountain Lake Dam, Lake Anna Dam, and Philpott Dam. This regulatory scrutiny, beginning with design and construction, and on through the design life of these types of structures provides a high level of confidence in their integrity and safety. However, in the past not all dams were reviewed and inspected. The National Dam Safety Program was authorized by Congress in 1972 and the purpose of the program was to inventory and inspect dams throughout the United States. It was not until 1977 that the program was supported with significant funding. This renewed interest in dam safety came about after the occurrence of several significant dam failures in the 19701s. These failures included the failure of Teton Dam, a newly constructed 305 foot high federally design and built dam, but there were also failures of much smaller dams causing significant damage and loss of life. The Virginia Dam Safety Program was initially developed with the Army Corps of Engineers as part of the national program from 1977 through 1981. After this initial set up, the dam safety program became the responsibility of the Commonwealth. In Virginia, dams are governed under the \"Virginia Dam Safety Act\" and the \"Impounding Structure Regulations\" (Appendix C) . The dam safety program is administered by the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation's Division of Soil and Water Conservation. Regulated dams, or \"impounding structures\", in Virginia are those structures which are 11 ... equal to or greater than 25 feet in height and which create a maximum impoundment equal to or greater than 50 acre-feet ... 11. Dams which are not regulated included dams which are owned or licensed by the federal government and those dams which are less than 25 feet in height or that impound less than 50 acre-feet. Most unregulated dams do not pose serious problems to public health and safety, or property when they fail. Typically, significant damage is limited to the dam owner with the loss of the dam and the lake. While the unregulated dams are not very high and do not impound a great deal of water, recent experience has demonstrated that the failure of unregulated dams have caused significant problems and damage. I On July 1990, the Cockram Mill Dam in Patrick County failed under the pressures of rising flood waters. The 57 year old mill dam impounded 150 acre-feet of water, but it's height of 20 feet was 5 feet under the state threshold for regulation. The Cockram Mill Dam failure resulted in 11 ... channel erosion, uprooted trees, debris pile-ups, uprooted road signs, mud flats, damaged lawn furniture, and some structural damage to the adjacent mill house. This dam failure left behind large concrete debris and a 20 acre mud flat that was once a full reservoirll.-@ In March 1993, after a week of significant spring rains, there were two dam failures in Central Virginia investigated by DCR personnel. In Powhatan County, storm flows through a poorly maintained emergency spillway caused the spillway to erode back to the lake. This in turn, caused a sudden drawdown of the lake which lead to an upstream embankment slope failure. While not a complete failure, preliminary estimates to repair this dam are between $200,000 and $250,000. In Chesterfield County, a masonry dam failed completely when the pressure of the water overtopping the dam exceeded the structural capacity of the dam. The owner has not rebuilt the dam because of financial constraints. In June 1993, while field work for this study was in progress, DCR personnel investigated the failure of Haynes Mill Pond Dam in Gloucester County. This failure was probably the result of improper improvements to the spillway. This failure undermined the support structure of the Route 614 bridge immediately adjacent to the spillway and this caused the road span to collapse. Fortunately no accidents occurred, but traffic was rerouted for over a week and the repairs to the roadway totalled over $90,400. Dams and the water they impound support numerous beneficial uses which are often not fully recognized or utilized. Dams are always constructed initially with some beneficial use in mind. Many older dams were designed to impound water to drive mills to process grain and, while they no longer serve this purpose they have the potential to support other uses. Other uses include agricultural water for livestock and irrigation, wash water for sand and gravel processes, fire suppression, erosion and sediment control, flood control, and recreation. Many dams and their lakes could be better utilized for the public good. 'Gregory B. Secrist, \"The Failure of the Cockram Mill Dam,\" VLA NEWS, Issue No. 16, Winter 1991, p.l. 2 Il. STUDY PURPOSE Recent dam failures in other parts of the Virginia alerted Richmond's local officials to the need for more basic information on unregulated dams. Members of the RRPDC's Regional Environmental Committee from Charles City and New Kent requested RRPDC staff conduct a study of unregulated dams in their localities (Map 1). RRPDC staff applied for and received funding for this project under the Virginia Coastal Resources Management Program f rom the Virginia Council on the Environment (now absorbed into the Department of Environmental Quality, DEQ). The purpose of this study is to inventory and assess the condition of unregulated dams in Charles City and New Kent Counties, to provide a preliminary data base of information on unregulated dams in the counties, to identify issues related to the management, safety, and use of these structures, and to recommend alternatives to address these issues on a local, regional, and state level. Most Virginia localities lack the basic information necessary to understand the scope of potential benefits, problems and hazards related to unregulated dams. In 1981 the \"Inventory of Dams\" for the Commonwealth prepared by the Army Corps of Engineers and the Virginia Water Control ]Board (now the Water Division of the Department of Environmental Quality) was completed. This inventory listed approximately 1, 500 dams in Virginia. Approximately a third of the dams identified in this inventory are regulated under the Commonwealth's current program. In Charles City, two dams were identified in this inventory, neither were of a size to be regulated. In New Kent 11 dams are listed on this inventory, and only one of which is regulated. Furthermore, the lower threshold for dam size utilized to develop the Corps/VWCB inventory meant that many other \"small\" dams were never included in the inventory. Localities need better basic information than what is currently available to understand any potential problems. while the Department of Conservation and Recreation has no regulatory authority over these smaller structures, the Department's Dam Safety Section elected to participate in this study in order to update the inventory and more importantly to evaluate potential dam safety problems and the magnitude of potential hazards in these counties. The needs of the owners of unregulated dams is also a concern. The dam owner is liable for any damage or destruction of life and property caused by a dam failure. The owner will also loose the use of the impounded water and may experience a potentially serious loss of income. Furthermore, the cost of replacing the dam can be extreme compared to the cost of proper care and maintenance. Dam owners can benefit from basic information on liability issues, proper dam design and construction methods, and basic operation and 3 maintenance procedures. The study was performed by Richmond Regional Planning District Commission (RRPDC) staff with technical guidance of staff from the Department of Conservation and Recreation's (DCR) Dam Safety Section and the assistance of Charles City and New Kent personnel. 4 I I *STUDY AREA MAP* I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I 1 5 1 IV. INVENTORY CHARLES CITY COUNTY Data f or Charles City County was developed f rom reviews of USGS 7.5 minute topographic maps, USDA Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service aerial photographs, and field inspections. USGS map coverage includes the quad sheets of Roxbury, Providence Forge, Walkers, Hopewell, Westover, Charles City, Brandon, and Claremont. This section describes the data developed for the study. County Description Charles City County is located in Virginia's coastal plain physiographic region. This rural locality is relatively flat in the east with gently rising elevations in the central and west central sections of the County. Elevations range from sea level to 150 feet above sea level. Some steep slopes can be found scattered throughout the County. Charles City is bordered on the south by the James River which is tidal along this reach. The Chickahominy River makes up the County's eastern and northern boundary. The Chickahominy is tidal up to Walkers Dam which blocks any further tidal influence upstream. Domestic, commercial and industrial water demand for the County is met through groundwater sources. The County operates two water wells and associated distribution systems. Soils in the County are typically composed of silts, sands and clays originating from marine and alluvial deposits. The County is mostly forested with agricultural activity found primarily in it's southern half. Small community centers are scattered throughout the County and industrial development is located near Roxbury, a community in the County's northwest. The County's 1991 population was approximately 6,3 002. Inventory Data In Charles City County there are two dams listed in the original 1981 inventory, but these structures are not subject to regulation. An additional dam on the county line between Henrico County and Charles City County is also listed in the 1981 inventory and this dam was included in this study. Initially, a total of sixty-three impoundments were identified in Charles City County, including the three noted above. Of those sixty-three, 33 were included in this study and inventory because they impounded a lake surface area of significant size.

INVENTORY PROCEDURE An inventory of potential dam sites was developed by identifying impoundments shown on United States Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5 minute topographic maps. Recent aerial photographs of the counties provided by the United States Department Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service were examined for potential sites not shown on the USGS topographic maps. It was determined that the number of all potential dam sites noted on the maps and photographs was too numerous to be field inspected within the time frame of the study. Based on the best professional judgement of the DCR Dam Safety Section it was decided that the smallest impoundments (lake surface area of approximately 5 acres or less) would not be inventoried nor field surveyed. A dam inspection checklist (Appendix A) was developed by DCR staff for the field survey. The checklist was not a detailed inspection form but was developed to be used to assess the general condition of the dam including the embankment, principal spillway, emergency spillway, downstream channel, reservoir area, watershed area, and downstream area. Basic dimensions of the structure were estimated, and if available any dam history noted. Three days were spent in each county conducting field surveys of the dams identified using the maps and aerial photography during the months of June and July 1993. For a variety of reasons, not all identified impoundments were surveyed. Some access roads were barred to vehicular traffic with locked gates and chains while others were located far back in densely wooded areas with no apparent access road. Some identified impoundments were the result of beaver activity and were dropped from the study. Inventory and inspection data were then compiled and evaluated as a basis to identify issues related to the Counties unregulated dams. 6 included in the inventory were determined to be very small with a lake surface area of less than 5 acres, and based upon the topographic mapping and aerial photography did not appear to pose a significant hazard to life or property downstream. Impoundments that. were the result of beaver activity were also not included in the inventory. Of the thirty-three inventoried impoundments, the inspection team was able to access fifteen. A total of eighteen is included in Table 1 under-the category of \"Dams Inspected\" since three were on the 1981 inventory. Three of these 18 dams had been breached and two of the 3 rebuilt. The third breached dam is included in the inventory as the remains of the dam might possibly be repaired. Table 1 contains the inventory data developed for this study.

USGS map coverage includes the quads sheets of Quinton, Tunstall, New Kent, West Point, Roxbury, Providence Forge, Walkers, and Toano. This section describes the study data.developed for New Kent County. County Description Like Charles City County to the south, New Kent County lies within the coastal plain physiographic region of central Virginia. The County is relatively flat with gradually rising and falling terrain. Some steep slopes are variously scattered throughout the County. Elevations vary from sea level to 160 feet above sea level. The County's southern boundary is formed by the Chickahominy River and it's northern boundary by the York and Pamunkey Rivers. The County's eastern boundary runs along Ware Creek and the Diascund Reservoir, while it's western border is not defined by a discernable natural feature. The York and Pamunkey Rivers are tidal in New Kent. The Chickahominy is tidal to Walkers Dam, which blocks further tidal action upstream. The Diascund Reservoir is a manmade 2.1 square mile body of water that provides pump over storage of raw water from the Chickahominy River at Walkers Dam. The reservoir is owned and operated by the Newport News Waterworks as a raw water source for Newport News. For New Kent County the water supply for domestic, commercial and industrial use is met through groundwater supply. 10 The County owns a number of wells, and several residential developments are served by private central groundwater systems. Soils in the County are derived from a marine and alluvial deposits and are typically composed of sands, silts, and clays. The County is mostly forested with extensive agricultural production occurring along the Pamunkey River corridor to the north. Small communities are variously scattered throughout the County, with the county seat is located at New Kent Court House. New Kent's 1991 population was approximately 10,9003. Inventory Data In New Kent County there are eleven dams listed on the original 1981 inventory. Of these eleven dams, only Diascund Dam noted above is regulated by the Commonwealth. Including these eleven, there were 83 impoundments in New Kent as identified from both USGS quad sheets and ASCS aerial photographs. Impoundments that were the result of beaver activity were not included in this inventory. Of the eighty-three identified, 39 were inventoried for this project. The remaining forty-four were determined to be too small to be inventoried and did not appear to pose a threat to life or property downstream. of the thirty-nine inventoried dams, 25 of the dams were accessible for inspection. Table 3 contains the inventory data developed for New Kent County. Map 3 displays the location of the inventoried and inspected dams in New Kent County. For the twenty-five dams that are listed above as inspected their present and/or former uses were determined. Eleven dams were apparently used for milling operations, although none are presently used for that purpose. Four dams were used primarily used for agricultural purposes, watering livestock and crops. Two dams had dry hydrants installed for the purpose of providing water for fire suppression, twenty-one were apparently used for recreation and habitat. of these twenty-five dams, 5 had state maintained roads over them.

The inspections allowed a close up look at the design, construction, general structural condition, maintenance practices, and use of each dam. In general, the following conditions were the most consistently observed by the inspection team. Tree growth on the top and downstream side of the embankment. Tree growth will undermine the structural integrity of the dam by creating channels for water seepage through the root system, especially when the tree dies and the root system decays. Also, trees that are uprooted will take with it a large amount of soil integrated in the root mass leaving a large hole in the embankment. 0. Lack of an emergency spillway, or an inadequate emergency spillway. This can result in dam failure when the structure is overtopped during flood events causing severe erosion, or through the unrelieved buildup of water pressure greater than the dam can tolerate. 0. Erosion in the receiving stream around the outlet pipe. This condition can result in the collapse and failure of the outlet pipe, the undermining of the dam base, and contributes to sediment loading of the receiving stream during storm events. P. Debris such as logs, sticks, and leaves that clog the principal spillway. Debris can partially or completely restrict the flow of water resulting in overtopping of the structure. 0@ Steep embankment slopes. Steep slopes can prohibit the use of equipment used to maintain or repair the dam structure. 0. Gates and valves at the principal spillway that have not been maintained or checked for operation. Gates and valves can fail through lack of maintenance or through nonuse. Inoperable emergency valves can result in dam failure during flood events, and can prohibit maintenance and repair operations requiring drawdown of the pool elevation. A dam inspection checklist (Appendix A) was completed for each dam visited. A site visit summary for each dam inspected in Charles City County is included in Appendix B, and for New Kent County in Appendix C. 14 VI. ISSUE IDENTIFICATION Unregulated dams present a variety of concerns to local governments and dam owners involving issues of management, construction, and operation and maintenance. Local governments have a vested interest in ensuring that unregulated dams do not pose a threat to public and private property, life and health. Dam owners are interested in protecting investments, and either minimizing potential liability or insuring themselves against it. The following section identifies issues of concern to all local governments and to dam owners. REGULATORY PROGRAMS The management, design, construction, operation, and maintenance of dams are addressed principally through the state regulatory programs, and/or through local programs. The following section briefly describes current state and local dam programs. Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation Virginia Dam Safety Act Dams in Virginia are regulated by the Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR), Bureau of Rivers and Shorelines, through the \"Impounding Structure Regulations\" of the Dam Safety Act, Article 2, Chapter 6, Title 10.1 of the Code of Virginia (Appendix D). Briefly, \"Impounding Structure Regulations\" (VR 625-01-00, Feb. 1, 1989) provide a permitting process for the construction, alteration, and transfer of regulated structures, and certification for dam operation and maintenance. The regulations include procedures for inspections, enforcement, and complaints; grants the right of a hearing to an aggrieved dam owner, and defines procedures for consulting boards and dams in unsafe conditions. The regulations define design requirements for the dam structure, emergency spillway, principal spillway and outlet works, drain requirements, life of structure, plans and specifications, acceptable design procedures, and additional requirements. DCR concentrates it's efforts on regulated impounding structures, that is, dams that are greater than 25 feet in height and that impound an area of greater than 50 acre-feet. Budget and manpower limitations leave little time for other activities. Chesapeake Bay Local Assistance Department Chesalpeake Bay Preservation Act The Chesapeake Bay Local Assistance Department (CBLAD) is responsible for the overall administration of the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act (CBPA) . CBPA grants authority for administration of the Act to local governments. CBPA requires the designation of preservation areas, called Resource Protection Areas (RPA) and Resource Management 15 Areas (RMA) Preservation areas are composed of RPA's, surrounded by a onehundred foot \"buffer area\", surrounded by an RMA. CBPA regulations generally prohibit the construction of dams in RPA's and their buffer area, although in certain situations exemptions may be granted. Dams are permitted in RMA's if they meet regulatory criteria designed to maintain water quality. Local Code New Kent Co unty Currently, New Kent County's Code permits water impoundments of fifty acres or more and a dam height of twenty-five feet or more. Such structures require a conditional use permit issued by the County. Impoundments less than 50 acres or with a dam height less than 25 feet are not permitted in the County. The County historically has not enforced this ordinance, and recently developed a revised draft ordinance that allows, \"Water impoundments for public or private use. 11 Water impoundments will require a conditional use permit issued by the County. It is expected the County will adopt this ordinance by the end of 1993. Neither the current ordinance or the proposed draft ordinance specifically address unregulated dams. Charles City County Charles City County code contains no statutes that directly address the development of dams. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE Unregulated dam owners, and those people wishing to construct dams that fall outside of State regulation, may find it difficult to obtain public sector technical assistance. Upon request, DCR staff will review design specifications for proposed structures that are not covered under the State regulatory program. DCR staff will also investigate unregulated dam failures. But these activities can only be performed as time permits and is not a formal agency program function. The Department of Conservation and Recreation published a pamphlet titled, \"Safety Evaluation of Small Earth Dams\", 2nd Edition, 1987, that is currently out of print. This informative publication is designed to assist dams owners in inspecting their dams and maintaining them in sound condition. The 2nd edition of the pamphlet requires revision before it is re-released to the public. No date has been set for this revision. A copy of the 2nd edition is included in Appendix E. The U.S. Soil Conservation Service has ceased the practice of providing technical assistance to farmers on the design, construction, and maintenance of dams. This practice was discontinued as a result of liability issues associated with past failures of these structures. 16 Currently, persons seeking technical assistance on the design, construction, and operation and maintenance of unregulated dams have the option of private sector assistance, or their own best judgement. 17 VII. CONCLUSIONS After a review of the data developed from the inventory and inspections, and an assessment of identified issues, the study team drew the following observations and conclusions: 1. The number of unregulated dams in Charles City and New Kent far exceeds those that are regulated; 146 to 1. This alone underscores the need for local attention. 2. The great majority of dams do not pose a threat to life or property downstream either because they are structurally sound; they do not impound a volume of water large enough to cause significant damage if the dam fails; or, there are no hazards such as homes or other structures, or property downstream that would be threatened by a breach. 3. Privately owned dams that serve as a base for public roads pose a high potential hazard to vehicular traffic. 4. In general, the most common problem s observed with inspected dams involve the growth of trees and bushes on the dam's top and downstream slopes, and the lack of an emergency spillway. Unwanted growth is relatively easy to prevent through regularly scheduled mowing. Emergency spillways are easily incorporated into the design of a dam, and may be retrofitted on some existing structures. 5. Dam owners would benefit from information about dam maintenance and repair, and individuals considering constructing a dam would benefit from technical guidance on new dam construction. 6. There are many dams that have the potential to support beneficial uses that could serve the public. 7. Localities can benefit from tracking unregulated dams and sharing information with staff from DCR's Bureau of Rivers and Shorelines. 18 VIII. RECOMMENDATIONS Based on the conclusions above, the study team makes the following recommendations for consideration by local officials in Charles City and New Kent. 1. Utilize the data base developed and maintained by the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation to track unregulated dams in the Counties. A copy of the data base has been provided to Charles City and New Kent County staffs. 2. Develop a mechanism to keep the data base current through the addition of information on new dams. 00. New Kent County could require this information when issuing conditional use permits for dam construction. P. Charles City should consider developing a program to track new dam construction that will add to the base of information on dams in the County. 3. To meet the information needs of dam owners and public officials, it is recommended that Charles City and New Kent copy and distribute the DCR publication, Safety Evaluation of Small Earth Dams, Information Bulletin 549, 2nd Edition, 1987. This information bulletin can be found in Appendix E, and contains valuable information on dam construction, maintenance, inspection, and other resource publications. Although the bulletin is currently out of print and requires minor revision, DCR staff encourages its use, and suggests that localities make copies as needed for public distribution. 4. It is recommended that DCR revise and reprint the information bulletin, Safety Evaluation of Small Earth Dams, as a service to dam owners and local officials. 5. It is recommended that the Charles City and New Kent consider potential beneficial uses of existing dams and their impoundments in relation to identified public needs. Two such uses include fire suppression and public recreational amenities such as swimming, boating, fishing, sunbathing, and picnicking. 19 I I I I APPENDIX A .I I DAM INSPECTION CHECKLIST I I I I I I I I I I I I I I FIELD OBSERVATIONS DAM NAME: COUNTY: COORDINATES: LAT.

Chapter6, Title 10.1 (�10.1 -604 et seq.) of the Codeof Virginia 1.2 GENERAL PROVISIONS A. This regulation provides for the proper and safe design, construction. operation and maintenance of impounding structures to protect public safety. This regulation shall not be construed or interpreted to relieve the owner or operator of any impoundment or impounding structure of any legal duties, obligations or liabilities incident to ownership, design, construction, operation or maintenance. B. Approval by@the board of proposals for an impounding structure shall in no manner be construed Or interpreted as approval to capture or store waters. For information concerning approval to capture or store waters,see Chapter 8 � 62.1-107) of Title 62.1 of the Code of Virginia, and other provisions of law as may be applicable. C. In promulgating this regulation, the board recognizes that no impounding structure can ever be completely \"fail-safe,\" because of incomplete understanding of or uncertainties associated with natural (earthquakes and floods) and manmade (sabotage) destructive forces; with material behavior and response to those forces; and with quality control during construction. D. Any engineering analysis required by this regulation such as plans, specifications, hydrology, hydraulics and inspections shall be conducted by and bear the seal of a professional engineer licensed to practice in Virginia. E. The official forms as called for by this regulation are available from the director. 1.3 DEFINITIONS The following words and terms, when used in.this regulation, shall have the following meaning, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise: \"Acre-foot\" means a unit of volume equal to 43,560 cubic feet or 325,853 gallons (one foot of depth over one acre of area). \"Agricultural purpose dams\" mean dams which are less than 25 feet in height or which create a maximum mpoundment smaller than 100 acre-feet and certified by the owner on official forms as constructed, maintained or operated primarily for agricultural purposes. \"Afteration permir'means apermit required forchangesto an impounding structurethat could afteror affect its stnuctural integrity. Afterations requiring a permit include, but are not limited to: changing the height, increasing the normal pool or principal spillway elevation, changing.the elevation or physical dimensions of the emergency spillway or rernoving the impounding structure. \"Board\" means the Virginia Soil and Water Conservation Board. \"Conditional operation arid maintenance certificate\" means a certificate required for impounding structures with deficiencies. \"Construction permit\" means a permit required for the construction of a new impounding structure. \"Design flood\" means the calculated volume of runoff and the resulting peak discharge utilized in the evaluation, design, construction, operation and maintenance of the impounding structure. \"Design freeboard\" means the vertical distance between the maximum elevation of the design flood and the top of the impounding structure. \"Director\" means the Director of the Department of Conservation and Historic Resources or his designee. \"Height\" means the structural height of an impounding structure. If the impounding structure spans a stream or watercourse, height means the vertical distance from the natural bed of thestrearn or watercourse measured at the downstream toe of the impounding structure to the top of the impounding structure. If the impounding structure does riot span a stream or watercourse, height means the vertical distance from the lowest elevation of the outside limit of the barrier to the top of the impounding structure. \"Impounding structure\" means a manmade device. whether a dam across a watercourse or other structure outside a watercourse, used or to be used to retain or store waters or other materials. The term \"impounding structure\" includes all dams which.are equal to or greater than 25 feet in height and which create a maximum impoundment equal to or greater than So acre-feet, except (i) dams licensed by the State Corporation Commission that are subject to a dam safety inspection program; (ii) dams owned or licensed by the United States government; (iii) dams constructed, maintained or operated primarily for agricultural PAGE I TABLE I Class Hazard Potential Spillway of If Impounding SIZE CLASSIFICATION Design b Dam Structure Fails Maximum Capacity(Ac-Ft)\" Height (Ft)s Flood(SDF) I Probable Loss of Large > 50,000 > 100 PMFO Life;Excessive Medium > 1,000 & < 50,000 > 40 & < 100 PMF Economic Loss Small > 50 & < 1,000 > 25 & < 40 1/2 PMF to PMF 11 Possible Loss of Large > 50,000 > 100 PMF Life; Appreciable Medium > 1,000 & < 50,000 > 40 & < 100 1/2 PMF to PMF Economic Loss Small > 50 & < 1,000 > 25 & < 40 100-YR to 1/2 PMF III No Loss of Life Large > 50,000 > 100 1/2 PMF to PMF Expected; Minimal Medium > 1,000 & < 50,000 > 40 & < 100 1 00-YR to 1/2 PM F Economic Loss Small > 50 & < 1,000 > 25 & < 40 50-YR d to 1 00-YRe IV No Loss of Life > 50 (non-agricuftural) > 25 (both) 50-YR to 100-YR Expected; No\" Economic Loss > 100 (agricultural) to Others a. The factor determining the largest size classification shall govern. b. The spillway design flood (SOF) represents the largest flood that need be coinsidered in the evalu- ation of the performance for a given project. The impounding structure shall perform so as to safely pass* the appropriate SDF. Where a range of SDF is indicated, the magnitude that most closely relates to the involve'd risk should be selected. The establishment in this regulation of rigid design flood criteria or standards is not intended. Safety rrxist be evaluated in the light of peculiarities and local conditions for each impounding structure and in recognition of the many factors involved, some of which may not be precisely known. Such can only be done by competent, experienced engineering judgement, which the values in Table 1 are intended to supplement, not supplant. c. PMF: Probable Maxirnum Rood. This means the flood that might be expected from'the most severe combination of critical meteorologic and hydrologic conditions that are reasonably possible in the region. The PMF is derived from the current probable maximum precipitation (PMP) available from the National Weather Service, NOAA. In some cases local topography or meteorological conditions will cause changes from the generalized PMP values, therefore, it is advisable to contact local, state or federal agencies to obtain the prevailing practice in specific cases. d. 50-Yr: 50-Year Flood. This means the flood magnitude expected to be equaled or exceeded on the average of once in 50 years. It may also be expressed as an exceedence probability with a 2 percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. e. 1 00-Yr: 1 00-Year Flood. This means the flood magnitude expected to be equaled or exceeded on the average of once in 100 years. It may also be expressed as an exceedence probability with a 1 percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. PAGE 3 the particular impounding structure and specific site conditions, including when required by the director, a plan and profile of the inundation zones. 12.

Many existing impoundment structures were designed and constructed priorto the enactment of the Dam Safety Act, and may not satisfy current criteria for new construction. The board may issue an operation and maintenance certificate for such structures provided that: 1. Operation and maintenance is determined by the director to be satisfactory and up to date; 2. Annual owner's inspection reports have been filed with and are considered satisfactory by the director; 3. The applicant proves in accordance with the current design procedures and references of section 5.9 to the satisfaction of the board that the impounding structure as designed, constructed, operated and maintained does not pose an unreasonable hazard to life and property; and 4. The owner satisfies all special requirements imposed by the board. B. When appropriate with existing impounding structures only. the spillway design flood requirement may be reduced by the board to the spillway discharge at which dam failure will not significantly increase the downstream hazard existing just prior to dam failure provided that the conditions of section 3.4.A of these regulations have been met. PAGE 7 4.3 ENFORCEMENT Any owner refusing to obey any order of the board or the director pursuant to this regulation may be compelled to obey and comply with such provisions by injunction or other appropriate remedy obtained in a court proceeding. Such proceeding shall be instituted by the board or in the case of an emergency, by the director in the court which granted approval to the owner to impound waters or, if such approval has not been granted, the proceeding shall be instituted in any appropriate court. 4.4 CONSULTING BOARDS ' A. When the board needs to satisfy questions of safety regarding plans and specifications, construc- tion oroperation and maintenance orwhen requested bythe ownerthe board may appoint a consulting board to report to it with respect to those questions of the safety of an impounding structure. Such a board shall consist of two or more consultants, none of whom have been associated with the impounding structure. B. The costs and expenses incurred by the consulting board, if appointed at the request of an owner, shall be paid by the owner. C. The costs and expenses incurred by the consulting board, if initiated by the board; shall be paid by the board. 4.5 UNSAFE CONDITIONS A. No owner shall have the right to maintain an impounding structure which unreasonably threatens the life or property of another person. Theownerof any impounding structure found to have deficiencies which could threaten life or property if uncorrected shall take the corrective actions needed to remove such deficiencies within a reasonable period of time. B. Imminent danger. When the director finds that an impounding structure is unsafe and constitutes an imminent danger to life or property, he shall immediately notify the state Department of Emergency Services and confer with the owner. The owner of an impounding structure found to constitute an imminent danger to life or property shall take invnediate corrective action to remove the imminent danger as required by of section 10. 1 -608 of the Code of Virginia. C. Non-imminent danger. The owner of an impounding structure who has been issued a report by the director containing findings and recommendations for the correction of deficiencies which threaten life or property if not corrected, shall undertake to implement the recommendations for correction of deficiencies according to a scheduleof implementation contained in that report as required by section 10.1 -609of the Code of Virginia. 4.6 COMPLAINTS A. Upon receipt of a complaint alleging that the person or property of the. complainant is endangered by the construction, maintenance or operation of impounding structure, the director shall cause an inspection of the structure, unless the data, records and inspection reports on file with the board are found adequate to determine if the complaint is valid. B. If the director finds that an unsafe condition exists, the director shall proceed under the provisions of sections 10.1 -608 and 10.1 -609 of the Code of Virginia to render the extant condition safe. CHAPTER FIVE - DESIGN REQUIREMENTS 5.1 DESIGN OF STRUCTURES A. The owner shall complete all necessary investigations prior to submitting the design report. The scope and degree of precision required is a matter of engineering judgement based on the complexities of the site and the hazard potential classification of the proposed structure. B. Surveys shall be made with sufficient accuracy to locate the proposed construction site and to define the total volume of storage in the impoundment. Locations of center lines and other horizontal and vertical controls shall be shown on a map of the site.

The National Dam Safety Program, instituted in response to several major dam failures in the early 1970's, focused on the problem nationwide. Under this program the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Virginia State Water Control Board worked together to inspect many dams in the Commonwealth and to lay the groundwork for eventual state responsibility for this activity. This responsiblity was accepted on October 1, 1981, at the conclusion of the National Dam Safety Program. On July 1, 1986, the Dam Safety Program was transferred to the Division of Soil and Water Conservation of the Department of Conservation and Historic Resources. The assistance and training provided by the Corps over the four year period of the National Dam Safety Program is reflected extensively in this publication. Additional opportunities for the training of state personnel in this area of expertise have been provided by the Soil Conservation Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the University of Virginia School of Engineering and Applied Science. Other states have freely shared their experience in this area, as well as their publications. Those of the Kentucky Department for Natural Resources and Environment Protection have been particularly useful. The members of the Dam Safety Advisory Committee, serving at the request of the Virginia State Water Control Board, have given generously of their time and wisdom to provide guidance in establishing an appropriate role and level of activity for this agency's Dam Safety Section. The cooperation of the owners of dams within the Commonwealth is of course essential to the success of the State's dam safety effort. The agreeable and helpful response of most of the owners, both public and private, with which this agency has. come in contact in the course of its dam safety activities has been most gratifying. The ultimate purpose of such a program is the protection of the lives and property of citizens of the Commonwealth, and the ready acceptance of this goal by the majority of the wide range of individuals and groups bearing the responsibility for the safety of dams is very much appreciated. iv FOREWORD This pamphlet presents a basic discussion of how to evaluate the safety of a small earth dam. Its intent is to inform the dam owner or operator of general aspects of preventive maintenance that he should be aware of and enable him to recognize certain unsafe conditions that may be associated with such structures. Once unsafe conditions are recognized, professional services may be obtained to assess the problem and to take appropriate remedial action. The Division of Soil and Water Conservation cannot provide consulting engineering services, but it does maintain a list of private firms that have performed this in the state. This brief discussion provides general guidance on some of the more common problems, but it is not intended to cover every type of condition, situation, or emergency that could possibly cause a dam to become unsafe or fail. It should be noted that the condition of a dam depends on many internal and external conditions that may be constantly changing, causing the overall health of the dam to evolve over time. It is incorrect and unwise to assume that the conditions of a dam at any given time will continueto represent itscondition at some time in the future. Only through continued care and evaluation can there be a reasonable chance that unsafe conditions will be detected. The design of an earth dam is the task of an experienced professioani engineer. Likewise the implementation of major remedial measuresfora dam generally requires a consultant. The application of trial-and-error \"home remedies\" to dam problems is not recommended, and such an approach will likely prove to be far more costly than obtaining and acting on professional guidance. Thetextand p lates of this pamphletare not intended to serve as a design guide either for the construction of new dams or for extensive remedial measures for existing dams. Rather they are intended to serve as a source of information which the owner can use in his regular maintenance and inspection activities and as a general guide as to when professional services are needed to insure the safety of a dam. V INTRODUCTION This pamphlet was written to assist you in inspecting your dam and maintaining it in a safe and stable condition. The focus of any dam safety effort is, of course, safety: the protection of lives and property in the area downstream from the impoundment. Every owner should be aware of the potential hazard that his dam might pose to the down- stream area and of the need to properly maintain the dam in such a way as to reduce this hazard as much as possible. The liability for damages resulting from a dam failure rests with the owner of the dam. A good inspection and maintenance program is important. Your dam represents a considerable investment. Replacement costs would be high. Loss of the dam would probably mean the loss of a water source, recreational facility, flood protection, or other assets. Dams are products of our technology and, like automobiles, provide us with many benefits. Like autos, however, they may not be thoroughly understood by persons who own them. Consequently, their maintenance is often neglected, and their potential for doing great harm and damage-and costing large amounts of money as a result-is often not appreciated until an accident occurs. As is the case with buildings, highways, and other works that we construct, dams re- quire an on-going maintenance program to insure their continued useful life. This fact has not always been fully appreciated. Often there is a tendency to neglect them once construction is completed. There are many ways an earth dam can fail. These include but are not limited to sliding, piping (internal erosion of soil particles from the embankment), overtopping during periods of high water, erosion, liquefaction of earth materials (which may occur when embankment material is poorly drained and loosely compacted), structural fail- ures -resulting from excessive seepage or other causes, and failures of the foundation upon which the structure rests. Problems associated with outlets and spillways can also be contributing factors. Like most works of man, dams should not be considered to have an unlimited use- ful life. Ernest E. Wahlstrom, Professor of Geological Sciences at the University of Colorado, states in Dams, Dam Foundations, and Reservoir Sites: \"The ultimate fate of all dams and reservoirs, unless they are carefully constructed and maintained, is deterioration and failure or filling by sedimentation. Every reservoir that impounds water behind a dam is a real or potential threat to those who live and work in flow channels below it, and, in some locations where earthquake shocks, movements along bedrock faults beneath dams, or collapse of large volumes of earth materials into reser- voirs are distinct possibilities, even the most skilled design and continued maintenance may not preclude failures that are disastrous to life and property.\" So, many events and circumstances can threaten the safety of a dam, including floods, landslides, earth- quakes, and-less dramatically but just as surely-neglect and the deterioration which inevitably occurs through neglect. Vi CHAPTERI TYPES OF DAMS Before discussing some of the procedures for inspecting a dam, it is appropriate to make a few general comments about such structures. In simplest terms, a dam is a barrier constructed across a watercourse for the purpose of storing water. Perhaps the most common type is the earthfill dam, and this pamphlet deals with small dams of this mode of construction. There are also concrete dams (gravity, arch, multi-arch, and buttress types) and dams constructed of masonry, timber, rockfill, steel, and combina- tions of these materials. Earth dams may be further classified as simple, core, and diaphragm (Plate No. 1). The simple embankment type consists of reasonably uniform material throughout, sometimes with a blanket of highly impervious material placed on its upstream face. Core embankments employ a central zone or core of carefully chosen material which is less pervious than the rest of the dam. Clay soils are often used for the core, as this type of material is particularly suitable. Diaphragm type dams incorporate a relatively thin section of concrete, steel, or wood-sometimes referred to as a cut-off wall-in the central portion of the embankment, which forms a barrier to the flow of water perco- lating through the dam. Occasionally an earth dam is constructed with both a central core and a diaphragm.

There are certain features of such structures, such as the principal spillway, which perform vital functions and are common to practically all small earth dams. Understanding the purpose of these is essential to any evaluation of a dam's condition. Such principal parts include the embankment itself, the principal and emergency spillways, the intake structure, outlet works, and stilling basin. Other common features often but not always found are riprap slope protection and foundation drains. Brief definitions of some of these principal features follow, and others are indicated on Plate No. 2, \"Typical Small Earth Dam.\" Spillway. A channel or conduit for an impoundment's overflow. The main such out- let is designated as the principal spillway. Usually there is an additional outlet at a somewhat higher elevation, known as the emergency spillway. Emergency spillway. The purpose of the emergency spillway is to safely pass the dis- charge of major floods, thereby preventing the dam from being overtopped and pos- sibly washed out. Because the ability to handle major floods is so critical to a dam's safety, an adequate emergency spillway is one of the most important features of any dam. Intake structure. That part of the principal spillway through which water enters. Outlet works. Pipes or culverts below the spillway crest and generally near the base of the downstream toe of the dam, which serve to release water through the dam. Stilling basin. A basin or pool area at the toe of a dam into which the outlet works discharge, designed to dissipate the energy of the flow so as to -prevent downstream scour or erosion. Foundation drains. Various types of systems employing pipe, gravel, etc. within an embankment which serve to collect seepage water and move it to a point where it can be safely discharged without deterioration of the dam. Typical foundation drains are shown on Plate No. 3. Core. The central portion of a zoned earth dam, composed of impervious material. Cutoff trench. An excavation in the foundation of a dam for the purpose of con- struction of a vertical barrier to seepage. Riprap. A layer, facing, or protective mound of stone in random size pieces, ran- domly placed to prevent erosion, scour, or sloughing of an embankment or structure. Trash rack. A screening device located at an intake structure to prevent the entry of debris. 3 (a) toe drain (b) toe drain, clay core (c) blanket drain (d) chimney drain, clay core FOUNDATION DRAINS PLATE NO. 3 4 CHAPTER III IS YOUR DAM REALLY A HAZARD? Every dam represents a potential hazard to the area downstream from it, simply because of the inherent amount of destructive energy that would be unleashed if the stored water behind it was suddenly releases. Thus a dam is generally classified as to the degree of hazard it poses simply on the basis of its location, without regard to the type of structure or the condition it is in. Hazard class I dams are those whose location is such that in the event of a failure there would be probable loss of life and excessive damage. Hazard class 11 are those where loss of life is possible and damage would be appreciable. For Hazard class III dams no loss of life is expected, and damage would be minimal. In view of the fact that a dam owner is legally liable for damages resulting from the failure of his dam, it is a good idea for every owner of a dam to pauseand considerwhat lies below it. Several questions need to be asked. What is the nature of the land use downstream: wooded or agricultural land, scattered homes, roads, villages, urban areas? How many structures are located within a half mile, a mile, several miles of the dam? How are downstream structures located with regard to the watercourse or floodpiain, with respect to both distance from the watercourse or river and elevation above it? Think about the first-floor elevation of the homes located downstream. Are they only afewfeet above the level of thewatercourse, oraretheyon bluffs high above it and out of danger? Is the valley below the darn characterized by steep hills forming a narrow gorge, or is there a broad floodplain? This is an important consideration, as it determines whether water released in a dam failure would soon spread out and lose its force or whether a destructive wall of water would travel a long distance downstream. An awareness of the state of development of the downstream area should be a continuing concern, as conditions below a dam often change appreciably over the years. Thus a dam which posed little hazard when constructed may represent a formidable hazard later as the downstream are"
