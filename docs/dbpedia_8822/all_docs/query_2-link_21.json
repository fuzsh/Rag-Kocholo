        "text": "[SHEHR-lee] is a town in Piscataquis County, incorporated on March 4, 1834 from the township T3 R4 BKP, EKR.\n\nIt annexed part of the town of Wilson in 1848, the year before that town was dissolved and its remains parceled out to Greenville and Elliottsville.\n\nShirley was first settled in 1825.\n\nThe town was named for the Massachusetts hometown of Joseph Kelsey, the local Representative to the Maine Legislature at the time of incorporation.\n\nThe town of Shirley is just south of Greenville on Maine combined Routes 6 and 15.\n\nIts main village, Shirley Mills, grew up around early 19th century clapboard and saw mills, using water from the Piscataquis River.\n\nThese four photos were taken from N45° 21′ 56.90″ W69° 37′ 17.30″.\n\nShirley Mills is at Shirley Pond. Upper Shirley Corner and Lower Shirley Corner are located on Route 6/15 leading to Greenville and Moosehead Lake to the north.\n\nA saw mill and a grist mill were located on the outlet of Shirley Pond in the 19th century.\n\nThe East Branch of the Piscataquis River runs south through the pond. A small picnic area is near the outlet.\n\nAlong the east side of the pond, the B&A Railroad North Road runs north along the river.\n\nIt was created from the rail bed. The railroad played an important role in the local economy before it was abandoned.\n\nShirley Mills is the birthplace of American humorist and poet Edgar Wilson Nye (1850-1896), popularly known as Bill Nye.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nPhillips, Allen.
