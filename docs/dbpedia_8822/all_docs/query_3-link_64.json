        "text": "Body\n\nBeing able to drive is a sign of independence and freedom. A disability can affect driving, but many individuals do return to safe and independent driving. In some cases, this may require evaluation by a Driver Rehabilitation Program.\n\nDriver Rehabilitation Programs are staffed by occupational therapists, rehabilitation engineers, and certified driving instructors. This team of professionals provides a comprehensive clinical and behind the wheel (BTW) evaluation. The goal is to determine an individual's potential for driving and recommend specific equipment for their vehicle if necessary.\n\nTo schedule a driver evaluation, a prescription from a physician or vision specialist is required. The prescription must include the patient's diagnosis, and must also state, \"OT Driver Evaluation and Treatment.\"\n\nMost insurance providers cover the cost of the clinical, but not the BTW, evaluation. When calling for information, ask about alternative funding sources.\n\nBelow is a listing of programs in Chicago area.
