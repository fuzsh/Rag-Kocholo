        "meta_description": "Abstract The nature of downward wave coupling between the stratosphere and troposphere in both hemispheres is analyzed using the 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-40) dataset. Downward wave coupling occurs when planetary waves reflected in the stratosphere impact the troposphere, and it is distinct from zonal-mean coupling, which results from wave dissipation and its subsequent impact on the zonal-mean flow. Cross-spectral correlation analysis and wave geometry diagnostics reveal that downward wave-1 coupling occurs in the presence of both a vertical reflecting surface in the mid-to-upper stratosphere and a high-latitude meridional waveguide in the lower stratosphere. In the Southern Hemisphere, downward wave coupling occurs from September to December, whereas in the Northern Hemisphere it occurs from January to March. A vertical reflecting surface is also present in the stratosphere during early winter in both hemispheres; however, it forms at the poleward edge of the meridional waveguide, which is not confined to high latitudes. The absence of a high-latitude waveguide allows meridional wave propagation into the subtropics and decreases the likelihood of downward wave coupling. The results highlight the importance of distinguishing between wave reflection in general, which requires a vertical reflecting surface, and downward wave coupling between the stratosphere and troposphere, which requires both a vertical reflecting surface and a high-latitude meridional waveguide. The relative roles of downward wave and zonal-mean coupling in the Southern and Northern Hemispheres are subsequently compared. In the Southern Hemisphere, downward wave-1 coupling dominates, whereas in the Northern Hemisphere downward wave-1 coupling and zonal-mean coupling are found to be equally important from winter to early spring. The results suggest that an accurate representation of the seasonal cycle of the wave geometry is necessary for the proper representation of downward wave coupling between the stratosphere and troposphere.",

        "text": "a. Southern Hemisphere\n\nWe examine downward wave coupling in the Southern Hemisphere by considering wave-1 propagation in 2-month overlapping periods from April to December. Figure 1 shows the wave-1 cross correlations with a reference latitude band from 45° to 80°S at 500 hPa with vertical levels from 1000 to 1 hPa for time lags between −10 and 10 days. Correlations that exceed 0.18 are statistically significant at the 99% level and only significant correlations are contoured in Fig. 1. Since the reference level is in the troposphere, positive lags have the troposphere leading the stratosphere, whereas negative lags have the stratosphere leading the troposphere. The correlations only reflect intraseasonal variability because we have removed variability greater than 1 yr as discussed in section 2. According to the cross correlations there is significant upward propagation (significant correlations for positive lags) from April to December. The upward propagation time from 500 to 5 hPa varies throughout the seasonal cycle from 3 to 4 days in agreement with Randel (1987). The correlations are very weak during November–December, which is expected because of the transition to westward zonal winds and the formation of a critical surface for stationary wave 1—that is, where the zonal wind equals zero (Charney and Drazin 1961). Figure 2 shows the vertical phase structure in May–June (left panel) and October–November (right panel) for +4-day lag (dashed line), which corresponds to the time lag when the correlations maximize in the stratosphere. The upward propagation for positive lags is confirmed by the vertical phase structure from representative 2-month periods. The phase tilt is westward with height above 500 hPa in both May–June and October–November, which indicates upward wave propagation.\n\nWhile there is significant upward propagation during most of the year, there are only significant correlations for downward propagation (i.e., for negative lags) from September to December. The correlations for negative lags maximize in October–November. The downward propagation time from 5 to 500 hPa is approximately 4 days. Figure 2 shows that the phase tilt for the −4-day-lag correlation (solid line) is eastward with height above 500 hPa in both May–June and October–November, which confirms that the negative time lags are associated with downward wave propagation. In October–November, there is a very large eastward phase tilt between 200 and 100 hPa and the tilt in the stratosphere is very small. A similarly large westward phase tilt between 200 and 100 hPa is found for the upward-propagating wave pattern (Fig. 2, dashed line, right panel). The combined phase structure of the upward- and downward-propagating waves is suggestive of a vertical standing wave and is indicative of a wave in the presence of a permanent vertical reflecting surface. The phase tilt with height in May–June is much smoother and is not suggestive of a standing wave pattern.\n\nTo better understand the nature of downward wave coupling throughout the seasonal cycle, we consider the evolution of the wave geometry. Figure 3 shows the climatological seasonal cycle of the zonal wave-1 vertical wavenumber (m) averaged between 55° and 75°S (top panel) along with zonal-mean cross sections of the vertical wavenumber during May–June (bottom-left panel) and October–November (bottom-right panel). The shading indicates regions of wave evanescence, which are bounded by the m = 0 surface, called a vertical reflecting surface. The solid line indicates the m = 0.01 m−1 surface. The dashed lines indicate regions where m = 2, 4 m−1, that is, where m is small. It is clear from the seasonal cycle of the vertical wavenumber that there are two times during the year when there is a vertical reflecting surface in the stratosphere: early winter (May–July) and late spring (September–November). Evidently, the evanescent (shaded) region below 100 hPa from March to September is too narrow (much smaller than a vertical wavelength) to block upward wave propagation because the cross correlations for positive lags are large during that time (see Fig. 1). The reflecting surface during October–November extends farther toward the equator than the vertical reflecting surface in May–June, which is confined toward the pole. Note that the lowering of the evanescent region from October to January is consistent with the formation of a critical surface for planetary waves discussed previously.\n\nThe climatological seasonal cycle of the vertical wavenumber suggests that there should be wave reflection in both May–June and October–November. However, the cross correlations only show statistically significant downward wave coupling during the latter period. The two diagnostics suggest that a vertical reflecting surface is not sufficient for downward wave coupling between the stratosphere and troposphere. We thus examine the second wave geometry diagnostic, which is the meridional wavenumber. Figure 4 shows the seasonal cycle of the zonal wave-1 meridional wavenumber (l) averaged between 100 and 10 hPa (top panel) along with zonal-mean cross sections of the meridional wavenumber during May–June (bottom-left panel) and October–November (bottom-right panel). The dark-shaded regions represent regions of wave evanescence bounded by the l = 0 surface, which represent a boundary to meridional propagation. The solid line indicates the l = 0.01 rad−1 surface. We see that meridional propagation is confined to a specific latitudinal region, which we refer to as the meridional waveguide. Overlying the seasonal cycle of l is the seasonal cycle of m averaged between 10 and 1 hPa. The lighter-shaded regions represent regions of vertical wave evanescence, and the dashed line represents the m = 0.01 m−1 surface. In the bottom panels of Fig. 4, we also include the shading representing vertical wave evanescence and the m = 0.01 m−1 surface, which is identical to the solid lines in the bottom panels of Fig. 3. Figure 4 clearly indicates that throughout most of the seasonal cycle (January–August) there is a very wide meridional waveguide (the north and south evanescent regions are separated by 30°–40° of latitude). This wide meridional waveguide allows waves to propagate equatorward into the subtropical region where they would encounter a subtropical critical surface, which extends to the equatorward boundary of the waveguide. From September to December, however, there is a high-latitude meridional waveguide from approximately 40° to 70°S. Thus, unlike the case for the vertical wavenumber, there is a clear difference in the meridional wavenumber between the May–June and October–November periods.\n\nThe combined l and m seasonal cycles in Fig. 4 reveal that from October to December the high-latitude meridional waveguide is bounded above by a vertical reflecting surface. This configuration forms a bounded wave geometry (cf. the October–November zonal-mean cross section, Fig. 4, bottom-right panel), and it coincides with the maximum downward wave coupling in Fig. 1. In contrast, the wave geometry during May–June is not bounded (Fig. 4, bottom-left panel). In particular, there is no high-latitude meridional waveguide, and thus the waves can propagate meridionally into the subtropics instead of propagating vertically. Even if the waves were to propagate vertically the vertical reflecting surface does not extend far enough equatorward to induce wave reflection. As a result, there is no significant downward wave coupling during May–June.\n\nThe hypothesis is that the absence of a high-latitude meridional waveguide in May–June results in more meridional wave propagation instead of strict vertical propagation. A high-latitude waveguide acts to guide vertically propagating waves upward toward the vertical reflecting surface, which increases the likelihood of downward wave coupling. To confirm that meridional wave guiding is important for guiding vertically propagating planetary waves we consider the seasonal cycle of wave-1 EP fluxes. Figure 5 shows the climatological seasonal cycle of the ratio of the meridional component of the wave-1 EP flux at 35°S averaged between 100 and 10 hPa to the vertical flux at 100 hPa averaged between 35° and 90°S (solid line) from June to December. The ratio quantifies how much of the wave-1 activity flux entering the stratosphere at 100 hPa between 35° and 90°S propagates equatorward. It decreases by a factor of 3 between May–June and October–November. This confirms that there is significant meridional propagation in June–August, which is consistent with the lack of a high-latitude meridional waveguide during that time. The meridional propagation is significantly decreased from September–November, which is consistent with the presence of a high-latitude meridional waveguide. Figure 5 also shows the ratio between the vertical flux at 10 hPa and the vertical flux at 100 hPa both averaged between 35° and 90°S (dashed line). This ratio quantifies how much of the wave-1 activity flux entering the stratosphere at 100 hPa between 35° and 90°S propagates vertically through the stratosphere and reaches 10 hPa. The ratio peaks during midwinter (August–September) at the time when there is no reflecting surface. This also agrees with the seasonal evolution of the wave geometry. Note that the sum of the two EP ratios exceeds one during certain times, which suggests the stratosphere is a source of wave 1 during these times of the year. Randel et al. (1987) noted a wave source in the upper troposphere (between 300 and 100 hPa). These EP flux ratio diagnostics support the hypothesis that a bounded wave geometry, particularly in the meridional direction, is important for preventing meridional propagation toward the equator and for guiding the waves upward toward the vertical reflecting surface and subsequently back downward toward the troposphere.\n\nb. Northern Hemisphere\n\nGiven the importance of meridional wave guiding in the Southern Hemisphere, we also examine its role in the Northern Hemisphere. As discussed in the introduction, Perlwitz and Harnik (2003) investigated wave-1 reflection during JFM and SON (3-month-average periods) in the Northern Hemisphere from 1979 to 2001. They argued that an index based on a vertical reflecting surface was useful for isolating years with downward wave coupling. In the previous section, it was shown that in the Southern Hemisphere the presence of a vertical reflecting surface is not a sufficient criterion for downward wave coupling (cf. winter in the Southern Hemisphere). Since Perlwitz and Harnik (2003, 2004) only investigated wave reflection during fall and mid-to-late winter, we investigate the full seasonal cycle of downward wave coupling and wave geometry. We repeat all of the diagnostics from the previous subsection.\n\nFigure 6 shows the seasonal evolution based on 2-month overlapping periods from September to May of the wave-1 cross correlations, with a reference latitude band from 45° to 80°N at 500 hPa with vertical levels from 1000 to 1 hPa for time lags between −10 and 10 days. There is significant upward planetary wave propagation (significant correlations for positive lags) from September to March. In general, the correlations for positive lags in the Northern Hemisphere are statistically significant over a wider range of time lags than those in the Southern Hemisphere. Figure 7 shows the vertical phase structure in November–December (left panel) and February–March (right panel) for +6-day lag (dashed line). The upward propagation for positive lags is confirmed by the vertical phase structure from representative 2-month periods. The phase tilt is westward with height above 500 hPa in both November–December and February–March, which indicates upward wave propagation.\n\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, the seasonal cycle of the cross correlations associated with downward wave propagation (correlations for negative time lags in Fig. 6) have a similar evolution as those in the Southern Hemisphere except that they occur 2 months earlier in the seasonal cycle. The shift in the seasonal evolution of the correlations between the two hemispheres is consistent with the fact that planetary waves are stronger in the Northern Hemisphere. Note that the downward wave correlations during April–May are not accompanied by significant upward correlations. Thus, we assume that during April–May the coupling will be dominated by different dynamics related to the final vortex breakdown, in particular, nonlinear wave dynamics and reflection from a critical surface rather than simple linear reflection from a vertical reflecting surface. Figure 7 shows that the phase tilt for the −6-day-lag correlation (solid line) is eastward with height above 500 hPa in both November–December and February–March, which confirms that the negative time lags are associated with downward wave propagation. The phase tilt with height in both November–December and February–March is very smooth and not indicative of a standing wave pattern as found in the Southern Hemisphere during October–November.\n\nFigure 8 (top panel) shows the climatological seasonal cycle of the zonal wave-1 vertical wavenumber averaged between 55° and 75°N along with zonal-mean cross sections of the meridional wavenumber during November–December (bottom-left panel) and February–March (bottom-right panel). As in the Southern Hemisphere, there are two times during the year when there is a vertical reflecting surface in the stratosphere: early winter (November–December) and late winter (February–March). The vertical reflecting surface is very high in the stratosphere in November–December and very low from March onward. In November–December and February–March, the vertical reflecting surface extends from 1 to 3 hPa; however, the vertical reflecting surface in November–December extends farther south than that in February–March (Fig. 8, bottom panels). The seasonal cycle of the vertical wavenumber agrees with the results of Perlwitz and Harnik (2003): the 3-month JFM average clearly has a vertical reflecting surface, whereas the 3-month SON average does not. We know from Perlwitz and Harnik (2003) that the vertical reflecting surface during JFM is not a permanent reflective surface, it is associated with the interannual variability of the stratospheric jet, which results from major stratospheric sudden warming events.\n\nThe lack of downward wave coupling during November–December despite the presence of a vertical reflecting surface can once again be understood using the meridional wavenumber. Figure 9 (top panel) shows the climatological seasonal cycle of the zonal wave-1 meridional wavenumber averaged between 100 and 30 hPa along with zonal-mean cross sections of the meridional wavenumber during November–December (bottom-left panel) and February–March (bottom-right panel). Overlying the seasonal cycle of l is the seasonal cycle of m averaged between 3 and 1 hPa. As in the Southern Hemisphere, there is a very wide meridional waveguide throughout most of the year (April–December). This wide meridional waveguide allows for meridional propagation into the subtropics where the waves would encounter a subtropical critical surface. From January to March, however, there is a well-defined high-latitude meridional waveguide from approximately 45° to 75°N. In February–March the climatological wave geometry is not completely bounded as it is during October–November in the Southern Hemisphere (cf. the bottom-right panels in Figs. 4 and 9). However, there is still a high-latitude meridional waveguide, which is important for focusing wave energy in the vertical. Perlwitz and Harnik (2003) showed that downward wave coupling during individual JFM months is associated with a bounded wave geometry (see their Figs. 12c and d).2\n\nFinally, we confirm that meridional wave guiding is important for focusing planetary wave propagation in the vertical direction by considering the seasonal cycle of wave-1 EP fluxes. Figure 10 shows the climatological seasonal cycle of the ratio of the wave-1 meridional component of the EP flux at 35°N averaged between 100 and 10 hPa to the vertical flux at 100 hPa averaged between 35° and 90°N (solid line) from October to April. This ratio decreases from early to late winter (November–April), though the decrease is weaker than that in the Southern Hemisphere. However, there is still an indication that for a given amount of vertical flux through 100 hPa there is more meridional flux through 35°N during November–December than during February–March, consistent with the meridional wavenumber evolution. Figure 10 also shows the ratio of the vertical flux at 10 hPa and the vertical flux at 100 hPa, both averaged between 35° and 90°N (dashed line). This ratio is nearly constant (with wave pulses that likely reflect the large variability and insufficient data to properly capture the climatology), which is consistent with the existence of downward wave reflection during November–March. However, the relative amount of wave reflection is overall much smaller in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere (cf. Figs. 5 and 10). The decrease in the ratio in April–May is consistent with the breakup of the polar vortex and a downward progression of the critical surface for stationary waves, which prevents the waves from reaching 10 hPa. Note that the sum of the two EP ratios is never greater than one, which indicates that the stratosphere is not a source of wave 1 as it was in the Southern Hemisphere. Overall, the EP flux ratio diagnostics support the hypothesis that a high-latitude meridional waveguide plays an important role in downward wave coupling in both hemispheres."
