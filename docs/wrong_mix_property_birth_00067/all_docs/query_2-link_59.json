Since our founding, we have served as the collective voice of American authors, and have long supported the rich and diverse literary culture of our country. Our members include novelists in all genres and categories, nonfiction writers, journalists, historians, poets, and translators. The Guild welcomes traditionally-published authors as well as self-published, independent authors.\n\nWe advocate on behalf of working writers to protect free speech, freedom of expression and authors’ copyrights; fight for fair contracts and authors’ ability to earn a livable wage; and provide a welcoming community for writers and translators of fiction, nonfiction, poetry and journalism. Our educational and charitable arm, the Authors Guild Foundation, offers free programming to teach working writers about the business of writing, as well as organizing events that highlight the importance of a rich, diverse American literary culture and the authors that contribute to it.\n\nMember Benefits\n\nBecome a Member\n\nThe Authors Guild has membership levels for writers at every stage of their career. Visit our Membership page to learn which level is right for you and join today."
