        "text": "About the Bridgerton Series\n\nSet between 1813 and 1827, the Bridgerton Series is a collection of eight novels, each featuring one of the eight children of the late Viscount Bridgerton: Anthony, Benedict, Colin, Daphne, Eloise, Francesca, Gregory, and Hyacinth. I didn’t originally set out to write an eight-book series; at first it was just going to be a trilogy! But readers really took to the Bridgertons (and to the mysterious Lady Whistledown, whose gossip columns “narrated” the first four books), and I found myself rather enamored with the family, too.\n\nRead | Buy\n\nAfter I was done with the series, however, I received hundreds of questions from readers about the Bridgertons and what happened to them later in their lives. So I decided to give all of the main characters an update in what I call “2nd Epilogues.” These stories, originally available as e-shorts, have now been collected into The Bridgertons: Happily Ever After, along with a bonus novella about Violet, called “Violet in Bloom.”\n\nTen books after the On the Way To the Wedding, I returned to the Bridgerton family. But instead of writing about the next generation, I went backwards, into the Georgian Era, which I’d found myself rather drawn to. And thus, Because of Miss Bridgerton began the story of The Rokesbys, the family who lived next door…\n\nRead | Buy\n\nIn 2023 television pioneer Shonda Rhimes and #1 New York Times bestselling author Julia Quinn teamed up to write Queen Charlotte, a novel set in the Bridgerton-verse, inspired by the original series Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story, created by Shondaland and streaming on Netflix.
