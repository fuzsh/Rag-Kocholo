I had no experience with any creative skills until then. I had not picked up a paintbrush or a pen. I was now competing with artists and creatives who had been studying art since they were born. \n\nWith time and regular practice, I was able to find my way through it and tried multiple things. \n\nPractice can make you creative; practice can make you whatever you want to be. \n\nNow, as a writer, designer, and creator, I still give the utmost importance to my creative practices because, without them, I am nothing. As my favourite author Malcolm Gladwell says \n\n“Practice isn’t the thing you do once you’re good. It’s the thing you do that makes you good.” \n\nKnow that you can harness creativity if you practice long enough ✨\n\n#creativity #practice #multipassionateentrepreneur #niftbangalore #niftbangalorelife #creativityeveryday #dropout #engineering\".",
