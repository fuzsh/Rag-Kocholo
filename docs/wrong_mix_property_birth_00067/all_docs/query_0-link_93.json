        "text": "Perhaps Thursday’s slaying of defending Open champion Andy Roddick will be the easy part for Sweden’s Joachim Johansson.\n\nIn the men’s semifinal today, Johansson must take out the guy who may be his future brother-in-law, Australian Lleyton Hewitt.\n\nWith Americans Roddick and Andre Agassi gone, the focus shifts to this 22-year-old, 6-foot-6 Swede who used to practice with Bjorn Borg. Johansson, the No. 28 seed, ended last year ranked 103, but has a serve bigger than Roddick, if that can be imagined.\n\nThe tall Swede also has been dating Hewitt’s sister, Jaslyn, for the last four years and is tight with the Hewitt family. He spent a few weeks during the Christmas season in Adelaide with the family, even practicing with Lleyton.\n\nJohansson believes a boyfriend-girlfriend bond is thicker than blood; after he beat Roddick late Thursday, he told the crowd, “She can pick her boyfriend, but she can’t pick her brother. So she’s going to go for me, for sure.”\n\nAfter he said that, the blond-haired Jaslyn, 21, looked blanched and declined interview requests.\n\nYesterday, he softened his stance: “I don’t think she’ll care because one of us will get to the final. That will be great for her. But it’s tougher for them watching it, not for us.”\n\nIf Johansson gets by Hewitt, he will likely face No. 1 seed Roger Federer in tomorrow’s Final. Federer – going for his third Grand Slam title of the year, having already won the Australian Open and Wimbledon – is heavily favored in today’s second semifinal to beat England’s Tim Henman, who has had a relatively easy draw.\n\nToday, Johansson expects Jaslyn – a top-ranked Australian junior recently ranked 321 by the ATP – to sit in either the suite of Hewitt’s agency, Octagon, or the Hewitt box.\n\n“She’s going to sit in [the family] box to watch,” he said. “I’m not going to tell her to sit in mine and not sit with her family.”\n\nHe has had dinner this fortnight with the Hewitt clan, but not with Lleyton. Yesterday, as Hewitt walked past Johansson’s court, the Australian gave a friendly wave. Johansson, his game face on, barely acknowledged Hewitt.\n\n“It would be strange playing him in the semifinals of a slam,” said Hewitt, the 2001 Open champion who hasn’t lost set yet. “He’s got a lot of firepower, as much as Roddick.”\n\nJohansson said Jaslyn is the lone close supporter he’s got here.\n\n“My Dad is in Scotland playing golf,” he said. “I was supposed to play golf this week, but I have to change my plans.”\n\nJohansson’s father, Leif, played for the Swedish Davis Cup team with Borg as a doubles partner. When Johansson was 14, he even hit with Borg.\n\nJohansson could prevent Federer from becoming the first player to win three Grand Slams in a year since fellow Swede Mats Wilander did it in 1988.\n\n“I didn’t see any of it, but I was surprised,” Federer said of Roddick’s loss. “I didn’t think he was going to lose.”\n\n“Let’s give credit to [Johansson],” Roddick said after his five-set quarterfinal defeat. “The guy serves out of a tree.”\n\nJohansson banged out 30 aces against Roddick, coming up with a number of them on Roddick’s break points. Roddick had 15 break-point chances, converting just three. In fact, total match points won was 152-128 in Roddick’s favor.\n\n“You don’t really need to analyze the match any further than break points and break points converted,” he said.\n\nTALE OF THE TAPE\n\nROGER FEDERER TIM HENMAN\n\n1 SEED 5\n\n23 AGE 29\n\n4 OPENS PLAYED 9\n\n4th round (’01, ’02, ’03) BEST OPEN PERFORMANCE 4th round (’96, ’98)\n\nDURING THIS OPEN\n\n45 ACES 56\n\n21 DOUBLE FAULTS 31\n\n132 FASTEST SERVE (mph) 127\n\n3 SETS LOST 8\n\nLLEYTON HEWITT JOACHIM JOHANSSON\n\n4 SEED 28\n\n23 AGE 22\n\n5 OPENS PLAYED 1\n\nWon (’01) BEST OPEN PERFORMANCE 1st round (’03)\n\nDURING THIS OPEN\n\n35 ACES 66\n\n13 DOUBLE FAULTS 25\n\n124 FASTEST SERVE (mph) 142\n\n0 SETS LOST 3"
