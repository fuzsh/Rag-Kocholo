        "text": "Lleyton Hewitt is a tennis player for the Australian Davis Cup team, he is the youngest male to ever be ranked Number 1 in the world. In his career Lleyton has made over 20 million dollars, his bets achivements in his career include the 2001 US open, 2002 Wimbledon and the 2000 US open. Lleyton was born in Adelaide in 1981 and has lived in NSW for the majority of his life.\n\nLleyton Hewitt is one of Australiaâ€™s all-time best tennis players and is still playing tennis at the age of 33, He is one of the strongest members of the Davis Cup team, Lleyton is expected to play is last Grand slam next year and possibly could come the Davis Cup team captain in a few years.\n\nLleyton started his tennis career in 1998, and he became the youngest member of the ATP tournament when he won the 1998 Next generation Adelaide International defeating Jason Stoltenburg. Lleyton is an inspirational player who has inspired many Australians to play tennis, It will be sad to see him retire from grand slams in the very near future.\n\nAs of February 2015 the Czech Republic Davis Cup team is number 1 in the world, They have a very strong team with players such as Thomas Berdych. Lately Berdych has been very successful in the Davis cup and also in his grand slam matches including the recent Australian open.\n\nThe other players in the team consist of Radek Stepanek, Lukas Rosol and Jiri Vesely that are all very strong players.\n\nThe Czech Republic may soon be pushed out of this number 1 position if the Australian team manage to beat them in the first round of the world group Davis Cup competition, although this is unlikely.\n\nThe team has a history of some embarrassing losses and some great victory's. They have won several titles but they have also come runners up on two occasions in 1975 and 2009, They are the only team apart from the USA to appear in all but 1 world cup season. The Czech Republic players represented Czechoslovakia until 1992 and then the Czech/Slovak Republics in 1993 due to special circumstances\n\nThe Czech Republic Davis Cup team are looking very strong and even without Berdych for some of the 2015 season the team is still expected to be successful, The team is looking like a strong competitor for the title for the third time in four years.\n\nBelow is an in depth look at the current Czech republic Davis Cup team stats- (stats from the Davis Cup website)\n\nChampions - 3 (1980, 2012, 2013)\n\nFirst year played - 1921\n\nYears played - 81\n\nYears in world group - 34\n\nMost total wins - Jan KODES (60 wins, 34 losses)\n\nBest Singles player - Roderich MENZEL (60 wins, 34 losses)\n\nBest Doubles player - Jan Kodes (21 wins, 15 losses)"
