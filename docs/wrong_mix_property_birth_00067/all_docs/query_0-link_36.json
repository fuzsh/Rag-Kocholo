        "text": "At least Jaslyn Hewitt knows whom to root for in today’s final – her brother.\n\nAustralian Lleyton Hewitt, the 2001 U.S. Open champion, is back in The Finals after dispatching his likely future brother-in-law, Sweden’s Joachim Johansson, 6-4, 7-5, 6-3 in yesterday’s semifinals. Hewitt will face No. 1 seed Roger Federer today, as the Swiss maestro wiped out Tim Hemman 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 in one hour and 46 minutes.\n\nJohansson, the big-serving upstart Swede who eliminated Andy Roddick in the quarters, has dated Lleyton’s sister, Jaslyn, for 4½ years. That didn’t stop Hewitt from showing no mercy in the straight-set blowout, as he dropped to his knees, clenched his fists and shouted “C’mon!” at the rout’s conclusion.\n\nThe two shook hands quickly at the net, with Hewitt patting his opponent on the back. There was no hug. But afterward in the locker room, Johansson joked to Hewitt, “You’re not gonna get a Christmas present. You received it today.”\n\nHewitt said he figured his sister was rooting for him, but Jaslyn looked glum before the match’s final game. Asked afterward if she had butterflies, Jaslyn said, “I guess a little, but either way I was going to be a winner and a loser.”\n\nHewitt has not lost a set during the fortnight. No player in the open era, since 1968, has gone through the tournament without dropping a set. But now he’s got Federer, looking to become the first player to win three Grand Slam events in a year since Mats Wilander in 1988.\n\n“I feel like I’m playing well at the moment and I give myself a good chance,” said Hewitt, who’s 8-5 lifetime against Federer but 0-3 this year, including losses at the Australian and Wimbledon.\n\nJaslyn, ranked 324 on the WTA computer, was glad the match was over quickly. “I didn’t want whoever to win to be out there all today and not be fresh for the final,” she said. Jaslyn will stick around for the Final. Johansson, nicknamed “Pim-Pim,” said he’s bolting but will make his yearly visit to the Hewitts in Adelaide in December.\n\nBefore the match, Hewitt’s sister told a Swedish newspaper, “If I root for Pim-Pim, I am a bad sister. If I root for my brother, I’m a bad girlfriend.”\n\nJaslyn refused to sit with her family in Hewitt’s box, spending the match in the Octagon suite, more neutral territory, even if the agency represents Lleyton.\n\n“It definitely was a bit awkward for both of us,” said Hewitt. “We have to put our professional caps on and play hard. I’m sure in the years to come we’ll probably have it a lot more than just this first time today.”\n\nJaslyn was a tangled web of emotions afterward. She spent several minutes typing a statement onto her Blackberry which she read aloud to reporters in the player’s lounge. In a cracked voice, she said, “I’m very happy for my brother. It’s great to see him back in a Grand Slam final, which he definitely deserved. I’m very proud of Pim-Pim. This was his breakthrough year, winning his first tournament and performing so well in this Grand Slam. I have no doubt this result will give him tremendous confidence going forward.” Soon after, Octagon released the statement to the press corps.\n\nThe 28th-seeded Johansson had 17 aces, but 37 unforced errors to Hewitt’s 14. Johansson’s serve is mammoth, but he admits he could use a better volley game. Johansson hits so big, he’s prone to wildness, once popping a backhand off the frame into a luxury suite, the ball being caught by a patron. Hewitt broke Johansson once in each set. Johansson had just one break point the whole match.\n\nOn serve at 5-4 in the first, Hewitt broke, rushing to a love-40 lead, triple-set point as Johansson lost his composure. Hewitt won 20 of 22 points on his serve in the third set, but her sister looked none too pleased.\n\nTale of the Tape\n\nTV: 4:00, Ch. 2\n\nLleyton Hewitt Roger Federer\n\n4 SEED 1\n\n23 AGE 23\n\n5 OPENS PLAYED 4\n\nWon (’01) BEST OPEN PERFORMANCE Semis (’04)\n\nDURING THIS OPEN\n\n44 ACES 52\n\n15 DOUBLE FAULTS 23\n\n124 mph FASTEST SERVE 132 mph\n\n0 SETS LOST 3"
