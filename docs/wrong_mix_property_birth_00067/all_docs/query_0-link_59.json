        "text": "I like graphic novels.\n\nI always have.\n\nI like the illustrations.\n\nIt’s the little kid in me.\n\nI always wanted to be an illustrator\n\nbut I never got past\n\nlittle stick men, sorry, people.\n\nI like that they can tell a novel-size story\n\nin 64 pages or less\n\nwhen some writers – I am thinking Pasolini here —\n\ncan push it up to 900 pages.\n\nCome on!! as Lleyton Hewitt would say.\n\nI have my little list of favourites:\n\n‘Wilson’ by Daniel Clowes and ‘A Taste of Chlorine’\n\nby that French author\n\nand ‘Maus’, of course, the classic by Art Spiegel.\n\nI remember the excitement when I purchased\n\n‘The Dark Knight Returns’ by Frank Miller when it first came out.\n\nIt was like when I bought the just released “Revolver’ by the Beatles\n\nand ran down the ramp of the Adelaide Railway Station to catch\n\nthe train home so I could play it on the turntable\n\nonly to come a cropper at the end.\n\nIt was that kind of excitement.\n\nWhen in doubt, choose a graphic novel, I say.\n\nReading when one person dies the whole world is over, a bleak and beautiful scratchy black-and-white graphic novel. It rains a lot inside the panels. Even for Melbourne. Even when it isn’t raining, the sky is dark and broooding. After a while the pages become soggy; the panels leak into each other; water begins dripping on the floor. I go to get a bucket but it rains and rains. The bucket overflows. In the end I have to close the book and take it back to the library before the house gets flooded.\n\nA good book is like a good fire. You warm to it. It glows for you. When you’re not with it, out in the world, in the cold cross currents of life, you long to get back to it. It is self sustaining like good food or drink. I always like to come home at night and cuddle up with a good book.\n\n‘Zombie’ and ‘Motherlode’, two short stories by Thomas McGuane are what I’m into now. That I’ve read them twice before doesn’t matter. They give off warmth and comfort. ‘TEOTFW’ by Charles Forsman is a short graphic novel that gives out the furious energy of a blazing fire.\n\nWhich books have you read that do this?"
