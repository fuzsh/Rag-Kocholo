        "text": "Fail to prepare and prepare to fail, as the saying goes. Lleyton Hewitt could never be accused of slacking off on his way to 30 ATP singles titles and four Grand Slam finals appearances, including two wins. Preparation over a career like Lleyton's though, means more than just hours of practice.\n\nAfter playing AFL until his early teens, Hewitt took what he'd learned about discipline and moved into the world of tennis. \"I've always worked hard behind the scenes and tried to be as well prepared as I can possibly be,‚Äù Lleyton told tennis.com.au in 2016, and his career bears this out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinishing 2001 at the top of the ATP world rankings was preparation for a subsequent decade-plus at the top of the sport. And now, as Australia's Davis Cup captain, Lleyton is imparting the importance of preparation to the next generation of stars."
