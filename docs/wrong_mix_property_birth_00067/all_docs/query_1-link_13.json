        "text": "By Scoop Malinowski\n\nI was able to give the subject of Facing Hewitt a personal copy of his own book on Friday afternoon after his post Steve Johnson match press conference. He said Thanks mate, paused for a couple of photos.\n\nI also gave his wife Bec a copy on Wednesday.\n\nNow that Hewitt has the book and surely must be enjoying reading all the accolades and respects from his peers on the ATP Tour, it can’t possibly be a coincidence that he’s now in both the singles and doubles final in Newport, can it?\n\nHewitt at 33 is showing absolutely no signs of slowing up at all. He has looked brilliant and masterful all week on the Newport grass.\n\nExcept for a couple of adversities, Hewitt’s game has been utterly dominant. He lost his opening set here to Ryan Harrison 16 but then rebounded to edge Harrison 75 64.\n\nHewitt and Chris Guccione also were in trouble down 45 and triple set point to Krajicek/Smith in the doubles semi. But the long time Australian Davis Cup doubles duo got out of that mess on Thursday and then cruised to victory in straight sets.\n\nBy the way, did I say my new book Facing Hewitt is out yet? Haha\n\n(Update: Hewitt won both the singles and doubles titles in Newport on the same day in July 2014. In the singles final he defeated Ivo Karlovic 63 67 76. It was the 30th and final singles title of Hewitt’s career.\n\nAustralia · Lleyton Hewitt · Newport · Wimbledon · Yonex\n\n<< McEnroe Interviews Noah Rubin On ESPN Radio"
