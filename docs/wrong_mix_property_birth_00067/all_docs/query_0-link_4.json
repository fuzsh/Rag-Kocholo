        "text": "Summary\n\nAdelaide Crows superstar Andrew McLeod is one of the greatest AFL players of the modern era. Since his debut in the AFL in 1995, he has had a triumphant career, winning two premierships and two Norm Smith medals, and been recognised with countless other awards. His diverse roots Indigenous and Scottish have combined to give him both awesome skills and a fierce determination, earning him the respect and reverence of players and fans alike.\n\nYet despite the glories, McLeod's story has rarely been easy. Off the field, he has been dogged for years by a debilitating knee injury and devastating personal conflicts that have threatened to take him away from his beloved club and game forever.\n\nNow he's telling his story of how a young boy from the Northern Territory became one of the legends of modern football, and an Indigenous role-model.\n\nBlack Crow: The Andrew McLeod Story is all about the shy boy from Darwin who became an AFL great. It includes his infamous fall-out with South Australian tennis great Lleyton Hewitt."
