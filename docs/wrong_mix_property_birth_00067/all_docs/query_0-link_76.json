From Monday week he attempts, for an eighteenth consecutive time, to land the biggest cheese of all. Common sense dictates he has little prospect of a third grand-slam tournament success 12 years since his last, but when has Hewitt ever been one to follow the diktats of convention?\n\nBy rights, an athlete whose toes and ankles are riveted together with steel plates, who has three young children, is 33 next month and rarely been tempted to stray from the baseline, should not be playing the 2014 Australian Open at all. Rather he should be building sandcastles on the beach at St Kilda, or splitting the fairways at Kingston Heath"
