The strain on Lleyton Hewitt's face told the story at Tuesday's press conference ahead of Australia's Davis Cup tie against Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Speaking in Adelaide, the Davis Cup tennis captain was quick to shut down any questions about his ongoing feud with Bernard Tomic.

'I'm not going to waste my time on that now,' Hewitt, 37, told journalists.

Hewitt, a two-time grand slam winner, then pointed out why fellow outcast Nick Kyrgios also wasn't selected to play this Friday.

'He (Kyrgios) knows why he's not here, we have sat down and spoken about it,' he said.

'He has still got to meet the standards that we expect week in and week out. Nick knows what he has got to do.'

Hewitt then stated his decision not to play doubles against Bosnia and Herzegovina was based solely on the Australian team's options - not recent criticism from Tomic.

'We have got a lot of options and I'm happy with how the guys are playing at the moment,' he said.

'I think I have got a team that can get the job done and I fully back these boys to get the win.'

Moments after he was bundled out of the Australian Open in the first round, Tomic, 26, savaged his former mentor Hewitt.

He stated 'no one likes him anymore' before accusing former the world number one of player favourtism and on-court self interest.

A fired-up Hewitt responded by claiming Tomic had threatened his family and said that the one-time world No.17 wouldn't play Davis Cup 'under his watch.'
