Even to my young 14-year old ears, songs like 'As You Said' stood out above most of what else was happening in the music scene and had a profound effect on me and my future musical tastes. I've also enjoyed following Jack's career after Cream in it's many manifestations. I'm not a musician, but once about two or three years ago, I actually dreamed that I was jamming with Jack and apologizing for not being up to his standards. In my dream Jack was very kind and reassured me to just play what I feel and we had a blast together. Sure, it was only a dream, but it shows the extent to which Jack's music has affected me. Thank you Jack for placing the bar so high and for delivering years of invention, soul and skill in your music.\n\nNAME: Steve Belgard\n\nLOCATION: Denver, Colorado\n\nEmail: stevebelgard\n\n[at]: gmail.com\n\n[dot]:\n\nDate: 28 Oct 2014\n\nTime: 08:38:11\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nYour music was my youth.

Then i ran away to the music store and bought \"LIVE CREAM\", and spend hours and hours hearing that blistering sound, of only 3 man, playing by telepaty, long versions of short songs: NSU and Sweet Wine among others. Jack Bruce, and the lates John Entwistle and Gary Thain, were my favorite bass players ever.

I was just starting to play bass and had a '68 Jazz. After watching Jack play, I immediately went out and traded the Fender Jazz for a Gibson EB-3 (actually a very stupid move, I should have kept them both). But, from that time on, I was a Jack Bruce devotee and proceeded to learn all the Cream bass parts note for note. Always weird, interesting and challenging, he was the person who make me appreciate the potential of an instrument that sat in the back for so long.

My biggest inspiration and influence on my writing and my life. Jack leaves a deep void inside me, but his music and his spirit will live forever. Jack has changed the concept of the electric bass, because in his hands was the dream more real.

Even to my young 14-year old ears, songs like 'As You Said' stood out above most of what else was happening in the music scene and had a profound effect on me and my future musical tastes. I've also enjoyed following Jack's career after Cream in it's many manifestations. I'm not a musician, but once about two or three years ago, I actually dreamed that I was jamming with Jack and apologizing for not being up to his standards. In my dream Jack was very kind and reassured me to just play what I feel and we had a blast together. Sure, it was only a dream, but it shows the extent to which Jack's music has affected me. Thank you Jack for placing the bar so high and for delivering years of invention, soul and skill in your music.\n\nNAME: Steven\n\nLOCATION: Baltimore\n\nEmail: Zeppelinposters\n\n[at]: Gmail\n\n[dot]: Com\n\nDate: 28 Oct 2014\n\nTime: 11:16:26\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nFrom one harmonica player to another YOU ARE GREAT\n\nNAME: heikki soramaki\n\nLOCATION: Finland\n\nEmail:\n\n[at]:\n\n[dot]:\n\nDate: 28 Oct 2014\n\nTime: 11:16:29\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nIn my memory.

And then I remember who was the first person to ring me and console me for 'my' loss on that day - the day the music died along with 'our' Jack. It was my son; who knew immediately how I would be feeling. And although I will always have the music - it is to my son that I will also look to remember Jack, in another way. And that is because he knows he has a connection with Jack Bruce too. You see my son was also born on the 14th May (in 1998) and consequently he received the name: Adam Bruce Mullard Johnston. I am proud to have named him so, and he is pleased to understand this honour as well. So goodbye to Jack Bruce the Master of the Bass.

One need only skim these pages to see how many bass players were forged in the fires he enkindled with his work. Many of the greatest joys I've experienced in life have been the result of playing music, and every note I play has something to do with the lessons and values I've absorbed from following Jack's fearless artistic example - both as a creative role model on the instrument we both play and for his refusal to take the easiest path throughout his wide-ranging career. It would have been easy for him to simply continue doing what had made him most popular, and I'm deeply grateful to him for showing how to push beyond that to seek a series of new challenges. What I admire most in him, evidenced both through the things he played on his instrument and in his career choices, is his staunch determination not to be limited by the expectations of others. Jack Bruce, as revealed through his work, has been a huge presence in my interior life, and will surely continue to be so. I'm sorry we'll miss out on hearing whatever he was about to do next, because unlike many of his peers, he was still moving restlessly forward. My heart goes out to those of you who enjoyed real flesh-and-blood relationships with him, and for whom his loss exists in dimensions not available to people like myself who knew him only through his rich and wonderful music.\n\nNAME: Philippe Harrison\n\nLOCATION: World\n\nEmail:\n\n[at]:\n\n[dot]:\n\nDate: 28 Oct 2014\n\nTime: 13:49:32\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nDear Jack, Thank you for all your music and inspiration.

The hall's been cleared, and it is so quiet...When I first beheld him, with West Bruce and Laing at Winterland SF '72, he commanded the stage like a living flame...I made it as far as the ferryman's cottage at the foot of Kintyre in '74...In subsequent Bay Area gigs, he never failed us or preened (except in self-mockery). At Oakland's Omni Club in oh '89, he led a band which include, \"my big brother, Ginger Baker\". They even did Christmas bits!..Whatta presence..a full-service troubadour, with political commitment and a great sense of humor. Via a long-ago interview, he gave the reader this advice: \"You've got to believe in yourself.\" I'd raise a glass of cheer, but like him, I've got liver trouble.
