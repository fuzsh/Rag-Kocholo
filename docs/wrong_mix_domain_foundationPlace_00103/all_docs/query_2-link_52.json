And I fell in love with that album, immediately!\" Dave also in 2015: \"A recent album that [I really spent time with] was the Algiers record that I really like - which I think’s a great record. It's kind of mixture of gospel and electronic music. It’s very cool.\" Algiers have remixed 'Where's The Revolution' in 2016. Matt Tong of Algiers: \"Depeche Mode... what a treat to see them do their thing. Very impressive.\" Lee Tesche of Algiers: \"It's pretty surreal. Everyone in their crew is incredibly nice. It’s really interesting to see how these huge shows are run. Their set is pretty good right now too. I’ve been pretty impressed by how magnetic and full of energy Dave Gahan is every night.

The crowds were fanatic. It was surreal to launch into Obsession in front of that crowd and have our hair blown back with the wild response. Backstage, while watching Depeche Mode, I came upon their big reel to reel decks. While they were on stage banging on corrugated metal and other random things, these decks were playing backing tracks. I’d never seen that done before. The sound was cinematic. The crowd enthralled. The only backing we had at that point was a sequenced bass line on Obsession.\" 1994 April's Motel Room\n\n1994-04-14 Gymnasio Nacional, San Jose, Costa Rica\n\nCalifornian band. 1994 Babasónicos\n\n1994-04-08 Sarsfield Stadium, Buenos Aires, Argentina\n\nArgentinian band. 2013 Bat For Lashes\n\n2013-08-22 DTE Energy Music Theatre, Detroit, MI, USA\n\n2013-08-24 First Midwest Bank Amphitheatre, Chicago, IL, USA\n\n2013-08-27 Minnesota State Fair, St. Paul, MN, USA\n\n2013-09-01 Molson Canadian Amphitheatre, Toronto, ON, Canada\n\n2013-09-03 Bell Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada\n\n2013-09-06 Barclays Center, Brooklyn, NY, USA\n\n2013-09-08 Nikon at Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, NY, USA\n\n2013-09-10 Jiffy Lube Live, Washington D.C., USA\n\n2013-09-12 Aaron's Amphitheatre at Lakewood, Atlanta, GA, USA\n\n2013-09-14 Live Nation Amphitheatre at the Florida State Fairgrounds, Tampa, FL, USA\n\n2013-09-15 BB&T Center, Sunrise, FL, USA\n\nBat For Lashes covered 'Strangelove' in 2011 for a Gucci commercial, which came out on a Record Store Day single a year later. Natasha Khan said beforehand: \"I think it’s going to be amazing [to open for DM] because I think, especially in the US, Depeche Mode is really loved. Whenever I speak to people in America about it they’re like, “Oh my god! That’s awesome!” I’m so excited. I think the shows are gonna be wild. I’ve heard that [Dave]’s an incredible performer. We’ve been so lucky. We’ve supported Radiohead and Coldplay on some South American and European tours. It’s always really interesting supporting big bands like that doing shows in front of thousands of people because you learn so much and there’s like an electricity in the air. I think it’s gonna be really fun and I’m really excited to finish out the album this way.\" 2013 Big Deal\n\n2013-12-03 ÖVB Arena, Bremen, Germany\n\n2013-12-05 König-Pilsener-Arena, Oberhausen, Germany\n\n2013-12-07 Ziggo Dome, Amsterdam, The Netherlands\n\n2013-12-09 Arena, Malmö, Sweden\n\n2013-12-11 Scandinavium, Gothenburg, Sweden\n\n2013-12-13 Telenor Arena, Oslo, Norway\n\n2013-12-15 Hartwall Arena, Helsinki, Finland\n\nAlice Costelloe: \"People say meeting your heroes is always disappointing, but meeting Martin Gore was AMAZING.\" 2013 BBB Soundsystem\n\n2013-05-07 HaYarkon Park, Tel Aviv, Israel\n\nIsraelian band, better known as Balkan Beat Box. 2018 Black Line\n\n2018-02-07 Tauron Arena, Krakow, Poland\n\n2018-02-09 Atlas Arena, Lodz, Poland\n\n2018-02-11 Ergo Arena, Gdansk, Poland\n\n2018-02-13 Minsk Arena, Minsk, Belarus\n\n2018-02-16 SKK, St. Petersburg, Russia\n\n2018-02-18 Hartwall Arena, Helsinki, Finland\n\n2018-02-20 Arena Riga, Riga, Latvia\n\n2018-02-22 Siemens Arena, Vilnius, Lithuania\n\n2018-02-25 Olimpiyski Arena, Moscow, Russia\n\nBlack Line is a new project by Cyrusrex and Douglas J McCarthy (from Nitzer Ebb) with various collaborators, among others Christian Eigner. 2018 Black Rebel Motorcycle Club\n\n2018-05-22 Honda Center, Anaheim, CA, USA\n\n2018-05-24 Golden 1 Center, Sacramento, CA, USA\n\n2018-05-27 AT&T Center, San Antonio, TX, USA\n\n2018-05-29 BoK Center, Tulsa, OK, USA\n\n1985 Blah Brothers, The\n\n1985-07-30 Torwar Hall, Warsaw, Poland\n\nThe Blah Brothers was a band created by Daryl Bamonte & Andrew \"Nobby\" Marr for Depeche Mode's tours whenever DM needed a support act.

Neil Arthur: \"When we toured with DEPECHE MODE the first time, I hadn’t long left college and I was working so I took time off work to do that. We weren’t signed at that time.

A very funny thing happened… When we done those two dates in the Channel Islands with sell out audiences, we were at the entrance to the airport and there were a load of teenagers there with autograph books. DEPECHE MODE walked straight through and the teenagers didn't bat an eyelid… They were dressed as DEPECHE MODE, they weren’t in disguise! Me and Stephen walked past, nobody battered an eyelid. My girlfriend walked past and they mobbed her! [laughs] Those kids were Swiss tourists and they knew there were these bands there but they couldn’t figure out who and she looked the most glamourous. So she had to sign all the autographs!

However, Ted Ottaviano refutes this claim: \"No! It was really based on the fact that our record had just come out, and… well, first of all, we did two tours with them. The first one was the Some Great Reward tour, and it was the American leg of that. And because of the fact that our record was making noise and the other fact that we were both Sire artists, we were teamed up. I think it was Seymour [Stein] who introduced us to them, and then Daniel Miller, who was basically their producer and ran Mute Records, which was their main label out of England. They just liked the record a lot, and they gave us a shot. And in a weird way, we kind of worked well for their crowd, and as a result, we were asked back the next year for the Black Celebration tour, which was almost double the size of venues and amount of dates. I mean, that was a huge tour.\"\n\nSusan Ottaviano in 2013: \"[Fellow band member] Ted [Ottaviano] was at the show in New York a couple of weeks ago. It was a great experience for us. We didn’t have very much live experience when we started to go on the tours. And we just kind of really learned from the ground up. We really learned so much about touring and I think we really would become a good live band because of it. We got to see the world. It was a really positive experience! At the time, who would have thought that they would become this super group of this type of music in general? There were a lot of bands that were more famous than them at that point, but I think Depeche Mode really stood the test of time – and they really became a super group. And they did it in such a great way – their music has always had a certain integrity and they kept up that quality.\"\n\n1986 Book Of Love\n\n1986-04-29 Eilenriedehalle, Hannover, Germany\n\n1986-04-30 Eurogress, Aachen, Germany\n\n1986-05-02 Hanns-Martin-Schleyer-Halle, Stuttgart, Germany\n\n1986-05-03 Rudi-Sedlmayer-Halle, Munich, Germany\n\n1986-05-04 Hallenstadion, Zurich, Switzerland\n\n1986-05-06 Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy, Paris, France\n\n1986-05-07 Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy, Paris, France\n\n1986-05-08 Palais des Sports, Lyon, France\n\n1986-05-10 Forest National, Brussels, Belgium\n\n1986-05-11 Philipshalle, Düsseldorf, Germany\n\n1986-05-13 Friedrich-Ebert-Halle, Ludwigshafen, Germany\n\n1986-05-14 Saarlandhalle, Saarbrücken, Germany\n\n1986-05-16 Alsterdorfer Sporthalle, Hamburg, Germany\n\n1986-05-17 Alsterdorfer Sporthalle, Hamburg, Germany\n\n1986-05-18 Waldbühne, Berlin, Germany\n\n1986-05-20 Münsterlandhalle, Münster, Germany\n\n1986-05-21 Stadthalle, Bremen, Germany\n\n1986-05-22 Westfalenhalle, Dortmund, Germany\n\n1986-05-24 Ahoy, Rotterdam, The Netherlands\n\n1986-05-25 Walter-Köbel-Halle, Rüsselsheim, Germany\n\n1986-06-01 Wang Theatre, Boston, MA, USA\n\n1986-06-03 Tower Theatre, Philadelphia, PA, USA\n\n1986-06-04 Tower Theatre, Philadelphia, PA, USA\n\n1986-06-06 Radio City Music Hall, New York, NY, USA\n\n1986-06-07 Radio City Music Hall, New York, NY, USA\n\n1986-06-08 Radio City Music Hall, New York, NY, USA\n\n1986-06-10 Blossom Music Center, Cleveland, OH, USA\n\n1986-06-12 Finger Lakes, Rochester, NY, USA\n\n1986-06-13 Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, NY, USA\n\n1986-06-14 Merriweather Post Pavilion, Columbia, MD, USA\n\n1986-06-17 Verdun Auditorium, Montreal, QC, Canada\n\n1986-06-18 Kingswood Music Theatre, Toronto, ON, Canada\n\n1986-06-20 Kingswood Music Theatre, Toronto, ON, Canada\n\n1986-06-21 Pine Knob Music Theatre, Clarkston, MI, USA\n\n1986-06-22 Poplar Creek Music Fest, Chicago, IL, USA\n\n1986-06-24 St. Paul Civic Center, St. Paul, MN, USA\n\n1986-06-26 Will Rogers Auditorium, Fort Worth, TX, USA\n\n1986-06-28 City Coliseum, Austin, TX, USA\n\n1986-06-29 Southern Star Amphitheater, Houston, TX, USA\n\n1986-07-01 Red Rocks Amphitheatre, Denver, CO, USA\n\n1986-07-03 Park West, Salt Lake City, UT, USA\n\n1986-07-05 Greek Theatre, Berkeley, CA, USA\n\n1986-07-06 Shoreline Amphitheatre, Mountainview, CA, USA\n\n1986-07-08 Expo Theatre, Vancouver, BC, Canada\n\n1986-07-11 Sports Arena, San Diego, CA, USA\n\n1986-07-13 The Forum, Inglewood, CA, USA\n\n1986-07-14 Irvine Meadows, Irvine, CA, USA\n\n1986-07-15 Irvine Meadows, Irvine, CA, USA\n\nSusan Ottaviano: \"It was so exciting to be 20 years old and travel through Europe, it was amazing.

They also remixed Martyr in 2006. Apparently this was only the tenth gig for the band. Arno: \"[Remixing or supporting DM] was… bizarre. Surreal. I remember that in the beginning when we were asked I wasn’t even sure if I wanted to do it. But of course not doing it wouldn’t have been an option.\" Walter: \"We were asked to do the remix some time prior to the request for the show. We knew that, being a part time DJ, Martin Gore knew the label and Booka Shade. Then, when the support slot for Berlin was free, we obviously were proposed by somebody from the label. We were asked if we were free one week before the show, but the actual decision was made one DAY before the show! Things became a bit hectic when we heard that we would do it… but in the end everything went really smoothly. The production people were very nice and we even had a sound check (which we didn’t expect). We actually didn’t get the chance to talk to the band at all. They arrived shortly before the gig.\" Arno: \"Knowing the [DM audience], you can believe me, we sh+##’ in our pants before the gig. I’ve been to so many concerts before as a viewer and I’ve seen many acts fail. While on stage we didn’t really realize how it went, but I saw a video recording later on and I was really surprised how big the applause really was! A lot of questions in the Internet.\" 2013 Booka Shade\n\n2013-05-07 HaYarkon Park, Tel Aviv, Israel\n\nArno: \"Needless to say we’re huge Depeche Mode fans, hooked since 1983.

I knew like the big hits and I liked that stuff, but I really didn't know them all that well and then going on tour with them I got a whole new level of respect. They have a huge body of work that is great and they've been consistently great over the years and they're a good live band - they totally kick ass! They kind of go about it the same way we do which is their live show is more organic and rock 'n' roll then their recordings.

It will be a challenge for us and a great opportunity to show our music to new ears, an opportunity from which we will learn a lot and for which we feel very grateful. Playing next to your idols is an amazing experience and something that's difficult to describe. In addition to the great musical influence they have had on us, we admire their great ability to reinvent themselves without neglecting their primal essence or betraying themselves, which is something we also try to achieve in every step we take.\"\n\nThey also said here:\n\nRafael: \"There was no open contest [for the support act slot]. In fact, we had not been told that we were competing [laughs]. [The organisation] only asked us what we were going to do on March 18th. \"Have it blank, just in case,\" they told us.

To be honest, I had not heard much of Depeche Mode until we received the news that we're going to open for them.

Martin Gore had also heard their song \"Hollow Talk\" in the TV series The Bridge. Jannis Noya Makrigiannis: “Apparently, Martin Gore likes our music and he invited us on to go on tour. We were actually just taking a break from an entire year of touring, but of course we couldn't say no to such an incredible invitation. The entire experience was unbelievably intense and nice! It is wonderful to see how such a huge band like Depeche Mode is still popular after 30 years and how they still play tremendous shows, night after night. The band members are about as old as my parents, but on stage they've got more energy than I ever will, haha.” 1982 Choir Invisible\n\n1982-05-15 Perkins Palace, Pasadena, CA, USA\n\n2013 Chvrches\n\n2013-07-16 Antic Arena, Nimes, France\n\n2013-07-18 San Siro Stadium, Milan, Italy\n\n2013-07-23 Synot Tip Arena, Prague, Czech Republic\n\n2013-07-25 National Stadium, Warsaw, Poland\n\nMartin Doherty of Chvrches later said: \"The highlight of the summer [in 2013] and my career was supporting Depeche Mode at San Siro Stadium in Milan and it blew my mind a little bit. It was crazy. It was 60,000, the biggest audience we've played to by a mile. It was 60,000 for Depeche Mode and it wasn't full when we finished, but it was getting there. The fans were lovely to us. I had heard these horror stories about Depeche Mode fans that if they don't like the support band they throw eggs, but they were really kind to us. That was the second show we've done with them, we've got a couple more next week. They've been really nice to us and that's all we can ask for.\" Apparently, Chvrches donated the profit to a woman shelter. 2023 Cold Cave\n\n2023-05-16 Ziggo Dome, Amsterdam, The Netherlands\n\n2023-05-18 Ziggo Dome, Amsterdam, The Netherlands\n\n2023-05-20 Sportpaleis Antwerpen, Antwerp, Belgium\n\n2023-05-23 Friends Arena, Stockholm, Sweden\n\n2023-05-26 Leipziger Festwiese, Leipzig, Germany\n\n2023-05-28 Národný Futbalový Stadión, Bratislava, Slovakia\n\n1981 A Cruel Memory\n\n1981-02-16 Cabaret Futura, London, England, UK\n\nThis small band, who were from the same town as Anne Clark, back up her spoken-word performance debut by providing some instrumentation. 2013 Crystal Castles\n\n2013-09-18 Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion, Houston, TX, USA\n\n2013-09-20 Gexa Energy Pavilion, Dallas, TX, USA\n\n2013-09-22 Sleep Train Amphitheatre, San Diego, CA, USA\n\n2013-09-24 Santa Barbara Bowl, Santa Barbara, CA, USA\n\n2013-09-26 Shoreline Amphitheatre, Mountainview, San Francisco, CA, USA\n\n2013-09-28 STAPLES Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA\n\n2013-09-29 STAPLES Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA\n\n2013-10-02 STAPLES Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA\n\n2013-10-08 Desert Sky Pavilion, Phoenix, AZ, USA\n\n1982 Cuba Dares\n\n1982-10-06 National Stadium, Dublin, Ireland, UK\n\nIrish band. 2018 Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft\n\n2018-07-23 Waldbühne, Berlin, Germany\n\n2018-07-25 Waldbühne, Berlin, Germany\n\nD.A.F. is one of the first bands that got signed to Mute Records in 1980.

In 2012, Martin Gore and Vince Clarke asked not only Noto to remix VCMG's Single Blip, but asked Byetone as well. Byetone had also DJed at the Short Circuit Festival and Vince Clarke liked his DJ set a lot. And Martin used one of Byetone's tracks in a 2011 remix podcast. In 2012, Noto and Byetone joined forces as 'Diamond Version', signed by Mute Records. Olaf Bender: \"You don't call Depeche Mode, Depeche Mode call you. With other bands, you offer yourself to play as their support act. Depeche Mode don't operate like that. They don't give it away for free. They only do what they like. We have called it our tour of humbleness. Such a crowd would never come to us. So at the same time, it's a huge opportunity. The way Martin Gore puts himself on the middle of the stage, when Dave is off stage for a while, without any lights or anything, and sings his ballads, barely accompanied by music, is amazing. That has impressed me the most, that he has kept his sensibility after 30 years of being on stage. He gets completely vulnerable.\" Martin Gore later remixed one of their songs.

This supergroup, consisting out of Bernard Sumner, Johnny Marr, Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe, was brand-new and so these were their first performances. Sumner says that while recording their album, DM asked them to play Shea Stadium in New York [which didn't happen]: \"We only had two songs finished. We thought it would be totally mad to do it, so we said we'd do it.\" Bernard Sumner recalled in Uncut magazine, 2001: \"I got completely and utterly fucked up [with booze and drugs] on the first night. There was a shower in the dressing room and I just filled it with puke.

EMA is quoted in the 2017-12-22 issue of Berliner Zeitung as saying: \"I heard that Martin Gore picks the support acts himself. If that is true, then I would really like to know which songs of mine he likes most. How can this happen to me, of all people? If Depeche Mode were looking for somebody that fits them perfectly, they would choose someone else! [...] Maybe I should play so loudly that none of the fans yelling \"booooo\" can be heard.\" When Q magazine asked Martin Gore about his favourite album of 2017, he answered: \"Exile In The Outer Ring by EMA. I loved her last album, The Future's Void, and I've been really getting into this one. It's a bit harder to get into but I do like it. She's got something about her, it almost reminds me of Iggy Pop around the time of The Idiot or Lust For Life.

[...] It was very nice because a lot of people began to say on social media, \"We want Estados Alterados‏ to open for Depeche Mode!\", and that was very cool. This means a lot to us because it is clear that we had met their standard. They are one of the great bands that we follow, and it is also important because we realise all the support and efforts of the fans.

According to Simon Spence's DM biography, Martin Gore warned Bates that the extremely fanatic DM fans could be hostile towards any support act. 1982 Fad Gadget\n\n1982-12-23 Whatever You Want, The Ace, Brixton, England, UK\n\nDepeche Mode supported Fad Gadget on 1980-11-12 Bridge House, London, England, UK, where Daniel Miller noticed them and offered a deal with DM. 2001 Fad Gadget\n\n2001-09-04 Paegas Arena, Prague, Czech Republic\n\n2001-09-05 Waldbühne, Berlin, Germany\n\n2001-09-06 Waldbühne, Berlin, Germany\n\n2001-09-08 Trabrennbahn, Hamburg, Germany\n\n2001-09-09 Festwiese, Leipzig, Germany\n\n2001-09-11 Stadthalle, Vienna, Austria\n\n2001-09-12 Kisstadion, Budapest, Hungary\n\n2001-09-21 Globe, Stockholm, Sweden\n\n2001-09-22 Spektrum, Oslo, Norway\n\n2001-09-23 Parken Stadium, Copenhagen, Denmark\n\n2001-09-25 Galaxy, Amneville, France\n\n2001-09-26 Kölnarena, Cologne, Germany\n\n2001-09-27 Kölnarena, Cologne, Germany\n\n2001-09-29 Olympiahalle, Munich, Germany\n\n2001-09-30 Olympiahalle, Munich, Germany\n\n2001-10-02 Eishalle, Nürnberg, Germany\n\n2001-10-03 Schleyerhalle, Stuttgart, Germany\n\n2001-10-04 Hallenstadion, Zurich, Switzerland\n\n2001-10-06 Arena, Oberhausen, Germany\n\n2001-10-07 Sport Paleis, Antwerp, Belgium\n\n2001-10-09 Bercy, Paris, France\n\n2001-10-10 Bercy, Paris, France\n\n2001-10-11 Festhalle, Frankfurt, Germany\n\n2001-10-17 Wembley Arena, London, England, UK\n\n2001-10-18 Wembley Arena, London, England, UK\n\n2001-10-20 MEN Arena, Manchester, England, UK\n\n2001-10-21 NEC, Birmingham, England, UK\n\n2001-10-23 Halle Tony Garnier, Lyon, France\n\n2001-10-24 Forum, Milan, Italy\n\n2001-10-25 Palamalaguti, Bologna, Italy\n\nDepeche Mode supported Fad Gadget on 1980-11-12 Bridge House, London, England, UK, where Daniel Miller noticed them and offered a deal with DM. In April 2001, Andy Fletcher and Daniel Miller attended Fad Gadget's first concert in six years, where they probably contemplated on giving Fad a support slot on DM's tour. Frank said: \"It feels really good being with Depeche Mode. They're great guys, and I'm looking forward to having a beer with them afterwards. Like last night, we had a little drink together. They beat us at table football, unfortunately, but we'll beat them tonight. It's not a tight relationship with Depeche Mode. I see them every two or three years, normally at a Mute party or something, and we only have a few beers together, and that's it. And then I don't see them for another three years.\" 2014 Feathers\n\n2013-03-15 SXSW, Brazos Hall, Austin, TX, USA\n\n2014-01-15 Palau Saint Jordi, Barcelona, Spain\n\n2014-01-17 Palacio de Deportes de la Comunidad, Madrid, Spain\n\n2014-01-18 Palacio de Deportes de la Comunidad, Madrid, Spain\n\n2014-01-21 Park & Suites Arena, Montpellier, France\n\n2014-01-23 Halle Tony Garnier, Lyon, France\n\n2014-01-25 Sportpaleis, Antwerp, Belgium\n\n2014-01-27 LG Arena, Birmingham, England, UK\n\n2014-01-29 Bercy, Paris, France\n\n2014-01-31 Bercy, Paris, France\n\nAfter being handpicked by Martin Gore to open for DM at SXSW, they said: \"[...] We opened for them [at SXSW], which was awesome; it was one of the greatest shows that I’ve ever done. We are huge fans of theirs, but we were mostly excited because it meant we were actually able to see them. It was so hard to get tickets as it was like a lottery, so when we found out we were opening up, we were like ‘yes! we actually get to see them’. It was a really intimate setting — just over 300 people around a really small stage. So, we were just inches away from them when they played. That was amazing.\" Reportedly, band member Anastasia Dimou was grabbing breakfast at Whole Foods when she received an email that her band Feathers was offered the opening slot for a leg of Depeche Mode's European Tour. Her reaction? \"I punched the sky, uttered a silent scream, and almost fell into a cereal aisle out of excitement.\" 2009 Feedbackers\n\n2009-10-13 Explanada del Estadio Monumental, Lima, Peru\n\nA Peruvian audiovisual performance band. You can listen/watch what they played on stage here. 1981 Film Noir\n\n1981-11-10 Raquels, Basildon, England, UK\n\nFilm Noir was formed by Robert Marlow and Perry Bamonte. This was their first (and only?) performance. Robert Marlow remembered in Jonathan Miller's 'Stripped': \"It was quite funny, because Vince said to just ring up this promoter, who was a real cowboy of a fellow, and he said, 'They've already got Blancmange supporting them.' I said, 'But Vince said we can play,' and he said, 'Well, you can play, but you won't get any money for it.' In the end, Vince gave me the money - 50 quid, it was. But that wasn't important; he'd asked us to play, so we went on before Blancmange, and then it was Depeche Mode. It was nice for me. I really enjoyed supporting them. I played guitar and we had a synthesizer player; Perry [Bamonte] was playing bass, and we had a tiny [Boss DR-55] 'Dr Rhythm' drum machine - one of the programmable ones. It was good; we went down well. Blancmange were excellent - I'd never seen them before; they were really, really good, and they were nice guys as well. The Modes were themselves, but Vince was quite withdrawn and not very happy. It was quite funny. Vince had a dose of diarrhoea! They'd been on tour up and down the country for a while, and so I think he was happy to be home. But I remember going around his flat during the day for a chat and he said, 'It's alright; I've been dosing myself up with syrup of figs. Silly arse.'\" 1981 Fixx, The\n\n1980-09-24 Bridge House, London, England, UK\n\nThe Fixx and Depeche Mode were both support acts for Comsat Angels that night. 1986 Fountainhead, The\n\n1986-04-02 RDS Arena, Dublin, Ireland\n\nIrish rock band. 2013 F.O.X.\n\n2013-05-04 Palais Nikaia, Nice, France\n\n2013-05-10 Terra Vibe, Athens, Greece\n\n2013-05-12 Lokomotiv Stadium, Sofia, Bulgaria\n\n2013-05-15 National Stadium, Bucharest, Romania\n\nMitzi Fox: \"I wrote an email to Dave Gahan, in which I sent him some of our songs. At that time the band was formed since only six weeks, But in any case I wanted to reach out to him to find out what he thought about us. I did not really dare to expect to get an answer, but he responded and wrote that he likes what we do. A friendship started. He has continued to support us and develop opportunities for us, for which we are unspeakably grateful.\"\n\nApparently, Dave invited them to see Depeche Mode at the South By South West music conference in Austin, Texas. A few weeks later, they got an e-mail from the band’s management, asking them to be the sole support for five dates on Mode’s European tour.\n\n2017 F.O.X.\n\n2017-05-20 Štadión Pasienky, Bratislava, Slovakia\n\n2017-05-22 Groupama Aréna, Budapest, Hungary\n\n2017-05-24 Eden Aréna, Prague, Czech Republic\n\n2017-05-27 Festwiese, Leipzig, Germany\n\nThey were also a support act in 2013. Mitzi Fox said in 2017: \"Before the Delta Machine tour, we had never played before so many people. We were thrilled that we could share our music with such a huge audience. But then we read what a support act can expect on a Depeche Mode tour. Like throwing bottles (or something worse) or screams and so on... All of a sudden we felt the huge responsibility of doing an opening gig for a band that has incredibly passionate fan base. Before we first went on stage, they told us: \"It is possible that you will get booed, but don't worry about that.\" At that point we said, let's do it. Once, however, we went on stage, the reception of the audience was really great. We got new fans in different places.\" 2006 Franz Ferdinand\n\n2006-07-17 Curva Olympico, Rome, Italy\n\n1980 French Look\n\n1980-06-14 Nicholas School, Basildon, England, UK\n\nFrench Look featured Martin Gore, Robert Marlow, and Paul Redmond. On 1980-05-30 Paddocks Community Center, Laindon, Essex, England, UK, Depeche Mode supported French Look, but at Nicholas School, it was vice versa. Robert Marlow: \"Vince was extremely angry [with Martin], because Martin would perform in both bands. But that's what Martin is like: He wants to do good for everyone. Nevertheless, Vince was expecting a clear commitment. (...) But we played our set, Martin went offstage, changed his shirt and is about to go back on again. Suddenly, Vince is going completely mad: he screams all around him, and actually claims that we have changed the settings on the synthesizers! [T]hey were on first, and we were both using the same keyboards - Fletcher was playing my Korg, well, to be honest he didn't play much - except at this gig they messed up all the settings before we went on!\" Apparently, Rob Marlow had an argument with Paul Redmond and the gig collapsed because the latter refused to play his keyboards. Not surprisingly they broke up after that. 1987 Front 242\n\n1987-10-22 Pabellon De Real Madrid, Madrid, Spain\n\n1987-10-23 Blaugrana Sports Palas, Barcelona, Spain\n\n1987-10-25 Olympiahalle, Munich, Germany\n\n1987-10-26 Palasport, Bologna, Italy\n\n1987-10-27 Paleur, Rome, Italy\n\n1987-10-29 Palasport, Turin, Italy\n\n1987-10-30 Palatrussardi, Milan, Italy\n\n1987-11-02 Hanns-Martin-Schleyer-Halle, Stuttgart, Germany\n\n1987-11-03 Festhalle, Frankfurt, Germany\n\n1987-11-04 Grugahalle, Essen, Germany\n\n1987-11-06 Sporthalle, Cologne, Germany\n\n1987-11-07 Messehalle, Hannover, Germany\n\n1987-11-09 Deutschlandhalle, Berlin, Germany\n\n1987-11-11 Friedrich-Ebert-Halle, Ludwigshafen, Germany\n\n1987-11-12 Hallenstadion, Zurich, Switzerland\n\n1987-11-13 Halle des Fêtes, Lausanne, Switzerland\n\n1987-11-16 Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy, Paris, France\n\n1987-11-17 Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy, Paris, France\n\n1987-11-18 Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy, Paris, France\n\nIn 1991, Front 242 got signed by Epic Records. They then said to Melody Maker: \"We've had Americans come up to us, saying, 'We love Depeche Mode, but we love you too, because you are the strong edge of electronic music that Depeche Mode draw on'. I think America is just ready for electronic music. And Epic Records might have guessed that through watching the rise of Depeche Mode.

I am proud to be an Essex boy! I really felt that when I watched them performing Enjoy the Silence last night - what an amazing achievement for them as a band and a proud moment for us to have the pleasure to play with them. It brought a big smile to my face. We’re big fans of course. Their evolution is inspiring. From the early days at Mute right up to now, a perfect balance of pop, darkness and experimentation. We’re big fans of electronic music and they are true innovators. I love hearing the influence of our favourites like Kraftwerk and Bowie in their music, too. It feels like we have a musical connection as well as a geographical one.

I hated it and thought seriously about quitting, but realized that would have been inexcusable, so I went to a studio in Germany (Hansa in fact) halfway through the tour, and edited the backing tapes down to a set of about 15 minutes. That helped, but the tour manager was really not pleased that it was such a short set.\" 2013 Matthew Dear\n\n2013-06-29 Olympic Stadium, Kiev, Ukraine\n\n2013-07-03 Esprit Arena, Dusseldorf, Germany\n\n2013-07-05 Esprit Arena, Dusseldorf, Germany\n\n2013-07-09 Moon and Stars (Piazza Grande Locarno), Locarno, Switzerland\n\n2013-07-20 Stadio Olimpico, Rome, Italy\n\nMatthew Dear talks about DM here: \"[B]ack in 2005 we saw them play in Detroit. We didn’t have any connections then, we were just fans. We ended up sitting pretty close to the stage, and right before they started playing they had their soundtrack music come on. The first track was from Audion, one of my other projects, and we just started looking at each other. We knew then that Martin was kind of a fan. It was always hovering, this idea that one day something could happen, and then the remix kicked it off. They asked us to open for them in Düsseldorf. I think 90 percent of the people in the audience weren’t familiar with my work, but there were definitely one or two die-hard Depeche fans near the front going, “Aw yeah! I heard the remix this guy did for them”, so that’s good to hear. The way I look at it is that you shouldn’t get in the way; the fans are there to see Depeche Mode. This is their night to connect with their favorite band, and it’s my job to give them what Depeche Mode wanted me to say. By selecting me they’re telling the fans, “Check out this stuff that we like.” So we did a nice little set, played our hearts out, and hopefully got a few converts. You don’t want to offend anyone in a situation like that. I think it was one of the largest crowds we ever played for. We played in Kiev a few days ago and that was 42,000 tickets sold and that was amazing. It was an open stadium so it felt more festive, and the crowd was looser. I think the people in Germany are a bit more hardcore about Depeche Mode, whereas there I think they were just excited in general. The Germans were definitely more judgmental toward us, but in a good way. We had to earn their applause, and we fed off that.\" 2017 Maya Jane Coles, DJ\n\n2017-07-13 SKK, St. Petersburg, Russia\n\n2017-07-15 Otkritie Arena, Moscow, Russia\n\n2017-07-19 Olimpiyskiy National Sports Complex, Kiev, Ukraine\n\n2017-07-21 PGE Narodowy, Warsaw, Poland\n\n2017-07-23 Cluj Arena, Cluj-Napoca, Romania\n\nMaya Jane Coles said beforehand: \"Truly honored and excited to support such an iconic band that has influenced so many artists across different genres.\" She said afterwards: \"We got a request from Depeche Mode’s agent basically as rather humblingly the band liked what I do and got me to do a remix of their track “Going Backwards”. I normally prefer playing in more intimate environments so playing to almost 50,000 people at times couldn’t be more opposite but thankful the audience seemed to enjoy what I did. The band [Depeche Mode] were super sweet to me so it made the whole thing a really nice experience.\" She also said: \"I have a lot of respect for Depeche Mode.

Michal: \"It was really an honour to open for Depeche Mode as I am a big longtime fan. Everything came all of a sudden and clicked easily. I received an email with an offer to support DM in Vienna and then the things just happened. And I don’t remember in DM’s history that a support act would actually play their own songs! The crowd’s reaction was fantastic and they enjoyed the harp covers because people were singing to what I was playing and even waved their hands in ‘Never Let Me Down Again‘. Martin and Peter Gordeno came to watch my performance from the backstage and they laughed when the fans were singing to harp. I am really glad I got such opportunity and my dream came true.\" 1982 Microdisney\n\n1982-10-07 City Hall, Cork, Ireland, UK\n\nA band from Cork.

I can think of nothing more fulfilling for a musician than to play in front of 30,000 frenzied Mode fans screaming \"De-peche-Mode\" throughout the entire set. It filled one with a real sense of achievement trying to play the keyboard whilst dodging a variety of missiles, including, on one occasion, a bag of shit - which begs the question, do you bring it with you already prepared, or do it on site, spontaneously, as it were? It was all worthwhile though because I always had the last laugh. For a start, I amassed a great collection of lighters which the angry mob would hurl at us with alarming regularity. Of course, the joke was always on them because you knew that they'd be even more pissed off later when they realised they didn't have one to wave while Martin sang one of his weepy numbers! And of course, there was that small point about being on intimate terms with a particular Mode member [Alan Wilder] - need I say more?\" Hepzibah on Shunt: \"Of course I remembered DM from my youth but I'd never bought a record or knew anything about the band. [...] As an example of DM's obvious influence, when I heard the show for the first time, I found I was strangely familiar with the songs and lyrics. I first talked to Alan on the second night of our support leg which was also his birthday - I had no idea who he was or what he did - we used to wind each other up a lot after the show and he'd ask me to go out to clubs etc.. It was about 3 days into the tour that I realised he was the bloke to played the drums. We became pretty inseparable from that point.\" 1985 Missing Link\n\n1985-07-09 Theatre De Verdure, Nice, France\n\n1985-07-11 Espace Tony Garnier, Lyon, France\n\nUnknown French band. 1988 Mixed Pickles\n\n1988-03-07 Werner-Seelenbinder-Halle, East-Berlin, East-Germany\n\nEast-Berlin band.

Samuel Romano said after the first gig: \"You quickly realise that this type of event, music being played in the outdoors, is born in England. They have a very British attitude towards live music. Personally, we were very good, their technicians treated us like they treat Depeche Mode, with the same degree of professionalism. As for the public event, we can say that this was for us an opportunity to test ourselves. We dealt with an audience that was not ours. But I must say that, after the first seconds, we found ourselves in a very warm audience which understood that we came from the same world of electronic pop that Depeche Mode more or less created. We crossed paths with DM just before they came on stage. They are very polite and friendly. There was a smile, a gesture of greetings but nothing more, also because they are armoured... It is impossible to have a chat with them, even if you are in the same dressing room. And so it must be said that British productions are very strict: the artists are always isolated, left alone, to keep them quiet. The concert was really interesting. Unlike most productions, they are bringing a circus in the middle of the stadium, they arrived with a sober and elegant production, small, but they have conquered the excitement and attention of the people there. I think it's a lesson for those who want to fill the stadium with giant objects but not really focus on the music, that is the most important thing. [Tomorrow in Rome] we will continue to get more awareness. Yesterday we went up on stage trying to understand what could happen. Tomorrow will be a more contextualized event. We will know better how to use our 40 minutes. The setlist will be practically the same, we will change a few things but that will be it. We will be a little less defensive and attack a little more.\" 2009 Motor\n\n2009-06-22 Inter Stadium, Bratislava, Slovakia\n\n2009-06-23 Puskas Ferenc Stadium, Budapest, Hungary\n\n2009-06-25 Slavia Stadium, Prague, Czech Republic\n\n2009-06-30 Parken Stadium, Copenhagen, Denmark\n\n2009-07-01 HSH Nordbank Arena, Hamburg, Germany\n\n2009-07-06 Esplanade Gambetta, Carcassonne, France\n\n2009-07-08 Jose Zorilla Stadium, Valladolid, Spain\n\nBryan Black in Sonic Seducer magazine, May 2009: \"Martin Gore was a fan of MOTOR from the beginning and had great interest in us remixing a few songs. When I found out that Depeche Mode were recording their latest album in my hometown Los Angeles, I just called him one day. He immediately invited me to dinner with the entire band - all three of them being awfully nice guys with whom I can go along perfectly. The idea that we could support them, came on its own.\" In 2011, Motor would release an album on which Martin Gore had sung the vocal track. Bryan: \"[Man Made Machine] all came together on the Depeche Mode tour. There was no masterplan. On the second date in Athens, Dave Gahan fell ill and DM put the tour on hold. No one knew when he would return, so we flew to Berlin and found ourselves in a hotel room waiting on word from the DM camp. We decided to mess around on some new songs, set up a vocal booth in the toilet and soon had ourselves an impromptu studio setup. As an experiment, we started producing more melodic Techno Rock ideas – maybe as a reaction to seeing 60,000 people losing their minds to DM overnight. Martin Gore was the first vocalist on the LP. We gave him a CD of the track and a few days later he looked into our dressing room and said, 'Yes, I'd love to do it'.\" 2006 Muse\n\n2006-07-07 Stockholm Stadium, Stockholm, Sweden\n\nMatthew Bellamy: \"I can understand the association [between Muse and DM], because they're a band that never really fitted in exactly with the music of their time.

Being the obstinate, snotty little upstarts that we were, we baulked at the idea of doing something so ‘mainstream’ and popular’. We actually had a genuine fear that it would ruin our nonexistent career. Daniel insisted and got his way. Once on the tour the penny finally dropped: “Oh, that’s what being in a band is all about…” Not only were we blown away by DM’s stage performance and attention to detail, off stage they were extraordinarily kind and generous… and an awful lot of fun. Things went so well, in fact, that they decided the show must go on, and we were invited to tour the US, too. US immigration had other ideas, and our work visas were denied, citing that we “lacked musical merit”—in some ways, a point well made.\" 1990 Nitzer Ebb\n\n1990-05-28 Civic Centre, Pensacola, FL, USA\n\n1990-05-30 Orlando Arena, Orlando, FL, USA\n\n1990-05-31 Miami Arena, Miami, FL, USA\n\n1990-06-02 The Sun Dome, Tampa, FL, USA\n\n1990-06-04 Lakewood Amphitheatre, Atlanta, GA, USA\n\n1990-06-06 Merriweather Post Pavilion, Columbia, MD, USA\n\n1990-06-08 Performing Arts Center, Saratoga Springs, NY, USA\n\n1990-06-09 Great Woods Amphitheater, Mansfield, MA, USA\n\n1990-06-10 Great Woods Amphitheater, Mansfield, MA, USA\n\n1990-06-13 The Spectrum, Philadelphia, PA, USA\n\n1990-06-14 The Spectrum, Philadelphia, PA, USA\n\n1990-06-16 Giants Stadium, East Rutherford, NJ, USA\n\n1990-06-18 Radio City Music Hall, New York, NY, USA\n\n1990-06-21 Montreal Forum, Montreal, QC, Canada\n\n1990-06-22 CNE Grandstand, Toronto, ON, Canada\n\n1990-06-24 Star Lake Amphitheater, Pittsburgh, PA, USA\n\n1990-06-25 Riverbend Music Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA\n\n1990-06-26 Blossom Music Center, Cuyahoga Falls, OH, USA\n\n1990-06-28 Pine Knob Music Theatre, Detroit, MI, USA\n\n1990-06-29 Pine Knob Music Theatre, Detroit, MI, USA\n\n1990-06-30 Marcus Ampitheatre, Milwaukee, WI, USA\n\n1990-07-02 World Music Theatre, Chicago, IL, USA\n\n1990-07-03 World Music Theatre, Chicago, IL, USA\n\n1990-07-05 Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion, Houston, TX, USA\n\n1990-07-06 Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion, Houston, TX, USA\n\n1990-07-08 Starplex Amphitheatre, Dallas, TX, USA\n\n1990-07-09 Starplex Amphitheatre, Dallas, TX, USA\n\n1990-07-11 Red Rocks Amphitheatre, Denver, CO, USA\n\n1990-07-12 Red Rocks Amphitheatre, Denver, CO, USA\n\n1990-07-14 Olympic Saddledome, Calgary, AB, Canada\n\n1990-07-16 Pacific Coliseum, Vancouver, BC, Canada\n\n1990-07-18 Portland Memorial Coliseum, Portland, OR, USA\n\n1990-07-20 Shoreline Amphitheatre, Mountainview, San Francisco, CA, USA\n\n1990-07-21 Shoreline Amphitheatre, Mountainview, San Francisco, CA, USA\n\n1990-07-22 Cal Expo Amphitheatre, Sacramento, CA, USA\n\n1990-07-25 Park West, Park City, UT, USA\n\n1990-07-27 Veterans Memorial Coliseum, Phoenix, AZ, USA\n\n1990-07-28 San Diego Sports Arena, San Diego, CA, USA\n\n1990-07-29 San Diego Sports Arena, San Diego, CA, USA\n\n1990-07-31 San Diego Sports Arena, San Diego, CA, USA\n\n1990-08-01 Universal Amphitheatre, Universal City, CA, USA\n\n1990-08-04 Dodgers Stadium, Los Angeles, CA, USA\n\n1990-08-05 Dodgers Stadium, Los Angeles, CA, USA\n\nDouglas McCarthy: \"The “World Violation Tour” that took place in the US over the summer of 1990 was an incredible experience for everyone involved.

Thomas Fehlmann said: \"I first met Depeche Mode in 1981, when they'd just released the first or second single. Daniel Miller had invited the band I was in at the time, Palais Schaumburg, over to England to play the Mute Night, Silent Night at the Lyceum. [...] Obviously, meeting Depeche Mode at this point in their career felt like a normal thing, there was nothing spectacular to be thought of it; you couldn't predict the kind of obverse curve they would take with their music, their career—not in the slightest. This was the first time that I heard their music too, and I wasn't even super hot on it; these were the first singles which were super electro-pop. But because of Daniel, we certainly had an open mind. [...] Later we got to know each other, introduced ourselves. They invited us to come to the studio when they were recording their first album, and vice versa. I remember once Martin [Gore] and Alan [Wilder] came to my recording session, they were already at a whole different level at that time. The friendly contact has remained intact to this day.\" In 1990, Holger Hiller mixed 'Enjoy The Silence (The Quad: Final Mix)'.

I heard some nasty things about when Spiritualized opened one of their tours, the fans hated them. So I hope that's not gonna happen. But I think it's a really good fit, because this new record has, as I said, we listened to a lot of mid-'80s music, we did listen to some Depeche Mode making it. Obviously they're a really great pop band; they're seen as this depressed black music, but they have some really great pop songs. They have the melancholy but it's very danceable. I think we're pretty similar in a way. I'm not sure if they think so, but we're really excited and flattered because they did ask us and they do pay us [laughs].\" During the tour, he said: \"We just played Hollywood Bowl and that was what I looked forward to most. And it was great. Bjorn is a big [Depeche Mode] fan. I like some of the songs a lot, especially the older ones like “Stripped” and “Everything Counts.” Some of the newer songs sound like Kent, a Swedish stadium rock band, but with better vocals. But I’m a bigger fan of the Beatles, that’s why I wanted to play the Bowl. They asked us to come along and we said yes! Depeche not the Beatles… [The tour is going] great! People seem to be really into it, especially the new songs! I think Depeche fans can relate to songs like “It Don’t Move Me” and “Just The Past” cause they sound Depeche-y.\" Then he said afterward: \"We did the Depeche Mode tour this summer and that’s probably the longest tour we’ve ever done. It was great. I thought it was going to be less fun than it was because I was kind of scared of the huge arenas and the Depeche fans, if they would like us or not (laughs), but they really did. Most of the gigs they were really, really into it and it was a good experience when you get used to trying to make it intimate in an arena. [It's] true, it is a bit weird [to see people arrive while you're playing]. But at the same time when you feel that you win people over it pays off. It feels good when you have a hard start of the set and everything and then at the end you really feel that they’re into it, so it’s good.\" 1981 Philip Jap\n\n1981-03-16 Bridge House, London, England, UK\n\n1981-04-06 Bridge House, London, England, UK\n\nSynth-pop artist.
