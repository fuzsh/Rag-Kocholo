        "text": "SUGGS (speaking in 1980): If those kids start coming to our gigs there’s nothing we can do about it. I’m not gonna start making statements. I’m not a politician. I’m a musician. None of our music has anything to do with politics. The Specials never get slagged off, and they’re playing to the same audience as us.\n\nMIKE (speaking in 1980): They say a lot of NF kids come to our gigs. But it’s not really a lot of them. And the ones who are there are just geezers who’ve been led astray. They can be talked out of it. It’s telling them to go fuck off that makes it worse. Then they just come back to fight, and it gets violent. At one of our gigs there was some geezers handing out Nazi pamphlets. And one of our mates went out there and asked the guy why he was handing out that sort of rubbish. And this guy had a bunch of mates along. Our mate could have got done. So he had the bottle to go up to this geezer, and when he asked him, the guy just says (dumb voice) ‘I don’t know. It’s just me mates.’ Which shows what bollocks it all is. So by the time they finished, the guy had thrown his pamphlets away. But we’re not political. We’re not gonna do Rock Against Racism gigs just to show people we take a stand. We’re doing it our way.\n\nLEE: Well, there wasn’t wall-to-wall trouble erupting around us. What there was, was a load of skinheads having go at support bands we chose.\n\nMIKE: It seems the sort of people who don’t even know that whole thing about racism and then they’re just the sort of people who get into that violence. They’re maybe just people who are just into violence. It’s maybe not racist I don’t think. They’re just sort of into aggression and into being macho and they’re a bit mixed up. And then that time, we were getting a lot of flak from different sides about that whole thing.\n\nWOODY: We were under a lot of pressure to do something about it. But unfortunately, you cannot dictate who goes to your shows because it’s a free country. You can say that you’re against violence, you can say you’re against any kind of racism, but you can’t say, ‘You can’t come in because you’ve got boots on and short hair.’ What can you do?\n\nCARL: So when you see a kid at a gig handing out flyers with the British Movement on it and Adolph Hitler, you go, ‘Hold on mate, how can you say British Movement, when Hitler killed British people?’ And the bloke says, ‘Oh well, I’m in two minds’ and you talk to these kids and try and create a spark of doubt in their minds.\n\nDAVE ROBINSON: The band made a couple of statements. The thing is to say that you’re not in any way attached to this. So it kind of blew over. I thought the best thing was addressing it as they did – the fact that they were doing well and were attracting a younger audience, the kind of skinhead, right-wing crowd kind of drifted off.\n\nWOODY: The problem is you can’t judge a book by its cover and a lot of skinheads had nothing to do with racism and were perfectly lovely people, but it’s when the old right arm goes up in a stiff manner that’s not appealing. You don’t really associate that with black culture and music.\n\nCARL: What can you do with people who haven’t got half a brain? You just try and live by example and hope they get the message. Our music puts over a joyous position – it’s not like we’re Public Enemy. People don’t leave our gigs spoiling for a fight – they leave smiling.\n\nCHRIS: I always thought it was ironic. We’d fought the Nazis, so these yobbos would have been strung up as traitors during the war; my grandad would have shot them. It was a shame because just at the time we were crossing over into the mainstream, with a younger audience, some people became scared to come and see us in case they got beaten up. I felt terrible.\n\nWOODY: It got very rough. The worst thing was talking to European journalists who said, ‘Yes, I was at your gig and I was beaten up.’ We were like, ‘We really are terribly sorry but it’s got absolutely nothing to do with us.’ It got to the point where journalists were convinced that we affiliated ourselves with a fascist right-wing movement. There was all kinds of rubbish written.\n\nBEDDERS: We never condoned the right-wing skinhead stuff, and hopefully that came through. We did a gig in Scotland and two sets of football fans turned up and proceeded to kick the shit out of each other. It was nothing to do with the music, they just used it as a venue. At the time there were a lot of punch-ups. It’s unheard of now.\n\nSUGGS: One of the main parts of that whole NF phenomena was that the authorities were really clamping down on football hooligans, and then a lot of these nutters realised you could get away with that kind of behaviour at rock concerts. And they did for a while. None of us were ever interested in any of that. It was just the kind of fashion that happened at that time. We were dressing in that style, which was more to do with the style the people were wearing at the time of the music we were emulating – the late 60s style, half rude boy, half skinhead. Unfortunately at the same time there was that Oi!, NF thing going on, which latched itself on to what we were doing.\n\nCARL: We were into old American clothes, and both 50s and 60s records, and we were into looking like skins. But we didn’t like it when the skins came out again, because it made us look bad. No-one had a crop in ’75 or ’76, but then all the NF and BM stuff happened, and that’s how we got roped in on that.\n\nSUGGS: It wasn’t a very comfortable time at all. It was a short period, probably only six months to a year, but during that period it got very hairy – or not hairy in actual fact. We used to get some of these glue sniffing, kind of homeless kids who would get a swastika tattooed on their forehead, and I didn’t think they were particularly dangerous to society, more of a danger to themselves. But there was a certain element of not being vociferous enough about putting them down, I do think that was probably true. It happened to The Specials as bit as well, who actually had black people on stage. It just seemed a kind of fashionable thing at the time.\n\nBEDDERS: What we’d do, is to actually go into the crowd and just ask them what the fuck they were playing at. It seemed a much better way, because instead of running away from the problem, we were actually trying to confront it.\n\nSUGGS: In hindsight, I used to think it wasn’t those kids that were dangerous, it was the people organising them. It was the people in the suits. Then it got a bit out of hand, and the whole thing became a very horrible part of our history. It got out of hand in that it became more than just a few glue-sniffing kids. Then it obviously became something we had to deal with.\n\nWOODY: Luckily, as we dropped the ska and became more pop, we lost the skinhead element of our supporters and appealed to a much wider audience. The skinhead element just died out. A few years later, I was at an open-air gig and this one skinhead called to me through some railings. So I went over and he said, ‘You’ve sold out. You’ve left us all behind. You’re not worthy of anything.’ I thought, ‘What’s the matter with this bloke? All we’ve ever done is play the music that we want to play and hope that people enjoy it.’ He got really upset cos he thought we were their crowning glorious leaders or something. It was really upsetting.\n\nCHRIS: Our fourth single from One Step Beyond and there was trouble. We thought – hard to believe – that four singles from one album was a rip-off and were arguing with Dave Robinson. We were also due to go on tour and didn’t want to do a video. A compromise was reached and Night Boat To Cairo was called The Work Rest And Play EP, featuring three new songs which we felt was good value for money.\n\nWOODY: I don’t know how I came up with the title Work, Rest & Play, I just remember suggesting it. Mistakes, Nutty Theme and Stepping Into Line were all contenders for the first album. In The Rain and the Work, Rest & Play EP were newer songs – the bridge between One Step Beyond and Absolutely.\n\nCHRIS: Deceives The Eye was about the pleasures of shoplifting, which a few of us enjoyed. I got caught, my Dad went to court with me. He blamed himself but it wasn’t his fault. It used to be really easy to nick anything but I wouldn’t do it now – they’ve started putting these bleepers in clothes and records. Plus I’m getting old and I can’t run so fast. The song doesn’t have a moral though ­– we’re not telling people what they should or shouldn’t do.\n\nSUGGS: The Young And The Old was about getting drunk in the pub and noticing how old people acted younger as the evening went on.\n\nLEE: It’s another great Suggs lyric. He’s streets ahead.\n\nCARL: Don’t Quote Me On That was a groove. Until I really started songwriting I’d just free-form over a groove, one take, that was it. I remember the energy of delivering that track and trying to be clever in an obtuse way, but I don’t know if I succeeded at all really. I’ve accepted who I was then, and see it as a completely honest time-capsule of that kid. And I find it really refreshing.\n\nCHRIS: The riff for it is lifted from Bush Doctor by The Music Doctors.\n\nSUGGS: It was written as a riposte to the lots of stupid stuff that was said about us and racism when we were on the road with black people, friends of ours, of Carl in particular. Yet he was the one getting castigated.\n\nCARL: I was aggrieved by the one particular NME interview and that my comments were misconstrued. I dunno – I wasn’t all that eloquent then. I was all tongue-tied.\n\nCHRIS: Originally, the record company had said, ‘We don’t want to do a video for Night Boat’, then at the last minute Robbo decided we would. We were just about to go to America so we had to do it at 12 o’clock at night. By now we’d now got the hang of it and had lots of ideas such as going up the Thames in a tug boat (had to wait until Uncle Sam) and going to Egypt (had to wait for Duran Duran), but due to the lack of time we used a studio with a moody background of the desert. It’s a sort of instruments video, so there’s not many ideas, but we had such fun making it – we were all a bit drunk. I always think it’s crap but everybody loves it; I suppose we’re all having a laugh.\n\nMIKE: It was actually meant to be serious, with the proper pyramids and that, but they ended up making fools of us.\n\nSUGGS: We went to Bermans & Nathans in Camden. They were a very serious costumers – it wasn’t like some crummy old fancy dress shop – and for whatever reason they took a shine to us and let us take whatever we wanted. So we got these very authentic pith helmets and khaki shirts and shorts. Dave had gone to the enormous expense of covering the floor with what must have been an inch of sand. There were two potted plants and Dave’s dog running around to add a bit of atmosphere. I thought I’d jump off the top of a ladder and land in the middle of the set to look like I’d just dropped out of space.\n\nCHRIS: Because we were flying out the next day we didn’t have much time so we felt under tremendous pressure. We were really pissed, all the rucksacks had beer in, the background was wobbling and when Lee blew the sax someone would shake the tree.\n\nLEE: I really like the el cheapo Night Boat video. The pyramids in the background are wobbling all over the show, we’re clearly not in the desert at all but we’re pretending we are, and Robbo’s dog is in it. It’s a very British thing – the sets are falling down, there’s a dog on the loose but carry on regardless. Don’t let the side down.\n\nWOODY: It was all about not taking ourselves too seriously and having a laugh. We grew up with the Keystone Cops, Buster Keaton and Benny Hill on the telly. That was the entertainment that was around us at the time, so if you’re not worrying about which suit you’re wearing on a boat with models around you, that’s what you do.\n\nCHRIS: Before shooting we were presented with silver discs for the One Step Beyond album and had a few drinks. This is what gave us the energy to run all over the place. During the filming we had an idea that we used a lot… basically slowing down the music and film so that when you run it at normal speed we all tend to move in slow motion which nullified the effect. At the end Bedders hams it up as the thirsty soldier and gets a playful prod in the behind. ‘Who was it?’ he said half serious. No one owned up. The final film revealed an Adidas trainer as the guilty party. Stand up Lee Thompson and be judged (oh, you are standing up). The rascally Dave Robinson had to pay over the odds due to the fact that our arguing and wrangling meant we had to film late at night – what we call in the trade a ‘ghoster’.\n\nSUGGS: It’s now passed into the rhyming slang dictionary. If you have a giro, you can cash your Night Boat. Night Boat To Cairo = giro. The proudest moment of my career.\n\nLEE: My Girl was the start of our success and then Baggy Trousers sealed it.\n\nWOODY: It came right in the middle of writing a whole load of songs very, very quickly. We wrote it in about two weeks, in a studio called Olympia. Suggs was a big fan of Ian Dury and writing in your colloquial tongue, so he wanted a song where it wasn’t all flowery and poetic, it was how you spoke.\n\nSUGGS: It was supposed to sound like Ian Dury. It was about school in London, but also as an answer to Pink Floyd. They’d had that song, Another Brick In The Wall. And I remember thinking it was a bit rum, they’d gone to these famous public schools and they were singing, ‘Teacher leave the kids alone’. It sounded sinister and strange, but also self-indulgent to be going on about how terrible school days had been. There was an inverted snobbery about it, too: ‘You went to a posh public school? You wanna try going to MY school.’ I’d gone to this really horrible school and I thought, ‘Well, these teachers aren’t finding it any easier than I am.’ I mean, it was chaos. I also thought how boring it must have been from a teacher’s point of view too, particularly where there were 2,000 boys and a very small percentage interested in anything other than going home. I was thinking about these things as I lay on the floor of Lee’s flat in Caledonian Road after a night at the Hope. I was face-down on the floor in a sleeping bag, pen and pad in hand, and started writing a list of everything I could remember from my days at Quinton Kynaston. I was trying very hard to write a Dury-esque catalogue; that constant stream of description about a very small part of your life. It wasn’t the easiest job at first, as I’d hardly been there for the last few years. But the memories began to trickle in: ‘Naughty boys in nasty schools…’ In a couple of hours I had about six pages, some good, a lot boring, all from my own experience of the sort of nonsense we used to get up to. The chorus was a bit trickier, as I was trying to get across the craziness that occurred at school in the battle against boredom, but balanced with a certain sympathy for the beleaguered teachers. I hoped that at some point a title and chorus would emerge and they did: Baggy Trousers just sounded like an unusual title and I couldn’t think of anything better. By the morning it was done. Lee and Deb had gone to work and I realised I had no money to get home, which is why I’d kipped there in the first place. I borrowed 12p from Thommo’s biscuit tins, just enough for ten fags and my bus fare home (I must pay him back one day). I then turned up at rehearsals with my new words, Chris had a bit of a tasty ska riff on the go, and the words just slotted in perfectly. The melody, if you can call it such, materialised spontaneously.\n\nCHRIS: It was a great song but I never thought it would be a hit. It didn’t have a strong chorus.\n\nSUGGS: Certainly all the things I said about that school were true, and they haven’t changed. I also wrote a song about one of the teachers, it was really horrible, but I never did it: ‘Oh Mr Pound, where are you now? / When you lashed out with the blackboard rubber / Your Bobby Charlton hairdo flying / I was diving under desks for cover / And when I was not quick enough / I’d hit him squarely on the head / He hated everyone in London / And I lay there thinking I was dead.’\n\nLEE: On the run-out groove of the single itself, it read, ‘We have lift off’, which was a reference to the video and was my suggestion. There was a real competitiveness in the band every time we were about to press up a record. We’d race each other to call up Porky Prime Cuts, who cut the records, and tell them what message we wanted written into the groove. It was like a secret we shared with the fans, a little message to them – something fun, a little bit extra that you could do with a record and can’t really do now in the streaming era. But the skill of this race was being able to call Porky right at the moment before they cut the record, close enough that no one else in the band could phone up after you and change the message. Nine times out of ten, I won that race – and Baggy Trousers was no different.\n\nCHRIS: We filmed most of the video, including that famous flying sequence, inside and outside Islip Street School in Kentish Town. A few yards to the left of it is the pub that we all went to for our lunch break after leaving Lee trussed securely up hanging from a crane. It used to be called the Oxford Arms and had a stripper every Thursday (or so someone told me). Further on is a grassy knoll – the second most famous, after the one in Dallas – and a play area where we filmed some kids playing football near a block of flats called the Forties, which Lee lived in as a kid when I first met him. There were lots of kids running riot – kids from the ‘hood.\n\nDAVE ROBINSON: It was filmed at the school because several of the band had actually gone there. They were very happy that some of their old boys hadn’t ended up in Wormwood Scrubs and had actually got a livelihood.\n\nLEE: It was good to keep things local… very local.\n\nWOODY: Shooting the video was really quick – it only took an afternoon.\n\nCARL: If you notice, in the school gym scenes I’m wearing a fake hand. I don’t know why.\n\nMIKE: My missus was there somewhere in the background, sitting on the grass somewhere to the left: ‘Bloody rubbish. What is this?’\n\nCHRIS: Lee had already started giving himself the best roles in the videos.\n\nCARL: Flying up in the air was definitely his own idea.\n\nLEE: I’d seen it done by Peter Gabriel at the Drury Lane Theatre one night when me and Chris bunked in to see Genesis. He was singing A Flower? and he had this harness on and suddenly something went BOOM! and he flew through the smoke on a wire. I thought, ‘One day, I would really love to do that.’\n\nCHRIS: I remember him going on about doing the same thing when he got the chance. Little did we know.\n\nLEE: The thing that immediately came to mind was someone in a big baggy pair of trousers in a high wind taking off, so I suggested to Robbo to get a crane in.\n\nDAVE ROBINSON: Lee said he’d seen somebody do some trapeze something and said, ‘Is there any way I could fly in this video?’ I said, ‘Probably not.’ He was always wanting to do obscure things.\n\nCHRIS: Lee was insistent he wore the baggiest pair of trousers we could find, so we got these trousers from Bermans & Nathans and they were humungous – 64-inch waist. They’d belonged to Peter Ustinov, the great man itself. It was a great honour, even though we had to let them out for Thommo (ha ha).\n\nDAVE ROBINSON: A few people thought the flying scene couldn’t be done, but eventually I found this circus guy who’d done James Bond movies with this kind of trapeze idea. He said, ‘Oh yes, you can do that; you just use a crane and some wires.’ I just thought, ‘Hmm. Let’s make sure the strapping is nice and tight.’\n\nCARL: So we turned up on the day of the shoot and saw this crane, but we didn’t know why it was there.\n\nDAVE ROBINSON: Lee used to keep everything secret from everybody, so he hadn’t told the rest of the band what he was up to, and we certainly weren’t going to tell them. So the crane arrived and the group were none the wiser – they didn’t know that Lee was gonna slap on this thing and do it. It meant when he took off they were genuinely amazed. He went sailing past Suggs’s nose and I was shouting at the crane driver, ‘Get him up! Get him up!’\n\nCHRIS: He was up there on these quite thick wires, so I thought, ‘This is gonna look so two-bob – you’re gonna be able to see how he’s doing it’. But that was the fantastic thing; we went to see the rushes and you couldn’t see them.\n\nLEE: Yeah, the wires not showing was a real coup.\n\nDAVE ROBINSON: There’s a clip of Suggs looking up, totally amazed, as he starts flying – none of the band had seen him doing it.\n\nWOODY: It was just such a shock when he suddenly started flying. From where I was sitting, I honestly couldn’t see the wires, so it was like, ‘Fantastic!’\n\nSUGGS: You can see me going, ‘I hope he doesn’t fall on my head.’\n\nDAVE ROBINSON: I remember being being really impressed that he managed to keep his equilibrium and his sax in his mouth. He’d never even tried it out, so it was really something else. Particularly as we found out later that he was in agony.\n\nLEE: The crane driver was on Guinness and had scars all over the place because of a prior accident. I said, ‘I don’t wanna come back looking like you Quasimodo.’ He put the harness on, they winched me up and that’s when I felt a very sharp pain – it really made my eyes water. What it was, they’d caught part of my scrotum in the strapping and made a love bite effect round me nuts. It was like a painful itch that could not be scratched. Then he fucked off to the pub for 20 minutes and left me hanging there above this spiked fence. So we did the business – three or four times, I think – I came down, took the thing off, got home and it was black and blue. I went to the doctors just for a check-up. I asked him to take away the bruising but leave the swelling (laughs). It was a painful experience, but it was worth it.\n\nDAVE ROBINSON: The only thing was, the cameraman didn’t shut the magazine on the camera properly, so we nearly lost it all.\n\nCHRIS: There was a hair in the gate or something.\n\nDAVE ROBINSON: Jeff Baynes was the cameraman, and his assistant forgot to close the magazine that the film was in and the light got in. So very little of the flying stuff actually came out. What ended up in the final video was us doing the run-through – although you can’t tell it’s a practice run.\n\nCHRIS: Lee originally wanted to have six dummies which represented us, and he was going to fly through the air and kick their heads off. But we thought, no, Top Of The Pops would never show that, so we toned it down and they just appear in the pub scene instead.\n\nDAVE ROBINSON: People who interviewed me later on said, ‘Where was the net?’ And I said, ‘Net?’\n\nLEE: I’d demanded some sort of safety net but Robbo said he couldn’t afford it. Typical Robbo – but it ended up being the business.\n\nDAVE ROBINSON: Although it was simply shot in a school playground, more people probably saw that video than anything. People would even show it on the news.\n\nCHRIS: This video was really important as we started using a lot of other elements, rather than just playing live. It was the first one we did that everybody noticed and we became known for our videos as much as our music. From then on, everyone was saying, ‘Have you seen the new Madness video?’ It established us as video legends.\n\nADAM ANT: Many videos at this time were not about anything except allowing directors to try this or that technique in order to make the band look exciting. The only other band doing anything remotely interesting in their videos were Madness, whose videos made me laugh. I considered them the opposition at the time – especially Lee, who was very funny.\n\nLEE: Looking back, it’s a shame I never did a complete somersault because then it really would’ve looked like, ‘Hey, he’s doing it with no hands!’ That’s stuck with me ever since. Unfortunately, there isn’t a wire thick enough to hold me up now.\n\nCHRIS: Sometimes the best things are the ones that have nothing to do with the song, like Lee flying. People all remember it. It was a very important point for us – we realised we had to monopolise on the old wire-hanging.\n\nLEE: There doesn’t really have to be a reason for anything, it just has to look really good. People think me flying was some sort of expensive process but it wasn’t… it was just a crane!\n\nCARL: We still meet kids who are now grown up and go, ‘I was in that video – that was my school.’\n\nSUGGS: Baggy Trousers really was a turning point. Up until then we’d thought we were quite groovy teenagers, getting groovy teenage chick fans, then we ended up with this horde of undernourished urchins. It wasn’t quite the demographic we were hoping for, but it was just an amazing phenomenon. I mean, the last thing we wanted was a load of ten-year-old twerps following us, but after it came out, they were everywhere you looked. I remember I was walking past a school playground with Joe Strummer and I was saying, ‘I don’t know what’s going on – it’s getting a bit weird.’ And then we turned the corner and all these kids on the swings were singing Baggy Trousers. And Joe said, ‘What’s to complain about?’ It was just hard to – what’s the word? – assimilate.\n\nCHRIS: I was most proud of Baggy Trousers as it was the first single I’d written the music for. So imagine my disappointment when I looked at the label copy and it said ‘Composed by Barson/ Foreman/ McPherson’. I went mad and asked Stiff why it said such falseness and they said, ‘Oh Suggs told us.’ Enough said – he’s not too good on details. So I got it changed. Barso’s name should not be on the songwriting credits – I do hope he never got a penny.\n\nSUGGS: For the cover, Humphrey Ocean, a great painter and old pal of ours, who’d also played bass with the Kilburns, did a fantastic pencil illustration of the band standing outside Chalk Farm station.\n\nWOODY: We were under a great deal of pressure to put out a second album, so this was written and recorded in about six weeks. We went into the studio and literally bashed out an album, so it was all a bit of a blur.\n\nBEDDERS: It was done unbelievably quickly because of the demands of Stiff and Dave Robinson. But although it was written under such time pressure, it produced some brilliant songs.\n\nCHRIS: Despite the nutty image, we worked really hard and took it really seriously. There was a huge blackboard with all the songs up in the rehearsal room. Various members would come up with tunes and lyrics and we’d write them up.\n\nWOODY: We had this big flipchart thing and people came in with a song and wrote up the title, so we had this big list. Then we’d turn the piece of paper over and say, ‘Right, first song: What are the chords?’ So someone would write the chords down, and them someone else would say, ‘So how does it go?’ And it was just bosh, done.\n\nMIKE: I started writing down the songs on the board, and scribbling all these quite complicated chord changes just to keep track. Where our early stuff had been riff-based, it all became much more complicated on Absolutely.\n\nSUGGS: We didn’t really have time to think about it. I remember after it was done we were off on tour and I got given a cassette of it as we were getting on a plane to Japan. And that was the first time I’d heard it finished.\n\nBEDDERS: We’d worked very, very hard while we were touring and bedded in a lot of the songs while we were still playing live. So things like Baggy Trousers and Embarrassment were virtually ready to go by the time we got to the studios, with any problems ironed out.\n\nCHRIS: E.R.N.I.E and On The Beat Pete were also pretty polished from being played live, so they were easy ones to record too.\n\nWOODY: The only thing was, we had to relearn the songs again after we heard the album because it was like, ‘Oh, you put a bit of keyboard there, I didn’t know we’d done that.’\n\nCARL: We didn’t even pick any of the singles as it was coming out so quickly.\n\nCHRIS: Although it was finished in a relatively short time, it was an enjoyable experience. I’d just bought a Fender Stratocaster from Woody’s brother, Nick, and had discovered the joys of the tremolo arm.\n\nSUGGS: We were very conscious of not making a carbon copy of our debut. Like The Specials, we were aware we needed to move on with each album. We’d spent five years carving our own little niche, then 2-Tone came and it was great, but we didn’t want to latch onto something, find the bandwagon off the rails and end up labelled as just another ska band. So Absolutely painted a more accurate picture of us as we tried to move away from all that stuff. All these old influences that had been piling up in our heads – rock ‘n’ roll, prog rock, R’n’B, Ian Dury – started to filter through instead.\n\nBEDDERS: Although rehearsed and recorded with indecent haste, it was a very important album. Not only did it move us away from being a one-trick 2-Tone band, it built the foundations of a lot to come. The chart hits and songs like Overdone showed a different side.\n\nWOODY: It was certainly a step forward – I learned how to spell Embarrassment, found the perfect fire extinguisher for a bell on Baggy Trousers and got my first songwriting credit on Los Palmas 7.\n\nBEDDERS: I wasn’t ill while we were making it, but thought I should have been because of the non-stop round of touring, TV and travel. My suitcase was my best friend, and any home life was spent staring into a washing machine.\n\nLEE: I remember that Robbo bored us to death with the reasons why the album should be called Baggy Trousers…\n\nCHRIS: …but in the end it was named after a saying by our then sound man, tour manager and driver, Tony Duffield.\n\nLEE: Ha! That’s right; whenever we asked him something, he’d go, ‘Yeah man, absolutely, absolutely.’\n\nCHRIS: Actually, I heard a rumour that, after working with us, Tony was with Yazoo and their album, You And Me Both, was named after another of his sayings.\n\nLEE: Clive and Alan were like our George Martins, making everything work. They’d say stuff like, ‘Lee, don’t play 30 notes when ten will do when you do the sax solo on Close Escape.’ I’d thought, ‘We’re doing our second album, ooh, my IQ’s gone up… me arse!’ So I had this big jazzy solo planned out but on their advice, I made the solo simple instead.\n\nCLIVE LANGER: Basically, I always had a love of the perfect pop record and so they let me get on with this one. I think Mike definitely cottoned on early and then they all did. They were smart.\n\nDAVE ROBINSON: They were great fun, and all of them had something going on – I mean they were good.\n\nBEDDERS: I’m always amazed by how disciplined we were. Someone said we rehearsed like the German football team – it was very worked out and meticulous.\n\nWOODY: It’s much more aware than One Step Beyond. I think we’d become much more aware of our surroundings and our actual feelings. I think side two does show it more. We didn’t mean to be deep and meaningful, but it was much more realistic than the common image we had at that time; it was the closest to us.\n\nCHRIS: When we were doing the album, Clive Langer said: ‘Oh, you should put a sitar on this’, and I was thinking, ‘How am I going to play one of those?’ But in fact it’s like a conventional guitar, although the pickups are different. It’s like a really wacky shape because I think it was made in the 60s. All those old Motown records have a sitar, like Band Of Gold. It’s very dead: if you pick a note it doesn’t resonate for as long as a guitar. Clive Larger actually bought one because we were always hiring them. I went on to use it on a lot of our records. In fact I used it later on Shut Up – that was the thing that was feeding back.\n\nMIKE: Absolutely really had that distinctive Madness sound. We were attempting to develop it and there were some changes – for one thing we could play better by then. It was more tuneful, with more melodies, but it was still what you’d call a city sound. That’s because all the songs were written about experiences in London, where we came from.\n\nCHRIS: For the cover, we decided to take a picture outside our beloved Camden Town tube station, but were unable to because of the pedestrian barrier outside the entrance, so we had to settle for Chalk Farm instead. We had a final choice of two photos from the session; one the band liked, one Dave Robinson liked. So I said, ‘Let’s do two covers.’ Which we did. I think there are always more of the Robbo cover as we’d get asked to sign them all the time. In retrospect, I think he did pick the better picture.\n\nBEDDERS: It’s certainly our best pop album, and I think most of the band agree. It’s definitely my favourite Madness record.\n\nLEE: Absolutely is my favourite album memories-wise, and my favourite album overall. It was all quite good fun and I remember reading in Melody Maker that it had bits of Ian Dury, The Kinks, Small Faces, Squeeze and even a touch of The Beatles in there. So I was like, ‘Wow!’ Once you get five stars in there, it’s going to rub off on the music-buying public. I was very, very happy with it. I didn’t realise it would get the five-star reviews that it got. But, without blowing me own trumpet, it wasn’t surprising, because it had that mood about it. When we’d play that stuff live, it was very enjoyable, and listening back to it now, it’s still very enjoyable.\n\nCHRIS: I actually listened to it a while ago because I’d always imagined it to be really good but it was bloody awful. Everything’s really fast and off-beat. Our third album – 7 – that was where we really changed.\n\nSUGGS: Round about this time was one of the best periods. We didn’t really have a single, so we went in a little rehearsal room and Mike had this song called the Chemist Facade which went on to become House of Fun. He also had a song called The Drive-In Song which became Driving in My car and Lee had written Embarrassment. In a week we did these three songs and they’d just come out of nowhere.\n\nBEDDERS: The focus was always around Mike’s piano – everyone would stand round it with songs and ideas.\n\nMIKE: In some ways, you’d only have to come in with a half-baked idea of just a couple of chords or something and then everyone would work it and get together and it would become something of interest. It was definitely a group effort. We all contributed something to the songs and rehearsed in the studio for three weeks before actually recording.\n\nWOODY: We were all different in our songwriting abilities – each person wrote to their strengths. I mean, I can only write music, I am not a great lyricist and I don’t find any great inspiration for lyrics, so I just write a tune down and put a few chords together. Mark’s done the same thing – Lee does a bit of both.\n\nCHRIS: Lee used to write with Mike a lot and also even with Woody. Mike is one of those people who, if Lee used to give him a lyric, he’d read them out and say he could really think of a tune.\n\nMIKE: Lee always used to be writing lyrics, and often he would give me some on a bit of paper and then usually I would write a tune to it. I often had to dodgy about a little bit because the way he wrote was very incomprehensible.\n\nLEE: With Mike, I’d have some lyrics and have a completely different tune in mind when I’d written it out. So for Embarrassment, the tune I had for that was Ghost Dance by Prince Buster. I had that sort of melody in mind. And when it came out it was more like a 60s Motown number, which was quite nice.\n\nSUGGS: The thing is, Woody could write songs that are completely Woody – you can’t imagine them being a Madness song. But then you get Lee’s words on top of them, and then you get all of us playing it, taking out all the difficult bits that Woody puts in with his fiddly little bloody synthesiser, and then you get Madness at the end of it. Everybody has their own way of doing it – some of us write music and words, some just words, some just music.\n\nWOODY: A lot of the band are very talented in the kind of theatrical line of things. And they’ve got great ideas as well, like it’s really good. But you’ve got to remember that there’s seven of us, so the balance is perfect.\n\nLEE: Of course, when my sister had Hayley, the baby that it’s all about, all the bad feeling just fell away. My mum and dad were all over her and were forever babysitting. She’s gorgeous now – intelligent, attractive… you wouldn’t want to change a thing.\n\nTRACY THOMPSON (Lee’s sister): I feel really proud of that song. Attitudes have changed without a doubt.\n\nWOODY: I remember Mark Knopfler reviewing it on [Radio One] Roundtable at the time and he said the English wasn’t very good. I think he missed the point. Lee’s lyrics get the message across in a very effective way. It’s not correct English, but it’s a very moving, beautiful song… and people forget that.\n\nSUGGS: It’s a great lyric – really sensational. You couldn’t believe such sensitivity could come from such a rough diamond, but Lee is one of the best lyricists of his time. We were having trouble with people associating us with the NF, so it was nice to establish, once and for all, that we weren’t.\n\nMIKE: Lee is a very good lyricist. Sometimes when I get some of Lee’s lyrics, then it’s quite easy to come up with something quite interesting to go with and that was the case then. But I don’t know where he gets his ideas from, beats me, y’know, but it all comes out of Lee, he’s a mystery. What’s going on in there?\n\nCHRIS: For the B-side, I was going for a Mexican Tijuana-type feel and I quite surprised myself. In those days you had to get in quick with a solo or Thommo and Mike would be all over the shop.\n\nSUGGS (speaking in 1980): We want people to listen to our LPs, but because they are pretty varied, Stiff like putting out a couple of singles from each one, just to give people an idea. The record company has proved to us that this is the only way to sell an LP of new songs. If we didn’t agree to it we’d have flopped by now. We always put a different B-side at least.\n\nCHRIS: This video for Embarrassment was a bit different as we’d started separating Suggs from the band a bit, getting him wearing a different colour suit etc.\n\nMIKE: The video was a bit dark and moody for my tastes.\n\nCARL: It was a bit dull and unimaginative.\n\nCHRIS: I’m not sure if people got the significance of Mike being blacked up at the end.\n\nLEE: I don’t really remember much about shooting it; I think it was all shot in the same bar. I do remember we weren’t allowed to touch the drinks – in fact, I think they marked the optics to see if anything had been taken."
