        "text": "8. Herrenhandtasche (1995)\n\nFollowing the success of Uuaarrgh!, Wizo quickly got back to the studio and recorded this mini-album (7 minutes shorter than the next shortest Wizo release), and it turned out to be the last album by the band’s original ‘classic’ trio of members.\n\nAlthough the album contains 10 tracks, 2 of them are short gap-fillers, and 1 is a cover (“Poupée de Cire”), meaning there are only 7 original songs for the entire release.\n\nFor the most part, this is still a solid album. “9247” and “Closet” are both fast and catchy songs, while “Quadrat im Kreis” is a depressing take on personal issues and “Herrenhandtasche” and “Brief/Telefon/Tür” round things out as simple fun, nonsense songs.\n\nCompared to the band’s first 3 albums, there’s a noticeable lack of political tracks on Herrenhandtasche — this is likely due to the issues they had encountered with the German government regarding a particular song on their debut.\n\nIf you’re a fan of the band, this is a good release that you’re sure to enjoy, but it’s just relatively short, containing only 4 songs sung in German (although the English-sung songs are better than usual for the band).\n\nRecommended Tracks: Closet / 9247 / Poupée de Cire\n\n7. Bleib Tapfer (1992)\n\nFresh off the heels of their debut, the trio returned with their sophomore follow-up, Bleib Tapfer (which means “stay brave”), continuing down a path similar to what their debut initially laid.\n\nStylistically diverse, Bleib Tapfer never comes across as repetitive or exhaustive — always finding new songwriting techniques to apply. The band’s expansive musical variety (especially on their first 4 albums) really helped them to stand out from so many others who went for a more direct approach.\n\nThe record begins fast and energetic with the short “Bei Dir” before shifting into “Mein Tod” and its 80s metal-influenced intro. Following the focus on death that “Mein Tod” brings, we’ve got “Nice Day” and its chorus “it’s a nice day to die today”. An interesting 1–2 punch of death.\n\nThe title track provides some excellent folkiness and “Es Ist Vorbei” brings some slower ballad-esque style into the mix, but the album’s real highlight is “Alte Frau”. Again, This song mixes in some heavy metal style and even gives me a slight Rammstein vibe (and this was before Rammstein was even a band).\n\nThe album continues to end strong with the super fun and catchy “Leichen” and the fast (metal-tinged) “Nix & Niement”.\n\nBleib Tapfer was an excellent follow-up to an already excellent debut and just another example of why Wizo is Germany’s greatest punk band.\n\nRecommended Tracks: Alte Frau / Bei Dir / Bleib Tapfer\n\n6. für’n Arsch (1991)\n\nThis is how you make a debut record. It’s honestly wild how excellent and diverse this debut is, especially considering that it was released in 1991 in Germany.\n\nFür’n Arsch set the tone for the band right from the beginning, and they didn’t really mettle with what worked throughout the band’s existence — diverse songs (musically and lyrically) that feature terrific musicianship and a signature guitar tone (kind of trebly and not nearly as thick as other contemporaries) and a very specific gallopy strum style.\n\nI think the fact that this wasn’t coming out of California is a big reason why it stands apart from so much else that was being released at the time, incorporating more local influences into the band’s overall sound.\n\nBeginning strong with the fast “Diese Welt” (which makes excellent use of some ska-like upstrokes in the verses), the album continues this same level of quality throughout the entire runtime.\n\nAfter the intro track, the tempo tends to go up and down fluidly, a credit to great sequencing. There are other fast tracks like “Goodbye” and “Kein Gerede”, the latter of which was accused of inciting terrorism, forcing the band to later release it without vocals (it works surprisingly well even as an instrumental). “Jupp” is still probably the fastest song the band has written, ready to burst out of its seams at any moment.\n\n“Gute Freunde”, “Selenbrant”, and “Sylvia” all provide that mid-tempo rock that Wizo are so good at, while “Walter” uses a 12-string acoustic to bring some German folkiness into the mix and “K.i.k. III” comes entirely out of the left field with its use of organ and a full-on orchestra — sounding like a bit of a medieval/baroque song.\n\nThe album even has a Ramones-style song with “U2B Ma Girl” (arguably the album’s weakest track). Then there’s “Unemployed” which sounds like a whimsical punkified version of a Disney song. While enjoyable, these 2 songs make it clear the band sounds best when they stick to their native German.\n\nRecommended Tracks: Diese Welt / Kein Gerede / Gute Freunde\n\n5. Anderster (2004)\n\nAfter a nine-year break, the band returned with what is decidedly their most varied and weirdest album yet. Consisting of 14 tracks, Anderster is at times a punk record, but more often it diverges into whatever territory Axel Kurth finds himself wanting to explore.\n\nRecorded over a 4-year period between 2000–2004, Anderster gives the impression that it’s more of a compilation of b-sides rather than a proper full-length album. This is partially true as the band was somewhat already done by the time this was released (they officially broke up the following year) and many of the songs were completed almost entirely by Axel.\n\nThere’s a noticeable improvement in the album’s production compared to their first 4 albums, showing Kurth’s growth as a producer. As the main man in the studio, he makes it clear that any style or instrument is open for use when writing songs.\n\nThere are some solid, more straightforward punk songs in “Nana,” “Jimmy” (which displays Axel’s growth in melodic vocalizing), “Raumgleita,” and the record’s only English song, “Miss Pickafight.”\n\nThe highlight of the album is “Chezus” a track that mashes together punk, a little bit of upstroke guitar, and even some hip-hop flow into the bridge while maintaining a catchy bassline throughout. “Unsichtbare Frau” is probably the band’s danciest number ever, with a hook that quickly gets stuck in your head.\n\nThe album gets plenty creative as it hits on the blues with the organ-led “Schlau, versaut und gutaussehend”, some German folk on “Heut Nacht”, and, of course, “Egon,” which sounds like it could fit on the soundtrack to a kid’s Halloween movie.\n\nAnderster has some excellent highs, yet also noticeable misses like “Phlughaphöm” where it’s quite apparent that Axel put the whole thing together alone (the drums are pretty disappointingly basic). Overall, I still love the record, but I wish it would’ve felt more like a full band, rather than just Axel polishing up demos from the past years.\n\nRecommended Tracks: Chezus / Jimmy / Unsichtbare Frau\n\n4. Der (2016)\n\nArriving only 2 years after their surprising 2014 comeback record, the succinctly titled Der finds the band sounding refreshed and nimble. It seems that the trio were meshing well at the time because all the tracks give off a very natural vibe, the songs coming easily. It’s clearly apparent that the band was enjoying their time recording in the studio.\n\nDer opens strong with “Adagio,” a track that isn’t nearly as fast or heavy as most of their opening songs but instead goes for a huge and, dare I say, epic approach. From there, the album moves to the fast-paced “Wahlkrampf” before entering traditional Wizo territory with “Verwesung” and its distinct guitar riffs.\n\n“Bierboot” starts unassuming before bursting into a huge chorus, which I think particularly works because the song is sung in German. The catchy and melodic “Déja Vu” reminds you why Wizo is revered as much as they are, as the song is just so effortlessly rhythmic.\n\nIn typical Wizo fashion, the album veers into some non-punk territory, like the Carribean-esque “Apocalypso” or the slow, outro ballad “Hässliche Punker”.\n\nNever shy of getting political, the band once again hits on the topic of Naziism with the anthemic “Antifa” and “Wahrheit”, the latter even drawing a little from their past hit “Raum Der Zeit”.\n\nEven if the album’s subject matter is fairly serious and direct, this is still the most joyful I think Wizo has ever sounded, Axel seems like he’s enjoying himself during every song.\n\nAlthough I think there are better Wizo records, it’s still in the mix, and with a relatively shorter runtime, no filler tracks get in the way of your listening experience.\n\nRecommended Tracks: Déja Vu / Wahrheit / Verwesung\n\n3. Nichts wird wieder gut (2023)\n\nContinuing the band’s trend of (somewhat) surprise releasing a new album after several years of dormant silence, Nichts Wird Wieder Gut was quietly released at the tail-end of 2023.\n\nDuring my first couple of listens (which happened to be while I was in the Frankfurt airport), I immediately enjoyed it. Still, I felt that it could have been more varied compared to previous releases. Now that more time has passed, I can confidently say this is some of the band’s finest work. In fact, third place even feels too low for how terrific this record is, but I also can’t move the top 2.\n\nArguably the band’s most straightforward album, the record rarely wanders outside of their more typical punk-styled tracks, beginning with the heavy-hitting “Grauer Brei” which is then followed up by the instantly catchy title track. Both songs feature some of band’s best percussion work (really working that double-bass) and “Nichts wird wieder gut” delivers that signature fast sing-talk vocals on the verses. This song has already become one of my favorites of the band’s discography.\n\nWizo does deviate from the heavier punk tracks here and there, like on the Beach Boys-esque “Schönheit des Verfalls”, the hard rock “Egal was kommt”, or the ska-like “Prokrastination”.\n\nWhat I appreciate most about the record is that, at 13 songs, it’s only 1 of 2 Wizo records where there just isn’t any filler. Sure, some songs are undeniably better than others, like the breezy and catchy “Mörderin” or the get-off-your-feet-and-move “Earlybird”, but there genuinely isn’t a weak spot to be found on the record.\n\nTo put it short, this was one of the best releases of 2023 and a continuing testament to Wizo’s greatness as a long-running band.\n\nRecommended Tracks: Nichts wird wieder gut / Grauer Brei / Zucker und Fett\n\n2. Uuaarrgh! (1994)\n\nLike many outside of Europe, Uuaarrgh! was my entry point into Wizo, as it was their first album to be released in the USA. While some bands need time to appreciate, with Uuaarrgh! I was immediately hooked on Wizo and began searching out their other material.\n\nThe album’s original release was a 25-track, hour-long behemoth that fully displayed the band’s unwavering ability to tackle nearly any musical style they decided upon. The release on FAT condensed the album down to 13 songs, cutting 7 actual songs and 5 short non-songs (mostly intro tracks).\n\nFor the most part, the FAT release kept the best songs, although I would’ve replaced “W8Ing 4 U” with the far superior “Überflüssig” — an energy-soaked punk song with a great guitar riff.\n\nAlthough the album contains many of the band’s classic all-time songs like “Kopfschuss” and “Schlecte Laune”, there is one song that immediately stands out from the rest — “Raum Der Zeit”.\n\n30 years later, and “Raum Der Zeit” may still be the band’s best song. From the flange-drum intro to the chanting bridge, it’s a track that’s instantly catchy and memorable, grabbing your attention and never letting go.\n\nWith such a long runtime, the band plays around with much more than just punk. There’s a stab at hard rock with “Sterbehilfe”. “Hey Thomas” and “Das Goldene Stück” allow for some ballad magic while “Die Letzte Sau” sounds like some slow German, goth rock. The outro song “K.O.” even hits on some 80s metal with (I’m guessing) either Jörn or Karlheinz singing lead.\n\nFor such a long album, the songs are surprisingly consistent, with only a couple throwaway tracks like “Just Go” with its embarrassingly bad lyrics (1 of 4 songs sung in English).\n\nEven after 30 years, Uuaarrgh! It still holds up as one of Wizo’s best albums and, honestly, one of the best punk records of the 90s.\n\nRecommended Tracks: Raum Der Zeit / Tod Im Freibad / Hund\n\n1. Punk gibt’s nicht umsonst! (Teil III) (2014)\n\nI still remember how stoked I was when this was surprise-released in 2014, a whole 10 years since the band’s previous release, Anderster. Punk gibt’s nicht umsonst! (Teil III) also happens to be released exactly 20 years after the band’s breakthrough record, Uuaarrgh!. As such, I believe Axel was attempting to make a sort of sequel to that record by using similar album artwork and again stuffing the release full of songs — making it the band’s longest record yet.\n\nEven though this is technically a Wizo record, in reality, it’s more of a solo release by Axel since over half of the 19 songs are performed by Kurth alone, and only 5 feature a full band. If there was any question before, Punk gibt’s nicht umsonst! (Teil III) makes it abundantly clear that Axel IS Wizo.\n\nDespite the album’s long runtime, it’s still mostly hit after hit with only a little lull near the album’s center.\n\n“Seegurke” is arguably the band’s best album opener, immediately making it clear that not only is Wizo back, but they’re sounding better than ever. Following the opener is another banger in “Scheissefresser” (the best track on the album to feature the whole band).\n\nOnce again setting their sights on fighting Nazism, “Ganz klar gegen Nazis” is a powerhouse of track — big, catchy, and lyrically sound while “Kein Empfang” allows Axel to play around with a little reggae using a bass line similar to The Clash’s “Guns of Brixton”.\n\nAxel even manages to write an old school Oi song with “Unpoliddisch”, singing it with gruff, deeper vocals to really give the song that old-fashioned feel.\n\nThe band has often played around with acoustic songs before, but “Meine Wut” has got to be their best, applying layered vocals to make it very full sounding.\n\nThe fact is, this album is an absolute powerhouse that never disappoints and it’s honestly one of the best comeback albums of all time."
