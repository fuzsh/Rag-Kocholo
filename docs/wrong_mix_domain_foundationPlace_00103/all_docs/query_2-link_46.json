        "text": "Mercedes’ Factory of the Future\n\nMercedes’ new assembly plant sets standards for flexibility, efficiency, sustainability and digital production.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz assembly plant in Sindelfingen, Germany, has seen a lot of change during more than a century of operation.\n\nRead More\n\nWhat’s New With Rotary Indexers\n\nServo indexing and flexibility drive numerous assembly applications.\n\nOne of the simplest devices for partially automating an assembly process is a rotary indexing table. This device consists of a circular steel plate and a drive for turning it.\n\nRead More\n\nSmart Transport System Enables Flexible Assembly\n\nA linear-motor transport system is the heart of a new, flexible automated assembly system.\n\nIndustry 4.0 concepts necessitate highly flexible and modular production equipment. A good example is the new CresaLine small-parts assembly system from Swiss machine builder and integrator Credimex AG.\n\nRead More\n\nNew Technologies for 3D Vision\n\nA wide range of 3D vision systems optimizes robot accuracy when performing random bin picking, error-proofing assemblies or dispensing adhesives.\n\nA gentle nudge is often a more effective way to bring out the best in a worker than a firm push. Two common scenarios where this approach applies are just-hired workers and veteran ones that need to learn a new task.\n\nRead More"
