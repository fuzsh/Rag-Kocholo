        "text": "OK, so I figure that we as disc golfers are generally a bit more in tune to music than the people I chat with on my quilting and embroidery forum, so I want an opinion (or 2).\n\nI personally think that the first Boston album is the greatest Classic Rock album of all time. BTW, I am not some huge Boston fan, in fact I don't even own the 2nd or 3rd album (and no one on the planet besides the band members own the 4th album).\n\nMy reasoning is this, that album is the only one I can think of that still gets pretty regular airplay of every song on it on your average 'classic rock' station. Besides the standards like More than a Feeling, Peace of Mind (maybe the greatest outro in Rock N Roll history), and Long Time, you still hear Smokin, Rock N Roll Band, Hitch a Ride, and Let Me Take You Home Tonight. The one song that gets the least amount of airplay is prolly Something About You, and that is (IMO) the best song on the album.\n\nNow, granted, what some jackass program director at WPUD wants to play isn't necessarily indicative of a great song, but every where around the country I've been, that album gets a lot of play.\n\nI'm sure people will talk about Dark Side of the Moon (wake me when it's over), Zep 2 or Zep 4 (I'd choose Zep 2 if I had to pick just one), and maybe Layla (great album but a few dry spots), but name me another non-greatest-hits album that gets as much play out of every single song on it.\n\nAccording to infoplease, Boston is the 10th best selling album of all time, at 17 million copies. Not that that means anything tho, since Hootie and the Blowfish are right behind them at 16 million. You think they'll be playing Let Her Cry in 10 years? Yeah, right.\n\nMan, I can't wait till football season comes, I must be bored.\n\nWell, besides any Zep album from the first to Physical Graffiti I would have to go with the Rolling Stones Let It Bleed and Sticky Fingers albums. I like the Sticky Fingers album more that LIB myself.\n\nI would not personally chose Boston because I still have a stigma against the way they came out with their 1st album and then toured it for like 3 years before another album came out. Back in that day most bands put out at least 1 album per year (Ted Nugent 3 a year all the same sound ). Then after all the anticipation they never really put anything else decent out(maybe Amanda). Because they used that strategy it caused the radio stations to dig deeper into the album then any other ones so everyone finally became familiar with every song. Not that they aren't good but many other classic rock albums are great all the way through, you just rarely ever get a chance to find out unless you buy it and listen to it over and over until you get used to all the songs. Led Zepplin 4 was close in airplay and is solid. Come on now with the Pink Floyd comments, EVERYONE knows you couldn't sleep through Dark Side without waking up during the beginning of \"Time\" and all the alarm clocks going off :D:D:D\n\nThat being said I will put forth either The Who \"Who's Next\" which is solid all the way through but only about 4 songs got overplay and some others got very little play, especially \"Getting in Tune\"(best according to me) and that says alot compared to the mega hits you still hear everyday on the radio. :D\n\nAnother toss out is Dire Straits, \"Brothers in Arms\" this is maybe a bit later for Classic rock but is solid all the way through as was their previous album \"Making Movies\". /msgboard/images/graemlins/smirk.gif\n\nMy own personal bias is for Peter Gabriel, all of his songs but he's not for everyone ... only those with really refined listening abilities and discriminating taste :o/msgboard/images/graemlins/ooo.gif :D :cool:\n\nPizza God\n\nThe Who - Who's Next or Tommy\n\nThe Beatles - Sgt Peppers or Revolver may be Abby Road\n\nPink Floyd - The Wall or Dark Side of the moon (take off Money)\n\nJimi Hendrix - Live at Monteray (actually, if you listen to Jimi, you have to listen to live stuff, it is way better than anything he did in studio)\n\ni cant chose ONE great rock album, ALL of hendrix albums, zep 2 and 4 are steller, and of course so is DArk SIde of the moon, with all these great albums im glad i have a CD burner and i make my own greatest rock album ever, every thing from cream to zz top\n\nAll great choices, so far I agree that everything named is definately top shelf especially Floyd, Beatles, & Stones .. But Hootie and the Bullfish ... NO Way\n\nBy the way do you remember on the radio when they played Pink Floyd \"Money\" the couldn't say the real lines so they changed the radio version to say \" Don't give me that goo good good bullFISH\" ... I do :eek:\n\nrhett\n\nWhat a timely topic! I just heard \"More than a feelin'\" for the first time in forever this weekend, and was thinking \"dang, this is stilla darn good song.\" Being a disc golfer, I've always been a little anti-establishment so the overkill of airplay back in the day pretty much turned me off of Boston. But that is a great album, and I just might buy it now for the first time. :)\n\nNow, for contenders I don't think airplay should have anything to do with it. Otherwise it becomes a \"best top-40ish classic rock-ey album\". Of Boston would still be up there. :)\n\nI submit for your critique: Guns -n- Roses Appetite for Destruction. While it came out way later than the classic rock era, it captures the sound better than any of the boring formulaic bands of the late 70s did. (That boring formula, IMHO, spurred punk rock on because punk was energetic and the \"AOR\" of the time was like pop music now: down.)\n\nGnR rocks hard and rocks heavy, all the way through.\n\nKarma Police\n\nBeatles-Revolver. Although I never really considered them 'classic rock' but others have them down. Overall I can't stand most classic rock. Pretty much a Radiohead junkie.\n\nRocco, my respect for you has just gone up leaps and bounds.\n\nSTONES, MAN! LIB and SF are two of the greatest albums ever recorded. (Mick Taylor's guitar work on SF still stands the test of time, and Monkey Man on LIB is the absolute sheite.)\n\nOf course, I've found a new respect for Dan too, even though he roots for the wrong footbal team (way wrong). Boston's first album is pretty much what made me want to be a rock vocalist. Yes, I was very inspred by Robert Plant, Janis Joplin and even Elton John (watch it buster) as far as vocal stylings. But, the sheer magnitude of Boston's vibe and the whole Rockstar thing they had going on made me want to be a part of it.\n\nI saw 'em 3 times on 3 different tours. My first concert ever was Boston (in support of Don't Look Back) with Sammy Hagar opening (still the only opening act I've ever seen called back out for THREE encores).\n\nWhen the 40' pipe organ rose outta the floor of the stage for Tom Scholz to use on Foreplay/Long Time it was an epiphany for me.\n\nNow, I don't like to limit my musical influences and if I was to list all the artists/songs/albums/concerts that have inspired me during my long trek as a professional (now very retired) musician, it would be a post so wordy that it would even make Nicky say, \"****, that's a long post.\" But the two artists and 3 albums already mentioned in the first two posts of this thread, even as radically different as they are, had a lot to do with defining me as a fan and a musician.\n\nSee further posts on this thread for more of my classic rock babble. I can't contain it to merely one post. :)\n\nI'm not a big fan of classic rock. In fact, for a long time, I didn't believe that there was a single good song recorded before 1980 :)\n\nHaving said that: here's my favorites in no real order...\n\nPink Floyd - Dark Side of the Moon\n\nMeat Loaf - Bat Out Of Hell\n\nBruce Springsteen - Born To Run\n\nKansas - Leftoverture\n\nRush - Moving Pictures\n\njunnila\n\nWhite Album...nuf said\n\npterodactyl\n\nBoston was too much \"studio\" sounding. Although I did like the album cover with the upside-down spaceship guitars.\n\nZiggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars by Bowie is my favorite (just doesn't get the air play).\n\nRadiohead rules the CD player now, however!\n\nLyle O Ross\n\nGums n Roses? Surely you jest. I grew up with them and even I know better. Might as well just throw in Thriller. Or better yet something by Phil Collins. Oh wait wait, Smammy Haggar. Doesn't he make cheap slacks when he isn't with Van Halo? Wasn't it Valerie that said her hubby was the best guitarist that ever lived? Guess she never heard Jimmy H. play or for that matter Eric.\n\nCan't believe there isn't a vote for the White Album. Of course I didn't look too close maybe there is. Let it Be was too over stylized. There was hardly any Beatles left by the time they got done. Have to go with Sgt. Pepper's. This is with full acknowledgement of Led and the Stones; but they still don't match up to the best of the Beatles. Pink Floyd The Wall comes close but only because of its impact. I also like the Eagles Hotel California and Long Run but they aren't truly up to par with Sgt. Pepper's.\n\nOh by the way. In terms of theme albums, Boston ain't bad but what about Allan Parson's Project. Remember I Robot?\n\nLest you think I am fixated on the 60s (and early 70s), it is a pity to leave out Nirvana Nevermind and Pearl Jam 10. Don't forget U2 The Joshua Tree and REM had some good stuff in there too. Peter Gabrial was pretty good also. Yes, I know these are after the \"Classic Rock\" era but they are nonetheless - Classic.\n\nLyle O Ross\n\nI spoke too soon! This album is one of the best unrecognized albums of all time. It just never got all the credit it deserved.\n\njunnila\n\nWay underrated, A Day in the Life is the best song ever recorded. I would also have to vote for Axis Bold As Love, although I agree Hendrix along with everything else is better live.\n\nLook, me and Bryan agreeing wholeheartedly on something. :)\n\nSee, we can get along. :)\n\nOne thing that I failed to mention in my first post, when thinking about Rocco's take on Sticky Fingers, was Who's next.\n\nI meant to include it, but instead of editing my post, what the heck, one more post out of 4300ish won't hurt.\n\nThe one thing that I find interesting about Sticky Fingers, other than it being one of the greatest rock 'n roll albums of all time, is that it might not even be the best rock 'n roll album that came out that year! 1971 gave us both Sticky Fingers and The Who's, Who's Next.\n\nName a track and I can guarantee you've heard it before on the radio. Yes, even My Wife, with the Ox on vocals and 5:15 (outta my brain on a train). One of the earliest \"multi-hit\" rock albums, Who's Next was a triumph in songwriting.\n\nDan, if you've got a problem sleeping through Dark Side of the Moon, you indeed have a problem :)\n\nThe White Album is my favorite Beatles album but when I think of Classic Rock I don't put the Beatles in that catagory. I believe they were making music before music started \"rocking\". This is one reason I didn't list Exile on Main Street. It is a classic album but the whole feel of the album is not rock. It is more bluesy. Pterodactyl, I was really close to listing Ziggy myself. That album is great.\n\nI had Appetite For Destruction on my short list as well, Rhett, it's still (and prolly will be for a long time) one of the best ever.\n\nI forgot about Who's Next, that would be close in the 'almost every song getting airplay' category.\n\nI couldn't think of a Stones album that was great from top to bottom, they always had a clunker or 2 in there it seemed. Same with the Beatles, as much as I love the White Album and Sgt Pepper.\n\nIf Boston seemed too 'studio' sounding, keep in mind that Tom Scholz invented a lot of the equipment that made that sound, which then got copied by tons of early hair bands (Def Leppard especially). Almost every budding guitarist started out with a Rockman (at least those of us with neighbors did), and nothing ever sounded better than my cheap Fender Squire plugged into the Rockman with the distortion and echo turned way up thru my headphones.\n\nMark, is it me, or did it seem like Brad Delp could hit high notes that only dogs could hear?\n\nOh, here's a couple more to kick around, not really 'classic rock', but what about Scorpions - Love at First Sting, and in a more Southern genre, Lynyrd Skynyrd - Pronounced?\n\nLyle O Ross\n\nThe problem with Lynyrd is that song about hitting on under age groupies in Idaho. Even Freebird is about running out on your wife. Never could respect the band.\n\nThe problem with Lynyrd is that song about hitting on under age groupies in Idaho. Even Freebird is about running out on your wife. Never could respect the band.\n\nUmm...no, Freebird was written about Duane Allman after he died.\n\nslo\n\n5:15 was on Quadrophenia, dude.\n\nBut why even vote for 'greatest' when everybody knows that is, and will always be, \"Sgt. Pepper\"?!? Even a rag as clueless a Rolling Stone can figure that one out...\n\n... as for BEST album, another vote for \"Who's Next\"...still the high water mark for rock n roll, in my opinion...after listening to it for close to 33 years, I STILL get goosebumps in the drum/synth interplay leading to the climax/Daltry's scream. By the way, this was the first rock n roll album to feature synthesisers, provided by the indubitably talented Pete Townsend.\n\nThe BEST Beatles album is \"Revolver,\" but only in the English [Epiphone] version...but that's the one released on cd, anyways.\n\nThis is not about \"best ever\". No need to regurgitate those lists made leading into the year 2000.\n\nIf I were to following Dan's criteria, \"classic rock/most radio airtime\", I couldn't answer that because I don't routinely listen to those stations. My LP collection is over 2,200 - why limit what I listen to by what's fed me over the \"classic rock\" airwaves? There are better options if I'm stuck in traffic.\n\nWho's Next is a good challenge to Dan's Boston LP, and it's MUCH higher on the Greatest Ever list.\n\nSure, I was groovin' to Boston back then, too (MMMmmmmm, lumbo), but I knew better.\n\n8 yrs. old in '69, listening to Hendrix, Stones, Zep.....ahh, yes, my formative years...\n\nBecause of that grounding, I never saw Boston as legitamate, especially since they weren't able to replicate their sound on stage.\n\nWhat were we talkin' 'bout ?\n\nWhat LPs gets worn out on Classic Rock Radio AND aren't totally crap?\n\nVan Halen\n\nFly Like An Eagle\n\nHotel California\n\nBorn In The USA\n\nThe Joshua Tree/War\n\nStranger In Town\n\nBrothers In Arms by J. Geils\n\nHair Of The Dog :cool:\n\n*I will avoid drifting into the likes of Never Mind The Bollocks, London Calling and \"Ramones\"/Leave Home/Rocket To Russia/Road To Ruin.............................................. ..........................................!\n\nlarrywhitson\n\nFor those voting for \"Who's Next,\" check out a recent rerelease on CD that includes several additional songs and additional liner notes. Seems this project was originally designed to be a full-blown theatrical presentation like \"Tommy\" and \"Quadraphenia\" but got scaled back (I don't recall the reason off the top of my head). I believe the full-blown version was ambitiously titled \"Life.\" But I've slept since I read the notes, so I may have that mixed up with something else!\n\nAnd BTW, every \"classic\" rock album came out before 1980. The year the music died (for a while at least).\n\nGranted, I have pretty mellow tastes compared to those who would vote for GNR, but how about Van Morrison - Moondance?\n\nDylan?\n\nJeez, I'm old.\n\nLW\n\nI was once told Townshend's 1st solo LP had songs intended for that abandoned project.\n\nfrom AMG (http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll) :\n\nWhile the legacy of Tommy would prove formidable, in 1970 Townshend was stumped about how to follow it up. As he worked on new material, the group released Live at Leeds in 1970.... Eventually, he settled on a sci-fi rock opera called Lifehouse, which he intended to be strongly influenced by the teachings of his guru, Meher Baba. Townshend also intended to incorporate electronics and synthesizers on the album, pushing the group into new sonic territory. The remainder of the Who wasn't particularly enthralled with Lifehouse, claiming not to understand its plot, and their reluctance contributed to Townshend suffering a nervous breakdown. Once he recovered, the group picked up the pieces of the now-abandoned Lifehouse project and recorded Who's Next.\n\nThe success of Who's Next prompted Townshend to attempt another opera. This time, he abandoned fantasy in order to sketch a portrait of a '60s mod with Quadrophenia. As he wrote the album in 1972, he released Who Came First, a collection of private recordings and demos he made for Meher Baba.\n\nSlo, thanks for correcting me...dude! :)\n\nI gotta get my turntable fixed so that I can re-familiarize myself with the content of some of these great pieces of vinyl.\n\nSpeaking of Who's Next and Quadrophenia, we could have a whole other thread regarding which was the greatest rock 'n roll scream ever: Daltrey on Love Reign O'er Me or Won't Get Fooled again. My vote is for Won't Get Fooled Again. :)\n\nC-mag, did you ever see Boston live? To replicate what they did in Tom's basement on a big stage was no easy task and I always thought they did a more than credible job. I find myself in the uncomfortable position of defending a band that historically wasn't all that, but I feel they're more important than they get credit for due to the fact that people got worn out on 'em. Next time you're trying to replicate on stage something that you've enhanced through artistic freedom with all the tools available to you in a recording studio, do me a favor and let me know how that works out for you. :)\n\nTrying to single out a best Beatles album is tough since there are so many differences in so many great works. Sgt. Pepper's seems to be the most popular choice, followed by the White Album and Revolver. Myself, I like the sweet melodic nature of Abbey Road and the more raw feel of Let It Be just as much.\n\nPicking one Zepplin album is also tough (not as, though) for similar reasons. I've always been partial to the blusier feel of III, but Physical Graffitti was genius in parts. IV is undeniably one of the more important rock albums of all time, even so.\n\nMaybe, we should try to list our favorite 10 classic rock albums of all time. That would be in my case at least, a lot easier.\n\nmd21954\n\nmy vote for best beatles album is certainly for revolver.\n\ntoo sick of won't get fooled again (tie for world's most popular car commercial w/ that 'bargain' song) for best scream.\n\nbest stone's album? my vote is for exile on main st with sticky fingers and let it bleed close seconds.\n\nyes, I did see them WAY BACK THEN, and they sounded like \"just another band\". Was Boston a fraud? Maybe, but, hey, great LP, great party songs. A notch above April Wine.... :D\n\nLed Zep was able to replicate the studio sounds of Whole Lotta Love and Dazed & Confused on stage. Pink Floyd? Yes. Hendrix ? Sure.\n\nBEST ROCK SCREAMS\n\nIt's a tie :\n\nTED NUGENT - Motor City Madhouse (Double Live Gonzo) yes, Mark, I saw that one too, one of the concerts included on the LP !, and, yes, he replicated !!!) ;)\n\nSISTER MARY ELEPHANT\n\ncircle_2\n\nAll good choices here!\n\nThe first 2 tapes I ever bought for my car stereo were Van Halen I and The Cars Candy O. At 16, that was all I needed to blast out of my Jensen Triaxials of my '69 Mustang!\n\nFor Christmas one year ('78ish?) my folks completely scored when they bought me Kansas' Leftoverture, Boston I, and Styx' The Grand Illusion. Those 3 bring back the memories of Wood and Metal-shop classes in junior high...with the shop-stereo cranked and everyone gettin' into th' groove whilst working on their projects...ahhh...memories! :cool:\n\nMy vote would be for Zepplin's In Through The Out Door...as I have tended to get into the trippiness of many bands' works...\n\noops! I forgot about the Cars 1st LP.\n\nChris Hysell\n\nEither Beastie Boys, License to ILL or Dr. Dre, The Chronic.\n\nWho's Next is a good challenge to Dan's Boston LP, and it's MUCH higher on the Greatest Ever list.\n\nSure, I was groovin' to Boston back then, too (MMMmmmmm, lumbo), but I knew better.\n\n8 yrs. old in '69, listening to Hendrix, Stones, Zep.....ahh, yes, my formative years...\n\nBecause of that grounding, I never saw Boston as legitamate, especially since they weren't able to replicate their sound on stage.\n\nWhat were we talkin' 'bout ?\n\nWhat LPs gets worn out on Classic Rock Radio AND aren't totally crap?\n\nVan Halen\n\nFly Like An Eagle\n\nHotel California\n\nBorn In The USA\n\nThe Joshua Tree/War\n\nStranger In Town\n\nBrothers In Arms by J. Geils\n\nHair Of The Dog :cool:\n\nDude, you're killing me here. Fly Like an Eagle? Steve Miller was the biggest waste of talent on the planet (c'mon, the guy has Les friggin Paul as his guitar teacher and that's the best he can do?)\n\nAny Springsteen fan wouldn't even consider Born in the USA as one of his best efforts, it was an \"I need some quick $$\" record, and pales when compared to Greetings from Asbury Park, Born To Run, or even The River.\n\nHotel California had one great song, 2 pretty good ones, and a bunch of clunkers. Doesn't compete because of the clunker factor.\n\nBrothers in Arms was Dire Straits, for J. Geils I'd pick Full House, one of the top 10 live albums ever put out (featuring Magic Dick and his Lickin Stick on 'Whammer Jammer' of course).\n\nI was never a huge Who fan, so I wouldn't put Who's Next up there with Boston, and I'd prolly put Styx 'Grand Illusion' ahead of it.\n\nNot sure about the best rock scream (If I had to, I'd pick Ian Gillen in Deep Purple's \"Highway Star\"), but the worst has to be Dennis DeYoung in the beginning of Renegade.\n\nscoop\n\nHard to narrow it down to just one for me too...\n\nBut one of my favorites that hasn't been listed yet is Foreigner Four. And I still listen to Molly Hatchett's Greatest Hits every so often.\n\nWhat a coincidence Rooster, I think of a Molly Hatchet song every time I step up to putt. :)\n\njunnila\n\nHow are you gonna say Steve Miller has no talent, the guy has written some classic songs that will be heard for years to come, and that Styx is up there, everyone I know wants to forget Styx ever existed. Even though their songs get airplay, they still suck a big *****. Styx stynx!\n\nIf you're using airplay for the entire album as the criteria then I've got to go with Zeppelin IV as he most \"overplayed\" album of all time with Boston as a real close second.\n\nThe \"Greatest\" classic rock album of all time in my book is Lynyrd Skynyrd Street Survivors but that's what so great about music, there is no right or wrong.\n\nBest rock scream ever is Ian Gillan when he was with Black Sabbath on Born Again.\n\nI won't disagree with you if you are talking about the Dennis DeYoung influenced stuff, he was not my cup of tea. But the Tommy Shaw/James Young stuff was some pretty kicka$$ rock and roll, i.e. Blue Collar Man, Crystal Ball, Too Much Time on My Hands, Miss America, Fooling Yourself, Renegade, Snowblind, etc..\n\nscottsearles\n\nRUSH \"2112\" \"CHRONICLE'S\"\n\nAny \"MONTROSE\"\n\nAC/DC \"If you want blood you got it\" \" H T HELL\"\n\nQueen \"News of the world\"\n\nANY \"YES\"\n\nAnything by \"JOURNEY\" BEFORE \"FERRY PERRY\"\n\nI will take the POOP on this pick these guy's ROCKED before \"PERRY\" IMHO F-ING RUINED them.

Even Freebird is about running out on your wife. Never could respect the band.\n\nUmm...no, Freebird was written about Duane Allman after he died.\n\nThat's the problem with judging art based on content rather than intent. Thanks for the correction.\n\nYou mean that wasn't Billy Idol singing Money For Nothing?* ZOOM - hand passes over head....\n\nThe LPs I listed have NOTHING to do with my personal preferences.\n\nI was merely addressing the topic you put forth at the start of this thread - a list of albums (decent rock artists) which get a lot of airplay on classic radio.\n\nI'm not saying they are better than Boston's LP.\n\nWho's Next - yes.\n\nZep 4 (untitled ;)) - yes.\n\nStreet Survivors - hmmmmaybe.\n\nBorn In The USA was Bruce's big commercial yankoff, an artistic lowlight in his career, but that's the crap that's played.\n\nStyx ? :confused: A notch above Head East :D\n\nBest Rock Scream - Any Tool song Maynard screams on.\n\njeffash\n\nBarry Manilow's Greatest Hits\n\nIan's Screamin' Jesus wasn't bad either....\n\nGotta love the RUSH mentions! I like the first live album (or was it the 2nd) ï¿½Exit stage leftï¿½ more than Chronicles, 2112 or the others. I may be biased though as that album was the one that REALLY turned me on to live music.\n\nI have to throw Metallica Black into the discussion as well...\n\nThese discussions need to be broken up into periods though. You canï¿½t really compare Beatles albums to Guns Nï¿½ Rosesï¿½\n\nIt might not be everyoneï¿½s cup of tea, but a current GREAT screamer is the dude from Linkin Park ï¿½ that guy has MAD screaming skills :)\n\nHere is another thoughtï¿½ I have NEVER liked or disliked music based on how popular/under ground/or pop it is. I allow myself to like what I LIKE.\n\nAnyway, I LOVE the Limp Bizkit CD ï¿½Significant Otherï¿½. This music takes me to a happy place.\n\nGIVE E SOMETHINï¿½ TO BREAK! :)\n\nI think the music was broken up into the period called \"Classic Rock\" as in the Classic Rock genre. Others just happen to be reading it and giving their opinions as to what they think is a classic rock album.\n\nLimp definately doesnt qualify as classic....for another 20+ years anyway....\n\nRUSH 2112!!!!!!!!!!\n\nMetallica- Ride the Lightning is 20 years old now, does it qualify?\n\n;)\n\nI've got to believe that \"Classic Rock\" encompasses everything including and after the Beatles but before the Motley Crue/Poison hair metal explosion. So what's that cover, 1965 - 1980?\n\nWhat's the difference between \"classic rock\" and \"oldies\" ?\n\nIs it a quality issue: Strawberry Alarm Clock, Tommy James and The Shondels, and The Rascals vs. Humble Pie, Savoy Brown, and The Yardbirds ?\n\nsciencet_cher\n\nThis may fringe the year defination of Classic (1982), but I see classic as influence also, so my vote is for REM's Murmur\n\nWhat's the difference between \"classic rock\" and \"oldies\" ?\n\nI think that distorted guitar would be the difference. That and attitude. Although nowadays the oldies stations here in NY play more Beatles than the classic rock stations.\n\nscream (http://www.wtv-zone.com/stinkywetdog/wav/p/shutupclass.wav)\n\nGood point, ching, I think I committed thread drift on my own thread. When I started it I was thinking along the lines of 'every song on the album gets played' with no 'clunkers', but then got off on the 'defend my point till I die' tangent.\n\nOf course I am still lost on the brothers in arms/j. geils/billy idol thing. :)\n\nI like Santoro's definition of classic rock - 1965-1980. That rules out Scorpions, but does include 2112, which I strangely forgot (I was a huge Rush head up till Power Windows). Besides the killer first side (2112), there's Something for Nothing, Passage to Bangkok, and Twilight Zone on side 2 (yeah, I still have the vinyl).

Art, sensation, sales, imagination, Innovation, daring, and yes, airplay, but most of all sensation, and INFLUENCE ...some of the factors contributing to the situation where Pepper cannot possibly be displaced in of my opinion of THE greatest, but read/write on, my discmates...I'm interested in your standards by which greatness is measured...\n\n...radio doesn't play albums per se, anyways; albums are musical [and becoming /video] documents released by artists for listeners...to listen to their work; how well they do commercially in sales/airplay is due to their popularity, but not always quality...though it stands to reason the two are closely related [Nashville \"Country\", and unimaginative rap [not all] being the obvious exceptions].\n\nAnother problem I have with the radio airplay standard...\"Rumors\" was great in terms of popularity; it put Fleetwood Mac on the map after toiling in obscurity as a pure blues-based rock unit since the late 60's [Peter Green, but that's another story], but that album wasn't as good as their previous, albeit less popular release [yes, the one with {ug} \"Rhiannon\" on it]...that sort of squelches it for me...going strickly by the airplay standard, I'd have to put 'Silk Degrees' WAY up there in terms of quality, far, FAR ahead of the much more popular [pervasive is more like it] Steve Miller clone releases...basically [he admitted to such] invented to exploit the rock tastes of the time. 'Silk Degrees', 'Highway 61 Revisited,''Blonde On Blonde,' and 'most any CCR have the benefit of every track being great...no filler/marginal work.\n\nI pretty much agree with the \"1980\" figure for the end of the classic era, even though it overlaps the 'New Wave'/Punk phenomena by ~=3 1/2 years, or so...coincides roughly with \"The Wall\" [although that was technically '79, the tour lasted, etc.]. Is it a coincidence I started listening to rock alternatives in '81?\n\n...I'd put the beginning of the classic era 'round '66...coinciding with 'Revolver' ['Rubber Soul' {either version} just doesn't muster the 'rock' effect]...\"You Really Got Me\" by the Kinks had been out a year; Who/Stones/Yardbyrds were getting known, the REAL summer of love had started in Sanfran, and the beiginning of psychedleia were being brewed in L.A....quite a year, musically. Oh yeah, a guy named Zimmerman had \"sold out\" by then...\n\nslo\n\n...and Jimi was wowing them in London...\n\nPizza God\n\nCSN&amp;Y - So Far.\n\nWho else could have a greatest hits album after just 2 albums.

Pepper, by the original standards of the thread, it doesn't compare to Boston. There are 4 or 5 'non radio friendly' songs on it:\n\nWithin You Without You\n\nFixing a Hole\n\nShe's Leaving Home\n\nBeing For The Benefit of Mr. Kite\n\nGood Morning, Good Morning\n\nI'm not saying these songs aren't good, in fact Within You, Without You is one of my favs on the album, but they don't get (and as far as I can remember, didn't get) any kind of airplay beyond 1967 or so.\n\nWho's Next could be shot down because of:\n\nLove Ain't for Keeping\n\nMy Wife (also one of my favs)\n\nThe Song is Over\n\nZep 4 might be the closest, you don't hear Four Sticks or Going To California that much, even around here where the classic rock station format is \"All Zeppelin, All The Time\".\n\nZep 2 is even closer, the only clunker there is Bring it on Home, altho Moby Dick is pretty rare (program directors don't like instrumentals that much, especially those with long drum solos.)\n\nthose Who songs get played here (enough of you know where that is :cool:) fairly often- this debate certainly has regional twists.\n\nC-mag, although we're geographically a ways apart, I can tell you that the same holds true in these parts. Every song off of Who's next has, at one time or another, had its fair share of air 'round here.\n\nThat could most certainly be the case around here (midway between NYC and Albany). We have one 'classic rock' station and it's been the same program director for a long, long time. I know he has a chubby for Frampton and Steely Dan, since it's a given that you'll hear both on a regular basis. Baba O'Riley is pretty regular, enough so that I absolutely can't stand that song any more.\n\nscottsearles\n\nHere is another to DISCuss amongst yourselve's, U.F.O. Shenker Brother's.\n\nIt just SCREAM'Z, Disc Golf Rock/Roll.\n\nslo\n\nAnyone who even remotly likes Regge, must get Bob Marley and the Wailers - Legends. This is the only Bob Marley album you need and is the only Regge that ever gets airplay.\n\nI don't doubt the greatness of Marley, but the soundtrack to \"The Harder They Come\" [featuring Jimmy Cliff and many others] is possibly the best INTRO to Reggae, if only because of the variety.\n\nChing, I knew the name of FM's 'Fleetwood Mac'; I just didn't feel like looking up \"euphemously\" [sp?]...at the time.\n\nDan, this is your thread...did you comment on the '66-'80 timeframe for 'classic rock'? If so, I missed it.\n\nNice, informed/informative thread, regardless...I'm interested in what's viewed as the best of the 80's & 90's, even if that's not per se 'classic rock'. How come all youse know more about music than DG? :D\n\nNice, informed/informative thread, regardless...I'm interested in what's viewed as the best of the 80's & 90's, even if that's not per se 'classic rock'.\n\nBest album of the 80's - SRV's Texas Flood\n\nBest Album of the 90's - I'm kinda stumped on this one, if you could combine Guns N Roses Use Your Illusion 1 & 2 to make just 1 CD I think you'd have it. I think I actually played more music in the 90's than listened. Grunge really didn't do much for me.\n\npterodactyl\n\nI'm the biggest UFO fan that I know of. They have a couple greatest hits albums that are unreal!\n\nMontrose was also a great band that was underplayed on radio stations. Sammy wrote all of the songs...some of his best work ever. I saw yesterday that Sammy will be with Van Hagar again.\n\nscottsearles\n\nKenny,\n\nHow about Y&T not a ton of airplay but they still Rocked.\n\nslo\n\nBoz' first [1969] has the 12:48 blues classic, [somebody] \"Loan Me a Dime\"...at that length, not much airplay, but wow! Duane goes by the name \"Skydog\" on that one, a fact of which I was not aware until I recently picked up a copy [not into the Allmans, however], and is credited with dobro, slide, AND guitar. Recorded @ Muscle Shoals Sound Recorders, Alabama.\n\nMost underated/nigh-unknown but still great album of the classic rock era might be 'Moby Grape' by the band of the same name. It's got a grippe of songs you might not place by name, but when you hear \"Omaha\" or \"Hey, Grandma\" or \"Fall On You\" the reaction [if you were listening to the radio in 1967] is likely, \"Oh, Yeah!\". Kick_*** R&R before the 'heavy' music of the late '60's. It just got re-mastered, with extra tracks, and I'm REEL eager to hear that one.\n\nHey, somebody has to say it: how about 'Tapestry' by Carole King [the best-selling album of all time for about 5-6 years, in the 70's], and several by Joni Mitchell, but especially 'Court and Spark'...lots of that made AM, most made FM, and \"Freeman in Paris\" and \"Raised on Robbery\" made her HUGE. Finally.\n\nHappy B-day P-dact. :)\n\nYes, UFO was the shizzle. And so was Montrose. Its never surprising to to hear Lights Out in London OR Rock Candy jump into my head and stick for a while.\n\nglad to hear things get stuck in your head...\n\nusually it's your head getting stuck............. ;)\n\nI saw yesterday that Sammy will be with Van Hagar again.\n\nWow, I can't believe Sammy would get back with them after they bent him over like that. I guess the tequila ain't selling all that well.\n\nI think I had completely forgotten about Y&T until the mention above.

They have on the phone some 17 yr. old girl from some burb, blah, blah, blah.....(maybe a set up by programming)they ask her what her favorite \"classic rock\" band is. Van Halen, she replies.\n\nThey ask her to introduce the next song............... Jump ('84)\n\nI guess we need a \"grandfather clause\" to our 1980 cutoff date.\n\nDAN HOWARD SAID:\n\nMost overrated of the 90s - Nirvana - Nevermind (if that was such a great and influential album, how come grunge only lasted about 5 years and got usurped by Britney Spears?)\n\nTHE OVERRATED JOHN McENROE SAYS\n\nYou CAN'T be serious!\n\npterodactyl\n\nThanks for the birthday acknowlegment marka. 47 and counting.

OK Computer seems to be on the tops of a lot of critics lists, which could explain why I can't comprehend anyone listening to it more than once.

Tool is the Zep of the 90's (I am not calling Tool Zep, nobody is close to Zep). Before you jump on that let me give you my reasoning. First off Tool has been sucessful without pushing themselves out into the public (tv shows, mass interviews/publicity to push their albums). Second, they haven't released singles but get airplay on radio. Third, their singer has one of the best voices in rock and their drummer/guitarist/bass players are the best of the genre. Fourth, they aren't afraid to change and push the boundries of rock (lateralus). Yes, the genre they are in may be the most fat and bloated that any genre has ever been (at the present at least) but these guys are the real thing and the only band in the genre that I like. Their shows = unbelievable. REM shows = *** men in tights. As for the album Aenima, 4 songs get play on the radio even though the music is not \"mainstream\". Yes, now the mainstream has caught up with Tool but at the time recycled grunge was all the rage. All the other songs on the album rock and rock hard at that. The only albums that I can think of that have a harder sound would be Undertow, The Downward Spiral, Broken, or RATM.\n\nNow that I think about it the first RATM album is the best album of the 90's.\n\nTHIS IS A TEST, part 2\n\nTuned in again to \"The Loop\"- WLUP, Chicago's Classic Rock station's Midday Marathon :\n\nï¿½Home Sweet Home - Peter Gabriel\n\n(LOL)\n\nSorry no such song ... Perhaps it was Solsbury Hill where he talks about they've come to take me home. It was a very popular song.\n\nNo slight intended I only know because of my PG obsession :D\n\nhumble pie 'I don't need no doctor\" live\n\ngreat cd scott :cool:\n\nHumble Pie \"Rockin' The Fillmore\" has the very best live version of \"I don't need no doctor\" by far ... just ask my 8 track tape version I still have :eek: :eek: :eek:\n\nthanks - you're too kind for my [*****] up.\n\nI do admire his style, but it's obvious that maybe I should listen to the 6 LPs of his I own (bought at the thrift stores - near mint, 50 cents to a dollar) :eek:\n\nHome Sweet Home is on the 2nd self-titled LP, '78\n\nThanks for the fun with this thread Dan. Just the amount of discussion is a credit to music from back in the day. These days there is no real musicianship in music very much and certainly most bands best new CD's amount to the CD single. Not very many bands putting out good, serious music in abundance all on one CD. I really like too many different bands to say 1 specific album, but would throw out Steely Dan Aja against almost anything also.\n\nYou definitely should , especially the 3rd LP or \"Melt\" as they call it due to the face melting picture. It rocks real hard and songs like I Don't Remember and Games without Frontiers really rock. It's too late to see him now as he is in Europe touring but his last tour at the end of 2002 and summer of 2003 were among the best stage shows you will ever see. Just Pick Up the DVD of Growing Up tour this last year and watch it, it is unbelievable or even his Secret World Live DVD from 10 years ago when he toured with Paula Cole as his Back Up Female singer. You would never regret it.. guaranteed :cool::cool::cool:\n\nya, I owe it to myself to fill that void\n\nslo\n\nNo claim to \"greatest,\" but great nevertheless, and not yet mentioned [or I missed it]:\n\n'Surrealistic Pillow' [1969] by the Jefferson Airplane. 'Volunteers' is generally considered to be 'better,' but this one got all the airplay, and put the Sanfran sound on the map: \"White Rabbit,\" \"Someone to Love,\" and to a lesser degree, \"3/5 of a mile in 10 Seconds\" were all smashes.\n\n'Buffalo Springfield Again' [1967] by Buffalo Springfield. Everybody knows Stephen Stills and Neil Young were in this group, right? This is practically a greatest hits album...the later 'Retrospective' is precisely that. They only recorded 3 lps, but recently came out with the 4-disc 'Box Set' {sic}, including outakes and demos. It's great, too. Anybody ever notice they spelt 'buffaloe' wrong?\n\n'Joe Cocker!' [1969] by Joe Cocker. NOT the one titled 'Joe Cocker'.

In fact, people who date the 'classic rock' era back to '65 rather than '66 could use 'Freak Out' [or the Kinks' \"You Really got Me\"] as an argument...\"Trouble Every Day\" from 'Freak Out' is one of the all time great rock songs, and is arguably the first 'rap' song [although Dylan could lay claim to that, too].\n\nI donï¿½t believe I've seen this one mentioned yet, but it certainly meets the 'radio saturation' standard: 'Decade' [1976] by Neil Young. Brother Neil is finishing up his third decade as a major player, but this one covers his first, including work with Buffalo Springfield. Some of the hits: \"Cinnamon Girl,\" \"Sugar Mountain,\" [4 dead in] \"Ohio,\" \"The Needle and the Damage Done,\" \"Cowgirl in the Sand,\" \"Heart of Gold,\" \"Like a Hurricane\"...and many others; I didn't even mention any of the Springfield songs.\n\nmd21954\n\nthe full custom gospel sounds of the reverend horton heat!\n\n:cool::cool: ZAPPA /msgboard/images/graemlins/smirk.gif ;)\n\njoe's garage is a classic,one of my all time fav's\n\n...as Joe imagines his last, imaginary, guitar solo...\n\n:D\n\nI was lucky enough to see Zappa, and his incredible band, on that tour (or maybe the one after, not sure).

The panties thing was probably associated with the School's Out LP that looked like a school wooden desk complete with graffiti and carvings in it and the vinyl ( I almost said Disc) had a pair of panties over it instead of a jacket cover.

A much greater variety of shots than your typical LZ video. Plus dvd [or even dvd-to-vhs] sound is better than cd, approaching clean vinyl in \"thereness\".\n\naxldog\n\nYes! The new (it came out last May )Led Zeppelin DVD is phenomenal! I got the 2 DVD set & the 3 CD set \"How The West Was Won\" for less than $30 at Walmart. That's right, all 5 discs for under $30. Led Zeppelin Rules!!!\n\nled zipplen \"song remains the same\"\n\nagreed/\\\n\nslo\n\nRVA, have you checked out the new LZ DVD set? As I mentioned, great, early footage, and done with a lot of care...some of the video is a composite of different shows, but it all jibes...and LOTS of never-before, etc. Every serious Led-hed should at least RENT this one...\n\n...any more 'classic' rock moments?

Without a doubt.\n\nGreatest? Certainly an argument, considering radio-saturation, and sales [something like 5+ years on the Billboard top-album list].\n\nBut \"best\"? Like the Beatles' 'Pepper' and the Stones' 'Exile,' How can 'DSOTM' be the \"best\" classic-rock album of all time, when it's not even that groups' best?!?\n\ncircle_2\n\nI guess my 'Greatest Album' criteria would be the overall quality of the 'all' the songs...so it's hard to argue with Boston/Boston...in spite of the friggin' overkill by radio stations for the last 25+ years!\n\nVan Halen made some interesting albums with few bum songs on them. I and II were raw and pure. Also, Diver Down comes to mind...and it contains a sleeper of a ballad in \"Secrets\"...\n\nI saw VH while in Germany in 1980 at Sindelfingen. Was awesome, no doubt! The opening act? Lucifer's Friend. I believe that VH stole some of their antics and style...\n\nIf I had chosen to travel another 100 miles that same night, I would have seen one of Led Zepplin's final shows...as John Bonham died a few days later.\n\n\"Your's is the cloth, mine is the hand that sews time...\" - All of My Love\n\nslo\n\nI had something to say about 'quality vs. greatness' a half-dozen pages ago, but strictly in terms of quality, are there really people who believe 'Boston' is of higher quality than 'Who's Next'? Well, that's why I read threads, I guess...all opinions are valid...I think mine is more indicative of m-m-my generation [saw the Beatles on Sullivan].\n\nHere's another spin/opinion: Both 'My Generation' [the import {Virgin V 2179 (1965)} version, natch] and 'Are You Experienced?' were better 'classic-rock' DEBUT ALBUMS than 'Boston'...FM wasn't around for the benefit of those first two, or we might be fooled into going mobile to get in tune to sing a song which is over, behind blue eyes, again.\n\nI have just reaquainted myself with Foghat \"Energized\" and I would recommend everyone else does also. It wasn't their most popular but is solid all the way through. Hard to believe that as good as Savoy Brown was and how blues oriented they were that they pretty much sent out 1 guy and reformed as Foghat. Foghat rocks :D\n\ndiscette\n\nI can't resist posting.\n\nI don't want to get in on the argument about what Classic Rock is or is not. The original question asked for the most overplayed album of all time and I would be hard pressed not to agree with Boston. I have heard \"More Than a Feeling\" waaaaaay more times than any human should be subjected to. So, I would agree with the original post. The album is still in heavy rotation on the local classic rock station. I owned that album, along with Rumors, Frampton Comes Alive, Bob Seger Night Moves, and Fly Like an Eagle. All were overplayed before the 80's ever arrived!!!!! I do not own them on CD, and I switch the radio when they come on. I don't need to hear those albums ever again.

Nice guys too, playing with them was one highlight of my wannabe rock star career.)\n\nAllman Bros. - Beginnings (Screw it, any Allman Bros., especially my double live bootleg with Zakk Wylde filling in for Brother Dickey at Great Woods Ampitheater in '98, I think.)\n\nAl Stewart - Year of the Cat (Trust me, not a bad song on it.)\n\nMetallica - Master of Puppets (Their best, imo.)\n\nCrosby, Stills and Nash - Crosby, Stills and Nash\n\nJimi Hendrix - Smash Hits\n\nKings X - Dogman (Seen 'em twice and played with 'em once. They make a lot of great music live for 3 guys.)\n\nStevie Ray Vaughn and Double Trouble - Texas Flood\n\nArc Angels - Arc Angels (Surviving members of Double Trouble with Charlie Sexton and Doyle Bramhall II.)\n\nKiss - Destroyer (C'mon, be honest, you know you bought it for Beth when you were 12.)\n\nKid Rock - Devil Without a Cause (I'll catch it for this one.)\n\nBob Marley and The Wailers - Legend (Undeniable greatness!)\n\nAerosmith - Toys In The Attic (or Rocks, or Pump or Draw The Line or whatever.)\n\nBon Jovi - New Jersey (SHUTUP!)\n\nMotley Crue - Too Fast For Love (Vince is a very funny guy who is a lot cooler in person than you might think.)\n\nSass Jordan - Rats (You owe it to yourself to hear this if you haven't.)\n\nRolling Stones - Sticky Fingers (On most days, but Let It Bleed and Some Girls are always just a mood swing away.)\n\nBeatles - Abbey Road (How do you pick a favorite Beatles Album?

I'm with you on about 50% of your picks but I've got to disagree, while KISS Destroyer is a fine album, Alive is the must have KISS album.

The standout, however, is \"Mandolin Wind.\" How can a guy with such a crappy [sounding] voice sing a song that beautifully?!?\n\nbrookep\n\nPink Floyd - Animals\n\nNEngle\n\nSantana - Santana &amp; Abraxas\n\nAllman Brothers - The Allman Brothers Band, Idlewild South, Live at the Fillmore East\n\nLed Zepplin - III &amp; Presence\n\nRolling Stones - Let it Bleed, Some Girls, Sticky Fingers &amp; Goat's Head Soup\n\nBlack Crowes - Amorica\n\nJimi - Electric Lady Land &amp; Axis-Bold as Love\n\nBeatles - (White Album)\n\nVan Morrison - Moondance\n\nLynyrd Skynrd - Nuthin' Fancy &amp; Street Survivors\n\nPink Floyd - Animals\n\nYou Dog ... he said sheepishly ... trying not to be a pig :)\n\n\"You've got to be able to pick up the easy Duece with your eyes closed\" PF to the DG\n\nJeff_LaG\n\nI personally think that the first Boston album is the greatest Classic Rock album of all time. BTW, I am not some huge Boston fan, in fact I don't even own the 2nd or 3rd album (and no one on the planet besides the band members own the 4th album).\n\nMy reasoning is this, that album is the only one I can think of that still gets pretty regular airplay of every song on it on your average 'classic rock' station. Besides the standards like More than a Feeling, Peace of Mind (maybe the greatest outro in Rock N Roll history), and Long Time, you still hear Smokin, Rock N Roll Band, Hitch a Ride, and Let Me Take You Home Tonight. The one song that gets the least amount of airplay is prolly Something About You, and that is (IMO) the best song on the album.\n\nNow, granted, what some jackass program director at WPUD wants to play isn't necessarily indicative of a great song, but every where around the country I've been, that album gets a lot of play.\n\nI'm sure people will talk about Dark Side of the Moon (wake me when it's over), Zep 2 or Zep 4 (I'd choose Zep 2 if I had to pick just one), and maybe Layla (great album but a few dry spots), but name me another non-greatest-hits album that gets as much play out of every single song on it.\n\nAccording to infoplease, Boston is the 10th best selling album of all time, at 17 million copies. Not that that means anything tho, since Hootie and the Blowfish are right behind them at 16 million. You think they'll be playing Let Her Cry in 10 years? Yeah, right.\n\nFrom: http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/Music/03/09/delp.dead.reut/\n\nBrad Delp, the lead singer of the 1970s and '80s rock band Boston was found dead at his home in southern New Hampshire on Friday, local police said.\n\nDelp, 55, apparently was home alone and there was no indication of foul play, Atkinson, New Hampshire, police said.\n\nRIP Brad Delp. :(\n\nhttp://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/P/B000EQ47GS.01._SS400_SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg\n\n<font class=\"small\">Code:</font><hr /><pre>\n\n1.
