        "text": "March 28, 1970 - Ten Years After at The Ludlow Garage  Cincinnati, Ohio\n\nTen Years After with Alice Cooper, The New York Rock and Roll Ensemble and Mad Lydia  Remembering the 1960s Music Venue that put Ohio on the map.\n\nIt was the summer of Woodstock. A few weeks after the epic in 1969, its counter culture musical vibe came to Cincinnati, Ohio with the opening of the Ludlow Garage located at 346 Ludlow Avenue, in Clifton. The club even had pieces of the original Woodstock sound system. Cincinnati had never seen anything like it and hasnt since. It likely wont again.\n\nIt was open for less than two years, the concert hall brought to town the best of the exploding rock scene that represented a creative burst that has yet to be repeated in music history.\n\nIt earned the reputation as the Fillmore of the Midwest. The opening night at the Ludlow Garage featured: Grand Funk Railroad, Lonnie Mack and Balderdash. This was on\n\nSeptember 19, 1969. At the time, it was one of just a handful of Hippie Rock palaces in the country that started springing up, mimicking Bill Grahams Fillmore East and West.\n\nIts thanks to the Ludlow Garage, Cincinnati was at the heart of the days alternative music world. A popular band that played there was The Goshorn that became, The Pure Prairie League. Two local psychedelic bands who played there were, Balderdash and Bitter Blood Street Theatre. Later on, a band called No Saints  No Saviours which was an Allman Brothers Tribute Band, that featured guitarist Sonny Morman and Bob Nave on keyboards. Bob played at the Ludlow Garage when he was a member of The Lemon Pipers, who had a million seller gold record with their hit, Green Tambourine. It was released at the end of 1967 and it peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for one week, the first week of February 1968. Jerry Kasenetz and Jeff Katz were also responsible for The Ohio Express and The 1910 Fruitgum Company all three bands were the best in Bubble-Gum Music Business.\n\nJim Tarbell figured that one way to keep the baby-boomer youth out of trouble and off the streets was to put on a show, so he booked the up and coming psychedelic group Vanilla Fudge and they played in an old abandoned church in Hyde Park. Soon he offered a steady diet of bands. He went to San Francisco to explore the hippie scene and its music and then attended shows at the Fillmore West and the Avalon Ballroom. He liked one band so much that he booked them for his youth concerts, they were called The Grateful Dead. Jim says, It was their first tour out east, I kind of thought these guys might be big someday.\n\nThe concert turned out excellent. But, I then realized that because my youth concerts were such a big hit, I would need a much bigger place. I leased an abandoned auto repair shop in Clifton, Ohio and began the task of cleaning up years of grease, oil and grime. After all this was accomplished, it was a trip just getting into the Garage, Jim says. You had to pass through two 14 foot tall  4 inches thick wooden doors with 4 foot high brass handles. You were put on notice right away that youre into something very different here. Then you had to walk down these huge ramps that were used to get the cars in and out of the main garage area. Once in the basement, there was a huge subterranean room where our macrobiotic food booths were located. Then you go up a winding staircase to the upper level where the concert hall was. Once inside the cavernous 10,000 square foot room, which was more than capable of holding up to 1,200 people, there was an Alice In Wonderland quality.\n\nJim continues, we had 8 foot tall  high chairs that could hold up to four people. Going to the toilets was also a treat because you walked right into a gigantic Quaker State Oil Can. The ladies room was a huge Pennzoil can. I also found these reproduction oriental carpets for people to sit on.\n\nThe Allman Brothers Band:\n\nThere was the Allman Brothers Band, who had a very special relationship with our Ludlow Garage, this after playing its first show north of the Mason Dixon Line, there on December 19, 1969. The band returned two more times in what would prove to be a trial run for the groups huge breakthrough concert and record album, Live At The Fillmore East.\n\nThe Brothers were also recorded at the Ludlow Garage a year before the famous Fillmore set, but not released until 1991 by Polydor Records. Theres a haunting version of Dreams with Duane Allman flashing his finest otherworldly guitar licks.\n\nTen Years After with Alice Cooper:\n\nI have yet to find any photos of Ten Years After or concert reviews of the band. No set list or posters. I did find a little snippet from Alice himself, where he reveals that he wrote his hit song, Im Eighteen backstage at the Garage late one night after a concert.\n\nSiereveld worked at the Garage as what we might now call an intern / apprentice position. He was a neighbour kid who hung out and did all kinds of odd jobs, because we just wanted to be a part of the culture, and the Garage was where it was happening. He ended up running the sound-board many nights. He notes that almost all the concerts played there were recorded on a then state of the art eight track equipment. The tapes themselves have been handed from person to person over the years. Some have been lost, and B.B. Kings had been stolen the night he played here, right out of the office, it wasnt even cold yet. It was never recovered.\n\nBig Change Came:\n\nBy 1971, the scene had drastically changed. The cultish hippie music had gone main stream, and its artists started moving into the biggest arenas. For example, Jim had booked Cream to play at the Garage, but the band got so big  so fast, that they cancelled the gig and moved right into the big concert halls.\n\nTickets:\n\nThe average Garage ticket cost around $3.00 and up to $5.00 for the big name acts. Jim tells us, that to have kept booking, what the bands were suddenly demanding, he would have had to charge the ridiculous price of $20.00 per ticket. It all became too commercial and I had no interest in that  I closed the Garage.\n\nProgressive Rock Underground Scene:\n\nThe Bands I Booked for the Ludlow Garage:\n\nTen Years After, The Allman Brothers Band, Santana, Herbie Mann, The Staple Singers, Spirit with Randy California, Elvin Bishop, Taj Mahal, NRBQ, The Kinks, Ricky Nelson, Humble Pie, Sons of Champlin, Cold Blood, Boz Skaggs, The James Gang, Bo Didley, Iggy Pop and the Stooges, Alice Cooper, MC5, Fairport Convention, The Grateful Dead, GlassHarp, Mother Earth, Brute Force, The Incredible String Band, Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band.

Theyve released a new album, Cricklewood Green, (London) and dominate the Warner Brothers film Woodstock, in which Alvin Lee lets loose for a good twenty minutes of cinematic assault.\n\nWhen the announcement was made that the group would be appearing at the Fillmore East, there was a rush on the box office that within one day pressed the management to provide two extra shows to accommodate the hordes of fans.\n\nThe new album is similar to the last one, said Alvin Lee. Weve concentrated on improving the quality, though, he emphasized. Everyone seems to agree. A photographer who travelled with the group on this recent tour ( Joe Sia / Rene Du Bauge) said theyve cut all the speed trip stuff and have become one of the more tasteful bands to come from England.\n\nTheir fifth album is a natural musical progression. We dont sit down and think, Now weve got to sit down and show a progression he said. We just get together and do what we feel at the moment. It usually turns out best that way. A natural approach usually brings out the best.\n\nWere now playing to a new generation of audience than that of two or three years ago, he philosophized. Three years ago we were playing to the twenty to twenty five age bracket. Now we find were getting a lot of young kids-like seventeen to twenty. Our audience is constantly changing. Theyre not going to get fed up with what we do because a lot of them are new to it all the time.\n\nEven though Ten Years After has almost a fanatic following no matter what age, Lee wants to experiment with the groups music. Expressing great interest in electronic composer Tod Dockstader, he said new directions for the group might come from the field of electronics. Dockstader is a native of St. Paul Minnesota, whose past includes jobs as a painter, film editor, production designer, writer and cartoonist. He calls his music organized sound.\n\nThis is what interests me, the electronic sounds, as opposed to music, the guitarist said. It still is music, but its just taking another step. It could be the wrong direction, I dont know, but Im interested in finding out. I hope to do a few experimental gigs with it and see what happens.\n\nIn the light of superstardom, many groups have broken up because of ego hassles, musical differences and general discontent with the group scene. Ten Years After have been together for three years and have put out five albums, a considerable track record. Leo Lyons and I had been playing since we left school, Lee recalled. We played in different bands. Then we were in Nottingham and our drummer left and we got Ric Lee to take his place. Then just before we moved up to London we got Chick Churchill to take his place. Chick in fact, was originally our road manager. We gave him that job so we could keep in bread (money) and until we could work him into the whole thing.\n\nThe early days were in Nottingham, which is in the midlands of England, and we moved up to London interested in whatever work we could get. So we could play what we wanted to at a later time, we did session and back-up work for others and finally made a bit of a bank balance that put us a few weeks ahead and we organized our own thing.\n\nWed been practicing and playing our own kind of music, but the only kind of gigs we could get in those days were like pop stuff where we backed singers and things. Then we started off playing blues. It wasnt getting accepted very much until we played the Marquee in London, which was like the center of new happenings in London. We built up a following there.\n\nWe never actually called ourselves a blues band, he confessed, although Ill admit that to many thats basically what we are. In England, its called jazz blues, here its called rock blues  but these categorizations are not very relative to what it really is. But call it rock, blues or whatever you will, its definitely something that stands on its own.\n\nWe started playing basic blues and it built up into our own interpretation of it, which deserves another name. Of course the name might be irrelevant  you could even call it Brand X really. Its like people asking, What do you play? In America, Ill answer rock because thats the term thats used over here. In England, Ill say blues based but its all relative to what people think it is  And we leave that up to the listeners. For example, when I write a number, I give it a basic format, then we throw it around and it comes out however it comes out. I can never foresee how its going to come out  it might come out completely different than I first envisioned.\n\nWhat about the difference in British and American rock bands?\n\nIm not that much in tune with the happening bands at the moment  any  where. Lee said. I only see the bands we play with. But Id say the American bands are less disciplined than English musicians.\n\nEnglish musicians have a tendency to discipline themselves and create with an objectiveness while with the American bands, its kind of get together and see what comes out. Now this is very fine, but its leaving a lot to chance. The English bands hear something they want to create and strive towards it rather than just seeing what happens.\n\nTheres a big opening for something very new in England now. Unfortunately, the bands that are now forming are basing themselves on successful bands that are already going. In England, the majority of the bands that just go around gigging are like juke box bands that play everybody elses hits obviously theyve got to be more original to make any kind of impact.\n\nHis personal background, even though he is English, led him to the blues. My parents were musical, he said. They were musical on a hobby basis. We had a guitar around the house and we used to play a lot of records, collecting Negro blues and jazz records. My father collected some of those farm, working-on-a-chain-gang, penitentiary type records and they were always interesting. Then I got into Negro philosophy  I really got into that before I got into the music, but I started to realize the two were connected. I was very young; I was doing it more as a project than anything else. But I think when rock music first started, I was then able to see the blues and Negro roots more easily than most people\n\nI never really remember when I first started to play the guitar. I always kind of plucked on it. I thought I could get it together properly and I got a guy to show me the chords and chord changes, that was all it was. Then I played rhythm in a little combo in Nottingham and I picked up lead work from a guy who was playing in a band at the time. Then I worked on that. It was always a hobby. I never really thought Id be able to get on stage and play when I was young, but it came naturally after awhile. I went from Elvis Presley (who I got very hung up on as I used to dig his guitarist Scotty Moore) which lead me into Chet Atkins and Merle Travis. Then I got into finger style and classical finger-style then into jazz. I listened to Barney Kessel; I listened a lot to Charlie Christian. I kind of went my way through all the different musical scenes of the guitar so I had a kind of basic background of the guitar and all its elements. This has helped a lot.\n\nBlues always has been American to the English, Lee answered. The English form of folk is like the actual folklore from Wales, Scotland, the ballads of the time. Theres nothing as funky as American blues\n\nThis kind of music is such a good thing because its got no limits whatsoever. You can actually make it-you can turn a number into something entirely different by the artists approach to the number rather than the number itself. I prefer music which gives the artistry to the performer rather than the actual music being the art.\n\nAlso, when we play now-as opposed to three years ago, people are more attentive before we start. When we walk up to the stage theyre ready to listen, whereas before we had to sort of hit them with something to make them listen!\n\nThe group has been criticized for many reasons, among them, beating a good thing to death.\n\nIve read a lot of good things, Ive read a lot of bad things, Lee answered. The only conclusion Ive ever come to is that Im not going to please all the people all the time. I know some people are really down on my guitar style Personally, Im happy with what I do. Im still striving. I realize Im moving in the right direction and the fact that direction has proved to be a successful one is a matter of chance more than anything else. That is, I mean what I happen to like to play, people happen to like to listen to, That in a way  is luck.\n\nWhen asked if he personally feels he is as excellent a guitarist as his fans have described him as being, he replied with a grin, Its difficult to say, I believe Im good. You know it goes against the grain to say such a thing. But obviously I do believe that because I take the music I like and play it the way I prefer to hear it. Obviously the music I make is my favorite music even though its very difficult for me to listen to it as objectively as I can listen to the music of other musicians. I dont think my music has a message, but it reflects me and life itself.\n\nAlvin Lee and Lorraine Burgon\n\nMusic, or being an artist of any form, is a reflection of being part of a society and life. My life, my likes and dislikes, the experiences I go through (consciously or not), they come out in my music.\n\nAlthough hes the star of the Woodstock film, Alvin Lee has his doubts about festivals.\n\nIm a bit of a fatalist about all that, he answered. I mean its nice all this talk about Woodstock and its been built up to be a happening of the century. But if fate had dealt with it another way, Woodstock could have been as much of a disaster as the Rolling Stones Altamont concert. Then again, just a quirk of fate and the Stones concert could have been fantastically peaceful as well. Theres always a possibility of something going astray whenever you get a lot of people together. Surely Woodstock was a step in the right direction. I think it was really cool. Then again, theres nothing to say if it was organised again exactly the same way it would go as well. Something could go wrong. Nothing will ever be idealistic. One hundred percent peaceful concerts will never be peaceful every time, or all the time.\n\nWe played Dallas, Woodstock for the musician, festivals are very difficult. When you get 16 or 17 bands in one day, theres probably more hassle going on backstage than there is in front of the stage. Theres always some band that wants to go on before another or some band that doesnt want to follow another or somebody that wants to get off quick because he wont be there the next day these kind of situations you know, which are inevitable.\n\nPersonally, I get away from it. I ask somebody what time were on and like at Woodstock  I wander off and enjoy the scene.\n\nArticle written by David Harris\n\nDisc and Music Echo - May 9, 1970\n\nAcker Bilk and other esteemed blowers of the clarinet probably thank their lucky stars that Alvin Lee, guitar virtuoso of Ten Years After, didnt choose that instrument with which to make his mark in music. But he nearly did!\n\nWhen a young lad in his native Nottingham he had lessons on the licorice stick for a year and got as far as mastering such musical epics as, In A Little Spanish Town. But young Nottingham lads, with heroes like Robin Hood to live up to, would rather be out in the open leaping about in trees, picking off the nasty Sherriff and his men with mighty bows and arrows at three miles range. Still, from an early age music was a part of his life, and as he grew up music became more important. My parents were both blues fans Working On The Farm blues and prison blues, particularly Big Bill Broonzy, and they inspired me into scene.\n\nI became interested in the negro philosophy and there was always a guitar around the house.\n\nThen the rock and roll thing came along and I got really hung up on Elvis. I thought he was really groovy. I suppose Elviss guitarist Scottie Moore was my first influence on that scene.\n\nI was one of those freaks who listened to the guitar solos, Now people listen to Alvins solos. After five, big-selling LPs and five incredibly successful tours of the States, Alvin is firmly entrenched in the guitar-big  league.\n\nHis first public appearance was in a Country and Western group with his parents, playing clubs at his home town. My parents were into traditional jazz, blues and skiffle, which was all the same trip in those days. As far as parents go, theyre very groovy. There were never any hang-ups about me going out to work to bring bread in. They encouraged me to do what I wanted to. I consider myself quite close to my parents, which seems to be quite a rare thing these days. I suppose its the age difference and every kid is bound to shock his parents. But, if your parents cant understand you, nobody will. It certainly appears that the people who had the task of educating Alvin didnt understand him. He viewed school as a side-line and never really took much interest. I just looked forward to getting out  which I did at the earliest opportunity. It seemed totally unrelated to anything that I had ambitions for. Approved education had nothing to do with what I wanted to do. I was just interested in playing the guitar. The schoolboy Alvin was always in trouble. If ever a day passed when I didnt get told off, I felt that was quite an achievement. I made a pocket guitar at school, just five frets with the strings nailed on it I just used it to practice chords. And I even got told off for that. Whereas I always had understanding parents, the teachers to me were obscene, I yearned for freedom of expression. My school philosophy was that anyone with any intelligence refused to listen to the teachers. The ones who listened and won the awards, were what I called the goody-goodies. I never one any awards. I was interested in science, though, making electric fires and things. Today, Alvin Lee, 25 next December 19, is a person who seems to have his life very well organized. He is now without the oppressions of teachers and things like that. In fact, he is virtually his own boss. You get the impression that he has everything worked out just right. Even tiny details, like carrying an expensive camera around so that it is easier to get taxis to stop. They are more willing to stop if they think youve got a bit of money. He seems very self-assured and content.\n\nHe lives in the mews off Baker Street, London  for which he pays 25 pounds a week rent.\n\nAlvin says he doesnt know how much he earns. He dresses casually, but expensively, and he admits he spends a lot on toys for my hobbies. This means equipment for the bodged-up studio at his home, where he spends a lot of time making tape recordings. He experiments a lot with electronic sounds. One would hope, as I get wealthier, that Ill get a better studio. The thing about making electronic sounds is that it has an ultra-minority appeal. Its something for doing rather than listening  and anybody can do it.\n\nHe likes living in London, but a quiet, sedate mews home is not really suitable for him. I enjoy London but, I like to make a lot of noise. I cant have a large band in my front room.\n\nIll probably do the cottage in Berkshire bit. Apart from recording, he list his hobbies as photography, writing songs and prose. But playing is still my greatest hobby  although sometimes, it appears to be hard work. Whether it is hard or not, playing guitar is his work, and probably always will be.\n\nHe played in a group called Alan Upton and the Jail Breakers when he was 13. It didnt last long. I dont know what happened. He then played in a group called The Jay Birds, and there were a few other bands before Ten Years After  but they didnt really mean anything.\n\nI got on to an R-n-B kick through Elvis and Chuck Berry records. That was when nobody had heard of it. You had to pay three pounds and wait six months for Chuck Berry records.\n\nIt was like an underground scene. There was a minority of us, a little clique, and we liked to freak about to the music.\n\nFour times Alvin made the trip to London to seek gold. Three times he had to give up and go home. The break came, surprisingly, through acting.\n\nLeo, Ric and I got a part in a play. Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, at the Prince of Whales. It was suppose to be set in Nottingham and the people doing it were up there getting the atmosphere. We persuaded them it would be more authentic to have real live Nottingham lads in it  so we got walk-on parts. It was just a meal ticket back to London really, but we were earning bread. We were also doing session work, backing people and awful things like that, and we felt quite rich. Then the group started doing their own gigs, but without much success. We were doing our old Chuck Berry numbers. Club promoters used to say, I like what youre playing boys, but the kids dont. If I put you back on, theyll smash my place up. For a time they played at a club in Leeds  getting twelve pounds for four hours, and attracted a small following.\n\nA minority group came along and dug what we were doing. One night they tried an experiment. They played their first set in their yellow shirts and red trousers, bashing out the popular Motown stuff. For the second half they put on dirty overalls and played the blues. It went down well. The only difference was, that instead of girls cluttering round the stage, all the guys did. We didnt take it as the big message from the sky or anything, but it helped. We got people not to look at what clothes we were wearing, but to listen to the music. From then on we started playing what we wanted, and it really kind of blossomed.\n\nTen Years After formed in May 1967, although Alvin had been playing with bassist Leo Lyons for seven years by then. It really did blossom, as Alvin says. Two years later they were doing their third tour of America. They built up a reputation playing at Londons Marquee and the extinct Klooks Kleek, where their second album, Undead was recorded. They were the hit of the 7th National Jazz and Blues festival at Windsor.\n\nLater, an unknown Alvin took on the famous Fillmore West, on a night when Peter Green and Buzzy Freeden of the Butterfield Blues Band were also appearing.\n\nIn the audience were many distinguished guitarist, including Mike Bloomfield, Elvin Bishop, Jerry Garcia and Charlie Musselwhite. But Alvin stole the limelight.\n\nAfter Alvin played, anything else was meaningless, said one reviewer. He plays the blues like B.B. King, with the intensity of Eric Clapton and the explosiveness of Jimi Hendrix, or in the unadorned tradition of Barney Kessel. Now Alvin had reached a very successful point in his life. But even though he is paid phenomenal amounts for playing the guitar, he still plays for fun. Its as essential to him as eating. If there is a guitar handy, wherever he is, he is likely to grab it and plunk away. But he has time for other things in life. And life itself is his main interest. I like to be in control of my own life  you have to keep your eye on it. Ten Years After has almost become an industry and you just have to watch that you dont get hyped. It is important to see that you dont turn into something you dont like, or loose something like artistic integrity.\n\nIm a kind of amateur sociologist. My chick is into astrology and now Im generally getting into the stars. The philosophy thing used to be childish. I used to have selfish philosophies, relevant to the time and solely concerned with me. But with all ideals you find little problems, tiny faults, and realize that nothing can be 100% right for everybody. I suppose I have the Jesus Christ  George Harrison belief about putting your own house right. If everybody did that, then the world should be cool.\n\nIm not one of those active freaks. I write observations occasionally and show them to people but I dont think activist do any good in the long run. You get these activist who fight all their lives for a good cause and then 60 or 100 years later the thing that they fought and perhaps died for comes about. People eventually get together and say, lets change this.\n\nI suppose travelling has changed my ideas a lot. England used to be the whole world to me  but when you see America! Its one of the most advanced places for personal freedom. Denmark is probably the most advanced, but America really is the of opportunity. People there speak the same language, and for awhile you think youre still in England. Then you suddenly realize its a completely foreign country. Their philosophies are totally different. Take one example  radio, which is one of my pet topics. Here the radio is owned by the Government, and you have to pay for a license to hear it. Americans think that is a joke. And it is a joke; it is a ludicrous situation.\n\nNow Alvin Lee has more time to enjoy life. He has passed the demanding where he was fighting to establish himself. And for this, he can partly thank one Norman Barnacle  who gave him a few basic chord lessons on guitar at an early age.\n\nArticle by Roy Shipston\n\nRecord Mirror  May 30, 1970\n\nVolume 17 Number 21\n\nAbout The Just Released Cricklewood Green Album\n\nI feel a certain sympathy for Alvin Lee who is currently competing with an image which has been bloated for him by those who should at least by now be aware that he could wear a paper bag over his head and still win appreciation as a guitarist.\n\nDuring the press preview of the Woodstock film last week it was significant that Ten Years After received the loudest round of applause for their sequence which featured some vintage Alvin Lee.\n\nHappy at the success of Cricklewood Green, the groups latest album, I found Lee smiling and signing some of his money away on blank cheques while Simon and Garfunkel emoted from the record player.\n\nIn spite of the fact that someone, somewhere  there bout for the Grace of Terry Ellis  has been building Alvin into a solo cult figure, I found the man himself to be anti-flash and quietly concerned with the problem of living with his face.\n\nI was very paranoid about it at first, admitted Lee  somehow I cannot bring myself to call such a talent Alvin which is no doubt a post-Freudian problem I have relating to Chipmunks  It started in America where the business like publicist we had over there found people were picking up on me and decided to exploit the situation.\n\nThere was a weird feeling in the band about it at the time and I kept saying Its nothing to do with me men and it really wasnt. Finally, we all sat down together and discussed it and it was decided that if it was going to help the band we would let it go, but Ive never really liked to think of the band as anything other than a band.\n\nIts weird just how it happens. Someone starts an underground rumbling that someone is a super-star and then the knockers move in. Jimi Hendrix was reported recently as saying, I was the Gene Vincent of the 1970s which I cant quite work out but it doesnt sound too cool.\n\nMr. Lee treated himself to a quietly reflective laugh at that and would not be provoked into any retaliation, when I enquired what he thought of Hendrix. I like him, he laughed. Hes never really received the recognition he deserves for that surrealistic-guitar thing which he started and people like me latched on to. No one has really critically assessed Hendrix for his musical contributions as a composer.\n\nIn the face of such magnanimous praise I had to own up as being the reporter of Hendrix frivolous rather than malicious comment on Lee, but his reply certainly makes him a points winner on that on that long distance verbal bout. At the present time, the topic of conversation is the groups decision to release a single (Shudders from the Movement) albeit that one side is a revolutionary version of the A side Love Like A Man recorded live at 33 and a third, which last nearly eight minutes. Why a single, and could it do the group any harm, if it became, if you will pardon sacrilege, a hit.\n\nIts really the result of pressure from friends and the record company, said Lee. Everyone was saying it would do us no harm, and Jonathan King came down with a long list of pros and cons. Eventually we agreed because we got a bit of a bargain. Some time ago we wanted to release Woodchoppers Ball as a B-side at 33 and a third, and got a flat no, but this time we got them to agree to a stereo cut at the A side which last eight and a half minutes.\n\nThe A side is a shortened version of the album track which always seems a bit of a cheat to me. Its possible that if the single became a hit in England, it could do us some harm. Our concerts in this country are at a very nice stage and the vibes are just right. Weve never thought of ourselves as a pop band in that sense, and we were worried in case we drew the very young people who come for the occasion, rather than the music. Love Like A Man was our decision as a single because it was the one track on the album which seemed representative of what we are as a group on stage. If we had been going for a commercial single  yuk-yuk  it would have been something like Circles. Thats the kind of thing to get played on Family Favourites  I think it is in fact!\n\nThat kind of single would be no relationship to what we do as a group. We can afford to do things out of context on an album, because the overall effect would keep it in perspective as a side-trip, but I wouldnt like anyone to get the impression that was us.\n\nOn the groups aforementioned album named incidentally after one of their roadies Horticultural Splendours (Cricklewood Green  grass  pot) a rare species of rose he has produced  there are a number of electronic effects over and above those feed-backs we have come to expect. Is there any point when the musicians leaves off, and the electrician takes over?\n\nThere is a lot of artistic control that goes into electronics. Most people know that for track tape, you play it back with eight instruments on separate tracks and mix it. When we put the electronic effects over we might have three more machines running with everyone having a finger on the fader.\n\nOn our Sun Still Burns Away track, which was our attempt at the nouveau electronic that was what we did. It wasnt just noise bunged on top. A lot of hard work went into it. A lot of thought and timing and work went into it. Finally, we sat around in the afternoons warmth with the front door open upon the living room, and talked of many things .mourned the death of the word Underground when it was synonymous with Truth discussed a few of the happening groups in the U.S. amongst whom were Quicksilver Messenger Service and Alice Cooper who have an interesting act climaxed by blowing chicken feathers over the audience expressed hope for the pirate T.V. plane and wondered whether anyone could get something as together as POW the San Franciscos retort to pop T.V.\n\nFinally, I returned home with a courtesy copy of Cricklewood Green under my arm as I went to place it on my record player, out fell a large poster of Alvin courtesy of Deram. It is good to find the man himself is not being buried by his own promotion  he does not need it, neither do the group  they are by their own merit.\n\nRolling Stone Magazine  Ten Years After  Album Review\n\nCricklewood Green  From June 11, 1970  Deram 18038\n\nIt wasnt more than six months ago that I happened by chance to come across a certain record review in a rock and roll magazine, and a magazine of little repute, I might add, and that review concerned a very old and dear friend of mine, a very wise young lad who had been a class-mate of mine in Junior High, three years ago. Where he went to school now, if he even did, or what he was up to in general, I had no idea. From what I had read, however, I gleaned that, yes, he was still the same wise kid I had known, and that he was at the time of the review a great, great admirer of Ten Years After and Alvin Lee. It also seemed that people had taken a paternal interest in him and in his musical tastes, and that they were willing to listen to what he had to say, and so I thought to myself, I thought, Why not, yes why not me. Why shouldnt I get first crack at him this time for a brief interview about what he thought about Ten Years Afters new album. If I didnt do it, someone else surely would, and so strapping my trusty tape recorder to my side, I went in search of him. After perhaps five phone calls to old girl-friends, and such, I finally located him in a small California deli having a pork sandwich. He recognized me immediately, and after cordialities, a few more cokes and French fries, I finally brought the conversation around to Alvin Lee and Ten Years After and Cricklewood Green. This is what went down: Did you really mean what you said about Alvin Lee in the November 15th Rolling Stone review of Sssh and I believe Im quoting you correctly, I think perhaps he is God? Sure, sure. I said it, didnt I ? And not only that, but I said that Alvin was the pure water and pure fire of a black mountain stream. But they didnt print that. I never did know what that writing cat had on his mind. But back to the question, yes I said what I felt. Sure.\n\nHow did you handle the usual criticism that followed Sssh in which most critics felt that Lee played with speed, just to be playing with speed? What I mean to say is that his solos are fast for no apparent reason, other than to show how clever he is. Oh that. Well, man, I mean even God shows off, too. Sometimes. Have you ever been to the Grand Canyon or Crater Lake? Talk about a show, man. Shit, what do you want to do, hold somebody back who can really go, really get it on? Thats a heavy notion. Is that what you think now? Oh, now.\n\nYou want to know what I think now. Oh, no. No? No, man. No, what? No, I dont think that now. No, I mean, yes, that I dont think that now. Right. Forget all that shit I just said.\n\n(theres a very long pause). Yes, I dont believe that any-more. (he sits and smiles).\n\nWell, what do you think now? A lot of things, but specifically about what? Specifically about Ten Years After. Oh, them. Cricklewood Green  that? Yes. Well, first of all, the cover and inside spread is a crock of Hallmark Postcard Shit. Thats first. And the album itself?\n\nThe album itself. Humm. Its crazy. Its just crazy, man. Crazy. Its Alvin Lee on the trip of, On The Trail of the Big Hit Single. Roy Rodgers and Dale Evans. For what reasons, God only knows, meaning, of course, him up there. Alvin may even have a bundle of them in Cricklewood Green. Im happy for him. But, even Johnny Rivers had some big ones, man. Big Hits. Even Walter Brennan. I mean, have you heard, Working On The Road ?\n\nAlvin even sounds like Johnny Rivers. Like I said, its crazy. I mean, I know a lot of shit goes down after each album, but this is just weird. Its like you can enjoy it, but it still fucks you up. I mean, I hate to say this, with all the strange connotations and everything, but its like Chinese food, you know? It fills you up, but like ten minutes later youre hungry routine.\n\nBut back to the record, yeh, its a real Chun King Trip. But then, most albums today are like that. I mean, why the fuck should Alvin Lee do an imitation, Sympathy For The Devil?\n\nIts been done, for Christs sake. Its like some kind of old Guess Who Trip riding around on somebody elses coat-tail. Then youre disappointed with Cricklewood Green?\n\nYeh, you can say that. I really expected more from it, more of Alvins head than his fingers, but I guess its like Clapton said, You dont have to be intelligent to play music. And you know what the cat down the street said. What? Never trust a Rock and Roll Star.\n\nNow, I can really dig that.\n\nArticle by J.R. Young\n\nOur Comment: Another negative opinion from \"Rolling Stone Magazine\"\n\nNew Musical Express - June 13, 1970\n\nLeo Lyons is not interested in dwelling on his past. He is far more interested in Ten Years After. Not only in terms of his ground, but also in the same period of time, which has elapsed since he took the decision at the age of 16, to become a professional musician. He has known no other than this precarious way of life.\n\nThrough the success he has now started to reap, he has managed to find a certain amount of personal contentment and fulfilment in a childhood dream of breeding horses. In a newly acquired ranch, just outside Bedford at a place called Pavenham, he eventually hopes to breed sturdy American quarter horses, the kind used by cowboys, but strictly for pleasure riding.\n\nWhen confronted with his U.S. cavalry moustache, well shaped shoulder length hair, hide jacket and tooled cowboy boots: Leo bears a modern day affinity to the familiar image of the old west. As he sits conversing and quietly hand-rolling a never ending stream of liquorice papered cigarettes, it becomes quite apparent that this image is not an affected one. More a natural progression, formulated from his life-long ambition and his numerous horse-riding expeditions undertaken during the groups many stateside trips. Above all, his is a likeable personality. Besides living out of suitcases for a good part of each year, Ten Years After have always managed to spend some free time on the West Coast of America, in order to follow their individual pursuits. It was out there, that Leo realised to his satisfaction that people were now enjoying and appreciating the sheer physical pleasures of horse-riding. Rather than the outmoded social connotations previously associated with this pastime.\n\nThough in the States, there is a tremendous amount of misunderstanding and fear rife amongst all the sections of the community and age groups, the country itself is absolutely fantastic, he revealed. Last September, I decided to see more of the natural beauty of the place, and so I went up into the Sierra Nevadas on horse-back with a few of my friends. Those sultry days that he enjoyed just relaxing and exploring the terrain had very alarming repercussions on him. During that time, I managed to get society in general right out of my system. When I finally got back to civilisation, I was so utterly disillusioned for about three whole weeks, he sadly reflected. At first I just wanted to scream, it was that bad. Why, I asked myself, did people run around so much, or for that matter even want to make a name for themselves. But after those three weeks had passed, I found that I had been brainwashed again, he frankly admitted. If I had to do it again? Im quite sure that the same that the same progression of mental reaction would repeat itself. When I went to see Antonionis Zabriski Point, it really mirrored just how I felt at that time. It was frightening. The pop world in general, be it the media of sound or vision is beset with symbolism and images. Unless youve got one, youre as good as dead.\n\nEven a non-image, has been used more than once as a short term means-to-an-end.\n\nThough perhaps Alvin Lee has become the recognized face and virtuoso with Ten Years After, the other three members are by no stretch of the imagination just back-up musicians.\n\nIn the early days of their acceptance in America, Leo was constantly singled out for special mention in all the reviews of their concerts. Fast guitarist, theyd seen them before------but a dexterous bass player who appeared to be playing second lead with just as much speed----NEVER.  However, success not only brought recognition, accolades and monetary rewards, but also the knockers. Most groups have to contend with them at one time in their career.\n\nWith vitriolic fervour, they singled out Ten Years Afters precision and fleetness for their mindless scrutiny. Sure were always getting knocked, simply because it seems as though some people are getting quite hung-up on our technique and speed. But this is just because we are affected by our environment, and the very face pace with which we all live.\n\nTen Years After lead a very hectic life, spending up to six months of each year touring the States. You could be excused for doubting Leos confession of a jet-paced existence to the fact that he is very relaxed, thoughtful and articulate in his manner. Summing-up occupational hazard of the Knocking Game he dismissed it by concluding. Sometimes this can be upsetting, but it doesnt really bother us. As a group we play to the very best of our ability. The majority of people seem to enjoy it, as we never play to the point of self indulgence. A cardinal sin of which many acts are guilty. Indeed, we are now more dependent upon one another than before. Referring to the knockers, he pointed out, These people set you up and say that you are preaching to the people. Then if these same people dont like what they hear, or think they hear, they knock you. What in fact we play, is really an expression of all the experiences weve encountered. It all comes out subconsciously in the music. Making for new ideas, I hope.\n\nTravel broadens the mind, or so they say, and its certainly made Leo one of the observers of life. My values are still the same. I admit that success has changed me, but only in that it has made me more aware of people. When you dont have to worry about where your next meal is coming from, it gives you more to concentrate on other matters. For Ive experienced this. You know everyone without exception is guilty to some extent of not trying to see the other persons point of view. Unfortunately, not everyone sees this. Its the same when people, and in particular a group become an overnight success. They then have to try and figure out why their last disc was a hit. And most of the time, they dont know the answer, thats when paranoia sets in. Like a number of groups, Ten Years After had involuntary success. We came from what people term the Underground. This doesnt really exist anymore, its now just a handy label for success, which was originally intended for groups who were musically creative, but commercially unsuccessful. Almost apologetic Leo then took pains to stress. The things what I play on bass are more truthful than what Im inclined to say. For I have inhibitions as to what people may think. Frankly, Id argue the point.\n\nThe Crawdaddy Interview  With Alvin Lee of Ten Years After\n\nYear 1970  Volume 4  Number 1\n\nPhotographs by Victor Pilosof\n\nAlvin: I can only judge America from the outside, you understand, me being English. Im not involved, Im not responsible for what you do here.\n\nC.Daddy: Neither are we!\n\nAlvin: They were very brave when they set off from England to find a new land, and theyre still getting it together. Or are they? I saw Easy Rider a couple of nights ago, and thats a big downer. Have you seen it? A mind-blowing ending. Its a good film, but I came out wishing I hadnt seen it, or that Id never heard of its existence, you know! A bit too much for me to handle.\n\nC.Daddy: Someone I know, came out and immediately had their hair cut.\n\nAlvin: I can understand it. I found myself doing a bit of the old, like you come out and like people are looking at you, and youre aware youve got long hair and, theres no two ways about it. To try and not be aware of it, is the coolest thing, but after that film\n\nC.Daddy: I dont think it blew my mind, because Id been out west and travelled and\n\nAlvin: Not out west, have you been to Carolina? After seeing that film. I think we were just lucky in Carolina.\n\nC.Daddy: Well that happens out west too\n\nAlvin: Yeah? Its so heavy, especially if youre from England. Like the police dont have guns even, and the worst policeman can do, a really nasty policeman, is to shout at you, thats about it. And to think about getting in a fight in England, the worst you can do is get a black eye or a broken nose, at the very worst you know. I mean, thats like an all-time thing.\n\nC.Daddy: Here they say weve got something like 200 million guns\n\nAlvin: Yes I know\n\nC.Daddy: Whats weird about it is, that the gun freaks that Ive known, to be gun freaks, were straight Bircher-types. But like Ive found out, being in California, is that even long-hairs, you know, who are supposed to be very peaceful, sometimes are gun freaks too.\n\nAlvin: I can understand anybody digging a gun. There are people obviously over here, that dont like them, but carry them around because if they ever get in danger, or a situation they cant handle, its always, you know, there. But like there must be people with guns who arent perfect, who can loose their temper, you know! Like, if you want to kill somebody, for three seconds, if youve got a gun you can do it, and you cant change your mind.\n\nC.Daddy: Even with a knife, you can yell  duck.\n\nAlvin: Thats what happens in this film, its so mind-blowing. These guys are going through all these hassles, they get into hassles and you think this is incredible, you know, and youre somehow waiting for, like the guys are really groovy in a way, and you dig them. Theyre free, you know, and they pull up and sleep on the road since they cant go to hotels and things and everybodys hassling them, and you know somethings going to come out of it. Theyre driving along on the big old, what do you call it?\n\nC.Daddy: Choppers\n\nAlvin: Yeah, choppers, fantastic machine, sitting like this with his feet on the thing, and a truck pulls up and one of these horrible kind of, you know, horrible country guys, pulls up and says, Lets give them a scare. Pulls the gun out and, Agghh, long hair freak, and he goes like that to him, (chopper man gives him the finger) and the guy in the truck shoots him. (right off of his chopper) Its so mind-blowing! You know, if it ever gets to that, come to England. I really dig being stopped by English policemen now, after what Ive seen here, you know. Its beautiful, it really is.\n\nC.Daddy: Do you like California, do you like the west?\n\nAlvin: I like the country, the people not necessarily. Some are great, but the opposites, there are such opposites. In England, I would say everybody is trying to be, seem to be more toned down. Theres nothing against long-hairs, very little racial prejudice, and what there is, isnt really violent.\n\nC.Daddy: Its hard to believe\n\nAlvin: You can go anywhere in London and not fear to walk anywhere. Which you cant even do in San Francisco or New York and you know, reasonably its cool all over. The policemen wont bother you that much, nothing really, and its all kind of nice and medium.\n\nLike you dont get beautiful people camping out and living idealistic lives, but you dont get people going around shooting other people either. Course, there are one or two somewhere, but you know, there are some great things around here, some very fantastic people, who are trying to get something together, and are really doing the thing, but like theres an opposite end to that. You know, complete opposites. And, there are also people in the middle as well..\n\nRight, there are those opposites, people go towards one or the other, sooner or later and I find it getting difficult to associate with straight people because you tend to become paranoid of what they think of you. Its a natural tendency really. You know, that it shouldnt be, and yet you know that sooner or later, somethings going to arise, which is going to make you say,\n\nAll right, well Im not coming around here. And youre either going to entirely ignore it for so long, but soon youre going to have to stand up for yourself or deprive yourself of the right to stand up for yourself. Its almost like that. Heavy and action: America. So you know I try to stay void, if I can. Its going to be impossible one day.\n\nC.Daddy: Any thoughts about Nixon or Harold Wilson?\n\nAlvin: Id never be a politician. And anyone who wants to spend their life being one is quite welcome to try. Ive got no alternative to offer, so might as well go with them. Recently, Ive been working on some long term ideas, like what Ill be doing two and a half years, when me contracts run out. Im not really sure, but got some vague ideas. A new producer, I want me own studio, and things like that. The question is, if I can get the bread together. Cost us a lot nowadays to compete. I really want me own studio, just to make albums with other people.\n\nIn me own time. And not like create them for any market, and Im pretty sure that if you can do them for free, you know, you can make a living. Right? Which is really all I want. Its the own time thing that is important. If Ive only got time to, if its going to take me a year to do three albums, which I really think are good, I want to be in a position where I can say, well, thats all Im going to do. Like its slightly rebellious. Somehow, all this business of this and that comes through; you feel like a robot sometimes. I should have been up at ten this morning, and here at eleven, and I woke up at twelve, you know, oh well, Im here and fuck it. I got told off. She said: If youre going to hang anybody up in the underground, not this time!\n\nC.Daddy: They put you through quite a bit of that?\n\nAlvin: Yeah, it comes in lumps. Like you take it for so long and its groovy, youre just going to come along and have a little giggle. But one day you get up and it was a late night, the night before, and youre not ready for it, and somehow it doesnt seem a giggle anymore. Weve been on the road for six weeks, and somehow it can get to you.\n\nC.Daddy: Youve been in the east six weeks?\n\nAlvin: No, weve done Frisco, well, if my memory serves me right, to get a rough idea of what weve done, we started with New York, we did the Singer Bowl and a Central Park thing. The Central Park thing was really good. I really dug that.\n\nC.Daddy: With Three Dog Night?\n\nAlvin: No, they didnt make it. Spencer Davis was on, but like New York it was really great. Then we did Detroit. Oh, we started at Newport, (Jazz Festival) which didnt really work out, to say the least. I dont want to go into details, just didnt happen. Shall we say sometimes, you get those days, when you shouldnt have got up, and that was one of them. The amps broke down, the P.A. was crummy, we couldnt find the dressing rooms, getting hassled getting in. You find yourself standing on the stage, and when you finally get all plugged in, everythings going arrrrr ..and youre supposed to create music at that point, you know.\n\nWe did three numbers, and the guy who was worried about the fences, came on after the third number, and he said, there will now be a fifteen minute intermission and we had only just warmed up. Cant win èm all.\n\nDetroit was put on by the same guy, and it was similar but was a bit cooler. I got into that and enjoyed it for what it was. There was a revolving stage, and the audience sat all around. There were four P.A. cabinets around this revolving thing, and like we go on and start and like youre singing, man, its weird, like you look and see somebody and you play and you look and its somebody else and like the room has got longer and the vocals and the P.A keep getting louder and then disappearing. In a way I enjoyed it, it was a mind-blowing experience.\n\nA lot of people got a bit uptight over it, right, getting that one together. It didnt hang me up to much, but I dont think its the best way to hear a band, quite honestly. A few people who talked to me afterwards, it was great when we came around to their part. You can imagine, youre just getting into something and then youre disappearing around the corner. Then a wait and youre hearing noises and Whats Happening? And then we come around again.\n\nC.Daddy: Are you more creative on a tour, or does it sort of drag you?\n\nAlvin: It can be, it depends on what sort of circumstances you know. Unfortunately, you cant switch on creativity. Ive tried. Ive said: Im going to write songs today! and pull up a chair up and say Sit down and now write, write songs, and out comes nothing. But then you get these incredible gold-type sequences where youre in bed and completely tired and at 3:00 in the morning you get an idea, that you know youre going to forget it in the morning, and you dont know if you can get up, and get your tape recorder together before youve forgot it, you know. But like what I do, is that I jot things down, little ideas, whenever Im at home with a few days to spare. Sleeping around on the floor you know, it takes me a moment to get something all together. I carry one of these cassettes around and sing odd phrases and things that come up, so it sounds sort of like a junkyard of noises at the end of it all. But, some of it comes out ok. The new album is mostly like ideas received on the road, but got together off it.\n\nIt was all done over a loose period of about six months, from the conception until recorded. The recording of it took us about three or four weeks. Im pretty pleased with it. Ive been hung up on every record weve done before, because Ive always dug it for a week, and then hated it. This one Ive already dug it for a week and hated it, and got back on it again. Thats a sign in the right direction you know. I think with these. That the four albums weve got out now are representative overall of what we do. So Im looking forward now, because in the future we can start to branch out. Anyone listening to these four albums will get a general picture, more or less of what we do. Like theres some crap, but theres other good ones, and its a good opening picture. You know, not perfect.\n\nC.Daddy: Where do you think youre going?\n\nAlvin: Thats where the fun comes in. Theres a lot of ideas, but a lot of it depends on where your head is when the actual recording time comes. Like you plan something and might blow it next week, and plan something else. Every time we finish an album, and put it on a few times, we pick up on a few things and get an idea that if we had done this or that it would have been great. So you think, whats our next album? And you always work ahead and never catch up.\n\nC.Daddy: Do you think getting stoned adds creativity?\n\nAlvin: It can do it variously. Like if everything goes cool, its good. But if your amplifiers start buzzing then youre lost, and you get hung up on that. Or, if something sounds out of tune and you cant work out what then youre not going to get anything together. Thats the trouble with being stoned. Id really gotten ripped last time at the Fillmore. Somebody said, Heres a super joint. Id heard that before, you know, so I thought yeah  and I got up on stage and I could hear a silence that went Pppsssss - and then was like doing a number, and Id be playing the intro and think, Ive been playing for ten minutes and wondered, have I sung already and forgotten? And like I was missing verses and forgetting to do a solo and think, what in hell is this song? In a horrible way I kept it together loosely and the majority of people didnt know. You know, it can be used, man. Like I try not to abuse it at all. I try to stay very cool, and really, youve got to if youre trying to do something and you want your body and your mind to work for you. Youve got to give it a chance, you know. Like just dropping everything in sight, that seems very romantic to have someone come around with a pill and then, I wonder what these are, lets see yippee!! But like not everybody can do that. Thats the kind of people that everybody likes and then you watch them\n\n(Continued on page 47 which is missing) .\n\nNotes for dates, mentioned by Alvin Lee in his interview:\n\nJune 28, 1969  TYA played in Bath, England\n\nJuly 4, 1969  Newport Jazz Festival, Rhode Island, New Yorkk\n\nJuly 13, 1969  Singer Bowl  Turntable Stage  New York City\n\nJuly 12, 1969  Laurel, Maryland  Race Track\n\nJuly 14, 1969  The Movie Easy Rider was released\n\nJuly 16, 1969  Central Park - Schaefer Beer Music Festival\n\nJuly 22 to 24  Fillmore West, California\n\nSSShhhh was released August of 1969.\n\nAlvin talks about working on Ten Years Afters fifth record album, as four have already been released. This would mean that he and the band were working on Cricklewood Green, which came out in April of 1970, and what a fantastic record it was, and still is today.\n\nJuly 5th 1970, Atlanta Pop Festival\n\nwith TEN YEARS AFTER\n\nThe Atlanta Pop Festival 1970  Woodstock of the South\n\nThe second Atlanta Pop Festival took place one year later on the same fourth of July weekend. It took place at the Middle Georgia Raceway in Byron, Georgia, which is about ninety miles due south of Atlanta, Georgia. Estimates range from 300,000 to 600,000 people attended this festival. The following acts appeared on that 92 degree weekend:\n\nTen Years After  Mountain The Allman Brothers Band  Poco  Gypsy  John Sebastian The Chambers Brothers  Mott The Hoople  Grand Funk Railroad  Richie Havens B.B.King  Rare Earth  Richie Havens  Procol Harum  Terry Reid  Lee Michaels - Ginger Bakers Air Force  Taos - The Hampton Grease Band  Cactus The Bob Seger System  Spirit  Bloodrock Ravi Shankar and Jimi Hendrix, in his last performance in the United States, and playing to the largest audience of his career.\n\nThe actual festival took place in a soybean field that was adjacent to the (now defunct) Middle Georgia Raceway. It was originally scheduled for July 3, 1970 to July 5, 1970. But in fact, it never finished until near dawn on July 6, 1970. The festival was promoted by Alex Cooley, who also promoted the Texas International Pop Festival, which took place a month after Woodstock. Ticket price was $14.00, but just like Woodstock, it was destined to become an Open Air Free Event. This happened when the concert promoter threw open the gates, after the crowds outside began tearing down the plywood fences that had been erected around the festival site. Jethro Tull were scheduled to perform, but had to cancel due to Ian Andersons having laryngitis. Captain Beefheart also cancelled, as did Chuck Berry, who was advertised to appear but never showed up.\n\nFrom Jose Sinclair: Love Alvin Lee! Get this: On Blues Night, at the second Atlanta International Pop Festival, I worked the band stage, for Lee Michaels, Johnny Winter, B.B. King, The Allman Brothers Band . Then, all the other guitarist, including: Alvin Lee, B.B.King and Johnny Winter jammed with the Allman Brothers Band  for about two hours more!! It was about eight hours of the type concert where, Kill Me Now is all you can say afterwards. (It doesnt get any better than this, I can now die happy!)\n\nLeo, Alvin and Larry Lent - with thanks to Bruce Kessler / www.rockinhouston.com\n\nYes, its true that the Atlanta Pop Festival is rarely, if ever mentioned in a passing conversation about greatest rock festivals of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Only the serious minded, die hard music fan remembers that event way back when. To me and others, its an unfortunate oversight on the verge of travesty, and Im just being diplomatic. Its simply unforgivable to forget about its importance in the history of rock music. I never heard any negative reports about that three day  turned four day festival. The main complaint and discomfort was the unbearable heat factor, 92F degrees in American measure, and about 42C in European terms. Dealing with the Atlanta Festival seemed to be no big affair. The local folks adjusted just fine, the local politicians were more than willing to be supportive, and the people in attendance all came out to have a great time. In fact, the local fire department hosed the audience down with their water hoses, offering a cold shower of water to the overheated crowd at large.\n\nNow, after writing the above paragraph, I found that Ric Lee of the band Ten Years After, has a much different, first hand account and perspective. From his interview in Disc and Music Echo Magazine: Ric says, Our recent three week American stint was not so enjoyable. We played to 3000,000 at a festival in Atlanta and there were really bad vibrations. About a third of the crowd paid and the other two-thirds just broke in. They think that things like that should be free. Free concerts are great at the right time and place, but the trouble in America is the kids dont have any respect for the slightest authority. Theres a real revolutionary feeling over there. We played at a sport stadium at Harvard and it was really violent with people crashing the barriers and that sort of thing.\n\nThe following is from an excerpt in Herb Staehr's book: Gainesville, Georgia, the second Atlanta Pop Festival, Ten Years After performs on Sunday, which is the third day of the festival. That day also featured the following artists: The Bob Seger System, Spirit, Terry Reid, Johnny Winter, Grand Funk Railroad, Richie Havens and the Allman Brothers Band playing for their second time at this event.\n\nThe festival ends at dawn on Monday with the Memphis State University cast of Hair leading the audience in a sing-along of Aquarius and Let The Sunshine In. A film crew apparently shot many of the musical performances, but due to lawsuits and legal entanglements that followed, the negative film is rumoured to still be sitting in a lawyers vault in Nashville, Tennessee. The only concert released to date, is of Jimi Hendrix, and released on the Atlanta Pop home video. Welcome to the legal quagmire, where the music fans always seem to be the losers.\n\nDoctor Hertell, who was in charge of the medical unit points out, that Byron, Georgia was probably the safest place in America on July 4, 1970. Despite the crowd that made Byron the second largest city in the state, there was no major violence, no deaths and only about thirty persons out of 200 to 400 thousand required hospitalisation. The toilets did over flow, there were not enough on hand to begin with, and they were never emptied during the entire festival. Occasionally, there were temporary shortages of water, but they were only temporary.\n\nThe fact is, 80% to 90% of the people gathered didnt have tickets and had no intention of buying them at the gate. Either because they couldnt afford them, or because they figured that sooner or later, they could force the concert promoters to proclaim it a Free Festival. The heat, it was so goddamn hot, that it was difficult to get beyond ones personal survival, let alone get juiced up about storming the gate or guarding it. Many people were passing out from the heat.\n\nThe Woodstock generation was alive and well, and would survive to live another day, smiling all the way. Fortunately, Byron was not a second Altamont, it was the second Atlanta Pop Festival, for there will never be a third.\n\nTen Years After killed! They recreated their Woodstock set, Im Goin´ Home, and people seem to forget now, that they were the biggest breakout band at that time.\n\nThe Jimi Hendrix set, had to be one of the greatest of all time. Fireworks going off and heat lightning, while he played The Star Spangled Banner and Purple Haze.\n\nThe Chambers Brothers did their big hit of the day, Time has come today.\n\nProcol Harum, also did their hit, A Whiter Shade of Pale.\n\nThe power of Felix Papalardi and Leslie West of Mountain so exciting and impressive.\n\nLight show was by, Frank Hughes and Steve Cheatams.\n\nHells Angeles were at the gate with pistols on their sides. But, from another source, they were not Hells Angeles at all, they may have come from New Orleans and were a motorcycle club called, The Galloping Gooses.\n\nJimi Hendrixs record War Heroes was released after his death. The original title was to be, War Heroes and Lovers but was shortened to just War Heroes.\n\nGrand Funk Railroad could be heard twenty miles away from the festival site, and is it any wonder, when their amplifiers were stacked fifteen feet high behind them.\n\nJohnny Rivers, made a surprise late night entrance. His band started playing, the spot light started crossing the sky, and in he came, guitar around his neck, dangling from a helicopter ladder and lowered onto the stage!\n\nRumour has it, that there was no ice to be found in a four county area for three days.\n\nIt was a 24 hour Circus.\n\nThe band Savage Grace played there in 1970.\n\nThe band Rare Earth played for over two hours, including a thirty minute drum solo in the middle of their epic hit song Get Ready extended live.\n\nThe Cops were cool during the festival, but they got really nasty out on the Interstate Highway, when we were trying to leave.\n\nThe Allman Brothers Band, got so high that they had to stop playing for an hour, so they could sober up to play.\n\nI remember people selling pot off the back of Police cars. Very surreal. Better than Woodstock. This was the best time ever.\n\nI understand that the company Alex Cooley hired to document the festival went bankrupt a week after filming it and that the film is in a vault in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania..\n\nBrief History: The Atlanta Pop Festival 1969\n\nThe very first Atlanta Pop Festival was held a month before the Woodstock Festival in 1969, and ended with the most rave reviews imaginable. It was held over the fourth of July weekend in 1969 in Hampton, Georgia. Featured artists were: Janis Joplin, Johnny Winter, Blood Sweat and Tears, Spirit, Johnny Rivers (Friday power outage during his performance), Ten Wheel Drive, Canned Heat and Joe Cocker ended the first day. Saturday: Creedence Clearwater Revival, Sweetwater, Al Kooper with Big Band sound, Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Pacific Gas and Electric, Dave Brubeck, Delaney and Bonnie Bramlett, Led Zeppelin a very early appearance of Grand Funk Railroad, who appeared even though they had yet to sign a record contract. Also, Chicago Transit Authority, before changing their name to just Chicago. The temperatures were nearing one hundred degrees. There were a few minor problems (if any) mostly heat related. It all ended on a very high note, Woodstock followed its template a month later, and tried to accommodate the audiences needs. As we all know, Woodstock was unavoidably overwhelmed and became a national disaster area in the process. Both festivals were blue ribbon winners!\n\nIsle Of Wight / Atlanta Pop Festival 1970 - Album Cover\n\nHit Parader Magazine\n\nFrom July of 1970\n\nThirty Five Cents\n\nTen Years After  Look Back  A Long Look\n\nAs there are many kinds of people, there are many kinds of superstars. Many have been created by media, many by music. Several owe it all to looks, and a few to backers. Regardless of the means by which a superstar is created, the end inevitably results in a different person. For Alvin Lee, who has been out front of his group Ten Years After since their first American tour in 1968, the role of superstardom is one which he is assuming only with reluctance, only in a secondary vein, and very much to avoid hassles. In my early days as a teenybopper, I was a great fan of Elvis, I joined his fan club as well. I just cant imagine anyone thinking of me as I thought of Elvis Presley. If people want to see me that way, he shrugs disaffectedly, well, thats OK, but I cant relate to it, because I dont think it has anything to do with music. With those italics lies the distinction between the world of musicians and the world of entertainers. The distinction is one about which Lee has mixed feelings, for primarily he is a musician trying to effect changes in the moods of his audiences through the medium of sound, whether it be live or on record.\n\nAlvin, along with Ten Years After bassist Leo Lyons certainly had a crack at entertainment back in 1964, when they led a raunchy rock group in Hamburg, Germany. At that time they were very much into the popular affectations of rolling around on the floor and screaming after the third bridge of each song. But it soon became apparent to them that the purely visual affectations couldnt generate the same communicable excitement as could heated musical interchanges. The good thing, says Lee, is that people react physically to music-that the audience participates  and that you can play for the people and build around their reactions with your music. This is whats important to us the feeling we get fed back from the people. I used to wonder if I should go out and entertain, or just go out and play and then I wondered, should I go out and play for the audience .or for myself. I used to be quite paranoid about things like that. But I found that its all the same thing if it is working. We and the audience react the same ways to the same things if were in tough, And if were not in touch, theres no way to make it work. Im always grateful when people listen. For a long time that didnt happen, and there was no way for us to relate to the going-on, at that time we played for ourselves as a consolation. Today we realize that no sincere musician can honestly say that he plays the music for himself. If that were the case, the speakers should be turned around, facing him and not the audience.\n\nAlvins own musical background stems from his parents collection of traditional jazz  30s and 40s American Dixie and Chicago style jazz that was sweeping through England in the early 50s. Music freaks themselves, Alvins parents had the box plugged into the wall for the best part of every evening, and Alvin listened. His first instrument was a clarinet, (Woodchoppers Ball remaining one of his favourite pieces today, sounds a little different in pop-rock-blues-style). It was after Alvin became proficient on clarinet that the mode of the music changed and Elvis began to shake.\n\nAlvin then ten years old got very heavily into the Elvis thing and precociously went back to the roots to find himself submerged under stacks of discs of the same people who drew their marks on Elvis. For several years he was fascinated by the techniques of black R & B artists whose records by that time, were over twenty years old. By the time Alvin was fifteen he was sitting in with black musicians who blew it up around a Jamaican refugee section of Nottingham, England. That stage of Alvins life remains the one in which he went through the greatest changes. Both personally and musically. I once wished I was black, I used to go to a club where the black musicians sat about. The music was great. The singers and the fans no one had inhibitions, and I wanted to get into that. I wanted very much to loose that part of my white heritage that made me more inhibited than the blacks. Then I started getting paranoid about being what my friends, who didnt like it, called Negro lover. I really dug black people because they were so free. There came a point when I almost had to choose between my white friends and my black friends. It was a very heavy stage in my life. Fortunately or unfortunately, soon I began playing with Leo Lyons and eventually we went to Hamburg where we simulated soul before gaining real soul of our own.\n\nTen Years After became the name of the group Alvin and Leo formed, along with Chick Churchill (organ and piano) and Ric Lee (drums  and no relation to Alvin). The music of the group in the beginning was more inter-woven with jazz than it is now, but at the time there was no identifiable form. A fusion music, the boys felt that the name Ten Years After would suggest roots going back ten years before as well as inclinations toward the future.\n\nThe history of the groups American reception is unique in itself. Ten Years After has been through four American tours in less than two years, with not one supported by a hit single record. Four albums: Ten Years After  Undead  Stonedhenge  and SSSssshhh all on Deram Records, have met with exciting chart reception. A fifth album and a fifth tour are due for the first half of 1970.\n\nAn undoubtedly beneficial residual of superstardom for Ten Years After will be the groups allowance in the studio for recording. Where as, with most up and coming, but not as yet not there groups, the beginning economics of the record business precludes limitless studio time.\n\nAs Alvin put it down, Id like to spend enough time in the studio to put down a hundred tracks of tape. We can now afford to do this without necessarily releasing an album. Before it was a matter of just doing it and hoping it sounded good, because we had no choice but to release it.\n\nFor Lee, his elevation as a more than musical pop personality has left him unaffected by celebrity status and his head still is preoccupied with thoughts of making better music, and on the verge of his fifth trip to America, hes still projecting outward, with his speakers turned toward the audience, picking his axe and reading a response. People react physically to music.\n\nIts good that way.\n\nArticle written by Connie and Phil."
