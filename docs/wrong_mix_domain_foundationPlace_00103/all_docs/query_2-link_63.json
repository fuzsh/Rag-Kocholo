        "text": "Compiled by Bob Parker, with motivation from Frank Lauria\n\nVersion 1.002\n\nLast Updated: 13 June 1997\n\nThis is the first version of a list of music recommended by subscribers to the On-Reflection mailing list. The list is intended to provide music that might be of interest to Gentle Giant fans. Comments or additions should be forwarded to: Bob Parker\n\nFrom: Glen Bourgeois <burgmail@atcon.com>\n\nDate: Sun, 15 Jun 1997\n\nSubject: Bands I thought were mentioned on the list\n\nBands/albums I thought would be mentioned but aren't on the list of Great Music are:\n\nCamel - Moonmadness (1976)\n\nThis four-piece group does magnificent instrumental work on this album, with flute, guitar, and keyboards combining to create something Focus fans should enjoy. Standout cuts are \"Song Within a Song\", \"Chord Changes\", and \"Air Born\". \"Lunar Sea\" remains a concert favorite to this day, as the band gigs around with a different line-up.\n\nCamel - Mirage (1974)\n\nMore of the same, except \"Moonmadness\" is my preference. \"Supertwister\" is a great short standout track, but both albums are very listenable from start to finish.\n\nKlaatu - 3:47 EST (1976)\n\nMany people may laugh at this mention, but if a group SUCCEEDED in making everyone believe they were the Beatles reunited, then doesn't that alone give them merit? \"Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft\" was the theme for World Contact Day in 1977, and still sounds great today. \"Sub Rosa Subway\" had me thinking Paul McCartney had written another great psychedelic rocker, and Doctor Marvello sprouts a John Lennon-soundalike voice over a groovy mid-tempo groove, complete with sitar and backwards piano. Forget the hype (or negative hype, as the case may be) and listen to it. Then they have four more albums you can explore.\n\nGarolou - Garolou (1978)\n\nFrench Canadian Group with a knack for combining traditional French songs with impressive light-prog chord and tempo changes. The odd light song pops up now and then. And they were quite commercially acceptable in French Canada as well.\n\nGarolou - Romancero (1980)\n\nGarolou steps into the 80's with a harder-edged album, still combining traditional with progressive, while retaining one or two light songs for radio. Jazz steps in for \"Dans Paris\" as well. Both albums are favorites of mine.\n\nDeep Purple - The Book of Taliesyn (1968)\n\nFrom their Mark I line-up (Blackmore, Lord, Paice, Rod Evans and Nicky Simper), this album was the very first for Harvest Records and a sweet psychedelic blues offering. \"The Shield\" is great for foggy days, \"Anthem\" is indeed that and best experienced in the early evening after sun is down (with a string quartet to boot!). Great listening from a band who would later become one of the heaviest groups of the 70's.\n\nDeep Purple - Deep Purple (1969)\n\nTheir last with Evans and Simper, this album excels in a style which many have forgotten Deep Purple used to play. \"Chasing Shadows\" opens the album with a Indian-style-percussion-laden flourish. \"Blind\" combines harpsichord and minor chords to send chills down my spine. And \"April\", the 3-part, 12-minute opus to the month they find the saddest goes from guitar, keyboards and timpani, to a string quartet with cor anglais, clarinets, and the like, to a full-Deep-Purple rendering of the initial theme. Another great album for foggy days.\n\nBuckingham Nicks (1972)\n\nThe great lost Fleetwood Mac album. Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckinham, before the days of \"Monday Morning\" and \"Rhiannon\", combine to create their first recorded effort. And what a fine effort it is. Well worth listening to if you're a Buckingham/Nicks/Fleetwood Mac fan. That is, if you can find it.\n\nMaybe more to come, who knows?\n\nGlen (aka Barney Rubble)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------- \"...Sorry, but I have better things to do...\n\nThat's not my job... I don't know anything\" - The helpful telephone representative at 1-888-EXP-JIMI\n\n(and all because I asked him if he knew where I could find a fricken' remastered vinyl copy of\n\n\"Band of Gypsies\" to complete my set... Yup, Jimi would speak that way... S;^S\n\nFrom: \"Julian - THE RANTING MAN\" <nomad@netrover.com >\n\nSubject: Re: Album Recomendation Additions\n\nDate: Tue, 29 Apr 1997 13:14:10\n\nBARK PSYCHOSIS- Hex\n\n1994\n\nAmbient with gorgeous melodies, soft vocals, and many compositional surprises. For those who enjoy the organic side of Talk Talk and the 1980s King Crimson ambient pieces. These guys are covering uncharted territory. A must have '90s Prog./Ambient Classic.\n\nPATTO-Hold Your Fire\n\n(UK)-1971\n\nThese guys may come across as a straight ahead rocker of a band, until out of the middle of nowhere, they'll hit you with an adventurous jazz freak-out\". Highly recommended!!!\n\nHATFIELD & THE NORTH-The Rotter's Club\n\n(UK)-1975\n\nThe all-time best recording of the Canterbury scene. For adventurous listeners only\". Highly recommended!!!\n\nTHE KEITH TIPPETT GROUP - Dedicated To You, But You Weren't Listening\n\n(UK)-1971\n\nFeatures the best of the UK jazz scene at that time, as well as Canterbury drummer Robert Wyatt. They blend hard bop/avant garde jazz with Miles Davis/Weather Report type fusion. Another one for adventurous listeners only\". Highly recommended!!!\n\nNUCLEUS - Elastic Rock/We'll Talk About It Later\n\n(UK)-1970/71\n\nRecently re-issued on CD as a 2CD set, this is fusion in the Miles Davis territory, but more melodic. Features Ian Carr on trumpet, Karl Jenkins on oboe and keyboards, Jeff Clyne on bass, Chris Spedding on guitar, John Marshall on drums. Recommended for Miles Davis/Weather Report fans. I like NUCLEUS much better than both of those bands. That's a strong statement, but wait until you hear them\". Highly recommended!!!\n\nSOFT MACHINE - Third/Four/Five\n\n(UK)-1970/71/72\n\nAll three of these albums are classic UK psychedelic jazz/rock masterpieces. Sometimes spacy, keyboard tape-loops galore, and stellar Robert Wyatt and John Marshall drumming, as well as Hugh Hopper on bass. Highly recommended!!!\n\nSUPERSISTER - Present From Nancy/Iskander\n\n(Holland)-1970/74\n\nMy all time favourite, along with the Soft Machine for serious organic listening. Highly recommended!!!\n\nKING CRIMSON - In The Wake Of Poseiden\n\n(UK)-1970\n\nThe Great Deceiver Box-set\n\n(UK)-1974\n\nRobert Fripp and company go even further into the \"Outside\" than their debut \"In The Court Of The Crimson King\". A must for Mellotron fans!!! \"The Great Deceiver\" Box-set is King Crimson at their most manic and experimental stage in their career. Forget about the studio albums of this period, go on an expensive spending spree and indulge yourself with \"THE GREAT DECEIVER\"-KC\"\n\nPIGPEN -V As In Victim\n\n(US)-1994\n\nWayne Horvitz is the answer to Mike Ratledge(Soft Machine) in the 1990s. Fans of John Zorn and Soft Machine would definately go for this\". Don't miss this one!!!\n\nPORCUPINE TREE - The Sky Moves Sideways\n\n(UK)-1994\n\nImagine the Ozric Tentacles teaming up with King Crimson & The Orb. This is a 90s Progressive Rock classic. The most original band since King Crimson, GG, & Soft Machine IMHO. Sometimes ambient, sometimes dreamy, & sometimes manic a la Robert Fripp\"\n\nGANG OF FOUR - Solid Gold\n\n(UK)-1981\n\nFunky dissonance at its best. Excellent millitant vocals. A highly recommended \"Non-Prog\" recording. Don't miss this killer CD re-issue\".\n\nJULIAN \"Ranting Man\" BELANGER\n\nFrom: Johan Alme <ip547@ii.uib.no>\n\nSubject: The Giant List of Great Music\n\nDate: Sat, 05 Apr 1997\n\nKing Crimson\n\nAll of it, especially the early stuff. It's just great. Complex, well played... One of the best prog-bands.\n\nJethro Tull\n\nThick as a brick I guess I could mention more of JT. Everythings great, but this is the best album.\n\nGryphon - Treason\n\nGreat album - extremely well played, especially the tune Spring Song is worth looking out for. I guess I could metion all of the albums here as well.\n\nDeride - Deride\n\nGreat minialbum with a norwegian metal act. Not so much to with GG, but it's complex and well played.\n\nJohan Alme\n\nFrom: Terje Sandberg <terjesan@online.no>\n\nDate: Wed, 26 Mar 1997\n\nPLs add the following albums to the suggestion list:\n\nSpocks Beard: - Into the light - Beware of the darkness\n\nThis is perhaps what Gentle Giant would have sounded like if they had been formed in 1997.\n\nFrom: Thomas Olsson <Thomas.Olsson@musvet.lu.se>\n\nSubject: Recommended listening for GG fans\n\nDate: Mon, 17 Mar 97\n\nIsildurs Bane\n\nI would like to recommend the Swedish band Isildurs Bane to all GG fans. IB's first two albums (Sagan om den irländska älgen and Sagan om ringen) are fairly traditional by progrock standards, but still interesting. The next two albums (Seas Reflections and Eight Moments of Eternity) are jazz-influenced (especially Sea Reflections) and may not be every proggers cup of tea, but the music is certainly a development from the first two.\n\nThe most interesting albums by Isildurs Bane start with Cheval - Volonté de Rocher and continue with The Voyage - A Trip to Elsewhere, a double CD of very strong material ranging from short Satie-like piano pieces to intense rock-meets-classical pianotrio-mayhem. In 1994, a compilation album of live and studio outtakes (Lost Eggs) was released. The quality on this CD is very varied, since it covers 17 years of music making (1976-1993). The real gem however, is Isildurs Banes brand new CD, MIND. This really is progressive rockmusic if there ever was such a thing.\n\nCheck out IB's homepage at http://www.isildursbane.se\n\nCheers! Thomas Olsson.\n\nFrom: CMich7272@aol.com <CMich7272@aol.com>\n\nDate: Sun, 9 Mar 1997\n\nI remember Poco well from my college days (oops, dating myself). I filed them under that big mishmash of folk-rock groups that were proliferating like bunnies back then; funny how they all seemed to have exchangable parts: Byrds, CSNY, Buffalo Springfield, Loggins and Messina, Pure Prairie League, Flying Burrito Bros, the list goes on and on. Great to listen to young and stoned in Atlanta's spring; the women loved 'em! I put 'em on every now and then when spring is in the air, brings back those delicious memories. Sort of like my Nehru jacket, though; doesn't wear too well today.\n\nGlen, if you have a soft spot in your heart for that *genre*, you might want to try these '90's throwbacks:\n\nEdwin McCain - Honor Among Thieves\n\nSaw these guys touring with the Allman Brothers, impressive if somewhat recycled.\n\nThe Wallflowers - Bringing Down the Horse\n\nJakob Dylan looks and sounds like dad, but unlike Bob, this group's songs won't sound better when someone else does them. Very listenable.\n\nGolden Smog - Down by the Old Mainstream\n\nLike Buffalo Springfield? - here's their 90's counterparts.\n\nPoi Dog Pondering - Pomegranate\n\nMore eclectic in nature, this Chicago band has a bigger, more progressive sound, but don't wander terribly far from their folkie heart. I recommend this one fairly highly.\n\nThe Reivers - Pop Beloved\n\nFormerly Zeitgeist, this is more pop in nature, but very listenable regardless.\n\nOthers to check out: Wilco, Uncle Tupelo; same stuff, different day.\n\nHope some of these can strike a chord!\n\nChuck\n\nFrom: Rebeca Reyes <rreyes@primenet.com>\n\nDate: Fri, 21 Feb 1997 13:56:03 -0700 (MST)\n\nSubject: progressive additions\n\nHi there! here are a few of my favorites that did'nt quite make it big;\n\nFIREBALLET (east coast,NJ? late 70\"S) 2 lps; \"Night on Bald Mountain\" (a truley excellent album all the way through with vocals that were reminiscent of Gabriels', top notch Yesenesis style playing-writing...of note; the tune \"Atmospheres\"(an all time fave of mine) and a rock int. of Mussorsky\"s Night on B. Mt. that's really very well done. Their second lp...hmmm...something about Two-too's also had some great stuff, though not as moody and felt as the first, perhaps because it was very ambitious with more complexity, esp. vocally. Whew!\n\nAlso of note; BLOODROCK of Fort Worth,late 70's...title?(w/ Warren Hamm)\n\nThe ELECTROMAGNETS mid 70's.(Austin)..an amazing group live but some rough edges in studio, still very worth checking out( Eric Johnson with a creative drummer, keys by Steve Barber...very spacey at times)\n\nLet's not forget REFUGEE w/Patrick Moraz, FLASH w/Peter Banks\n\nOK, all for now... ken ray wilemon\n\nFrom: Sven Eriksen <sven.eriksen@nera.no>\n\nDate: Wed, 29 Jan 1997\n\nSubject: Re: gg: not GG: Any recommendations?\n\nI thought I'd take the liberty of posting my list and asking if anyone has listned to and has strong views for - or against - any of the following albums. If you feel others might benefit from the information, please share it on OR, otherwise I would very much appreciate an email with a few words about any one of them that you care to talk about.\n\nAtlas Bla Vardag Sweden 79\n\nQuite nice instrumental prog not a hundred miles from Focus country. Some classical influences can be heard. Not sensational, the CD reissue even has one reuniun track (from '95) which is not neither better nor worse than the old stuff.\n\nCeleste Principe Di Un Giorno Italy 76\n\nVery low-key and atmospheric with lots of nice mellotron, flute etc. IMO, this is one of the better Italian prog albums in my collection. The album is alco called simply \"Celeste\".\n\nCherry Five Cherry Five Italy 74\n\nHectic and complex prog. Nothing very out of the ordinary, and definitely not very original.\n\nCrusis Crusis Argentina 75\n\nHaven't been able to make up my mind whether this is a good album or not. They have been compared to GG, but they are definitely not up to the standards of GG. Songs are rather faceless, and still after half a dozen plays, I can't remember one theme or melody or whatever.\n\nDice 4 Riders of Apocalypse Sweden 77\n\nAh, but this is something different. A MUST for any GG fan, Dice are the closest to the GG sound that I can think of (although their two other albums, \"Dice\" and \"Live Dice\" are even closer to GG than this one). The keyboardist even does the same sort of interplay between Clavinet and guitar as Kerry and Gary does. Great compositions, magnificantly played. Sound quality unfortunately a bit below standard (AFAIR it was originally recorded in mono). Grab it if you can!\n\nDixie Dregs What If? 78; Night of the Living Dregs USA 79\n\nGreat stuff! Impossible to categorize, but it is some sort of fusion. Haven't got \"What If\" (heard it once, though) and I believe it is their strongest. \"Night Of The Living Dregs\" is half live/half studio (if I remember correctly). Utterly complex and varied, should appeal to any GG fan.\n\nEaster Island Now & Then USA 79\n\nAnother great album. Atmospheric and mystic, complex and quite original. Even a good vocalist.\n\nEpidarius Earthly Paradise Germany 77\n\nNot very complex, but very beautiful. Rather simple compositions, not very virtuously played, but the sound is great, especially considering the vintage. Dual keyboards with lots of synth, hammond and mellotron. One for relaxing to. Just over 30 minutes playing time, though.\n\nMuseo Rosenbach Zarathustra Italy 74\n\nThe title track is the ultimate mellotron-drenched 20-minute epic. Like a less polished version of PFM, and the album is a definite must have. Strong compositions throughout. A demo version of the complete album is found on the CD \"Rare & Unreleased\".\n\nNew Trolls UT1 Italy 72\n\nHaven't had this for so long so I don't have a strong opinion of it yet. The fact that it has not made a greater impression on me so far may owe to the fact that it is just ..... not very good (IMO). I'm not too fond of the fuzz-laden Hendrix-inspired guitar that is all over the record. Some classical influences here and trhere.\n\nOsanna Palepoli Italy 73\n\nWell, this has just been discussed here, and I tend to agree that it is a great album. A bit hysterical at times, perhaps, but I guess I have to listen to it a lot more than I have done to have a firm opinion of it. Which means that it is not one of the easiest albums to get into.\n\nTake into consideration (especially regarding the latest two) that I am not a huge fan of 70's Italian prog, although PFM, Museo Rosenbach and Celeste's first album are great. I also like I Giganti's album \"Terra in Bocca\", but it may not be for everyone.\n\nPar Lindh Gothic Impressions Sweden 94\n\nSelf-indulgent, pompous ... and a great musician. A cross between ELP and Aenglagaard (the worst from each), but the end result can be quite fascinating. An ELP-like version of Mussorgsji's \"Night On Bald Montain\" should give you some indication on what to expect.\n\nPar Lindh is booked for a concert in Oslo this Friday, and I may have a different opinion of the music after this. Never seen him live before.\n\nBest regards Sven\n\nFrom: CMich7272@aol.com\n\nDate: Wed, 29 Jan 1997\n\nSubject: Re: gg: not GG: Any recommendations?\n\nCan I add the following?:\n\nDEDALUS\n\n(self-titled-Trident records 1973)\n\nSeminal Italian prog-rock with strong jazz overtones. Instrumental, better quality production than a lot of records in that era.\n\nSTACKRIDGE\n\nThe man in the bowler hat (MCA 1974)\n\nBeatlesque (produced by George Martin), outstanding vocal harmonies, obscure lyrics (how can lyrics written by anyone with the name Smegmakovich be anything but obscure?), and just all around great listening!\n\nTHE LATE BRONZE AGE\n\nIsles of Langerhan (Landslide 1982)\n\nLed by Hampton Coles (the colonel himself) and Pops Thornton, tough to find but worth the search. FM - Black noise (Visa 1978) Somewhat more \"pop\" than the Giant, somewhat more in the vein of French prog-rock, heavy on the synthesizers and light on the lyrics, call it prog \"lite\".\n\nMCDONALD AND GILES\n\n(self-titled Cotillion 1972)\n\nOK, they're King Crimson renegades, but this album is worth another listen.\n\nGODLEY AND CREME\n\nFreeze frame (Polygram 1979)\n\nNOT your standard 10cc fare! Worth the price alone just for the lyrical content. What were these guys on? At some time, try to find their unbelievably ambitious but totoally forgotten \"Consequences\" just for the fun of it.\n\nHAPPY THE MAN\n\nRetrospective (ESD 1989)\n\nThe best from the best of American groups. Anyone who lists GG as an influence can't be bad, and these guys are incredible!\n\nFrom: Peer Jones <pjo@intra-sys.de>\n\nDate: Fri, 06 Dec 1996\n\nI just came across a Gentle Giant page yesterday, listing albums similar to GG. There's one that I think you (and others) might be interested in:\n\nSieges Even - Sophisticated, 1995\n\nA German band's 4th album. Although the arrangements are (naturally) very modern,as opposed to the sound of GG in the 70's, it captures the feel of GG at teir finest moments. The only weak point is the singer's German pronounciation of the English lyrics. It might not disturb some people, but to me it's a considerable flaw. Thankfully it doesn't put me off the fantastic music, though. The previous three albums are worth a listen generally, but as the styles differ considerably from one album to the next, these do not convey any GG feel.\n\nThe album might be difficult to get in the USA or the UK, but it can be ordered through all major German retailers.\n\nHope you'll like it\n\nPeer\n\nFrom: \"Jason M. Rubin\" <jason_rubin@wgbh.org>\n\nSubject: Giant Music X-URL: http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~rgp/list.html\n\nDate: Tue, 19 Nov 1996\n\nHere are some random, top-of-my-head suggestions for fellow Giant fans:\n\nBeach Boys: Pet Sounds\n\nOne of the 2 or 3 greatest albums ever made. Complex harmonies, unique and extravagant instrumentation, and brilliant arrangements. Brian Wilson, a genius at the peak of his powers.\n\nEmerson String Quartet: Bartok\n\nThe Complete String Quartets You want dissonance? You got dissonance!\n\nJoni Mitchell: Don Juan's Reckless Daughter\n\nThis one has everything: a 16-minute orhcestral work, a grooving percussion track, Jaco's bass, and her peerless lyrics and vocals.\n\nDon Byron: Tuskegee Experiments\n\nYoung, radical, jazz clarinet player who dabbles in klezmer (tho not on this album). Includes Bill Frissell, a piece by Schumann, and poetry. Very strong.\n\nCharles Lloyd: Waves\n\nJazz sax/flutist who attracted a rock audience in the 60s when Keith Jarrett was in his band. This one features a colorful cover, a track with vocals by three Beach Boys and Roger McGuinn, and Eastern-tinged jamming throughout.\n\nMannheim Steamroller: Fresh Aire V\n\nThis is the best they've ever done, IMHO. With the London Symhpony Orchestra. The theme is a trip to the moon. The music will definitely take you out of this world!\n\nSteely Dan: The Royal Scam\n\nAgain, their best work, IMHO. Power, precision, and perfection.\n\nTrilok Gurtu: Living Space\n\nIndian drummer/percussionist joined by the great sax player Jan Garbarek.\n\nSoundtrack: Until the End of the World\n\nI'm told the movie sucked, but the soundtrack is wild, very dark and moody, with Talking Heads, Lou Reed, Elvis Costello doing a slow cover of the Kinks' \"Days\" and more good stuff.\n\nYo Yo Ma, Edgar Meyer, Mark O'Connor: Appalachian Waltz\n\nI don't own this yet and I haven't even heard it! But I know all three and this is without question a must-listen for those who like the violin/cello segments of On Reflection and Funny Ways.\n\nFrom: Datboy <whatthat@vnet.net>\n\nSubject: gg: Okay, here's my list\n\nDate: Sun, 17 Nov 1996\n\n1.

Then some good Japanese bands emerged such as \"Social Tension\" (\"ELP\" and/or \"Refugee\" clone trio; a tune included in a compilation album by Musea), \"White Fang\" (quartet\n\nAs a way of contributing to mailing list, and in praise of Nagano-san's participation, here's an abbreviated introduction to Japanese progressive rock scene. Many bands have already gone, but they still live on in my CD drawers. This list is compiled on what-I-have basis, so not all albums are covered but it could give you an idea of what to look for. Although I should add vinyl titles to be more informative, I just feel lazy enough to take the few steps to go to my shelf of 1,000+ vinyls. (Oh, I should take advise from you guys and shoot photos and stock them in fire resistant container!) Anyways, here we go.\n\nAin Soph : One of the first Japanese progressive rock band commercially promoted by a major label. Heavily influenced by Canterburry Jazz-Rock family. The first track on ASoMF is breathtaking. (Albums titles on CD;) A Story of Mysterious Forest Hat and Field 5 Evolved from 9 Marine Menagerie Ride on Camels - Special Live Vol.1 Mysterious Triangle - Special Live Vol.2 Quicksand - Special Live Vol.3\n\nAsturias : A project lead by a Keyboardist/MIDI programmer. Excellent instrumental with influence from Mike Oldfield. Circle in the forest Brilliant Streams Cryptogam Illusion\n\nAugust : As the album title reminds you all, the music is a nice extension of Premiata's earlier works, but in more relaxed way. Hachi-gatsu no Insho (Impression of August) Bikyoran : Dubbed as \"the true successor of King Crimson's Red formation\". That pretty much describes their music. Bikyoran Parallax There are other titles not on CD.\n\nBlack Page: IMO, this is the finest of Japanese Canterburry off-springs. Very elaborate Jazz/Rock. One of the hard-to-find's. (It took me 5 years to come by one.) Open The Next Page\n\nBohemian Symphonic Project : This is interesting. Japanese Progger's tribute to late Frederic Mercury. All Queen songs are given new interpretation and played instrumentally. Bohemian Symphony\n\nFar East Family Band : Japan's forbinger to the realm of pscychedelic/pregressive rock. The keyboardist is later known as Kitaro. Parallel World Fromage : A group from the old town of Kyoto. Melancholic melodies. Easy to get a hook on. The title sounds like one from Kevin Ayers's but no relation musically. Tsuki ni Hoeru (Barking at the Moon)\n\nGerard : From Osaka, they share some members with Vienna, which is an off-spring of Novela. HR/PR. Gerard Empty Lie, Empty Dream\n\nHimekami : A keyboard player in his 50's (or at least he looks like he is) living in Tohoku, north-eastern part of Japan. This guy does a great job in reviving Tohoku's mythology in synthesizer music. Hokuten Genso\n\nToshifumi Hinata : A Berkely educated pianist/Synthesist(Is it the word? Synthist? Synthesizerist? Fist few albums are quite nice, with a touch of Synergy and other Synthesizer visionaire. Later did extensively TV soundtracks. Sara's Crime Chat D'Ete Reality in Love Rhapsody in the Twilight Isis Premiere Another Graffiti Little Rascal Tokyo Love Story Eenyobo Hirayama, Terutsugu : Keyboardist from Novela. Also see \"Teru's Symphonia\". Noi's Castle\n\nIgarashi, Hisakatsu : Guitarist from Novela. Puzzle\n\nInteriors : Fisrt Japanese musicians to appear from Windhamhill. Design\n\nKatura Turana: Free music parallelling Henry Cow, Art Bears etc. Nice fellows to hang around with. (I played with them in a free session some 15 years ago.) Katra Turana Kimera Kenso : Definitely the best fruit of japanese progressive music scene. MUST FOR ALL GG FANS! The leader, guitarist, is an operating dentist in Yokohama, so you know where to go when you have toothache while in Japan... Kenso (first) Kenso 2 Kenso Music for Five Unknown Musicians (2CD Live starts with their rendition of Flairck's \"Sophia\".) Sparta Live '91-'92 (a killer live, excellent musicianship) Early Live Vol.1 Inei No Fue - Early Live Vol.2\n\nKitaro : The well known synth guy. Lady of Dream (Jon Anderson contributes a couple of songs)\n\nKoenji Hyakkei: Wow, Japanese MAGMA! The vocal sounds like the awesome Klaus! Hudred Lights of Koenji\n\nKryzler & Kompany: Trio playing classical pieces with modern interpretation, or better put, Jazz/Rock pieces incorporating classic themes. Not at all like Exception(gag!) Too bad they disbanded a couple of months ago. Live videos are available. Kryzler & Kompany # Natural Showcase Life Performance(Live at Salzburg summer festival. Super!) Chaconne Kuroyuri Shimai : I don't know if they are anything pogressive at all. Kinda far- fetched, eerie atomospheric KC/Lizard like mmusic. Two girls take harmonic vocals.(what harmony, anyways?) Tsuki no shoku (Lunar eclipse) Saigo wa Tenshi to Kiku Sizumu Sekai no Hane no Kioku (The memory of sinking world in wings heard with angels in the end) ...Just what does that mean???? Lux Aeterna\n\nLost Years In Labyrinth : Prog sampler.\n\nMagdalena : From Osaka. A lot of baroque frases on guitar. Amazing female vocalist. I used to listen to this twice a day for a month. Magdalena\n\nMidas : Sorta reminds me of early Premiata Forneria Marconi. Beyond the Clear Air\n\nMr. Sirius : Outstanding Keyboardist/Flutist/Composer collaborating with some of the best prog musicians in Japan. Barren Dream Dirge Incredible Tour (Whoa, you've gotta listen ti this live! Hear the \"Siberian Khatru 90 and laugh your shorts wet.) Mugen : World of fantasy created on keyboards... Leda Et Le Cygne\n\nNovela : They were the first progressive band to be screamed at by teenage girls. Not bad, if you like symphonic rock. Sanctuary Paradise Lost Best Selection '80-'83\n\nOuter Limits: Symphonic. The vocalist is trying to sing belcanto in utter effort, which in turn demands you same level of endurance... Magical Bugle Horn Pageant : Group lead by Hiroko Nagai, aka Lisa Ohki, who also appears in Mr.Sirius's albums. Theatrical as in early Genesis. Kamen no Egao (The smile of a Mask) The Pay For Dreamer's Sin Indies Collection\n\nPale Acute Moon: Ah, eh, I'm gonna have to put this one on again... Pale Acute Moon\n\nPazzo Fanfano Di Musica : Chamber rock. Japanese Opus Avantra? Pazzo Fanfano Di Musica\n\nProspective Faces: Prog sampler Progressives Battles 89 Prospective Faces II\n\nProvidence : From Hokkaido, their first album features Atoll's Christian Beya. Better than Atoll??? And I'll Recite on Old Myth from,,, Rare Tracks\n\nShingetsu : King Crimson meets Mike Oldfield with Japanese melodies... Shingetsu Akai Me No Kagami(Mirror of red eye) : Live '79\n\nTeru's Symphonia : Keyboardist from Novela. Concept is good. Egg The Universe The Human Race Party Megumi Tokuhisa:The female vocalist who sang in Magdalena, Teru's Symphonia. Inverno\n\nU.F.O (United Future Organization): Acid jazz created by house DJ's No Sound Is Too Taboo Cosmic Gypsy\n\nVermilion Sands : Japan's answer to Canterburry. Water Blue\n\nVienna : Great band. Exciting as the first UK. In their live CD, Holst's Planet is intricately rendered to fine prog piece. Overture Step Into... Progress(Live)\n\nKazumi Watanabe: Yeah, Japan's foremost jazz guitarist. TSoL are collaboration with Jeff Berlin and Bill Bruford. Cool! The Spice of Life The Spice of Life 2 Mobo Club Oka Ranman\n\nYas-Kaz : Renowned percussonist/composer in the context of Steve Reich, Philip Glass. Fifth-V\n\nZabadak : Prog pop duo. Yoko Ueno, the female singer, also appears on Asturias's albums. Toi Ongaku Live\n\nIf you are curious about any of the above, feel free to e-mil to me. My impending project is to make an english translation of the liner notes of PFM's 4 CD live set. That could justify the price for some of fellow list members, right? Oh, Nagano-san, what do you say about GG convention in Tokyo area?\n\n# The Terrapin CD of IAGH is way too cool!\n\nFrom: \"Kirby, Jay (John E)\" <jekirby@ingr.com>\n\nSubject: RE: no gg: ERIC MATTHEWS plus New Acquisitions\n\nDate: Tue, 5 Nov 1996\n\nActually, some of my recent favorites include:\n\nBill Nelson, \"After the Satellite Sings\" - not as good as \"Practically Wired\", but hey I'm a fan and Bill can make that E-bow sing. Horse Flies, \"Gravity Dance\" - picked this up for $1 used and it's quirky melodies, amusing lyrics with occassional folk tinges (by virtue of the banjo, violin, and accordian) make it the deal of the year (even though its from '91). Critters Buggin, \"Guest\" - spacy mid-eastern rhythms collide with alternative angst Peter Hammill, \"X my Heart\" - In my opinion this guy gets better with age, at least as far as consistency of product is concerned. The Grays, \"Ro Sham Bo\" - good suggestion Dan, this one's been growing on me.\n\nOh, yeah and OotW has been in my discplayer often, as well...\n\nJay Kirby (jekirby@ingr.com)\n\nFrom: Xiel <xiel@exo.com>\n\nDate: Sat, 02 Nov 1996\n\nSubject: gg: Re: gg Bands that smell like and sound like GG\n\nIt has take years to find GG influenced music. I must give credit to my very good friend, FranZ Kavan, for doing most of the research. We definetly lean toward the avant garde aspects, so some of this stuff is way out there just as GG was way out there. If interested, please ask me before you spend your hard earned cash. I have learned that one man's fancy is another man's nightmare. I hear GG in all of these bands. So here we go.\n\nEpidermis 1978\n\nI have one CD (Genius Force 1978 ?) My complaint is that the music is tame and every song sounds the same. It basicaly sucks.\n\nMiriodor 1991-\n\nI have two CDs (Third Warning 1991 and Elastic Juggling 1995) Both are good. Elastic Juggling is actually very good and recommended. This is a French Canadian band that tours the east coast. The music is fun and playful.\n\nX Legged Sally 1989-\n\nAhhhh the great ones. I have 4 CDs. They are from Belgiun and heavily influenced by Zappa. I love these guys. They do have some distinct GG riffs. This is agressive, in your face, and extraordinarly complex work. Takes several listens. I recommend their latest which is called \"The Land Of The Giant Dwarfs\"\n\nA Piedi Nudi 1975-1979\n\nMinimum instruments in a soft yet disturbing form. Very sophisticated stuff with very few notes. I have 2 CDs. I would not recommend this as a place to start but a place to visit later\n\nBanco 1972-\n\nI have a bazzilion CDs of these guys. There is one song on a mid period album that is GG but in Italian. Can't remember what the title is, but it is there\n\nNo Secrets In The Family 1989-\n\nI love these guys. Got 4 CDs. Imagine GG doing a Broadway show with soaring vocals. Very fun. Sometimes I wonder if these bands have heard of GG. Well there is no doubt here. The later CDs are better than the earlier.\n\nCartoon 1978\n\nAn American Band. I think they only put out one and a half albums. I have the CD of that effort. Very good stuff with lots of time signature changes. Some GG Influence\n\nDeus Ex Machine 1989-\n\nAppeared at Progfest. Best of the show (in my opinion) Italian band heavily influenced by Zappa and somewhat influenced by GG and Legiti (a modern classical composer) I have 4 CDs. The third is called \"De Repuplica\" Outstanding album. The vocals initialy seem to not coincide with the music. After several listens, it starts to make sense. And now after multiple listens the vocals are seamless (Go figur !!). Highly Recommended but will take effort just like the first time we heard Octopus. The 4th CD is a live performance. Also excellant\n\nDr Nerve 1991-\n\nI have 2 CDs. These guys are all over the place. I really enjoy them\n\n5 UUs 1985-\n\nThey have 2 CDs. The first shows them developing their direction. I highly recommend the second \"Hungers Teeth\" agressive, diverse and the mid-section of the openning song is dang close to In A Glass House.\n\nSamla Mammas Manna 1972-1982\n\nSwedish band that had good and bad efforts. I have 5 CDs. The last (at least I think it is there last) is called \"FamilyCrakers\" (except it is spelled in swedish.) \"FamilyCrakers\" sounds so much like GG that it would fit between In A Glass House and The Power And The Glory. Is it as good as IAGH and TPATG.......no but a good attempt.\n\nPresent 1993-\n\nThese are the former members of Univers Zero, U Totem, and (hell I don't know who else) Intricate and always interesting. I have one CD and a live CD is due out soon. I hear the \"tinker toy\" aspect of GG throughout\n\nHappy The Man 1973-1978\n\nThe American GG. I have 3 CDs. I would reluctantly recommend \"Retrospective\". Their music is a little to tame for me.\n\nYezda Urfa 1978\n\nSorry but no relation to Mike Kenneally. Yazda Urfa has one CD....and a great one it is. Mix equal parts GG, Yes, and more Yes and more GG and there you have it. A one shot at fame that is remarkably fun.\n\nMike Kenneally 1988-\n\nFormer Zappa guitarist who worships GG. His two solo CDs are good. He joined forces with Henry Kaiser and released a CD called \"The Mistakes\" Great music. Highly recommended. lots of GG influence\n\nDice 1974-1978\n\nDutch band. I have 3 CDs. \"Four Riders Of The Apocalypse\" is heavily influenced by GG. all instrumental and recommended.\n\nFrom: Steve Harcleroad <HARCLERS@norand.com>\n\nDate: Thu, 19 Sep 96\n\nSubject: gg: More new purchases\n\nAnyway, I have 5 new CD's to give thumbnail impressions about. Stop me if y ou've heard this:\n\nCast - Endless Signs\n\nThese guys have been called neo-prog, and I think the label fits. I find th is CD slightly boring. They also might be called \"Genesis inspired\" (to use the politically correct term). Of the 8 songs, I find 3 very enjoyable, a couple more nice, and the last few don't seem to make much impression on me . ES is heavy on the keyboards, apparently because the keyboard player is t he main composer. The guitarist seems pretty good, although he is somewhat in the background in the mix, and he uses a fuzz guitar sound through the w hole album. If you absolutely must have every CD that sounds like Genesis, go ahead and get this. Otherwise, there's lots of better stuff out there IM O, such as IQ or Marillion.\n\nDjam Karet - Reflections From the Firepool\n\nThis one is kind of a surprise to me. I've heard them described as sounding like _Meddle_ era Pink Floyd, and this is true. However, I don't like _Medd le_ much (collective gasps) and I *really* like RFtF. Djam Karet seems to be much more tasteful, and slightly more complex. A lot of the tracks have some pretty interesting percussion, which I can't usually say about Pink Floyd, or some later bands in a similar mode such as Porcupine Tree. The music resembles psychedelic/space music, but it somehow always keeps my int erest (which to me disqualifies it from being called space music). I recomm end this disk highly, and I believe that it would also appeal to a lot of people who say they don't like progressive music.\n\nFrench TV - Intestinal Fortitude\n\nWell, the music on this CD is a little shizo (in other words, eclectic), bu t that never stopped Canterbury music fans. But this music is even *more* s hizo. In fact, much of the music is very Canterbury influenced. However, th ere are also moments that are clearly RIO inspired, and there's even some q uiet guitar work that reminds me of John Michael Talbot. There's also a cov er of a Van der Graaf generator tune called \"Pioneers over C\" (apparently, C refers to the speed of light) that I really like. I've never heard the original, so I can't tell you it the new version is better or worse. Anyway, I can recommend this disk only if you like everything described above, or if you have a programmable CD player so you can skip tracks. I have a hard time imagining the person that would like every track on this one.\n\n5UU's - Hunger's Teeth\n\nGod I love it. This is extremely wierd, dissonant avant-garde stuff. And ye t...it also sounds *very* accessible at the same time. I would describe the music as what Webern would have done in collaboration with 10,000 Maniacs. The music is extremely RIO inspired, and I also detect a Zeuhl influence in some of the vocals. My understanding is that they were most inspired by Henry Cow, but I still haven't heard Henry Cow yet to make the comparison. One thing that distinguishes this from other RIO I have heard is that it has vocals. I'm very picky about vocalists singing on key, and these guys always seem to be right on the money, even when they're singing 12 tone melodies. There's one amazing tune that sounds just like a barbershop quartet, but the tune is completely dissonant. I highly recommend this to RIO fans.\n\nAnekdoten - Vemod\n\nI've heard that these guys sound a lot like _Red_ era King Crimson. Well, g uess what. They actually do. They even use a cello (_Red_ had a violin, but I can't tell the difference). This isn't a problem for me at all, I *love* _Red_. I think parts of _Red_ make most Heavy Metal sound like Christmas music. Vemod is also intense, dark, dissonant in many parts, and very composed. There is one relatively light acoustic guitar section, but it seems to fit in. I recommend this to fans of...I'll let you figure this one out.\n\n** GLOSSARY **\n\nCanterbury - an area in England from which several bands like Gong, Hatfiel d and the North, and Camel hail from. When I used the term, I'm referring to the quirky, free-form style of jazz pioneered by Hatfield.\n\nJohn Michael Talbot - a Trappist monk (from England?) who writes mostly ext remely mellow music, and plays the guitar.\n\nNeo-prog - Progressive music made in the past few years that is often inspi red by Genesis, Yes or ELP and has a \"lighter\" sound than macho progressive guys like Deus ex Machina.\n\nRIO - Originally referred to an association of rock bands started by Chris Cutler of Henry Cow. This assocation started with about 6 bands, and they w ere devoted to producing music that was \"uncompromising\", and not catering to commercial interests. Now, the term often refers to the dissonant, avant -garde music that seems to be inspired by Henry Cow, the Art Bears, Univers Zero, et al.\n\nZeuhl - music inspired by Magma, the famous French band who played a style of jazz with outrageous vocals that is quite indescribable unless you've he ard them. Christian Vander actually invented a language to write the lyrics in. Zeuhl is a word in that language, Kobai, but I'm sorry to say I don't know the translation. Anyone else?\n\nAs always, please correct me on details that are incorrect. I'm not a great proofreader...\n\n- Steve Harclerode\n\nFrom: Robert Eksteen <RKE@konbib.nl>\n\nDate: Fri, 13 Sep 1996\n\nSubject: gg: 10 more albums Sender: owner-on-reflection\n\nGood day to all!\n\nfor almost a week I have resisted the temptation, but it's stronger than me: I _am_ a sucker for lists.\n\nThis is a list of 10 albums that the adventurous GG-friend may want to hear someday. Non of them would probably make my all-time LP top 10 (except maybe #3), all will almost certainly be in my ditto LP top 100. The list is a bit heavy on the Italians.\n\nACQUA FRAGILE - Mass Media Stars\n\nBANCO - Canto di Primavera\n\nCERVELLO - Melos\n\nEARTH & FIRE - Song of the Marching Children\n\nGODLEY & CREME -\n\nL GRACIOUS - Gracious!\n\nMAXOPHONE - Maxophone\n\nSEMIRAMIS - Dedicato a Frazz\n\nSUPERSISTER - Present from Nancy/To the Highest Bidder\n\nTASAVALLAN PRESIDENTII - Lambertland\n\nCervello is difficult to get.

Highly recommended.\n\nDavid Torn: What Means Solid Traveller?\n\nVery experimental. Not for lightweights.\n\nFrank Zappa: Hot Rats, 1969\n\nThe title just about tells it all.\n\nBilly Cobham: Spectrum, 1974\n\nJan Hammer outguitars Tommy Bolin on the Moog.\n\nFrom: Alexander Lozupone <alexq+@andrew.cmu.edu>\n\nMr. Bungle--(self-titled), 1990\n\nWarner Bros.\n\nSimilar complex changes and moods; very good use of certain musical techniques (re-using the same phrase in different situations). Also uses saxophones in interesting ways.\n\nJethro Tull--A Passion Play, 1973\n\nChrytalis\n\nGreat prog-album from the 70s. This is the most accesible Tull album to GG fans IMHO. Great varied instrumentation, lots of complex time chages etc.\n\nGenesis--Any of the first five albums, 1970-1974\n\nAtlantic\n\nMore great prog; generally similar style of music to Giant.\n\nFrom: Randy Hills <rhills@clearsys.com>\n\nThelonious Monk-The Thelonoius Monk Memorial Album, ?\n\nFantasy/Riverside\n\nExciting, intense music, \"Brilliant Corners\" is worth the price of the CD\n\nEngland--Gardenshed, 1978\n\n-\n\nShifting rhythms, counterpoint, musical drama\n\nOlivier Messiaen--Quartet for the End of Time, 194?\n\n-\n\nIrregular rhythms, great introduction to Messiaen.\n\nCharles Ives--Central Park in the Dark, ?\n\n-\n\nshort masterpiece\n\nJanacek--House of the Dead, ?\n\n-\n\nGreat music\n\nShostakovich--24 Preludes and Fugues, ?\n\n-\n\nImitative Counterpoint\n\nCharles Minugus--Mingus A Um, 1960?\n\nColumbia\n\nComposed jazz with room for improvisatation\n\nJohn Coltrane--Live at Birdland, 1960?\n\nImpulse?\n\nGreat live music\n\nJohn Coltrane--Giant Steps, 1959?\n\nAtlantic\n\nGreat groundbreaking studio album\n\nBeethoven--Middle String Quartets, 19th century\n\n--\n\nGreat dramatic music -- not as amazing as the late quartets, but more extroverted overall.\n\nFrom: Sven Eriksen <sven.eriksen@login.eunet.no>\n\nYezda Urfa - Sacred Baboon\n\nSounds like thay have taken some parts from \"Free Hand\" and said: \"Hey guys, , this is too simple, lets make this music a bit more complicated.\"\n\nDice - Dice, Live Dice or The Four Riders of the Apocalypse\n\nSwedish 70's group. Lots of clavinet and guitar/keyboard interplay the way Gary and Kerry did on \"So Sincere\".\n\nCapability Brown - Voice\n\nVery nice vocals, simpler than GG, but parts almost rivals \"On Reflection\" in a-capella singing\n\nCurved Air - Phantasmagoria\n\nLots of syncopated horns, and a synth solo not too far from the opening of \"Pantagruels Nativity\".\n\nDiscipline - Push and Profit\n\nNot too good as a whole, but one track is very similar to \"Mr. Class and Quality\"\n\nEngland - Garden Shed\n\nNot so close to GG, but perhaps the most underrated 70's progressive album.\n\nGryphon - Red Queen to Gryphon Three\n\nClassic, I guess most of you know this, but those who don't, wait no longer.\n\nJan Hammer - The First Seven Days\n\nHis first solo album, and his best.\n\nHenry Cow - In Praise of Learning\n\nEqually complex and a good substitute for GG listening.\n\nLucifer's Friend - Where the Groupies killed the Blues\n\nOnly vaguely interesting for GG fans, but there are some good moments.\n\nMagellan - Both albums\n\nYou don't get 90's prog better than this.\n\nMirthrandir - For You the Old Women\n\nObscure 70's US prog, inventive and humurous.\n\nNiemen - Ode to Venus\n\nPolish, terriffic vocals and superb musicians, a bit on the jazzy side.\n\nOuter Limits - The Boy Playing his Magic Bugle Horn or Scene of Pale Blue\n\nJapanese, violins and keyboards, complex prog.\n\nRitual - Ritual\n\nNew Swedish group on Musea. A must for any fan of GG or echolyn. This is simply stunning.\n\nSindelfingen - Odgipig\n\nNot necessarily a good album, but the acoustic guitar and Xylophone (I think) plays nome nice things occasionally.\n\nFrom: Richard Karbowski <rick@uu1238.flowerslabs.com>\n\nGryphon--Red Queen To Gryphon Three, 1975\n\nProgressive(?)\n\nEcholyn--As The World, 1994\n\nSony\n\nGood Rats--Tasty, 1974(?)\n\nRat Cit\n\nHas decent vocal harmonies and that special quirkiness.

Highly recommended to any GG fan!\n\nJethro Tull--Roots To Branches, 1994\n\nChrysalis\n\nif you haven't checked this one out yet, it's Tulls best in many years IMHO.\n\nPhish--Junta (1988), Lawn Boy(1989), A Picture Of Nectar(1991), Rift (1992)\n\nElektra\n\nThese guys are being called the next Grateful Dead, but I definitely classify them as prog. The first 2 especially have wild Zappa like instrumental passages that should appeal to GG fans.

If you like Giant's humour, I hope you'll like Dave's.\n\nNow I open myself up to general derision. In sheer desperation to get some new vibrant music, I've been listening to some of the heavy metal tendency. Amongst these, I'd pick out:\n\nExtreme-- 3 sides to every story--and others\n\n-\n\nGuitar-orientated heavy rock but intelligently done.\n\nLiving Colour--Time's Up --and others\n\n-\n\nWell played and intelligent heavy rock - black guys playing against type and doing it very well. Sadly, split up last year.\n\nSoundgarden--Superunknown\n\n-\n\nThis will make me unpopular perhaps but they can sure write some fine songs and play them very well.\n\nFrom: Bob Taylor <rkt@ctaylor.demon.co.uk>\n\nAndy Pickford--Replicant, 1993\n\nCentaur\n\nKansas--Masque, 1974\n\nKirschner/CBS\n\nKansas--Freaks Of Nature, 1975\n\nIntersound\n\nIt Bites--Eat Me In St Louis, 1989\n\nVirgin\n\nJan Hammer--The Early Years, 1986\n\nEpic\n\nI have tried not to state the obvious stuff.

This best-of is a good sampler.\n\nFrom: SHudson653@aol.com\n\nGenesis--The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway,1974\n\nATCO\n\nThis is one of the greatest Prog albums ever. The Musicianship is first rate and the music takes you on a Journey encountering various styles, speeds and rhytms. Exquisite!!\n\nHorslips--The TAIN, 1973\n\noats moo\n\nIrish/Celtic Prog at it's best. excellent mixture of traditional irish folk and straight ahead Prog rock ala Jethro Tull.\n\nJethro Tull--A Passion Play, 1973\n\nChrysalis\n\nIMHO Jethro Tull's masterpiece. A single 45 minute song that has everything from lilting acoustic Guitars to Flute to Searing electric Guitars and very complicvated arrangements. This album takes a while to \"get into\".\n\nKing Crimson--Larks Tongues in Aspic, 1973\n\nAtlantic\n\nThis one has it all. Mellotron,Violins Fripps; Guitar and The Trademark KC sound. The songs have very complex time sig's. (like GG)\n\nThe Police--Synchronicity, 1983\n\nA+M\n\nNot quite Prog but the essence of what good Rock + Roll should be. The drumming is the best since Bruford and Andy Summers can play the GITAR...\n\nUtopia--Adventures in Utopia, 1980\n\nBearsville\n\nThis one like The Police above shows That Good Rock can be NEO-PROG. I include these two only because they are Personal Faves....\n\nSpirit--12 Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus, 1972\n\nEpic\n\nThis one is a crossover from the Psychedelic era but The Guitars and Keyboards make this one for the ages. IMHO a truly classic album...\n\nStrawbs--Grave New World, 1972\n\nA+M\n\nFolk rolk Meets Prog. IMHO the Strawbs Best. Produced By Tony Visconti of GG fame. Some quiet songs and some songs with Dynamic changes ala GG.\n\nYes--Close to the Edge, 1972\n\nAtlantic\n\nJust listen to the beginning of Close to the edge and every instrument seems to be playing a different tune. IMHO Yes's best. Incredibly Complex music that sings.\n\nKayak--Royal Bed Bouncer, 1975\n\nJanus\n\nAgain, IMHO their best. Great Keyboards and Guitar work. Hollands best Prog.\n\nFrom: Rikhardur H Fridriksson <rhf@ismennt.is>\n\nJethro Tull--Songs from the Wood, 1977\n\nChrysalis/EMI\n\nBaroque-Renaissance influences with a good deal of counterpoint and lots of different instruments used.\n\nFocus--Moving Waves, 1971\n\nPolydor/Sire\n\nClassically influenced compositions, great intrumentation and arrangements.\n\nFrank Zappa--Most of his work, 1966-93\n\nVarious Complexity, variation and lots more.\n\nPhish--A Picture of Nectar, 1992\n\nElectra\n\nVariety of styles, great group interplay.\n\nFrom: GLEN BOURGEOIS aka BARNEY RUBBLE <EGB3977@Umoncton.Ca>\n\nThe Guess Who--Wheatfield Soul , 1967\n\nOriginally Nimbus 9, now on RCA/BMG\n\nGround-breaking while still sounding dated. Now how's THAT for counterpoint? And \"These Eyes\" is only the beginning!\n\nThe Guess Who--Canned Wheat, 1968\n\nOriginally Nimbus 9, now on RCA/BMG\n\nMostly same as above, except substitute \"Laughin'\" for \"These Eyes\". Also harbours the initial version of \"No Time\", \"Undun\", and the 10-minute \"Key\" (of which at least 6 minutes is a lukewarm drum solo).\n\nFocus--Moving Waves, 1972\n\nSire Records\n\nThe leadoff track, \"Hocus Pocus\", shows wit and vocal capabilities similar to GG's early years. From there on, it's a different path from GG, but enjoyable nonetheless.\n\nFrom: Frank Lauria <Frank.Lauria@internetMCI.COM>\n\nDavid Sancious--Forest of Feelings, 1975\n\nEpic\n\nYoung David was 21 years old, and had just spent a year with Springsteen. This album, produced by Billy Cobham, was recorded in one week. DS plays all keyboards and guitars. A pyrotechnic instrumentalist (this guy was with E-Street?!?), and a prodigious young composer/arranger (LOVE his version of \"Dixie\").\n\nChris Squire--Fish Out of Water, 1975\n\nAtlantic\n\nYes' bassist/composer/vocalist displays a mature compositional technique with a well balanced selection of pieces. Beautiful string and wind arrangements. If Jon Anderson is the ether of Yes, Squire is the earthiness.\n\nMahavishnu Orchestra--Apocalype, 1974\n\nColumbia\n\nAll pieces composed by John McLaughlin. Album produced by George Martin. Orchestrations by Michael Gibb. The London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Michael Tillson Thomas. This is the large version of the Mahavishnu Orchestra with Jean-Luc Ponty on violin. The perfect fusion of jazz/rock/eastern/orchestral. Side two's \"Hymn to Him\" (the album's closer) ) is the closest musical equivalent to an orgasm I've ever heard.\n\nHappy the Man--Crafty Hands, 1978\n\nArista\n\nHTM and Kit Watkins are already cult favorites on the O-R list, but I mention this album anyway for those who haven't heard it. Crystalline production/engineering by Ken Scott (original Mahavishnu producer/engineer) . Challenging compositions, superb performances. Reminiscent of Gentle Giant and early Genesis at times, but still unique. Great to demo stereo equipment with.\n\nPekka Pohjola--Urban Tango, 1983\n\nBreakthru'\n\nFinnish bassist/pianist composes highly innovative music that challenges the listener to stay close; your perserverance will be rewarded. Quirky, heavy, uplifting, melodic, challenging, satisfying.\n\nPeter Gabriel--Peter Gabriel, 1980\n\nMercury\n\nSpecial mention must go to PG's third solo album--alternately referred to as the 'melting face' or \"Intruder\" album. To me, this is the album that changed the face of popular music from the eighties onward. That open- gated snare, the angular guitar lines, the dark lyrics, the dissonance, the absence of cymbals (Pete thought their sibilance masked the upper-harmonics of the other instruments)--this album took rock music on a disturbing ride, and the sonic influence has been evident all over the musical map ever since.\n\nPlease forward comments and submissions to Bob Parker: rgp@darkwing.uoregon.edu\n\nLast Updated 6/13/97"
