        "text": "Pete Ham, one of the original members of the band Badfinger, wrote the above lyrics just weeks before he hanged himself early one April morning in 1975. Only a few years before, Ham appeared to have it all. Badfinger was one of the most successful acts signed to the Beatles’ Apple label, scoring such hits as “No Matter What,” “Baby Blue” and “Day After Day.” Paul McCartney penned their first and biggest hit single “Come and Get It.” They played at George Harrison‘s Concert for Bangla Desh and backed John Lennon on his Imagine album. Singer Harry Nilsson covered one of their songs, “Without You,” and turned it into a world-wide smash. I unexpectedly found out just how influential the group was, and still is to this day, while reading the excellent book Power Pop by Ken Sharp and Doug Sulpy. The authors interview twenty-eight of the genre’s seminal acts including a recent conversation with Badfinger member Joey Molland. It’s interesting to note that nearly every band in the book that follows Badfinger cites them as an influence. From the giants of the power pop like Big Star, Cheap Trick and Marshall Crenshaw to the more lightweight Bay City Rollers and the Knack, all say they love and respect Badfinger’s music.\n\nDespite Badfinger’s fame and influence, Pete Ham died broke and in despair. In 1983, Tom Evans, the band’s bass guitarist and Ham’s co-writer for “Without You,” also took his own life by hanging. What happened?\n\nFor more than two decades since the group’s demise, there was virtually no place to find the answer to the question “What happened to Badfinger?” Even when Pete Ham and Tom Evans died, press coverage was minimal at best. However, with the release of a documentary video and the publication of a book late last year, Badfinger’s story is finally told. Or is it? . . .\n\nGary Katz’s documentary, simply titled Badfinger, was the first to appear last summer. Fans will find the video invaluable since it features many promotional clips and TV appearances rarely seen and not available anywhere else. Fans can now witness the band perform “Baby Blue” on the Kenny Rogers Show (with an introduction by Kenny himself!) and really rock out on the song “Suitcase” for The Midnight Special program. The biggest coup of all however is the inclusion of two complete promotional videos pried from the Apple vaults. The Beatles Anthology videos show less than a minute of the promo film for the pre-Badfinger hit “Maybe Tomorrow” recorded when the group was known as the Iveys. Katz somehow obtained the complete clip. The color is slightly washed out and the sound somewhat muddy compared to the fragment that appears on the Anthology (Apple obviously didn’t grant access to the master copy) but it is still very good quality and is nice to have nonetheless. The promotional short for “Day After Day” is also here. Made in the pre-MTV age when fans got a kick out of seeing films of their favorite bands doing just about anything, viewing the video now is quaint. It shows Badfinger strolling through woods and fields, stepping across streams and generally cavorting about in the countryside. The footage has nothing to do with the song itself. It’s priceless!\n\nThe Badfinger documentary also features interviews the with the band’s drummer Mike Gibbins and guitarist Joey Molland, as well as Joey’s wife Kathie. The conversations cover the band’s early days as the Iveys and how their first manager, Bill Collins, suggests that they give the Beatles’ Apple Records a try. Apple signs the band and following the minor hit single, “Maybe Tomorrow,” they change their name to Badfinger. After their success at Apple, they find a new manager named Stan Polley who snags them a lucrative deal with Warner Brothers Records. Polley convinces the band to invest all their recording and publishing earnings into a company he has set up called Badfinger Enterprises Inc., saying it will save them paying taxes and enable them to retire wealthy in a few years. In 1974 as Badfinger’s second Warner Brothers album Wish You Were Here is released, the record company discovers money missing from an escrow account and demands to know what happened to it. After getting no answers from Polley, Warner Brothers sues Badfinger and pulls the new album off the market. And, as you can probably guess, Polley then disappears with all the money.\n\nAs tragic as Badfinger’s story is, Katz’s telling of it is strangely uncompelling and flat. Part of the problem is that the video production is often amateurish. Nearly every time that manager Stan Polley is mentioned, the same picture of him is flashed on the screen. This happens so many times that it becomes laughable after a while. Katz should have done some retakes of some of the interviews as well. For example, Joey Molland seems to flub the names of the original Iveys. This should have been easy to fix. Mistakes like this make the video appear rather slipshod.\n\nThe interviews themselves leave more questions unanswered than answered. Little is revealed about the characters of Ham and Evans. Why weren’t their friends and relatives interviewed? Kathie Molland is interviewed when Joey himself is still alive and well. Why wasn’t the band’s career following Pete’s death covered? Badfinger did reform and record two albums during that time. The performance footage makes the Badfinger video essential viewing for fans but it leaves the impression that a major part of the story remains to be told.\n\nEnter Dan Matovina and his book Without You: The Tragic Story of Badfinger published at the end of last year. Without You vividly takes the reader right into the midst of the tangled Badfinger saga, sifting through the facts and recollections in an attempt to uncover its mysteries. There is no question that Matovina has done his homework for the book. He conducted hundreds of interviews with virtually every person alive who worked with or knew the band. A few notable exceptions declined to be interviewed, however. None of the surviving Beatles would comment. And while the affable Mike Gibbins sat for numerous interviews, Joey Molland, featured so prominently in the Gary Katz documentary, refused to talk.\n\nMusicians getting ripped off in the music business is nothing new. But Matovina shows that Badfinger was one its worst casualties. Without You reveals that for nearly every good fortune that came Badfinger’s way, at least three other events would usually go wrong. Even during their Apple heyday, things rarely went smoothly for the band. The release of the Iveys album was canceled in the U.S. and U.K. at the last minute and only came out in Japan and parts of Europe. “No Matter What.” perhaps their finest song, was initially tuned down by Apple for not sounding commercial enough. As the Beatles lost interest in running Apple, leaving the company to slowly disintegrate, eventually Badfinger found themselves signed to a label unwilling to support them at all. When Stan Polley came along with his promises and the Warner Brothers deal, it’s no wonder the band jumped at the chance.\n\nBut trouble came from the group and those close to them too. Their first manager Bill Collins is portrayed in the Katz documentary as a kindly gentleman who stepped out of the picture once he found he could no longer help Badfinger’s career. Matovina shows Collins as tenaciously sticking with the band and demanding his share of the money up until the very end. Joey Molland is just as ruthless at trying to gain control of Badfinger and grabbing the profits as well. He’s often goaded on by Kathie who is described as pushy and difficult by everyone who encounters her. (I have a hunch that those close to Evans and Ham may have refused to be in Katz’s documentary because of Joey and Kathie’s participation.) Tom Evans is shown as a basically shy man who nonetheless liked to party, and was a mean and abusive drunk. Mike Gibbins is a laid back, easy going fellow but since he often took the brunt of Tom’s anger, he has very few kind words to say about Evans. Pete Ham was emotionally distant, more at home by himself making music than he was being around people, but trusting to a fault. When the other members started questioning Polley’s motives, Ham would hear none of it. Once he finally realized what Polley had done, he was crushed and saw no way out.\n\nAll this adds up to four talented people who, despite living and working closely together for years, didn’t really know each other well and were unable to support and help one another when things got tough. This is especially apparent with the steady downward spiral of drugs and depression of Tom Evans after Ham’s death. Pete’s suicide took everyone by surprise but people should have seen Tom’s death coming. Evans often said that Pete was in a better place and had the right idea. The night before he killed himself, Evans called Joey Molland. They started arguing about how to handle Badfinger’s financial problems until Evans ended the call with the threat that he was going to kill himself. Molland appears to have just laughed the threat off.\n\nDan Matovina’s research uncovered more than Badfinger’s tragic story. Pete Ham’s song “Ringside” comes from tapes that were found by Pete’s brother while Matovina was interviewing him for the book. These solo recordings by Ham have been compiled by Matovina on the album 7 Park Avenue, titled after the house where Badfinger used to live and had a studio where the songs were recorded. The album is a good reminder of what a great songwriter Badfinger had in Pete Ham. Many songs would have made classic Badfinger tunes. “Catherine Cares” and “It Doesn’t Really Matter” have the irresistible hooks and catchy melodies that match the group’s hits. One of the songs included among the demos did indeed become a hit. “No Matter What” is just as engaging in it’s acoustic form as it is in the full studio version. But the most striking songs on the CD are also the most sad. Two songs, “No More” and “Ringside” are among the last Pete recorded It seems that even at his lowest point, Ham could still pour his heart out in his music and create magic. “No More” is a cry for help as Pete sings: “Empty days, sleepless nights/Have I lost the will to fight?/Someone help me back onto the road.” Yet ironically, as Matovina points out, the music is wonderfully upbeat. It’s breezy chorus and engaging melody have the makings of a pop hit. But with “Ringside” the tune matches the betrayal and bitterness of the lyrics. It is beautiful song but chilling when you remember the events that followed."
