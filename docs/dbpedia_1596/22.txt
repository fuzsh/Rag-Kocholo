Mediums: oil, canvas.

Location: The Gallery of Modern Art of the Chicago Art Institute (the USA).

The painting, first exhibited at the Barcelona Catalonia Gallery, was presented at the London Opening Day of 1936, where famous collector Roland Penrose bought it directly from the artist. In terms of design and colour, the painting resembles canvases of Salvador Dali and some works of Rene Magritte, with whom Planells made friends in his native Cadaqu√©s. A huge anthropomorphic creature accompanies (or even pursues) a person walking along a deserted street, flooded with bright sunlight. The painting has an abundance of decorative elements characteristic of the early period of the creative career of the Spanish artist.
