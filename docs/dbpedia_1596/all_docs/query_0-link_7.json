In 1918 he went to Barcelona to study painting, lithography and engraving, but he returned home due to economic problems. In 1928 he published his first surrealist poems and some art criticism articles.\n\nBetween 1928 and 1929, Planells participated in his first collective exhibitions in the Dalmau Galleries in Barcelona (1929) and in Girona. In Cadaqués he met René Magritte and other surrealist artists.

Gamboa-Rothwoss, A. G. Lamolla, Ramon Marinello, Joan Massanet, Maruja Mallo, Jaume Sans, Nàdia Sokalova, Remedios Varo and Joan Ismael, and art critic and theorist Magí Cassanyes.

Since 1929 Planells lived in Blanes, where he worked as a professor at the School of Arts.\n\nAfter the Spanish Civil War, Planells painted landscapes and still lifes, and in 1974 he returned to surrealism.\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Planells\n\nTags painting surrealism\n\nThe intellectual property of the images that appear in this blog corresponds to their authors and to those who have yielded them.
