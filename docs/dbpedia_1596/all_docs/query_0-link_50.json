        "text": "This is the latest post in our “Meet the Board” series. Each Monday, we’ll feature one of our 2017-18 board members, not stopping until we run out of board members (in late January).\n\nGinger Hultin, MS, RD, CSO\n\nNominating Committee Co-Chair\n\nI’m a registered dietitian, health writer and creator of the blog, Champagne Nutrition. I specialize in vegetarian and plant-based diets, integrative/holistic nutrition, oncology nutrition, responsible supplementation, and nutrigenomics. I recently moved from Chicago where I worked at the Block Center for Integrative Cancer Treatment under Dr. Block to Seattle where I joined a bio-tech start-up company called Arivale, which offers scientific wellness health coaching based on nutrigenomic data. I also serves as adjunct clinical faculty at Bastyr University in their teaching clinic. I’m happy to serve GSDA as nominating committee co-chair this year. Here’s more about me:\n\nFavorite food: Definitely pizza—of any kind. I’m a spinach, mushroom, pineapple kind of person. My company is called ChampagneNutrition so I do love trying new cocktail recipes. I recently made a 1-glass sangria because sometimes you just want 1 serving.\n\nFavorite form of physical activity: I do OrangeTheory every week in Seattle and I also have a couple favorite yoga studios near my home. I love being active when I travel—this picture is of me cross country skiing in Finland. I also downhill ski and snowboard.\n\nFavorite travel destination: I love traveling in the US—I like big cities like New York, San Fran, LA, Chicago and Houston. I am also passionate about traveling in Asia; I went to Myanmar and Malaysia a couple years ago. This winter I’m headed to New Zealand.\n\nFavorite food city: Seattle is one of them—we’re so lucky to have incredible international food like Ethiopian, Thai and Japanese. I also love eating in LA – everything is healthy!\n\nFavorite hobby: I love cooking including recipe development and food photography. I spend a LOT of my free time doing that. I also love writing and blogging. All of my hobbies have to do with food and nutrition."
