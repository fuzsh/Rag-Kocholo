        "text": "The best way to get the vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients you need isnât with a shopping spree at your local drugstore. Itâs from food.\n\nA good, balanced eating plan -- filled with fruits and vegetables, low-fat dairy, lots of fluids, healthier oils, good proteins, and whole grains -- should do the trick.\n\nStill, many older adults have a hard time sticking to a healthy diet. There could be many reasons, like:\n\nLack of appetite\n\nTrouble chewing\n\nFixed budgets\n\nTrouble finding healthy foods\n\nAdd in that your body doesnât work quite as well as it used to, and climbing Mount Nutrition can be tough.\n\nSupplements might be an option. As part of a plan you and your doctor make, they can do just what their name says -- fill in the gaps in your diet.\n\nBut they arenât always the answer. Take vitamin A -- important for healthy eyes, skin, and immune system.\n\nâVitamin A is somewhat of a controversial vitamin because you can get toxic from it,\" says Ronni Chernoff, PhD, associate director of the Arkansas Geriatric Education Collaborative.\n\nToo much of it can cause nausea, headaches, dizziness, and other symptoms. She adds that older people are more likely to have those when they take too much because their bodies donât deal with the vitamin as well.\n\nâIf you take a vitamin that is designed to be a once-a-day supplement, thatâs OK,â Chernoff says. âBut you donât want to take five of them a day.â\n\nAfter talking with your doctor, if you decide you need a multivitamin, get a complete supplement, one that provides 100% of the recommended amounts of vitamins and minerals.\n\nTake extra care when you:\n\nTake more than one supplement\n\nUse a supplement in place of medication\n\nTake them along with over-the-counter or prescription drugs\n\nâYou want to make sure your left hand knows what your right hand is doing,â says Joan Salge Blake, EdD, clinical associate professor of nutrition at Boston University.\n\nItâs sometimes hard to know exactly what you need. But if you have a balanced diet, youâre probably doing OK. If youâre still concerned, Robin Foroutan, a nutritionist from New York, suggests you ask your doctor if supplements might help.\n\nBefore you head to the store, though, itâs important to know the term âsupplementsâ includes not only vitamins and minerals, but also herbs and other botanicals, amino acids, enzymes, and other things. Some are so-called specialty products like probiotics or fish oils.\n\nBefore you take anything, talk with your doctor and read labels.\n\nVitamin D. This nutrient, made by the body from sunshine, helps you take in calcium and phosphorus, so itâs key for healthy bones and teeth. Older adults donât make it as well, so supplements can help make you less likely to have bone loss and broken bones.\n\nVitamin B12. This is important for keeping blood cells and nerve cells healthy. Aging affects how well you take in and use B12 from foods, so if youâre over 50, itâs probably best to get your B12 from supplements and B12-fortified foods like cereals, as well as foods that are rich in it, like meat, low-fat dairy, and fish.\n\nFolate. This helps prevent anemia. Spinach, beans, peas, oranges, fortified cereals, and enriched breads can have it.\n\nB6. This helps your metabolism and immune system. You can get it in fortified cereals and soy products, as well as organ meats and whole grains.\n\nYour body also needs these:\n\nVitamin C. Oranges, right? (And red and green bell peppers, along with other vegetables and fruits.) It may help protect you from cataracts, help wound healing, and possibly lower your odds of having certain kinds of cancer.\n\nMagnesium. Among other things, it helps keep your blood pressure and blood sugar levels steady. Itâs also good for your bones. You can get it from nuts, spinach, and dairy products, and itâs used to fortify some breakfast cereals. Experts arenât sure how well it works as a supplement.\n\nAnd here are some popular items you can find in the supplements aisle that you might talk with your doctor about:\n\nProbiotics. Gut health is also very important for your immune system. Some studies show that probiotics -- living organisms like those found in yogurt -- help prevent some types of diarrhea and ease symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome.\n\nCoenzyme Q10. Also called coQ10, this is made naturally in your body and found in most body tissues. It may help your immune system work better.\n\nMelatonin. A hormone released mostly at night, itâs believed to help you fall asleep. The science on it is promising.\n\nFish oil. The American Heart Association recommends at least two servings a week of salmon and other types of fish with omega-3 fatty acids. In supplement form, though, no studies have shown that it protects against heart disease. Omega-3s also may help with symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis."
