        "text": "Ubu Gallery\n\n16 East 78th Street, Manhattan\n\nThrough March 16\n\nThis intense group of more than 40 small works, presented in conjunction with a private dealer, Timothy Baum, is a kind of lagniappe to ''Surrealism: Desire Unbound,'' the big show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. A homage to the first art movement that set out to tangle with erotic desire and fantasy, this smaller show is a well-chosen, often witty mix of sadism, masochism, fetishism and other irrationalia.\n\nMany of the usual suspects and heavy breathers are here, among them Hans Bellmer, Man Ray, René Magritte, Marcel Jean, Marcel Duchamp, Victor Brauner, André Masson, Picasso and even Joseph Cornell. Happily, lesser-known but inventive fantasists like the Frenchman Georges Hugnet, the Czech Jindrich Styrsky and the Belgian Raoul Ubac also do their thing.\n\nHugnet, a fabricator of naughty collages, is represented by five works, among them ''In the Woods'' (1935), an outdoorsy scene that vaguely suggests a Vogue layout, in which three cowering and oddly constructed women, their clothes in disarray, are menaced by one in a fancy gown who wields a dashing whip.\n\nStyrsky is at his prime in ''Untitled (Maquette for 'Emilie Comes to Me in a Dream')'' a 1933 collage depicting a woman's body clad in boots, black panties and gloves, coyly holding a fan over her face as she lies next to a hideous skeleton whose semblance she will eventually assume. Ubac's three photographs of mannequins garbed by other artists, including a nude anointed by Masson with a birdcage over her head, are Surrealism at its most wackily elegant.\n\nThe more gruesome side is seen in Bellmer's artfully arranged distortions of dolls and doll parts, in photographs and 3-D, accompanied by a straightforward 1939 penciled portrait of a woman accomplished with superb draftsmanship. Masson's lively work includes three etchings, two of Bacchanalian cavortings and the third a close-up of a woman's genitalia that sends up ''The Origin of the World,'' Courbet's 1866 still life of the same subject in oil.\n\nDalí, Surrealism's poster boy, is not represented here, but Angel Planells, a more obscure Catalan whose style resembles the maestro's, understudies him with ''Family Phantoms'' (circa 1932), a dream painting already rife with Dalí-esque clichés.\n\nBut there's enough less familiar stuff here to make it a very beguiling show. With the Met hard by on 82nd Street, don't let this one get away. GRACE GLUECK"
