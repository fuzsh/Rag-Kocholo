        "text": "EVERYONE LOVES PIZZA. And, what’s not to love? It’s cheesy, and beyond that, you can truly make it your own: opting for a chewy or crispy crust and adding an endless array of toppings. The best part, though, is it’s often enjoyed with friends.\n\nBut, is pizza healthy?\n\n“Rather than say it is healthy or unhealthy, I will say that it can depend on what we do with the pizza in regards to the size, sauce, and toppings,” says Angel Planells, R.D.N., a Seattle-based registered dietician nutritionist and spokesperson for the Acadamy of Nutrition and Dietetics.\n\n“The reason why pizza may carry the ‘unhealthy’ moniker is that it’s usually tied to the calories, sodium, and carbohydrates,” he adds.\n\nA slice from a 14-inch cheese pizza from a restaurant chain can have 285 calories, 36 grams of carbs, and 640 milligrams of sodium, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Add pepperoni—Americans’ favorite topping—and the calories jump to 313 and sodium to 760 milligrams.\n\nTo put those sodium counts in perspective, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends adults consume no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day. So a single slice of pizza has about a third of your daily recommended sodium.\n\n(That said, sodium is only half of the equation.)\n\nStill, that doesn’t mean you should give up pizza.\n\n“It is delicious, and that is undeniable, and there still is an opportunity to enjoy this tasty treat without compromising your health and well-being,” Planells says.\n\nDietitians say several food swaps can improve the healthfulness of pizza, and it’s important not to label foods like pizza as “bad.” Any food can be enjoyed in your healthy lifestyle, in moderation.\n\nIs Pizza Healthy?\n\nIt all comes down to the ingredients, says Caroline Cederquist, M.D., a board-certified physician in family practice and functional medicine and co-founder and chief medical officer of meal delivery service .\n\n“Most restaurants and frozen options are high in calories, simple carbohydrates, sugar, sodium, and fat,” she says.\n\nCommon meaty pizza toppings like pepperoni, sausage, and ham tend to be highly processed and have been linked to heart disease and cancers, says Anna Smith, R.D.N, L.D.N., of food-tracking app Lose It!.\n\nHowever, pizza does have some healthy elements, she adds. Tomato sauce is rich in lycopene, beta-carotene, and vitamin C, and the mozzarella provides protein, calcium, and phosphorous. Depending on the crust, it might contain a blend of whole grains, seeds, or hidden vegetables.\n\nPizza Can Be Part of a Healthy Lifestyle\n\n“Just about everything can be enjoyed as part of a healthy lifestyle in moderation,” Dr. Cederquist says.\n\nAdding lots of vegetables to your pizza, pairing it with a side salad, and drinking plenty of water in between bites will help you avoid eating too many slices, she adds. “Be mindful and present while eating, and give the experience your full attention. And, truly ask yourself if you’re still hungry before grabbing another slice.”\n\nEven if you do overdo it on the pizza, don’t worry about it too much. One day of overeating likely won’t have much of an effect on your overall health, as long as you get back on track the next day.\n\nAnother tip: If you know you’re eating pizza for dinner, Dr. Cederquist suggests keeping your earlier meals light and full of lean protein and fiber to prepare yourself for the indulgence.\n\nEating pizza is a fun experience, so be sure to enjoy it. The social aspect of sharing a pie with friends is good for you. Research continues to show the health benefits of friendship and social connections.\n\nReframe How You Think About Eating Pizza\n\nAttaching “good” versus “bad” or “healthy” versus “unhealthy” labels to food can promote stress around food and might lead to disordered eating habits. “This dichotomy can make people freeze up when making food choices, especially if they have an unbalanced view of foods,” Planells says.\n\n“Having a mindset of good versus bad food attaches morality to food which doesn't tend to promote balanced eating,” Smith says.\n\nIt’s better to focus on your overall eating habits, rather than one meal or dish, she adds. “Poor health is never due to one meal. It’s usually due to a pattern of eating behaviors over time.”\n\nHow to Make Pizza Healthier\n\nIf you are looking for some ways to enjoy pizza in a healthier way, whether you’re ordering it out or making it at home, here are some tips, according to dietitians:\n\nChoose thin crust\n\nLook for whole-grain or vegetable-based crusts\n\nSkip the meat—or opt for leaner meats, like chicken or shrimp\n\nPile on the vegetable toppings\n\nGo cheese-free, or use light or low-fat cheese\n\nAdd red pepper flakes for spice without calories\n\nUse low-sugar tomato sauce—or just less or spread on pesto, instead\n\nMake a smaller pizza\n\nTop the pizza with fresh spinach or arugula once it comes out of the oven\n\nPair your pizza with a side salad with light dressing or vinaigrette to help you fill up, so you don’t grab another slice, Dr. Cederquist says.\n\n“This helps me get nutrients in and eases hunger, so I don’t feel ravenous once the pizza arrives,” she says. “Any addition of vegetables also makes for a health-savvy pizza night.”\n\nWhen you’re buying frozen pizza, be sure to read the nutritional label. Planells suggests choosing the ones with the lowest sodium and carbohydrates."
