        "text": "(German translation and French original also available) This article offers a new perspective on René Magrittes word paintings, which combine pictures and words in surprising ways. By analyzing Magritte's theoretical texts as well as his paintings, I come to the conclusion that Magritte's project differed significantly from philosophical reflections on words and pictures such as those of Plato, Saussure or Nelson Goodman. I thus oppose the common conviction that Magritte believed that linguistic signs are arbitrary or that he simply wanted to say that pictures are not the objects they depict - which is often said to be the message of his \"Treachery of Images\" (\"This is not a pipe\"). I also reject that he simply created dadaistic combinations of words and mismatching pictures for the sake of shocking. As opposed to this common view, I believe that we should take Magritte seriously when he affirms that there are names that work BETTER for objects than the names we usually use. Such better names are those of other objects that have unobvious or poetic affinities with the objects Magritte re-names in his work. Magritte was not interested in reference or denotation, rather, I argue, he was interested in a relationship between objects that he called \"elective affinity\", which he explored by confronting pictures of objects as well as names of objects and pictures of others. \"This is not a pipe\" is thus more than a denial of the identity between an object and its picture: by negating the adequacy of the object's initial name, Magritte invites us to seek another name, that better suits the object depicted, which is the name of an object that can enter into an interesting relationship with the pipe. This is something which becomes more obvious when the work is read in the light of \"Words and images\" and \"Key of dreams\" that were painted before (1927) and published simultaneously (1929). The quest for \"elective affinities\" is essential for Magritte and he illustrates it both in paintings with pictures only and in paintings that combine pictures with words. As opposed to the interest philosophy has taken in the way words and pictures refer to the world, Magritte's works are about the relationships between objects in the world itself. His style of painting aims at effacing the trace of the maker and thus, as he says, \"facilitating a natural exchange between the world and its representations\". Magritte's works are really \"serious games\" that can teach us how to find new affinities in order to free ourselves from the purely functional perspective on the objects of the world. In this I argue, he joins Rainer Maria Rilke's poetic quest. As Magritte states himself: \"I would be glad if my works weren't necessary any more to make spectators think of what they show.\""
