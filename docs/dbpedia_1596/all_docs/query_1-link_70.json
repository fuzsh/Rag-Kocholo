        "text": "Kinetic energy equations for the average-passage equation system\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nJohnson, Richard W.; Adamczyk, John J.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nImportant kinetic energy equations derived from the average-passage equation sets are documented, with a view to their interrelationships. These kinetic equations may be used for closing the average-passage equations. The turbulent kinetic energy transport equation used is formed by subtracting the mean kinetic energy equation from the averaged total instantaneous kinetic energy equation. The aperiodic kinetic energy equation, averaged steady kinetic energy equation, averaged unsteady kinetic energy equation, and periodic kinetic energy equation, are also treated.\n\np-Euler equations and p-Navier-Stokes equations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLi, Lei; Liu, Jian-Guo\n\n2018-04-01\n\nWe propose in this work new systems of equations which we call p-Euler equations and p-Navier-Stokes equations. p-Euler equations are derived as the Euler-Lagrange equations for the action represented by the Benamou-Brenier characterization of Wasserstein-p distances, with incompressibility constraint. p-Euler equations have similar structures with the usual Euler equations but the 'momentum' is the signed (p - 1)-th power of the velocity. In the 2D case, the p-Euler equations have streamfunction-vorticity formulation, where the vorticity is given by the p-Laplacian of the streamfunction. By adding diffusion presented by Î³-Laplacian of the velocity, we obtain what we call p-Navier-Stokes equations. If Î³ = p, the a priori energy estimates for the velocity and momentum have dual symmetries. Using these energy estimates and a time-shift estimate, we show the global existence of weak solutions for the p-Navier-Stokes equations in Rd for Î³ = p and p â¥ d â¥ 2 through a compactness criterion.\n\nHammett equation and generalized Pauling's electronegativity equation.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Lei; Fu, Yao; Liu, Rui; Li, Rui-Qiong; Guo, Qing-Xiang\n\n2004-01-01\n\nSubstituent interaction energy (SIE) was defined as the energy change of the isodesmic reaction X-spacer-Y + H-spacer-H --> X-spacer-H + H-spacer-Y. It was found that this SIE followed a simple equation, SIE(X,Y) = -ksigma(X)sigma(Y), where k was a constant dependent on the system and sigma was a certain scale of electronic substituent constant. It was demonstrated that the equation was applicable to disubstituted bicyclo[2.2.2]octanes, benzenes, ethylenes, butadienes, and hexatrienes. It was also demonstrated that Hammett's equation was a derivative form of the above equation. Furthermore, it was found that when spacer = nil the above equation was mathematically the same as Pauling's electronegativity equation. Thus it was shown that Hammett's equation was a derivative form of the generalized Pauling's electronegativity equation and that a generalized Pauling's electronegativity equation could be utilized for diverse X-spacer-Y systems. In addition, the total electronic substituent effects were successfully separated into field/inductive and resonance effects in the equation SIE(X,Y) = -k(1)F(X)F(Y) - k(2)R(X)R(Y) - k(3)(F(X)R(Y) + R(X)F(Y)). The existence of the cross term (i.e., F(X)R(Y) and R(X)F(Y)) suggested that the field/inductive effect was not orthogonal to the resonance effect because the field/inductive effect from one substituent interacted with the resonance effect from the other. Further studies on multi-substituted systems suggested that the electronic substituent effects should be pairwise and additive. Hence, the SIE in a multi-substituted system could be described using the equation SIE(X1, X2, ..., Xn) = Sigma(n-1)(i=1)Sigma(n)(j=i+1)k(ij)sigma(X)isigma(X)j.\n\nComputing generalized Langevin equations and generalized Fokker-Planck equations.\n\nPubMed\n\nDarve, Eric; Solomon, Jose; Kia, Amirali\n\n2009-07-07\n\nThe Mori-Zwanzig formalism is an effective tool to derive differential equations describing the evolution of a small number of resolved variables. In this paper we present its application to the derivation of generalized Langevin equations and generalized non-Markovian Fokker-Planck equations. We show how long time scales rates and metastable basins can be extracted from these equations. Numerical algorithms are proposed to discretize these equations. An important aspect is the numerical solution of the orthogonal dynamics equation which is a partial differential equation in a high dimensional space. We propose efficient numerical methods to solve this orthogonal dynamics equation. In addition, we present a projection formalism of the Mori-Zwanzig type that is applicable to discrete maps. Numerical applications are presented from the field of Hamiltonian systems.\n\nBasic lubrication equations\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHamrock, B. J.; Dowson, D.\n\n1981-01-01\n\nLubricants, usually Newtonian fluids, are assumed to experience laminar flow. The basic equations used to describe the flow are the Navier-Stokes equation of motion. The study of hydrodynamic lubrication is, from a mathematical standpoint, the application of a reduced form of these Navier-Stokes equations in association with the continuity equation. The Reynolds equation can also be derived from first principles, provided of course that the same basic assumptions are adopted in each case. Both methods are used in deriving the Reynolds equation, and the assumptions inherent in reducing the Navier-Stokes equations are specified. Because the Reynolds equation contains viscosity and density terms and these properties depend on temperature and pressure, it is often necessary to couple the Reynolds with energy equation. The lubricant properties and the energy equation are presented. Film thickness, a parameter of the Reynolds equation, is a function of the elastic behavior of the bearing surface. The governing elasticity equation is therefore presented.\n\nComparison of Kernel Equating and Item Response Theory Equating Methods\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMeng, Yu\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe kernel method of test equating is a unified approach to test equating with some advantages over traditional equating methods.

The magnitude of theâ¦\n\nDouble-Plate Penetration Equations\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHayashida, K. B.; Robinson, J. H.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nThis report compares seven double-plate penetration predictor equations for accuracy and effectiveness of a shield design. Three of the seven are the Johnson Space Center original, modified, and new Cour-Palais equations. The other four are the Nysmith, Lundeberg-Stern-Bristow, Burch, and Wilkinson equations. These equations, except the Wilkinson equation, were derived from test results, with the velocities ranging up to 8 km/sec. Spreadsheet software calculated the projectile diameters for various velocities for the different equations. The results were plotted on projectile diameter versus velocity graphs for the expected orbital debris impact velocities ranging from 2 to 15 km/sec. The new Cour-Palais double-plate penetration equation was compared to the modified Cour-Palais single-plate penetration equation. Then the predictions from each of the seven double-plate penetration equations were compared to each other for a chosen shield design. Finally, these results from the equations were compared with test results performed at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. Because the different equations predict a wide range of projectile diameters at any given velocity, it is very difficult to choose the \"right\" prediction equation for shield configurations other than those exactly used in the equations' development. Although developed for various materials, the penetration equations alone cannot be relied upon to accurately predict the effectiveness of a shield without using hypervelocity impact tests to verify the design.\n\nThe Effectiveness of Circular Equating as a Criterion for Evaluating Equating.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nWang, Tianyou; Hanson, Bradley A.; Harris, Deborah J.\n\nEquating a test form to itself through a chain of equatings, commonly referred to as circular equating, has been widely used as a criterion to evaluate the adequacy of equating. This paper uses both analytical methods and simulation methods to show that this criterion is in general invalid in serving this purpose. For the random groups design doneâ¦\n\nNew Equating Methods and Their Relationships with Levine Observed Score Linear Equating under the Kernel Equating Framework\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nChen, Haiwen; Holland, Paul\n\n2010-01-01\n\nIn this paper, we develop a new curvilinear equating for the nonequivalent groups with anchor test (NEAT) design under the assumption of the classical test theory model, that we name curvilinear Levine observed score equating.

In order to combine these two worlds in a common formalism, at least one of them must sacrifice one of its dogmas. Linearizing nonlinear dynamics would destroy the fundamental property of this theory, however, it can be shown that quantum mechanics can be reformulated in terms of nonlinear Riccati equations. In a first step, it will be shown that the information about the dynamics of quantum systems with analytical solutions can not only be obtainable from the time-dependent SchrÃ¶dinger equation but equally-well from a complex Riccati equation. Comparison with supersymmetric quantum mechanics shows that even additional information can be obtained from the nonlinear formulation. Furthermore, the time-independent SchrÃ¶dinger equation can also be rewritten as a complex Riccati equation for any potential. Extension of the Riccati formulation to include irreversible dissipative effects is straightforward. Via (real and complex) Riccati equations, other fields of physics can also be treated within the same formalism, e.g., statistical thermodynamics, nonlinear dynamical systems like those obeying a logistic equation as well as wave equations in classical optics, Bose- Einstein condensates and cosmological models. Finally, the link to abstract \"quantizations\" such as the Pythagorean triples and Riccati equations connected with trigonometric and hyperbolic functions will be shown.\n\nBridging the Knowledge Gaps between Richards' Equation and Budyko Equation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, D.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe empirical Budyko equation represents the partitioning of mean annual precipitation into evaporation and runoff. Richards' equation, based on Darcy's law, represents the movement of water in unsaturated soils. The linkage between Richards' equation and Budyko equation is presented by invoking the empirical Soil Conservation Service curve number (SCS-CN) model for computing surface runoff at the event-scale. The basis of the SCS-CN method is the proportionality relationship, i.e., the ratio of continuing abstraction to its potential is equal to the ratio of surface runoff to its potential value. The proportionality relationship can be derived from the Richards' equation for computing infiltration excess and saturation excess models at the catchment scale. Meanwhile, the generalized proportionality relationship is demonstrated as the common basis of SCS-CN method, monthly \"abcd\" model, and Budyko equation. Therefore, the linkage between Darcy's law and the emergent pattern of mean annual water balance at the catchment scale is presented through the proportionality relationship.\n\nTurning Equations Into Stories: Using \"Equation Dictionaries\" in an Introductory Geophysics Class\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCaplan-Auerbach, J.\n\n2008-12-01\n\nTo students with math fear, equations can be intimidating and overwhelming. This discomfort is reflected in some of the frequent questions heard in introductory geophysics: \"which equation should I use?\" and \"does T stand for travel time or period?\" Questions such as these indicate that many students view equations as a series of variables and operators rather than as a representation of a physical process. To solve a problem they may simply look for an equation with the correct variables and assume that it meets their needs, rather than selecting an equation that represents the appropriate physical process. These issues can be addressed by encouraging students to think of equations as stories, and to describe them in prose. This is the goal of the Equation Dictionary project, used in Western Washington University's introductory geophysics course. Throughout the course, students create personal equation dictionaries, adding an entry each time an equation is introduced. Entries consist of (a) the equation itself, (b) a brief description of equation variables, (c) a prose description of the physical process described by the equation, and (d) any additional notes that help them understand the equation. Thus, rather than simply writing down the equations for the velocity of body waves, a student might write \"The speed of a seismic body wave is controlled by the material properties of the medium through which it passes.\" In a study of gravity a student might note that the International Gravity Formula describes \"the expected value of g at a given latitude, correcting for Earth's shape and rotation.\" In writing these definitions students learn that equations are simplified descriptions of physical processes, and that understanding the process is more useful than memorizing a sequence of variables. Dictionaries also serve as formula sheets for exams, which encourages students to write definitions that are meaningful to them, and to organize their thoughts clearly. Finally\n\nEvaluating Equating Results: Percent Relative Error for Chained Kernel Equating\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nJiang, Yanlin; von Davier, Alina A.; Chen, Haiwen\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThis article presents a method for evaluating equating results. Within the kernel equating framework, the percent relative error (PRE) for chained equipercentile equating was computed under the nonequivalent groups with anchor test (NEAT) design. The method was applied to two data sets to obtain the PRE, which can be used to measure equatingâ¦\n\nGeneralized Thomas-Fermi equations as the Lampariello class of Emden-Fowler equations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRosu, Haret C.; Mancas, Stefan C.\n\n2017-04-01\n\nA one-parameter family of Emden-Fowler equations defined by Lampariello's parameter p which, upon using Thomas-Fermi boundary conditions, turns into a set of generalized Thomas-Fermi equations comprising the standard Thomas-Fermi equation for p = 1 is studied in this paper. The entire family is shown to be non integrable by reduction to the corresponding Abel equations whose invariants do not satisfy a known integrability condition. We also discuss the equivalent dynamical system of equations for the standard Thomas-Fermi equation and perform its phase-plane analysis. The results of the latter analysis are similar for the whole class.\n\nSingle wall penetration equations\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHayashida, K. B.; Robinson, J. H.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nFive single plate penetration equations are compared for accuracy and effectiveness. These five equations are two well-known equations (Fish-Summers and Schmidt-Holsapple), two equations developed by the Apollo project (Rockwell and Johnson Space Center (JSC), and one recently revised from JSC (Cour-Palais). They were derived from test results, with velocities ranging up to 8 km/s. Microsoft Excel software was used to construct a spreadsheet to calculate the diameters and masses of projectiles for various velocities, varying the material properties of both projectile and target for the five single plate penetration equations. The results were plotted on diameter versus velocity graphs for ballistic and spallation limits using Cricket Graph software, for velocities ranging from 2 to 15 km/s defined for the orbital debris. First, these equations were compared to each other, then each equation was compared with various aluminum projectile densities. Finally, these equations were compared with test results performed at JSC for the Marshall Space Flight Center. These equations predict a wide variety of projectile diameters at a given velocity. Thus, it is very difficult to choose the 'right' prediction equation. The thickness of a single plate could have a large variation by choosing a different penetration equation. Even though all five equations are empirically developed with various materials, especially for aluminum alloys, one cannot be confident in the shield design with the predictions obtained by the penetration equations without verifying by tests.\n\nThe Fourier transforms for the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation and Landau equation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMeng, Fei; Liu, Fang\n\n2018-03-01\n\nIn this paper, we study the Fourier transforms for two equations arising in the kinetic theory. The first equation is the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation. The Fourier transform of the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation has been first addressed by Bobylev (Sov Sci Rev C Math Phys 7:111-233, 1988) in the Maxwellian case. Alexandre et al. (Arch Ration Mech Anal 152(4):327-355, 2000) investigated the Fourier transform of the gain operator for the Boltzmann operator in the cut-off case. Recently, the Fourier transform of the Boltzmann equation is extended to hard or soft potential with cut-off by Kirsch and Rjasanow (J Stat Phys 129:483-492, 2007). We shall first establish the relation between the results in Alexandre et al. (2000) and Kirsch and Rjasanow (2007) for the Fourier transform of the Boltzmann operator in the cut-off case. Then we give the Fourier transform of the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation in the non cut-off case. It is shown that our results cover previous works (Bobylev 1988; Kirsch and Rjasanow 2007). The second equation is the spatially homogeneous Landau equation, which can be obtained as a limit of the Boltzmann equation when grazing collisions prevail. Following the method in Kirsch and Rjasanow (2007), we can also derive the Fourier transform for Landau equation.\n\nHow to Obtain the Covariant Form of Maxwell's Equations from the Continuity Equation\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nHeras, Jose A.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe covariant Maxwell equations are derived from the continuity equation for the electric charge.

The behaviors are interpreted in terms of the memory effect of the fractional time derivatives included in the equations. Some examples are given by solutions of the FDE.\n\nA generalized simplest equation method and its application to the Boussinesq-Burgers equation.\n\nPubMed\n\nSudao, Bilige; Wang, Xiaomin\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIn this paper, a generalized simplest equation method is proposed to seek exact solutions of nonlinear evolution equations (NLEEs). In the method, we chose a solution expression with a variable coefficient and a variable coefficient ordinary differential auxiliary equation. This method can yield a BÃ¤cklund transformation between NLEEs and a related constraint equation. By dealing with the constraint equation, we can derive infinite number of exact solutions for NLEEs. These solutions include the traveling wave solutions, non-traveling wave solutions, multi-soliton solutions, rational solutions, and other types of solutions. As applications, we obtained wide classes of exact solutions for the Boussinesq-Burgers equation by using the generalized simplest equation method.\n\nA Generalized Simplest Equation Method and Its Application to the Boussinesq-Burgers Equation\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSudao, Bilige; Wang, Xiaomin\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIn this paper, a generalized simplest equation method is proposed to seek exact solutions of nonlinear evolution equations (NLEEs).

In this case, computations cannot be based on the widely used KZK equation since it applies only to small angles. To benefit from successful computational schemes from elastodynamics and electromagnetics, we propose to use two first-order acoustic field equations, accompanied by two constitutive equations, as an alternative basis. This formulation quite naturally results in the contrast source formalism, makes a clear distinction between fundamental conservation laws and medium behavior, and allows for a straightforward inclusion of any medium inhomogenities. This paper is concerned with the derivation of relevant constitutive equations. We take a pragmatic approach and aim to find those constitutive equations that represent the same medium as implicitly described by the recognized, full wave, nonlinear equations such as the generalized Westervelt equation. We will show how this is achieved by considering the nonlinear case without attenuation, the linear case with attenuation, and the nonlinear case with attenuation. As a result we will obtain surprisingly simple constitutive equations for the full wave case.\n\nReduction of lattice equations to the PainlevÃ© equations: PIV and PV\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNakazono, Nobutaka\n\n2018-02-01\n\nIn this paper, we construct a new relation between Adler-Bobenko-Suris equations and PainlevÃ© equations.

It is argued that this system of equations is the proper system that represents integrable structures in three dimensions generalizing the Yang{endash}Baxter equation. Under additional restrictions this system reduces to the usual tetrahedron equation in the vertex form. Most known solutions fall under this class, but it is by no means necessary. Comparison is made with the work on braided monoidal 2-categories also leading to eight tetrahedron equations. {copyright} {ital 1997 American Institute of Physics.}\n\nConservational PDF Equations of Turbulence\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nShih, Tsan-Hsing; Liu, Nan-Suey\n\n2010-01-01\n\nRecently we have revisited the traditional probability density function (PDF) equations for the velocity and species in turbulent incompressible flows. They are all unclosed due to the appearance of various conditional means which are modeled empirically. However, we have observed that it is possible to establish a closed velocity PDF equation and a closed joint velocity and species PDF equation through conditions derived from the integral form of the Navier-Stokes equations. Although, in theory, the resulted PDF equations are neither general nor unique, they nevertheless lead to the exact transport equations for the first moment as well as all higher order moments. We refer these PDF equations as the conservational PDF equations. This observation is worth further exploration for its validity and CFD application\n\nTrue amplitude wave equation migration arising from true amplitude one-way wave equations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, Yu; Zhang, Guanquan; Bleistein, Norman\n\n2003-10-01\n\nOne-way wave operators are powerful tools for use in forward modelling and inversion. Their implementation, however, involves introduction of the square root of an operator as a pseudo-differential operator. Furthermore, a simple factoring of the wave operator produces one-way wave equations that yield the same travel times as the full wave equation, but do not yield accurate amplitudes except for homogeneous media and for almost all points in heterogeneous media. Here, we present augmented one-way wave equations. We show that these equations yield solutions for which the leading order asymptotic amplitude as well as the travel time satisfy the same differential equations as the corresponding functions for the full wave equation. Exact representations of the square-root operator appearing in these differential equations are elusive, except in cases in which the heterogeneity of the medium is independent of the transverse spatial variables. Here, we address the fully heterogeneous case. Singling out depth as the preferred direction of propagation, we introduce a representation of the square-root operator as an integral in which a rational function of the transverse Laplacian appears in the integrand. This allows us to carry out explicit asymptotic analysis of the resulting one-way wave equations. To do this, we introduce an auxiliary function that satisfies a lower dimensional wave equation in transverse spatial variables only. We prove that ray theory for these one-way wave equations leads to one-way eikonal equations and the correct leading order transport equation for the full wave equation. We then introduce appropriate boundary conditions at z = 0 to generate waves at depth whose quotient leads to a reflector map and an estimate of the ray theoretical reflection coefficient on the reflector. Thus, these true amplitude one-way wave equations lead to a 'true amplitude wave equation migration' (WEM) method. In fact, we prove that applying the WEM imaging condition\n\nDerivation of kinetic equations from non-Wiener stochastic differential equations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBasharov, A.

The equation is separable, the solution of the angular part is a spin-weighted spherical harmonic, and the radial wave function may be expressed in terms of solutions of the Heun equation which has four regular singular points. We also consider various special cases of the metric and find that the angular wave functions are the same for all cases, the actual shape of the metric functions affects only the radial wave function. It is interesting to note that each radial equation can be transformed into a known ordinary differential equation (i.e.Â Heun equation, or confluent Heun equation, or hypergeometric equation). The results show that there are analytic solutions for all the wave equations of massless spin fields in the spacetimes of conformal gravity.

The boundaries of the problems are assumed to be smooth closed contours. The solution on the boundary is treated as a periodic function, which is in turn approximated by a truncated Fourier series. A Fourier collocation method is followed in which the boundary integral equation is transformed into a system of algebraic equations. It is shown that in order to achieve spectral accuracy for the numerical formulation, the nonsmoothness of the integral kernels, associated with the Helmholtz equation, must be carefully removed. The emphasis of the paper is on investigating the essential elements of removing the nonsmoothness of the integral kernels in the spectral implementation. The present method is robust for a general boundary contour. Aspects of efficient implementation of the method using FFT are also discussed. A numerical example of wave scattering is given in which the exponential accuracy of the present numerical method is demonstrated.\n\nThe numerical solution of linear multi-term fractional differential equations: systems of equations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEdwards, John T.; Ford, Neville J.; Simpson, A.

The deterministic rate equation (RE) method has often been used to simulate the surface chemistry. But this method becomes inaccurate when the number of reacting particles per grain is typically less than one, which can occur in the ISM. In this condition, stochastic approaches such as the master equations are adopted. However, these methods have mostly been constrained to small chemical networks due to the large amounts of processor time and computer power required. In this study, we present a hybrid method consisting of the moment equation approximation to the stochastic master equation approach and deterministic rate equations to treat a gas-grain model of homogeneous cold cloud cores with time-independent physical conditions. In this model, we use the standard OSU gas phase network (version OSU2006V3) which involves 458 gas phase species and more than 4000 reactions, and treat it by deterministic rate equations. A medium-sized surface reaction network which consists of 21 species and 19 reactions accounts for the productions of stable molecules such as H_2O, CO, CO_2, H_2CO, CH_3OH, NH_3 and CH_4. These surface reactions are treated by a hybrid method of moment equations (Barzel & Biham 2007) and rate equations: when the abundance of a surface species is lower than a specific threshold, say one per grain, we use the ``stochastic\" moment equations to simulate the evolution; when its abundance goes above this threshold, we use the rate equations. A continuity technique is utilized to secure a smooth transition between these two methods. We have run chemical simulations for a time up to 10^8 yr at three temperatures: 10 K, 15 K, and 20 K. The results will be compared with those generated from (1) a completely deterministic model that uses rate equations for both gas phase and grain surface chemistry, (2) the method of modified rate equations (Garrod\n\nField equations from Killing spinors\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAÃ§Ä±k, ÃzgÃ¼r\n\n2018-02-01\n\nFrom the Killing spinor equation and the equations satisfied by their bilinears, we deduce some well-known bosonic and fermionic field equations of mathematical physics. Aside from the trivially satisfied Dirac equation, these relativistic wave equations in curved spacetimes, respectively, are Klein-Gordon, Maxwell, Proca, Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau, KÃ¤hler, twistor, and Rarita-Schwinger equations. This result shows that, besides being special kinds of Dirac fermions, Killing fermions can be regarded as physically fundamental. For the Maxwell case, the problem of motion is analysed in a reverse manner with respect to the studies of Einstein-Groemer-Infeld-Hoffmann and Jean Marie Souriau. In the analysis of the gravitino field, a generalised 3-Ï rule is found which is termed the vanishing trace constraint.\n\nConstruction of Chained True Score Equipercentile Equatings under the Kernel Equating (KE) Framework and Their Relationship to Levine True Score Equating.

That is, when an equation possesses the Painleve property, a Baecklund transformation is defined in terms of an expansion about the singular manifold. This Baecklund transformation obtains (1) a type of modified equation that is formulated in terms of Schwarzian derivatives and (2) a Miura transformation from the modified to the original equation. By linearizing the (Ricati-type) Miura transformation the Lax pair is found. On the other hand, consideration of the (distinct) Baecklund transformations of the modified equations provides a method for themoreÂ Â» iterative construction of rational solutions. This also obtains the Lax pairs for the modified equations. In this paper we apply this method to the Kadomtsev--Petviashvili equation and the Hirota--Satsuma equations.Â«Â less\n\nParallels between control PDE's (Partial Differential Equations) and systems of ODE's (Ordinary Differential Equations)\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHunt, L. R.; Villarreal, Ramiro\n\n1987-01-01\n\nSystem theorists understand that the same mathematical objects which determine controllability for nonlinear control systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) also determine hypoellipticity for linear partial differentail equations (PDEs). Moreover, almost any study of ODE systems begins with linear systems. It is remarkable that Hormander's paper on hypoellipticity of second order linear p.d.e.'s starts with equations due to Kolmogorov, which are shown to be analogous to the linear PDEs. Eigenvalue placement by state feedback for a controllable linear system can be paralleled for a Kolmogorov equation if an appropriate type of feedback is introduced. Results concerning transformations of nonlinear systems to linear systems are similar to results for transforming a linear PDE to a Kolmogorov equation.\n\nThe non-autonomous YdKN equation and generalized symmetries of Boll equations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGubbiotti, G.; Scimiterna, C.; Levi, D.\n\n2017-05-01\n\nIn this paper, we study the integrability of a class of nonlinear non-autonomous quad graph equations compatible around the cube introduced by Boll in the framework of the generalized Adler, Bobenko, and Suris (ABS) classification.

Since the discovery of X-ray diffraction, various methods of using it to solve crystal structures have been developed. The major methods used can be divided into two categories: (1) Patterson function based methods; (2) Direct phase-determination methods. In the early days of structure determination from X-ray diffraction, Patterson methods played the leading role. Direct phase-determining methods ('direct methods' for short) were introduced by D. Harker and J. S. Kasper in the form of inequality relationships in 1948. A significant development of direct methods was produced by Sayre (1952). The equation he introduced, generally called Sayre's equation, gives exact relationships between structure factors for equal atoms. Later Cochran (1955) derived the so-called triple phase relationship, the main means by which it has become possible to find the structure factor phases automatically by computer. Although the background theory of direct methods is very mathematical, the user of direct-methods computer programs needs no detailed knowledge of these automatic processes in order to solve structures. Recently introduced direct methods are based on Sayre's equation, so it is important to investigate its properties thoroughly. One such new method involves the Sayre equation tangent formula (SETF) which attempts to minimise the least square residual for the Sayre's equations (Debaerdemaeker, Tate and Woolfson; 1985). In chapters I-III the principles and developments of direct methods will be described and in chapters IV -VI the properties of Sayre's equation and its modification will be discussed. Finally, in chapter VII, there will be described the investigation of the possible use of an equation, similar in type to Sayre's equation, derived from the characteristics of the Patterson function.\n\nImproving multilevel Monte Carlo for stochastic differential equations with application to the Langevin equation.\n\nPubMed\n\nMÃ¼ller, Eike H; Scheichl, Rob; Shardlow, Tony\n\n2015-04-08\n\nThis paper applies several well-known tricks from the numerical treatment of deterministic differential equations to improve the efficiency of the multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and especially the Langevin equation. We use modified equations analysis as an alternative to strong-approximation theory for the integrator, and we apply this to introduce MLMC for Langevin-type equations with integrators based on operator splitting. We combine this with extrapolation and investigate the use of discrete random variables in place of the Gaussian increments, which is a well-known technique for the weak approximation of SDEs. We show that, for small-noise problems, discrete random variables can lead to an increase in efficiency of almost two orders of magnitude for practical levels of accuracy.\n\nConstruction and accuracy of partial differential equation approximations to the chemical master equation.\n\nPubMed\n\nGrima, Ramon\n\n2011-11-01\n\nThe mesoscopic description of chemical kinetics, the chemical master equation, can be exactly solved in only a few simple cases. The analytical intractability stems from the discrete character of the equation, and hence considerable effort has been invested in the development of Fokker-Planck equations, second-order partial differential equation approximations to the master equation. We here consider two different types of higher-order partial differential approximations, one derived from the system-size expansion and the other from the Kramers-Moyal expansion, and derive the accuracy of their predictions for chemical reactive networks composed of arbitrary numbers of unimolecular and bimolecular reactions. In particular, we show that the partial differential equation approximation of order Q from the Kramers-Moyal expansion leads to estimates of the mean number of molecules accurate to order Î©(-(2Q-3)/2), of the variance of the fluctuations in the number of molecules accurate to order Î©(-(2Q-5)/2), and of skewness accurate to order Î©(-(Q-2)). We also show that for large Q, the accuracy in the estimates can be matched only by a partial differential equation approximation from the system-size expansion of approximate order 2Q. Hence, we conclude that partial differential approximations based on the Kramers-Moyal expansion generally lead to considerably more accurate estimates in the mean, variance, and skewness than approximations of the same order derived from the system-size expansion.\n\nOptimization of one-way wave equations.\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nLee, M.W.; Suh, S.Y.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nThe theory of wave extrapolation is based on the square-root equation or one-way equation.

Eliminating the symmetries of the equation, we can construct difference equations (DCE) or numerical integrations equivalent to some ODEs or PDEs that means both have the same solution functions. When arbitrary functions are given, whether we can construct numerical integrations that have solution functions equal to given function or not are treated in this work. Nowadays, Lie's symmetries solver for ODE and PDE has been implemented in many symbolic software. Using this solver we can construct algebraic DCEs or numerical integrations which are correspond to some ODEs or PDEs. In this work, we treated exact correspondence between ODE or PDE and DCE or numerical integration with GrÃ¶bner base and Janet base from the view of Lie's symmetries.\n\nGeneralization of the lightning electromagnetic equations of Uman, McLain, and Krider based on Jefimenko equations\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nShao, Xuan-Min\n\n2016-04-12\n\nThe fundamental electromagnetic equations used by lightning researchers were introduced in a seminal paper by Uman, McLain, and Krider in 1975. However, these equations were derived for an infinitely thin, one-dimensional source current, and not for a general three-dimensional current distribution. In this paper, we introduce a corresponding pair of generalized equations that are determined from a three-dimensional, time-dependent current density distribution based on Jefimenko's original electric and magnetic equations. To do this, we derive the Jefimenko electric field equation into a new form that depends only on the time-dependent current density similar to that of Uman, McLain, and Krider,moreÂ Â» rather than on both the charge and current densities in its original form. The original Jefimenko magnetic field equation depends only on current, so no further derivation is needed. We show that the equations of Uman, McLain, and Krider can be readily obtained from the generalized equations if a one-dimensional source current is considered. For the purpose of practical applications, we discuss computational implementation of the new equations and present electric field calculations for a three-dimensional, conical-shape discharge.Â«Â less\n\nComparison between results of solution of Burgers' equation and Laplace's equation by Galerkin and least-square finite element methods\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAdib, Arash; Poorveis, Davood; Mehraban, Farid\n\n2018-03-01\n\nIn this research, two equations are considered as examples of hyperbolic and elliptic equations. In addition, two finite element methods are applied for solving of these equations. The purpose of this research is the selection of suitable method for solving each of two equations. Burgers' equation is a hyperbolic equation. This equation is a pure advection (without diffusion) equation. This equation is one-dimensional and unsteady. A sudden shock wave is introduced to the model. This wave moves without deformation. In addition, Laplace's equation is an elliptical equation. This equation is steady and two-dimensional. The solution of Laplace's equation in an earth dam is considered. By solution of Laplace's equation, head pressure and the value of seepage in the directions X and Y are calculated in different points of earth dam. At the end, water table is shown in the earth dam. For Burgers' equation, least-square method can show movement of wave with oscillation but Galerkin method can not show it correctly (the best method for solving of the Burgers' equation is discrete space by least-square finite element method and discrete time by forward difference.). For Laplace's equation, Galerkin and least square methods can show water table correctly in earth dam.\n\nImproving multilevel Monte Carlo for stochastic differential equations with application to the Langevin equation\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMÃ¼ller, Eike H.; Scheichl, Rob; Shardlow, Tony\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis paper applies several well-known tricks from the numerical treatment of deterministic differential equations to improve the efficiency of the multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and especially the Langevin equation.

This allows us to study in simple way integrable spin chains in the thermodynamic limit. Based on the functional equations we give the procedure that allows finding the subleading orders in the solution of various integral equations solved to the leading order by the Wiener-Hopf technics. The integral equations are studied in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, where their solution allows verification of the integrability conjecture up to two loops of the strong coupling expansion. In the context of the two-dimensional sigma models we analyze the large-order behavior of the asymptotic perturbative expansion. Obtained experience with the functional representation of the integral equations allowed us also to solve explicitly the crossing equations that appear in the AdS/CFT spectral problem.\n\nReflections on Chemical Equations.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nGorman, Mel\n\n1981-01-01\n\nThe issue of how much emphasis balancing chemical equations should have in an introductory chemistry course is discussed.

For this purpose the problems of quantum mechanics arising from the limitations of classical mechanics are discussed. These limitations, in particular, preclude the use of the Schrodinger equation to describe the time symmetry violation. The extension of the Schrodinger equation is realized based on the principle of duality symmetry. According to this principle the dynamics of the systems is determined by the symmetry of the system and by the symmetry of the space. The extension of the Schrodinger equation was obtained from the dual expression of energy, represented in operator form. For this purpose the independent micro - and macro-variables that determine respectively the dynamics of quantum particle system relative to its center of mass and the movement of the center of mass in space are used. The solution of the extended Schrodinger equation for the system near equilibrium is submitted. The main advantage of the extended Schrodinger equation is that it is applicable to describe the interaction and evolution of quantum systems in inhomogeneous field of external forces.\n\nMetrisability of PainlevÃ© equations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nContatto, Felipe; Dunajski, Maciej\n\n2018-02-01\n\nWe solve the metrisability problem for the six PainlevÃ© equations, and more generally for all 2nd order ordinary differential equations with the PainlevÃ© property, and determine for which of these equations their integral curves are geodesics of a (pseudo) Riemannian metric on a surface.\n\nThe Forced Hard Spring Equation\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nFay, Temple H.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThrough numerical investigations, various examples of the Duffing type forced spring equation with epsilon positive, are studied.

Since many problems in classical mechanics can be formulated as geodesic problems in curved space and spacetime, solving the defining equation for Killing tensor fields (the Killing equation) is a powerful way to integrate equations of motion. Thus it has been desirable to formulate the integrability conditions of the Killing equation, which serve to determine the number of linearly independent solutions and also to restrict the possible forms of solutions tightly. In this paper, we show the prolongation for the Killing equation in a manner that uses Young symmetrizers. Using the prolonged equations, we provide the integrability conditions explicitly.\n\nAdaptive Osher-type scheme for the Euler equations with highly nonlinear equations of state\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLee, Bok Jik; Toro, Eleuterio F.; Castro, CristÃ³bal E.; Nikiforakis, Nikolaos\n\n2013-08-01\n\nFor the numerical simulation of detonation of condensed phase explosives, a complex equation of state (EOS), such as the Jones-Wilkins-Lee (JWL) EOS or the Cochran-Chan (C-C) EOS, are widely used. However, when a conservative scheme is used for solving the Euler equations with such equations of state, a spurious solution across the contact discontinuity, a well known phenomenon in multi-fluid systems, arises even for single materials. In this work, we develop a generalised Osher-type scheme in an adaptive primitive-conservative framework to overcome the aforementioned difficulties. Resulting numerical solutions are compared with the exact solutions and with the numerical solutions from the Godunov method in conjunction with the exact Riemann solver for the Euler equations with Mie-GrÃ¼neisen form of equations of state, such as the JWL and the C-C equations of state. The adaptive scheme is extended to second order and its empirical convergence rates are presented, verifying second order accuracy for smooth solutions. Through a suite of several tests problems in one and two space dimensions we illustrate the failure of conservative schemes and the capability of the methods of this paper to overcome the difficulties.\n\nGroup foliation of finite difference equations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nThompson, Robert; Valiquette, Francis\n\n2018-06-01\n\nUsing the theory of equivariant moving frames, a group foliation method for invariant finite difference equations is developed. This method is analogous to the group foliation of differential equations and uses the symmetry group of the equation to decompose the solution process into two steps, called resolving and reconstruction. Our constructions are performed algorithmically and symbolically by making use of discrete recurrence relations among joint invariants. Applications to invariant finite difference equations that approximate differential equations are given.\n\nEquating with Miditests Using IRT\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nFitzpatrick, Joseph; Skorupski, William P.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe equating performance of two internal anchor test structures--miditests and minitests--is studied for four IRT equating methods using simulated data.

One can find in the literature, the opinion that the Wheeler-DeWitt equation is even more fundamental than the basic equation of quantum theory, the SchrÃ¶dinger equation. We still should remember that we are in the situation when no observational data can confirm or reject the fundamental status of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, so we can give just indirect arguments in favor of or against it, grounded on mathematical consistency and physical relevance. I shall present the analysis of the situation and comparison of the standard Wheeler-DeWitt approach with the extended phase space approach to quantization of gravity. In my analysis, I suppose, first, that a future quantum theory of gravity must be applicable to all phenomena from the early universe to quantum effects in strong gravitational fields, in the latter case, the state of the observer (the choice of a reference frame) may appear to be significant. Second, I suppose that the equation for the wave function of the universe must not be postulated but derived by means of a mathematically consistent procedure, which exists in path integral quantization. When applying this procedure to any gravitating system, one should take into account features of gravity, namely, nontrivial spacetime topology and possible absence of asymptotic states. The SchrÃ¶dinger equation has been derived early for cosmological models with a finite number of degrees of freedom, and just recently it has been found for the spherically symmetric model which is a simplest model with an infinite number of degrees of freedom. The structure of the SchrÃ¶dinger equation and its general solution appears to be very similar in these cases. The obtained results give grounds to say that the SchrÃ¶dinger equation retains its fundamental meaning in constructing quantum theory of gravity.\n\nReduction of the equation for lower hybrid waves in a plasma to a nonlinear Schroedinger equation\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKarney, C. F. F.\n\n1977-01-01\n\nEquations describing the nonlinear propagation of waves in an anisotropic plasma are rarely exactly soluble. However it is often possible to make approximations that reduce the exact equations into a simpler equation. The use of MACSYMA to make such approximations, and so reduce the equation describing lower hybrid waves into the nonlinear Schrodinger equation which is soluble by the inverse scattering method is demonstrated. MACSYMA is used at several stages in the calculation only because there is a natural division between calculations that are easiest done by hand, and those that are easiest done by machine.\n\nThe Complexity of One-Step Equations\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nNgu, Bing\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAn analysis of one-step equations from a cognitive load theory perspective uncovers variation within one-step equations.

O.\n\n1977-01-01\n\nIf a linear ordinary differential equation with polynomial coefficients is converted into integrated form then the formal substitution of a Chebyshev series leads to recurrence equations defining the Chebyshev coefficients of the solution function. An explicit formula is presented for the polynomial coefficients of the integrated form in terms of the polynomial coefficients of the differential form. The symmetries arising from multiplication and integration of Chebyshev polynomials are exploited in deriving a general recurrence equation from which can be derived all of the linear equations defining the Chebyshev coefficients. Procedures for deriving the general recurrence equation are specified in a precise algorithmic notation suitable for translation into any of the languages for symbolic computation. The method is algebraic and it can therefore be applied to differential equations containing indeterminates.\n\nSystematic derivation of reaction-diffusion equations with distributed delays and relations to fractional reaction-diffusion equations and hyperbolic transport equations: application to the theory of Neolithic transition.\n\nPubMed\n\nVlad, Marcel Ovidiu; Ross, John\n\n2002-12-01\n\nWe introduce a general method for the systematic derivation of nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations with distributed delays. We study the interactions among different types of moving individuals (atoms, molecules, quasiparticles, biological organisms, etc). The motion of each species is described by the continuous time random walk theory, analyzed in the literature for transport problems, whereas the interactions among the species are described by a set of transformation rates, which are nonlinear functions of the local concentrations of the different types of individuals. We use the time interval between two jumps (the transition time) as an additional state variable and obtain a set of evolution equations, which are local in time. In order to make a connection with the transport models used in the literature, we make transformations which eliminate the transition time and derive a set of nonlocal equations which are nonlinear generalizations of the so-called generalized master equations. The method leads under different specified conditions to various types of nonlocal transport equations including a nonlinear generalization of fractional diffusion equations, hyperbolic reaction-diffusion equations, and delay-differential reaction-diffusion equations. Thus in the analysis of a given problem we can fit to the data the type of reaction-diffusion equation and the corresponding physical and kinetic parameters. The method is illustrated, as a test case, by the study of the neolithic transition. We introduce a set of assumptions which makes it possible to describe the transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture economics by a differential delay reaction-diffusion equation for the population density. We derive a delay evolution equation for the rate of advance of agriculture, which illustrates an application of our analysis.\n\nPREFACE: Symmetries and integrability of difference equations Symmetries and integrability of difference equations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLevi, Decio; Olver, Peter; Thomova, Zora; Winternitz, Pavel\n\n2009-11-01\n\nThe concept of integrability was introduced in classical mechanics in the 19th century for finite dimensional continuous Hamiltonian systems. It was extended to certain classes of nonlinear differential equations in the second half of the 20th century with the discovery of the inverse scattering transform and the birth of soliton theory. Also at the end of the 19th century Lie group theory was invented as a powerful tool for obtaining exact analytical solutions of large classes of differential equations. Together, Lie group theory and integrability theory in its most general sense provide the main tools for solving nonlinear differential equations. Like differential equations, difference equations play an important role in physics and other sciences. They occur very naturally in the description of phenomena that are genuinely discrete. Indeed, they may actually be more fundamental than differential equations if space-time is actually discrete at very short distances. On the other hand, even when treating continuous phenomena described by differential equations it is very often necessary to resort to numerical methods. This involves a discretization of the differential equation, i.e. a replacement of the differential equation by a difference one. Given the well developed and understood techniques of symmetry and integrability for differential equations a natural question to ask is whether it is possible to develop similar techniques for difference equations. The aim is, on one hand, to obtain powerful methods for solving `integrable' difference equations and to establish practical integrability criteria, telling us when the methods are applicable. On the other hand, Lie group methods can be adapted to solve difference equations analytically. Finally, integrability and symmetry methods can be combined with numerical methods to obtain improved numerical solutions of differential equations. The origin of the SIDE meetings goes back to the early 1990s and the first\n\nOn the transition from the Ginzburg-Landau equation to the extended Fisher-Kolmogorov equation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRottschÃ¤fer, Vivi; Doelman, Arjen\n\n1998-07-01\n\nThe Ginzburg-Landau (GL) equation âgenericallyâ describes the behaviour of small perturbations of a marginally unstable basic state in systems on unbounded domains. In this paper we consider the transition from this generic situation to a degenerate (co-dimension 2) case in which the GL approach is no longer valid. Instead of studying a general underlying model problem, we consider a two-dimensional system of coupled reaction-diffusion equations in one spatial dimension. We show that near the degeneration the behaviour of small perturbations is governed by the extended Fisher-Kolmogorov (eFK) equation (at leading order). The relation between the GL-equation and the eFK-equation is quite subtle, but can be analysed in detail. The main goal of this paper is to study this relation, which we do asymptotically. The asymptotic analysis is compared to numerical simulations of the full reaction-diffusion system. As one approaches the co-dimension 2 point, we observe that the stable stationary periodic patterns predicted by the GL-equation evolve towards various different families of stable, stationary (but not necessarily periodic) so-called âmulti-bumpâ solutions. In the literature, these multi-bump patterns are shown to exist as solutions of the eFK-equation, but there is no proof of the asymptotic stability of these solutions. Our results suggest that these multi-bump patterns can also be asymptotically stable in large classes of model problems.\n\nLocal Observed-Score Kernel Equating\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nWiberg, Marie; van der Linden, Wim J.; von Davier, Alina A.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThree local observed-score kernel equating methods that integrate methods from the local equating and kernel equating frameworks are proposed.

These are derived using a recently developed analytical method similar to renormalization group theory. (Scott E. Parker and Daniele Carati, Phys. Rev. Lett. 75), 441 (1995). In this technique, the phase space structure inherent in Landau damping is treated analytically by building a ``renormalized collisionality'' onto a bare collisionality (which may be taken as vanishingly small). Here we apply this technique to the nonlinear ion gyrokinetic equation in slab geometry, obtaining nonlinear fluid equations for density, parallel momentum and heat. Wave-particle resonances are described by two functions appearing in the heat equation: a renormalized ``collisionality'' and a renormalized nonlinear coupling coeffient. It will be shown that these new equations may correct a deficiency in existing gyrofluid equations, (G. W. Hammett and F. W. Perkins, Phys. Rev. Lett. 64,) 3019 (1990). which can severely underestimate the strength of nonlinear interaction in regimes where linear resonance is strong. (N. Mattor, Phys.

More precisely, we revise the classical Lie algorithm of construction of symmetries of differential equations, describe the group classification algorithm and discuss the process of reduction of (systems of) PDEs to (systems of) equations with smaller number of independent variables in order to construct invariant solutions. The group classification algorithm and reduction process are illustrated by the example of the generalized Zakharov-Kuznetsov (GZK) equations of form ut +(F (u)) xxx +(G (u)) xyy +(H (u)) x = 0. As a result, a complete group classification of the GZK equations is performed and a number of new interesting nonlinear invariant models which have non-trivial invariance algebras are obtained. Lie symmetry reductions and exact solutions for two important invariant models, i.e., the classical and modified Zakharov-Kuznetsov equations, are constructed. The algorithmic framework for group analysis of differential equations presented in this paper can also be applied to other nonlinear PDEs.\n\nA note on improved F-expansion method combined with Riccati equation applied to nonlinear evolution equations.\n\nPubMed\n\nIslam, Md Shafiqul; Khan, Kamruzzaman; Akbar, M Ali; Mastroberardino, Antonio\n\n2014-10-01\n\nThe purpose of this article is to present an analytical method, namely the improved F-expansion method combined with the Riccati equation, for finding exact solutions of nonlinear evolution equations.

However, traditional PML and CFS-PML are based on first-order wave equations; thus, they are not suitable for second-order wave equation. In this paper, an implementation of CFS-PML for second-order wave equation is presented using auxiliary differential equations. This method is free of both convolution calculations and third-order temporal derivatives. As an unsplit CFS-PML, it can reduce the nearly grazing incidence. Numerical experiments show that it has better absorption than typical PML implementations based on second-order wave equation.\n\nTurbulent fluid motion 3: Basic continuum equations\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nDeissler, Robert G.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nA derivation of the continuum equations used for the analysis of turbulence is given.

This suggests that the latter may not be the most general equation. We propose here for the first time, following a rigorous mathematical treatment based on the variational principle, that there exists a generalized 4-index gravitational field equation containing the Riemann curvature tensor linearly, and thus the Weyl tensor as well. We show that this equation, written in n dimensions, contains the energy-momentum tensor for matter and that of the gravitational field itself. This new 4-index equation remains completely within the framework of general relativity and emerges as a natural generalization of the familiar 2-index Einstein equation. Due to the presence of the Weyl tensor, we show that this equation contains much more information, which fully justifies the use of a fourth-order theory.\n\nThe Equations of Oceanic Motions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMÃ¼ller, Peter\n\n2006-10-01\n\nModeling and prediction of oceanographic phenomena and climate is based on the integration of dynamic equations. The Equations of Oceanic Motions derives and systematically classifies the most common dynamic equations used in physical oceanography, from large scale thermohaline circulations to those governing small scale motions and turbulence. After establishing the basic dynamical equations that describe all oceanic motions, M|ller then derives approximate equations, emphasizing the assumptions made and physical processes eliminated. He distinguishes between geometric, thermodynamic and dynamic approximations and between the acoustic, gravity, vortical and temperature-salinity modes of motion. Basic concepts and formulae of equilibrium thermodynamics, vector and tensor calculus, curvilinear coordinate systems, and the kinematics of fluid motion and wave propagation are covered in appendices. Providing the basic theoretical background for graduate students and researchers of physical oceanography and climate science, this book will serve as both a comprehensive text and an essential reference.\n\nExplicit integration of Friedmann's equation with nonlinear equations of state\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nChen, Shouxin; Gibbons, Gary W.; Yang, Yisong, E-mail: chensx@henu.edu.cn, E-mail: gwg1@damtp.cam.ac.uk, E-mail: yisongyang@nyu.edu\n\n2015-05-01\n\nIn this paper we study the integrability of the Friedmann equations, when the equation of state for the perfect-fluid universe is nonlinear, in the light of the Chebyshev theorem. A series of important, yet not previously touched, problems will be worked out which include the generalized Chaplygin gas, two-term energy density, trinomial Friedmann, Born-Infeld, two-fluid models, and Chern-Simons modified gravity theory models. With the explicit integration, we are able to understand exactly the roles of the physical parameters in various models play in the cosmological evolution which may also offer clues to a profound understanding of the problems in generalmoreÂ Â» settings. For example, in the Chaplygin gas universe, a few integrable cases lead us to derive a universal formula for the asymptotic exponential growth rate of the scale factor, of an explicit form, whether the Friedmann equation is integrable or not, which reveals the coupled roles played by various physical sectors and it is seen that, as far as there is a tiny presence of nonlinear matter, conventional linear matter makes contribution to the dark matter, which becomes significant near the phantom divide line. The Friedmann equations also arise in areas of physics not directly related to cosmology. We provide some examples ranging from geometric optics and central orbits to soap films and the shape of glaciated valleys to which our results may be applied.Â«Â less\n\nSolution Methods for Certain Evolution Equations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVega-Guzman, Jose Manuel\n\nSolution methods for certain linear and nonlinear evolution equations are presented in this dissertation. Emphasis is placed mainly on the analytical treatment of nonautonomous differential equations, which are challenging to solve despite the existent numerical and symbolic computational software programs available. Ideas from the transformation theory are adopted allowing one to solve the problems under consideration from a non-traditional perspective. First, the Cauchy initial value problem is considered for a class of nonautonomous and inhomogeneous linear diffusion-type equation on the entire real line. Explicit transformations are used to reduce the equations under study to their corresponding standard forms emphasizing on natural relations with certain Riccati(and/or Ermakov)-type systems. These relations give solvability results for the Cauchy problem of the parabolic equation considered. The superposition principle allows to solve formally this problem from an unconventional point of view. An eigenfunction expansion approach is also considered for this general evolution equation. Examples considered to corroborate the efficacy of the proposed solution methods include the Fokker-Planck equation, the Black-Scholes model and the one-factor Gaussian Hull-White model. The results obtained in the first part are used to solve the Cauchy initial value problem for certain inhomogeneous Burgers-type equation. The connection between linear (the Diffusion-type) and nonlinear (Burgers-type) parabolic equations is stress in order to establish a strong commutative relation. Traveling wave solutions of a nonautonomous Burgers equation are also investigated. Finally, it is constructed explicitly the minimum-uncertainty squeezed states for quantum harmonic oscillators. They are derived by the action of corresponding maximal kinematical invariance group on the standard ground state solution. It is shown that the product of the variances attains the required minimum value\n\nSparse dynamics for partial differential equations\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSchaeffer, Hayden; Caflisch, Russel; Hauck, Cory D.; Osher, Stanley\n\n2013-01-01\n\nWe investigate the approximate dynamics of several differential equations when the solutions are restricted to a sparse subset of a given basis.
