        "text": "BIO\n\nI was born and raised in New York City where my Argentinian parents both worked; my father owned a travel agency in New York City and my mother was a research biochemist at Mount Sinai Hospital. They both loved to travel. So, from an early age, I did too. They even took me along for really long trips, like the one from Alaska to Patagonia by car! In the '70's we moved to Barcelona, and then to Paris, where I studied at the Ecole Active Bilingue, and polished the French that I had been learning since I was little (thank my French ancestors).\n\nI have lived most of my life in Barcelona where I studied journalism and where I learned to appreciate great ARCHITECTURE. Later in the '80's I moved back to New York City and started working as an assistant to many great photographers. Little by little, I made my way into the editorial world as a freelance photographer receiving assignments from many fabulous photo editors shooting mainly PORTRAIT work but also travel and INTERIORS.\n\nIn the '90's I moved back to Barcelona where I continue having my base and archive, and from where I have worked with the most important and prestigious publications in the world. However this does not stop me from traveling frequently to New York City, shooting amazing HOTELS & SPAS and travelling for shoots to the rest of Europe, United States, Africa and the Middle East.\n\nIn the more recent past and after finishing my tenure as President of the AFPE (Associación de Fotografos Profesionales de España) my interests have veered toward producing MULTI-MEDIA projects on local or hyper local issues about sustainable forest management, women empowerment and drought to bridge the gap between urban and rural societies, since becoming a forest landowner and managing a cork forest."
