This variant of the Way of Saint James is 46 miles from A Coruña to Santiago and can be carried out in three stages. Travelers can start their pilgrimage on foot from A Coruña’s port, led by the light of the Roman lighthouse known as the Tower of Hercules. After reaching Cambre, the route crosses Abegondo and continues until Hospital de Bruma, where it connects with an alternative English Way that starts in Ferrol. From here we reach Ordes, and then Sigüeiro, the last town before reaching Santiago.\n\nWhere to Stay\n\nNH Hotel A Coruña Centro\n\nRúa Juan Flórez, 16, 15004 A Coruña\n\nFrom the venue: Take bus 3A from Rúa Juan Flórez, 16 to Avda.
