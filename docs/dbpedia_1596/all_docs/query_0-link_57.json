        "text": "I'm one of those people who really loves a good walk. I spent most of my adult life in Manhattan, where I walked everywhere. Now, as a travel writer, I find that walking around is really the best way to get to know the ins and outs of a new place. So when I was asked to take on an assignment where I had to walk before every meal for a month, I immediately agreed, feeling a bit smug about how easy it was going to be.\n\nBefore I started the experiment, though, I wanted to see if there was anything else in this for me besides a paycheck. According to research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, walking just 30 minutes a day can significantly decrease the risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, and depression—even when it's broken down into shorter intervals. And University of Tennessee research found that the more steps you take, the more likely you are to be at a healthy weight. (Got 10 minutes? Then you've got time to lose the weight for good with Prevention's new 10-minute workouts and 10-minute meals.

I've found that holds true with my clients, too. Some overeat after moving around, while others become less hungry and may lose weight. It really depends on the person.\"\n\nChallenge accepted. Here's how my month of pre-meal walking went.\n\nWhile I rarely missed a walk, the number on my scale didn't change. But that didn't really surprise me. I had started a healthy regimen a year earlier, giving up booze, limiting my refined carbs, and working out regularly, so I felt like I was in a pretty good place, health- and weight-wise. Also, since I knew I'd be taking three daily walks, I wound up taking fewer steps throughout the day—like walking less and taking the subway more when I was in Manhattan—which couldn't have helped with the weight loss. (If losing weight is one of your walking goals, take a look at how to start on your walking journey if you have 50+ pounds to lose.)\n\nBut to be honest, I didn't say yes to this assignment to lose weight. I saw it as a way to get more fresh air and get the kids into walking—and I succeeded on both counts. It also made me determined to make it a habit to start walking more with my boys; I want to instill in them a love for walking, just like mine. I'm happy to say that we're still walking at night when we can, though I've got to admit that it's often after dinner."
