        "text": "Mediums: oil, canvas.\n\nLocation: private collection.\n\nOne of the most famous paintings of Planells of the first surreal period is full of aggressive symbolism. The face of the sea, wounded by a real knife, is bleeding with real red blood; the even pink desert, into which half of the scissors stuck, is also covered with blood. The slightly smiling pouty lips contrast with the bewilderment in the eyes of the phantom, which has partially turned into a brick wall. The character’s hairstyle holding a face without a neck consists of marble fragments of antique statues, the outlines of which repeat and take white clouds outside the canvas."
