        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nOrganic bulk heterojunction solar cells have attracted significant attention due to their potential to fabricate flexible and cost efficient solar cells [1]. Recent works reported that the efficiency has gone beyond the 10% mark with non-fullerene acceptors and high hole mobility polymers with multiple layers of donor acceptor composites [2,3,4]. The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blend structure resolves the limitations of polymers, such as low diffusion lengths and low mobility, by providing interpenetrating donor–acceptor networks [5,6,7]. The most general structures used in high efficiency BHJ solar cells are transparent conducting oxide (TCO), electron-blocking layer (EBL), donor–acceptor blend/hole-blocking layer (HBL), and metal electrodes. Indium tin oxide (ITO) and fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) are the most commonly used TCOs and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is well known as a hole- blocking layer (HBL) in these types of cells. Anyhow, the poor stability of PEDOT: PSS in an ambient atmosphere makes the conventional cell structure with PEDOT:PSS as HBL unstable [8].\n\nThe inverted structure consisting of TCO, HBL, acceptor-donor blend, EBL, or low work function metal electrodes (for hole collection), creates relatively stable BHJ solar cells [9]. Efficient charge collection at the electrodes of inverted bulk heterojunction solar cells is crucial for ensuring high efficiency [10]. Many inorganic materials—especially metal oxides such as TiO2 [11,12], SnO2 and ZnO [13,14]—were successfully used as the HBL in inverted BHJ solar cells due to the high electron mobility and optical transparency of these semiconductor materials.\n\nCdS is an n-type semiconducting material with a direct bandgap of 1.42 eV, which is widely studied as a window material in CdTe and CuInGaSe thin film solar cells [15]. Relatively higher electron mobility makes CdS a suitable material for HBL in bulk heterojunction solar cells [16,17,18,19]. CdS thin films can be fabricated on the nanoscale using several methods including SILAR [20], atomic layer deposition [16], chemical vapor deposition [21], close space sublimation [22], and chemical bath deposition (CBD) [15,23]. Of all these, CBD is a simple and efficient method to fabricate CdS thin film using the solution process method at low temperatures. Despite higher electron mobility, CdS has strong UV absorption with an absorption edge of 520 nm. Hence, the CdS film thickness is crucial in determining the photovoltaic performance of the factor of CdS/PCBM:P3HT solar cells.\n\nIn this work, we focused on a simple chemical bath deposition method for fabricating the CdS thin film with different film thicknesses, and study the effect of the film thickness on the photovoltaic performance of bulk heterojunction fullerene/polymer blend solar cells. We chose P3HT and PCBM as the donor–acceptor pair as they are available commercially.\n\n3. Results and Discussion\n\nThe thickness variation of chemical bath-deposited CdS films with the deposition time is given in a. The thicknesses were measured at five different points and the error bars represents the standard deviation values. A linear increase in average thickness was observed within the range of deposition time. This showed the uniform growth of CdS films within the deposition time of 47 min. The average thicknesses were measured as 32.3 ± 8 nm (~30 nm), 52.3 ± 5 nm (~50 nm), 72.67 ± 10 nm (~70 nm) and 86.0 ± 14.5 nm (~85 nm) for the deposition times of 17, 27, 37 and 47 min, respectively. This confirmed that the CdS layer thicknesses can be controlled at the nanometer scale by controlling the deposition time, as reported in [28]. The UV-Vis spectra of the fabricated CdS thin films are shown in b. The fabricated films showed a strong absorption in the UV region with a sharp absorption edge at 520 nm, which represents the direct bandgap (2.42 eV) of the CdS. This is in good agreement with other works [28,29,30]. The sharp absorption edge also ensures the presence of highly crystalline CdS in the thin film. Moreover, the film was transparent in the visible region regardless of the deposition time, which is an essential criterium for a window material in solar cell applications. As expected, absorption by CdS thin films in the UV region increased with the increasing deposition time, which is consistent with the literature [15,28,31,32].\n\nThe J-V characteristics of the solar cells fabricated with different CdS film thicknesses under simulated illumination of 100 mW/cm2 (one sun) are shown in . The average figures of merits of four identical solar cells with different CdS deposition times (layer thicknesses) are summarized in . As seen in , the average VOC of the solar cells increased from 0.39 to 0.57 when the CdS film thickness increased from ~30 to ~50 nm. The average VOC remained unchanged with the further increment in deposition time. The lower VOC of solar cells with ~30 nm CdS film can be attributed to the shunting of the active layer with the ITO due to the presence of pin holes in the thin CdS film with high rms roughness when compared to the film thickness [15]. The unchanged VOC at higher CdS film thicknesses (~50 nm to ~85 nm) ensures that the CdS film is pin hole free at higher deposition times [15]. The variation of JSC and fill factor showed similar trends with the increasing CdS deposition time. Both increased up to ~70 nm and a slight reduction was observed in devices with ~85 nm CdS film. The increment in JSC and fill factor can be explained by the effective isolation provided by the thick CdS film. At optimum thickness, the electron extraction and transport to the ITO layer is at its best and yields a better JSC and fill factor. The slight drop in the JSC and fill factor of devices with an ~85 nm CdS film can be explained by the strong UV absorption with an increased CdS layer thickness. Overall, the power conversion efficiency replicates the trend in the JSC and fill factor, and increased with the CdS film thickness up to ~70 nm and decreased with thicker CdS layers. The optimum PCE of 2.8% was obtained from the devices with a ~70 nm thick CdS film, which is in the similar range reported for BHJ solar cells with CdS films fabricated by employing different physical vapor deposition methods (see ).\n\nTable 1\n\nCdS Thin Film Fabrication MethodOptimum CdS Layer ThicknessOptimum Device PerformanceRef.JSC *VOC #FFPCE (%)Thermal decomposition of cadmium xanthate precursor10 nm8.280.600.633.22[19]Spraying equimolar solutions of CdCl2 and CS(NH2)2330 nm1.910.5020.300.29[17]Chemical bath deposition21.3 nm5.330.620.431.42[18]Atomic layer deposition17.5 nm8.940.610.613.33[16]Chemical bath deposition~70 nm9.040.590.482.81This work\n\nAs summarized in , we emphasize that the JSC and VOC of our champion device are the highest among all the reported works on CdS/PCBM:P3HT blend-based devices that we are aware of. However, the PCE of our device was not the highest because of the low fill factor. The low fill factor can be correlated to the roughness of the CdS film. The surface roughness of the chemical bath-deposited CdS films was higher when compared to other deposition methods.It has also been reported that the roughness of the CdS film fabricated by CBD decreases with increasing deposition time [15,33,34,35]. Achieving the highest JSC with our device compared to the devices in the table reiterates that optimizing HBL thickness is essential. It is worth noting that the maximum VOC of all the reported works was in the range of 0.60 to 0.62 V. This confirms that the VOC is determined by the energy difference between the HOMO of the polymer donor (P3HT) and the LUMO level of the acceptor (PC61BM).\n\nFinally, we compared the performance of the PCBM/P3HT blend with an optimized CdS layer with a similar device that had a TiO2 thin film of the same thickness fabricated by spray pyrolysis as the hole-blocking layer. shows the J-V curves of the devices with TiO2 and CdS as hole-blocking layers. The TiO2 devices showed a higher JSC of 11.1 mA cm−1 against the 9.04 mA cm−1 of the CdS device. The higher JSC of the TiO2 devices can be attributed to the lower filtering effect of TiO2 due to its higher bandgap. However, the CdS device showed a higher average VOC of 0.59 V against 0.33 V of TiO2 devices. Our CdS device had a higher PCE (2.81%) when compared to the devices with TiO2 as the hole-blocking layer (2.0%). The improved VOC of the CdS devices can be explained by the appropriate band diagrams of the solar cells [25,36]. As reported earlier, the VOC of polymer-based solar cells are limited by the difference between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor [37,38]. a,b compares the electronic energy levels of the solar cells with TiO2 and CdS hole-blocking layers, respectively. The values mentioned in the figure are below the ground level. The higher conduction band edge of the CdS layer in comparison with the conduction band edge of TiO2 explains the higher VOC found in CdS/PCBM:P3HT solar cells [31]."
