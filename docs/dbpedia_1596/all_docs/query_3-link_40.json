        "text": "You may pump iron in the gym, but the kind you get through food is even more important for your health. The mineral transports oxygen throughout your body, helps form red blood cells, and supports your metabolism. “Too little iron in your diet and you may be feeling cold, tired, and sluggish,” says Melissa Prest, D.C.N., R.D.N., a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.\n\nIdeally, women should aim for 18 milligrams (mg) per day, while men only need 8 mg, says Prest. The best way to get enough is through diet—and yes, it’s true that red meat is an excellent source. Just one 3-ounce serving of lean ground beef packs 2.2 mg of it, per the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).\n\nBut what if you want to steer clear of steak? While research shows that red meat provides important nutrients (including iron, muscle-building amino acids, vitamin B12, and zinc), it might also increase your risk of several chronic diseases, including heart disease and even certain types of cancer. Meanwhile, studies show that plant-based diets may do the opposite and lower your risk of health problems down the road.\n\nLuckily, you can find iron beyond a Quarter Pounder with cheese—but you’ll need to eat more of the mineral if you’re completely vegan or vegetarian. That’s because there are two types of iron: heme and nonheme. Meat, seafood, and poultry contain both forms, while plant-based or fortified foods contain only nonheme. This can be an issue if you’re strictly plant-based, since your body has an easier time absorbing the iron in animal products, according to the National Institutes of Health. (Quick tip: Pairing plant-based sources of iron with vitamin C-rich foods can boost absorption.)\n\nThe fix: “Vegetarians and vegans should consume around 1.8 times the recommended daily value,” says Sharon Palmer, R.D.N., author of . For women ages 19 to 50, that works out to about 32 mg of iron per day. The 25 delicious foods on this list, which pack more iron than a serving of beef, can help you hit your daily mark."
