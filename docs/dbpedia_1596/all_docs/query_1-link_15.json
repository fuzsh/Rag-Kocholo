        "text": "Oronzo Vito Gasparo (1903–1969), was an American artist often known\n\nfor surreal townscape painting, design, and crafts.\n\nOronzo Vito Gasparo was born in Rutigliano, Bari, Italy in 1903, one of seventeen children. His parents were Italian and Hindu. He spent many active years in California, and died in New York City in 1969.\n\nGasparo studied at the National Academy of Design in New York; he was mentored by Preston Dickinson and was Dickinson's favorite pupil.\n\nOronzo Vito Gasparo worked under the Works Progress Administration Easel Project during the Great Depression.\n\nA number of Gasparo's works were acquired by Onya La Tour, who was an avid collector and enthusiast of modern art in New York in the 1930's, and who directed the Federal Art Gallery of the Federal Arts Project of the Work Projects Administration, 225 W 57th St, New York NY.\n\nDuring his lifetime he had over 40 one-man shows ranging from 1928 to a retrospective in 1974.\n\nThis is a part of the Wikipedia article used under the Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike 3.0 Unported License (CC-BY-SA).
