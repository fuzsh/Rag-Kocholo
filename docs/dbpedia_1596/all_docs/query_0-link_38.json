        "text": "Mediums: oil, canvas.\n\nLocation: private collection.\n\nWe can view this picture basing on the main motto of Surrealism – not to paint what we can take pictures of. In the painting, real are mountains on the horizon and a high cloudy sky. The landscape is typical of the artist’s paintings – a yellow desert and a very old thick dried tree similar to a high knotty stump. A multicoloured chessboard is geometrically drawn, but separated into pieces; the playing characters are similar to aliens. At the same time, the player in blue has three hands, one of which, seeming to be going through the empty head-pan of the player in green, becomes his tie. The third hand comes from the head (or rather, from a deformed skull), but has a very graceful shape."
