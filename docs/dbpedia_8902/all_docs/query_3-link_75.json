        "text": "I try to remember a movie I saw long time ago on TV. It must be at the beginning of the 90s, possibly the end of the 80s. The movie might be older though. It was something about a scientist researching and experimenting with ants. I think the ants got intelligent, but I'm not sure about this. If I recall it right, in the end the ants took over the world, or only the lab. Sorry, that's all a little bit cloudy. My memory is not the best about this, that's why I need your help to get the name of the movie.\n\nYou may already have your answer, but your description reminded me of the scene in The Simpsons episode Deep Space Homer when Homer accidentally smashes the ant farm on board the rocket and causes panic back on Earth.\n\nSo I checked The Simpsons Archive, which notes two films in its references section: Empire of the Ants and Hellstrom Chronicles. Perhaps one of those is the film you're trying to remember.\n\nanswered Dec 8, 2011 at 22:49\n\nDisgruntledGoatDisgruntledGoat\n\n3,62722 gold badges2727 silver badges3535 bronze badges"
