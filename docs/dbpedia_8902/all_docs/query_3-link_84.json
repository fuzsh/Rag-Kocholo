        "text": "Giant bug movies…gotta love ‘em. From “Them” to “Tarantula” to “Mothra,” there’s just something wonderful about huge insects. Even when the movie is horrible, it’s hard not to enjoy a giant bug movie. Director Bert I Gordon definitely had a thing for the genre, having directed “Beginning of the End” and “Earth Vs. The Spider” in addition to today’s film, “Empire of the Ants.” It definitely falls into that horrible category, but it is fun.\n\nIn this late 70’s offering from AIP, Joan Collins plays a Florida land developer trying to wine and dine a bunch of prospective buyers. The group takes a boat out to the property to have a look, but little do they know some guys in hazmat suits have been dumping barrels of toxic waste in the water. One has washed up on shore and attracted a bunch of ants. The result: giant ants! Soon, the real estate buyers are ending up ant chow. As their numbers dwindle, the survivors try to make their way to the nearest town, several miles away. Eventually they end up in a town where the ants have taken over the nearby sugar factory and are gassing the town folk into zombie-like submission.\n\nThere is a lot of screaming, a lot of running, and a lot of flailing at large ant-shaped puppets. But it takes a while for this supposed “action” to start. A lot of time is spent at the beginning of the film building up backstorys for the various characters. Many 70’s disaster movies did this sort of thing. You have the young lady who wants a fresh start, the married couple who’s relations hip is on the rocks, the kindly old couple, etc. None of it matters since many of them end up ant num nums anyway.\n\nThe specials effects are indescribably bad. Some of the giant ants are courtesy of rear projection, while other scenes were done with ants crawling on miniature sets or photographs. Any time an ant puppet is employed, the camera bounces around more than on an episode of “Cops.” I guess they figured that if the audience couldn’t focus on the ants for too long then they couldn’t spot how fake they looked. Didn’t work, by the way. Keep in mind, these effects were brought to us the same year that “Star Wars” changed movie making forever.\n\nWhile we’re on the subject of effects, let’s talk about the sound effects. I don’t know what kind of sounds ants make, if any, but I’d be surprised if they sounded like women screaming. But that’s how Bert I. Gordon imagines they sound. He also imagines that they attack humans while accompanied by a “Jaws” sound-alike score.\n\nFor the most part, the plot goes no deeper than this…people try not to get eaten by giant ants. They all walk through the forest for awhile…get surprised by the ants…someone gets eaten…rinse and repeat. The one element of the story which has some great potential comes in to the story too late to make a difference. Just about 15 minutes before the end of the movie, we are told that the ants are intelligent and are setting out to enslave the human race. The filmmakers could have created a much more interesting story had they cut down on all the screaming and introduced the idea of slave master insects earlier.\n\nBut ultimately, story doesn’t matter here. After all, awful story + awful acting + awful effects = a so bad it’s good movie experience."
