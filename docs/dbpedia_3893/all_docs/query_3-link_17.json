        "text": "Hi @HarryESHall,\n\nThank you for posting in the Community! We've moved your post to a relevant Help Board where it fits better.\n\nI can see where you're coming from and how this could be a bit annoying when having really long titles of certain songs/shows. However, at the moment this is an expected situation, as every device has different screen size and display resolution, hence the visual experience across platforms differs as it depends on the aforementioned factors.\n\nOur app tries to provide you with the full title (as it's creator intended), but as I said the limitations come from the displaying capabilities of the particular device. For example on my mobile device's screen (which is 6.21 inches) I see even less characters than you for the same titles you sent in the screenshot. On desktop however, you can see the full titles if your app is launched in full screen mode. So to sum this up, at the moment you can observe the full name of an entry on a device that has the necessary screen size and resolution. For all other cases you can look at the now playing bar, where longer titles roll back in a ticker display fashion and so you can read them in full from there.\n\nHope this clears things up. If you have any questions or need anything else, the Community is here for you.\n\nKiril Moderator\n\nHelp others find this answer and click \"Accept as Solution\".\n\nIf you appreciate an answer, maybe give it a Like.\n\nAre you new to the Community? Take a moment to introduce yourself!\n\nFor me this makes many albums unuseable for anyone looking for specific tracks, I appreciate the comment about screen real-estate, but there are lots of well-understood UI approaches to circumvent this, would be great to be able to see the full title at least via a link to launch a text-wrapped popup for example. The player bar where 'longer titles roll back in a ticker display fashion and so you can read them in full from there' is also painful waiting for the title to scroll, for the track I'm just listening took 40 seconds to get to the full title, so if you're using this approach to flick through all the tracks looking for a specific track it takes forever. Would at least be good to have a text wrapped option on this screen if not elsewhere. Thank you for listening"
