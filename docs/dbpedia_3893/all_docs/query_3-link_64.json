        "text": "Names\n\nFor general instructions on the “Original language,” “Primary name,” “Non-English,” “Romanized,” “English,” and “Aliases” fields, refer to the Entry names and aliases page.\n\nNew non-English translations of song entry names should not be added without a good reason.\n\nFor example, the song entry ECHO should not receive new entry name translations. (No translations of the word “ECHO” should be added to the name/alias fields.)\n\nSome examples of good reasons for adding a non-English translation:\n\nTranslation is used elsewhere (alias).\n\n= Improved searchability\n\nTranslation is related to the original name.\n\n”Матрёшка” for Matryoshka\n\n= Additional context/value. For example, “マトリョシカ” is from the Russian “Матрёшка”, but is also known by its Romanized form “Matryoshka”. Therefore, this provides the useful information of 1. the loanword being used and 2. a Romanization of the loanword.\n\nSong entry-specific name instructions\n\nIf the song has no name, use the untitled tag with an empty placeholder name.\n\nFor covers and other derived works, copying the aliases from the original entry is not necessary.\n\nRemixer names should remain in the song title. For video title trimming:\n\nRemove clear non-title parts (e.g., original artist credit).\n\nRemove the vocalist’s name if it is separate from the rest of the title.\n\nRemove the song type if it is separate from the rest of the title.\n\nSong Type\n\nIf multiple song types apply, add them as tags: https://vocadb.net/T/7374/song-types\n\nSong type priorities:\n\nRemix/Remaster > Music PV > Cover\n\nGuidelines for classification:\n\nIf vocals are different but the instrumental is similar, it’s likely a cover.\n\nIf the song structure or genre is different, it’s likely a remix.\n\nIf both the instrumental and vocals are changed, prefer classifying as a remix.\n\nOriginal song\n\nhttps://vocadb.net/T/6479/original-song\n\nOriginal songs (“オリジナル曲” in Japanese) are songs that have completely original content and aren’t based on other songs. The original song is the version of the song that was published first. Later versions are considered derivatives regardless of who made them.\n\nSometimes the producer might publish multiple different versions of a song, usually with different vocals or different lengths, calling all of them originals. On VocaDB these self-covers and self-remixes are classified as covers and remixes, not “original songs”.\n\nSometimes the artist might release multiple versions of the song simultaneously. If both are in-scope, it doesn’t generally matter which is picked for the “original version”.\n\nFor (original) instrumental album songs, use the original song type with the instrumental-tag. The instrumental song type is for instrumental versions of original songs.\n\nRemaster\n\nhttps://vocadb.net/T/1519/remaster\n\nA remaster or remake (“修正版” or “リマスター版” in Japanese) is an improved version of a song. If the original is replaced by the remaster, it’s unnecessary to create a separate entry for the original. The remaster can use the “original song” type.\n\nIf a remastered version is made for an album and is not playable online, using the original song entry is acceptable.\n\nA remaster should differ from the original only in terms of mastering, though this term is interpreted loosely in the Vocaloid world. If the new version is significantly different, the remaster song type should not be used.\n\nRemix\n\nhttps://vocadb.net/T/371/remix\n\nA remix is a variant of an original recording, often in a different genre. This type is used even for self-remixes, adding the self-remix tag.\n\nRemixes may or may not involve recording new music, often using samples from the original.\n\nExtended or shortened versions should be classified as remixes.\n\nLive versions should be classified as remixes with the live recording tag. Use the original song entry for setlists.\n\nCover\n\nA Cover (カバー曲) is a re-recorded version of a song, usually by a different artist. In the Vocaloid/UTAU world, covers often use a different voicebank while keeping the instrumentals intact.\n\nOutside of the Vocaloid world, a cover implies re-recording of the song, but in the context of Vocaloid, the “cover” term is used when adding Vocaloid vocals to an existing instrumental recording.\n\nUse the cover type if the song is re-released with new lyrics, adding the changed lyrics tag.\n\nIf the original artist re-releases the song with new vocals, use the cover type with the self-cover tag.\n\nVoice synth songs that include both a voice synth version and a human-sung version (both official) should be tagged with simultaneous upload if the publish dates are less than a week apart.\n\nMark entries with simultaneous upload as “original songs” unless specified otherwise by the artist.\n\nSpecify the human-sung version in the song description or external links with its publish date.\n\nIf the human-sung version is published more than a week before the voice synth version, mark the song as “cover” with the self-cover tag.\n\nIf the human-sung version is published more than a week after the voice synth version, mention it as usual, but do not add tags.\n\nThese rules do not apply if both songs have entries on VocaDB.\n\nInstrumental\n\nhttps://vocadb.net/T/208/instrumental\n\nAKA off-vocal or karaoke.\n\nThe “Instrumental” song type is used for instrumental versions of songs, where a non-instrumental version with vocals is the original.\n\nInstrumental versions of songs are accepted only as part of album entries. They should be the same as the original version, excluding vocals. If otherwise different, use the remix or cover types with the instrumental tag.\n\nExclude vocalist credits for off-vocal/karaoke songs that have background/harmony vocals, as these are already credited in the original entry.\n\nMashup\n\nhttps://vocadb.net/T/3392/mashup\n\nMashups are songs made by blending two or more songs together.\n\nSimple mashups where two songs are simply mixed together are discouraged on VocaDB, unless they’re well-known or present on an album.\n\nSongs that mix multiple covers of the same song together (joining multiple vocal tracks) should be labeled as covers.\n\nCurrently, it’s not possible to specify multiple songs as originals in the “original song” field. They should be mentioned in the song description instead.\n\nMedley\n\nhttps://vocadb.net/T/3093\n\nA medley is a special case of mashup where songs are played one after another, possibly with overlap. Use the mashup type for medleys, unless the medley is an original song. Add the medley tag.\n\nFocus on quality when adding medleys. Only add those that are remarkable in some way.\n\nMusic PV\n\nhttps://vocadb.net/T/7378/music-pv\n\nThe music PV type is used for PVs of original songs or remixes. Create a separate entry for the PV to credit the animator and others involved. MMD models can be tagged. The PV might be more well-known than the original song, e.g., Sweet Devil PV by wakamura and Love is War by kkkk.\n\nRemember to also credit the vocalists for Music PVs. Silent characters (that have no vocals in the PV) do not need to be mentioned. Model tags (such as CHAN x CO Miku) can be used if applicable regardless whether the character has vocals or not.\n\nMusic PVs should always be derived versions. If the song was originally published with the PV, then include the PV in the original song entry rather than making a separate page.\n\nOnly the official PV should be added to the original song entry. Major derivative PVs by unrelated artists should have their own entries. Additional official PVs with major differences should also have separate entries.\n\nIf the song was published without a PV and an official PV is released later, add the PV to the original song entry. Minor differences like model changes can be included in the original entry with the “other” type.\n\nRules for Music PVs:\n\nPVs with voice synth characters are generally allowed.\n\nPVs with out-of-scope characters/fandoms are only allowed if they hit at least 100k views on a platform.\n\nDrama PV\n\nhttps://vocadb.net/T/104/drama-pv\n\nDrama PVs focus on story instead of music, often made with MMD software. They should feature a Vocaloid character or be strongly related to Vocaloid/UTAU to be accepted on VocaDB.\n\nDrama PVs should be self-made/self-directed stories.\n\nCopying memes, TV shows or movie scenes are usually not considered drama PVs.\n\nOther\n\nhttps://vocadb.net/T/10159/other-song-type\n\nFor entries that do not belong to any categories above. For example, Commentary.\n\nOriginal Version\n\nIf the original version of the song exists on the site, use this field to link the derived version to the original.\n\nIf the original song entry only exists on UtaiteDB, you can connect it to the VocaDB entry by adding the UtaiteDB entry as an external link. This will display as the “Original version” along with automatic metadata.\n\nIf the original song is out-of-scope, use the tag original-out-of-scope along with a link to the original song or a reference in the song description.\n\nFor out-of-scope songs, the original artists can be credited in the song description (example). Direct artist credits through the artist tab should not be used, regardless if the original artists have artist entries or not.\n\nIf the out-of-scope original song has 5 or more derived (remix or cover) song entries on VocaDB, it can be created as a cover unifier entry. The original (out-of-scope) artists should be credited as “custom artists” on the cover unifier entry. If the entry has no related (in-scope) artist entries, it can be created with the temporary artist entry.\n\nOriginal song can be selected by:\n\nA) searching by the song title\n\nB) by the VocaDB URL\n\nC) with “id:{song id}“.\n\nThe “Find originals” button attempts to find original songs based on the song title. The exact logic is available on GitHub.\n\n(A > B > C)\n\nNote: If a song C is derived from song B, which in turn is derived from song A, you can link C to A directly if B has no song entry (B is out of scope). The skipped version B should be mentioned in entry C. The relevant tag out-of-scope arrangement should also be added."
