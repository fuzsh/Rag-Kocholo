        "text": "I’m often asked if it’s a good idea to record and mix multiple or alternate versions of a song. The short answer is YES! Because…\n\nThere are versions of your song that you’ll need to have.\n\nThere are optional versions that can be useful to have.\n\nThere are versions that you make just because you’re dying to hear what they sound like.\n\nFor the long answer, let’s take a look at a variety of alternate versions and how they can help you in a whole lot of important ways.\n\nMUST-HAVE VERSIONS\n\nTHE MAIN VERSION\n\nIf you’re an artist, the main version of your song is the one you’ll release as your single. It’s the definitive version, the one you’ll promote first, and the one you want people to hear.\n\nIf you’re pitching to the Film and TV market, your main version is likely to be the one you’ll pitch. However, if it includes sound effects like ocean waves, rain on the roof, audience applause, or children laughing, you’ll need a main version mix without those for Film & TV uses.\n\nFind out more about writing songs for film and TV.\n\nTHE INSTRUMENTAL MIX\n\nMusic libraries and music supervisors will insist on having an instrumental mix of your main version. They might use this alternate version under dialogue then cut to the full vocal version or use it to add musical consistency across scenes.\n\nYou’ll also want to have an instrumental version in case you decide to rewrite your lyric. You’ll only need to re-record the vocal, not the whole arrangement.\n\nAn instrumental version does not include any background vocals. The exception might be a choir sample that’s used like an instrument.\n\nVERY USEFUL VERSIONS\n\nTHE “TV MIX”\n\nThere are a few uses for a full mix with background vocals but no lead. These are called TV mixes because they’re used when a singer makes an appearance on TV, singing live to a recorded track. A talk show that doesn’t have a live band on hand but likes to book musical guests would want to have your TV mix.\n\nBackground vocals that are done in a loose, energetic, party style (called gang vocals ) can be a big plus. An edited TV mix of Edward Sharpe’s “Janglin’” was featured in a national commercial for Ford Fiesta. (The sound effects were added by the commercial. They’re not on the track.)\n\nTHE “REDUCED” VERSION\n\nSome music libraries will come right out and ask for a simpler, stripped-down mix with fewer instruments. You’ll need to choose what to leave in and what to take out.\n\nThe goal is to create an alternate version that can work for softer scenes with dialogue or create a more intimate feel. Try muting the snare drum and any other instruments that cut through your track and might catch the listener’s attention. Or aim for a more barebones sound by muting big synthesizer pads and string sections.\n\nCheck out current hit “You” by Vance Joy, benny blanco, and Marshmello. The full production is an example of a first-rate singer-songwriter working with two of today’s most creative Pop producers. The song can handle a big post-chorus and dance production with a horn section and four-on-the-floor dance beat, but it works just as well in a stripped-down singer-songwriter version. In that version, notice how they “reduce” the horn section to a single horn and eliminate the drums. Very clever.\n\nINSTRUMENTAL MIX WITH LEAD INSTRUMENT\n\nAn instrumental mix of a song that’s made by simply muting the vocals is likely to have an empty sonic hole where the lead vocal was. While you must have that basic instrumental version, a music library might welcome an additional mix with an instrument playing the melody line.\n\nChoose an instrument that fits into your genre and overall sound. If your track is acoustic folk, then choose a lead instrument like acoustic guitar, fiddle, harmonica, or mandolin. You could use a solo electric guitar in a Rock track. If you’ve got a synth-driven Electro Pop track, find a synth sound that works with the others and lay it in.\n\nThe instrumental melody does not need to copy the vocal melody note for note. It’s usually a good idea to smooth out the melody line a little. It’s okay to improvise on your second verse but don’t stray too far from the first verse melody. You don’t want to draw attention, just fill the gap.\n\nA CLEAN VERSION\n\nIf your main version has explicit language, you might consider making a separate mix and cleaning up the language. While radio will play songs with explicit language and some cable TV shows can use them, most mainstream television will not. When you record the vocal for your song, do it both ways: explicit and clean to make sure you’ve got your bases covered..\n\nVERSIONS THAT ARE GOOD TO HAVE\n\nCOVER YOUR OWN SONG\n\nFans demand a lot from their favorite artists. One of the ways artists can satisfy that demand is to release multiple versions of their songs. Think of it as doing “cover versions” of your own song.\n\nThis will be a new recording of your song, not just a different mix of the original recording. Try a different approach to your arrangement. If you featured acoustic guitar on the original recording, think about using a wash of synth pads in the background with an electric piano on your cover version. Speed up or slow down the tempo. Try changing the groove. Just be sure your new approach supports a viable interpretation of your song, otherwise it could sound awkward.\n\nTo hear a great example of a self-cover, check out the Foo Fighters hit Everlong on YouTube. Then listen to Everlong – Acoustic Versionto hear David Grohl covering his own Rock song in a Singer-Songwriter style. They’re both great!\n\nREMIXES\n\nRemixes have been a staple of multi-version releases for several years now. Just take a look at Selena Gomez’s Spotify page. Scroll down to single releases and you’ll see eight remixes of “Wolves,” each one released as a single.\n\nHaving a good remixer take a whack at your song can be expensive. But if you’ve got a strong, contemporary song—maybe a mid-tempo ballad with a current feel and a good vocal—you could look for a remixer on SoundBetter.com, someone whose fee is reasonable.\n\nSPECIAL ACCESS FOR YOUR FANS\n\nYour fans love to feel like they’re being given a glimpse inside your personal songwriting journey. Keep the demos you make while writing your song. Release one or two as alternate versions after the main version is released to show your fans how the song evolved.\n\nDUET VERSIONS\n\nLately it seems as if everyone is singing with or featuring someone else in their songs: Justin Bieber and Shawn Mendes, Charlie Puth and Selena Gomez, Julia Michaels and everybody.\n\nOn the plus side, if you’re an artist a duet can help you expand your fanbase. You’ll reach fans of your singing partner as well as your own. However, if you’re thinking of pitching to film and television, a duet might limit the uses. If you’re writing to a brief, be sure the listing specifically requests a duet.\n\nOn the minus side, if your lyric doesn’t lend itself to a duet treatment, it’s probably not a good idea to force it. You could end up with something that’s a real mess. Also, if you’re featuring both a male and female singer, you may need to re-record your entire track to get it into a key that’s comfortable for both. Ask yourself if the time and expense is worth it.\n\nSTEMS\n\nIf you’re writing and pitching instrumental cues, stems will be required, but they’re not required when pitching songs. You don’t need to run off 35 different stems from your song. However, there are some occasions when you might find them useful. But first, what is a stem?\n\nA stem is a submix that consists of a group of similar sounds that are part of your main mix. A stem might consist of the percussion instruments in your arrangement. It’s created by muting all the other instruments, leaving just a stereo mix of the percussion with all of its effects (EQ, reverb, delay, panning, etc.). Or you might create a stem by grouping acoustic stringed instuments or keyboards, or create a stem consisting of instruments that are playing the same rhythmic part.\n\nA vocal stem is the lead vocal with all of its effects in stereo. A vocal stem can come in very handy if someone wants a mix of your song with the vocal louder or softer. Just grab your instrumental or TV mix and re-lay your vocal at the level you want. A vocal stem with background vocals is worth having as well.\n\nAs long as you have your mix on the board, run off as many different stems as you think you might need. It takes a little extra effort but now is the time to do it.\n\n– Try It Now –\n\nFor some of the versions I’ve listed here, you’ll need the original music files or tapes of you song. If it’s an older song you may not have those available. (That’s why it’s so important to think about alternate versions when you’re actually recording and mixing your song.)\n\nIn that case, consider the “cover version” option for your alternate recording. Bring something new to your interpretation of the song. Take a fresh look for things you didn’t notice before. Try a simple stripped-down recording of the song and see what happens."
