        "text": "She said: “‘That’s Not My Name’ is a really sad song for me. It’s empowering, but we’ve all had a point in our lives where we felt that s**t, that we’re useless at everything and that we weren’t memorable.\n\n“Everybody feels like, ‘I don’t know what my place is and I can’t seem to find myself,’ at some point, and I don’t think a lot of people saw that with the song. Most people probably thought it was about some boy in a bar who has forgotten your name – but it really wasn’t about that. It was about feeling invisible and unconfident.”\n\nKatie – who is joined in the group by multi-instrumentalist Jules De Martino – also praised rapper Dizzee Rascal for his cover version of the song, in which he changed the lyrics to relate to himself.\n\nThe 27-year-old singer added: “With Dizzee Rascal, he really listened to our lyrics, he changed them but kept the sentiment there - but did it as if it was for his life, so it was really interesting to hear it, because it is a song that was very close to us and he did such an interesting take on it.”"
