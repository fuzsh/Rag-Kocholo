Before long, you're likely to hear a song you want to add to your playlists.\n\nThere's just one problem though... you don't know the name of the song, or the artists.\n\nIdentifying a song used to be a lot more difficult, luckily there are apps and websites to help.\n\n10 ways that you can identify a song:\n\nGoogle Assistant\n\nShazam\n\nSiri\n\nAlexa\n\nDeezer's SongCatcher\n\nNow Playing & iPhone's Control Centre\n\nSmart Speakers\n\nSoundHound\n\nMusixmatch\n\nAHA Music\n\nHow to Identify Songs\n\nHere are ten fast ways to find the music that you can't get out of your head.\n\n1. Google Assistant\n\nOver the years, Google has improved its ability to identify songs. It's now even easier to find the music you're looking for. With Google Assistant, you can hum or sing a part of the track. You can do this even if it's no longer playing.
