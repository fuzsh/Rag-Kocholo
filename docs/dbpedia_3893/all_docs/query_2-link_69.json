        "text": "Remember that time you were walking down the street, on the bus, at this random party and you heard a song you wanted to add to your favorite playlist and wondered: what song is this?\n\nHere are tips from Opera on apps and websites that can help you identify tunes and songs.\n\n1. Shazam\n\nShazam is one of the most popular apps to use for this kind of quest. It is very accurate and identifies the song quickly. Just tap the big blue button and let it listen to the music. No internet connection? No problem. Shazam tags the song you made it listen, so you can easily find it and try later when you are connected. It is available for Android and iOS. There‚Äôs also a desktop version you can check out here. üôÇ\n\n2. SoundHound\n\nForgot the lyrics despite your best attempt to remember them? Don‚Äôt panic ‚Äì as long as you can remember the tune, all is not lost.. SoundHound can identify a song by listening to the melody ‚Äì you can sing it, hum it or even whistle it. To start, just tap SoundHound‚Äôs orange button, and it will do its best to match your recording. It will give you a list of possible songs, so don‚Äôt worry if your singing isn‚Äôt pitch perfect.\n\n3. Ok Google, Siri & Cortana\n\nThis is the easiest way to identify songs if you don‚Äôt want to download any third-party apps. Just ask Ok Google, Siri or Cortana ‚ÄúWhat song is this?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat music is playing?‚Äù, etc., and they‚Äôll find it for you in no time. üôÇ\n\nOn your Android, turn on ‚ÄúOk Google‚Äù or tap the mic button on Search. If you have an iPhone, ask Siri ‚ÄúWhat song is this?‚Äù and let her listen to it. Windows Phone? Press the Search button to go to Cortana, tap the Music search icon, and she will start listening.\n\n4. WatZatSong\n\nWhen all else fails, crowdsourcing the answer can save the day. WatZatSong is an online community where you can upload a sample of the track you are trying to identify. Write as many details you know about it and other members will help you name it as fast as possible."
