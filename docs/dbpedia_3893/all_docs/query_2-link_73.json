        "text": "The 90s pop song “Mambo No 5” was known for listing names of women. The names it included were Angela, Pamela, Sandra, Rita, Monica, Erica, Tina, Sandra, Mary, and Jessica. My natural question was, how were these names chosen? Just to fit the rhythm, or also to target a specific demographic?\n\nFirst of all, these are all popular names. At their height, all of them cracked the top 42 baby names for girls in the US, and most of them made the top 10. Some like Jessica and Mary hit the #1 spot.\n\nAssuming that a baby was named at the time when that name was most popular in the US, this is how old they would each be when “Mambo No 5” came out in 1999:\n\nAngela: 24\n\nPamela: 45\n\nSandra: 53\n\nRita: 69\n\nMonica: 26\n\nErica: 16\n\nTina: 31\n\nSandra: 53\n\nMary: This one is special. Its peak in popularity was before the 20th century, but it remained the #1 name until 1947, and a top 10 name until 1972. So it was popular among everyone 26 or older, and incredibly common among people 52 or older.\n\nJessica: 12\n\nAs far as I can tell, the song is deliberately trying to target a very broad target demographic, using one name to target each age group. It mixes names that achieved huge popularity in the late 80s like Jessica, names that achieved huge popularity in the 40s like Sandra, and perennial names that were popular for decades like Mary. As a result, almost anybody will know at least one person with one of these names (it would be interesting to verify this with some friend graph data!) Just as pop songs like “Living in America” attempt to exhaustively list major metropolitan centers, in order to allow more people to relate to the lyrics, this song does the same with names."
