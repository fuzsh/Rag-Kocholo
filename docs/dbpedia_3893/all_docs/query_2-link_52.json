        "text": "Updated: January 29\n\nEver wondered about the song playing in a video but had no clue how to identify it? That‚Äôs a burning question of music enthusiasts everywhere. You don‚Äôt have to ask around about the video in your camera roll to identify a song ‚Äî you can discover the songs hidden in your videos with just one app on your phone.\n\nIn this guide, we‚Äôll show you how to find a song from a video. Let‚Äôs get started!\n\nHow to Identify Songs Already on Your Phone With Shazam\n\nMake sure you‚Äôve downloaded the Shazam app, which is free, for your operating system. Before playing music, the app should be running in the background.\n\nHere‚Äôs how to Shazam a video:\n\nStart by launching Shazam on your device.\n\nWithin the app, tap the Shazam button to kick off the identification process.\n\nGo to your camera roll and tap play while Shazam works to identify the song.\n\nGet notified once Shazam successfully identifies the song.\n\n6. If you‚Äôre on an iPhone or iPad, tap play to listen to a preview of the identified song.\n\nEven without an internet connection, Shazam generates a unique digital fingerprint for songs. This fingerprint is later matched with the database once your device reconnects, and any unidentified songs are promptly removed from your pending Shazams.\n\nüí°üí°Read also: How to Download Audio from YouTube\n\nHow to View the Results\n\nWhat if you want to see your previous Shazams? Here‚Äôs where to check the results on various devices:\n\nOn iPhone or iPad: Access My Music by swiping up on the main Shazam screen. If you want to remove a Shazam, tap More and select Remove from My Music.\n\nOn Android: Go to the Library by swiping or tapping the Library button. If you want to delete a Shazam, tap More next to it in the Library, and then choose Remove from your library.\n\nOn Mac and PC: The Shazam button displays recent Shazams below it.\n\nOn Apple Watch: Underneath the Shazam button, you‚Äôll see the most recent Shazams that are stored in My Music on your iPhone.\n\nFor an added layer of security, just make sure your Shazams are backed up on iCloud for your iPhone or iPad. It happens automatically when you‚Äôre signed in with your Apple ID and have iCloud turned on for Shazam. This way, you won‚Äôt lose them if anything happens to your device, and you can easily access them on other devices using the same Apple ID.\n\nIf you opt not to back up on iCloud, your Shazams stay on your device. They can be backed up anytime unless you‚Äôve restored to factory settings or got a new device.\n\nHow to Enable Auto Shazam\n\nThis feature allows Shazam to automatically identify the music playing around you. If that sounds good to you, here‚Äôs how to find a song from a video on your phone with Auto Shazam:\n\nHold down the Shazam button, or click and hold it.\n\n2. Swipe up to navigate to My Music on the main Shazam screen.\n\n3. Hit the Settings button.\n\n4. Toggle on the option for Shazam to start listening automatically upon opening the app.\n\n5. The songs in My Music will be sorted by date.\n\nWhat to do if you change your mind ‚Äî return to the app, tap the Shazam button, and the feature will be turned off.\n\nOther Things to Know\n\nShazam is available on Apple Watch, Macs, and Android Wear. Since Apple acquired the company in 2018, it has been integrated into Siri on Apple devices.\n\nYou can easily share identified songs on social media, through email or text messages. Moreover, Shazam has the option to open the song on Spotify ot Apple Music or purchase it on iTunes. You can also add identified songs to your Spotify or Apple Music playlists.\n\nAnother fun feature is that the app lets you see lyrics, along with top songs by the artist, other albums, music videos, suggested similar songs, and track details.\n\nIf you‚Äôre having trouble finding songs, here are some solutions:\n\nTurn up your device‚Äôs volume because Shazam may have trouble recognizing a song if the microphone doesn‚Äôt catch the sound.\n\nWhat can also improve Shazam‚Äôs ability to recognize a song is using headphones or earbuds close to your device‚Äôs microphone. Adjust the volume as needed.\n\nHow to Use Shazam Chrome Extension to Find a Song From a Video\n\nIf you have a computer nearby, you might find it easier to identify a song from a video on a desktop. In that case, the Shazam Chrome extension is a fantastic tool.\n\nImportant note: the Shazam extension only listens to the audio in the current browser tab and doesn‚Äôt use speakers or a microphone. So, you won‚Äôt be able to use both your phone and computer for this.\n\nGo to the Shazam extension page on the Google Chrome Web Store using a Chromium web browser on your Mac or PC.\n\nClick Add to [your browser].\n\nClick Add extension to confirm\n\nOnce added, you‚Äôll find the Shazam icon in your browser toolbar. Now, let‚Äôs move on to identifying a song in a playing tab:\n\nOpen iCloud, log in, and go to your camera roll.\n\nPlay the video with the song you want to identify.\n\nClick the Shazam icon while the video is playing.\n\nWait for Shazam to identify the song.\n\nReview the displayed song details.\n\nIf you‚Äôre not logged into Apple Music, click on Connect Apple Music, enter your Apple ID credentials, and follow the on-screen instructions to allow Shazam access to listen to full songs.\n\nüñêÔ∏è\n\nOther Apps to Try If You Want to Find a Song From a Video in the Camera Roll\n\nShazam is not the only song finder by video out there. Some alternatives that you might find useful are:\n\nSiri ‚Äî Ask, ‚ÄúWhat song is playing right now?‚Äù and Siri will provide the name.\n\nGoogle Assistant ‚Äî Say ‚ÄúHey Google, what song is in this video.‚Äù It quickly provides the song‚Äôs name and links to streaming services.\n\nBixby and Alexa follow the same logic.\n\nSoundHound ‚Äî SoundHound can identify songs, even if you hum. The app also provides lyrics and supports multiple streaming services.\n\nMusixmatch Lyrics ‚Äî Use the Identify menu for song recognition and real-time synchronization of music and lyrics.\n\nMusicID ‚Äî This one identifies music and allows you to add notes about why and where you identified it.\n\nGenius ‚Äî Genius focuses on song lyrics and offers a music recognition feature, as well as provides a list of the most identified songs on the platform.\n\nThere you have it ‚Äî the lowdown on identifying tunes from videos on your phone!\n\nFAQ"
