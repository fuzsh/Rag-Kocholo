Singer/songwriter/recording artist Brooke Ligertwood (who sings lead on the recording) tells us the story behind the song.\n\nOn the blog of their website, Hillsong deconstructs the power behind the name of Jesus, and when that's done, it becomes a pallet of properties to describe how very beautiful the name is.\n\nWhat hides in the name of Jesus?\n\nThe name of Jesus encompasses more than we can hope or imagineâ€”more beauty, more wonder, more power."
