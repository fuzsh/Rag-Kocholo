        "text": "Ginny Owens has had an award-winning career that encompasses two decades as a singer/songwriter, recording artist, author and speaker. She continues to inspire others with the truth of the gospel through her personal stories, songs, and Bible teaching!\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nÂ CHORDS / RESOURCES\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nDuring this seemingly endless pandemic season, Iâve thought a lot about the hope we have as believers in Christ, and how unique and beautiful this hope is. My friends Tyrus Morgan (Unspoken, We are Messengers), and Leslie Jordan (All Sons and Daughters) and I wrote about this unbreakable, eternal hope in one of my favorite songs Iâve ever been a part of writing, Greater Still.\n\nÂ\n\nAs Christians, our great hope is that Christ came to earth and gave His life for our wrongs and failures - so that if we are in Him, nothing can ever separate us from His love (Romans 8:38-39). And thatâs just the beginning! At this very moment, the power that raised Christ from the dead is working in your heart and mine (Ephesians 1:19-20), and bit by bit, we are being transformed to look more like Him and to radiate His glory (2 Corinthians 13:18). All of this is in preparation for that unfathomable day when we will gaze on His beauty face to face, fully knowing Him, just as we are fully known (1 Corinthians 13:12).\n\nÂ\n\nHow does this play out in our everyday lives? We carry the hope of Heaven inside our hearts. If we let it, it can provide deep peace amidst unsettling circumstances, be the calm in our chaos, and give us a reason to go and serve those around us with relentless joy. And you know what else? This hope allows us to lift our eyes from our challenges, centering us in the truth that the best is yet to come.\n\nDoes this excite you the way it excites me?\n\nÂ\n\nSince I was three, I have had no eyesight due to a degenerative eye condition and a surgery that depleted my vision instead of restoring it. Because of this, I get to see the world through the eyes of my friends and family, which is a blessing! But, I know Iâm only getting a vague sense of the visual pictures they paint for me. Paul says that weâre all a bit blind this side of Heaven - we know a little of the picture, that we see but a reflection in the mirror. But there will be a moment when you and I can see clearly, no longer overwhelmed by lifeâs haze. In that moment, God will wipe away every tear from our eyes, and pain, grief, and death will be no more (Revelation 21:4).\n\nÂ\n\nGreater Still is a reminder of what is to comeâeternal communion with the Lord and the Lambâand its call to us to live in the here and now with that future hope at the forefront of our hearts.\n\nÂ\n\nYou can listen to Greater Still right now as part of Ginny's new EP below!\n\nÂ\n\nLISTEN NOW\n\nÂ\n\nAs well as a songwriter,Â Ginny has written a book around the same theme.Â Far too often, lifeâs challenges and questions cause people to fight feelings of doubt and despair, as they search endlessly for hope. In Singing in the Dark,Â GinnyÂ introduces the reader to powerful ways of drawing closer to God and how the elements of music, prayer, and lament offer rich, vibrant, and joyful communion with Him, especially on the darkest days.\n\nSinging In The Dark is available now - follow the link below to order your copy!\n\nÂ"
