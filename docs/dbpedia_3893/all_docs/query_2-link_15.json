        "text": "Music is everywhere. You could be in a cab or a café, or sitting on your couch, when a new song finds its way into your head and takes up residence. But the sweet joy of discovering a fresh favorite can turn bitter in an instant when you can’t name that tune. Luckily, you can get help. Here's how to use your smartphone to identify a song.\n\nNeed some new gear to listen to music? Check out our buying guides, including the Best Wireless Earbuds, Best Noise-Canceling Headphones, and Best Audiophile Gear.\n\nSpecial offer for Gear readers: Get a 1-year subscription to WIRED for $5 ($25 off). This includes unlimited access to WIRED.com and our print magazine (if you'd like). Subscriptions help fund the work we do every day.\n\nGoogle Assistant (Android or iPhone)\n\nGoogle has offered some form of song recognition for years now, but it has improved significantly over time. Even if the song you want is no longer playing, you can try humming or singing it. Here’s how:\n\nOn an Android device, say, “Hey Google,” or touch and hold the home button. On an iPhone, open the Google app and tap the microphone button.\n\nAsk, “What’s this song?”\n\nIf the song is playing, Google Assistant will name it and give you a YouTube link. You can also hum, whistle, or sing the melody, and Google will suggest potential matches.\n\nSadly, this doesn't work on Wear OS smartwatches, but you can try Shazam (see below) to get song recognition on your wrist.\n\nSiri (iPhone)\n\nYou can use Siri to identify a song on most Apple devices, including the Apple Watch, but it has to be the original version. It won't recognize your humming or singing.\n\nSay, “Hey Siri,” or long-press the power button on an iPhone or the digital crown on an Apple Watch.\n\nAsk, “What’s this song?”\n\nIf the song is playing, Siri will name it and give you an Apple Music link.\n\nShazam (Android or iPhone)\n\nShazam was the original music-recognition service and it offers handy extras like synced lyrics, links to some of the best music streaming services, and easy sharing on social media. Apple acquired Shazam in 2018, but the app is still available for Android, as well as iOS. It also works on many of our picks for the best smartwatches.\n\nThere's Still Time to Shop The 313 Absolute Best Prime Day Deals\n\nWe've been watching, and these deals are going fast. From laptops and tablets to Airpods and Echo dots, grab the best Prime Day deals before it's too late.\n\nThe Best Fitness Trackers and Watches for Everyone\n\nWhether you’re skiing in the backcountry or trampolining in the backyard, we have an activity tracker for you.\n\nMissed Out on Prime Day? These 155 Deals Are Still Going Strong\n\nYou can still snag many of the same Prime Day deals on security cameras, hair straighteners, and iPads—though these discounts are quickly disappearing.\n\nThe Top New Features Coming to Apple’s iOS 18 and iPadOS 18\n\nApple Intelligence has arrived in the iOS 18.1 developer beta, bringing features like the updated Siri and Writing Tools. Here’s how to access it, plus the top new features in iOS 18 and iPadOS 18.\n\nThe Best Smart Speakers With Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri\n\nChatty assistants from Amazon, Google, and Apple are popular. But which one is right for you?\n\nThese Are Our Favorite Smart Displays\n\nEver wish you could smash a tablet and smart speaker together? These devices offer the best of both.\n\nWhich iPhone Should You Buy (or Avoid) Right Now?\n\nThe iPhone 16 arrives in September. That means this is the worst moment to buy a new iPhone.\n\nThe 30 Best Mac Apps That Will Make Your Life Easier\n\nSavor the sweet taste of these third-party Mac apps for better editing, organization, journaling, and more."
