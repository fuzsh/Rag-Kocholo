        "text": "a few words from cliff preston\n\nThere is a common theme in my life. I've been given so much grace. I used to sing the hymn “Grace Greater Than All My Sin.” I sang this song long before I knew what it meant or how much I would need its truth. I remember sitting in the darkest time of my life. I believed that my life was over. I believed that my family was over. I believed my ministry was over.\n\nOh, but that dreadful, beautiful cross.\n\nJesus' sacrifice is so great that it is undefeated and will remain so. His victory is more significant than all of the things we have done and could do. So, today, whatever you’re facing, and thinking is insurmountable…His blood is Greater Still!\n\nGreater still lyrics\n\nVerse 1\n\nFor great the fall that broke perfectio\n\nAnd great the stain passed down through time\n\nThe sickness strong, the sorrow long, No peace to find\n\nVerse 2\n\nFor great the void that separated\n\nAnd great the heart of flesh and lies\n\nBut greater still the faithful will of Jesus Christ!\n\nChorus 1\n\nOh Lord, our Lord\n\nHow awesome is Your name In all the earth!\n\nForever we proclaim\n\n\"Greater still the power of our God!\"\n\nVerse 3\n\nFor great the cost of our salvation\n\nAnd great the debt that must be paid\n\nBut greater still the blood\n\nThat spilled and Love displayed!\n\nChorus 2\n\nOh Lord, our Lord\n\nHow awesome is Your name\n\nIn all the earth!\n\nForever we proclaim\n\n\"Greater still the power of our God!\"\n\nVerse 4\n\nFor great the tomb that held our Savior\n\nAnd great the stone that sealed the door\n\nBut a guilty grave cannot contain\n\nOur Christ, the Lord! Oh!\n\nChorus 3\n\nOh Lord, our Lord\n\nHow awesome is Your name In all the earth!\n\nForever we proclaim\n\n\"Greater still the power of our God!\"\n\nTag 1\n\nOh, Jesus Christ, the One who conquers all!\n\nThe Lamb of God has torn down every wall!\n\nGreater still the power of our God!\n\nGreater still the power of our God!\n\nCliff Preston Bio\n\n“I try to see people through the lens of what God has brought me through and saved me from. I believe that if God can love and use even me, he can love and use anyone.”\n\nIt’s been said that what sets Cliff Preston apart is his raw authenticity and compassion. Preston’s music ministry began in 2002 as he began traveling with bands to bring awareness to the love of Jesus as well as the mental health crisis. With his father being a professional counselor and pastor, he was very aware of the effect that mental health was having on the generation, as well as the ultimate source of wellness - the finished work of the cross. He has spent the following twenty years traveling the country writing songs, leading worship, preaching, and even opening businesses geared towards Christ-centered clinical mental healthcare.\n\nCliff is proud to call Smackover, Arkansas his hometown. He is even prouder of God’s faithfulness through his marriage with his wife Leslie, and the wisdom God provides as they raise their daughter Kannyn (12), and their two sons Murphy (10) and Campbell (2).\n\nCliff brings over two decades of ministry experience and business development to his partnership with People & Songs. In that time, he has written songs for artists including Newsong, JJ Weeks, Carrolton and more. He has shared the stage with artists such as MercyMe, Jeremy Camp, and Natalie Grant among others. All while opening and building companies that develop platforms to display Christ to a lost and hurting world.\n\nCliff is excited for what is to come as he joins forces with this diverse team of artists, worship leaders, and writers for the glory of God."
