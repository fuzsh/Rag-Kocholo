        "text": "Well, here's some information from the page \"More Information on Fair Use\" at copyright.gov.\n\nThe law \"calls for consideration of the following four factors in evaluating a question of fair use:\"\n\nPurpose and character of the use, including whether the use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes: Courts look at how the party claiming fair use is using the copyrighted work, and are more likely to find that nonprofit educational and noncommercial uses are fair. This does not mean, however, that all nonprofit education and noncommercial uses are fair and all commercial uses are not fair; instead, courts will balance the purpose and character of the use against the other factors below. Additionally, “transformative” uses are more likely to be considered fair. Transformative uses are those that add something new, with a further purpose or different character, and do not substitute for the original use of the work.\n\nYour use may be of a commercial nature, but that doesn't mean it's not fair use. Since you're writing a novel, not a song, you are definitely \"add[ing] something new, with a further purpose or different character\", and your novel would not \"substitute for the original use of the work\".\n\nNature of the copyrighted work: This factor analyzes the degree to which the work that was used relates to copyright’s purpose of encouraging creative expression. Thus, using a more creative or imaginative work (such as a novel, movie, or song) is less likely to support a claim of a fair use than using a factual work (such as a technical article or news item). In addition, use of an unpublished work is less likely to be considered fair.\n\nSongs are \"creative or imaginative\", so that doesn't count in your favor. But presumably the songs you're quoting have been published, so that would count for you.\n\nAmount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole: Under this factor, courts look at both the quantity and quality of the copyrighted material that was used. If the use includes a large portion of the copyrighted work, fair use is less likely to be found; if the use employs only a small amount of copyrighted material, fair use is more likely.\n\nIt sounds like you are using only a few words from each song, so this factor counts in your favor.\n\nEffect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work: Here, courts review whether, and to what extent, the unlicensed use harms the existing or future market for the copyright owner’s original work.\n\nYour use is unlikely to hurt the market or value of the songs.\n\nSummary\n\nIn favor of fair use:\n\nYou are using only a small and relatively unimportant piece of each song.\n\nYour work is almost entirely new and different from the songs.\n\nYour work probably won't compete with sales of the original work.\n\nThe songs you're quoting have already been published.\n\nAgainst fair use:\n\nYour work may be \"of a commercial nature\".\n\nThe songs are a \"creative or imaginative\" work.\n\nCompare what you want to do to Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. Both of the \"against\" factors I just mentioned applied in that case, and not all of the \"in favor\" factors applied; nevertheless, it was held to be fair use.\n\nIANAL, but Titles (and I assume chapter titles) cannot be copyrighted. https://www.thebalance.com/can-a-book-title-be-copyrighted-3974593\n\nIf I were quoting at least half of the song somewhere, maybe I would seek clearance, but this sounds like a very superficial reference.\n\nIt would be different if you were taking a character or a dramatic situation created specifically for a song and made a different work. In that case, the song writer MIGHT be able to say that this was a derivative work. Let's say you wrote a movie that dramatized the life of Eleanor Rigby or the Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald. That would be such an example where the song writers could claim that yours was a derivative work.\n\nAnother issue would be if the song or title was trademarked, but that's also doubtful.\n\nBut you are not doing that. You are referring to a historical fact of a song and a band. That is certainly fair game.\n\nYour comfort level with legal ambiguity might drive you to seek legal help, but I personally would take the risk on this matter. If you are publishing ebooks (not print ebooks), any conflict at worst would probably result in having to re-edit later versions.\n\n2020 Update. It was pointed out that a trademark does not need to be registered to be valid. (IANAL and did not know this). But for interstate commerce (and we can assume that both the song are book are sold interstate), typically it is necessary for you to register the trademark in order to protect it. Also, I'm not sure any trademark notice was published with that particular song/album. Finally, there is no problem of product confusion because a song and book are different mediums. For more, see this NOLO article about unregistered trademarks.\n\nIANAL, but questions of this sort fall under the doctrine of fair use, which may differ from one jurisdiction to another. Generally, fair use says that there are certain exceptions to the protection provided by copyright law that allow people limited use of those material for specific purposes such as criticism or parody. Fair use is described here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use.\n\nOf course, no one here can tell you with any certainty if your proposed use constitutes fair use or not. If you submit your work to a publisher, they are probably going to be extremely conservative in interpreting the fair use doctrine and are likely to insist on your getting permission from the copyright holder even in cases that you may think are clearly fair use.\n\nIANAL, but I personally don't see the issue... There are probably well over a million songs out there throughout the history of the modern era of music. Each CD has what 15 songs a minimum? If you were to go through every artist, big name or no name, each year, dating back to the first time lyrics were recorded on paper we would be in a lot of copyright troubles. The point being that... there are only so many combinations of words before they come up again. Even within lyrics, there are phrases that are repeated. Yes there are trade mark lyrics to a song as @RoBtA pointed out that pretty much everyone knows, but if you asked me to name what songs your chapter titles came from or even the name of your book, I wouldn't even have known they were from songs personally.\n\nDefinitely check with a lawyer about this or someone who actually has knowledge in the legal fields, but I find the titles vague enough that they can be passed off for as general phrases even though your inspiration was from songs. Everyone has inspiration, and that inspiration is usually found within the body of work you do. Painters inspired by Vincent van Gogh may show a little bit of his art style. musically... Blake Shelton (a country music singer) has been dating a female singer named Gwen Stephani (was in a Ska band later went solo pop). In one of Blake's songs, he made a reference to one of her CD titles when she was in No Doubt. \"Gonna put a little Rock Steady on your hand\" - Gonna by Black Shelton. While this isn't directly like yours... people still often use inspiration in their body of works."
