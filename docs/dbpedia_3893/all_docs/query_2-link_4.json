        "text": "As a lover of both technology and music, Shazam is one of the best apps Iâve come across. Often times I will hear a beautiful piece of composition that catches my ear and donât know the artist, song title or variant of it and canât find it - but with Shazam, thatâs a thing of the past.\n\nIâve been using this program for some years now and one thing that has amazed me is the quickness in which Shazam can identify the music piece in question, currently watching âThe Creatorâ (great Sci-Fi film btw) and it had a japanese or asian song that caught my ear (during the scene where the police raid the apartment to recapture Alpha) and I started the program up to capture the song on a part where it was just instrumentation under sounds and dialogue and within in less than 2 seconds Shazam picked up on what the song was and that is what motivated me to write this review.\n\nWith the advent of A.I. I can only wonder what amazing benefits and new advancements can be made with Shazam.\n\nIf youâre ever in search of a song artist, title or variant you hear in any media, THIS IS THE APP YOU WANT!\n\nThank you Shazam devs for creating, maintaining and keeping this amazing application up to date. Keep up the great work!\n\nJust downloaded it and tried something like this for the first time in my life. It failed to recognize a very common piece of freaking classical music because it was used in an informational video with someone talking over it. The volume of the music was fine, it wasnât hard to hear at all and something like famous classical pieces should be one of the easiest things to identify and an easy measure of success for such an app. It was very disappointing that this app couldnât solve a simple problem I would think would be very common. That basically tells me that this app doesnât function except in the most ideal of circumstances. What hope does this have of working in other realistic everyday circumstances like hearing music at a bar or in a tv show or at any other event you encounter in life. Really what is the point and utility in such an app then. It isnât practical at all, itâs far far too limited. I donât know who this benefits or how the business model could possibly be successful. Especially in this day and age, you guys should really invest in using AI or something to improve the success. I hope you read these reviews to improve the app because I donât know how else to send feedback, and I hope it improves because I wouldnât have a purpose in using it again until/if it does, but I would love if it could help me do what Iâd like and what I thought its very intended purpose is. Please do something to make it better.\n\nSo this app has been extremely helpful in the past. I HATE when I canât remember the name of a song, or figure out who is singing when itâs on the tip of my tongue. This app has helped cut those moments down. But I usually run into the issue of not getting to it fast enough. By the time I remember to use it and go to open it on my phone and then press the button, itâs often been too late and the song is over ð«. If it could be listening in the background or as soon as I open it could fix that.\n\nAlso I understand the complexity involved, but a lot of times I want to look up or listen to a song but canât remember enough lyrics or anything, just a tune. I wish there was an app that didnât rely on exact recordings but you could hum or sing parts you remember and it could guess a few options..?! ð I know thatâs a tall order, but someone will be able to do it sometime in the future I guarantee it! Go for it Shazam! Start now! Lol.\n\nAnyway I had it at 3 stars for those 2 reasons. But given the amount of songs it recognizes (itâs never not recognized one that Iâve tried), and how it only needs about 2-5 seconds of ANY PIECE of ANY SONG, I evened it out to a 4 â­ï¸. Itâs really a 5 for what it does, but a 3 for its potential to expand. So bam, you get 4. Kbye."
