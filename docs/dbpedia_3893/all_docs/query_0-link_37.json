I'm singing, I'm shouting, I'm happy and I'm free. I'm a soldier in an army that never has known defeat. Greater, Greater, Greater is He in me. For so long I wondered in this cold, cruel world alone. Heartbreak and much failure was just about all I'd ever known. Then I met God's only Son who listened to my plea. Now life has a brand new chapter, Greater is He in me.
