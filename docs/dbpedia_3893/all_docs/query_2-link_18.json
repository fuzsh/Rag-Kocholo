After it’s identified, the song is added to My Music in the Shazam app. The identified song is also synced to Music Recognition history in Control Center.\n\nFor the best experience, make sure you’ve set up Siri and turned on iCloud Sync and Music Recognition.\n\nYou can also identify a song using Siri on HomePod, on Apple Watch, or on Mac.\n\nSiri is not available in all regions and languages."
