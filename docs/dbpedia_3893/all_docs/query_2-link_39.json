        "text": "Have you ever been in a situation where you happen to hear a song you like, but there is absolutely no way to figure out which song it is? I’m sure you have. It happens to all of us, and that nagging feeling of “what song is this?” just doesn’t seem to let go, does it? Well, if you’ve been in such a situation, or if you find yourself in this situation too often, we have your back. Here are the 18 mobile and web apps to identify songs playing around you.\n\n1. Use Google Assistant to Recognise Songs\n\nFor Android users, Google Assistant is one of the best ways to recognize songs on the go. Just say “Hey Google, what is this song” or “recognize/identify this song” and Google will start listening to the music. Within a few seconds, it will offer you the name of the song with playable links from a host of streaming services.\n\nIn my experience, it has picked music playing from a faraway room and has identified songs correctly. What’s more, you can even hum, whistle, or sing songs yourself and Google can identify them for you. So from my side, Google Assistant is just better in terms of music recognition. Note that the song recognition feature on Google Assistant is not available on iOS.\n\nApart from that, if you don’t want to use Google Assistant and want a straightforward button to instantly identify a song then Google has you covered with a simple widget. Just tap and hold on your home screen and open “Widgets“. Now, scroll down to Google and you will find “Sound Search”.\n\nDrag it and drop the widget on your home screen. Now onwards, whenever you want to identify a song, you can simply tap on the widget and it will start listening to the music. After that, Google will present you with all the song details. Easy peasy! This way, you will not need a separate app to identify music.\n\nFinally, if you own a Pixel device then you don’t even have to ask Google to identify a song. New-gen Pixel devices (Pixel 2 and above) come with a built-in “Now Playing” feature that tracks music on the go even when you are offline.\n\nYou will automatically get a notification on your lock screen that tells you what song is playing. You can save the music or discard it then and there. You can enable the feature from Settings -> Sound -> Now Playing.\n\n2. Identify Songs with Siri\n\nSiri is slowly (but surely) improving in its capabilities, and with the support for Shortcuts, it has become an amazing automation tool. One of the really cool things that you can do with Siri, is using it to recognize music and identify songs. Ever since Apple acquired Shazam in 2018, Siri has been even more efficient in identifying songs.\n\nWhen you hear a song you want to identify, you can simply launch Siri, and say “What song is playing right now?“, or “Name that song“, or “Identify this song“. Siri will then listen to the song that is playing, and tell you the name of the song.\n\nYou can even tap on the result to view the song in Apple Music and play it if you’ve subscribed to the music streaming service. If you’re not an Apple Music subscriber, you will get the option to purchase the song or listen to a sample.\n\n3. Use Bixby to Identify Music\n\nBixby, Samsung’s proprietary voice assistant has picked up quite a few tricks over the years to compete with the likes of Siri and Google Assistant and song recognization is one of them. If you’re using a Samsung smartphone, you can ask Bixby to identify songs for you. To do so, simply activate Bixby by pressing the side button or trigger the assistant by saying “Hi, Bixby”. Now, ask “What’s the name of this song?” or “What track is playing” or “Who is this singer?” and you will get the search results with song name .\n\nBixby’s song recognition feature is comparatively slower than Google Assistant and Siri, but it gets the job done ultimately. Also, you’d need active internet connection for music recognition feature to work.\n\n4. Ask Alexa “What Song is this?”\n\nFinally, we have Alexa, another popular voice assistant, which has been improved by leaps and bounds over the past couple of years. Though originally it could only recognise music playing in Amazon Music, Alexa can now identify songs from Spotify as well as other popular music streaming services.\n\nFurther, if you are neck-deep into Amazon’s ecosystem and own a handful of Echo devices then Alexa can be even more helpful. Make sure to enable the Song ID feature by saying “Alexa, turn on song ID“. After that, you can ask Alexa “what is this song” or “identify this music”.\n\n5. Automatically Recognise Songs and Music Playing Around You\n\nYou’re probably aware that the Pixel phones come with a really useful song identification feature called ‘Now Playing’ which can automatically identify music playing in your surroundings. So if you’re using a Pixel phone, you can make use of this feature to easily find any songs that are playing in your vicinity.\n\nGet Pixel’s Now Playing Feature on Any Smartphone\n\nIn case, you want the “Now Playing” feature of Pixel devices on other smartphones then you can set up Auto Shazam from the Settings page. It shows a persistent notification with music info of the songs playing around you. But keep in mind, it does not work offline like Pixel devices.\n\nSimilarly, iPhones also offer a nifty feature to recognize songs without much hassle. Since Shazam is now owned by Apple, the tech giant has integrated Shazam’s song identification feature right into the control centre of iPhone. To add music recognition to your iPhone’s Control Centre, go to Settings> Control Centre and tap on the ‘Plus’ symbol against Music Recognition option.\n\nNow, when you swipe down from your iPhone’s home screen to access the Control Centre, you will get the option right there.\n\n6. Ask Smart Speakers “What’s This Song?”\n\nIf you’re listening to music on a smart speaker like the Google Home (Nest Home) or the Amazon Echo, and you hear a song you want to find the name of, you can use a simple command to do so. Just ask “What’s this song?” and Google Assistant (or Alexa) will name the song that’s playing right now.\n\nYou can also use this command on any smart speaker that has Google Assistant or Alexa built-in, so it will work with third party speakers like the ones from Marshall, Eufy, etc., as well.\n\nNote: This feature doesn’t work if you’re listening to a radio station.\n\nMusic Recognition Apps to Find a Song\n\n7. Shazam\n\nIf you are looking for an app to identify music then Shazam is one of the most popular apps out there that can correctly recognize songs without many failed attempts. The app is available on Android and iOS and it works very well. And as I mentioned above, even Siri uses the Shazam database to identify songs. With Shazam, you can easily identify music around you, find a song, and even get lyrics so you can sing along.\n\nIf you don’t want to use Siri, Google Assistant, or Cortana to find out what song is playing around you, Shazam is probably the best app that identifies songs in a jiffy. What’s more, Shazam even remembers the recognized songs, and it can even work when you’re offline. It will record the audio and when you are connected to the internet, it will show the song information.\n\nWhat’s more, Shazam is fully integrated in iOS since iOS 14, which means you can easily use Shazam Music Recognition on iPhone without even installing the app. You can access it via the Control Center, and it even keeps track of all the songs it has recognised for you.\n\nApart from that, Shazam has recently been updated so that it supports recognising songs playing in any app on your smartphone. So, if you’re watching Instagram Reels, a video on YouTube, or anything else and you come across a song you don’t recognise, you can use Shazam to identify it for you!\n\nAlso, if you have a low-powered device then go with Shazam Lite which is pretty lightweight and brings the same music recognition algorithm.\n\nDownload: Android / iOS (Free)\n\n8. SoundHound\n\nSoundHound is another great song identifier app that works like a charm. One area where SoundHound is much better than Shazam is that you can even hum tunes to find a song. You can simply use the command “Hey Soundhound, what is that song?” The app works very well, and can tell you what song is this even if you’re humming a part of it.\n\nThis is extremely helpful when you don’t remember the lyrics for the song, and it’s just a song you remember the tune to. Simply launch SoundHound, and hum the tune to it. Apart from that, SoundHound is as fast as Shazam is, when it comes to identifying songs, and is an awesome app to identify music.\n\nWhat’s more, the app allows you to play music from multiple streaming services such as YouTube, Spotify, and more. It also provides lyrics for you to sing along. Not to mention, it keeps all your song discoveries in a clean UI. While the app is free for the most part, if you don’t want to see any ads then you can subscribe to the paid version.\n\nDownload: Android / iOS / Windows (Free, ad-supported, with in-app purchases)\n\nDownload: Android ($5.99) / iOS ($6.99)\n\n9.

The app is not just a music recognition app, but also a music player with lyrics support.

What’s unique here is that Musixmatch tries to sync the music and lyrics in real-time which works quite often.\n\nOther than that, it also offers translations of music lyrics to many global and regional languages.

Simply open the app and tap on the music recognition button located at the bottom-right corner.\n\nAfter that, the app identifies the music using ACRCloud’s service. In my testing, it worked all the time, but it was a bit slower in comparison to other apps.

You can tap on any of these songs, to see their lyrics, and to play them, if you want.
