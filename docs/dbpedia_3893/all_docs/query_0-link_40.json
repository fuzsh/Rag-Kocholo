        "text": "Greater\n\nColby and I went to Harvest America this past Sunday night which was live in Dallas and broadcast nationwide. Thanks to some friends, we got awesome seats and got to hear one of our favorite bands live, For King and Country. Mercy Me and Phil Wickham also played.\n\nI posted one of Mercy Me’s songs, The Hurt & the Healer last year. Well recently I have been listening to one of their newer songs, Greater, on repeat. Mercy Me played it live Sunday night and it gave me such a new meaning after seeing the lyrics on screen.\n\nNo matter what we face, God is greater. He desires for us to bring our doubts, fears, hurt, tears, shame, guilt, and pain to Him. Our identity isn’t based on any of those things, but based on what He calls us – redeemed. I hope you enjoy this song as much as I have!\n\nGreater\n\nBring your tired\n\nBring your shame\n\nBring your guilt\n\nBring your pain\n\nDon’t you know that’s not you’re name\n\nYou will always be much more to me\n\nEvery day I wrestle with the voices\n\nThat keep telling me I’m not right\n\nBut that’s alright\n\n‘Cause I hear a voice and He calls me redeemed\n\nWhen others say I’ll never be enough\n\nAnd greater is the One living inside of me\n\nThan he who is living in the world\n\nIn the world\n\nIn the world\n\nAnd greater is the One living inside of me\n\nThan he who is living in the world\n\nBring your doubts\n\nBring your fears\n\nBring your hurt\n\nBring your tears\n\nThere’ll be no condemnation here\n\nYou are holy, righteous and redeemed\n\nEvery time I fall\n\nThere’ll be those who will call me\n\nA mistake\n\nWell that’s ok\n\nThere’ll be days I lose the battle\n\nGrace says that it doesn’t matter\n\n‘Cause the cross already won the war\n\nHe’s Greater\n\nHe’s Greater"
