Everything I Do I Do It For You – Bryan Adams\n\nThe lyrics of “Everything I Do I Do It For You,” are about sacrifice and looking out for each other. This song teaches teams to be devoted to each other and committed to the cause, and to work for something bigger than themselves.\n\nMost pro-team lyric: “You know it’s true/Everything I do/I do it for you.”\n\n10. We Are Family – Sister Sledge\n\n“We Are Family,” is a fun, empowering tune about closeness and togetherness that is just as fitting for work families as for real relatives. The song is about sticking together and celebrating together.\n\nMost pro-team lyric: “All of the people around us they say/Can they be that close/Just let me state for the record/We’re giving love in a family dose.”\n\n11.

Team members feel more assured when knowing that teammates will stand by and stick up for each other.\n\nMost pro-team lyric: “Whenever you’re in trouble/Won’t you stand by me?”\n\n12.

The singer promises to be there in the most trying of times. The central message of the song is that bad days are more bearable when surrounded by supportive friends. Similarly, a group of great coworkers can make the most difficult jobs or days at work more enjoyable.\n\nNot to mention, chances are the whole crew will do the clap after the first line, and it is extra fun to clap along with other folks.\n\nMost pro-team lyric: “I’ll be there for you/(‘Cause you’re there for me too).”\n\n13. Count On Me – Bruno Mars\n\n“Count On Me,” is a sweet song that swears the singer will always be there to help. Bruno Mars declares, “we’ll find out what we’re made of. When we are called to help our friends in need.” The song is all about being dependable and being there for each other through tough times.\n\nMost pro-team lyric: “You can count on me like one, two, three/I’ll be there/And I know when I need it, I can count on you like four, three, two/And you’ll be there.”\n\n14.

The song promises, “If you ever need a helping hand/I’ll be there on the double just as fast as I can.”\n\nMost pro-team lyric: “If you need me, call me/No matter where you are/No matter how far/….Just call my name, I’ll be there in a hurry.”\n\n16. That’s What Friends Are For – Dionne Warwick, Stevie Wonder, Elton John, and Gladys Knight\n\nThis song itself is a product of teamwork, combining four music legends with different styles to make a mega hit. “That’s What Friends Are For,” is an ode to friendship and support. The singers vow to always be on the listener’s side, and swear that they can be counted on.\n\nMost pro-team lyric: “Keep smiling, keep shining/Knowing you can always count on me, for sure.”\n\n17. You’ve Got a Friend – Carole King\n\n“You’ve Got a Friend,” is a musical promise to be there in the darkest of times. Carole King croons out that she is ready to help as soon as you mention her name, which is an attitude desirable in any teammate.\n\nMost pro-team lyric: “You just call out my name/And you know, wherever I am/I’ll come runnin’.”\n\nHere is a Spotify playlist of these songs:\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/playlist/69APAWEN3UxKlMEFaXaXDw?si=5dd38ed18c264801\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nMusic has powers to change moods, and songs about teamwork can encourage employees to be more cooperative and think more fondly about coworkers.
