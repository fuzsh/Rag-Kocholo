        "text": "Hey @Kittenbird,\n\nThanks for posting here.\n\nCould you restart your device, log out and log back in again? Then you can try again adding a playlist cover with these steps.\n\nIf that doesn't help, you can log in to your account on another device to check if the cover appears.\n\nKeep in mind that the picture shouldn't violate any copyright, trademark, or personal image rights.\n\nLet us know how it goes.\n\nVer Moderator\n\nHelp others find this answer and click \"Accept as Solution\".\n\nIf you appreciate an answer, maybe give it a Like.\n\nAre you new to the Community? Take a moment to introduce yourself!\n\nHey @Paws_,\n\nThanks for the reply.\n\nDoes this happen only with playlists you've created or with all playlists you look at through the app?\n\nIf this happens only with certain playlists, do you mind sharing a link to one of them, so we can have a look at it?\n\nOn another note, is it possible, that you mean something like the reports in this thread?\n\nDo you want to see the playlist cover or the songs of the playlist listed? We're testing different design layouts as we're constantly striving to improve the user experience on our platform. We'll make sure to pass your feedback on this change to the right team.\n\nKeep us posted,\n\nCheers!\n\nDianModerator\n\nHelp others find this answer and click \"Accept as Solution\".\n\nIf you appreciate an answer, maybe give it a Like.\n\nThe playlist’s I make, and the playlist’s others make such as band albums, and playlist other users make are effected by this. If I look at mixes there is no issue.\n\nI do experience something similar to the thread.\n\nYesterday I made a new account and the same thing happened; I made a playlist and added a song and it only showed the title as seen in the pictures. I also deleted the Spotify mobile app more then twice, cleared all my data, cleared the cache, and logged out.\n\nIf I go on my computer there is no issue and I’m able to see the song photo, ect.\n\nHey @Paws_,\n\nThanks for the reply with the clarifications.\n\nThe layout you've described on the mobile app is the new layout for a free account. We're always trying to improve the user experience and that's why we're testing out new layouts and features on a regular basis.\n\nWe're also glad that you shared your feedback on this matter. You can find out more on how your feedback can reach Spotify on this page.\n\nHope this helps,\n\nCheers!\n\nDianModerator\n\nHelp others find this answer and click \"Accept as Solution\".\n\nIf you appreciate an answer, maybe give it a Like.\n\nThanks for explaining! The only thing is I’m not able to click on the music I want to play, and I have to click on the shuffle button. Is there a way to be able to pick the music I want to hear instead of pressing shuffle every time?\n\nHey @Paws_,\n\nThanks for the reply.\n\nThe functionalities of a free account are limited in comparison to an account with a Premium subscription.\n\nMore on the differences between the subscription types you can find out on this page.\n\nYou can find out how to get a Premium subscription on this page.\n\nHope this helps,\n\nCheers!\n\nDianModerator\n\nHelp others find this answer and click \"Accept as Solution\".\n\nIf you appreciate an answer, maybe give it a Like.\n\nHey this is another not-so-new spotify user, I´ve been using spotify for a while now and all of a sudden, starting yesterday last night, my playlists have started to lag, I work over a chromebook and now it won´t let me change the title covers or my playlists, or let me add photo´s to new ones, i´ve tried everything I possibly could, I don´t know if I could have gotten reported or not, but it´s quite concerning and I was wondering how to fix it? I could really use the help. Thanks sm.\n\n(P.S) This lag has started wayyyy before, it would lag every time I changed the profile photos of my playlists, but I really want a solution and fast!\n\nHi, will this be forever or will\n\nyou change it back so we are able to actually listen to our songs like we want to? Sorry if this sounds mean but it is just frustrating to not be able to listen to the songs I added to my playlist in order or having to search them up one by one anytime.\n\nI agree very much. I cannot play ANY songs on the spotify app, and with, personal things, it is causing me a LOT of anxiety. My screen looks just like the ones in the pictures, and will not let me play anything. All the answers have been very unsatisfactory on this thread. FIX THIS!!!!!\n\nVer I am sorry but your steps do not work and I do love the fact that you tried to help but I'm still stuck on the Exact same things everyone else is and We are in despite need to know how to fix it, if not maybe Spotify Themselves should try and fix it. Please if anyone else is having the same problems, we should ask Spotify to fix it\n\nWelcome to the Spotify Community @Krithika!\n\nSounds like you're previewing the tracks in the playlist. Unlike the desktop app and the Web Player, the mobile app doesn't offer on-demand playback for the most part, meaning most content will only be available in Shuffle-mode. In addition, if your playlist has less than 15 songs, the app will add song recommendations to extend its duration.\n\nStill, there's a handful of Pick and Play playlists (mostly found in the Made for You section) that are created by Spotify and do support on-demand playback, allowing you to view and play any song from the list, just like the other platforms. Note that these may vary over time.\n\nHope this clears things up. The Community is always here if there's something else you need assistance with.\n\nTaek care\n\nYordanModerator\n\nHelp others find this answer and click \"Accept as Solution\".\n\nIf you appreciate an answer, maybe give it a \"Like\".\n\nAre you new to the Community? Take a moment to introduce yourself!\n\nHi so on my Spotify (which I'm using on my IPad) everything was fine up until today (An issue I also had when listening to Spotify on Chrome before switching to Safari for music) and only the titles of the songs appeared instead of the actual songs and it was automatically stuck in shuffle mode? Is there anyway for me to turn it off and if so how?"
