        "text": "Grace might be the New Testament’s central idea. The fact that God pours blessing out on an undeserving humanity makes the cross the most shocking and beautiful expression of love imaginable.\n\nMany people believe that grace is a project where one is expected to earn their keep and prove their merit. It’s a startling thing to fall into the hands of God with absolutely nothing of value to make us deserving of His kindness. But His mercy triumphs over judgment and gives us what we could never earn. If that doesn’t create in you a worshipful spirit, nothing will!\n\nHere are ten Christian songs about grace.\n\nHymns about Grace\n\n1. Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing\n\nRobert Robinson was a handful. Born in 1735, he was always a difficult and rambunctious child whose parents eventually shipped him off to London at age 14 to take an apprenticeship with a barber. Things only went downhill from there.\n\nHe was 17 when an evangelist named George Whitefield came to London. Robinson and some buddies decided they would go down and check this evangelical meeting out for a few laughs. What he heard that night hit him hard, hounding him for the next three years. At 20, he gave his heart to Christ.\n\nHe eventually answered a call to ministry and while preparing a sermon wrote the original words to “Come Thou Fount.” Most hymnals have revised the song down to three verses from the original five. Asahel Nettleton wrote the music.\n\nCome, Thou Fount of every blessing,\n\nTune my heart to sing Thy grace;\n\nStreams of mercy, never ceasing,\n\nCall for songs of loudest praise.\n\nTeach me some melodious sonnet,\n\nSung by flaming tongues above.\n\nPraise the mount! I’m fixed upon it,\n\nMount of Thy redeeming love.\n\nSorrowing I shall be in spirit,\n\nTill released from flesh and sin,\n\nYet from what I do inherit,\n\nHere Thy praises I’ll begin;\n\nHere I raise my Ebenezer;\n\nHere by Thy great help I’ve come;\n\nAnd I hope, by Thy good pleasure,\n\nSafely to arrive at home.\n\nJesus sought me when a stranger,\n\nWandering from the fold of God;\n\nHe, to rescue me from danger,\n\nInterposed His precious blood;\n\nHow His kindness yet pursues me\n\nMortal tongue can never tell,\n\nClothed in flesh, till death shall loose me\n\nI cannot proclaim it well.\n\nO to grace how great a debtor\n\nDaily I’m constrained to be!\n\nLet Thy goodness, like a fetter,\n\nBind my wandering heart to Thee.\n\nProne to wander, Lord, I feel it,\n\nProne to leave the God I love;\n\nHere’s my heart, O take and seal it,\n\nSeal it for Thy courts above.\n\nO that day when freed from sinning,\n\nI shall see Thy lovely face;\n\nClothed then in blood washed linen\n\nHow I’ll sing Thy sovereign grace;\n\nCome, my Lord, no longer tarry,\n\nTake my ransomed soul away;\n\nSend thine angels now to carry\n\nMe to realms of endless day.\n\n2. All Hail the Power of Jesus’ Name\n\nThis hymn has often been called “the national anthem of Christendom.” The lyrics were written by Edward Perronet, and first appeared in a gospel magazine in 1779. It has been sung with many different tunes over the life of the church.\n\nAlthough ordained in the Anglican church, Perronet was devoted to the Methodism of John and Charles Wesley. He was a strong speaker, but always deferred to John Wesley when he was around.\n\nWesley was often frustrated that Perronet wouldn’t preach and one day he just stood up and announced that Brother Perronet was about to preach. Perronet stood up and said, “I will now share the greatest sermon ever preached.” And when he had everyone’s attention, he read the Sermon on the Mount from Matthew’s gospel and sat back down.\n\nWhen he wrote the words to “All Hail the Power of Jesus’ Name,” he declared that he had said all that he ever wanted to say.\n\nAll hail the power of Jesus’ name!\n\nLet angels prostrate fall;\n\nbring forth the royal diadem,\n\nand crown him Lord of all.\n\nBring forth the royal diadem,\n\nand crown him Lord of all.\n\nYe chosen seed of Israel’s race,\n\nye ransomed from the fall,\n\nhail him who saves you by his grace,\n\nand crown him Lord of all.\n\nHail him who saves you by his grace,\n\nand crown him Lord of all.\n\nSinners, whose love can ne’er forget\n\nthe wormwood and the gall,\n\ngo spread your trophies at his feet,\n\nand crown him Lord of all.\n\nGo spread your trophies at his feet,\n\nand crown him Lord of all.\n\n3. Silent Night\n\nIn 1818, a group of actors was touring Austria with gospel messages. On December 23, they showed up at Oberndorf, a village near Salzburg where they intended to re-enact the birth of Christ in the Church of St. Nicholas.\n\nSadly, the church organ was in disrepair and so they decided to put on their show in a private home. The evening put Josef Mohr in a pensive mood he went out for a long walk in the snow and ended up on a hill overlooking the village.\n\nHe put the words to “Silent Night” together in his mind and went to see Franz Gruber, the church organist. With the organ out, Gruber came up with a melody on guitar and they played it at church on Christmas morning.\n\nBuried in the verses is one particular lyric that jumps out in which Josef calls the advent, “the dawn of redeeming grace.” No words could better describe that moment.\n\nSilent night, holy night!\n\nAll is calm, all is bright.\n\nRound yon Virgin, Mother and Child.\n\nHoly infant so tender and mild,\n\nSleep in heavenly peace,\n\nSleep in heavenly peace\n\nSilent night, holy night!\n\nShepherds quake at the sight.\n\nGlories stream from heaven afar\n\nHeavenly hosts sing Alleluia,\n\nChrist the Savior is born!\n\nChrist the Savior is born\n\nSilent night, holy night!\n\nSon of God love’s pure light.\n\nRadiant beams from Thy holy face\n\nWith the dawn of redeeming grace,\n\nJesus Lord, at Thy birth\n\nJesus Lord, at Thy birth\n\n4. ‘Tis So Sweet to Trust in Jesus\n\nLouisa M. R. Stead moved to Cincinnati, OH from Dover, England in 1871. She was twenty-one years old. At a Christian camp she dedicated her life to missionary service and married in 1875. The couple had a daughter and began to build a beautiful life together.\n\nWhen their daughter turned four, the family decided to visit a beach in New York for a picnic lunch. No sooner had they sat down when Louisa’s husband heard a little boy’s cries for help out in the water. He rushed out to rescue the boy, but in his panic the boy pulled him under and both drowned.\n\nSoon Louisa and her daughter Lily moved to Cape Colony, South Africa where she worked as a missionary for fifteen years before she married again. It was during that time that she wrote this well-known hymn.\n\nIn the chorus she testifies to her trust in God, and then asks for him to give her the grace to trust him more. There’s a beauty in the recognition that even our dedication and faith is given to us as an act of God’s unmerited favor.\n\n’Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus,\n\nJust to take Him at His Word;\n\nJust to rest upon His promise,\n\nAnd to know, “Thus saith the Lord!”\n\nJesus, Jesus, how I trust Him!\n\nHow I’ve proved Him o’er and o’er;\n\nJesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!\n\nOh, for grace to trust Him more!\n\nOh, how sweet to trust in Jesus,\n\nJust to trust His cleansing blood;\n\nAnd in simple faith to plunge me\n\n‘Neath the healing, cleansing flood!\n\nYes, ’tis sweet to trust in Jesus,\n\nJust from sin and self to cease;\n\nJust from Jesus simply taking\n\nLife and rest, and joy and peace.\n\nI’m so glad I learned to trust Thee,\n\nPrecious Jesus, Savior, Friend;\n\nAnd I know that Thou art with me,\n\nWilt be with me to the end.\n\n5. Amazing Grace\n\nThere’s no way that this list would be complete without including the most easily recognized Christian song on the planet. It’s wonderfully appropriate that “Amazing Grace” would be so well-known the world over—it’s such a perfect picture of God’s relationship with man through Jesus Christ.\n\nThe hymn’s author, John Newton, had basically grown up on the sea and was known for his profanity and coarseness. His mother wanted him to grow up and be a minister, but he rejected her teaching and became a slave trader.\n\nWhen trapped in a storm in the middle of the Atlantic for a week (and he was sure he would die), he had an epiphany and remembered what his mother had taught him. His life began to be transformed. While he didn’t give up slave trading immediately, he eventually realized that it was not compatible with his new faith. He became an ardent and tireless activist against slavery in England.\n\nWhen he became a minister, he would often write hymns to accompany his teaching. One of those was “Amazing Grace,” a heartfelt summation of what true grace looks like. And today, this is one of those hymns that have fallen on many ears over the years.\n\nAmazing grace! How sweet the sound\n\nThat saved a wretch like me!\n\nI once was lost, but now am found;\n\nWas blind, but now I see.\n\n’Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,\n\nAnd grace my fears relieved;\n\nHow precious did that grace appear\n\nThe hour I first believed.\n\nThrough many dangers, toils and snares,\n\nI have already come;\n\n’Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,\n\nAnd grace will lead me home.\n\nThe Lord has promised good to me,\n\nHis Word my hope secures;\n\nHe will my Shield and Portion be,\n\nAs long as life endures.\n\nYea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,\n\nAnd mortal life shall cease,\n\nI shall possess, within the veil,\n\nA life of joy and peace.\n\nThe earth shall soon dissolve like snow,\n\nThe sun forbear to shine;\n\nBut God, who called me here below,\n\nWill be forever mine.\n\nWhen we’ve been there ten thousand years,\n\nBright shining as the sun,\n\nWe’ve no less days to sing God’s praise\n\nThan when we’d first begun.\n\nWorship songs about grace\n\n6. Your Grace Is Enough by Matt Maher\n\nMatt Maher had been reading one of Paul’s epistles and was struck by the description of what Paul described as a “thorn in his side.” (2 Cor. 12:7) Even though Paul asked repeatedly for the Lord to take this ailment away, the Lord wouldn’t and responded “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.”\n\nMaher was struck by the exchange between God and Paul and felt unsure if he really believed that God’s grace was sufficient for him as well. He wrote this song as a responsive scripture reading or prayer.\n\nGreat is your faithfulness oh God\n\nYou wrestle with the sinner’s heart\n\nYou lead us by still waters into mercy\n\nAnd nothing can keep us apart\n\nSo remember your people\n\nRemember your children\n\nRemember your promise, oh God\n\nYour grace is enough.\n\nYour grace is enough.\n\nYour grace is enough.\n\nYour grace is enough for me.\n\n7. Who Am I by Casting Crowns\n\nSongwriter Mark Hall tends to write in his car. One day he was talking to God while driving through Alabama and was struck with the realization that he had no business being so friendly with the God of the universe—and yet, here he was.\n\nEven though this song doesn’t use the word “grace” once, it’s a powerful picture of God’s undeserved goodness to us.\n\nWho am I, that the lord of all the earth\n\nWould care to know my name\n\nWould care to feel my hurt?\n\nWho am I, that the bright and morning star\n\nWould choose to light the way\n\nFor my ever wandering heart?\n\nNot because of who I am\n\nBut because of what you’ve done\n\nNot because of what I’ve done\n\nBut because of who you are\n\nI am a flower quickly fading\n\nHere today and gone tomorrow\n\nA wave tossed in the ocean\n\nA vapor in the wind\n\nStill you hear me when I’m calling\n\nLord, you catch me when I’m falling\n\nAnd you’ve told me who I am\n\nI am yours\n\n8. Grace Flows Down by Christy Nockels\n\nDavid E. Bell, Louie Giglio, and Rod Padgett wrote this deceptively simple little song of worship that became a big hit for worship leaders around the world.\n\nIt begins with a call back to Newton’s famous hymn, and then turns its attention to the crucifixion. The blood that pours from Christ’s hands and feet metaphorically becomes the grace that covers us all.\n\nAmazing grace, how sweet the sound\n\nAmazing love, now flowing down\n\nFrom hands and feet that were nailed to the tree\n\nAs grace flows down and covers me\n\nIt covers me\n\nIt covers me\n\nIt covers me\n\nAnd covers me\n\n9. This Is Amazing Grace by Phil Wickham\n\nWorship leader Phil Wickham and Josh Farro from the band Paramore sat down and wrote a rough version of this hit one afternoon. They recorded a rough demo, but didn’t really think anything of it. Worship leader Jeremy Riddle heard it and asked to rewrite some of the lyrics and “This Is Amazing Grace” was born.\n\nThe verses are a powerful testimony to God’s power and strength. They speak of God’s mightiness, power, and ability to bring chaos into order. These forceful verses are offset by a chorus that considers how this amazingly formidable God would lay down his own life in place of our own.\n\nAmazing grace, indeed.\n\nWho breaks the power of sin and darkness\n\nWhose love is mighty and so much stronger\n\nThe King of Glory the King above all kings\n\nWho shakes the whole earth with holy thunder\n\nWho leaves us breathless in awe and wonder\n\nThe King of Glory the King above all kings\n\nThis is amazing grace\n\nThis is unfailing love\n\nThat You would take my place\n\nThat You would bear my cross\n\nYou laid down Your life\n\nThat I would be set free\n\nOh Jesus I sing for all that You’ve done for me\n\n10. Forever Reign by Hillsong\n\nPaul says in his letter to the Ephesians: “For this reason I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, from whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner man, that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the width and length and depth and height—-to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge; that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.” (Eph. 3:14–19)\n\nSongwriters Reuben Morgan and Jason Ingram struck a friendship over coffee and decided to write some music together. “Forever Reign” was the second song that the two penned based off this passage in Ephesians.\n\nAs Reuban tells it, it’s an extremely confessional song which contrasts God’s goodness with our unworthiness. As God extends His grace to us, he isn’t diminished by us—we are enlarged by him.\n\nYou are good You are good\n\nWhen there’s nothing good in me\n\nYou are love You are love\n\nOn display for all to see\n\nYou are light You are light\n\nWhen the darkness closes in\n\nYou are hope You are hope\n\nYou have covered all my sin\n\nYou are peace You are peace\n\nWhen my fear is crippling\n\nYou are true You are true\n\nEven in my wandering\n\nYou are joy You are joy\n\nYou’re the reason that I sing\n\nYou are life You are life\n\nIn You death has lost its sting\n\nI’m running to Your arms\n\nI’m running to Your arms\n\nThe riches of Your love\n\nWill always be enough\n\nNothing compares to Your embrace\n\nLight of the world forever reign\n\nWhat are your favorite worship songs about grace?\n\nWe’d love to hear from you.
