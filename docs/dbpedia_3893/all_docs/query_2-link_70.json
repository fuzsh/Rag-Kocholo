        "text": "The AMBQ Playlist\n\nThis list of 100+ songs that have a question as the title has long been one of the top three visited pages on this website.\n\nWhen I was writing A More Beautiful Question, or, more accurately when I was procrastinating from writing the book, I began compiling the below list of songs that have questions in the title AND that I like (for the most part). Then four years later, I once again turned to this playlist while researching and writing my follow-up book, The Book of Beautiful Questions.\n\nJudging by my Google analytics, close to 1 million folks around the world have also enjoyed this playlist over the years—in fact, it’s long been one of the top three visited pages on this website.\n\nThis list does not include the many, many songs that may not have a question title but do feature questions prominently in the lyrics. Maybe that’ll be a project for the future.\n\nThanks to all who’ve added to the playlist by sending me more great question song titles over the years. The original list of 50 has now doubled in size!\n\nEnjoy!\n\nMy original annotated list\n\n“What’s so funny ’bout Peace, Love & Understanding?” (Elvis Costello – personal favorite)\n\n“Does anybody really know what time it is?” (Chicago)\n\n“Where have all the flowers gone?” (in honor of the man, Pete Seeger)\n\nMoody Blues – these guys were big-time questioners – “Are you sitting comfortably?” & “Isn’t life strange?” (and the all-time great question song, “Question”—though technically, it doesn’t have a question title).\n\nCreedence Clearwater – believe it or not, they did 2 question songs BOTH about rain! “Who’ll stop the rain?” & “Have you ever seen the rain?”\n\nAnother on the same subject: “Can you stop the rain?” (Peabo Bryson)\n\n“Should I stay or should I go?” (The Clash)\n\n“What’s the frequency Kenneth?” (REM)\n\n“What’s your name?” (Lynyrd Skynyrd)\n\n“Are you experienced?” (Jimi Hendrix)\n\n“Who will save your soul?” (Jewell)\n\n“How can you mend a broken heart?” & “How deep is your love?” (The Bee Gees)\n\n“Have you seen your mother baby?” & “Doncha wanna live with me?” (The Rolling Stones)\n\n“Tell me why?” (Neil Young)\n\n“When will I be loved?” (Linda Ronstadt)\n\n“What is life?” & “Isn’t it a pity?” (George Harrison)\n\n“Where is the love?” (two different songs – Roberta Flack; Black Eyed Peas)\n\n“Where did our love go?” & “Do you know where you’re going to?” (Diana Ross)\n\n“Who let the dogs out?” (by who knows who, and who cares)\n\n“Have you ever loved a woman?” (Eric Clapton)\n\n“Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?” (Bryan Adams)\n\n“Why does it hurt when I pee?” (Frank Zappa)\n\n“Why do fools fall in love?” (Frankie Lymon)\n\n“Do you love me?” (two different songs – Dave Clark Five; Guster)\n\n“Will you still love me tomorrow?” (The Shirelles)\n\n“Do you feel like we do?” (Peter Frampton)\n\n“Do you know what I mean?” (Lee Michaels)\n\n“What’s goin’ on?” (Marvin Gaye)\n\n“Can I get a witness?” (Marvin Gaye)\n\n“Ain’t that peculiar?” (Marvin Gaye.
