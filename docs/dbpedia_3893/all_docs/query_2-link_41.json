Google now offers a simple cure for earworms or stuck song syndrome: You can hum, whistle or sing the tune, even off key, and Google will rustle up a short list of possibilities.\n\nOn your iOS device, open the Google app or find the Google Search widget. Tap the mic icon and say: \"What's this song\" or click the \"Search a song button.\" Then hum for 10 to 15 seconds.\n\nOn Google Assistant, say \"Hey Google, what's this song?\" and then hum it. From there, you can listen to the song on a music app, find the lyrics, get information on the song, artist and more.\n\nHow does it work? Google's machine learning algorithms scan digitized songs to pick out the potential matches.\n\nWhy'd Google create it? Google says it gets asked what song is playing almost 100 million times a month."
