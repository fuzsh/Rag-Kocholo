        "text": "The Bluebird of Happiness\n\nby Edward Heyman\n\nThe beggar man and the mighty king are only diff’rent in name,\n\nFor they are treated just the same by fate.\n\nToday a smile and tomorrow a tear,\n\nWe’re never sure what’s in store,\n\nSo learn your lesson before it is too late, so\n\nBe like I, hold your head up high,\n\nTill you find a bluebird of happiness.\n\nYou will find greater peace of mind\n\nKnowing there’s a bluebird of happiness.\n\nAnd when he sings to you,\n\nThough you’re deep in blue,\n\nYou will see a ray of light creep through,\n\nAnd so remember this, life is no abyss,\n\nSomewhere there’s a bluebird of happiness.\n\n[Recit.]The poet with his pen, the peasant with his plow,\n\nIt makes no difference who you are.\n\nIt’s all the same somehow.\n\nThe king upon his throne, the jester at his feet,\n\nThe artist, the actress, the man on the street,\n\nIt’s a life of smiles, and a life of tears,\n\nIt’s a life of hopes, and a life of fears.\n\nA blinding torrent of rain, and a brilliant burst of sun,\n\nA biting, tearing pain, and bubbling, sparkling fun.\n\nAnd no matter what you have,\n\nDon’t envy those you meet,\n\nIt’s all the same, it’s in the game,\n\nThe bitter and the sweet.\n\nAnd if things don’t look so cheerful,\n\nJust show a little fight,\n\nFor every bit of darkness,\n\nThere’s a little bit of light.\n\nFor every bit of hatred,\n\nThere’s a little bit of love.\n\nFor every cloudy morning, there’s a midnight moon above.\n\nSo don’t you forget,\n\nYou must search ‘til you find the bluebird.\n\nYou will find peace and contentment forever\n\nIf you will—"
