        "text": "Look out Disney! Julia Riew is up next for Playbill's Songwriter Series, which has presented a host of theatrical talent, ranging from the soulful Troy Anthony, to the colorful Anna K. Jacobs. The series is dedicated to spotlighting emerging composers and features a new video every month.\n\nRiew, a winner of the Fred Ebb Award, visited Playbill to perform songs from her distinctive catalog of musicals, which blend her Korean heritage and her painterly approach to melody.\n\nThe featured songs include \"Unforgettable,\" \"She Made Me,\" \"The Greater Good,\" and \"Dive.\" The latter is the title song for her musical Dive, which asks: What would a Korean Disney Princess look like? It went viral on TikTok last year.\n\nRiew is joined in the Songwriter Series video by vocalists Laura Sky Herman, Claire Kwon, and Natalie Choo. The group is accompanied by guitarist Noah Weisbart, as well as pianist and music director Simon Broucke, playing the Playbill piano, provided by the nonprofit Sing for Hope.\n\nTo learn more about Riew and her work, visit JuliaRiew.com."
