        "text": "Mack Brock’s greatest passion is to lead people into a heightened awareness of the presence of God and to see individuals experience the breakthrough God has for them through worship. He has been a worship leader for over 15 years and co-wrote the popular worship favorites “O Come To The Altar,” “Resurrecting,” “Here As In Heaven,” and “Do It Again.\" Today, Mack is releasing his debut solo worship single titled \"Greater Things.\" \"I hope this song encourages you in the trenches,\" he shares. \"I hope it lifts your eyes from the shade to see the bright light of Jesus’s love, kindness, faithfulness. This song is a declaration of that. He is always fighting for you... Even when you know you’re in the middle of the battle. The outcome is already decided.\" \"Greater Things\" is now available on iTunes. Download your copy of the single and be sure to introduce this new song to your worship teams!\n\nRead More"
