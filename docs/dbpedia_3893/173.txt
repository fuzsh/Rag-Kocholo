Greater

Colby and I went to Harvest America this past Sunday night which was live in Dallas and broadcast nationwide. Thanks to some friends, we got awesome seats and got to hear one of our favorite bands live, For King and Country. Mercy Me and Phil Wickham also played.

I posted one of Mercy Me’s songs, The Hurt & the Healer last year. Well recently I have been listening to one of their newer songs, Greater, on repeat. Mercy Me played it live Sunday night and it gave me such a new meaning after seeing the lyrics on screen.

No matter what we face, God is greater. He desires for us to bring our doubts, fears, hurt, tears, shame, guilt, and pain to Him. Our identity isn’t based on any of those things, but based on what He calls us – redeemed. I hope you enjoy this song as much as I have!

Greater

Bring your tired

Bring your shame

Bring your guilt

Bring your pain

Don’t you know that’s not you’re name

You will always be much more to me

Every day I wrestle with the voices

That keep telling me I’m not right

But that’s alright

‘Cause I hear a voice and He calls me redeemed

When others say I’ll never be enough

And greater is the One living inside of me

Than he who is living in the world

In the world

In the world

And greater is the One living inside of me

Than he who is living in the world

Bring your doubts

Bring your fears

Bring your hurt

Bring your tears

There’ll be no condemnation here

You are holy, righteous and redeemed

Every time I fall

There’ll be those who will call me

A mistake

Well that’s ok

There’ll be days I lose the battle

Grace says that it doesn’t matter

‘Cause the cross already won the war

He’s Greater

He’s Greater
