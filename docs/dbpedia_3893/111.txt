I hear the sound Of a greater glory Being released on Earth And it's coming like a fire We desperately desire To burn within our hearts I hear

Kado, this one crazy There's no greater No greater, uh No greater No greater, uh There's no greater love than to lay your life down for one's friends

Jesus is higher Jesus is greater Somebody just lift up your hands and acknowledge the presence of God You are higher than other gods Your name is

Keeper of the day and the night Holder of the sun in the sky You command the waters and the wind There's not one thing You're not greater than Come
