Lais Ribeiro (born in Teresina, Piauí, 1992) is a Brazilian model. In 2009, she started modelling locally and shortly after walked the major international catwalks for such designers as Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Dolce & Gabbana, Versace, and Marc Jacobs. During the fashion week of Brazil for the spring/summer 2011 collections, Ribeiro was the most booked runway model with 27 shows during São Paulo Fashion Week and 26 shows during Rio Fashion Week.

She has been photographed for American Vogue and Vogue Italia, and appeared in ad campaigns for Ralph Lauren, Christian Dior, Tom Ford, GAP and American Eagle.[1] She also works for Victoria’s Secret, appearing in the 2010 and 2011 Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show, as well as the 2011 Christmas commercial and the 2012 Valentine’s Day commercial alongside Candice Swanepoel and Adriana Lima. She was scheduled to walk the 2012 Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show, but sprained her ankle during rehearsals.
