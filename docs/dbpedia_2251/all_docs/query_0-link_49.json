In 1990, Mac's big break came when he won a nationwide comedy search conducted by the Miller Lite Beer company.

She is a scion of the prominent Hilton family, making her an heiress to the global hospitality empire, Hilton Hotels & Resorts, established by her great-grandfather Conrad Hilton. Her parents, Richard Hilton and Kathy Richards, played a significant role in shaping her career aspirations, infusing her formative years with a sense of creativity and business acumen. Nicky Hilton did not rest on the laurels of her familial wealth. Instead, she carved a niche for herself in the world of fashion, launching her own line, \"Nicky Hilton\", in 2004. Her designs were noted for their blend of practicality and style, reflecting her own personal aesthetic. The line proved successful, and she continued to make waves in the industry, releasing a range of handbags for Japanese company Samantha Thavasa, and a jewelry line in collaboration with Titan Brands. Further cementing her reputation as a fashion icon, Hilton published a style guide, 365 Style‚ in 2014.

In 2015, she married James Rothschild, a member of the renowned Rothschild banking family. Together, they have two daughters. Through it all, Nicky Hilton has remained a force to be reckoned with, deftly juggling roles as a designer, author, mother, and entrepreneur.\n\nNeil deGrasse Tyson (; born October 5, 1958) is an American astrophysicist, author, and science communicator.
