        "text": "The 28-year-old officially became an angel in 2015, but she has been no stranger to walking in the well-loved fashion show. She's been in every show from 2010 to 2017, except the 2012 show because she sprained her ankle during rehearsals. Her ensemble that year was given to Behati Prinsloo, who will be joining her on the runway this year after a 3-year hiatus.\n\nOther models who are confirmed to walk the runway this year include, Kendall Jenner, Gigi Hadid, Candice Swanepoel, and Adriana Lima. The show is slated to film on November 8 in New York, but CBS has yet to confirm an air date for fans to watch at home.\n\nThe model was all smiles as she left her fitting. On Instagram, she posted a similar photo with the caption, \"When you know you've got amazing outfits ?. Can’t wait to show you guys #VSFS2018 ?❤️.\""
