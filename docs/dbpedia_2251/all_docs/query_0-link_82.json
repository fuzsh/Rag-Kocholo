        "text": "VICTORIA’S Secret models Taylor Hill, Josephine Skriver and Lais Ribeiro showed why they’re paid the big bucks as they modelled the latest lingerie collection on the beach Miami, Florida.\n\nThe models certainly raised the temperature as they showed off their model curves in the skimpy pieces with Josephine Skriver even shedding her bra to pose in just a pair of black lace knickers.\n\nThe 23-year-old Copenhagen native worked the classic hand-behind-the-head pose as she covered her breasts with her other arm as she was snapped away in the sun.\n\nLater she posed in a skimpy pair of shorts with patchwork hearts on the back and a tiny white vest, before slipping into a sexy white lace bra and kicker set.\n\nMeanwhile her Victoria’s Secret fellow models Lais and Taylor put on equally sexy displays in their garments.\n\nThe pair posed against a wall together with Lais, 26, wearing a light blue set and Taylor, 20, in white.\n\nLais was later seen proving that she could even make a palm tree look sexy as she posed by that, while Taylor slipped into a dark blue set to show off her model curves.\n\nThe Victoria’s Secret ladies often prove their far more than gorgeous faces, for instance Josephine is a huge advocate of LGTBQ both her parents are openly gay and conceived her and her younger brother, Oliver, through a series of IVF treatments.\n\nShe told ID: \"When people look at me and know that I'm an IVF kid, I hope they see a person, a human being, just like anyone else. You get so many, 'She's not made the natural way, she shouldn't even be here,' but I am not a science experiment, I am not synthetic, I am just as real as you are.\"\n\n\"My upbringing was a little different from other people. I have a mom who is gay and it's not as easy to all of a sudden get pregnant. But ever since she was a kid, she wanted to be a mom. So in Denmark in 1992, there was this newsletter for the whole LGBTQ community and my mom put an ad in there saying 'I want to bring a child into this world, does anyone want to be a part of that?'\" She got a few replies and the first one ended up being my dad.\"\n\n\"Nine months later, I was out.\"\n\n\"My dad, at that time, was about to get married to his husband. I didn't like the term 'step mom' or 'step dad' because it always felt like something bad from the Disney movies. So we came up with our own term and called it 'Bonus Mom.'\""
