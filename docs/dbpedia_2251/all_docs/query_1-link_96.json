        "text": "BRAZILIAN model Lais Ribeiro is so busy she could be excused a little flagging.\n\nBut the 29-year-old stood firm and kept standards up in a shoot in Malibu, California.\n\nThe Victoria’s Secret beauty, who has a son of 12, showed her 2.2 million Instagram followers how she cools down with an ice bath.\n\nWell, she rarely gets to chill out . . .\n\nJust like her fellow Angel Alessandra Ambrosio, Lais came from humble beginnings. The runway regular, who was born in Teresina, a remote rural town in Brazil, never considered becoming a model until she was 18-years-old.\n\nAfter she gave birth to her son Alexandre eight years ago, one of Lais’ friends asked her if she’d ever considered working in the fashion industry.\n\nRemarkably, the model was rejected by a number of different agencies who had her handing out flyers because she wasn’t deemed curvy enough.\n\nIt wasn’t until Lais won a modelling competition in Brazil that her career finally took off.She showed-off major design labels on the runway in 2010, including Chanel, Louis Vuitton and Versace.\n\nAt Fashion Week in Brazil, the 5’11’’ Victoria’s Secret stunner impressed casting agents so much that she was booked for over FIFTY shows.\n\nShe starred in a record-breaking 27 shows in Sao Paulo and 26 in Rio."
