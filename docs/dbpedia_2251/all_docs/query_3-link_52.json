        "text": "Lais wasn’t the only one walking down the aisle in custom Galia Lahav, however. Lais’ bridesmaids, including fellow models Jasmine Tookes and Sara Sampaio, were each wearing a custom Galia Lahav silk pale-gold dress that perfectly complimented the ceremony’s aesthetic. In order to ensure that these dresses turned out exactly as hoped and fit each bridesmaid perfectly, head designer Sharon Sever, Lais, and her stylist Philippe Uter worked tirelessly to create a design that would compliment each woman perfectly. As each bridesmaid walked down the aisle, the excitement in the air grew and the energy was absolutely contagious as the sun set in the background.\n\nWhen we began our journey with Lais for her dream wedding gown, we first and foremost knew that this dress had to embody her incredible personality as well as her unique elegance. In order to accomplish this, Sharon Sever met with Lais in order to properly understand her vision before beginning the design process. Over the course of several months, Sharon and Lais went over various sketches, fabrics, and styles until they found the perfect design for her dream day. The attention to detail was so meticulous that Philippe Uter flew to our headquarters in order to pick the final fabric choice in person. After all of this exciting work, you can imagine our happiness here at Galia Lahav after seeing how Lais’ day came together so wonderfully.\n\nWe have been honored to have the special relationship with Lais that we do – from her first time wearing Galia Lahav at the 2020 AMFAR Gala, to adding that dress and naming it after her in the collection following, to working so closely with her to bring her wedding dreams to life – Lais will forever have a special place in our heart and we are so happy to have received the opportunity to dress both her and her bridesmaids for the special day she so deserves."
