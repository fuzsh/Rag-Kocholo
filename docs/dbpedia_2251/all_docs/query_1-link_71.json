        "text": "Lais Ribeiro just hit the supermodel jackpot: The Brazilian beauty was selected to wear a $2 million Fantasy Bra at this year’s Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show.\n\nSign Up For Our Daily Newsletter\n\nThank you for signing up!\n\nBy clicking submit, you agree to our <a href=\"http://observermedia.com/terms\">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime.\n\nSee all of our newsletters\n\nThe Champagne Nights Fantasy Bra was designed by Mouawad, a Swiss and Emirati jeweler, and features more than 6,000 precious stones, tallying up to 600 carats. Featuring a mix of diamonds, yellow sapphires and blue topaz, all hand set in 18 karat gold, this over-the-top piece of lingerie took 350 hours to create.\n\nNaturally, Ribeiro is honored to be wearing this bejeweled bra. “I never cried so much in my entire life — and I have a baby,” she told People. “It was so emotional. I couldn’t believe it when they told me. It was so beautiful.”\n\nIf you’re unfamiliar with this 27-year-old catwalker, get to know her before the VS show takes place in Shanghai on November 28.\n\nShe never thought she’d be a model.\n\nDespite landing a huge role in this year’s VS show, modeling wasn’t always a goal of Ribeiro’s.\n\n“I was supposed to be a nurse, but when I was introduced to modeling it changed. I was like, ‘I want to be a Victoria’s Secret model,’ Who doesn’t wanna be?” she told People.\n\nShe’s had a major TV cameo.\n\nAccording to IMDB, Ribeiro made an appearance on New Girl, in season three. It was the same episode where Prince was also a guest star.\n\nThis isn’t her first time on the VS runway.\n\nThe model has already walked in five previous Victoria's Secret (VSCO) Fashion Shows, starting in 2010. Ribeiro sat out the show in 2012, but has been a runway mainstay ever since.\n\nRibeiro is a mom.\n\nIn 2008, at the age of 18, Ribeiro gave birth to her son, Alexandre Ribeiro. She recently snapped a pic of him, when she was sending him off to his first day of fourth grade.\n\nThe model is dating a professional basketball player.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BVPv0p9gdSU/?hl=en&taken-by=laisribeiro\n\nRibeiro has been dating Jared Homan—who last played for Maccabi Aashdod of the Israeli Premier League—since 2015. He posted the sweetest congratulatory Instagram post for the model, following the announcement that she would be wearing the Fantasy Bra.\n\nHe wrote: “Years of hard work and honing your craft has paid off. So well deserved as you are the anchor of support to so many people and have stayed true to yourself on this journey.”\n\nShe’s friends with VS regulars Jasmine Tookes and Adriana Lima.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BW_OKU6AQTs/?taken-by=laisribeiro\n\nLast year, Tookes wore the $3 million Fantasy Bra, so hopefully, she can pass on some helpful tips to Ribeiro.\n\nOf her friendship with Lima, Ribeiro said: “She is always helping and such an example and inspiration to all the young girls. She was just open to me and we became friends. I was very happy for that.”"
