        "text": "She’s walked the catwalk for the likes of Chanel, Louis Vuitton and Marc Jacobs – but Lais Riberio has been living the high life since earning her ‘wings’ last year.\n\nThe Brazilian model, who has an eight-year-old son named Alexandre, was named one of Victoria’s Secret’ s new Angels last summer joining the likes of Alessandra Ambrosio, Lily Aldridge and Lily Donaldson .\n\nBut just exactly who is the new favourite on the catwalk?\n\nThe 5’11” stunner became a model when she was an 18-year-old single mum after winning a national competition and moving to New York, despite barley speaking a word of English.\n\nAfter making her runway debut at Rag and Bone’s Autumn/Winter 2010 show during New York Fashion Week, Lais was soon strutting her stuff at Gucci. Dolce & Gabbana and Versace.\n\nShe’s appeared in every Victoria's Secret Fashion Show since 2010, apart from when she was a no show in 2012 after spraining her ankle.\n\nBut no Angel would be complete without a famous partner on their arm, which Lais has taken care of after hooking up with professional basketball player, Jared Homan.\n\nHoman’s Instagram may be set to private but we still get a glimpse of their romantic dates thanks to Lais, who regularly posts photos of her man and their cute couple posts.\n\nHowever, the relationship is being conducted over long distance as Iowa-born Jared now plays for Eskişehir Basket in the Turkish Basketball League (TBL), as a power forward.\n\nAfter becoming an official Angel last April, Lais gushed about how the lingerie brand has helped foster her career.\n\n“VS has supported me from the beginning. They have instilled confidence, hope, and a strong business sense,” she told Us Weekly.\n\n“When you work this closely with a brand you get a chance to understand a completely different side of the business; it's inspired me to look at my opportunity differently.”\n\nAnd just how does she keep her up model physique in top condition? She plays volleyball, football, and does a lot of running after her son, of course.\n\n“I am constantly changing my exercise routines. It can be anything from boxing to yoga,” Lais explained. “But I also have a son, and keeping up with him is a workout.”\n\nIn addition to her success on the runway and work with Victoria's Secret, Lais has appeared in numerous ad campaigns for famous designers and retail giants such as Ralph Lauren, Tom Ford, Gap and American Eagle."
