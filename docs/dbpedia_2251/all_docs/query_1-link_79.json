        "text": "The event – filmed for television and to be broadcast in the United States on CBS on November 28 – is considered one of the most prestigious gigs for a model.\n\nGaining your “Angel wings” – intricately designed pairs of wings given to the most highly regarded models in the show – is a whole other privilege.\n\n“Getting your Angel wings is the ultimate.”\n\nBest friends Gigi Hadid and Kendall Jenner were among the models to earn their wings on stage at the 2016 show.\n\nWhile being in the show, or getting their wings are honours in themselves, the money doesn’t hurt either. Nine of the models who appeared in last year’s show appeared on Forbes’ list of the world’s 20 highest-paid models in 2016.\n\nHere we take a look at the highest-paid Victoria’s Secret models who took part in last year’s show, with them ranked in ascending order by their estimated 2016 earnings – based on their income from all modelling contracts, both from Victoria Secret as well as other companies – according to Forbes.\n\n9. Taylor Hill – US$4 million\n\nAmerican Taylor Hill, the 21-year-old “girl next door from Colorado”, and Vogue magazine cover star, became the face of Topshop’s autumn-winter 2016 campaign in July 2016.\n\nSince then number of followers of her Instagram account, @taylor_hill, has doubled to 9.2 million.\n\nHill took part in her first VS show in 2014 and became an Angel a year later.\n\n8. Jasmines Tookes – US$4 million\n\nThe 26-year-old model gained her wings in 2015, after first taking part in a Victoria’s Secret show in 2012.\n\n7. Lily Aldridge – US$4 million\n\nThe 32-year-old model’s favourite place in the world is her hometown of Nashville, Tennessee, according to her VS profile. Her Instagram account has 5.1 million followers.\n\n6. Joan Smalls – US$4.5 million\n\nThe 29-year-old model first took part in a VS show in 2011 and has since appeared on five other occasions.\n\nShe has a net worth of US$16 million according to the Daily Mail, and 2.5 million Instagram followers.\n\n5. Alessandra Ambrosio – US$5 million\n\nThe 36-year-old model had been one of the show’s veterans.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, her net worth is in the region of US$60 million.\n\nHer Instagram account has 8.7 million followers.\n\nAmbrosio’s favourite places to visit are Bali, in Indonesia, and the Brazilian party city of Florianopolis.\n\n4. Liu Wen – US$7 million\n\nThe 29-year-old model became the first Asian model to take to the Angels runway in 2009.\n\nShe is also one of the three women of colour – all of whom walked in the 2016 VS show – to make Forbes’ list. Liu has 3.4 million Instagram followers.\n\n3. Gigi Hadid – US$9 million\n\nShe took part in her first Victoria’s Secret show in 2015 and was voted runner-up as Model of the Year 2016 by Models.com readers.\n\n2. Kendall Jenner – US$10 million\n\nShe has 84.7 million Instagram followers, and first took to the Victoria’s Secret runway in 2015. She is also a brand ambassador for Estée Lauder.\n\n1. Adriana Lima – US$10.5 million\n\nLima took part in her first Angel show in 1999 and is worth an estimated US$75 million, according to the Daily Mail. The 36-year-old model has 11.3 million followers on her Instagram account."
