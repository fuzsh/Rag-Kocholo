Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRibeiro was born in Brazil.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to The Daily Mail, she barely spoke English when she first started modeling.\n\nSource: The Daily Mail\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen she was just 18, she gave birth to her son, Alexandre. Now he's pretty grown up. She posts Instagram photos of him frequently.\n\nSource: The Daily Mail\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis name is tattooed on the back of her neck.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe was discovered at a competition in Brazil.\n\nSource: The Daily Mail\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe then moved to New York to pursue modeling, and she made her big runway debut at the fall 2010 Rag & Bone show.\n\nSource: The Daily Mail\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, she's still managed to have an explosive career in Brazil. She was the most booked model during Brazil's summer 2011 Sao Paulo Fashion Week, notes Mashable.\n\nSource: Mashable\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Mashable, Ribeiro was supposed to make her big debut on the Victoria's Secret runway in 2012 — but she sprained her ankle.\n\nSource: Mashable\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2013, however, she did get to walk the runway for Victoria's Secret. Here she is backstage at the iconic runway show.\n\nAnd, of course, she stunned on the runway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe appeared in the outrageous 2014 Victoria's Secret fashion show, as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe took a requisite backstage selfie, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe has appeared on international magazine covers, such as Elle Italy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer résumé is impressive — she's walked the runway for many major designers, such as Ralph Lauren, Elie Saab, Diane von Furstenberg, Oscar de la Renta, and more.\n\nSource: Fashion Model Directory\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe was psyched when she landed the gig as an Angel this past April. \"Anything I'll say will completely downplay how incredibly excited and honored I am to be representing this iconic brand,\" she said to Us Weekly.\n\nSource: Us Weekly\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen she landed the dream gig, she wrote on Instagram that her dreams had come true.\n\nSource: Instagram\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut when she's not busy being a supermodel, she's busy spending time with her son.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's clear from her Instagram that they spend a lot of quality time together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, she joked to Us Weekly that, \"I also have a 7-year-old son, and keeping up with him is a workout!\"\n\nSource: Us Weekly\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, she works out a lot to stay in tip-top shape as an Angel. \"I am constantly changing my exercise routines. It can be anything from boxing to yoga,\" she said to Us Weekly.\n\nSource: Us Weekly\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn her downtime, she also spends time with her boyfriend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe's a family person, too. Here's a family photo with her mother and her son that she posted on Instagram on Mother's Day in 2014.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe's pretty normal, though. Her Instagram shows her playing the popular and hilariously crass game Cards Against Humanity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJudging by her Instagram, she likes to have a good time, like any girl in her 20s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe participated in her friend's wedding in June.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe also told Us Weekly that she looks up to two other very successful Brazilian models — both of whom have also worked for Victoria's Secret: Gisele Bundchen and Adriana Lima.\n\nSource: Us Weekly\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor now, she's grateful for the career she has. \"VS has supported me from the beginning. They have instilled confidence, hope, and a strong business sense,\" she said to Us Weekly. \"When you work this closely with a brand you get a chance to understand a completely different side of the business; it's inspired me to look at my opportunity differently.\"\n\nSource: Us Weekly\n\nRead next\n\nSign up to get the inside scoop on today’s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business — delivered daily.
