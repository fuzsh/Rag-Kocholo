        "text": "MODEL Lais Ribeiro has her latest Sports Illustrated photoshoot all tied up.\n\nThe Brazilian star posed in a pink bikini top and briefs, knotted at the side, for the famous swimsuit edition of the magazine which is on sale now.\n\nLais, 30, celebrated her fourth outing in the edition at a party in Hollywood with her basketball star fiancé Joakim Noah, 36.\n\nThe couple, who started dating in 2018, got engaged at Burning Man Festival the following year.\n\nLais has featured on campaigns for Victoria's Secret since 2010.\n\nNot only did she star in the 2011 Christmas advert, she also promoted the 2012 Valentine’s Day collection with supermodels Candice Swanepoel and Adriana Lima.\n\nAfter spraining her ankle during the rehearsals for the 2012 Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show, Lais had no option but to step down from the role.\n\nTo make up for her injury, the iconic lingerie company cast her in the Birds of Paradise segment the following year.\n\nFollowing her extensive contribution to the brand, she was finally made a Victoria’s Secret Angel in 2015.\n\nJust like her fellow Angel Alessandra Ambrosio, Lais came from humble beginnings.\n\nThe runway regular, who was born in Teresina, a remote rural town in Brazil, never considered becoming a model until she was 18-years-old.\n\nAfter she gave birth her son Alexandre eight years ago, one of Lais’ friends asked her if she’d ever considered working in the fashion industry.\n\nRemarkably, the model was rejected by a number of different agencies who had her handing out flyers because she wasn’t deemed curvy enough."
