Every day, our guests are led through the trees by our wonderful staff: the Sky Rangers. They are the canopy tour guides that take care of you throughout the day and send you from platform to platform. The guests never have to worry about touching or adjusting their top-of-the-line Petzl equipment because that is all taken care of for you…rember, don’t touch the green button! (…you’ll figure out what I mean when you get here)

Each Sky Ranger is trained in CPR, First Aid, and has gone through a 40-hour First Responder course adapted for the wilderness environment. They are extensively trained in all of Soaring’s safety protocols to ensure the well-being of all, both guests and staff. Safety is a top priority, and there is never any compromise.

The Sky Rangers do a great job of making each and every day special. You never have to worry about a thing, because they’ve got it all taken care of!
