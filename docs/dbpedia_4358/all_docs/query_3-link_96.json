It takes being separated in the wild and overcoming nature’s obstacles for them both to realize they just might not be meant for each other ... while finding new love in surprising places.",

        "text": "**This review is contributed by Super Channel—a channel dedicated to providing integrity and accountability in today’s entertainment.\n\nShot in the beautiful state of Utah, with amazing panoramic scenes of mountains, night and daybreak skies, waterfalls, streams, wildlife, and wilderness terrain, this entertaining movie is highlighted by beautiful music throughout. A love story with a 180-degree twist-ending, as two couples discover where their hearts really lie and with whom.\n\nJoey (Jake Stormoen), internet influencer, is so excited about whisking his lovely girlfriend Claire (Danielle C. Ryan) into the wilderness and away from her busy schedule. While attempting to take a photo, Claire falls over the edge of the cliff into the mountain stream far below. Unable to reach her, and tumbling down the mountainside himself, Joey and Claire are separated from each other and in danger. As they both struggle in the forest Natalie (Melanie Stone), Forest Ranger, finds Joey flat on his back and injured, but safe. Claire finds herself in the middle of the forest, in darkness, and the sound of wildlife prompts her to scramble up a tree.\n\nWhen Claire’s ground rescuer on horseback arrives and it’s Colt McCoy (Trevor Donovan) an old flame, she refuses to come down, and wants nothing to do with him. As he climbs the tree to get to her, he slips and falls, hurts his back, and his SAR radio is in pieces.\n\nBoth couples struggle with rainstorms and cool night weather in the wilderness, while getting to know each other. Joey is impressed with Natalie’s knowledge of nature and how much they have in common, and Claire has no choice but to huddle under a blanket with Colt in the cool night air.\n\nClaire continues to agitate about having to be at work on Monday … Colt tries to draw her attention to the beauty of nature around her, finally making Claire think … has her vision been clouded by the drive for success? Colt and Claire reminisce and wonder what happened to them, as Joey and Natalie encourage each other to follow their dreams. True love is about to pop up in the most exciting way! Dove-approved for all ages.\n\nThe Dove Take:\n\nA thoughtful movie that brings to light the importance of allowing second chances, and of embracing the support of caring people in your life."
