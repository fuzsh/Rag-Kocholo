        "text": "I like cavalry and Indians movies and am thinking of writing a book about the fictional history of the Indian wars in the wild west of imagination.\n\nOne necessary task would be to put movies in the correct fictional order.\n\nThat is easy when the movies state their fictional dates.\n\nFor example Pillars of the Sky 1956 has a stated fictional date of 1868, even though the historical events it is loosely based on happened ten years earlier in 1858. And Kamiakin was not killed in 1858 or 1868 but died in 1877.\n\nOther movies give clues about their dates.\n\nFor example Rio Grande 1950 was fifteen years after the devastation of the Shenandoah Valley in October 1864 and thus should happen sometime in the period of October 1869 to October 1880.\n\nStagecoach 1939 includes the following dialog:\n\nEd (editor): McCoy! Billy, kill that story about the Republican Convention in Chicago and take this down: \"The Ringo Kid was killed on Main Street in Lordsburg tonight. And among the additional dead were...\" Leave that blank for a spell.\n\nMcCoy, typesetter: I didn't hear any shootin', Ed.\n\nEd (editor): You will, Billy, you will.\n\nStagecoach (1939) - Quotes - IMDb\n\nRepublican national conventions in Chicago happened 19-18 May 1860, 20-21 May 1868, 2-8 June 1880, 3-6 June 1884, 19-25 June 1888, and again in 1904, 1908, 1912, 1916, and 1920. Two stagecoach passengers fought in the Civil War, making the only reasonable choices 1868, 1880, 1884, and 1888.\n\nThe Apache outbreak most likely to be referred to as Geronimo leaving the reservation was in 1885. Of course the fictional movie Geronimo(s) left the reservation almost as often as the Joker leaves prison.\n\nAnother way to tell the fictional date of a movie is the number of stars in United States flags. They can be compared to the dates those numbers of stars were official. Of course the goofs section in IMDb has a bunch of goofs stating that the flags have the wrong number of stars for the dates of the movies.\n\nAnother thing I look for is what military units are involved. Sometimes that is mentioned and sometimes there are visual clues.\n\nFor example, each troop or company of cavalry carried a fork tailed flag called a guidon.\n\nAccording to the 1833 regulations, a guidon was divided horizontally, red above and white below, with the white letters U.S. in the red part and the red letter of the company in the white part. In 1862 the design was changed to a fork tailed US flag, with the stars usually arranged in concentric circles. In 1883 the design was changed to horizontal red over white, with the regimental number in white above and the company letter in red below.\n\nMany movies use the stars and stripes guidons, but most used variations of the red over white guidons. Some have U.S. in the upper part, some have the regimental number, some have crossed sabers, some may have other symbols, and some may be blank. Some have the company letter in the lower part, others may have U.S. or the regimental number, or crossed sabers, or other symbols, or be blank.\n\nSo I look for the designs of guidons when watching cavalry movies.\n\nSome movie cavalrymen have crossed saber insignia on their hats or caps. And sometimes it has regimental numbers and/or company letters as well. For example the cavalry in Last of the Comanches 1953 set in August 1876 wear insignia of company G 14th Cavalry on their hats.\n\nIt is often said that John Ford used the 7th Cavalry a lot in his movies like Stagecoach 1939, Fort Apache 1948, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon 1949, Rio Grande 1950, The Searchers1956, The Horse Soldiers 1959, Sergeant Rutledge1960, Two Rode Together 1961, and Cheyenne Autumn 1964, but I doubt it.\n\nIt is said that the 7th Cavalry rescues the protagonists in Stagecoach 1939. Look at this still:\n\nIt looks sort of like the number 7 in the bottom half of the guidon. But this is the back or reverse side of the guidon. The front or obverse side of a flag is always shown with the staff to the left. So this is actually a guidon of company F of the Sixth Cavalry.\n\nI haven't seen any visual indication of the regiment in Fort Apache.\n\nIn She Wore a Yellow Ribbon set at Fictional Fort Starke on the southern plains in late 1876, several persons wear caps with the number 2, as seen in these photos.\n\nIn Rio Grande Patrick Wayne as a soldier's child wears a cap with a 7.\n\nBut several of the characters who portray soldiers wear caps with the number 2.\n\nThis still indicates that the Ninth Cavalry is the regiment in Sergeant Rutledge\n\nChuck Hayward\n\nAnd Wikipedia says the Ninth Cavalry.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_Rutledge\n\nAnyway, you won't find any African Americans in the Seventh Cavalry in any westerns I ever saw.\n\nIn Cheyenne Autumn several stills indicate that the guidon has no markings:\n\nBen Johnson - Page 94 - The Silver Screen Oasis\n\nThus the idea that John Ford often depicted the Seventh Cavalry seems doubtful.\n\nIf anyone wants to post any \"facts\" from the \"history\" of wild west movies go ahead.\n\nList of Cavalry vs Indian movies by fictional date.\n\nAll movies here the cavalry were their usual western style uniforms should be set in fictional dates after the fictional adoption of that style and before the fictional replacement of that uniform style.\n\nSeminole [1953] set in the Second Seminole War in Florida, with a fictional date of 1835 according to Wikipedia. The soldiers wear older style uniforms not seen in Cavalry & Indian westerns.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminole_(film)\n\nDistant Drums [1951] is set in 1840 according to Wikipedia - the Second Seminole War is still dragging on. The soldiers wear uniforms much more like typical cavalry uniforms in western movies.\n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=distant+drums+movie&newwindow=1&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj9_pHVqp7VAhXD7D4KHb3LD0IQ_AUICygC&biw=1138&bih=768&dpr=1.13#imgrc=_\n\nThus the change to Civil War era and western era uniforms should fictionally begin between 1835 and 1840.\n\nThe Oregon Trail [1959] involves a wagon train to Oregon in 1846 according to IMDB. The Oregon Trail (1959) - IMDb\n\nAnd the soldiers already dress like typical western movie cavalry.\n\nIn Santa Fe Trail [1940] soldiers wear caps from the Mexican War era of 1846-48. The film is set in 1854-1859.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe_Trail_(film)\n\nThey Came to Cordura [1959] happens in the pursuit of Pancho Villa in 1916.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/They_Came_to_Cordura\n\nThe soldiers wear khaki colored uniforms.\n\nThus movies where cavalry wear the familiar western cavalry uniforms should happen between 1835 at the very earliest and 1916 at the very latest.\n\n1846: The Oregon Trail [1959] A wagon train travels to Oregon in 1846 according to IMDB. Indians attack at Fort Laramie.The Oregon Trail (1959) - IMDb\n\n1862-1865. Apache Ambush [1955]. On April 14, 1865, it is mentioned that the Army of the Southwest under General Crook - or Cooke, or Hook - has being fighting Apaches constantly for three years. One would think that if the Army of the Southwest was as large as the typical Union army they would have run out of hostile Apaches by then, but movie Apaches were far more numerous and hostile than real Apaches.\n\n1865, April 14, Abraham Lincoln is shot by John Wilkes Booth at Ford's Theater and dies on April 15. Real History.\n\n1865. Cavalry [1936] On or before April 14, President Lincoln sends Captain Ted Thorne west to protect the vital telegraph line being built to an unspecified territory. Thorn goes undercover in a wagon train. Horace Leeds is plotting to form his own independent nation, having learned nothing from the failure of Jefferson Davis and his 500,000 man army I guess, and incites the local Indians to attack the telegraph crews and the wagon trains.\n\n1865. April 14. Apache Ambush [1955] Abraham Lincoln sends ex soldiers James Kingston and Tim O'Roarke to Texas to drive a herd of cattle up north to fed a hungry nation. Dialog reveals that one of them has served in the Army of the Southwest for three years under General Crook - or Cooke, or Hook - facing Apaches morning, noon and night.\n\n1865. April 14. The Plainsman [1936] Abraham Lincoln says that the settlers in the west must be protected, goes to the theater, and is shot. Armaments manufacturers led by Van Ellyn facing loss of demand for their product - due to the shocking outbreak of peace - plot to sell repeating rifles to the Indians out west. Their agent, John Lattimer, is sent west.\n\n1865. Later. Apache Ambush [1955] Kingston and O'Roarke reach San Arturo on the Texas-New mexico border, commanded by Union Colonel Marshall. Ex confederates, banditos, and Apaches are after an illegal shipment of 100 rifles. Mexican banditos and Apaches join forces to attack the cattle drive.\n\n1865. Later. The Plainsman [1936] Wild Bill Hickok, Buffalo Bill Cody, and Cody's pregnant wife Louisa travel to Hayes City, Kansas in a stage driven by Calamity Jane. They find Breezy, the scout of Colonel Carrington at Fort Piney, with shocking news.\n\n1865. Later. The Plainsman [1936] Hickok tells General George A. Custer at Fort Hayes that half the garrison of Fort Piney has been killed by the Sioux. Colonel Carrington urgently needs a lot more ammunition to save the Fort. General Custer tells Hickock to look for Cheyenne leader Yellow Hand and sends Captain Wood with a troop to escort the ammunition, guided by Buffalo Bill.\n\n1865. Later. The Plainsman [1936] Captured by Yellow Hand, Calamity Jane reveals which way the ammunition is going to save Hickok. Yellow Hand releases Calamity Jane and Hickok. Hickok sends Calamity to tell General Custer and joins the ammunition train as it is attacked. Besieged for days on an island in a river, what is left of the cavalry troop is rescued by Custer and the 7th cavalry.\n\n1865. Later. The Plainsman [1936] At Hayes City Hickok kills three cavalry deserters while trying to get the gun runner John Latimer. Custer sends Buffalo Bill to find Hickok while the 7th cavalry rides north to fight the Sioux.\n\n1865. Later. The Plainsman [1936]. Wild Bill Hickok and Buffalo Bill learn of Custer's Last Stand from a Sioux.\n\n1865. Later. The Plainsman [1936]. In the last scene Wild Bill Hickock is shot by Jack McCall at Deadwood South Dakota holding the Dead Man's hand. At the same time, Buffalo Bill leads the Fifth Cavalry under General Merritt into Deadwood en route to reinforce General Crook.\n\nThe events in The Plainsman [1936] seem to take just weeks or months but stretch from April 14 1865 to August 2, 1876 in real history. The prologue says that many lives and many events were combined into the plot.\n\nFall 1867. The Halleluhah Trail [1965]. The Peace Commission of 1867 has brought most Indians to the reservations. At a meeting on 4 November, citizens of Denver, fearing a long winter and a whiskey shortage, arrange for a massive shipment of 40 wagons full of whiskey. Several groups take interest in the shipment, including Sioux warriors under Five Barrels and Walks-Stooped-Over and two detachments of cavalry from Fort Russell under Captain Paul Slater and Colonel Thaddeus Gearhart. Thus leading to events like the Battle of Whiskey Hills and the disaster at Quicksand Bottoms.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hallelujah_Trail\n\n1868. 40 Guns to Apache Pass [1967] Cochise and his Apaches are on the warpath in Arizona. Colonel Homer E. Reed is local commander at Apache Wells. Captain Coburn, Cochise, and army deserters struggle over a shipment of 40 rifles.\n\n1870. Broken Arrow [1950] Cochise and his Apaches have been at war for 10 years and thus since about 1860. Tom Jeffords makes a personal peace with Cochise. General Howard makes a peace treaty with Cochise. with the help of Jeffords. Cochise banishes the hostile Geronimo. Jefford's Apache wife is murdered and Jeffords leaves.\n\n12 October 1872. Cochise makes peace treaty with General Howard. Chircahuas have reservation in their own land, with Tom Jeffords as their Indian Agent. Real history.\n\n1872. The opening narration of Taza Son of Cochise [1954] says that Cochise made his peace treaty with General Howard in 1872.\n\nEarly 1874. Cochise dies. His son Taza (1842-1876) becomes chief. Real history.\n\nEarly 1870s? Broken Arrow TV series [1956-58]. Cochise lives on reservation with Tom Jeffords as agent. It is unknown whether the fictional dates of the series have anything to do with the historical dates.\n\n1875. Taza Son of Cochise [1954] Cochise makes peace treaty with General Howard in 1872 and dies three years later, about 1875. Taza becomes chief. Soon after several Apaches kill white people and the Chiricahuas have to move to the San Carlos Reservation. As part of his tough negotiating tactics with Brigadier General Crook, Taza captures Fort Apache from Captain Burnett.\n\nWe may suppose that the regiment of Fort Apache [1948] and the 101st cavalry of The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin [1954-59] were stationed at Fort Apache before and/or after Captain Burnett and his unit.\n\nAt the San Carlos reservation Taza establishes an Indian Police force to administer Justice. The Sixth Cavalry captures Geronimo and brings him and his people to San Carlos. Geronimo, the idol of many Apaches, plots with Taza's brother Naiche for an uprising. After battles, Geronimo is exiled to the east at Taza's suggestion. But he manages to return somehow for later movies.\n\nJune 25-26 1876. Battle of Little Big Horn. Custer's Last Stand 25 June 1876. History. No doubt the dates are given in several movies.\n\n7th Cavalry [1956] Captain Benson, C Troop 7th Cavalry returns to Fort Abraham Lincoln after getting married and hears of the Little Big Horn. Major Reno and Captain Benteen and their surviving men return to the fort. An inquiry is held into the battle. Captain Benson volunteers for a suicide mission to recover the bodies of the slain officers.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7th_Cavalry_(film)\n\n1876 August 2. Wild Bill Hickok is shot by Jack McCall at Deadwood South Dakota holding the Dead Man's hand. Real history.\n\n1876. After 25 June. The Plainsman [1936]. Wild Bill Hickok and Buffalo Bill learn of Custer's Last Stand from a Sioux.\n\n1876. After 25 June. The Plainsman [1936]. In the last scene Wild Bill Hickock is shot by Jack McCall at Deadwood South Dakota holding the Dead Man's hand. At the same time, Buffalo Bill leads the Fifth Cavalry under General Merritt into Deadwood en route to reinforce General Crook.\n\nThe events in The Plainsman [1936] seem to take just weeks or months but stretch from April 14 1865 to August 2, 1876 in real history. The prologue says that many lives and many events were combined into the plot.\n\nThursday 3 September to Saturday 5 September, 1876. A Ticket to Tomahawk Arapahos under Crooked Knife (who has 7th Cavalry flags at his tepee) make trouble for the railroad struggling to gets its first train from Epitaph to Tomahawk, Colorado, and later help it.\n\n1878. Ambush [1950] Mary Caryle captured by Apaches in Arizona under Diabito. Scout Ward Kinsman and Captain Ben Lorrison set out to rescue her and stop Diablito.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambush_(1950_film)\n\n1879. Apache Rifles [1964] Victorio and the Mescalero Apaches are on the warpath in Arizona.\n\nCaptain Stanton returns them to the reservation and guards it against white intrusions. Scheming white men have Captain Stanton replaced by Major Perry.\n\nApache Rifles (1964) - IMDb\n\nLonesome Dove\n\nAngus Mc Crae - Probably born 1823\n\nWoodrow Call - Probably born 1823\n\nServed in Texas Rangers in an ill fated expition to find a rout form Sanatonio to El Paso. Fighting Buffalo Hump - a historical Comanche warrior. Of course Buffalo Hump was a common Indian name.\n\nI think that Blue Duck was also based on a real person.\n\nWhat I noticed watching Lonesome Dove was that Gus was attacked by Indians and fatally wounded by an arrow and died in Miles City, Montana.\n\nThe Great Sioux War ended in the spring of 1877 as the Sioux , Cheyenne and Arapahoe came in to the reservations or went to exile in Canada. The Nez Perce came through Montana in the summer of 1877 but didn't get close to Miles City. After that the chances of getting killed by hostile Indians in Montana really dropped, and most Indians were using rifles more and more instead of bows.\n\nMiles City was founded in the spring of 1877, thus leaving only a small overlap between hostile Indians in Montana and the existence of Miles City. And Miles City in the miniseries looked rather better established than it should have looked in 1877.\n\nI wonder what dates may have been given in the miniseries and the original novel.\n\nKid Sheleen - probably born 1858\n\nFrank Sheleen was a Wyoming family uprooted by the Union Pacific - so that puts him at least 1867 when the UP reached Wyoming\n\nProfessor Sam The Shade, The Sunrise Kid: [opening scene, singing] Well now friends. Just lend an ear, for you're now about to hear. The Ballad of Cat Ballou. It's a song that's newly made. And Professor Samuel Shade, and the Sunrise Kid are singing it for you. Cat Ballou-u-u. Cat Ballou-u-u. Cat Ballou-u-u.\n\nProfessor Sam The Shade, The Sunrise Kid: [singing] It's a hanging day in Wolf City, Wyoming. Wolf City, Wyoming in 1894. They're gonna drop Cat Ballou. Through that gallows' floor.\n\nThus Cat Ballou should happen in 1894.\n\nLone Ranger - 1848?\n\nThe stories dated to 1865, 1869, or 1874 - depending on the serial.\n\nI remember a scene where the sheriff enters a cabin where the Lone Ranger has captured some outlaws and says he hasn't seen a mess like that since Custer's Last Stand, thus putting that episode in 1876 or later.\n\nCartwrights\n\nBen (born 1809), Adam (born 1830), Erick \"Hoss\" (born 1836), Joseph \"Little Joe\" (born 1842). This is based on Ben claiming to have met the Pirate hero Jean Lafitte in New Orleans.\n\nOr one could go by historical events in episodes. I believe the Battle of Pyramid Lake is mentioned in an episode. The first Battle of Pyramid Lake as 12 May 1860, the second 2-4 June 1860. And I think the Pony express is in at least one episode.\n\nHigh Noon.\n\nWill Kane (born 1838)\n\nThe film is set in Hadleyville, population 650, in the New Mexico Territory, on a hot summer Sunday. The 37-star flag the judge removes as he prepares to flee shows that the time frame is sometime between Nebraska's admission as the 37th state on March 1, 1867 and Colorado's admission as the 38th state on August 1, 1876.\n\nHigh Noon (1952) - Trivia - IMDb\n\nIt is said Will Kane is supposed to be 30, making him born about the 1837 to 1846.\n\nThe Shootist.\n\nEstablished by the headstone - JB Books was born 1843, died 1901.\n\nJosey Wales (born 1832)\n\ndated age 32 by his wanted poster.

It was white-washed.\n\nNevada Smith 1966 was not a cavalry vs Indians movie but does touch on anti Indian racism.\n\nIt does demonstrate how easy it is to be historically wrong, dead wrong, impossibly wrong, in a film involving Indians.\n\nWikipedia says that Nevada Smith's parents were murdered\n\nIn the West of the 1890s\n\n.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_Smith\n\nBut the movie might take lace earlier.\n\nThe IMDB Nevada Smith goofs section says:\n\nWhen Nevada Smith is after Jessie Coe, the music playing in the saloon in the background is \"Frankie and Johnnie.\" In a previous scene, Bowdre says he hasn't skinned an Indian since the war (Civil War) 15 years ago. Thus, the date of the story has to be no later than 1880. The first published version of the music to \"Frankie and Johnny\" appeared in 1904 (credited to and copyrighted by Hughie Cannon).\n\nNevada Smith (1966) - Goofs - IMDb\n\nPresumably Bowdre says that when murdering Max Sand's parents. Thus they should have been killed about 1876 to 1880. The half Kiowa Max/Nevada catches up with Jessie Coe in Abiline, Texas months or years later and is badly wounded. A Kiowa woman named Neesa takes Max/Nevada to a small Kiowa camp to recover. The Kiowa are camped in the same place weeks or months later when Max/Nevada leaves to continue his search for vengeance.\n\nIn history the fierce Kiowa and their dreaded Comanche allies were often at war with the Texans, and suffered their final military defeat in the Red River or Buffalo War in 1874 to 1875 and remained on their reservation in the Indian Territory afterwards.\n\nDid Neesa drag the badly injured Max/Nevada hundreds of miles to the Kiowa reservation?\n\nOr did a small group of Kiowa camp near Abiline, Texas for weeks or months without any trouble with the Texans? Wouldn't the Kiowa-fearing Texans call for Texas Rangers or the army to escort the Kiowa to their distant reservation or form a posse/lynch mob to attack the Kiowa camp?\n\nHow could Kiowa near Abiline, Texas survive where they were too far from the reservation to collect rations, and when there were no more buffalo left in Texas to hunt, and when Neesa was apparently the only Kiowa woman who made a living as a dance hall ..../prostitute? By hunting rancher's cattle? that wouldn't make friends with the Texans.\n\nOf course if Nevada Smith happens in the 1890s the presence of Kiowa near Abiline, Texas would be even more improbable.\n\nHarold Robbins who wrote The carpetbaggers, or director Henry Hathaway, or screenwriter John Michael Hayes, could have solved that problem by having Max/Nevada catch up with Jessie Coe at a town that Indians did live near without any problems for decades. But that would mean making Neesa, and maybe Max/Nevada's mother, a member of a tribe that was more peaceful (and lucky) than the Kiowas and thus not as familiar to the audience.\n\nFor example, Max could kill Jessie Coe at Tuscon, Arizona, and Nessa could be a member of the local Tohono O'Odham or Papago tribe. They were so friendly (with whites and Mexicans) that they joined whites and Mexicans in brutally massacring over a hundred Apache women and children near Camp Grant in 1871, believing that the only good Apache was a dead Apache.\n\nBut nobody ever made movies with titles like \"Tohono O'Odham Uprising\" or \"Papago Ambush\" so movie goers would think they were as fictional as the Hekawis in F Troop.\n\nI am a little disappointed that only one person has posted any fictional dates for Cavalry and Indians movies.\n\nSo here is a list of more or less cavalry and Indians movies that have explicit dates. I would be glad if anyone adds other dates or corrects these dates.

I assume that most of the fictional dates given in IMDB, and/or Wikipedia, and/or the AFI Feature Film Catalog are correct - but Sergeants 3 1962 has a 1870 date in Wikipedia and AFI but seems to have an 1873 date in dialog, and Hondo 1953 has a fictional date of 1870 in the Movie Mistakes website and 1874 in 1874 in AFI.\n\nNote 2.\n\nThe Battle of the Little Bighorn was on June 25 to 26, 1876, and there are many movies and TV episodes set before, during, or after the Little Bighorn in 1876 and people familiar with them might decide to arrange the 1876 films in a different order.\n\nNote 3.\n\nCuster of the West Chronicles Custer's mostly fictional life from sometime during the Civil War of 1861 to 1865 up to June 25 1876.\n\nNote 4.\n\nThey Died With Their Boots On 1941 covers Custer's life from entrance to West Point (1857 in real history) to June 25, 1876.\n\nnote 5.\n\nThere are at least three films with long but vague chronologies that have a number of more or less historic moments and thus several different orders they can be watched in.\n\nThe events in The Plainsman 1936 seem to take place over a few months unless there is a timeskip somewhere. The movie itself says that it combines many lives and many events, so some of the events are not totally real even in the fictional universe of the film. Historical events include the shooting of Abraham Lincoln 14 April 1865, Custer&#8217;s Last Stand on 25 June 1876, the ride of the Fifth Cavalry to reinforce the army of General Crook, and the assassination of Wild Bill Hickok on 2 August 1876. A number of fictional events in the film are suggested by historic events like the Fetterman Massacre 21 December 1866, the ride of &#8220;Portugee&#8221; Phillips 21 to 25 December 1866, The Battle of Beecher Island 17 to 19 september 1868, and Hickok&#8217;s fight with 7th cavalry soldiers 17 June 1870. The Plainsman 1936 could be watched in order of any one of those dates. 3 pistols.\n\nChief Crazy Horse 1955 has vague chronology but covers Crazy Horse&#8217;s childhood vision, connecting it with a deathbed prophecy by Conquering Bear after the Grattan Massacre in 1854, and in his adult life the Fetterman Massacre on 21 December 1866, the treaty of Fort Laramie in November 1868, the Battle of the Rosebud 17 June 1876, the death of Crazy Horse&#8217;s daughter in 1873, the Little Bighorn 25 June 1876 (all seemingly in one year) and next year the surrender of Crazy Horse 05 May 1877 and the death of Crazy Horse 05 September 1877. Chief Crazy Horse could be viewed at any one of those dates. 3 pistols.\n\nThe Novel Little Big Man by Thomas Berger begins in 1852 and continues to 1876, with Jack Crabb/Little Big Man experiencing a number of historic events during the period. The movie Little Big Man 1970 makes Jack&#8217;s experiences less historical. The movie might be watched at the time of any of the historical events in the book. Events such as the Battle of Solomon&#8217;s Fork 29 July 1857, the Battle of Plum Creek Station 22 August 1867, The Battle of the Washita 27 November 1868, Custer&#8217;s Last Stand 25 June 1876, and the murder of Wild Bill Hickok 2 August 1876, which the film places before Custer&#8217;s Last Stand.\n\nNote 6.\n\nThere are many vague and contradictory clues to the fictional date of Fort Apache 1948 so I am just assuming very broadly that it happens sometime between 1865 to 1880 (and that General Thursday arrives on February 22). Even though the Goofs section in IMDB directly states that Fort Apache is in 1874. 5 pistols.\n\nPrior to television, the movie genre was usually categorized as \"Westerns\", and in fact, still is.\n\nI remember growing up in the 1950's and we often played \"Cowboys and Indians\", and I do not recall a single instance of playing, or uttering, \"Cavalry and Indians\". It baffles me why that was so. I suspect that the phrase stemmed from the TV shows of the 1950's because I cannot think of a single film with both indians and gunfire that did not have cavalry featured, or at least riding to the rescue.\n\nVirtually all of the TV programs in the 1950's featured main characters that were not cavalry. Western TV shows absolutely dominated TV ratings in the 1950's, with 26 shows on the (only) three networks in 1959 and eight of the top ten rated shows. While few of these shows depicted cowboys as regular cast members, the vast majority of male characters that were not lawmen or townsmen were called cowboys. I would guess that about a third of all TV episodes depicted indians as the villains, and the cavalry showed up about 90% of the time in the episodes that had gunfire.\n\nWell, most movies fit more or less into several different genres, maybe having a main genre and several minor genres. Thus a typical western with heroes fighting crooks, outlaws, and rustlers, etc., could be classified by some as a crime story set in the mythical wild west or the historical west or halfway between depending on how historically accurate it is. Or maybe as a western with crime the sub genre.\n\nAnd a western with soldiers and Indians fighting each other could be classified by some as a quasi historical story set in the mythical wild west or the historical west or halfway between depending on how historically accurate it is. Or maybe as a western with Indian conflict the sub genre.\n\nTo digress a little, I like science fiction time travel stories to depict past eras accurately. The old Time Tunnel TV series used props and clips from various older movies or TV shows mixed in with existing costumes, and props to depict various eras. Thus one might notice styles changing between scenes within an episode and varying degrees of accuracy.\n\nFor example the Time Tunnel episode \"Massacre\" used indoor sets and outdoor filming in southern California as well as scenes from several different movies filmed in different areas, thus creating an amusing variation in scenery, etc.\n\nWhen trying to figure out when and where time travelers Tony and Doug are, General Kirk at the Time Tunnel complex in 1968 sees blue coated US cavalry and says they should be after the Civil War (1861-1865) because of the style of guidons (fork tailed flags) they carry.\n\nAnd the general, perhaps realistically, is only partly correct. The scene they watch shows a guidon divided horizontally, red over white.\n\nThe 1833 to 1862 pattern guidons were red over white with a white \"U.S.\" above and an red company letter below. They are a very common design in westerns because they only have to have the company letter(s) agree with those mentioned in the dialog.\n\nThe 1862 to 1885 pattern guidons had a stars and stripes design. They can be seen in Tonka (1958), A Distant Trumpet (1964), Duel at Diablo (1966), Son of the Morning Star (1991), etc.\n\nThe 1885 pattern guidons, still used by US cavalry companies, are red over white with a white regimental number above and a red company letter below. They can be seen in many westerns including Stagecoach (1939).\n\nAnd of course many westerns used guidon designs never carried by the US cavalry.\n\nSo General Kirk would have been more correct if he used the guidon design and the blue uniform color to date the scene to either 1833 to 1862 or 1885 to about 1900. The different clips in \"Massacre\" depict different types of flags and guidons.\n\nIn Back to the Future Part III Marty McFly travels back to 2 September 1885 and appears where dozens of Indians are being chased by dozens of cavalrymen. Even though the last Indian battles in California had been over a decade before 1885. Note that the Indians look like Plains warriors with feather war bonnets so apparently the cavalry has chased them for over 700 miles as the crow flies to northern California in some fictional epic pursuit.\n\nSince the Back to Future movies are mainly in the comedy genre and are only in the science fiction and western genres to a lesser degree, that is not as much of a problem if it would be if they were serious dramas.\n\nIn any serious science fiction about time travel to the past, the past era has to be depicted as accurately as possible. It should look like the real past instead of popular ideas about the past, and past people should act like real past people and not popular stereotypes of past people. If time travel was possible, it could only take one to a real past, not to an imaginary past.\n\nIt is perfectly possible to make a great movie set in a totally imaginary and fictional past, like the Lord of the Rings movies supposedly happening long before recorded history. And according to critics there are many good western movies and a few great ones, no matter how wild and imaginary the west is in them. And as you may have noticed I am fond of cowboys and Indians or cavalry vs Indians movies or whatever they are called even though - or maybe because - the west is usually very wild and woolly in them.\n\nSome additons to my list of cavalry & Indians movies with explicit dates according to various sources.\n\nSo here is a list of more or less cavalry and Indians movies that have explicit dates. I would be glad if anyone adds other dates or corrects these dates.

I assume that most of the fictional dates given in IMDB, and/or Wikipedia, and/or the AFI Feature Film Catalog are correct - but Sergeants 3 1962 has a 1870 date in Wikipedia and AFI but seems to have an 1873 date in dialog, and Hondo 1953 has a fictional date of 1870 in the Movie Mistakes website and 1874 in 1874 in AFI.\n\nNote 2.\n\nThe Battle of the Little Bighorn was on June 25 to 26, 1876, and there are many movies and TV episodes set before, during, or after the Little Bighorn in 1876 and people familiar with them might decide to arrange the 1876 films in a different order.\n\nNote 3.\n\nCuster of the West Chronicles Custer's mostly fictional life from sometime during the Civil War of 1861 to 1865 up to June 25 1876.\n\nNote 4.\n\nThey Died With Their Boots On 1941 covers fictional Custer's life from entrance to West Point (1857 in real history) to June 25, 1876.\n\nnote 5.\n\nThere are at least three films with long but vague chronologies that have a number of more or less historic moments and thus several different orders they can be watched in.\n\nThe events in The Plainsman 1936 seem to take place over a few months unless there is a timeskip somewhere. The movie itself says that it combines many lives and many events, so some of the events are not totally real even in the fictional universe of the film. Historical events include the shooting of Abraham Lincoln 14 April 1865, Custer&#8217;s Last Stand on 25 June 1876, the ride of the Fifth Cavalry to reinforce the army of General Crook, and the assassination of Wild Bill Hickok on 2 August 1876. A number of fictional events in the film are suggested by historic events like the Fetterman Massacre 21 December 1866, the ride of &#8220;Portugee&#8221; Phillips 21 to 25 December 1866, The Battle of Beecher Island 17 to 19 september 1868, and Hickok&#8217;s fight with 7th cavalry soldiers 17 June 1870. The Plainsman 1936 could be watched in order of any one of those dates. 3 pistols.\n\nChief Crazy Horse 1955 has vague chronology but covers Crazy Horse&#8217;s childhood vision, connecting it with a deathbed prophecy by Conquering Bear after the Grattan Massacre in 1854, and in his adult life the Fetterman Massacre on 21 December 1866, the treaty of Fort Laramie in November 1868, the Battle of the Rosebud 17 June 1876, the death of Crazy Horse&#8217;s daughter in 1873, the Little Bighorn 25 June 1876 (all seemingly in one year) and next year the surrender of Crazy Horse 05 May 1877 and the death of Crazy Horse 05 September 1877. Chief Crazy Horse could be viewed at any one of those dates. 3 pistols.\n\nThe Novel Little Big Man by Thomas Berger begins in 1852 and continues to 1876, with Jack Crabb/Little Big Man experiencing a number of historic events during the period. The movie Little Big Man 1970 makes Jack&#8217;s experiences less historical. The movie might be watched at the time of any of the historical events in the book. Events such as the Battle of Solomon&#8217;s Fork 29 July 1857, the Battle of Plum Creek Station 22 August 1867, The Battle of the Washita 27 November 1868, Custer&#8217;s Last Stand 25 June 1876, and the murder of Wild Bill Hickok 2 August 1876, which the film places before Custer&#8217;s Last Stand.\n\nNote 6.\n\nThere are many vague and contradictory clues to the fictional date of Fort Apache 1948 so I am just assuming very broadly that it happens sometime between 1865 to 1880 (and that General Thursday arrives on February 22). Even though the Goofs section in IMDB directly states that Fort Apache is in 1874. 5 pistols.\n\nMAGolding is online now Report Post"
