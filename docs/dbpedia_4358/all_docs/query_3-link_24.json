        "text": "This article is about a/an movie in Power Rangers Turbo, the third season in the Zordon Era .\n\nTurbo: A Power Rangers Movie is an American superhero film serving as a prequel to the events of Power Rangers Turbo.\n\nPlot[]\n\nOn the distant planet Liaria, a wizard named Lerigot is fleeing for his life from unseen enemy forces. In desperation, he uses a magical key in his possession to teleport away from them.\n\nIn the city of Angel Grove, Power Rangers Tommy Oliver, Adam Park, and Rocky DeSantos are training for an upcoming martial arts charity tournament, but Rocky's lack of focus while training causes him to fail a jumping kick and land outside of the ring right on his back, critically injuring him, and is taken to the hospital. Elsewhere in the city, their fellow Rangers Katherine Hillard and Tanya Sloan are on a school bus helping the children of the Little Angel's Haven shelter. Among the kids is a young boy named Justin Stewart, who is stuck in the shelter due to his father always working and never being around and the death of his mother. Kat tries to cheer him up, but Justin shrugs her off.\n\nBack on Liaria, the alien pirate Divatox admonishes her soldiers for failing to capture Lerigot and orders her subordinates Rygog and Elgar to find him immediately. They trace the wizard's path to Earth, and Divatox deduces that he is seeking refuge with Zordon. Their Subcraft immediately lifts off from Liaria and flies towards Earth.\n\nAt the hospital, Justin comes in to visit Rocky but hides under his bed as the other Rangers come in to pay their sympathy to him. Their communicators suddenly go off as Zordon summons them to the Power Chamber, unaware that Justin has overheard them, but Rocky discovers that Justin was hiding under his bed and has overheard them and accidentally discovered that they are the Power Rangers.\n\nInside the Power Chamber, Zordon and Alpha 5 explain that Lerigot is being pursued by Divatox as part of her plan to awaken and marry the fire demon Maligore, who sleeps on the island of Muiranthias. In his panic, Lerigot has landed in the African wilderness Encountering animals and is now at risk of dying from heatstroke. Tommy and Kat agree to locate the wizard and bring him to safety.\n\nAs they arrive on Earth, Divatox has Elgar capture two humans \"of purity and strength\" to be used as sacrifices for Maligore. Elgar brings her Bulk and Skull, security guards working under Jerome Stone who had gotten lost on their way to the International Dance-a-Thon when they were captured. Disgusted at his poor choice of sacrifices, Divatox orders Elgar to try again and throws the pair in the Subcraft's hold.\n\nAfter a long and dangerous search through Africa, Tommy and Kat find a passed-out Lerigot and revive him with supplies from their Power Boxes, then take him to the Power Chamber to recover. They are soon contacted by Divatox, who demands that Lerigot be surrendered to her immediately. To emphasize, she reveals that she has captured Lerigot's wife and child, Yara and Bethel, as well as former Power Rangers Jason Lee Scott and Kimberly Ann Hart (both captured while they were scuba-diving) and that she will kill them all if the wizard does not surrender.\n\nOn the beach, the Rangers are unable to stop Lerigot as he willingly surrenders to Divatox, and her forces throw back what appear to be Jason and Kimberly into the water as they take him away. The Rangers quickly discover them to be nothing but their empty scuba-suits. Back in the Subcraft, Jason and Kimberly are put in the hold next to Bulk and Skull as they await their fate as Maligore's sacrifices.\n\nZordon explains that Lerigot's magical key is required to ensure safe passage through the Nemesis Triangle, which prevents all ships from reaching Muiranthias. A vessel known as the Ghost Galleon can pass through the Triangle, but the Rangers' current powers will not suffice for this journey. Instead, Zordon creates a new form of power to protect them -- the Turbo Keys and Turbozords. Now the Turbo Rangers, Tommy, Kat, Tanya, and Adam quickly adjust to their new Turbozords, the Red Lightning, Wind Chaser, Dune Star, and Desert Thunder, though Rocky's Mountain Blaster must stay behind due to his injuries until he is recovered.\n\nThe Rangers arrive at the rendezvous point where the Ghost Galleon awaits its passengers. Before the Rangers board, the Mountain Blaster arrives with its driver... Justin. He explains that he had followed the Rangers to the Power Chamber and was given Zordon's blessing to take Rocky's place and become the Blue Turbo Ranger. Now five-strong again, the Rangers load the Turbozords onto the Galleon and begin their journey,\n\nThough the Rangers' Turbo Keys renders the Galleon invisible to Divatox's Subcraft, they don’t do the same to it’s tripulation, which allows Divatox to spot them through the radar, so she deploys Putra Pods to climb aboard the Galleon and destroy them, though they are fought off. Down in the holds, Jason and Kimberly attempt to escape by pulling apart a bulkhead, a dangerous plan that very nearly drowns them. While Kimberly escapes with Bulk and Skull, Jason snags his shirt and is unable to follow before Divatox seals the bulkhead with the emergency hatch and leaves him trapped. She is displeased that Maligore is going to have to deal with one sacrifice....for now.\n\nAfter forcing Lerigot to have her Subcraft pass through the Nemesis Triangle, Divatox is shocked to see the Rangers still tailing her, and a call for advice from Rita Repulsa proves useless. The Subcraft fires torpedoes at the Galleon to destroy it, but the Rangers escape to their Turbozords and drive on the ocean surface to reach Muiranthias. Kimberly is also found by the Malichians, and Bulk and Skull are left to fend for themselves. Upon making landfall, Divatox convinces the native Malichians (who have Kimberly in their possession) to lead her to Maligore's temple where they worship him.\n\nMorphing with their Turbo Keys for the first time, the Turbo Rangers give chase to the temple, where Divatox is preparing to throw Jason and Kimberly into the Pit of Eternal Flame and awaken Maligore with a pre-nuptial snack. She sends her Piranhatrons to delay the Rangers as the sacrifices are made and Jason and Kimberly are turned into Maligore's evil minions. The Rangers are barely able to keep their own friends from killing them, and Lerigot and Yara use their combined power to restore the pair to normal, allowing the Rangers to draw their Turbo Weapons and focus on the Pirahnatrons.\n\nDivatox throws Elgar to the Pit as a new sacrifice, awakening Maligore as he begins throwing the Rangers around effortlessly. When Maligore grows in size, the Rangers summon their Turbozords to unite into the Turbo Megazord. After a fierce fight, Maligore is destroyed by the Turbo Megazord, and Divatox flees for her life while swearing revenge on the Power Rangers as the volcano erupts.\n\nAfter recovering Bulk and Skull, the Rangers return to Angel Grove in time for the martial arts tournament with Jason filling in for Rocky. They ultimately win the tournament, winning a sizable charity donation to the Little Angel's Haven as well. The Rangers, along with Jason, Kimberly, & Rocky, later return to the Power Chamber to see Lerigot and his family off as they go home to Liaria.\n\nCharacters[]\n\nRangers[]\n\nRed Turbo Ranger Tommy Oliver Blue Turbo Ranger Justin Stewart Green Turbo Ranger Adam Park Yellow Turbo Ranger Tanya Sloan Zeo Ranger I Pink\n\nPink Turbo Ranger\n\nKatherine Hillard\n\nAllies[]\n\nZordon\n\nAlpha 5\n\nLerigot\n\nJason Lee Scott\n\nKimberly Ann Hart\n\nRocky DeSantos\n\nSupporting Characters[]\n\nErnie (cameo)\n\nJerome Stone\n\nFarkas Bulkmeier\n\nEugene Skullovitch\n\nYara\n\nBethel\n\nVillains[]\n\nDivatox's Crew\n\nDivatox\n\nRygog\n\nElgar\n\nPiranhatrons\n\nPutra Pods\n\nMaligore\n\nRita Repulsa (cameo)\n\nLord Zedd (cameo)\n\nCast[]\n\nJason David Frank as Tommy Oliver (Red Turbo Ranger)\n\nBlake Foster as Justin Stewart (Blue Turbo Ranger)\n\nJohnny Yong Bosch as Adam Park (Green Turbo Ranger)\n\nNakia Burrise as Tanya Sloan (Yellow Turbo Ranger)\n\nCatherine Sutherland as Katherine \"Kat\" Hillard (Zeo Ranger I Pink/Pink Turbo Ranger)\n\nSteve Cardenas as Rocky DeSantos\n\nAustin St. John as Jason Lee Scott\n\nAmy Jo Johnson as Kimberly Ann Hart\n\nHilary Shepard Turner as Divatox\n\nPaul Schrier as Farkas \"Bulk\" Bulkmeier\n\nJason Narvy as Eugene \"Skull\" Skullovitch\n\nGregg Bullock as Lt.

(end credits)\n\nVHS/DVD Releases[]\n\nBefore the film begins, the VHS release first featured the trailer for Anastasia and the sneak peek for Saban's film of Casper, the Friendly Ghost entitled, Casper: A Spirited Beginning.\n\nThe movie has seen two releases on DVD altogether. The first was on March 13, 2001 by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, which was released on a two-sided disc which also contained Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie. The second release on September 2 in 2003, is a one-sided disc.\n\nWhile Hasbro lacks distribution rights for the movie (legally, distribution rights are under Disney via 20th Century Studios), the 98 disc Power Rangers Legacy DVD Set contains a spare slot for the film, right before the first set of Power Rangers Turbo episodes.\n\nas of March 20, 2019, the Distribution rights are now with Disney, as Disney bought 20th Century Fox.\n\nas of February 23, 2021, both Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie are now on Disney+ in selected regions.\n\nShout! Factory licensed this film and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie for Blu-ray as part of its licensing deal with Fox, releasing it on July 30, 2019, one month after MMPR: TM's individual release. As with that movie, Turbo is co-branded with Saban due to Shout!'s status as the official distributor of the franchise. Both films were given brand new 4K restorations for the release.\n\nErrors[]\n\nWhen Skull is trying to put mustard on his hot dog he proceeds to try to stomp on it and then picks it up to continue trying to put it on his hot dog. If looked closely the viewers will see there is no hot dog and he is just trying to put it in a bun. However, after spraying it all over Lt. Stone the hot dog reappears.\n\nThe Power Chamber exterior in this movie is the same from the previous movie but would revert back to its normal appearance for the series.\n\nBulk and Skull wear black shirts as part of their police uniforms whereas in the series they wear light blue.\n\nWhen Kat falls off a cliff and holds on to a branch, she calls the Zeonizer bracelets to morph before falling. The left one gets stuck on the branch and when she falls, the bracelet slips from her left arm. This is shown in a close shot. One shot later, when the viewers see Katherine falling, she is wearing both bracelets. A shot later, she again doesn't wear the left one and it's falling close to her while she catches it in the air.\n\nAfter Tommy and Kat come ashore, Kat is wearing her yellow life vest. In the next shot it has disappeared.\n\nAfter Tommy the Red Ranger, Jason, and Kimberly had been knocked away from the lava pit in Maligore's temple, Kat the Pink Ranger picked Tommy's previously removed helmet from the ground from behind them. In the very next shot, Kat picks the helmet up from the ground again and she hands it over to Tommy.\n\nJason's earring changes between shots on the sub craft. This is probably due to using different takes from different filming sessions.\n\nAfter Bulk and Skull escape the submarine, Kimberly goes next and her shirt gets caught on one of the bolts to her left. Jason, also to her left, reaches around her to free her. In the next shot, he's reaching beside her to pull her shirt loose from the bolt.\n\nWhen Kimberly arrives on Muiranthias, she has a hole in her tank top from when it got caught in the bilge, but it is on the right side instead of the left side and remains on the right side for the rest of the film.\n\nWhen Rocky is in the boxing ring and he does a flying kick which causes him to fly out of the ring and damage his back. the white towel on Adam's left shoulder jumps to his right shoulder, and then back again, between shots.\n\nOn the Ghost Galleon, the Rangers are standing out on the deck, when suddenly the ship comes under attack by the Putra Pods. Tommy cries \"hit the deck!\" and they all kneel down to the floor. After this, between shots Tommy's position behind Justin keeps changing, as does the position of his hands on Justin.\n\nAfter landing in Africa, Lerigot falls out of the birds-nest that he ended up in. When he hits the ground (and then again when he finds the lion), he has leaves all over his front and back. However the amount of leaves on his clothes keeps differing instantly between shots. Also, his hair becomes very messy when he finds the lion and falls backward, but as the shot changes his hair becomes instantly neat again.\n\nWhen Adam joins the others on Muiranthias to tell them Lerigot is dying, the strap of the power box Kat wears on her back is fastened around her abdomen. In the very next shot, when Kat is seen with Adam when he says they may already be too late, Kat's power box strap is suddenly across the top of her chest instead.\n\nWhen Divatox orders Elgar to throw her two captured humans (Jason and Kimberly) into the bilge, she raises her left arm up in the air in this wide-shot. In the immediate closeup it is now her right arm which is lifted upwards.\n\nWhen Lerigot arrives on Earth in Africa, it is daytime and it is night in Angel Grove, the city where the Rangers live. After Lerigot arrives on Earth and we see Bulk and Skull in Angel Grove, it is at the baseball field and it is during the daytime. When we next see Bulk and Skull a few minutes later in Angel Grove, it is now correctly night time.\n\nRight after the volcano explodes and we see the rangers running out the cave, a man wearing a greenish shirt and a black cap, holding something that looks like a large soda in his hand is visible on the right side of the screen for a second. It occurs at 1:20:35 and requires the right timing to pause and see.\n\nWhen Adam arrives on Muiranthias in his Desert Thunder Zord, as he pulls up in the jungle and gets out of the Zord, in the side of the vehicle as he pulls up you can see a large black screen reflected (clearly equipment not seen in the previous shot due to careful panning).\n\nAfter the Rangers morph on Muiranthias, you can see stage lights, cameras, and crew reflected in the Rangers' visors.\n\nWhen Divatox runs out from Maligore's temple, and she pushes between Bulk and Skull, to the right of the screen you can see a crewmember's arm in the shot.\n\nWhen the Rangers arrive in the cave entrance of Maligore's temple (as Tommy cries \"all right guys, this is it!\", Justin puts his arm against the stone cave wall and it wobbles, revealing it is a fake set wall.\n\nDuring the fight scene in the volcano, when Adam and Elgar are fighting briefly, the latter can be seen with the more evil looking Zelmoda mask from Gekisou Sentai Carranger, rather than the more goofy American-made mask (which was used more often as his appearance was thought to scare children).\n\nThe way Rocky injures himself was very unrealistic. He should have slammed into the ropes of the ring, not flown right over it and crashed onto the ground.\n\nWhen the Rangers morph to enter the volcano, Justin mistakenly uses his right hand when the left hand was generally used.\n\nIronically, that would become the right way when Justin is joined by T.J., Carlos, Ashley, and Cassie in the series.\n\nThe Rangers' suits lack the Turbo logo and numbering featured on their shoulders. These would be added in the TV show.\n\nThe scene with Bulk, Skull, and Lt. Stone at the baseball game took place in the daytime, while all the surrounding scenes took place at night.\n\nFor some reason Divatox waited until after she thought Lerigot would have reached Zordon before removing the mind-block from Yara to allow her to lure him to them.\n\nThe Turbozords cockpits appeared to be too large to possibly fit inside the car-sized Zords.\n\nWhen Kimberly and Jason are discussing trying to escape from Divatox's sub, Jason lights up his dive computer which is mounted on his left wrist but much later when they are attempting the escape, Jason can be seen wearing it on his right wrist when he is instructing Bulk and Skull on what to do while escaping.\n\nAlso, Jason was able to get an accurate reading from his dive computer, despite not being submerged in water.\n\nJason noted that he and Kimberly should wait until the sub rose to 100 feet before loosening the hatch, but they began loosening it immediately.\n\nMuiranthias appeared just as close to the Ghost Galleon when the Rangers saw it from the ship as it had a few seconds earlier when Justin was using binoculars.\n\nWhen fighting Maligore, the Rangers collectively draw their weapons but only have the opportunity to use them as projectile-firing weapons, despite Tommy and Tanya's weapons being a sword and knuckles respectively.\n\nAdam also aims the Thunder Cannon the wrong way, meaning that it should shoot him in the chest, but it still fires forwards.\n\nDespite the fact that Tommy, Adam, and Jason had been easily besting their opponents, everyone still seemed surprised that they won the karate tournament.\n\nThe giant novelty check was seemingly already made out to Little Angel's Haven before the declaration of the winners.\n\nThe Pirahnatrons are clearly normal people in suits, yet the ones in-series were fish thugs.\n\nNotes[]\n\nThis movie was released the same day that Big Bad Beetleborgs episode 36, Operation Frankenbeans aired.\n\nThe working title of this movie was Power Rangers: Race to the Volcano.[1] Another alternate title for the movie was Turbo: A Power Rangers Adventure.[2]\n\nAlthough the reason for this change is unclear, it was presumably done to more clearly associate it with the then upcoming season and thus not seem standalone. The second was likely altered due to sounding extremely generic given almost every episode is some kind of adventure.\n\nUnlike the first movie, this movie takes place within the continuity of the television series, with the first episode of Turbo taking place right after (with a montage of movie clips to cement its placement).\n\nBecause of this, the design for the movie was closer to the television show's design, with spandex Ranger suits and a suit-mation Megazord rather than the first movie's armor-like suits and CGI Megazord fight.\n\nIn addition, certain new sets and costumes from the movie were also used in the television series (albeit with no mention of the extensive makeover they received in the interim, such as the Power Chamber set and the Alpha costume), unlike anything from the movie save for the Tenga Warriors.\n\nDespite sticking close to the Super Sentai style, this movie does not feature footage from Gekisou Sentai Carranger, likely out of concern of the change in quality between Carranger and footage shot for the movie as well as an American-exclusive villain.\n\nDue to this, original footage was shot for weapon and Zord cockpit scenes, though the latter was not carried into the subsequent TV series.\n\nKat is the only Ranger to use her Zeo powers in the movie (albeit only briefly) when she uses them to try and save herself from plummeting into a river.\n\nA new teleportation effect for the Rangers is introduced in this movie which would carry on to the TV series.\n\nTommy (Jason David Frank), Rocky (Steve Cardenas), Adam (Johnny Yong Bosch), and Kimberly (Amy Jo Johnson) are the only Rangers to appear in the previous movie, although only Tommy and Adam are active Rangers in both.\n\nBulk and Skull are shown to have rejoined Lt. Stone and have taken jobs as stadium security guards, with no mention being made of the fate of their detective agency or Bulk and Skull's jobs in France.\n\nThis movie marks a significant redesign of the interior of the Power Chamber. The Mighty Morphin' suit and weapons gallery has been removed and replaced with five Ranger-colored tubes, the console has been replaced with a larger one with two smaller consoles on either side, and the floor design has also been changed.\n\nAlpha 5 has also been redesigned, with his new body being shinier and the lightning bolt on his chest being symmetrical. This new body, however, would be more commonly associated with Alpha 6.\n\nThe sets made to represent the Turbo Zord and Turbo Megazord cockpits are not modeled after the Carranger originals and lack the Turbo Karts.\n\nA deleted scene involved Tommy and Kat using a flamethrower during their search for Lerigot; a picture of this scene appeared on the back of the VHS box.\n\nErnie makes his final on-screen appearance here, with his departure being established in \"Shadow Rangers\". He is seen in the crowd during the end competition.\n\nThe reason for his departure was because his actor, Richard Genelle, was experiencing serious health problems due to being overweight. He died in 2008.\n\nAs with Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie, the first release of the film's trailer & the scenes featured in the Power Rangers Turbo, Go music video implies that the film was shot in a 4:3 (1.33:1) aspect ratio before it was eventually cropped into widescreen in the final cut.\n\nThe costumes for Lerigot and Yara, the puppet for Bethel, and the eel owned by Divatox were created by Steve Johnson's XFX Inc.\n\nThe costumes for Maligore and the Eaglettes as well as the animatronics for Elgar were created by Chiodo Bros. Productions Inc.\n\nThe costume for Alpha 5 and the animatronics for Rygog were created by David Barton.\n\nThe costumes for the Putra Pods, the Warriors, and Divatox were created by Kenneth J. Hall and Total Fabrication.\n\nThe animals were provided by Boone's Animals for Hollywood Inc.\n\nThe movie marks the final unmorphed appearance of Kimberly. She would later appear morphed in Legendary Battle, Grid Connection, and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Once & Always.\n\nQuotes[]\n\nBulk: We go swimming?\n\nReception[]\n\nThe film has been given almost universally negative reviews from critics and moviegoers, with an 15% Rotten rating from Rotten Tomatoes. Kevin Thomas wrote a positive review in The Los Angeles Times saying the filmmakers have brought much panache and sophistication to the making of this fantasy adventure extolling the good old-fashioned virtues of spirit and courage embodied by the Power Rangers and that \"Turbo\" is a solid follow-up. Other reviews were a mixture of positive and negative. [Citation needed]\n\nHowever, the majority of reviews were decidedly negative. Lawrence Van Gelder, of The New York Times, gave the film a very bad review. \"Five-year-olds who have read their Shakespeare will recognize that Turbo is a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing.\" [Citation needed]\n\nSee Also[]\n\nEp. 1: Fighting for Traffic Safety - Super Sentai counterpart in Carranger.
