Suprisingly enough I have a reason.\n\nNo it isn't game balance (mostly because I have heard enough people complaign about how 'unbalanced' that makes it).\n\nThe answer is one that should satisfy those that want 'Realism'.\n\nOne of my biggest problems with Terror of the Deep was the fact that XCom was mothballed after the invasion. My question is how? It couldn't actually happen, with the man power and tech at your disposal XCom could and would overpower the whole world no question.\n\nWhat does this have to do with a single base and just one skyranger (One that is only capable of transporting a half section at that). The answer is well everything. Xcom is a mercenary outfit that the council have deemed a nessecary evil, they carefully profide funding and tech support but only enough to keep Xcom dependant on the council. Why a 'Grey\" market? So that Xcom don't turn to the Black Market and make enough money not to need them any more. Why a maximum staff of 99 soldiers? So that when the time comes they can be sure that Xcom can and will be shut down. Why only a single base? So they know where to find you.\n\nI challenge anyone to justify a real world government giving a group that they have no operational control over the ability to become a threat to them? Not going to happen, not now, not in the face of Alien Anihilation either.\n\nSo to sum up you get just one base and just one skyranger due to the fear of the council that once the aliens are defeated you will outgrow them.\n\nDoes this make your job harder? Of course it does, but guess what Suck it up and put your big boy pants on because they are NEVER going to risk you conquering the world."
