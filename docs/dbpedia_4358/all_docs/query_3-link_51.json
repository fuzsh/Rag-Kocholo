        "text": "FEATURES OF THE ENSIGN RANGER SPECIAL\n\nThe instructions contained in the accompanying booklet apply to the Ensign Ranger Special, but the following additional features should be noted.\n\nMasks are provided in the back of the camera so that two sizes of picture may be taken on a 120 or 620 roll film. When both masks are folded back inside the film chambers, the camera will take eight pictures 2 1/4 x 3 1/4, in. and the ruby window marked 8 should be used when winding on after each exposure.\n\nIf both masks are moved across the picture frame at the back of the camera, thus reducing the size o the aperture, twelve pictures 2 in square may he taken and the rub window marked 12 should he used\n\nThe appropriate field of view to each of these picture sizes is show in the Albada viewfinder. The centre square should be employee when taking 2-,' in. square picture and the larger rectangle when core posing 2 1/4 x 3 1/4, in. views.\n\nThe lens on the Ranger_ Special has a maximum aperture of f/4. and it is fitted with a four-speed shutter. The release is built into the body adjacent to the film winding knob.\n\nENSIGN RANGER II CAMERA - click on image to enlarge it.\n\n1. Catch holding camera back in position.\n\n2. Spring knob.\n\n3. Film winding knob.\n\n4. Button for opening camera.\n\n5. Pointer for aperture sizes (see Fig. 6).\n\n6. Aperture setting lever.\n\n7. Shutter front plate with speedmarkings and aperture scale.\n\n8. Rotating lens cell.\n\n9. Outer milled ring.\n\n10. Shutter setting lever.\n\n11. Shutter release.\n\n12. Socket for synchroflash plug (see Fig. 6).\n\n13. View Finder. Picture sizes:\n\nEight 34 x 24in. pictures on standard size 20 or 62 roll film.\n\nRecommended films:\n\nENSIGN ULTRACHROME -fast and highly orthochromatic.\n\nENSIGN FINE GRAIN PAN-a panchromatic film of very fine grain and medium speed.\n\nLOADING THE CAMERA WITH FILM\n\nRemove the gummed label which holds the paper leader in place; pull the latter across the rollers and insert the end in the wide slot of the empty spool.\n\nGive one or two turns to the film winding knob 3 in a clockwise direction to draw the paper leader taut. In doing this see that the paper leader is nicely centered between the spool flanges. Any tendency to wind crooked must be corrected before proceeding further (Fig. 3).\n\nClose the back of the camera, making sure it is securely fastened by the catch. Open the slide until it is clear of the ruby window and turn the winding knob 3 until first, a warning hand, and then a figure 1, appear in the ruby observation window (Fig. 4).\n\nClose the ruby window by means of the slide. This is most important when using panchromatic film.\n\nMAKING THE EXPOSURE\n\nLens Apertures\n\nThe aperture of the lens is controlled by the setting of the aperture pointer 5 on to one or other of the \" f \" numbers marked on the shutter front plate 7. The pointer is operated by the aperture setting lever 6. A higher number on the scale denotes a smaller aperture, needs a longer exposure time, and increases the depth of focus, e.g., f/ll is smaller than f/6.3 (Fig. 6).\n\nFor short-time exposures bring the red index mark opposite the letter B and pull over the setting lever 10. The shutter opens by pressing the release knob 11 and closes as soon as the pressure ceases.\n\nWhen long-time exposures are required turn the ring 9 until the red index mark is brought opposite the letter T. After the shutter lever 10 has been set by sliding it along in its groove, the shutter is operated as follows:\n\n(a) To open the shutter, press in the head of the release 11, then remove the pressure.\n\n(b) Immediately the required exposure has been given the shutter is closed by a further pressure on the head of the release plunger.\n\nHolding the Camera when Picture Taking\n\nFor short-time exposures and exposures of long duration a firm stand or rigid tripod should be used. The camera has two bushes for screwing it to a tripod, and the baseboard is provided with a folding leg for certain time exposure work.\n\nEXPOSURE TABLE\n\nThe following table gives a rough idea of the exposures and stops for various subjects, using the popular medium speed films, such as the Ensign Ultrachrome, from 10 a.m. until 2 p.m. in bright sunshine during April, May, June, July, August and September. For more detailed information, an exposure guide or meter is recommended.\n\nf/6.3 f/8 f/ll f/16 f/22 f/32 Open Seascapes and Cloud Studies 1/100 1/50 Open Landscapes with light foreground Beach Scenes 1/100 1/50 1/25 Average Landscapes with objects in Foreground. Figures in Open. River Scenes 1/100 1/50 1/25 1/10* Heavy Foreground, buildings or trees occupying greater portion of picture 1/100 1/50 1/25 1/10* 1/5* Portraits or Groups taken out of doors 1/100 1/50 1/25 1/10* 1/5* 1/2* Very dark, near objects 1/50 1/25 1/10* 1/5* 1/2* 1*\n\nIn other conditions the exposures are multiplied as follows : -\n\nIn October, November, December, January, February and March .... 2\n\nLight clouds over whole sky but able to cast visible shadow 2\n\nHeavy clouds over whole sky .... .... . 4\n\nWith Super-Speed Film .... .... ....\n\nNote: Bear in mind that modern roll films, while of greater speed, also resist the effect of over exposure. When in doubt, a longer exposure should, therefore, be given.\n\n* Recommended for use with Camera on tripod.\n\nDEPTH OF FOCUS FOR ENSIGN RANGER II CAMERA\n\nEnsign ROLL FILM\n\nEnsign roll film is at present available either in Ultrachrome -a fast highly orthochromatic film which adds greatly to the scope and speed of all your picture making-or Fine Grain Panchromatic-a film to give you correct rendering of all subjects in monochrome. Ensign Panchromatic films always give splendid enlargements because of their extremely fine grain. Ensign roll films are made in sizes to fit all the popular roll film cameras."
