A plane has crashed and the cast of the film turn out to be ghosts who 'disappear' as their bodies are recovered. In the end there is one sole 'ghost' until the searchers return and find his body under the tail plane. Have I imagined this as no one seems to know what i'm talking about?\n\nJulian McCarthy, Kingston upon Thames UK\n\nIt's a made-for-tv movie from 1970 called 'Sole Survivor' It stars Richard Basehart.\n\nJohn Dean, Oxford UK\n\nThis rings a bell with me. I'm pretty sure it was an episode of The Twilight Zone, though, not a film as such. If memory serves it may even have been directed by Steven Spielberg. The crew of US airmen had crashed their WW2 plane when a bomb got stuck in the bomb bay. They could not die properly until their remains had been found but their ghosts were accessible though some sort of time portal. The last scene was of the final guy being discovered beneath the wrecked tail plane.\n\nLeo Hickey, Barking UK\n\nThis film has been driving me crazy for years! I know a couple of people who have seen it but neither can remember its name, nor any of the cast. I too have searched on databases and have even gone into chat rooms to ask people! I am afraid I can't help with the title, but I can assure you that it is not your imagination (unless we are both crazy!) One person did suggest that it may have been a \"Twilight Zone\" episode, but I remember it as a feature length film. I think, although it was set in WWII, it was made in the late 60s or early 70s.\n\nPennie, Nottingham UK\n\nThis sounds a bit similar to a Robert Powell film of 20 years ago, based on James Herbert's book \"The Survivor\".\n\nJeff Vagg, Beckenham UK\n\nIt sounds like you're talking about \"Sole Survivor\", which was made in the seventies. The ghosts are the crew of an American B-17, which crashed in the Libyan desert during WW2. The wreckage is found twenty-odd years later, and among the recovery party is a USAF general (Richard Basehart) who was the young navigator who got them lost, then bailed out on them. The ghosts recognise him, and spend the rest of the movie trying to haunt a confession out of him. Not a great movie, but intriguing enough to have stuck in my mind this past thirty years.\n\nMark Power, Dublin Ireland\n\nIt sounds very like a book by James Herbert called Survivor (or The Survivor) - not sure if they ever made a film of it though.\n\nPete, London UK\n\nI think the film you're thinking of is \"Sole Survivor\". The plane was an American bomber which crashed in the desert. The crew spend their days playing baseball, not realising they're dead, until many years later a recovery crew locates their bodies.\n\nGerard Farrell, Manchester UK\n\nthis intriguing film is called \"Sole Survivor\", and was a TV movie made in 1970, directed by Paul Stanley and starring William Shatner. This film had \"haunted\" me for years until I finally tracked the title down after many, many lengthy internet searches. On at least two occasions when talking about films in the pub, someone has asked \"anyone remember that film where there's a crashed bomber and a crew that don't know there dead?\"\n\nGareth, Keighley UK\n\nLeo is probably thinking of The Twilight Zone episode \"King Nine Will Not Return\". The featured actor in that episode was Robert Cummings, but it was not directed by Spielberg.\n\nRobert del Valle, Detroit USA\n\nThe film in question ISN'T \"The Survivor\" (the film of the James Herbert book). The plot for The Survivor was that one man survives a plane crash (I think totally unharmed) and in his struggle to come to terms with this uncovers the fact that the plane was sabotaged/blown up. The twist is that he didn't survive. He is a manifestation of the will of all the lost souls and as soon as the truth is reveals he dies.\n\nDan Marchant, London\n\nI disagree that it was \"Sole Survivor\". That was a different story where a survivor of a crash became a highranking officer who had wrongly claimed that his plane had gone down in the Mediterranean. The film (definitely not a twilight Zone story) was set in the desert and consisted of the dead crew of the crashed aircraft not knowing they were dead until their colleagues suddenly began disappearing as their bodies were found. The final \"survivor\" was almost left alone by the plane until his body was found and his ghost released. I still don't know the name of the film and would love to know it.\n\nRay Mitcham, Southport Merseyside\n\nI sent this very enquiry to \"Empire\" film magazine last year and they confirmed that the film is indeed Sole Survivior, a TV movie made in the early 1970's and starring , amongst others, William Shatner. Unfortunately the film is not available on video.......if anyone knows of a way to obtain a copy I'd love to have one. It's a great film.\n\nHayley lord, Bristol UK\n\nI remember seeing a movie late one night many years ago where the crew of a ww2 American bomber are hanging around the wreck of their aircraft in the desert. Every time they try to leave they always end up back at the wreck. I seem to remember too that they were very fastidious about where they left their equipment. I must have asked a hundred people if they remember the film, but no luck. This has been the only place where people have described the story the way I remember it. The film sounds like \"sole survivor\" 1969 tv movie staring William Shatner which used the wreck of a B25-J Mitchell bomber. I hope this is the same film your thinking of. Is it available on video anywhere?\n\nJ. B. Wright, Perth , Western Australia Australia\n\nI too have been searching for this movie. My father was watching it and I watched it with him. I think he said the title was The Last Survivor. It is the story of a WWII Bomber and all the men were killed and one was under the plane, when the movie ended you found out they were all dead.\n\nKaren Coppola, Junction City Kentucky USA\n\nSole Survivor is indeed the film in question, although you might not recognise it from its description in most databases. They tend to emphasise the come-uppance of the now senior aviator who was responsible for the crash, rather than the more interesting supernatural aspect that everyone actually remembers the film for. Any similarity to The Twilight Zone episode is probably down to the fact Rod Serling also wrote Sole Survivor. It's likely that he drew inspiration from the discovery of the crashed WWII US bomber 'Lady Be Good' in the Libyan desert during the late '50's.\n\nCaptain Pedantic, London\n\nOk guys, with much researching I think I have it. As I have read above, almost everyone is right. Here is the kicker. The title of the movie is \"Sole Survivor\", however there are three movies with that title. There is a \"Sole Survivor\" with William Shatner released in 1970. (This is not the one we are looking for!) There is also a \"Sole Survivor\" released in 1982 with the same kind of plot (This is not the one we are looking for either!). The \"Sole Surviver\" we need was a CBS made-for-TV movie. It does star Richard Basehart, Lou Antonio, Alan Caillou, Larry Casey, Brad David, Vince Edwards, and directed by Paul Stanley. As I understand, it is almost impossible to retrieve a copy of this movie, unless you can find an underground dealer that has it recorded. Good Luck and whew!!!\n\nGino Macias, San Antonio, TX United States\n\nSorry, Dino, but the t.v.film you quote is the one made in 1970 starring the same cast.(See \"http://us.imdb.com/Title?0065007\" web site) However the film we are trying to find had NO survivors. Not a sole survivor. The film was about a crew who had ALL been killed in the crash and were all unknowingly ghosts around the plane. At the end of the film, all the ghosts had gone due to all the bodies being found. It certainly wasn't \"Sole Survivor\".\n\nRay Mitcham, Southport U.K.\n\nI remember the film as well and have been trying to find the answer for years (with no luck). A few more details of the film that I remember was that the crews' only entertainment was with a baseball and glove which one of them had. I seem to remember that all the crews' bodies were found except the captain's (his body was under the plane) leaving him (his spirit) all alone at the wreck. Did not the film end with him playing with glove and ball on his own ? Please, someone, for my sanity's sake, come up with the right answer (it is not 'Sole Survivor').\n\nMalcolm, Cardiff South Wales\n\nThe many other replies in this section correctly identify the movie as \"Sole Survivor\". Unfortunately, the story played out in the film is as nothing compared to its real-life inspiration, the ill-fated B-24 \"Lady Be Good\". What actually happened to the crew in the Libyan desert was, in my opinion, far more compelling than what we were given by Hollywood. By all means, do read about it at a web site with an excellent description of the actual case, at http://www.qmfound.com/lady_be_good_b-24_bomber_recovery.htm (the US Army Quartermaster Museum).\n\nMike, Alexandria, Virginia USA\n\nThe movie was indeed called \"Sole Survivor\", and released around 1970 starring Vince Edwards, Richard Basehart, and William Shatner. It is the story of an American B-25 that crashed in the Libyan desert and the crew are now all ghosts. This movie, and the Twilight Zone episode, were both based on the case of the \"Lady Be Good\" a B-24 that crashed in Libya in WWII after her navigator mysteriously failed to stop the plane from overshooting its base by 400 miles. The Libyans still have the remains of the Lady Be Good. There are two books out about this event. The movie, Sole Survivor, haunetd me for life when I first saw it at age 15 in 1970. I have two copies of it on VHS tape. It is shown in the U.S. on the Encore cable network from time to time. Interestingly, it is the navigator in Sole Survivor who is the bad guy. When the Lady Be Good was found, it appeared that the navigator didn't even do any dead reckoning. Whether he was incapacitated or not is unknown. As I recall, the bodies of some of the crew were found. The diary entries that Vince Edwards reads in the movie are similar to some of the real diary entries made by the crew of the Lady Be Good. I think this link between the movie and the real-life doomed crew of the Lady Be Good makes the movie even more poignant.\n\nEric Norris, Santa Clara, CA USA\n\nThe responders with \"The Sole Survivor\" as a CBS 1970 TV movie are correct. But there is a play on words in the title that nobody hit upon yet, although Malcolm is close. While the cowardly navigator (Richard Baseheart, in a post-Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea role) was the sole survivor of the downed bomber, the movie did, in fact, end with all but one of the crew-ghosts recovered (disappeared). The movie did close with a scene of the remaining crewman playing baseball by himself - the sole \"survivor\" among the \"ghosts.\" William Shatner, fresh from \"Star Trek\" was also in the film, as the investigating officer.\n\nSteve Williams, Washington DC USA\n\nOnce again, I have to disagree with both Eric and Steve. This is not the movie we are talking about. The film, which we are trying to trace has NO survivors. The final survivor out of the crew of ghosts, appears to have been left by the \"rescuers\" but as they drive away after apparently finding no trace of him, they find his body several miles away. This enable his \"ghost\" to disappear the same way as all the others. I say again in the film we are trying to trace there are no survivors at all. All the ghosts are released from their Limbo.\n\nRay Mitcham, Southport U.K.\n\nThis is obviously a story that inspires imagination. I remember it clearly from sick days home from school, back home in England. The good news. I found this on E Bay.\n\ncgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=1568369415\n\nEither bid on it yourself or keep on entering Sole Survivor VHS as an auction search.\n\nDouglas Smith, Skagway Alaska\n\nThanks, Ray. The film definitely has no survivors and nothing to do with a navigation error - it definitely has baseball in it and there are no survivors at the end, all the ghosts are laid to rest. Please keep insisting!\n\nDee, Manchester UK\n\nThe film the original question is trying to find is, indeed, \"Sole Survivor\", a 1971 TV movie that I have on tape and just watched again tonight; it's the only film of its kind. It's one of the best of the TV movies, and one of the earliest. Please contact me if you're looking for a copy of it.\n\nMarta, Omaha, Nebraska USA\n\nJeez, is Ray Mitcham still yammering on about this one? The Sole Survivor is Richard Basehart. The navigator. The only one who got out of the plane. The one who bailed out and left them lost. Get it now?\n\nMark Power, Dublin\n\nI cannot remember the name of the film, I saw it a long time ago, it may have been 1970 - or earlier, or both. I may be mixing up more han one version, but seem to remember William Shatner and Richard Basehart. My memory of the story is that someone (possibly a survivor) has come with a team to the bomber''s crash site to recover the bodies and possibly to investigate the cause of the crash. As each body is found the ghost (and they know they are dead) disappears. One of the crew does not expect to be found because he tried to walk out and his body was some miles away from the ''plane, but he is found. However, I do remember that the body under the collapsed tailplane is NOT found. I know that because the image of the single ghost left on his own in the desert really touched my imagination. I still find it horrible to think about. Perhaps, as there are those who remember all the bodies being found, another version was made with a sanitised \"happy\" ending. I don''t think it would have been as memorable as the original though. Sole survivor sounds about right.\n\nMary B, Leominster UK\n\nWhatever the name of this film is, one thing i remember is the ghosts of the departed crew being in awe of a helicopter that turns up at the crash site, with one of them remarking that it 'hangs in the air just like a bird' or something like that.Suggesting that when they died there were no helicopters in service.\n\nMike, Manchester\n\nI have a video of this film. It is indeed Sole Survivor starring Shatner and Basehart.\n\nGareth, Bedford\n\nWow! I remember this film, which I saw when it was shown on TV in the UK in the late 70s. I remember the plane (it was a B24 or B25) and I remember Richard Basehart, recognising him from Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. I dont remember William Shatner, which is odd as I was a real Star Trek fan as a young kid. I remember that one of the ghosts was not recovered... I think that the others had bailed out with a dingy, believing the navigator that they were over the water off the (Libyan?) coast. One stayed with the plane )the pilot?) and had survived the crash (the sole survivor?) he had taken shelter from the sun under the tail section, which broke off and crushed him. This is why the air accident investigation team didnt find his body. They couldnt understand how there were no bodies, until one of the investigators realised that the navigator (who had survived - the other play on the 'sole survivor' title) had got the position wrong - but he bailed out first and survived the drop. As I recall Basehart was the navigator. Yes, I too wish I could get a copy!\n\nBob Keeley, Ashford UK\n\nFinally! I thought I'd imagined this blasted movie! I remember watching it on T.V. when I was a kid (around 1976-77ish), and to be perfectly honest was beginning to doubt my own sanity whe all I got was blank looks from friends when I raised the subject. Details I remember are - one crew member survived and has returned to the crash-site with (I think) a USAF Graves Registration unit to recover the remains of the rest of the crew. As the movie ends, one ghost is left, his body is under the plane's tail section and the Graves Registation unit don't have the equipment to recover it, the camera pulls back and he starts marking out a baseball diamond in the sand. Does anyone know if it's available on video or DVD? I'd love to see it again.\n\nR.J. Beaton, Greenock Scotland\n\nThis page has just answered a quest I have had for over a decade - I've asked all sorts, including those who title themselves film afficiondos Its weird to see that so many other people have been trying to find the title of this film as well - a bit like our own episode of the Twilight Zone. I can rest easy now. Thanks again.\n\nBish, Dublin Ireland\n\nThe answer to a question that has been driving both my father and I mad for 15 years is finally found! thank you! I too have been told it was the Twilight Zone episode \"King Nine\", but have spent what seems an eternity searching the web for the real movie name. Now, where to rent it from...\n\nheather, bothell, wa usa\n\nI too have been trying to find this film for years - and am still confused! I agree entirely with those that say there were no survivors, and particularly with what Ray Mitcham says - that is spot on. Thing is I think the title was Flight of the Phoenix, but obviously NOT the film with Jimmy Stewart in, maybe a made for TV film with the same name? But also - not an episode of anything, it was a full length flm. So - anyone out there know about the film Ray and I are talking about!\n\nTrev, Selby\n\nI agree with Ray too. I don't think it is the film Sole Survivor. I have been searching for the answer too. I'm sure it is a black and white movie too? Does anyone else agree with that?\n\nNaomi, Leeds, UK\n\nGoing back to Steve Williams answer. The Movie opened with the ghosts playing baseball. Two of them walk in from the horizon and say that they cannot walk out of the dessert. They''re not sure now if they are alive or dead. The rescue plane shows up, and they line up at attention. The commander of the rescue mission walks down their row, lokking them up and down - then comments about the plane. You realize he never saw the ghosts and they realize they are dead. The middle part is mostly forgettable, but they try to communicate with the resue party. And you find out that everyone bailed. They were trapped in the desert. One of the crew goes to the plane wreck to try to find supplies. In the burning sun, he crawls into the shade of the plane, where he died. And was covered by sand - this is why the rescue party cannot find any bodies. Eventually one of the party thinks he sees the ghosts, goes crazy and hops in a jeep an flees. When the party catches up with him, he hasstumbled onto one of the bodies of the crew, where he parachuted and died. Back at the plane one of the ghosts says all he can see is a flag. The party drapes the corpse in a flag. The ghost disappears. The resue party then says, \"there's another\" Another ghost diappears and then the rest. The movie ends with the ghost who died at the plane (body not found) playing baseball by himself. Is it \"Sole Survivor\"? Not a clue.\n\nJim, Leesburg, VA USA\n\nYes, that is the one that I've been hunting for, I remember the one crewmember saying \"They''re touching me!\" right before he vanished. It has to be 25 or 30 years since I've seen it. It is definitely not TZ's King Nine but there are a number of similarities between the stories.\n\nFlight of the Phoenix has been offered by a number of people during my quest...but, of course Hollywood is about to release a new desecration - erm, version of that classic.\n\nJ. Steven Bonnell, Cincinnati, USA\n\n\"Sole Survivor\" I've been looking for it as well. Based on the recovery of Lady Be Good as mentioned above. The two TV movies are so similar they tend to blend in my memory as well.\n\nAl Kessler, El Paso, Texas U.S.\n\nBloody hell!! I don't know how many times I've searched the internet in vain trying to find out anything about this film, which has stuck in my memory from when I saw it at age 6 (in colour, full-length film so definitely not an episode of the Twilight Zone!). I've asked hundreds of people about it and most kind of vaguely remember it but no-one could ever give me any more details; none of the actors or anything. Like others, I remember the one guy being left behind because his body was under the tail of the plane - I think it was definitely that they couldn't find it, because there was no suggestion that they'd be back later with proper equipment to recover it. It was like this guy was doomed to spend eternity alone beside this bloody plane, slowly going mad... Thanks for at least giving me more to go on! There seems to be a fair old argument raging here as to what it actually is, but at least now it's narrowed down to 2 possibles!\n\nAlison Sage, Aberdeen, UK\n\nGood Lord! I thought I was the only one in the world who wondered about this! I've been looking for the answer for years. God bless the Grauniad.\n\nChy, Perth, Australia\n\nThe movie \"Sole Survivor\" deserves a release on DVD. I believe there is a generation of people missing out on this classic, I haven't seen it since the seventies. I didn't know the name, it's bugged me for years, I'm delighted I found it.\n\nWhy are there so many people who feel the same?\n\nGareth, Conwy, Wales\n\nI too remember a film 'Sole Surviver' about a man that lost his wife and daughter in a plane accident. When he tries to investigate he is pursued by some black op federal agents. The main agent was played by Billy Zane. The plot was of mind control and child experiments in a secret lab where people's minds were remotely controlled. The pilot of the commercial aircraft purposely crashed the plane because of his mind being controlled by one of the kids. In the end the man rescues a young girl, his own daughter's age, who was the 'Sole Surviver' of the crash. The film was a two-part TV film never reproduced for DVD or VCR. I have tried to obtain copies to no avail. If anyone does get a lead on this film and how to obtain copies, please let me now. It is an incredible film, not to be confused with 'Soul Survivor'.\n\nRobert Sirignano, Moreno Valley, USA\n\nThe movie is definitely Sole Survivor from 1970, with William Shatner, Richard Basehart and Patrick Wayne. Wayne is the pilot, Basehart was the nav who bailed out over the Med and left the others to crash in Libya. The Sole Survivor was played by Lou Antonio who was the tail gunner on the B-25 Mitchell and who couldn't rest because his body was under the tail section. They were all angry at Basehart's character Hamlin who had left them to die and who was overcome with guilt. A great TV movie which ITV shows about every ten years or so ! Does anyone have it on DVD?\n\nRobert Smith, Exeter, UK\n\nAt long last I find that my sister and I are not alone in our seemingly impossible task of finding out a) was this a movie or a 'Twilight Zone' episode and b) What on earth was it called??? The over-riding memory for us are 4 (or possibly 5) air crew during WW2 marooned in the desert next to their crashed plane. They spend their day playing baseball, then one by one they disappear until there is only one left. He is running around at the end trying to find his mates but they've all gone. This is because their bodies are found and they are laid to rest. However, the real sadness - and why we think it sticks out for us - is that the last one is never found because his body is under the tail wing. If this is a false memory then we are very happy but I don't think so. I always thought it was in black and white but hey, the memory fades after 30 years or so...\n\nFran, Richmond, UK\n\nI think there are two different films being talked about here. The one with the ghosts disappearing one by one rings no bells at all, but I do remember watching a film on TV when I was about 9 (so mid-70s)with William Shatner in it (and I think also some other actor from Star Trek) and being gripped by it. They had crashed in the desert and new their chances of rescue were slim but tried to help themselves. Then a rescue crew turn up and you're relieved until the twist, with the rescuers walking through the crash \"survivors\" and you realise they are ghosts. I think one of the rescue party says something about it looking as though they died instantly in the crash. I was really freaked out by the twist in the tale, and it has hovered at the back of my mind for years. I'm not sure that the film was called \"Sole Survivor\" though - and that wouldn't really tie in with my memory of the crash as I can't remmebr there being any survivors.\n\nAli, London, UK\n\nI can't believe so many other people are trying to find the name of this film. I watched this on TV about 25years ago and have always remembered it and tried to find out what it was called. It definitely wasn't Flight of the Phoenix because it is on tv at this very minute and it has prompted me to start looking again. The description of Sole Survivor sounds similar but I was sure that the film I saw was black and white. I definitely remember the navigator surviving because he had told the crew to bail out over the sea but in fact it was the desert and the crew haunted him when they realised they were dead. Maybe there are two versions of this film, the colour one and also the older b/w one, would love to know for sure.\n\nClaire, Nuneaton, UK\n\nHi all. I remember this film from years ago and thought it was brilliant is there anyone who could sell me a copy as it appears its the only way I'm going to see it again cheers.\n\nPat Lawrence, Weymouth, England\n\nThe movie I recall in black& white was the twilight zone.\n\nRick Clements, New Castle, USA\n\nI've been searching for this for years now! Definitely in the desert, they're definitely all dead but don't know it - I am sure it wasn't a twilight zone, sure it predates James Herbert, it looked like a properly released film but I did see it on T.V. so who knows - I'll keep checking for answers now I know I am not the only nutter in the vilage.\n\nSarah Bolton, London, U.K.\n\nEvery week, I look at the TV film listings in the hope of finding this film, trying to remember its name, every week the same nagging disappointment that I can never find it.\n\nHow curious to find I am only one member of a sect who was profoundly touched by seeing this film as a child in the 70s.\n\nThis phenomenon surely needs investigation -was there some kind of cold war subliminal message in the film that touched us all - is this why it is never shown now - any conspiracy theories?\n\nSimon Porges, Brighton, UK\n\nIt's great to know that I'm not the only one who so vividly remembers this film, but disheartening to know that the name of the film still eludes us. I am 100% positive that it is not Sole Survivor. It has broad similarities to that film (plane crash in the African desert during World War II) which has created a lot of confusion here. The plot is driven by the fact that the main characters are all deceased, and their bodies are being discovered one by one. As this happens, they disappear often with great distress as they feel the sensation of being touched or (as was earlier posted) they can \"only see the flag\". Baseball is also a dominant theme. One of the deceased had been playing either in the majors or for a farm team, and he carried his bat, ball and glove with him to keep in practice, with hopes of returning to baseball after the War. His batting average is discussed at one point by the rescuers, as I recall. I watched this movie with my Mom on TV in the late '60s or early '70s and it left a great impression. However she can't recall the name of the film or any of the actors. I even had her ask a friend who served in the war, but without success. I wonder if someone who works with a TV network could help...someone with access to archives? That assumes it was a made-for TV movie, and a friend has expressed doubt that they were making made-for-TV movies in the '60s. Any thoughts on my idea, or on whether this movie was ever released to theatres?\n\nCharlotte Goelz, Vancouver Canada\n\nSole Survivor.\n\nDebbie, Poole, UK\n\nI am another 25-year searcher who happened upon this string. Elated and dismayed. I also remember it as definitely being black and white. I remember that the under-the-tail guy's dog tags played a big role in the plot. But I don't remember William Shatner. Going to have to track down Sole (or is it Soul, as someone else suggested?) Survivor and check it out, but I fear that RM is correct and this is not the same film.\n\nRick Melnick, Painesville, OH USA\n\nThe film is 'Sole Survivor' and as it is public domain some people have transferred it from VHS to DVD and are legally selling copies on Ebay. Hope this helps.\n\nChas, Lancing, England\n\nI've also been looking for years and I thought the name from my youth was The Soul Survivor because of the man left behind under the tail.I also remember watching it in black and white although the TV I watched it on may not have been a color set.It seems this was CBS's first made for TV movie. I've also asked everyone if they remembered this movie to no avail. So glad you've restored my sanity, Thanks.\n\nFrank Christofano, Jeannette,Pa\n\nThanks for all the information that has appeared here. I have also been trying to retrieve a copy of the film, and if memory serves, the title was \"Soul Survivor\", not \"Sole Survivor\". This would also make more sense in light of the survival of the souls but not the actual flesh and blood crew members.\n\nTed McLean, Merrickville Canada\n\nI got it I got it! Have just today finished downloading it via bittorrent and now have a copy. I was right in everything I said in my earlier post except that the title IS 'Sole Survivor' with Vince Edwards and William Shatner. Have skipped to the end where the Capt is left on his own and starts to play baseball by himself (my most vivid memory of the film!) and it is the one that I have been hunting all these years ! Oh I'm so happy! (maybe I need to get out more?)\n\nMalcolm, Cardiff, Wales\n\nI won't add to the controversy about whether this is \"Sole Survivor\" or not. I remember both this movie, and the great performance of Bob Cummings in the Twilight episode \"King Nine Will Not Return\" (he carried the whole show in this episode that opened TWZ's second season). But here is a matter that might be of a little interest to everyone on this blog. In one of William Shatner's book, he related an episode of when he was having lunch with Vince Edwards and Richard Basehart during the filming of \"Sole Survivor\". A woman walked by them, looked at the three men, and while shaking her head said to her friend: \"And he used to be so famous!\" All three men looked at each other, and laughingly decided that she could have been talking about any one of them!\n\nGary, San Diego USA\n\nwell, ive just watched 'sole survivor' on dvd. its the one with william shatner playing an air force crash investigator. in this film it is clear that the crew know they are ghosts right at the start, and that its been seventeen years since the crash. the film i remember has the whole crew (no survivors) believing that they are still alive. it doesn't come to light that they are all dead until right at the end of the film when a helicopter turns up at the crash site and freaks the crew out (no helicopters in general service at the time of the crash) and the helicopter crew cant see the (dead) crewmen. there is a scene in sole survivor with a helicopter but this is half way into the film, long after the plane wreck has been found, and not the initial discovery.\n\nrichard, hull england\n\nThe answer is indeed Sole Survivor. I have it on VHS tape. Lou Antonia's character died when the tail of the crashed plane fell on him as he sheltered from the sun after having walked back to the plane for water. The pilot was a baseball player and had his ball, bat and glove on the plane. The ghosts played baseball everyday. Richard basehart abandoned the plane after arguing with the captain about returning to Italy (where they were performing a bombing run) instead of possibly crashing in the Mediterranean Sea. Basehart was the only survivor. William Shatner is the \"Brass shy\" investigator at the crash site. The ghosts taunt a drunk Basehart and he drives off in a jeep. The ghosts steer him north and he finds the rubber life boat out in the desert with Shatner and Vince Edwards hot on his trail. They find and bag all the remians except for Antonio's. Edwards is convinced by an entry in a diary found by their Libyan guide that the remaining corpse is at the crash site and proceeds to drive back. The film closes with Antonio taking up the baseball and bat, scratching out a baseball diamond in the sand and hitting the ball as the camera angle draws back and up into the sky.\n\nRandall, Denver USA\n\nThis film is NOT sole survivor. It was a black and white film. The crew did NOT KNOW they were dead. It was only when each of them was discovered that it dawned on them and they disappeared. Unfortunately there appear to be 3 films that have the same sort of plot..... Does anyone else remember this one??????\n\nmark groom, bristol England\n\nWell I'm more confused than I ever was, everyone seems to have a different answer. I suppose until I actually see the film again (which may never happen) I'm just going to have to have sleepless nights. I know I didn't imagine the movie and a friend of mine says he saw it too, so we are not all mad!\n\nKarl, Newton Abbot UK\n\nI am looking at the box of 'Sole Survivor' a made for TV movie starring William Basehart, William Shatner and Lou Antonio. The synopsis reads.... 'Shatner delivers a credible performance as Lt. Col. Josef Gronke, the head of a team of air force investigators that fly to the site of a wreck of a b-24 bomber that crashed in the Libyan desert, stunning the world with its discovery 16 years later.'....etc. The story starts with the crew awaiting rescue, not really believing they are dead. Basehart is the navigator who baled out on them during an attack by fighter planes, surviving 36 hours in the waters of the Mediterranean before being picked up as the sole survivor of the crew. The film was produced by Cinema Center 100 Productions and also stars Vince Edwards as the major who is determined to get to the truth, which he does in the end.\n\nSandra Johnston, Fife, Scotland\n\nThank you! Thank you! Thank You! I too have wondered about this movie for years! I was watching Back to Eternity this evening and thought I would search just one more time. In years past I have asked everyone I know if the plot sounded familiar and just gotten those blank stares. Man, I was getting ready to write a novel around this great plot since it was looking like the movie was all in my imagination! By the way, I remember it in black and white too. Funny, no other movie affected me like this one...I think at 9 years old the twist at the end when they finally understood they were ghosts really impressed me. There is one more movie from my childhood I think about... about a thing in a closet and a womans head hooked up to a bunch of tubes...???\n\nAmy Johnson, Columbus, USA\n\nWow! I'm so glad to have found this discussion. I have asked people for literaly at least 15 years about this movie and they all think I'm nuts. I saw it in the 70's when I was a kid and the twist was amazing at the end. It is the first movie I remember that had a \"sixth sense\" type ending! I will be trying to get ahold of the recommendations above. I hope one of them is the one I remember. I know it wasn't the Twilight Zone version though since this was a full length movie I remember. Thanks so much everyone!\n\nLetzel, TX USA\n\nThe film is Sole Survivor and is available on ebay, I saw it last night for the first time in about 25/30 years. I remembered it clearly, it's the kind of movie that stays in your mind. There might be a few different versions of this film around due to commercial breaks some footage may be missing in some versions. Let's hope it will get a proper official DVD release one day, fully restored and with plenty of extras.\n\nEdmund , Cheam United Kingdom\n\nMy partner and I both remember this film from our childhood but have been unable to find anyone else who does. Thank you for confirming that we didn't imagine it. Would love to see it again.\n\nUna, Dublin Ireland\n\nThank you everyone, I too have been looking for this movie, Sole Survivor. Where can I get a copy in Aus? Have been looking for it for years but didn't know where to look until I stumbled across this discussion. I came on this movie when it was about half way through and it has haunted me ever since.\n\nAllan Spindler, Port Macquarie, NSW Australia\n\nIT IS NOT 'SOLE SURVIVOR'. William Shatner was not in it. It was filmed in B&W. It was not an episode of the Twilight Zone. Please, can anyone remember the name of the B&W version, and stop telling us we watched Shatner in a colour version? There is obviously more than one version of this film, and I am not after 'Sole Survivor'. The 'survivors' did not know they were ghosts until they started to realise that they could not leave the area of the crashed plane. They did play with a baseball. At the very end of the film one ghost was left alone in the desert as his body was never recovered. Please help?!\n\nDuff, Derbyshire, UK\n\nHi everyone. I watched the Flight of the Phoenix recently all the way to the end hoping it was the film I remembered - waiting for the twist! Course it didn't happen. The description of sole/soul survivor just don't seem to fit in with the fact no-one was alive and the twist definitely came right at the end. I just wish I could see it again ...\n\nCabby Luxford, Horley, UK\n\nIm 41 and remember watching this film with my mam, i thought we were the only ones to remember this no matter who we asked, glad i found this thread at least i know i'm not totally mad. There appears to be 3 differing opinions here, the main things that sticks in my mind are the lone airman with the baseball at the end and the film was in black and white, this seems to rule 'sole survivor' out in my mind. sorry cannot be anymore help at the moment but will keep searching as i would love to see this again !!\n\nAndy, Toft Hill England\n\nSole Survivor - as many ppl have clearly stated. You think it was in b&w because most ppl still had b&w tvs back in the 70s when it was shown. There are no other \"versions\". http://imdb.com/title/tt0065007/ CASE CLOSED!\n\nNick Morgan, Sutton UK\n\nI have just watched \"Sole Survivor\" It's in colour, never new that, since we had a black and white telly back when I first saw this film. I am 100% positive that this is the film we are all talking about, I just think our young minds back then don't quite remember it exactly, because I was sure they didn't know they were dead either. But yes this film ends with a guy with baseball bat, his body not yet found. Got it for e-bay for £9 (April 08. Just wish I could get a better quality DVD.\n\nPaul Taylor, Stone UK\n\nOkay - Last week I went and bought a copy of Sole Survivor to satisfy myself - and it's not the same film!!! Case NOT closed. The original black and white version is still out there somewhere, with some very important differences from the colour/William Shatner version. The simple fact that so many people remember it in black and white should indicate that there was such a version - not that we are all deluded and remembering wrongly from years ago..!\n\nDuff, Derbyshire UK\n\nSole Survivor seems to be available at: http://www.learmedia.ca/product_info.php/products_id/907\n\nDoug Thomson, Kitimat Canada\n\nI just had sole survivor delivered to me and raced home to watch it in the hope it was the movie I remembered, It was not.......I am now crushed as I don't think anyone remembers the name of the movie. For those of you who wish to buy a copy of Sole survivor, I bought it off ebay. The plots of the two movies are similar, but the crew in Sole Survivor knew they were dead. I seem to remember a barrier in the other movie that the crew could not penetrate. Maybe we should make our own movie!\n\nJen, St Peters Australia\n\nMark Groom and Richard (both of england) we are with you. we have the DVD copy of \"Sole Survivor\" starring Shatner and Basehart (DVD legit from e-bay). It is NOT the one as described in this original thread, as the bodies do not disappear one by one in \"SS\". it is a \"6th sense\" ending, where the twist is saved up until the very end, and the AUDIENCE realises the cast are actually ghosts. We're still in search of the movie in question.\n\nJacinta Leong, Sydney Australia\n\nI believe there are two films with almost identical storyline. I've also been trying to track this one down for many years. The original question at the top of this list has two key points that I remember very well from the film I've been searching for. 1) The crew definitely didn't know they were dead until the end of the film, and 2)when their bodies were found each one began to slowly fade, becoming translucent until they eventually disappeared completely. I've just bought and watched a copy of 'Sole Survivor' (with William Shatner) and it is definitely not the film I'm looking for (although it is almost identical in storyline) as they know right from the beginning that they are dead and they don't fade, they just suddenly disappear off-camera. If anyone ever finds this film, I'd love to know. If though, you've been looking for 'sole survivor', its on e-bay for less than fiver.\n\nPhil, Lichfield Staffordshire\n\nIncredible! I've been thinking about this film since I was a kid (I'm 35 now). I think I only caught the end of the movie and it left such an impression on me I vowed to watch the whole film one day. Every now and then it would pop into my head and I would think I must try to find the name of it sometime. So, tonight finally I type in a long-shot search into Google and stumble across this thread! I can't believe it! I so agree with many of you who thought this film was a figment of their imagination. What was it about this film that hooked us so much - I mean, I was a little girl, my main joy was my Cindy dolls, ballet and ponies - why would a movie about war, airplanes & dead pilots leave such an impression?! Anyway, after reading all your posts I've just been on eBay and bought a copy of Sole Survivor. I dont know if it's going to be the one I remember, but I'll let you know when I've received it and watched it - fingers crossed.\n\nAnita, London UK\n\nInteresting I've been looking for the same program and stumbled into this site. The television program I remember was performed as if live, in a studio and if I remember correctly was in the middle 60's. Plot was as mentioned before airmen don't know their dead and disappear as they are found until one remains because his body is not recovered. Sure would like to figure this one out.\n\nTim, Riley United States\n\nI think I may have found it! Ghost Bomber:Lady Be Good, Armstrong Circle Theater episode 301, season 11. First aired Feb. 3, 1960. Star? George Segal. Sounds about right to me. Thats all for now, trying to find a way to get that episode.\n\nTim, Riley United States\n\nFinally I have some answers. Nice to know that other people are interested in the same story. I made an 8mm flyby shot of the same idea as a teen. It looked real too. But my interest is more personal too. Ogden is the same way. Once you're here you can never leave. If the Mormon's run you out of business as they did to me you can never get a meaningful job to make you any real money to get away from this place on. I feel like one of those guys. Dead and can't never get away. I wish somebody could find me & bury me so I could leave. By the way I was fired today from another job. There seems to be no end to this. You may think that Utah is picture postcard beautiful but once you're trapped in this postcard you can never get out of it. I am real, I am Steve Nelson. I want to be alive again.\n\nSteve Nelson, Ogden, Utah USA\n\nBoth my brother and I have been keeping each others' sanity on this one for years. We watched it about thirty-odd years ago, with our mum and nan, in my nan's living room at Christmas. I remember it so clearly. Unlike most, we remembered the title, but couldn't find it anywhere - not even in filmographies and what-not. It was driving us mad, until we discovered references like these!!! I'm off to buy a copy!!!!\n\nJo, Corringham, UK\n\nI started thinking about this film after visiting a WW2 aircraft crash site in the far north of Scotland (near Gairloch). It is a war grave, and there is still debris from the plan scattered over the hillside and the loch. But back to the film. This is what I remember. It is black and white. The crew do not know that they are dead. As their bodies are discovered, they \"vanish\". They do play baseball, and the guy with the mitt and ball does not get found. I don't think it was called \"Sole Surviver\", I think the title was longer and might have had the name of the plane.\n\nAlison, Biggar, Scotland\n\nAfter hearing the arguments presented on this site and laughing myself silly: YES, IT IS 'SOLE SURVIVOR' but most here seem to not want to believe it. I have it, it is exactly the film as described (Basehart, Shatner etc). There is no other, don't keep arguing it, I think many people's memories have been faded over the years.\n\nAndy Themistocleous, London, UK\n\nI didn't read EVERY response but the movie Sole Survivor was made in about 1969 and based on a true story (history channel episode) about a plane wreckage of a B-25 or 24/26 that was found in the Libyan desert by an oil exploration team in about 1963. In the movie, one crew member had bailed out over what they thought was ocean and was rescued (hence sole survivor) and the rest of the crew went down with the plane and were ghosts. Great movie!\n\nMike Lefebvre, Horn Lake, USA\n\nSoul Survivor is not the film. I remember seeing sole survivor at the time it was shown on TV in the 70's and was disappointed that it wasn't the film I remembered. The film as I remember was in Black and white, my parents only had colour TVs, and only at the end of the film the crew realised they were dead. No scenes of helicopters and no scenes of rescue.\n\nMathew Stanley, Portsmouth UK\n\nIt is not sole survivor. I remember it on TV in the late 70s, and we had a colour TV, it was black and white and the crew did not know that they were dead. I remember it being a class film, but don't remember the name, ghost bomber rings a bell.\n\nPhil Salmon, Crewe, Cheshire\n\nI think Ghost Bomber was an Armstrong circle theatre episode and not the other (apart from Sole Survivor 1970) war movie regarding a crashed air crew in the desert. I have seen Sole Survivor and I know it is definitely not the movie some of us are looking for. In the movie I am looking for, there is no sub plot about the navigator getting out of the plane before it crashed. The \"rescue crew\" appeared at the middle of the movie and there is no helicopter. When each crew member remains are found they simply disappear. The movie was in black and white, as I remember the TV I was watching it on was colour. I hope someone knows the name of the movie as it has been driving me crazy for years.\n\nJen, Cronulla Australia\n\nI dont think you all are speaking of the correct movie that the original fella was looking for ... Indeed there appears to be a similar movie called Sole Survivor with Shatner & Baseheart  and indeed we all may have seen it (and therefore are getting them mixed up). I think I recall baseball as well, perhaps even a helicopter, but I cant recall if it was color or black and white ... could have been the TV! :) But the one thing I recall in the movie, was that though they tried many times to walk to safety, they couldn't venture far from the plane and always ended up back at the crash site. Can anyone that found & viewed the 1970 Sole Survivor verify that it had this scene in it? Till then, Ill just have to keep pulling out the ol Dennis Weaver / Duel movie to get my nostalgia fix :)\n\nJoe, Pittsburgh, USA\n\nThe plane was called the home-run. The pilot couldn't stay in pro-ball because he couldn't hit an inside fastball. Great movie and it was called Sole Survivor.\n\nMichael Lowery, Reynoldsburg, Ohio, US\n\nI have no answer, I wish I did! I am watching Sole Survivor as I type and I know this is not the film I am looking for. Can so many of us really have it wrong? I am certain it was black and white - we only had colour TVs. I am even more certain that neither we, nor the airmen knew they were dead until they began to vanish. I too have asked, and searched, and all in vain. Sole Survivor (1970) is very similar, but it seems to me to be a remake given \"Hollywood\" treatment. They've taken a story that absorbed so many because of that twist, and they've jazzed it up to a haunting and revenge plot. This is not the film that I remember. Please, someone somewhere must know the older one?!?!?\n\nHeidi Bayliss, Stafford, UK\n\nWell, this is the closest I have gotten to a movie that I saw at least 35 years ago and have wondered about since. I guess I am pleased to know there are others out there who thought it was worthy of wonder too.\n\nJeff Olson, Minnetonka, Minnesota USA\n\nJust wanted to say thanks for this because for years it has been driving me mad , and I have just bought it on DVD on eBay and can confirm it was indeed the film... Cheers!!\n\nKev Mayo, Hereford England\n\nI too am amazed at what an impression this lost/forgotten, and hence apparently unworthy, film has had on so many people.. I don't know whether the film I am searching for is the same as the original posters but I too remember it in B&W.. I also remember them ABSOLUTELY NOT knowing they were dead until the very end when they're cheering their rescuers then get completely ignored... This film can't be 'Sole Survivor' as so many people are now watching that and saying it isn't, so stop telling us it is!\n\nAdam Macer, Golden, Canada\n\nI'm amazed that we can't find the name of this movie and also that SO many other people remember it so vividly from seeing it once in their childhood. I too remember a film, in B&W, that didn't star Shatner, that had a great twist in the end. I don't remember the helicopter but the crew were invisible to the 'rescue' party. It definitely wasn't Sole Survivor. Surely someone can think/knows of a source, in Hollywood perhaps, where we could direct this question to.\n\nAdam Macer, Golden, B.C, Canada\n\nYep, been driving me crazy for all these years too. It must be Sole Survivor as no other suggestions have been forthcoming. From memory, the last crew member was left alone with his baseball & bat as his skeleton was stuck under the tail; the ghosts definitely did NOT know they were dead; I remember it in colour but your mind can plays tricks especially as you were probably only 7 or 8 when you saw it. Was it Sole Survivor? Now about to find out as it is available on Google...\n\nAndrew Moreton, Carlisle\n\nDid you see the one where people were reading thousands of posts insisting a movie was Sole Survivor, but the readers were looking for the name of the OTHER movie with ghosts, sand and an airplane... but it turns out the readers had really died of old age reading so many Sole Survivor posts? Seriously, we saw Sole Survivor. I remember the one thought that kept crossing my mind: \"I sure wish this was that OTHER movie with ghosts, sand, and an airplane!\"\n\nRob Crawford, McKinney, Texas\n\nMarta in Nebraska, if indeed you have a copy contact me and let me and the others know how to get a copy. As you can see everybody is looking for it.\n\nShaheen Butt, London, UK\n\nI remember watching this in my youth in the UK. A very melancholy ending. The \"Sole Survivor\" video on YouTube in 9 parts (with part seven being itself split) is not what I remember. The ghosts had to stay close to their skeletons, and all but one skeleton was driven away in trucks. It was very sad for the one friend left behind.\n\nGraham Perks, Austin, USA\n\nB&W or color? Perhaps folks did not have color sets? Or, we were relegated to viewing on the old TV in the cellar? Well, this is the closest I have gotten to a movie that I saw at least 35 years ago and have wondered about since. I guess I am pleased to know there are others out there who thought it was worthy of wonder too.\n\nJeff Olson, Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA\n\nI recall the scene with Richard Bassheart driving drunk off into the desert and the crew disappearing as described that they wanted all of them to be found, that in trying to solve the mystery of the missing crew they find the personal effects of each on the plane including a harmonica. That the searchers couldn't understand why the crew thought they were over water until they figured out the moonlight and clouds that the sand looked like water. And that Bassheart was the navigator that bailed out on them and that the crew haunted, I swear it was a 70's TV movie, it may have been color, as others have said I don't recall the title or having seen it again. It led me to the book about the real crash of the Lady Be Good and its facts. It might have been mentioned in the opening or closing credits.\n\nPeter Kelly, Blair, USA\n\nI can not believe I found this site where you all are looking for the same movie I've been searching for for years. A show I remember watching as a child on a rainy Saturday afternoon . The movie so intrigued me because of the twist at the end and stuck with me all these years. I thought that surely I'd see it again but have not. What I remember was that the bomber crashed in a jungle or forest and the men did not know they were dead until the end and they all disappeared one by one. Don't think Shatner was in it because I was a big Star Trek fan also. It would be so awesome if someone out there knew the name of this movie.\n\nWayne Lowe, Youngstown, Ohio, USA\n\nHow frustrating! I was hoping by the time I had got to the end of the discussion that the film would have been found. I told my daughter that she must watch 'Flight of the Pheonix' as I thought that it was this film, and I was so disappointed that it was the wrong film. I remember that they crashed because they thought the heat from the dessert sand was the sea, and they were trying to crash into the sea. And I remember the twist at the end being so good as I didn't have a clue that they were really all dead until the army came to clear the wreckage and they were invisible ghosts! I would love to see this film again... has been a long time.\n\nFrancesca Cutts, Orpington, UK\n\nNot an answer, just can't believe so many other people are trying to get hold of this film! Think I saw it in early 80s aged 11 or 12. I'm glad it's not just me it left a lasting impression on.\n\nGlynn Turner, Beverley, England\n\nI saw this movie...I'm also trying to figure out the name. It streams instantly on Netflix, and I can't remember the title, but thought the ending of LOST was a rip off of the plot, LOL. They have a support group of the survivors and each one disappears (evidently as their issues are resolved) and the psychologist leading the group is the last to figure out she's dead too.\n\nDawn, Florida, USA\n\nAny one found it yet? (no not the sole survivor one!) Could it be \"ghost bomber\" from American TV's the \"Armstrong Circle Theatre\", although would that would be shown in the uk in late 1970s - early 80s. Also I think that title would be a bit of a giveaway to the surprise ending. Come on people let's find it....Please!\n\nmark groom, Bristol, England\n\nAmazing that this film impacted so many of you as it did me! I was 13 in 1979 when I saw this movie and fixated by films at the time. That year I carefully logged every film I saw, on what date, I even gave it its own critique. My late father kept this 'log' of mine in his loft until he died last year. I never ever forgot that movie and have spent the last 30yrs asking friends, family video dvd stores etc etc if they know it! I can however confirm with absolute truth that the film was called Soul Survivor and was made in 1970 shown on UK TV in 1979. It was about the crew of a US WW11 airplane crashing into the desert and in short never realising they had died until the modern day 'rescue' team arrive at the crash site. It was sad, intense, exciting, magical and for a 13yr old it left a memory of joy and sadness and a feeling of 'who knows'. I loved it and wish I could see it again to see if it truly is a great film or if you have to 13 to be wowed by it!\n\nShaz, Kent, England\n\nThe film I'm looking for is definitely a black and white film. I have been looking for this film for years. The characters did not know they were dead. I remember my my mum jumping up saying \" They're ghosts!\" although a lot seems similar to sole survivor, it's not quite right. I think there must be 3 films that we remember .I remember that someone walked away from the plane only to find themselves back where they started.I also remember they disappeared as they were found. for years i thought it was flight of the phoenix. but having watched it recently is a very different film. I'm sure it's \"flight\" something though.\n\nAmy McGrory, coventry england\n\nI have had this memory as well for the last 20-30 or so years! I understand the concept that our family might have only had a B&W TV, but I remember it filmed in the style of B&W - you know, it's recognisable. I too do not remember Captain Kirk in the film I saw. Sole Survivor is the duplicate stoyline- down to the harmonica. I too also remember that the ghosts disappeared one at a time. That is what made the fact of him being left alone so horrible- it was slowly happening slowly enough so they all finally realized they were going to leave the plane and they began to recognize the guy under the tail of the plane would not be found. It was agonizing!!!! Nothing like the ending I saw in \"Sole Survivor\"!!!! Personally, I thought the film was called \"then there was one\" or \"then there was none\".... but I have yet to find ANYTHING on this title. I'm gonna keep looking thanx all for assuring that I'm not nuts remembering this movie.\n\nBrad B, Chicago, US\n\nThere are more than one Sole Survivor movie. The film discussed here--a B-25 crashed in the desert during WWII with the ghosts of the crew trapped near the plane--is definitely one of them. I worked on the movie which was directed by my friend and mentor Paul Stanley and featured Vince Edwards, Richard Baseheart and William Shattner. It was a great experience spending a month in the desert on the El Mirage dry lake bed. See: http://emcpb.blogspot.com/2010/10/sole-survivor.html This was the first of a series of TV movies made by CBS referred to as CC100s (Cinema Center/100 minutes). As far as I know, it has not been released on DVD.\n\nStephen Mitchell, Los Angeles, USA\n\nTo watch the full Sole Survivor movie (in ten minute increments) go to: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6A_qNAQCGU&feature=&p=756ADCCEE736818C&index=0&playnext=1\n\nStephen Mitchell, Los Angeles, US\n\nI have just watched 'Sole Survivor' on google videos and after only a few minutes realised it was crap and definitely NOT the film I remember. The film that was so good we were all moved by, began with the plane flying over what they think is the sea but is the rolling sands of the desert. They think they can jump out with a lifeboat. They DO NOT know they are dead right to the end of the film, which is what makes it so good and definitely not like the weak 'Sole Survivor' plot. I think it is 'Flight of the ?' because I was surprised when I discovered it wasn't 'Flight of the Phoenix' as an adult. Please stop telling those of us who have seen this amazing film, that it is Sole Survivor. It definitely isn't!!!!\n\nCollette, Fareham England\n\nOkay everyone... Let's get this straight right from the start - I am also looking for this film, I have bought and watched Sole Survivor, and IT IS NOT THE SAME. Being a huge Star Trek fan as a child I would clearly have remembered something as important as William Shatner being in a film I had enjoyed so much. He wasn't in it. Also, the film was in b&w, not colour. We had a colour TV at home, and did not own (at any point) a b&w one. Can people responding please stop being patronising and telling half of the contributors that their memories are incorrect, or that they must be wrong about whether or not they had colour or b&w TVs? For some people here Sole Survivor is the film they saw and remember - great, no need for you to contribute anymore - but for the rest of us the search is not over and the film title remains a mystery. The original post is clear; the crew did not know they were dead until they slowly realised that they could not leave the site of the crash no matter how they tried; and as their bodies were discovered by rescuers they disappeared one by one, until one ghost was left by himself at the crash site because his body was never recovered. I agree that this bears remarkable similarities to Sole Survivor, but they are not the same film. After having bought Sole Survivor to satisfy myself of that I was left disappointed. So, does anyone else out there have any ideas please? And let's not have another flurry of Sole Survivor posts - after having seen both (and there's nothing wrong with my memory), they are different films.\n\nDuncan, Swindon, UK\n\nI watched the \"Sole Survivor\" on YouTube and it is NOT the movie I remember. I'm with the folks that remember the returning back to the plane and the bodies discovered one by one. But through my life I did remember the title as Sole Survivor so there must be other versions. The big question is if so, why is only the Shatner version still around while the others are gone.. anyone at CBS have access to other copies?\n\nken, williston vermont usa\n\nI also am looking for this film and was convinced it had the word 'catch' in it, I thought it was catch-22 but I have since found out that that is a comedy and I am clearly mistaken with the title but it's still driving me crazy! I saw it about 30 years ago and have never forgotten it, it was B and W and it was a feature film.\n\njessica dodd, brighton uk\n\nThis movie has been driving me crazy too. I remember just the way described by some here. The belly gunner was the only ghost left at the end. It was a real spooky ending.\n\nGodfrey, Chicago USA\n\nplease somebody! put my mind to rest like those poor guys in the movie! Are we all insane! is this movie real!\n\nKay, West Kelowna, Canada\n\nWell, having posted this query...and not having seen Sole Survivor (or not) I would like to thank all those looking in and who have answered my query but I still think that the answer is buried under the plane. What is driving me mad now is that I also believe it is referred to in another film, mid 80's possibly, where someone says, when seeing a movie on black and white tv, 'Hey, I remember this...the guy is buried under the tail of the plane.' So is this a case where the film IS actually Sole Survivor, but the on-screen reference has sown a seed that is making us all think we have seen the film ...but with a different ending?\n\nJulian McCarthy, Kingston upon Thames, UK\n\nI am so pleased I have found this thread, I have been searching for this film for years like others, doubting my sanity. It is clear from the threads though that there are two films not one which people are searching for. The one I saw was the one where the group do not realise they are ghosts until the very end when the helicopter turns up. It was indeed in black and white, and the moment that one of the answers mentioned 'flight of the phoenix' I immediately recognised the title even though it was almost forty years ago now. I am sure many people are actually looking for 'sole survivor' but the one i've been searching for was flight of the phoenix.\n\nDavid Rhodes, Nottingham, UK\n\nI can confirm the film is not sole/soul survivor. The original black and White film was shown in the uk pre 1968 and followed a different plot to sole survivour. The b52 and crew crash land in the desert , try to walk away but always return, try to fix the plane, then start to disappear slowly. Eventualy the remaining crew think they are rescued. However the rescue party find the remaining bodies and bury the surviours - who all disappear. It is not sole survior\n\nFilm buff, Marbella, Spain\n\nDefinitely not 'Flight of the Phoenix'. James Stewart, Hardy Kruger, Dickie Attenborough, etc. (If you haven't seen this watch the original and not the remake!). Anyway...I (we) know it is not the film. Absolutely astounded at the posts but no clear answer. Anyway, lets keep looking, the answer is buried but we will get there!\n\nJulian McCarthy, Kingston upon Thames, UK\n\nyou can view sole survivor on you tube here's the link! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6A_qNAQCGU&feature=related\n\nRobert Copland, Musselburgh, scotland\n\nThank you for this, I remember that movie from growing up and, like you, I could never remember the name or find it in any database.\n\nRich Joyner, New Hope, US\n\nJust found this page and read it with great interest. No I don't have a definite answer but I'm pretty sure there is something very strange going on with this film. Just mentioned it to my father, with whom I watched the film back in the eighties here in the uk. 'Oh', he said, you mean the film with Richard Basehart?? I confirmed this and said yes and it also had William Shatner in aswell and was called Sole Survivor.He was adamant William Shatner wasn't in the version he had seen(as was I after viewing it on Youtube).He was pretty sure it wasn't called Sole Survivor either. The thing is, if there is another similar film in existence, surely it would be on the internet somewhere??? William Shatner was definitely not in the version that I saw. I can vividly remember that none of the guys even realised they were ghosts until the end, although one guy was stuck under the tail, just like the Soul Survivor film.\n\nJason Merchant, Grays, Essex\n\nThere seems to be a number of variants. I recalled a Black and White version and the actors having the 'perfect english' reminiscent of the old war films - I recall the crew sitting under a sheet under the wing of the plane and talking about not being able to leave the dessert... maybe its the 1968 one mentioned by the Film buff in Spain\n\nAshley, Orpington, UK\n\ngo on net type in soul survivor 1970 film then go to external links click on sole survivor google video then you can watch it\n\nchris, faversham kent\n\nNot looking good - reply to query to the American Film Institute: Thank you for your interest in AFI.

But those in this thread that are looking for a different, yet similar, and presumably better (and older?) film have aroused my curiosity, which it seems cannot now be satisfied. Oh well... Too bad they don't make 'em like they used to, eh?\n\nBrandon, Berkeley, CA USA\n\nIf anyone says its the film 'Sole Survivor' again i'll either shoot myself or kill the wife !

I know it is NOT Sole Survivor or any other mentioned so far. This film WAS black and white and made in the 1960s. The story line was 6 crew members that played baseball around a crashed WWII bomber. They couldn't go very far away from the plane though and had to always return to it. They did NOT know they were dead. That was the twist, and the viewer never knew they were dead either. One by one the crew disappeared as each body was discovered until the last one was discovered under the tail of the plane.\n\nPhil Carter, London England\n\nWOW and I thought I was the only one who was searching for this..... I haven't read all the comments above but I agree, and for the sake of Ian Collis I won't state the name....... ok I will, it's 'Sole Survivor'. Within minuets of finding this add, I also found the link below with the film.... how ironic, or luck but this is the film I was looking for even if it's not what some of you were, hope it is though as it does drive you crazy over time not knowing. http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7574338161920794843#\n\nMartyn, London UK\n\nIt is Sole Survivor.

Excellent!\n\nMark Frank, Manchester UK\n\nEnjoy I've ordered from Play . com thanks Paul. The story describes the struggle of several men to survive an emergency landing of their airplane in the Sahara desert. Frank Towns (James Stewart) is the pilot, and Lew Moran (Richard Attenborough) navigates. The passengers are Capt. Harris (Peter Finch) and Sgt. Watson (Ronald Fraser) of the British army; Dr. Renaud (Christian Marquand), a physician; Heinrich Dorfmann (Hardy Krüger), an aeronautical engineer; Mr. Standish (Dan Duryea), an oil-company manager; and several oil workers. The workers include Trucker Cobb (Ernest Borgnine), a mentally disturbed foreman; Carlos (Alex Montoya) and his pet monkey; and Gabriel (Gabriele Tinti). The struggle is complicated by a personality clash between Towns, who is a proud old traditionalist, and Dorfmann, a young, equally proud technician. The film begins as Towns pilots a twin-engine C-82 Packet cargo plane from Jaghbub to Benghazi in Libya. A sudden sandstorm destroys the right engine and threatens the left one, forcing Towns to crash land in the desert. As the aircraft descends, oil drums break out of their restraints, severely injuring Gabriel and killing two other workers. With no functioning radio to call for help, the survivors wait to be rescued, but the storm has blown them too far off course. Their water will last 1015 days if they avoid physical exertion. After a few days, Harris sets out with Carlos to walk to an oasis. Harris and Towns refuse to let Cobb go along, but he follows later and dies. Days later, Harris returns to the crash site alone, barely alive. Later in the film, he and Renaud will be killed by some passing Arabs. Gabriel eventually bleeds to death, while Watson manages to avoid risking his life with Harris. Meanwhile, Dorfmann has been working on a radical idea: He believes they can build a new aircraft from the wreckage. The C-82 has two side fuselages, one extending from each engine, that are connected at their tail ends by a fin. Dorfmann's plan is to attach most of the right wing to the left engine, fuselage, and wing, discarding the rest of the aircraft. Harris and Moran believe he is either joking or deluded, and the animosity between Towns and Dorfmann erupts as the two men insult each other. With Renaud's advice that activity will help the men's morale, Towns agrees to the plan. Dorfmann supervises as the workers cut, haul, and weld parts of the aircraft. The work stops when Dorfmann admits taking extra water, but Towns resumes it after Moran convinces him that they have no other hope. Throughout the ordeal, Moran mediates the conflict between Towns and Dorfmann. When the new aircraft is almost complete, Standish labels it \"The Phoenix\", after the mythical bird that is reborn from its own ashes. Dorfmann loses his temper and stops working after Towns recklessly insists on testing the engine, which requires several explosive cartridges to be started. There are not enough cartridges for a test. With prodding from Moran, Towns allows Dorfmann to take charge. Towns and Moran fear the worst when they learn that Dorfmann designs model airplanes and has no experience with full-size aircraft, but, with no other options, they let him continue. Just as the water runs out, the Phoenix is completed. Dorfmann panics when four cartridges fail to start the engine and Towns wants to use one cartridge to clear the engine's cylinders. Dorfmann protests, but Towns ignores him and fires one cartridge with the ignition off. The sixth and final cartridge succeeds. The men pull the Phoenix to a nearby hilltop, then climb onto the wings. When Towns guns the engine, the Phoenix slides down the hill and along a lake bed before taking off. The film ends after the Phoenix lands at an oasis, where the workers jump into a pool of water while Towns and Dorfmann chat\n\nPaul knights, southampton england\n\nThis is baffling me. It's not \"Sole Survivor\". (But I can understand why some people think it is.) Soul Survivor makes it clear from the beginning that the crew KNOW they are dead and that they've been stuck in limbo for 17 years. In the movie we are trying to find, the big twist at the end is that the crew (and the viewer) suddenly realise they have been dead the whole time. For the life of me I can't find the title of the film though!\n\nPaul Young, Stockport Cheshire\n\n\"Sole Survivor\". This is by far one of the best movies ever. I saw this as a youngster and still remember it some thirty years later. The movie IS available for purchase on the web at silveragemovies.com for about $13. Also, someone was kind enough to upload it to Youtube. Just search for Sole Survivor part 1; the successive parts will be linked.\n\nMichelle, Saint Paul, Minnesota USA\n\nWhile many people insist it was \"Sole Survivor,\" other (and more) articulate people are just as confident that it was not, and even brought up some details about the film I saw that I hadn't mentioned to the people I was asking about this over the past few years. Interestingly, many many of you remember it being called \"Flight of the Phoenix,\" as did I; and some (like myself) gleefully found and watched the newer film (but not the recent remake) with that name, hoping it was what we remembered. But alas, of course, it was not. Here's my theory: this excellent film, which we know was excellent not only for its plot (which engaged me even as a pre-pubescent female uninterested in war stories, so it must have had gripping dialogue and interacton), but because it has lingered with us so vividly for almost 50 years, was called \"Flight of the Phoenix,\" and then when another screenplay using that title (based on the real plane with that name) came along, this one got shelved permanently (or destroyed). Parts of it apparently were changed and incorporated in the later \"Sole Survivor,\" which however differs markedly in that the \"survivors\" actually know they're dead. (As some pointed out, this was the original \"Sixth Sense\" film story.) Intellectual property was probably less well-defined in those days and if the film had had a different name, maybe it would have survived. Wonderful to find vindication (as many post-ers on the site stated) that I am not crazy, or at least not with regard to this particular item. ;)\n\nPamela, Saint Louis USA\n\nVery strange, because I also remember that the movie we're wanting the name to had the twist at the end where the realisation kicks in, for the crew, that they were dead all along. In the film Sole Survivor, the crew already knew they were ghosts from the start. What doesn't make sense is that it would appear that two movies, made at around the same time, would have almost identical plotlines. I'm scratching my head.\n\nBlueBoy, Stockport, UK\n\nHi guys here is another version of a film 'Sole Survivor ' It Is the story of television producer, Denise Watson (Anita Skinner), who is the only survivor of a horrific airplane crash en route to a new production job. Denise is certain see saw the bodies of all the dead passengers still moving around after the crash but this is written off as shock by her doctor, Brain Richardson (Kurt Johnson) whom Denise soon falls in love with. Strange occurrences soon begin for Denise as she begins to feel she is being followed by someone in grim reaper mode trying to claim her since she wasn't supposed to survive the crash, a revelation from the resident \"koo-koo\" actress, Karla Davis (Caren Larkey), on the new commercial Denise is in charge of shooting. This edgy and stylized 80's horror film is the clear basis for the more modern Final Destination franchise. Will Denise be able to survive her date with death or find an escape before it is too late? Yep another version of the same name\n\nDave Diamond, Carnoustie Scotland\n\nI stumbled upon this thread in search of a black and white movie where the a plane crashes, the pilot dies, and two other men survive the crash. They discover tons of cash in the plane, or on the pilot, and the plot is about how the money affects the friendship. I realize this is off-topic. However, regarding the controversy of whether or not you all are talking about the same movie or two or three different movies... YOU CANNOT PROVE A NEGATIVE! No-one can tell another person that they are confused because they have seen the movie from their memory. You can't say that your memories are the same as each other. You can't say that another similar movie does NOT exist simply because you watched one of the two. STOP telling people there is only one movie that can fit this description. If you have found the movie from your memory, that's great. But you cannot tell someone else that there is only one possible movie they could be talking about. As long as the POSSIBILITY exists for there to be more than one movie, you cannot tell them otherwise.\n\nTony, Dayton, OH USA\n\nNo answer, but it isn't Sole Survivor. I saw it many years ago but we had a color TV and it was black and white and not a TV episode but a full feature film. Hope someone comes up with it because I loved the movie and would love to own it.\n\nRobyn, Arizona USA\n\nSorry I too am unable to find the film or title most are looking for, black and white for sure. Saw it as a kid and like the ghosts I too have been waiting ever since,best film ever.\n\nMark Rooney, Isle of wight UK\n\nThis thread is hilarious! You can't tell some people can you? So, it isn't Sole Survivor (either version), King Nine Will Not Return, Flight Of The Phoenix (either version), so what the heck is it? I am fascinated now....\n\nLouis J B Dobson, Faro Portugal\n\nAnother voice here confirming that Sole Survivor is NOT the film that many of us are seeking. I ordered that and watched it this afternoon, and, good as it is, it ISN'T the film in which the characters gradually realise they are dead as their bodies are found. The two films are so similar, though, it's seems likely that they are based on the same root story.\n\nNick, London UK\n\nThere is another!! Sole Survivor (though an excellent TV movie) is not the only movie with this captivating story line and the ghostly, or should I say ghastly, ability to make men have a mid life crisis trying to remember the movie title. The other similar movie does not have Bill Shatner in it, nor do the crew members know that they are dead (about 16 mins into Sole Survivor one of the crew members states we are dead), and each crew member disappears as their bodies are found in the desert. Many people seem to be accepting Sole Survivor as the title for this other movie, causing great confusion, but this movie does exist and is being denied its name being spoken by the Sole Survivor! (what is the name of this other movie?)\n\nMe, Here In This Place\n\nIt is a Twilight Zone episode called \"King Nine Will Not Return.\" It starred Robert Cummings who stars as a downed pilot of a World War II bomber who travels to the desert to find out what happened to his crew. He sees them and then they begin to disappear. It was made around 1960. Does that help?\n\nRobin Kircher, Bogart, Georgia USA\n\nIt's not \"sole survivor\".But,I did want to add some of my recollections.The beginning scene was the bomber crashing in the desert.They all get out of the plane and figure they won't be found.So,they need to find a way to fix the plane.The plane had the numbers 477 or something close to it....I thought the title was \"phantom fight\" something.I do know as a fact.The movie was black and white,the ENTIRE crew were dead and DID NOT know it until the very end of the movie.It was in the very early 70's that I saw this movie but,that doesn't mean that's when it was made.There was a narration at the beginning,whether it was a \"Twilight Zone\" or \"Outter limits\" airing..I don't know.Maybe we never will.\n\nrobin, new york usa\n\nWatch the entire movie, \"Sole Survivor\" at http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7574338161920794843 or http://tinyurl.com/cr749g\n\nFred Bothwell, Georgetown, Texas USA\n\nJust some historical data with references to Sole Survivor and Twilight Zone. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Be_Good_(aircraft)\n\njames, las vegas america\n\nI just got done watching Sole Survivor and I agree this is similar, but definitley NOT the movie we are looking for. Add me into the list of stumped individuals, but I agree that it was not revealed until the end of the movie that they were dead, unlike sole survivor. I also remember the \"other\" movie being B&W.\n\nJohn Griffin, New Britain\n\nOh how disappointing, I was hoping there would be an answer for me here. I too remember watching this film as a child in the 1970's an have been trying to find it for years. I've seen Sole Survivor and Flight of the Phoenix. It is most certainly neither of these. The film I'm looking for was black & white and the airmen did not know they were dead. That's the big twist at the end. I'm fairly sure it was a feature film too, not an episode of Twilight Zone. It was shown on a weekend afternoon. I hope someone can get to the bottom of this one!\n\nGennie, Suffolk UK\n\nRight this has bugged me for ages, a few things threw me 1st I remember it in black and white and as a big trek fan I was sure I would remember Mr Shatner in it, but no so I never even checked if sole survivor was the film as for the main part it was colour? after watching it on utube I am convinced this is the film but its in colour right ?? then it hit me as a lot have said including me it was in the 70's and black and white ?well everyone I know never got a colour tv until the late 70's uvula! not made in black and white but watched on a black and white tv. I thankyou! Oh and the shatner thing hardly even in it lol\n\nMark Rooney, Isle of wight UK\n\nOk all, definitive answer time as I have been obsessed with this film for years. The film is indeed sole survivor a 1970 tv movie. The reason why the difficulty in identifying it is that there are TWO versions of the film. The original tv American movie had the survivors knowing they were ghosts and haunting the survivor. The film was released in Europe to the cinemas in 71, and was re-edited so the crew did not know they were dead, thus changing the entire aspect of the film. Love both versions and have a very grainy vhs copy of the bbc in about '82, hope this helps Paul\n\npaul watkins, crick england\n\nLets just make one thing clear the film is not soul/survivor, I watched this film for which we all seek on a colour tv in either 1977 -78, this film was black and white end off. I remember the brilliant twist at the end and I've never forgotten it, I remember one of them saying its all going dark as 1 by 1 they where found and put into body bags with 1 left behind under the tail end of the plane and I'm sure he shouts look under the tail but obviously no-one can hear him and the crash team leave and he is left with this baseball bat and ball. It's haunted me for over 33 years this film and its not the bloody twilight zone either, I've searched everywhere for it but seems to have vanished!\n\nfergus roberts, chorley united kingdom\n\nI watched this movie on tv when i was about 12 and have been waiting for a re-run ever since (i'm now 44!). The U.S.A.F. crew have crashed in the desert, playing baseball while waiting to be rescued. They realise they are ghosts because no-one gets hungry or thirsty. People eventually turn up and recover their skeletons (they disappear when the bones are taken away). One skeleton isn't found and the movie ends with him throwing a baseball to himself when the rescuers leave (he is the soul survivor!)\n\nDean Watkins, Coventry, England\n\nThe movie is called Passengers starring Ann Hathaway and Patrick Wilson.\n\nJohnny Smith, New York, USA\n\nHave just put in a search for this movie which I remember seeing in my youth. I'm now 44yo. I have not yet watched the suggested 'Sole Survivor' but will do after making this post. What I remember is the guy at the end with the baseball glove and ball. I also seem to remember that the survivors were slowly going mad and if I'm not mistaken there was a lot of whistling of some tune or other. I watched it in black and white - because that was all we had at the time I think.\n\nGeoffrey McNicholl, Dungiven, Ireland\n\nI just watched 'Sole Survivor' on YouTube and whilst this is similar to the movie I remember - it is not it. This seems to be a re-make of the original - whatever that was. The music is not correct - it was a weird tune that was whistled if my memory serves me right. This was 30 years ago! There were also no US troops carrying bodies with American flags draped over them at the end. I would have remembered this. Please let me know if anyone unearths the original movie - which was probably from the 50's going by my memory of the actors. There was a plane that flew overhead though but they could not get their attention.\n\nGeoffrey McNicholl, Dungiven Ireland\n\nSo Paul Watkins gave the definitive answer: a 2nd version of Sole Survivor re-edited for cinema release in Europe. But this version must have been also released for TV broadcast in parts of the US. For it was there that I saw the black and white version described earlier where the bomber crew does not understand that they are ghosts till the end as they disappear one by one when their bodies are recovered. This re-edited version was way better than the more available version because of that \"Sixth Sense\" ending that was referred to earlier. It's plot was smoother as well probably also from the excellent re-editing job. I don't get why it was in black and white(seen on my colour TV)if it was a cinema re-release but I am happy to have a rational answer to the puzzle. Now, someone must find this version for those of us who crave re-experiencing this childhood movie magic.\n\nTim McDonald, Robbinsdale-Minnesota USA\n\nI remember the film and have been trying to find the name of the film for years. I don't believe it to be Sole Survivor, the film was clearly a sixties or even fifties movie. The crew of the doomed plane crash landed in the desert, all the crew appeared to have survived the crash, trying to make the best of it and await for their rescue, when it arrives they are discovered dead in and around the wreckage, and then one by one disappear; a bit like the film really. I would to see it again though.\n\nRobin Palmer, Rugby, England\n\nAnd I thought it was just me\n\nBryan Lindley, Doncaster, England\n\nDefinitely black and white. Not the William Shatner remake. The final scene has the last undiscovered guy, buried under the tail, desperately trying to direct the bloke to his skeleton, screaming at him, with no success as of course he remains invisible. Also, when they are discovered one by one, they fade away, saying goodbye to their mates. I seem to remember it having \"flight 401\" or something like that in the title, but he gets left there alone with his baseball. Quite how this movie has disappeared without trace is spooky in itself.\n\nAndrew Close, Sydney Australia\n\nI too have been haunted by this movie I saw in the late 60s or early 70s in the USA. I recently stumbled upon \"Sole Survivor\", watched the whole thing (google tv) and was convinced the mystery was solved, though it wasn't exactly how I remembered it and I didn't remember Shatner being in it (Star Trek fan). As I read this whole thread I realized that I had the same memory as others, the crew didn't know they were dead, and maybe they were working on the plane and that they disappeared one by one, not all at once like they do in Sole Survivor. I remember them tossing the baseball more. And definitely not an investigative camp set up next to the plane. So, now I'm thinking my mystery isn't solved but it is interesting how many people have been haunted by this movie (both versions).\n\nBill Stuart, Cincinnati, Ohio USA\n\nIt is not Soul Survivor. Having watched the 1st 10 mins of SS, it definitely isn't SS. All of those who also say it isn't Soul Survivor you are not going mad. I am 45 and this a been bugging me for years.\n\nDoug Allison, Okehampton United Kingdom\n\nAnyone seeing \"Sole Survivor\" in the UK in 1970 or thereabouts would almost certainly have seen it in black and white which may explain why it keeps getting mixed up with a Twilight Zone episode. It's possible that there are several versions of it in circulation which have been edited, with varying degrees of incompetence, to fit tv time slots (I'm not convinced by the \"theatrical release\" idea) which make the story end earlier than in the complete version. But the movie in question really is \"Sole Survivor\". Common sense suggests that a movie with such a similar plot, sought by so many people, would have surfaced long before now if it actually existed. Sadly, it doesn't: it's just the vagaries of broadcasting and some memory glitches creating a myth.\n\nStephen Haigh, London UK\n\nBorgnine was NOT , I repeat not a flight engineer in Flight of the phoenix. The movie I asked about is based on the true incident which took place in the Everglades in the early 1970s. I believe it also had Kim Basinger as a stewardess who survived the crash.\n\nAllan Myers, Mobile USA\n\nHi guys, this has been driving me mad too, saw it with my dad in Sweden when I was young in the 80s, he must have seen it before because I remember him saying \"this is a great movie\" Here is what I think it is. THe original film (B/W, people not knwoing theya re dead until the end, screaming to direct him to the tail but ending up alone) is in fact an episode of Armstrong Circle Theater with George Segal called \"Ghost Bomber\" , Season 11, Episode 7, Aired Feb 03, 1960. There is a description from tv.com \"Douglas Edwards narrates the film clips in this documentary about one of the great mysteries of World War II. In 1943, a B-24 bomber returning to Africa from a bombing run in Italy disappeared just a few moments from it's scheduled landing. A search for the missing plane was eventually called off when no evidence of it crashing could be found. Last year, it was finally discovered in the Libyan desert, 400 miles from its intended destination. The radio was still workable, the coffee drinkable, but no evidence of its crew could be found.\" Someone mentioned a narration in the beginning, could it be a Rod Serling type intro? I dont belive this was a documentary in the true sense, more like a re-enactement. Then they probably remade it 10 years later in color. There are some inconsistencies though. According to the Wikipage of the LBG, all but one crewman was found, so far in line with the adaptations. But that second to last crewman was found in August 1960, several months after the airdate of the show, so I find it slightly implausible that the shows plot would center around a last missing body. We need to speak to George Segal!\n\nTimothy Atkins, Båstad, Sverige\n\nAllen Myers, The film you are looking for about the airliner crash in the everglades is \"Ghost of Flight 401\".\n\nLarry Warren, Chattanooga, TN, United States\n\nWow! Can't believe I've found this thread, I've wondered about this film for years. There are definitely two different films being discussed here, mind you, and the original answer to the question posed is not Sole Survivor. I can remember watching this film and I can also remember what it's called. There is a very good reason why no one can find it in any database and that's because it shares the name of a very famous film which will dominate any internet search results. The film is called Catch 22, not to be confused by the famous 1970 film of the same name. Saw it listed sometime back so settled down to watch. Of course it was the 1970 film I was watching. Disappointment. Hope this helps.\n\nPaul Kennedy, Newcastle Upon Tyne England\n\nIn my recollection Treat Williams was in the movie, and that's the search that brought me here. I don't know if that helps narrow things down? Definitely in color, and the ghosts disappear one by one.\n\nJon Evans, London UK\n\nJust read your earlier post, Jessica. You should have stuck to your convictions, you were 100% right with recalling the title as Catch 22.\n\nPaul Kennedy, Newcastle Upon Tyne, England\n\nThis film has haunted me since I saw it 40 years ago. I have tried to find out what movie it was for 20 years, with no luck. I had just about given up when I tried a bunch of words on google and this page came up. I am surprised that I'm not the only one who has wondered about this movie for so many years. I was a young child when I saw it and the memory of them disappearing as soon as a flag was draped over their body or casket has had a life long effect on me for some reason. I would love to see this movie one more time. Thanks so much for starting this topic and thanks so much to all those who answered the question. Now I can finally put the question of the name of this film to bed forever. Thank you, Bob Bowen.\n\nBob Bowen, New York, USA\n\nThis should answer most people's question, a complete storyline and lots of info on this cult classic http://totalscifionline.com/features/5327-cult-movie-vault-8-sole-survivor-1970\n\nBob Bowen, New York, USA\n\nTwilight Zone series 2. Episode 6a. King Nine will not return. Drove me mad for nearly 30yrs trying to find this. I had the memory of it but not the title. I thought it was a film too.\n\nDean Marriner, Newcastlen Upon Tyne, England\n\nI remember the film so well. It was the talk of school playgrounds after airing on Brit TV. It's not a feature Hollywood type picture. In the 70s, \"Made-for-TV\" films were popular, and frequently shown. I'd love to see it again. Googling \"made-for-tv\" with the title might help.\n\nChris Pass, Uxbridge, UK\n\nHi, been looking for this film myself for a long time, it was very impressive. NOT SOLE SURVIVOR AND NOT FLIGHT OF THE PHOENIX, not sure why it is so elusive with so many people looking for it, seems someone could find it. I'm 71 and I saw it many many years ago, old movie. People keep trying, and good luck. Going to keep looking on this site.\n\nmavis, kenai, AK US\n\nI too am haunted by the memory of this film. And I agree,the title was Catch 22. It must have been in the late 1960's on TV. I remember their spirits disappearing traumatically one at a time as their bodies were discovered. And the poor soul that is left behind by himself for eternity... that's what's so haunting about it. My question is this: How is it possible, this day and age, for a film that was so unique and admired to simply vanish with no trace?\n\nRandy , Denver, CO USA\n\nI remember with clarity, a boy 9 or 8 roasting some bird eggs on a hot rock and eating for survival after a plane crash and gets to be a survivor in the film. But can't remember film name. Can anybody?\n\nRajiv Joshi, Mumbai, India\n\nCan someone ask William Shatner? I remember watching this film when I was a kid, I was sent to bed early for being naughty or ill? Can't remember much about the events surrounding watching it BUT I DO REMEMBER THE FILM. Everything except the NAME. So if ANYONE knows then TELL us, put me and loads of others out of our misery. Either that or could someone invent a time machine big enough for us all to fit into, that way we can all go back to the 70's and watch it again together, this time I promise to be good mum. Scrimmy\n\nScrimmy, Scotland, UK\n\nThe movie youre looking for may well be Passengers (2008) starring Anne Hathaway. Ive been on a similar quest for this plot-line, and this is the one I was seeking. The \"survivors\" disappear one by one, as their spirits acknowledge the fact that they're dead. Have a look at it here: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0449487/\n\nLee, Prescott, Arizona, US\n\nI have also been looking for this movie. It was so haunting. I seem to remember that they had a radio and would listen to baseball games. Could be wrong on that part. But would love to see it again.\n\nBarb, Wayland, USA\n\nI just watched Sole Survivor and am convinced that's not the movie we're looking for. The one I saw was b&w, didn't have William Shatner or Patrick Wayne in it. The crew did not know they were dead til the end.... I also watched Twlight Zone's King Nine and that's not it either. That only has one lone guy in it...... This is crazy that no one knows the name of this movie.\n\nTrisha Richardson , Abilene, Texas USA\n\nSpooky have just been thinking about this film. Watched it a long time ago and would love to see it again. Definitely NOT Sole Survivor NOR a Twilight Zone episode. American aircrew crashed in desert. Playing baseball around plane. Didn't know they ere ghosts. Disappeared one at a time as their bodies were found by an 'investigation' team. Will pesevere with trying to find title.\n\ngordon, hereford england\n\nThe movie was Sole Survivor, and actor Vince Edwards was in it. Robert Cummings was in the episode of Twilight Zone I don't remember the title, I think it was called \"The Ace of Spades won't be coming home\", but he was in the Libyan desert near his crashed B-25.\n\nDale, Kannapolis,NC USA\n\nDear me! I wish any future contributors would have a very good read of the above Comments before they say anything else.\n\nPaul Kennedy, Newcastle Upon Tyne England\n\nI agree with the men not knowing that they are dead and remember the film as. So g in b&w for most of it and only being in colour at the end when the rescuers arrive and I think John Wayne's son was in it. I so have been trying to find out the name of this film for years\n\nI am yet another middle aged male who remembers this film from my youth. I was at prep school in Con-necticut when this mad-for-TV film aired. I am now a retired U.S. Navy Sur-face Warfare Line Officer and, as such, I am a font of useless and obscure military knowledge. Without any doubt the film in question was \"Sole Sur-vivor\" starring William Shatner, Vince Edwards and Richard Basehart. The aircraft was a twin engined B-25 Mitchell Medium size Bomber used throughout WW2 by the U.S. and her allies. I remember discussing the film with a class-mate by the name of Brent Taylor on our way out of a Bi-ology class. I never saw the movie again. I have, however, attempted to locate a c"
