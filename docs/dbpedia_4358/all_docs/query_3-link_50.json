        "text": "Water Safety and Gold Panning\n\nRecord snowfall is expected to bring high, fast rivers and streams this spring, which is why California State Parks / Division of Boating and Waterways, the Department of Water Resources (DWR), and Cal Fire are urging the public to take extra precautions and to be aware of cold-water dangers this spring to avoid a tragedy.\n\nWith the excessive snowpack and rain this year, rising water levels in rivers and streams will be very cold, very fast, making any activity at the water's edge potentially hazardous including gold panning. These conditions can easily overwhelm those who aren't prepared or don't heed warnings. All Californians are being encouraged to wait until it's safer to recreate in the summer.\n\nPlease plan ahead, know the water, now your limits, know about life jackets, and supervise your children in and around open bodies of water. Let's all make safety a top priority when recreating this spring.\n\nGold Discovery Tour / Gold Panning\n\nDuring the spring months, due to the high volumn of school groups visiting the park, the Gold Discovery Tour and/or Gold Panning may not be available to the public. Please call ahead to determine availability.\n\nGold Discovery Tour\n\nMarshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park is pleased to offer visitors guided walking tours at 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. daily! This is a 45 minute walking tour of the park.\n\nOur Gold Discovery Tour tells the story and visits the sites of the Coloma Valley before the discovery of gold by James Marshall. Learn about the events leading up to the discovery, the history of the California Gold Rush and the town of Coloma.\n\nTours are offered at least twice a day, weather permitting (tours will NOT be given when the temperature is above 95 degrees). Tour cost is $3.00 per adult and $2.00 per child. We do not give tours on our event days including Coloma Gold Rush Live and Christmas in Coloma. Please come enjoy those events. Please call 530.622.3470 for availability.\n\nGold Panning Lessons\n\nLearn how to pan for gold by taking a 15 minute lesson with us, then spend the next half hour panning the troughs looking for garnets, fools gold, and real gold flakes!\n\nGold Panning lessons are being offered most days at 10 am, 11 am, 1 pm, 2 pm, and 3 pm. Please call 530.622.3470 for availability. Lessons are on a first come first serve basis for the public. For groups please call (530) 622-3069 to make a reservation.\n\nGold panning lessons will NOT be available when the temperature is above 100 degrees.\n\nThe World Rushed In\n\nJames W. Marshall discovered gold in 1848 on the South Fork of the American River in the valley the Nisenan Indians knew as Cullumah (beautiful valley). This event led to the greatest mass movement of people in the Western Hemisphere and was the spark that ignited the spectacular growth of the West during the ensuing decades. The gold discovery site, located in the still visible tailrace of Sutter's sawmill in present day Coloma, California, is one of the most significant historic sites in the nation.\n\nIn 1848, James W. Marshall found shining flecks of gold in the tailrace of the sawmill he was building in partnership with John Sutter. This discovery changed the course of California's and the nation's history. See a replica of the original sawmill and over 20 historic buildings including a mining exhibit, Chinese store exhibits and schoolhouse exhibit.\n\nVisitors have the opportunity to pan for gold in the American River and enjoy hikes and picnics under the riparian oak woodlands. Overlooking the beautiful river canyon is the Marshall Monument, California's first historic monument and the final resting place of James Marshall. The statue looks down on the river and points to the site of the gold discovery.\n\nPark Information\n\nThe best place to start your tour of Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park is at the visitor center and museum. Interpretive exhibits and programs tell the story of the gold discovery and make it come alive. Information about and a map of the park can be found in the visitor center.\n\nAbout seventy percent of the town of Coloma is included in Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park and therefore subject to use fees. Since there are only about two hundred year-round residents in the town, the tree-lined streets of the park are memorably quiet and serene throughout much of the year.\n\nThe park features buildings that have survived from the gold rush, as well as many other reminders of that tumultuous period. The Gold Discovery Museum features gold-rush-era exhibits as well as exhibits on the Native Americans, the people of many cultures who came to California during the gold rush, and the agricultural history of the area. A number of films about the gold discovery and early mining techniques are also available upon request.\n\nClick here to see our volunteer opportunities\n\nPark Improvements\n\nIt doesn't matter where your adventure takes you at Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park, you are likely to find staff and volunteers hard at work making improvements to the park's structures and facilities.\n\nEmmanual Church\n\nSt. John's Church\n\nThomas House\n\nMining Methods: Stampmill\n\nSigns and fixtures\n\nLearn more about the recent improvements at the park.\n\nGet Social with Marshall Gold Discovery SHP\n\nVisit the park virtually by following us on social media.\n\nJunior Ranger Program\n\nAll youngsters are encouraged to become Junior Rangers at Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park.
