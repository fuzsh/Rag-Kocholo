        "text": "What do you get when you cross a Taylorcraft with a Howard DGA and then toss in a little B-17 for flavor and looks? Well one thing is sure; you don't get another Cub-clone of the type that populated the years directly preceding the big last shoot-out. What you do .get is a two-place light airplane that doesn't know that it's \"light\" and goes about its business like a heavyweight. This, of course, is both good news and bad news.\n\nThe good news first: The Commonwealth Skyranger 185 is cheap, both to buy and to own. Also, it's a great little keep-you-working-machine that'll teach you more about flying than any of its peer group. After running around at 4.5 gallons per hour your hand's, feet and sensory perception will know as much as they would have learned in the cockpit of an airplane of much larger dimension. Also it'll keep you awake every second you're on the ground and won't Iet you forget it's a taildragger. At the same time it's not about to be such a bugger that it'll amputate your feet at the knees every time you go flying. Also if you do make a mistake, or the eighty-five horse Continental decides to let you down into the trees, a Commonwealth will carve an airplane-size hole through wha-ever it hits and let you exit the other side, disgruntled but in one piece.\n\nAnd now for the bad news: The bad news affected the old Rearwin Company more than it does us today. It seems- when Rearwin first certificated the airplane in 1940, they stepped out of character, not only for their own company but also for the industry in general. They offered the Skyranger to the civilian pilot training program (CPT) but the government wanted little to do with it. Rearwin's theory of building a heavy airplane feel into a light airplane didn't go over too well on some government levels. The exact reason may never be known but in all probability the government wanted to stick with airplanes that all flew the same: the Cubs, T-Crafts, and Interstates that they were using. They may have felt that the Skyranger would have been like tossing a shark in with goldfish. Whatever the reason, the Commonwealth Skyranger holds the dubious distinction of being just about the only airplane design offered for the CPT program that didn't make it. The up-shot is that, before the shooting began, Rearwin built only fifty Skyrangers and then diverted their production to more pressing war-time needs.\n\nAfter the war, Rearwin geared up to start building airplanes for the aviation boom that didn't come. Reportedly, they were stretched out and sold the company to Commonwealth who proceeded to take those airplanes which were already on the line, as well as a few others and ultimately produced 250 post-war Skyrangers. Although the survival on Commonwealth Skyrangers is probably lower than something like a Cub or Taylorcraft. It's still a safe bet that at least half of the 300 produced are still floating around and represent excellent buys for anyone looking for a classic/vintage flying machine that's a little \"different.\"\n\nAlthough several hundred were built,you see very few Skyrangers any more.\n\nFOR THE PAST FEW YEARS, WHENEVER I WENT TO visit the Mosers at Aero-Sport in St. Augustine, I'd see this blue and white \"thing\" flitting back and forth with this guy at the controls who seemed to be at peace both with himself and the world. The airplane seemed to represent a lot of that peacefulness. Periodically, Ed Hogan would walk up and ask me if I'd like to go fly his Commonwealth. I'd fumble some sort of answer and then I'd sidle up to Jim Moser, proprieter of the place. and ask out of the corner of my mouth, \"What's a Commonwealth?\" That went on for an embarrassing number of years because I seemed to have formed some sort of mental block against the Commonwealth. I had the damnedest time trying to remember its name. I seemed to lose it somewhere in Porterfield/ Interstate/Rearwin/Commonwealth territory. It wasn't until I took a break in the harried proceedings of learning the ins and outs of a 260 horse S-2B Pitts, that I finally was able to avail myself of Hogan's generous offer and meet the aerodynamic character that is Commonwealth Skyranger.\n\nWalking around the Skyranger it's easy to be fooled. With its big tail, fabric covered two-place side-by-side fuselage and conventional configuration there is nothing about it that hints that this being a different breed of airplane. To anyone used to the T-Craft/Cub/Luscombe genre of flying machines, it'd be very easy to hop into a Commonwealth and find a few surprises waiting for you.\n\nThe commonality the Commonwealth has with its peers is carried right up to the boarding process which is just that—a process. There were damned few airplanes designed in those days that gave any thought to getting into the airplane. Stuffing yourself through the door the first few times presents variations on your basic breech delivery.\n\nOnce inside the machine there is no doubt that you are \"inside a machine.\" Most of the controls are conventional but somehow bear a vaguely machine-like quality to them that may be indicative of the airplane's original intended role as a CPT trainer. The fuel shut-off, for instance, is a healthy chunk of square tubing with a \"T\" handle welded across the end of it that pulls in and out the right side of a panel. It moves at least six inches. The panel itself has the vibration isolated center instrument cluster such as that generally found on L-5 Stinsons, Stearmans, etc. Even when starting you find that this was not designed with your average ninety-pound lady in mind . . . pulling out the T-handle starter requires a healthy tug which might find some folks putting their feet against the panel and pulling with both hands. Again, this may be part of the you're-in-the-Army-now syndrome although a few other airplanes do have this same T-handle (arm breaker) starting system.\n\nOnce the 85 Continental is running (they also came with a 75 Continental and 80 Franklin), you find the taxiing is straight forward for the type (tail down, nose up, blind to the side and do-the-best-you-can). There is no doubt that you've got a giant tail behind you, as the cross-wind starts puffing on that broad surface. Because of that, one of the modifications Hogan made in re-building the airplane was converting the Goodyear not-quite brakes to Cleveland almost-brakes. He says it wasn't worth all that effort but, in a heavy cross-wind, a stab of brakes now and then is necessary to keep it headed where you want to. Otherwise it will weather-vane and put you crossways during taxi.\n\nTakeoff could best be described as a bit of leisure excitement. With eighty-five horses in the nose and a gross weight of 1,500 pounds acceleration is modest. This is just as well because the excitement comes because you have to work just a little bit harder than you expect to keep it headed directly down the runway, especially if there is any cross-wind. Here the plane is not a lunch eater but, like the Luscombe, its takeoff is not a spectator sport; you have to get right in there and play the game. Personally, I find it to be a much more satisfying type of feeling, than say a Taylorcraft, which feels like a second cousin to a maple seed in the same situation.\n\nLeisurely is probably equally adequate in describing the climb of the Commonwealth. Although I didn't time it, it would appear to be in the neighborhood of 300 to 450 feet a minute. Which means during the summer you find yourself looking for factory buildings and black fields to provide you thermals to augment the climb performance. For all the things the Skyranger 185 is, there is one thing it is definitely not—a mountain flying airplane. Floats would just about cancel out its climb with two people aboard.\n\nThe Skyranger is a fairly heavy airplane for the 85 hp but does better than you'd expect ."
