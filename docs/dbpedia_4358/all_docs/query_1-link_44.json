        "text": "Early work\n\nSturges attended Marin Junior College (now College of Marin) on a football scholarship. In 1932 he joined RKO, where he worked in the blueprint and art departments. He later was a production assistant for David O. Selznick before eventually becoming a film editor. During World War II, Sturges served as a captain in the U.S. Army Air Corps, where he directed more than 40 documentaries, most notably Thunderbolt, on which he shared the credit with William Wyler; the classic film was shown to troops in 1945 but was not released in theatres for two more years.\n\nWhen the war ended, Sturges signed a contract with Columbia, where he was put to work on a number of genre pieces. The Man Who Dared, Shadowed, and Alias Mr. Twilight (all 1946) were low-budget crime dramas. In 1947 he directed For the Love of Rusty and Keeper of the Bees, both of which were child-driven human-interest stories. Best Man Wins (1948) was based on Mark Twain’s “The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County,” and it starred Edgar Buchanan as the peripatetic gambler. The melodrama The Sign of the Ram (1948) featured a wheelchair-bound Susan Peters (who had been crippled in a real-life accident) as a manipulative wife and mother who uses her condition to control those around her. In 1949 Sturges made the first of his many westerns, The Walking Hills. The box-office hit starred Randolph Scott and Ella Raines as treasure hunters searching for buried gold in Death Valley. Next was The Capture (1950), a crime drama set in the American West, with Lew Ayres as a man who kills a coworker whom he wrongly accuses of robbery and later is himself unjustly blamed for a murder; Teresa Wright was cast as his coworker’s widow.\n\nBad, Magnificent, and Great\n\nAfter moving to MGM, Sturges made Mystery Street (1950), a crime drama starring Ricardo Montalban as a Boston detective investigating a murder and Bruce Bennett as a forensics expert at Harvard. Right Cross (1950) was a boxing picture about a fighter (Montalban) who imagines prejudice because of his Mexican heritage; June Allyson played his love interest, and Dick Powell played his best friend, a cynical sports reporter. Sturges’s other film from 1950 was The Magnificent Yankee, a solid biopic about Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., with Louis Calhern portraying the jurist and Ann Harding as his wife.\n\nKind Lady (1951) was a period suspense film, in which Ethel Barrymore portrayed an elderly art lover who is held prisoner in her home as a group of thieves (Maurice Evans and Angela Lansbury, among others) plot to steal her collection. The People Against O’Hara (1951), adapted from an Eleazar Lipsky novel, centred on a lawyer (Spencer Tracy) who turns to alcohol to cope with the stresses of a murder trial. Sturges then contributed one of the eight episodes in the epic production It’s a Big Country (1951). The Girl in White (1952) was a modest but well-done biography of New York City’s first woman doctor, Emily Dunning, with Allyson as the hard-nosed pioneer who worked in a slum hospital. Sturges was on more-familiar ground with Jeopardy (1953), a thriller that featured Barbara Stanwyck as a wife and mother who is menaced by a killer (Ralph Meeker) while on vacation in Mexico. Fast Company (1953), a musical comedy about horse racing, was a mismatch of director and material. Escape from Fort Bravo (1953), however, was better, a solid western about the U.S. cavalry battling Native Americans; it starred William Holden and Eleanor Parker.\n\nSturges’s breakthrough film was Bad Day at Black Rock (1955), a taut psychological western about anti-Japanese prejudice in the postwar years; the cast included Tracy, Robert Ryan, Ernest Borgnine, Lee Marvin, and Dean Jagger. For the critically acclaimed film, Sturges received his only Academy Award nomination for best director. Underwater! (1955), however, was far less memorable; the deep-sea drama starred Jane Russell, Richard Egan, and Gilbert Roland. Slightly better was The Scarlet Coat (1955), a Revolutionary War drama about Benedict Arnold; Cornel Wilde played a colonial spy. Sturges returned to the Wild West with Backlash (1956), which starred Richard Widmark as a gunman looking to avenge his father’s death.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Corral (1957), an epic account of the 1881 shootout in Tombstone, Arizona, that made heroes of Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday. The western, which was scripted by Leon Uris, starred Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas as Earp and Holliday, respectively. As with many of Sturges’s classics, it provided exciting action without sacrificing character development. The film also centred on a common theme of Sturges’s work: men banding together to face a challenge. In his next project, The Law and Jake Wade (1958), an outlaw (Widmark) forces an old friend (Robert Taylor) to lead him to the money they stole during a bank heist.\n\nSturges then took over for Fred Zinnemann on the prestige project The Old Man and the Sea (1958), an adaptation of Ernest Hemingway’s short novel. However, despite the presence of his frequent star Tracy, whose performance was critically acclaimed, the drama was a disappointment at the box office. Last Train from Gun Hill (1959) was much better, a crackling western in which Douglas was at his best as an uncompromising sheriff determined to find the men who raped and killed his wife. The World War II drama Never So Few (1959) offered a noteworthy cast that included Frank Sinatra, Steve McQueen, Gina Lollobrigida, and Charles Bronson.\n\nBeginning an eight-year tenure at United Artists, Sturges directed The Magnificent Seven (1960), a remake of Kurosawa Akira’s 1954 classic The Seven Samurai. It featured a legendary cast that included McQueen, Bronson, Yul Brynner, and James Coburn, all of whom played gunslingers who are hired to protect a Mexican village from a bandit (Eli Wallach). Despite various production problems, Sturges’s film was a critical and commercial success. For his follow-up, he made the somewhat surprising By Love Possessed (1961), a Lana Turner soap opera about the secrets of a small New England town. He then reunited with Sinatra on Sergeants 3 (1962), a comedic western that included other members of the “Rat Pack”: Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Jr., Peter Lawford, and Joey Bishop.\n\nThe Tokyo-set A Girl Named Tamiko (1962) was another soap opera, with Laurence Harvey as a Eurasian photographer who, desperate to become a U.S. citizen, uses his charm to persuade an American (Martha Hyer) to marry him. That misfire, however, was quickly erased with the success of The Great Escape (1963), one of the decade’s top action pictures. James Clavell and W.R. Burnett scripted (from a novel by Paul Brickhill) that World War II thriller about Allied POWs who undertake an elaborate escape plan. Sturges was masterful in his pacing of the mammoth production and in handling the all-star cast—which included McQueen (in a definitive performance), James Garner, Bronson, Coburn, and Richard Attenborough. Elmer Bernstein’s score nearly rose to the level of his work on The Magnificent Seven.\n\nLater films\n\nSturges went in another direction with his next project, The Satan Bug (1965), a suspense drama about the attempts to recover a deadly virus that is stolen from a top-secret laboratory. The Hallelujah Trail (1965) was a western spoof centring on a cavalry colonel (Lancaster) who tries to deliver 40 wagonloads of whiskey to miners in the face of stiff opposition from temperance activists (led by Lee Remick). The overlong and uneven film was widely panned. Hour of the Gun (1967), a ponderous sequel to Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, starred Garner as Earp, Jason Robards as Holliday, and Ryan as vengeance-obsessed Ike Clanton. Sturges then made Ice Station Zebra (1968), which featured an all-male cast (headed by Rock Hudson, Jim Brown, and Borgnine) on a submarine bound for an Arctic outpost as a Cold War crisis looms. The film was a commercial success. Less popular was Marooned (1969), a slow and unyielding drama about three astronauts (James Franciscus, Gene Hackman, and Richard Crenna) stranded in space after their spacecraft’s engine malfunctions.\n\nIn 1972 Sturges directed Joe Kidd, which was arguably his best film since The Great Escape. The violent western, with a strong Elmore Leonard screenplay, starred Clint Eastwood as a former bounty hunter who agrees to help a landowner (Robert Duvall) track down the man leading a peasant revolt. In the European production Valdez, il mezzosangue (1973; Chino), Bronson portrayed a horse breeder whose livelihood is threatened when he falls in love with the sister of a wealthy rancher; it was codirected by Duilio Coletti. With McQ (1974), Sturges was at last teamed with John Wayne, though the film drew mixed reviews; Wayne played a detective investigating the death of his best friend. The Eagle Has Landed (1976) showed flashes of Sturges’s old prowess. The old-fashioned suspense thriller was based on a Jack Higgins best seller about a Nazi plot to kidnap British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. As with most of Sturges’s more-popular productions, it featured a stellar cast, which included Michael Caine, Duvall, Donald Sutherland, and Anthony Quayle. Sturges subsequently retired.\n\nMichael Barson"
