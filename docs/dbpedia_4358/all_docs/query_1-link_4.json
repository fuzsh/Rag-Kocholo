        "text": "AISHA HARRIS, HOST:\n\nA warning - this episode contains explicit language.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nHARRIS: For decades, it's been a cliche to kill off the sole Black character first in horror movies. But the very funny new spoof \"The Blackening\" turns that hackneyed trope on its head by asking, what happens when all the main characters are Black? The movie is about a group of college friends who reunite for a weekend at a house in the woods, only to find themselves dodging a crossbow-wielding maniac. It's silly, smart and even a little bit deep. I'm Aisha Harris, and today, we're talking about \"The Blackening\" on POP CULTURE HAPPY HOUR from NPR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nHARRIS: Joining me today is the host of Weekend Edition Sunday, Ayesha Rascoe, my fellow Aisha. Hello.\n\nAYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE: Hi. Glad to be here.\n\nHARRIS: Great to have you here. And also with us is one of the co-hosts of the podcast \"FANTI,\" journalist, writer and producer Jarrett Hill. You can be an honorary Aisha if you'd like, Jarrett.\n\nJARRETT HILL: I was going to say, do I get to be...\n\nRASCOE: (Laughter) Yes.\n\nHILL: ...An honorary Aisha? I have to figure out how I would spell mine since y'all two are different. My best friend's name is also Jarrett, so, like, it's a weird thing happening here to have to figure out another spelling here.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nHARRIS: Well, it's great to have you here as well.\n\nSo in \"The Blackening,\" an eclectic bunch of old college friends head to a house in the woods for the Juneteenth holiday weekend. There's exes Lisa and Nnamdi, played by Antoinette Robertson and Sinqua Walls. They broke up because Nnamdi was trash, but they're now secretly hooking up again to the annoyance of Lisa's best friend and confidante, Dewayne, played by Dewayne Perkins. Grace Byers plays Allison, the biracial friend of the group who seems to have white daddy issues. X Mayo plays Shanika, the flamboyant lush, and Melvin Gregg plays King, who has a shady past but claims to have settled down comfortably into buppie (ph) life. And then there's Clifton, played by Jermaine Fowler. He's the outcast, this nerdy, socially awkward Trumper who no one really remembers from college. Like, why is he here? We don't know.\n\nUnfortunately, they only get maybe one game of Spades in before they encounter a creepy masked figure on an old black-and-white TV, as well as a trivia game called The Blackening, which features a sambo mascot as its centerpiece. The figure warns them that if they don't play the game, their other friend, Morgan, who's being held hostage, will die. Morgan is played by Yvonne Orji. They spend the night fighting for their lives while reevaluating their friendships and Blackness in the process. The movie was inspired by a viral sketch created by Dewayne Perkins' comedy improv group, 3Peat. Perkins penned the screenplay with Tracy Oliver, the co-writer of \"Girls Trip,\" and Tim Story directed.\n\nSo, Jarrett, I want to start with you first with sort of a general question of, like, when it comes to spoofs and parodies, like, what are you generally looking for? And did \"The Blackening\" meet your expectations in this genre?\n\nHILL: I would give this movie the award for the best job of giving me exactly what I expected and came for. This movie, to me - like, I came in wanting to laugh. I wanted to jump a little bit. I wanted to not be scared-scared, but, you know, have a little bit of a moment, right? I wanted to have an open-mouth cackle every few minutes. I wanted to see these Black people doing Black stuff. And I got exactly what I signed up for. Now, mind you, we could always have a note or two - right? - but, like, overall, this movie gave me exactly what I showed up for. It gave me exactly what that trailer made me think I was going to go for. 'Cause we all have been to a movie where we saw the trailer and we're like, well, I guess I didn't really need to see this movie 'cause the trailer had all the good stuff in it. That was not the case for me with this movie.\n\nHARRIS: Yes.\n\nHILL: I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nHARRIS: Yeah, that was a concern of mine, too, because I thought the trailer was really, really funny.\n\nHILL: Yeah.\n\nHARRIS: But, yeah, there's a lot more going on here, a lot more substance than I expected, perhaps. But, yeah, I agree with you. It gave us lots of laughs, I think. So, Ayesha, I know you are a big horror person.\n\nRASCOE: Yes.\n\nHARRIS: Did this satisfy your - if not your horror itch, your horror-comedy itch?\n\nRASCOE: I knew it was going to be a comedy, but I didn't know whether it was going to be, like, over-the-top, like \"Scary Movie.\" And I feel like this one - so this one had a little - a lot more substance than I was expecting...\n\nHARRIS: Yeah.\n\nRASCOE: ...Right? 'Cause it's a lot more - and it's not, like, a gross-out humor, which I don't always love, anyway. It's a lot more, like, the writing and the jokes and punchlines than just, you know, people doing weird, outrageous things. So I will say, I liked the movie. It did make me laugh a lot. I do wonder if it was a little bit long...\n\nHARRIS: Ooh.\n\nRASCOE: ...And it's not a long movie, so I don't know whether - it's an hour and 30 minutes. That's why I'm saying, did it need to be a movie? I don't think it should have just stayed a sketch. I almost think it would have been a perfect, like, one-hour show episode. That's where I'm at. Like, it sums - I don't know what the show would be.\n\nHILL: Like an anthology kind of show?\n\nHARRIS: Yeah.\n\nRASCOE: Yeah, or, like, how \"Atlanta\" would just throw random stuff in there, you know what I'm saying?\n\nHILL: Got you. Got you.\n\nRASCOE: Without the main character. Like that. Like...\n\nHARRIS: Yes. Yeah.\n\nHILL: A \"Black Mirror.\"\n\nRASCOE: Yes.\n\nHARRIS: Yeah.\n\nRASCOE: That would have been chef's kiss. But it was a really good movie.\n\nHARRIS: Interesting. I actually felt it was, like, perfectly timed. I think, yes, there were moments that could have been trimmed, but overall, I think it worked for me. But I do think it's interesting because this was originally a sketch. Also, the \"Scary Movie\" comparison is, like, immediately what came to mind for me because there haven't been too many big horror movies - like, in terms of helmed by Black people, starring Black people - you know, \"Scary Movie\" is kind of the urtext, right? Like, that's the blueprint. And this is not that. There are definitely some similarities. You know, they both reference \"Scream 2,\" when Jada Pinkett Smith is killed before the credits even roll.\n\nRASCOE: Yeah.\n\nHARRIS: So, like, yes, there's that. But this is like the sort of urbane Hillman Grad cousin to...\n\nRASCOE: Absolutely. It's a lot more sophisticated.\n\nHARRIS: Yeah.\n\nRASCOE: Yeah.\n\nHARRIS: To, like, the middle schooler...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nHARRIS: ...Humor.\n\nRASCOE: There aren't, like, fart jokes and stuff like that. Yeah.\n\nHILL: I love the opening scene with Jay Pharoah and Yvonne Orji. And, like, I remember thinking to myself, this must have been a lot of fun for them to do, right?\n\nHARRIS: Yeah.\n\nHILL: Like, they've played all kinds of different things, and, like, she gets to scream and throw...\n\nHARRIS: Yeah.\n\nHILL: ...Her hair around and be - like, doing all kinds of crazy stuff. Like, how often do you get an opportunity to do that? And, like - and it was, like, a real gig, you know what I mean? Like, it wasn't something crazy, right?\n\nHARRIS: Yeah.\n\nHILL: I remember watching it, thinking, like, oh, this looks like it was a lot of fun to be a part of. And that's something really, really great.\n\nHARRIS: Yeah. That opening scene, we should note, is, you know, Jay Pharoah and Yvonne Orji play the couple that gets there first, before everyone else does. I don't think it's a spoiler to say, like, bad things happen.\n\nHILL: Yes.\n\nRASCOE: Yeah. Yes/\n\nHARRIS: I loved that because, like, they are probably the most famous people in the movie...\n\nRASCOE: Yeah, they are. Yeah.\n\nHARRIS: ...Famous outside of Black famous, you know?\n\nRASCOE: Yeah.\n\nHARRIS: Like, people have watched \"Insecure.\" People watched \"SNL.\" So they know Jay Pharoah and they know Yvonne Orji. And I thought it was really funny how they use, actually, \"Scream 2\" as sort of a meta commentary on them being in the beginning of the film.\n\nRASCOE: But can I say that I didn't like the pause? I don't like when movies do that - when they pause and say, this is a joke.\n\nHARRIS: Yeah.\n\nRASCOE: I hate that. Now, why we got to do that?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nHILL: No, see, that's - I actually wrote down that I loved that self-referential moment. I feel like it's something that is difficult to get away with, right? Like, you can only do it in the right way. But, like, it was a moment that you could have easily missed if you weren't paying enough attention. And, like, just giving me a little bit of a pause, and then bad things happen - like, I just thought it was, like, a really funny moment, and I was like, OK, I see y'all.\n\nHARRIS: Yeah. Even within this type of movie that I think can have a broad appeal, there's always going to be something that we're, like, a little bit like, I don't know about that.\n\nRASCOE: (Laughter).\n\nHARRIS: But I have to say, I loved the trivia game.\n\nHILL: Yes.\n\nRASCOE: That was the best part.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE BLACKENING\")\n\nUNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As character) Question one - who was Sojourner Truth? A - an abolitionist and women's rights activist; B - an entrepreneur; or C - Harriet Tubman. Right answer or death.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As character) So he just going to force us to do a Black history test.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #3: (As character) I don't understand. Why make us play this game? If you're just going to kill us, just kill us.\n\nHARRIS: And even though a lot of that is the trailer, there's so much more in there that I was not expecting, including a \"Lift Every Voice And Sing\" reference that I was just like - this feels so real.\n\nRASCOE: (Laughter).\n\nHARRIS: We've all been there.\n\nHILL: Wait. But also, like, I want to know about the O'Reilly Auto Parts placement there. Like, that had to be a media moment that got paid for because it was too good. It was so good.\n\nRASCOE: OK. I mean, I love the math problem with the nahs (ph) and the - or nahs. Nahs. OK, so the guy who plays the outcast, what's his name?\n\nHARRIS: Jermaine Fowler's character. He's Clifton.\n\nRASCOE: Clifton is so funny.\n\nHILL: Yes.\n\nRASCOE: I was cackling. I was like - you know what I'm saying? Like, even if your arms are folded, you going - you're going to laugh.\n\nHILL: From all kinds of different references in the movie. Like, it's crazy to, like, think about how many different things that they hit. And, like...\n\nRASCOE: Yes.\n\nHILL: I think my favorite moments were probably, like, a \"Set It Off\" reference that happened...\n\nRASCOE: Yes.\n\nHARRIS: Yes.\n\nHILL: ...And a \"Sister Act 2\" reference. Yes.\n\nHARRIS: Yes.\n\nRASCOE: \"Sister Act 2\" - yes.\n\nHILL: So like, there's so many, like, reference moments. I was like - I started writing down, and then I wrote so many film references and just like wrote down the ones that I liked. But, like, there's moments in here that are going to hit for a lot of different people and, like, many different cross-sections of Black folks who have - maybe didn't have exposure to certain things but saw other things or heard things on the radio or whatever it is. I thought it was really great for that.\n\nHARRIS: Well, it's also like - it felt very integrated into who their characters were, right? Like...\n\nRASCOE: Yes.\n\nHARRIS: And I think part of what makes this work beyond just being a sketch is the fact that all of these people seem believable as friends to me. I can - they seem to gel really well and work off of each other and constantly ragging on, you know, someone for drinking a lot or another person for being biracial, like, in a playful way. But, like, that's how people act, and that's how people - like, friends in a group will rag each other.\n\nI also just want to give a shoutout to the fact that, like, how smart they are in this movie about survival, unlike most horror movies. I want to play this one scene. The main characters are Black, but you also have Diedrich Bader as Ranger White. And when they encounter him, it's just really interesting how they're kind of, like, figure out, OK, are we safer with this cop or just staying here and being, like, at the mercy of this, like, crossbow maniac? So let's actually play a little clip from that scene.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE BLACKENING\")\n\nDIEDRICH BADER: (As Ranger White) I'm one of the good ones.\n\nDEWAYNE PERKINS: (As Dewayne) Oh, that does not help. They all say that.\n\nANTOINETTE ROBERTSON: (As Lisa) That actually makes you seem more suspicious.\n\nBADER: (As Ranger White) You can trust me. Seriously, if I got an invite to the cookout, I'd be honored, but I wouldn't go.\n\nROBERTSON: (As Lisa) And why the f*** not?\n\nBADER: (As Ranger White) Because I know my presence in that all-Black space would be a disturbance and undo it being an all-Black space.\n\nROBERTSON: (As Lisa) That's a pretty good answer.\n\nHARRIS: And so then, like, they follow him. But before they follow him, they, like - they reach back down as they're following him and they pick up their weapons that they were holding, just to be safe. And I just love those, like, little details of, yeah, we're in a horror movie, yet we're also all Black. And we also are the people who, when we're in the audience, we're like, don't do that, and we're not going to do that.\n\nHILL: So from that perspective about, like, it being smart, I am a person who works in diversity, equity and inclusion quite a bit. And so like, whenever I hear certain words in a script, it grates on my ears immediately, right? If I hear someone say intersectionality in a script, I'm like, OK - right? - like - or something like that. And so there are certain words and phrases and conversations, even, that hit my ear in a way that they probably don't hit everybody else.\n\nAnd I remember there being a couple of different moments in here where I was like, you know what? OK. Like, I am like, I'll allow it. Like, it worked here. And I think the Antoinette Robertson moment when she's going after the villain and she's like, why Black women got to always save every - like, the way that it happens and the way that she said it, I was like, I'm into it. This is funny. Like, it was a really good moment. Even all of the moments that could, you know, hit differently for different people, like, they really landed for me, and I was really happy about it.\n\nRASCOE: So when she did do that, I felt like that one didn't hit as well for me 'cause I was like, did we earn this? I get it. I don't know.\n\nHILL: I love that question.\n\nHARRIS: I think that's a question worth posing.\n\nHILL: I love that.\n\nRASCOE: (Laughter).\n\nHARRIS: So there's a twist. And we won't get too into it because I think it's worth experiencing as a viewer. There's an extra layer of commentary in there, and I wonder how you all felt about it and whether it elevated this a little bit more in terms of just, like, what it's trying to do in your eyes, or maybe it didn't quite work. How are we feeling?\n\nRASCOE: I think it worked. I mean, look, obviously, even, like, a movie that's a comedy or - and, obviously, scary movies can have a larger theme that they're trying to get at. I mean, I think that it worked because it is a conversation that happens all the time about what it means to be Black, right? And so I think the way that they played it out and the way they did it was very smart. It wasn't too heavy-handed or too, like, sappy or whatever. So I think it works. I also think the reference to Spades worked for me because I have a lot of PTSD with Spades, and I - you know...\n\nHARRIS: So many of us do.\n\nRASCOE: I feel like Spades is too long, and I feel like we don't address that as a community, that it is way too long of a game. And people are too serious, and it's too much. So I like the role that Spades plays in this because I think we need to have more of a conversation and the damage that it does to people.\n\nHARRIS: So now I know that that's your trigger word.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nHARRIS: Don't say spades around Ayesha.\n\nRASCOE: Don't say it. I don't like competition.\n\nHILL: The Spades piece is an interesting one. When I think about Spades, the conversation around Spades is always so interesting 'cause it's not an inviting game, right?\n\nHARRIS: No. It's not.\n\nHILL: There's never really an interest in teaching somebody how to play it, right? But, like, it was great because there also is this conversation around the ways that we police Blackness and the ways that our Blackness shows up and when we think about hair and music and the way that we dress and where we're from and what shows we watched and all of these kinds of different things. But it's been something in the forefront of my mind a lot as well as, like, the ways that we tell people that they are and are not Black enough - right? - and, like, the ways that that creates an idea for folks that they aren't what they're supposed to be to be who they are. There was a moment of, like, kind of really addressing it and kind of, like, talking about that that I really appreciated.\n\nHARRIS: Yeah. As someone who only recently has learned to play Spades and has only learned to play enough to, like, not lose terribly, but I haven't gotten strategic enough about it yet, I'm with you, Ayesha. It is...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nHARRIS: I - look, I blame my family. No one in my family played, so, like, I didn't learn it. By the time I was around people who did, it was like, I don't want to force anyone to teach me. So...\n\nRASCOE: Yes.\n\nHARRIS: Well, it sounds like we would all recommend \"The Blackening.\" It's fun. You should go see it. And when you do see it, let us know what you think about it. You should also let us know how you are at Spades. Maybe we can, like, meet up.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nHARRIS: And that brings us to the end of our show. Ayesha Rascoe, Jarrett Hill, thanks so much for being here. This was fun, and I'm glad we all got to get our hearts out about Spades and Blackness and all that other stuff.\n\nRASCOE: Thank you. Thank you so much.\n\nHILL: Thanks for having me. This was great.\n\nHARRIS: And we want to take a moment to thank our POP CULTURE HAPPY HOUR+ subscribers.
