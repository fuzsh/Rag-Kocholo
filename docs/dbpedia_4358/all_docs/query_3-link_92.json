Triggering as a blood magic option would make it more interesting though.\n\nUnicore\n\nTap into blood is not a very good feat, even for arcane or primal sorcerers. They are second round actions (because you need active blood magic) doing first round things, that use non-standard skills to do those things, meaning you either maximize doing those things only with blood magic active, or you have to boost 2 or more skills to do the same thing. The value of recalling knowledge through this feat is being wildly exaggerated on these boards.\n\nOld_Man_Robot\n\n4 people marked this as a favorite.\n\nRavingdork wrote:\n\nArcane: One of two worthwhile effects.

Take 10 min and get back the focus point.\n\nBluemagetim\n\nAt the same time I do like all of the other tradition effects.\n\nThey give a sorcerer that wants to invest in nature or religion an extra use for the skill.\n\nDeriven Firelion\n\nThat Arcane Tap into blood works very well for my multiclass wizard arcane sorcerer. I like the sorcerer for combat and the wizard archetype for changeable utility spells.\n\nGortle\n\n1 person marked this as a favorite.\n\nRavingdork wrote:\n\nArcane: One of two worthwhile effects.

It is purplexing as written. Divine and Primal options don't make much sense. The Arcane option just embarasses the Wizard. Occult option seems right.\n\nUnicore\n\nThe arcane option is weird because it is passably ok as one action after having cast a bloodline spell, but would be absurdly overpowered if it was a reaction or a free action.\n\nShadesOfMauve\n\nPlantThings wrote:\n\nYeah, I thought I was going crazy reading the Step part of the Divine option. Triggering as a blood magic option would make it more interesting though.\n\nI read that 'step' part three times, trying to figure out why it was there. I wonder if they copied the text from Propelling Sorcery (where it's a free action). Which brings up the confusing similarity between Tap into (Divine) Blood and Propelling Sorcery.\n\nTap into (Divine) Blood\n\n- 1 action\n\n- religion check\n\n- other blood magic effect still applies\n\n- could move once between casting a one-action spell that triggers blood magic and using Tap (you could do any other single action, too, but moving is the only reason this might be a benefit)\n\nPropelling Sorcery\n\nfree action\n\n- no check\n\n- instead of other blood magic effect\n\n- Happens immediately when blood magic comes into effect\n\nAm I missing something? Having two feats in the same class be so similar seems odd to me. Usually this level of attention to what the differences are only comes up when cross-classing.\n\nI've never played a pf2e sorc, so I'm not comparing anything to the premaster. Had my Angelic Sorc concept for the next game in mind for months and got very excited when our PC2 arrived early (I usually lurk but got impatient waiting for someone else to bring it up).\n\nUnicore\n\nTo really evaluate Tap into blood, you almost have to build the character and then imagine using the ability in an actual encounter situation.\n\nthe arcane benefit becomes really hard to match up with the imperial sorcerer at all. You barely have any bloodline spells at all that make sense to cast before using an action to tap into blood, and your bloodline magic effect ends at the start of your turn, before you can do anything with it. If your first turn, you use extend spell, then cast a bloodline spell, you can tap into blood at the start of your second turn, but you just spent one action pretty much to be able to spend an additional action next turn recalling knowledge. It works, but it isn't very pretty.\n\nThe dragon sorcerer has a bunch more bloodline spells to cast in the first round that make sense to set up a third action tap into blood, so it is probably the bloodline that makes the best use of this feat.\n\nThe primal one is tricky. It is kind of cool in theory, but how many sorcerers are just passing on the intimidate skill, and wanting to keep nature maximized instead? Again, like recalling knowledge, demoralize is much better to do at the start of your turn than at the end and you need to boost intimidation to get the feats that make it worth doing at higher levels.\n\nThe reposition with religion is actually the coolest of the abilities, in my opinion, as it is generally something worth doing at the end of a turn instead of the beginning of it, although stepping twice with 2 actions is undeniably an action economy boost.\n\nDeriven Firelion\n\nWhat about Extend Blood Magic? Couldn't you tap into blood with Extend Blood Magic extending the effect for an additional round and use Arcane to RK a few times?\n\nGortle\n\n1 person marked this as a favorite.\n\nDeriven Firelion wrote:\n\nWhat about Extend Blood Magic? Couldn't you tap into blood with Extend Blood Magic extending the effect for an additional round and use Arcane to RK a few times?\n\nYes. But it is kind of annoying as a power. It is a focus spell that generates blood magic effect and a spellshape at the same time. That is really Odd. I strongly suspect it needs errata.\n\nEXTEND BLOOD MAGIC �\n\nFOCUS 3\n\nUNCOMMON\n\nCONCENTRATE\n\nFOCUS\n\nSPELLSHAPE\n\nSORCERER\n\nYou call upon the arcane energy coursing through your blood to\n\nextend the magic it grants. If your next action is to Cast a Spell\n\nthat grants you a blood magic effect that lasts for at least 1 round,\n\nyou or a target gain the blood magic effect for an additional round.\n\nYou can have only one extended blood magic effect at a time.\n\nElementalofCuteness\n\nJust make it a free action.\n\nUnicore\n\nDeriven Firelion wrote:\n\nWhat about Extend Blood Magic? Couldn't you tap into blood with Extend Blood Magic extending the effect for an additional round and use Arcane to RK a few times?\n\nAll of what Gortle said, plus think about it in practice:\n\nRound 1: Cast Extend Blood Magic (1 action), and then probably Haste (2 actions).\n\nRound 2: Tap into blood to recall knowledge (1 action)...then either do it again, probably three times total to take advantage of the blood magic, or cast a two action spell based off of what you learned.\n\nIn the end, casting force barrage once in round 1 and then tap into blood 2 times, or casting haste, then tap into blood on round 1 are probably more efficient use of actions than messing around with Extend blood magic, unless you are really anticipating the need for a +1 to AC or saving throws carrying over into round 2.\n\nBasically Extend Blood Magic doesn't really work out to be about anything more than the bonus from blood magic itself, unless recalling knowledge 4 times was something you really needed to do, in which case, I guess, extend blood magic + force barrage gives you the most actions to do so.\n\nDeriven Firelion\n\nUnicore wrote:\n\nDeriven Firelion wrote:\n\nWhat about Extend Blood Magic?

That you can use Arcane for any RK check is nice that early in the game.\n\nKitusser\n\nOld_Man_Robot wrote:\n\nRavingdork wrote:\n\nArcane: One of two worthwhile effects.

Because the usefulness of the 10ft Step is almost completely overridden by the fact you are casting a spell with the Manipulate trait directly beforehand. At that point you might as well just Stride because you've already taken the Reactive Strike.\n\nlemeres\n\n4 people marked this as a favorite.\n\nGortle wrote:\n\nThe Arcane option just embarasses the Wizard.\n\nEmbarrassing wizards seems like a favorite passtime for sorcerers.\n\nGortle\n\n1 person marked this as a favorite.\n\nLike shooting fish in a barrel\n\nOld_Man_Robot\n\n3 people marked this as a favorite.\n\nKitusser wrote:\n\nOld_Man_Robot wrote:\n\nRavingdork wrote:\n\nArcane: One of two worthwhile effects.

You could maybe argue that losing 2 points is fine, but anything past that is too much.\n\nWizard just needs to be buffed somehow.\n\nSorcerers don't need an Int investment to make it work. Not really.\n\nThe thing is that they aren't competing with an Int based class who has the same skill proficiency as them, rolling against the same creature. That is that Int classes strength afterall.\n\nThey are competing against the lack of skill proficiency that Int based class will have against everything that isn't in their wheelhouse.\n\nHaving a +7 from Int to a lore check is great, but its a hell of a lot less than the +28 the sorcerer may have because they get to use 1 skill for everything.\n\nNot all Int classes are the same mind you, Investigators (and some Rogues) get a much better time out of this comparison.\n\nOrientating to the Wizard in particular, at 20th the Wizard will have 3 skills at legendary and potentially more if they pick up serveral Additional Lore feats. However, even when attempting to optimise, the Wizard simply can't cover all the options that they may face in a 1-20 adventure (more so if you do one of those 1-11 paths and jump to a different 11+ path).\n\nThe Arcane version of Tap Into Blood removes that worry.

There are many RK checks that require you to use medicine, specific lores, crafting and society.\n\nWhile the later two are int based skill, once you hit level 15 a +8 proficiency bonus is still on par with +6 int and +2 trained. If the sorcerer has any point in int (which they most likely would, since you can't have three +5 stats unless you play some very specific races), they would still outdone wizard in those fields.\n\nBut yes, having to invest in so many different skills is usually the pain point of recall knowledge.\n\nDeriven Firelion\n\nIt's pretty crazy a sorcerer can build up Arcana and RK anything.\n\nYou can eventually cast Retrocognition to activate Blood magic, then RK with what you see for anything. That or scouting eye is a pretty nice combination for Tap the Blood.\n\nTheaitetos\n\nI agree with Unicore that it is much harder to use than it seems.

Nowhere does it say you can use Arcana as if it is a lore skill. Look up what a subject is in recall knowledge if you need.\n\nIf you really want lore on everything, go investigator with keen recollections, but even that isn't as good as Tap into Blood at higher levels.\n\nAlso I really don't think it's that hard to trigger blood magic. We all agree that out of combat it's a piece of cake. In combat you could take Hag's retributive spite blood magic effect when you cast ancestral memory in turn 1 (not a bad blood magic by the way), and be set for tap into blood for at least one turn.

It is clearly outside the intention of this ability. Precedingly, the only abilities that allow you to RK on any topic with a Lore skill are either stunted in progression, or are considered a main feature of the class (Thaumaturge).\n\n\"The skill normally needed\" is not the Lore skill, it is one of the normal (non Lore) Recall Knowledge skills. There are no checks within the game which only allow you to RK with Lore as far as I'm aware. No sane GM would allow you to do this, this ability is already quite powerful.\n\nYou aren't replacing the Lore skill, because Lore is meant to be specific, and Arcana is not a Lore skill.

But normally this is a crafting check right? So acrobatics would be at a higher DC than just using crafting. If a player actually had basket weaving lore then they should probably have a lower DC at crafting baskets than someone using something general like crafting and certainly someone improvising using a skill like acrobatics.\n\nNext layer to unpack is rolling for making baskets.\n\nIs this something you can just give your player because it has no consequence on the game balance?\n\nIs this being done as an earn income activity\n\nis it done as downtime at all to have a basket on hand? Does quality matter in the game?\n\nIs this being done as part of overcoming some challenge in exploration mode?\n\nYour setting a DC for this activity based on what is being done then augmenting it depending on how specific or general the skill used to do it.\n\nDeriven Firelion\n\n5 people marked this as a favorite.\n\nKitusser wrote:\n\nDeriven Firelion wrote:\n\nBluemagetim wrote:\n\nI would always set the DC based on the most general applicable RK skill because it is even more unbalanced an ability to do otherwise.\n\nWhy should I as a GM let a person using arcana ever get the only benefit of picking a specific lore?\n\nBecause the game is supposed to be fun and you want your players to get the information?\n\nThen we shouldn't be discussing whether Tap into Blood is overpowered or not.

Only reason some are bringing it up is because we hear how good the wizard is at RK checks as to a reason why they don't need some upgrades, then Tap the Blood comes along and suddenly the sorcerer who is a charisma class suddenly gets this ability that let's them RK using Arcane for everything. We all have to ask why? Why wasn't this a wizard ability? The intelligence class who many including myself see as an academic who should have a deep knowledge of a variety of subjects.\n\nTap the Blood isn't about power, it's about encroaching even on the fun aspects of the wizard like RK checks which \"Wizards are perfect as is\" proponents often push as a reason intelligence is a good casting stat.\n\nAs a mostly power gamer myself, I could care less about Tap the Blood. It isn't powerful to me at all. The first thing I use to find out about monsters is hitting them. 99% of the time my \"RK\" attack tells me all I need to know.\n\nI let other players that enjoy the RK RP use it, while I just kill the thing and then give them a superfluous \"thank you\" after I kill the monster.\n\n\"Thanks for telling me how to kill it. I'll remember that next time I face it\", as I think if I even bother to remember.\n\n1 to 50 of 68 << first < prev | 1 | 2 | next > last >>\n\nCommunity / Forums / Pathfinder / Pathfinder Second Edition / General Discussion / Problems with Tap Into Blood All Messageboards\n\nWant to post a reply?
