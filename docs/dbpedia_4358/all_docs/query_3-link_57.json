        "text": "In other words, on my flight to Sin City, as a queer leftist living in the (for-now-)post-Trump era, Con Air came to me as a vision of the road not taken. Please, allow me to explain.\n\nFor the uninitiated, Con Air is basically “Die Hard on a plane,” despite script-writer Scott Rosenberg’s assertion to the contrary. Director Simon West’s movie centers around Cameron Poe, played by Nicolas Cage, a former Army Ranger from Mobile, Alabama who is imprisoned in San Quentin for involuntary manslaughter after a bar fight gone wrong (I’ll come back to that in a minute). After eight years in jail, during which Poe missed the birth of his child, he is finally being let out on parole. He is being taken to his home state for full release on a plane populated by cartoonishly monstrous convicts, most of whom are being transferred from California to a new supermax prison in Alabama, and who take over the plane within the first ten minutes in the air. “Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Con Air,” announces John Malkovich’s Cyrus “the Virus” Grissom, a murderous sociopath with a Juris Doctor who looks and talks exactly like John Malkovich. While the cons attempt to reroute their plane to a non-extradition country, U.S. Marshal Vince Larkin (John Cusack) works from the ground to intercept the flight as Poe operates from the inside to bring it down.\n\n[ed. note: Throughout the film, Poe’s purity is symbolized by a stuffed bunny kept with his personal effects and repeatedly imperiled as he attempts to deliver it to his daughter for her birthday, including a dramatic confrontation including the memorablel line, “Put the bunny back in the box.”]\n\nIs the movie any good? I don’t think so. It’s fun and quite entertaining, but it is also loud and overwrought and riddled with plot holes. It features Danny Trejo as a serial rapist, Steve Buscemi as a Jeffrey Dahmer stan, and Dave Chappelle as a character called “Pinball.” The San Francisco Chronicle called it “spectacle for its own sake,” though admitted it has a sort of “crude charm.” Roger Ebert gave it one of its stronger reviews, writing the film “knows it is absurd, and does little to deny it.” Both the Chronicle review and a recent retrospective in Mel Magazine highlight Con Air as a turning point for Nicolas Cage’s career, one that essentially saw him shift from existential films that required acting to action movies that required existing.\n\nYet Con Air remains enjoyable in its silliness, hypnotic in the way only a heavily-accented Nicolas Cage performance can be. When Poe utters, “I’m going to show you God does exist” to his friend, Baby-O, a diabetic on the verge of death due to lack of insulin, Cage’s later “I’m going to steal the Declaration of Independence,” in National Treasure (dir. Jon Turteltaub, 2004), feels utterly pedestrian.\n\nBut what really compelled me watching this movie on my trip to Las Vegas was the subtle social commentary offered by the film. Battling my aerophobia via distraction, I wondered if Con Air was in fact trying to make important political statements. Now that I am safely on the ground, I can answer that question with a confident “no,” but nevertheless the film illuminates the socio-political crossroads we faced at the turn of the millennium and reminds us that we did not have to take the path we find ourselves on in 2022.\n\nNow Boarding All Passengers\n\nIt should come as no surprise that we are meant to root for Cage’s Poe, a deeply earnest man who was imprisoned for defending himself and his wife when a drunk barfly came at them with a knife. The judge hands down Poe’s sentence with the assertion that his Army training makes him “a deadly weapon,” and therefore more dangerous to society. According to the judge, Poe is “not subject to the same laws as other people that are provoked.” Setting aside the fact that all people are, theoretically, subject to the same laws in the United States, this sentence feels downright unbelievable in the post-9/11 era. Although we still do not actually treat our military veterans very well in the United States (according to the RAND Corporation, there are about 37,000 homeless veterans as of February 2022), the upswell of ideological support for them since the beginning of the so-called War on Terror makes the notion of a young, white, handsome military vet going to jail for killing a man in self-defense somewhat ridiculous.\n\nFor the other convicts on the plane, there appears to be little question as to why most of them are heading to a maximum-security prison. The movie eschews much of the reality of incarceration in the United States (such as non-violent drug offenses) in favor of bombastic caricatures–avoiding the abhorrent reality of mass incarceration while making for a more entertaining film. As mentioned above, the mastermind of Con Air is Malkovich’s Cyrus Grissom, a kidnapper and murderer, terrifyingly straightforward and calculating. His lieutenants, as it were, include the alliterative Billy Bedlam (Nick Chinlund) and Diamond Dog (Ving Rhames). Bedlam is another murderer, found guilty of killing his wife’s entire family after he saw her with another man. Rhames’ character is a militant Black nationalist, convicted of murder after blowing up an NRA meeting, because he claimed “they represented the basest negativity of the white race.” (Revising this essay in the wake of the Buffalo, NY, mass shooting incident, it’s difficult for me to argue with that one.)\n\nAlthough in 1997 the rate of incarceration for Black Americans was significantly higher than white Americans (and it remains so today), the film highlights Grissom and Greene as the most gruesome of criminals. Diamond Dog isn’t exactly a sympathetic character, but he is far from the most dangerous criminal on the plane. Dog has a goal, an ideology. He is not simply out for blood. Pinball is likewise portrayed as relatively harmless (if also ineffective and generally unhelpful). The film’s identification of Grissom, Greene, and Bedlam as the most “criminal” pushes against the racist notion that Black men are inherently more criminal or dangerous than non-Black men, though the movie poster undermines this effort significantly by prominently featuring (ostensibly) Diamond Dog’s bare back, his arms pointing two guns in the air. Poe’s best friend, Baby-O (Mykelti Williamson), is also Black, but we never even learn of his offense–all we know is that he is kind, gentle, and diabetic.\n\nIt’s a confusing mix of messages, but it is unlikely the filmmakers were trying to encode coherent commentary on race and crime. I think it is more likely they wanted to bring in a diverse cast of big names and sought to highlight the biggest of names as their main antagonists for Poe and Larkin. At the same time, these contradictions are notable for what they are not: characterizations of criminal terrorists as primarily “outsiders” in some way. Con Air does not present white supremacist terrorism as the threat we know it is today, but it also does not suggest the only white men capable of terrorism are Germans (Die Hard; dir. John McTiernan, 1988) or Russians (Air Force One; dir. Wolfgang Petersen, 1997) or some other non-American identity. Looking back at Con Air in 2022, it is notable for its identification of “home-grown” white American violence.\n\nCaricatures of criminals aside, the really fascinating case study is Cusack’s U.S. Marshal Vince Larkin. Larkin is, in short, a dweeb. The movie wants us to think he is a dweeb. He wears socks with sandals. He is highly educated and has an expansive vocabulary, offering “loquacious, verbose, effusive” as synonyms for “garrulous.” He is entirely opposed to guns in his operations. He pushes–hard–against DEA agent Duncan Malloy (Colm Meaney) when Malloy wants to arm his colleague who is boarding the plane undercover. Much to Malloy’s disgust, Larkin hired a woman to guard the most dangerous criminals in the country.\n\nBut the movie wants us to root for the dweeby Vince Larkin. Larkin is our second hero–a man who wears Birkenstocks, a man who recycles (probably), a man who recognizes that our prison system is fundamentally broken. Malloy, the trigger-happy DEA agent, is gross. He arms his undercover agent against orders (the agent gets himself killed because of it); he is unintelligent, angry, and violent. He drives an ostentatious silver Corvette with the license plate “AZZ KIKR,” which he unapologetically parks in a disabled designated parking spot (Malloy is not disabled). The car is symbolic of his violent brand of masculinity, his obsession with appearance, and possibly evidence of corruption. Malloy, just as much as Cyrus the Virus, is our villain.\n\nWhat if, in the real world, our broader society had sided with the Vince Larkins instead of the Duncan Malloys?\n\nThough he is objectively a part of the prison-industrial complex, Larkin remains openly critical of the problematic institution. In response to Malloy’s attitude that the convicts on the plane are “thugs in chains” or “animals,” Larkin cites Dostoevsky in that “the degree of civilization in a society can be judged by observing its prisons.” Despite Larkin’s own implication in this system, his critique pushed against the prevailing political winds of the 1990s, in which bipartisan legislation established so-called “3 strikes” sentencing rules on top of mandatory minimums and the construction of supermax prisons increased considerably. Black thinkers and activists like Angela Y. Davis had been making such critiques for years, but to see a white man echoing their sentiments in a major Hollywood blockbuster–and for him to be our “good guy”--is rather jarring (affectionately).\n\nLarkin and Poe develop an uneasy relationship throughout the film, somewhat troubling the idea of the ripped Army veteran as a lone hero. Poe’s communication with Larkin is initially limited to a brief radio conversation and a message scrawled on the dead body of Chappelle’s character, which Cage boots out of the plane. When the two meet in person, each aims a gun at the other. These men do not trust each other, but their partnership proves mutually beneficial. The “man on the inside” is a well-worn trope in action films (Die Hard, Under Siege [1992], Air Force One); Con Air mobilizes it to highlight Poe’s willingness to collaborate and Larkin’s acknowledgment that not all convicts are bad people. Though Cage’s physique and distaste for sleeves help Poe fit the image of a classic late 20th-century action hero, his soft voice, loving letters to his daughter, and acceptance of Larkin (even after seeing him still wearing his socks and sandals!) subvert Rambo-fueled expectations of masculinity as hard and unflinching.\n\nWhile the film is far from passing the Bechdel test (its two most prominent female characters, Poe’s wife, Tricia [Monica Potter], and the guard Sally Bishop [Rachel Ticotin], exist primarily to be addressed, dismissed, threatened, or assaulted by men), Con Air also manages to poke some holes in traditional gender norms through its portrayal of trans-ness. A minor character who boards the plane at its only planned stop in Carson City, Sally-Can’t Dance, spends their first precious seconds of freedom ransacking an abandoned house for a dress. It’s fair to assume from this short scene that Sally has been prohibited from living as their real gender while in prison. According to Lambda Legal, incarcerated people are often placed in prisons based on their gender assigned at birth, and the withholding of transition-related healthcare is common practice in jails and prisons.\n\nSally dons their newfound purple-flowered garment and returns to the convicts, who are working on repairing and refueling their plane before the U.S. Marshals arrive. There, Malkovich’s character doesn’t bat an eye–he simply hands Sally a gun and tells them where to point it. Later, when the convicts are successfully back in the air, Sally dances and sings in their dress to cheers and applause from the convicts. In 1997, public conversations about transgender rights were few and far between, yet Con Air found a way to validate trans identity and acknowledge the difficult reality of being incarcerated while trans.\n\nMuch ink has been spilled about how the United States’ pandemic response parallels the choices of the Amity Island mayor in Jaws, which prioritized economic gain over, y’know, survival. Con Air is no Jaws in terms of its contribution to film, but it nonetheless picked up on the bubbling strain of toxic, violent, white masculinity embedded within our criminal justice system and wanted us to be unhappy with it. Looking back on Con Air from our post-9/11, post(?)-Trump, vantage point, I can’t help but wonder how the central conflict between Larkin and Malloy would play in Peoria today. This country elected a cardboard cutout of Duncan Malloy president, and may just do so again.\n\nLike the film’s creepiest character and most dangerous criminal, Garland Greene, we seem to have walked away from the wreckage of Con Air disconcertingly unfazed. I recommend a re-watch this July 14th, in honor of Poe’s little girl, who finally got her stuffed bunny!"
