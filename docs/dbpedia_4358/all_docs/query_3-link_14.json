        "meta_description": "THE TERRITORY provides an immersive on-the-ground look at the tireless fight of the Indigenous Uru-eu-wau-wau people against the encroaching deforestation brought by farmers and illegal settlers in the Brazilian Amazon. With awe-inspiring cinematography showcasing the titular landscape and richly textured sound design, the film takes audiences deep into the Uru-eu-wau-wau community and provides unprecedented access to the farmers and settlers illegally burning and clearing the protected Indigenous land.\r\n\r\nPartially shot by the Uru-eu-wau-wau people, the film relies on vérité footage captured over three years as the community risks their lives to set up their own news media team in the hopes of exposing the truth.",

        "text": "Pritz knew from the start of filming that Neidinha would be one of the film’s central protagonists. In the early weeks of filming inside the territory, he began to focus on one of her mentees: Bitaté, an 18-year-old who radiated both youthful energy and seriousness of purpose. “I began to understand that Bitaté was a very special person,” Pritz remarked. “You could tell he learned very quickly. He made people laugh and was really light-hearted. At the same time, he had this ambition. He was going to a white high school outside the Uru-eu-wau-wau territory. He seemed to bridge these two different worlds pretty effortlessly.”\n\nBitaté was not yet 19 when the Uru-eu-wau-wau elders nominated him to become the new president of Jupaú Association, the leadership body that engages with the government and other outside entities. “I think the elders felt that Bitaté was well-equipped to respond to the mounting threats against their community,” Pritz comments. “Along with the invasions, there were new types of attacks coming in the form of laws and budget cuts and things like that. Bitaté understood that world pretty well. He’d learned how to fly drones and used them for surveillance. It was clear that technology and media were going to become a big part of how he would respond to all of these threats.”\n\nThe Uru-eu-wau-wau’s dedication to safeguarding their territory is rooted in their ancient connection to the land. As Bitaté describes it, “We have a special love and care for our territory because it’s where our ancestors are from; it’s where all the wisdom is. Our culture, our traditions, our traditional foods and medicinal plants are all inside the forest. It’s a wealth we want to preserve for future generations. That’s why we’ve fought, and are still fighting, for this territory.”\n\nUchida introduced Pritz to environmental and human rights activist Neidinha Bandeira, leader and co-founder of the nonprofit Kandidé Ethno-Environmental Defense Association. Neidinha spent her first 12 years in the rainforest of northwestern Brazil, where her father worked as a rubber tapper. Her mother taught her to read using books and magazines that arrived with biannual supply shipments. She was fascinated by American Wild West stories — “bang-bang” books as they were known — but also troubled by what she read. She had grown up seeing the Indigenous Uru-eu-wau-wau people peacefully going about their lives and keeping to themselves. That didn’t happen in the “bang-bang” books. “I always felt sad when I read those stories. History showed the Indigenous people were already there, so how was it possible that they were expelled from their land, and killed and persecuted by the U.S. Army? That always disturbed me a lot,” she recalls.\n\nNeidinha spent over four decades working directly with Indigenous communities to defend their rights and protect their lands. In 1984, she moved back to Uru-eu-wau-wau territory as a ranger for FUNAI, the government agency responsible for protecting the traditions, cultures and rights of Indigenous people. A rush to exploit the rainforest for logging, mining, farming and cattle ranching was underway. While the Uru-eu-wau-wau had been granted sovereignty over 7,000 square miles of their ancestral territory, illegal incursions and attempted land theft were common. Neidinha and the Uru-eu-wau-wau worked together to conduct surveillance and catch invaders, forging an enduring relationship. After exposing corruption inside FUNAI in 1990, Neidinha and her fellow whistleblowers founded the nonprofit Kandidé Ethno-Environmental Defense Association to continue their work with Indigenous populations.\n\nThe activists’ dedication and the urgency of the moment pointed towards a documentary about the Uru-eu-wau-wau and their fight to preserve their land. In the years since the Uru-eu-wau-wau were first contacted in 1981, deforestation has transformed what had been one of Brazil’s major rainforests. “Neidinha had a really strong focus on the Uru-eu-wau-wau as the biggest territory in the state of Rondônia, a territory with huge ecological importance for the entire region,” Pritz notes. “She’s known this community for over 40 years, many of them since they were born. Their land is triple the size of Delaware and they’ve got 183 people trying to defend it. It’s so hard.”\n\nAlex Pritz is a documentary film director and cinematographer focused on human’s relationship with the natural world. Pritz’s directorial debut, THE TERRITORY, premiered in the World Cinema competition at Sundance 2022, winning both an Audience Award and Special Jury Award for Documentary Craft, making it the only film at that year’s festival to win awards from audience and jury alike. Pritz also worked as a cinematographer on the feature documentary “The First Wave” with director Matt Heineman, and as a cinematographer and field producer on Jon Kasbe’s feature documentary “When Lambs Become Lions” (Tribeca 2018). Prior to that, Pritz co-directed, shot and edited the documentary short “My Dear Kyrgyzstan” (Big Sky 2019). He is a co-founder of Documist and has received grants from the Sundance Institute, IDA Enterprise Fund, Catapult Fund and Doc Society.\n\nPritz holds a Bachelor of Science from McGill University, where he studied Environmental Science and Philosophy. In 2012, he received an inaugural Dalai Lama Fellowship for his work developing film curricula alongside low-income communities in the Philippines and taught participatory film workshops for lawyers and human rights advocates around the world.\n\nWill Miller is a documentary filmmaker and co-founder of Documist, a production company based in New York City and Toronto. His work focuses on environmental conflict, migration and human rights. He has worked in over 30 countries and speaks English and Spanish fluently, as well as Portuguese and French conversationally.\n\nTHE TERRITORY is the first feature film Miller has produced. Before that, he worked primarily on short films and digital features, garnering several awards as well as Emmy® and Canadian Screen Awards nominations. His work has been published by The New York Times, The Guardian, The Economist, CNN, NBC and BBC. From 2017 through 2019, he worked at Human Rights Watch, where he produced over 100 videos reaching millions of viewers online and broadcast by dozens of news outlets around the world.\n\nMiller is dedicated to teaching and sharing the craft of documentary. He has worked on a range of participatory multimedia projects in the U.S., Canada, Kenya, Haiti, the Philippines and Brazil, from photography projects with kids to evidentiary video techniques for human rights defenders to masterclasses for aspiring cinematographers. He taught part-time at the East African Film Academy as well as the Aga Khan Graduate School of Media and Communications and has given dozens of workshops around the world.\n\nMiller studied environmental sciences at McGill University. His research focused on historical settlement patterns in the Napo River Valley in the Peruvian Amazon as well as land loss and displacement of the Emberá Indigenous community by the Alto Bayano hydroelectric dam in Panama"
