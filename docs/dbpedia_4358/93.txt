The Sky Ranger was introduced in the mid 90's. The design concept was to produce a high performance light sport aircraft, with simple construction, no welding required and low build times.

To do this the tail section, ailerons, flaps, and many of the sub assemblies come factory built and covered from the factory.

Today over 900 Sky Rangers are flying, many used in light sport aircraft training schools.
