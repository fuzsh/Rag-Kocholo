        "text": "I am a sucker for mystery stories, that’s why I found the Charlie Chan movies entertaining. This compilation consists of 37 full-length movies from 1929 to 1981. Some of the earliest movies were considered lost but I hope someone actually has them. Charlie Chan is a fictional Chinese detective created by Earl Derr Biggers [affiliate link]. Although Biggers is a prolific writer, he only wrote 6 novels featuring Charlie Chan.\n\nThe popularity of this Chinese detective intrigued me. It is good that non-Chinese actors played him because he isn’t real. As a Chinese myself, I can’t imagine a Chinese sprouting weird aphorism. In contrast, Charlie Chan’s sons spoke perfect English.\n\nThere are 6 actors who played Charlie Chan in this playlist: Edward L. Park, Warner Oland, Sidney Toler, Roland Winters, Ross Martin, and Peter Ustinov. Warner Oland starred as Charlie Chan in 13 out of 37 movies. Sidney Toler appeared in 19 out of the 37.\n\nThe plots of 35 of the Charlie Chan movies before 1950 were generally interesting. Production quality is good too. There was a long break of about 20 years before the next 2 movies on Charlie Chan. Unfortunately, both of them were disastrous.\n\n4 of Warner Oland’s early films were lost. 2 of them were recreated from final shooting scripts with surviving film stills, and one from a Spanish remake.\n\n1. Behind that Curtain (Edward L. Park) 1929\n\nCharlie Chan was played by Edward L. Park. His part was minor (appearing from 1:18:30) but he was portrayed as an intelligent competent detective. Boris Karloff, who appeared as an Indian servant of Sir John Beetham (played by Warner Baxter), received more screen time.\n\nThe film is based on a Charlie Chan novel of the same name although this adaptation was more romantic movie than a mystery one.\n\n2. Charlie Chan Carries On (Warner Oland) 1931\n\nCharlie Chan solved the murder of a wealthy American found dead in a London hotel room.\n\nThe original English film appears to be lost. This version is a Spanish version with an all Spanish cast (including Charlie Chan) with English subtitles.\n\n3. The Black Camel (Warner Oland) 1931\n\nCharlie Chan solved the murder of movie star Shelah Fayne who was in Honolulu to shoot a film. Bela Lugosi played a famous psychic as well as the brother of a murdered victim.\n\n4. Charlie Chan’s Chance (Warner Oland) 1932\n\nCharlie Chan narrowly escape death by chance. To find his would-be-killer, Charlie must outguess both Scotland Yard and New York City Police.\n\nThis film is confirmed lost to fire. The film below is an audio recreation from the final shooting script and the visuals are stills from the film.\n\n5. Charlie Chan’s Greatest Case (Warner Oland) 1933\n\nCharlie Chan investigated the death of a man named Dan by stabbing in his own home. His first clue comes from the victim’s sister, who noticed a prowler wearing a glow-in-the-dark wristwatch.\n\nThis film is considered lost. Only some outtakes survived which is quite interesting to watch.\n\n6. Charlie Chan’s Courage (Warner Oland) 1934\n\nCharlie is engaged to transport a pearl necklace to a millionaire at his ranch. When murder intervenes he disguises himself as a Chinese servant and begins sleuthing.\n\nThis film is confirmed lost to fire. The film below is an audio recreation from the final shooting script and the visuals are stills from the film.\n\n7. Charlie Chan in London (Warner Oland) 1934\n\nPaul Gray, a young English man was convicted of the murder of Captain Hamilton of the Royal Air Force and sentenced to hang. His sister Pamela Gray asked Charlie Chan to investigate and find the real murderer.\n\n8. Charlie Chan in Paris (Warner Oland) 1935\n\nSome bonds from the Lamartine Bank in Paris had been forged, so they hired Charlie Chan to solve the case.\n\n9. Charlie Chan in Egypt (Warner Oland) 1935\n\nAn archaeologist disappeared while excavating ancient art treasures in Egypt. Charlie Chan must sort out the stories of the archaeological team, and find the truth behind missing priceless treasures and supernatural events.\n\n10. Charlie Chan in Shanghai (Warner Oland) 1935\n\nCharlie Chan arrives in Shanghai to help stop an opium smuggling ring. At a banquet, Sir Stanley Woodland was shot and killed by a gun inside a booby-trapped box. Charlie Chan must find out who is the ring leader of the opium smuggling ring and the murderer of Sir Stanley Woodland.\n\n11. Charlie Chan’s Secret (Warner Oland) 1936\n\nAlan Colby, heir to a vast fortune, reappears after a seven-year absence, only to be murdered before he can claim his inheritance. Charlie Chan was called to investigate the murder, finding the murderer among the myriad of suspects.\n\n12. Charlie Chan at the Circus (Warner Oland) 1936\n\nJoe Kinney, a circus owner, asked Charlie Chan to find who was sending him threatening letters. He was later killed by a gorilla. Or was he? There were quite a bit of inconsistencies in the plot.\n\n13. Charlie Chan at the Race Track (Warner Oland) 1936\n\nA prominent racehorse owner was found dead next to his prized racehorse. It seems logical that the horse has accidentally kicked his owner to death. But Charlie Chan found evidence of foul play.\n\n14. Charlie Chan at the Opera (Warner Oland) 1936\n\nMembers of an opera company were being murdered one by one. An insane ex-member, who had escaped from the asylum, was the logical suspect. Charlie Chan followed the few clues he found to uncover the truth. Boris Karloff starred as Gravelle, the insane opera star.\n\n15.

Another person was murdered in Chan’s hotel room. Charlie Chan puts the few scattered clues together and sets a trap for the murderer.\n\n17. Charlie Chan at Monte Carlo (Warner Oland) 1937\n\nCharlie and Lee Chan were in Monaco for an art exhibition when they stumbled upon a murdered man in a car. The dead man was a bank messenger carrying S$1 million dollars worth of bonds belonging to an American financier. The bonds were missing. Who was the robber and murderer?\n\n18. Charlie Chan in Honolulu (Sidney Toler) 1939\n\nCharlie Chan investigated a murder on board a freighter called Susan B. Jennings bound for Honolulu from Shanghai. The only witness is the secretary Judy Haynes.\n\n19. Charlie Chan in Reno (Sidney Toler) 1939\n\nCharlie Chan was asked by the estranged husband of a murder suspect, convinced of his wife’s innocence, to investigate and solve the murder.\n\n20. Charlie Chan at Treasure Island (Sidney Toler) 1939\n\nCharlie Chan uncovered the identity of a blackmailer known as Dr Zodiac. This movie is full of unexplained mind-reading and hocus-pocus. Trying too hard.\n\n21. City in Darkness (Sidney Toler) 1939\n\nA well-known millionnaire called Petroff was murdered in his own home in Paris amidst the threat of impending war between France and Germany. Suspects include the butler, the business partner, the spy, the counterfeiter, and the burglars.\n\n22.

Murder Over New York (Sidney Toler) 1940\n\nCharlie Chan investigated the murder of an old Scotland Yard friend, Hugh Drake by poisonous gas in locked room.

After the attempt, she split the map into 4 pieces and gave 3 pieces to some of the passengers on a voyage she had been planning to Cocos Island, where the treasure is. Before she could tell Charlie Chan who these 3 people were, she died of fright. Charlie Chan must clear up the mystery and uncover the thief-cum-murderer.\n\n27. Charlie Chan in Rio (Sidney Toler) 1941\n\nThis story is similar to the 1931 The Black Camel. The differences were [1] location: Honolulu to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, [2] Charlie Chan: Oland to Toler, [3] presence of a second killer.\n\n28.
