        "text": "They started as A-movies, original adaptations of the novels, when Fox Studios first produced them. However, Author Earl Derr Biggers only penned six Charlie Chan novels before his death. So after their fifth Chan film, Fox decided to take their detective around the world in B-movies; low budget films made in record time with little financial backing. And the series continued that way later with 20th Century-Fox and Monogram Pictures Corporation. Still, these reels of “gold dust” hosted some significant co-stars and became a worldwide film phenomenon.\n\nIf you’d like to see the entire list of actors and actresses (including animals,) who starred in the 44 Charlie Chan films from 1931 to 1949, just visit Rush Glick’s alphabetical “Cast List” page at The Charlie Chan Family Home. Here’s a peek at some who joined Detective Chan on his crusades for justice (on both sides of the law!):\n\nA: LIONEL ATWELL, (aka: Professor Moriarty.)\n\nB: J. EDWARD BROMBERG.\n\nC: RITA CANSINO, (aka: Rita Hayworth,) CARROLL, LEO G., (aka: Mr. Waverly of U.N.C.L.E.) CHANEY JR., LON (aka: The Wolfman.)\n\nD: DOUGLAS DUMBRILLE.\n\nE: DICK ELLIOT.\n\nF: STEPIN FETCHIT. (Hollywood’s first successful black film star).\n\nG: HENRY C. GORDON.\n\nH: SHEMP HOWARD, (aka: Shemp of The Three Stooges. [A Panama Hat tip to Greg Giordano].)\n\nI: GEORGE IRVING.\n\nJ: VICTOR JORY. (aka: The Green Archer. [A Panama Hat tip to George Madison].)\n\nK: BORIS KARLOFF (aka: Frankenstein.)\n\nL: BELA LUGOSI, (aka: Dracula. [A Panama Hat tip to Barbara Gregorich].)\n\nM: MANTAN MORELAND, (aka: Birmingham Brown.)\n\nN: J. CARROL NAISH, (aka Charlie Chan, 39 episodes, The New Adventures of Charlie Chan.)\n\nO: WARNER OLAND, (aka: Charlie Chan, 16 films.)\n\nP: PUZZUMS (aka: Cat. The first — and only — feline to sign a studio contract.) (Literally. He signed with his paw print dipped in ink; a three-year contract for $50 per week.)\n\nQ: TOM QUINN.\n\nR: GEORGE REEVES, (aka: Superman.) CESAR ROMERO, (aka: The Cisco Kid and The Joker.)\n\nS: MILBURN STONE, (aka: Doc, on Gunsmoke.)\n\nT: SIDNEY TOLER, (aka: Charlie Chan, 22 films.)\n\nU: MINERVA UREKAL.\n\nV: EDDIE VITCH, (aka: caricaturist and mime artist, who’s hundreds of images of Hollywood stars adorned the Brown Derby, 1628 North Vine Street in Hollywood, which became famous for the caricatures that filled its walls.)\n\nW: ROLAND WINTERS, (aka: Charlie Chan, 6 films.)\n\nX: (this spot intentionally left blank)\n\nY: ROBERT YOUNG, (aka: Father Knows Best & Marcus Welby MD.)\n\nZ: GEORGE ZUCCO, (aka: Professor Moriarty.)\n\nThere you are, some of the names you’ll find within each of the 26 letters (well, not counting “x”) on Rush Glick’s Cast List page. Now it is up to you to investigate those letters for more star-power. Call it the A-B-C Murders. I mean Mysteries, not Murders, Mysteries! (Whew, almost put my foot in it with Dame Agatha Christie’s legal department!)\n\n“Success–what is it? A bubble that explodes when touched by human hands.”\n\nThe Black Camel, 1929, Chap 23\n\nP.S. Did you spot my mistake? Somewhere around “K”. ANSWER: Boris Karloff played The Monster…NOT Frankenstein. Frankenstein, or Dr. Henry Frankenstein, was played by Colin Clive. The 1931 movie posters for the film all read, “Frankenstein, The Man Who Made a Monster!”\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated\n\nPublished by Lou Armagno\n\nView all posts by Lou Armagno\n\nPublished"
