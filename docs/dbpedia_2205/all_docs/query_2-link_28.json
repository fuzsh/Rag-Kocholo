Martin has revived the Alfie Awards, which he gave at a private banquet in Glasgow on August 10. See Locus Online coverage with photos here: “2024 Alfie Awards”.\n\nXiran Jay Zhao (left off the 2023 Astounding Award ballot), and R.F. Kuang (whose Babel was disqualified in 2023) received theirs in person. Two more Alfies were announced for others disqualified in 2023, fan writer Paul Weimer, and BDP candidate Sandman (discreetly omitting Neil Gaiman’s name)\n\nMartin held the original Alfies ceremony in 2015, the first year the Sad and Rabid Puppies monopolized the Hugo ballot. “This year all of us were losers,” Martin said, explaining that the Alfies, each made from a streamlined 1950s hood ornament, were his attempt to take a little of the sting off.\n\nHe named “The Alfies” in honor of Alfred Bester, whose book The Demolished Man won Best Novel at the first-ever Hugos in 1953. He explained on his blog that year:\n\nIt was for those ‘invisible losers’ that I decided to create the Alfies. If one accepts that the Hugo has value, these writers had suffered real harm thanks to the slates. There was no way I could hope to redress that… but I could make a gesture. In the door of my room in KC in 1976, Alfie Bester told us that winners can become losers. If so, losers can become winners too. I would give my own awards… and of course I’d name them after Alfie. So that’s how the Alfies came about.\n\nAs it turned out, Martin gave more Alfies in 2016. He didn’t give Alfies in 2017. And after that the purpose of them changed to just being nice tokens for people he thought should be honored. One Alfie was given in 2018 to John Picacio for the Mexicanx Initiative. At Dublin 2019 he presented Jane Johnson and Malcolm Edwards with Alfie Awards for Editing. But in 2024 they have resumed their original purpose of calling attention to people unjustly denied their place on the Hugo Ballot.\n\n[Thanks to Meredith for the story.]\n\nWhere to Watch the Glasgow 2024 Hugo Ceremony\n\nThe public livestream of the Glasgow 2024 Hugo Award Ceremony will begin on YouTube at 20:00 BST (12:00 Noon PDT).

Click for a larger image.\n\nReport of Glasgow 2024 First Main Business Meeting on Saturday\n\nFile 770 has compiled a box score of agenda items handled at the First Main Business Meeting on Saturday at Glasgow 2024. It’s based on Kevin Standlee’s blog entry “2024 Worldcon Day 3: Grinding the Agenda”, and his explanation of some of the intricacies are quoted with permission. Read his post for a full account of the meeting.\n\n(For a summary of Friday’s 2024 Worldcon Preliminary Business Meeting click the link.)\n\nCOVID STRIKES. Standlee reports that as of Saturday at least three Business Meeting attendees, including one member of the BM tech team and the BM Secretary, were down with COVID. Linda Deneroff moved up as the Emergency Holographic Secretary after Alex Acks tested positive at lunchtime.\n\nTL;DR BOX SCORE OF AGENDA ITEMS ADDRESSED AT SATURDAY BUSINESS MEETING\n\nRESOLUTIONS.\n\nD.9. Business Meeting Study Group — PASSED\n\nD.11 Statement of Values for Transparency and Fair Treatment – Considered in Executive Session\n\nD.12 Chengdu Censure – Considered in Executive Session\n\nSee information about Glasgow 2024’s statement about how it will handle these two censure resolutions at the link\n\nAdditional information about the Executive Session has subsequently been posted on the Glasgow 2024 Facebook page:\n\nThe meeting began in executive session, which adopted the following resolution:\n\nResolved, That a committee of seven be elected by ballot to investigate the Hugo Award Administrator for Chengdu Worldcon, the Chengdu Worldcon Hugo Subcommittee, and the chairs of Chengdu Worldcon for allegations regarding their conduct and the administration of the 2023 Hugo Awards, and the committee be instructed to report resolutions regarding its recommendations to the 2025 Business Meeting.\n\nFurther resolved, That items D.11 and D.12 on this year’s Business Meeting agenda be referred to said committee.\n\nFurther resolved, That the committee has the power to fill vacancies by appointment.\n\nThe following folks have been nominated for this committee: Teri Carny, Ingvar Mattsson, Warren Buff, Chris Barkley, Elspeth Kovar, Doctor Science, Randall Shepherd, Todd Dashoff, Chuck Serface, Jason Sandford, Cliff Dunn, Farah Mendlesohn, Nicholas Whyte, Chris Garcia, Alan Bond.\n\nD.13. Apology – PASSED AS MODIFIED — This motion was significantly modified, with the entire preamble (the “Whereas” clauses) removed, and a modified version of the Resolved clauses considered. The portions that declared certain people/works retroactively to be Hugo Award finalists (the last two clauses of the original resolution) were struck out due to the overlap with D.14. The modified resolution was adopted by a show of hands.\n\nD.14. Make Them Finalists – SUBSTITE AMENDMENT PASSED — As originally introduced, this would have attempted to retroactively declare certain people/works to be Hugo Award or Astounding Award finalists. It did appear that this was heading toward being ruled unconstitutional, on the grounds that no single Business Meeting has such a right. Donald Eastlake III introduced a substitute in the form of a constitutional amendment that would allow the Business Meeting to make such declarations by a 3/4 vote, and that would allow a companion resolution passed affecting the 2023 or 2024 Hugo Awards to apply if the amendment is ratified at the 2025 Worldcon. Don’s constitutional amendment got first passage and will be submitted to Seattle for ratification, and the companion resolution that retroactively added the specified finalists was adopted by the necessary 3/4 vote. This does not add those finalists unless the constitutional amendment is ratified in Seattle.\n\nBUSINESS PASSED ON – SECTION E OF THE AGENDA – ALL ITEMS HELD OVER TO SUNDAY\n\nNEW CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS – SECTION F OF THE AGENDA\n\nFirst Pass process applied, where the only actions allowed are Object to Consideration, Postpone Indefinitely, or refer to committee. “No action taken” means the item remains active in the Agenda and when it comes up again, debate time will be set.\n\nF.1 Missing In Action – NO ACTION TAKEN\n\nF.2 The Way We Were – NO ACTION TAKEN\n\nF.3 Required License Agreement – NO ACTION TAKEN\n\nF.4 MPC Procedures – NO ACTION TAKEN.\n\nF.5. Transparency in Hugo Administration — REFERRED TO HUGO PROCESS STUDY COMMITTEE\n\nF.6. Independent Hugo Administrator — REFERRED TO HUGO PROCESS STUDY COMMITTEE\n\nF.7. No Illegal Exclusions — REFERRED TO HUGO PROCESS STUDY COMMITTEE\n\nF.8. Irregular Disqualifications and Rogue Administrators — REFERRED TO HUGO PROCESS STUDY COMMITTEE\n\nF.9. And the Horse You Rode In On — OBJECTION TO CONSIDERATION (3/4 VOTE REQUIRED) FAILED. REFERRED TO HUGO PROCESS STUDY COMMITTEE.\n\nF.10. Make the Change — DIVIDED INTO FOUR SEPARATE PROPOSALS. PARTS OF IT WERE REFERRED TO THE HUGO PROCESS STUDY COMMITTEE. OTHERS WERE POSTPONED INDEFINITELY.\n\nF.11. Hugo Administration and Site Selection Monitoring – MOTION TO POSTPONE INDEFINITELY FAILED. MOTION TO REFER IT TO HUGO PROCESS STUDY COMMITTEE FAILED.\n\nADJOURNED AT 15:00\n\nUpdate 08/11/2024: Added information about the Executive Session from the Glasgow 2024 Facebook page.\n\nPixel Scroll 8/10/24 Mere Pixel Scroll Won’t Thrill Me At All\n\n(1) LEARN ABOUT CHINESE SFF FILM AND TV. A technical problem prevented Xueting C. Ni from participating virtually in a Glasgow 2024 program item, however, the good news is that they distilled the information they wanted to present into this video now available on YouTube: “Glasgow Worldcon: Chinese Scifi Film And TV”.\n\n(2) XIRAN JAY ZHAO TEACHES GRRM A TRICK. Or tries to. They’re both at Glasgow 2024. Afterwards they tell fans, “I’m not telling any of you exclusive top secret information about Winds of Winter.” So there.\n\n(3) DAVE SIGHTING, FOLLOWED BY DAVE SLIGHTING. Ursula Vernon could hardly avoid hearing about this moment at a hotel across from the Glasgow 2024 Worldcon site. For reasons.\n\nAnd the encounter has already inspired Great Art.\n\n(4) GUFF WINNERS ASSEMBLE. Many of the GUFF delegates past and present at Glasgow 2024 took a group photo.\n\n(5) IT IS THE END, MY FRIEND. The last Keith Kato Chili Party happened at Glasgow 2024. Here’s the ribbon:\n\n(6) MORE DARKLIT TESTIMONY. John Durgin has added his account about the problems authors are having with DarkLit Press in “Kosa and the DarkLit debacle”, an open Patreon post.\n\n…There are a number of reasons I’m coming forward now. First off, I had a number of friends who still kept their books with DarkLit, and I didn’t want to possibly hurt their titles by burying the press. Now that the press is folding, that doesn’t matter anymore. Secondly, I’ve seen many of those who spoke up get attacked for doing so by the press. Making Yolanda out to be a villain when we all knew it wasn’t true. Bashing Austrian Spencer’s editing quality when everyone knows he’s a top notch editor (never mind the fact that even if he DID provide a below average edit, he was still OWED money.) And then making Steve out to be some trouble maker for dropping facts that I can tell you are 100% correct.\n\nThe lack of accountability from day one was an issue that many of us discussed in private. We all wanted DarkLit to work. We had established a bond and supported one another wholeheartedly, had no reason to wish any ill will on the success of the publisher….\n\n… It wasn’t until we grilled the new leadership and didn’t accept the vague answers we were given that we finally discovered they didn’t even have access to all the sales numbers yet. This was another massive red flag.\n\nIt was these issues along with seeing the things they said to try and ruin the image of anyone who spoke out that led me to pull my book. I can tell you things got pretty heated in the discord group. I can also tell you there was no damn misogyny in those heated exchanges. Many of the authors who had issues with the way things were headed were female. It really bothers me that Caitlin used that today when that is the furthest thing from the truth. We were left in the dark. We wanted information, and too often didn’t find it out until we wouldn’t take no for an answer. We would have demanded that transparency no matter who was in charge. …\n\nDurgin refers to this statement from Caitlin Marceau, who was Editor-in-Chief of DarkLit Press.\n\n(7) JIM CAUGHRAN (1940-2024). Longtime fan Jim Caughran, Fancyclopedia 3’s first editor, died August 6 at the age of 83. He discovered fandom in the 1950s while a teenager living in Nebraska.\n\nHe was in the cast of the cult favorite fan movie The Musquite Kid Rides Again in 1960 as “Doc Eney”. He was a member of FAPA, The Cult and OMPA. John Trimble published A Fanzine for Jim Caughran in May 1962.\n\nIn the last decade Jim wrote several letters of comment to File 770.

Tolkien’s novels — date back to between 60,000 and 100,000 years ago. The new fossils were excavated at a site called Mata Menge, about 45 miles from the cave where the first hobbit remains were uncovered.\n\nIn 2016, researchers suspected the earlier relatives could be shorter than the hobbits after studying a jawbone and teeth collected from the new site. Further analysis of a tiny arm bone fragment and teeth suggests the ancestors were 2.4 inches shorter and existed 700,000 years ago.\n\n“They’ve convincingly shown that these were very small individuals,” said Dean Falk, an evolutionary anthropologist at Florida State University who was not involved with the research.\n\nThe findings were published this week in the journal Nature Communications.\n\nResearchers have debated how the hobbits — named Homo floresiensis after the remote Indonesian island of Flores — evolved to be so small and where they fall in the human evolutionary story. They’re thought to be among the last early human species to go extinct.\n\nScientists don’t yet know whether the hobbits shrank from an earlier, taller human species called Homo erectus that lived in the area, or from an even more primitive human predecessor. More research — and fossils — are needed to pin down the hobbits’ place in human evolution, said Matt Tocheri, an anthropologist at Canada’s Lakehead University.\n\n“This question remains unanswered and will continue to be a focus of research for some time to come,” Tocheri, who was not involved with the research, said in an email.\n\n(12) SKELETON CREW. “’Star Wars: Skeleton Crew’ Trailer Unveiled At Disney D23” and Deadline would like to tell you about it.
