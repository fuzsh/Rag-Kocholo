        "text": "In America’s polyglot melting pot, that ethnically mixed dreamland of diversity soured by the realities of white supremacy, gems of crystallized culture dot the nation’s major cities, in the form of Little Italies, barrios, and Chinatowns. For immigrant families and their progeny, these spaces act as communal refuges; for naturalized residents (in essence, white people), they act as a space of transaction between the familiarities of home and the exotic oddities of the unknown. These districts are marked by traces of the segregated ghettoes of post-Ellis Island New York; a world not necessarily intended for Western infiltration yet surrounded by its inevitable contact, vis-a-vis local and international tourism. This makes Chinatown an ideal cinematic fishbowl for matters of representation, dual identity, citizenship, immigration and assimilation, constructing a palpable “predicament of boundary”. These themes are at the heart of both Cheng’s and Feng’s writings on these films, and at the heart of Asian American theory. Exemplary usage of this backdrop is found in the Chinatown settings of Flower Drum Song (1961) and Chan Is Missing (1982), both of which make a strong, multigenerational political statement that contributes to the legacy of Asian American cinema and the politics of identity onscreen.\n\nAs a frontier for many immigrants of diverse ethnicities or nationalities, San Francisco has long been a space that witnesses or even inspires many identity-based social movements, including Asian American struggles rooted in Chinatown. In contrast to what outsiders may imagine, however, these ethnic movements have never been coherent, and the term “Chinese American,” along with the “imagined community” it conjures up, becomes highly indefinable when put under different contexts. In fact, as my article points out, the tension of racial politics within Chinatown itself rises and falls as the relationship between the U.S., PRC, and ROC changes. In order to explore this split of identification of Asian, especially Chinese, American people, the article examines the seminal film Chan is Missing, directed by Wayne Wang, a story featuring two Chinese American taxi drivers as they roam around San Francisco in search of their acquaintance Chan.\n\nThe global pandemic of COVID-19 has exacerbated anti-Asian racism—the demonization of the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities as viral origins—in the United States. Offering strategies for inclusion and for identifying tacit forms of misogynistic racism, this article analyzes the manifestation of the ideas of yellow peril and yellow fever in recent films and television series. The spectatorial aspect of racism has both fetishized Asian bodies and erased Asianness from content creators' visual landscapes. These case studies reveal that racialized thinking is institutionalized as power relations in the cultural and political life, take the form of political marginalization of minority groups, and cause emotional distress and physical harm within and beyond the fictional universe. ::::: Keywords: anti-Asian racism, misogyny, tropes of illness, colorblind gaze, techno-Orientalism ::::: DOI 10.1215/25783491-9645962"
