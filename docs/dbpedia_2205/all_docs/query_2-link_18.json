        "text": "Earl Derr Biggers’ magazine and novel yarns on the subject provide the structure for this chapter, like the others. Biggers also provided the constant philosophical sayings which are delivered through the principal character as a means of sewing the action together and maintaining a regular pace. Chan (Warner Oland) rolls them off his proverbial knife – like ‘Some heads, like hard nuts, much better if well cracked’.\n\nIn solving the new mystery, Chan has the help of Inspector Fife of Scotland Yard (H. B. Warner) and Inspector Flannery of New York (James Kirkwood). But as far as really helping they’re just a couple of stooges.\n\nAnother British detective, who gets into the plot as a corpse, is murdered while working on a case in New York. The path to solution is studded with countless false clues and the all-important erroneous arrest of the juve love-interest team (Marian Nixon and Alexander Kirkland). Three people are killed on the way. One is Li Gung (Edward Piel Sr), the Chinese accessory to the criminal mastermind. James Todd’s too youthful appearance in the heavy role accounts for the picture’s chief note of implausibility."
