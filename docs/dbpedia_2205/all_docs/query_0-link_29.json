        "text": "Phiz (Hablot Browne), “Little Dorrit’s Party” — the chapter where we accompany Amy Dorrit and Maggie who walk, sit, and sleep on the streets all night long …\n\nI pretend to-night that I am at a party … I could never have been any use, if I had not pretended a little … Three o’clock, and half-past three, and they had passed over London Bridge. They had heard the rush of the tide against obstacles; and looked down, awed, through the dark vapour on the river; had seen little spots of lighted water where the bridge lamps were reflected, shining like demon eyes, with a terrible fascination in them for guilt and misery. They had shrunk past homeless people, lying coiled up in nooks. They had run from drunkards. They had started from slinking men, whistling and signing to one another at bye corners, or running away at full speed. Though everywhere the leader and the guide, Little Dorrit, happy for once in her youthful appearance, feigned to cling to and rely upon Maggy. And more than once some voice, from among a knot of brawling or prowling figures in their path, had called out to the rest to ‘let the woman and the child go by! … This was Little Dorrit’s party. The shame, desertion, wretchedness, and exposure of the great capital; the wet, the cold, the slow hours, and the swift clouds of the dismal night. This was the party from which Little Dorrit went home, jaded, in the first grey mist of a rainy morning. — Bk 1, Ch 14, “Little Dorrit’s Party”\n\nDear friends and readers,\n\nI must not shirk writing about my listserv group’s reading and discussion of Dickens’s magnificent masterpiece novel, Little Dorrit, which we began mid-October 2023 and have just concluded this past week, early January 2024. It is one of several such astonishing partly because so long works of art to appear in the mid- to later 19th century in Europe: they include Dickens’s own Bleak House, A Tale of Two Cities, Thackeray’s Vanity Fair, Eliot’s Middlemarch and Daniel Deronda, Tolstoy’s War and Peace and Anna Karenina; Trollope has several, Balzac, Manzoni’s I Promessi Sposi. The type continues into the 20th century. I’m not eager to write about Dickens’s because there is a problem with it, recognized early on.\n\nWhile it sold well (as did all Dickens’s novels), before the end of the century, the consensus was it was the “weakest” of Dickens’s novels! How can this be? Shaw was the first to counter and then override the condemnation by showing Dickens’s voiced view, is deep clearly articulated understanding of how society’s and gov’ts and institutions operate to keep a egregiously snobbish, greedy, lazy upper class (aristocracy and the very wealthy merchants and landowners just before) the only rich who control everyone else for the benefit of these specific individuals. We move from entities created in order to Do Nothing, to Thwart Anything Being Done, to keep Society dysfunctional for most, to the marketplaces of capitalism, from the smallest to the supposedly largest institution and ritual is laid bare before us. The epidemic disease is a fixation with getting as much money as possible and then spending it as ostentatiously as possible. Dickens’s characters are fitted into the lowest of echelons (debtor’s prison) to the upper middling (bankers) and we see how impossible it is for any one or any group of people to begin reforms until there is a change of heart among powerful so profound, they’d almost not be the same people any longer. I strongly recommend Helen Small’s edition for Penguin – her notes on everything you do need to know about London circa 1850s, explanations of the prisons, reprints of Dickens’s first drafts are essential.\n\nWhen Mr Dorrit cracks, becomes confused and thinks himself back in the Marshalsea when in Venice, and quickly dies, and then Frederick out of grief and inability to carry on w/o him, is one of the book’s unbearably moving moments\n\n“The night from which no one returns” — Phiz\n\nWhat’s wrong with all this? Nothing. I loved those chapters for their content, as I did the use of imprisonment as a central trope of our lives in the book, the hatred in the book (if not quite honored in his own favorite characters) of worshipped rank, oodles of money, performative false manners, petty egotism, capitalism; I loved and bonded with the good Amy Dorrit (ever shouldering all the burdens of the lives of those she loves, exploited, berated!), the ascetically virtuous Arthur Clennam (who retreats from all forms of profit), was amused by and entertained into accepting many of the well-meaning floundering around them. I have nothing against the soul-wrenching and withering (murdering) of the bad major characters, Mrs Clennam, Mr Dorrit who, poignant as he is, he makes himself a terrific burden on others; these parents utterly ignorant their real impress on their daughter and son.\n\nTrilling says there is too much use of cliché for shorthand, too much resort to generalization and abstraction; it won’t do to to have the narrator or story-teller to locate themselves in some non-personal will in which Dickens is seeking for and has some of his characters searching out for: Peace. Dickens explains too much, a muted despair seeps through the book. We miss the sardonic and sharp witted irony in the narrator of Bleak House, here oddly muttered of Bleak House — Sergeant George, Tulkinghorn, Inspector Bucket. The book lacks precisely what Andrew Davies claims for all Dickens novels in his prologue to his episodes: exuberance, buoyancy, crazy humor, excitement, bizarre characters, continual veins of vividness; sexual passion and violence imitated or parodied. This is what Davies introjects into the matter.\n\nClaire Foy and Matthew MacFayden extraordinarily superb as Amy and Arthur\n\nWhy is the book so slow moving, over-wordy, dare I say indecipherable at moments, boring at others? because (I think) Dickens is himself tuning his anger to fit the melancholy and mourning of his hero and heroine; he keeps himself at a distance to provide cool appraisals. Characters like Mrs Clennam, Mrs Gowan, Mrs Merdle, Casby — from evil to abrasive to callous — are put forward for nakedly painful contemplation. There is more pity for Mr Dorrit, more poignancy in his longing in the first half of the book, and adamantine refusal in the second to be respected, not despised. Think of Frederick Dorrit’s hesitancy. There’s nothing funny here. Bleak, grim, extreme mortification (like when Amy Dorrit tries to Clennam for paying Tip’s debt so he won’t be put in the prison)\n\n************************************\n\nAmy and Tim Courtney as Mr Dorrit — just pitch perfect especially in his mad phases\n\nI’ve written (at some length) about the wonders, beauty, intimacy, “corrections” (Davies’s word) and improvements in Davies’ Little Dorrit (also Bleak house — vast worlds, and the mistakes of Edzard’s Little Dorrit) where I also tell the stories (details found most concisely at wikipedia)\n\nIn this blog I will therefore bypass most of the novel to talk of the ending where a veil is finally drawn aside to show us what was the profoundly inhumane violation that started all the action — Arthur’s 20 year separation from his family and England and his return and determination to find out what is the truth about his mother’s vile business and make reparations — for what, he finds sort of, may be finds out at book’s end.\n\nAt the core of this book remains an unnamed destroyed young woman, Arthur’s mother, whom Arthur’s father, Mr Clennam, married in some clandestine way (perhaps the ancient handfast vows) who Arthur’s uncle cast aside to override with a marriage to the religiously crazed and vindictive second Mrs Clennam (we never learn her first name). The unnamed woman ends up imprisoned in a lunatic asylum, tortured by burning and freezing techniques, and (what else could she do) dies. We are told a ghost haunts the nightmare Clennam house. Arthur was brought up in a continual round of punishment so he should not become like his mother …\n\nSomething similar happens in other Victorian novels: for example, Scott’s Heart of Mid-lothian. How many people talk about it as the story of a young woman, Effie, whose illegitimate baby died being born or was still born and is now accused or infanticide and about to be murdered by the state. No, it’s the story of Jeannie Deans and her heroic walk to save Effie, and Effie is presented as shallow, narrow, vain, almost deserving what happened to her because she did have sex outside marriage.\n\nSue Johnston is a central witness to what happens in Mrs Clennam’s house, especially the machinations about a will where money was left by the uncle who ended the first clandestine marriage of Arthur’s mother and Mr Clennam and overrode it with the second firmly legal marriage of Mrs Clennam to him. This uncle most improbably leaves a legacy to Amy’s uncle, Frederick, because he played such beautiful music to the unnamed woman at some point; this money is upon Frederick’s death to go to his brother’s youngest daughter. (Tus does Dickens’s go into convolutions to make his plot-design come to a compromised end). This is of course Amy — one of the witnesses is Affery, who all novel long is subject to the painful physical abuse of her husband Flintwinch and lives in terror of him. She is so browbeaten she has learned to think what she sees with her own eyes is a dream. Sue Johnston plays the part with just the frenetic anxiety and loss of selfhood such a person might evince:\n\nBut this makes no real sense. If Frederick had inherited money, why did he not share it with Mr Dorrit; why does he not tell Amy? It’s these kinds of utter contradictions that point to the book’s story weaknesses. What the point in Dickens’ mind seems to have been is to show this abused woman, this terrified good soul.\n\nAnother abused woman is Tattycoram, a mulatto orphan whom Mr and Meagles rescue from an institution, but cannot be made to understand they should treat her with consideration and respect, not make her work at the beck and call of their “Pet” daughter, give her the dignity of a human name (Tatty is a nickname one might give a cat). St the close of the book she must return all apologies and abjection to be taken back. Miss Wade who has a similar story of alienation from family but has become distrustful, embittered because of rejection, mistreats Tatty out of her own distorted nature. Little understanding is accorded Miss Wade.\n\nA single scene between these fine actresses, Freema Agyeman as Harriet, Maxine Peake as Miss Wade, suggests more of their inner lives than Dickens can\n\nWhy did Dickens bring them up — in order to castigate them? This resembles the unnamed woman who is never done any justice to but at the end of the novel has her story covered up for the “good” of Arthur, his peace of mind. What?\n\nA whole continuum of women deprived are slid over: the breathless agonizingly desperate (for something to do) Flora, not acceptable to Dickens as fat (like the wife he deserted), mentally child-like Maggie, who follows Amy about everywhere … Standing up for herself — by taking on the world’s values, we have Amy’s sister, Fanny, whose power is limited to what she can earn as a dancing girl unless attached to a male with money. I omit the villainesses. The only (inexplicably) jolly woman in the book is Mrs Plornish with her kindly husband also of limited power. The corresponding tender-hearted men include John Chivery, his father, Pancks (the rent collector who like Affery turns on his oppressor at book’s and movie’s end).\n\nNone of these characters drive the plot-design, where nothing much happens. For examples: the Dorrits are broke; the Dorrits are super-rich; the Dorrits are broke again. Pet (or Minnie), an apparently mindless child-woman brought up by the emotionally incompetent Meagles marries a petty sadist, Gowan himself, whose mother spends the book looking down on the unfortunate girl. Mrs Merdle with her large bosom covered with jewels goes bankrupt after her husband kills himself rather than be exposed as a fraud, embezzler, forger; she snubbed Fanny, Amy’s sister, now Fanny snubs her. Clennam rescues the inventor Doyce to set up a business for him, and then Doyce rescues Clennnam from imprisonment for going bankrupt. Pancks collects and then refuses to collect rent. Tatty leaves the Meagles for Miss Wade; Tatty leaves Miss Wade for the Meagles. Chivery’s heart is broken when Amy prefers Clennam. At least there is no reversal as if it were a fictional story. Have I omitted anything? Humor from the terror Cavaletto fears of Rigaud, a blackmailer and murderer — the great knot in the money angle of the book is Rigaud’s blackmail of Mrs Clennam. The book itself feels like a backdrop or nightmare apart and is still. You are entertained by moments of encounter and reversals.\n\nAnton Lesser as Merdle (equivalent of Trollope’s Melmotte) meeting Emma Pierson as Fanny Dorrit holding her own\n\nThis is part of the book’s “problems”: it lacks a driving forward force.\n\n***************************\n\nThe book will teach you about the political and economic and social worlds around us today — anatomize or disclose the stupid heartlessness, and socially dysfunctional social systems we must live in today. Sudden insights into terrible aspects of the human character in much variety. Ditto — conveyed by dialogue as much as direct invective. There are extraordinary descriptions of all sorts — from prisons to the Alps, aching beauty caughtm then real streets, buildings, countryside A sudden cascading of characters’ activities which tells us where everyone is. The very ending is transcendent.\n\nThey paused for a moment on the steps of the portico, looking at the fresh perspective of the street in the autumn morning sun’s bright rays, and then went down.\n\nWent down into a modest life of usefulness and happiness. Went down to give a mother’s care, in the fulness of time, to Fanny’s neglected children no less than to their own, and to leave that lady going into Society for ever and a day. Went down to give a tender nurse and friend to Tip for some few years, who was never vexed by the great exactions he made of her in return for the riches he might have given her if he had ever had them, and who lovingly closed his eyes upon the Marshalsea and all its blighted fruits. They went quietly down into the roaring streets, inseparable and blessed; and as they passed along in sunshine and shade, the noisy and the eager, and the arrogant and the froward and the vain, fretted and chafed, and made their usual uproar.\n\n— the marriage at novel’s end\n\nThe book is also filled with unsolved problems — Dickens can carry on at such length only when he has an external plot-design based on outward suspense that truly interests us, e.g., Bleak House. He has not confronted his own buying into central mechanisms for keeping some groups in society miserable, especially women.\n\nEllen\n\nA photograph of the snowy Yorkshire Dales (light cover of snow), 2023 (from All Creatures Great & Small)\n\nDear friends and readers,\n\nOver the past few years I’ve made a habit of writing Christmas blogs — on movies I’ve seen, Christmas specials of TV series, books or stories read, or as a theme in a long-running TV series (e.g., “Christmas in Poldark“). I suspect I’ve written too many, of which too many were overlong (just type in Christmas in the “search” box to the right side at the bottom). Well, this year I have but one thus far (and may not have another), the ghost stories I read recently in a Politics and Prose online course with a professor of British literature, Victorian specialist, Nicole Miller. I enjoy ghost stories, and myself taught them for about 3 years at George Mason, and know she partly chose the topic as appropriate to Christmas time – she also teaches a much longer-length one at the college where she is (presumably) tenured. The telling of such stories is presented by people today as having been prime entertainment during Christmas in the 19th century, the first era of our present commercialized Christmas increasingly centered on family and friends.\n\nJohn Millais, “Christmas Story-Telling,” “Christmas Supplement,” London News, 20 December 1862\n\nOn our Every-Other-Week online Trollope reading group (hosted by the London Trollope Society), we may be said to have almost suffered through one of Trollope’s rare failures, “The Two Heroines of Plumpington”. I say almost because the story was rescued by the hard work and absorbing information the speaker bout the story, Chris Skilton, brought to and out of the story. He showed how autobiographical it slyly is, and its themes of class, ambition, money. After he finished people in the group immediately began to talk of problems or flaws in the story.\n\nI offered the idea that writing Christmas stories was such a trial for Trollope, such a struggle to pull off, because Christmas stories have since the inception of this custom been associated with or outright ghost stories, and nothing was further from Trollope’s robust and sceptical temperament — than either the prevalent type, unnerving, uncanny, often with a malevolent revenant, come back to haunt indiscriminately whomever is unlucky enough to enter their imaginary; or the type Dickens seems to have been the first to invent, in his The Christmas Carol, where benign presence (or presences) come down from somewhere determined to retrieve the past, and redeem the present of some suffering wronged or wrong-full person. Is not this It’s a Wonderful Life, even if 20th century disbelief seems to demand a being no-one credits for real, an angel who looks anything but? Clarence, we all instantly remember, needed to be promoted — what a mid-century American comic take for the sake of probability.\n\nHenry Travers as Clarence (It’s a Wonderful Life)\n\nMiller’s was a very rich course; we met for 2 and 1/2 hours for three sessions (each staying over an extra half hour) and read some interesting (some of the best) stories by Dickens, Henry James, and Edith Wharton. I’ve written about The Turn of the Screw here (as “the problem of moral panic”), and several of the Edith Wharton’s on this blog, Austen Reveries and the gothic section of my website (see Reading … Winter Solstice, “The Lady’s Maid’s Bell,,” “Afterward,” “Mr Jones,” as well as Dickens’s “The Signalman: the trauma of technology.”\n\nBefore each of the three discussions about the individual authors, Prof Miller held forth on ghost stories themselves, or some aspect of them related to the author we were exploring that session. It seems the form was especially reveled in by British and American authors; and may be said to emerge archetypically from fear of shadows (all sorts) in our homes, accidents and traumas surrounded by an atmosphere of the new large cities, phantoms from newness, unknown “strange” people, eruptions from people’s pasts, the old (haunted houses), the new (scientific discoveries, psychical research), dread of death and the dead (seances). M.R. James (see my blog on recent film adaptations to be found on YouTube) singled out reveling in spectacles theatric, evoking from the mind psychological allurement of dramatic interaction, strong literary high quality (your language must be powerful and precise), frightening and short. The reader must be complicit; the author creative and original. The ghost and Christmas story is bound up with our reaction to winter, the cold, the darkness, change. The story that ends with redemption offers balm to our anxieties over time, non-integration of ourselves (we are left out, left behind), a saving of a desolate soul. This is a view I agree with.\n\n**************************************************\n\nThe book I used to read Dickens’ ghost stories in is Peter Haining’s Complete Ghost Stories of Charles Dickens, Franlin Watts, 1983, with original (Phiz) illustrations. They are too small to make the nightmare impact intended. I read a number of them and was impressed how the pattern we find in Dickens, of a withdrawn man transformed by an experience of the supernatural recurs; similarly, that Dickens was himself sceptical of the reality of ghosts, despite the Christian providential nature of his paradigms. Near the later part of his life he while traveling with Ellen Ternan and her mother was involved in a disastrous train crash, and the trauma of that is translated into “The Signalman.” Scrooge resembles him in life in numerous ways — which has also been pointed out by others.\n\nAlistair Sim as Scrooge on Christmas morning, fairly hysterical with relief as well as cheer\n\nSince so many of us have heard or watched A Christmas Carol, and (I assume read about it), I shall keep this section brief (see my blog on how I cried and cried the last time I watched). The famous opening rivets us. Insistence on how Marley was dead. All is dark, bleak, Scrooge a withered utterly selfish sardonic alone old man. The clock tolls throughout the story: there are many bells. The uncanny and inanimate come alive. The point (as in other stories in this volume) is to reform, transform Scrooge. The air he travels through with the “Ghost of Christmas Past” is filled with phantoms. A Blakean world of the dispossessed. “Christmas Past” is presented as a child-like old man. We see the boy abandoned. We see how little it literally cost Fezziwig to make cheerful scenes for all. Christmas present is the ancient Green Man turned sardonic. A cornucopia of delights. The famous boy and girl, Want and Ignorance — wretched, abject. Then the last fear of death. This phase continues modern desolate scenes — like the lighthouse in the storm. Amber colored. Scrooge cannot face that he is not mourned, that he is erased, his things stolen. Then when Scrooge awakens and it is only the next day and he feels he has time to change, the intense joy.\n\nAn illustration from a volume of Dickens’s Christmas stories, 1867: The apparition, more in the mood of “The Signalman”\n\nBy contrast, the deeply darkly haunted nature of “The Signalman” and by the end how little explained. This comes right out of Dickens’s own traumatic experience of a vast train crash, where he played the part of a hero, rescuing people at risk of his own life. Prof Miller thought Dickens’s fiction itself as a whole altered after this incident. The man isolated by technology; given no chance to educate himself and live among men due to his class. The earlier stories in the volume are yarns, the later ones sceptical.\n\n**********************************************\n\nA still of Michelle Dockery as the awestruck governess, maintaining some calm (Sandy Welch, 2009, framed by a story of an unjust imprisonment of an apparently disposable woman)\n\nFor Dickens, much of the class time was taken up by “A Christmas Carol,” which is a literary gem, perfect masterpiece and she hardly got to “Signalman,” so she avoided “Turn of the Screw” until near the end — incurring resentment I felt among some of the people in the room who were there to discuss this never-endingly intriguing (ambiguous) novella. I learned that the misogyny has gotten so bad that some people regard the governess as wholly a liar, now living in an asylum (thus degrading her utterly and making the manuscript inexplicable), which explained to me for the first time why Sandy Welch’s 2009 Turn of the Screw is framed by showing us the governess put unfairly into an asylum while the inset flashback story has the children in utter collusion with the evil ghosts (there all right).\n\nQuint and Miss Jessel from the 2009 film\n\nFlora — look at the child’s face\n\nWhen first published, it was rightly seen as capable of being interpreted as a governess caught between two deeply harmful corrupting spirits and susceptible yet still partly innocent (unknowing fully) children.\n\nFor Henry James, though I had many of the stories separately in decent editions with introductions and notes, I bought the recommended copy (sold by Politics and Prose too), Ghost Stories of Henry James, Wordsworth edition, 2001, re-issued 2008, with an introduction by Martin Scofield. The book also includes James’s prefaces to all the stories but The Turn of the Screw, and his musings/introduction to The Turn of the Screw. Scofield is very helpful. An early story, “The Ghostly Rental,” surprised me by unnerving me. I began to have the kind of inward fears of myself that M.R. James can provoke. James has the power of sudden single powerful words to make the reader feel a ghost is suddenly caught on a page. There are moral lessons in “Sir Edmund Orme” (against bad actors), and stories that hint at Bluebeard and Medea paradigms (murderous men, vengeful women). There is a coolness here; he undermines beliefs in family love, is himself almost anti-children — who are seen to be collusive and alienating in stories beyond The Screw. In one story, not a ghostly one, a novella, The Other House, James has a group of people murder a child and get away with it. After that I could not read James for years.\n\nFor Henry James, Miller concentrated on “The Friend of the Friends,” where the friend is no friend to two others, and in the story’s end does all she can to keep them apart (out of jealousy) and “The Jolly Corner,” where the corner is a site of telepathic unnerving doubles, signaling death, as well as a portal to an imagined world where James could overcome his revulsion a reality, and invent richly. The conceit of the “The Friend of the Friends” are the two targeted people each had a parent who died and appeared to them at the moment of death. They are obsessed with meeting but somehow something always comes up to prevent the encounter; until at the death of the woman they do meet, and our narrator believes this enables them to meet ever more. In both stories we are in a thicket of dreams and events that are like the forest of fairy tales. I liked the way she talked of “The Jolly Corner” to make it an explanation of James’s obsessive themes of life, living having passed him by, missing out on being another admirable self, life as an adventure because the need for a sense of security makes the narrator withdraw to seeming safety, but leaving his conscience haunted. Alice Staverton in the story, the childhood friend, could stand in for Constance Fenimore Woolson.\n\nJodhi May as the governess is the victim, if herself neurotic, of Colin Firth, the exploitative master, in Nick Dear’s rendition\n\n*****************************************\n\nFrom the edition I was reading, The Ghost Stories of Edith Wharton, Scribner, 1973, illustrations Laslo Kubinyi\n\nThe third and last, the Edith Wharton session seemed to satisfy everyone — equal time given to about 6 stories. Prof Miller saw Wharton as pulling together the theorist, personal experience, a cultivation of art, with a real feel for the uncanny. Her ghost stories are mostly post WW1 (though they can be set back in early modern and 18th century times) and are a reaction to that calamity as well as her study of Freud exploration of the irrational inner life. Dickens is writing Victorian and Wharton 20th century ghost stories, with James bridging the two eras. Yet the characteristics of each are not predictable by era: in James the ghosts erupt from within people, are their terrifying other selves. I should not omit sceptical humor in Dickens (especially from Scrooge), and how quietly good M.R. James is at this\n\nIn one filmed story of M.R. James, a character needs binoculars in order to see the ghostly castle\n\nWharton’s stories are of severe female oppression/ imprisonment, of people haunted by dead people, some of whom remove a beloved from us. In “Kerfol” (see the above illustration) an early modern woman is kept alone as in a cage and each time she finds a companion in a dog, the dog is slaughtered; “Mr Jones” reveals a similar story that occurred 2 centuries ago, with a vampire controlling two women in the mansion in the present day, seemingly idyllic. These stories are filled with places women must flee from. “Pomegranate Seed” differs in being aligned with the myth of Persephone, only now Persephone is a dead wife who writes letters to her husband now married to our heroine, letters which deprive him of life’s blood, he himself goes grey, feebler, and eventually, like the husband in “Afterward” disappears. I remember how when I first read them, they made me feel dread I would lose Jim similarly. Well I’ve lost him, but not to a ghost. Like James, some of these stories are intended to baffle us, with the ghost visible only to the seer. “Fullness of Life” an early, and “All Souls” a late story both concentrate sheerly on the inner life of the protagonist, so there is little left of the Victorian gothic furniture, not even revenants for sure. Gentle souls, hounded, abandoned in a sinister silence — “Afterward” has the heroine for the rest of her life in that still house in the library room with some “horror” she feels is there forever after. This is like the person who sees these accusatory eyes after he has done some morally reprehensible (if not criminal) deed.\n\nFrom “Afterward:” this is before the woman has lost her husband but has premonitions, glimpses a ghost from the old house’s parapet\n\nAs with Dickens and James, but more so (more stories) Wharton’s ghost stories have been filmed marvelously well, in her case by the BBC in the 1980s in a series called Shades of Darkness, produced (naturally) for Christmas. “Bewitched” becomes a vampire-witch story as Eileen Atkins as the grim central heroine (reminding me of the close of Ethan Frome) demands the men in the room drive a stake through the heart of a dead woman said to be appearing to and harassing her worn husband.\n\n*********************************************\n\nI’m probably not doing justice to the three classes or the stories: nowadays my notes are scarcely readable: my hands cannot hold a pencil tight enough and write the Pitman forms precisely accurately enough to read back all that I am trying to get down — my hands are the ghosts of what they have been. Still I hope I have said enough that is understandable that might lead my reader to read some of these stories and see the movies for yourself.\n\nIt’s not true that such matter must be short; the very best I know of are novellas, and if I had the courage, I’d do a course in these five: Margaret Oliphant’s Beleaguered City, Henry James’s Turn of the Screw, Shirley Jackson’s The Haunting of Hill House, Susan Hill’s Woman in Black, and Valerie Martin’s Mary Reilly. All but one (Beleaguered City) have been filmed, all but one by a woman,and two of these (Hill House and Woman in Black) have produced the two most frightening the memorable (as in leaving me with nightmare images I am afraid my mind will call up — Hill House, Robert Wise, 1960; and Woman in Black, 1993 BBC). I’d be grateful to any reader of this blog who can cite further novella-long brilliant ghost stories.\n\nPauline Moran as the terrifying “woman in black,” a woman deprived of her child, who goes about snatching other children — I actually still fear seeing this image at the other end of a room late at night\n\nWe have seemed to move away from Winter Solstice or Christmas. So we return to our respectable or seasonal acceptable topic briefly. So why are so many a typical Christmas story also a ghost story? Because as the year closes in, we want to retrieve time, look for redemption for ourselves, but also remember the past with all its pain and loss and seek a way to express this most deeply. We do not look for moral lessons, and pace Trollope, are not longing for stories of charity and forgiveness as such, but only as the latter theme (forgiveness) works itself into what has been so harmful for us across our lives. For the rest of the year the delving into the atavistic parts of the human psyche, condition, experience, Kafka-like (see Jack Sullivan’s little book on ghost stories as “elegant nightmares”) is what ghost stories do.\n\nAfter all this I cannot say “Merry Christmas!” but I can wish for us all, after the nervous laughter has done its distancing work from the experience of the ghost story (how we ended Miller’s class), hope for us all that the experience of retrieval and redemption Dickens dreamed up and Frank Capra re-caught again will be the one we know.\n\nNow I ask my readers to forgive me: I am very sad this year; the death of my beloved female cat, Clarycat, has made this year, this Christmas, one where I am feeling the years’ losses and wish I could be haunted by her out of her loyal love for me.\n\nClarycat missing us, photographed close-up during one summer time away for Jim and I\n\nEllen\n\nBill Nighy as Mr Williams\n\nAimee Woods as Miss Harris (Living, 2022, Ishiguro and Nighy, the moving spirits)\n\nCillian Murphy as Oppenheimer presented as timeless, and Kitty Oppenheimer and Emily Blunt playing her as she grew older (Oppenheimer, 2023)\n\nThis is to defy the ludicrous pairing of the Greta Gertwig’s Barbie movie and Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer. Barbie is a doll with a toxic body for women (one of the contributors to eating disorders) with a look of joyful compliance on her face (any kind of sex, any kind of capitalism) Living is about the preciousness of life however poignant and inadequate and short-lasting our moments of joy. I’m combining Oppenheimer with this relatively recent film, Living, screenplay writer Kazuo Ishiguro, starring Bill Nighy. Living is now available streaming. They are linked because Ishiguro is Japanese-British and a great deal of his deeply poignant tragic outlook comes from his having grown up in a Japan upon which these atom bombs were leased, and having seen the horrific damage radiation and the Promethean explosion caused); Ikiru is a Japanese product.\n\nI invite others to make these your pair for returning to going out to the movies this week and the still real pleasures of streaming from home.\n\n***********************************************************\n\nTom Burke as the failed writer who helps Mr Williams not to be robbed and to live a little in a local working class spa\n\nLast night I re-watched Living — I was able to dwell deeply in it. It’s a redo of Kurosawa’s Ikiru — while the confrontational theme is the indifference of bureaucracy to citizens in need of a service or help (I know too much about that now from the dysfunctional passport agency), the deeper theme is life seen through the lens of a man’s coming death: his attempt to live and how poignant this is; his moving the bureaucracy to do one small good for a constituency, a playground for a group of working class women for their children.\n\nA series of links (I am crediting Russell Stone and Stephanie Simcox for all of these; they were presented during class at OLLI at Mason when the class had watched Living and then discussed the film together — and are sparing me the need to work to produce any longer remarks)\n\n1, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVo5kLt_-BU\n\n2. . https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/-it-s-about-procrastination-actor-bill-nighy-on-the-award-winning-living-156252229997\n\n3. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVMS7X0YIOk\n\n4. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPTNYIyRk4U&t=933s\n\nAlso of interest:\n\n5 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzSf_bnqLoQ\n\nI think Living superior to Ikiru because the secondary people whom Mr Williams meets are far more personalized, individuated, come across as real complex people. In Kurosawa’s film, all the characters but the hero remain generalized types. I felt for Tom Burke as the anonymous gifted writer Mr Williams meets at a working class British spa. He conveyed the compassion and despair and acceptance of life the movie intended.\n\n***************************\n\nThis afternoon I saw Oppenheimer. Here are two excellent documentaries you can accompany the film with (for context). First, an outline of the story in this review:\n\nhttps://tinyurl.com/y9t4sctf\n\nOn YouTube To end all war: Oppenheimer and the Atomic Bomb — is truly worth it, 1 hour and one half — includes how the US govt hounded him when he tried to control the use of this bomb. I don’t know who has the power to do this but someone has blocked my transfer of the YouTube video from YouTube to this site. I can’t even use the link as that produces a black box. The link here will get you to the right page. It’s the first video on top.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=To+end+all+war%3A+Oppenheimer+and+the+Atomic+Bomb+\n\nOppenheimer, the real story, 2023 documentary available at BritBox and on Prime Video, is also very good, more narrowly autobiographical.\n\nOn Nolan’s movie itself, my take:\n\nThe movie theater actually seemed to have a lot of people — not super-crowded but it did not seem empty. Two auditoriums for Oppenheimer, and one for Barbie and something else.\n\nGo see it, vote for it in effect.\n\nSo honest reaction. The first 20 minutes — very irritating. I almost left but that I am in this movie course and so should sit there for the sake of the class and hoped-for discussion to come. Ridiculously unreal conversations emphasizing sarcasms; conversation is not a trading of jeering barbs except if you want to provoke laughter in a movie-house from the inane. But then the story kicked in. Just seen it the one time so unaware when this started.\n\nWhen the riveting story matter of the hounding of Oppenheimer in this small closed room began and alternated with more than one time line, I was pulled in. Nolan used color to try to indicate closer to the present but he was not consistent. That the movie is meant to be seen more than once is shown by how at the close we revert in memory (and with brief flashbacks) to what we didn’t realize was prime fodder for this “closed hearing.” For example, what did Oppenheimer talk with Einstein about while Lewis Strauss became enraged as he felt snubbed. I have not read American Prometheus and it strikes me this is one of those films where there is an interaction between book and film.\n\nSo let me move to what’s important: it is vindication of Oppenheimer. If you knew only vaguely that he was persecuted (as was his Russian counterpart, another of these “geniuses”), now you know his life story, the 1930s experience of communism-socialism (the film is too careful here and afraid to show truly how there was an American communist party supporting the Spanish republicans), Oppenheimer’s first mistress (gratuitous embarrassing nakedness) and then back and forth, not always easy to follow how the Manhattan project emerged. Full disclosure: when I was a child my father would tell me what an evil man was Edward Teller, profoundly obtuse about what nuclear bombs could do. Emily Blunt is terrific in her part; Branagh gets to pay Nils Bor — a tremendous compliment. I know many of the names because of years of reading Feynman’s “Los Alamos from Below” — he was very much a junior person. I admit getting a great kick out of picking out the actor playing those drums — dressed up like a young Feynman — Feynman did play those drums as the first test went off. He was a socially awkward nervous man and this part of his way of participating in social life.\n\nI thought the final ending through maybe not historical true, where all characters get together to expose Stuart Lewis very effective, but wrong-headed the way US movies can be — it was the situation — the McCarthyite era that Lewis exploited.\n\nThere are some important matters left out of the film: ought the US to have dropped the first bomb; should the allies have tried to persuade the Japanese these were horrifically deadly bombs? could we have. More realistically ought we to have dropped the 2nd within 3 days, giving the Japanese so little time to respond to the first. Also how devastating are the deadly results of radiation. I have some links in the comments to discussions of these issues.\n\nCillian Murphy’s career should be made (if it hasn’t been already) — except he is not a glamorous male icon. Ditto Emily Blunt.\n\nDon’t miss it.\n\nFun for me was to spot the actor playing Richard Feynman. I taught his Surely You’re Joking, Mr Feynman! and What Do You Care What Other People Think! in a course called Advanced Writing on the Natural Science and Tech at least 33 times; the latter includes his ironic (hilarious and serious) “Los Alamos from Below,” where he is a “low person” but there and yes he played the bongo drums frequently and played them through the first denotation of the atomic bomb. The actor’s hair and dress recalled Feynman. Feynman did write separately and seriously about the dangers of these nuclear bombs, but (unlike Oppenheimer) he denied feeling guilt.\n\nFor the New Statesman, Pippa Bailey wrote a positive review dwelling on the artistic techniques, uses of color and black-and-white to reveal two perspectives across the film: Oppenheimer’s Tormented Soul. Manohla Dargis also writes fully and intelligently about the film as art and story: A Man for Our Time.\n\nThe first gadget:\n\nIt seems to me crucially important as many people as possible see at least the first documentary as we hear Putin and Biden (more quietly) go to it, implicitly threaten one another with (in Biden’s case now multi-cluster bombs) and Putin modern nuclear weapons. That would certainly end all wars. See below Amy Goodman’s interviews with historians of this project (in the comments), and our nuclear age: omitted from the film is any serious consideration of the effects of radiation and an alternative consideration of where the US should have used these bombs.\n\nEllen\n\nBruno, the irresistible son (Enzo Staiola)\n\nAntonio Ricci (Lamberto Maggiorani), his desperate father lands a job (Bicycle Thieves)\n\nSilvana (Silvana Mangano), one of two central heroines rice workers\n\nFrancesca (Doris Dowling), her rival & friend\n\nA young Vittorio Gassman, tremendously gifted man (Bitter Rice)\n\nFriends and readers,\n\nYou owe this blog review to my observing that coming this fall, there will be two movie courses I know I’ll love at OLLI at AU (under headers like “moral and gender studies”) and one I’m taking just now at OLLI at Mason (less pretentious but still recent) fine movies. To my also noticing that Susan Bordo’s substack newsletter endorsing with grandiose language a second movie just made from Nabokov’s pornographic Lolita (the latest by Adrian Lyne, who characteristically makes movies with “queers” the vulnerable victim). Both films are violent pornography targeting women, from a book where an author (Nabokov) exploits the use of irony to encourage his audience to revel in sado-masochism and cruelty to women. Third, the resounding success of Succession: about as vicious a set of capitalist puppets as one can find (with the kick how they make fun of others, and subtextually exposing “weakness”).\n\nSomewhere some place here on the Internet someone ought to be pointing to actual great, good, nobly moral films. I studied and taught these as part of my Italian Novels of the 20th century course this past spring, but they transcend their particular origin while remaining firmly products of the post WW2 era.\n\nBriefly, Italian neo-realistic films made between 1946 and sometime in the 1970s. There are recognized 7 indisputable masterpieces of this subgenre in Italian, of which Bicycles Thieves is one. What they share: a mode of visual storytelling such that the cameras are set into a location of ordinary scenic reality, be it city really extant or country, or places – apartment houses, clubs – where ordinary people live, work, play. The people of the story are impoverished, desperately deprived which we see them every day coping with; our characters who we are to care intensely about are in some kind of crisis – and the way the situation is portrayed the viewer is made to imagine reality does not have to be this way: Rossellini Open City, Rome (Anna Magnani); Paisan Germany Year Zero (1946); 2 more by Di Sica, Shoeshine, and Umberto D (the 1st about children, the second people needing their pension); Visconti’s The Earth Trembles. A not quite forgotten equivalent, pushed to the side because by an open communist, using box office stars and film noir techniques, Giuseppe De Santis, Bitter Rice (Riso Amaro) about women rice field workers; also forgotten is a central woman screenplay writer for all many of these, Suso Cecchi d’Amico.\n\nThese have their origins in the 1930s, in the US in King Vidor Our Daily Bread, in Italy in the 1930s where there was no tightly controlled single govt (as in Germany) so class conflict was centrally on the agenda, and a number of central people in the Neo-realistic films got their start in Mussolini’s theaters; France with Jean Renoir (coming out of German Expressionism); UK so complicated to discuss (the class system upheld still ) and US too sad (the intransigent anti-socialist McCarthy era) so all we’ve got at the time is William Wyler (remember The Ox-bow Incident) and Frank Capra, Marty and Pawnbroker. In England in the 1950s, a few unforgettable ones are made where ironic deep rebellion is central: The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner, This Sporting Life, Room at the Top, A Touch of Honey (again just one by a woman allowed in). From perspective of literary people this kind of cinema in Italy is 1890s verismo novels ( which you may catch in Operas like Mascagni’s Cavalleria Rusticano and Leoncavallo’s Pagliacci). For England and the US short realistic novellas and plays (Angry Young Men type or very sad). The Soviet school of cinema in the early 20th century influenced these 20 years of films. Montage invented, juxtaposition.\n\nI could stop here and just cite two wonderful video discussions. Neorealistic films: Mark Shiel, Life as It is:\n\nJust on Bitter Rice: Brian Berry\n\n************\n\nBut I’ll include a couple of paragraphs each: Some have described The Bicycle Thieves and others of the famous seven as dramas of loneliness, of isolation. Whether it be that Antonio is tricked by a group of bicycle thieves, or himself set upon a community who defends the bicycle thief or attack him for stealing one of theirs, he is ever alone. Amid the worst thing of all: anonymous crowds. We are so used to it we don’t think about it – the rehearsal of a play or entertainment in the same spot a political meeting is held. Repeated disjunctions between the image we see and what is asserted about it. The point endlessly is social reform, a regeneration of a sense of self – as in Carlo Levi’s argument for eradicating fascism from Italy and set up a genuinely socialist egalitarian society, the basis must be self-esteem for all. That you have the right to be indignant, to fight for rights for rights. The one hopeful note is the boy, his son, better than him at recognizing absurdity, at sticking to a task, at sheer loving.\n\nThe film asks the question of what is a hero? It’s anti-Italian state in all its forms. Dramatizing sports (very popular) but also gambling and fortune telling. Camerini in the 30s depicted the depression, unusual but not forbidden altogether, using inexperienced actors, improvisation, and in later years Camerini learned to talk of his use of montage – stills following stills. The story element not upper class. It also as far as it dares exposes the uselessness, meagreness of the Catholic church’s endeavors to function as a charitable space within a community.\n\nBicycle Thieves shows a communal tragedy. Music is very evocative – in many of these films the musical paratexts and themes are central to part o their effect: they repeat and repeat. Are accused of sentimentality – maybe to the super-rich it is despicable sentimental to care about the troubles of others but I daresay that is not true of our own. The American Everyone’s Protest Novel is sentimental.\n\nRead Marilyn Fabe’s Closely Watched Films, Chapter 6: Bicycle Thieves (you must scroll down and click to enlarge)\n\n************\n\nBerry suggested Bitter Rice combined the techniques and outlook of neo-realism with highly melodramatic uses of film noir (especially at film’s end in the granary) – dark and light imagery. The presence of box office stars also skews it so we get highly theatrical presentations – the death by hanging from a hook of Walter (Vittorio Gassman), the PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) of Silvana after she’s been raped, led to shoot people, betray the other rice workers that leads to her suicide by jumping from the high top of a watchtower. Berry talks of 2 romances, but I fail to see how Walter’s behavior to either woman can be seen as romantic: the old myth of women attracted to vicious men is operative in this film. Ralph Vallone as Marlo, a brother type.\n\nAmong the many feminocentric (before the word existed) motifs of the film is women’s friendships, women as a support network for one another – conversations about things other than men. It passes the Bechtel test before Bechtel was born. Women with babies. The central couple of the film are Francesca and Silvana – we have a use of announcer for over-voice. The film expands our geographical temporal understanding of Italian realities.\n\nOn Silvana Mangano. To make a somewhat respectable career, she was somewhat careful what roles she took, and never became as famous or rich as she could have. This one of her early key remembered films. She also married the director and helped his career -– de Laurentis. As a committed Giuseppe de Santis was determined to expose the false myths about women as producers of food (that was the second essay I sent – a Song of Protest). Rice workers had a reputation for militancy. Silvana dressed to evoke Rita Hayworth (remember the poster poor Antonio in Bicycle Thieves was putting up so badly was of Rita Hayworth).\n\nBitter Rice evokes a connection between the fecund female body and the landscape — this kind of association is a throwback, refusing to acknowledge independent individual action the way men are granted, she is not an animal. To De Santis credit the film is not picturesque, not sentimental; you redeem yourself by working; fighting over rules against non-union people are part of the reality. Silvana reads photo novels, dances American style dances (her mother was English); she is aspirational, moody irritable – all this sets her apart and makes her friendly with Francesca also an outsider.\n\nRead Pasquale Ianone: A Field In Italy\n\nUnlike Bicycle Thieves, Bitter Rice was excluded from chief festivals, criticized heavily as left-wing propaganda, nonetheless it made its way as proletarian romance, 5th highest grossing film in Italy 1949-50; NYTimes critic liked its plainness and directness. Another essays about its direct Italian context and defiance of fascist stereotypes show it was meant to expose the pressure women into becoming work horses, mothers as if that would make them powerful and happy.\n\n***************************\n\nAnd now I have for a while concluded all the blogs I wanted to make out of the wonderful course I taught this spring, which matter I will do again, but with a different set of books & films from the era.\n\nThe women returning to their shacks, working, laughing in the wet and rain\n\nSeeking the stolen bicycle in the downpour\n\nEllen\n\n1963 Tom Jones: Tom (Albert Finney), Sophia (Susannah York) — Tony Richardson & Tom Osborne (see blog)\n\n1997 Tom Jones Fielding keeping count of characters passing by every which way (John Sessions) — Simon Burke & Metin Huseyin (see blog)\n\n2023 Tom Jones Tom (Solly McLeod) and his mother, Bridget Allworthy (Felicity Montagu) overcome as they recognize one another as mother and son — Gwyneth Hughes and Georgia Parris (blog just below)\n\nTom: Can a man ever be a gentleman if he doesn’t know who his father is?\n\nAunt Bridget: Kindness and good conduct make a true gentleman …\n\nDear friends and readers — and movie watchers,\n\nI’ve been having this deeply pleasurable time watching all three Tom Jones movies in a row, then separately, and then returning to the book, which I taught at both OLLIs in 2015, and then watching them all over again. Reading Osborne’s screenplay! all of which I’ve also written many blogs about (here at Ellen and Jim, there at Austen Reveries, and one paper at academia.edu.) Not to omit a 10 page paper long ago (1966, long lost sight of) as an undergraduate on the plot-design and introductory ironic chapters!\n\nNot to worry, this is not going to be another blow-by-blow account. Nowadays I don’t need to do that because of all the recaps on the Internet, and especially when it’s the tone and ideas/themes figured forth that matter rather than the literal happenings (though these count too). I’ve found 4 very thorough recaps for you. What these do not have and I’ve found little evidence for on popular sites is any knowledge of Henry Fielding’s book.\n\nThe points I want to make about the first two movies follow in block form; the third I expatiate a bit.\n\nIn 1963 the daring highly original independent artist, Tony Richardson, together with the playwright, John Osborne, one of those angry young men who wrote all male-centered plays, created a highly memorable striking 2 hours and 8 minutes of brilliant film making for the cinema.\n\nUnder the impression the book is this good-natured and benign comedy (however savage in action, amoral in norms, coolly detached when it comes to poetic justice), distanced by a narrator, they elected to imitate film types — so we get speeding up and antics as if this were silent film with comical silent film type music. They opted (perhaps unconsciously) to make sex a hilarious joke (this is a male film where rape is a kind of joke, as it is in Fielding’s book). Subversive mischief is the feel of the whole thing. No one even now who ever sees the film can forget the hunt (first time ever done on film), the intensely sensual eating at one another of Tom and Mrs Waters (aka Jenny Jones [Joyce Redman) thought to be his mother at that moment. Both the 1997 and 2023 serials include an imitation of both.\n\nThe terrified much put-upon Partridge (the unforgettable Jack MacGowan — the movie has a number of the Ealing comedy regulars in it) trying to hold up Tom on the road\n\nThe characters remain at a distance from us, like puppets occasionally coming alive for intensities of emotion, both joy and exhilarated varieties. The film is brought to an end suddenly by replacing the last quarter of the novel with an imitation of Gay’s Beggar’s Opera, where Tom as Macheath comes near hanging, and he and Sophia finally fall into one another arms.\n\nNow and again Osborne’s screenplay has appercus about the action, humane nature, life that are worth a serious read and do show an understanding of Fielding’s work.\n\nI recommend studying the published screenplay which comes with 200 stills in black-and-white picked and judiciously scattered by Robert Hughes so as to repeat something of the experience with some understanding of what this is about that you imagine you are having in the movie-theater.\n\n************************************************\n\nIn 1997 one of the finest of the BBC screenplay writers, Simon Burke, and the thoroughly professional director, Metin Huseyin, decided to make a paean to Fielding and his book, to truly faithfully put onto the screen a translation of as much of the book as they could, making Fielding a presence in the film as narrator, voice-over, traffic director, ironic commentator.\n\nI find it superior to either of the other two in conveying the complex and contradictory meanings of the book. The serial is 5 hours long and so the only one which can do justice to the tangled series of diabolical conspiracies (however burlesquely done) that come near to destroying Tom for real. The mood is comical melodrama for the characters as they come and go (however Polonius like this sounds). They’ve altered the frat boy forgiven perspective of the book: this is a pro-active Sophia (Samantha Morton), accompanied by an actively involved wry Honor (Kathy Burke inimitable. risking her job to do the right thing). Sophia is an overt feminist – she will not marry Tom until he proves himself faithful for two years (and we see in the fast forward of two small children, that he was made to so wait). The film-makers bring in the original allusions more: Mrs Waters (Camille Couduri) half-naked following Tom is a leering Eurydice and he a bewildered Orpheus as in the book.\n\nNote how different is the meeting of Tom (Max Beasley) and Partridge (Ron Cook) on the road — they hug frantically as long-lost father and son\n\nNow the characters are allowed to come up close to us as people: they considerably softened Mr Allworthy so that Benjamin Whitlow continually shows love, forgiveness, fondness for Tom, appreciation of him until Tom is betrayed by his own over-emotionalism (we are expected to feel in the film and also the book) upon Mr Allworthy’s recovery. Mrs Bridget (Tessa Peake-Jones) is very fond of Tom throughout; she tells him it’s necessary to do more than be virtuous; one must appear so. Here the women are not slathering all over Tom. I can’t speak too highly of Frances de la Tour as Aunt Western (crazed for status, money, luxury), Lindsay Duncan as Lady Bellaston, turned into a fiendish over-sexed termagant (a Madame de Merteuil), with Peter Capaldi as stalking rapist also roused by indignation, jealousy. The ending here resembles Les Liaisons Dangereuses as they attempt to press-gang, humiliate, frame, drive Tom into murder.\n\nThey take the film’s social criticism of the society at the time seriously, have a wider range of application (like the Jacobite war), even if at the end the Team Tom has formed and saves Tom out of gratitude. Tom quietly takes charge of himself by the end of the third episode and is saving Nancy, refusing promiscuous sex (realizing how degraded he’s become). It’s also hilariously funny as the outward antics show the good characters hysterically trying to escape the nooses the bad characters set up for them, with people jumping out of windows. There are two spontaneous duels: Brian Blessed magnificent as Western simply shoots Fellamar – why bother with swords?\n\nIt’s a very satisfying film. Watch it over and over.\n\nSophia and Tom at the piano, Squire Western singing along … a joyous moment\n\n*****************************************\n\nAnd so we come to our newest entry:\n\nGwyneth Hughes and Georgia Parris’s iteration is outstanding for having switched the perspective to that of a woman: our narrator is now Sophia (Sophia Wilde), brought over from Jamaica as the child of an enslaved black woman Squire Western impregnated (actually named! Beneba!) because the old man, Western (Alun Armstrong become a weakly affectionate lonely man) needs an heir and some hope in the form of a next generation. She speaks in the tone of deep memory; she organizes the events in the sequence she tells them so that she has equal time.\n\nBoth Tom and Sophia are then are outcasts brought tenuously into the families now. Gwyneth Hughes wrote Miss Austen Regrets and if you follow her career has a record of turning masculinized works into women-centered ones with a genuinely female POV dominating (see my blog on her Five Days). Hughes’s Aunt Western (Shirley Henderson) says she never married and honestly doesn’t see why women should; she also hilariously and also frankly worries over the state of Sophia’s hair when her black lady’s maid, Honor, is not there to make it look polished or styled. Pearl Mackie as Honor is made to do a reprise of Kathy Burke only now the two women (Sophie and Honor) become equals and friends.\n\nSneaking out to go on the road after Tom and to London to find the (false) safety of Lady Bellaston (played by the enormously tall and statuesque Hannah Waddington) and “Aunt” Harriet (Tamzin Merchant who in the book is Sophia’s cousin, Tamzin Merchant) who flees Mr Fitzpatrick far less frantically than in the book where his violence is rightly taken seriously.\n\nThe new important emphasis is an increase of moral gravitas for this Tom: Solly McLeod evidences a tender gravity towards Sophia and an overt selfless kindness throughout — that is indeed what makes him a gentleman. In this film he worries about this as no Tom has before him. Well before he has to be stopped jumping into women’s beds; he hates writing the lying letter to Lady Bellaston as “it’s ugly.” Told by Black George that George stole the 500£ Mr Allworthy (James Fleet, playing his usual self-deprecating way) meant for Tom, and that he used it to build a new house for his family, Tom says he is glad to have been of use. The actor may have been chosen because he’s taller than Waddington (so their liaison will not seem grotesque), but he is no macho male (not a body-built like Sam Heughan aka Jamie from Outlander), and worries about hurting other people’s feelings. He is not so much imprudent (the incident of the drunkenness after Mr Allworthy recovers from an illness is omitted) but rather not looking out for himself: unsuspicious is the note hit. Partridge (Daniel Rigby) here becomes a hanger-on as he does not in the other versions (Fielding’s included) because Tom does have a mind of his own — the comedy comes from this Partridge’s yearning to return home.\n\nClose up we see there is no harm in the Squire and his sister\n\nThe use of a female narrator and female POV just transforms it. Repeatedly events we saw from a particular’s POV or Fielding’s are now one of these women. Armstrong as Western keeps muttering about “the women in this family,” but in this film duels are seen as ridiculous things men do. When Tom is having sex with Mrs Waters at Upton, our POV is that of Sophia and Honor listening from the other side. When Fitzpatrick interrupts Tom and Mrs Waters, our POV is that of Mrs Waters ostentatiously (to us) pretending to be eager and waiting patiently for Fitzpatrick all this while. Again and again the mad-dog violent sexual predator is made to seem silly but also mortally dangerous and not to be trusted. The men are seen through immediately (that Mr Fitzpatrick has taken bribes); the women enigmatic. When Tom despairs in prison upon learning he may have fucked his mother, his words have a plangency rarely projected by men.\n\nSophie Wilde is of course central too; she is wise beyond her years — the black actress moves into this princess role so gracefully — in one sequence she sings a lovely 18th century sounding song. Perhaps she is too without bitter memories (Georgiana Lambe in the latest Sanditon is more realistic this way), too trusting. This film is not color blind; it means to be color conscious but they did not want to register too closely the horrors of enslavement this pastoral skirts.\n\nTom and Sophia dancing\n\nAll the characters want to return home, and home is not Jamaica, or a particular house, but a yearning to escape individual trouble and vexation. It is a funny at times, but in a genuinely more benevolent way than the previous. The jokes are not aggressive (Partridge echoes Pistol from Shakespeare: “Speak or die!”), no one mocks anyone but Bellaston, Fellamar (Tom Durrand Pritchard) and the gloating spiteful Blifil (James Wilbraham) whom poetic justice leaves with in the city (at a gothic like door) with the cold ambitious Lady Bellaston.\n\nThey are for the countryside, anti-artifice, and this links the film back to the 2007 Mansfield Park by Maggie Waddie — the ending of both is closely similar. A picnic wedding with a beautiful dance between our hero and heroine and then circle dancing of all as they look forward to peaceful future in this haven of Paradise Hall where once Blifil is ejected (presented as twisted by his envy and jealousy over everyone’s deep love for Tom, but especially his mother) all are safe, stable, contented. We are told Mrs Waters (Susannah Fielding) and Mrs Fitzgerald got on quite well together and never missed Mr F with his crazed sexual predation and violent turn for duels. Honor marries a black inn-keeper and becomes a pub-landlady nearby.\n\nI admit this is not a film where returning to Fielding’s book will do you much good if you want to deepen your understanding of what has given rise to the film. This anti-competitive theme is not taken from Fielding’s book but is a reaction to our world today. No one wants to hustle for gigs. The palette of the movie is pastoral repeatedly — mostly rich autumn colors. Frances Grey as Mrs Miller would not be out of place in the BBC Cranford.\n\nJames Fleet as Squire Allworthy sheltering under a tree in the landscape\n\nEllen\n\nThe author’s real name is Carolyn Heilbrun, the detective Kate Fansler\n\nJane Tennison (Helen Mirren) of Prime Suspect fame\n\nFriends and readers,\n\nAn interim blog: this is me thinking out a few semi-conclusions I’ve come to after a couple of months of reading books about women detectives (history, literary criticism, culture, feminist) and reading and rereading a few such books by men and women. As I’ve written on my Sylvia I blog, I seem to be going through something of a transition after living in this world without Jim for some 9 plus years. Part of this is I am liking books I used to not be able to read, and able to accept optimism and at least sympathize with (understand in a new way from an outward transactional POV) some conventional transactional pro-social-ambition perspectives.\n\nTo get to the point here, I find that I can’t resist reading and watching new kinds of material in the detective, mystery-thriller, spy genre kind, which I’ve come back to seeing as closely allied to the gothic. Not that I altogether rejected books with women detectives at the center: my first Internet pseudonym was Sylvia Drake, a minor character in Dorothy Sayer’s Gaudy night, and my gravatar for my political blog is a small picture of Harriet Walter as Harriet Vane looking thoughtful.\n\nFrom Strong Poison: she is supposed the murderer and this is in prison, she is talking to Lord Peter Wimsey (Edward Petherbridge)\n\nThe reading came out of my preparing for my coming The Heroine’s Journey course this winter. As you can see, if you go over the look, there is no example among my four slender book choices of a female detective novel. That’s because I couldn’t think of one slender enough for such a short course until I came upon Amanda Cross’s (aka Carolyn Heilbrun’s) Death in a Tenured Position. Most recent and older female detective novels are average size, say 350 pages (Gaudy Night is about this size) because often many combine a “novel of manners” (or domestic romance) with the detective formula. But I found it to be a central category because since surfacing in novels in the 1860s, the type has multiplied in appearances until say today there may be several TV shows featuring a female detective available all at once.\n\nAlthough I’ve found dictionary-type books with lists and essays on women writers and their detective novels (Great Women Mystery Writers, ed Kathleen Gregory Klein, truly excellent; By a Woman’s Hand by Jean Swanson and Dean James, 200 short entries which have the merit of naming the author as well as the detective and offering enough information to give the reader a gist of what type of mystery fiction this is), it has been very hard to find any essay-like books treating just the category of female detective fiction by women writers. The nature of the material (influences, who’s writing what, movies as a group-creation) has led to many male writers putting female detectives at the center of their series, and many female writers putting male detectives, and these mixed gender creations (so to speak) are often superb in all sorts of ways.\n\nOne of my felicitous reading and watching experiences this past year was Anthony Horowitz’s Magpie Murders (both book and film), which features a private detective, Atticus Pund (spelt without accents) in a 1950s novel as part of an investigation into a parallel murder today by the old trope amateur sleuth, Sue Ryland in (presumably) 2021 — for its witticism, self-reflexive uses of the core fantasies, styles and yes multi-gender empathies.\n\nSue Rylands (Leslie Manville) is also intended to appeal to older unmarried career women (the spinster trope transformed & modernized at last)\n\nBut as there is a real, findable, and demonstable fault-line and difference between male and female writing, and films made by mostly men or mostly women, and visual art, and music too, and one of my aims as a teacher and writer is to keep women’s literature alive and make it more respected; I’ve been after just the books by women albeit in a multi-gender context. I’ve also tried to stick to films where the central author originally (or continuously) is a woman, and evidence shows women directing, producing, doing set design. The qualification here is all of these are shaped by the kind of detection mystery genre the book/film is written in. I’ve followed Andrew Marr centrally here; Julian Symons’s Bloody Murders is also indispensable.\n\nI’ve come to a few tentative conclusions.\n\nI agree in part with Kathleen Klein’s brilliant analysis (The Woman Detective: Gender and Genre) of the depiction of female detectives mostly in books, but equally by men and women that often these may easily be read and are in fact intended (when conscious) as anti-feminist (meaning the movement for independence and equality) portrayals from a male (in some eras on TV lascivious) POV.\n\nThis POV is on display in right now in the incessant arguments and brutal put-downs of Miss Eliza Scarlet (the ever patient Kate Phillips has played many an wholly abject woman, from Jane Seymour in the recent Wolf Hall, to Tolstoy’s hero Andrei’s long-suffering wife, the 2016 serial by Andrew Davies) by “The Duke” Inspector Wellington (the pugnacious, overtly insulting professional police detective played by Stuart Martin, doubtless chosen for his resemblance to the matinee idol type, Richard Armitage) who reiterates constantly a woman cannot be both a real or natural or happy woman and a detective; who needs strong men around her to protect her. Injury was added to insult in the most recent episode (Season 3, Episode 2) where a story was concocted whereby a mean and bullying ex-friend, Amanda Acaster, who repeatedly humiliated and nowadays derides her, is also used to criticize adversely Eliza’s character: Eliza is supposed now to have felt for Amanda trying to have a career using the same manipulative amoral tactics she did when the two were young. She is not charged though her measures were what encouraged a gang of thieves to use her restaurant as a front. But look she surpasses Eliza in the Victoria sponge cake line. The costuming of the program shows some knowledge of the illustrations for such stories in the 1870s/90s, the music is very good, and lines are witty (though usually at Eliza’s expense) and I’d call the presentation stylish. I have spent this much time on it as it’s contemporary and its perniciousness extends to endorsing bullying and mocking non-macho males (Andrew Gower as a homosexual man controlled by his mother).\n\nIn many of these detective stories especially the hard-boiled type, and since the 1990s, the woman simply takes on male characteristics, and when she doesn’t and displays genuine female psychology, set of values, life experiences, and is as competent as the males and not just by intuition, by the end of a given book or series, we are to see she has not lived a fulfilled life, which must include marriage and motherhood. This is how Prime Suspect finally ends. In medias res, the female detective of whatever type is often allowed genuine common women’s lives characteristics and we see themes and archetypes familiar in women’s literature, e.g., recent film instance of the mother-daughter rivalry paradigm in Annika where the older heroine is divorced and lives with her teenage older daughter. There is now a line of disguised lesbian socially-conscious fiction, e.g., Val McDermid, seen in film recently featuring Karen Pirie played by Lauren Lyle, of Outlander provenance, dressed in unemphatically non-binary ways\n\nBut I don’t agree wholly with Klein (or others who write from her vantage). At the same time, the way out is not to trivialize and pretend to treat as playful amusement “the lady investigator” and her now many daughters, grand-daughters and great-grand-daughters, all the while lightly coming to the same conclusion as Klein, with some face-saving and genuinely rescuing qualifications. This is the vein taken by Patricia Craig and Mary Cadogan in their The Lady Investigates: Women Detectives and Spies in Fiction: a very informative as well as insightful book; it covers amateur and private detectives as well as the spy genre, which Klein does not. Nor is it to ignore this aspect of the genre altogether: Lucy Worsley in her Art of Murder manages this, at the same time as she (curiously) denies that the mass audience for this kind of thing understands it as fantasy (that most murders are not solved, and when solved not by brilliant ratiocinative nor super-scientific techniques, but rather information from people involved) but out of a thirst for violence and fascination with death (this does ally it to the gothic).\n\nWhat we need to remember is the history of the genre: it first emerges in the later 19th century when women could get jobs and income on their own, go to college as woman (usually women’s colleges). The whole larger genre of detective fiction develops its characteristics when you first have men hired in visible numbers and a real police force. So there were male models for male detectives but no female models for female detectives. This changes (Miss Scarlet and the Duke is quite a startling throw-back) post-World War II when women held on to their array of male jobs and began to be hired, however slowly, and to be promoted to managerial positions in institutions, including the police (Lynda LaPlante modelled Jane Tennison on an actual woman detective).\n\nI suggest that the woman detective was an popular substitute for the “new woman” so distinguished by feminist literary scholars of the 1890s (which never achieved much popularity or was not lasting); she becomes liberated and a real woman as women in our western societies begin at any rate to achieve the right and education for financial and some real sexual independence. We see this in Horowitz’s Sue Rylands and I hope to show other women detectives from the post World War II era.\n\nSo as a follow-on from this framework, I hope from time to time to write blogs here when the writer is a male and the portrait less than really feminocentric; on detective fiction found in both books and films; and on Reveries under the Sign of Austen (when the writer is female and the work genuinely l’ecriture-femme, which includes for me a genuinely anti-violence, anti-war and pro-woman political POV, which by the way I do think Prime Suspect was and is: Gray Cavender and Nancy C Jurik’s Justice Provocateur: Jane Tennison and Policing in Prime Suspect. The victims in these shows are often women tortured by male violence, young children, including boys destroyed and warped by male pedasty, immigrants, mostly women working menial jobs desperately, and yes prostitutes too, and women who murder (including one semi-accidental infanticide) too.\n\nFirst up for Austen Reveries will be Amanda Cross’s Death in a Tenured Position and, for this blog, the older masterpiece, Josephine Tey’s The Daughter of Time (Inspector Alan Grant investigates the character of Richard III)\n\nOf course Josephine Tey was a pseudonym; the author’s real name was Elizabeth Mackintosh, and the photo is of Jennifer Morag Henderson who wrote an excellent biography\n\nEllen\n\nFrom Number 13 (Greg Wise as Professor Ander hard at work and Tom Burke as Tom Jenkins, a cheerful sinister presence)\n\nGentle readers and patient friends,\n\nA few years ago, pre-pandemic, I wrote a series of blogs asking what is a Christmasy Story, and basically came up with a moral model, often, tellingly, involved with the death of someone (or near destruction), most of the time with a redemption, or renewal of hope in the future at story’s end. As I did this year over Trollope’s two American Civil War Christmas stories, I brought up how central to these winter tale traditions was the ghost story, mentioning in passing how Dickens’s A Christmas Carol differed so in its happy ending, poetic justice. Most ghost stories are Kafkaesque, nightmarish, uncanny, unnerving.\n\nWhat I’ve been leaving out is then a mystery of why these have been so much a part of Christmas, becoming explicitly so in the Victorian era. M. R. James in particular is utterly out of whack with most professed goals of festivity, joy, forgiveness and whatnot. This year seeking once again to watch and talk about Christmas stories on my now ancient Trollope & his Contemporaries listserv (@ groups.io), I proposed reading his Stalls of Barchester Cathedral and watching (it’s on YouTube), the 1971 film adaptation. I did both, but then dissatisfied with the weak film, too familiar with the story, I cast about to see what other films, if any, were available as ghost stories, and lo and behold discovered that in 2005 and again in 2017 the BBC attempted to revive the old traditions of the 1980s and make 30-40 minute films of short ghost stories, but this time in all cases, from M. J. James. The first one I watched was A View from the Hill (which held and made me very nervous), and then found short reviews of these, rightly recommending them.\n\nWandering in a tomb: “Imagine, if you will … ”\n\nI found (as in the earlier ones), superb but not super-famous actors involved, intelligent subtle scripts, e.g., Number 13 (which begins in bright cheerful light). They do not seem to me as masterly as those done way back in the ’60s (Whistle and I’ll come to You, and the brought back Andrew Davies’s Signalman), but they are in color (not a small thing still), so beautifully photographed, or like illustrations, and as a group, compel me to wonder not why people want the thrill of magic, but why, as C.S. Lewis insisted, pain remorseless terror tropes of inexplicability as part of the season’s diet of renewal, remembering, human communal activities.\n\nI’ve no good answer to that, for it’s not enough to say it’s a metaphoric experience which makes us take into account our own powerlessness against the forces of the natural and social worlds. These stories are much more effective when the ghost is genuine, not a psychological projection. I did several years ago write about Oliphant’s ghost stories and the relationship of the gothic ghost story to Christmas. What is terrifying about Whistle and I’ll Come to You is you feel you have yourself brought the ghost out without quite meaning to, and you are not sure you won’t be tempted to do or somehow do that again. This resembles how Hyde begins to be able to come out of Jekyll and take over at will. The horror is also in this demon’s mocking breaking pf fundamental taboos against dwelling on death’s remains (e.g., playing with a corpse). Sometimes there was a crime perpetrated by the now victim (as in The Stalls) and sometimes (in Number 13), our researcher is digging up from the past real cruelties perpetrated by real people connected to present people’s interests and is warned away.\n\nI now invite you to watch A View from the Hill (the notable actors are Pip Torrens, David Burke, Mark Letheren)\n\nI provide four others in the comments.\n\nSo there is a typical structure and mood to all M. R. James whether in verbal story form or film. He builds mood slowly; a character goes to a remote place meaning to do research into the past. When he does, he evokes either a lingering malignant presence whom others living there are half-aware of and too unnerved to speak. Small things are felt; say a claw put out, a cat’s meow; this then grows nervily, louder, and from just an intrusion becomes overwhelming in its brutality. The demonic presence attacks him swiftly. The ghost or revenant is not always a male in other authors, for example in Susan Hill’s The Woman in Black, where the ghost is a woman in black with unforgettable ferociously hating eyes, a mother whose child was taken from her and let die.\n\nWhen this eruption from some other realm is effective, the attack is fatal; the person vanishes forever; but it can also be the ending is inconclusive, and you are left waiting with that victim-person who is trying to flee, like say in A View from the Hill, where our previous researcher is waiting for a train that is not coming. What’s chilling is the obtuse person (Pip Torrens) he is visiting appears not to know about this murderous presence and yet is ever leading our victim-character into danger — and then walking off. A blow by blow account — if you need it.\n\nBut this is what he sees:\n\nFrom far\n\nThen he is suddenly inside\n\nIn A View from the Hill it’s this pair of binoculars that allows the central victim-hero to see and be inside a cathedral that is no longer there literally. He is then (apparently) hanged for doing this.\n\nThe closest contemporary novels that come near this are by Kazuo Ishiguro: his Never Let Me Go has the same realistic surface as a ghost story, while the science fiction that is going on is cruel, and its apparent rational mirrors the senselessness of some modern medical technology uses — and connects us back to Shelley’s Frankenstein. But no one thinks of these as Christmas stories.\n\nM. R. James\n\nAnd now this delightful documentary by Mark Gatiss, about M.R. James as a man, his career, how these ghost stories emerged, and a brilliant analysis of them. It is 55 minutes, worth every second of it — many clips from BBC years. (I apologize if the link only takes you to a blockED video. You can type in M R James + Mark Gatis into the YouTube search engine and that may take you to this documentary. Poke around.) Gatiss suggests an important literary source of James’s visual imagination are the pictures in the medieval illuminated manuscripts James catalogued. And that James was repressed probably non-practicing homosexual. One amusing moment: Jonathan Miller (who did a brilliant adaptation) quietly insisting on how we are to see what happens in that story as nightmares (no ghost there literally), as if reassuring himself …\n\nAny thoughts, anyone? at any rate, back again (we hope) next Winter Solstice.\n\nEllen"
