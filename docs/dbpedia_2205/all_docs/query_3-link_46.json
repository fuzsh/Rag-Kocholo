        "text": "This week’s most notable release is the long-awaited DVD arrival of Elliot Nugent’s “The Cat and the Canary” as part of Universal’s “Bob Hope: Thanks for the Memory Collection.” This horror comedy from 1939 is by far the better of two Bob Hope films that have long been out of circulation.\n\n“The Iron Petticoat” (1956), a British production co-starring Katherine Hepburn, available only as a British import, is a disappointment. But “The Cat and the Canary,” the third of at least six film versions of John Willard’s 1922 stage play, is one of Hope’s best, a great chance to see the young, handsome comic in the role (a fraidy-cat radio star) that made him a star. This spooky haunted-house story, with great cinematography, sets and supporting cast (Gale Sondergaard, George Zucco et al.) is one of three films in the set that pair Hope with sexy Paulette Goddard (pictured here with John Beal and Douglass Montgomery).\n\nIt’s interesting to compare “The Cat and the Canary” with another of these, its near-remake (and long available) “The Ghost Breakers” (1940), based on another stage warhorse that moves the action from the Louisiana Bayous to the Caribbean under the direction of George Marshall, who remade the property again as the Dean Martin-Jerry Lewis comedy “Scared Stiff.” The third Hope-Goddard teaming, new to DVD, is the very funny “Nothing But the Truth” (1941), also directed by Nugent, with Hope as a stockbroker who wagers he can tell the absolute truth for 24 hours. Based on another much-filmed play, this was remade with Jim Carrey as “Liar, Liar.”\n\nThe other debut in the set is the underrated George Auchainbaud’s “Thanks for the Memory” (1938), a stylish little B-movie based on an Albert Hackett-Frances Goodrich play that reunites Hope with Shirley Ross, with whom he crooned the title song in his feature debut, “The Big Broadcast of 1938.” Here they sing Hoagy Carmichael and Frank Loesser’s classic “Two Sleepy People” and bicker as newlyweds.\n\nRounding out the set are a pair of previously available classics, not based on plays, that Hope made after his screen persona was well established. Like the others, they’re drawn from Universal’s extensive pre-1948 Paramount holdings: David Butler’s hilarious “The Road to Morocco” (1942) with Bing Crosby, Dorothy Lamour and Anthony Quinn; and Marshall’s Technicolored western spoof “The Paleface” (1948) co-starring Jane Russell, Robert Armstrong and the Sicilian-American impersonator of Native Americans who called himself Iron Eyes Cody.\n\nI’d wager that the six immaculately restored Monogram B-pictures films in Warners’ “TCM Spotlight: The Charlie Chan Collection” haven’t looked this good since their original theatrical runs in the late 1940s. Maybe better. But if there was ever a DVD set aimed at hard-core fans, this is it.\n\nIn terms of writing, directing, casting and production values, these films suffer by comparison to the Chan adventures made at 20th Century Fox with Warner Oland and, after his death, Sidney Toler (all but four titles no longer believed to exist are available from Fox). By the time the series moved to Monogram — the first six were issued by MGM Home Video in 2000 — the aging Toler was pretty much the whole show.\n\nThe TCM set covers Toler’s last three films as Chan, as well as the first with Roland Winters, who controversially took over after Toler’s death in 1947. The best is the earliest: “Dark Alibi” (1946), directed by up-and-coming B-movie specialist Phil Karlson, which like most of Toler’s Monogram Chans feature Benson Fong as his No. 3 son and Mantan Moreland as comic-relief chauffeur Birmingham Brown.\n\nThe saddest is “The Trap” (1947), with a visibly ill Toler, who was dying of cancer. Victor Sen Yung, who had played No. 2 son Jimmy in Toler’s Fox entries, returned for Toler’s swan song.\n\nSen Yung stuck around for the debut of Winters (in terrible Asian drag) in “The Chinese Ring” (1947) — a remake of “Mr. Wong in Chinatown,” Monogram’s earlier series starring Boris Karloff as an imitation Charlie Chan.\n\nThere are five more Chan films with Winters — a couple with the original No. 1 son, Keye Luke — that will no doubt show up eventually on DVD.\n\nCOMING ATTRACTIONS: The Warner Archive Collection, the manufacture-on-demand program that’s drawn flak from some purists for using old transfers to make hundreds of rare titles available over the last 16 months, yesterday announced a new line of remastered titles.\n\nAlready available for pre-order at the WB Shop under this banner are three previously delayed titles, now scheduled for release on June 22: Mervyn LeRoy’s “Five Star Final” with Edward G. Robinson, Sam Fuller’s “Verboten!” and William Conrad’s “Two on a Guillotine” starring the immortal Cesar Romero as a mad magician. The list price for the restored titles is $24.95, though for pre-orders they are being offered at the regular WAC price of $19.95 for single-disc titles. More details are here.\n\nSome very nice folks from Paramount Home Video stopped by The Post the other day. They weren’t able to shed any light on when the studio will resume putting out vintage titles on DVD, though they are still promising the suspended “Centennial Collection” will resume before Paramount’s 100th birthday in 2012.\n\nParamount does continue licensing deep catalogue titles to other distributors. Most notably, The Criterion Collection will release three Josef Von Stenberg silent goodies — “The Last Command” with Emil Jannings and William Powell; “Underworld” starring George Bancroft and Clive Brook and “Docks of New York” with Bancroft — on Aug. 24.\n\nOn the Blu-ray front, Warner will debut Fred McLeod Wilcox’s “Forbidden Planet” (1956) with Leslie Nielsen, Anne Francis and Walter Pidgeon on Sept. 7 and Lewis Milestone’s “Ocean’s Eleven” (1960) starring Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. on Oct. 10."
