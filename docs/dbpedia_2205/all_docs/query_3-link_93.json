To the monster the child was like a flower, therefore she was a flower, and since a flower can float, so should the child. But she can’t, she dies. To the students, some thirty years younger than I, the monster is merely dumb, the girl a splash, like a punchline, a machine to produce laughs. The prof packs his notes, useless, dismisses the kids, a few linger with questions I can’t rid them of, ever—children drawn to the abyss. A bus passes; I wave it on.

But without people like Rebecca M. Pauly of West Chester University, an astute counselor to both LFA and LFQ, or Victoria Stiles, first treasurer of LFA (now retired from SUNY Courtland), and so many others, neither the journal nor the association could have endured. We thank all of our LFA and LFQ colleagues for creating and sustaining a remarkable scholarly community. In the beginning, Tom Erskine, academic dean at Salisbury State College, could not have funded LFQ in 1972–1973 without the splendid administrative support of Dr. Norman C. Crawford, then president of Salisbury State. Thereafter, LFQ could not have survived over three decades without the continued support of later presidents Thomas A. Bellavance, K. Nelson Butler, William C. Merwin, and Janet Dudley-Eshbach, who currently heads the institution. We owe a debt of gratitude as well to the current editors of LFQ, Elsie M. Walker and David T. Johnson, and their capable business manager, Brenda Grodzicki. Many English Department colleagues at Salisbury were also supportive in many ways, especially the late Francis Fleming (former chair), Bill\n\nix\n\n07_274_1Front.qxd\n\nx\n\n7/24/07\n\n6:08 PM\n\nPage x\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nZak (associate chair), Connie Richards (former chair and current associate dean), Elizabeth Curtain (current chair), and Timothy O’Rourke (current dean of the Fulton School at Salisbury). Donald M. Whaley, director of American studies at Salisbury, has been supportive in attending, organizing, and running LFA conferences. In the former Public Relations and Publications Departments of Salisbury State University, Gains Hawkins and Richard Culver helped to build public awareness of LFQ within the state of Maryland, while Carol Bloodsworth, director of publications, helped to keep publication on schedule. For two decades, Anne Welsh, who worked with Carol Bloodsworth in publications, was simply essential to the journal’s continuation. At Towson University, we thank Greg Faller and William Horne for their many contributions to LFA conferences, including creative and scholarly work but also moving furniture, as needed. Barry Moore, Jennifer Lackey, Ronald J. Matlon, Kit Spicer, Maravene Loeschke and Towson’s Design Center have been very helpful and supportive as well. We also thank Yvonne Lev for so graciously lending a hand at recent LFA conferences.\n\nCredits Tom Whalen’s poem “Frankenstein” originally appeared in LFQ 28 (3).

Welsh\n\n‘“What is truth?’ said jesting Pilate, and would not stay for an answer.” —Sir Francis Bacon, “Of Truth”\n\nOverview After a century of cinema, movies have changed substantially, both technologically and stylistically, but after a hundred years, mainstream cinema is still telling and retelling stories, and most of those stories are still being (or have been) appropriated from literary or dramatic sources, as much as 85 percent by some calculations and accounts. Adaptation has always been central to the process of filmmaking since almost the beginning and could well maintain its dominance into the cinema’s second century. This collection investigates the present and future of screen adaptation and of adaptation study, through essays written by the editors of Literature/Film Quarterly (LFQ) further enhanced by the work of some of that journal’s most thoughtful contributors. The goal is to teach, by example or theory, and to explore some potential new avenues of discussion as well. This collection of essays has been assembled by Jim Welsh, the cofounding editor of LFQ, and by Peter Lev, long a member of the LFQ editorial xiii\n\n07_274_1Front.qxd\n\nxiv\n\n7/24/07\n\n6:08 PM\n\nPage xiv\n\nJames M. Welsh\n\nboard. Both have also served as president of the Literature/Film Association (LFA) and are recognized senior scholars in the field of cinema studies and screen adaptation. Welsh is coeditor of The Encyclopedia of Novels into Film (now in its second revised edition) and of sixteen other books; Peter Lev’s latest book, The Fifties: Transforming the Screen, 1950–1959, published in 2003, appeared as volume 7 in the prestigious Scribners History of American Cinema series. Contributors to the present volume include teacher-scholars from England, Romania, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States; though the United States is best represented (at least quantitatively), one-third of the contributing authors are non-American.\n\nThe (Alleged) Persistence of “Fidelity” One problem with cinema criticism and theory is that it has all too often involved a hermetic and limited society of scholars writing in codes for their mutual but limited enlightenment. LFQ has always reached out for a larger and more general audience. The fact that the journal has survived for more than thirty-five years is perhaps an indication that this goal has been achieved. The most basic and banal focus in evaluating adaptations is the issue of “fidelity,” usually leading to the notion that “the book was better.” This limited and “literal” approach is represented by bibliophiles and is the guiding principle of Robin H. Smiley’s Books into Film: The Stuff That Dreams Are Made Of [sic] (2003), a book that was totally ignored by the cinema studies establishment. At the opposite extreme is Brian McFarlane, author of Novel to Film: An Introduction to the Theory of Adaptation (1996). Brian’s plenary address, quizzically entitled “It Wasn’t Like That in the Book . . .” and given at the University of Bath Millennium Film Conference in 1999, insists on film’s creative possibilities and opens the present collection. Certainly, fidelity hovers in the background of many of the essays included here, but the anthology also presents film as having a separate identity and separate aesthetic principles, as suggested by Professor McFarlane and others. In other chapters (see e.g., Thomas M. Leitch and Walter C. Metz), intertextuality is presented as a possible alternative to fidelity criticism. One “new” focus here is the attention paid to the problem of adapting historical conflicts (such as the battle of the Alamo and the war with Mexico for Texican independence: see Frank Thompson’s chapter) and the problems of adapting the lives of famous people in the genre of the biopic (see Joan Driscoll Lynch on the sculptress Camille Claudel and John C. Tibbetts on the biopic of the American composer W. C. Handy).\n\n07_274_1Front.qxd\n\n7/24/07\n\n6:08 PM\n\nPage xv\n\nIntroduction\n\nxv\n\nThe Myth of the “Unfilmable” Let’s begin with the notion that everything is adaptable, that whatever exists in one medium might be adapted or translated into another, given the right imaginative initiative. Some may protest, of course, that the medium of film has its limitations, that it is epidermal, even superficial, that it cannot probe the depths of psychology or emotional consciousness. Countering these charges are the achievements of Ingmar Bergman in Sweden, of Michelangelo Antonioni in Italy, and of Yasujiro Ozu or Akira Kurosawa in Japan. Quite apart from human psychology, however, there are narrative and novelistic techniques that could be considered “unfilmable.” Shades of nuance in “voice” and tone, for example, could prove problematic. The experimental prose and drama of such writers as Samuel Beckett and James Joyce would seem to pose insurmountable problems, and yet the inner monologues of Ulysses were filmed by director/producer Joseph Strick in 1967, and the same filmmaker adapted the interminable musings of Stephen Daedalus (as represented by Irish actor Bosco Hogan) in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, released in 1977. Beckett himself wrote an exercise on the nature of perception in a film entitled, appropriately enough, Film (1965) and starring, appropriately enough, Buster Keaton. So much for conventional wisdom.\n\n“A Cock and Bull” Digression Take the example of Laurence Sterne’s comic novel, The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman (1759–1767), adapted to the screen as Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story by writer Frank Cottrell-Boyce and director Michael Winterbottom in 2005. The book is a famously whimsical romp that turns narrative conventions upside down and delights in playing with unconventional structure. Charles McGrath describes the plot of this “unfilmable” novel as a series of “endless digressions, false starts and wheelswithin-wheels. The protagonist, who is also the narrator, isn’t even born until Volume III, and by the end of the book he still hasn’t progressed beyond childhood, much less become an opinionated gentleman” (2006, 13). So how did Michael Winterbottom solve this problem? According to Variety, he did it by “cheating flagrantly” (Felperin, 2005, 63). He transformed the whimsical spirit of the novel by imagining his film as a movie being made of a movie of a book about a book. Winterbottom recognized that this “insanely digressive” novel was about 200 years ahead of its time. As one of the actors remarks, Tristram Shandy was a “postmodern classic which was written before\n\n07_274_1Front.qxd\n\nxvi\n\n7/24/07\n\n6:08 PM\n\nPage xvi\n\nJames M. Welsh\n\nthere was any modernism to be ‘post’ about” (McGrath, 2006, 13). So was Sterne’s novel “unfilmable”? Yes, certainly, in a way and to a degree. Could it be transformed in an agreeable way so as to make it seem “filmable”? Absolutely. Much of the adaptation is improvised by the actors Steve Coogan, who plays Tristram Shandy and Walter Shandy and an actor named Steve Coogan, and Rob Brydon, who plays Uncle Toby and an actor named Rob Brydon. Asked at a press conference whether either of them had ever read the book, Coogan said “I’ve read of it,” and Brydon said “Not in the traditional sense. You know, where you go from beginning to end” (McGrath, 2006, 28). So here is an “adaptation” partly created by actors impressionistically riffing on material they have not read or encountered directly. Go figure, and ponder the future of adaptation and what the process might mean nowadays. “In general, I’m not a fan of literary adaptations,” Michael Winterbottom told Sight and Sound (Spencer, 2006, 14). “Usually if you’re making the film of the book it’s because you like the book, but that gives you all sorts of problems in trying to produce a version of it. So there’s always something a bit restrictive, a bit secondhand about them. What was great here [in the case of Tristram Shandy] is that the book is about not telling the story you’re supposed to be telling, so it’s the perfect excuse for doing whatever you want.” Given the appetite that Hollywood and other film industries have shown and continue to show for novels, plays, biographies, histories, and other published stories, it is perhaps not surprising that the untouchable and “unfilmable” classics have been regularly touched and filmed, sometimes with good results. Consider, for example, the sprawling novels of Henry Fielding (director Tony Richardson captured the spirit of Tom Jones in 1963, followed by Joseph Andrews in 1977), William Makepeace Thackeray (Vanity Fair and even Barry Lyndon have been essayed), and Thomas Hardy (John Schlesinger’s Far from the Madding Crowd in 1967, Roman Polanski’s Tess in 1979, and Michael Winterbottom’s Jude in 1996 are interesting celluloid versions). Most of the novels of Jane Austen have been filmed and refilmed, with varying degrees of success. Indeed, the Austen adaptations have become a reliably commercial enterprise, with the recent version of Pride and Prejudice starring Keira Knightley holding its own with the Christmas blockbusters of 2005. We might add that Austen is a special case, appealing, on the one hand, to an academic audience for her splendid wit and irony and, on the other, to a far wider readership drawn to Austen for reasons having to do with romance, courtship, and “heritage” nostalgia.\n\n07_274_1Front.qxd\n\n7/24/07\n\n6:08 PM\n\nPage xvii\n\nIntroduction\n\nxvii\n\n“Unmanageable” Novels: Dickens and Oliver, with a Twist Of course, in the case of massive novels, length will almost certainly be a problem. One solution here is the “Masterpiece Theatre” television miniseries approach, applied, reasonably enough, in 2005 to the Dickens classic, Bleak House, originally written in twenty installments that appeared serially between 1852 and 1853 and adapted by screenwriter Andrew Davies to eight massive hours of programming. The screenwriter’s credentials included the successful and popular epic 1995 miniseries treatment of Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice. Arguably, television might be the best medium for assuring the “persistence of fidelity” in adapting “classic” novels. Every facial tic and verbal nuance could be captured, lovingly, in an eight-hour adaptation, every gasp, every sigh, every wink of the eye. But what about a feature film that has to be captured in less than three hours? Roman Polanski’s Oliver Twist, filmed in 2004 and released in 2005, may serve as a convenient demonstration here. This adaptation was not a popular success, despite Polanski’s credentials and obvious talent. Even though Oliver Twist followed upon the tremendous success of The Pianist in 2002, and even though Polanski was working with much the same crew, including the playwright Ronald Harwood as screenwriter. Published in 1837 and 1838, Oliver Twist was the first success of young Charles Dickens, and is second only to Great Expectations in terms of popularity. Oliver Twist (played by Barney Clark) is the name given to an orphan of unknown parentage, born and raised in a miserable workhouse, where he is mistreated by the parish beadle, Mr. Bumble (Jeremy Swift plays Polanski’s Bumble-beadle). Oliver’s story has been considerably simplified for Polanski’s film, which begins with Oliver at age nine. Oliver runs away to London, where he falls in with bad company—a juvenile gang of thieves trained by Fagin (Sir Ben Kingsley), a caricatured Jewish villain—to work as a pickpocket with his more experienced colleagues, the “Artful Dodger” (Harry Eden), and Charley Bates (Lewis Chase). More dangerous than Fagin (who is somewhat humanized by Polanski’s treatment though still a Dickensian caricature), however, is the ruthless burglar Bill Sikes (Jamie Foreman), a psychopath who brutalizes both his companion, Nancy (Leanne Rowe), and Oliver. The spirit of the novel is retained and the adaptation is well directed, well acted, and entirely agreeable. According to Harwood, the “phenomenal variety of characters” found in the world of this Dickens novel had to be condensed, as well as the far-fetched complications of the subplots, particularly Oliver’s relationship to the benevolent Mr. Brownlow, who rescues the boy from a life of crime.\n\n07_274_1Front.qxd\n\nxviii\n\n7/24/07\n\n6:08 PM\n\nPage xviii\n\nJames M. Welsh\n\nHarwood described this simplified version as follows: “It’s about a boy, a little boy, who takes charge of his own life, escapes from terrible trials and dangers, and emerges triumphant.” Dickens purists should not have been offended, given the atmospheric beauty of the visualization and the integrity of the reimagined characterizations. The multilayered Dickens narrative is simplified to a story of survival in a grim and uncaring world. It’s hardly surprising that, after having adapted Thomas Hardy’s Tess of the D’Urbervilles in 1979 (and winning three Oscars), Polanski would eventually turn his talents toward adapting Charles Dickens’s first novel to cinema, even if that meant following in the wake of one of England’s greatest directors, David Lean, who adapted Oliver Twist in 1948 with a cast that included Alex Guinness as Fagin, Robert Newton as Bill Sikes, and John Howard Davies as Oliver. Indeed, the 1948 David Lean adaptation probably still constitutes the gold standard for film adaptations of this Dickens classic. In the Lean treatment, Fagin’s juvenile gang and Bill Sikes’s unrelenting psychopath are presented as diametrically opposed to Mr. Brownlow’s benevolence, as if representing two autonomous worlds. Lean used expressionist camera angles and lighting techniques to contrast the darkness of the underworld with the cozy whiteness of the Brownlow sequences. Polanski takes a similar approach. Mr. Brownlow’s home is ordinarily bathed in sunshine and seems to be located on the bucolic edge of town, whereas the mise-en-scène is often drab and gloomy, with brown tones dominant, in the slums frequented by Fagin and his crew.\n\nAdapting a Stereotypical Ethnic Villain One particular challenge in this example, beyond the obvious narrative sprawl that needs to be contained, is how to adapt the character of the Jewish villain in a way that may not be utterly offensive. The David Lean adaptation was so controversial for its characterization of Fagin that, according to Variety, “its U.S. release was delayed for three years” (McCarthy, 2005, 62). Sir Ben Kingsley took the challenge for the Polanski adaptation and was certainly capable of doing justice to the role. Without question, Kingsley’s Fagin would be familiar to anyone who had read the Dickens description: “a very shriveled old Jew, whose villainous-looking and repulsive face was obscured by a quantity of matted red hair” (quoted by Brownlow, 1996, 230). Even so, Polanski’s approach to Fagin was intended to be the opposite of the Lean/Guinness treatment, according to Todd McCarthy’s evaluation for Variety: “Kingsley and Polanski appear most interested in attempting to\n\n07_274_1Front.qxd\n\n7/24/07\n\n6:08 PM\n\nPage xix\n\nIntroduction\n\nxix\n\nhumanize him, to argue that, even though he takes advantage of his boys and makes them break the law, this might be preferable to their fates if they were left to their own devices on the streets” (2005, 62). As a consequence, Kingsley’s Fagin exudes “a certain feebleness and insecurity that makes him more pathetic than hateful” (McCarthy, 2005, 62). Moreover, the film ends with Oliver visiting Fagin on an errand of mercy and forgiveness before that “wretched” man’s execution. Though it is certainly a challenge to rethink such a stereotyped character, this film presents Fagin as a “lovable” villain, a sorcerer whose wards are also apprentices; indeed, Kingsley saw this character as a magician. Polanski himself, born in 1933 and about Oliver’s age at the time of the Nazi invasions, could personally contextualize the Dickens story of survival. Polanski’s previous film The Pianist was also a story of survival, though involving a much older protagonist. Polanski’s Oliver Twist was praised by New York Times reviewer A. O. Scott as a “wonderful new adaptation” of Dickens (2005, B6). In his New Yorker review, however, Anthony Lane was offended by the anti-Semitic nastiness attached to the Dickens descriptions of Fagin, a “hideous old man [who] seemed like some loathsome reptile, engendered in the slime and darkness through which he moved: crawling forth, by night, in search of some rich offal for a meal” (2005, 107). For a director who had lost his mother to Auschwitz to even think of approaching such material, Lane implied, could be tantamount to a betrayal; but can such criticism be fairly applied to the director who made The Pianist? Polanski was pulled between the nastiness of Dickens’s Fagin and a desire to soften the character and thus move closer to contemporary sensibilities; his “solution” (if it is that) provides one example of how adaptors respond to contradictory pressures.\n\nA Question of Translation or Transformation? At first, early in the eighteenth century, English novels were considered inferior to works of history and biography, even immoral, in an era when sermons were commonly published and read for enlightenment. Readers expected honesty and truth; novelists therefore disguised their fictions as fact. Samuel Richardson pretended he had found a cache of letters written by Pamela Andrews to her poor but honest parents, for example; these fabrications were embraced as truth, as was Daniel Defoe’s shipwreck of a novel, Robinson Crusoe. Early novel readers had to be weaned away from their taste for accuracy and fidelity to the facts. Aristotle believed that art should imitate life, which is the mantra of The Poetics, his analysis of tragic drama. In English literature, the lines between art and life, between the fictional and\n\n07_274_1Front.qxd\n\nxx\n\n7/24/07\n\n6:08 PM\n\nPage xx\n\nJames M. Welsh\n\nthe factual, began to blur first in fiction, then in theatre, as plays became increasingly realistic during the nineteenth century. The invention first of photography, then of cinematography, suggested that Aristotle’s injunction might be even more demanding and that art might even duplicate life. But if life is merely reflected through the lens, is it art? And what of the marriage between cinematography and theatre that enabled the cinematic illusion merely to extend the theatrical illusion? By the turn of the twentieth century, movies were “imitating” or “replicating” historical events in documentary-styled “actualities,” then dramatizing stories from the Bible (e.g., Judith of Bethulia) or great scenes from Shakespeare or remarkable moments in literature. All of a sudden, everything was adaptable, apparently, and naïve audiences expected fidelity (in the case of literary or dramatic approaches) or authenticity (in the case of historical events, such as the Battle of the Somme during World War I). Perhaps it is pointless to demand historical, biographical, or even fictive “truths” or to worry much about the issue of “fidelity” when historical events or personages or fictional narratives are adapted to the screen. On the other hand, should not one question the accuracy of such stories or histories? Can there be—or should there be—any more central issue in the field of adaptation studies? Even for nonbelievers and infidels? Some might claim that cinema inherently involves manipulation and illusion and is not really about “truth” or “reality.” Others might prefer to believe that the possibility of truth in the abstract could still exist and that fidelity is not only desirable but admirable. Even that erstwhile trendy semiotician, Christian Metz, believed that “‘cinematographic language’ is first of all [concerned with] the literalness of a plot,” as critic Robert Eberwein (1979) wrote, quoting Metz (189). In general, however, theorists cannot stand to be limited by “literal” constraints and would not therefore readily admit to being impressed by a merely “literal” adaptation.\n\nAdapting du Maurier: Hitchcock and Selznick Court Rebecca The problem will effectively be framed in an auteur context, perhaps, if we consider the example of the Daphne du Maurier novel Rebecca, adapted for the screen by Robert E. Sherwood and Joan Harrison. Significantly, Rebecca was the first film Alfred Hitchcock directed in America for producer David O. Selznick. Du Maurier, the true “auteur,” was not at all pleased with the project because she did not believe Hitchcock, the developing movie “auteur,” had been properly respectful in filming her first novel, Jamaica Inn (1939), adapted by Joan Harrison and Sidney Gilliat, with additional dia-\n\n07_274_1Front.qxd\n\n7/24/07\n\n6:08 PM\n\nPage xxi\n\nIntroduction\n\nxxi\n\nlogue provided by novelist J. B. Priestley. She expected better treatment with Rebecca, and Selznick was determined to protect her future interests and integrity. Selznick assigned the Pulitzer Prize–winning playwright Robert Sherwood as the lead screenwriter over Hitchcock regular Joan Harrison; no doubt Sherwood’s contribution (and prestige) helped to earn Selznick the Academy Award nomination. David O. Selznick sided with the novelist and was determined to harness Hitchcock’s tendency to manipulate the source novel, as he had done with Jamaica Inn. Selznick clearly stated his intentions in a memo dated 12 June 1939: “We bought Rebecca, and we intend to make Rebecca.” Thus the battle was joined, with both Hitchcock and Selznick seeking “auteur” status. According to Tom Leitch in his Encyclopedia of Alfred Hitchcock, the producer and the director each had his own notion about how to proceed with this adaptation: “Selznick’s allegiance [was] to an American tradition of quality based on fidelity to acknowledged literary classics and popular successes, Hitchcock’s to the generic formulas that subordinated character to situation and the flair for witty visual exposition that had served him so well in England” (2002, 271). Although Selznick won this battle (in fact, the film was nominated for eleven Academy Awards and won the Best Picture Oscar), Alfred Hitchcock ultimately won the war, when the auteur theory emerged in France in the late 1950s and in America a few years later. An industry dominated by Hollywood studios was clearly in transition, as the studio era, defined by all-powerful producers like Selznick and Irving Thalberg, was drawing to a close. Hitchcock the auteur director was not especially worried about absolute fidelity to his sources. This will be obvious if one considers the changes he made to Joseph Conrad’s The Secret Agent as he transformed that story into Sabotage (1936), a film that would teach him the consequences of sacrificing an endearing character in order to maintain suspense. British writer-director Christopher Hampton would remake the Conrad story in the 1990s and be far more respectful of the source decades later in an adaptation carefully guided by notions of fidelity, but this admittedly more “faithful” treatment hardly replaces the Hitchcock classic. Hitchcock was not destined to become famous for his adaptations, however; usually he did not assail the work of writers of the magnitude of Joseph Conrad, or the popularity of Dame Daphne du Maurier. Even so, Hitchcock did adapt all sorts of material to the screen, drama as well as fiction. His technologically daring film Rope (1948), for example, was adapted for Hitchcock by Hume Cronyn and Arthur Laurents from the play by Patrick Hamilton. Although not exactly a box-office success, this cult film became famous for\n\n07_274_1Front.qxd\n\nxxii\n\n7/24/07\n\n6:08 PM\n\nPage xxii\n\nJames M. Welsh\n\nits dramatic irony, its twisted style, and its technique (most notably for its inventive long takes). Hitchcock’s later dramatic adaptation of Dial M for Murder (1954), adapted by Frederick Knott from his own play, proved more popular but was also famous mainly for its gimmickry, particularly its 3-D cinematography (courtesy of Robert Burks), a potentially engaging attempt to involve viewers within the mise-en-scène. Despite such innovative experiments, Hitchcock’s best work was still to come. Hitchcock knew a good story but generally avoided “classic” adaptations. If traditional Hollywood cared about issues of fidelity, it was not especially out of respect for literature or for those who created it but in order to avoid disappointing readers who knew what they wanted and expected, as demonstrated by the uninspired literalness of the first Harry Potter movies, for example. By contrast, Selznick’s own Gone with the Wind might serve as an apt example of inspired literalness. As critic-reviewer Stanley Kauffmann might suggest, the more purely “literary” the achievement of the source novel, the less likely it is to be effectively or “faithfully” adapted to the screen.\n\nCan One “Repeat the Past” or Even Hope to Recapture It? Picture this: Jack Clayton’s The Great Gatsby (1973), adapted to the screen by no less a talent than Francis Ford Coppola, catches the flavor, the music, the amorality of the 1920s well enough, but even though it may replicate the Zeitgeist of the “Roaring Twenties,” it seriously mistakes F. Scott Fitzgerald’s satire of American optimism and materialism for a romance, and it unfortunately misfires accordingly, to be partially salvaged by the casting of Mia Farrow as a luminescent Daisy Buchanan (whose voice cannot really sound “like money,” though it perhaps comes close enough) and Robert Redford as gorgeous Jay Gatsby (his pink suit glowing in the dark). Though Redford may be able to wear that ridiculous pink suit, he is never entirely convincing as the bootlegger who has “business connections” with the gambler who fixed the World Series of 1919; but this was more a failure of imagination and casting than a lapse of fidelity. “Literal translations are not the faithful ones,” wrote André Bazin, the guiding spirit of the French New Wave. “A character on the screen and the same character as evoked by the novelist are not identical” (1967, 127). Robert Redford is able to sanitize a role by his very presence, removing all of Jay Gatsby’s rough edges and making the bitter and cynical Roy Hobbes seem absolutely heroic in Barry Levinson’s adaptation of Bernard Malamud’s The Natural (1984). That sanitized image will consequently change the nature of the character (in both instances) and the larger meaning of the story itself. While Jack Clayton and Francis Coppola’s Gatsby\n\n07_274_1Front.qxd\n\n7/24/07\n\n6:08 PM\n\nPage xxiii\n\nIntroduction\n\nxxiii\n\nmerely fizzled away ever so gradually and boringly, Levinson’s The Natural completely reversed the corrupt and corrosive conclusion of Malamud’s novel in its desperate attempt to demonstrate the possibility of second chances. “Repeat the past?” Gatsby incredulously asserts to Nick Carraway, then answers himself, “Of course you can!” In fact Gatsby couldn’t repeat the past in his own lifetime, but ten years later Redford could as Roy Hobbes in Levinson’s crowd-pleasing (but outrageously distorted) adaptation of The Natural.\n\nThe Persistence of Fidelity, Again Such flawed film adaptations are interesting because they at least play for high stakes. Levinson’s The Natural has been voted the most popular sports film ever made but only because it thoroughly dismissed any notion of fidelity and turned Roy Hobbes into a Romanticized “hero.” In the case of Fitzgerald’s perfectly crafted story of failed Romantic optimism and aspiration brought down to earth, Gatsby was crippled by its misplaced fidelity to the original, but it was more a betrayal of tone than of narrative structure and development. “More important than such faithfulness,” however, as André Bazin wrote, “is knowing whether the cinema can integrate the powers of the novel (let’s be cautious: at least a novel of the classical kind), and whether it can, beyond the spectacle, interest us less through the representation of events than through our comprehension of them” (2002, 7). For those who worry about the problems and the process of cinematic adaptation, Bazin’s statement still resonates and questions of fidelity still linger because any adaptation will necessarily demonstrate what the medium of film can or cannot achieve in relation to literary sources (whether reaching for the elegance of a Marcel Proust or the vulgarity of a Mickey Spillane), depending upon the imagination of the director and screenwriter. How was the story told? How is it retold? How is it to be sold? Is point of view a particular problem because of a first-person narrator (however limited by relationship or circumstance) or a third-person omniscient narrator? Is the story completely told? If not, has it been intelligently abridged, but if so, was anything lost as a consequence? Do the characters appear much as most readers might expect? Has the story’s meaning been changed and, if so, in what way or ways and to what degree? Has fidelity to tone and nuance been scrupulously observed? (Consider, for example, Francis Ford Coppola’s mistitled Bram Stoker’s Dracula [1992], which turns Lucy Westerna into a randy aristocratic tart, whose language and behavior is inappropriate by polite Victorian drawing-room standards.) Finally, has the film adaptation been true to the\n\n07_274_1Front.qxd\n\nxxiv\n\n7/24/07\n\n6:08 PM\n\nPage xxiv\n\nJames M. Welsh\n\n“spirit” of the original (subjective and problematic though such an assessment may be)? Should readers of Laurence Sterne be willing to settle for the “Cock and Bull Story” delivered by the film?\n\nDancing in the Dark, to the Measure of History and Art For a final example, let’s consider John Lee Hancock’s The Alamo (2004), adapted from history, colored by myth and legend, not a “literary” challenge but a historic one because youngsters raised on this adaptation will no doubt “Remember the Alamo!” accordingly. Did screenwriters Leslie Bohem and Stephen Gaghan (better known as the writer-director of Syriana, one of the best films of 2005) and director John Lee Hancock get the story right? Were the characters dressed as they might have been in 1836? Was the casting “right”? Was Santa Anna, who called himself the “Napoleon of the West,” as vain and as cowardly, for example, as the actor Emilio Echevarría makes him seem? Did “Jim” Bowie and “Davy” Crockett die as heroically as Jason Patric and Billy Bob Thornton represented them in the film? Does it matter? Isn’t it “only a movie,” as Alfred Hitchcock once advised a disturbed actress? Well, yes, it does matter, we would argue (and for that reason we have included Frank Thompson’s essay in the collection that follows). Historical accuracy (which is to say, historical truth) should matter, if viewers or students are to have any authentic appreciation of Texican history. A young viewer’s understanding of The Great Gatsby or The Natural or Edith Wharton’s The Age of Innocence or The House of Mirth or even Gone with the Wind will certainly be influenced by the Hollywood treatment, which ought to place a responsibility on the filmmaking team. A good adaptation doesn’t necessarily have to be exactly “by the book,” but many will expect it to be at least close to the book and not an utter betrayal. And, as the essays that follow here suggest, the “book” could be a history book or a biography, as well as a novel or play. Celluloid is a notoriously unstable medium (literally, in terms of film preservation, for example), but it is a powerful one that makes an impact. In fact, it can be explosive. All the reading one does of Texas/Mexican history could well be obliterated by the silly icon of Fess Parker as “The King of the Wild Frontier” for an earlier generation of students raised on television images or of Billy Bob Thornton as “David” Crockett in John Lee Hancock’s The Alamo, who might rather fiddle than fight. Likewise, students who have seen Bram Stoker’s Dracula will have an oddly skewed impression of the relationship between Mina Murray and “Vlad” because Coppola’s odd screenplay goes well beyond the novel to suggest that Mina is somehow the reincarna-\n\n07_274_1Front.qxd\n\n7/24/07\n\n6:08 PM\n\nPage xxv\n\nIntroduction\n\nxxv\n\ntion of the count’s wife Elizabeta, who, Coppola’s newly invented prologue suggests, died of suicide in the Middle Ages while Vlad was out impaling Turks. Coppola’s disappointed Vlad turns against God in this “interpretation” and is made monstrous as a consequence. Coppola’s treatment builds sympathy for the monster and also builds in the means for his salvation. Presumably that was not what Bram Stoker had in mind. Cinema is wonderful, and film can be entertaining, but pedagogically it needs to be approached carefully. Fidelity, accuracy, and truth are all important measuring devices that should not be utterly ignored or neglected in evaluating a film adapted from a literary or dramatic source. The whole process of adaptation is like a round or circular dance. The best stories and legends, the most popular histories and mysteries, will constantly be told and retold, setting all the Draculas to dancing in the dark as their ghastly stories are spun, or the tall tales of brave Davy Crockett and his ilk, ’til the battle’s lost and won, ’til the dance is over and done. But the point is, it will never be, in cinema or in poetry. Of course, what we have outlined here does not exactly represent a consensus, and even the contributors to this volume may not agree with such notions concerning fidelity and accuracy. The great majority of these contributors to this project would surely agree that the relationship between film and literary (or historical) sources is the basis of the field, but they have different and varied notions about the importance of fidelity. No doubt some, such as Frank Thompson or David Kranz, would argue for “fidelity, accuracy, and truth” as being essential components for evaluating adaptations (though Professor Kranz prefers the phrase comparative criticism to fidelity criticism). Others are more interested in evaluating the relationship between films and their sources in different terms, giving more consideration, for example, to cinematic form (Brian McFarlane), intertextuality (Thomas Leitch), or intellectual history (Donald Whaley) or positing that a film may surpass its source (in the case of Peter Lev’s approach). Additionally, and finally, we have a few contributors such as Walter Metz and Sarah Cardwell—not coincidentally, they are among the younger authors in this volume—who work in adaptation studies but have little interest in the conventional relationship between films and their sources. Professor Cardwell advocates a “noncomparative” adaptation studies that analyzes British television adaptations of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century novels primarily as a genre and not as televisual versions of literary works. Cinema studies did not begin to come of age academically until the 1970s, following the enthusiasm created by what New Republic critic Stanley Kauffmann called “the film generation” during the 1960s, picking up on the\n\n07_274_1Front.qxd\n\nxxvi\n\n7/24/07\n\n6:08 PM\n\nPage xxvi\n\nJames M. Welsh\n\nexcitement created by the inventive filmmakers of the French New Wave and their “Second Wave” counterparts in Britain, Eastern Europe, and, finally, Das neue Kino in Germany. The Italian neorealists (Rossellini, Zavattini, De Sica, and, later, Antonioni and Fellini) had built a tradition immediately after World War II. Sweden was a world unto itself, ruled by the godlike dramaturg-filmmaker Ingmar Bergman. New ideas were found in France, thanks to André Bazin and his magazine, Cahiers du Cinéma, which provided an intellectual haven for such filmmakers as François Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard, who began as budding film critics and who never quite lost their youthful enthusiasm for movie going, as well as filmmaking. Starting with the so-called auteur theory, simplified for Americans by Village Voice critic Andrew Sarris, French notions became ascendant. Bazin was later eclipsed by Christian Metz, who borrowed semiotics from learned linguists and turned it into something called “semiology.” Then in marched the structuralists, followed by the post-structuralists, the feminists, the queer theorists, and the postcolonists. Freud was rediscovered, along with Hitchcock; Derrida had his moment in the sun (as some began to probe his past), and Foucault and the wonderfully whimsical Roland Barthes listened attentively to “the rustle of silence.” These critics gave all of us a lot to think about, but some of them also created a verbal fog of obtuse jargon that could only confuse and befuddle the common viewer (the cinematic equivalent of the common reader). Film, once called the “democratic art,” was still for the masses, but criticism and theory began to levitate toward the ether, becoming ever more lofty and damnably abstract. This collection aspires to bridge that critical gap. All of the authors represented here will be familiar to the readers of LFQ, an academic journal that has always taken pride in its readability as well as its academic substance. Most of the essays included in this anthology are original; a significant few have been culled from recent issues of LFQ. Many of our contributors have written multiple books. Brian McFarlane is Australia’s foremost authority on adaptation and is the author of Words and Images: Australian Novels into Film (1983) and Novel to Film: An Introduction to the Theory of Adaptation (1996). Tom Leitch has specialized on crime films and has published two books dealing with the substance and style of Alfred Hitchcock, as well as writing an original work of adaptation criticism, forthcoming from Johns Hopkins University Press. Linda Cahir, who writes in the present volume on The Manchurian Candidate, has just published Literature into Film: Theory and Practical Approaches (2006). John C. Tibbetts has recently completed a book for Yale University Press that\n\n07_274_1Front.qxd\n\n7/24/07\n\n6:08 PM\n\nPage xxvii\n\nIntroduction\n\nxxvii\n\ncovers composer biopics; he is also the author of Dvořák in America (1994) and is as well informed about music as he is about cinema and theatre. J. P. Telotte, the author of Science Fiction Film (2001), is perhaps the foremost film genre critic in America. Odette Caufman-Blumenfeld, an expert on feminist drama, is the author of Studies in Feminist Drama (1998) and chair of the English Department at the Alexander Ion Cuza University in Iasi, Romania, where she has created a graduate program in cultural studies. The scholarly credentials of all of the writers invited to this anthology may be considered secure. We are pleased and proud to present their work on screen adaptation.\n\nNote 1.

Brian McFarlane\n\nThe idea for this piece grew out of a discussion with an English Department colleague on the 1993 film version of The Age of Innocence. This colleague had enjoyed the film and had found it attractive but added, “Of course it’s not nearly as complex or subtle as the book.” I’d thought the film was a masterpiece and had actually—and, I felt, daringly—said so in print; I’d also admired the novel for many years, though perhaps not so extravagantly. I’m not setting my judgment up as being more accurate (whatever that may mean) than my colleague’s, but the exchange led me to reflect, not just on the matter of adaptation from literature to film, but also on the adequacy of a training in literature for dealing with film and, from the other corner, the adequacy of a training in film for dealing with literature. In Victoria where I come from, at least, it is now common for year 12 secondary school literature courses to offer one or more films as texts to be taught by trained English teachers. To the best of my knowledge, no comparable cinema studies course throws in a novel to be taught by trained teachers of film. I think “convergence among the arts” (in Keith Cohen’s memorable and resonant 1979 phrase in Film and Fiction) is a desirable ideal but that it probably involves a kind of training different from what has been common hitherto.\n\n3\n\n07_274_Ch01.qxd\n\n4\n\n7/24/07\n\n6:09 PM\n\nPage 4\n\nBrian McFarlane\n\nOn a related point, the other impetus for this paper came from Australian novelist Helen Garner’s review of the latest film version of Anna Karenina, which she began by referring to “a class of literature that, by its very nature, is not adaptable to the screen” (1997, B27). What, I wondered, did she mean? That, in this case, it won’t be Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina? Or her idea of Tolstoy’s Anna? Or that such a classic, by its very nature, is beyond the resources of film? Filmmakers, in such cases, are out of their league, she asserted. Her claim that a great novel’s “central energy source” is its “narrative voice” may be unexceptionable, but she goes on to insist that “nothing available to mainstream cinema . . . can translate the authority of that voice” (1997, B27), and here she is simply ignoring—or ignorant of—the nature of film narration, to which this paper will return, and its capacity for asserting its own authoritative voice. The review reminded me of a good deal of middle-class, middle-brow criticism, even from someone as distinguished as Dilys Powell, who wrote of David Lean’s Oliver Twist that it is “careful in the preservation of the skeleton of Dickens’s book (since skeleton is all a film has time for)” (1948, 334). There is at work here little sense that film may have at its command narrational strategies as potentially subtle and complex as those of any other narrative or dramatic mode, and such thinking has led to the perpetuation of such myths as “second-rate” fiction is easier to adapt to the screen. Forty years ago, in his pioneering work Novels into Film (and the titles of such books, my own included, are depressingly similar), George Bluestone (1957) wrote of the overt compatibility but secret hostility between novel and film; in the intervening decades nothing has happened radically to challenge this perception. And when I talk to colleagues about film versions of novels or read the sort of criticism I’ve just been quoting, I am sometimes reminded of the late James Agee ,who wrote in 1946 that he had the idea that many serious-minded people wanted movies to offer more elevated themes or “a good faithful adaptation of Adam Bede in sepia, with the entire text read offscreen by Herbert Marshall” (he of the mellifluous tones) (216). It’s as if they want film to be more like literature and are oblivious to what might make film cinematically exciting. In this way, I suspect that a training in literature doesn’t simply fail to provide an understanding of how a film is working. I think it goes further, and more damagingly, to set up a sort of Leavisite evaluative judgment, a high culture/popular culture hierarchy, in which film inevitably comes below/behind the literary text. For such evaluations, the film is only really valuable as it approximates the precursor literary text. I have to say that my experience is that those of us with a literary training are far more likely to hold forth about film, especially in relation to adaptation, than are the film-trained to lay down the law about literature. Most no-\n\n07_274_Ch01.qxd\n\n7/24/07\n\n6:09 PM\n\nPage 5\n\nIt Wasn’t Like That in the Book . . .\n\n5\n\ntorious, perhaps, among the former—the literary-trained—was F. R. Leavis, who described the idea of filming Women in Love as “an obscene undertaking” (quoted by Christie, 1969, 49). He was, of course, speaking sight unseen. It’s partly, perhaps, a matter of the older discipline’s being wary about according equal status to the newer one; it may also be something to do with the huge popularity of cinema, which perhaps makes it seem dubious as a basis for study comparable with literature. On that matter, incidentally, it has always seemed to me curious to hold the belief that it is easier to produce a work of art which pleases many than it is to produce one which will please only the few. At the risk of this chapter’s containing something to offend everyone, I’d add that, as for the film-trained of today, they are often quite ignorant about literature, and indeed about the other arts in general, but, apart from, say, the reviewers whose favorite novel has been filmed in ways displeasing to them, they tend to limit themselves to the area in which their training has equipped them to recognize such qualities as complexity and subtlety. There are, though, younger film reviewers sometimes ready to court favor by expressing a hip impatience with, say, Shakespeare or Jane Austen, which leads them, almost as a reflex action, to prefer Baz Luhrmann’s film William Shakespeare’s Romeo Juliet or Amy Heckerling’s Clueless to more orthodox adaptations of classic literature. Our training in literature equips us to read complexity and subtlety in novels (I’ll stick to novels mainly for this chapter). We are trained to do more than to read for “mere” narrative, though, speaking as one who has recently read and taught Lady Audley’s Secret and The Woman in White in a melodrama course, I have to say I don’t think there is anything “mere” about narrative in the sense of referring to that skill that carries us breathless from one set of events to the next. We have been taught to be attentive to matters like how point of view is created: for example, to the different kinds of purchase on events which a first-person or omniscient author or a Jamesean “central reflector” allows us: how character is revealed by and precipitates action, how thematic concerns are articulated through character and action in collaboration, how to read—in more modern terminology—sometimes conflicting discourses of, say, gender and class. As a result of all this serious study of how literature works and means, we’re unlikely to see Pride and Prejudice (the novel) as no more than a “merry manhunt” or “a picture of a charming and mannered little English world which has long since been tucked away in ancient haircloth trunks” as the New York Times reviewer described the MGM film of nearly sixty years ago (Crowther, 1940, 191). The attitude of literary people to film adaptations of literary works is almost always to the detriment of the film, only grudgingly conceding what\n\n07_274_Ch01.qxd\n\n6\n\n7/24/07\n\n6:09 PM\n\nPage 6\n\nBrian McFarlane\n\nfilm may have achieved. My contention is that their training hasn’t taught them to look in film for riches comparable to those they find in literature and that, in consequence, their filmgoing experience, especially when adaptation is in question, tends to seem thin by comparison. When viewing the film version of a novel or play they know, they want to find in the film what they valued in the literary work, without asking whether this is the sort of thing film can do. They are too often not interested in something new being made in the film but only in assessing how far their own conception of the novel has been transposed from one medium to the other. One hears such comments as “Of course, she [i.e., Gwyneth Paltrow] is not Emma,” with little thought for what this might mean in the context of a move from the merely representational mode to what Barthes (1977) calls a “mode of the operable” (89). She is not whose Emma? I suspect there is a yearning for fidelity, not just among those with a literary training, but among quite wide sectors of the filmgoing public, without any real concern for how much fidelity is either possible or desirable—or what it might mean. And such thinking begs the question that there is such a thing as a “true” or fixed meaning for a literary text—for any sort of text for that matter. A certain kind of literary training seems also locked into a mimetic approach which sees divergence from realist expectations as some kind of failure. If you want the same experience (and believe you can have just that experience twice) that you had in reading the novel, why not simply reread the novel? It’s much more likely to produce the desired effect. Fidelity is obviously very desirable in marriage; but with film adaptations I suspect playing around is more effective. The discourse on adaptation is perhaps more enduring and pervasive than any other in relation to filmgoing. When we come out of a cinema, we rarely hear people saying, “What sophisticated control of the mise-en-scène” or “Did you notice the poetic use of lap dissolves?” It is, however, quite common to come out of a cinema after viewing an adaptation or to engage in casual conversation about it afterward and to hear such comments as “Why did they change the ending?” or “She was blonde in the book” or, almost inevitably, “I think I liked the book better.” It is a subject on which everyone feels able to have an opinion, and most opinions, from the casually conversational to exegeses in learned journals, still tend to foreground the criterion of fidelity, whether in explicit terms or by tacit assumption. One such account in a scholarly journal is Nicola Bradbury’s essay on the film version of The Europeans in Essays in Criticism. Speaking of one episode, she writes, “It is not, quite, a picture from James’s novel, though it is thoroughly Jamesean in tone, and excellent cinema” (Bradbury, 1979, 299). By which she seems to mean, in her next sentence, that “every aspect of setting, action, dialogue, charac-\n\n07_274_Ch01.qxd\n\n7/24/07\n\n6:09 PM\n\nPage 7\n\nIt Wasn’t Like That in the Book . . .\n\n7\n\nter, image, and theme is interrelated”—and she might just as well be talking about the book. The film, she makes clear, is sensitive and discreet insofar as it matches James. My dissatisfaction with this approach does not stem from the idea of enjoying a particular novel more than its film version; it would be surprising if one had no preference. My dissatisfaction grows from a failure to distinguish between what one might reasonably expect to find transferable from one medium of display to another and what requires the invoking of the processes of what I call “adaptation proper.” Here, essentially, is where a literary training proves most inadequate. It is easy enough to tell, even to quantify, what narrative kernels (in Seymour Chatman’s term) or “cardinal functions” (in Roland Barthes’s term—i.e., what he deems “hinge-points of narrative,” opening up alternative narrative possibilities) have been transferred from the wholly verbal sign system to the system of audiovisual moving images. It is less easy, but a lot more interesting and rewarding, to consider how the processes of “adaptation proper” go about their business: This is where a knowledge of the strategies of film narration or enunciation becomes crucial. I mean here essentially the ways in which the three large classes of film narration—mise-en-scène, editing, and soundtrack, in their various subcategories—put before us the narrative events which, in their bare bones, may have been transferred from page to celluloid. To be ignorant of these is to be ignorant of how film creates meaning in those large areas which pervade a text vertically, as distinct from the horizontal causally linked chain of events. It’s important for me to stress that merely being bold in the matter of adaptation won’t ensure a good/interesting/stimulating film, whether it outrages devotees of the precursor text or not. A recent example is Jane Campion’s A Portrait of a Lady. A good deal of this seems to me intelligent in its rendering of a “young woman affronting her destiny,” making a sad mess of her life, and maintaining her integrity the while. However, whenever the film’s makers set out to be bold, their efforts look so self-conscious, so determinedly filmic, in the context of the naturalism of the classical Hollywood narrative style of the rest of the film, that these “touches” seem merely disruptive. I mean the opening with a lot of young Australian women talking on screen about kissing, all done in black and white, and in no clear way related to what follows; or the home movie scenes of Isabel’s travels; or the scene in which she imagines herself sexually fondled by three men. These constitute “bold” breaks with the expected in the sense, first, that they are departures from James, which one wouldn’t on principle object to, and, second, that they challenge unproductively the validity of the dominant narrative mode of film storytelling in which they are cast. The black-and-white prologue and the\n\n07_274_Ch01.qxd\n\n8\n\n7/24/07\n\n6:09 PM\n\nPage 8\n\nBrian McFarlane\n\nwashed-out old-photographs look of the home movies offers a disconcerting break from the prevailing Technicolor, and the scene of sexual fantasizing, while arguably an objectification of what is part of Isabel’s confusion, sits strangely with the rest of the film in which sexuality is suppressed and its manifestations discreetly if powerfully encoded. I would argue that these apparently bold touches have the effect of being grafted onto, rather than imaginatively integrated into, Campion’s incarnation of the novel’s concerns, that they are jarring rather than enriching or provocative. She has not made the really bold leap that characterizes such transformations as Welles’s Chimes at Midnight or Gus Van Sant’s My Own Private Idaho or Amy Heckerling’s Clueless or Alfonso Cuarón’s 1997 version of Great Expectations. In each of these cases, what is offered is, in some sense, a radical reworking of the precursor text, a kind of commentary on its great antecedent, a new work. But if merely being bold is no guarantee that the filmmaker will give satisfaction to audiences who may or may not have read the antecedent novel, neither is a slavish devotion to the original text: that is, to details of plot, character, and settings, for example. Not being bold can cripple the processes of adaptation, and one can end up with not so much an adaptation as an embalmment of a famous work. I place a good deal of BBC classic serial filmmaking in this category: I know enough people loved the serialization of Pride and Prejudice to warrant its being run twice in Australia within a few months (though I suspect the local chapter of the Colin Firth Fan Club of having a hand in that), but it seemed to me the work of an industrious bricklayer rather than an architect, with one event from the novel remorselessly following another, without any sense of shape or structuring, without any apparent point of view on its material. By this assertion, I mean a sort of dogged reproduction, incident by incident, of the novel’s narrative. In fact, the old Hollywood film may have had a surer sense of what it was up to: that is, it was a light-hearted romantic comedy, fuelled by the sorts of star presences and narrative blockages and inevitable closure that characterized the genre. The BBC’s version was eminently more respectable, as if it feared criticism from the academy; it took endless pains over the look of things in early nineteenth-century England; it filled out dialogue exchanges with no doubt well-researched episodes of country dancing and authentically got-up carriages travelling through picturesque countryside; but it seemed to have nothing to say dramatically about its material, except perhaps that sexual attraction was more potent than class or wealth—and we knew that if we’d read the novel, possibly even if we hadn’t. Some of the Merchant-Ivory versions of James and Forster belong in this category in my view: the decorous, undaring, step-by-step, filmmaking-by-numbers approach to the adaptation\n\n07_274_Ch01.qxd\n\n7/24/07\n\n6:09 PM\n\nPage 9\n\nIt Wasn’t Like That in the Book . . .\n\n9\n\nof the classics, as if the aim was to placate an academy waiting with fangs bared to seize on any violation of the original. Violation, tampering: the sorts of terms used suggest deeply sinister processes of molestation. It may be beginning to sound as if I can’t be satisfied with adaptation of any kind, that I’m irritated by the merely bold and by the overreverent. I should say that this sort of captiousness is not the case and that, in relation to the latter (the close approximation in film terms of the functions of the original), fidelity to incident and character connections, to period and place, doesn’t necessarily produce a poor film or a film that can’t stand evaluative comparison with the novel. Peter Bogdanovich’s Daisy Miller is a striking example of what I mean here: with one exception, admittedly an important one, it transfers all the major examples of what Roland Barthes would call “cardinal functions”; its characters are given to do what they do in the novel and almost always where they do it in the novel. Nevertheless, while observing this surprising degree of transfer, I’d say there is enough of Bogdanovich’s own “commentary,” making itself felt in the film’s enunciatory procedures, on the action devised by James, to lead us to feel we are seeing something new. He seems to me, in adhering to the events of the novel, to provide a commentary on the nature and effects of repression, especially of sexual repression, rather than merely to reproduce the Jamesean complex fate. And one might also add that the Merchant-Ivory team achieve something similar in their adaptation of Howard’s End when the brutalities of class oppressiveness are made so poignant. The ideal seems to me to be, on the one hand, bold and intelligent and, on the other, determined to make something both connected to its precursor and new in itself. The film has the right to be judged as a film; then, one of the many things it also is an adaptation (it is also the product of a particular industrial system, a genre film, part of a tradition of national filmmaking, etc). That is, the precursor literary work is only an aspect of the film’s intertextuality, of more or less importance according to the viewer’s acquaintance with the antecedent work. In, for example, thinking about Olivier’s Hamlet, it may be as important to have in mind the nature of British “quality” cinema, the works that accounted for its postwar prestige, its relation to the British theatrical tradition, the Freudian psychologizing of Dr. Ernest Jones, and the film noir stylistic and thematic preoccupations so common at the time, as it is to have Shakespeare’s play. This is difficult for those of us trained in literature to accept: to approach a narrative mode which expends itself in, say, two hours and find in it complexity and subtlety in their own way as striking as those a novel may develop over several hundred pages and seven or eight hours of reading time. But I would claim that this does happen and\n\n07_274_Ch01.qxd\n\n10\n\n7/24/07\n\n6:09 PM\n\nPage 10\n\nBrian McFarlane\n\nthat the great works of adaptation, particularly of the classics, of works that have been valued by many people over a long period, make us reconsider the original in the light of what a later period and another sign system have made of it, bearing in mind the sorts of other influences I have talked about. I can imagine an approach to the recent film of The Wings of the Dove, which lamented the loss of the extended passages of interior analysis through which James gives us access to the machinations of Kate Croy and the reluctant acquiescence of Merton Densher in her scheme for him to marry the dying Millie Theale and then inherit her vast wealth. (Incidentally, I can also imagine an approach that welcomed such losses.) The film shears away many characters, reduces others to more or less shadowy figures in the wings and focuses the hard bright light of its intelligence and compassion on the central trio. Through decisions made about cutting between faces and the interception of glances, through the framing of faces either, say, in close-up or in sustained two-shot (e.g., Milly and Kate at oblique angles from each other as, from their balcony, they overlook Venice and talk of Merton), about costume and ways of looking, moving and sitting and gesturing, the interior nature of the drama at work among these three is conducted with a rigor that even the rigorous James might have approved. The film is updated to 1910, which may occasion purist objection, but it can also be argued that it enables convincingly just that much more freedom in the representation of sexual desire as to make Kate’s conflict accessible to us now. That she is strongly sexually attracted to Densher intensifies the sense of what she is compelling herself to suppress in urging him to press his intentions on Millie. On another aspect of the difficulties of her situation, that is the oppressiveness for a wellborn young woman in being without money, the film’s mise-en-scène is persistently rigorous and complex in suggesting the different ways in which different settings can oppress. In London, the opening sequence on the Underground at once suggests the difficulty which impoverished lovers might experience in finding privacy: The silent journey in which their space is confined by jostling others builds up mutely a state of tension in which erotic release is finally given in the kiss in the lift. Elsewhere, Densher’s rooms are located in a narrow street whose oppressive potential is created in the mise-en-scène: A low-angled shot stresses the daunting aspect of the slit of light between two high buildings of somber grey; color, light, and angle do the work of rendering not merely place but the quality of place, which, in a novel, might be done through the descriptive aspect of the discursive prose. At the country seat of Lord Mark, the aristocrat whom Kate’s aunt wants her to marry, the sheer scale of the establishment, first indicated in an imposing exterior, then elaborated in shots of its overbearing interior\n\n07_274_Ch01.qxd\n\n7/24/07\n\n6:09 PM\n\nPage 11\n\nIt Wasn’t Like That in the Book . . .\n\n11\n\ngrandeur, is again made palpable through the agency of the mise-en-scène, especially in the choices made about where to put the camera and where and when to move it. All these filming decisions are in the interests of making what Lord Mark has to offer the impoverished Kate seem as impressive as possible—and his motives as questionable. When the narrative moves to Venice, the mise-en-scène triumphantly furthers the whole drama of duplicity. Millie Theale’s innocence is seen as threatened by an ambience in which nothing is solid, where the possibilities for deceit are unlimited. Especially in matters of color and lighting, in the juxtaposing of the superficial beauties of the place with the actualities of its decay and the masquerade in which the lovers make use of disguise to pursue their liaison, the complex web of corruption is rendered in terms of image and editing. The camera—what it chooses to attend to and from what angle and distance and according to what kind of focus, whether it is still or moving, how it frames what is presented to its lens, or what information it chooses to withhold—is, in collaboration with the editor who decides on the suturing of shots to act out the director’s intention, as capable of complexity and subtlety, of ensuring emotional and intellectual engagement, as the writer is on the page in the exercise of a quite other sign system. I began by talking about The Age of Innocence, so it is perhaps appropriate that I should try to demonstrate what I mean by a few direct references to it. About twenty minutes into the film is a wonderful long shot of a substantial New York apartment building (possibly Mrs. Manson Mingott’s) standing at a snowy crossroads, while at the other three corners there is nothing to be seen but the earliest stages of foundation digging. This shot is preceded and followed by interiors, the former at Mrs. Mingott’s house and on its steps, with Mrs. Welland saying it is a mistake for the Countess Olenska to be seen going about with the raffish Julius Beaufort, and the latter over Mrs. Welland’s dinner table where the discussion is about Ellen’s behavior. The shot, intrinsically stunning in its composition, colors, lighting, and angle of vision, seems at first gratuitous. As I’ve said, it’s placed between two interior scenes thick with elegant decoration and charged social talk, and it is apparently offered without comment. In itself, though, it does constitute a comment: it reminds us that this city, with its pretensions, dicta, and assiduously preserved rituals, behaving as if its decorums were sanctioned by generations of lawgivers, is actually still in the process of being built. The mere fact of its being an extreme long shot is itself significant: it implies that if you could stand back and view the city from some detached, sufficiently distant perspective, you might get a very different view on its life from that to be had\n\n07_274_Ch01.qxd\n\n12\n\n7/24/07\n\n6:09 PM\n\nPage 12\n\nBrian McFarlane\n\nin its socially acceptable purlieux. A single shot is, through the exercise of multiple cinematic strategies, including somberly dignified music on the soundtrack, imbued with a complexity and subtlety that cause it to stay in the mind long after the film is over. We can, of course, let it pass by without registering more than its aesthetic qualities, or not even that: I’m suggesting that, if we give it the kind of attention we expect to give the prose of a great novel, we shall be rewarded not only by its intrinsic beauty but by its commentative power as well. The second example I want to draw attention to occurs even earlier in the film. The passage begins at the opera at the moment when Mrs. Julius Beaufort traditionally rises from her seat (in a box of course) to go home to receive her guests for the Beauforts’ annual ball. A series of shots is joined by dissolves to remove Mrs. Beaufort at the usual moment from the opera to her waiting carriage to her home and to show the opulence of a home which can afford to have a large ballroom for use only once a year. Each successive dissolve signifies a lapse of time and a further stage in the preparation for the ball, over a period of days, perhaps weeks, before the night itself. The dissolves not merely link the shots but also comment on their interconnectedness: The first, for instance, gets Mrs. Beaufort from the opera house into her waiting carriage, as well as gives us a sense of the relative weight which these New Yorkers attach to high culture and high society—the latter wins hands down in any sort of competition for serious attention. This sequence of brief shots linked/separated by dissolves is accompanied by the narrator in ironic voice-over (and drawing on Edith Wharton’s own words) drawing attention to the habits of the natives, then homing in on the Beauforts’ pretensions in particular. The three shots of the ballroom itself represent the stages by which it is transformed from dust-sheeted emptiness to the gleam of readiness to the culminating moment of the orchestra’s playing “Radetsky’s March” as the dancers approach the camera with the exhilarating confidence of people absolutely assured of their place in society. The dissolves themselves act as signifiers of time passed, of time collapsed between three specific points, bringing us up to the moment of the dancing. And following the shots of the orderly dance, viewed in long shot from a high angle, to make the full formality of the occasion clear, the camera cuts to a close-up of the gentlemen’s identical gloves awaiting later collection, a further point mutely made about the formality and conformity of this sample of New York society. I’ve deliberately chosen a moment of no particularly crucial importance to the narrative to show how the film’s narrational resources can be marshalled in the interests of economical storytelling.\n\n07_274_Ch01.qxd\n\n7/24/07\n\n6:09 PM\n\nPage 13\n\nIt Wasn’t Like That in the Book . . .\n\n13\n\nI’ll finish by referring to a brief, much later extract, which is important to the film’s main narrative line and in which, characteristically of this film, the visual and the aural work together in intricate ways, mediated by the subtlety of the editing. The scene dissolves from Ellen’s stepping into the sunlit street to meet Newland, then dissolves again to the lakeside tea table, where in a series of alternating medium close-ups the situation between the two wouldbe lovers is revealed. This gives way to a tighter alternation of each seen over the shoulder of the other, a way of stressing the inextricable connection between the two and tightening the tension between them, and there is then a brief alternation between their hands touching on the table and the previous set of shots in which the camera looks over the shoulder of one at the other. In the two dissolves that follow, she first vanishes from the scene leaving him deserted, then he vanishes while the camera stays briefly and poignantly on the empty verandah and the voice of Enya on the soundtrack sings the famous song of a dream of love’s tenacity, “I dreamt I dwelt in marble halls.” That it is no more than a dream is reinforced by its being the aural link between this segment and the next, which returns us to thriving New York. The solitary building I showed of the earlier extract is now no longer isolated (the mise-en-scène effortlessly but unobtrusively making a point about material progress) and an army of uniformed businessmen, in top coats and bowlers held on against the wind, moving in slow motion, makes with visual eloquence Wharton’s—and Scorsese’s—point about the conformity which Newland will now find hard to escape. As the song on the soundtrack ends, he emerges from this anonymous crowd. The three categories of narrational strategies—mise-en-scène, editing, and soundtrack—work together to imbue these two transitional sequences of shots with a complexity and subtlety which I think ought to have satisfied my colleague if her training had equipped her to look for these in film and to read the distinctive grammar of the medium. There is a good deal of overlap in areas of intellectual and affective response to a novel and to the film derived from it, but these responses are, of course, the result of two different processes of articulation. It may seem uphill work, but I think it is important for those of us involved in both film and literature to urge more strongly the dropping of a high culture/popular culture hierarchy or even dichotomy, the abandoning of the fidelity approach in favor of a more productive invoking of intertextuality, and the attention to what makes for such qualities as subtlety and complexity in film rather than complaining of the loss of what is peculiar to literature. Film is perhaps so easy to enjoy that it becomes even easier not to notice that a lot is going on.\n\n07_274_Ch01.qxd\n\n14\n\n7/24/07\n\n6:09 PM\n\nPage 14\n\nBrian McFarlane\n\nWorks Cited Agee, James. 1946.

Leitch\n\nThese are great times to be writing about the cinematic adaptation of literary texts, partly because there has been such a renascence of publications in the field, partly because a productive rupture has arisen between the theory and practice of adaptation studies. This rupture appears in ritual response to each new film adaptation of a canonical novel. On the release of Mira Nair’s brisk, colorful adaptation of Vanity Fair, the director disputed an interviewer’s remark that “Thackeray condemns Becky more than you do,” arguing that the novel was serialized “in a tabloid and editors would respond to him constantly about his last episode. That’s what I ascribe to the classic ‘Hollywood interference mode’: the inconsistencies of the character. . . . He was actually admonished: ‘You’re enjoying Becky too much. Make it clearer who’s the virgin and who’s the whore’” (Wilmington, 2004, 3). Contributors to the Indiana University’s VICTORIA listserv (n.d.) responded with predictable outrage. Patrick Leary, disputing Nair’s suggestion that “she has somehow rescued Thackeray’s original, frustrated intention” as “pure fantasy,” insisted that “the ever-compliant Bradbury & Evans never once in all their long association with Thackeray had anything in particular to say about the content of the fiction he published with them. Nor would Thackeray have paid them any attention if they had.” Sheldon Goldfarb\n\n15\n\n07_274_Ch02.qxd\n\n16\n\n7/24/07\n\n6:09 PM\n\nPage 16\n\nThomas M. Leitch\n\nagreed that Vanity Fair was serialized not in a “tabloid” but in its monthly parts, adding, “The ending in the novel reflects the tension that builds up in its latter stages: a tension between the desire to get into high society (the social climbing impulse) and the fear of getting into it (the fear of then being set upon by all the high society ladies, etc.). This is a very interesting tension in the novel (I think reflecting a tension in Thackeray himself), and it is much better expressed by the novel’s ending than the film’s.” Micael Clarke defended Nair’s film as “follow[ing] the novel in important ways”: its “surface sumptuousness,” its critique of society, its sympathy for women. Sarah Brown added that “the Natasha Little version of a few years back [written by Andrew Davies and directed by Marc Munden, 1998] was conspicuously good— sophisticatedly alert to Thackeray’s irony—and it had a real sense of narrative drive and momentum which I don’t think is consistently true of the novel.” Tamara S. Wagner added, “Talking about videos and dvds, I have just been given a catalogue by my university’s AV department: a list of ‘Highly Acclaimed Video Programs from Professor Elliot Engel (They’re Light & Enlightening),’ featuring such titles as ‘The Brilliant and Bizarre Brontës’ and ‘A Dickens of a Christmas.’ Has anyone ever seen (or used) any of those? (Otherwise, we’ll rather go on and order movies like Wild Wild West or Round the World in 80 Days [sic] starring Jackie Chan—light and entertaining enough, I suppose, if one wanted to be entertained of course.)” Despite their differences of opinion, all these statements, including Nair’s, ignore fifty years of adaptation theory in uncritically adopting the author’s intention as a criterion for the success of both the novel and any possible film adaptation. Only Brown suggests that the film could actually improve on the novel. Even she shares the habit, articulated most openly by Wagner, of ranking films based on canonical literary sources above merely “entertaining” films and, incidentally, in preferring evaluation to analysis when considering films in general and adaptations in particular. Although it is unlikely that these commentators or their colleagues would defend these positions as theoretical principles, they do not hesitate to adopt them in practice. One reason that adaptation theory has had so little impact on studies of specific adaptations is that until quite recently, adaptation study has stood apart from the main currents in film theory. As the titles of most of the volumes listed above indicate, they trace their descent more directly from literary studies. Studies of Shakespeare on film, for example, use Shakespeare as a locus around which to organize their analysis of film adaptation. As the center around which individual adaptations orbit or the root from which the adaptations all grow, Shakespeare or Thackeray provides not only an organizing principle for the study of specific adaptations but an implicit standard\n\n07_274_Ch02.qxd\n\n7/24/07\n\n6:09 PM\n\nPage 17\n\nLiterature vs. Literacy\n\n17\n\nof value for them all. Kamilla Elliott observes that “theories of the novel and of the film within their separate disciplines appear to have been significantly influenced by interdisciplinary rivalries” (2003, 13). More specifically, studies of adaptation tend to privilege literature over film in two ways. By organizing themselves around canonical authors, they establish a presumptive criterion for each new adaptation. And by arranging adaptations as spokes around the hub of such a strong authorial figure, they establish literature as a proximate cause of adaptation that makes fidelity to the source text central to the field. Few empirical studies of adaptation accept these assumptions uncritically. In what is widely regarded as the founding text in adaptation study, George Bluestone notes that “changes are inevitable the moment one abandons the linguistic for the visual medium” (1957, 5) and concludes, “It is as fruitless to say that film A is better or worse than novel B as it is to pronounce Wright’s Johnson’s Wax Building better or worse than Tchaikowsky’s Swan Lake” (5–6). Both Sarah Cardwell’s study (2002) of television adaptations of four classic English novels and most of the essays collected in Deborah Cartmell and Imelda Whelehan’s recent anthology (1999) question the primacy of literature as a touchstone for cinema. To the extent that adaptation study subordinates both specific adaptations to their canonical source texts and cinema as a medium to literature as a medium, it serves either faithfully or not, however, adaptations are studied under the sign of literature, which provides an evaluative touchstone for films in general. This approach has dominated a half century of adaptation studies for several reasons. None of the first generation of scholars who led the charge to introduce film studies to the academy had received formal training in film studies themselves. Most of them came from English departments where they had been absorbed the pedagogical habits of close reading and the aesthetic values of literature—what James Naremore calls “the submerged common sense of the average English department . . . a mixture of Kantian aesthetics and Arnoldian ideas about society” (2000, 2). Although Naremore traces these Arnoldian ideas to Culture and Anarchy, the program of comparative evaluation at the heart of Arnold’s own aesthetics emerges more clearly in “The Study of Poetry.” Having offered poetry, in which “the idea is everything,” as a substitute for a religious tradition undermined by such heterodox facts as the discovery of ancient fossils and the theory of evolution, Arnold urges, We should conceive of poetry worthily, and more highly than it has been the custom to conceive of it. We should conceive of it as capable of higher uses,\n\n07_274_Ch02.qxd\n\n18\n\n7/24/07\n\n6:09 PM\n\nPage 18\n\nThomas M. Leitch\n\nand called to higher destinies, than those which in general men have assigned to it hitherto. More and more mankind will discover that we have to turn to poetry to interpret life for us, to console us, to sustain us. Without poetry, our science will appear incomplete; and most of what now passes with us for religion and philosophy will be replaced by poetry. (1903, vol. 4, 2)\n\nIf the burden Arnold places on poetry seems quaintly anachronistic, the passage may readily be freshened by replacing the term with literature or novels or indeed cinema—though not, clearly, with popular culture, from whose degrading influence Arnold assigns poetry, as successors like Tamara Wagner would presumably assign canonical cinema, the specific function of rescuing us. The earliest films to come in for academic study under the Arnoldian dispensation that still ruled in American universities in 1960 fell into two categories: adaptations of canonical classics that served as adjuncts to the literary canon and classic works of cinema that could be studied as members of a supplementary quasi-literary cinematic canon. The first approach generated myriad courses in Shakespeare and film, the second courses in the masters of European art cinema from Dreyer to Bergman, Antonioni, and Godard, and, still later, in quasi-canonical American masters like Chaplin, Welles, and Hitchcock. Under this dispensation, many films were studied under the aegis of the literary works that gave them currency. Courses in Shakespeare and film were often courses in Shakespeare through film. Other courses were conducted under the sign of literature, analyzing and evaluating the films at hand as if they were literary works themselves, mining them for the ambiguity, complexity, penetration, and personal expressiveness traditionally associated with literature. In every case, specific literary works and literature in general were stipulated as touchstones. Elliott has traced in trenchant detail the conflict between categorical approaches to adaptation, which follow Lessing’s Laocoön in emphasizing the differences among such sister arts as literature, painting, and cinema that make them distinct modes with different expressive and representational possibilities, and analogical approaches, which follow Horace’s “Ars Poetica” in emphasizing similarities among the arts that make it reasonable to imagine translations from one medium to another. What she does not emphasize in opposing these two approaches is their shared assumption that adaptation study is essentially aesthetic. Both categorical studies of adaptation and studies that emphasize analogies among the arts take as their central line of inquiry the question of what makes works of art successful—or what, in the more old-fashioned language adopted by both Horace and Lessing, makes them beautiful.\n\n07_274_Ch02.qxd\n\n7/24/07\n\n6:09 PM\n\nPage 19\n\nLiterature vs. Literacy\n\n19\n\nThis inquiry is remote from the central inquiry of academic film studies, which from its beginnings had staked its insurgent disciplinary claims by rejecting the aesthetic appreciation of literature and developing a competing methodology of cultural critique rooted in the revolutionary intellectual ferment in France during the 1960s and 1970s. Films were valuable not because they formed a canon of fully achieved works of art according to traditional aesthetic criteria but because they raised illuminating questions, offered insight into overdetermined historical moments or the contemporary scene, exploded shibboleths that stifled critical discussion, or otherwise promoted a more thoughtful analysis of what Michel Foucault called the human sciences. The rift between the aesthetic approach of literary studies and the analytical approach of cinema studies marked adaptation studies in two ways. It isolated adaptation studies from film studies, aligning it more closely with the programs in literary studies from which so many of its early practitioners had come. The further film studies drifted toward the left, unmasking film after film for political critique, the more firmly adaptation scholars dug in their heels on the right, championing the old-guard values of universalist humanism. At the same time, the rift widened between the theory and the practice of adaptation studies, which continued to take literary aesthetics as its touchstone and canonical works and authors as its organizing principle. It could hardly have been otherwise, since even potential methodological inversions of Shakespeare on film—Hitchcock’s literary sources, for example—would have enshrined Hitchcock the auteur, film studies’ version of the literary classic, in place of Shakespeare as the locus of meaning and value. The persistence of humanist values in adaptation studies is not so much a triumph of Arnold as a triumph of evaluation that insists that originals are always touchstones of value for their adaptations, unless of course the adaptations are better. Even the staunchest partisans of textual fidelity, after all, urge their students to revise their papers. Fidelity makes sense as a criterion of value only when we can be certain that the model is more valuable than the copy. In the absence of this certainty, teachers license Hitchcock’s free adaptations and urge students to revise, not because"
