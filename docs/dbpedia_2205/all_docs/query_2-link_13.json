        "text": "Post by Ish Kabbible on\n\nAfter watching over 50 hours of Charlie Chan films in a little over a months time,there is no way my efforts will be washed away down the Internet sludge stream. So here I go,reposting the whole magilla. I guess I can't or shouldn't repost all the replies and comments this thread had recieved.Its gonna look like I was some strange voice in the wilderness talking to himself and watching these films at a super-ridiculous pace.Wait...that already is my reputation.Well hope it works,along with the pictures and videos I previously inserted.\n\nPost by Ish Kabbible on\n\nCharlie Chan in films has an interesting history. First appearing in 1926 as silent 10-chapter serials and portrayed by Japanese or Korean actors. These film failed at the box office. Then 20th Century Fox cast Swedish actor Warner Oland and with the inclusion of sound the films clicked. The Black Camel was the 2nd Oland Chan film. The 1st,3rd,4th and 5th seem to be lost forever due to warehouse fires,deterioration and neglect\n\nThe Black Camel was shot on location in Honolulu and was about the mystery behind a Hollywood movie star's death. I got a kick out of Chan's bumbling assistant,Kashimo, who from time to time,would come running up from out of nowhere shouting Clue..Clue.. and give Chan some useless piece of info. Then Charlie would send him away on some impossible task. And of course one of the hallmarks of the Charlie Chan character was his wise sayings. Such as when a person tells Charlie his theory is full of holes and won't hold water, Charlie retorts \"Sponge full of holes.Holds water\" or \"Secret to this case harder to determine than alley cat's grandfather\"\n\nThe Black Camel alas has too many characters to make an effective murder mystery. The movie ends with Kashimo once again running up to the camera brathlessly shouting \"Clue..Clue..' and Charlie saying \"Too late-Save for next case\"\n\nPost by Ish Kabbible on\n\nCharlie Chan In London (1934)\n\nWell not really since the whole film takes place inside an old English countryside manor not counting a 2 minute fox hunt. A man has been found guilty of murder and is sentenced to hang in 3 days.His sister pleads for Charlie to find the real killer before its too late. Ray (Man With The Xray Eyes) Milland plays the sister's boyfriend. A quick paced whodunnit,nicely acted .\n\nThis is the first Chan film not adapting the original novels.Also missing here is the comedy angle of an assisstant or #1 son. There is a quick reference to the prior film,The Black Camel, and a reference that Charlie is married with 12 kids. The DVD also includes a theatrical trailer and a 13 minute featurette regarding the history of Asians as portrayed in early Hollywood and Charlie Chan's impact\n\nA fine old fashioned detective tale\n\nPost by Ish Kabbible on\n\nCharlie Chan In Paris (1935)\n\nThis movie has the first appearence of Keye Luke as Lee Chan or later to be known as #1 Son assisting his father.\n\nCharlie is sent to investigate a bank fraud case which leads to 2 murders,frameups,attempts on Charlie's life and secret passageways thru the sewers of Paris.These films seem to all clock in at approx 75 minutes so they move along briskly. There's a great little dance number in a cafe,a violent dance as if between a pimp and his prostitue.\n\nCharlie also packs a gun for his protection-he'll need it since his life was threatened within the first 5 minutes of this movie.\n\nThis film was thought lost for many years until a copy was found in Europe in the late 70s. What really holds my attention so far in this series is Warner Oland's portrayal of Charlie Chan.He makes him a very likable detective,easy to identify with. Not debonoir like The Thin Man,not handsome like The Saint,not slightly sleazy like Sam Spade. Just a nice family type guy with a great saying for every occasion\n\n\"Only foolish man waste words when argument is lost. \"\n\n\"Hasty conclusion like gunpowder. Easy to explode\"\n\n\"Optimist only sees doughnut. Pessimist sees hole.\"\n\nThe DVD also includes a 25 minute featurette on Chan's creator Erle Derr Biggers who unfortunately died of a heart attack in 1933 just as the Charlie Chan series was gaining steam\n\nPost by Ish Kabbible on\n\nCharlie Chan in Egypt (1935)\n\nFirst Charlie Chan film with supernatural undertones. Charlie investigates the murder of an archeologist whose body is found wrapped in mummy bandages. This movie has some great and unfortunetly serious bad points of interest\n\nThe great includes early in the movie some fantastic aerial video of Egyptian archeological sites of that time period including the pyramids and the Sphinx. There is also a small role played by actress Rita Cansino who will soon change her name to Rita Hayworth. A few scenes inside Egyptian tombs are also effective\n\nThe big negative is the inclusion of Stepin Fetchit, the most unsettling (to modern sensabilities) black actor of his time. Bad enough that Chan is played by a Caucasian actor-at least with respect and as a positive role model. But I just cringe watching Stepin Fetchit go through his routine\n\nKeye Luke as #1 son is missing here,but returns for the next movie,I think permanently. Also a reference to the prior movie set in Paris is a nice touch of continuity.Again,a very enjoyable entry to the series.\n\nThe DVD also includes a 20 minute feature entitled The Real Charlie Chan. This feature is fascinating,about the life of Chang Apana,legendary Honolulu detective at the turn of the century. Erle Derr Biggers apparently researched this man's career before writing the first novel. Chang was a two-fisted detective who specialized in single-handedly breaking up gambling and smuggling rings. He was known not to wait for back-up,instead wading into the midst of the criminal activities on his own. Didn't believe in guns but carried a bullwhip and knew how to use it. Thrown out of windows,shot 6 times-there was no stopping this guy. Set a record for arresting 70 criminals at once by himself and his bullwhip. As the Charlie Chan novels and movies gained popularity,people in Hawaii started calling Chang Charlie Chan. When Chang died in the late 30s headlines all over America referred to him as the real Charlie Chan. They didn't look alike, and Chang resorted to his fists rather than his intellect, but Charlie Chan's creator did acknowledge Changs influence in creating a Chinese detective\n\nBTW-in the movie someone asked Charlie if he needed a pair of pajamas for the evening. Charlie said he takes a size 52. WOW\n\nDr. Anton Racine: You have a theory about this, of course?\n\nCharlie Chan: Theory like mist on eyeglasses - obscures facts.\n\nDr. Anton Racine: Our local authorities have very clear vision, Mr. Chan\n\nPost by Ish Kabbible on\n\nCharlie Chan in Shanghai (1935)\n\nCharlie in China, home of his ancestors,and at a banquet in his honor, a prominent British official is murdered via a booby-trap box. Keye Luke is back for good with this entry. There's fisticuffs aplenty and Keye Luke demonstrates a great flying drop kick down a flight of stairs. See Charlie Chan sing to little children and also admit he's 60 years old.\n\nOpium smuggling and more physical violence than any previous Chan flick. A good one although the set dosn't fool me for a second that this takes place in the real Shanghai\n\nThe DVD also includes a Spanish version of a lost Charlie Chan movie, Charlie Chan Carries On. Completely different cast but uses the same sets and costumes\n\nPost by Ish Kabbible on\n\nCharlie Chan's Secret (1936)\n\nThe Chan films,IMO, keep getting better and better in small degrees. This one contains many supernatural elements.\n\nAn ocean liner sinks off Honolulu and Allen Colby, heir to millions, is presumed dead...but local sleuth Charlie Chan is not so sure, and flies to San Francisco to investigate further. Somehow, the missing Colby is there ahead of him...but is knifed in the back before seeing anyone. Further events revolve around spiritualist Mrs. Lowell, her family of suspicious characters, and the spooky, untenanted Colby mansion, where the body turns up during a seance!\n\nSecret passageways,sliding wall panels with mystery hands throwing daggers or firing guns,creepy music,ouija boards and a great seance make this a fun flick\n\nI was wrong to presume that Key Luke was back to stay for he was missing-the only negative for the movie. But now I know he'll appear for the rest of the Warner Oland films. The humor aspect is provided by a timid British Butler\n\nCharlie Chan actually fires his pistol in this one and for the first time is knocked unconscious via electricity. 8 minutes into the film is a nice aerial shot of San Francisco where you can see the Golden Gate Bridge under construction. And in every movie you get to see a photograph Charlie always carries around him of hs wife and 12 children lined up in a row. It's a cute picture\n\nThe DVD includes a 14 minute featurette on the history of detective fiction and a 6 minute featurette on Taiwanese native, now American forensic expert known as the Modern Day Charlie Chan\n\nOnce again,I'm quite enjoying these short films and ready for more\n\nPost by Ish Kabbible on\n\nCharlie Chan at the Circus (1936)\n\nFrom what I've read from Chan fans, I'm now watching the peak material of the Chan filmography. I don't doubt it because they continue getting better and better. Keye Luke is back adding youthful exuberence and physicality and is finally referred to as #1 son. And who dosn't love a circus setting for a movie? Filmed at a real circus using real circus performers as well. One of the circus owners is murdered and there are multiple suspects.\n\nRampaging killer ape, dancing little folks, terror on the trapeze, lions,elephants,snakes,a beautiful female contortionist (yum) and to top it all off, the whole Chan family are in this film with plenty of camera time. All 12 children.A real fun film\n\nThe DVD includes the theatrical trailer and a 25 minute featurette with some Chan experts discussing the Charlie Chan films of 1936.\n\nAs mentioned, it is said that in the 1930s the 3 most recognized movie characters around the world (non-cartoon) were Tarzan,Sherlock Holmes and Charlie Chan\n\nPost by Ish Kabbible on\n\nCharlie Chan at the Race Track (1936)\n\nCharlie's friend-a race horse owner,is allegedly killed by a kick to the head by the horse he owns. Chan's investigation has him run up against a big time gambling syndicate. Actual racing footage is included.Charlie Chan shot-man down. Charlie Chan visibly drunk in a few scenes since the director believed Warner Oland played the part at his best after drinking. A nice entry to the series, on a par with the previous. Charlie even gives you some lessons about blood spatters\n\nThe DVD includes a 20 minute feature on Keye Luke-he was also a great cartoonist,painter and of course Master Po on the Kung Fu Tv show\n\nLooking forward to the next Chan movie-it's a big one. Charlie Chan vs\n\nwww.mastromarcopugacioff.it/Articoli/SanDie/Charlie%20Chan/Charlie%20Chan%20at%20the%20Race%20Track%20(1936)% 202.jpg[/IMG]\n\nPost by Ish Kabbible on\n\nCharlie Chan at the Opera (1936)\n\nCharlie Chan vs Boris Karloff. Thats the way the movie was advertised. Gravelle (Karloff) has been in a mental institution for years having lost his memory. Then his recollections return,remembering how he was an opera singer\n\nand how is wife and her lover tried to kill him. He breaks out, seeking revenge. Murder on the opera stage. See Karloff croon. The great character actor William Demarest is also present as a tough guy sergeant who takes an instant disliking to Charlie Chan,refering to him as \"Chop Suey Chan\". A quick science lesson on how photos were transmitted in the 1930s. Karloff was in great form in this film. Whats not to like?\n\nThe DVD includes a 20 minute featurette on Director H. Bruce. Humberstone\n\nPost by Ish Kabbible on\n\nCharlie Chan at the Olympics (1937)\n\nA top secret gizmo for an airplane is stolen and the pilot is murdered. Charlie Chan tracks the clues all leading to Berlin,Germany and the Olympic Games. Chan in Der Fatherland mixing it up with a nest of international spies.\n\nHis #1 son,coincidentally, is also there, representing the USA in swimming competitions\n\nThe Charlie Chan films are at an enjoyable,consistant level of entertainment and this one adds some fascinating historical footnotes. it incorporates some short actual footage of the Olypics including the torch lighting and a Jesse Owen relay race. You also get to see Charlie ride the Hindenberg dirigible. The Berlin police assist Charlie in solving the caper and they come across as sympathetic,efficient good guys. Np mention of Hitler or the Nazi party.In fact, all swastikas, such as the ones on the Hindenberg and inside the Olympic stadium,have been blotted out in the film. Since this movie was released in May 1937, I'm not sure if the swastika removals happened during the initial run of the movie or later.\n\nEarly in the film,we are introduced to Charlie's 10 year old #3 son, an exuberant,Americanized cute kid who also wants to play detective with his pop.Its weird to hear the German inspector, after a murder, say to Charlie \"Mr. Chan,I apoligize.Things like this don't happen in Berlin\"\n\n20th Century Fox sure was cranking these films out,proving their poularity. They are being released at the rate of 4 films a year.\n\nThis DVD also includes an 11 minute featurette on Layne Tom Jr. who played Charlie's #3 son in this movie and who returned in 2 other Chan films. Layne mentions how he admired Warner Oland even if his breathe reeked of booze all the time\n\nMr. Hopkins: [offended] Well, you must think we're all fools!\n\nArthur Hughes: I'm not acquainted with the other gentlemen.\n\nPost by Ish Kabbible on\n\nCharlie Chan On Broadway (1937)\n\nAboard an ocean liner bound for New York, a lady hides her diary in Charlie Chan's luggage. She turns out to be a girlfriend of an organized crime figure exiled in Europe to avoid testifying against the mob. Now she's decided to return and sing like a canary for money. She's murdered, of course, and Charlie and son aid the NYC police to crack the case\n\nWelcome to my home city Charlie. Unfortunately there is hardly anything in the film that’s NYC related. One minute of stock footage during the opening credits, a sergeant trying to speak with a Brooklyn accent and a gossip columnist in competition with a female photographer in getting the scoop\n\nBut once again, an engaging B-movie mystery tale, fast paced, great character interplay with Charlie and son and all those wonderful Chanisms. There is an uncredited cameo by Lon Chaney Jr. and an early example of product placement with a bottle of Bayer aspirin. There is nothing about Broadway in the movie\n\nThe DVD includes a 30 minute featurette on the various title locations for the Warner Oland Charlie Chan films. Also a 5 minute featurette on Charlie's Aphorisms\n\nComing up next: The final Warner Oland Chan film\n\nPost by Ish Kabbible on\n\nCharlie Chan at Monte Carlo (1937)\n\nThe 16th and final Warner Oland Chan film.This movie was released 7 months before his death.A feud between rival financiers leads to murders and missing bonds.Warner Oland does seem a little weaker and slower than previous films as his alcoholism starts to take its toll.The movie's plot was also a bit convoluted for me to follow at times but still over-all a decent film. Charlie and son's interplay is still wonderful. Harold Huber returns,playing a NYC investigator in the previous film,he's now a French investigator for Monte Carlo.Lots of French spoken throughout the film.If I would rate the prior Chan films a 10, this one gets an 8\n\nThe DVD also includes a 17 minute featurette on the last days of Warner Oland. You also get the entire 1929 movie Behind That Curtain -an early talkie that was an adaptation of an Erle Der Biggers novel with a Charlie Chan appearance for the last 10 minutes of the film (pre Warner Oland)\n\nThe Death of Warner Oland\n\nWarner was Charlie Chan.As the years went on, he embraced the character. He would study Chinese culture and calligraphy.He would give interviews to magazines in his Charlie Chan persona. The movies were the cash cow for 20th Century Fox and Warner knew it, parlaying bigger and bigger contracts until he was making $40,000 a film. But at the same time his alcoholism was getting worse and ended his marriage of 30 years. This only caused Warner to spiral deeper. Early in 1938, one week into shooting the next Chan flick-Charlie Chan at Ringside,he excused himself,saying he needed a glass of water and disappeared. For weeks. Frantically the studio finally found him and helped nurse him back to health. To salvage the film.they reshot scences to make it a Mr.Moto (with Peter Lorre) movie, complete with Keye Luke. Fox Studios needed Warner so bad that they gave him a brand new contract for 3 more films and gave permission for him to finish his recovery in his homeland of Sweden. There he contracted bronchitis and in his weakened state, he died in August of 1938. His ex-wife brought his remains back to the US for burial. R.I.P. Warner\n\nAnd there it is, I successfully watched a Chan a day for 12 days. I very much enjoyed them.Too bad 4 movies are missing.And now comes the Sidney Toler version. Onwards"
