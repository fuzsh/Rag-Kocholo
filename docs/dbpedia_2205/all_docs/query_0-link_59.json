        "text": "Cinema is an ever-evolving medium to showcase art, talent, and lived experiences. But audiences will find that representation on the screen will be dependent on who is behind the camera.\n\nWhite filmmakers have dominated American film since its inception, but over time, artists of color have been able to step in and share their stories and voices, giving viewers a glimpse of the many ways one could be American while straddling an Asian heritage.\n\nThe road to the now-increasing number of Asian American-centered movies was not without a few bumps. Whitewashed casting and blatant anti-Asian racism were prevalent in Hollywood, from the character of Fu Manchu to John Wayne portraying Genghis Khan and Mickey Rooney's infamous performance in \"Breakfast at Tiffany's.\"\n\nWhile whitewashing hasn't completely gone away—prominent examples being \"Aloha\" in 2015 and \"Ghost in the Shell\" in 2017—the practice has gone out of fashion. Public backlash and an increased number of Asian creators on big Hollywood projects have helped turn the tide, with some actors stepping down from roles not meant for them, such as Ed Skrein exiting 2019's \"Hellboy,\" and adaptations like Netflix's \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" taking representation seriously when assembling an ensemble cast.\n\nThe result is a range of films that are authentic to Asian American experiences, showing off a mosaic of perspectives from several different cultures that have all made a home in the United States. \"When you look at these films, for a certain segment of our community, watching these films was not just notable, it was life-changing because they affirmed that they belong, because it gave them context,\" Jeff Yang, author of \"The Golden Screen: The Movies That Made Asian America,\" told the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nStories can range from retellings of an immigrant family's experience in the United States to more fantastical stories rooted in Asian history or even a hybrid of both realism and fantasy. Whatever the case, Asian-based talent is on the rise, with fare including modern action movies, streaming romantic comedies, documentaries, and prestige award-winning dramas."
