        "text": "Filtering by Category: Articles\n\nSorry, Not Sorry: Putting A Spotlight On The Twisted Entertainment Industry's Boys Club\n\nWhen I was three, I saw the Original Star Wars in the theater, and it left such an impression on me that I can still remember it to this day. That was the start of my love of film/artistry. The next two sequels cemented it.\n\nAs I grew, it became all that I wanted, and I studied a lot of theater, working in various positions for many years. I also was a natural writer, so I began learning screenwriting in my twenties.\n\nI had heard how women were treated in the film industry, well, every entertainment/artistic industry, but I knew that in my soul I wanted to create magic, somehow, some way. After modeling for a bit, I then realized what it actually meant to be a young woman in the industry.\n\nSorry/Not Sorry, directed by Cara Mones and Caroline Suh, expands on the culture of silence and misogyny that permeates entertainment, where twisted, powerful men get away with almost anything.\n\n“The Greatest Threat To Women Is Men”\n\nThe film begins with several male comedians, journalists and business owners discussing comedian Louis CK’s rise to fame. Many of them tote him as a “genius” in comedy and talk about his charisma and ability to draw an audience, as if he was some honey-tongued bard who could do no wrong.\n\nIntertwined are the experiences of comedians Jen Kirkman, Megan Koester and Abby Schachner, along with other female journalists and performers, sharing their experiences with CK, and the fallout that followed his victims when they spoke out about it.\n\nFrom the few shows of CK’s I’ve seen, he seemed to try to set himself up as a “feminist” of sorts, relaying to audiences that he was a girl dad, touting quotes as seen above, while “comically” warning audiences about the dangers of men.\n\nAt the same time, there was a disturbing and depraved dark humor, woven throughout his material, with just enough creep to make me question, does he actually believe in what he’s saying?\n\nLittle did we all know at the time, that the depravity and darkness in his shows turned out to be a live confession of who CK really was on the inside.\n\nCis Male Privilege\n\nWomen began the independent studio system around 1912 and flourished in it. Then, in the 1920’s, when men saw what a lucrative business it could be, they essentially stole it, using their existing privilege to push women out of the industry and back into homes. The men set up their own unions, and the system that we know it to be today. They created the misconception that film and business just wasn’t for women.\n\nThis culture is still alive today. Men have had so much privilege for so long, that it seems they have never had to evolve into self-awareness. As such, they are blinded to the pain and trauma caused by their, and other fellow men’s disgusting behavior.\n\nThis mentality MUST be part of the reasons that so many of the men in this documentary stick up for and are surprised to hear that CK would do stuff like this.\n\nAsk almost any woman, who isn’t also stuck in the delusional toxic masculine, and there would be no shock. We are taught to fear men from day one because of this privilege, and men like CK.\n\nQuotes such as “It’s not a crime.”, “What did he do wrong? Ask for consent for non-contact?”, “Every comedian has their skeletons (do they?), but when it comes to telling the truth about one of our own, suddenly we shut up”.\n\nDoes “one of our own” mean from the perspective of all comedians or just male comedians? As it stands, non consensual exposure and masturbation actually is a crime.\n\nBut in the entertainment business, men stick with men so often, that much of the disturbing behaviors that do happen are rarely ever told. It becomes less about what the laws say, rather than this “boys will be boys” agenda that ultimately becomes, “you tell anyone what happened and you are ruined”.\n\nWhen victims do speak up, especially women, there comes this outrageous backlash by their peers and ignorant fans, who use toxic rape culture’s baseless assumptions that she was ”just looking for money”, or was “a climber”.\n\nHush culture has been a bane to women and minorities in all sorts of business and is systematically keeping them down and silenced. The amount of privilege it takes to maintain a world and industry ruled by this culture, then feign shock about it, is very telling.\n\nAfter CK admitted that all of what his victims said was true, men still jumped to help him get back his career just nine months later.\n\nNoam Dworman, owner of The Comedy Cellar in NYC, when asked why he secretly invited CK to perform after CK admitted to his deviant behavior, states, “Everybody I know, knows people who’ve done things they should be ashamed of. The idea that you have the right to impose on a private business, who’s employing a free person to perform, in front of people who want to see him…that is where I was really drawing my line”.\n\nExcept, from what I understand, many of the people who saw CK that evening were surprised and didn’t want to see him.\n\nThis Rolling Stone article from 2018 illustrates Dworman’s evasive presentation, on why he allows people like CK and Aziz Ansari to reappear, after they have shown themselves to be predators.\n\nHe seems to shift the focus towards more of a “free speech” issue, rather than taking any responsibility for giving these known perpetrators another platform. He also seems to wash his hands of responsibility with a “what can you do?” attitude.\n\nThe writer of the Rolling Stone article, Lily Dancyger, beautifully sums up the dereliction of Dworman’s comments stating: “Customers who don’t want to condone his behavior by watching him perform aren’t objecting to the man’s art or threatening his freedom of expression. They’re objecting to the perpetuance of a culture that leaves it up to women to remove themselves from unsafe environments rather than working to make those environments safer.”\n\nWhether people choose to acknowledge it or not, if they don’t use what power they have to denounce or put a stop to deviant behavior, they are complicit in letting it continue.\n\nIN ALL HONESTY…\n\nSorry/Not Sorry is an eye opening look at just one example of the environment of toxic fear and intimidation held up by privileged men in the entertainment industry.\n\nI want to commend Megan Koester, Jen Kirkman, Abby Schachner and all of those who had the courage to come forward, knowing what this would mean for their careers, while facing hate mail, death threats and toxic ignorance on social media, to tell the truth. It is people like yourselves who are the reason that all this noxious “hush” culture can, eventually, be changed.\n\nMy heart aches for his victims, and the idea that women in entertainment must accept this behavior in order to “fit in”.\n\nKoester talks about getting out of the industry, because she no longer wants to deal with deviants and their protectors, like this. That genuinely resonated with my own hesitancy to join the industry, as an artist in film.\n\nBig entertainment runs on its own rules. There is no accountability yet on pay, racism, sexism, office politics, safety of those employed from assault, rape or other humiliating, violent behaviors of men in power.\n\nWhat Mones and Suh have done by creating this visual collage of The New York Times report, amplifies its message while giving us real faces of the people who were traumatized by CK, so they aren’t just words on a page.\n\nMake no mistake, what CK did was sexual violence. He was not sorry. He was just sorry he got caught. Regardless of “how bad” the assault was or is, does not exclude him from being a sexual predator, who should be blacklisted from the privilege of a lucrative and rare job in entertainment.\n\nCK knew it was wrong, but decided to keep doing it anyway. That was his choice, and the blame for that belongs to him and all the other enablers who continue to support him, and look the other way.\n\nThe real truth is that there are plenty of working and non working artists, in and out of the industry, that wouldn’t do what CK did. The pool of possibilities is virtually endless, so there’s no need to rehire people who deviate from professional, respectful behavior.\n\nThis film, is less a documentary, than an open discussion. The ending leaves plenty of room for all of us to think about it, look inside, and decide if we really want to choose the ethical path towards truth, or continue to stay willingly blind for money or celebrity.\n\nAs artists, we need to organize, call for more legislation over the beast that these industries have become, or come together to create our own businesses that foster real change for working artists.\n\nAs audiences we need to hold these people accountable by not giving money towards the perpetrators and the businesses who choose to look the other way.\n\nThe system as it is now, will not sustain itself. It is up to all of us, especially other men, to call this stuff out and quit punishing women for the vulgar acts of powerful men, who outright refuse to respect us and treat us as equals.\n\nTiger Stripes: The Spirit of Woman That Refuses To Be Held Down Anymore\n\nTiger Stripes is a coming of age, Malaysian film written and directed by Amanda Nell Eu. It follows protagonist Zaffan (Zafreen Zairizal), who becomes the first of her friends to get her period.\n\nWhen she is harassed, bullied and shamed by multiple family members and friends, Zaffan finds she has to figure out and navigate these changes herself.\n\ninto the jungle\n\nZaffan is an imaginative, headstrong, outgoing Malaysian 12-year-old, going to an all girls school. She and her best friends Miriam (Piqa) and Farah (Deena Ezral), spend their free time hanging out at their favorite water hole swimming, talking and playing.\n\nWhen Zaffan wakes up one night, having gotten blood on her bed, she calls to her overbearing mother Munah (June Lojong), who comes in to check, and immediately states that Zaffan is “dirty now”. Munah puts her in a shower to clean up.\n\nAs Zaffan starts changing, she gets itchy rashes, hears growling and starts seeing a “demon” woman in the trees. She begins feeling angrier and finds herself fully distracted from school and family life.\n\nMiriam and Farah start listening to and perpetuating ignorant rumors about periods, how women go crazy, smell bad and disappear into the jungle. As Zaffan’s “strange” behaviors escalate, Farah begins bullying her, calling her a slut and starts spreading nasty rumors about her around school.\n\nWith this transformation, Zaffan becomes more rebellious, not listening to the conservative and toxic patriarchic beliefs about how a woman should act, speak and dress. Instead of fearing it, as she’s conditioned to do, she slowly embraces her inner “wild” and realizes there’s freedom in it.\n\nwhat is happening here?\n\nZaffan goes camping with a group of girls from the school, training to be cadets. While camping, in the middle of the night, Zaffan hears the low growl of a tiger, then a scream from one of the other girls.\n\nShe finds out that, a girl who went on her own to pee, also saw a “demon” in the trees, and a few of the others hear things that only Zaffan could hear before.\n\nThe next day, Farah blames Zaffan for bringing the sounds and demon to the camp, even though she is no longer on her period. When getting ready to go home, the girls realize that someone is missing and head into the jungle together to find her.\n\nZaffan, with her “tiger demon” heightened senses, strays from the group as they are on the wrong track. When Zaffan finds the lost girl up in a tree, the girl states she is there so the senior girls wouldn’t make fun of her. Zaffan then realizes that it isn’t just her who is starting to change.\n\nAs the symptoms start to affect all of the girls, the village begins to question whether or not a true demon is infecting the girls, or, could it be more of a thing that needs to be learned about and celebrated?\n\nin all honesty…\n\nTiger Stripes is a hypnotic film that brings to life the stigmas against girls and women, put upon us by the poisonous patriarchy. It inspires young women to defy all of the terrible things they have been told about their bodies, and, to become their true authentic selves.\n\nZairizal shines and delights embodying Zaffan, who authentically represents the battle cry of the spirit of women. In her first movie and at such a tender age, she provides a fierce energy and presence that most performers her age would not be able to imitate.\n\nThe most beautiful part of this film was the intricately woven metaphors, subtly lingering throughout. In fact it may take a second glance to pick them all up.\n\nMy favorite was when the girls were watching a video of a tiger walking down a road, surrounded by men who eventually killed it. For me, that was a not so subtle reality that women face in the world, should we try to be free and wild amongst men.\n\nAs things are, toxic masculinity has done everything possible to keep girls and women as lesser.\n\nFrom stigmatizing our natural bodies as ugly or dirty; denial of our healthcare and lack of medical studies over the years for women’s bodies; rape; using purity and “appropriate” behavior as a goal for little girls; to making us smaller and silenced, it literally and figuratively kills us everyday.\n\nThis sort of film reminds us where women still are today, and what we should be doing to put an end to the stigmas put upon us by toxic masculinity. We were never meant to be “proper”, we were created with divine feminine fire that should be seen and celebrated all over the world.\n\nPeople with uteruses are the bringers of life, and none should be mistreated or underestimated. We need to see ourselves as the goddesses we are and deny any shred of the toxic masculine to rule us, which includes not putting one another down using the language and stereotypes of our oppressors.\n\nNo matter what we were told growing up; no matter the toxic masculine religions forced upon us say, and no matter the rules placed on our bodies, we should continue to fight for our collective freedom and inherent rights, with all of the magnificent ferociousness of tigers in cages aching to be set free.\n\nBravo to both cast and crew for bringing to light what we still need to change and illustrating through Zaffan, that our collective spirits cannot and will not be silenced any longer.\n\nSolo: An Exemplary Story About Self Love And Rediscovering Yourself\n\nDirector/Writer Sophie Dupuis brings to life a visionary story of a young up and coming drag performer. With stunning lighting and imagery, we follow a young adult as he navigates new love, old and new trauma, in a true caterpillar to butterfly tale.\n\nAt first sight\n\nSimon (Theodore Pellerin) is an up and coming star of the Montreal drag scene. When new man Olivier (Felix Maritaud) starts working at the club, the two are drawn almost instantly to each other. They begin a passionate love affair that brings a lot of happiness to them both.\n\nHis family readily embraces Olivier when Simon brings him home for the weekly family brunch, and it looks to be a relationship that could stand the test of time.\n\nSimon and Olivier start to do performances together, and, though everything seems great from the start, Olivier begins to start showing Simon his true self, filled with toxicity and lies. Simon becomes trapped in Olivier’s gaslighting, controlling world, and begins to lose himself in the process.\n\nHe begins to isolate himself from his family and friends, as he gets more deeply involved.\n\nSimon’s sister Maude (Alice Moreault), a costume designer who normally helps make Simon’s costumes, tries to talk with him about their relationship, as they are normally very close. Simon denies any problems he’s having with or due to Olivier.\n\nWhen he hears that his birth mother Claire (Anne-Marie Cadieux), a world famous opera singer, is coming back to Montreal for a visit, he is very excited.\n\nMaude, who wants nothing to do with the woman she claims abandoned them, gets upset and refuses to meet with Claire. Simon stays positive though, wanting to spend time with her and have her see one of his performances.\n\ndon’t forget your roots\n\nThings start to unravel after another rejection by Claire. Though she says that she may see his show, she leaves after five minutes of seeing him, even though he expected that they would have dinner.\n\nOlivier starts to get impossible to live with, as his cheating and gaslighting increase, and Simon finally decides that he won’t deal with it anymore. Growing tensions rise between Simon and another performer, who has cheated with Olivier, that explodes into Simon giving up drag and leaving the club.\n\nDeep within the cocoon of darkness that envelopes him, Simon goes inside to recognize and finally feel his past traumas that he hasn’t been able to reckon with before..\n\nWill Simon be able to deal with the loss of his love and take the steps to heal from his childhood, or will he succumb to this darkness, ultimately losing himself and everything he loves?\n\nIn all honesty\n\nSolo is one of the most beautiful films I’ve had the pleasure to see all year.\n\nWith gorgeous lighting and breathtaking cinematography; unwavering emotional acting and a superbly written script, this film shines with grace and glory.\n\nPellerin portrays Simon, flowing through his whirlwind of emotions, with such ease and elegance. It allows the audience to experience everything with Simon, instead of just being a simple observer.\n\nHe and Maritaud have an effortless, sensual chemistry between them that is so genuine, it sends sparks through the screen, allowing those who know that feeling, to sense it in their own skin.\n\nCinematographer Mathieu Laverdiere, creates a lush world of artistry, lighting and color that made every scene a lesson in cinematographic genius. It engulfs the audience into the film’s world, making every scene an absolute pleasure to watch.\n\nDupuis’s passion drips like sweet nectar throughout this film and everything is perfectly set up\n\nto put audiences at ease and lull us into this beautiful and sometimes heartbreaking character study.\n\nI loved that Simon is fully able to be what and who he is, and have his whole family be supporting, without a single reference of homophobia throughout.\n\nHowever, I wish Dupuis had dumped Simon’s comment about being “fat” though, as it was completely unnecessary and potentially harmful to others.\n\nI’m so tired of hearing blatant fatphobia in all forms, with its toxic white masculine, racist ideologies. It’s old, discriminatory and a lie. Just dump it altogether, filmmakers.\n\nOther than that, I highly recommend this film for its artistry and how it normalizes gay men and drag in our society, showing that those who are generally “othered”, are actually just like everyone else. We all need love, acceptance and a place to safely be, unapologetically who we are.\n\nNightwatch: Demons Are Forever: A Revisit To Horror And Trauma\n\nSerial killer Doctor Wormer (Ulf Pilgaard) is back after a 30 year hiatus from the first release, Nightwatch 1994. Nightwatch: Demon’s Are Forever is a fun and creepy reunion of the original surviving characters, and Wormer is out for revenge on those who stopped him in the first place.\n\nHistory repeats\n\nThe film begins with Emma (Fanny Leander Bornedal), daughter to Martin (Nikolaj Coster-Waldeau), the main character of the original. She is in med school and mourning the untimely suicide of her mother Kalinka (Sofie Grabol), several years past.\n\nMartin has lived with toxic PTSD since surviving Wormer’s first attack, and being more traumatized by the death of his beloved Kalinka, due to her own PTSD. Emma has grown up surrounded by tragedy and trauma, and she struggles to find steady ground to stand on.\n\nMartin is a chronic user of tranquilizers and Emma has felt invisible to him for many years. Needing to take care of money that Martin isn’t currently making, she finds out that, low and behold, the same night watch position in the morgue that Martin once had, is open again.\n\nEmma sees this opportunity as a way to figure out exactly what happened and, hopefully, give Martin and Kalinka the justice they deserve.\n\nDarkness never dies\n\nMeanwhile the local police are tracking, what they believe to be, a copycat of Dr. Wormer’s. Bent (Casper Kjaer Jensen), a local psychiatric patient is their prime suspect. On Emma’s first tour of the facility, she finds out that Wormer is in fact alive and living in the same psychiatric hospital as Bent.\n\nEmma pulls a few strings and gets help from her boyfriend, Fredrick (Alex Hogh Andersen) to get a pass into the hospital and talk to Wormer. She wants to get a video of him to prove to Martin that he has nothing to worry about anymore.\n\nWormer lives in a dark, dank room, and is supposedly blind and infirm. She confronts him, talking to him about all of the pain he has caused her family, and records for Martin how pathetic he has become.\n\nWhat she doesn’t realize, is that seeing her, brings Wormer a renewed sense of revenge and purpose, to get back at the family that put a halt to his original, twisted game plan.\n\nin all honesty…\n\nNightwatch: Demons Are Forever is a sharper and decidedly improved sequel to its predecessors.\n\nThough the writing and overall acting quality goes in and out throughout the film, Fanny Leander Bornedal’s exemplary performance is what saves it from being downright silly and falling into total mediocrity. For as young as she is, she pilots like a seasoned pro.\n\nShe plays an astute, intelligent and resolute Emma, who never wavers at any point in her performance.\n\nThe nostalgia brought on by the many past characters who show up throughout the film, brings an element of fun amidst the background of darkness and death.\n\nJensen shines as Bent, with a Joker-esque feel the likes of Cameron Monaghan’s Jeremiah Valeska, mixed with Anthony Carrigan’s Victor Zsaz, in the Gotham television series.\n\nIt was hard for me, while watching, to tell whether or not I thought it was a solid, scary film, or a thriller one might see on daytime television.\n\nA lot of the writing is silly and sits on the border of contrivance, but the strong performances and coming together of the old characters do help sew the film together with tighter seams.\n\nThough this film is proclaimed to be able to stand on its own without having seen the first, I think the audience would miss a lot of the nuances and character background by not seeing the it.\n\nIt isn’t Coster-Waldeau’s most solid performance, but he manages to find areas of painful fear, playing a man who is lost in a traumatized world. I think the way that Martin is written also didn’t leave him a lot to expand upon.\n\nThere are a couple decent twists that keep things interesting, and the setup does pretty well preparing us for them, it just felt like there was more to flesh out. Instead, the filmmakers chose a more formulaic approach, rather than attempting to make it truly stand out.\n\nOverall, it’s an entertaining film that horror enthusiasts may like, if they don’t go into it with high expectations. Bornedal’s stand out performance is well worth a look.\n\nPure O: A Problematic Film That Does Too Much Talking and Not Enough Showing\n\nPure O, written and directed by Dillon Tucker, is a story of a man who is supposedly suffering from a certain spectrum of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD).\n\nInspired by Tucker’s own struggles, the film feels like a head patting, feel good show, that doesn’t even begin to touch the surface of the depth of its crippling problems\n\nQuick diagnosis\n\nCooper (Daniel Dorr), is an addiction counselor who has been in a relationship with his girlfriend Emily (Hope Lauren) for eight years. They have come to the point of getting engaged and are mapping out possibilities for their life.\n\nCooper gets, what seems like, a one session diagnosis of OCD, a purely obsessional type that tends to present itself mentally only, and is sent to see a specialist (Candice Renee), to start treatment.\n\nShe too knows all the answers about Cooper’s situation ahead of time, and what he has without barely even talking to him. She spouts long winded definitions without having tested him whatsoever.\n\nMeanwhile, Cooper’s life starts to slowly fall apart, starting with the loss of a screenwriting job. The OCD doesn’t seem to trouble him much at all, with the one exception of an intrusive thought about causing harm to his girlfriend.\n\nHe starts group therapy, with Rodney (Clint James), Liz (Casey Vandeventer) and Jake (Chuck Arjavac), who are dutifully assigned different types of OCD, which they also define for the audience.\n\nNo one seems particularly fussed about their issues, and it’s like the actors are there just to embody a diagnosis and nothing else. They jovially joke about their issues and laugh, rather than share any feelings of shame, depression or anxiety.\n\nLife happens\n\nCooper’s life starts to take a turn for the worse when Emily’s stepfather gets terminal cancer and she gets unexpectedly pregnant.\n\nNeither Emily or Cooper are ready for the pregnancy. Though they try to make it a good thing at first, eventually the discussion of abortion comes up. With any other person, even without OCD, both of these life stressors can become extremely upsetting and change the lives of those going through it.\n\nNot only would you have to help your partner manage the loss of a father figure, but navigating the decision about ending a pregnancy can be traumatizing, especially for the person with the uterus.\n\nSomehow Cooper manages to keep his OCD thoughts and anxieties at a low simmer while handling these problems, AND living with the stress of working with addicts. For most people with OCD, life problems only increase their symptoms and some shut down completely from issues much lighter than these.\n\nin all honesty…\n\nPure O aspires to be a primer for those who know nothing about OCD, but refuses to show the realities of the disorder. It spends way too much time talking about definitions and focusing on Cooper’s outside problems, without allowing us to see what’s really going on inside.\n\nDefinitions don’t connect an audience nor help them get a feel of what OCD is or what it does. Screenwriting is supposed to show, more than tell what any character is going through, so the audience can have perspective and an experience with them.\n\nWe see Cooper triggered by a couple of things, like chopping vegetables near his girlfriend, but none of his thoughts or how they are affecting him are explored with more than a couple of words. When Cooper gets upset, there’s no information for us to understand what or why it’s so distressing to him.\n\nAs someone who has worked in mental health for decades and lives with a loved one with OCD, this film fails audiences on almost all levels. Though everyone’s experience is different, OCD can be especially disabling, wreck relationships, cause incredible stress on families, interfere with daily activities and make some unable to work a job or function sexually.\n\nThe anxiety caused by OCD can get so terrible that it is all consuming. The film states that, unlike the stereotype, not all OCD presents as obsessive cleaning and rituals, which is true. However, it glazes over just how bad the reality can actually get.\n\nIn the 5th version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-V), which trained therapists use to diagnose patients, it is no longer considered an anxiety disorder, rather, it’s in its own category called “Obsessive Compulsive and Related Disorders”.\n\nAnxiety is just one of the symptoms that presents in OCD, but this kind of anxiety is taken to a severe extreme, that can present with breathtaking fears due to the lack of control people living with this feel. No one really knows yet how it happens, but genetics and past trauma are a couple of theories.\n\nThe danger that can happen when an audience isn’t able to connect with a character in this sort of film, is that they can walk away with a skewed perspective of the problems and its repercussions.\n\nThe filmmaker’s decision to make this all about Cooper’s outside life, versus spending more time with his inner experiences, sets an irresponsible, ableist view about OCD. It makes it seems like all a person has to do is go get diagnosed and have one or two sessions with facing their fears, and they’re miraculously healed.\n\nThe reality is a nightmare. OCD looks a lot like many other types of disorders, and it takes time and in depth neurologic and psychiatric testing to diagnose. Absolutely no competent therapist would ever diagnose it after one or two sessions, nor would they allow a client to put a real knife to someone’s throat, within the confines of treatment.\n\nCooper probably wouldn’t have the capacity to care for people with addictions. Addicts have a whole host of different problems and needs that require a level of stability by their caretakers and counselors, that most people living with OCD wouldn’t be able to meet. The idea that an addict would have a life altering breakthrough moment from one of Cooper’s insights about himself, is ludicrous.\n\nI really wanted to support the idea of the film, but its reality is far too limited in scope and depicts OCD as an alarmingly easy to deal with disorder. It felt like a Lifetime Television version of a mental health issue, where everything is tidily fixed, and is wrapped up with a smiley sticker at the end.\n\nThat sort of depiction is seriously disrespectful to the many others who suffer with these devastating conditions, and misinforms with its toxically naive, light hearted portrayal.\n\nPeople living with this condition deserve much better.\n\nThe Coffee Table: Be Careful What You Wish For\n\nThe Coffee Table, directed by Caye Casas and written by Casas and Cristina Borobia, is a lesson of sorts for when ego gets the best of us and the consequences of having to be right.\n\nJesus (David Pareja) and Maria (Estefania de los Santos) are a couple on the edge of a break up, who incessantly argue and take toxic swipes at each other. While they are out shopping for a coffee table for their apartment, the fighting escalates and each of them spend the whole time seeing who can be nastiest.\n\nThe egos that they both live in become a centerpiece of the film, that causes a horrifying event that neither can take back.\n\nIs It really worth it?\n\nJesus and Maria stand before a coffee table, gilded in faux gold with a glass top. It’s really a cheesy, cheap looking table that looks like it belongs in Trump Tower and simply isn’t worth the price.\n\nThe salesman (Eduardo Antuna), is the picturesque representation of the comedic extreme, giving a wholly false presentation of the table that the company who made it would praise him for. He sustains a rigorous amount of pressure, challenging Juan’s toxic masculine side, encouraging him to stand up for what he wants, no matter what his partner says.\n\nMaria is equally toxic and super controlling. She says anything she wants to him, no matter how hurtful it is and Jesus takes corresponding nips at her, even to the likes of telling her that their newborn son was, essentially her fault and that he didn’t really want kids.\n\nJesus, fed up with her domination, man spreads his way into buying the table, and, in his eyes, settling the score between them.\n\nHis stubbornness manifests a nightmare that no one sees coming.\n\nPride Goeth before a literal fall\n\nWhen they return home with the table, Maria heads to the grocery store alone to prepare for a dinner with Jesus’s brother Carlos (Josep Maria Riera) and his new girlfriend Cristina (Claudia Riera), later that evening.\n\nWhat ensues in the apartment while she is away, is a nightmare of epic proportions, sending Jesus into a downward spiral of shock, shame and unbearable guilt.\n\nHe spends the rest of the film trying to keep the devastating secret to himself, that, inevitably rocks him and the people around him to the core.\n\nin all honesty…\n\nThe Coffee Table is one of the best psychological horrors that I’ve seen in a very long time.\n\nThe inciting incident that happens early on in the film literally made me gasp and cover my mouth in utter surprise. Though the incident is full of devastation, it also creates a lot space for the film to explore the human psyche and leaves audiences to draw upon its powerful metaphors.\n\nThe particular harshness of this incident, when looked at as a consequence of ego, is most extreme, but works within the confines of a brutal tale. Though there is no fantasy involved, it still harkened memories of old, dark fairy tales and stories of the macabre I read as a child.\n\nWith Poe-esque madness, the tension in the film is a masterclass of story building that won’t let you go even after the end of the film. It stands among the best films of all time for its unrelenting grip. The audience is wrapped up with Jesus and we feel all of the film’s tragic mercilessness with him, whether we want to or not.\n\nI can understand my critic colleagues when they recoil from recommending this, as it has the potential to trigger a very specific group of people, but as a horror fan, I really think that not recommending it is also a tragedy.\n\nIt has the power to teach us how horrifyingly dark our egos can get, when we try to selfishly overpower one another and don’t allow a truce in order to heal our wounds, and truly see each other.\n\nSo simplistic, so surreal and yet violently authentic, it is a breathtaking, all consuming ride into just how far darkness can consume us, both literally and figuratively. It is an unrelenting nightmare that viewers won’t be able forget.\n\nAgainst All Enemies: A Battle Cry For Help\n\nAgainst All Enemies is a new documentary directed by Charlie Sadoff that explores the origins of hate groups in America, and why so many veterans become parts of them. With a plethora of information and across the political spectrum insights, this is a documentary that should be paid close attention to as it shows us much that needs to be healed in this country.\n\nwhy are we so far from uniity?\n\nThe film focuses on the rise of extremist, right wing political groups the likes of The Proud Boys and Q Anon, and those who stormed the US Capitol on January 6th, 2021.\n\nWith the aid of former veterans both in the political arena and out, Sadoff explores these extremist groups from their leaders, their recruiting sites, their grooming of lost veterans and the misinformation that they spread.\n\nThese groups hail from a long history of white supremacy, racism, and other white nationalist groups like the Ku Klux Klan, in an intricate web of lies and deception. They feed off of fear, insecurity, low education and conspiracy theories.\n\nUsing these fears and insecurities, others who want power see opportunities for success in the political arena, and create platforms that feed into them. Trump, of course, is the biggest con artist of the myriad of politicians, who spread misinformation in order to incite violent action, to realize his own dream of fascism and dictatorship, which isn’t surprising, as his own father was in the KKK.\n\nTrump’s followers in the senate and other government positions continue to do whatever they can to push the white, cis, hetero normative, including banning books, not allowing LGBTQ+ to be seen, heard or protected, abolishing the right to choose, gerrymandering and suppression of voting for black and brown communities.\n\nWith the unbelievable amount of poisonous lies, these people continue to have strong platforms to keep spreading their malcontent because no one is taking them to task.\n\nwhy recruit veterans?\n\nAccording to the film, these sorts of extremist groups purposely focus on our vets. They need people who are armed/know how to use weapons, have an undeniably twisted sense of patriotism and who are most susceptible to radicalization, for a sense of purpose, belonging and “family”.\n\nThe leaders tend to all be white men, educated at white, bought-in, “elite” schools, who know the law, but are generally amoral and use it to their advantages.\n\nAs I’ve seen, with a hearty history of mental health education and counseling experience, US Veterans are not taken care of. Most of the men going into the military are young and inexperienced, who come home from political wars with PTSD and all kinds of other mental health needs, only to be shutdown and not cared for by our government for their service.\n\nTake a group of people who have been traumatized; initiated by violence and war, then left to their own devices and not slowly reintegrated back to normal society coming home; add guns to the mixture and you’ve got an explosive concoction of vitriol, misdirected pain and the need for relevance.\n\nIt’s become astonishingly difficult to know who we can trust in politics and our daily lives and many inadvertently fall victim to those who con.\n\nin all honesty…\n\nSadoff has given us such an abundance of information packed into one film that it’s hard to know where to start.\n\nWe have had a crisis of military mental health since the beginning of military history. As a supporter of our troops, I have seen the toll that war takes on them. I’ve also seen a lot of people who get denied treatment from the government programs, such as the VA, that have promised to take care of them and their families.\n\nWhat makes me most angry about this subject are the rich people who continue to use and exploit them as pawns, knowing full well that they would never do the job themselves nor expect their children to go to war.\n\nThe indoctrination involved, also explained in the movie, is sickening. More laws against disinformation and the online presence of these extremist predators need to be made before anything. There’s nothing “constitutional” about conning others and creating violence against other groups of people through hatred. We have laws against hate speech so why not online?\n\nSadoff also has a section comparing Isis with the domestic US extremist groups. Though they have many similarities, the US doesn’t crack down on the groups here like overseas, most likely because our perps are white.\n\nThe biggest threat to our democracy are cons like Trump and those who support him. I don’t know what hold he has over his supporters, but I do know that all he cares about is becoming an all powerful dictator. He has literally said it before and praised dictators across the world.\n\nHe is using Hitler’s words and tactics in his speeches trying to convince his supporters that dictators aren’t\n\n”so bad”, and many of his political pawns are now in jail. Trump himself has almost 100 charges against him for fraud, sexual assault and mishandling of classified government documents. What else will it take to convince his supporters? It’s so blatant it’s frightening.\n\nAbsolutely zero legitimate presidents have ever had so many lawsuits against them in US history. Is racism so powerful that many citizens would vote for someone who is showing you who they are? It’s all “Fake News” unless Trump agrees with it.\n\nThe battle of “wokeness” is also being manipulated by the same MAGA politicians to mean something ugly, when it’s literally just being awakened to all of the injustices of our world. When we are able to see with more clarity, we are better able to fix the problems around us. Why would anyone want to stay “asleep”?\n\nOur political system on both sides is rigged for the super wealthy only and needs to be overhauled, no question. Replacing this with fascist, hate filled politicians and rhetoric would be epically worse than what we have now, and there is a real possibility that the US could be walking itself ignorantly and apathetically into it.\n\nAgainst All Enemies brings us a multifaceted buffet of the problems at hand, asking its audience to come up with answers that most of us don’t have the knowledge or power to answer. There is little here to keep us hopeful.\n\nTrump’s presidency has left America with multiple questions regarding legality and how to handle a corrupt president. We need to come together and demand from our elected officials that laws to protect our democracy are vitally needed now.\n\nThe rise of authoritarianism is a real threat that needs real answers and effective measures taken against it. I personally am less afraid of a second Civil War, as mentioned in the film, than Trump getting the chance to change more of the government to his liking than he already has.\n\nWe’ve been there historically in the 1940’s and fought against it. Where is that same enthusiasm now? Why haven’t we learned?\n\nThose of us who are awakened have an obligation to fight the rise of fascism with our votes and help those who can’t see clearly to wake up and find the clarity they need.\n\nFighting each other will only keep us divided without the ability to break from our self created gridlock and allow fascists to slip in in the meantime.\n\nDo we continue to support and uphold the rubbish sold to us by the 1% and toxic capitalism, or will we have the courage to do the tough work of our own healing, and demand in large numbers that this non-sustainable society, hatred and malfeasance be banished for good?\n\nThe choice is ours. Vote like your lives depend on it, because they very well may.\n\nFemme: A Dangerously Toxic Film\n\nTrigger Warning! Mild talk of sexual assault\n\nFemme is the debut feature by writer/directors Sam H. Freeman and Ng Choon Ping. Based upon their short with the same name, the film explores the seriously dark sides of two men who are both deeply traumatized by the toxic masculine and acting upon deep seated fear.\n\nWith powerful performances by leads George MacKay (Preston) and Nathan Stewart-Jarrett (Jules), the film wanders down an exceedingly dark path where both characters become equally loathsome with zero redemption at the end.\n\nLost\n\nJules works as a drag queen in a hopping queer club in London. One night, when he is outside on a smoke break, he notices that he is out of cigarettes and walks to a corner shop to get more. While in there, Preston and his group of friends come in.\n\nPreston notices Jules and seems very struck by him. As the friends notice that Jules is in drag, the homophobic inferences towards Jules begin. Though Jules tries to ignore it at first, he decides to come back at Preston in an attempt to put him in his place.\n\nDue to Preston’s extreme homophobia he, of course, has to slather his toxic masculine all over Jules because he’s so insecure about his own homosexuality. Preston follows Jules outside and brutally attacks him.\n\nJules’s life is turned on its head and he is unable to continue working.\n\nthe dregs\n\nLater, Jules is relaxing at a gay bathhouse when he notices Preston is there, loudly shaming another man for hitting on him. Jules follows him into the locker room and notices that his locker is right next to Preston’s. Somehow not recognizing Jules out of drag, Preston eyes him up, and on his way out demands Jules follow him.\n\nWhen Jules finds him outside, he gets in Preston’s car and they drive off together to have sex at Preston’s apartment. Preston continues to be demanding, wanting Jules to follow behind him so no one sees them together.\n\nThey start the process of their noxious affair, but are interrupted when Preston’s friends let themselves in to the apartment. Preston introduces Jules as his “mate” to his friends, which continues down a closeted, pernicious, rabbit hole of obsessive darkness.\n\nJules, plotting his “revenge”, watches toxic, gay, outing porn sites. He pursues the idea of getting a video of them having sex, to out and humiliate Preston, thinking that this will somehow make him feel better.\n\nFor the rest of the show it becomes a shame inducing cesspool that consistently humiliates only Jules.\n\nIn all honesty…\n\nFemme is a mephitic story of two seriously unstable characters, who choose to go down the path of darkness and destruction into a toxic relationship of epic proportions.\n\nWith beautiful lighting and cinematography, we see two human beings on opposite sides of the toxic masculine. Preston, who most likely was traumatized by the straight normative, is a beastly man with hardly any feelings or remorse, and when threatened, lashes out like the wounded animal he is.\n\nJules on the other hand is clearly out and open about his homosexuality and challenging gender norms, but in seeking revenge in a way that will traumatize him more, he too falls into an inescapable darkness that he cannot be redeemed from.\n\nAs a member of the LGBTQ+ community, I found this film extremely disturbing. Not only for the homophobic brutality inflicted by Preston, but mostly by the way Jules counters his attacker with a revoltingly submissive catharsis of degradation I’ve not yet seen the likes of.\n\nThe filmmakers chose a path for Jules that made him almost equally as culpable as Preston, in the sense that he would go so far as to knowingly out someone, who is unaware, in a despicable public arena and disgrace himself by willingly having sex with, and becoming attracted to his attacker.\n\nThere is nothing redeeming about this film, as the two characters walk the line of psychosis, attempting to find their way through their darkness using more darkness. They couldn’t be more blind and unaware.\n\nThere is nothing thrilling, erotic or sexy about the story, only more and more malignant behaviors until the final scene where no one has changed or learned anything.\n\nJules is a physically larger and stronger bodied person who couldn’t be bested by Preston in any way unless he allowed it. At one point Jules does try to overpower Preston, which I thought might be a chance for his redemption, but instead he continues to be the shivering submissive every time Preston shouts.\n\nThough I wanted to root for Jules, the lengths he goes to in humiliating himself casts a horrible shadow of rape culture as well. Jules may not have been physically raped in Preston’s first attack, but it felt like he got physically and emotionally raped over and over again every time he continued to go back to him.\n\nMake no mistake, there is zero presence of real love here in either man, personally or together.\n\nNone of the craft behind or on scene can save this repulsive tale. It takes the LGBTQ+ community’s struggles for equality, advancement and humanity, and basically vomits on it. It also leaves LGBTQ+ people open for more ways that the ignorant can judge and revile us more, should they choose to generalize us by these characters.\n\nWith no justice, no growth in the characters, no redeemable qualities in either, it’s just a graphic ick fest of mental illness gone exceedingly wrong, with queer characters who both need years of serious therapy, and in Preston’s case, jail time.\n\nThey could have chosen an endless number of ways for Jules to get justice that would’ve been far more clever and interesting, instead, they lead him down this path of indignity and willful destruction.\n\nThere are, most decidedly, much better queer films to choose to spend your time on. No need to waste your time here in the dark.\n\nThe Taste of Things: A Gorgeous Celebration of the Art of Cooking and Love\n\nThe Taste of Things, starring Juliette Binoche (Eugenie) and her real life ex, Benoit Magimel (Dodin Bouffant), is a story of a celebrity chef and his cook, that have worked together and been lovers for 20 years. Directed by Ahn Hung Tran, the story is set in 1889 France in Dodin’s beautiful manor home, where both he and Eugenie spend nearly every moment creating culinary art in his rustic kitchen.\n\nthe perfect mix\n\nWhen the film opens we see a breathtaking montage of Eugenie, Dodin and their helpers creating a feast for the dinner party that Dodin is hosting for his closest friends. It delves into the hard work, knowledge and craft that professional chefs endure to manifest the most exquisite sensorial, palate pleasing experience.\n\nIt is clear that Eugenie and Dodin are masters of the kitchen and amazing teachers to Violette (Galatea Bellugi), the housemaid and her young niece Pauline (Bonnie Chagneau-Ravoire), who may very well be a natural savant in the kitchen . Director Anh Hung Tran and crew, create an effortless looking scene that flows back and forth and doesn’t miss a beat.\n\nAs the film continues, we learn that Eugenie and Dodin’s relationship is deeper than it appears. Dodin has spent many years asking Eugenie to marry him, but she denies him every time saying that she retains more independence and decision making by staying single. which, in that time, definitely holds true.\n\nWhen Dodin gets the invitation of a lifetime to dine and then cook for a Prince, everyone is over the moon. Unfortunately Eugenie hides an illness that is causing her pain and may interfere with their work and their relationship.\n\nWhen Eugenie refuses his hand in marriage yet again, he decides to create a meal especially for her, using all of the right ingredients to impress her, in the hopes that she will finally accept him.\n\nin all honesty…\n\nThe Taste of Things, even though lighter on story, is an exquisite film celebrating art, love and cooking.\n\nIt was fascinating watching the creation of all their dishes especially while using less culinary technology than we have today. Everything was done with equal parts perfectionism and love. It was a time when our quick cooking gadgets weren’t available and the beauty in taking one’s time to make everything from scratch.\n\nDodin has his own garden in his back yard and everyone uses only the freshest ingredients, sourced locally and from far away. The richness of this tradition is far lost on society today where the mentality is “faster is better”. No chain restaurants today come anywhere near the wholeness and the sublime natural ingredients done in days past.\n\nJuliette Binoche is beautiful as always, and such a perfect addition to this film.\n\nHer Eugenie is earnestly devoted to craft and is earnestly independent from the rules of the patriarchy and being “owned” by a husband. Though you can see that she loves Dodin, she does it through the perspective of clarity, knowing exactly who she is and what she wants to do.\n\nDodin is naturally drawn to her because of her self respect and how different she is than most women. Eugenie does what she can to remain useful and also keep the mood light surrounding her unfortunate mystery illness. Binoche herself has never married and I find that remarkably admirable.\n\nThe sets and production design are impeccable and the flow of the moving shots sets you under a spell of sorts as it takes you dancing across the screen. The rustic kitchen was absolutely stunning and I enjoyed every second of being in it.\n\nCouple that with breathtaking countryside cinematography from Jonathan Ricquebourg and you’ve got a recipe for a moving symphony.\n\nI do wish that there was more to the story regarding Dodin and Eugenie’s relationship. As it is, we only get to see some rather topical events that happen between them, but it is impossible not to love the film and its characters.\n\nIt’s a refreshingly delightful replacement to all of the loud CGI debacles out there now and I highly recommend it to those who want to watch true artistry in motion.\n\nSpaceman: A Film That Promises So Much More, But Doesn't Deliver\n\nSpaceman is a new SciFi film, starring Adam Sandler (Jakub Prochazka), about an astronaut who has left behind his pregnant partner Lenka (Carey Mulligan), to take a year long space odyssey to study a strange phenomena in the sky called the “Chopra cloud”,\n\nThough I believe this film had good intentions of being something mind blowing, we instead get served up uninspiring, already done subjects and a protagonist who didn’t need a space odyssey to get the answers he needed.\n\nOn the rocks\n\nJakub is an ordinary self centered man who has spent most of his life trying to recover from his abusive father, and running away from his wife Lenka, and her love for him.\n\nThings were already on the rocks for Jakub and Lenka before he goes on this isolative trip, so the trip becomes an even greater wedge between them. Jakub is very self involved and focuses only on what he is currently doing, whilst ignoring and taking for granted the supposed love of his life.\n\nWhen the film opens, we see Lenka send a message to Jakub in space regarding the fact that she has decided to leave him, because she can no longer wait for him to get his head out of his ass. As the film continues, we see that this trip is just the straw that broke the camel’s back.\n\nMission Control won’t allow him to see this message as they don’t want to ruin the mission nor Jakub’s already deteriorating mental health, so they make a plea to Lenka to communicate with Jakub as though she is still waiting for him.\n\nLenka refuses and moves back with her mother.\n\nSkinny human\n\nWhile on his journey, Jakub meets an ancient alien, a giant space spider later known as Hanus (Paul Dano). Hanus apparently comes to Jakub as he is floating through space. He finds Jakub interesting for some reason, and decides to board his ship to study him up close.\n\nThough he knows that Jakub is a human, he apparently doesn’t know anything about humans, though he has the power to access Jakub’s thoughts, feelings and his past. As the film progresses, Hanus becomes a mentor and a friend to Jakub within space’s cold, isolative blackness.\n\nHanus condemns and forces Jakub to confront his past behavior, giving him the opportunity to change his ways for a chance at redemption with Lenka.\n\nin all honesty…\n\nSpaceman is a well dressed, fantastical idea that fizzles out horribly by the end.\n\nThere were so many moments missed to show more depth, perspective, soul growth, personal growth, and the reasons why this couple and the protagonist are special enough to deserve a story about them. It’s an utter failure in character development, background and story telling.\n\nIt felt like a very expensive way to tell a yet another story about why cishet men believe that they can be wholly self centered, treat a woman like crap, and still believe they deserve another chance for forgiveness. The worst part is cishet men’s ability to believe that a woman and their kids should wait around for them. It’s a fantasy that has been woven into the fabric of storytelling for centuries.\n\nWe have seen countless stories in the past with the same themes, from The Godfather’s, Scorsese’s mob films, to Interstellar, with the message that no matter how self centered, narcissistic, or mentally ill a cishet man is, their families and their wives should accept all kinds of abuse, abandonment, emotional and mental gaslighting, sexism and second classism to “stick with their man”.\n\nThey weren’t even able to show us why Jakub deserves a second chance to begin with.\n\nIt’s also extremely far fetched that any space research facility is going to invest in someone close to their sixties, to enter into the rigors of space travel for a mission that is so important for them, for a week, let alone a year. At the same time we are meant to believe that a woman twenty years his junior is going to wait for him, when the relationship shown hasn’t been anything special to begin with.\n\nHanus is also an alien species that has been around from the beginning of time, who knows what humans are, has special empathic abilities, but doesn’t know anything about them or how they work. It is also drawn in by Jakub, who also isn’t really anything special in character. There is no way that a being who has lived since the beginning of time doesn’t know about humans and everything else already.\n\nBy the end it becomes clear that this alien, only has the most basic of truths to share with Jakub and helps him come to a conclusion that could’ve easily been drawn through some lesser happenings on Earth. If it takes six months in space and an alien to make Jakub come to the conclusion that he’s been an idiot, why is the story centered on him?\n\nI was really hoping for something mind blowing at the end for all of the things that Jakub goes through, but even an ancient space spider turns out to be something too close to humanity to be believed as a wise, all knowing being.\n\nHanus even becomes angry and threatening at one point, which would happen only if he was living with duality, and lived within the confines of unawakened humanity, with a life spent focusing only on the tiny, individualistic bubbles of life in front of them.\n\nThe filmmakers likened Hanus to be something of a Yoda character from Star Wars, yet Yoda, who was only 900 years old, knew way more about spirituality and life truths than Hanus. Yoda’s metaphorical knowledge still holds true today.\n\nMulligan, who I love in almost everything, had nothing to work with in Lenka’s character whatsoever. Even the reasons presented of why Lenka loves Jakub and sticks by him aren’t enough to warrant an actor of her caliber. The only reason I heard uttered from Lenka’s mouth through the whole film, about why their relationship is special was a really good first kiss.\n\nThe musical score, space design and Dano’s performance created a beautiful symphony of ethereal peace throughout the film, there are just far too many unanswered questions, underdeveloped characters with nothing special about them, and super far fetched situations for this film to work.\n\nThe Boy and The Heron: A Sumptuous Journey Through the Mind of an Animation Master\n\nThe Boy and The Heron, written and directed by the legendary Hayao Miyazaki, is a fantastical tale of a boy grieving the loss of his mother, who is lead into a journey about the pain of life and figuring out who he is after it.\n\nWith similarities to some of Miyazaki’s other films, this one dives into a literal realm of existentialism where the boy must choose to leave behind his broken past, push through his pain, and grow into who he is becoming.\n\nHeed the call\n\nThe film starts in WWII Japan, where a young Mahito (Luca Padovan) is terrorized by the bombing of his village.\n\nWhile being pulled to safety by his father Shoichi (Christian Bale), Mahito breaks free to run and get his mother, who is away in another part of the village. When he gets there, the building where she was, is set ablaze and Mahito can’t save her.\n\nFast forward a couple years later, and Shoichi has remarried his deceased wife’s younger sister, Natsuko (Gemma Chan), who is now pregnant with Mahito’s new sibling. Having moved to his family’s estate in the country, Mahito must adjust to a new town and school.\n\nThe children at school are less than welcoming, and Mahito finds himself the target of bullying. He ends up taking a rock and hitting himself in the head in order not to go back to school. As he explores the new grounds, he comes across a big, ugly heron (Robert Pattinson) that leads him to a mysterious tower.\n\nHe asks his caretakers, a gaggle of comical “grannies”, Aiko (Barbara Goodson), Izumi (Denise Pickering), Eriko (Melora Harte), Utako (Barbara Rosenblat), Oyuki (Nika Futterman) and Kazuko (Debi Derryberry), about the tower.\n\nThey all discourage him to go and tell him to leave the place alone, as his Granduncle (Mark Hamill), also disappeared there long ago.\n\nBut the Heron persists in getting Mahito’s attention, at one point telling him to come “save her”, in reference to his mother. When his stepmother disappears, Mahito takes it upon himself to rescue her so that he doesn’t lose another mother again.\n\nthe other side\n\nThe Heron leads him into the tower that is full of magic and mystery. They are sent into a world “beneath” their own, where everything looks like Earth, but is always a bit unsettlingly off. A sailor called Kiriko (Florence Pugh) leads him to a massive structure that is another world within this world.\n\nThere he is taken further into the search for his stepmother, in an ethereal realm with all kinds of strange creatures, those who would be helpful and some that are not. He begins to explore more of his family’s past there, where he also figures out what happened to his Granduncle.\n\nWithin that, Mahito is forced to make an important choice that will decide not only his fate, but the fate of his lineage and the world “beneath”.\n\nIn all honesty…\n\nThe Boy And the Heron is a spectacular vision of creativity, humanity and the unsettling duality of pain and grief.\n\nApparently semi-autobiographical, Miyazaki, in his final film, pays homage to his experiences as a young boy growing up in a time of war, and the heart-wrenching end of childhood innocence after the loss of his mother.\n\nHis mother and the war have been depicted in many of his past films, showing up in a lot of the lead females he has written. He remembers her so fondly and she is said to be one of his greatest influences in his creative work and life.\n\nThis film delves into the “whys” that I think a lot of humans think about when bad things happen and when we wish life could be easier. The duality within us is something that we all share while on our Earthly journeys, some of us choosing to live within the light, and others of us who choose to live within the dark.\n\nIt is a deep question that has haunted humanity since the beginning of our time here, and will continue to follow us in the never ending circle called life on Earth.\n\nMiyazaki uses beautiful and strange imagery to create a moving, vivid metaphor for life, and demonstrates the necessity for pain and loss. We find that only through pain can we grow and change, which couldn’t happen if life was always easy.\n\nThe filmmakers do an excellent job of creating a world that is palpably beautiful and peaceful, with an unsettling feeling that things are not quite right.\n\nThough one could argue that this particular film may not be his best, it is nonetheless still destined to be a classic and an elegant closure to the legacy that this master of animation leaves with us.\n\nStudio Ghibli has a look and a feeling that is truly one of a kind, no matter who may try to recreate it. Whatever the situation its protagonists find themselves in, there is always a feeling of hope, grandiosity, and a side of the startlingly bizarre, created with so much heart, love and extraordinary artistry.\n\nI always enjoy his tiny side creatures the most. From the soot sprites of Spirited Away to the Wata Wata’s in this film, it always adds a dimension of the adorable and brings to life minor things most of us would never even think of.\n\nWhat a ride Miyazaki has brought to the lives of so many people and what an incredible life he has led. He is a true master of animation and storytelling, and so blessed to have been one of the privileged few who have been able to share his work on such a grand scale with the rest of the world.\n\nHis legacy will persist and live to inspire for countless years to come. Bravo sir!\n\n1946: The Mistranslation That Shifted Culture; A Critical Find to Ending Homophobia in Religion\n\n1946: The Mistranslation that Shifted Culture, directed by Sharon “Rocky” Reggio and written by Jena Serbu and Jill Woodward, is an eye-opening new documentary surrounding the, not so long, history of blatant homophobia in certain sects of Christianity.\n\nReggio directs and stars in this compelling, very persuasive and heart-breaking story, featuring her pastor father, Salvatore Reggio, who is a literalist of a bible that was never created to be a true translation.\n\nDigging in\n\nWhen Sharon Reggio heard that there was research being done about when and why certain bibles used the specific word “homosexual” in regards to behaviors demonized by some Christian religions, she jumped at the chance to create a documentary about it.\n\nIdentifying as queer herself, the documentary digs into the vast history on bible translation and she also tries to come to terms with her literalist father, who believes that the book he has is the literal word of God, and says there isn’t any way he will believe differently.\n\nShe teams up with Kathy Baldock, a straight Christian woman who became a fierce advocate for LGBTQ people after finding out all this information, and Ed Oxford, a gay Christian man who went to seminary when he was younger, but felt as a gay man he had no place in Christianity.\n\nTogether, with a collective of religious scholars, linguists, and opposing pastors, they try to figure out why the word “homosexual” was written in a translation of a bible starting in 1946 and beyond.\n\nWho gets to change Words from an antiquated book?\n\nThis is who. A group of old, white, cis men.\n\nThese men agreed that the word homosexuality should be added to the Revised Standard Version of the Bible after a devastating mistranslation, sparking a cataclysmic “religious” war against the LGBTQ community.\n\nThe translation was challenged, but they couldn’t revise it again until 1971, due to a contract they signed. Subsequent translations chose to continue with the flawed translation, not knowing that the first group had already met to change it.\n\nThe biggest of the revised copies was The Living Bible, written by a man who was a salesman, not a scholar, who wanted a paraphrased version of the Revised Standard Version, so he could teach it to his children.\n\nA copy of that version was later given to Billy Graham and he then started teaching it to his constituents in his revivals, which brought to life a slew of other conservative pastors, like Jerry Fallwell, who also put it into their “teachings”.\n\nSo a paraphrased book, not written by scholars, caught on like wildfire putting out a barrage of misinformation, bringing on more hatred and devastation to the LGBTQ community.\n\nin all honesty…\n\nThis is truly a one of a kind film that stands to bring victory in the fight against homophobia and religious cruelty.\n\nI sat in awe watching it, as an ex Catholic who’s bible never mentioned “homosexuality” in its translations, and had always wondered why other sects even mentioned it. I had seen the word “sodomy” written, but in the old translation of the time, sodomy meant rape.\n\nBiblical literalism can’t be translated into words we use today, because no one actually knows what was really meant. If it’s been translated by countless, flawed humans throughout history, there’s no way that ANY translation could be the actual word of God.\n\nThese conservative religions are just another measure for white men to hold power over their masses and make tons of money from it. Reggio’s pastor father is a stern believer that this version is still the word of “God” and refused to listen to whatever she or the others had to say.\n\nWhite power, conservatism, and politics have always scapegoated groups of people who are categorized as “different” from the white, straight, cis male norm (think WWII). If there was someone that they hated, they made sure to make it about the select groups and never about themselves.\n\nWe see it still with the queer community, the poor, people with disabilities, women, fat people, the BIPOC community and everyone else that bigoted capitalism wants to continue to put down or annihilate in it’s unrelenting scheme of greed and worldly domination.\n\nThe film industry is full of this discrimination as well, but independent films like these are crucial to shining a light on what is toxic in our society. Reggio was brave enough to bring her personal struggles into it, giving a living example of this particular bigotry.\n\nI was astounded by her ability to still connect with her father, as I’m not sure I could reconcile with someone who outright denied the way I love and judged it a sin.\n\nThis is what a lot of LGBTQ people go through and much, much worse. The amount of murders, jail time, suicides, humiliation, psychological terrorism, broken families and bigotry that have been faced through the years caused by just being true to ourselves is horrifying.\n\nTeachings like these by conservative “Christians”, whose title I use lightly because they are nothing like Christ, are devastating to everyone on Earth. Why should humanity identify with one, strict type rather than being part of the beauty and the “all” that humanity is and can be?\n\nHatred is learned and super toxic not only towards the people it is put upon, but also to the people who hold it. When power and big money is made to continue it, that is a mix for absolute disaster.\n\nWatch this film and learn, then start doing a lot of research to educate yourself about the power of love to heal all that ails. We all have a choice to drink from the cup of poison that ignorant people have passed to us and question the lies we have believed and been party to.\n\nRefuse to hate. Our very existence depends on it.\n\nPain Hustlers: A Film With a Good Premise, But Lacking in Substance\n\nPain Hustlers, directed by David Yates, written by Wells Tower and Evan Hughes, is a film based “loosely” upon Hughes’s New York Times article with the same name and his book that is currently being published,, about the abuse of power in the American pharmaceutical and health industries.\n\nRunning on the heels of Netflix’s Painkiller, a beautifully made, limited series about how Perdue Pharmaceuticals and their crooked misuse of power and greed, founded the American opioid crisis, Hustlers takes a more fictional, comedic slant.\n\nThough the lightheartedness makes it a somewhat easier pill to swallow, the lack of characterization and focus on the people who suffered through it left a foul taste.\n\nDesperation kills\n\nLiza Drake (Emily Blunt) is a single mother to her daughter Phoebe, (Chloe Coleman). Liza works as a stripper at night and lives in her sister’s garage. We are shown that Liza seems to struggle a lot in life, according to her family, and hasn’t gotten her lucky break.\n\nOne night at the strip club, Liza meets Pete Brenner (Chris Evans), a smooth talking alpha type, who works at a pharmaceutical company. He ends up liking Liza and gives her his number should she ever want a job at the company. When Liza’s situation takes a turn for the worse, she calls Pete and ends up taking him up on it.\n\nAfter helping Liza lie about her credentials to the point of turning two years of high school to a PhD, Brenner recommends her to his boss and the company’s founder, the unhinged Dr. Neel (Andy Garcia). The company is at the point of bankruptcy, as the one drug they were banking on, simply isn’t on any provider’s radar.\n\nNeel and Brenner groom Liza into the world of unscrupulous big pharma, and she becomes their top seller, lured in by the promise of big money and her need to feel like she is doing something great.\n\nWhen the drug inevitably starts to get prescribed outside of the parameters set by the FDA, and patient addiction ensues, Liza must face what she has done and attempt to remove herself from the hundreds of million dollars greed fest she got herself into.\n\nIn all honesty…\n\nPain Hustlers is rather perplexing. Though the film and production design quality is good, there were many places that felt very awkward, that more character development, conscientious casting and script care may have cured.\n\nBlunt as Liza was the most miscast. She is much too refined, beautiful and clearly emanating wealth from all of her pores to be playing this character. For this reason, Liza’s lack was not heavily translated through her. It was completely impossible to suspend disbelief that she would be a stripper.\n\nThere also wasn’t enough desperation written into Liza’s life to do the things that she ends up doing. Her family is wealthy and she comes across as much too smart to fall for the ploys of the toxic system she sells her soul to. As a result, any of her efforts to change came off as uninspired because great need wasn’t there.\n\nAs a big fan of Andy Garcia’s most of my life, he simply wasn’t given enough to make an impact. Neel is not a fully fleshed out character and Garcia’s abilities were wasted here.\n\nHe does what he can with a character that is on the verge of a breakdown, but we never know enough about Neel or his background to invest much into the character. I didn’t love him or hate him, he was just kind of there, playing a greedy boss who’s mental health is declining, for reasons that also allude us.\n\nI was most troubled about some of the reasons Yates and producer Lawrence Grey had, not only for making this film, but their reasons for using humor in a film such as this.\n\n“Humor has always been a part of my storytelling as a filmmaker - it allows an audience in, and even with a subject as dark and as important as this, there is room for it “, and “the story about the pharmaceutical industry, that’s just an outrageous, amazing, darkly comic, thrilling subculture which is impossible to invent.”\n\nAs Americans we have seen countless drugs that have been touted as safe to use, end up needlessly and permanently harming and even killing people. There is nothing comical or amazing about it. Big pharma is a massive reprehensible beast that is relentless in the pursuit of money at all costs. It is despicable and murderous, hardly thrilling.\n\nIf people are going to make a film on a subject this horrifying, they should study up and have a lot more respect for what they are getting into, especially those from abroad who don’t have to live in it. Maybe make something condemning the diabolical American “health” system that helps promote big change.\n\nThey also stated that the victims would be “first and foremost” in the film, which did not happen. The victims featured were used more as story beats for Liza to turn her perspective around.\n\nThe film spent more time with the celebratory, money hungry dealers and their successes rather than with the effects it had on real families and people addicted to drugs by an underregulated, rotten system, where no wealthy execs are ever held accountable.\n\nThey even likened pharmaceutical companies as an “American Dream” of sorts, where poor, undereducated people could end up making big money. But at what cost? These people are generally recruited into the big pharma “cult”, and lied to about what they are selling to begin with.\n\nOne example I remember was the Fen-Phen craze in the 80’s that gave many people heart attacks in the pursuit of toxic thinness. I guarantee we are going to also start hearing about the new Ozempic craze, made famous by the rich, as it poisons more people in our grotesque drive for thinness at any cost and fat phobic stigma.\n\nAmerica is also the largest of the two countries in the world where it is legal to advertise drugs on mainstream media. The FDA, at this time, can’t limit the amount of money big pharma spends on advertising expensive drugs, nor ban advertisements of higher risk drugs.\n\nIt is a multi-billion dollar disease that robs hundreds of millions of people real healthcare and, has also been shown to increase health care costs. There were many, better and more responsible choices of angles to go with.\n\nOverall, Pain Hustlers isn’t a terribly made film. It struggles in multiple ways to be effective and leaves us with the feeling that the makers weren’t on the right side of the slant they ran with. It was too frivolously handled given the topic and it wasn’t clear as to what message it intended to get across in the first place.\n\nYour time would be better spent watching Netflix’s Painkiller instead. Ditch the glitzy big names and settle into an eye-opening limited series that definitely makes big pharma the cruel, greedy overlords that they truly are.\n\nMoon Garden: A Chimerical Glimpse Into the Power Within\n\nWith CGI in almost every film today, long have I missed the practical effects of films when I was growing up. Film artists the likes of Jim Henson, Frank Oz, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg set up fantastical worlds I loved exploring as a child.\n\nWatching the worlds play out in colorful, whimsical and sometimes frightening imagery, set my imagination ablaze. The puppetry of more characters than I can remember made the creatures and characters real and far easier for actors to interact with, yielding better connection to the audience.\n\nMoon Garden, written and directed by Ryan Stevens Harris, is a new Fantasy/Horror, that uses entirely practical effects and 35mm film, to capture a bizarre, disturbing and wondrously imaginative vista rife with visions not seen in far too long.\n\ndown into the depths\n\nEmma (Haven Lee Harris) is a sweet, imaginative little girl who lives with her parents. Mom, Sara (Augie Duke) and dad, Alex (Brionne Davis), both who love Emma very much, are arguing all the time. Emma struggles with hearing them screaming and being abusive to one another and wishes she could make both of them happy again.\n\nDuring an incident where Emma steps in on a particularly intense fight, she trips over her toys on the landing while she’s running away, which causes her to fall down the steps, knocking her into a coma. Within the constructs of her coma, Emma steps out on a perilous, but life changing journey to find her way back to her parents and her life in the 3D world.\n\nWithin the world, are many “windows” for her to see what is happening in the 3D, and she also meets some outlandish characters that assist her along her way. She isn’t entirely powerless within the world and those whom she meets impart objects and clues that guide her in the right direction.\n\nPursuing her, is a menacing creature called Teeth (Morgana Ignis), who is brought to life when Emma first cries. Her tears hold a kind of magic or satiety for its frenetic fascination, and the first taste initiates it’s vampiric obsession to possess her for its own. Teeth stops at nothing to claim her, even eradicating those who help her in its path.\n\nWill Emma be able to solve this puzzle and discover her power within to make her way safely back to her home before she becomes Teeth’s forever?\n\nIn all honesty…\n\nMoon Garden is nothing short of astonishing.\n\nI was absolutely blown away by the masterful artistry and craft throughout. Using light, color, texture, sound and imagery, Ryan Harris builds a world of fantastical scale with stop motion animation, 3D sets and models to bring simple objects to vivid life.\n\nWith exquisite arrangement and editing he is able to make the most mundane of trinkets stand for vaster metaphor. He also finds great beauty in simplistic every day items, like the blending of a substance that, up close, looks like ordinary colored water droplets and oil, into a scene sequence that integrates into something utterly fascinating.\n\nHaven Harris is equally exceptional. Being so young with such an array of precociously developed emotional responses to Emma’s journey is incredible. I felt so protective of her throughout the film that I worried if she was actually exposed to all of the frightening oddities of her real life father’s imagination.\n\nThe film itself reminded me of so many different films and music videos from the 90’s that I really enjoyed. It’s hard to choose one to compare it to exactly, which, in my opinion, is another win for Harris. Originality is in short supply these days, and originality with creativity, even harder to find. This was clearly a passion project for Harris, as his dedication and love permeates every scene.\n\nThough a protagonist finding strength within, and having the ability to shine light on their darkness is a tale as old as time, with this journey being such a young child’s, I thought Harris’s depiction of it was more than appropriate. Anyone expecting more from a child’s journey knows nothing about human development and Emma’s realizations far exceed most people of her age.\n\nHer explorations also harkens a delicate atmosphere of spirituality to the journey and stands as a metaphor for what humans do here on Earth over and over again in our lifetimes. We all experience many deaths and rebirths before the body dies.\n\nTransformation is essential to growth, self esteem and mental health regulation. Seeing first hand that almost anything is possible to get through, changes our outlooks on life itself and sets us in a powerful position to outgrow our fears and change the world.\n\nThough we may not live in a fantastical world of monsters, we are challenged every day with the darkness inside us. It tests our resilience and our ability to change and transform fully into the light within. That, is who we really are.\n\nBe brave and have faith. The road to healing and true power begins inside, and then through, the dark.\n\nEvil Dead Rise: Where Everything \"Just Happens to Be\"\n\n*MILD SPOILERS*\n\nI went into this film excited to see it due to all of its good reviews. I knew it wouldn’t be like the originals nor as funny without Ash, but since good horror films are needles in a haystack from the gargantuan amount of subpar content being churned out, I was ready for a good thrill.\n\nMy critic colleagues failed me and audiences everywhere with their glowing reviews of something that, barring the FX, was a lazy reproduction of borrowed horror nostalgia, that beats the already dead horse, into atoms.\n\nCue the gratuitous blood!\n\nIt Begins…again\n\nThe story begins with a flash forward and the usual white young people on a remote cabin trip. We don’t know how at the time, but one of the women has been infected with Evil Dead energy and begins the slaughter of her friends.\n\nFlashing back, single mother Ellie (Alyssa Sutherland) and her three children are eking out an existence in a mostly abandoned, run down apartment complex that apparently was (just happens to be) built over an old bank.\n\nEllie’s sister Beth (Lilly Sullivan) makes a return to see her sister and nieces and nephew, after a long absence being on the road with concerts. We come to find that Ellie and Beth’s relationship has been strained by Beth’s past unwillingness to stay in touch.\n\nAn earthquake strikes while the kids are alone in the parking lot, which just happens to leave a walkthrough hole right above the bank vault where, for some reason, the Book of the Dead is being stored. Danny (Morgan Davies) the middle sibling, explores the old vault and finds some old LP records, along with the book.\n\nSince Danny just happens to be an aspiring DJ, he just happens to have the turntables to listen to these LP’s, which of course, is generally rare in most homes now. He also happens to have the right equipment to format the LP’s sound into perfectly clear language, that ends up waking up The Book.\n\nThe evil energy attacks the unaware Ellie in their rickety elevator and the chaos begins…again.\n\nIn all honesty…\n\nHats off to the FX/makeup crews. Their work was by far the best part of this show. Sutherland looked and performed amazingly, and was seriously creepy. I just wish they would’ve given her a way better story to act with.\n\nThe lack of story and the absolutely ludicrous “just happens to be” party ruined the rest of it. Everything and everyone was set up to make everything work just exactly how the filmmakers wanted it, in utterly boring, too easy, uncreative ways. That’s lazy screenwriting.\n\nFor one, how would Danny have this incredible sound system complete with speakers if the family was so poor they had to live in a building that was going to be demolished in a month?\n\nAnd what happens when the sound system breaks but they need to listen to another record? Low and behold, Aunty Beth is a sound engineer who happens to know how to fix it. Hooray!\n\nAt a different part, demonic Ellie gets shut out of the apartment. After hours of looking for ways in, a random cat shows up in the ventilation system, then giving her an “a-ha” moment.\n\nJust after, the youngest child Kassie (Nell Fisher), who was also fantastic, mentions that the super’s cat goes up there every now and then. Really? When the hell would that ever happen except within a script with lazy writing? They set a cat up in the ventilators simply as a means to remind demon Ellie how to infiltrate the apartment.\n\nAlso, if Ellie was possessed by smaller amounts of the Evil Dead blood in the elevator, why weren’t Beth and Kassie when they were practically drowned in it?\n\nThe “just happens” and convenient plot points/holes continue to occur over and over again, setting up characters and story arcs with inexcusably weak, easy ways to push the already struggling story forward. I bet there are student screenwriters who could write scripts with more heart and creativity, but professionals, not just the writers, aren’t held to the same standards, and continue pumping out garbage with the greatest of glee.\n\nOn top of that, plenty of scenes are just “borrowed” from other horror movies. Whether or not it was meant as an homage, I don’t want to spend good money on old stuff I can stream practically free at home.\n\nDid anyone above the line, barring the actors, have to do any real thinking or creating? Clearly not with the script, nor the many borrowed scenes.\n\nMy advice? Skip it. You’ve already seen all of this in other, better films.\n\nIf you want to see the good FX/makeup, save the big bucks and wait to stream it. There are great apps you can get for an entire month for less than one movie ticket, and see way higher quality content all around.\n\nThe viewers are the ones who tell the industry what we want to see with our money. We don’t have to settle for garbage anymore.\n\nAll Quiet On The Western Front: Stunning Visuals; Not Enough Character\n\nI was a little late to seeing All Quiet. The hub bub surrounding the film got me curious and I was given a copy of the new 4K BluRay, double disc format exclusively through Netflix. The 4K is nothing short of glorious given the stunning production quality of the film in general, but I found myself struggling after I watched it, because it didn’t quite connect.\n\nAnother War Movie\n\nWhen a film is written, it is usually done under the understanding that most “everything has been done before”. With that in mind, screenwriters are challenged to make their slant of a story unique and give an audience a fresh perspective on whatever the subject entails.\n\nThere are numerous films about war, from specific people in them to specific happenings within the scope of the war. When treated right, the film can become a truly epic “stand out” amongst the crowd. To make that happen, every single department involved in the film must be equally committed to the unique vision and come together to create the ultimate masterpiece.\n\nAll Quiet On The Western Front, adapted from the 1929 novel by Erich Maria Remarque and directed by Edward Berger, attempts to follow young German soldier Paul Baumer (Felix Kammerer) and a handful of his friends, from their joyful enlistment to their tragic deaths, near the end of the first World War. Berger emphasized the importance of the “German perspective”, and how it became his “driving force” throughout.\n\nAccording to the booklet that comes with the Blu-ray set, he wanted to capture how German’s view of war was “marked by grief and shame, sorrow and death, destruction and guilt” rather than the more “optimistic” tales told by English or American perspectives. That message becomes quite clear to us through the darkness, chaos and senseless death within the film.\n\nWe see how reckless power and ego drives war and how each of the soldiers fighting for the leaders become just one of many faceless casualties. The film also deals with the loneliness and isolation of the soldiers when they realize that what they were being sold when they enlisted, isn’t actually the brave, heroic, patriotic mission they understood it to be.\n\nWar is hell. It is desolation, destruction and complete inhumanity brought by those unwilling to do the fighting for the power and greed they are harboring for themselves. We see that the boys learn this immediately after experiencing the front lines. Innocence, youth and the ability to live a normal life is eradicated. No one “wins” anything.\n\nwhat is it all for?\n\nThe film takes place, mostly in France, when the German occupation was coming to a close. Shot in Prague, the visuals throughout most of the film are a cornucopia of sumptuous, emotional beauty, so much so, that when we aren’t actually at the front, we forget about all of the brutality happening elsewhere.\n\nWe get to see Paul and his mates when they are called off the front, to duty in rural areas, where the German soldiers are still camped in France. Some fun is had, but they all stay pretty morose in general, hoping to return home or to family. It’s an uneasy but inevitably awkward and tense interaction, given that small talk is now wholly irrelevant for them.\n\nThe men scramble for food and water and are generally uncared for by their commanding officers. Paul watches as each of his friends gets killed, one by one and yet, he tragically stays committed to a losing battle.\n\nBerger adds scenes of an armistice agreement taking place on a luxury train between the French and German officers. Here we get to see what negotiations might have looked like. We also see the vast discrepancy between how the officers live in peaceful houses of plenty compared to the cold, bleak, scarcity existence of the soldiers on the front.\n\nIt shows the dynamics of how disingenuous and cruel the upper echelon is in times of war, and also how the current system works in every day life. Why should the wealthy and powerful care about everyone else if they have all that they need and more?\n\nIt is a metaphor for how they continue to get us to fight their wars and do their work, in exchange for an unachievable and inaccessible fairy tale outcome that keeps us subservient and poor the rest of our lives.\n\nWe exist solely to serve them, die for their causes and make them more wealthy.\n\nIn All honesty…\n\nThough the production design and cinematography is off the charts phenomenal, I felt perplexed and cheated by the lack of character development.\n\nI felt extremely disconnected from the characters. They seemed only part of the machinations to show us what war was like during this particular time of WWI. Though what happens to each of them is horrific, it felt expected and too easy to part with them, because I knew barely anything about them.\n\nThere is very little talk of family they are leaving behind or their dreams and ambitions. We don’t know who Paul is or what he came from. We never know his thoughts. We never get to know why being a part of this was so important to him nor why he persisted when he knew it was a losing battle.\n\nThe closest we get to see of Paul changing emotionally, is a brutal scene that takes place in a bomb pit where he kills one of the French soldiers. We get to see his horror and the realization that he is actually brethren to the soldier that he just stabbed to death. That was heartbreaking and pivotal, but we see no other defining moments for him.\n\nThe same goes for every other character in the film. All of the what’s, why’s and from where’s are completely withheld from us. We are supposed to live through the main characters eyes in a film, but all he does is watch and react like any person would when death and starvation is rampant.\n\nWe see the breadth and copiousness of this magnificently produced film turned to almost nothingness with the shallowness of the characters existing within it. None of the characters deaths mean anything without this connection which left me questioning what was all of the production design and cinematography for?\n\nBerger stated that he pretty much just let the actors do their thing without directing them and he was happy with what they did. The acting itself was highly competent, however, the actors really had nothing to do except exhibit the normal outer human reactions when placed in a situation that is this extreme and shocking. We missed all of the beauty and fascinating nuances found within each unique being, which renders the abundance, expanse and pith of acting to common and mechanical, practically neutering it.\n\nI also found the main musical theme to be inappropriate for the film. It sounded like it belonged more in a SciFi film and felt noticeably displacing from the world we were supposed to be in.\n\nWith that said, I still feel I can’t splat it, but had any other component of the film been deficient, it would’ve earned it on its own. As mentioned above, any film is a symphony of artists in numerous departments that all have to be on point to create greatness, and that starts with a phenomenal script.\n\nIf you are a fan of the film I highly recommend the 4K version. It’s as close to the theatre as you can get right now and it’s a worthy piece for your collection.\n\nSlamdance 2023: Sign The Show: Working Toward A More Inclusive World\n\nI’ve been a social justice advocate most of my life, doing all I can to push for radical progression and undo the legacies of toxic power and privilege. As a critic, I have continued as an advocate for underserved artists, highlighting mostly their work as opposed to mainstream, where the power imbalance is horrifically skewed.\n\nI have been invited to the Sundance Film Festival the past 5 years in a row. My first invite came in 2019 and I was thrilled. As a person who lives with disabilities I worried about access to the Festival because I am unable to stand in lines for a prolonged period of time and was also concerned that most people who go there, get around town in busses or by walking.\n\nThere are so many reasons why neither of those wouldn’t work for me, so I reached out to Sundance’s disability team about it. I asked if there was special transportation for people with disabilities who were attending and, whether or not they could accommodate me, ongoing, in the theaters, to be seated inside early, so I wouldn’t have to stand in the long lines.\n\nI was disappointed to find out that I was more or less on my own. Their idea of accommodation was “maybe” being able to set a chair outside the theaters for me, and they had no special transportation for those with disabilities, stating that most people use the bus (umm, big stairs?). They stated that there was also just a couple of placard holding handicapped spots throughout the whole town and that no lots were reserved or designated for people with physical disabilities.\n\nNeedless to say, I didn’t end up going. When COVID hit, the fest was continued online so I was able to attend those. I thought it proved more progressive, for all sorts of people who couldn’t access the fest, for whatever reason, in the past.\n\nFast forward to Sundance 2023. Not only was there less online availability, I came across this article , regarding more accessibility issues at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival, this time for famous jurors who were deaf/hard of hearing. I was not surprised but was angry that they still weren’t fixing these problems.\n\nI posted about it on Instagram and was made aware that, ironically, over at their sister festival, Slamdance, was playing an absolute gem of a documentary about the deaf and hard of hearing community not being able to access their favorite live concerts, comedy shows and plays.\n\nSign The Show, directed by Cat Brewer, is a timely, all encompassing documentary bringing into focus the difficulties that the deaf and hard of hearing community have while trying to attend live events.\n\nAnswering the call\n\nCat Brewer was a college educator when she went to enjoy a music concert several years ago. She noticed that at this concert there was an interpreter signing the concert. Like most hearing individuals, myself included, she was unaware that the deaf community wanted access to live concerts and shows across the board, at all kinds of venues.\n\nBrewer began investigating, talking to interpreters and reaching out to the deaf community inquiring about this subject and that planted the seed for the making of this film. She travelled all across the nation, interviewing interpreters, musical celebrities and deaf advocate groups.\n\nThe film references the American Disabilities Act (ADA), signed into law in 1991, quoting: “Any place of public accommodation is required to provide sign language interpreters or other effective means of communication for hard of hearing individuals.”\n\nWhat the ADA doesn’t mention are the myriad of loopholes and complications that a given venue may have due for a myriad of reasons. For example, though a venue must fulfill the need for an interpreter, the ADA allows venues the option to pick one night of the show when an interpreter is available. So what if you’re not available that particular night? It’s not the venue’s headache.\n\nConcert goers also have the option to call a venue ahead of time to secure an interpreter and be seated in the hard of hearing section, but there is no guarantee that the venue will actually have an interpreter when needed, nor be able to seat someone where they can actually see the interpreter.\n\nFar too many venues don’t have accommodations like these and many others, on an ongoing basis, just as part of their business.\n\nA Rallying cry\n\nBrewer speaks to several organizations and interpreters actively working to change this. Matt Maxey, founder of the organization DEAFinitely Dope, advocate for the deaf and hard of hearing community, has worked in many venues and concerts. signing hip-hop shows. He was discovered by Chance the Rapper while signing a show and Chance asked him to travel with the crew and sign the rest of his shows on his tour.\n\nIn 2006, the non-profit organization Deaf West Theatre, put up the Broadway musical, Spring Awakening, performing simultaneously in American Sign Language (ASL) and English, using a deaf and hearing cast. It was the first of its kind. Hearing performers had to learn ASL and learn about the experiences of the deaf and hard of hearing community from the deaf actors.\n\nFor the past ten years the Firefly Music Festival has been gathering incredible names in musical entertainment while accommodating people of all kinds, embracing the disability community. They pride themselves in being an all inclusive and safe venue for everyone. Why can’t every place do this?\n\nThe film dabbles in all the different ways that sign language isn’t just a modem of communication, but an entire language and form of bodily expression for the deaf. It has its own jargon, slang and impact that speaks to a distinctive group of people, whom otherwise would be shut out.\n\nEvery interpreter also specializes in different aspects of life including business, medical, education and performance art, so interpreters are not a “one size fits all” service. There are detailed components to the different types of signing including “deaf jokes”, innuendos and puns, and, what’s more, deaf people communicate and associate in ways that are different even to each other.\n\nIn all honesty…\n\nSign The Show is a genuine accomplishment and a necessity for all people to see. There is so much to learn from it.\n\nBrewer creates her freshman film with abundant heart and meticulous singularity on a subject that, until now, hasn’t had a spotlight. The message is one of full inclusion and it makes us aware that the way hearing people experience life and music, isn’t the only or best way to experience it.\n\nThis film shows that there are so many different ways to sense things in the world, and, if we could just stay open, that could enrich and enhance how we experience those things already.\n\nBrewer’s prospective succeeds in a “ready to listen and learn” dynamic, making her subjects the priority, and allowing them to communicate without intrusion. The flow is smooth yet impactful without hitting the audience over the head with any biased agendas.\n\nIn this way, she is able to connect us with multiple, diverse people and entertainment genres in a succinct, easy to digest and non-judgmental way. This sense of ease creates comfort, allowing for the audience to really hear the subjects, and take in a lot of information that leaves you feeling inspired, not drained.\n\nIn documentaries, this is no simple task.
