        "text": "(1908–85). American director Phil Karlson made movies in a variety of genres. However, he was probably best known for his film noirs of the 1950s.\n\nKarlson was born Philip N. Karlstein on July 2, 1908, in Chicago, Illinois. While studying law at Loyola Marymount University in California, he took a job at Universal in the props department. He soon focused on a career in Hollywood, and in the early 1930s he became an assistant director, eventually working on more than 35 films.\n\nIn 1944 Karlson directed his first feature, the comedy A WAVE, a WAC, and a Marine. His movies during the rest of the decade included the comedy G.I. Honeymoon (1945), the musical Swing Parade of 1946 (1946), and the westerns Adventures in Silverado and Thunderhoof (both 1948). He also made films for several series, including Behind the Mask (1946), which featured the superhero the Shadow, and Dark Alibi (1946), an entry in the Charlie Chan franchise. The musical Ladies of the Chorus (1948) is of historical interest for featuring Marilyn Monroe in her first major role.\n\nIn 1952 Karlson directed Scandal Sheet, a film noir based on Samuel Fuller’s novel The Dark Page. The taut thriller centers on a newspaper editor (played by Broderick Crawford) who accidentally kills his estranged wife. Kansas City Confidential (1952) was another effective noir, with John Payne as an ex-convict seeking retribution after nearly being framed for an armed robbery. Payne also starred in the violent 99 River Street (1953), this time portraying a former prizefighter who becomes the prime suspect in his wife’s murder. Karlson briefly took a break from noirs to make the western They Rode West (1954) and Hell’s Island (1955), an adventure starring Payne as a down-on-his-luck bouncer who is hired to find an elusive jewel.\n\nIn 1955 Karlson returned to crime dramas with Tight Spot, starring Ginger Rogers as a former moll serving a prison term and Edward G. Robinson as the attorney offering her freedom in exchange for her testimony against a gangster. That same year Karlson directed 5 Against the House, a heist picture (based on a novel by Jack Finney) about college students who try to rob a Nevada nightclub, and The Phenix City Story, an exposé of corruption in an Alabama town that was inspired by true events. The Brothers Rico (1957), based on a story by Georges Simenon, was another crime drama, with Richard Conte as an accountant trying to protect his gangster brothers who have been targeted for murder. Karlson ended the decade with Gunman’s Walk (1958), a western starring Van Heflin as a rancher having problems with his sons.\n\nIn 1960 Karlson directed his first war film, Hell to Eternity, which was based on the story of World War II hero Guy Gabaldon. That same year he helmed the crime drama Key Witness, which featured Dennis Hopper as a gang leader. In 1961 Karlson directed the spy adventure The Secret Ways, with Richard Widmark as an American mercenary hired to smuggle a famous scholar out of Hungary, and The Young Doctors, a medical soap opera based on a popular novel by Arthur Hailey. Next came Kid Galahad (1962), an Elvis Presley musical."
