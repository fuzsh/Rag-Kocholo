        "text": "\"Charlie Chan's Chance\" -- the 1932 Fox motion picture starring Warner Oland as Chan-- is now considered a \"lost\" film (the original film materials were destroyed in a vault fire.) Unless a copy surfaces in some remote corner of the world, as happened with \"Charlie Chan in Paris,\" this original screenplay is the closest Chan fans will come to seeing the original. This addition to the film series was penned by Barry Conners and Philip Klein, with added material suggested by Earl Derr Biggers, and based loosely on Biggers' original novel, \"Behind That Curtain.\"\n\nEarl Derr Biggers was born in Warren, Ohio on August 24, 1884. Years later, while attending Harvard University, Biggers showed little passion for the classics, preferring instead writers such as Rudyard Kipling and Richard Harding Davis. Following his graduation from Harvard in 1907, he worked briefly for the Cleveland Plain Dealer and at Bobbs-Merrill publishers. By 1908, Biggers was hired at the Boston Traveler to write a daily humor column. Soon, however, he became that paper's drama critic. It was at this time that he met Elanor Ladd, who would later become his wife and who would have a marked influence in his writing."
