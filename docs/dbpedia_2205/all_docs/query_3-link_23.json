        "text": "Voting Rules\n\nVote up the book-to-film changes that make you want to rip up the script.\n\nAdapting a beloved novel to the big screen is a difficult task. Whether or not critics praise the film, fans of the book are nearly always going to take umbrage with some aspect of the movie. Sometimes even the authors themselves aren't happy with the translation to the big screen.\n\nBook fans often decry changes to a character's physical characteristics, or characters and plot points that get left out. But sometimes such changes are inevitable because a movie can't possibly cover every single detail. Other changes or omissions are more substantial and thus more controversial. These book-to-movie adaptations upset book fans who expected more.\n\nIn J.K. Rowling's book Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Voldemort and Harry Potter square off for their final confrontation inside the Great Hall at Hogwarts. After Voldemort's curse rebounds and kills him instead of Harry, the Dark Lord simply falls to the ground. It's pretty much a pedestrian demise, which fits, because once Voldemort's Horcruxes have been eliminated, he is nothing but a mere mortal, which he was determined to never be.\n\nThe movie version, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, spices up the final scene. Harry and Voldemort duel with explosions and fireworks, this time outside of Hogwarts. After the Elder Wand fells Voldemort, his body disintegrates into piles of ash and soullessly floats away into the wind.\n\nMany fans don't like the added drama in the film. Redditor u/miamental wrote:\n\nThe filmmakers went for artistic instead of realistic (according to the books), and while artistic expression should be respected, it was such a huge moment for the series that I feel they should have stuck to the source material.\n\nI specifically disliked how they cleared everyone out and had the fight in the courtyard… However, the worst part was the whole “Voldemort’s body withering away into bits” scene. That was bogus. The entire point of the series is that once his Horcruxes are gone, Voldemort is again a mortal man. Having his body erupt into flowers defies this point and kind of ruins the amount of time spent discussing Horcruxes.\n\nIn Lois Lowry's 1993 YA novel The Giver, the dystopian world of the novel is set in The Community, a black-and-white place where there is no pain and no emotion, with the goal of creating “sameness” to avoid suffering. Fiona and Jonas are 12 years old. But in the 2014 screen adaptation, filmmakers cast 17-year-old Odeya Rush in the role of Fiona and 24-year-old Brenton Thwaites to play Jonas.\n\nRedditor u/brashandsassy wrote that they were “devastatingly disappointed” with parts of the adaptation:\n\nMain character Jonas's age is increased from 12 to 16 and is being played by a 24-year-old.\n\nThe film will not be in black and white, not even in the beginning of the film, despite the \"sameness\" nature of its utopian society. How are they going to depict the strange flickers that Jonas experiences when he sees Fiona's hair or an apple?\n\nThey are changing Jonas's one-sided innocent lust towards Fiona to a full-on \"love affair\" between the two.\n\nTauriel (played by Evangeline Lilly in the films) does not appear in J.R.R. Tolkien's 1937 novel The Hobbit. Director Peter Jackson created the Wood-elf of Mirkwood for the film adaptation, and she is a strong female presence in the story's male-dominated world.\n\nMany fans loved the addition of Tauriel, but weren't so happy about about the love triangle filmmakers created. Lilly herself wasn't thrilled with the idea, because she'd had enough of a love triangle during her days on Lost. She reportedly agreed to play the elf only if the trope was not written into The Hobbit. Lilly said of her Lost character Kate Austen: “I felt that my character went from being autonomous - really having her own story, and her own journey, and her own agendas - to chasing two men around the island. That irritated the sh*t out of me.”\n\nStill, the love triangle between Tauriel, Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Kili (Aidan Turner) became a key component in The Hobbit.\n\nRedditor u/Powerful_Artist wrote:\n\nIn general I think the Hobbit movies would be stronger if they removed the Tauriel love [interest] with the dwarf [Kili]. [It's] one of the worst movie romances [I've] ever seen, and feels completely forced. Not to mention it takes up valuable screen time they [could've] used elsewhere. One problem I have is figuring out who she is and why she is there… How and why is Legolas so committed to her?… [She's] beautiful and she seems like a great actor, but The Hobbit does not need a love story. It just [doesn't].\n\nJane Austen's 1813 novel Pride and Prejudice has been adapted numerous times for the big and small screen. The 2005 film version starring Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet and Matthew Macfadyen as Mr. Darcy received four Oscar nominations, for Knightley as best actress, and for best score, costume design, and art direction. Some fans and critics, however, thought the film emphasized romance over realism.\n\nRedditor u/KaiG1987 wrote:\n\nI'm a big fan of the novel, but unfortunately that meant I couldn't enjoy the 2005 movie much at all. While it does have wonderful cinematography, in my opinion it's like a truncated theme park version of Pride and Prejudice, with too much of the nuance and satire removed.\n\nAnd Redditor u/OldManAbernathy wrote:\n\nAll of Austen’s interesting commentary about the nature of marriage and happiness is removed for the sake of the main “standard” love story.\n\nTim Burton's 2005 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory had two different beloved works to be compared with: Roald Dahl's 1964 children's book and the 1971 big-screen adaptation featuring Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka.\n\nIn Burton's film, starring Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka, screenwriter John August provided exposition into the candy man's dark past that's not in the book. The audience learns that as a child, Wonka was not allowed to eat candy because his father was a dentist who despised the sugary treat. He left home for a while, and when he returned, his father was gone and he became an orphan.\n\nMany fans of the film and book did not care for the dark backstory. Redditor u/GyantSpyder wrote:\n\nFor most of the people I've talked to, the backstory came off as forced, boring, and pointless, and is the source of most of the distaste for the movie…The whole \"Willy Wonka learns the value of family and reconciles with his father\" thing is a bizarre departure for the character in that work...\n\nIt's taking a story that's about wonder in a really screwed-up and intense, semi-mysterious way, and instead making it dreary and psychologically dramatic and straightforward. And it stinks with a smug sense of superiority that it is improving on the source material, when really it is just failing to understand it.\n\nHollywood just can't quit trying to adapt Nathaniel Hawthorne's 1850 novel The Scarlet Letter, which falls under public domain. Hawthorne's high school reading staple has been adapted for TV or film 13 times.\n\nThe 1995 version, directed by Roland Joffé and starring Demi Moore as Hester Prynne and Gary Oldman as the Rev. Arthur Dimmesdale, was not a hit: The film “won” seven Golden Raspberry Awards, and on Rotten Tomatoes earned a 13% critics score and 41% audience score.\n\nBook critic Paul Constant wrote in The Seattle Review of Books:\n\n…[T]he end of the movie is abominable. Hester and Arthur are about to be hanged together, but they are saved at the last minute by warring Native Americans, because they’re the only white people who treated them right. The couple rides off into the sunset together, Hester discarding her scarlet letter in the road as they head to the Carolinas for their happy ending.\n\nA Rotten Tomatoes audience reviewer who gave the film one star decried the ending as well:\n\nThe Scarlet Letter (1995) is hollow, stupid, and completely melodramatic. It changes Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel of a struggling woman to a sappy romance between two lovers, with the Indians as a rescue team and, well, the heroes walk free again. It is seriously a fat cliche."
