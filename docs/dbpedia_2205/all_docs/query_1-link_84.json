        "text": "01 of 20\n\nAlex Strangelove (2018)\n\nA coming-of-age rom-com that sees a popular teen wrestle with his sexuality may sound like a familiar narrative, but Alex Strangelove adds its own spin. Alex Truelove (Daniel Doheny) lives in an especially progressive and supportive environment for a high school tale, nearly void of the common prejudices against queerness. Still, Alex doesn't know what — or who — he wants, and he has to learn about himself before he can know for sure.\n\nMany LGBTQ+ rom-coms tend to focus on protagonists that are working against societal biases, but Alex Strangelove offers a more joyful take on the queer experience. EW's critic praises the film's underlying theme beneath its (occasionally cringey) twist and turns, writing, \"It's hard to fault the bigger message here: that we all deserve the right to be true to who we are, even if it takes a few hard turns — and some collateral emotional damage — to get there.\" —Angela Andaloro\n\nWhere to watch Alex Strangelove: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Craig Johnson\n\nCast: Daniel Doheny, Antonio Marziale, Madeline Weinstein, Joanna Adler, William Ragsdale, Daniel Zolghadri\n\n02 of 20\n\nAlong for the Ride (2022)\n\nBased on the novel by Sarah Dessen, night owl Auden (Emma Pasarow) displeases her type-A mom (Andie MacDowell) by going to stay with her absentee dad (Dermot Mulroney), his wife (Kate Bosworth), and their newborn over the summer before college. Now on a mission to taste all the teenage experiences she's missed out on, Auden soon makes her first real group of girlfriends and roams the beach town in the wee hours of the morning. Doing so brings her to meet another night-type, Eli (Belmont Cameli), who has a repressed past of his own.\n\nSofia Alvarez is no stranger to teen rom-coms, given that she adapted To All the Boys I've Loved Before into the hit Netflix film franchise. Now, she's made her feature-length directorial debut with Along for the Ride, having collaborated with Dessen, queen of the beach read, on this quintessential summer romance film. \"I have always really loved those nostalgic summertime movies that I grew up watching, and I think I immediately saw the potential for this movie to be one of those,\" Alvarez told EW. \"I really wanted it to be the kind of summer movie where you smell the sunscreen through the screen...or it has a soundtrack that everyone is singing in their cars this summer when they're driving to the beach.\" Spoiler alert: This movie (and its soundtrack by Beach House) achieves all of that and more. —A.A.\n\nWhere to watch Along for the Ride: Netflix\n\nDirector: Sofia Alvarez\n\nCast: Emma Pasarow, Belmont Cameli, Kate Bosworth, Dermot Mulroney, Andie MacDowell\n\n03 of 20\n\nAlways Be My Maybe (2019)\n\nWho says you can't go home again? Ali Wong shines in this romantic comedy about childhood best friends who cross paths as adults after an awkward teenage romance ended badly. Fast forward 16 years, and life has taken celebrity chef Sasha Tran (Wong) and unsuccessful musician Marcus Kim (Randall Park) to some very different places. Much has changed, but their chemistry sure hasn't as the two come face-to-face with their many differences on the road to reconciliation.\n\nCostars Wong and Park are also co-writers for the film, and, given the hilarity of Wong's Netflix stand-up specials, it's no wonder Always Be My Maybe was an instant hit. The central lovebirds have a lot of healing to do from their complicated youths before they can live happily ever after, but the laughter makes it that much sweeter. Throw in a disastrous double date featuring Keanu Reeves playing, well, Keanu Reeves, and you've got yourself a chaotic love triangle unlike any you've seen before. EW's critic highlights the film's graceful lack of tokenism as well: \"Always Be My Maybe … joins a burgeoning if still too small club of mainstream movies centered without any special pomp or circumstance on Asian American characters.\" Seriously, what's not to love? —A.A.\n\nWhere to watch Always Be My Maybe: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Nahnatchka Khan\n\nCast: Ali Wong, Randall Park, James Saito, Michelle Buteau, Vivian Bang, Daniel Dae Kim, Keanu Reeves\n\n04 of 20\n\nAnyone but You (2023)\n\nLike the beloved '90s rom-coms that transplanted classic stories to modern-day high school, Anyone But You is a modern spin on Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing. The charming flick centers on Bea (Sydney Sweeney) and Ben (Glen Powell), a pair of attractive singles whose first date ends poorly. Six months later, they're shocked and dismayed to be in each other's lives again at a destination wedding, and their bickering leads those in the wedding party to try getting them together. A sleeper box office hit, Anyone But You is an earnest throwback where most of the plot is predictable but you don't mind — largely because of its compelling leads. —Kevin Jacobsen\n\nWhere to watch Anyone but You: Netflix\n\nDirector: Will Gluck\n\nCast: Sydney Sweeney, Glen Powell, Alexandra Shipp, GaTa, Hadley Robinson, Michelle Hurd, Dermot Mulroney, Darren Barnet, Rachel Griffiths\n\n05 of 20\n\nCrazy Rich Asians (2018)\n\nBased on the best-selling novel of the same name, Crazy Rich Asians made history not only as the highest-grossing romantic comedy of the 2010s but also as the first major Hollywood film set in modern times to feature an all-Asian cast since 1993's The Joy Luck Club. Crazy Rich Asians follows Rachel Chu (Constance Wu), an NYU professor who travels with her dashing boyfriend Nick (Henry Golding) to Singapore for the wedding of Nick's best friend. Rachel soon realizes that Nick comes from an uber-rich family, and finds it difficult to live up to the high expectations of his mother, Eleanor (Michelle Yeoh).\n\nWhile the film has more than its fair share of rom-com tropes (class differences, sassy sidekick, makeover montage, etc.), it's hard to get mad when the ensemble cast is so strong and the visuals are to die for. As EW's critic describes, it's \"two hours of romantic fantasy and real-estate porn poured on so thick it’s almost lickable.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Crazy Rich Asians: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Jon M. Chu\n\nCast: Constance Wu, Henry Golding, Michelle Yeoh, Gemma Chan, Lisa Lu, Awkwafina, Ken Jeong\n\n06 of 20\n\nEasy A (2010)\n\nEmma Stone achieved full star status with this 2010 teen comedy, which pays homage to The Scarlet Letter. She plays Olive, a California high schooler whose lie about losing her virginity spirals out of control and becomes a school-wide scandal as she comes to embrace her newfound status as a \"promiscuous\" person. While pretending to have sex with fellow students to boost their reputations, she also rekindles her relationship with Todd (Penn Badgley), her childhood crush who sees Olive for the real her, not people's assumptions of who she is.\n\nStone earned huge raves for her performance, with EW's critic stating, \"Stone has a speed and sparkle that may remind you of [Lindsay] Lohan in her Mean Girls prime.\" She received the MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance and earned her first Golden Globe nomination, while the film won the Critics Choice Award for Best Comedy Movie. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Easy A: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Will Gluck\n\nCast: Emma Stone, Penn Badgley, Amanda Bynes, Thomas Haden Church, Patricia Clarkson, Cam Gigandet, Lisa Kudrow, Malcolm McDowell, Stanley Tucci\n\n07 of 20\n\nThe Half of It (2020)\n\nIn a modern retelling of the classic French play Cyrano de Bergerac, Ellie (Leah Lewis) starts ghostwriting love letters for a jock, Paul (Daniel Diemer), in exchange for some much-needed cash. But as she continues to correspond with Paul's dream girl, Aster (Alexxis Lemire), Ellie finds they have a lot in common and wonders if she's actually her better half. Though the romantic tension between the unknowing Aster and the unfortunate Ellie pushes the film forward, the true heart of this story is the blossoming friendship between Ellie and Paul. He may not be able to write to save his life, but Paul speaks up where it counts, causing an intimate and (somewhat) overlapping love triangle between teens who are just trying to learn what life is all about.\n\nThe characters' bond is rooted in Lewis and Diemer's genuine affection, too. \"Daniel is like my brother now,\" Lewis told EW. \"His belief in me as Daniel definitely translated onscreen where Ellie finds the courage to perform because of Paul's belief in [her].\" —A.A.\n\nWhere to watch The Half of It: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Alice Wu\n\nCast: Leah Lewis, Daniel Diemer, Alexxis Lemire, Enrique Murciano, Wolfgang Novogratz, Catherine Curtin, Becky Ann Baker, Collin Chou\n\n08 of 20\n\nHit Man (2024)\n\nTalk about an unconventional meet-cute. Glen Powell co-wrote and stars in this darkly comedic romantic thriller as Gary Johnson, a mild-mannered college professor who also works with the police posing as a hitman to bust murder-for-hire clients. He proves adept at his undercover job, but, after a woman named Madison (Adria Arjona) hires Gary to kill her husband, he soon finds himself developing feelings, which complicates matters. Powell delivers his best performance to date as the chameleonic faux-assassin, and his chemistry with Arjona is off-the-charts charming. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Hit Man: Netflix\n\nDirector: Richard Linklater\n\nCast: Glen Powell, Adria Arjona, Austin Amelio, Retta\n\n09 of 20\n\nThe Incredible Jessica James (2017)\n\nJessica Williams (2 Dope Queens, Shrinking) is a relatable force to be reckoned with in her debut lead role. As the uber-confident Jessica James, she's trying to find out what's next in both her work life and her love life, with New York City as the backdrop. However, a blind date throws a wrench in all her plans as she finds herself unexpectedly falling for Boone (Chris O'Dowd) though she's still not quite over her ex, Damon (LaKeith Stanfield).\n\nWhile the love story at the center of The Incredible Jessica James may seem a little trope-y and basic at times, the protagonist is anything but that. Jessica is a joyful, empowered character who faces her mistakes head-on without beating herself up about them. EW's critic celebrates the rom-com for its not-so-delicate balance, writing, \"Even when the film falls into indie clichés, Williams keeps things moving with her cleverness and charisma, whether she's chastising man-spreaders on the subway or introducing an as-yet-unborn baby to the fight to dismantle the patriarchy.\" —A.A.\n\nWhere to watch The Incredible Jessica James: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: James C. Strouse\n\nCast: Jessica Williams, Chris O'Dowd, Noël Wells, LaKeith Stanfield, Megan Ketch, Zabryna Guevara\n\n10 of 20\n\nKicking and Screaming (1995)\n\nAfter graduating from college, a group of friends move in together, hoping to delay the start of the rest of their lives. One of them is Grover (Josh Hamilton), who passes on his girlfriend's offer to study abroad with her. Like many of his future works, Noah Baumbach's directorial debut is a meditation on adults trying to figure out what they want in life. Grover and his friends are far from perfect, as they deal with romance and dashed dreams within their limbo period between college and the real world. \"What distinguishes Baumbach,\" EW's critic observes, \"is that his cleverness conceals a ruefully romantic temperament.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Kicking and Screaming: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Noah Baumbach\n\nCast: Josh Hamilton, Olivia d'Abo, Chris Eigeman, Parker Posey, Jason Wiles, Cara Buono, Carlos Jacott, Elliott Gould, Eric Stoltz\n\n11 of 20\n\nLong Shot (2019)\n\nGirl babysits boy; boy crushes on girl; girl grows up to become Secretary of State; boy becomes an out-of-work journalist; boy and girl reunite when she hires him on as her speechwriter. While not the most conventional setup, so much of the appeal of Long Shot is in seeing Seth Rogen and Charlize Theron bounce off each other. As EW's critic writes, \"Rogen and Theron's chemistry is as fizzy as a Red Bull-and-Champagne cocktail.\" Even in its raunchier elements, there’s also a poignant story at the film’s core, on the struggles of finding love while in the public eye and staying true to your values. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Long Shot: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Jonathan Levine\n\nCast: Seth Rogen, Charlize Theron, O’Shea Jackson Jr., Andy Serkis, June Diane Raphael, Bob Odenkirk, Alexander Skarsgård\n\n12 of 20\n\nThe Lovebirds (2020)\n\nThe relationship between Leilani (Issa Rae) and Jibran (Kumail Nanjiani) is on its last legs and fading fast when the struggling couple is invited to a dinner party. On their way there, a chance encounter with a criminal changes the course of their night — and their separation. If they want to make it out alive and clear their names, the two will have to work together, but not without throwing a few passive-aggressive jabs at each other in the process.\n\nThe Lovebirds gives viewers a different kind of second-chance romance. It's light on the romance and heavy on the antics, making it an honest portrayal of all that can make or break a relationship — romantic or not. Still, the chemistry between Rae and Nanjiani eliminates any question of their potential as a couple. They bicker in that comfortable, weathered way that shows strain, but that edge may be just what they need to see their situation to the other side. And confronting it all is just as challenging as solving the murder they witnessed. EW's critic notes, \"What feels freshest, maybe, is the mere fact of two leads of color taking on all the tropes of the genre and making it feel as modern as they do.\" —A.A.\n\nWhere to watch The Lovebirds: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Michael Showalter\n\nCast: Kumail Nanjiani, Issa Rae, Paul Sparks, Anna Camp, Kyle Bornheimer\n\n13 of 20\n\nMuriel's Wedding (1994)\n\nToni Collette had her breakthrough role with this quirky Australian dramedy. The actress plays Muriel Heslop, a gawky young woman obsessed with weddings and the promise of escaping her dull life. After being ostracized by her supposed friends, she follows them on a vacation she wasn't invited to, which sets her on a path of finally having the wedding of her dreams — but at what cost? Muriel's Wedding is \"an appealing and expressive film that is truly for everyone,\" writes EW's critic. \"But it's the misunderstood who will love it most.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Muriel's Wedding: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nDirector: P.J. Hogan\n\nCast: Toni Collette, Bill Hunter, Rachel Griffiths\n\n14 of 20\n\nNo Hard Feelings (2023)\n\nWhile No Hard Feelings may have been sold as a raunchy comedy, the film has an underlying sweetness that makes it fit nicely alongside others on this list. But don't get us wrong, the film's setup certainly provides plenty of broad, laugh-out-loud humor: Jennifer Lawrence stars as Maddie, a 32-year-old Uber driver who is desperate for money. She finds a Craiglist ad from a wealthy couple who are hoping to hire a woman to date (and perhaps do more with) their inexperienced 19-year-old son, Percy (Andrew Barth Feldman), before he goes to college. Maddie's attempts to court Percy lead to hilarious results, though they soon come to unexpectedly appreciate each other over the course of the summer.\n\nThe film proves Lawrence's adeptness as a comedic star, fully committing to even the most ludicrous of scenes. \"No Hard Feelings is a welcome addition to a dwindling genre,\" writes EW's critic, \"and a reminder that Lawrence is one Hollywood's best (and funniest) leads.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch No Hard Feelings: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Gene Stupnitsky\n\nCast: Jennifer Lawrence, Andrew Barth Feldman, Laura Benanti, Natalie Morales, Matthew Broderick\n\n15 of 20\n\nQueen Bees (2021)\n\nIn recent years, older actresses have shown off their comedic chops in films such as Book Club, 80 for Brady, and this charming rom-com. Queen Bees stars Ellen Burstyn as an independently minded widow who accidentally burns down her kitchen and has no choice but to enter a retirement community. She has trouble integrating at first, in large part because of the Mean Girls-esque group of \"Queen Bees\" who rule the roost, but she eventually develops a relationship with a new resident played by James Caan in his final onscreen role before his death. While not exactly on the level of Burstyn's classic work in films like The Exorcist and Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, the breezy comedy goes down easy on a relaxing afternoon. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Queen Bees: Netflix\n\nDirector: Michael Lembeck\n\nCast: Ellen Burstyn, James Caan, Ann-Margret, Christopher Lloyd, Jane Curtin, Loretta Devine, Elizabeth Mitchell\n\n16 of 20\n\nReality Bites (1994)\n\nWhat does it mean to be Gen X? Ben Stiller's feature directorial debut is a pretty good approximation, centering on a group of twentysomething college graduates navigating life's disappointments and minor victories in the early-'90s. Lelaina (Winona Ryder), an aspiring filmmaker, documents her friends' lives post-graduation as they deal with crappy bosses and tumultuous experiences with romance. Decades later, Reality Bites is a potent slice of '90s nostalgia. As EW's critic writes, \"Yearning, hilarious, lost within their precocious self-awareness, these slackers have soul.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Reality Bites: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Ben Stiller\n\nCast: Winona Ryder, Ethan Hawke, Ben Stiller, Janeane Garofalo, Steve Zahn, Swoosie Kurtz, Renée Zellweger, Joe Don Baker, John Mahoney\n\n17 of 20\n\nSet It Up (2018)\n\nOverworked assistants Charlie (Glen Powell) and Harper (Zoey Deutch) have a corporate meet-cute in their shared office building when they bond over their demanding, miserable bosses: venture capitalist Rick Otis (Taye Diggs) and sports media maven Kirsten Stevens (Lucy Liu). Desperate to make their jobs (and lives) easier, Charlie and Harper hatch a plan to merge their superiors into a happy power couple. But playing matchmaker might be way above their pay grade.\n\nA romantic comedy in the same vein as The Devil Wears Prada (2006), this film has its fair share of gaslighting, but the twist is its good intentions. Charlie and Harper feel genuine admiration for their successful bosses, and though their motives are self-serving, it's all in the name of love, right? What follows is a satisfying take on the feel-good genre, complete with meditations on work lives, love lives, and everything in between. EW's critic hails Set It Up as the \"gold standard for the frothy summer rom-com,\" and she was right on the money. —A.A.\n\nWhere to watch Set It Up: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Claire Scanlon\n\nCast: Zoey Deutch, Glen Powell, Taye Diggs, Lucy Liu\n\n18 of 20\n\nShe's Gotta Have It (1986)\n\nSpike Lee exploded onto the scene with his 1986 directorial debut. Made for only $175,000, She's Gotta Have It tells the story of Nola (Tracy Camilla Johns), a graphic artist in Brooklyn who juggles relationships with three men, each with their own distinct personalities. The situation becomes complicated after the men meet and figure out what's happening. Meanwhile, Nola comes to realize the value in her freedom as a sexually liberated person. Lauded for its depiction of a confident Black woman at a time when Hollywood rarely centered such characters, She's Gotta Have It proved to be predictive of the kinds of groundbreaking stories Lee would tell in the decades to come. The Oscar-winning filmmaker also adapted the film into a Netflix series in 2017. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch She's Gotta Have It: Netflix\n\nDirector: Spike Lee\n\nCast: Tracy Camilla Johns, Tommy Redmond Hicks, John Canada Terrell, Spike Lee, Raye Dowell\n\n19 of 20\n\nSomeone Great (2019)\n\nThis charming directorial debut by Jennifer Kaytin Robinson proves that break-up movies can make for great rom-coms. Jenny (Gina Rodriguez) lands her dream job at Rolling Stone, but it costs her her longtime boyfriend (LaKeith Stanfield). Desperate for a last hurrah in New York City before her big move, the new bachelorette rallies friends Blair (Brittany Snow) and Erin (DeWanda Wise) to help send her off, though it proves to be anything but a clean break.\n\nThe misadventures of their big night out inspire each woman to reflect on whether they've been choosing their relationships over themselves. The result is an empowering, modern spin on what's expected from the genre, placing sisterhood and self-love at the center stage. Ever the rom-com expert, EW's critic heralds Something Great as \"... a newer breed of movie: the scrappy female-POV in which the love story at the center is as much about friendship or the face in the mirror as it is about any one man.\" —A.A.\n\nWhere to watch Someone Great: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Jennifer Kaytin Robinson\n\nCast: Gina Rodriguez, Brittany Snow, DeWanda Wise, LaKeith Stanfield, Peter Vack\n\n20 of 20\n\nTo All the Boys I've Loved Before (2018)\n\nOne of the better teen rom-coms for the modern age, To All the Boys I've Loved Before was a smashing success for Netflix upon its 2018 release. Lana Condor plays Lara Jean Covey, a high schooler who secretly pens love letters to crushes but never sends them. Her younger sister finds them stashed away and decides to mail them herself, leading to a fair share of awkward situations. To prevent her current crush from initiating yet another cringey confrontation, she impulsively kisses one of her former crushes (Noah Centineo), which proves to be the catalyst for an ever-evolving relationship.\n\nTo All the Boys I've Loved Before was very well-received, with EW's critic calling it \"breezy and charming.\" Netflix released two sequels to the film: To All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You in 2020 and To All the Boys: Always and Forever in 2021, though the original remains the series' best entry. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch To All the Boys I've Loved Before: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Susan Johnson\n\nCast: Lana Condor, Noah Centineo, Janel Parrish, Anna Cathcart, Andrew Bachelor, Trezzo Mahoro, Madeleine Arthur, Emilija Baranac, Israel Broussard, John Corbett"
