        "text": "When I go through a reading slump, it is generally related to how long I need to wait for my next hold to come in on Libby. I read like I eat fast food; it’s incredibly enjoyable in the moment, but not necessarily nourishing, and mainly forgettable. If I get really stuck I switch to podcasts until I get sick of skipping through ads every 20 minutes. Below, I listed a few remedies to the common reading slump. Maybe they strike seasonally, maybe it’s a regular occurrence, or maybe this reading slump is totally out of character. Hopefully, one of these techniques can help shake things loose regardless of why things are slumping.\n\nTry a Novella\n\nNovellas range from 60-120 pages by definition, but I am rounding up to 200 for my purposes. A shorter book will take the perceived pressure off of finishing a novel that tends to be 400 or more pages in length. They say that hunger is the best pickle, but I know for a fact that snacks whet the appetite prior to a meal, too. The same can go for reading.\n\nMr. Majestyk (1974) by Elmore Leonard; 150 pages\n\nLeonard was the best in the business when it came to writing hard-boiled, violent, and near-mythical characters. This novella is one of my favorites, and pits a watermelon farmer against a bunch of extortionate mobster pinecones. If this book holds any appeal, please see Mr. Leonard’s back catalog. It is extensive.\n\nEvery Heart a Doorway (2016) by Seannan McGuire; 176 pages\n\nThis is the first in McGuire’s excellent School for Wayward Children series that is now up to ten books. These interconnected portal fantasies are so gorgeous and compelling, I feel envious of anyone reading them for the first time. McGuire also writes horror novels under the name Mira Grant that are a lot of fun, too.\n\nThe Little Prince (1943) by Antoine de Saint-Exupery; 96 pages\n\nEveryone has had about 80 years to get their hands on this charming and affecting novella. It still fills me with wonder and takes me to a place of imagination that can be hard to access as an adult.\n\nSilver in the Wood (2019) by Emily Tesh; 112 pages\n\nGreen Man British Isles mythology meets a sweet and tender queer romance. This book is beautifully written and absorbing. There’s a part two out to enjoy, as well.\n\nJuvenile Fiction\n\nReturning to the books that made readers out of us in the first place is another way to shake off the cobwebs and light up various dusty brain parts. I was a nascent reader in the 1980s, so many of my formative reads were written before I was born.\n\nJames and the Giant Peach (1961) by Roald Dahl\n\nIt might be time for a re-read to remember why this author is still massively popular decades after his death. James was always a favorite of mine, but The Twits are a close runner-up. That Quentin Crisp illustration work is so primo.\n\nThe Black Stallion (1941) by Walter Farley\n\nThe Black Stallion was one of the first chapter books I read on my own. I’ve reread the book here and there over the years, and to me, it holds up. The writing is good and the story sweeps along at a good clip. Don’t sleep on the 1979 film based on the book, either.\n\nFrom the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler (1967) by EL Konigsburg\n\nTotal nostalgia ball for the Oregon Trail generation. Who among us didn’t spend an inordinate amount of time trying to figure out ways to sneak into and stay in a museum, or a zoo, or a mall after hours? It’s the city kid equivalent to being marooned on a desert island with a spirited Arabian horse.\n\nThe Westing Game (1978) by Ellen Raskin\n\nYes, I’ve written about this book in the past, and yes I will write about it in the future. This is the book at the nexus of my reading life. It fascinated me in ways that no other book has matched, and spurred me on to read for pleasure in a purposeful way. It’s in heavy rotation as recommended reading for book lovers of all ages.\n\nGraphic novels\n\nWhen I was a kid, comic books still had a bad rap and were not readily available at the school library. My old man loved comic books like Dick Tracy and TinTin, so I would read them too. He encouraged me to look at stuff like Art Spiegleman’s Maus when I was in junior high. It expanded my perception of what literature could be and look like. Graphic novels are great for people who would like to read a book from cover to cover, but maybe don’t have hours in the day to devote to it.\n\nFangs (2020) by Sarah Anderson\n\nGet to know a vampire and werewolf as they fall in love. Anderson is an excellent and hilarious illustrator, and this book puts her talents on full display.\n\nFun Home (2006) by Alison Bechdel\n\nThis might be one of the best autobiographical graphic novels of all time. Bechdel recounts her complex childhood and early adulthood through the lens of life at the funeral parlor her family owned and ran. She is a literal genius, and to me, Fun Home is a 21st century must-read.\n\nIce Haven (2005) by Daniel Clowes\n\nA tidy one-off story from the hipster prince of 1990s indie publishing. Clowes is most famous for his seminal title Ghost World, which was turned into a Major Motion Picture, but I prefer this unusual volume. It’s part mystery, part meditation on life in the Midwest, but mostly another fascinating character exploration from a master of sequential art.\n\nTales From the Loop (2014) by Simon Stalenhag\n\nThis is a crowd-funded book that caught on with popular audiences. Tales from the Loop is filled with the most unbelievably beautiful illustrations of a past that never existed, but that we still feel nostalgia for. Also: DINOSAURS.\n\nAll-time classics\n\nIf a book is still in publication years and years after initial release, and still widely loved, chances are it’s worth the time to read. “Classic” can be a very malleable descriptor, by the way. How would you define a classic book?\n\nJane Eyre (1847) by Charlotte Bronte\n\nIt’s not just a good book, it’s GREAT. Many English speakers probably know the story beats just by virtue of living in the world, but letting the book unwind in print is almost spiritual. Sorry for the gushing, but this book is really really good.\n\nThe Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay (2000) by Michael Chabon\n\nTo me, this is one of the more accessible and engaging Pulitzer Prize winners from the last 30 years. I read it when it was first published, and still have vivid memories of entire passages of text. Chabon is known for several highly readable titles like Wonder Boys, and The Yiddish Policeman’s Union that I freely and often recommend.\n\nThe Count of Monte Cristo (1844) by Alexander Dumas\n\nWho doesn’t adore epic tales of revenge spanning decades? This book can still be found in practically any library, book store, and thrift shop in half the world. It has staying power for a reason.\n\nThe Catcher in the Rye (1951) by JD Salinger\n\nWhile this may be a divisive suggestion, the work of JD Salinger changed my life. To me, he defines the ennui, despair, and dissatisfaction that has been percolating through the country since World War II. I read this book as soon as I understood how nervous the story made mid-20th century parents. I didn’t understand all the pearl-clutching, but I DID understand that this was literature, and something different than what I had been reading before.\n\nMurderbot\n\nThe ultimate solution for smashing that reading slump is to read Martha Wells’ Murderbot Diaries. They are the best books ever written in the history of the written language. Sorry to you James Baldwin, William Shakespeare, and Annie Proulx, but Martha has you all beat. Start with All Systems Red and thank me later for curing your depression and anxiety.\n\nStill feeling uncertain about what to read? Consider using Mead’s Your Next Five Books reader’s advisory tool.

To help cut through the noise and abundance, I listed several common vacation locations and which books might be best in each case. Book descriptions are sourced from the publisher.\n\nThe Woods (books to freak you out while camping)\n\nLittle Heaven (2017) by Nick Cutter\n\nA trio of mismatched mercenaries is hired by a young woman for a deceptively simple task: check in on her nephew, who may have been taken against his will to a remote New Mexico backwoods settlement called Little Heaven. Shortly after they arrive, things begin to turn ominous. Stirrings in the woods and over the treetops—the brooding shape of a monolith known as the Black Rock casts its terrible pall. Paranoia and distrust grips the settlement. The escape routes are gradually cut off as events spiral towards madness. Hell—or the closest thing to it—invades Little Heaven. The remaining occupants are forced to take a stand and fight back, but whatever has cast its dark eye on Little Heaven is now marshaling its powers…and it wants them all.\n\nThe Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon (1999) by Stephen King\n\nOn a six-mile hike on the Maine-New Hampshire branch of the Appalachian Trail, nine-year-old Trisha McFarland quickly tires of the constant bickering between her older brother, Pete, and her recently divorced mother. But when she wanders off by herself and then tries to catch up by attempting a shortcut, she becomes lost in a wilderness maze full of peril and terror.\n\nAs night falls, Trisha has only her ingenuity as a defense against the elements, and only her courage and faith to withstand her mounting fears. For solace, she tunes her Walkman to broadcasts of Boston Red Sox baseball games and follows the gritty performances of her hero, relief pitcher Tom Gordon. And when her radio’s reception begins to fade, Trisha imagines that Tom Gordon is with her – protecting her from an all-too-real enemy who has left a trail of slaughtered animals and mangled trees in the dense, dark woods…\n\nThornhedge (2023) by T. Kingfisher\n\nThere’s a princess trapped in a tower. This isn’t her story.\n\nMeet Toadling. On the day of her birth, she was stolen from her family by the fairies, but she grew up safe and loved in the warm waters of faerieland. Once an adult though, the fae ask a favor of Toadling: return to the human world and offer a blessing of protection to a newborn child. Simple, right?\n\nBut nothing with fairies is ever simple.\n\nCenturies later, a knight approaches a towering wall of brambles, where the thorns are as thick as your arm and as sharp as swords. He’s heard there’s a curse here that needs breaking, but it’s a curse Toadling will do anything to uphold…\n\nThe Beach (mysteries best read on the beach)\n\nRum Punch (1992) by Elmore Leonard\n\nOrdell Robbie makes a fine living selling illegal high-powered weaponry to the wrong people. Jackie Burke couriers Ordell’s profits from Freeport to Miami. But the feds are on to Jackie – and now the aging, but still hot, flight attendant will have to do prison time or play ball, which makes her a prime ‘loose end’ that Ordell needs to tie up … permanently.\n\nJackie, however, has other plans. And with the help of Max Cherry – an honest but disgruntled bail bondsman looking to get out – she could even end up with a serious nest egg in the process.\n\nThe Lost Girls of Penzance (2023) by Sally Rigby\n\nDetective Lauren Pengelly has only been part of the Penzance police force for less than two years, but that’s enough time to know that the sleepy Cornish town doesn’t see many murders. So, when the bones of a woman with a hole in her skull are discovered behind a derelict cottage, she immediately assumes the worst.\n\nFortune Favors the Dead (2020) by Stephen Spotswood\n\nIt’s 1942 and Willowjean “Will” Parker is a scrappy circus runaway whose knife-throwing skills have just saved the life of New York’s best, and most unorthodox, private investigator, Lillian Pentecost. When the dapper detective summons Will a few days later, she doesn’t expect to be offered a life-changing proposition: Lillian’s multiple sclerosis means she can’t keep up with her old case load alone, so she wants to hire Will to be her right-hand woman. In return, Will is to receive a salary, room and board, and training in Lillian’s very particular art of investigation.\n\nThe City (books to read on vacation in a city)\n\nThe Indifferent Stars Above (2009) by Daniel J. Brown\n\nIn April of 1846, twenty-one-year-old Sarah Graves, intent on a better future, set out west from Illinois with her new husband, her parents, and eight siblings. Seven months later, after joining a party of emigrants led by George Donner, they reached the Sierra Nevada Mountains as the first heavy snows of the season closed the pass ahead of them. In early December, starving and desperate, Sarah and fourteen others set out for California on snowshoes and, over the next thirty-two days, endured almost unfathomable hardships and horrors.\n\nIn this gripping narrative, Daniel James Brown sheds new light on one of the most infamous events in American history. Following every painful footstep of Sarah’s journey with the Donner Party, Brown produces a tale both spellbinding and richly informative.\n\nThe Library Book (2018) by Susan Orlean\n\nOn the morning of April 29, 1986, a fire alarm sounded in the Los Angeles Public Library. As the moments passed, the patrons and staff who had been cleared out of the building realized this was not the usual fire alarm. As one fireman recounted, “Once that first stack got going, it was ‘Goodbye, Charlie.’” The fire was disastrous: it reached 2000 degrees and burned for more than seven hours. By the time it was extinguished, it had consumed four hundred thousand books and damaged seven hundred thousand more. Investigators descended on the scene, but more than thirty years later, the mystery remains: Did someone purposefully set fire to the library—and if so, who?\n\nThe City We Became (2020) by NK Jemisin\n\nFive New Yorkers must come together in order to defend their city.\n\nEvery city has a soul. Some are as ancient as myths, and others are as new and destructive as children. New York City? She’s got five.\n\nBut every city also has a dark side. A roiling, ancient evil stirs beneath the earth, threatening to destroy the city and her five protectors unless they can come together and stop it once and for all.\n\nStaycation (books to help you dream of where to go next)\n\nMidnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (1994) by John Berendt\n\nShots rang out in Savannah’s grandest mansion in the misty, early morning hours of May 2, 1981. Was it murder or self-defense? For nearly a decade, the shooting and its aftermath reverberated throughout this city of moss-hung oaks and shaded squares. John Berendt’s narrative reads like a thoroughly engrossing novel, and yet it is a work of nonfiction. Berendt interweaves a first-person account of life in this isolated remnant of the Old South with the unpredictable twists and turns of a landmark murder case.\n\nMy Brilliant Friend (2011) by Elena Ferrante\n\nA modern masterpiece from one of Italy’s most acclaimed authors, My Brilliant Friend is a rich, intense and generous-hearted story about two friends, Elena and Lila. Ferrante’s inimitable style lends itself perfectly to a meticulous portrait of these two women that is also the story of a nation and a touching meditation on the nature of friendship. Through the lives of these two women, Ferrante tells the story of a neighborhood, a city and a country as it is transformed in ways that, in turn, also transform the relationship between her two protagonists.\n\nThe Travels of Marco Polo (1298) by Marco Polo\n\nMarco Polo (1254-1329) has achieved an almost archetypal status as a traveler, and his Travels is one of the first great travel books of Western literature, outside the ancient world. The Travels recounts Polo’s journey to the eastern court of Kublai Khan, the chieftain of the Mongol empire which covered the Asian continent, but which was almost unknown to Polo’s contemporaries. Encompassing a twenty-four year period from 1271, Polo’s account details his travels in the service of the empire, from Beijing to northern India and ends with the remarkable story of Polo’s return voyage from the Chinese port of Amoy to the Persian Gulf. Alternately factual and fantastic, Polo’s prose at once reveals the medieval imagination’s limits, and captures the wonder of subsequent travel writers when faced with the unfamiliar, the exotic or the unknown.\n\nAll of the books I have listed above are available in the Monarch catalog, often in a variety of formats.

I fought the boredom of the long drive by listening to audio books on CD. I had been getting into mysteries and knew that Agatha Christie was one of the big names in that genre. My journey began by picking up The Mysterious Affair at Styles (narrated by Hugh Fraser, who stars as Hastings in the Poirot TV show.) From that mystery I was hooked and needed more of the little Belgian detective and his excitable sidekick. After moving to Sheboygan a few years ago I switched from audiobook to paperback, the voices from the audio series still in my head for the various main characters. I finally came to the end of my journey with Hercule Poirot this past week with finishing the final book: Curtain. What a worthy ending to a great series and brilliant detective!\n\nThe Hercule Poirot Series by Agatha Christie\n\nAgatha Christie started writing her Poirot series in 1916 and had the first novel published in 1920. While the series is of the mystery genre it is fascinating as it provides a window into the time period it was written in. The series kicks off with Captain Hastings coming home with a war injury. WWI and WWII are not the focus of the books, but the impact of the wars are clearly seen throughout the series. From a historical standpoint it is interesting to get a glimpse of how WWII was affecting the English people as they tried to continue with their daily lives. This is most clearly shown in the title Taken at the Flood in which Poirot casually waits in a bomb shelter during a raid and listens to a stranger discuss a suspicious death. The series continues into the 1960’s where they provide a glimpse into the changing times and culture of that era. As I enjoy historical fiction as well, I found this element to be just as engaging as they mysteries themselves.\n\nThe mysteries kept me guessing from beginning to end. If you are a fan of mysteries like myself, you probably find yourself trying to solve it before the detective by the end. As for this series, just when I thought I had the system figured out, there would be some huge twist that I certainly was not expecting. If you are a fan of twist endings the book I most recommend in this series is The Murder of Roger Ackroyd as I believe that book had the biggest twist of the lot.\n\nAs for the characters, after the first book it felt as if they were already friends I had known for ages. Captain Hastings is young. He has a hopeless romantic personality and always tries to see the bright side of life. He is Poirot’s best friend and sidekick in the early books. In the later books Poirot meets Ariadne Oliver, the author of a mystery fiction series. She is also a lot of fun and has a quirky personality. Due to her fame as a writer of mystery fiction in the series, she ends up getting caught up in real murder mysteries and often has to come seek out Poirot for help. Hercule Poirot is of course the main hero of the series. He is a short Belgian detective who is known for his impressive mustache. He believes that any mystery can be solved by “using the little grey cells”. A student of psychology and the study of human nature, Poirot uses this to figure out the connections and motives in cases. It is interesting to see how the human mind works from his point of view. He has a very analytical mind which often plays against Hastings’ more fantastic theories. Poirot is a very immaculate person with an obsession for symmetry. These quirks provide often needed humor and serve to make him a rather endearing character in addition to helping him notice anything suspiciously out of place while solving a crime.\n\nI started trying to compile a list of favorite titles to share in this article. Going back over each book I realized that I loved almost all of them. Elephants Can Remember seemed perhaps the weakest of them as Poirot did not seem to be in it as much as I would have liked. However that title comes right at the end before Curtain. Curtain, being the last novel, finished the series with a bang! (No pun intended). I was very satisfied with the ending and felt Agatha Christie did right by her characters and the series to wrap it up in the way she did.\n\nNow that I have finished the book series I have been binge watching the TV show Poirot staring David Suchet and Hugh Fraser. I find it to be just as good as the books! There have also been three new movies based on Poirot books (A Haunting in Venice VERY loosely based.). The movies star Kenneth Branagh. You can also listen to Agatha Christie’s Poirot series on audio. When I first started searching for audio, I found there are a few different voice narrators. I recommend finding the set narrated by Hugh Fraser. He does the best in doing the various voices and pulling the reader into the story. Of course, you can also find all the titles in book format at the library or through our online catalogue. Happy reading!\n\nHercule Poirot books in order:\n\n1. The Mysterious Affair at Styles\n\n2.

There is so much great content I can barely make up my mind when it comes to choosing something to watch. Below, I listed several dynamic pictures to suit many tastes and aesthetics. Gather your friends, your family, and the snacks you love. Pull on your jim jams, get comfy, and enjoy the miracle of light that is moving pictures.\n\nClassic movie night:\n\nThe Outlaw (1943) starring Jane Russel and directed by Howard Hughes\n\nThis is a Billy the Kid story, but the only thing people remember about this movie is Hughes’ supposedly engineered a bra to make sure Russel’s prominent chest was as chesty as a chest could ever boob. While Hughes may have applied his airplane smarts to brassiere design, the resulting garment was uncomfortable to the point of excessive pain. Russel would wear a regular bra and tell Hughes she was fitted in the monstrosity of his design. He wasn’t going to check, after all. No, I do not care if this story is apocryphal.\n\nThe Stranger (1946) written, directed by, and starring Orson Welles\n\nOne of Welles’ lesser known, but greatly enjoyable noir pictures. Welles plays a former Nazi supervillain who has disguised himself as a small New England town boy’s school teacher. He has to do a murder real quick to hide his true identity, which attracts the attention of a tenacious Edward G. Robinson, a man who prosecutes war criminals for the UN. A tense and entertaining game of cat and mouse ensues.\n\nSunset Boulevard (1950) starring Gloria Swanson and directed by Billy Wilder\n\nI don’t think it’s hyperbolic to call this one of the great pictures of the 20th century. We see the herald of old Hollywood colliding with new that wouldn’t actually happen for another 20 years. Here, the narrative is driven by the effects of film transitioning from silent to talkies a further 20 years prior. Blink and you’ll miss “wax work” stars like Buster Keaton and H.B. Warner portraying themselves. Eric Von Stroheim, the legendary and unfairly maligned silent picture director, stuns as Norma Desmond’s protective manservant. Mark your calendars and join the Movie Club discussion of this film at 8th Street Ale Haus on Thursday, August 15 2024.\n\nFamily movie night:\n\nThe Adventures of Prince Achmed (1926) directed by Lotte Reiniger\n\nGorgeous, meticulous animation using cut paper techniques of the Victorians. This may be slightly slow-moving for the very littles, but could be a good show to put on when it’s winding down to sleepy time.\n\nThe Water Horse (2007) directed by Jay Russell\n\nDelightful fantasy adventure with lots of cryptid action. This is based on a book of the same name by author Dick King-Smith. Wouldn’t it be fun to read this book as a family before you watch the movie? You could compare and contrast and decide which you like better and why.\n\nKedi: The Cats of an Ancient City (2016) directed by Ceyda Torun\n\nEnflame your family’s itch to travel with this charmer. The ancient city of Istanbul is famous for its numerous stray cats who are cared for by many but owned by none. Learn the reason why as the filmmaker follows seven different cats throughout their respective days.\n\nHorror movie night:\n\nBattle Royale (2000) directed by Kinji Fukasaku\n\nThis is not a horror movie in the same vein as say, your Friday the 13ths or your Paranormal Activities or whatever, but it IS horrific. The film begins with a bus full of Japanese school kids getting gassed. They awake on an island, surrounded by various weapons. The group learns that only one person will be allowed to leave the island, and they have to do so by killing everyone else. Sometimes these high-concept films lose momentum or have muddy plots, but Battle Royale is as sharp and deadly in action and dialogue as the day it came out. Super creepy, exciting, and unforgettable. This is based on a very successful book of the same name.\n\nHouse on Haunted Hill (1959) starring Vincent Price and directed by William Castle\n\nThis little oddball is an incredible cultural time capsule. Watch it straight on Kanopy to appreciate the scenery-chewing of a marvelous Vincent Price and the campy special effects. After that, check out this Rifftrax DVD. Rifftrax is where the boys from Mystery Science Theater 3000 took their brand of movie house heckling after the original cable show got canceled. They are joined by a razor sharp and always hilarious Paul F. Tompkins as they heckle, lampoon, mock, and adore House on Haunted Hill.\n\nNight of the Living Dead (1968) directed by George Romero\n\nThis film is foundational to almost all other horror movies to follow. The low budget thrills are still effective, and often shocking. Tom Savini did a remake in 1990, and his monster makeup effects are so good you can practically smell them (so, SO glad you cannot). The remake also addresses the weakest aspect of the original: Barbara’s ineffectiveness. The 1990 Barbara takes action against the ravening hordes and is such a total badass. Original Barbara is panicking and weak when she’s not outright catatonic. This diminishes my personal enjoyment of Romero’s otherwise extremely entertaining film, but then again I have seen it approximately five thousand times.\n\nWildcard night:\n\nIn the Heat of the Night (1967) starring Rod Steiger and Sidney Poitier\n\nI recently read the excellent and extraordinary 2008 book Pictures at a Revolution by Mark Harris. The author does a deep dive into how the five 1968 Best Picture nominees came to be and what they signified for Hollywood’s trajectory. It made me feel desperate to re-watch In the Heat of the Night, which won the Best Picture Oscar of that year, so imagine my delight when I found it streaming on Kanopy, and not a single other streaming service for free.\n\nHot Rod (2007) starring Andy Samberg and directed by Akiva Shaffer\n\nThe character of Hot Rod is himself, a wild card. Turn your brain off and let your mouth go slack. Let those silly Lonely Island boys take you on an adventure so unusual, many of the principal actors said they “did not understand” what the movie was about up to and past its release date.\n\nRumble in the Bronx (1995) starring Jackie Chan\n\nHave you ever heard of a cooler movie title?! This was Jackie Chan’s breakout crossover hit for American audiences. He’d already been making movies in Hong Kong for like 20 years up to this point, and this is one of his best. Known for mind-boggling action pieces, and tightly choreographed fight sequences, it’s not hard to understand how this picture won over American audiences and increased the already blazing light of Chan’s international celebrity.\n\nAll of the films I mentioned above are available for checkout on Kanopy as of April 26th, 2024, but may be subject to change over time as the lineup can shift from month to month. In fact, when I REALLY can’t make up my mind about what I would like to watch, I go to the “leaving this month” category and choose something I won’t have access to for long. I think the urgency helps me make a choice.\n\nI linked each title to the Monarch catalog DVD listing, if one prefers physical media. Click the link to see the listing which also tends to include a brief description.\n\nStill not finding something you’re excited to watch? Please consider using Mead’s Your Next Five Movies service by clicking HERE. Share some of your favorites with us and we’ll send you five movie titles you might love. We are always happy, nay, THRILLED to help people find the library material they love whether it’s books, movies, music or something else. Baking tool collection, anyone?\n\nOne thing I love about working as a librarian is the ability to provide classic services and programs. It doesn’t get much classic-er than the good ol’ book club.\n\nWe here at Mead run a variety of book clubs to suit an array of tastes and interests. We also provide circulating book kits (six to twelve copies of one title) available for public checkout. Below, I listed a few book club themes along with some titles that would make for excellent discussions in each category.\n\nMystery Club\n\nMead already has a fantastic mystery book club called Moonlight and Murder. Meetings occur every other month at The Black Pig. It’s a long-established group that even COVID could not defeat.\n\nSince mysteries are my main jam, I thought it couldn’t hurt to list some of the best books in this genre that I’ve encountered lately. The mystery titles I picked are highly sought-after new releases that all came out within the last year.\n\nNone of This is True (2023) by Lisa Jewell; excellent use of the unreliable narrator trope. I had to read this as fast as possible or I would have lost my mind.\n\nBright Young Women (2023) by Jessica Knoll; a feminist and fictionalized account of a famous 1979 Florida sorority house murder spree that focuses on the victims and not the booger-eating alcoholic dipshit who committed the crimes. Important AND infuriating.\n\nThe Frozen River (2023) by Ariel Lawhon; easily one of the best books I have read in the past 10 years. It’s based on the real-life diaries of 18th century midwife Martha Ballard. Her diary is in circulation, too. Books featuring elements of pregnancy and childbirth are usually off-putting to me, but this was different. This made me feel how powerful we can be as women, and reminded me not to take for granted all the gains we’ve made socially, politically, and professionally over the intervening two hundred years.\n\nThe Teacher (2024) by Freida McFadden; if you’re not familiar with McFadden’s brand of bonkers, you are in for a treat. In this book, everyone is making terrible choices all the time and no one is very likable, which makes the comeuppance all the more delicious. Messy messy messy.\n\nFilm Criticism Club\n\nI run a movie club. It’s awesome. We watch a movie on our own and come together to discuss as a group, just like a book club. Join us at 8th Street Ale Haus third Thursdays to see what I mean.\n\nFilm is a particular interest of mine, and I have been encountering more and more film writing and criticism when I prepare for a movie club meeting. This list represents some high points of film writing from over the last few decades, while still being accessible to popular audiences. Doesn’t that sound like a fun book club? I KNOW!!!!!\n\nLife Itself: a Memoir (2011) by Roger Ebert; I love him. I LOVE HIM. Fascinating man living through fascinating times. The passages about trying to interview Robert Mitchum made me laugh so hard I cried, and that’s just the first thing that comes to mind. The world is a poorer place without my beloved Ebert. “Movies are like a machine that generates empathy.”\n\nPictures at a Revolution: Five Movies and the Birth of New Hollywood (2008) by Mark Harris; inventive breakdown that uses the five 1967 Best Picture nominees- Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner; The Graduate; In the Heat of the Night; Doctor Doolittle; and Bonnie and Clyde to examine the transition from Old Hollywood to New that came to pass in the late 1960s.\n\nFor Keeps (1994) by Pauline Kael; one of the more important and original voices in 20th century film criticism. Her opinions often contradicted prevalent voices of the day. She was famous for only ever watching a picture once before reviewing it.\n\nCinema Speculation (2022) by Quentin Tarantino; it doesn’t matter how you feel about his oeuvre, this man loves movies and his enthusiasm only serves the medium. Tarantino literally grew up in Los Angeles movie houses when his mother started bringing him along at the age of seven in 1970. He formats this book into ten chapters, one for each year of the 1970s, and focuses on one film for each year as a departure point to expound on.\n\nYA Book Club, but for adults\n\nAbout one out of four books I read could be considered Young Adult. This genre label is more useful as a tool to identify reading level as opposed to quality, with the understanding that reading really is ageless. Some among us have knee-jerk reactions to material produced for a younger audience, but fellas, y’all are missing out when avoiding YA and juvenile material.\n\nThe books I listed are all titles I encountered as a whole adult. Most shattered me emotionally, in the best way possible (looking at you, The Outsiders). Another thing they all have in common are killer plotlines, accessible prose, and relatable depictions of memorable characters.\n\nThe True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle (1990) by Avi; o! To be a 13-year-old girl matching wits with an amoral ship’s captain on the high seas in the mid-19th century!\n\nThe Perks of Being a Wallflower (1999) by Stephen Chbosky; remember what it was like to feel ugly, vulnerable, beautiful, and powerful all at once? This story helps to remember.\n\nThe Outsiders (1967) by S.E. Hinton; this book made me sob real tears. What a beautiful story, which still resonates with readers old and new, fifty years later.\n\nGhost (2016) by Jason Reynolds; part one of the Track series. If I had the time and inclination I would assign all four volumes of this series for an adult book discussion. Each novella highlights one of four members of a junior high track team, and each stands alone as narratives. The real magic lies within the intertwining and deepening of the stories with each successive installment. If you haven’t read any Jason Reynolds at all yet, what are you even doing? One of the best YA writers in all the land, maybe ever.\n\nHorror Book Club\n\nAt one time I thought I did not like horror fiction, but then I saw some best-of lists, and it turns out I have read a lot of horror fiction. Once I realized my affinity for the genre, I started cultivating my own best-of list. Mead does not have a horror book club! Maybe you should start one!\n\nHere are some of my favorites that could work great in a book club scenario:\n\nMy Heart is a Chainsaw (2021) by Stephen Graham Jones; this truly upsetting love letter to slasher films is proof positive that Jones is one of the foremost voices in modern horror lit. Lots to discuss here, from treatment of indigenous people to family dynamics and mental health. Don’t worry, the library owns most of the slasher movies mentioned in this book.\n\nRing Shout (2020) by P. Djeli Clark; what if the racist 1915 film Birth of a Nation caused actual demons to walk the earth? This book freaked me out bad, but in the hands of a writer as talented as Clark, it was tough to put down.\n\nThe Hollow Places (2020) by T. Kingfisher; this author is a particular favorite of mine, so I write about her a lot. Kingfisher has a way of tilting the world off kilter just so. Atmospheric, humorous, and unexpectedly gooey at times (I mean like, people turn into goo, not emotionally-speaking), no one does horror like this.\n\nHow to Sell a Haunted House (2023) by Grady Hendrix; this guy has been cranking out bangers since 2016’s My Best Friend’s Exorcism. In How to Sell a Haunted House, Hendrix brings actual scares and dread to his take on grief portrayed as a haunted house. Most of the work in his back catalog would work great for a book club discussion, too.\n\nHonorable mention YA/Horror Book Club crossover:\n\nClown in a Cornfield (2020) by Adam Cesare; thinly veiled criticism of the MAGA crowd that imagines what would happen if conservatives straight up started murdering people they didn’t align with politically. Super violent and grody, this book practically has a smell to it. Despite all that, it is such a lot of fun to read if you love slasher fiction as much as I do.\n\nWhile I personally dislike reading on a schedule (hence running movie club which only cuts into two hours of my leisure time as opposed to several), many thrive on it. My goal was to provide a starting point and some solid book picks for those who are interested in running their own book group. Figure out a venue and some snacks, and a charming evening awaits.\n\nDon’t want to start your own book group? Consider attending one of ours. Click the links to see current book picks (as of March 28, 2024), meeting locations, and timings:\n\nNon-Fiction Book Discussion; second Mondays\n\nIn the Weeds Book Club; second Thursdays\n\nFiction Book Discussion Group; third Mondays\n\nMaywood Nature-Based Book Club; first Saturdays\n\nSheboygan County LGBTQ Alliance Book Club; first Thursdays\n\nMoonlight and Murder; every other fourth Wednesday\n\nRomance on the Rocks; every other fourth Wednesday\n\nBook to Art Club; second Thursdays\n\nMovie Club; third Thursdays\n\nWhat is your deepest-held reading habit? Mine is that I don’t force myself to power through any book that I am not enjoying. My to-be-read list is several hundred books deep, so why would I waste my leisure time struggling? Below, I listed several books that many, many, many other readers loved with their whole hearts, but I personally could not bear, and what I would read instead. Proceed with caution as I included some light spoilers.\n\nThe Moonstone (1868) by Wilkie Collins\n\nWhy I thought I would enjoy this book:\n\nThis doorstop of a novel is often considered the first English-language detective story. I love mystery fiction above all genres and I like to spend time looking for and reading titles that are considered ground-breaking or otherwise important to the genre.\n\nWhat went wrong:\n\nBooks written over one hundred years ago often contain outdated and offensive language that would have been common at the time, or certainly not considered shocking. The titular Moonstone is an object of value taken by theft from a rich Indian household during the British Raj. People from India are depicted throughout the book in a racist light, which ruined any enjoyment of the actual plot and non-stereotyped characters. I wasn’t too hot with the depiction of women, either. Save yourself ten hours of reading and look up the Wikipedia plot summary. Please do not tell my library school professors that I told you to do this.\n\nClassic detective fiction I would rather read:\n\nThe Winteringham Murder (1927) by Anthony Berkeley\n\nThe Thin Man (1933) by Dashiel Hammet\n\nA Rage in Harlem (1957) by Chester Himes\n\nThe Honjin Murders (1946) by Seishi Yokomizo\n\nNOS4A2 (2013) by Joe Hill\n\nWhy I thought I would enjoy this book:\n\nJoe Hill has horror pedigree. He’s Stephen King’s son for one thing, and several of his books routinely appear on “best horror novel” lists. I like vampire stories, and Hill’s take on the genre was intriguing.\n\nWhat went wrong:\n\nAlthough I have read my fair share of skin-crawling horror novels, there was something about the tension running throughout this book that kept my ears up around my shoulders for DAYS after I put the book down for good. This happened at a point in the story in which the protagonist has a retrograde moment after years of progress from dealing with an unnamable supernatural evil, and my poor little heart could not take the suspense. This should be understood as a resounding endorsement of the book.\n\nWhat I would rather read instead:\n\nThe Southern Book Club’s Guide to Slaying Vampires (2020) by Grady Hendrix\n\n‘Salem’s Lot (1975) by Stephen King\n\nWhat Moves the Dead (2022) by T. Kingfisher\n\nI am Legend (1954) by Richard Matheson\n\nBigfoot and the Librarian (2019) by Linda Winstead Jones\n\nWhy I thought I would enjoy this book:\n\nA librarian moves to a rural area for work and begins to discover her service area is populated with actual bigfoots and other mythical creatures. Hilarity/inappropriate romance ensues.\n\nWhat went wrong:\n\nBeing a librarian my own self, it was obvious to me that the author was not of my cohort, and did not understand libraries or librarians. The protagonist was short, so she was fixated on wearing heels and at one time implied only unintelligent women eat carbs. Firstly, I’ve worked in libraries for a total of seven years, and I can assure you that our preferred footwear is geared toward comfort rather than style. Secondly, oh please piss off with your anti-carb food gatekeeping. Everyone knows carbs are the tastiest foods, don’t you dare tell me otherwise.\n\nBooks featuring libraries and librarians I would rather read:\n\nThe Secret, Book, & Scone Society (2017) by Ellery Adams\n\nThe Librarian of Crooked Lane (2022) by C.J. Archer\n\nThe Name of the Rose (1980) by Umberto Eco\n\nThe Woman in the Library (2022) by Sulari Gentill\n\nThe Woods are Always Watching (2021) by Stephanie Perkins\n\nWhy I thought I would enjoy this book:\n\nStephanie Perkins’ 2017 title There’s Someone Inside Your House was a tight, creepy, effective teen slasher novel that I really enjoyed. It’s also a fun title to shriek at your friends. Try it, you’ll like it. This led me to believe the 2021 followup The Woods are Always Watching would be more of the same. Plus, I love books with spooky woods shit.\n\nWhat went wrong:\n\nBoth teen girl protagonists were insufferable. So insufferable, in fact, that I decided to look up the plot summary on Wikipedia (as I do) to determine if the initial aggravation was worth it. It turned out that a major plot point involves one of the insufferable girls falling into a hole in the woods and breaking her leg. This mattered a lot to me, because I had suffered a pretty bad leg break days before I picked up this book. Reading about someone else’s pain and trauma did not sound like the light-hearted escapism I needed, so this book went straight into my DNF pile.\n\nWhat I would recommend instead for those who also enjoy stories with spooky woods shit:\n\nSmall Spaces (2018) by Katherine Arden\n\nNear the Bone (2021) by Christina Henry (TW for domestic abuse and cryptids)\n\nThe Box in the Woods (2021) by Maureen Johnson\n\nThe Twisted Ones (2019) and The Hollow Places (2020) by T. Kingfisher (I REALLY like her)\n\nMistborn (2006) by Brandon Sanderson\n\nWhy I thought I would enjoy this book:\n\nSanderson is a big name in fantasy fiction, and several of my workmates adore his oeuvre. An informal survey pointed towards this series as a good entry point to Sanderson’s deep back catalog.\n\nWhat went wrong:\n\nBefore the Sanderson stans come after me with their pitchforks and torches, please understand that I can DNF a book and still understand its cultural and historical import; see The Moonstone above. Perhaps Lord of the Rings ruined me for all other high fantasy, but I simply could not muster the enthusiasm needed to care about the rag-tag group of underdogs and the Very Special Boy at the center of the story.\n\nFantasy books I would rather read instead:\n\nSorcerer to the Crown (2015) by Zen Cho\n\nRing Shout (2020) by P. Djeli Clark\n\nPet (2019) by Akwaeke Emezi\n\nMiddlegame (2019) by Seanan McGuire\n\nDial A for Aunties (2021) by Jesse Q. Sutanto\n\nWhy I thought I would enjoy this book:\n\nI was looking forward to this one. The premise reads like Weekend at Bernie’s meets Crazy Rich Asians; what could go wrong?\n\nWhat went wrong:\n\nOne major trope I despise in any of the media I consume are circumstances that would never happen if at least one person involved were an effective communicator. Incredibly unappealing trope. This book was full of these situations from top to bottom. Although the characters are admittedly charming, I could not cope with the screwball nature of it all.\n\nWhat I would prefer to read instead:\n\nThe Stranger Diaries (2018) by Elly Griffiths\n\nArsenic and Adobo (2021) by Mia P. Manansala\n\nThe Very Secret Society of Irregular Witches (2022) by Sangu Mandanna\n\nThe Guncle (2021) by Steven Rowley\n\nHey, maybe you are the kind of reader who enjoys difficulty or discomfort while you read. I know John Waters is this type of reader, and I really respect his approach (check out his fantastic collection of essays, Role Models, to learn what I mean. Audio copy available in Hoopla). And that’s cool, I do not judge the hows and the whys surrounding individual reading habits. It’s if you don’t read at all, that’s when I start to reassess one’s character.\n\nIf none of the above books come across as appealing, and you are still unsure what to read next, you’re in luck.
