        "text": "When I go through a reading slump, it is generally related to how long I need to wait for my next hold to come in on Libby. I read like I eat fast food; it’s incredibly enjoyable in the moment, but not necessarily nourishing, and mainly forgettable. If I get really stuck I switch to podcasts until I get sick of skipping through ads every 20 minutes. Below, I listed a few remedies to the common reading slump. Maybe they strike seasonally, maybe it’s a regular occurrence, or maybe this reading slump is totally out of character. Hopefully, one of these techniques can help shake things loose regardless of why things are slumping.\n\nTry a Novella\n\nNovellas range from 60-120 pages by definition, but I am rounding up to 200 for my purposes. A shorter book will take the perceived pressure off of finishing a novel that tends to be 400 or more pages in length. They say that hunger is the best pickle, but I know for a fact that snacks whet the appetite prior to a meal, too. The same can go for reading.\n\nMr. Majestyk (1974) by Elmore Leonard; 150 pages\n\nLeonard was the best in the business when it came to writing hard-boiled, violent, and near-mythical characters. This novella is one of my favorites, and pits a watermelon farmer against a bunch of extortionate mobster pinecones. If this book holds any appeal, please see Mr. Leonard’s back catalog. It is extensive.\n\nEvery Heart a Doorway (2016) by Seannan McGuire; 176 pages\n\nThis is the first in McGuire’s excellent School for Wayward Children series that is now up to ten books. These interconnected portal fantasies are so gorgeous and compelling, I feel envious of anyone reading them for the first time. McGuire also writes horror novels under the name Mira Grant that are a lot of fun, too.\n\nThe Little Prince (1943) by Antoine de Saint-Exupery; 96 pages\n\nEveryone has had about 80 years to get their hands on this charming and affecting novella. It still fills me with wonder and takes me to a place of imagination that can be hard to access as an adult.\n\nSilver in the Wood (2019) by Emily Tesh; 112 pages\n\nGreen Man British Isles mythology meets a sweet and tender queer romance. This book is beautifully written and absorbing. There’s a part two out to enjoy, as well.\n\nJuvenile Fiction\n\nReturning to the books that made readers out of us in the first place is another way to shake off the cobwebs and light up various dusty brain parts. I was a nascent reader in the 1980s, so many of my formative reads were written before I was born.\n\nJames and the Giant Peach (1961) by Roald Dahl\n\nIt might be time for a re-read to remember why this author is still massively popular decades after his death. James was always a favorite of mine, but The Twits are a close runner-up. That Quentin Crisp illustration work is so primo.\n\nThe Black Stallion (1941) by Walter Farley\n\nThe Black Stallion was one of the first chapter books I read on my own. I’ve reread the book here and there over the years, and to me, it holds up. The writing is good and the story sweeps along at a good clip. Don’t sleep on the 1979 film based on the book, either.\n\nFrom the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler (1967) by EL Konigsburg\n\nTotal nostalgia ball for the Oregon Trail generation. Who among us didn’t spend an inordinate amount of time trying to figure out ways to sneak into and stay in a museum, or a zoo, or a mall after hours? It’s the city kid equivalent to being marooned on a desert island with a spirited Arabian horse.\n\nThe Westing Game (1978) by Ellen Raskin\n\nYes, I’ve written about this book in the past, and yes I will write about it in the future. This is the book at the nexus of my reading life. It fascinated me in ways that no other book has matched, and spurred me on to read for pleasure in a purposeful way. It’s in heavy rotation as recommended reading for book lovers of all ages.\n\nGraphic novels\n\nWhen I was a kid, comic books still had a bad rap and were not readily available at the school library. My old man loved comic books like Dick Tracy and TinTin, so I would read them too. He encouraged me to look at stuff like Art Spiegleman’s Maus when I was in junior high. It expanded my perception of what literature could be and look like. Graphic novels are great for people who would like to read a book from cover to cover, but maybe don’t have hours in the day to devote to it.\n\nFangs (2020) by Sarah Anderson\n\nGet to know a vampire and werewolf as they fall in love. Anderson is an excellent and hilarious illustrator, and this book puts her talents on full display.\n\nFun Home (2006) by Alison Bechdel\n\nThis might be one of the best autobiographical graphic novels of all time. Bechdel recounts her complex childhood and early adulthood through the lens of life at the funeral parlor her family owned and ran. She is a literal genius, and to me, Fun Home is a 21st century must-read.\n\nIce Haven (2005) by Daniel Clowes\n\nA tidy one-off story from the hipster prince of 1990s indie publishing. Clowes is most famous for his seminal title Ghost World, which was turned into a Major Motion Picture, but I prefer this unusual volume. It’s part mystery, part meditation on life in the Midwest, but mostly another fascinating character exploration from a master of sequential art.\n\nTales From the Loop (2014) by Simon Stalenhag\n\nThis is a crowd-funded book that caught on with popular audiences. Tales from the Loop is filled with the most unbelievably beautiful illustrations of a past that never existed, but that we still feel nostalgia for. Also: DINOSAURS.\n\nAll-time classics\n\nIf a book is still in publication years and years after initial release, and still widely loved, chances are it’s worth the time to read. “Classic” can be a very malleable descriptor, by the way. How would you define a classic book?\n\nJane Eyre (1847) by Charlotte Bronte\n\nIt’s not just a good book, it’s GREAT. Many English speakers probably know the story beats just by virtue of living in the world, but letting the book unwind in print is almost spiritual. Sorry for the gushing, but this book is really really good.\n\nThe Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay (2000) by Michael Chabon\n\nTo me, this is one of the more accessible and engaging Pulitzer Prize winners from the last 30 years. I read it when it was first published, and still have vivid memories of entire passages of text. Chabon is known for several highly readable titles like Wonder Boys, and The Yiddish Policeman’s Union that I freely and often recommend.\n\nThe Count of Monte Cristo (1844) by Alexander Dumas\n\nWho doesn’t adore epic tales of revenge spanning decades? This book can still be found in practically any library, book store, and thrift shop in half the world. It has staying power for a reason.\n\nThe Catcher in the Rye (1951) by JD Salinger\n\nWhile this may be a divisive suggestion, the work of JD Salinger changed my life. To me, he defines the ennui, despair, and dissatisfaction that has been percolating through the country since World War II. I read this book as soon as I understood how nervous the story made mid-20th century parents. I didn’t understand all the pearl-clutching, but I DID understand that this was literature, and something different than what I had been reading before.\n\nMurderbot\n\nThe ultimate solution for smashing that reading slump is to read Martha Wells’ Murderbot Diaries. They are the best books ever written in the history of the written language. Sorry to you James Baldwin, William Shakespeare, and Annie Proulx, but Martha has you all beat. Start with All Systems Red and thank me later for curing your depression and anxiety.\n\nStill feeling uncertain about what to read? Consider using Mead’s Your Next Five Books reader’s advisory tool.

Shortly after they arrive, things begin to turn ominous. Stirrings in the woods and over the treetops—the brooding shape of a monolith known as the Black Rock casts its terrible pall. Paranoia and distrust grips the settlement. The escape routes are gradually cut off as events spiral towards madness. Hell—or the closest thing to it—invades Little Heaven. The remaining occupants are forced to take a stand and fight back, but whatever has cast its dark eye on Little Heaven is now marshaling its powers…and it wants them all.\n\nThe Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon (1999) by Stephen King\n\nOn a six-mile hike on the Maine-New Hampshire branch of the Appalachian Trail, nine-year-old Trisha McFarland quickly tires of the constant bickering between her older brother, Pete, and her recently divorced mother. But when she wanders off by herself and then tries to catch up by attempting a shortcut, she becomes lost in a wilderness maze full of peril and terror.\n\nAs night falls, Trisha has only her ingenuity as a defense against the elements, and only her courage and faith to withstand her mounting fears. For solace, she tunes her Walkman to broadcasts of Boston Red Sox baseball games and follows the gritty performances of her hero, relief pitcher Tom Gordon. And when her radio’s reception begins to fade, Trisha imagines that Tom Gordon is with her – protecting her from an all-too-real enemy who has left a trail of slaughtered animals and mangled trees in the dense, dark woods…\n\nThornhedge (2023) by T. Kingfisher\n\nThere’s a princess trapped in a tower. This isn’t her story.\n\nMeet Toadling. On the day of her birth, she was stolen from her family by the fairies, but she grew up safe and loved in the warm waters of faerieland. Once an adult though, the fae ask a favor of Toadling: return to the human world and offer a blessing of protection to a newborn child. Simple, right?\n\nBut nothing with fairies is ever simple.\n\nCenturies later, a knight approaches a towering wall of brambles, where the thorns are as thick as your arm and as sharp as swords. He’s heard there’s a curse here that needs breaking, but it’s a curse Toadling will do anything to uphold…\n\nThe Beach (mysteries best read on the beach)\n\nRum Punch (1992) by Elmore Leonard\n\nOrdell Robbie makes a fine living selling illegal high-powered weaponry to the wrong people. Jackie Burke couriers Ordell’s profits from Freeport to Miami. But the feds are on to Jackie – and now the aging, but still hot, flight attendant will have to do prison time or play ball, which makes her a prime ‘loose end’ that Ordell needs to tie up … permanently.\n\nJackie, however, has other plans. And with the help of Max Cherry – an honest but disgruntled bail bondsman looking to get out – she could even end up with a serious nest egg in the process.\n\nThe Lost Girls of Penzance (2023) by Sally Rigby\n\nDetective Lauren Pengelly has only been part of the Penzance police force for less than two years, but that’s enough time to know that the sleepy Cornish town doesn’t see many murders. So, when the bones of a woman with a hole in her skull are discovered behind a derelict cottage, she immediately assumes the worst.\n\nFortune Favors the Dead (2020) by Stephen Spotswood\n\nIt’s 1942 and Willowjean “Will” Parker is a scrappy circus runaway whose knife-throwing skills have just saved the life of New York’s best, and most unorthodox, private investigator, Lillian Pentecost. When the dapper detective summons Will a few days later, she doesn’t expect to be offered a life-changing proposition: Lillian’s multiple sclerosis means she can’t keep up with her old case load alone, so she wants to hire Will to be her right-hand woman. In return, Will is to receive a salary, room and board, and training in Lillian’s very particular art of investigation.\n\nThe City (books to read on vacation in a city)\n\nThe Indifferent Stars Above (2009) by Daniel J. Brown\n\nIn April of 1846, twenty-one-year-old Sarah Graves, intent on a better future, set out west from Illinois with her new husband, her parents, and eight siblings. Seven months later, after joining a party of emigrants led by George Donner, they reached the Sierra Nevada Mountains as the first heavy snows of the season closed the pass ahead of them. In early December, starving and desperate, Sarah and fourteen others set out for California on snowshoes and, over the next thirty-two days, endured almost unfathomable hardships and horrors.\n\nIn this gripping narrative, Daniel James Brown sheds new light on one of the most infamous events in American history. Following every painful footstep of Sarah’s journey with the Donner Party, Brown produces a tale both spellbinding and richly informative.\n\nThe Library Book (2018) by Susan Orlean\n\nOn the morning of April 29, 1986, a fire alarm sounded in the Los Angeles Public Library. As the moments passed, the patrons and staff who had been cleared out of the building realized this was not the usual fire alarm. As one fireman recounted, “Once that first stack got going, it was ‘Goodbye, Charlie.’” The fire was disastrous: it reached 2000 degrees and burned for more than seven hours. By the time it was extinguished, it had consumed four hundred thousand books and damaged seven hundred thousand more. Investigators descended on the scene, but more than thirty years later, the mystery remains: Did someone purposefully set fire to the library—and if so, who?\n\nThe City We Became (2020) by NK Jemisin\n\nFive New Yorkers must come together in order to defend their city.\n\nEvery city has a soul. Some are as ancient as myths, and others are as new and destructive as children. New York City? She’s got five.\n\nBut every city also has a dark side. A roiling, ancient evil stirs beneath the earth, threatening to destroy the city and her five protectors unless they can come together and stop it once and for all.\n\nStaycation (books to help you dream of where to go next)\n\nMidnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (1994) by John Berendt\n\nShots rang out in Savannah’s grandest mansion in the misty, early morning hours of May 2, 1981. Was it murder or self-defense? For nearly a decade, the shooting and its aftermath reverberated throughout this city of moss-hung oaks and shaded squares. John Berendt’s narrative reads like a thoroughly engrossing novel, and yet it is a work of nonfiction. Berendt interweaves a first-person account of life in this isolated remnant of the Old South with the unpredictable twists and turns of a landmark murder case.\n\nMy Brilliant Friend (2011) by Elena Ferrante\n\nA modern masterpiece from one of Italy’s most acclaimed authors, My Brilliant Friend is a rich, intense and generous-hearted story about two friends, Elena and Lila. Ferrante’s inimitable style lends itself perfectly to a meticulous portrait of these two women that is also the story of a nation and a touching meditation on the nature of friendship. Through the lives of these two women, Ferrante tells the story of a neighborhood, a city and a country as it is transformed in ways that, in turn, also transform the relationship between her two protagonists.\n\nThe Travels of Marco Polo (1298) by Marco Polo\n\nMarco Polo (1254-1329) has achieved an almost archetypal status as a traveler, and his Travels is one of the first great travel books of Western literature, outside the ancient world. The Travels recounts Polo’s journey to the eastern court of Kublai Khan, the chieftain of the Mongol empire which covered the Asian continent, but which was almost unknown to Polo’s contemporaries. Encompassing a twenty-four year period from 1271, Polo’s account details his travels in the service of the empire, from Beijing to northern India and ends with the remarkable story of Polo’s return voyage from the Chinese port of Amoy to the Persian Gulf. Alternately factual and fantastic, Polo’s prose at once reveals the medieval imagination’s limits, and captures the wonder of subsequent travel writers when faced with the unfamiliar, the exotic or the unknown.\n\nAll of the books I have listed above are available in the Monarch catalog, often in a variety of formats.

We also offer movie recommendations here: Your Next Five Movies.\n\nWith the release a few months ago of the live action Avatar the Last Airbender on Netflix, I thought it would be fun to take a look at a book series that has been exploring the Avatar (not the blue people) universe. I have been an Avatar fan since I was a teenager. The show deals with a lot of heavy concepts for a kids show and is often dark at times.\n\nThe setting is in a world where each element has a nation based upon it. Those that live within the nation are tied to that particular element (if you are lucky enough to be born a bender and not a regular person.) The Four Nations are: The Fire Nation, The Water Tribe, The Earth Kingdom, and The Air Nomads. The Avatar is the one who ties them all together and is born with the ability to control (bend) all four elements. The job of the Avatar is to bring balance to the physical world and the spiritual world. The Avatar must be an intermediary who settles disputes and brings about a just deal between various parties. The Avatar is the key to keeping the peace. In addition to this role, the Avatar is reincarnated every time they die. An Avatar can access and talk to any of his or her past memories and incarnations. The job description is definitely a lot for one person to handle!\n\nThe show focuses on one incarnation of the Avatar: a boy named Aang. Through Aang we see the burdens of Avatarhood on a kid’s shoulders. He tried to run away from his responsibilities resulting in him being frozen in ice for 100 years. Waking up he finds the world completely changed. The Fire Nation has taken over most of the world and he is the only hope in saving it and restoring the peace.\n\nIf you have watched Avatar the Last Airbender you know Aang’s story. But what about his past lives? The Chronicles of the Avatar series explores the lives of the Avatars that have come before Aang. These books are Young Adult to Adult level reads and feature Kyoshi’s story and Yangchen’s story. Roku’s story is due to be released on July 23rd of this year. I am hoping for a Kuruk novel after Roku!\n\nThe Rise of Kyoshi by F. C. Yee\n\nI was very excited when this book came out as I had found the glimpses of Kyoshi in the Avatar the Last Airbender series absolutely fascinating. She is imposing! She has cool makeup! She fights with metal fans and wears a cool outfit! She founded an entire island of warrior women! Of course I wanted to find out more about this interesting character. I did not expect Kyoshi to become my all time favorite Avatar. Though we see her in the show in her adult years as an imposing and wise Avatar, Kyoshi wasn’t always that way. I found her so easy to connect with as a character.\n\nKyoshi is an orphan. She had to fight for everything she has which is not much. Not only that, she is terrible at earth bending. She can’t seem to control the smallest of pebbles! Being an orphan, no one considers that she could possibly be the Avatar. The elders believe that the next Avatar will be a strong bender at birth. Kyoshi is abnormally tall, clumsy, and does not fit the beauty standards of those around her. She has to face her share of bullies. Thus Kyoshi ends up working as a servant girl in the mansion that belongs to a boy the elders believe is the real Avatar!\n\nThe Rise of Kyoshi follows our hero as she finds out who she really is. As Aang had his faithful companions, we get to meet Kyoshi’s gang of close friends. One stand out is Rangi, a fiery spark of a fire bender who is such a strong and loyal friend. The relationship between Kyoshi and Rangi was a pleasure to read. Being an orphan, Kyoshi deeply values the friendships and connections she makes. She feels that she is a guardian of sorts and will not let anything happen to those she cares about.\n\nThere is plenty of epic bending fights with bandits and other baddies the team comes across. The overarching villain is so well written. His motives are understandable from a power hungry twisted perspective. He is a very powerful and worthy opponent for Kyoshi.\n\nThere were points in this book I wanted to cry, cheer, and laugh with the characters. I really felt a connection with them and the author did really well exploring these relationships. Kyoshi is a LGBTQ Avatar, but I am not going to spoil who she has feelings for. I can say that the relationship was very well written and believable. The novel takes the reader on a journey as Kyoshi grows as a person and learns how to control the four elements and assume her role as the true Avatar. (Questions about where the fans and face paint came from are also answered.) This book ends making you want more! I read this book so fast as I could not put it down! Luckily there is a sequel. The second book in the series reviewed below resumes Kyoshi’s story.\n\nRecommended for fans of Avatar the Last Airbender, epic battles, fantasy worlds, political intrigue, LGBTQ, magic, and flying bison.\n\nClick this link to request the novel!

And with it comes the month-long celebration of diversity and freedom of expression that is Pride Month. Many of us don our most colorful duds and attend a Pride festival, parade, or concert. For those of us who tend to choose the low-key way of things, watching a film, or reading a book focused on the queer experience is the perfect way to pause and reflect on this community’s struggles and gains over the past 50+ years.\n\nBelow, the reader will find several media suggestions made by, about, and for people in the LGBTQ+ community and their allies. All picks are available to borrow in the Monarch catalog. Click each title to see a catalog listing.\n\nFilm\n\nAll of the movies I list below are available on Kanopy as of May 31, 2024. Titles are linked to physical DVD copies in Monarch (except Maurice which is on Kanopy only at this time).\n\nThe Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (1994) starring Guy Pierce, Terrance Stamp, and Hugo Weaving\n\n(big ol’ spoilers here, be warned)\n\nBefore he was Agent Smith or Elrond, Hugo Weaving played Tick, aka Mitzy Del Bra, the pansexual drag queen who is also secretly a husband and father. His wife needs a break from parenting, so the natural thing to do would be to load up a shiny silver coach bus with metric tonnes of drag gear, Tick’s two best drag queen friends, and drive from Sydney to Alice Springs through the massive and ancient Outback. Abba, choreography, and the most wonderful drag costuming to grace the silver screen will be your reward for going along on this adventure.\n\nBut I’m a Cheerleader (1999) starring Natasha Lyonne and Melanie Lynsky\n\nA comedy about a gay conversion camp?! This film does provide the camp, in layers. Lyonne’s parents (played with great elan by the excellent Bud Cort and inimitable Mink Stole) are worried that despite her super girly cheerleader exterior, their daughter may be more interested in girls than boys. Horrified at the thought of having a lesbian daughter, they choose to send her to a conversion camp. Would you believe hilarity ensues? There isn’t another film like this in the world, and anyone who appreciates Lyonne’s oeuvre even a little bit should not miss this gem.\n\nMaurice (1987) starring Hugh Grant and Rupert Graves\n\nThis film was based on an E.M. Forster novel of the same name. Forster insisted it be kept from publication until after his death, which was in 1971. At the time of its writing in 1914, loving someone of the same sex was punishable by imprisonment, and would have surely ruined Forster’s career. What a pity. During Pride I spend a lot of time thinking about the creative, scientific, and social gains we could have achieved if systems of power weren’t so focused on oppressing people deemed different. Please enjoy this gorgeous movie about beautiful men falling in love.\n\nPortrait of a Lady on Fire (2020) directed by Celine Sciamma\n\nMove over male gaze, this French drama is all about how ladies look at ladies, on- fire ones, sometimes. If you like your 18th century dramas filled with unreal cinematography, costuming, and set design, in addition to many lingering and meaningful looks across the room, this is the film to watch. Sciamma became the first woman director to win the Queer Palm at Cannes in 2019, and received almost unanimous critical praise for her work.\n\nTangerine (2015) directed by Sean Baker\n\nNot only is this film innovative for centering the story of a trans woman, it is the first feature length film shot entirely using iPhones. I think this use of new technology helped to capture the freneticism, danger, anger, and joy being expressed in the film. Things that equalize access to consuming and making art in this way are appealing to me on a cellular level.\n\nNot feeling moved by any of those picks? Kanopy has an entire LGBTQ+ Cinema subheading to click on under “browse”. There are dozens and dozens of wonderful films to peruse.\n\nBooks\n\nThis list of books is available in the Monarch Catalog, often in a variey of formats.\n\nThe Hellbound Heart (1986) by Clive Barker\n\nDon’t you wish your horror fiction were a little queerer? Please enjoy these a-gender cenobites: Originally appearing in the anthology Night Visions, this Barker novella took on a life of its own when it was given the big screen treatment in 1987. “But I have never heard of a movie called The Hellbound Heart, Molly.” Well, inner voice of the reader, you may be surprised to learn the movie adaptation was called Hellraiser, and spawned several sequels of varying quality as well as a remake. Barker has been openly gay for most of the time he has been in the public eye, so of course his sexuality will impact the writing and reading of his work. Read more about how he made horror a little gayer with THIS excellent article.\n\nThe Stonewall Reader (2019)\n\nThis anthology was published in remembrance of the Stonewall Riots of June, 1969 that catalyzed the movement toward gay liberation in earnest, as well as determined which month we celebrate Pride. The anthology includes first-hand accounts of people who were there that day, as well as in remembrance of fighters who have passed, like Martha P. Johnson. This is a great book for people who would like to know more about the history of the gay liberation movement, or would like a Stonewall-specific overview.\n\nUpright Women Wanted (2020) by Sarah Gailey\n\nGailey is one of the most exciting modern sci-fi/fantasy authors working today. From the blurb: “The future American Southwest is full of bandits, fascists, and queer librarian spies on horseback trying to do the right thing.” I read that and thought LET’S GOOOOOO! Love me some outlaw-style, gun-toting librarians. If this is too dystopic and close to home with the fundamentalism, please see Gailey’s fantastic western revisionist novella River of Teeth (2017). This book is best for people who like stories set in the wild west that are about feral hippos.\n\nYou Made a Fool of Death with Your Beauty (2022) by Akwaeke Emezi\n\nI haven’t read this book, but the reviews are positive, and I loved Emezi’s 2019 novel Pet. I’ve blogged about Pet in the past, likely multiple times, so today I encourage reading their latest work. Emezi is a fascinating author and I look forward to each of their new publications.\n\nRole Models (2010) John Waters\n\nThis is a collection of essays Waters had been publishing in various magazines throughout the 1980s, 90s, and early 2000s. The subject matter ranges from Manson Girl Leslie Van Houten, with whom Waters has a warm, decades-long friendship, to fashion house Comme des Garcons, and just about anywhere else life has taken him. Waters is primarily known for his confrontational, campy and over-the top films like Female Trouble and Serial Mom, so it is with great pleasure that I found him to be a compelling and hilarious writer. A John Waters film festival would also be an appropriate way to celebrate Pride, even if he is being intentionally inappropriate. The gentleman is as thoughtful and insightful as he is depraved.

There is so much great content I can barely make up my mind when it comes to choosing something to watch. Below, I listed several dynamic pictures to suit many tastes and aesthetics. Gather your friends, your family, and the snacks you love. Pull on your jim jams, get comfy, and enjoy the miracle of light that is moving pictures.\n\nClassic movie night:\n\nThe Outlaw (1943) starring Jane Russel and directed by Howard Hughes\n\nThis is a Billy the Kid story, but the only thing people remember about this movie is Hughes’ supposedly engineered a bra to make sure Russel’s prominent chest was as chesty as a chest could ever boob. While Hughes may have applied his airplane smarts to brassiere design, the resulting garment was uncomfortable to the point of excessive pain. Russel would wear a regular bra and tell Hughes she was fitted in the monstrosity of his design. He wasn’t going to check, after all. No, I do not care if this story is apocryphal.\n\nThe Stranger (1946) written, directed by, and starring Orson Welles\n\nOne of Welles’ lesser known, but greatly enjoyable noir pictures. Welles plays a former Nazi supervillain who has disguised himself as a small New England town boy’s school teacher. He has to do a murder real quick to hide his true identity, which attracts the attention of a tenacious Edward G. Robinson, a man who prosecutes war criminals for the UN. A tense and entertaining game of cat and mouse ensues.\n\nSunset Boulevard (1950) starring Gloria Swanson and directed by Billy Wilder\n\nI don’t think it’s hyperbolic to call this one of the great pictures of the 20th century. We see the herald of old Hollywood colliding with new that wouldn’t actually happen for another 20 years. Here, the narrative is driven by the effects of film transitioning from silent to talkies a further 20 years prior. Blink and you’ll miss “wax work” stars like Buster Keaton and H.B. Warner portraying themselves. Eric Von Stroheim, the legendary and unfairly maligned silent picture director, stuns as Norma Desmond’s protective manservant. Mark your calendars and join the Movie Club discussion of this film at 8th Street Ale Haus on Thursday, August 15 2024.\n\nFamily movie night:\n\nThe Adventures of Prince Achmed (1926) directed by Lotte Reiniger\n\nGorgeous, meticulous animation using cut paper techniques of the Victorians. This may be slightly slow-moving for the very littles, but could be a good show to put on when it’s winding down to sleepy time.\n\nThe Water Horse (2007) directed by Jay Russell\n\nDelightful fantasy adventure with lots of cryptid action. This is based on a book of the same name by author Dick King-Smith. Wouldn’t it be fun to read this book as a family before you watch the movie? You could compare and contrast and decide which you like better and why.\n\nKedi: The Cats of an Ancient City (2016) directed by Ceyda Torun\n\nEnflame your family’s itch to travel with this charmer. The ancient city of Istanbul is famous for its numerous stray cats who are cared for by many but owned by none. Learn the reason why as the filmmaker follows seven different cats throughout their respective days.\n\nHorror movie night:\n\nBattle Royale (2000) directed by Kinji Fukasaku\n\nThis is not a horror movie in the same vein as say, your Friday the 13ths or your Paranormal Activities or whatever, but it IS horrific. The film begins with a bus full of Japanese school kids getting gassed. They awake on an island, surrounded by various weapons. The group learns that only one person will be allowed to leave the island, and they have to do so by killing everyone else. Sometimes these high-concept films lose momentum or have muddy plots, but Battle Royale is as sharp and deadly in action and dialogue as the day it came out. Super creepy, exciting, and unforgettable. This is based on a very successful book of the same name.\n\nHouse on Haunted Hill (1959) starring Vincent Price and directed by William Castle\n\nThis little oddball is an incredible cultural time capsule. Watch it straight on Kanopy to appreciate the scenery-chewing of a marvelous Vincent Price and the campy special effects. After that, check out this Rifftrax DVD. Rifftrax is where the boys from Mystery Science Theater 3000 took their brand of movie house heckling after the original cable show got canceled. They are joined by a razor sharp and always hilarious Paul F. Tompkins as they heckle, lampoon, mock, and adore House on Haunted Hill.\n\nNight of the Living Dead (1968) directed by George Romero\n\nThis film is foundational to almost all other horror movies to follow. The low budget thrills are still effective, and often shocking. Tom Savini did a remake in 1990, and his monster makeup effects are so good you can practically smell them (so, SO glad you cannot). The remake also addresses the weakest aspect of the original: Barbara’s ineffectiveness. The 1990 Barbara takes action against the ravening hordes and is such a total badass. Original Barbara is panicking and weak when she’s not outright catatonic. This diminishes my personal enjoyment of Romero’s otherwise extremely entertaining film, but then again I have seen it approximately five thousand times.\n\nWildcard night:\n\nIn the Heat of the Night (1967) starring Rod Steiger and Sidney Poitier\n\nI recently read the excellent and extraordinary 2008 book Pictures at a Revolution by Mark Harris. The author does a deep dive into how the five 1968 Best Picture nominees came to be and what they signified for Hollywood’s trajectory. It made me feel desperate to re-watch In the Heat of the Night, which won the Best Picture Oscar of that year, so imagine my delight when I found it streaming on Kanopy, and not a single other streaming service for free.\n\nHot Rod (2007) starring Andy Samberg and directed by Akiva Shaffer\n\nThe character of Hot Rod is himself, a wild card. Turn your brain off and let your mouth go slack. Let those silly Lonely Island boys take you on an adventure so unusual, many of the principal actors said they “did not understand” what the movie was about up to and past its release date.\n\nRumble in the Bronx (1995) starring Jackie Chan\n\nHave you ever heard of a cooler movie title?! This was Jackie Chan’s breakout crossover hit for American audiences. He’d already been making movies in Hong Kong for like 20 years up to this point, and this is one of his best. Known for mind-boggling action pieces, and tightly choreographed fight sequences, it’s not hard to understand how this picture won over American audiences and increased the already blazing light of Chan’s international celebrity.\n\nAll of the films I mentioned above are available for checkout on Kanopy as of April 26th, 2024, but may be subject to change over time as the lineup can shift from month to month. In fact, when I REALLY can’t make up my mind about what I would like to watch, I go to the “leaving this month” category and choose something I won’t have access to for long. I think the urgency helps me make a choice.\n\nI linked each title to the Monarch catalog DVD listing, if one prefers physical media.
