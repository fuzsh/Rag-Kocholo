E-mail: ude.retselacam@kaletreiw\n\nCopyright © 2002 Faculty for Undergraduate Neuroscience\n\nAbstract\n\nBoth short excerpts from, and full-length presentation of feature films have been used with success in undergraduate instruction. Studies of such use of films has revealed that incorporation of film viewing within courses can promote both content mastery and the development of critical thinking skills. This article discusses and provides examples of successful use of two methods that may be used to incorporate a variety of full-length feature films into neuroscience instruction. One, the “neuro-cinema” pairs the presentation of a film featuring extensive neuroscience content with primary literature reading assignments, group discussion and writing exercises. The second, a neuroscience film series, features group discussion of movies of perhaps more limited relevance to neuroscience.\n\nAn additional goal of this article is provide the reader with initial resources for the selection of potential film titles for use in neuroscience education. Three extensive tables are included to provide a wide range of title suggestions appropriate for use in activities such as the neuro-cinema, the neuroscience film series, or for more limited use as short “clips” in classroom instruction.\n\nKeywords: teaching methods, neuroscience education, Motion Pictures, films, movies\n\nIt is no secret that instructors across disciplines have long made use of feature films and short “clips” from movies in conjunction with classroom instruction. Examples of such use in instruction include the use of film to provide conceptual illustrations (Fleming et al., 1990; Boyatzis 1994; Conner 1996; Kelly, 1998); allow examination of social relationships and interpersonal communication (for example, Paddock et al., 2001); to permit the observation of specific methodological techniques (Toman and Rak, 2000; see also Wedding and Boyd, 1999) and to introduce students to content that may be beyond their personal experience, such as psychological trauma (for example, Alexander and Waxman, 2000). In studies of such course related uses, movies have been shown to augment the understanding of course material (Kinney, 1975; Fleming et al., 1990; Boyatzis 1994; Conner 1996; Paddock et al., 2001), improve critical thinking skills (Fleming et al., 1990; Conner 1996; Paddock et al., 2001), broaden student awareness of important social issues (Hyler, 1996; Alexander and Waxman, 2000; Davis, 2000), and aid in the application of concepts from their coursework to real life situations (Fleming et al., 1990; Hyler and Moore, 1996; Davis, 2000; Toman and Rak, 2000).\n\nThe purposes to which movies have been put across disciplines may also be of benefit in the study of neuroscience. While not a substitute for classroom instruction and readings, movies can serve to promote the understanding and retention of specific content areas under discussion within a course. A critical examination of films depicting (for example) neuroscience methodology in use, pharmacological effects on behavior, or the impact of illness or injury on the nervous system can provide students with valuable opportunities for the evaluation of their own educational progress. Further, movies featuring neuroscience content may effectively expose students to unfamiliar, but important subject matter, or provide needed context-- stimulating interest in and enthusiasm not only for specific topics, but for the interdisciplinary field of neuroscience. Indeed, the use of movies in undergraduate neuroscience education may also help students to recognize the many intellectual and vocational possibilities that such study has opened for them (for a discussion of the use of neuroscience-related feature films in middle school/secondary education, see Stewart and Chudler, 2002).\n\nThis article discusses some ways in which to incorporate movies into the undergraduate neuroscience curriculum. It provides extensive title suggestions, along with examples of the sorts of assignments and film choices that have been effective in recent years in my own course offerings. The movie titles included here are intended to provide suggestions for use across a wide range of topics, genres and Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) ratings, from the earliest days of film making to today. It is by no means exhaustive-- or intended to exclude the reader’s personal favorites.\n\nASSIGNMENT/EXERCISE 1: NEURO-CINEMA\n\nThis assignment includes the viewing of an entire film by the class as a group, within a single multi-hour laboratory period. The design allows the class to become involved in the story and remain so for an immediate post-viewing discussion. (This sort of exercise is not unique to neuroscience instruction; for example Fleming et al. (1990) describe a somewhat similar exercise used each week in a film-based psychology course.)\n\nIdeally, films chosen by the instructor for use in this exercise should meet two criteria: 1) Feature a neuroscience concept, used as a central plot mechanism; and 2) Employ a neuroscience concept associated with a strong primary literature base. Considering the rate at which feature films are currently produced worldwide, along with the incredible number already in existence, the limited number and type of movies that meet the above criteria for use is surprisingly large.\n\ncontains a selection of movie titles that meet the criteria suggested above. One week prior to the laboratory session in which the film will be shown, two to three readings related to the film chosen are assigned to the students. Typically, the readings chosen are a combination of one or more empirical research papers and a single review article. Students are assigned to prepare a one- to two-page summary for each of the readings, which are collected prior to the film presentation. The film presentation is followed by a group discussion of the movie in relationship to the assigned readings and relevant course content; a one- to two-page “reaction” paper is due at a subsequent next class meeting.\n\nTable 1\n\nTitleYearReleased ByRunning TimeDirected ByFeaturingSpecific ContentGenre/RatingA Beautiful Mind2001Universal Studios and Dreamworks LLC2 hrs., 16 mins.Ron HowardRussell Crowe, Ed Harris, Jennifer ConnellySchizophrenia, attentionDrama PG-13A.I.: Artificial Intelligence2001Dreamworks LLC and Warner Brothers2 hrs., 25 mins.Steven SpielbergHaley Joel Osment, Jude LawArtificial intelligence, ethicsDrama/Action PG-13Afraid of Dark1991New Line Productions1 hr., 31 mins.Mark PeploeJames FoxVision, perception, neurodegenerative diseaseDrama/Thriller R ViolenceAs Good As It Gets1997Tristar Pictures2 hrs., 19 mins.James L.

Lorenzo’s Oil (1992)\n\nConsider the dramatic motion picture that is marketed as a serious treatment of neuroscience subject matter. Depending on the particular course and area of neuroscience, a number of possibilities might exist and coordinate well with the instructor’s interests (see ). One such choice that this author has used with success is the 1992 movie, Lorenzo’s Oil (Miller and Mitchell, 1992). Lorenzo’s Oil provides a wealth of material that illustrates the roles of science and medicine in society. Further, Lorenzo’s Oil demonstrates the value of a liberal arts education; showing how an understanding of the nervous system, in combination with other well-developed academic skills and life experiences, may collectively enable the motivated individual to pursue even those goals that to others around them seem unattainable.\n\nThe reader may recall that Lorenzo’s Oil is ostensibly the story of how two parents, Augusto and Michaela Odone, worked to provide a therapeutic intervention for their son Lorenzo, stricken with the rare disease adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD). Indeed, the efforts of the Odones and the foundation they established, the Myelin Project, have stimulated substantial research activity on ALD and related disease processes where there once was very little (the instructor considering the use of the film Lorenzo’s Oil in a course may be interested in visiting the foundations’ promotional/informational website; it can be found at http://www.myelin.org). A literature search using the film title as the key word reveals a substantial collection of empirical reports, clinical case studies, journal editorials and research reviews, many suitable for use as reading assignments focusing on various aspects of the film’s content and ALD (for example, see Rizzo, 1993; Aubourg et al., 1993; Hudson, 2000).\n\nCompletion of the reading assignment and viewing of the film reveals a complex story. To frame the post-viewing discussion, I ask the class to consider a number of issues, such as:\n\nThis film begins with a plea from the film’s stars, Nick Nolte and Susan Sarandon, to support the Odones’ work and the Myelin Project. What was your reaction to this segment, experienced by the student, both in the moment and after the film’s completion?\n\nSeveral scenes in the movie are devoted to instruction (of characters depicted in the film) on the topic of long-chain fatty acids. To what extent did you find this content of educational value? Did you view this portion of the film as potentially educational?\n\nThe movie end credits feature testimonials from seeming dozens of boys positively affected by the Odones’ work. Having read the literature, what is your reaction to these testimonials?\n\nConsider the depictions of clinical researchers and basic scientists in the film, and their interactions with the Odones (as well as the other parents, patients, and Lorenzo). Are these two groups treated similarly in the film?\n\nExample 2. Clean Slate (1994)\n\nFilms have also employed neuroscience content as central plot mechanisms for comedic, rather than dramatic effect (See ). One example of the appropriation of such content to amuse is the use of Korsakoff’s Disease in the movie Clean Slate (Zanuck et. al., 1994). Korsakoff’s Syndrome is a familiar topic in both neuroscience and neuropsychology textbooks used in undergraduate neuroscience instruction, and the available literature from which readings may be selected is robust. As in the previous example, summary papers for each of the readings are collected from each student prior to the film presentation. The film presentation is followed by group discussion, with a one- to two-page reaction paper due at the next class meeting.\n\nClean Slate is the story of Pogue, a private detective who, in the midst of a “case” receives a brain injury. As a result, he is unable to form new long-term memories, and amnesic for the events in the years just prior to the accident-- a constellation of effects the movie identifies as Korsakoff’s Syndrome. As luck would have it, the plot requires that Pogue continue his investigation, allowing each scene to mine the comedic potential of memory loss. An additional comedic “element” relevant to neuroscience can be found in Pogue’s dog, which is blind in one eye and perceptually challenged at every turn.\n\nAs in the previous example, following the conclusion of the film, several issues are raised in the form of questions, both to stimulate and frame discussion. Potential questions here might include:\n\nHow does this movie’s depiction of memory loss compare to known forms of memory impairment?\n\nHow does the depiction of Korsakoff’s Syndrome compare to what you know? Describe your expectations for a movie scene dealing with Korsakoff’s Syndrome.\n\nIs the use of Korsakoff’s syndrome justifiable as a plot mechanism? What are examples of justifiable use? What effects might this use have on the viewing public? On science?\n\nGiven your knowledge of the disease, how enjoyable was the film?\n\nWould your emotional response be different if the film made dramatic, rather than comedic use of Korsakoff’s syndrome?\n\nWhat effect did the depiction of Pogue’s dog have?\n\nThe neuro-cinema exercise can be a dynamic part of a neuroscience class, but requires significant allotments of time; not only in viewing the movie, but for students in completing the preparatory readings and the two writing assignments; and for the instructor in preparation of readings and discussion questions. However, while the persistent and intrepid instructor may develop reading assignments to accompany many more movies beyond those featured in , not all movies that contain desirable neuroscience plot elements focus on well-defined topics that allow the instructor to easily assign readings drawn from a single primary literature. Moreover, at some institutions laboratory periods may not be of sufficient duration to allow for completion of the film presentation and group discussion. Indeed, while the restrictions for film suitability and requirements placed on students and instructor promote the educational value of the neuro-cinema, in many courses time constraints and competing educational goals may limit an extensive use of laboratory sessions for such experiences. One alternative to the neuro-cinema exercise is a less restrictive neuroscience film “festival” or series, conducted outside regular class or laboratory hours, for which participation may be limited to those enrolled in a specific course or opened to a larger student audience.\n\nASSIGNMENT/EXERCISE 2: A NEUROSCIENCE FILM SERIES\n\nAn evening or weekend film series can also augment content and provide important context for the study of neuroscience, without the use of laboratory periods or class time. However, mounting a film series to accompany a course does require real effort on the part of the sponsoring faculty, not only to select appropriate titles and participate in the viewing and post-presentation discussion, but also to stimulate and maintain student interest in the events. One potential approach to stimulate student involvement is to reduce the obstacles to participation in the film presentation and post-viewing discussion by the elimination of the students’ preparatory readings and initial writing assignment employed in the neuro-cinema exercise. Here, instead of readings, a few minutes of introductory remarks by the instructor prior to the movie presentation set the stage for the presentation and foreshadow the post-viewing discussion. In my use of the film series exercise, I do require that students complete a short reaction paper reflecting on the film and group discussion, to be handed in at a subsequent class meeting. While an individual instructor may or may not choose to include a written assignment component, a film series otherwise structured in this way allows a greater range of films to be suitable for such use, in comparison to the neuro-cinema exercise.\n\nincludes feature films that make use of neuroscience content, without the explicit satisfaction of the criteria described above for the neuro-cinema exercise. Films in this category can provide valuable lessons in neuroscience, but may not derive their central themes from such content, or focus on a single subject matter. Given the emphasis of the neuroscience film series exercise on the post-presentation discussion, some of the best films for use in this assignment may well be those that provide neuroscience content of a more implicit than explicit nature. Indeed, some instructors are even able to effectively employ the discussion of films of irrelevant content by “forcing” the generation of analogies to the course content (see Dengler, 1974 for a discussion of this possibility). Examining films with less explicit neuroscience content may promote a more critical analysis from discussion participants. Further, such films provide the instructor with additional opportunities for teaching moments within the post-presentation discussion, helping students to grasp important concepts of neuroscience; develop an appreciation for the connections between the various sub-areas of neuroscience; and to link principles to application. In choosing from feature film titles that satisfy the criteria imposed on the suggested titles in either or , a neuroscience film series attached to a course can promote a variety of goals for neuroscience instruction, not the least of which may be to convey the excitement and scope of the interdisciplinary field of neuroscience.\n\nTable 2\n\nTitleYearReleased ByRunning TimeDirected ByFeaturingSpecific ContentGenre/Rating12 Monkeys1995Universal Studios2 hrs., 10 mins.Terry GilliamBruce Willis, Brad Pitt, Madeleine StoweDelusional thought, treatment of mental illnessSuspense/Drama R Violence, Language, Gore2001: A Space Odyssey1968Metro Goldwyn Mayer2 hrs., 28 mins.Stanley KubrickKeir Dullea, Gary LockwoodArtificial intelligence, the human ecological niche, concept of self/soulDrama GThe 6th Day2000Columbia Pictures2 hrs., 4 mins.Roger SpottiswoodeArnold SchwarzeneggerMemory, cloning, ethicsAction/Suspense PG-13A Bird in the Head1946Columbia Pictures16 mins.Edward BerndsMoe Howard, Larry Fine, Curly HowardBrain transplantation across species, brain anatomyComedy NRA Clockwork Orange1971Warner Brothers2 hrs., 17 mins.Stanley KubrickMalcolm McDowellLearning, aversion therapy, perception, ethicsDrama R Violence, Sexual Content, LanguageAbbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein1948Universal Pictures Co.

Most will recognize the star, Bela Lugosi, from his signature portrayal of Dracula (see Browning and Laemmle, 1931). In producing White Zombie, many of the sets from the classic movies Dracula (Browning and Laemmle, 1931) and Frankenstein (Laemmle and Whale, 1931) were re-used (Rhodes, 1995), a combination that, in a darkened lecture hall, can result in a memorable night time group viewing experience.\n\nThe movie is the story of a young couple’s trip to Haiti, where their wedding is to take place. But, this is no vision of Haiti as an idyllic Caribbean island; almost immediately after arriving on the island, the couple encounter groups of “zombies” populating patches of ground fog as the gloom of dusk becomes the dark of night. As the story unfolds, it soon becomes evident that Lugosi’s character (named Murder Legendre) is responsible for the presence of these zombies, delivering a powdery substance into drinks that transform the unwitting consumer into the walking dead, most of whom become slave labor for his plantation and sugar mill. Legendre becomes infatuated with the young bride to be, and pre-empts the wedding by turning the young woman into a zombie. In a classic good versus evil finale, the young groom must free his fiancée from the grips of Legendre’s pharmacology.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the movie, students are first asked about their reactions to the story. Several questions are then posed to draw the students into discussion, such as:\n\nWhat kind of agents might produce the effects seen in the walking dead, as well as the young bride to be?\n\nTo what extent does culture play a role in the effects of the zombie “powder”?\n\nSome aspects of White Zombie were based on a popular travelogue about Haiti in the 1920s, The Magic Island (Seabrook, 1929). Discussion of the Haitian penal code in the movie, for example, is drawn from that book (Rhodes, 1995). Why might someone want to create zombies?\n\nDiscussion of any of the questions above may lead to a far-reaching conversation on neuroscience. For example, Question 1 might lead to discussion of neurotransmitter systems and pharmacological antagonism; the physiology of the neuromuscular junction; diseases such as myasthenia gravis; perception and attentional processes; arousal and neuromodulatory circuits, or the ethical concerns of pharmacological treatments, to name just a few potential topics.\n\nExercise 3: Film Clips in Lectures\n\nThe use of full-length feature films as described in the neuro-cinema and film series exercises above can be a great adjunct to neuroscience education, but to incorporate film use within standard class periods it is generally more practical to use short excerpts. The distinct advantage of the use of “clips” is that they may be inserted into the course without taking significant amounts of time away from other classroom activities. Yet another advantage of using short excerpts is that an even larger selection of films becomes appropriate for use in neuroscience education.\n\nWhile any of the movies included in or above are suitable for such use, presents further title suggestions, including films with entirely implicit, tangential or momentary content relevant to neuroscience education.\n\nTable 3\n\nTitleYearReleased ByRunning TimeDirected ByFeaturingSpecific ContentGenre/RatingAndy Warhol Presents Frankenstein (AKA Flesh For Frankenstein)1974Triboro Entertainment Group1 hr., 36 mins.Paul MorrisseyUdo Kier, Monique Van Voorentransplantation, re-animation, science and society, ethicsHorror/Comedy R Sexual Content, Violence, Gore, LanguageCharlie Chan in Honolulu1938Twentieth Century Fox1 hr., 7 mins.H.

Short film clips can provide a purposeful transition from other course content; needed context for discussion to follow; or vivid illustration of a hard-to-grasp concept. Recent research in psychology instruction (Roskos-Ewoldsen and Roskos-Ewoldsen, 2001) suggests that the use of film clips can be an enjoyable part of class time, and similar to full-length film presentations, can aid in the understanding of lectures and overall subject mastery. Furthermore, as student interest may wax and wane across a class period, the judicious inclusion of a interesting short film clip may serve to maintain student engagement in the subject at hand. The instructor considering the occasional use of film clips for this purpose may find it useful to employ a variety of film titles and genres popular with the students’ age demographic, as what engages students might not be what is interesting or even tasteful to the instructor, however relevant to the course a particular clip may be (see Brumbaugh, 1940, for an interesting early study and discussion along these lines). One example from my own in-class use of film clips is the use of scenes depicting dental procedures from the movies Marathon Man (1976) and The Little Shop of Horrors (1960) in the discussion of pain mechanisms and modulation with my behavioral neuroscience class. In the scene from “Marathon Man”, a young Dustin Hoffman is put through agony at the hands of an aged former-Nazi torture specialist played by Lawrence Olivier. However, in the scene from The Little Shop of Horrors, a young Jack Nicholson is positively joyful to receive a similar experience at the hands of Semour-- the flower shop clerk, pretending to be a dentist. Both clips serve to focus attention on the subject of pain, and provide vividly contrasting examples of how the meaning of the situation and the experience of the individual interact in the interpretation and perception of pain.\n\nMany instructors have integrated the use of film clips into their classroom instruction beyond the illustrative and occasion-setting uses employed by this author. For further examination of the use of film clips in instruction, the reader may be interested in recent articles by Alexander and Waxman (2000), which discusse such use in a medical school setting, and Paddock et al. (2001), which describes the use of film clips within an undergraduate psychology course.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nMany thanks to the anonymous reviewers of this article for their suggestions and comments, and the members of the Faculty for Undergraduate Neuroscience “FUN-NET” electronic mailing list for their interest in discussing neuroscience-related feature films.\n\nFootnotes\n\nThe reader may enjoy visiting The Internet Movie Database website (us.imdb.com) which was employed in the verification of some cast and crew information, and invaluable in the preparation of this article.\n\nInstructors interested in mounting a film series not connected to course offerings should investigate United States Title 17 copyright law for limitations concerning presentations of films.
