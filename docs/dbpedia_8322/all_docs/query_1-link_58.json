        "text": "At the end of the 1970s, Irving Howe and Ruth Wisse predicted the demise of Jewish American fiction as a result of the process of acculturation affecting Jewish communities. However, the booming literary production of a younger generation in recent decades has called into question this announcement of the death of Jewish American fiction. Based on Marcus Hansen's theory of the third generation return, the current paper seeks to explore issues of identity and religion in the writing of Bernard Malamud and Nathan Englander, representatives of the second and the third generation of Jewish fiction, respectively. Malamud's storytelling portrays an all-embracing vision of Judaism in that all his characters are universal projections of humanity, while Englander's view on Judaism is that of a Jew raised in the strict yeshiva. However, his Orthodox upbringing permeates his writing entirely, shaping the unabashed way in which he views Jewish Orthodoxy and the Shoah.\n\nIn both the United States and France, Jewish fiction writers of the 1920s often invoked the idea of Jewish racial unity as a non-rational, uncontrollable force that separates Jews from the mainstream society irrespective of their conscious desire for integration. This genre of fiction reveals an ambivalent attitude towards race-thinking. On the one hand, the notion that there are intractable physical differences between groups threatened the Jews’ status as fully privileged co-citizens. On the other hand, a racialized self-understanding provided them with a way to articulate the intangible bonds of community that their official status as a purely “religious” group normally held them back from openly expressing. The common trope of the failed Jewish-Gentile romance best expresses French and American Jews’ dual desire for acceptance and distinctiveness. A sense of racial identity often leads protagonists to reject a non-Jewish lover or spouse and draw strength from a renewed sense of connection with the Jewish people. More often than not, however, these figures are left with feelings of ambivalence and regret, as they realize that their universalist dream of uniting with someone from a different “racial” background is not possible in the real world, where their Jewish particularism inevitably dooms such relationships to failure."
