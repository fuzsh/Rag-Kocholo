        "text": "The melting pot vs. salad bowl metaphors\n\nMany people want to move to the U.S.A for work or school.\n\nUnderstand the terms and what makes this multicultural nation so unique.\n\nThe Cultural Melting Pot vs. the Salad Bowl\n\nMany of us grew up hearing the metaphor(1), “the U.S. is a melting pot(2),” a country where all kinds of different cultures melt together to form one common culture. However, a more modern metaphor suggests that America might actually be a salad bowl (3), a country where a society integrates different cultures while still allowing people to retain their individual cultural identities. This blog will explore the melting pot vs. salad bowl metaphors\n\nWe’ll explore both ideas and try to figure out whether or not the U.S. is a melting pot or a salad bowl. If you want more information on life in the U.S. as an immigrant, be sure to check out podcast #14 Land of Opportunity byRide the Vibes and be sure to review our last blog Slang and Tips To Date Online.\n\nDefining Multicultural America\n\nAmerican culture is paradoxical(4) because, though it exists, there is no authentic American culture. It is hard to define as one entity because it is a mix of thousands of different cultures from around the world. This is part of the confusion between the melting pot vs. salad bowl analogies.\n\nThe Origins of the Melting Pot\n\nThe term “melting pot” was already in use by the 1780s (about the time of birth of the United States of America), but nobody knows when this phrase was coined.\n\nAs waves of European immigrants from different countries migrated to the States in the 19th century, they were expected to become American. This essentially meant that their old culture would be replaced; they were supposed to conform(5) to American values.\n\nDid the Melting Pot Concept Work?\n\nDid this work? It certainly never worked as well as advertised. Sure, most immigrants had to learn English, learned some American history, and abided by its laws and political ideology(6), but at the same time, there was still a lot of racism and xenophobia, and immigrants still hung on to their old cultures.\n\nRacial intolerance created segregated(7) social groups. Generally, the Irish hung out with the Irish, the Chinese hung out with the Chinese, and so on. In the 1900s, more and more people from around the world were arriving in the U.S. Movements like the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s began to change the way Americans looked at race.\n\nWe began to teach people about minorities (especially African Americans), and there were pushes to make America more accepting of cultural differences, but to this day, integrating everyone into one society is still a massive challenge.\n\nIs the U.S. Truly a Melting Pot Then?\n\nIt wouldn’t be accurate to say that America is in no way a melting pot. There are still parts of American culture that do adhere to this concept.\n\nBasic social interactions, like shaking hands, giving gifts on Christmas (even if you don’t celebrate the actual holiday) and how people converse in public are all aspects of the melting pot that do actually exist in the U.S.\n\nThat said, we might need a better, more modern analogy to describe what it’s like to fit into the fabric of America.\n\nThe Cultural Salad Bowl Analogy\n\nA salad is filled with different colors, different smells, and a variety of different vegetables. We can tell a tomato from a cucumber. However, the tomato and cucumber fit in the same dish, and can even complement one another.\n\nSince the 1960s, the U.S. has been compared to a salad bowl, which many people consider to be a more apt(8) analogy. Much like the different vegetables, different cultures coexist but retain their own identities.\n\nThe dressing that gives the salad its unique flavor is the law and the free market. All cultures need to abide by these rules. Besides that, cultures are free to speak their own language (though some Americans can be prickly about this), pray how they wish, and practice their own customs.\n\nAsians still celebrate Lunar New Year, Latin Americans still celebrate Día De los Muertos, and there are all sorts of pocket communities that hold onto their native cultures and customs. There are even different churches, mosques, synagogues(9), and temples that represent many world religions.\n\nLastly, think of relationships and marriage or some of the more complex cultural elements. There is no law dictating who you marry or how you conduct your wedding. Different cultures are free to keep to their own traditions so long as they do not break the law.\n\nThe Salad Bowl Analogy Might Be the Better Fit\n\nIt’s not exactly a melting pot vs. salad bowl. America is both a melting pot and a salad bowl in some respects, but the salad bowl model seems to be winning out. People have become more tolerant of other cultures in the U.S., and it’s okay to worship different gods, celebrate different holidays, speak different languages, and so on.\n\nThe salad bowl model allows for more tolerance of other cultures, and while problems like racism and xenophobia still exist, the education system is generally doing a better job of informing students about different cultures and embracing(10) differences rather than holding onto prejudices.\n\nThe U.S. isn’t a perfect country by any means, but it’s a unique multicultural experiment with a lot of great aspects. Together, people from around the world are showing us that the future can be a salad bowl full of tolerance, diversity, and unique flavors that can only be discovered by embracing our differences.\n\nAmericans & Koreans Swap School Lunches\n\nVocabulary\n\n1. metaphor (n.)\n\nDef. a figure of speech in which a phrase is applied to an object or action to which it’s not literally applicable.\n\nEx.
