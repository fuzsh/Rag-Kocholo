        "text": "Splinter Cell is one of those genre-defining franchises that ignited the love for stealth gameplay for many players. Ubisoft’s foray into this field yielded great results for the publisher, as it spawned one of the most iconic stealth games, rivaled only by Metal Gear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile all the fans know of Sam Fisher’s deadly arsenal of skills, weapons, and gadgets, what if we turned back the clock? We would get to see a more uninitiated Sam and many fans believe this could make for a good story!\n\nFans Want to See a Splinter Cell Game Set in Sam’s Past\n\nThe stealth action genre has several games to offer, with Metal Gear and Splinter Cell being the two that should instantly come to people’s minds. While Sam Fisher is incredibly cool, one does wonder about the trials he had to endure to reach his level of prowess.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWould love a Sam Fisher prequel game as a Navy SEAL\n\nbyu/Visual-Beginning5492 inSplintercell\n\nReddit user Visual-Beginning549 has a similar wish to see Sam in his early life and even proposes a game that could take the player through this journey. This is a new request, as requests for a remake continue to go unanswered, but it could lead to some interesting exposition.\n\nThey claim the early missions could be for the Navy SEALS before Sam is eventually recruited into Third Echelon. This narrative could provide an interesting transition from action to stealth-focused missions, and it’s an idea that appeals to several fans.\n\nComment\n\nbyu/Visual-Beginning5492 from discussion\n\ninSplintercell\n\nAnother reply states that the community has been discussing the story potential of this period for a while now. Not only would players get a look at his professional training, but also at how he evolved as a person due to personal challenges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nComment\n\nbyu/Visual-Beginning5492 from discussion\n\ninSplintercell\n\nOne commenter feels it’s the only way a new game can be made, as all the other characters have been taken off the board.\n\nComment\n\nbyu/Visual-Beginning5492 from discussion\n\ninSplintercell\n\nUbisoft has kept the Splinter Cell franchise dormant for a long time, and this could be due to a single decision made in Blackist. But, if it was going to experience a revival, this seems like a good way to make it happen.\n\nUbisoft is Currently Attending to Titles Set to Launch Soon\n\nThe studio has several new projects slated to launch soon, with Assassin’s Creed Shadows and Star Wars Outlaws being among the most well-known. While fans have been asking about the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake, we now know that isn’t going to be coming until 2026 rolls around.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAssassin’s Creed Shadows has been making waves since it was announced, and not always in the best ways. Many controversies have spawned around the usage of a black samurai in the game, and that has been only the tip of the iceberg.\n\nWith a launch date set for November, the game could end up being quite the divisive project from Ubisoft. Many fans are claiming the controversies are blown out of proportion, but it’s still an uphill battle for the studio.\n\nWhich existing Ubisoft franchise would you like to see get a new game? Let us know in the comments below!"
