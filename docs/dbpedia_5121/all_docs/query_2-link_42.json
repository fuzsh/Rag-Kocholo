        "text": "This is part of a series of four reviews examining the specific pros and cons for each of the four sixth-gen console games in the franchise Splinter Cell. The games in chronological order are: Splinter Cell, Pandora Tomorrow, Chaos Theory and Double Agent.\n\nSplinter Cell ranks number 3 of 4 in my recommendation. It is significantly better than Double Agent but a little worse than Pandora Tomorrow.\n\nPlot\n\nThis was one of the last Splinter Cell games I played. Judging by the fact that I can’t remember the plot reading it back on Wikipedia, I assume I learned from past experience and skipped through the whole thing.\n\nAttacks, Weapons and Gadgets\n\nThere is no optic cable or “peek under” option for doorways in the original Splinter Cell. What is on the other side of that door is a mystery, and you’d hope that the enemies are situated in such a way that you can get in without being spotted, but it isn’t always the case; see “Glitches” below.\n\nA unique feature of the original Splinter Cell was the ability to pick up first aid kits and take them with you where you wanted. That was useful. It was changed into zoned medikits, each offering multiple usage. This wasn’t especially helpful, since the enemy of levelled gaming is feeling the need to traverse back to the possible site of the last first aid kit in order to heal after things have gone tits up. They were however designated per level – you couldn’t carry them over. You’d think it might have occurred to someone that Sam might need all the emergency blister treatments he can get.\n\nThermal vision wasn’t introduced until Pandora Tomorrow and the night vision in Splinter Cell was annoyingly fuzzy, not only making it difficult to see but also ruining some of the visuals of the game. I get the impression you were supposed to take them off sometimes and sit in the darkness, something I rarely did for Chaos Theory; it it got too bright, you could usually turn off or destroy lights. Less so in earlier incarnations.\n\nSplinter Cell also has binoculars as an item you can use. It isn’t especially useful because they aren’t very good, but in theory this is a good idea for any level where you aren’t equipped with a sniper rifle. Chaos Theory’s EEV didn’t zoom in particularly far, though it did serve other functions; I’m quite surprised that an advanced pair of binoculars wasn’t worked into most of the games under a quick select button. More useful than some of the functions.\n\nStealth\n\nOn thing that you could do in all the other games after Pandora was knock people out from the front. That way if you got caught up short rummaging in the master’s drawers, you could quickly turn around and punch out the alerter before he can call the whole of the US army to take care of you. This option is absent from the original Splinter Cell, making the stealth much harder – but also less effective.\n\nSince perfectionists like stealth games, suffice to say most of us won’t be happy with a black mark on the record saying we’ve been spotted by the enemy. That mark should suffice, rather than effectively stopping the game and forcing the player to start again, which is what happens often because once spotted and half shot to death, it can be very hard to escape and think of another way in that won’t alert the already alerted guards. This forces you to be quick, but this in turn forces you to be sloppy, making it more likely you’ll make the jump at the wrong moment. Which is more likely to happen the more times you have to repeat the section, because you’ll get bored, frustrated and steadily more careless.\n\nThe Alarm System\n\nSplinter Cell games vary in their alarm raising. From Chaos Theory, levels either had no alarm level as such, but rather alerts which would only alert other NPCs in the vicinity. In other words, the one whose pants you tried to pull down in public would yell “HELP!” Levels with alarms would have panels which enemies would have to reach in order to call the alarm.\n\nIn most of the games, you could usually tell which buggers had tattled because they would usually be within sight of you. In the original Splinter Cell however, sometimes it wasn’t clear at all who had raised to alarm, particularly annoying on the levels where one alarm is an instant mission fail that restarts you at the checkpoint. At least the game had the good courtesy to keep your alarm level in the corner, so you knew how many times you’d been caught mid-public-poo.\n\nOn the flip side, you could destroy alarm panels, preventing people from being able to access them. Ah, the satisfaction of seeing them flee for the panels, only to find that I’ve shot it already. Foiled! Keep looking, oh camouflaged one. Keep your vulnerable back to me.\n\nGame Design & Unique Gameplay\n\nFrom Chaos Theory onwards, when you opened the door stealthily, you could open it the whole way. In this and Pandora Tomorrow, you can only open it a crack and then have to open it properly. In this game there is no ability to sneak a peak through the crack under the door, so it may be helpful. However, you can in all the other games, rendering opening the door stealthily a bit pointless.\n\nSplinter Cell started its franchise with sniffer dogs accompanying some of the guards and took this out for Chaos Theory, though re-introduced this later. The original was particularly unforgiving, as the dogs smelled rather than looked for your smelly wetsuit, so hiding in anything but water didn’t distract them. This usually meant you had to react quickly to the dogs, at risk of alerting the guards, or sit out in an open patch of water and risk being seen. Not ideal.\n\nData sticks were an addition of this game which went missing for a while. In Chaos Theory, the only way to get information was to overhear it, interrogate or hack. As perfectly fun as this all was, accessing door codes by picking them up on a thoughtlessly abandoned memory stick was quite useful. You didn’t have to read this information yourself for Sam to know it – just as well, as you had to wade through a load of useless rubbish to get to it. Records of people complaining about blocked toilets, etc. I like Easter eggs, but of a certain calibre, if you don’t mind. I’m above wee and bottom jokes.\n\nShoot cameras ability – One well-aimed shot on the glass of the camera would usually get rid of it without raising too much alarm.\n\nAlternative play modes\n\nNone\n\nAI\n\nAnnoyingly, enemies don’t walk towards your distractions if you’re too close to the source of them, but rather like weird mindreaders come straight towards you. So, if you create a noise a little way away from you, or move out the way – with the intention of sneaking up behind someone and giving them a nasty shock – you may instead find yourself a sitting duck, boxed into your handy corner like a beaver in a trap.\n\nOn the flip side, the other games felt that firing a bullet close by to someone’s head generally warranted severe alarm. This means, rather than merely getting suspicious, they would swiftly empty whole clips into the silent darkness, hoping to catch you with your pants down – and often, they did. You had to be careful to make muffling sounds and leave some distance firstly between the gun barrel and any NPCs, as the loudest sound is the point of exit, and secondly where the bullet lands, since people do tend to notice bullets raining down on them, or bullet holes spontaneously forming in the walls. In Splinter Cell, however, you can shoot out a light right next to someone’s head and they’ll wonder aloud what could have made the lights go out.\n\nGlitches\n\nThis is the earliest, so the most glitchy. Messages coming in through your earpieces can freeze on the screen, or sometimes repeat themselves, particularly at the start of levels. The game doesn’t seem to like it if you try to take off before squatting quietly for a moment and listening to your instructions like a good boy. Even if you’ve heard them a million times. If Splinter Cell was a sandbox game, I would have abandoned the mission, flew back to whatever bunker makes our base of operation, and systematically polished off all my advisers. Shaddap!\n\nThe least polished of the games, it is also possible to exploit certain glitches to cheat slightly. Unlike the Chaos Theory sneaky cheats, these ones don’t feel purposeful. For example, in one level, walking in through the double doors is supposed to set off an automatic gun. Failing that, the guard next to it might catch you. However, he can’t really see you from the side, and the gun can’t see you unless you take a couple of steps from the door. So, if you take one step forward and turn to the right, you can grab the guard without getting caught by the gun. I only found out that this wasn’t what you were meant to do when I read a walkthrough outlining something far more convoluted.\n\nEaster Eggs\n\nThere are precious few Easter Eggs in the original Splinter Cell. For better or for worse, a good proportion of the people you grabbed in Chaos Theory had something to say. Sometimes it was related to your mission, sometimes not, usually a mixture. You didn’t have to listen to it, but it did add some humour and colour. Most people in Splinter Cell whom you grab you can’t talk to.\n\nControls & Game Mechanics\n\nEarlier I mentioned that you have to approach enemies from the back to knock them out by hand. Turns out that the game thinks “the front” also includes the sides, right up to the bits 170 and 190 degrees from the NPCs eyeline. In other words, if you are even slightly off, prepare to get caught.\n\nOh dear, it’s the biggest crouch-mess-up since the Goldeneye standing-up-to-die mechanism. Just like then, in Splinter Cell certain actions lead your character to automatically straighten up. Since in Splinter Cell, quite unlike Goldeneye, crouching is your best friend, this can be awkward. Shuffling over a rock while crouching feels very stealthy until you suddenly find your head bobbing up into the spotlight like a curious pheasant.\n\nSimilarly, there is also no shuffle-and-hang option. Being able to crawl over a fence or wall and know for a fact that you can hang from it is something needed in a climbing stealth game. Shuffling over a wall in the original Splinter Cell doesn’t let you hang, instead Sam drops over the edge, electronic eyes gazing dumbly into the middle distance, to his imminent doom.\n\nHaving got used to being able to put on night vision with one button, I was displeased to find that in the original Splinter Cell it was a button combination. Since in the first Splinter Cell particularly you’ll want to switch your night vision more often than your underwear, it gets wearing after all while. Let us never underestimate the power, destructive or constructive, of the one-button function.\n\nBetween Splinter Cell and Pandora Tomorrow, the button for pulling your legs up when hanging from a pole, and dropping down on top of people like an idiot, has been inexplicably switched, leading to many pointless mistakes. Another pointless swap was made between the non-lethal attack and lethal attack while grabbing. Perhaps they felt that L for non-lethal was counterintuitive. At least in Splinter Cell though, you can see the keypad number (if you know it) while looking at the keypad. In Pandora Tomorrow and Double Agent, you have to memorise it from the pop-up before activating the keypad.\n\nThe wall jump functionality is different too, needing to jump off a wall at a 90 degree angle in order to climb. This function is better utilised in the original Splinter Cell, compared to Chaos Theory which used to wall jump rarely in narrow corridor-type environments to knock people out from above. Fun as this was, in the original Splinter Cell the wall jump is for climbing.\n\nMap Design\n\nThe great advantage of having more control infrastructure for climbing is that this then lends itself to an interesting array of vertical environments, such as deep fan vents and cliff edges. One result of this is more outside environments, which I often preferred as they were less claustrophobic. However, a well-designed indoor level can allow for easier planning and evasion. You can see the enemy closer, learn his patrol and hang upside down above him as long as you like until the moment comes. More open spaces prevent that, and for all their prettiness require a lot of caution.\n\nThe mix of levels is generally good, though I had serious qualms about the final level, which should have been – and in many ways was – a varied and thus interesting level. But good map design is about more than interest, it’s about options, interaction, hiding places and generally functionality for its purpose. A stealth game needs to provide a variety of obvious and not-so-obvious approaches for each section of the level. When the only way in is to sneak around the guy with the awkward patrol that you can’t see from your starting position, you’re likely to get caught and will have no way to get around the problem.\n\nSaving Systems\n\nThe original Splinter Cell only lets you save at certain times, and has a checkpoint system. The chunks aren’t small or easy, either. Gah! This makes the game less like one long smooth stealth adventure and more like an arcade game – bite size level chunks to be repeated until beaten, reliant on a finicky level of care each time.\n\nInstruction\n\nThere is no on-the-job training in Splinter Cell, rather a reasonably simple but only vaguely interesting training level, where you have to wait for Lambert to spell everything out to you before you can set off, toddling over broken glass while trying not to make any noise.\n\nSplinter Cell also kindly makes some of its options invisible, such as being able to open the door a crack and peer through.\n\nHere are the four games from best to worst in my estimation:\n\n1) Chaos Theory\n\n2) Pandora Tomorrow\n\n3) Splinter Cell [original]\n\n4) Double Agent"
