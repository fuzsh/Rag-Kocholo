        "text": "Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell: Blacklist is an action / stealth game developed by Ubisoft Toronto, Ubisoft Montreal and Ubisoft Shanghai, published for PlayStation 3, Wii U, Xbox 360 and PC in 2013. As we can read on Wikipedia, in November 2010 Jade Raymond from Ubisoft Toronto announced that the studio was developing a new Splinter Cell game.\n\nDuring the Microsoft’s press conference at E3 2012, Splinter Cell: Blacklist was officially revealed with a beta video that you can see below. One major difference is the plot and interactive torture sequence in the beta. After a major uproar from critics, it was announced by the creative director of the game, Maxime Béland that the now dubbed “interrogation” sequences are rendered cutscenes and the only choice made by the player is to either let the target live or die.\n\nUbisoft responded with an official statement regarding the removal of the controversial scene:\n\n“As with other game features, the storyline evolves as part of the standard development process. Based on how the game has progressed, we felt that this scene no longer fit in the context of the game, so we decided to remove it. Splinter Cell Blacklist, like previous Splinter Cell titles, has always tried to keep the topics and themes relevant and current. Splinter Cell Blacklist explores moral choices and dark themes through the concept of the Fifth Freedom; a recurring theme in the franchise.”\n\n“Definitely we are not going to see when the game’s coming out that there are torture scenes in it. That scene is not there any more,” said producer Andrew Wilson “The first thing I’d say about that is that possibly there was missing context – and in an unabridged snapshot, it seemed like pretty tough material.”\n\nThe second major change is the plot: in the beta the group known as The Engineers are a quasi-league of nations rather than a borderless terrorist group that has the national backing of twelve unnamed nations found in the final game.\n\nThe level itself was unchanged during development other than who inhabits the camp and level introduction. The camp in the beta was labeled as “ Jadid Basecamp”. In the final game, only the location is given: Mirawa, Iraq. The introduction of the level in the beta has Sam Fisher wearing an enemy uniform and carrying a body into the camp. In the final product, Sam Fisher is air-dropped into the level after enemies near the LZ (landing zone) are eliminated by sniper support.\n\nSome minor changes between the beta and final game are:\n\nThe level’s name colors are changed: green in the beta, white for the released game.\n\nChanges in the HUD (heads up display) such as weapon icons.\n\nThe choice to either kill or spare Jadid Haidos isn’t in the beta.\n\nJadid Haidos’ model is changed between the beta/ released game.\n\nIcons for the mark and execute are changed.\n\nSounds for in the process of being detected and finally being detected are changed. Also, the words “Warning” and “Detected” do not appear in the final game.\n\nThe icons for the three play styles: ghost, panther, and assault are not in the beta.\n\nThere is no ability to call in an air strike from the Paladin as shown in the beta is not available in the final game.\n\nThere is no ability to use explosive breaches as in the beta.\n\nDrone strike are not as readily available as in the beta.\n\nThe mission’s endings are changed between the beta and the final game.\n\nJeff Wheaton noticed a number of notable differences (in chronological order of the video):\n\nThe level shown is not in the final game. No exact designs are taken from it, though many of its assets do appear.\n\nSam is never wearing the enemy uniform in the final game, nor are there any player-driven animations of him carrying an unconscious or dead character.\n\nAt no point in the final game do button prompts appear in any language other than the selected localization\n\nThe animations for most of the stuff in the cutscenes are absent from the final game.\n\nThe icons for marks in the final game are slightly different.\n\nA lot of cutscene dialogue never appears in the final game.\n\nA lot of HUD differences\n\nSeveral plot differences. In the final game, the Blacklist is masterminded by a borderless group of individuals calling themselves The Engineers, not a group of nations.\n\nDifferent sound for being detected. The final game also does not feature a “Warning” message.\n\nThe Ghost, Panther, and Assault point indicators are absent from the entire demo.\n\nThere is no instance of being able to trigger a UAV strike in the manner shown in the demo in the final game.\n\nJadid’s dialogue is different than it was in the final game, and no Spare or Kill option is given.\n\nVery interesting nonetheless! Thanks a lot to Jeff and Matt Redmond for the contribution\n\nBeta Video:\n\nTom Clancy’s Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow (also know as Shadow Strike during its development) is a third-person stealth game in the Splinter Cell series, developed and published by Ubisoft Shanghai in 2004. Below you can see a video compiled by Silenceofthehills, with lots of early concept arts and beta screens. Text and video annotations in the video help explain the differences between the earlier planned renditions and the final version of various spots in each area.\n\nAs seen in the video, a fully missing level map is viewed under the first game‘s HUD. Since the first game had cut a level and used it as an extra in another version of the game, its quite possible that these shots are from a missing level. Its also possible that these are merely early renditions of a previous level, or even simply a test level considering the unaltered HUD.\n\nSecondly, we can also see the previous incarnation of the PS2 and GameCube port before it had be delayed and taken under various graphical tweaks to ensure the artwork was nearer to par with the original versions of the game. This is also available in the GameInformer article scan as well, which also oddly contains a beta HUD akin to that of the online mode’s. This HUD was also apparently shared between all versions of the game.\n\nBelow is the direct quote on this from Gamespot itself, posted on February 4, 2004 by Justin Calvert.\n\n“Ubisoft has today announced that while the Xbox, PC, GBA, and cell phone versions of Splinter Cell Pandora Tomorrow are still on track for release next month, the PS2 and GameCube versions will now launch at a later date. The only reason given for the delay is that the development team is committed to making sure that the other two console versions are as good as the Xbox version.”\n\nThanks to Silenceofthehills for the contribution!\n\nImages:\n\nVideos:\n\nSplinter Cell: Conviction is a stealth / action game developed by Ubisoft Montreal, released in April, 2010 for the Xbox 360 and PC. The project was originally announced on May, 2007 when Ubisoft released a trailer for the game. It depicted a more rugged-looking Sam with long hair and a fully-grown beard. He had the ability to blend in with the environment, interact with tables and chairs and engage in hand-to-hand combat with enemies.\n\nThe game was due for release in November, 2007. However, it missed its initial launch date and on May, 2008 Xbox World 360 magazine reported that Splinter Cell: Conviction was “officially on hold” and that the game had been taken “back to the drawing board.” While Ubisoft never confirmed this, they announced that the game had been pushed back to the 2009-10 fiscal year.\n\nThe game resurfaced at E3 2009 with a completely new visual style and a more casual-looking Sam. The developers confirmed that the “new” Conviction had been in development since early 2008, commenting that “the gameplay has evolved a lot” and “the visual direction is simply much better.” [Info from Wikipedia]\n\nWe can say that the original Splinter Cell Conviction was cancelled, as the final game and gameplay look very different from what was shown in 2007.\n\nThanks to Userdante for the contribution!
