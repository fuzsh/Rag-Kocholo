        "text": "Tom Clancy gets a new sound as composers Sascha Dikiciyan and Cris Velasco have scored the main title theme and all of the cinematics for Splinter Cell: Double Agent, the latest installment in the popular Splinter Cell series.\n\n\"Ubisoft asked us to provide a score that would match the narrative in the game,\" says Dikiciyan of the duo's involvement. \"We created a gritty electronica feel with cinematic orchestra to push the emotional side of the game to a new level.\"\n\nThe two are no strangers to the world of vidoegame composition, having scored the likes of Dark Messiah, Spy Hunter: Nowhere to Run, and Hellgate: London since they joined forces in 2005.\n\n\"Sascha and Cris' unique style was the perfect match for what we were looking for,\" says Sylvain Brunet, Sound Producer for Ubisoft. \"The latest episode of the 'Splinter Cell' franchise is more emotional than the previous installments. We needed music that would reflect the new dramatic storyline, and this is exactly what Sascha and Cris delivered with their main theme.\"\n\n\"Main Theme from Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent\" - MP3\n\nIf you yearn for more info about the game check it out here."
