        "text": "Ubisoft needs to release Splinter Cell remaster collection for Xb1, PS4 and PC\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Splintercell/comments/4a5q3n/splinter_cell_remaster_collection_for_current_gen/\n\nOriginally posted by Reddit post:\n\nSo I just started watching the Splinter Cell games from the beginning again on YouTube because I only have Conviction and Blacklist for PC and thought about that there should be a remaster collection for Xbox One, PS4 and PC that includes all the DLC for the games (if you own the games on PC or at least some of them, you would need to pay only maybe $15-20 for a limited time only after launch).\n\nI personally would love to see the games brought to this generation of consoles with new graphics and maybe 1080p as the default resolution. Of course Blacklist won't be much different but it will be close to what the PC version currently looks like. Also Pandora Tomorrow isn't available to PC execpt through ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or via a disk version on eBay. Also I heard the games have few performance issues on PC, for example Conviction runs at 25 fps at 1080p max settings no v-sync on my GTX 750 Ti and i5-3450 Windows 10 64-Bit computer. That card is 3 years ahead of what was available when Conviction was released so it should run at 60-100 fps.\n\nAlso as for the first game, they should add the PS2 pre-rendered cutscenes as they added more to the story, like Blaustein and Madison being captured, Sam diving with bunch of great white sharks, Wilkes finding the Fishers, Sam getting his subdermal radio, Wilkes dying, etc. as well as the Nuclear Power Plant mission as it was only mentioned in the HD port but it served as a major plot-point in the story, and the PC exclusive mission where you have kill Philip Masse, ending the Georgian Information Crisis.\n\nI would at least want a remaster of Splinter Cell 1-Conviction as PT isn't available on PC and Conviction and what I heard that Double Agent are having massive performance issues and Blacklist being backwards compatible for Xbox One (I have the Deluxe Edition on PC so I really don't care for myself, but for other people who don't have the money to buy Xbox 360 or just don't want to downgrade).\n\nAnyways, if they made a remaster of the 6 games for current gen platforms + PC, I would like the collection play like the Master Chief collection, where you are brought to the main menu of all the games and from there you can pick the games and missions. Also you can check out the options menu, extras, collectables (for the games that support them or if they add them in the remaster) and go to the multiplayer or deniable ops/extra game-modes. As for Blacklist, if it gets remastered, the game would simply bring you to the Paladin when you select it from the \"select game\" menu and everything would work just like in the old gen/old PC version.\n\nOh yeah, and the background music should change between few of the the 6 games' themes, for example the 1st games main menu song, pandora tomorrow's menu theme + maybe some other theme, Chaos Theory's menu theme + some other themes, Double Agent's menu theme + some other themes, Conviction's menu theme + main theme (or the Sarah Fisher violin theme, dunno what's it called) + the theme that plays when Victor Coste is interrogated and when he mentions Lambert's death (that part of the song really fit the athmosphere of the game and was really memorable) and finally Blacklist's start up menu theme, the pause menu theme, the loadout menu theme and finally the co-op/SvM Conviction Sarah Fisher main theme remix-thing. Or they could make like in Master Chief Collection, add one or two themes that play in the main menu and when you go to each game's select screens, the menu changes to that spesific game's themes.\n\nThank you for reading this. I also hope Splinter Cell 7 is released next year.\n\nIt would also be nice if someone could start a petition for this or inform a Ubisoft developer about this idea. Next generation should witness the greatness of these games"
