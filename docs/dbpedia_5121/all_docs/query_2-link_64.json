        "text": "Script written by Ian Astraquillo\n\n#10: \"Ghost Recon\" (2001)\n\nBefore Call of Duty's: Ghosts, there was Tom Clancy's Ghosts. After the rocket success of the first Rainbow Six, game developer, Red Storm Entertainment, quickly realized the goldmine name of Tom Clancy and scrambled to create an entirely separate ongoing series. The result was this breakthrough title, introducing us to the, quote-unquote, fictional, U.S. special ops force, whom in this game are tasked with suppressing an ultranationalist uprising in a then-future 2008, Russia. The first game in its series, this sui-generis is credited as the game that solidified the tactical shooter as a bankable genre as well as seguing FPSâ€™s into the modern age.\n\n#9: \"Splinter Cell: Double Agent\" (2006)\n\nAfter the unprecedented success of the preceding titles in the series, which we'll get to later, Splinter Cell developer, Ubisoft, looked to double-downed on the success of their '05 game-changer with the release of two '06 sequels. The superior was the console title \"Double Agent\", where players returned as NSA superspy badass, Sam Fischer, who goes into deep undercover shortly after his daughter's death. Despite having two different renditions during the seventh-gen transition, Double Agent was praised for its story's themes of morality and deception as well as its evolved stealth-action gameplay.\n\n#8: \"Splinter Cell\" (2002)\n\nAs the first Tom Clancy game developed for the sixth generation consoles, this title was bound to be a revolutionary treat from conception. Taking two years to complete, the final product resulted in one of the more beautifully designed and tactical-based Tom Clancy narratives upon its release. While some critics panned the game for its then unpopular trial and error gameplay style, Splinter Cell was ultimately immortalized for its writing, graphics, and mechanics. Garnering widespread industry and fan praise that's still vivid today, giving Solid Snake a decent run for his money.\n\n#7: \"H.A.W.X.\" (2009)\n\nNostalgic players longing for the days of the arcade-flight simulators will have fun manning the sticks of these bad birds. An acronym for High Altitude Warfare Experimental squadron, H.A.W.X. puts you in the cockpit as a U.S. Air Force Pilot turned Private Military Contractor combatant, taking you on awesome hyper-intense strafe and dogfight missions around the globe. Loaded with upscale and well-detailed graphics and featuring a whopping fifty fighter jets, it is without a doubt one of the more underrated Tom Clancy titles, if not arguably from all the seventh gen console games, despite quickly spawning a sequel the following year.\n\n#6: \"Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter 2\" (2007)\n\nOkay, let's get this out of the way, this is the game we all picked up for having such a pretty cover case art. You know it's true. Then again, that superficiality paid off, didn't it? Taking place immediately after the events of its predecessor, Advanced Warfighter 2 puts you back in the boots of Major Scott Mitchell, whose Ghost unit continues their ongoing mission to suppress a spreading civil unrest in South America. Though not the groundbreaking and graphic marvel that GRAW was, we're giving the medal to its superb successor for amping up the details, remastering the sound, and removing all the bugs.\n\n#5: \"Rainbow Six\" (1998)\n\nBeautifully exemplifying why 1998 was the year to be on the shoulder of the PC-gaming giant was this title - the one and only classic that launched Tom Clancy's video games into franchise territory. At its release, veteran players of the genre were bewildered, but nonetheless attracted to this game's novelty mechanics and then migraine-inducing difficulty. Further praised was the innovative sound design, inspiring reviewers to cite a deep immersive experience as part of their run-through in the game. Though its console counterparts received more flak than fandom, Rainbow Six became the fifth most downloaded game in any format by the end of its release year.\n\n#4: \"Splinter Cell: Blacklist\" (2013)\n\nWhile we were thrilled by 2010's action-packed \"Conviction\", our seventh-gen pick goes to \"Blacklist\" for its return to the series' roots, implementing improved sandboxes and a darker stealth style of gameplay. A direct follow-up to \"Conviction\", Fischer, now voiced by newcomer Eric Johnson, returns in the newly established Fourth Echelon, who are tasked with stopping a new terrorist organization known as The Engineers. While \"Blacklist\" failed to meet Ubisoft's sales expectations, it didn't fail longtime Fischer fanboys and aficionados of the genre, praising its story, multiplayer, mission designs, and the massively expanded variety in executing those missions. Our only real complaint? We miss Michael Ironside.\n\n#3: \"Rainbow Six Vegas\" (2006)\n\nUbisoft hit the jackpot with these games. With the first title released days after the PS3's launch, \"Vegas\" served as a headlining foray for Sony and Tom Clancy fanboys into the next generation of gaming. In both games, players command a new rainbow unit out to stop a terrorist ringleader, bringing them into the lines of Sin City. With the introduction of a new aiming, cover, and health system as well as improved and harder-to-kill AI enemies, Vegas 1, as well as it's excellent sequel, garnered non-stop rave reviews, taking home awards for its perfect blend of style and substance.\n\n#2: \"Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear\" (1999)\n\nServing as the first non-expansion sequel to original game, Rogue Spear was the highly anticipated title that computer users everywhere were aching to get their hands on. Building on the hyper-realism that made the Rainbow Six successful, Red Storm Entertainment upped the ante for PC gamers by boosting AI intelligence and with more hostage and teamwork-based situations, drowning mouse controllers and keyboards in palm sweat like never before. By the end of 2001, both Rogue Spear and the its original predecessor had sold nearly half a million accumulated units, paving the way for new add-ons, features, and expansions prior to a new and official sequel.\n\nBefore we gear up for our probably obvious #1, let's take a look at a few honorable mentions:\n\n\"The Hunt for Red October\" (1987 / 90)\n\n\"The Sum of All Fears\" (1992)\n\n\"SSN\" (1996)\n\n\"Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow\" (2004)\n\n\"EndWar\" (2008)\n\n#1: \"Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory\" (2005)\n\nYeah, you didn't see this guy coming, right? Serving as the third game in the Splinter Cell series, Chaos Theory was the first to receive the adult-only M rating for its significantly darker nature, showcasing bloodier confrontations and more inhumane interrogation tactics. In addition to the beautifully fine-tuned stealth mechanics, the game introduced a new close-encounter combat system, demonstrating Fischer's lethal melee capacities with a knife. Selling 2.5 million units less than a month after its release, Chaos Theory garnered universal acclaim for all its console renditions, with remastered HD versions of the game being released for future generation systems due to high demand.\n\nDo you agree with our list, which Tom Clancy game had you mixing up strategies?
