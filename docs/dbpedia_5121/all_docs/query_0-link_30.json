        "text": "There are things in this world that we are not meant to know: secret organisations that operate at the highest level of government. Their operatives can slip into enemy territory, complete their mission, and slip out again without anyone ever knowing they were there. Such people are known as Splinter Cells.\n\nSam Fisher is just such a man. The veteran soldier has been called out of retirement and recruited by Third Echelon, a secret US government group determined to stop a dangerous new dictator who is using techno-terrorism to bring chaos to the world. Set in the not-so-distant future, Splinter Cell puts you in the role of Sam, highly trained in deadly combat techniques and a crack shot with a variety of high-tech weapons.\n\nBut Splinter Cell is no mere shoot 'em up. As a lone operative, often deep in enemy territory, Sam must rely on stealth to complete his mission. This involves either sticking to the shadows or shooting the lights and using Sam's trademark night vision goggles to find your way. A light meter in the corner of the screen shows how visible you are to the enemy. But you'll also have to rely equally on your ears. Heavy footsteps or walking across broken glass can trigger an enemy's keen senses, when they'll come looking for the source of the sound. Despite his age, Sam is pretty nimble. For instance, if the enemy in question is walking down a corridor towards Sam, you can quickly jump up and hide near the ceiling, using only Sam's incredibly strong legs as anchors. From this position, Sam can either shoot the enemy with his silenced pistol or simply drop on the unsuspecting guard's head as he walks below. Sam can also sneak up behind an enemy and grab him; when you can either force the villain to talk, use them as a human shield or simply knock them out. Plus, the only way you'll get through retinal-scanner locked doors is by grabbing the appropriately high-ranked soldier and forcing his face against the scanner. Plus, unlike most normal video games, dead or unconscious enemies don't disappear. If a soldier discovers his buddy lying face down on the floor, he'll run and sound the alarm. Therefore, Sam must pick up the body and hide it in a dark corner.\n\nSam also has a number of gadgets for all stealthy situations. His multi-purpose machine gun (which also doubles as a sniper rifle) can fire many different types of rounds: from knockout projectiles to gas grenades, to a clever device called a distraction camera. Once fired, the tiny camera emits a whistle. When the enemy comes to investigate, the device releases a plume of knockout gas. T\n\nhe Nintendo GameCube version of Splinter Cell has a few extra exclusive tricks up its sleeves too. By connecting a Game Boy Advance (using the Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance cable), your GBA becomes a second screen where you can scan for enemies, activate computers and control gun turrets. By linking the two systems, you'll also add a new weapon to Sam's arsenal - the Sticky Bomb. Fired at a wall or enemy, this device picks up information on the area around it, and can be remotely detonated to knock out the enemy with a burst of low-frequency sound. Also, if you have a copy of Splinter Cell for Game Boy Advance, link your GBA to the Nintendo GameCube version of the game and you'll unlock five new missions to play on your handheld.\n\nSplinter Cell's concentration on stealth means that this isn't your average action game. Once you realise that you can't simply go in with guns blazing, then the enjoyment comes from simply getting to the end of the level alive. And, refreshingly, there's usually more than one way to complete your objectives, making for plenty of replay value. So if you relish the chance of working your brain as well as your trigger fingers, then Splinter Cell should be right up your alley. Preferably a dimly-lit one, with good exits...\n\nWhat you need to know\n\nThis content is sold by Nintendo of Europe SE.
