Splinter Cell, the video game franchise created by thriller writer Tom Clancy, is extending its reach across media with Dynamite Entertainment announcing a comic book series, Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell Echoes, to launch this summer.

The series will be written by Nathan Edmondson, currently writing Marvel’s Black Widow and The Punisher. Art will be contributed by Marc Laming, most recently seen reviving the Kings Feature characters in Kings Watch.

Splinter Cell Echoes will bridge the gap between the two most recent installments of Ubisoft’s game series: 2010’s Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell: Convinction and Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell: Blacklist.

“I’m telling a full and original story that stands on its own as an action-espionage tale that we’re both proud of, bringing a narrative element to the thrill of the game in a way that only a comic can do,” Edmondson said of the project in a statement, with Laming saying that the series is “a rattling good spy-fi yarn” that “gives good fan service while equally accessible to folk who don’t know the Splinter Cell world.”

The Splinter Cell franchise launched in 2002 with the first game, which launched six sequels to date with a seventh currently being created. Additionally, the series has spawned seven spin-off novels and an in-development movie adaptation, which has director Doug Liman in negotiations to direct.

Splinter Cell Echoes was originally available as part of a limited collector’s edition of Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell: Blacklist. Dynamite’s new four-issue series, which will be available digitally and from comic book stores starting in July, will feature that material as well as all-new bonus content.
