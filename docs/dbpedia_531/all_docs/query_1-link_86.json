MANGUM was born on Jan 4 1746/1747 in Abbeville County, South Carolina.\n\nm Mary Murdock b 1752 William married Mary MURDOCK. Mary was born about 1752.\n\n130. Henry MANGUM (Frances Silvester BENNETT , Richard , Richard , Thomas , John , Thomas \"of Clapcot\" , John , Thomas , Thomas ) was born about 1720 in Isle of Wight County, Virginia. He died about 1795 in Isle of Wight County, Virginia.\n\nSource: Will of Henry Mangum, Isle of Wight Co, VA, mentioned his sons and\n\ndaughters and was witnessed by William Persons, Joseph Persons, Josiah Mangam.\n\nWas this Josiah a brother, father?\n\nThe first record of a Menry Mangum in the New World is found in the records of\n\nthe Mill Swamp Baptist Church, Isle of Wight Co, VA. The records contain the\n\nbirth dat es of several children of Henry. They were Cathron, 1746, Briton,\n\nHenry 1749, Richard, Ann, Samuel, John, Honour, Hearty, Martha, and Goodrich1768. No wife of Henry is mentioned but it wouild be interesting to know the\n\nrelationship between Henry and the two females mentioned in tjhe record, i.e.\n\nConstantine Mangum and Agnes Mangum. Neither a land deed nor his will mention\n\nhis wife. There is no direct evidence as to who his parents were; however, it\n\nis at least possible that he was a grandson or a son of John Frances Mangum who\n\nwere in Isle of Wsight Co by 1704.\n\nHenry bought land in 1753 and 1760 keeping it until he sold it to his son,\n\nRichard Mangum in 1782. He had some relationship, it would appear, with the\n\nPerson family. A good guess is that Henry was connected to this family by\n\nmarriage.\n\nMangum, Henry Senior\n\nIsle of Wight Co 1795 w.\n\nWill Book, Vol 10, 1785-1796, Reel 26\n\np. 323, Will pro 7 Apr 1795\n\np. 379-380.

He died after 1850 in Blount County, Tennessee.\n\nSource: Combined editions of the Mangum Family Bulletin, p 41, item 34.\n\nAt the time of the 1850 Census of Blount County, TN, Goodrich Mangum, age 82,\n\nborn VA, along with one Mary Mangum, age 82, born NC, were identified as\n\npaupers in the census along with several other individuals. 260 M vi Samuel MANGUM was born before 1790 in Isle of Wight County, Virginia. 261 F vii Ann MANGUM was born before 1790 in Isle of Wight County, Virginia.

Martha married CORRELLE.\n\n131. Samuel MANGUM (Frances Silvester BENNETT , Richard , Richard , Thomas , John , Thomas \"of Clapcot\" , John , Thomas , Thomas ) was born about 1722 in Albermarle Parrish, Surry County, Virginia. He died after 1761.\n\nJames Lynn Parham believes that his Pleasant Mangum, born in 1777 in NC, m Ann\n\nLoyd in 1805 in Granville Co, NC, may have been a son of Samuel Mangum, son of\n\nWilliam Mangum, Sr. Lynn has found no documentation of the father of his\n\nPleasant. In my Mangum family history, I have listed Pleasant in the Chapter\n\nentitled \"Mangum Bits and Pieces\" as we are unsure of his parents.\n\nFor recording keep purposes, I am placing Samuel in this family since there was\n\nsome relationship among these individuals.\n\n!Samuel Mangum was a god parent along with William and Mary Mangum of a son of\n\nJames and Mary Mangum of the Albamarle Parish in 1743/44. He migrated to NC\n\nwith the rest of the Mangums and witnessed a deed there as early as 1751. He\n\nobtained a land grant in 1756 which was originally surveyed for William in\n\n1752. Samuel witnessed several deeds in Granville Co and was in the 1754\n\nGranville Militia. He was living with Jno. TGompson in 1755 and therefore not\n\nin the household of William and family. Samuel was a carpenter and planter.\n\nIn 1755 he took a nine year old orphan to teach him the carpentry trade. In\n\n1757 he was the purchaser of the estate of James. He apparently died between\n\nthis date and 1758 when an account of his estate was made nearly 20 years later\n\nand corrected. This account shows that Samuel left a widow and six children.\n\nThe names of his children are not given; however, we find a Howell Mangum\n\nselling some of Samuel's land in 1773 and 1774 in Bute Co, NC.\n\nThis does not appear to be the Samuel Mangham of the Vaughn Ballard's \"Solomon\n\nMangham.\" Perhaps he was a nephew?\n\nSamuel married (MANGUM). (MANGUM) died after 1758.\n\nThey had the following children:\n\n266 M i Howell MANGUM was born before 1758. He died after 1774 in Bute County, North Carolina.\n\n\"Descendants of Wiley Thomas Mangum & James Wilson Mangum\" notes that Howell\n\nMangum may have been one of Samuel's six children, identifieed in the\n\nadministration of his estate in 1758. Howell Mangum sold some of the land\n\nbelonging to Samuel Mangum in 1773 and 1774 in Bute Co, NC. He may have been a\n\nson of Samuel.\n\n132. Ann BENNETT (William , Richard , Richard , Thomas , John , Thomas \"of Clapcot\" , John , Thomas , Thomas ) died after 1765.\n\nAnn married Robert RUFFIN.\n\nThey had the following children:\n\n+ 267 M i William RUFFIN was born in 1735 and died in 1781. + 268 F ii Anne RUFFIN. + 269 F iii Olivia RUFFIN died on Apr 2 1803. 270 F iv Faith RUFFIN was born on Dec 9 1733.
