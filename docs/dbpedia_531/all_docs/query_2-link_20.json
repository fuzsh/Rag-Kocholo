        "text": "Center.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nWhile the bulk of these pages primarily focus on the years between 1970 and 1990, it would be incredibly disrespectful to ignore those who came before that period. After all, how can one write about stand-up comedy in Chicago without mentioning Jack Benny or Bob Newhart? Equal attention must be paid to comedians like George Carlin and Dick Gregory, whose tenure in Chicago considerably altered their careers. Overall, the who’s who and what’s what of Chicago stand-up comedy is such that the show biz cliche without further introduction must be disregarded as we provide a worthy primer on the subject.\n\nIn the early 20th century, there were primarily two sources of live comedy in Chicago. The first were plays staged at venues such as McVickers Theater and Hooley’s Parlor Home of Comedy. Eddie Foy Sr., one of the first superstars of American comedy, was so respected that prior to an engagement in Chicago, those putting on his show honored his request to forgo a hotel and be put up in a furnished Lake Shore Drive home. Throughout the 1910s, Foy toured with his children as Eddie Foy Sr. and the Seven Little Foys, a family vaudeville act. Foy is also remembered for his onstage attempts to calm Chicagoans during the deadly Iroquois Theater fire in 1903.\n\nChicagoans also got their live comedy via vaudeville shows, which contain the deepest roots of stand-up comedy. Taking the stage to the playing of Fine and Dandy, comedy teams and monologists were audience favorites, although not all comedians began their careers that way. Waukegan native Jack Benny debuted as a serious violinist and was talented enough for Minnie Marx to suggest that he join the Marx Brothers as one of their touring musicians when Benny was still a teenager. It was not until the enlisted Benny was stationed at Naval Station Great Lakes during World War I that his comedic gift emerged.\n\nLike Benny, Bob Hope and Edgar Bergen also debuted in vaudeville before adapting to new mediums. Raised in Cleveland, Hope entered vaudeville as half of a comedy song-and-dance duo before going solo and being selected to emcee vaudeville shows at Chicago’s Stratford Theater. The Stratford engagement was originally for two weeks, but as Hope became a can’t-miss funny man, he was retained for an additional six months.\n\nBergen doubled down on his career in the 1920s, commissioning Chicago carpenter Theodore Mack to create wisecracking dummy Charlie McCarthy, whose head alone cost the 16-year-old Bergen $35. His first performance was at the Waveland Avenue Congregational Church in Chicago, and soon after that, Bergen and McCarthy began to appear in vaudeville shows and short films. A recommendation from Noël Coward helped Bergen secure a guest appearance on Rudy Vallee’s radio show, which led to a starring role on The Chase and Sanborn Hour. There, Bergen introduced a second dummy, Mortimer Snerd. Bergen was a fixture on the radio from 1937 until 1956.\n\nThe vaudevillian comedy team of Carroll and Isabelle Allen, parents of late-night television pioneer Steve Allen, are remembered less often. Sadly, Carroll died when Steve was 18 months old, after which Isabelle continued to perform under the name Belle Montrose and earned Milton Berle’s praise as the funniest woman in vaudeville. Young Steve applied what he had gathered from watching his mother’s shows to become the class clown at several Chicago schools, including Hyde Park High School and St. Joseph Military Academy, a boarding school in nearby La Grange Park. A health issue prompted Allen’s move to Arizona, where he entered radio and created a character named Claude Horribly that, years later, Allen said was more or less an imitation of Bergen’s Mortimer Snerd.\n\nIn addition to performing at vaudeville theaters, comedians also got stage time at speakeasies, including an Al Capone joint where a lit cigarette flung in Chicago native Morey Amsterdam’s direction convinced him that Hollywood would be safer. The move paid off for Amsterdam, who starred on The Morey Amsterdam Show in the late 1940s before landing the role of Buddy Sorrell on The Dick Van Dyke Show.\n\nUnlike Amsterdam, comedian Joe E. Lewis did not exit Chicago unscathed, and his 1927 engagement at the Green Mill later inspired the film The Joker is Wild, starring Frank Sinatra. Perhaps Milton Berle fared best. Berle confessed that once, between shows at the Oriental Theatre, the mob sped him to Cicero, where he performed for Capone and others at the Cotton Club.\n\nIn the 1950s, Chicago saw the emergence of four local talents who, despite their contributions, are often overlooked in the story of the area’s comedy history.\n\nJoe Conti’s show business career began in 1936 when, at the age of 12, he tap-danced his way to first place in the Major Bowes’ Original Amateur Hour talent contest. The victory scored Conti a talent contract, and the Detroit native soon began appearing in a string of Bowery Boys and Dead End Kids movies. Seeking a steadier living and hoping to remain in his adopted Chicago, Conti switched to comedy and found a home at Mangam’s Chateau in suburban Lyons. From the 1950s to the 1970s, Conti performed at Mangam’s with dancers, jugglers, acrobats, chorus lines, and emcees who sang. His engagement—perhaps the longest in Chicago (Joey Bishop is said to have performed for nearly a year at Chicago’s Vine Gardens in the late 1940s)—reflected an era when nightclubs hired performers for several weeks, not just for the week or weekend. After Mangam’s closed, Conti continued doing stand-up and won over a new generation of admirers. Conti, who died in 1997, was one of the few comedians who successfully transitioned from nightclubs to comedy clubs.\n\nFar less cordial was insult comic Jack E. Fat Jack Leonard, whose sharp tongue warned others not to challenge him. Nightclub shows featuring Leonard, aka the Sultan of Insult and the Mouth that Roared, were hot tickets thanks to his appearances with Jack Paar on The Tonight Show. The rotund, bald comic, who died in 1973 at age 63, arguably influenced Don Rickles.\n\nThe third forgotten comic is Fred Sheldon Greenfield, also known as Shecky Greene. Greene’s comedy career began when he took a summer job at a Milwaukee resort and formed a comedy team with Sammy Shore, the club’s social director. Their partnership did not last long, and Shore moved to Los Angeles, where, in 1972, he and his wife, Mitzi, opened a comedy club (which Mitzi later acquired"
