        "text": "Views of Inmates: On 15 January 1592/3 the Vestry ordered that two churchwardens and one vestryman should \"every fortnight search and view what newcomers and inmates they can find in the parish any way chargeable to the same\", and that such inmates were to be removed. On 17 May 1594 the order was repeated in modified form. All the searches recorded in these documents occurred in 1593-4-5, and the multiple searches (\"every fortnight\") resulted in many names being repeated, often several times and in different contexts, through all four documents. Some entries contradict other entries; all should be read carefully.\n\nThere is also a later survey, from 1635."
