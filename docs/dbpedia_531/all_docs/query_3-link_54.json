        "text": "The district said last year that all Grade 8 students would take Algebra 1 starting in 2025, but recently said it could not fulfill that promise.\n\nTo prepare for the change, seventh-graders will be able to learn some advanced math this school year.\n\nThe board has been pushing for decades, committee members noted, for middle schoolers to learn algebra so that they are better prepared to take higher level math, such as calculus, in high school.\n\n“We need to get here,” said member Richard Harding, one of the motion’s sponsors. “This is a deep, deep commitment that we had years ago, and we’ve never acted upon.”\n\nWhile unanimous, the committee’s vote was made with one member absent and one voting present. It followed extensive discussion of the district’s capacity to fulfill it. District staff said there were concerns among math staff around both staff capacity to teach the class and students’ readiness to take it, but said they understood the district had committed to parents last year.\n\n“I do realize that there is a subset of students whose families chose to enter sixth grade with us based on a promise that we made,” said district math director Siobahn Mulligan. “We want to figure out how to best serve those students.”\n\nDistrict staff also emphasized the need for continued discussion and data analysis in case they need to adjust the math policy going forward.\n\nThe committee heard two public comments in favor of the motion. Guy Rosenzweig, a parent of a rising seventh-grader, argued it was important that public middle schools offer the class, not just private schools and tutors.\n\n“Many families ... go to public schools because they cannot afford private school,” Rosenzweig said. “By not strengthening algebra by the middle school level, what CPS is doing is widening the gap.”\n\nAndrew Groh, a software engineer and parent of a rising seventh-grader, agreed, saying taking Algebra 1 early is vital to entering careers like his.\n\n“I know that this is a challenging time,” Groh said. “No plan is perfect, but ... it’s better to have better to try to do this than to wait for the perfect plan.”\n\nThe class has been a subject of debate in Cambridge for years, and was offered to some eighth-graders until the advanced middle school math track was phased out before the pandemic. District leaders were alarmed by stark disparities in who was taking advanced math: Students in those classes were overwhelmingly white and Asian, while the grade level math classes mostly comprised Black and Latino students.\n\nBut the pandemic prevented the district from implementing the other half of that policy: adding algebra into the new universal Grade 8 curriculum. So in 2023, facing pressure from parents who said the change made it hard for their children to reach advanced math classes like calculus in high school, the administration presented a timeline to offer universal eighth-grade Algebra 1 by the 2025-26 school year, averting School Committee action.\n\nBut in June, district leadership announced that plan was not feasible, because rising seventh-graders have too much math left to learn.\n\n“The sixth-grade cohort that occurred this year would’ve missed lessons in seventh grade and in eighth grade by the time they got to Algebra 1,” Mulligan told the School Committee’s curriculum subcommittee on June 11. “With this plan, Algebra 1 would not fully be in eighth grade until 2026-27.”\n\nThe news set up another confrontation with the School Committee, with two members presenting a late motion to require algebra 1 in 2025-26 at the subsequent full committee meeting, June 18.\n\nThe committee didn’t pass the motion at the time — other members said they didn’t want to rush it — but by Tuesday night, the committee was ready to stop debating it.\n\nMayor Denise Simmons, who serves as the School Committee chair, noted at the June 11 meeting that she had passed a motion decades prior that intended to ensure access to the class.\n\n“I feel like I’m having déjà vu,” Simmons said. “I’m stunned.”"
