        "text": "Readers of \"Araby\" have long been fascinated by Mangan's sister, the heroine of Joyce's short story. One intriguing question about her is what might have happened to this young woman later in life in Joyce's imagination. Two answers to that question may be considered, based on the lives of a historical figure and a young girl Joyce knew, both of whom served as models for his fictional character. When last seen in the middle of \"Araby,\" Mangan's sister is about to leave for a week's retreat at her convent school. This detail might suggest to the casual reader that the life of a nun in the Catholic Church awaits her. However, neither of the girls upon whom Joyce based the character pursued that vocation.\n\nWe know that one of Joyce's models for his fictional character was the sister of Irish poet James Clarence Mangan (1803–49). Joyce was familiar with Mangan's autobiographical fragment, and this journalistic memoir reveals that the unfortunate sister—whose first name is unknown, like the subject of Joyce's story—\"died in girlhood\" after leaving home to escape an abusive father. Mangan reports that boiling water spilled on his sister, apparently in a serious cooking accident. She suffered third-degree burns that became infected, so she undoubtedly endured a slow and very painful death.1 However, Joyce's primary model for Mangan's sister was Mary Sheehy (1884–1967), a neighborhood girl two years his junior and a member of a prominent nationalist family. Joyce is said to have had a crush on her throughout his teens and beyond. As Harry Stone first noted, \" 'Araby' preserves a central episode in Joyce's life [with] . . . the girl [he] regarded as his original temptress [. . . ] Mary Sheehy.\"2\n\nIn 1894, when the \"Araby in Dublin\" fair came to town, the Sheehy family was residing at 2 Belvedere Place, about two blocks from the Joyce family home at 14 Fitzgibbon Street, just off the North Circular Road (JJ 51; LII lv). Joyceans have attempted without success to find a family with a [End Page 249] young girl living across the street from the later Joyce family home at 17 North Richmond Street in order to match the account in \"Araby\" of the boy lying on the floor of his front parlor, watching from beneath a blind for Mangan's sister to emerge from her house. However, it is likely that Joyce would have seen Mary from a comparably voyeuristic perspective as she passed his Fitzgibbon Street house on her way to the North Circular Road. As Richard Ellmann has noted, Mary was the \"prettiest\" of the four Sheehy daughters and \"[f]or Mary, Joyce conceived a small, rich passion which, unsuspected by her, lasted for years. She queened his imagination . . . \" (JJ 51). Like the boy of \"Araby,\" Joyce never told anyone of his feelings for Mary Sheehy, but Ellmann characterizes her as Joyce's \"secret adolescent love\" (JJ 278).\n\nJoyce was friendly with Mary's brothers, Richard and Eugene. He would often play games, sing, and dance at their home, staying overnight several times. Richard and/or Eugene likely served as a model for Mangan in \"Araby.\" Ellmann has also suggested that Joyce might have sung J. C. Mangan's \"Veil not thy mirror, sweet Amine\" (a poem he had set to music) on one of his visits to the Sheehy home. A mildly risqué incident from this period recalls Joyce dancing with Mary and, as she was having difficulty following his limp lead, he suggested that she \"Take hold of my thumb.\" Mary, having misheard him as saying \"tongue,\" responded with shock. Joyce got a great laugh out of this and then, after correcting her, continued with his loosely led dance (JJ 52). Ten years later, Joyce was still socializing with the Sheehys, and he even wrote some light romantic poems of his own for Mary, or was at least inspired to do so by his conversations with her. Ellmann argues that Joyce's abiding interest in Mary was \"unexpressed and unrequited\" (JJ 156). Ultimately, his feelings for her cooled about..."
