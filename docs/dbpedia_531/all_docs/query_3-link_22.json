        "text": "English actor (born 1968)\n\nStephen James Mangan (born 16 May 1968)[1] is an English actor, comedian, presenter and writer. He has played Guy Secretan in Green Wing, Dan Moody in I'm Alan Partridge, Seán Lincoln in Episodes,[2] Bigwig in Watership Down, Postman Pat in Postman Pat: The Movie, Richard Pitt in Hang Ups, Andrew in Bliss (2018), and Nathan Stern in The Split (2018–2022).\n\nAs a stage actor, he was Tony-nominated for his portrayal of Norman in The Norman Conquests on Broadway. He starred as Bertie Wooster in Jeeves and Wooster in Perfect Nonsense at the Duke of York's Theatre in the West End, which won the 2014 Olivier Award for Best New Comedy.[3] He co-presented the 2020 edition of Children In Need for the BBC.\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nMangan was born in Ponders End, in Enfield, north London, to Irish parents.[4] He has two sisters, Anita and Lisa.[5]\n\nMangan was educated at two private schools, Lochinver House School for boys in Potters Bar, and Haileybury and Imperial Service College (now co-educational), a boarding school in the village of Hertford Heath, Hertfordshire. He was in a school prog rock band called Aragon, which recorded an album called The Wizard's Dream.[6]\n\nAfter earning a Bachelor of Arts in law at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, Mangan took a year out to care for his mother, Mary, who died of colon cancer at age 45. Weeks after her death, he auditioned for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and went on to study there for three years.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nTheatre\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter graduating from RADA in 1994, Mangan did not pursue lead roles on screen, preferring to take what he saw as the less limited opportunities on the stage. Between 1994 and 2000, he performed in plays throughout the UK and the West End[7] before joining the theatre company Cheek by Jowl for an international tour of Much Ado About Nothing, earning him a nomination for a National Theatre Ian Charleson Award. He worked again for director Declan Donnellan at the Royal Shakespeare Company in School for Scandal, and at the Savoy Theatre in Hay Fever.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2008, he played the title role in The Norman Conquests, directed by Matthew Warchus, at The Old Vic and then at the Circle in the Square on Broadway.[8] The production was a huge critical success earning several Tony Award nominations, including one for Mangan himself[9] and won the Tony Award for Best Revival.\n\nIn 2012, he appeared at the Royal Court in a Joe Penhall play, Birthday, directed by Roger Michell,[10] playing a pregnant man.\n\nMangan starred as Bertie Wooster in Jeeves and Wooster in Perfect Nonsense at the Duke of York's Theatre[11] alongside Matthew Macfadyen as Jeeves from October 2013 until they were replaced by Mark Heap and Robert Webb in April 2014.[12] The production won the 2014 Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Comedy.[3]\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nMangan's breakthrough television performance was as Adrian Mole in the six-part BBC TV show series Adrian Mole: The Cappuccino Years in 2001.[13] That same year he appeared in Sword of Honour on Channel 4, alongside Daniel Craig.\n\nIn 2002, he appeared as Dan Moody in the I'm Alan Partridge episode \"Bravealan\". A scene where Alan repeatedly shouts \"Dan!\" at Dan from a distance in a car park, while Dan seems not to notice him, was named the second best moment from the series by Metro,[14] and in 2014 Mangan said that he has \"Dan!\" shouted at him by passers-by almost every day.[15]\n\nMangan played Guy Secretan in the BAFTA-winning British sitcom Green Wing. In Channel 4's The World's Greatest Comedy Characters, Guy was voted 34th. He starred as Keith in Never Better, a British television sitcom on BBC Two.

The series was created by Howard Overman and co-starred Darren Boyd as his sidekick Richard MacDuff. Recurring actors included Helen Baxendale as MacDuff's girlfriend Susan Harmison, Jason Watkins as Dirk's nemesis DI Gilks and Lisa Jackson as Dirk's receptionist Janice Pearce. Unlike most detective series Dirk Gently featured broadly comic touches and even some science fiction themes such as time travel and artificial intelligence. He has said that he was \"bitterly upset\" at the BBC's axing of the series after four episodes due to a freeze on the licence fee.[18] The four episodes of Dirk Gently were later released on the BritBox streaming service.\n\nHe played the title role in \"The Hunt for Tony Blair\", a one-off episode of The Comic Strip Presents..., a British television comedy, which was first shown on Channel 4 on 14 October 2011.
