This book is not intended to be and makes no pretext of being a means of glorifying any individual organization or set. It is simply a grouping of facts and figures, clev- erly blended with a story that has unfolded through the years -- A story that will shed light on the important hap- penings in the life and times of people from the earliest pioneers and adventurers to the contemporaries of our time. Because of the diligent care taken in gathering the information necessary to complete this book, it is almost certain to be one hundred percent accurate. There is no way one can give an iron clad guarantee, however, that there isn't one mis-statement of fact. If, by chance, there is an error in this manuscript, it is solely because of the limitations of the human memory when there were no records or other reference material available. One of the most gratifying rewards given to the young authors of this book was the knowledge that there were so many senior citizens unselfish enough to sit down and devote many hours reminiscing and generally discus- sing the \"Good Ole Days\". These interviews proved to be the source of many of the invaluable stories offered in this text. For many who read this book there will be twinges of nostalgia when poring over a passage about Cream City or the Talley-Ho which carried groups of merry-makers to Clam Bakes. Possibly, for some, it may bring a feel- ing of melancholy for days lived to their fullest but never to be seen again. For others, such as myself, it will be a story that unfolds with such interest that, once started, there will be no way to set the book down until the final chapter has been read. Whatever this book means to you, it will be time well spent reading what is sure to be a treasured work in the years to come. So now, please sit back and clear your mind of present day cares and prepare to embark on an adventure into the past that will not soon be forgotten. James A. Hartman FORWARD The home you live in today, the ordinary items that you use in everyday living and you yourself shall be con- sidered important in the history of Lyons at some future date. Time is relative. Seventy-five or a hundred years from now, the home you live in - if it still remains - will be known as an early homestead -- Your everyday items will be antiquest and you, at this future date, will be known as one of the early pioneers of the Village of Lyons. Historians are commonly pictured as older men or women who have lived their biblical three score and ten years and are endeavoring to set their interpretation of the events of their lifetime on paper before they pass on. In this book, however, you will read historical facts that are not colored by the imagination of the authors or dulled by the passing of time - for the two authors are not too long out of their \"teens\". Rose Marie Benedetti and Virginia C. Bulat, the authors, believe - as many other residents of Lyons - that our village was an important part of early American history and should receive the recognition to which it is entitled. They commenced the original manuscript while freshmen in high school -- They have painstakenly revised and rewritten portions as new facts were uncovered; and so you are about to read the first history book written solely about your village. Enjoy this book to its fullest, remembering even as you read that you are a part and portion of the Village of Lyons - Gateway to the West. Ellsworth J. Hartwig CHAP T ER I LYONS AND ITS FAMOUS PORTAGE It is our honest opinion that if it hadn!t been for Lyons, the great center of commerce known as Chicago would have been built at some other more favorable loca- tion. This may sound a little sensational but it is the simple truth. We will prove our statement in this chapter, and try to draw as clear a picture as possible of the early days of Lyons and its surrounding area. Our story begins over three hundred years ago when this entire area was populated with many Indians. The Indian inhabitants of the Northwest Territory included such tribes as the Chippewa, Fox, Sac, Illinois, Kickapoo, Miami, Ottawa, Pottawatomi and Winnebago. The principal Indians in the neighborhood of Lyons were the Pottawatomi, Miami and an occasional foray by the war-like Iroquois from New York. When the first pioneers settled west of Fort Dearborn, they found a Pot- tawatomi Village in Lyons. The Great Plains Indians lived in tepees made of hide, or in dome-shaped huts covered with grass, hides or earth. Their clothing was made of deerskin, furs, woven hair, etc. The Indians recognized Lyons and the nearby region as an excellent location for their homes. The Des Plaines River gave them a convenient supply of water, transporta- tion and fish of many species. The forests provided timber for fuel and huts. There was an abundant quantity of fur- bearing animals which included muskrat - raccoon - opos- sum - squirrel - deer - wolves - rabbit - buffalo - elk - beaver - and black bear. As for game birds, there were flocks of wild duck, quail, pheasant, wild geese, swans, sandhill crains, ruffed grouse and prairie chicken. Their corn and other crops thrived in the fertile land. 11 Although the Indian was a hunter and fisherman, the necessity of tending fields forced him to live a set- tled life in one locality, varying only by fall or winter hunts. Indians traveled in a canoe made of bark or hal- lowed out of a log. The Indian inhabitants in this \"neck of the woods\" left many trails along the river and streams. The early settlers had no difficulty identifying these trails for they bore common characteristics - all were narrow, deep and serpentine in their course. The Cook County Forest Preserve now owns and maintains much of the property so that many of the early Indian trails are again clearly visible. Hundreds of arrow heads and many stone imple- ments have been found throughout Lyons. There is also a plot of land located about two hundred feet along the north bank of the Des Plaines - where Salt Creek enters the river in Riverside - where bones of many Indians lie. This legendary spot is known today as Indian Gardens. Henry Metz, a resident of Lyons, owned a sand pit in that area during the early 1900's. While excavating the property, he discovered an Indian skeleton. For many centuries, the Northwest Indians trav- eled a short portage to Lake Michigan and the Great Lakes Region. To explain this route clearly, we will start at its beginning - the Mississippi River. This body of water connects with the Illinois River at Grafton, Illinois. The Des Plaines is a major tributary of the Illinois River. At Lyons, there was a shallow creek (Portage Creek) two miles long, which connected the Des Plaines with a slough (Mud Lake). By traveling over Mud Lake to its eastern end, a short land portage of one and one-half miles long led to the West Fork of the South Branch of the Chicago River. (This land port- age was located at about what is now Kedzie Avenue. ) The Chicago River then led into Lake Michigan. Early Frenchmen referred to the route as \"Le Portage\". It was commonly known as the Chicago Portage. 12 The Chicago Portage was to be recognized as the shortest and most direct connection between the St. Law- rence River in Canada and the Mississippi River and Gulf of Mexico. Indians in the Great Lakes area had informed the French of a \"Great River\" in the west. Because of this, Comte de Frontenac, the Governor of New France, sent Louis Joliet to discover and explore the river. Father Jacquest Marquette was elected to accompany Joliet1 s party. The \"Great River\" was, of course, the Mississippi. On May 17, 1672, Father Marquette, Louis Joliet and five other voyageurs began their long journey at St. Ignace, Mackinaw Strait. The trek was made in two birch bark canoes with just a string of dried beef and a bag of cornmeal for food. Father Marquette's purpose was to reveal the Catholic religion to the Indians. To make fri- ends with the Redman, the kindly priest carried beads and crosses, which were used as gifts. Louis Joliet's job was to establish trade for the French. The French believed that once trade was established, they would be able to rule the country. The route taken from Canada by the small party was Lake Michigan to Green Bay, and the Fox-Wisconsin Rivers to the Mississippi. They explored the Mississippi as far south as the mouth of the Arkansas River. At this point they decided to start back toward Quebec. The Indians told them of a shorter route back to Lake Michigan - via \"Le Portage\". Therefore, Father Marquette, Louis Joliet, and their party were in Lyons in 1673. They reported French- men were found living in Illinois. Because of this, many people believe these Frenchmen named our town in memory of their home country - Lyon, France. Father Marquette entered the first reports of white men living in this area. Thus the history of Chicago began as Farther Mar- 14 quette and Louis Joliet entered Portage Creek at Lyons and from there started for Lake Michigan. Knight and Zeuch referred to it in their book The Location Of The Chicago Portage Route Of The Seventeenth Century as: \"Portage Creek, the 'birthplace of Chicago', the place where Joliet and Father Marquette turned from the Des Plaines into Mud Lake.\" The famous expedition was very much impressed with this route. Joliet proceeded to Quebec and reported to Governor Frontenac that it would only be necessary to cut a canal one and one-half miles long (between Mud Lake and the Chicago River) to enable travelers to go by canoe from Lake Erie to the Culf of Mexico. This idea was to become a reality over ZOO years later with the Illinois - Michigan Canal. Father Marquette had promised to stay with the Indians on the Illinois River so, in the fall of 1674, after a short stay at Green Bay, he traveled south on Lake Michigan to the east end of Mud Lake, arriving in Decem- ber. He remained on the South Branch of the Chicago River from December 1674 to March 30, 1675. This area was afterwards called \"Hardscrabble\" and is now about Archer and Racine Avenues in Chicago. Although the good missionary was rich in faith and love, he was very poor in health and, for that reason, was unable to travel further in the Illinois territory. Since he could not travel great distances, he made his way around Lake Michigan, stopping at every possible Indian Village. Father Marquette died near Ludington, Michigan, west of Mackinac Island. French fur traders from the Quebec area, influenced by Joliet's reports, were among the first traders to deal with the Indians then camped in Lyons. They arrived in approximately 1675. Furs could often be traded for a string 15 of beads, a hatchet, or a knife. These furs then traveled over the Chicago Portage on their way to Paris, or other points in Europe. After talking to Joliet, Robert Cavalier de LaSalle, a courageous and adventurous Frenchman, became very interested in exploring the Mississippi. He planned to build up the fur trade, and establish a series of forts along the routes to the Mississippi. If this could be done, LaSalle felt that France would have control of almost all of North America. After securing permission from the King of France, he made three trips to this area between 1679 and 1682. It is important to note at this time that there were three portages into or out of Lake Michigan. Green Bay Portage - Chicago Portage - and St. Joseph-Kankakee River Portage. The Chicago Portage was much shorter than the other two, being only nine miles long. It was only on LaSalle' s last trip that he used this shorter route to the Mississippi River. Realizing its importance, LaSalle instructed his ever faithful lieutenant, loyal friend, and devoted com- panion, Henry de Tonty, to build Fort St. Louis at Starved Rock. The French, with their Indian allies, now had complete control of the Chicago Portage and the fur trade in the Northwest. Henry de Tonty was known as The Man With The Iron Hand. His right hand had been blown off by a grenade during a battle at Libisso, Sicily. He wore an iron hook which the Indians feared as \"big medicine\" . LaSalle took possession of the vast region drained by the Mississippi. He named it Louisiana in honor of the King of France, Louis XIV. Despite many disastrous attacks, Tonty - as the representative of the French - and his army maintained 16 control of the Portage for many years. But in 1700 he was replaced as governor of Fort St. Louis, and was forced to vacate the Fort and the Chicago Portage. The British decided they wanted to get into the fur trade act and formed an alliance with the Iroquois who were long standing enemies of the Illinois Indians and the French. Gradually, the English - through their freindship with the Iroquois - began to gain control of the Northwest region. By 1760 they had established the Hudson's Bay Company, North West Fur Company, and Mackinac Fur Company. Competition was at its peak between the fur com- panies. They found it was very necessary to make friends with as many Indian nations as possible. And they did not hesitate to use the Indians against their competitors. The Indians were filled with liquor, and robbery and murder became a common business. There was great rivalry between the English and French in Europe. This rivalry spread to their colonists in the New World. The French settlements were near enough the English to cause disputes over boundaries and prevented explorations west - in addition to the difficulties over fur trade rights. By 1754, affairs were in such a state that the final struggle between the English and French seemed inevitable. One or the other had to control North America. Their disputes resulted in the French and Indian War. An important major served under the British in this war - George Washington. Although the French and their Indian allies put up a strong defense, the British finally won out and, after many years of warfare, the peace treaty was signed at Paris in 1763. France gave England the territory east of the Mississippi - except New Orleans which went to Spain - and Canada. George Rodgers Clark conquered the Northwest Ter- ritory from England during the Revolutionary War. He was aided by French settlers living in this area and their Indian allies. 17 The Chicago Portage was used quite often as a route to the battle grounds at the Mississippi during the American Revolution. A British military force is known to have stayed at Lyons during the Revolution. The close of the Revolutionary War, with the Treaty of Paris in 1783, legally gave the American Colonies ter- ritories that included the entire area as far west as the Mississippi and south to Louisiana. The \"Ordinance of Virginia\", passed on July 13, 1787, defined the Northwest Territory. This included areas north of the Ohio and Missouri Rivers, Indiana, Illinois, Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Dakota and South Dakota. It set up townships and boundary lines. The Ordinance also included a passage regarding the Chicago Portage. This passage read: \"The navigable waters leading into the Mississippi and the St. Lawrence, and the carrying places between the same, shall be common highways, and forever free, as well to the inhabitants of the United States, and those of any other state that may be admitted into the Confederacy, without any tax, impost, or duty therefor. \" TJhe English were revengeful as evidenced when Charles d'Iberville, a French Canadian in the English ser- vice, spent a night in Lyons in 1779. Accompanying him was a group of white men and Indians. They were on their way to an American settlement at Peoria, for the purpose of antagonizing the pioneers of the village. Although the Treaty of Paris gave the power of this region to the United States, it was now the Government's duty to obtain title to the land from the Indians, so that it might be opened for settling by the pioneers. The Indians that controlled the land were influenced by the English to 18 resist any efforts made in settling the region north of the Ohio, As a result, after many attacks with the Indians, General Meredith Anthony Wayne's Treaty of Greenville was signed on August 10, 1795 which took away the Indians' title to the land in Ohio. This treaty is important to the Chicago Portage because it freed: \"One piece of land six miles square at the mouth of the Chicago River emptying into the southwest end of Lake Michigan\", a like piece at the site of Peoria, a strip twelve miles square where the Illinois River empties into the Missis- sippi, and: \"free passages of the portages and rivers connecting these grants\"; thereby freeing the entire route from the Chicago Portage to the Mississippi. The French control in other parts of the country was ended in 1803 with the Louisiana Purchase. John Jacob Astor, an American, came into the fur trade picture with his American Fur Company, incorpo- rated in 1808. He got rid of competition by influencing Congress to pass an act in 1816 that prevented foreigners from trading furs in the United States - except as employ- ees. Since the discovery of the Portage, Chicago has al- ways been a strategic point for either trade or war. Re- alizing this, the United States Government erected the first Fort Dearborn on the Chicago River in 1804 - to protect the Chicago Portage. The other two portages were also guarded by forts. Because of its protection, the Portage literally overflowed with fur traders and travelers. This continued until the War of 1812 when the 19 first Fort Dearborn was burned and many soldiers and settlers massacred. For a period of four years, the area went back to the Indians. The English planned to regain control of the Portage during this time, but were too slow, for in 1816 the Government ordered Fort Dearborn rebuilt. The fur traders returned in great numbers. It is quite possible that many decided to spend a portion of their time in Lyons, since it was an ideal place of encampment. The area was filled with many fur -bearing animals due to its proximity to water. Traffic was now quite heavy over the Portage, due to the great amount of fur traders and the increasing popu- lation. Mud Lake needed much improvement. A treaty was made with the Indians on August 24, 1816, giving the United States the territory ten miles north and ten miles south of the mouth of the Chicago River. A grant was ob- tained on February 14, 18Z3 for the purpose of building a canal and road to keep up with the intense amount of traf- fic traveling over the Chicago Portage. Post and Paul, engineers, were hired to survey and draw up a map of the area of the intended canal. An Act was approved by the United States Congress on March Z, 18Z7 - and signed by President Andrew Jack- son on May 21, 1830 - which read: \"An Act granting a quantity of land to the State of Illinois for the purpose of aiding the opening of a canal to con- nect the waters of the Illinois River with those of Lake Michigan.\" This tract of land included Lyons. Following a number of delays, the Illinois -Michigan Canal was opened on April 16, 1848, and the land was free to be settled upon. Z0 Catherine Mitchell Pond today -- This is also probably very much as it was one hundred and fifty years ago. 21 A portion of Portage Creek can still be seen. It is located in the Forest Preserve west of Harlem Avenue and south of 47th Street. Prior to 1835, the Des Plaines River made a sharp turn east at Lyons. The River was rerouted when the Illinois -Michigan Canal was dug. Catherine Mitchell Pond is a part of the original river. A treaty was signed in September, 1833, that sent the Chippewa, Ottawa and Pottawatomi tribes from this area to west of the Mississippi. The meetings of the com- missioners and chiefs were held in a temporary building just north of the Des Plaines. According to the terms of the treaty, the last meeting was held at Lyons, and from Lyons the start was made for the West. It was two years before the treaty was put into effect. On September 21, 1835, the first party of Indians left Chicago with their Chiefs - Alexander Robinson, Billy Caldwell and LaFramboise (all half-breeds). They as- sembled at Lyons and the final distribution of goods was made. In all, about five thousand Indians were removed from this part of the country. The migration was con- ducted by Colonel J. F. Russell. This last great tragedy of white and red took place in Lyons, Illinois. For nearly two hundred years, Lyons saw a succes- sion of explorers, missionaries, and traders from Canada, and other parts of the world, pass down the Des Plaines. Some of the great names of early western annals passed this way. All of the great Indian chieftains knew the ter- ritory and scores of names, familiar to the history of the west and Chicago, are associated with Lyons and its port- age. Because of its location at the Portage, Lyons is the oldest village in this entire area. It is mentioned in early French writings as a meeting place. Not only was it the western end of the Chicago Portage, but the main overland trails from the southwest met at Lyons and continued east- ward. The main trail leading eastward was located at 22 approximately the same position as Ogden Avenue is situ- ated today. This trail led to Fort Dearborn. The information presented in this chapter includes the activities of the Indians, explorers and fur traders in the area. More railroads and other means of transporta- tion start and connect at Chicago today than any other place in the world. The city originated as a trading post, and its very name is taken from the Chicago Portage. Therefore, if it hadn't been for Lyons, with the Des Plaines running past Portage Creek at Lyons and thereby form- ing the Chicago Portage, the second largest city in the United States would have been built up at either the St. Joseph, Michigan or Green Bay, Wisconsin portages. 23 CHAPTER II PIONEERS Until the middle 1800' s, the colonists felt that land containing great trees was the only indication of fertility, and considered the prairies of the Great Plains area fit only for buffaloes and Indians. They were afraid to build their log homes in the area because of the strong winds that reportedly whipped across the vast prairies and de- stroyed homesteads. At one time, the Government con- sidered setting the Great Plains region aside as a perma- nent home for the Indians - to be known as the Permanent Indian Frontier. Eastern Indians would be encouraged to migrate and the Frontier would be bordered by a road of forts - beyond which no whites would be permitted to set- tle. The Permanent Indian Frontier was to run across Northern Wisconsin to the Mississippi, down to Northern Iowa. Their theories were disputed, however, as they be- gan to realize how ideal the Great Plains area was for farming. Courageous, strong-willed people began to arrive in the area in their covered wagons in the 1820's. These early pioneers settled, braved many hardships, and be- came the settlers of the area. Accommodations for travelers began springing up in the area. It seems reasonable that, because of its con- venient location, it was at Lyons that taverns and trading posts were built. Travelers and Indians alike met here and discussed the news of the day relating to politics, military, fur trading and latest Pow-Wows. David and Bernardus (Lawton) Laughton, brothers, owned a Trading Post at \"Hardscrabble\" and moved to the east bank of the Des Plaines - near the portage at Lyons - in 1827. It was called Laughton's Trading House and is the first known permanent building in this area, west of Chicago. Not only was this a Trading Post, but we feel it 25 is logical to say it was also a tavern. There are some opinions that the Laughton brothers owned a Trading Post at one location in Lyons, and a tavern further up the Des Plaines in Riverside. We feel that these buildings were originally one and the same. Taverns in that era differed from the modern day tavern in that they offered food and lodging for the weary traveler. The fur trade was still thriving in 1827 but a new group of people were also entering the picture - the pio- neer,, The road conditions were very hazardous and muddy, Upon reaching the Laughton' s - one of the few buildings in the wilderness - the traveler was quite exhausted from his journey over the trails and probably overjoyed to find a place where he could regain his strength. Fur traders also needed a place of encampment since their stays were only temporary and a permanent home was not necessary. It seems improbable the Laughton' s would provide a tavern at one location and a trading post at another. This could very well be the reason why the Laughton place was always referred to as a Trading House and not a Trading Posto David Laughton' s wife was a Pottawatomi squaw. A Pottawatomi meeting was held at Lyons in May of 183Z which she attended - along with Shabbona (Head Chief of the Pottawatomie s), Billy Caldwell and Alexander Robin- son (two half-breed chiefs). The meeting was held to de- termine what stand the tribe would take in the Black Hawk War -- They decided to remain neutral. Mrs. Laughton was supposed to have said, however, that some of her people were with Black Hawk and would begin to raid set- tlements as soon as he gave the word. As the area was cleared for farms and settlements, the fur trade began to vanish. Chicago was rapidly grow- ing in population and industry. The water routes used for centuries were left neglected and the overland trails hummed with traffic. Although the water route was a 26 more desirable means of transportation, the water of the Des Plaines and Mud Lake could not be used for travel throughout the entire year. And the pioneers carried too heavy a load to make water transportation feasible. Three important Indian trails led pioneers through Lyons on their journey west. The main trail was the \"Ogden Avenue Trail\" which ran to Brush Hill (Fullersburg). This trail was to be cal- led the Naperville Road because it was laid out in 1831 by Joseph and John Naper. The trail from Green Bay, Wisconsin ran south to the present Harlem Avenue, through Riverside and met the Ogden Avenue trail in Lyons at Barry Point Road. A trail had been formed through the years which ran parallel to the old Chicago Portage and, therefore, was known as \"Portage Road\". It was located on the north side of Mud Lake and Portage Creek. Portage Road ran in a fairly straight line from the west bank of the Des Plaines until it reached what is presently Joliet Road and 47th Street. It then curved south to the Illinois River. The Portage Road of yesterday can still be seen in the modern highway of today known as Route 66. Portage Road was later extended north at Joliet Road and 47th Street, and met the Ogden Avenue Trail at what is now Joliet and Ogden Avenues. Many of the workers employed in the construction of the Illinois -Michigan Canal in the 1830!s and 1840's made our village their permanent home. They built their dwell- ings along the Ogden Avenue trail. One of the major problems encountered by the pio- neers using the overland trails was transporting their covered wagons, animals and other belongings safely over the many water crossings. A shallow spot had to be lo- cated in the river bed that was firm enough to support their heavy load. 27 There were four fording spots in the Des Plaines River between Riverside and Summit. These fords were used for centuries by the Indians, fur traders, explorers, military troops and the American Pioneer. A ford was located in Riverside just below the nat- ural dam, and was known as \"Indian Ford\" or \"Riverside Ford\". Travelers on the Green Bay trail used this ford. Another low spot was situated one hundred and fifty feet south of the Ogden Avenue Bridge and was known as \"Stoney Ford\". This was convenient to the Ogden Avenue trail. \"Laughton's Ford\" was located three-eighths of a mile south of Stoney Ford. This ford was in a straight line - directly west - of Laughton's Trading House, and the closest to the Portage Road trail. The fourth ford was on the south side of the Chicago Portage in Summit and was called \"Summit Ford\". Laughton's Ford was chosen as the crossing point of Portage Road because it was the shortest route between the Portage Road west of the Des Plaines and Portage Road east of the Des Plaines River. If Stoney Ford was used, it would add three-quarters of a mile to the jour- ney - Indian Ford would increase the route three miles - and the Summit Ford was on the south side of the Portage. Portage Road's crossing at Laughton's Ford is just another reason for Laughton's Trading Post and Tavern being one and the same. There is some doubt, however, as to the true loca- tion of Laughton's tavern as it is referred to at times as being on property included in Riverside and also at the Laughton Ford. As mentioned before, Laughton's Trad- ing House was definitely situated east of the Laughton Ford. 28 SO- M ETON'S FO*D OS \"HI ** , ... , PLANES HE* MP ECU y ' Mr/ Laughton Trading House site marker Map, taken from abstract to title for Neher property, marks the Portage Road Trail 29 Whether or not the Laughton tavern was relocated in Riverside at a later date is hard to prove. There is evi- dence, however, to prove that the Laughton Trading House was situated at Lyons, one-half mile north of Portage Creek. Early maps of the Chicago Portage and Portage Road indicate the exact position of the \"old Laughton1 s Trading House\" and Laughton Ford, but a tavern known as Laughton' s Tavern has never been shown. The Forest Preserve has dedicated a stone marker in the Ottawa Trails (47th Street and Harlem Avenue) which clearly marks the true location of Laughton1 s building, and also states: \"Laughton1 s Ford on the Des Plaines lies directly West. \" This marker was erected because of a low stone foundation or cellar of a building discovered while the property was being excavated. The Laughton Brothers died within a few weeks of each other in 1834. Their establishment was then cared for by Mr, Scott and Stephen White -- The latter being one of the first permanent settlers in Lyons. We would like to close this chapter on the history of Lyons with a few quotes, found over the years, which des- cribes Lyons as it looked in the era when the fur trade in- dustry was vanishing and farming was slowly entering into the picture. An article, appearing in an 1834 Gazetter, described Lyons as follows: \"Lyons is a town site on the Des Plaines at Laughton1 s old trading house twelve miles west of Chicago. It has a saw mill, three houses and a tavern.\" The Chicago Historical Society keeps a record of every suburb of Chicago, which includes its early begin- ning and growth. The following information was taken from A. T. Andreas' History of Cook County, Illinois. The 30 copyright of this book, whose pages are yellow with age, is 1884. \"Lyons is a town nine miles wide and six miles long. In exploring the cob- webbed reminiscences of Lyons pre- cinct, the earliest are those that re- late to David and Barney Laughton, who settled at Bourbon Springs, near the present Chicago, Burlington and Quincy depot at Riverside, in the year 1828.\" A February 12, 1900 edition of the Chicago Tribune stated: \"Lyons is the oldest suburb west of Chicago, so old in fact that all its first settlers have long passed on to their reward, and with them has gone memory of the identity of the sponsor of the place, if it ever had one. Lyons it was in 1830 when the old Buckhorn Tavern was a noted hostelry on the stage road from Fort Dearborn to Joliet, and Lyons it has persisted in being through all the vicissitudes of time and expansion. David and Ber- nardus Laughton are known to have settled on the site in 1827 or 1828. Elijah Wentworth, who was Chicago's first letter carrier, bringing the mail from Fort Wayne before there was any post office in Chicago, went to Lyons in 1830 and kept, if he did not build, the Buckhorn Tavern. \" The Buckhorn Tavern was located on the west side of the Des Plaines River on Plainfield Road. Plainfield Road was also one of the main trails at that time, and con 31 nected with the Ogden Avenue Trail at Lyons. The Buck- horn was another tavern that provided accomodations for the weary traveler. 32 CHAPTER III EARLY SETTLERS The Polk family was one of the first permanent resi- dents in Lyons, Edmund R. Polk was born in Pennsylvania in 1776 and died in 1859. He served under General \"Tip- pecanoe\" Harrison in the War of 1812. Edmund and Mar- garet Polk's children were Henry H. , James, William, Wesley and Wilson. Wesley was born in Jefferson County, Kentucky on November 4, 1818. The Polk family left Jefferson County in 1831 and moved to Indiana where they lived until 1833, when they headed their covered wagon toward Illinois. They settled in Lyons Township and purchased a tract of wild, unculti- vated land on Section 21 of the Township. This pioneer family braved many hardships on the trail and discovered the prairies still housed numerous Indians and Chicago was the center of trading for the pioneers. Wesley spent his early manhood on the new farm un- til 1849 when he, his brother, Henry, and three other ad- venturous young men headed their pack mules west with California and the famous Gold Rush as their destination. They reached California after traveling several months - walking most of the way. Wesley was a prospector and miner from 1849 until 1851. His venture proved quite successful and, after a visit to New York, he returned to Lyons by way of the water route, via, no doubt, the Chi- cago Portage. Wesley responded to the country's call for troops in 1862 and enlisted as a private, was assigned to Company H, 127th 111. Infantry and was mustered into service in Chi- cago. After serving in the Battles of Vicksburg and Arkan- sas Post, he was discharged in 1865 as a corporal. Mr. Polk returned to the family farm after the war where he resided until 1881. He then purchased another 33 farm, located at what is now Route 66 and Manheim Road. Mr. Polkfs farm consisted of 190 acres of rich land. Wesley married Miss Mary J. Bielby in I860. She was born in 1843 near Utica, New York and died in 1904. They had one child - Edmund R. who was born on March 7, 1866 and died in 1936. Wesley Polk served as Justice Of The Peace for fourteen years, was Township Collector and Supervisor, and a member of the Grand Army Post. Wesley died on May 23, 1893 and his remains are entered in the Lyons - ville Cemetery. The Polk family burial plot occupies a corner of this cemetery. Many other first families of Lyons and the surrounding area are also buried in the Lyonsville Cemetery. Edmund R. Polk married Agnes M. Little (1869- 1950) on January 14, 1891. One of their children, Wesley W. , carried on the family farm after his father's death. Stephen White was also one of Lyons1 oldest resi- dents. He was born in Hanover, Crafton County, New Hampshire - three miles south of Dartmouth College - on April 10, 1807. He came to Lyons in 1830 and, after vis- iting the area at frequent intervals, settled here in 1840. A large tract of land (over 300 acres) was owned by Mr. White and was located between Joliet and Ogden Ave- nues - extending west beyond the stone quarry. He owned and operated a farm and the White Stone Quarry and Lime Kilns which were across the road from the red brick home stead. Mr. White was a very active man and held a variety of public offices in Lyons and its Township. Namely, School Trustee 18 years, Assessor 9 years, Supervisor 2 years, and Postmaster 15 years. He was chosen over- seer of Highways of District 2 in 1850, in addition to sev- eral other minor offices. 34 •\"* *r* STEPHEN WHITE 35 Stephen White Homesteadt in 1896, Dr. &: Mrs Salisbury, their daughter (Helen), Ralph, Glen Laura and George White, and Fred Schultz 36 Stephen White married Elizabeth Gregg in Cleveland, Ohio in 1837, and they had two children - John Clarence and Harriet Francis. Harriet married Dr. George M. Fox on July 2, 1851, and they also had two children - Har- riet, born April 25, 1854, and Mary F. , born March 10, 1861. Dr. & Mrs. Fox resided in LaCrange where Dr. Fox also had his office. He reported 200 people living'in Lyons in 1851, and a very comfortable hotel. There were no other communities between Lyons and Naperville at that time. Mrs. Harriet White Fox died in 1892. John Clarence's children were George Stephen, Frank Leland, Ralph Clarence, Laura Elizabeth, Glen, Bessie, Hazel May, and Helen. Laura White presently lives in Evanston. Frank's children are Leland (\"Docky\"), John, Evelyn, Eugene and Dorothy. All of these descend-' ants of Stephen White, except Evelyn, presently reside in Lyons. The old White Family homestead it still standing on the southwest side of Ogden Avenue (between Leland and Lawndale Avenues), and is presently owned by Mrs. Martin Potokar whose husband purchased the property in 1914. Mr. A. T. Andreas, when compiling the records for his book> History Of Cook County, Illinois, copyright 1884, states that he was fortunate in being able to interview Stephen White. The following is a statement made by An- dreas. \"Notwithstanding Mr. White1 s three score and seven years, he is hale and his brain is as quick and active as it was many years since. To his memory the public are indebted for much of the oldest history herein presented. \" Mr. White recalled that the earliest settlers in the township were Edmund Polk, Russell E. Heacock, Thomas 37 One of the oldest buildings in Lyons, recently- razed, was located on Joliet Avenue and known as Hotel D'Lyon when operated by Mrs. Faradeau who claimed her ancestors came to Lyons in the late 1700's. Stone structure on Joliet Avenue, recently torn down, built in 1800' s and known as \"Palmer House\". 38 Flaherty, Samuel Mars, John Jay, George W. Beebe, Thomas Butcher, Wilson and James McLintock, Elijah Wentworth, Jr., Joseph Evans, \"Scotch\" Brown, Joseph Vial, and Henry and William Carrington. There was also Joseph Evans, who kept a tavern at Mount Pleasant, a Colonel Witt, and Joshua Sackett. Stephen Forbes, an in and out settler in this area and Cook County's first sheriff, purchased 166. 56 acres of land situated in the North East quarter, Section 2, Town- ship 38 N. , R. 13 East of 3rd P. M. for $208. 20 on Octo- ber 17, 1835. Lyons was referred to as \"Town of Lyons\" in an abstract of tittle in the year 1838. Stephen White bought the majority of Forbes' pro- perty (163. 28 acres) on May 17, 1843 for $1, 000. The first link in public transportation began around 1834. A stagecoach line was operated from Chicago to Ottawa at a fare of $5. 00 per person. It takes approxi- mately two hours to travel this distance today -- The stagecoach was on the trail a day and a half. This was also a very uncomfortable journey since the dirt roads were nothing but widened Indian trails and filled with many deep ruts. And, after a rain, the wheels of the stage were often buried in the mud. Joshua Sackett built the first log house in Lyons and kept a tavern at the triangle on Ogden Avenue and Barry Point Road. His property included forty acres of land. Another tavern was located on the south side of the street a little west of Sackett's, and was known as Lund's (or Lunn's) Tavern. Both taverns faced Ogden Avenue - Com- petition had begun! Our town was known for its taverns many years ago just as it is in this day and age. An important evidence of 39 this fact is shown in 1833 when a group of officials met in Lyons to discuss the incorporation of Chicago as a city over a keg of beer. There is a possibility that this im- portant discussion may have taken place at either Sackett's or Lund's Tavern. Theodorus Doty and his wife, Catherine, bought Mr. Sackett's tavern and property in September of 1848 for $360. This tavern was then called the Yorkshire and was very popular with the farmers who were on their way to Chicago to sell their cattle since pens were provided for the livestock. The Yorkshire also had accommodations for anyone wishing to spend the night. Doty sold the portion of his forty acres lying west of Harlem, east of the Des Plaines and north of the Naper- ville Road (Ogden) to Isaac Cook in 1850. Mr. Cook had another strip of land in this area also and decided to de- velop the property into a town. A plat was recorded in 1857 and the town of Cooksville was subdivided. This land was later included as part of Riverside, and was trans ferred to Lyons in 1897. Theodorus Doty was a prominent citizen of Lyons for many years, and did much to improve the town. During his residence, he held the offices of Postmaster and Jus- tice Of The Peace. He left Lyons in about 1864 and set- tled in Chicago where he kept the Doty House at Randolph and State Streets until the Chicago Fire. The Hofmann family, also long time residents of Lyons, migrated to America from Germany in the early 1800's. They wished to purchase land rights and traveled to Pittsburgh and Cincinnati. They left Cincinnati, well prepared to pioneer and build in Northern Illinois. The three Hofmann brothers - George, John and Valentine - finally settled in Chicago in the Western Avenue area. Around the time of the Civil War, John decided to 40 come to Lyons, and bought property in Lyons and Summit. He also retained his property in Chicago. John established a slaughter house on the corner of Joliet and Ogden Ave- nues, and built a home on Ogden Avenue where his chil- dren - John Jr. , Mary, Elizabeth, George, Valentine and Martin - were raised. He also built a home at 3948 Joliet Avenue for his parents, where they lived for a short time. After their return to Sharpsburg (near Pittsburgh), John Sr. made his home in this dwelling until his death in 1918 at the age of ninety-one. Martin (John Sr. fs youngest son) married Minnie Gatz in 1904. He was the first president of the Lyons School Board and introduced the free text book system in the early 1890's. He also served as Village Clerk and was instrumental in obtaining the sewage and water for Lyons. His children were Marion, Dorothy, Patricia, Virginia, John and Shirley. Martin's only son, John, was elected to the office of President of the Village Board of Lyons on April Zl, 1953 -a position he held until 1961. Valentine Hofmann (John Sr. 's brother) was pro- prietor of a tavern and picnic grove on Ogden Avenue, the site of Mangam's Chateau. His children were Catherine, Elizabeth, Margaret, Mamie, Frank, Jack and William. He also owned a great deal of property in Lyons and River- side. George Hofmann, Sr. resided in Chicago and had three sons and a daughter, Elizabeth. His sons - Alves, George Jr. and Valentine - organized and directed the Hofmann Brothers1 Brewing Company for many years. It included several individual breweries and was finally sold to the Peter Fox Brewing Company in the 1930's. George Hofmann, Sr. was the next proprietor of the Yorkshire (after Theodorus Doty) and changed its name to the Lyons Tavern. He added a horse yard and settlers brought their horses to Lyons, where they were bought by the Army. 41 HOFMANN TOWER 42 The Lyons Tavern received a new owner in approxi- mately 1876 in the person of Louis Leonhardt. The tavern still provided for the travelers and farmers, but there was also a smaller structure in use at its side called the \"side room\". The side room was a meeting place for community- residents. In addition to a pool hall, Leonhardt1 s side room was used for weddings, dances and meetings. The side room was also a gymn for boxers who came from Chicago to train. John L. Sullivan was one of many famous boxers to train at Leonhardt's. The work-out route used by the fighters was Joliet Avenue to 47th Street - 47th to Lawndale - Lawndale to Ogden - and Ogden back to the gymn. Louis Leonhardt!s porter served as a sparing part- ner for the boxers and, as a result, became a professional boxer. His name was Charlie White. Leonhardt's tavern burned down in 1892 and the land was sold to George Hofmann, Jr. George Hofmann, Jr. also came into possession of the property where the Chateau now stands from the Valentine Hofmann heirs. He remodeled the old tavern which came to be known as the Chateau and was considered to be one of the finest night clubs of its time. George constructed the concrete tower in 1908 which very often identifies Lyons. It was a very impressive sight to behold in the dark of the night, since the tower was illuminated with hundreds of electric lights. It is re- ported that the glowing lights could be seen across the prairies by the residents of Chicago. Mr. Hofmann also owned launches which embarked at the tower and made scenic trips up the river. The river was then crystal clear. George Hofmann, Jr. probably had many ideas for the tower's usage, but no one knows exactly why it was built. Some think he intended it to be a hotel; others that he would hold an art contest annually for teenage artists, and the winning paintings would grace the winding walls of 43 the tower. In that way, Lyons and the tower would have become well known throughout the world. Another thought is that it was built as a lasting monument to the Hofmann family and its part in the early days of Lyons. Although there are many theories for the tower's construction, the one uppermost in people's minds is that Mr. Hofmann in- tended it to house machinery (which he invented) for the purpose of generating electricity from the dam; since he repaired the dam at the time of the tower's construction and possessed riparian rights for a period of 100 years. When the Sanitary District began depositing sewage into the river, however, he became discouraged and conse- quently the tower was neglected. Regardless of the intention for the tower's construc- tion, it is a landmark which whispers the name Hofmann, a pioneer family of Lyons. 44 CHAPTER IV BEGINNING OF INDUSTRY The Naperville Road was in terrible condition in the 1830!s and 40fs. This is explained in a Chicago newspaper article of that time: \"We have never seen worse roads than that to Barry's Point and five miles west to Doty!s Tavern on the Naper- ville Road. In an enterprising com- munity like ours, such obstacles to commerce and inland trade ought to be removed. If the Commissioners of this county will not do it, let them authorize the city to make the road. But in all events let the road be made. \" Because the Naperville Road (Ogden Avenue) was the main trail west from Chicago, it was the first road to be covered with wooden planks by the South Western Plank Road Company, and consequently called the Southwestern Plank Road. The road was completed in 1850 and extended from Bull's Head Tavern at Ogden and Madison Streets in Chicago to Brush Hill (Fullersburg). The Southwestern Plank Road was a one lane road, eight feet wide and constructed of planks three inches thick, A toll gate was located at Joliet and Ogden Avenues and charged the following tolls: 37£ - Carriage pulled by two horses 25£ - Carriage, cart or buggy pulled by one horse, 10£ - Horse and rider 4£ - Head of cattle 45 3£ - Sheep The plank road was later connected to another plank road at Fullersburg. This was the Oswego Plank Road and reached Naperville. It was originally planned to ex- tend to Oswego but never quite made it. The Southwestern Plank Road was quite a success since farmers hauled their produce to Chicago to be sold. Consequently, the toll charge got the farmers both coming and going. A mill was one of the earliest reported enterprises. Stephen Forbes built this structure, probably in the 1830's. Theodorus Doty bought the mill in 1843 from Forbes. The property is described as: \"Commencing at North East cor- ner of Section 2, T. 38 N. , R. 12 E. thence S. 40 rods, W, 23 rods, thence due North to the center of the Des Plaines River, thence down said river until it strikes the North line of said Section, thence East to place of beginning, 5 acres more or less.\" By the purchase of the mill property from Forbes, Doty also acquired the rights to operate a dam, as granted by the Illinois State Legislature, May 4, 1845. This right permitted him to \"construct dams, millraces, etc. , and to overflow the bottom lands. \" The right was mentioned in a property deed to one of the local businesses situated near the banks of the Des Plaines. The mill was located on the south bank of the Des Plaines River, just east of the Lyons -Riverside Bridge (Barry Point Road). It was first a sawmill and supplied lumber to such wagon makers as Schuttler, Weber and Poterman of Chi- cago. Theodorus Doty sold his holdings to Dr. William B. Egan in approximately 1853. The mill and right to operate the dam were purchased by Stephen White shortly after- ward. Dr. Fox, Stephen White's son-in-law, took over the mill in 1856 and replaced it with a new two- story 46 Dr. Fox's Mill 47 stone structure on the same section. This mill lasted un- til the end of the century. Along with the changing of the building, Dr. Fox also changed the purpose. The mill now served the farmers by grinding their wheat, oats, barley, etc. The mill was known and used by farmers for miles around. Many of these early settlers made their trip to the mill an all day affair. Lyons was known for its hospitality in those days also and they were assured of an enjoyable time. Unfortunately, the mill burned down around the turn of the century, bringing to an end a very profitable and familiar place of business. The present Tower Inn build- ing (which is the new headquarters of the Lyons Chamber of Commerce) is constructed of the remaining stones. Mr. Pershing and his son, Oscar, were the last men to run the mill according to information supplied us. Among the first industries, the brewery excelled and was one of the most popular businesses in this vicinity. It was known to all as Mueller !s Brewery and began operation in 1856. Three brothers, Henry, Adolph and Rudolph Meuller were its proprietors. One daughter is reported to have been born on this property. The Brewery and Mueller home were situated on the east bank of the Des Plaines River, north of the Ogden Avenue Bridge. This was \"Cooksville\" land and the resi- dents of Riverside and Lyons carried on disputes for many years as to the correct locality. The Muellers designated Lyons as their address, however, and many people con- nected this establishment as a part of Lyons. In addition to being a place of business, Mueller's Brewery was also a place for enjoyment and relaxation. A person was always welcome and many came not only for the delicious beer but for their splendid gardens as well. These included well kept grounds and beautiful flower beds 48 u <D U PQ en CD o W) d Q 1 49 which were widely known as the \"Brewery Gardens\". Thus, a view of the clear water plus an added attraction of a glass of beer \"on the house\", kept Mueller's filled to constant capacity. Mueller's business included the production and dis- tribution of beer. The wagons, pulled by horses, delivered the kegs to many of the local taverns, and were a familiar sight to early residents. Although a place of gaiety, the Brewery did witness one of the greatest historical tragedies in the United States. This took place on October 8, 1871 when the eastern sky became a brilliant red. The late Mrs. Frank Neher, Jr. (then a small child), her mother, Mrs. Stubbing s, Adam Metz, and many more people watched a spectacular tragedy from the top of the Brewery -- The burning of Chicago. Many residents of Lyons were kind and sympathetic toward the people of Chicago. As a result, they opened their hearts and homes to many who had lost all their pos- sessions. The Brewery itself was destroyed by fire in 1873, and ended an industry that had provided enjoyment to many and the scene of one major tragedy. The ruins of the Brewery remained standing for many years. Julius Gatz lost his life when one of the walls collapsed while he was exploring the decayed site. The unfortunate lad, just thirteen years old, was the twin brother of Minnie Gatz, now Mrs. Martin Hofmann, and mother of a past Village President. As a result of the ac- cident, the entire ruins were torn down and filled in. Re- mains of the caves, where the kegs of beer were stored, can still be seen along the river bank. An original architects drawing of the Brewery is still in existence, and can be seen on the wall of the tavern owned by the Neher s - which is now the oldest tavern in 50 4 s iSmtfr Neher's Tavern 51 Lyons and has been in the Neher family since 1888. Al- though the painting of the Brewery had faded a good deal with the passing years, it was recently \"touched up\" and now reveals all of the many details of the structure. The Neher !s came to Lyons in .1866 and a homestead was built by George and Elizabeth Neher on \"Lot 2, block 30 of the town of Cooksville being a subdivision of the East half (except that part of said half lying south of the South- western Plank Road and where Mueller's Brewery is located) of Section 36, T. 38 N. , R. 12 of the 3rd P.M. in Cook County, Illinois.\" Frank Neher came into possession of the property in 1876. Frank Neher, Jr. bought the present Neher tavern in 1888. This was originally Hauser's Tavern and was built in 1870. Neher !s tavern is presently operated by Frank Neher, Jr. 's son - Walter Neher. Mrs. Frank Neher, Jr. (Grandma Neher), who passed away recently at the age of ninety-one, lived through an era of sixteen United States Presidents and five major wars. Grandma Neher was born during President Andrew John- The Galena & Chicago Union Railroad ran from Chi- cago to Elgin in the 1840's. Aurora needed better transpor- tation so, in 1849, the State Legislature was asked to build a railroad from Aurora north to the Galena &: Chicago Union in Elgin. This branch became known as the Aurora Branch Railroad. The road was later expanded from Aurora west- ward to Mendota, Galesburg, Peoria, Quincy and Burling- ton, Iowa. As a result, the name was changed to the Chi- cago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. Farmers and manufacturers living east of Aurora, who desired to send their goods to Chicago, were required to take their products to Aurora and ship them from there. The towns located on the Southwestern Plank Road formed 52 a committee and, on July 28, 1858, petitioned the railroad to build a line through their settlements. The towns of Lyons, Brush Hill, Downers Grove, Lisle and Naperville were involved in the petition. The following is a portion of the document which was sent to the President, Board of Directors, and Stockholders of the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy: \"Gentlemen: We respectfully beg leave to submit for your considera- tion a few facts connected with the building of an independent track from Chicago via Naperville to connect with your road at Aurora. \"This route, which is at present deprived of Railroad facilities, is not surpassed for diversified beauty and productiveness by any section of Northern Illinois. With these natu- ral advantages it is not surprising that it is now for the most part thickly settled with an enterprising population. \"No section of the country between Lake Michigan and Fox River affords equal inducements to the farmer and mechanic, and no part of the West, of easy access to Chicago, presents the same attractions to families in the city who are seeking residences in the country; for, while no portion of the route is too remote, it lies through a beautiful region which is proverbial for its healthfulness. \"We would add, for your considera- tion, the following statistics of the business transacted during the past year at the different points on the route 53 of your contemplated road. \"LYONS, ten miles west from Chi- cago, is a point which your road would soon bring into notice for business and for suburban residences, and al- though it is but a short distance from Chicago, its business would be desir- able to any road. It is estimated that this would be one of the most remunera- tive stations within fifty miles of the city. There are inexhaustible quarries of stone here of the very best quality for lime and suitable for building pur- poses. The demand for rubble stone, for the City of Chicago, on this place would be immense, and could be sup- plied to any extent. \"The Lime business as now carried on, has furnished, during the past year, to Chicago, over 100, 000 barrels, equal to 20, 000, 000 lbs. at a cost for transportation of more than $13,000. Your road would open a new and exten- sive market to this business from the west, which could be supplied to any account. \"There is an extensive Brewery at this place, which now furnishes freight equal to one car load per day. With Railroad facilities, this establishment would more than double its present freight, for at least nine months in the year, and has capacity to supply any increased demand which the building of your road would create. \"Other local freights, not enumer- 54 ated above, would equal, if not exceed, any other station within the same dis- tance from the City of Chicago. \" This letter went on to name the advantages of Brush Hill, Downers Grove and Naperville. It closed: \"As representatives of the people along the line of the proposed road, we offer you their united support and pledge you the right of way between the west line of Du Page County and the Des Plaines River at Lyons, em- bracing some twenty-four miles of the route, and probably the greater portion of the distance from the last named point to the City Limits of Chicago, free of cost, provided the road is soon built.

The road was double tracked from Chicago to the Des Plaines River and continued as a single track from there to Aurora. The station at Lyons was named \"Lyons Station\". The station west of Lyons was called \"West Lyons Station\". These are known today as the Riverside and LaGrange Depots. By 1870, Lyons had changed from a fur trading sta- tion to a farm settlement, and was rapidly becoming a residential community, ready for incorporation. 57 CHAPTER V LYONS AND ITS OFFICIAL BEGINNING We devote this chapter to the establishing of govern- ment in Lyons and improvements made with the passing years. In order to make the story a little more interesting, we will portray, through stories and anecdotes, the per- sonalities of just a few prominent citizens of Lyons. Many of these stories are familiar to old-timers and will, we hope, not only stir up happy memories of the \"good old days\" but also be of interest to all. Although Lyons is the oldest suburb of Chicago, it seems hard to believe that it was one of the last communities to be incorporated. The farmers and tavern owners of the mid 1800's probably didn't have the need for a local govern- ment, so the incorporation was delayed a bit. Industry was developing, however, in the form of quarries. Lyons was found to be quit'e rich in its limestone, granite, etc. , thanks to the glacier age. Stephen White and Fred Schultz discovered these mines and soon the community was sup- plying nearby towns and Chicago with the needed material for building construction. The quarries proved quite suc- cessful -- Log homes were abandoned and the advantages of stone in buildings were recognized. Not only were the homes sturdier, they also outlived the wooden structures. Realizing the need for unity in the community, a com- mittee was formed and Lyons was incorporated as a village on August 16, 1888 with Thomas Collins presiding. This meeting was probably held at Louis Leonhardt's \"side room\", as were most of the important gatherings of that day. The first board of trustees was: John Berner - August Dobert - George Frimmersdorf - George Neher - Fred Schultz - and Chris Zimmerman. After the official business was taken care of, the 59 Q) TJ • H CO U <D > •H tf ti CD <D £ 4-J CD £ CO r-H T3 • H fn CO rQ ~x M 0 +-> h CO u • Q cd A TJ 4-> d 4-> rt 0 rt i MH CO • H n 0 M-T >^ 0 -3 cu -d £ rt 0 ftf 60 board was confronted with the serious task of organizing the administration. It began by appointing a constable, village attorney, committees on public buildings, streets, sanitation, etc. During the first year of its incorporation, the town made many changes toward the betterment of Lyons. Just a few of these improvements were twenty street lamps and a badly needed village \"calaboose\" - which some re- port was \"jam packed\" over weekends. Most people of other towns looked to Lyons as a lackadaisical town high- lighted at night by tavern lights. After a hard week's work, men carreto carefree Lyons for a jovial weekend, but often ended up in our popular calaboose. The following years viewed the first official map of the town, an animal pound and an oil house. Advancement followed quickly. The main streets proudly showed off a new coat of cinder sidewalks, which were later replaced with wooden walks. The fine calaboose burned down in 1892. This did not destroy the people's faith in the Fire Department, how- ever, they just saw to it that the Department was improved by a new fire engine to prevent any further calamities. The telephone began appearing in many homes in 1894. Arrangements were made for the laying of tracks over the Ogden Avenue Bridge for the operation of tram cars in 1895. The following is a letter, arranging for this construction which the McArthur Brothers Company, Con- tractors, sent the Board of Trustees of the Village of Lyons on May 20, 1895. \"Confirming the verbal agreement of our Mr. C. L. Spencer, in con- sideration of the privilege granted us by your Board, to lay a tram-car track across that portion of the Ogden Avenue Bridge belonging to the Village 61 of Lyons, we hereby agree to lay the track as close as practical to the north side of the bridge, and plank between and at the sides of the rails, also to plank lengthwise of the bridge, and when the delivery of crushed stone for improvements under our contract with the Village of Riverside has been completed and the track removed, we agree to replank that portion of the bridge belonging to the Village of Lyons, with one course of 18-feet 3-inch pine plank. \"In crossing Ogden Avenue at the west end of the bridge, we are to put in plank between the tracks and fill up the roadway on each side of the track so as to make an even and smooth roadway. We will also em- ploy a watchman at the bridge for the purpose of keeping a clear passage- way for teams. \" The letter was signed - \"A. McArthur, President\". The Ogden Street Railway Company officially opened their line on May 28, 1896. The inaugural train left West Madi- son and 40th Street Station at 2:30 p.m. on the 28th. A new concrete bridge was constructed in 1911, with a tres- tle for trolley cars alongside. Near the turn of the century, the streets were named, Many bear the names of early settlers and their families. Amelia -- For Mrs. Amelia Prescott, the wife of Colonel Prescott. Collins -- In honor of the first Mayor, Thomas Collins. 62 Gage -- For David A. Gage who owned a large amount of land in Lyons at one time. Joliet -- Joliet Avenue is an exten- sion of the Joliet or Portage Road which led to Joliet, Illinois. The Joliet Road has been renamed High- way 66, and Joliet Avenue in Lyons was formed when the Ogden Avenue trail came into prominence in the middle 1800's. Joliet Avenue was the connecting road between the Portage and Ogden Avenue trails. Leland -- For Leland Moody who owned a few acres of land in Lyons. His daughter, Laura, married John Clarence White - Stephen White's son. Prescott -- For Colonel Prescott who owned land and also subdivided Lyons. Salisbury -- For Ackland Salisbury, guardian of the White children and executive of the White Estate. White -- For Stephen White, one of the first permanent settlers in these parts. The west end of town was settled primarily by a group of people of Polish-American descent. This re- sulted in the naming of streets familiar to their homelands Custer -- Is the English pronunciation of the Polish hero, Kosciusko, who served as an American General during the Revolutionary War. Cracow and Warsaw were streets in the cities of Poland. Pulaski -- After Count Casimir 63 Pulaski, a Polish soldier, patriot and General in the Amer- ican Revolution. Conrad -- For Joseph Conrad, born in Poland. Teador Jozef Konrad became an English novelist and wrote many famous essays and novels. Included among his works are Lord Jim and Christmas Day At Sea. The area in which Laughton!s Trading House was lo- cated had been bought in two sections. The north half (near Highway 66) was owned by Messrs. Mariott and Rose, while Joseph Drevny possessed the south half (near 47th Street). The property was leased by Mr. McBride and used as a pasture for draft horses in the 1890's and early 1900!s. These draft horses labored many hours a day, pulling wagons of beer, coal or lumber and, as a result, became very tired and worn. Many owners of industries requiring draft horses brought their animals to McBride1 s where they could rest and regain their strength. Mueller's Brewery and the Mill probably made use of the McBride pasture also. The Forest Preserve District bought the land in 1917, and discovered that the original large trees, grass and wild flowers had been trampled - leaving the entire area completely bare. New trees and grass was immediately planted, and the land has regained much of the original beauty admired by the first explorers and fur traders. The area was called McBride's Woods for many years, but has recently been changed to the Ottawa Trails, because the Ottawa Indians used the Stoney Ford quite often in their journeys. Local government was keeping up with the changing times. Officials appointed a Board of Health, and plans were started for a Water Works System, sewage disposal, and an electric plant. The sewage disposal prior to 1910 was merely deep ditches along the roads. President Smith began the modernization of the inadequate disposal facilities and, by 1911 or 1912, President White, the mayor at that time, finished the job started by Mr. Smith. Our present mayor, William G. Smith, is the nephew of 64 /.W* j 1 ' : — 5 ' ifc M S .1 y JL* The Lyons Village Hall Today 65 the early day President Smith. A remembered incident at this time is told by old timers. Tim Ryan owned a saloon on the property located on Ogden Avenue, near the present Ranch. He also owned an ice house close to what is now the Des> Plaines Valley Mosquito Abatement headquarters. Water was taken from the then sparkling clear Des Plaines, refined by the use of chemicals, and turned into ice. During the refining process, Tim injected a coloring that turned all of the ice red. Many of the local and Chicago taverns featured \"red ice\" in 1900. Land was bought on Ogden and Center Avenues in 1900 for $1, 000 and the present Village Hall was built on that site. An Agreement, dated October 1, 1900, for the construction of the Village Hall showed (Frank) Hofmann & Arden as the principal contractors, and Nick Metz & Son for the masonry work. Although it is true that Lyons had a roaring night life, many people also enjoyed the daytime facilities. George Hofmann, Jr. owned a piece of land along the river bank - in addition to his dam, tower, and the triangle. This piece of land was used as a picnic grovet Extra \"Buffalo\" type trolley cars were put on the Lyons run on Sundays and holidays. They were always filled to capacity with picnickers. Canopied boats were also provided and carried their passengers on scenic trips up the \"crystal clear\" waters of the Des Plaines and back to the docks, located just west of the dam. (Evidence of these docks is still visible. ) In the evenings, Mr. Hofmann provided an orchestra and show in the triangle (formed by Barry Point, Joliet and Ogden Avenues), thus ending a perfect day. 66 CD 03 r^ • O +■» ^ ~1 £ <D O •H r— < ,_, §3 ■? p 0 PI 4-> CD a CO CD ft •H ^ g U 4-J PS 0 £ • H ffi 0 r3 CD 0) CO X 4-> n) 53 >b >- CD ™ * CD O CO CD U 3 ffi P> w> So ^ £ ^ CO CD «j O ja H 67 T5 CD a a o u u Ctf CD CQ 0 T? el CD CO r-H • GUO 0 r*4 ^ 3 U (T5 fl «J • H CD CU rH > 4-> <! d CO +-> CO CD d • H r-H £ 0 ID <4H 0 o2 CD K a rCj CD CD £ bJO bJO ^-»v 0 o T3 CD >^ 0 o ^Q tf 68 a £ a 0 <tJ T3 <U 4-> s 0 u 0 • i — 1 ?-l 1 s • CO *H fcuO • 0 •r-i 4-> cu 0 .-H Ti cu <-M r-H ?-H 4-> • H +■> CO 3 CO !h & rd •iH CO +J ON cu fl on r£ £ +-> a T3 el el 0 <+H 0 T3 TJ ffi rt cu cu 0 u o *H +-> i— J 0 G cu 0 •H o CO 0 >. cu *H CJ cu u •H O 4-1 m 0 69 We have been told that Mr. Hofmann had originally planned fo'r the boat dock and property on the triangle to be used by the underprivileged children of the country. He had inherited the present Mangam Chateau and the building behind it from the Valentine Hofmann heirs, and intended to house the children in these buildings. A high fence was built around the triangle and tower properties, and a pedestrian subway dug from the river property to the triangle, which was to be a playground and park. Although Mr. Hofmann1 s plans never materialized, his property resulted in giving the public many hours of enjoyment. The Chateau was put into use as a dance hall upstairs and a tavern on the first floor. The second floor of the present Mangam Chateau is a portion of the original building owned by the Hofmanns. It is interesting to note that, during the early 1900!s, clam bakes were the rage of the day. Kate Leonhardt, an early resident, and her husband, Louis, held clam bakes. A businessman usually sponsored these picnics for his employees. The cost was two dollars per couple. A two day preparation was necessary for a normal clam bake. Mr. Leonhardt' s first chore was to make a large bed of stones, using oak wood to heat the stones. This wood burned all night. The wood ash was then taken off the stones the following day, and seaweed placed over the hot rocks. Clams were placed in the center of the bed, then potatoes, chicken, fish (in bags), and corn (with the husks still on but the silks removed). Live green lobsters were placed on the very top. The entire bed was covered with cheese cloth and a canvas put over the cloth. The bed of food was completely buried with white sand and left to steam. Mrs. Leonhardt, in the meantime, set up long tables on which she put bread, butter, clam chowder, spices, 70 a, V u a a; CD t, PQ o rt M 71 ; 4 CD bJO OJ • H u u u 0) T3 CO •H o o O a) 72 celery, etc. Each couple was given a basket in which to put their lunch. After about two and one-half hours or more - de- pending on how large the bed was - the sand, canvas and cheese cloth were removed and delicious looking, red hot lobsters came into view. Everyone then brought their bas kets to the pit and chose the food they desired. The Talley-Ho was used to transport guests to the clam bakes. It was a very beautiful carriage of fine ma- hogany, brass trim, and red plush upholstery. It was drawn by four horses. The rental of the Talley-Ho was paid for by the sponsor of the Clam Bake. Moving on, we find that gas mains and electricity had been installed in many homes. The people were amazed as well as pleased when, in 1905, they were pro- vided with cement sidewalks on many of the main streets. It was not long after that many of the other streets were also producing these modern cement walks. Near the end of 1905, one hundred and thirty-five people took action in \"cleaning up the town\". They did so by drawing a petition and having it signed by all concerned and presented to the village officials - requesting them to close picnic grounds, public dance halls, and forbid music within the dram shops. After a time, moderate ordinances were passed to the satisfaction of the one hundred and thirty-five residents. Amusement and fun on a grand scale had a compara- tively short life in Lyons. Cream City was a Riverview type park, owned and operated by a corporation of business men. The property was originally owned and operated as a quarry by Fred Schultz. Cream City was built in 1907 and was a favorite of the people for miles around. The trolley line on Ogden Avenue ran right past the park, mak- 73 o O e a* U U rr 74 75 ing it very convenient to reach from Berwyn, Cicero and » Chicago. Its many thrills and attractions included roller coasters, merry-go-rounds, ferris wheel, figure eight (which was forty feet high), and many others. Side attrac- tions, booths, and an old time movie theatre - showing one of the current movies of the day - were enjoyed by many of the older folks who didnft feel up to \"risking their lives on those new f angled inventions\". One of the big attractions, especially for the young people, were the dances held on weekends. An excellent band (led by a gentleman named Rubin, who was later re- placed by Bohumil Kryl) was provided and everyone was assured of a good time. Along with its side attractions, Cream City also provided enjoyable entertainment for the elders in the form of band concerts. Many people sat and listened to the concert with a glass of beer at hand. Yes, beer and other drinks were served, showing they were surely situated in Lyons. It was not all drinking, however, and this amusement park was frequented and loved by many. Unfortunately, Cream City provided entertainment for a short period. White City had been built in Chicago and attracted many Chicagoans, and thereby cut into Cream City!s business. The rides and buildings were burned down, and the Lobe Wrecking Company removed the dance pavillion and towers which were located at the entrance to the park. People who saw and enjoyed Cream City can still see its \"funny mirrors\" in Neher's Tavern. Although these mirrors are over fifty years old, they are still as bright and shiny as new. In the gay amusement parkfs place now stands Cer- mak Park and swimming pool, owned and operated by the 76 LUN'Wi CE CREAM PA First ice cream parlor was operated by- Mrs. Kate Leonhardt, shown here with her son and sister, Miss Behrens. It was located on the northwest bank of the Des Plaines on Barry Point Road. 77 Forest Preserve District. A good time is still had by this generation, and many people enjoy the grounds pro vided for picnicking and the pool facilities. Going back in time once more, we find that the news- paper of the day was The Lyons Herald. We were fortunate enough to obtain a July 17, 1909 copy of the paper, and will quote a few parts of articles which may be of interest. \"Eleven motor boats now ply the Des Plaines River. There will be a Japanese latern regatta on Saturday, July 17. All motor boats, launches and canoes are invited to decorate their respective crafts with Japanese laterns and enjoy this festive occa- sion. Music and singing no doubt will be in abundance, as a great many of the young people have mandolins and guitars, and some musical voices. The sight will be enjoyed by many. \"There are some spots along the Des Plaines that equal in beauty any- thing in the Alps or any scenic river in the world. \"Watch for the lights on the tower on the dam in a few nights. This will be one of the most beautiful sights ever witnessed. The reflections in the water will simply be grand. \" One of the advertisements said: \"Lyons Family Theatre, F. J. Bau- meister, Manager. HIGH CLASS VAUDEVILLE, Illustrated Songs and Motion Pictures. Every evening 7:30, 78 Saturday and Sunday afternoons 2:00. Change of pictures every day. Fri- day night is Amateur Night. Admis- sion ten cents, Children under twelve years five cents.\" A census was taken in 1910 which reported the popu- lation in Lyons to be one thousand four hundred eighty-three By January of 1913, the Lyons -Riverside Bridge had become so weakened with age and traffic, that local town officials condemned the bridge. Barricades were erected at either end to prevent possible accidents. They proved of no avail, however, for they were seen soon afterward floating down the river. The barricades were erected again and again but al- ways removed by annoyed citizens. Officials then ordered that, in addition to the barricades, the center planks of the bridge be removed. The new barricades were also of a type that prevented easy removal. Complications over the building of a new bridge re- volved around the fact that the south end was in the Village of Lyons, while the north end was on property included in the Village of Riverside. To settle the legal angle, Lyons dis -annexed the area that included the bridge. The two townships of Riverside and Lyons were then able to handle the problem of raising funds for the reconstruction of the bridge. Each township agreed to pay one quarter, with the county paying the other half. This new bridge lasted over forty years, and was condemned in the spring of 1957. It was replaced with a bridge that was dedicated and opened to traffic on May 9, 1959. Movies were made in Lyons in the early ^OO's. The Popular Motion Picture Production Company of Chi- cago used a large tract of land in town for movie locations. Headquarters for the movie company was in a hall over Neher's Tavern. Wallace Berry and Gloria Swanson were 79 V* • . . . CD T$ O o <! >> CD r-H r-H 0 u H u rH 80 two of the many stars who came to Lyons to make movies. The outskirts of town possessed fields and prairies ideal for a western or country setting. The population in the early 1920's was approximately two thousand five hundred. As Lyons grew, so did its trans portation needs. A bus company was issued a sixty day permit to run its five cent bus line through the village. Traffic safety began to be a problem as far back as 1925. That year, traffic safety was improved when the Public Service Company installed traffic lights. Houses were numbered that year also. At this time, the Lyons Theatre, located at 4011 Joliet Avenue, was in full operation and going along quite well. The admission prices were: Adults - week days twenty cents, Saturday, Sunday and holidays - twenty-five cents; Children - always admitted for ten cents. Popular movies of the day included \"San Francisco\" with Clark Gable, Jeannette MacDonald, and Spencer Tracy -- \"White Fang\" starring Michael Whalen and Jean Muir -- And another oldy, \"Educating Father\" with Shirley Deane and Dixie Dunbar. Village policemen barred service on the Chicago and West Towns trolley line in 1926. This occurred when a street car jumped the track and fell from the Ogden Avenue Bridge into the Des Plaines River with fifty passengers on board. The following is a vivid news item of the day: \"Village President, John R. Hlavka, ordered that all cars be stop- ped at the bridge and service not be resumed until the railroad company install better track on the testle. He blamed poor track for the accident 81 and said that only a miracle pre- vented the loss of lives instead of twenty-five injuries in the wreck. Hlovka stated: 'There is a switch about thirty feet from the trestle. It was at that switch yesterday that the car jumped the rails, cut along the ties and dived into the river. It's a miracle that fifty persons were not drowned. It is fortunate that the river was lower than it had been a few days ago. ! \"The car was on its way from Berwyn to Lyons, carrying students from J. Sterling Morton High School in Cicero. Suddenly there was a for- ward leap, a grinding noise, and the car dashed front first into the Des Plaines River, the rear cars hanging on the trestle. Windows crashed as the seat backs reversed, throwing the passengers into the aisles, down on the floor and against the windows. \"Girls and women screamed from pain and fright as the water rushed into the car. Lyons firemen and police, hurriedly summoned, lowered ladders and rescued the trapped pas- sengers. Twenty passengers were taken to the Berwyn Medical Unit hospital where they were given treat- ment. Sixteen were removed to their homes after their wounds were treated. \"Those more seriously injured were: Victor Prince, Robert Schiefel- bein, Joseph Fiedler, and Marvel Deike, all of Lyons. \" 82 It is said that the trolley cars seemed to be jumping off the tracks at least once a week, although, fortunately, all of the occurrences weren't as drastic as the mishap on that particular day in 1926. The trestle was torn down in 1933, when the present Ogden Avenue Bridge was built. It seems the year 1928 was filled with new develop- ments and proposed projects. We will mention just a few. The Lyons Monitor was designated as the official newspaper of the village in April by the village officials. The Village Attorney was ordered to draw up an ordi nance for sidewalks on both sides of Ogden Avenue from Lawndale Avenue to Plainfield Road, and also on the south side of Plainfield Road. In October, police officers were instructed to shut off the stop and go signs at 11:00 p.m. and turn them on again at 6:00 in the morning. The town must have rolled up its streets after 11:00 p.m. Although prohibition was at its height and the out- ward appearance of the town was very quiet with the streets deserted, the \"red carpet\" was rolled out in many of the local saloons. One of these was a certain establishment located midway between what is now The Ranch and Rio Vista. Legal three point two beer was sold to strange, unfamiliar customers. But if the proprietor knew the pa- tron, the beer served would have alcohol injected into it. The better the customer was known, the higher the content of alcohol. The beer was sold at twenty-five cents a glass and, needless to say, its trade was booming. The riding stable in the Forest Preserve at Lyons was ordered moved in 1929, after many complaints of the residents. It was described as a \"nuisance to the neigh- borhood\". 83 Outh©uses were ordered in by May 1, 1930 or sub- ject to a fine. Four snow plows were purchased in 1929., President Klug instructed the Village Attorney to draw up a contract to furnish water to the Forest Preserve District for Cermak Park pool in 1930. The village Water Works Department was started in 1913 with the drilling of an artesian well one thousand six hundred fifty feet deep. A water tower, located on Joliet and Collins Avenues, was built at a later date for five thousand six hundred eighty- four dollars. Since its beginning, the Water Works De- partment has done an excellent job in seeing that the water supply in the village has been taken care of as efficiently as possible. The Heinz Company pickle wagon upset on the muddy roads of Custer and Grove Avenues early in the spring of 1930 -- The neighborhood youngsters had a good time pick- ing up the pickles as fast as they tumbled from the wagon. The Emil Scheive Post No. 699 of the American Le- gion dedicated a stone marker and two cannons in front of the Village Hall on May 19, 1935. The stone is inscribed \"Dedicated In Memory Of OUR DEPARTED COMRADES\", commemorating the war heros of Lyons. The Emil Scheive Post was formed in 1920 and named after a resident of Lyons who lost his life defending his country. A branch of the Veterans of Foreign Wars (V.F.W.) was also formed in Lyons. Since only those individuals who served overseas are eligible to belong to the V.F.W. an extension was formed -- They are known as the Vet- erans of Lyons. Any resident who was a member of the armed forces may belong to the Veterans of Lyons. The Lyons Lions Club was organized in 1934 for the purpose of uniting business and professional men in good fellowship. A few of the Club's aims are to maintain high 84 CD o >> o u > O •rH +-> U o r-H CD +-> 0 CO o > Z f-f \"cb O 5 ^ 85 m u •H a) o H 3 03 o 1-3 I a a) o X o 86 standards of business, promote civic projects and chari- ties, and uphold the principles of good government. A retaining wall on the south bank of the Des Plaines River was constructed by the Water Works Progress Ad- ministration. This wall is situated just above the Hofmann Dam. A deep well pumping unit was installed in 1938 at the Water Works for four thousand three hundred twenty- three dollars. Leland, Prescott, Amelia, Center and Gage Avenues were widened in 1939 at the colossal cost of sev- enty-five dollars. Traffic control signals were also in- stalled that year on the corners of 47th & Prescott - Ogden &: Harlem - and Ogden & Joliet Avenues. Mayor Bulat ordered anyone having music in their place of business to have an entertainment license in their possession in 1942. A board of Fire and Police Commissioners in Lyons was appointed on November 4, 1947. This placed our Police and Fire Departments under Civil Service. An ordinance was passed in 1949 which prohibited riding on running boards. In 1954, the Lyons Plan Commission was formed, consisting of nine members. Three members must be vil- lage officials. (These might include the Village President, Trustees, Counsel and Engineer. ) The six remaining mem- bers must be residents of Lyons. The job of installing new street lights on Ogden and Joliet Avenues, begun by Mayor Bulat, was completed by Mayor Hofmann in 1957. Listed below are the Presidents of Lyons, starting at the beginning of our government and ending with the cur- rent President. 1888-1891 Thomas Collins 87 1891-1893 George Frimmersdorf 1893-1895 Frank Moody 1895-1896 George Frimmersdorf 1896-1898 George Neher, Sr. 1898-1903 George Frimmersdorf 1903-1911 Charles H. Smith 1911-1913 Frank L. White 1913-1915 O. H. Nelson 1915-1919 Robert N. Parchman 1919-1921 Otto A. Klug 1921-1922 Eric Olson 1922-1923 Charles H. Smith 1923-1925 O. H. Nelson 1925-1927 John Hlavka 1927-1928 Otto A. Klug 1928-1936 William A. Smith 1936-1937 Charles H. Smith, pro tern 1937-1938 O. H. Nelson 1938-1940 Joseph Gentile 1940-1953 Theofil T. Bulat 1953-1961 John Hofmann 1961- William G. Smith The residents of Lyons should be very proud of their village at the present time. Through the diligent efforts of many fine Presidents and trustees, Lyons has lost its reputation of just being a town filled with taverns. There are still an abundant number of taverns in town, but these are operated in a respectable manner and very little sen- sational publicity results because of these businesses. There are now more than ten thousand residents in Lyons which is quite remarkable when compared to the 1950 figure of six thousand one hundred twenty. The population in- creased only one thousand two hundred thirty-eight be- tween 1940 and 1950. Many of the old landmarks and historic spots of Lyons remain standing today, in addition to the numerous modern buildings. Lyons, it seems, has been able to pre- serve the old and still make way for the new. 88 We have not gone into detail concerning the numer- ous improvements, ordinances and local clubs in the vil- lage. It is our opinion that these are important but space for detailed coverage is not available. The exciting and unusual happenings occurred in the fur trade era. Early- settlement is of interest also, but later developments and improvements, although important, need the passage of time to make them fascinating. Any local improvements, made since 1888, can be found in the village ordinances and minutes. These records may be read by any resident wishing to do so. 89 CHAPTER VI FIRE DEPARTMENT There was no organized Fire Department in Lyons prior to January 21, 1896. An ordinance was passed at that time for the purchase of a fire wagon. A structure was built only for the purpose of being burned, in order to prove the efficiency of the department. The old Fire Department was located at the village hall. Phillip Persian was made head of the volunteer \"Fire Fighters\", assisted by William Boss and ten volun- teers. The Board of Trustees granted permission that a few needed items be bought. These included: four dozen wooden pails - eighteen hats - two pair of rubber boots - a broom - an alarm bell - and a can of polish. The chief received eight dollars a month pay, and the volunteers were paid at the rate of fifty cents per hour for their work during a fire. The first man to answer the alarm received a one dollar bonus. Steve Dilli was made fire chief on December 5, 1899, and, on October 23, 1900 two hand fire extinguish- ers were purchased. Joseph Metz was appointed fire chief on July 17, 1903. The newly combined Fire Station and Water -Pumping Station moved to the present brick fire station - located at Collins and Joliet Avenues - in 1911. The building was dedicated on July 4 of that same year. A Diamond T fire truck was purchased in January of 1918. It was replaced in 1927 with an American LaFrance fire engine. And replaced in 1947 with another new Ameri- can LaFrance. Fred Master became fire chief in 1926 and held this position for many years. There were twenty-five volun- 91 wf^ Sv^ w ' / fi [ o*x !■ ^ ^ p*. % 111 * % li m it ill Z'r Lyons Fire and Water Departments 92 teer firemen in 1938. There are presently thirty-five volunteer firemen, with James Spolar as fire chief. The volunteers as paid two dollars an hour while at a fire. The Fire Department has been improved recently by the addition of new hoses - nozzles - raincoats - boots - helmets - and a two-way radio installed in the fire truck. With this up-to-date equipment, citizens are assured of efficient, fast service. 93 CHAPTER VII POLICE DEPARTMENT The beginning of law and order in Lyons is recorded as of September 6, 1888 with the appointment of Joe Fitz- gerald as the first Village Constable. His meager symbols of power consisted of one star engraved \"Lyons Police\" - one revolver - a box of car- tridges - two pairs of handcuffs - and three nippers. C. F. Runick, the village attorney, and Joe Fitz- gerald became a team which more than ably established local ordinances. As Constable, Fitzgerald was expected to collect revenue on dogs, and impound any animals roam- ing at large. He was allowed a percentage of the fee col- lected. Shortly after, the force was enlarged with the ap- pointment of special police officers, George Mitch and C. O'Neil. Their duties included assisting at emergencies and preventing Sunday frolics and celebrations from inter- fering with Church services, and nightly lighting of the village lanterns. Their assistance in the health and school departments were included in their regular line of duty. The Police Department was relocated in 1900, after the completion of the Village Hall. They were able to house prisoners in the basement of the Hall the following year when six cells were installed. A new stretcher, with all of the modern values, was obtained in 1905. It was used not only on emergency calls, but also as a fumigator for surgical use. Motorcycles were in use as early as 1920, and Dick Huizinga was appointed motorcycle policeman in 1922. In three years he was promoted to Police Chief. 95 Lyons was evidently living up to its reputation in 1929 as witnessed in the order that directed the Chief of Police to bring in all violators of Village ordinances, in- cluding stills and out houses. Four new motorcycles were purchased in 1930. The total cost of the cycles, plus full fire and theft insurance, amounted to two thousand ninety dollars. Mr. Huizinga was Chief of Police at the end of the 1930!s. He was assisted by Joseph Blazek, William Smith, Ted Walinski, and Frank Wroga. The department had one squad car which could also be converted into an ambulance. The meager salary of a policeman in 1939 ranged from one hundred forty dollars to one hundred seventy- five dollars - depending on the rank. The first one-way telephone was installed in the police cars by Mayor Theofil T. Bulat in 1941. This radio had connections between Western Springs to the west - North Riverside to the north - and McCook to the south- west. The remodeling of the run down and over crowded village hall was begun in late 1954. All work was done on a voluntary basis only and, within a period of four months and a cost of nearly seventy thousand dollars, Lyons ad- ministrative facilities were housed in attractive, efficient quarters. The Police Department was temporarily relocated in the Fire Station during this period. The Police Department presently consists of twelve men with James Svaboda as Police Chief. The duties of the present day police include answering all family calls and arguments - locate missing children and adults - arrest speeders - trace prowlers - arrange for ambulance service - provide oxygen in cases of emer- 96 gency - file death reports - and see that businesses are closed at the proper hourse Our policemen serve the town with thorough service twenty-four hours a dayn There are three eight hour shifts in each working dayc The present police equipment numbers four police cars, two motorcycles, one timer, a car equipped with radar and one ambulance (donated by the Lyons Lions Club) which contains an inhalator0 The inhalator serves a two- fold purpose by aiding in giving oxygen and reviving those close to death. The police cars are renewed every twenty- five thousand miles, or every six months - whichever oc- curs first. With the modernization of facilities, we are now able to house up to twenty prisoners at one time. Court is usually held every Wednesday with Judge Frank Machala presiding. This modern age has brought with it a police depart- ment well equipped and able to handle the needs of the vil- lage. 97 CHAPTER VIII U. S. POST OFFICE Although the exact date is not known, Theodorus Doty conducted a Fourth Class Post Office at Lyons in the 1840's. It was probably located in his tavern at Ogden Avenue and Barry Point Road. Stephen White became Postmaster in 1850 and held this job for fifteen years. Lyons was the main (or most populated) section of Lyons Tyownship at that time, so our Post Office probably included the entire Township. The mail was picked up and delivered to the Burlington Rail- road Station (Lyons Station) which was built in the late 1860's and is now known as the Riverside Station. Mail service prior to that time probably came to Lyons via the stagecoach or horse and rider. If Mr. White was Postmaster for fifteen years, this would mean he was replaced in 1865, but we have not been able to determine who his successor was. This period of time is very indefinite and inconclusive, and we were not able to find any specific information at this stage in the life of the U. S. Post Office in Lyons. The next known Postmaster was Joseph L. Condon, supposedly appointed in 1880. He operated the Post Office until George Neher took over in 1890. George J. Becker became Postmaster in 1894. He was followed by Nick Meyer in 1898. Postmaster Meyer had the Post Office in his home on Barry Point Road, next to what is now the Tower Inn. Postmaster Meyer died during his term, and his daughter, Anna Meyer, took over and completed her father's term as the first Postmistress of Lyons. Mrs. Lela Killips became the second Postmistress on April 1, 1902. The Post Office was in her father's home on Ogden Avenue, and consisted of a shelf in the liv- ing room. The town was growing by leaps and bounds, however, and, in 1903, Mrs. Killips' father, William Bentgen, built a one story building for her at 8019 Ogden Avenue. This building was located next to the Bentgen 99 Lyons Post Office and Killips1 residence was converted into a two -story building in 1911. 100 residence and served as the Lyons Post Office for thirty- one years, and the Killips residence until 1959. As the Killips family grew, more room was needed and, in 1911 the building was raised and a new first floor was erected' under it. The entire second floor became the living quar- ters for the family and the first floor was a combination Post Office-Grocery Store. Killips' Grocery Store sold everything from asprin to outboard motors. Prior to 1929, every resident had a box in the Post Office. On December 2, 1929 a village delivery service came into existence. William Garbutt and Joseph Srotir were hired as the first mail carriers. They delivered mail only to homes located on paved streets, and the boxes remained in the Post Office for those people living in the outskirts. Mr. Emil F. Kulhavy replaced Mr. Srotir as Carrier in 1930. The Post Office was raised to Third Class in 1931 and, as a result, Mr. Killips was forced to discontinue his thriving grocery business. He then went into the real estate business. Mrs. Killips' staff, over the thirty-one years she was Postmistress, included Millie Shure, Clerk - Marion Labush, Marion Hofmann, Assistants - William Garbutt Joseph Srotir, Emil Kulhavy, Carriers - and Henry Vydra, First Substitute Carrier. During this period, George Neher delivered the outgoing mail to the Riverside Depot and picked up the incoming Lyons mail. Henry Hosman became the next Postmaster in 1934. The Post Office was moved to 7941 Ogden Avenue. Al- though this building served as just a Post Office, it was used as a dime store, hardware store and drug store by the Neher Family in prior years. Bohumil Plos was appointed Postmaster on Janu- ary 18, 1937. His staff included Frank J. Szumski, Clerk - William Garbutt and Emil Kulhavy, Carriers - and Ralph Hosman, Substitute Carrier. Mr. Szumski left in Decem- ber of 1937 and more changes were necessary. Mr. Kovar (hired previously as a replacement for Substitute Carrier Hosman) was put in a clerical position, Grace Landa be- came the new Clerk, and Norman Edward Gabriel was 101 hired as Substitute Carrier. Longer working hours were also adopted at this time, due to steady growth in the vil- lage. Joseph Hruby became Postmaster in approximately 1942 and James A. Krecek in 1947. The Post Office had become much too small for the growing village, so, in 1955, the United States Post Office in Lyons moved to a modern, spacious building at 7909 Ogden Avenue. G. J. Hobart is the present Postmaster. 102 CHAPTER IX HEALTH CENTER What might be called the beginning of the Lyons Health Center, was the organizing of a Baby Clinic by the Fortnightly Club of Riverside in about 1918. Although the Baby Clinic was formed by women of Riverside, the actual Infant Welfare Center was located at Lyons, > on Ogden Avenue in Mr. Settecase's building. The Clinic included Berwyn, Lyons, McCook, Riverside, Riverside Lawn, and Stickney. The Clinic was held once a week, on Friday morn- ings, from nine until twelve, and took care of babies from birth until two years of age. The slogan was \"Keep A Well Baby Well\" and Dr. Reinhold Schluetter was"
