They were directed to produce a pathology‐based document using literature searches that were systematic, comprehensible, transparent and reproducible. Levels of evidence were graded. Each author was asked to provide a set of recommendations which were evidence‐based and unambiguous. These recommendations were submitted to the whole guideline group and scored.

The responsibility for drawing up these guidelines was given to experienced surgeons who are elected members of the ACPGBI’s Emergency Surgery Subcommittee. They were invited to contribute various sections of the guidelines, which include diverticular disease, colorectal cancer, postoperative problems and pregnancy, anorectal problems, the open abdomen and stomas.\n\nA document based on published articles in journals that had been properly reviewed and that were understandable, transparent and reproducible, and what they contained, was produced. The evidence was then graded. Each author was asked to provide a set of recommendations which were clear and unambiguous. These recommendations were then submitted to the whole group and scored. They were then refined and submitted to a second vote. Only those that achieved a consensus marked ‘strongly agree’ or ‘agree’ after two votes were included in the guidelines.\n\nAll aspects of emergency colorectal conditions (except abdominal trauma) have been included along with 122 recommendations. These guidelines provide an up to date review of the current surgical knowledge in the treatment of emergency colorectal conditions and should serve as an important guide for surgeons managing colorectal conditions in the emergency setting. As the guidelines point out, it is impossible for all individuals to be completely up to speed with new developments in all areas of surgery, so up to date guidelines play an essential role. These guidelines will support those surgeons who are required to provide emergency cover for a wide variety of problems when on call and will also act as a clear reference guide for others.\n\nPatients are best served if the profession regularly reviews important patient conditions such as emergency colorectal problems. An up to date review means that new developments, new techniques that are based on research and the experiences of colorectal surgeons from throughout the world are included.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAlthough guidelines exist for the management of emergency colorectal conditions in adults, there are areas of practice that require up to date review. The Emergency General Surgery (EGS) Subcommittee of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland (ACPGBI) has therefore commissioned a set of guidelines that are pathology based and cover the most common colorectal emergencies seen in day to day clinical practice.\n\nIn 2016 The Future of Emergency General Surgery—a Joint Document was produced by the ACPGBI, the Association of Upper Gastrointestinal Surgeons and the Association of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland (ASGBI) [1]. It contains 16 key recommendations covering all aspects of emergency general surgery but specifically ambulatory care, early senior decision‐making, infrastructure and the importance of a dedicated and recognized emergency component in job planning. This was followed in 2018 when the Royal College of Surgeons of England produced the report The Higher Risk General Surgical Patient: Raising the Standard [2], an update of the 2011 report, The Higher Risk General Surgical Patient [3]. It lists 12 new key recommendations which include consultant leadership, frailty, risk assessment, National Early Warning Score (NEWS), sepsis, radiology and quality assurance and improvement. It is the opinion of the expert group who produced the document that all 12 should be mandatory in all acute hospitals with adult general surgical services on site. These guidelines aim to complement these recommendations.\n\nEmergency surgery has for too long been seen as the Cinderella specialty within general surgery. However, the landscape is changing. Emergency surgery is becoming an ever‐increasing part of each and every service. Many units are now providing specialist rotas with specific lower gastrointestinal (GI), hepatobiliary and upper GI cover. Clearly this is only truly possible in those units big enough to provide the number of individual surgeons to staff such rotas.\n\nRecent publications [4] have shown that the outcomes for those patients with acute colorectal problems are best when dealt with by a colorectal specialist. The same is true for upper GI problems. The National Laparotomy Audit (NELA) report 2016–17 reveals that almost 50% of all emergency laparotomies are performed because of colorectal pathology [5].\n\nHowever, the reality in many smaller District General Hospitals is that all members of the surgical team are required to provide out of hours emergency cover. It is impossible for all individuals to be completely up to speed with developments in every area of general surgery and so up to date evidence‐based guidelines are an essential part of an individual's armamentarium. As such, these emergency colorectal guidelines will support those individuals who are required to provide emergency cover for a wide variety of problems when on call. They will also act as a clear reference guide for others. It should be noted that as there are adequate pre‐existing national guidelines for the management of abdominal trauma this topic has been purposely omitted.\n\nThe primary objective is to provide detailed evidence‐based guidelines that are practical and easily applicable in the clinical setting, for the target audience of surgeons undertaking adult emergency colorectal surgery in Great Britain and Ireland.\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nConsultant surgeons who are elected members of the ACPGBI Emergency General Surgery (EGS) Subcommittee (ASM, BB, MDC, SED, RJG, DAJS together with PJT) were invited to contribute various sections to the guidelines. They were directed to produce a pathology‐based document using literature searches that were systematic, comprehensible, transparent and reproducible. Senior trainees (KB, NMF, LHM, GR, DW) who were affiliate members of the ACPGBI contributed fully to several of the sections. A consultant radiologist (JAS) provided advice and guidance regarding the radiological aspects of the guidelines.\n\nA critical appraisal of the guidelines using the AGREE II instrument was undertaken. All domains scored >70% [6].\n\nEvidence‐based and unambiguous recommendations were developed by the section authors. Each recommendation was submitted to the whole EGS Subcommittee. The Subcommittee cross‐reviewed each of the individual recommendations in order to ensure consistency of style, presentation and quality. They were refined. Voting was carried out on a five‐point Likert scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree, SA). Any statement scoring 1–3 on the Likert scale could have suggestions made with the intention to rephrase recommendations if specific objections were raised during the first round. Only those recommendations achieving 80% consensus at level 5 (SA) and level 4 (agree, A) after two rounds of voting have been included in the final guidelines.\n\nIn accordance with the EGS ACPGBI format, they have been published in a Question, Recommendation, Background format for maximal ease of use in the clinical sphere.\n\nRandomized controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews and meta‐analyses were included where available. Multi‐centre and single centre observational reviews were included if relevant. Case reports were excluded unless they provided the only published evidence in a particular area. This is made clear in the text.\n\nThis work does not therefore concentrate on future areas of research or ground‐breaking novel technologies but rather offers practical recommendations for the clinical management of these conditions.\n\nThe recommendations were then submitted to the ACPGBI patient liaison group. A patient summary was produced and is included.\n\nThe guidelines adhere to the published ACPGBI guidelines on consensus statements [7]. The level of evidence and grading for each recommendation [8] are listed in Tables and . These guidelines represent work ongoing from May 2019 to September 2020. They contain 122 recommendations. We hope that they will provide an updated and evidence‐based summary of the current surgical knowledge in the management of emergency colorectal surgery and as such will serve as a useful practical summary for clinicians undertaking emergency colorectal procedures.\n\nTABLE 1\n\nIEvidence obtained from a single randomized controlled trial or from a systematic review or meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trialsIIEvidence obtained from at least one well‐designed controlled study without randomization or at least one other well‐designed quasi‐experimental studyIIIEvidence obtained from well‐designed non‐experimental descriptive studies, correlation studies and case studiesIVEvidence obtained from expert committee reports or opinions and/or clinical experiences of respected authorities, or case reports\n\nTABLE 2\n\nAEvidence from Level I studies or consistent findings from evidence Levels IIA, IIB or IIIBEvidence from Level II or III studies and generally consistent findingsCEvidence from Level II or III studies but inconsistent findingsDLittle or no systematic evidenceGPRecommended good practice based on clinical experience of the expert group and other professionals\n\nDIVERTICULAR DISEASE\n\nIntroduction\n\nAn increase in the incidence and prevalence of diverticular disease has resulted in a rise in the overall number of emergency admissions for complications [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. In England, Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data analysis estimated an increased incidence of hospitalization (total inpatient and day‐case admissions) for diverticular disease from 0.56 to 1.2 per 1000 population/year from 1996 to 2006 [9]. In the USA an increase in incidence from 89.8 to 113.9 per 100 000 population was seen between 2006 and 2013 [10, 11]. The prevalence of diverticular disease increases with age and 85% of patients are over 50 [13, 15]. There is an increasing proportion of younger patients presenting with acute diverticulitis (AD) requiring surgery [9, 15, 17], although a theory that younger patients have more virulent or frequent episodes of disease has not been proven [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. In patients over 50 presenting with diverticulitis, most are women; the opposite is true in those under 50 [12, 15, 18, 19, 23].\n\nDiverticular disease is most prevalent in the Western world and is still relatively rare in Asia or Africa. A higher incidence in industrialized areas and in immigrants to Western countries implies lifestyle factors in the development of diverticulosis [27, 28, 29]. Whilst diverticula are more common overall in the left side of the colon, right‐sided diverticulosis is more likely to be seen in Asians [30, 31]. Low fibre diets—and their association with a relatively constipated high pressure colon—are implicated in the development of left‐sided diverticulosis [32, 33], but the role of diet remains unclear in AD; there is some evidence that vegetarians with high fibre diets have decreased admissions with AD [16, 34]. There is no evidence that consumption of corn, nuts or popcorn makes diverticulitis more likely [35].\n\nThe pathological mechanisms leading to diverticula formation remain unclear and a complex interaction between diet, gut microbiome, genetic factors, colonic motility and structure over time is likely [16, 36, 37]. Alterations in colonic muscle properties, collagen metabolism and in the interactions of the extracellular matrix components may play a role in remodelling of the gut wall in diverticular disease [33]. Collagen deposition in the colon wall of patients operated for sigmoid diverticulitis is higher compared to patients without the disease [38]. A number of rare hereditable disorders of collagen and elastin are associated with complicated diverticular disease at an early age [39, 40].\n\nAD is a common cause of acute abdominal pain [41]. Complicated AD refers to AD with abscess formation, perforation or fistula formation and there is a wide spectrum of symptoms that can arise [42]. Seasonal variation in admissions has been shown [43, 44, 45, 46] and lower socioeconomic status is also more likely to be associated with more frequent presentations and more severe disease [47].\n\nQuestion 1.1\n\nHow is complicated acute diverticulitis classified?\n\nRecommendation: Severity of acute diverticulitis should be classified according to a reproducible grading system such as the Modified Hinchey Classification.\n\nLevel of evidence: IV\n\nGrade of recommendation: D\n\nConsensus: 100% (SA 77.8%, A 22.2%)\n\nThe most useful classification is the Modified Hinchey Classification. This categorizes patients with AD into four major categories (I, II, III, IV) with two additional subcategories (a and b), depending on the severity of the disease (Table ). Initially intended for use intra‐operatively, it is a convenient and reproducible descriptor and allows comparison of treatment modalities across patient populations.\n\nTABLE 3\n\nStageDescriptionStage IaConfined pericolic inflammation—phlegmonStage IbConfined pericolic abscess (within sigmoid mesocolon)Stage IIaPelvic, distant intra‐abdominal or intraperitoneal abscess amenable to percutaneous drainageStage IIbComplex abscess associated with fistulaStage IIIGeneralized purulent peritonitisStage IVFaecal peritonitis\n\nThere are multiple other classification systems available for AD which include the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma, modified Neff, Ambrosetti, Kohler, Hansen/Stock, Siewart, Boostrom and the Cleveland Clinic diverticular disease propensity score [48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54], but they are in less common usage.\n\nQuestion 1.2\n\nWhich patients with acute diverticulitis can be managed on an ambulatory outpatient basis and which patients need hospital admission?\n\nRecommendation: Most patients with Hinchey Ia and Ib acute diverticulitis, and selected patients with Hinchey IIa acute diverticulitis, should be managed on an ambulatory basis if possible, provided that facilities for rapid review are in place; Hinchey IIb, III and IV patients will require admission.\n\nLevel of evidence: II\n\nGrade of recommendation: C\n\nConsensus: 88.9% (SA 66.7%, A 22.2%)\n\nInitial evaluation of a patient with suspected AD must include a problem‐specific history, physical examination and blood tests, including C‐reactive protein (CRP), to determine severity and prognosis. The diagnostic accuracy of clinical evaluation for AD is low but a symptom triad of left lower quadrant pain, fever and absence of vomiting is suggestive of AD [16, 42, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60]. Urinalysis and a pregnancy test may be helpful in excluding other diagnoses that can mimic the presentation of AD, such as urinary tract infections, ureteric calculi and ectopic pregnancy [61].\n\nLaboratory tests should include full blood count, renal function, amylase and CRP [16]. CRP can be used as an indicator of the presence of complications in AD: patients with CRP >150 mg/l have an increased risk of complicated AD [61, 62, 63, 64]; a CRP >200 mg/l is a strong indicator of perforation [58]. CRP has both diagnostic and prognostic value for patients with AD, and a CRP value higher than 150 mg/l is associated with an increased risk of postoperative mortality if surgery is undertaken [62]. Leucocytosis is also related to complicated AD and risk of surgical intervention [65, 66], but patients with fever and leucocytosis that resolve within the first 48 h of initiating treatment have improved outcomes [67].\n\nUncomplicated AD or Hinchey Stage I disease can almost universally be treated on an ambulatory outpatient basis, with a 6%–10% risk of readmission, very low rates of complications and an opportunity for substantial financial savings [68], but patient selection is key. For patients selected for ambulatory management, any imaged abscess should be <3 cm, there should be no signs of systemic sepsis, and patients should be able to tolerate oral intake and have an adequate social support [49, 69, 70, 71]. Risk factors for failure of outpatient management include CT findings of free fluid or extraluminal air, or more than two previous episodes of AD [69, 70]. Patients should be admitted if other risk factors are present such as age >65 years, significant comorbidities or immunosuppression [68, 72].\n\nQuestion 1.3\n\nWhat imaging should be used in acute diverticulitis?\n\nRecommendation: Contrast‐enhanced CT imaging should be undertaken in all suspected cases of acute diverticulitis in order to confirm the diagnosis, to assess severity and to plan therapy.\n\nLevel of evidence: I\n\nGrade of recommendation: B\n\nConsensus: 100% (SA 100%)\n\nPlain chest and abdominal radiographs may provide a diagnosis of perforation or bowel obstruction [9]. Superior diagnostic accuracy for AD is achieved with CT—or sometimes ultrasound (US) in expert hands [73]. CT and US have shown similar sensitivity and specificity for uncomplicated AD. However, although US avoids the risk associated with ionizing radiation [74, 75, 76, 77], CT is more universally recommended.\n\nSevere abdominal pain, obesity and obscuring bowel gas can preclude a satisfactory US examination and therefore the use of US is limited in complicated AD [8]. Missing a complicated diverticulitis can have important clinical implications and, if diverticulitis is suspected, a contrast‐enhanced CT scan to confirm diagnosis and exclude complications is recommended [78].\n\nThe diagnostic benefits of CT include easier identification of alternative diagnoses [79] assessment of the severity of AD and extent of AD‐associated extra‐colonic abnormalities. The latter include pericolic inflammation (phlegmon or fat stranding), abscess or extraluminal gas or contrast [55, 57, 79] or presence of obstruction, which is more likely to be associated with malignancy than with AD [80]. Historically water‐soluble contrast enema examination may be helpful in assessment of obstructed cases; however, it is inferior to CT in detecting complicated AD, particularly associated abscess, and has fallen out of use [51, 81]. CT is essential for therapeutic planning if abscess drainage is being considered [51, 75] and can be used to grade severity. MRI has high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing AD and is comparable to CT; however, availability and cost limits its use [82, 83].\n\nQuestion 1.4\n\nCan acute diverticulitis be managed non‐operatively?\n\nRecommendation: Antibiotics may be omitted in uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. Patients with complicated acute diverticulitis should be administered broad‐spectrum antibiotics and most can be treated non‐operatively, but regular clinical re‐evaluation must be undertaken to determine success or failure of treatment.\n\nLevel of evidence: I\n\nGrade of recommendation: A\n\nConsensus: 100% (SA 88.9%, A 11.1%)\n\nThere is no evidence mandating the use of routine antibiotics in uncomplicated AD. Conservative treatment strategy without antibiotics in patients with uncomplicated AD has proven to be safe, with long‐term outcomes, in terms of recurrence, complications and need for surgery, being similar to those treated with antibiotics [84, 85, 86, 87, 88]. However, CRP level >170 mg/l is a risk factor for non‐antibiotic treatment failure [89] and selective, rather than routine, omission of antibiotics is still recommended [90].\n\nThere is no evidence to support a particular antibiotic regime, route or duration for complicated AD. Antibiotics are indicated in all cases of complicated AD. If a drainage procedure is indicated, there is no evidence to support a prolonged course of antibiotics after source control is achieved.\n\nApproximately 20% of patients with AD will have complicated disease and the majority can be treated conservatively with antibiotics, including many cases with abscesses and pericolic extraluminal air [91, 92, 93, 94, 95]. Mesocolic abscesses (Modified Hinchey 1b) are more likely than pelvic or intra‐abdominal abscesses to respond to antibiotics alone [96, 97] and Hinchey II patients with abscesses smaller than 4 cm in size can also usually be treated with antibiotics alone. Simultaneous abscess and perforation occur in around 18% of patients and the presence of an abscess increases the risk of failure of non‐operative management. Isolated pericolic extraluminal gas—defined as free gas no more than 5 cm from the site of inflammation—is found in up to 15% of patients with complicated AD, and 6% of patients with isolated pericolic extraluminal air will need emergency surgery (ES) with a 2% 30‐day mortality rate. Even in patients with free gas, provided there is an absence of severe peritonitis or sepsis, up to one‐third can be successfully managed non‐operatively [66, 68, 93]. The decision to persist with non‐operative therapy in complicated AD must take into account the patient's physiological state, response to treatment through regular review and associated comorbidities [98].\n\nQuestion 1.5\n\nWhich patients with complicated acute diverticulitis can be treated by percutaneous drainage?\n\nRecommendation: Pelvic abscesses should be assessed by an experienced interventional radiologist and drained percutaneously if a safe route into the abscess can be negotiated.\n\nLevel of evidence: I\n\nGrade of recommendation: B\n\nConsensus: 100% (SA 66.7%, A 33.3%)\n\nWhen technically feasible, patients with abscesses larger than 4 cm should be managed with imaging guided percutaneous drainage and systemic antibiotic therapy. When percutaneous drainage is technically difficult or hazardous in Hinchey II AD, antibiotic therapy alone may be necessary. Reported failure rates for percutaneous diverticular abscess drainage range from 15% to 30%. Drainage is considered a failure if signs of persistent sepsis develop, abscess or fistula recurs within 4 weeks of drainage, or when emergency surgical resection has to be performed. ES for Hinchey II AD is associated with an 80% colostomy rate and high mortality rate and so percutaneous drainage should be pursued if at all possible [96, 97, 99]. The commonest routes for percutaneous drainage are transabdominal and transgluteal [100, 101, 102], and imaging before percutaneous drain removal is associated with a reduction in the rates of abscess recurrence and requirement for additional drainage procedures or surgery [103].\n\nThe current DAMASCUS study aims to determine the international variability in the presentation and index management of AD.\n\nLink: DAMASCUS study\n\nQuestion 1.6\n\nWhat follow‐up should patients undergo after successful non‐operative management of acute diverticulitis?\n\nRecommendation: There is no requirement for routine colonoscopic or radiological follow‐up of patients who have recovered from conservatively managed acute uncomplicated acute diverticulitis, unless there are suspicious features on CT scans or other risk factors for malignancy coexist.\n\nLevel of evidence: II\n\nGrade of recommendation: B\n\nConsensus: 100% (SA 77.8%, A 22.2%)\n\nRecommendation: Following recovery from an attack of complicated acute diverticulitis, the colon should be imaged after a delay of 6 weeks by either optical or virtual colonoscopy, unless imaging has already taken place within the preceding 2 years.\n\nLevel of evidence: I\n\nGrade of recommendation: B\n\nConsensus: 100% (SA 77.8%, A 22.2%)\n\nAlthough there are specific US and CT criteria which help to differentiate AD from colon cancer, for decades the management of AD has included early endoscopic evaluation to exclude malignancy, as it has been shown that there is an age‐related increase in the prevalence of colonic neoplasia in patients with diverticular disease [80, 104, 105, 106]. The incidence of colonic neoplasia is low in uncomplicated AD, between 1.6% and 1.9%; therefore routine interval colonoscopy may be unnecessary in this group, unless there is clinical suspicion of malignancy. The incidence of colonic neoplasia is higher in complicated AD, between 7.8% and 10.9%, and so interval colonoscopy remains mandatory following an episode of complicated AD [107, 108]. Other indications for endoscopy include age over 50 years, rectal bleeding or concerning features on imaging, if not done previously [93, 105, 108]. The absence of diverticulae in combination with shouldering at either end of an area of stricturing has 0.91 and 0.95 sensitivity and specificity for colonic cancer [109]\n\nThere is no indication for routine outpatient follow‐up of patients who have recovered from conservatively managed acute uncomplicated or complicated AD. Following successful non‐operative management of AD, the proportion of patients having at least one subsequent readmission is between 8% and 21% and the risk of readmission decreases with time. Of those patients who are readmitted, approximately 22% will subsequently undergo surgery [110, 111].\n\nQuestion 1.7\n\nWhat advice should be given to patients after hospital admission for acute diverticulitis?\n\nRecommendation: Obese patients should be strongly advised to lose weight. All patients should be advised to increase physical activity and improve diet quality, whilst avoiding smoking and non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\n\nLevel of evidence: II\n\nGrade of recommendation: B\n\nConsensus: 100% (SA 66.7%, A 33.3%)\n\nHigher body mass index (BMI) and larger waist circumference and waist‐to‐hip ratio significantly increase the risks of diverticulitis and diverticular bleeding [112, 113]. Morbidly obese patients, BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2, undergoing surgery for diverticulitis are nearly 10 years younger than normal weight patients and are more likely to require ES, ostomy creation and open surgery and to undergo procedures without an anastomosis. They also tend to have a more pronounced systemic inflammatory response [114], the pathophysiology being poorly understood but possibly due to high levels of circulating inflammatory mediators associated with increased lipid metabolism [115, 116]. Physical activity of greater than 30 min/day and particularly running significantly decrease the risk of complicated diverticulitis [113, 117]. Although the mechanisms are not fully understood, long‐term physical activity decreases intra‐colonic pressure and colonic transit time, and results in alterations to intestinal autonomic activity, gut hormone secretion, microbiome and immune function [117, 118, 119]. Smoking is associated with an increased risk of complications in patients with diverticular disease [119, 120, 121, 122, 123]. Use of aspirin or NSAIDs increases the risk of diverticulitis and diverticular bleeding [16, 124, 125]. NSAIDs—but not aspirin—are strongly associated with an increased risk of diverticular perforation [126]. Impaired prostaglandin synthesis compromises mucosal integrity, increases permeability and allows bacterial translocation, which promotes inflammation [125]. Diverticulitis is defined by the presence of micro‐ or macro‐perforation leading to abscess formation, and is believed to be the result of an impaired mucosal barrier and increased intra‐colonic pressure [119]. Use of opiates or corticosteroids increases the risk of diverticular perforation [127] with opiates slowing colonic transit and increasing intra‐colonic pressure which contributes to the increased risk of perforation [128]. Statins have been shown to reduce the risk of complicated diverticulitis and perforation [127, 129], but there is conflicting evidence as to whether calcium channel blockers also reduce the risk of perforation [119, 127, 128].\n\nTreatment with mesalazine, rifaximin or probiotics has not been found to prevent recurrent episodes of diverticulitis or even control persistent symptoms after an episode of AD [130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136]. An increase in dietary fibre or supplemental fibre is widely accepted to be of benefit for general health and should be recommended, but there is little evidence that it reduces current symptoms or recurrence of symptoms. Patients should be provided with written advice on discharge.\n\nQuestion 1.8\n\nWhich patients with acute diverticulitis should be considered for laparoscopic lavage?\n\nRecommendation: Laparoscopic lavage is currently not recommended for treatment of complicated acute diverticulitis but may be an acceptable alternative to avoid major resection in high risk patients provided its limitations are communicated to patients.\n\nLevel of evidence: I\n\nGrade of recommendation: A\n\nConsensus: 100% (SA 55.6%, A 44.4%)\n\nPerforation associated with AD represents 75% of diverticular emergencies requiring surgery [137]. Complementary to estimates of inflammatory parameters and CT findings, good decision‐making and clinical judgement determine the need for surgery, depending upon the patient's clinical status, comorbidities, immunosuppression, signs of peritonitis and sepsis [93, 138].\n\nThe optimal management of Hinchey III AD has been the focus of much debate. Studies of laparoscopic lavage (LL) in Hinchey III AD without visible perforation have shown that LL is a safe alternative to resection but in these studies patients with high American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score were excluded. Patients undergoing LL tend to be younger and have a higher BMI. Patient factors that would contraindicate LL include shock, need for inotropic support and immunosuppression. Findings at operation that preclude LL are persistent perforation—actively sought by underwater air distention test—or faecal peritonitis.\n\nOutcomes from studies show a three times greater chance of ongoing intraperitoneal sepsis with LL than with open resectional surgery, with significantly increased rates of postoperative intra‐abdominal abscess and higher reintervention rate, including emergency reoperations. Morbidity and mortality are not significantly different between LL and open surgery. LL has a significantly shorter operating time, fewer stomas, fewer postoperative cardiac and wound complications and a shorter length of hospital stay [136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148]. Published studies have made no attempt to standardize the surgical technique for LL but, after laparoscopic confirmation of Hinchey III AD, variable amounts of fluid were used to perform the lavage (mean 15 L), active searching for diverticular perforation was variable and there was no surgical credentialling or specialization [149, 150]. Limitations of LL include the risk of missing a persistent perforation (30%), faecal peritonitis enclosed within a sigmoid loop (10%) and overlooking a sigmoid cancer (10%) [151].\n\nQuestion 1.9\n\nWhich patients should undergo emergency sigmoid resection for acute diverticulitis?\n\nRecommendation: Patients who have failed conservative management or those with frank perforation or large bowel obstruction should undergo emergency sigmoid resection for acute diverticulitis.\n\nLevel of evidence: IV\n\nGrade of recommendation: GP\n\nConsensus: 100% (SA 55.6%, A 44.4%)\n\nHartmann's procedure (HP) or primary anastomosis with or without diverting ileostomy are the two surgical techniques used in patients undergoing ES for perforated AD, HP being performed most often [152, 153]. Surgeon and patient factors influence the type of operation performed. Surgeon‐specific factors include colorectal sub‐specialization, with non‐colorectal surgeons more likely to perform HP. Patients undergoing HP tend to be older, have higher Charlson Comorbidity Index and ASA scores and are more likely to be immunosuppressed [154, 155, 156]. Primary anastomosis can be performed in haemodynamically stable and immunocompetent patients with Hinchey III or IV [157, 158, 159, 160]. Recent studies and meta‐analysis have shown significantly lower overall mortality in patients with primary anastomosis compared with HP. Surgical site infection (SSI) rates, reoperation and stoma non‐reversal rates are significantly lower in primary anastomosis, but at the expense of a longer mean operating time for primary anastomosis compared with HP [161, 162, 163, 164, 165].\n\nPrimary anastomosis without diverting ileostomy may be preferred under suitable conditions in order to avoid the potential difficulties associated with a column of colonic stool when contemplating ileostomy reversal, and in 27% of those patients assigned to primary anastomosis in the LADIES trial no stoma was constructed [157]. There is no consensus on the value of antegrade colonic lavage under these circumstances but, provided care is undertaken to avoid spillage and colonic mobilization is undertaken when necessary, there may be some advantages.\n\nEvidence to support or refute the safety and effectiveness of a laparoscopic vs. open approach in complicated AD is insufficient and laparoscopic surgery should only be undertaken by suitably trained surgeons. The operating time is longer than open surgical resection, although laparoscopic surgery may improve postoperative pain control and reduce the duration of paralytic ileus.\n\nLaparoscopic and open surgery have comparable postoperative mortality, morbidity and reoperations due to anastomotic leakage [144, 151, 166, 167].\n\nThe use of a damage control strategy involving resection without anastomosis, temporary abdominal closure (TAC), planned re‐look and delayed stoma formation—or even delayed anastomosis—should be considered in the septic unwell patient at initial laparotomy [168, 169, 170, 171]. Fully informed consent is essential, particularly in those patients in whom a primary anastomosis is considered a viable option [156].\n\nQuestion 1.10\n\nWhat are the essential operative steps for sigmoid resection in complicated diverticular disease?\n\nRecommendation: Resection of acutely inflamed and perforated bowel should be undertaken, avoiding damage to adjacent structures and minimizing tension on an anastomosis or colostomy by selective mobilization of the splenic flexure. Primary anastomosis with or without diverting ileostomy should be considered by suitably trained surgeons under favourable conditions.\n\nLevel of evidence: IV\n\nGrade of recommendation: GP\n\nConsensus 100% (SA 66.6%, A 44.4%)\n\nThere are no studies evaluating the extent of sigmoid resection in the emergency setting, but limiting the resection to the segment that is acutely affected without compromising blood supply of the remnant bowel is sensible for HP. If a primary anastomosis is undertaken, the distal resection level should be at the top of the rectum and the proximal resection level at a point where there are no or minimal diverticula in order to try to minimize anastomotic events. Mobilization of the splenic flexure may be necessary selectively in order to ensure reduced tension on a colorectal anastomosis or an end colostomy, but it does risk spread of contamination in Hinchey III and IV patients. Mesenteric division close to the bowel wall is likely to decrease the risk of ureteric injury, particularly in the presence of an inflammatory mass, at the expense of potentially troublesome bleeding. If a sigmoid cancer is suspected, oncological resection with higher ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery/superior rectal artery and dissection in a mesocolic/mesorectal plane should be undertaken if possible.\n\nThere are no studies giving guidance on the management of the rectal stump in the emergency setting, but division of healthy lower sigmoid or rectum below the affected segment is likely to be associated with a lower risk of stump closure dehiscence. Rectal stump washout may be performed in order to try and minimize the effect of rectal stump dehiscence. The length of the remaining rectum and its suitability for future reversal are useful to record in the operation note.\n\nWhilst rectal catheters are in widespread use, there are no studies demonstrating specific benefit. Similarly, there is no evidence to support the use of abdominal drains following surgery for perforated diverticulitis.\n\nCOLORECTAL CANCER\n\nIntroduction\n\nColorectal cancer presents as an emergency in 20% of cases in the UK. Emergency presentation is associated with a poorer outcome, high levels of morbidity, mortality and reduced overall survival. This may be explained partly by the association of emergency presentation with increasing age, lower socioeconomic status, increased comorbidity, higher stage of disease and lower rates of treatment with curative intent: 52% for emergency presentation, compared with 69% and 86% referred from general practitioner (GP) and screening services respectively [172]. Perioperative mortality for ES continues to reduce in European countries [172, 173]. However, in the UK, 90‐day mortality following ES for colorectal cancer is nearly six times greater than that of elective surgery (11.5% vs. 2.0%). Consequently, optimization of treatment strategies for these patients is a priority to improve clinical outcomes [161]. The National Health Service (NHS) long‐term plan states that one of its priorities for the next 10 years is diagnosis of Stage I and II disease for 75% of cancer patients. If this is achieved, it would reduce the rate of emergency presentation of colorectal cancer [174].\n\nEmergency presentation can occur as the initial event leading to diagnosis, but may also occur during the course of the disease, as a consequence of its treatment or as a terminal event at the end of life. These recommendations will focus on the most common de novo emergency presentations of colorectal cancer which are with obstruction (up to 80%), perforation (up to 20%) and, less commonly, acute lower GI bleeding (ALGIB).\n\nLarge bowel obstruction\n\nQuestion 2.1\n\nWhat is the optimum imaging modality for patients presenting with signs and symptoms of malignant large bowel obstruction?\n\nRecommendation: To diagnose malignant large bowel obstruction a contrast‐enhanced CT scan is the imaging modality of choice. A plain abdominal radiograph is unnecessary.\n\nLevel of evidence: III\n\nGrade of recommendation: B\n\nConsensus: 100% (SA 77.8%, A 22.2%)\n\nThe sensitivity and specificity of abdomino‐pelvic contrast‐enhanced CT scan in the diagnosis of large bowel obstruction is high (sensitivity 96%, specificity 93%) and it outperforms other imaging modalities including US scan and plain abdominal radiography [175]. Performing a plain abdominal radiograph may delay time to CT and a definitive diagnosis. A CT provides effective local and distant staging information to inform treatment decisions [175, 176, 177, 178]. When CT is equivocal about the cause of obstruction, endoscopic assessment may be helpful.\n\nIn a stable patient, endoscopic evaluation can confirm a radiological diagnosis, define the aetiology when CT is inconclusive, provide tissue biopsies for histological assessment and be used for combined endoscopic/fluoroscopic placement of a stent for obstruction. However, use of endoscopy is not mandatory where the diagnosis is not in doubt and surgical treatment is planned.\n\nThe role of self‐expanding metal stents (SEMSs)\n\nQuestion 2.2\n\nWhat are the indications and contraindications for self‐expanding metal stents?\n\nRecommendation: Self‐expanding metal stents can be used for the treatment of malignant large bowel obstruction as either a definitive procedure for palliation or as a bridge to surgery.\n\nLevel of evidence: I\n\nGrade of recommendation: A\n\nConsensus: 100% (SA 88.9%, A 11.1%)\n\nRecommendation: Self‐expanding metal stents should definitely not be used in the presence of perforation, peritonitis or systemic toxicity and low rectal lesions. Self‐expanding metal stents are relatively contraindicated when the patient is taking anti‐angiogenic chemotherapy and for benign causes of large bowel obstruction.\n\nLevel of evidence: III\n\nGrade of recommendation: C\n\nConsensus: 100% (SA 77.8%, A 22.2%)\n\nNational guidelines concur that the SEMS is the treatment of choice for malignant large bowel obstruction (MLBO) in the palliative setting due to its reduction in stoma rates, hospital length of stay, inpatient mortality and intensive care unit admission rates, and time to chemotherapy [177, 179, 180].\n\nThe use of SEMSs as a bridge to surgery (BTS) has short‐term benefits. It can downgrade the emergency situation by relieving obstruction, enabling medical optimization of the patient, and giving time for staging and planning of definitive treatment. This enables an early planned resection with higher rates of primary anastomosis, lower rates of stoma formation, increased use of laparoscopic techniques and reduced morbidity and mortality [181, 182, 183].\n\nThe use of SEMSs in the presence of perforation or peritonitis is contraindicated [177]. SEMSs in patients who would benefit from anti‐angiogenic therapy (e.g., bevacizumab) are relatively contraindicated, due to the higher rates of perforation seen in this group, although the evidence for this is debated [184, 185, 186]. There does not appear to be an increased risk of SEMS‐related perforation with other newer chemotherapeutic agents such as cetuximab [187].\n\nSEMSs can be used in patients with MLBO due to extraluminal malignant disease and peritoneal carcinomatosis but with lower success rates [188, 189, 190], increased technical difficulty [189], reduced patency rates [191] and increased complication rates [192]. SEMSs are being used more frequently in benign causes of obstruction, in particular in benign strictures; however, this is associated with increased complication rates and lower clinical success rates [193]. In addition, the use of stents to cover anastomotic leaks and fistulas is increasing and a meta‐analysis of small retrospective cases series by Arezzo et al. showed a short‐term success rate of 73% but a longer‐term success rate of only 57% with complications occurring in 41.5% [194].\n\nQuestion 2.3\n\nAre self‐expanding metal stents as a bridge to surgery for malignant large bowel obstruction oncologically safe for patients?\n\nRecommendation: Self‐expanding metal stents appear to be as oncologically safe as emergency surgery. The 3‐ and 5‐year loco‐regional recurrence rates, disease‐free survival rates and overall survival rates are comparable for these two groups of patients on the basis of current data. However, there is a risk of perforation and perforated cancers are at a higher risk of local recurrence. A fully informed consent process is mandatory.\n\nLevel of evidence: I\n\nGrade of recommendation: A\n\nConsensus: 100% (SA 77.8%, A 22.2%)\n\nConcerns about tumour cell dissemination and perforation by stent insertion as possible contributors to recurrence and poorer survival have led to doubts regarding this technique as a panacea for all cases of MLBO. Early studies showed an increase in local recurrence in patients receiving a SEMS as a BTS [195] and early termination of several RCTs because of increased morbidity in the stented arms [196, 197, 198] and subsequent poorer oncological outcomes in those experiencing SEMS‐related perforations reinforced these concerns [199]. These concerns have meant that SEMSs have largely been used for patients with metastatic disease or serious comorbidities precluding surgical resection. National guidelines have not recommended their routine use, reserving it as an option for those with metastatic disease or at high risk of mortality from ES [179]. More recent American and UK guidelines recommend SEMSs as a BTS on an individualized patient basis, but there is significant variation in international guidance on this issue [200] which will continue to change with evolution and maturation of the data.\n\nAccumulating evidence and increased experience with the SEMS technique has shown more reassuring oncological outcome data. A recent meta‐analysis of RCTs examining SEMSs compared with ES found a higher risk of overall cancer recurrence in the SEMS as a BTS group (37% vs. 25.9%), but no difference in 3‐year disease‐free and overall survival [201]. Equivalent 5‐year oncological outcomes have been shown in a retrospective cohort study [202] and two systematic reviews [182, 203]. The Dutch Colorectal Audit showed equivalent 3‐year oncological results between patients with left‐sided colonic obstruction undergoing ES or SEMS as a BTS. However, the 17 patients who experienced SEMS‐related perforations had non‐statistically significant higher recurrence rates (18.0% and 11.0%, P = 0.432) and poorer 3‐year disease‐free (49% and 59.6%, P = 0.717) and overall survival (61% and 75.1%, P = 0.529) [183].\n\nThe early poorer oncological results seen may have been due to inexperience with the technique and in particular the use of balloon dilatation, which is not recommended [204]. Increasing expertise and familiarity with SEMSs has led to increased success rates with lower perforation rates which is likely to be crucial to the improvement in oncological outcomes seen.\n\nQuestion 2.4\n\nWhat is the expected success rate for a self‐expanding metal stent?\n\nRecommendation: Units should be aiming for a clinical and radiological success rate of the order of 90%. All units should audit their figures and include complications.\n\nLevel of evidence: I\n\nGrade of recommendation: A\n\nConsensus: 100% (SA 88.9%, A 11.1%)\n\nThe use of SEMSs has increased due to the lower morbidity associated with endoscopic intervention compared with ES. The short‐term success rates in large prospective trials are good, with technical and clinical success rates in excess of 90% [184, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209]. Although some studies report somewhat lower clinical success rates, these still remain greater than 80% [210, 211, 212]. In addition, success rates for SEMSs tend to be higher in those stented as a BTS rather than for palliation [191, 207]. Real‐world data are probably reflected better in national audit data rather than clinical trials and they tend to be lower than those seen in the trials. The Dutch Colorectal Audit includes 222 stented patients and reports technical success rates of 194 of 222 (87.4%) and clinical success rates of 177 of 222 (79.7%) [183].\n\nOverall complication rates for SEMS placement are up to 35% including early short‐term and later longer‐term complications. The main complications include perforation (0%–12%), failure to stent, stent migration and re‐obstruction. Reintervention rates after SEMSs can be up to 20%. Less frequent complications include pain, bleeding, tenesmus (particularly for rectal SEMSs), fistula, late perforation, incontinence and fever [212].\n\nPerforation by SEMSs can take several forms. It may be clinically overt, guide‐wire‐related, silent, or due to micro‐perforation. An overt perforation results in symptoms and leads to a subsequent decision to proceed to ES or palliative care. Guide‐wire‐related perforations are radiologically detectable but may be clinically asymptomatic and are usually managed conservatively. At surgery, a clinically occult SEMS perforation may be seen, or later picked up by the pathologist on examination of the resected specimen. Perforation rates are higher if a stricture is pre‐dilated and this practice is not recommended. In the Dutch Colorectal Audit, the overall SEMS perforation rate was 7.7% [183]. Given the possible detrimental effect on oncological outcomes, it is essential that the SEMS‐related perforation rate is low and this is related to operator experience. The perforation rate should be audited at an institutional level. In the UK, the Joint Advisory Group for Endoscopy have set a key performance indicator for perforation following SEMS placement of <10% and an aspirational target of <5% [213]. High perforation rates in the early trials led to their premature termination [196]. The perforation rate in the more recently published prospective trial is much lower, between 1.6% and 5%, probably reflecting increased expertise [207, 209, 211, 214, 215, 216].\n\nFor palliative patients, re‐obstruction becomes a significant risk but can often be managed by further stent placement [217].\n\nQuestion 2.5\n\nIs a self‐expanding metal stent the treatment of choice for malignant large bowel obstruction in patients with irresectable primary and/or metastatic disease?\n\nRecommendation: A self‐expanding metal stent should be the treatment of choice for patients with irresectable primary and/or metastatic disease and malignant large bowel obstruction as it is associated with better quality of life, shorter hospital stay and lower stoma rates compared with palliative surgery.\n\nLevel of evidence: I\n\nGrade of recommendation: A\n\nConsensus: 100% (SA 66.7%, A 33.3%)\n\nA 2011 Cochrane review found higher clinical success rates in patients undergoing ES compared with SEMSs for MLBO [218]. The clinical success rates at relieving obstruction do still seem to be better with palliative surgery in comparison with SEMSs (96% vs. 86.1%, P = 0.02) [217]. However, since 2011, further studies have shown a significant benefit with SEMSs in terms of quality of life, reduction in stoma rates, length of hospital stay, lower intensive care unit admission rates and shorter time to commencement of chemotherapy albeit with conflicting effects on morbidity and mortality compared with palliative surgery [217, 219, 220]. SEMSs have become the treatment of choice for palliation, when local expertise exists, for left‐sided MLBO, and this is incorporated into several clinical guidelines [177, 179, 180, 221, 222]. Proximal colonic stenting is technically more challenging and the recommendations have differed between guidelines and will depend on the local expertise in performing SEMSs. The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS) guidelines now recommend considering SEMSs as a palliative treatment for right‐sided MLBO [180]. SEMSs have definite favourable short‐term outcomes compared with ES in the palliative setting. As a palliative measure, SEMSs should be considered the first line of treatment.\n\nQuestion 2.6\n\nWhen should self‐expanding metal stents be used as a bridge to surgery in symptomatic malignant large bowel obstruction for potentially curable disease?\n\nRecommendation: There is good evidence to support the use of self‐expanding metal stents as a bridge to surgery in malignant large bowel obstruction (distal to the splenic flexure) prior to definitive surgical intervention, particularly in high risk patients. There should be a discussion with patients about the role of self‐expanding metal stents as an alternative to emergency surgery and the risks and benefits highlighted for both approaches.\n\nLevel of evidence: I\n\nGrade of recommendation: A\n\nConsensus: 100% (SA 100%)\n\nRecommendation: Self‐expanding metal stents as a bridge to surgery can be used in right‐sided malignant large bowel obstruction, although this may have more limited application in practice. The use of self‐expanding metal stents in curable rectal cancers within 5 cm of the dentate line is not recommended.\n\nLevel of evidence: III\n\nGrade of recommendation: C\n\nConsensus: 100% (SA 100%)\n\nThe choice between SEMSs as a BTS or ES is finely balanced and must involve open discussion and shared decision‐making between the surgeon and patient. This process should balance individual surgical risk with the relatively immature data on long‐term oncological outcome (discussed above). Even in an average surgical risk patient, of ASA I or II, ES still has higher rates of morbidity and mortality and anastomotic leak rates than elective surgery and postoperative complications can negatively affect oncological outcomes. The choice of SEMSs as a BTS or ES is an individualized decision and should be accompanied by a detailed documentation of individual surgical risk and the consent discussion. International guidance is highly variable in its recommendations of whether SEMSs should be used as a BTS [200] with current UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance recommending that SEMSs as a BTS should be discussed with patients as an equivalent alternative to ES [177].\n\nMeta‐analyses have shown that SEMSs as a BTS are associated with lower morbidity rates than ES [201, 223, 224], lower stoma rates and increased rates of primary anastomosis [182, 223] and similar mortality rates [201, 223]. Most studies have concentrated on left‐sided MLBO, but similar results have been shown in cohort studies including proximal colonic malignancy [206, 208, 209]. Right‐sided tumours made up between 7.8% and 23.2% in these cohorts [207, 208, 209] and these authors support the use of SEMSs as a BTS in both left‐sided and more proximal tumours. Current UK [177] and European guidance [179] does not support the use of SEMSs as a BTS for right‐sided colonic lesions although the American guidance does [180]. A systematic review focusing on right‐sided MLBO and SEMSs as a BTS has shown much lower morbidity and mortality in the BTS group but with the caveat that the 14 studies included were all cohorts and mainly retrospective [225].\n\nSEMSs have been used in published case series for obstructing rectal malignancy; however, in the majority of cases this has been as a palliative measure and not as a BTS. The use of SEMSs in rectal cancer appears to be less successful than for left‐sided cancers [215]. In addition, the rectum tends not to be well defined in studies examining the use of SEMSs, with one study defining the stented rectum as being greater than 5 cm from the verge but with no definition of the proximal extent [192]. In general, SEMSs should not be placed within 5 cm of the dentate line because of the risk of stent‐related symptoms of tenesmus, pain and incontinence. The more recent larger prospective Eastern studies have included SEMSs as a BTS in rectal cancer; however, the overall numbers are quite small (Saito et al. [n = 11], Tomita et al. [n = 13]) [208, 209] and there is insufficient data from these papers regarding the location within the rectum at which the SEMS was used. At present there is not sufficient evidence to support the use of SEMSs as a BTS in obstructing rectal cancers. In a palliative setting, SEMSs may be suitable in selected obstructing upper rectal cancers, albeit with lower success rates and higher complication rates than left‐sided SEMSs.\n\nQuestion 2.7\n\nWhen is the optimal time for resectional surgery after using a self‐expanding metal stent as a bridge to surgery?\n\nRecommendation: In the absence of strong evidence, it seems sensible that resectional surgery should be scheduled immediately following medical optimization of the patient's clinical conditions, full radiological staging of disease and multidisciplinary team discussion.\n\nLevel of evidence: IV\n\nGrade of recommendation: D\n\nConsensus: 100% (SA 66.7%, A 33.3%)\n\nThe European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guidelines recommend operating within 5–10 days of SEMS placement [179], but the evidence to support this interval is weak. Broholm et al. [226] found an increased risk of recurrence associated with a longer wait to surgery in 112 SEMS patients (range of time to surgery 0–165 days, median 18 days), of whom 18% required ES due to SEMS‐related complications of migration and perforation. The larger prospective studies have relatively short durations of 1–3 weeks from stenting to surgery [201, 208, 209].\n\nQuestion 2.8\n\nShould covered or uncovered self‐expanding metal stents be used?\n\nRecommendation: Uncovered stents should be used in the bridge to surgery setting as they are less likely to migrate. In the palliative setting, participation in a clinical trial to determine the optimal stent design should be considered.\n\nLevel of evidence: III\n\nGrade of recommendation: B\n\nConsensus: 100 (SA 100%)\n\nBoth covered and uncovered stents have been used for SEMSs; however, the majority of studies have used uncovered stents. There is no difference in the technical and clinical success or patency rate between the two [227]. The main type of stent used is the Wallflex, an uncovered flared stent with both through the scope and over the wire delivery systems. The other commonly used stent is the Niti‐S, which is an uncovered, non‐flared stent. Covered stents are associated with higher stent migration rates in retrospective case series [228, 229]. Covered stents can be either fully covered or partially covered; however, even partially covered stents are associated with migration in retrospective case series [230]. The higher stent migration rate seen with covered stents is thought to be due to less tumour ingrowth which can provide anchoring. The larger prospective trials to date have used uncovered stents [206, 207, 209].\n\nThe ESGE guidelines do not recommend one type of stent over another [179]. However, the earlier American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guidelines recommend the use of uncovered stents [231] this may simply be a reflection of the fact that the majority of the stents available in the US market at the time were uncovered [232].\n\nFor palliative stenting, where the stent is likely to be in situ for a longer duration and ingrowth of tumour a significant risk, consideration should be given to the use of a covered stent. However, the evidence supporting the use of one stent design over another is weak. The ongoing CReST2 study aims to answer the question of whether covered or uncovered stents are preferable in the palliative setting.\n\nLink: CREST2 study\n\nSurgical decision‐making\n\nQuestion 2.9\n\nWhat are the surgical options for malignant large bowel obstruction?\n\nRecommendation: The choice of surgical procedure should be guided by the physiological condition of the patient, the site of obstruction and the state of the proximal colon. For proximal colonic obstruction (up to the distal transverse colon), resection and primary anastomosis is preferred, but in a patient with markedly deranged physiology, resection, mucus fistula and end ileostomy is sensible. For left‐sided obstruction (from the distal transverse colon), in a patient with stable physiology a resection and primary anastomosis is preferable. Worsening clinical condition and comorbidity dictates resection with an end colostomy.\n\nLevel of evidence: III\n\nGrade of recommendation: B\n\nConsensus: 100% (SA 88.9%, A 11.1%)\n\nRecommendation: Where patient physiology is markedly deranged and significant comorbidities exist, a proximal defunctioning loop stoma alone is reasonable to allow medical optimization prior to elective resection. Obstructing rectal cancer is best managed with a proximal loop colostomy to allow full radiological staging and neoadjuvant treatment if required.\n\nLevel of evidence: III\n\nGrade of recommendation: C\n\nConsensus: 100% (SA 66.7%, A 33.3%)\n\nFor stable patients with a proximal colonic obstruction and low surgical risk, it is a reasonable and safe option to perform a resection and primary anastomosis [233, 234, 235, 236]. There are a number of anastomotic variations including handsewn or stapled techniques and different methods of constructing stapled anastomoses. The European Society of Coloproctology (ESCP) right hemicolectomy audit of 3208 patients reported a slightly increased anastomotic leak rate from stapled anastomoses after adjustment for cofactors (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.04–1.95, P = 0.03) [237] but no difference in the leak rate between different types of stapled anastomotic configurations [238]. However, the anastomotic leak rate for right colonic resection in ES is not insignificant [239, 240] with a rate of 14.3% reported in the recent ESCP right hemicolectomy snapshot audit [237]. In this audit, 19.5% of patients undergoing emergency right hemicolectomy did not have a primary anastomosis. Frago et al. reported an overall anastomotic leak rate of 16.4% in 377 emergency colectomies for obstruction, with proximal anastomoses more likely to leak than distal [241]. A large national Japanese database reported a much lower anastomotic leak rate (1.7%) but a higher rate of adverse outcomes with ES [242]. Amelung et al. in a retrospective study examined three treatment modalities for obstructing proximal tumours [224]. The majority of patients were treated with emergency resection (compared with stoma or SEMS). For the 85.6% of emergency resections with primary anastomosis, the leak rate was 7.4%. Tan and Sim have identified advanced age, ASA Grades III–IV and preoperative renal impairment as factors associated with worse perioperative outcome in obstructed colorectal malignancy, albeit in a solely Asian population [233]. Consequently, in patients with poor surgical risk or at higher risk of anastomotic leak, it is reasonable not to perform a primary anastomosis and to consider resection and ileostomy [224]. There has been one meta‐analysis of laparoscopic vs. open approach for obstructing right‐sided cancers [243]; however, only five studies were included with small numbers overall and anastomotic leak rate was not reported in some of the studies which limits the interpretation of the data.\n\nFor obstructing left‐sided cancer, there are multiple surgical options, the appropriate approach again depending largely on the physiological and comorbid status of the patient. A Cochrane review in 2004 addressing primary or staged resections found the evidence at the time was too weak to determine the best surgical management strategy [244]. Potential surgical options for obstructing left‐sided cancers include resection and primary anastomosis with or without a covering stoma, HP or defunctioning stoma alone. Breitenstein et al. [245] in a large meta‐analysis showed no benefit from two‐ or three‐stage resection vs. one‐stage resection. Staged procedures do inevitably result in longer overall hospital stays and the reversal rate for HP in colon cancer is low at 20% [246]. Resection and primary anastomosis is a safe technique which has been used for many years and should be the preferred option if the patient’s clinical condition allows [247, 248] and can also be used safely in selected elderly patients [249]. Where possible, a segmental resection is preferred over a subtotal colectomy because of better functional results [250] although some authors show no difference in outcomes between segmental resection, HP or subtotal colectomy [251]. Subtotal colectomy can be reserved for cases of proximal colonic damage from distal obstruction or synchronous tumours and, when employed, a minimal amount of distal ileum should be resected. Anastomotic leak rates vary in retrospective case series between 2.2% and 12% [222, 246, 252, 253, 254]. Subtotal colectomy may have a lower anastomotic leak rate than segmental colectomy [255]. Individual risk stratification in terms of predicting risk of anastomotic leak and outcome is crucial for safe surgical decision‐making.\n\nStaged resections should be considered for obstructing rectal cancers, when a diverting stoma or SEMS placement (where appropriate) allows time for accurate local staging and consideration of neoadjuvant therapies [256]. Where SEMSs are not appropriate and a defunctioning stoma is performed as a BTS in rectal cancers, a right‐sided transverse loop colostomy should be considered, as it is unlikely to interfere with the subsequent surgical approach [222, 257], unless a definitive abdominoperineal excision of the rectum can be predicted, when a left‐sided colostomy should be formed. A loop stoma is preferred to allow venting of the distal limb [256]. A defunctioning stoma as a BTS is an option for some patients instead of using a SEMS [258, 259, 260]. Patient preference and uncertainty of the long‐term oncological results of SEMSs due to immaturity of the data make this a valid surgical option after discussion of the risks and benefits of the different management strategies with the patient. In general, however, this option is likely to be reserved for those who would benefit from optimization prior to semi‐elective surgery or for those where SEMSs have failed or are not available due to local resources.\n\nRetrospective studies have reported on‐table lavage to be safe in obstructed colorectal cancers; however, it also prolongs the surgery and does not appear to confer any specific advantage over decompression alone [261, 262]. On‐table lavage is at the discretion of the operating surgeon as it does not increase the morbidity or mortality rate. However, there have been no RCTs to date showing a benefit in the emergency situation over manual decompression alone [263].\n\nQuestion 2.10\n\nWhat is the optimal surgical approach for irresectable Stage IV colorectal malignancy or peritoneal carcinomatosis causing malignant large bowel obstruction?\n\nRecommendation: A self‐expanding metal stent is the preferred intervention for irresectable Stage IV disease or peritoneal carcinomatosis causing large bowel obstruction. Surgery should be reserved for patients with good performance status and with isolated areas of disease that can be surgically relieved. Success rates for stents are lower if the obstruction is due to extrinsic compression.\n\nPatients should be counselled about high rates of re‐obstruction, morbidity and mortality. The goals of treatment together with patient and family expectations need to be discussed realistically.\n\nLevel of evidence: III\n\nGrade of recommendation: C\n\nConsensus: 100% (SA 88.9%, A 11.1%)\n\nPalliative surgery in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates [264]. However, patients with advanced malignancy are at high risk of obstructive symptoms (10%–28% of colorectal cancers) so this is not an uncommon situation [265]. Carcinomatosis from GI malignancy compared with ovarian primaries is associated with worse outcomes [266]. Negative prognostic indicators for surgery in these cases include older age, poor nutritional state, poor performance status, extent of malignancy, small bowel as opposed to large bowel obstruction and prior abdominal or pelvic radiotherapy [267]. Even in patients who undergo surgery, the re‐obstruction rate can be as high as 50% [268].\n\nSurgery is generally reserved for patients with an obvious obstruction point, which cannot be managed endoscopically (e.g., with SEMS), and when no major barriers to surgical intervention exist such as significant comorbidity, extensive carcinomatosis, multi‐level stenoses or invasion of the root of the mesentery [267, 269]. When surgery is performed, the operative approach must be tailored to the clinical and radiological findings, with the primary goal of relieving the obstruction, alleviating symptoms and sometimes allowing progression to palliative treatment which may prolong survival [270]. Surgery will usually take the form of a palliative loop stoma. A shared model of decision‐making is important in these clinical scenarios, particularly in identifying the goals of care. In general, survival is poor. Median survival in established cases of untreatable MLBO is only approximately 4–5 weeks, although up to a third of patients show spontaneous resolution of acute symptoms with medical management [269]. In patients undergoing surgery, a meta‐analysis showed that resection was associated with the longest survival (7.2 months) with stoma and bypass surgery having shorter survival times (3.4 and 2.7 months respectively) albeit in highly selected populations with small numbers of patients [270]. In addition, major complication rates among those who had surgery were high at 37%. The type of resection performed in the studies was not reported, which limits interpretation of the results.\n\nQuestion 2.11\n\nWhat is the role of laparoscopic resection in emergency surgery for colorectal cancer?\n\nRecommendation: Due to a shorter hospital stay and lower postoperative morbidity and mortality, laparoscopic resection is recommended where patient and tumour characteristics are favourable.\n\nLevel of evidence: III\n\nGrade of recommendation: C\n\nConsensus: 100% (SA 77.8%, A 22.2%)\n\nInternational guidelines suggest that the laparoscopic approach for MLBO due to colorectal cancer should be reserved for selected favourable cases and in specialized centres [222]. Retrospective cohorts and case–control studies have shown that laparoscopic surgery for emergency colorectal surgery (of varying aetiologies) is safe and has similar benefits to laparoscopic surgery in the elective setting with shorter length of stay and lower postoperative morbidity. However, it is likely that case selection biases these results, with younger, fitter, less comorbid and less physiologically deranged patients being selected for a laparoscopic approach.\n\nThe recent LaCeS trial has demonstrated that randomization of a cohort of ES patients between laparoscopic and an open surgical approach is feasible, acceptable and safe, albeit with a conversion rate of 39% [271]. Vallance et al. [272] have examined patient and institutional factors associated with the laparoscopic approach for urgent surgery for colorectal cancer in the English National Bowel Cancer Audit. The proportion of urgent laparoscopic resections doubled across the study period (2010–2016) from 15.1% to 30.3% with no change in the conversion rate, which remained stable at 18.7%. After multivariable logistic regression analysis, patient characteristics associated with the use of a laparoscopic approach were a lower ASA grade and earlier T stage. The use of laparoscopic surgery was associated with a reduced length of stay and lower 90‐day mortality.\n\nPerforation\n\nThe majority of studies report retrospective, single centre experiences of emergency presentations of colorectal cancer; in these cohorts the perforated cancers represent 18.6%–28.4% of cases [272, 273, 274, 275, 276]. In population‐based cohorts, 1.6%–4.1% of the total number of colorectal cancers presented with perforation [277, 278]. Perforation occurs at the site of the cancer in 65%–92% and proximal to the cancer in 3%–35% [279].\n\nReported early perioperative mortality rates from perforated colorectal cancer vary widely and have been as high as 62% [279]. However, more recent reports show perioperative mortality in the range 0%–20% [273, 274, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280]. Mortality rates may depend on the site of perforation. It has been thought that perforation proximal to the tumour site in an obstructed colon tends to lead to diffuse peritoneal contamination and septic shock resulting in an increased risk of perioperative mortality. A perforation at the tumour site results in local contamination and a lower risk of severe peritonitis, although the literature is contradictory. Mortality is associated with age, comorbidity and Stage IV disease [173, 281].\n\nQuestion 2.12\n\nHow should patients who present with a perforated cancer be counselled?\n\nRecommendation: Patients with a perforated cancer should be advised of the higher rate of local recurrence and peritoneal carcinomatosis but that there is no difference in the rate of development of distant metastases. The long‐term oncological outcomes for curatively treated patients presenting as emergencies with either obstruction or perforation are equivalent.\n\nLevel of evidence: III\n\nGrade of recommendation: B\n\nConsensus: 100% (SA 77.8%, A 22.2%)\n\nThe influence of perforation on oncological outcomes remains unclear [279]. It is difficult to draw conclusions from relatively small, single centre, retrospective studies with variable lengths and completeness of follow‐up and with varying rates of perioperative mortality. The heterogeneity of groups within studies (all perforations vs. local or proximal perforations; the inclusion of all ES patients including those with obstruction and perforation; urgent, expedited surgery vs. emergency, immediate surgery) also makes conclusions unreliable.\n\nPoorer cancer outcomes for patients undergoing curative ES in comparison with elective groups are reported [282, 283] but it is suggested that these dismal outcomes are largely due to differences in patient and tumour characteristics and statistical adjustment for differences and propensity score matching eliminates these differences [284]. In the context of perforated tumours alone, the poorer outcomes in patients presenting with perforation may be due to early deaths from perioperative mortality and advanced disease stage [277, 285]. Once adjustment is made for perioperative mortality, similar 5‐year overall survival rates seem to be seen for perforated cancers undergoing complete resection compared with non‐perforated controls [280].\n\nEvidence regarding the incidence of peritoneal carcinomatosis after curative surgery for colorectal cancer is poor, but a perforated primary tumour may be an important factor [286]. Population‐based studies or registries with more complete data are more likely to be reliable than single centre studies. Cheynel et al. showed that, in a population‐based study, locally perforated cancers had a higher rate of local recurrence (15.7% vs. 7.8%, P = 0.021) and peritoneal carcinomatosis (13.8% vs. 6.3%, P = 0.036), but no difference in the rate of distant metastases (17.7% vs. 18.6%, P = 0.99). Perforation was an independent risk factor for local recurrence or peritoneal carcinomatosis (OR 2.17; 95% CI 1.27–3.69, P = 0.004) but, despite this, after exclusion of postoperative mortality perforation was not a significant prognostic factor for survival on multivariate analysis (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.72–1.9, P = 0.54) [277]. The Erlangen Colorectal Cancer Registry showed lower disease‐free 5‐year survival (42.9% vs. 72.8%) and overall survival (47.3% vs. 66.9%) in 52 patients with perforated colon cancer in comparison to 1206 patients with non‐perforated colon cancer and showed that perforation was an independent negative prognostic factor [256].\n\nThere does not appear to be a significant oncological difference in the longer term between curatively treated patients presenting as an emergency with obstruction or perforation. When emergency cases are examined together as a group, Chen et al. found on multivariate analysis that although patients with locally perforated colonic cancer had a lower disease‐free survival (P = 0.005) than those with obstructed cancers there was no difference in overall survival [275] whereas Biondo et al. showed no differences at all between curatively treated emergency patients with perforated (locally or proximally) or obstructed colonic tumours with respect to tumour recurrence, type of recurrence, overall survival, 5‐year disease‐free survival and cancer‐related survival [274]. More recently, the same authors analysed a cohort of patients collected over 18 years, showing that local recurrence was predicted by the presence of diffuse peritonitis, but no significant difference was identified in local recurrence rates between patients presenting with obstruction or perforation [276].\n\nQuestion 2.13\n\nWhat are the surgical options for perforated colorectal cancer?\n\nRecommendation: Operations should be individualized taking into account existing physiological derangement, comorbidity and tumour characteristics. Oncological resection should be performed wherever possible: for perforation at the tumour site, formal resection with or without anastomosis, with or without stoma. For proximal perforations, simultaneous tumour resection and management of the proximal perforation is necessary.\n\nLevel of evidence: III\n\nGrade of recommendation: B\n\nConsensus: 100% (SA 66.7%, A 33.3%)\n\nThe goals of emergency treatment of perforated colorectal cancer are to avert the immediate negative impacts of the complication (e.g., death, sepsis), achieve the best possible tumour control, and ensure timely recovery to permit initiation of appropriate adjuvant or systemic treatment [180]. Given the dilemma surrounding long‐term oncological outcomes in patients treated for perforated cancer, it is important that, where possible, patients should be treated with a standard oncological resection to optimize tumour control. A balance has to be struck between patient safety with prompt control of sepsis and optimizing oncological outcome.\n\nPatients who present with perforated colonic cancer are less likely to have a primary anastomosis [276, 278, 279, 280]. This is mirrored by the ASA grade of the patient; patients with higher ASA grades having a lower rate of primary anastomosis [278]. This is entirely appropriate as the choice of surgical operation depends on the clinical condition of the patient; the risk of primary anastomosis and possible anastomotic leak has to be weighed against the option of a stoma which may not be reversed. Anastomotic leak rates in patients undergoing ES and having a primary anastomosis may be higher than those in elective surgery. Biondo et al. [276] showed an anastomotic leak rate of 15.8% in patients undergoing a primary anastomosis following emergency colorectal cancer presentation. However, similar to oncological outcomes, this may again be due to confounding factors related to patient characteristics as others have found similar leak rates in primarily anastomosed patients [278]. Primary anastomosis (with or without proximal diversion) can be considered in patients with minimal contamination, clinical stability and healthy tissues. In general, resection should follow established oncological principles but there should be a low threshold for performing a staged procedure, accepting that stomas formed in the emergency situation are often not reversed [280], although considering the use of double‐barrelled stomas where possible and avoiding split site stomas increases the chances of stoma reversal.\n\nIn the case of right‐sided perforation, a right hemicolectomy should be performed. Whether an anastomosis is formed or not depends on the condition of the patient bearing in mind that anastomotic leak rates can be high. The recent 2015 ESCP snapshot audit of 3208 patients undergoing right hemicolectomy showed that the overall anastomotic leak rate is 8.1% but can be up to 14.3% in patients presenting as an emergency, although emergency presentation was not a risk factor for anastomotic leak on multivariate analysis [237].\n\nFor perforated distal colonic tumours, an oncological resection and anastomosis, with or without ileostomy, should be the option of choice if the condition of the patient allows, as a Hartmann's resection has a low rate of stoma reversal. A Hartmann's resection is preferred where the clinical condition of the patient is poor. For diastatic perforation (proximal to the site of an obstructing tumour) formal tumour resection and management of the proximal perforation is needed, frequently in the form of a subtotal colectomy with a subsequent negative impact on function [250]. Ideally, minimal resection of the terminal ileum and leaving at least 10 cm of colon remnant above the peritoneal reflection improves function.\n\nPerforation of the extraperitoneal rectum is uncommon. The priority is control of sepsis by drainage of any collection, ideally intraluminally, broad‐spectrum antibiotics and a proximal defunctioning stoma to allow full staging and multidisciplinary planning of neoadjuvant therapy.\n\nBleeding\n\nRectal bleeding is a symptom of colorectal cancer in about half of patients [287] but it is less common for patients to present with an ALGIB. A lower GI malignancy was the ultimate diagnosis in 6.1% of patients presenting as an emergency admission secondary to an ALGIB in the recent UK acute lower GI bleed audit, although this may be an underestimate because 22.8% of 2528 patients with ALGIB had no formal diagnosis at discharge [288]. This is comparable to the rate demonstrated in a prospective population‐based study in Iceland of 7.4% of ALGIB being due to colorectal malignancy [289]. As the rate of underlying colorectal malignancy is at least twice that deemed appropriate for urgent referral and investigation by NICE [289], all patients (if fit enough to benefit from it) should be investigated to determine, and plan any treatment for, the underlying aetiology of an ALGIB. In the recent UK ALGIB audit, 328 patients (13%) were discharged with no investigations and, of the 4.4% of patients readmitted with a further ALGIB within 28 days, more than half (53.2%) had had no inpatient investigation during their initial presentation [288]. The urgency of investigation depends on the severity of the initial bleed, either as an inpatient for unstable or stable major bleeds or as an urgent outpatient within 2 weeks for stable minor bleeds [290].\n\nQuestion 2.14\n\nCan acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding be managed on an outpatient basis?\n\nRecommendation: A proportion of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding can be managed safely on an outpatient basis if appropriately risk‐stratified.\n\nLevel of evidence: III\n\nGrade of recommendation: B\n\nConsensus: 88.9% (SA 66.7%, A 22.2%)\n\nThe British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guidelines for the diagnosis and management of ALGIB detail a risk‐stratified approach to the management of ALGIB. Patients are classified into stable or unstable categories. Stable patients are then subdivided into minor or major groups using a validated risk assessment tool (Oakland score). Minor self‐terminating bleeds without other indications for hospital admission can be discharged and managed on an urgent outpatient basis with investigations within 2 weeks [291].\n\nLink: Oakland score calculator\n\nQuestion 2.15\n\nWhat are the optimal diagnostic techniques for lower gastrointestinal bleeding and when should these different techniques be employed?\n\nRecommendation: Colonoscopy is the preferred initial investigation for minor or major acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding in stable patients. CT angiography is preferred in unstable patients.\n\nLevel of evidence: III\n\nGrade of recommendation: B\n\nConsensus: 100% (SA 66.7%, A 33.3%)\n\nColonoscopy is the most effective initial intervention for stable patients allowing a diagnosis to be made, the site of a malignancy to be tattooed and giving an opportunity for therapy in cases of active bleeding. Patients who have had a major bleed should be admitted to hospital and undergo colonoscopy on the next available list [291]. Bowel preparation, either orally or by nasogastric administration, should be used to increase the diagnostic yield and caecal intubation rate [292].\n\nAs the majority of ALGIB settle spontaneously, using radiological investigations to form a diagnosis is not necessary in all cases; only 25.9% of patients required a CT or CT angiogram in the UK audit, which was diagnostic for the source of bleeding in 55.8% and 49.7% respectively [288]. CT angiogram is preferred in an unstable patient due to its speed of access and assessment of the whole GI tract; in general this will be a triple phase examination (unenhanced, arterial and portal venous/delayed phase) from diaphragm to below the inferior pubic ramus in order to ensure that the anorectum is covered [293]. Radionuclide imaging is unlikely to be helpful in the context of ALGIB due to a colorectal malignancy as colonoscopy and CT/CT angiogram will nearly always be able to localize a tumour.\n\nQuestion 2.16\n\nWhat therapeutic approaches should be considered for bleeding colorectal malignancy?\n\nRecommendation: Patients should be resuscitated and transfused according to standard protocols. Therapeutic options should be individualized according to clinical condition and include colonoscopic therapeutic intervention, angiographic embolization, surgical resection and, very rarely, endovascular stent techniques.\n\nLevel of evidence: III\n\nGrade of recommendation: B\n\nConsensus: 100% (SA 88.9%, A 11.1%)\n\nTherapeutic interventions, other than resuscitation and transfusion of red cells, are rarely required for ALGIB, 80% of which cease spontaneously [294]. Studies and guidelines that address the management of ALGIB consider all cases and aetiologies, but only a small proportion will have ALGIB due to colorectal malignancy.\n\nColonoscopy is the mainstay of diagnosis but can also provide therapeutic options for bleeding malignancy such as vasoconstrictor injection, application of clips, heater‐probe or radiofrequency ablation [295]. Whichever technique is used, rebleeding from colorectal malignancy is common. Although uncommonly required, angiographic embolization is an effective method to treat ALGIB; it was performed in 19 (0.8%) of the 37 (1.5%) patients undergoing angiography in the UK ALGIB audit [288]. However, rebleeds are not uncommon although re‐embolization can be considered [295, 296]. Embolization‐related ischaemia may occur (4%–11%) and can require surgical intervention. Patients experiencing ALGIB due to colorectal malignancy are likely to continue to bleed or rebleed after intervention. Colonoscopic or angiographic therapeutic interventions, if required, should be considered an emergency temporizing measure to allow full radiological staging of disease, optimization of the patient's clinical condition and multidisciplinary team discussion to plan urgent multidisciplinary treatment of the underlying malignancy.\n\nES for acute lower GI bleeding is very rarely needed. Only six patients of 2528 in the UK lower GI bleeding audit required laparotomy (0.2%), only two of which were due to malignancy [288] and none of 1134 patients in a prospective population‐based study [289]. ES for a bleeding colorectal malignancy is likely to be required if there is haemodynamic instability despite a 6‐unit blood transfusion, slow bleeding requiring more than 3 units/day blood transfusion, inability to stop bleeding despite endoscopic and endovascular techniques or recurrent episodes of significant haemorrhage. In these rare situations, oncological principles should be followed wherever possible. The choice of surgical procedure should be individualized depending on the patient's clinical condition but a low threshold should be given to the use of stomas in these rare, life‐threatening cases.\n\nIn uncommon situations where irresectable malignancy may cause dramatic ALGIB due to major vascular involvement by the tumour, the use of endovascular stents, where anatomically feasible, may improve quality of life and provide successful palliation [297].\n\nINFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE\n\nThe emergency management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been considered extensively recently by the ACPGBI and is comprehensively covered in the ACPGBI IBD Guidelines.\n\nLink: ACPGBI IBD Guidelines\n\nACUTE BOWEL ISCHAEMIA AND INFARCTION\n\nIntroduction\n\nAcute mesenteric ischaemia (AMI) is defined as the sudden interruption of the blood supply, or venous drainage, to a section of bowel, leading to ischaemia, cellular damage and/or intestinal necrosis [298, 299, 300]. It has an estimated prevalence of 1:1000 European and US hospital admissions [301, 302, 303] and is associated with a high mortality rate, particularly if detected late and decompensated acidaemia has ensued. Bowel ischaemia is observed in approximately 11.8% of cases within the NELA and has an associated 23.9% 30‐day and 27.7% 90‐day mortality rate [298]. AMI clinical management is therefore time sensitive and associated with a high mortality risk. It requires a high index of suspicion by the clinical team and thus is a key challenge to the on‐call general surgeon.\n\nPrevious work has demonstrated variable mortality rates of patients with AMI between centres [303, 305]. One reason for this may be the variability in management as observed between centres contributing to NELA [299]. There is also likely to be an element of intra‐clinician variability of practice. This could partly be a result of the paucity of guidelines available on this subject.\n\nAMI can be divided into four broad categories [306]\n\narterial embolization, occurring in 40%–50% of cases;\n\narterial thrombosis, in 25%–30% of patients;\n\nnon‐occlusive mesenteric ischaemia (NOMI) in approximately 20% of patients;\n\nmesenteric venous thrombosis in 10%.\n\nWhere appropriate, the management of these conditions is combined in these recommendations with any variation pertaining to the management of individual subcategories stated.\n\nQuestion 4.1\n\nHow is the diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischaemia made?\n\nRecommendation: As there are no reliable clinical symptoms or signs that are pathognomonic a high index of suspicion is vital in detecting intestinal ischaemia. Untreated atrial fibrillation, underlying vascular disease and risk factors for atherosclerosis should raise suspicion.\n\nLevel of evidence: IV\n\nGrade of recommendation: D\n\nConsensus: 100% (SA 100%)\n\nThe diagnosis of AMI can be difficult. Sudden onset of abdominal pain and symptoms out of keeping with the clinical signs elicited should raise concern, the site and extent of the pain being variable. Peritonism is a late clinical sign, as is per rectal bleeding, fever or haemodynamic instability. AMI can cause extreme pain and patients may have substantial analgesic requirements. Pain out of context with clinical signs is often described as being the typical presentation of AMI [301]. However, this clinical finding has a poor negative sensitivity [307]. Guaiac‐positive stools, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, diffuse tenderness and peritoneal signs may be present [307]. Vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea are early clinical signs with peritonism, haemodynamic instability and shock occurring later [307]. Large bowel ischaemia presenting with per rectal bleeding is common and typically has a more benign course than small bowel ischaemia [308].\n\nGiven the diverse nature of aetiologies causing AMI, and the dynamic process of bowel ischaemia, no specific spectrum of clinical signs can be relied upon to establish the diagnosis. A high index of suspicion with a low threshold to perform further investigations in a timely manner is recommended in order to ensure diagnosis. Mortality is associated with delayed diagnosis and thus early investigation is important [309].\n\nOne epidemiological study showed that AMI is more common than appendicitis in the elderly cohort [310]. As such, the diagnosis should be suspected in elderly patients, particularly those with other cardiovascular comorbidities, presenting with abdominal pain [310, 311]. Alcohol intake, sex and comorbidity history of hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, stroke, heart failure, chronic renal disease, ischaemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cirrhosis have all been reported to be risk factors [302, 312, 313, 314]. Post cardiac and aortic aneurysm surgery (particularly in the context of emergency repair for rupture) and any other vascular intervention increases the risk of bowel ischaemia [315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 320]. AMI should also be considered in patients admitted to critical care with septic shock in whom an infective cause has not been demonstrated 24 h after admission [321].\n\nSome patients present with AMI without any obvious aetiological risk factor being present. Embryological malrotations, for example, can lead to volvulus and subsequent ischaemia without any concomitant risks [322, 323, 324].\n\nQuestion 4.2\n\nWhat are the important factors in determining outcome in ischaemic bowel?\n\nRecommendation: Prognosis should be based on physiological parameters which include comorbidity together with the length of bowel affected and extent of bowel infarction. There are no validated scoring systems that can predict outcome.\n\nLevel of evidence: II\n\nGrade of recommendation: B\n\nConsensus: 100% (SA 88.9%, A 11.1%)\n\nAlthough several risk‐stratification tools have been proposed [304, 316, 319, 320], none has been validated in large volume clinical practice [301]. Outcome is based on pathology, physiological disturbance and underlying comorbidity [309]. However, the use of risk calculators available for emergency laparotomies has been shown to reduce variability in the perception of risk by surgeons [325]. Such tools may be useful when counselling patients and their families about the risk of adverse outcome in this setting.\n\nPredictive factors for necrosis (and thus poorer outcome) include a combination of organ failure, a lactate >2 mmol/l and bowel loop dilatation on CT [326]. Although pneumatosis intestinalis on CT or plain X‐ray tests is a sign of bowel ischaemia, caution should be used in interpretation and clinical correlation remains vital. Isolated pneumatosis intestinalis does not always require operative intervention [327, 328, 329]. The site of intestinal ischaemia is also a risk‐stratifier. The right side of the colon has a worse survival profile than left‐sided colonic ischaemia [330, 331, 332].\n\nQuestion 4.3\n\nWhat investigations are required for the management of acute mesenteric ischaemia?\n\nRecommendation: A multiphase CT should occur urgently in any patient suspected of acute mesenteric ischaemia where active treatment is appropriate.\n\nLevel of evidence: III\n\nGrade of recommendation: B\n\nConsensus: 100% (SA 100%)\n\nAMI is an evolving process from multiple aetiologies. With inadequate perfusion, to ischaemia and then infarction blood tests such as pH or lactate will become increasingly abnormal. The outcomes are best for those with early pathology [306, 314] and thus management decisions, including further investigations, should not be delayed due to the lack of positive evidence in blood tests where AMI is suspected [301, 333].\n\nMost recent evidence assessing the accuracy of blood tests in detecting mesenteric ischaemia and infarction is poor [333, 334, 335, 336, 337, 338, 339, 340, 341, 342, 343, 344, 345, 346, 347, 348, 349, 350, 351, 352, 353, 354, 355, 356, 357, 358, 359]. On meta‐analysis review [334, 335] of the predictive biochemical and haematological markers in AMI, D‐dimer was found to have the highest sensitivity (93.4%–96%). It was non‐specific, however (36.4%–40%). As a result, it cannot be used to discriminate AMI cases. Lactate and acidaemia will rise during the pathophysiological processes involved in AMI. However, neither are sensitive or specific markers for AMI. Investigations to diagnose AMI should not be delayed until the presence of a high serum lactate level or increased levels of acidaemia are noted, if the clinical suspicion is high. Although tests such as urinary intestinal fatty‐acid binding protein levels show promise, they cannot be recommended at present to discriminate AMI cases [333, 334, 346, 350]. As such there are no key blood biomarkers recommended for the diagnosis of AMI.\n\nWhilst there have been multiple recent publications assessing the radiological diagnostic modalities in AMI, they are mainly review articles and baseline evidence is poor; however, only CT angiography had adequate accuracy to establish the diagnosis of AMI in lieu of a laparotomy [360]. Plain abdominal X‐rays have no clinical value in this setting. A multiphase phase CT is the modality of choice; classically this is a dual phase examination, with arterial and portal venous phases. The addition of an unenhanced scan is beneficial as unenhanced bowel hyperdensity is highly specific of ischaemia [361] and improves sensitivity, diagnostic confidence and interobserver agreement [362].
