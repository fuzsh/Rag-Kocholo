        "text": "Aston Basagic Funeral Home\n\nP.O. Box 273 - 7742 Main Street\n\nHunter, New York, 12442\n\nLarry V. Vanucchi\n\nFebruary 25, 1946 - February 01, 2024\n\nIt is with great sadness that we announce that Larry Vanucchi has passed away peacefully surrounded by his family and loved ones. Larry passed away on February 1, 2024 at the age of 77 after a courageous battle with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). His departure has left a deep wound, and it is deeply felt by his entire family, and countless others in his community.\n\nLarry was born on February 25, 1946 to Henry and Marion Vanucchi. He grew up in Tannersville New York with his parents and three brothers Wayne Steve and Gary started his career and land surveying in his 30s. Larry established his own business Vanucchi Associates., alongside his son Joe for approximately 40 years. His business was a pillar for the people of Tannersville, who he loved like family. Through his work he was able to live and breathe the landscape of Tannersville, which he loved immensely.\n\nLarry was a unique individual who embodied the best qualities: strength of spirit, kindness, generosity to everyone around him, and a non-judgmental personality. He will always be remembered for his quirky humor and contagious laugh. Larry always found a way to lighten the mood through stories of his life in Tannersville, or by sharing a beauty tip .\n\nLarry is survived by his wife, Lauri; his brothers, Wayne and Gary, his sons, Joe, and Jesse, his daughters, Kim, Jamie, and Melody and many cousins nieces nephews, five grandchildren and three great grandchildren.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family request donations be made to curePSP, an organization that works towards improving care and finding a cure for PSP. Donations may also be made to the Tannersville rescue squad.\n\n​Aston&Basagic Funeral Home, 7742 Main St. Hunter, New York, February 8, 2024, visitation 3 to 4 PM service 4 to 5 PM\n\nAston Basagic Funeral Home\n\nPhone: 518-263-4719 Fax: 518-263-4721\n\nPast Obituaries\n\nIla Goodrich\n\nJanuary 7, 1932 - October 22, 2023\n\nHenry Weismann III\n\nJanuary 31, 1945 ​​- August 30, 2023\n\nElizabeth Hapeman\n\nNovember 18, 1936 - July 25, 2023\n\nSusan Mangam\n\nMay 30, 1937 - July 14, 2023\n\nLeon Goodrich\n\nDecember 20, 1930 - June 12, 2023\n\nTyler Yager\n\nDecember 20, 1986 - May 18, 2023\n\nMarkus Steinmann\n\nDecember 18, 1963 - April 9, 2023\n\nFrank G.
