        "text": "All images courtesy of Jim Beverly\n\nOnce a month they are young again, these accomplished supper club musicians, raconteurs and playful misfits. They call themselves ROMEO, not to be confused with the Shakespearean tragedy of love although there has surely been some of that along the way.\n\nROMEO stands for “Retired Old Men Eating Out.” Or sometimes “Retired Old Musicians Eating Out.” The ROMEO organization was formed in 2022 by Dave Major and the Majors/Onstage Majority member Jim Beverly. The seventy-eight-year-old former drummer remembered Tom Brokaw writing about a group of elders in his book “The Greatest Generation.” When the ROMEO group gets together you can still hear the ice cubes clink and see smoke from distant cigarettes. The fire will always burn within their hearts.\n\nOver the past year I have been an honorary Man of ROMEO. I never played guitar, drums or sang “Danke Schoen.” But these gentlemen trusted me as they shared stories from a bygone era of supper clubs and lounges. Several years ago I wrote a book about supper clubs and I have a nice collection of supper-club vinyl but as I sat down with my ROMEO men for lunch at various far northwest suburban restaurants, I threw out all that I knew and tried to listen with discovery and respect. The supper-club music scene once thrived in the Chicago area and neighboring states because of the passion and work ethic of musicians and entertainers. These guys did it all. Who does it all these days?\n\nThe 1960s, seventies and eighties glory days of Midwest supper clubs and showrooms featured choice cuts of loud live music. Gigs were characterized by charisma, corny jokes and material that included pop, rock and country. Vocalists and musicians performed in technicolor outfits. These cheeky acts were part of a community. It didn’t matter if the club was in the Wisconsin Dells or Chicago, these artists offered familiar faces to go with any song.\n\nThe acts had big shiny names, like Onstage Majority and New Odyssey out of Chicago, the Swinging Ambassadors from St. Paul, Minnesota and even Nick Apollo (featured in the film “Broadway Danny Rose”) from the New York area. They were all part of a kinetic ecosystem.\n\nBut no supper-club act in America has the bizarre backstory of Dave Major & the Minors. After all, bloodshed and police shootouts were never the regular fare in this racket.\n\nIn the 1970s, the five-piece band grew out of the smaller supper-club circuit for residencies at the now-closed Playboy Club in Lake Geneva, the Chula Vista Resort in the Wisconsin Dells and the Vagabond Resort in Rochelle, Illinois. There was work at the Navarone supper club in Elk Grove Village and Field’s Supper Club on South Cicero Avenue in Oak Lawn. Bandleader Major could play twenty-two different instruments and sang with a latter-day Sinatra swing.\n\nDick Jess is a local treasure of the supper club showroom genre. Now seventy-eight, he was a member of Dave Major & the Minors from 1965 to 1969 and then joined the Onstage Majority. And then New Odyssey. He is to supper-club music what Billy Preston was to the Beatles.\n\n“The music was not the end,” Jess says over lunch at an Applebee’s in McHenry with fellow supper-club showroom act Gary Todd—who started Odyssey before they became New. “Music was just the means,” Jess says. “A lot of it was talking. Comedy. Personality. We used classical music, contemporary rock ‘n’ roll, barbershop quartets and theatrical things. We were musicians but our job was to entertain. You had to get out there and have that one-to-one with people. You were friends. And it worked.” Todd says, “Onstage Majority and Dave Major & the Minors were the kings of the circuit. We came later and were copying them.”\n\nDave Major & the Minors formed in 1962 as the Esquires in the Elgin-DeKalb area. The original members were identical twins Dave and Dick Perry, Roger Petersen, Dennis Stevens and Beverly. In the summer of 1963, Dave “Sandee” Sanderson joined the Esquires. He had been the front man of the Swinging Lads, a group that worked Las Vegas.\n\nBeverly remembers Sanderson suggesting Vegas chutzpah before a gig at the Embers supper club in Bartlett. The Esquires had seen the bodacious Louis Prima sideman Sam Butera and the Witnesses in Vegas. “We thought maybe we can do stuff like that,” Beverly recalls. “I was heavily into theater.” In 1968 Beverly obtained a theater degree at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb and later studied at the Player’s Workshop of The Second City in Chicago.\n\n“Any novelty songs we wanted to do as a show band, I was front line and center,” he says. Beverly covered Pat Boone’s “Speedy Gonzalez,” doing all the parts including the high-pitched female part, and Johnny Ray’s 1951 hit “Cry” where his prop included a wet handkerchief that he rang out as he was crying and singing. Beverly, a fan of comic actors Jerry Lewis and Jonathan Winters, was the resident comic telling jokes and mugging for publicity shots.\n\nThe Esquires’ first big break came in the fall of 1963 when they played the Danny Thomas St. Jude’s benefit with headliner Bobby Rydell at the old Chicago Stadium. Later in 1963 they appeared on “The Mike Douglas Show.” The Esquires changed their name because they didn’t want to be confused with the Milwaukee soul group The Esquires, who later had a national 1967 hit with “Get On Up.”\n\nIn 1964 the show band changed its name to Dave Major & the Minors.\n\nBeverly’s mother came up with the name. “My mom said, ‘Well you guys are going back to school to major in this and minor in that,’” recalls Beverly, who grew up in Elgin. “She said we should use major and minor because they were also musical terms. And Dave [Perry] was fine with it because he didn’t lose his identity as the leader of the group. We were all making the same money and sharing it equally.”\n\nDave and Dick Perry were born and raised in Dixon, Illinois. Their father Bob Perry was a successful salesman who sold prefab homes, Harvestore silos and lumber. Later in life he sold Aflac insurance. He died in 2012 in Belle Fourche, South Dakota at the age of ninety-two. He had been married for seventy years to Vivian Perry. She played piano and organ and once gigged in a band in Florida. She died in 2016 in Belle Fourche at the age of ninety-eight.\n\nDave Perry assumed the role of frontman and took the name Dave Major. “Dave and Dick, because they were identical twins, started out doing a lot of Smothers Brothers,” says Jess. “That’s how their bits started.”\n\n“Dave had no degree from anywhere,” Jess adds. “Dave was a great showman, don’t get me wrong, but he was not scholastically minded.” Beverly says, “Dave did study all sorts of instruments so he knew a little bit about a lot of instruments. He had a temper, but he didn’t act that way around all of us. He and his brother would argue a lot.”\n\nHorn player Terry Diers was in the Esquires and the second version of Dave Major & the Minors from 1969 to 1971. Now retired and living in Indianapolis, Diers is too far away to make the ROMEO meetings. He was majoring in music at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb when Dave and Dick Perry found him. Diers says, “Brothers are bad, but twins are worse. They would scream at each other on stage, calling each other fuckface and asshole. I’m the dark-haired guy in the middle and they were the blondes as bookends. I’d lean back to drop one horn to pick up another and they would be screaming at each other. It was kind of funny but the audience couldn’t hear that. It was also depressing at times. I was the peacemaker because I was the oldest guy.”\n\nDave Major & the Minors released three albums: “Someone New” (1970), “Dave Major & the Minors Second Album” (1972), and “Dave Major & the Minors Our 3rd Record” (1973). “Dave had a big personality,” Jess says. “He was a tremendously talented guy, more so than his twin brother.” Diers adds, “Dave Perry was the dominant twin musically. He called the shots musically. Dick Perry took care of the business side: paying the bills and arranging the setlists. Dave was the spokesman for the band. Dick would speak on the microphone but Dave was the frontman on stage. We talked in our comedy bits, but we didn’t improvise. Our shows were paced. It was very well structured.”\n\nMelodye Harrison-Grochowski had been a cocktail server at the Galleon Lounge supper club at the Holiday Inn on U.S. 51 North in Stevens Point, Wisconsin for seven years before she connected with Dave Major & the Minors in February 1982. She was a pretty woman with a Farrah Fawcett flair.\n\nThe Galleon seated about 200 people in a dimly lit room that was anchored by a life-size sailing ship. Bartenders worked within the faux ship. Dozens of red Naugahyde barstools flanked the bar. “The only celebrity I remember mingling with played at the university there,” Melodye says. “He stayed at the Holiday Inn. When the concert was over the band came into the lounge. He drank double tequila in a snifter. That’s… What’s his name? ‘Footloose’?”\n\nThat would be Kenny Loggins. He also had a hit called “Danger Zone.”\n\nMelodye had met Dave Major a few years earlier at Field’s Supper Club in Oak Lawn. “But we hooked up at the Holiday Inn,” she says. “Then I went on the road with the band.” Melodye, then twenty-eight, ran the 64-channel sound board and sold records at the band’s gigs.\n\n“Dave always wanted me to be at the show,” she says. “This was before I was on his payroll. I was fascinated with the soundboard. I have an ear for music. My whole family is musical. My dad was a musician. That’s how I got my name. I just told Dave I wanted Fast Eddie’s job. He was the sound man. So Fast Eddie trained me and trained me. I couldn’t stand not doing something. I ended up enjoying that.”\n\nMelodye’s father Samuel Harrison played drums in the U.S. Army Band for twenty-four years. He was born in Tennessee and grew up in Racine, Wisconsin. Samuel was a drum major in Racine where he taught his daughter how to twirl a baton. He played violin as a kid; the instrument had been in the family for 200 years. Melodye says, “His grandfather played it as did his great-grandfather. His mother made him play and he hated it because back then violin players were considered sissies. He would intentionally leave that violin on the school bus hoping that somebody would steal it. And it would always turn up.”\n\nSamuel Harrison once took the violin to a museum in Chicago for an appraisal. There was a faint label at the bottom of the scroll that said 1735. “The museum offered my dad a terrific amount of money for it because they believed it could have been one of the eleven Stradivarius violins that were missing,” Melodye says. Antonio Stradivari was the most famous violin maker in the world and several older violins had vanished. According to the Smithsonian, only 650 remain today. Melodye says, “When they told him that he never let it out of his sight. He brought it home and put it up on a lighted mount on the wall.” She says that today the violin is stored under lock and key in a climate-controlled environment in Racine.\n\nMelodye still loves all kinds of music. “When I got with Dave Major I was just coming out of Deep Purple, Guns N’ Roses,” she says. “Things that he didn’t play. But if music is done well I like it no matter what it is. I love Waylon Jennings.” One evening Dave took Melodye to see Jennings at the intimate Blue Room Ballroom in Elgin. Dave Major was a man with a plan and he scored front-row seats. Dave had performed at the club at the beginning of his career.\n\nMelodye’s open ears made her a natural for the anything-goes Dave Major & the Minors groove. She respected the band’s versatile musical ethos. “Each one of them played a lot of instruments,” she says. “They played a lot of medleys from a lot of eras. Big Bands, music from the 1950s, sixties, seventies, eighties. He loved the Big Band era. They’d play a little bit of Hall & Oates. They did a whole skit on [the Oak Ridge Boys’ 1981 country-pop hit] ‘Elvira.’ They usually did skits with these songs. A lot of props, a lot of hats.” Melodye contributed backing vocals on the band’s final project, “That’s Life,” a 1986 cassette-only release recorded at the late Gary Loizzo’s [of American Breed fame] Pumpkin Studios in Oak Lawn.\n\nDave Perry (Major) was married when he met Melodye. But she never married him. “His divorce took five years,” she says. “By the time he was available I didn’t want it anymore.” By then, Dave and Melodye had two children, a boy and a girl. Melodye cut off the relationship for good in February 1990.\n\nOn March 30, 1990 Melodye met Scott Grochowski at the now-defunct Stay Out All Night disco on Mannheim Road in west suburban Stone Park. He was a weekend bouncer at the club and a paramedic during the week. Scott also worked at the Stay Out West in Hanover Park; Melodye got a part-time job as a cocktail server at that club. Melodye and Scott married in April 1994. Dave and Melodye’s daughter lived with Dave in an apartment complex in Naperville. Their son lived with Melodye in Kingston (population 1,100), about twelve miles north of DeKalb. Perry demanded custody of his son.\n\nMelodye, her son, three dogs, four cats and a Burmese python lived in a nice tri-level home with a large downstairs family room and office. The home resembled a raised ranch. Around midnight February 2, 2000 Dave Perry showed up unannounced at the Kingston home. He had a gun. Melodye was aware of Dave’s fascination with guns.\n\n“He shot nineteen bullets through the front door,” she says in measured tones. “I had a full-glass front door. He took the butt of the gun and broke out the glass around the bullet holes because it didn’t shatter. He stepped through and that’s when I crouched down behind the kitchen island. He didn’t know the layout of the house.\n\n“I was hiding. He walked right by me, never even knew it. It was 12:30 in the morning. It was dark. He went upstairs and shot my mother [Janie Sue Harrison] behind the bedroom door. He kicked in the door with his foot. She was on the phone with 911. He shot her point-blank through the jugular. I think at first he thought it was me. He didn’t know she was there. She was visiting from Arkansas. He just heard somebody whispering. And then he went around the house looking for me. My son was hiding in the closet when the gunshots were being fired. Dave goes into his room, flicks on the light and he comes out of the closet. His dad was waving a smoking gun. He says, ‘Where’s your mother?’ And he says, ‘I don’t know.’ He had shot Scott through the chest at the front door. He collapsed at the island where I was, but he got up and made his way down to the laundry room. That’s when Perry found him and shot him five more times.” Scott Grochowski died. He was thirty-eight years old.\n\nMelodye had run across the street for help. Her neighbor was an Army veteran who already had 911 on the line. “From that point I watched everything from across the street,” she says. “Three minutes later three squads [from DeKalb County, Kingston and Genoa police departments] arrived. They surrounded the house. My house was lit up like daylight from their floodlights. Dave exited the back of the house and came around the house. The cops had me on their radio. I said, ‘He’s coming around right now.’ We even heard him saying, ‘Where is she?’ over and over again. He was pointing the gun at these three cops. They told him three times to drop the gun. He shot at one of them. He took four bullets to the sternum and fell underneath my kitchen window. He laid there for eight hours during the crime-scene investigation. By that time it was daylight and the school buses were going by. A dead guy laying in my front yard.” Dave Perry was fifty-seven years old. All three victims were pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nMelodye’s account was corroborated in December 2023 by DeKalb County Sheriff Andy Sullivan. He is a twenty-seven-year veteran of the force and was working during the night of the shootings, although he was not on the scene. “It’s pretty close,” Sullivan says. “He wouldn’t drop the gun and he did fire at the officer. That’s when the officer returned fire. I can’t tell you if it was nineteen rounds. I can say there were multiple casings on the front porch and inside the house, the glass was shattered and it was knocked out.”\n\nPerry had been stalking her, Melodye says. She changed her phone number three or four times a year. “I was threatened and hunted for ten years after I left him,” she says. “He wanted to know where I lived.” Sheriff Sullivan says, “I don’t remember stalking. I do remember he had an alcohol problem, he was in AA for a while and fell off that. He had a gun and had a friend hold that gun for him for safekeeping. He got that gun back somehow.”\n\n“He was wonderful and good to me until I went against the grain,” Melodye reflects. That didn’t happen until I had the babies, seven years after we started the relationship when I had my first baby. I said, ‘I’m not going on the road anymore. I’m going to stay home and take care of my baby.’ He said that wasn’t negotiable. My son was three months old and I was pregnant again. And that’s when everything fell apart. I was angry. He insisted I go on the road with the kids like his first wife had done with tutors. I said, ‘I’m not doing that.’ He went to Alcoholics Anonymous. I never saw him take a drink in the ten years we were together. The night I got married he got his first of three DUIs and didn’t show up on stage [with his band]. He had eight times the legal limit of alcohol the night he showed up at my house.”\n\nSix months before the murders, Perry told the Kingston police department that Melodye had kidnapped his son and that he wanted to retrieve him. The police escorted him to the house. “He was flashing a court paper that was five years old,” Melodye says. “It was my son’s eleventh birthday. He said he wanted to see him. I hollered up the stairs and said, ‘Do you want to see your Dad?’ He never came downstairs. The cops said there was nothing they could do. They couldn’t drag the kid out of the house.” Current Kingston police chief Gerald Taft was not on the force in 2000. In the winter of 2023, he heavily perused the police records and could not locate any notes on the events. He did say, “Nowadays if you don’t have a valid court order we are not helping you.”\n\nMelodye was told that if she continued to have problems she should seek legal assistance. “He couldn’t afford his attorney anymore because he was high-priced and very good,” Melodye says. “So he was escorted away and told to get an attorney.” Melodye says she is estranged from her daughter, who lives in the western suburbs. “I haven’t seen her since she was five years old,” she says. “He took her when she was three years old. He said I’d never see my daughter again. He had to return my son in the middle of the second grade. My son is grieving.\n\n“Dave was punishing me for leaving him. He was told by his attorney he would never get my kids unless he was a married man and because he was a traveling musician. We split in February 1990. Between February and August he asked three women to marry him. One finally did, his second wife and current widow. He met her on July 4 and they were married on August 6 of 1990.” Dave’s first wife Judy lives in the northwest suburbs. Judy did not return several calls for this story.\n\n“Judy actually went to court on my behalf in the custody battle,” Melodye says. “At court recess Judy and I were sitting at a table in the lunchroom. This was DeKalb County. Dave and his attorney were sitting at a table across the room. I heard Dave say, ‘Look over there, you’ll never see that again.’ Judy was good.” Dave Perry had two children with Judy and two with Melodye. “It was a two-year juvenile court battle to get custody of my kids,” Melodye says.\n\nJust like Dave Major’s band members, Melodye saw two sides of Dave Perry when the music played. “He was so polished on stage,” she says. “You couldn’t stop him. He made jokes, but if there was a mistake on stage or the curtain came down and the lights went off you heard about all the mistakes. And he pretty much turned into a beast.”\n\nMelodye knew how to handle Dave’s temper.\n\n“I just shut off his mic,” she says with a laugh. “I did. A lot of times. If I didn’t like what he said I just muted him. Then he would make a joke out of that.”\n\nBrian Palmer was keyboardist for Dave Major & the Minors between 1976 and 1983. His first gigs with the band were at Mangam’s Chateau theater-restaurant (with the Chat Room, “Cypress Room Le Cafe Cristal ) on Ogden Avenue in Lyons. “Dave had moods,” he recalls. “Sometimes he would be in a good mood, no matter what happened. Other times it would be, ‘I don’t want you to play the bass pedals that way on that song.’ What’s the difference if I play the bass pedals with my left hand? You had to let it go in one ear and out the other. But there were lots of personality conflicts in the band. I went through six or seven changes, mainly drums and lead trumpet.\n\n“We were aware Dave had firearms. He had a miniature violin case. No gun in that. But he had a bottle of Scotch in it. We were on the road and we all had CB radios. He’d go, ‘You guys ready to play the violin?’ We knew what that meant. We’d pull over and take a hit of Scotch.”\n\nDuring their time together, Melodye sent Dave to jail three times on battery charges. “There was an incident coming home from GermanFest in Lincolnshire where he put a crease in a Volvo,” she recalls. “He shot wildly at a bunch of kids in the car out the window.” Dave purchased some of his guns from Elgin and Chicago cops, according to Melodye. “He knew some of them,” she says. “They did each other favors. When he’d get a gun confiscated he’d just get another one. But when he tried to buy the gun that he used at my house he was denied on two applications. He lied on the third application about not being on antidepressants and not having a police record for battery. That’s how he got ahold of the firearm he used at my house.”\n\nAfter a February 1988 Dave Major gig at the Galleon Lounge, Melodye and Dave were in line at the drive-through at a Burger King near the supper-club motel. It was a cold night and they were in line behind a pick-up truck with three college-age men. “Dave has a brand new Lincoln as always,” Melodye says. “We’re sitting there. So this pick-up truck starts tapping his bumper, goofing around. So he reaches under the car seat, grabs his piece and walks back to the pick-up truck. The kid rolls down the window. Dave puts the barrel to his nose and asks if he had a problem. The employee in the window at Burger King sees this and calls the cops. Dave gets back in the car, we pull out of line and go back to the Holiday Inn. Within twenty minutes a couple cops show up at the hotel room. They’re knocking at the door. Dave says, ‘Don’t tell them where the gun is.’ We let them in. They said, ‘Do you have a gun here?’ I said, ‘The one you’re looking for is underneath the bed in a suitcase.’ My son was six months old in a porta-crib in that room. I was tired with his shenanigans.”\n\nDuring our conversations Melodye remembers she met Perry on a February 2, the same date that the murders would take place. “After everything happened, I wondered what made him snap,” she says. “Why did he pick that day? He’d been talking about killing me since I left him. Four years later [after the shootings] I was sitting at the table, drinking my coffee and gazing out the window. It came to me instantly. February 2, 2000 would have been the anniversary of our first date.”\n\n2/2 time. Two beats per measure.\n\nJess was surprised at the chilling turn of events in Dave Perry’s life. “It shocked the hell out of me,” he says. “Dave wasn’t a city kid. He was from Dixon. I was never a good friend of Dave or Dick. They were seven or eight years older than me. I was the young guy. They were already married. I was single. Plus, being identical twins they kind of stayed to themselves. When I worked with Dave, he didn’t drink, he didn’t do any drugs. He did have a problem with assorted authority. He had more of a temper with his brother. They fought all the time. He was not the leader of the band and he was not my boss. He was great to work with on stage. I learned from him and I taught him all the brass instruments. I can play twenty-two instruments. Gary [Todd] can play twenty-two instruments.” Melodye says, “His brother was the complete opposite of Dave. He played bass and some horns. He was the straight guy. He had a subdued personality. He was out of the band when I joined them. I met Richard [Perry] plenty of times. Richard was quite the businessman. He owned hotels after he got out of the band. He was sweet and nice, nothing like Dave in terms of personality. Even though they were identical twins, Richard was the one with the brains.”\n\nRichard Perry left the Chicago area and settled in San Bernardino, California, where he took up real estate. Once in a while he showed his wife YouTube videos of Dave Major & the Minors. Perry died of cancer on March 20, 2023 at the age of eighty. He is interred at Forest Lawn in Covina Hills, California. His sister Ann, the only surviving Perry child, lives in South Dakota.\n\nGary Todd, sixty-eight, says, “I only met Dave a few times but there was always an aftercurrent. The first time we worked Lake Okoboji [in northeastern Iowa], Dave’s wife was there. They had divorced. She was so mad at him she gave me contacts and information on jobs to do as much damage to him.”\n\nWhile keeping his dark personality out of the stage lights, Dave Perry was able to capitalize on the bright new musical gear that was being manufactured in the Chicago area. “We were around when Shure invented the PA system,” Jess says. “Dave Major & the Minors was the big show band in town so we got the prototypes. The first commercial PA on the market was a Shure Vocal Master. We had one before they ever went on sale.” The Shure Vocal Master debuted in 1968 and was regarded as the first complete portable sound system. Shure’s corporate headquarters were in Evanston, so they could easily experiment with Chicago-area supper club and lounge show bands.\n\nMelodye recalls, “Dave swore by Shure microphones. He would never buy anything else. He had JBL speakers but his mics had to be Shure. They were foolproof, sturdy and they had a good sound. They were real clean. No mud at all.” Jess says, “I agree with that. I’m very pro-Shure microphones. I’ve used one model my whole life. The SM58 which is state of the art. I still see it all the time in concerts.” Roger Daltrey, Buddy Guy and Paul McCartney are SM58 fans. “It is the perfect mic for vocal sound,” Jess says. “It works well because I double up on so many instruments. It picks them all up with a lot of accuracy without distortion.”\n\nOther than Melodye, no other woman was doing sound in mid-range club gigs during the 1980s. “It was unheard of,” Melodye says. “I just saw sound guys all the time. Everywhere we went.”\n\n“You learned as you went along,” Jess says. When we started there were no keyboards. Everyone had to use a Hammond B-3 organ, which weighed about nine million pounds. We all had bad backs because we carried that thing around. But when I was with Dave Major & the Minors, portable keyboards were coming out. I had one of the first ones—a Farfisa. I became keyboard player in that group as well as the horn player. The Wurlitzer piano company was in Sycamore [Illinois]. They were trying to develop a combo keyboard for small bands and gave us keyboards to use. Another company gave us amplifiers to try out. Shure was giving us microphones. It was a great time when all this stuff was being invented. You had to learn electronics. Being a musician wasn’t enough. That was part of the fun of it all. Different styles with different instruments. Inventions were being put out there. And we’d play with them six hours a night.”\n\nBy the late 1960s the intimate sound of supper-club music was evolving into a bigger show-band sound, just as America was evolving from black-and-white into Technicolor. Beverly explains, “Our agent [Don Faber] would go to a club and say, ‘I have a band and they do more than play music.’ The club owner would ask, ‘What do they do?’ He’d say, ‘They put on a show. They do stand-up comedy. Visual things. They have horns. And people started standing in lines to get in our shows.”\n\nFueled by that energy, Dave Major & the Minors enjoyed a three-decade stand at the Chula Vista resort in the Wisconsin Dells where owner Joe Kaminski built a 5,000-square-foot showroom with a sixteen-by-twenty-foot stage and light tree. The Kaminski family had bought the resort in 1953. Kaminski’s son Mike recalled how his father discovered the band in January 1967 during the Big Snow of Chicago: “Dave Major & the Minors were still college students,” Kaminski says. “Dave and Dick Perry, Jim Beverly and Dick Jess were the group. They were playing in a Chicago hotel. There was the snowstorm and my dad and my uncle and grandfather got stuck there for three or four days. My dad has passed away but I’m assuming they went there on a Friday. In those days the showrooms played six nights a week.”\n\nBeverly recalls they were discovered at the Sheraton O’Hare on Mannheim Road. “We worked Mannheim Road all the time,” Jess says. “The Marriott on Higgins. If the airport shut down, all the business people were stuck. I do remember getting stuck at the Midway Motor Lodge [Hoffman House] in Dubuque, Iowa. It was so cold, no cars would start. All the rooms lost heat. So everybody that was staying in the hotel had to come to the restaurant and bar area because it had heat. We hung out for three days. We made music when we wanted to. We got to know everybody on a first-name basis.”\n\nDave Major & the Minors played Chula Vista for the first time in 1967 and they played just about every year between 1967 and 1984, according to Kaminski, who is now sixty-four. Chula Vista featured live music from mid-June until Labor Day weekend. The show band would play for five or six weeks in a row. The venue was dark on Sunday nights.\n\n“Dave Major would be there in July and August and we’d bring in big names for Labor Day weekend: Bobby Vinton, Frank Sinatra, Jr., Boots Randolph,” Kaminski says. “We had the whole recovery from the Jimmy Carter thing going on so we didn’t have them for a couple of years. They returned in 1987 to the early 1990s, then the whole nightclub dinner-theater thing started to change. So we’d have them come up and play Labor Day Monday night for four or five years in a row. I’d say 1995 was the last year they played for us.”\n\n“There were so many show lounges,” Melodye recalls. The Playboy Club in Lake Geneva in the early 1970s. The Pink Pony in Addison. The Club 89 in Omaha. Dinner shows. A lot of the bands that came through the Holiday Inn would do one-nighters, two-nighters, two or three a week. A spring and fall tour. They played conventions and high school auditoriums. The Elgin symphony backed up Dave for a show in Elgin. He backed up Louise Mandrell in Chicago. He did an opening show for Hal Linden. One-nighters where you’re setting up. Playing a show, tearing down and driving to Omaha or St. Louis for a couple of days. Then you’re setting up, playing a show, tearing down and driving again. That was exciting,” she laughs sarcastically.\n\nDave Major & the Minors even took to the seas before musical-themed cruises became what they are today. In March of 1978 the group was part of a package tour with comedians and other show bands that left Miami and sailed for a week on the Monarch Sun through Puerto Rico, Haiti and the Dominican Republic. The Monarch Sun was built in 1956 in Pascagoula, Mississippi. The Chicago supper-club band did a pre-cruise gig at the Del Rey Yacht Club north of Boca Raton. “It was tough loading our equipment on the ship,” keyboardist Palmer says, “I also remember drinks were $1.80.”\n\nDave Major & the Minors and then Onstage Majority worked at Diamond Jim’s in St. Paul, Minnesota. Supper came first, followed by the show. Jess says, “And when we were done everybody had to leave and another 250, 300 people would come in and eat dinner and watch the show.”\n\nMelodye enjoys reminiscing about Diamond Jim’s. “Oh my gosh, that place was crazy,” she says. “The bartenders had striped shirts and garters around their arms. There were peanut shells all over the floor. It was like an 1890s saloon. There was a tall ceiling and they had girls dressed in tiny costumes and they were on a trapeze. They’d come down from their knees and they would just reach the table tops so they could take tips from people. She’d extend her arm and just reach the customer’s shoulder. I’d think, ‘I want that job. That is so cool.’\n\n“There were a couple of rooms Perry [Dave Major] played for twenty years like Chula Vista in the Dells. He booked six weeks there every summer. The New Inn at Okoboji, Iowa. His second child was born in Okoboji. And our first child was born there almost twenty years later. The same doctor. Those were standing jobs. He’d renew every year. June and July was Okoboji. August and September was the Dells.”\n\nThe Chula Vista’s Kaminiski was friends with Dave Perry, who gave him guitar lessons when he was a youngster. “He played twenty-two different instruments and he was pretty good at most of them,” Kaminski says. “He was a true showman. But he was a know-it-all.” Drummer Beverly says, “Dave was almost like two people. The audience would see this nice, easygoing personality. The minute he would turn around out of the blue he’d say something like, ‘That damn asshole.’ His personality was difficult to understand.”\n\nKaminski never saw Perry’s dark side. “At the end of his life he was not performing nightly,” he says. “A couple of years before he died we saw him at a tiny bar around Naperville. We wanted to hire him for a weekend. He was with a two-piece band and clearly Dave Major & the Minors had declined. I’ll never forget there weren’t more than three people in this bar watching him. When we came in it was almost as if he didn’t want to see us because he was ashamed at where his career had ended up. I heard he was a security guard at a mall.”\n\nDick Jess moved in another direction.\n\nHe is a graduate of East Aurora High School. When he was growing up his mother Eleanor had him practice organ for one-half-hour a day. His music-loving father worked at Oberweis Dairy. After high school Jess attended Northern Illinois University in DeKalb. Jess joined Dave Major & the Minors as a horn player in 1965. He became the main trumpet player and taught the other band members to play trumpet.“ We did one thing where all four of us were not only playing trumpet but we had a second instrument,” Jess says. “So we had the sound of eight guys.” Beverly adds, “Sometimes the segues in our medleys were instrumentals. We’d all play a trombone part. That would give it a visual, with the [trombone] slides coming out. People would go, ‘Wow!’”\n\nJess and Beverly exited Dave Major & the Minors in 1969 when they were drafted. They obtained teacher deferments and started teaching school in the western suburbs. On the side they started Onstage Majority (Jess, Beverly and Roger Petersen, who was a student at Northwestern University). Beverly moved on to spend nineteen years as a salesman for W.W. Grainger industrial supply company, which he retired from in 2014. During the 1980s, Jess was a partner in Fame Productions, a performing-arts studio in unincorporated Deerfield. He booked bands for local weddings. And at night Jess played in a trio version of Onstage Majority in the speakeasy at the Gaslight Club at the Hilton O’Hare.\n\n“I was really busy,” he says. “But I had an offer that I didn’t take and kind of wish I had. The guy [Joe Kelly, who had the gig from 1981 until 2003] who was the bugler at Arlington Park Race Track wanted me to take over his job. Joe was a friend of mine. I had too much on my plate, but it would have been fun.” During the 1970s Kelly played in jazz bands with [Louis Armstrong drummer] Barrett Deems, Mike Hunniford and others.\n\nThe meshing of the supper-club world with the showroom had become an enduring magnet for Jess, Beverly and other early members of the scene. “Supper clubs had single organ players and piano players,” Jess says. “My mom was an organ player at supper clubs in the Aurora area. She wasn’t an on-the-road musician. She was an organ-piano teacher. For us, we did our same entertainment whether it was in a supper club or a show lounge. Chula Vista was a good example of a supper club although they didn’t call it a ‘supper club.’ Mike [Kaminski] is third generation. He was just a baby when we started working there. The first generation, Mr. Kaminski ran it and Mrs. Kaminski was the organ player. She was the entertainment. And it was a little place.”\n\nTom Dreesen has enjoyed a large life. The eighty-four-year-old comedian was raised in south suburban Harvey and attended Thornton Township High School. Dreesen spent fourteen years as the opening act for Frank Sinatra and appeared on “The Tonight Show” more than sixty times. He played the Playboy Club resort circuit and had heard of Dave Major & the Minors, but he did not know them.\n\nDreesen launched his career with Tim Reid in 1969 at the Party Mart Supper Club in South Chicago. Reid went on to appear as Venus Flytrap, the DJ on the long-running TV series “WKRP in Cincinnati.” “After that we went to the Golden Horseshoe Lounge in Chicago Heights which was owned by Eddie Warner,” Dreesen says on the phone from Los Angeles. “Again, a supper club. You could get at least one-hundred people in there. It had a big stage. They had four or five acts on the bill every night, including Eddie Warner who played a giant organ.”\n\nWarner played organ as part of a trio—his signature song was a psychedelic cover of the twelve-bar Jimmy Forrest R&B instrumental “Night Train.” Warner’s anthem was also the title track of his self-released 1969 album recorded at the Horseshoe. Warner always ended his set with “Night Train.” “The roof would go off,” Dreesen chuckles. “People went there for dinner and a show. There were two shows a night. That’s how we began. And the goal was to make it to the apex of the supper clubs in Chicago which was Mister Kelly’s. But you had to have at least fifteen, twenty minutes of material if you were going to be an opening act and at least an hour if you were going to be a headliner.”\n\nIn Ron Rapoport’s fine 2008 book “Tim & Tom (An American Comedy in Black and White),” the former Sun-Times columnist recalled the evening a Golden Horseshoe customer extinguished a lit cigarette in the face of Reid—a young Black man. Dreesen had been a boxer in the Navy. He delivered a right hand at the perpetrator in defense of his partner. The man pulled Dreesen under a table and Reid smacked the man over the head with a bottle of ketchup. Eddie “Night Train” Warner joined the fight and fell to the floor as a recipient of one of Dreesen’s errant punches. Order was eventually restored. Reid had a cigarette scar on his face. Dreesen had bloody knuckles. The attacker had some scratches. And Warner had a black eye.\n\nThe incident did not diminish Dreesen’s love of listening to music at the Midwest supper club.\n\n“A supper club was a great night out,” he says. “It was an adult night out. Not for families. Think of the cost. You pay for a babysitter. You drive downtown or wherever. You pay for parking. Reservations. If you want a good table you tip for a good table. After dinner come the drinks. It was an expensive night out, but it was an adult night out. Later there was competition. By 1965 there was Mill Run Theater in the round.”\n\nMill Run, a 1,600-seat theater in suburban Niles, opened in 1965 and was demolished in 1984. Comic Shecky Green opened the room and Chicago rhythm and blues singer Lou Rawls was the final act to perform at the Mill Run. When Tom Waits and his band appeared at the Mill Run on October 26, 1977, the theater came close to setting a record for liquor sales. Waits was asked to return but he declined, saying it was the first time he had worked in a venue where the patrons “didn’t vomit in the aisles.”\n\n“That Mill Run stage revolved,” Dreesen says. “When I performed there it was a madhouse. You’d say, ‘Good night everybody!’ and almost walk into the audience to get off stage. But you could bring the family. There wasn’t a bad seat. You didn’t have to pay for parking. You could see Sammy Davis, Jr.—topnotch acts.\n\n“Field’s Supper Club was the same thing. I did two shows a night there. People came for dinner. It wasn’t big. Maybe around one-hundred people. My dressing room was in the guy’s office. The thing to remember is for any opening act: if you were a singer you could sing over while people were eating. But they had to have food in and out at a certain time. For the most part, for the opening act people were eating dessert or the waiters were clearing the tables. It was hard. The food thing was always the toughest for opening acts. Singers can sing over while people are eating but they can’t create the mood that you can if you have an audience in the palm of your hand. ”\n\nTo hold the audience’s attention, Dave Major & the Minors, Onstage Majority and other show bands leaned into the popular brass-rock sound of the late 1960s and early seventies that included Blood, Sweat & Tears, Wayne Cochran and the C.C. Riders, Chicago and the successful regional rock-jazz band Chase that had the hit 1971 single “Get it On.” Bandleader-trumpet player Bill Chase died in a 1974 plane crash on route to play a county fair in Minnesota.\n\n“Wayne Cochran was doing kickass music,” Jess says. “Our goal was not to do kickass music. We were more interested in the show and doing a variety of things. One of our agents was the guy that owned Chase. We knew Bill Chase. The plane went down in Minnesota and we were working Okoboji in Iowa. It was like twenty miles away from the crash. And we [Onstage Majority] were closing our show with a Bill Chase song, ‘Handbags and Gladrags’ [written in 1967 by Mike d’Abo, lead singer of Manfred Mann] where I played the trumpet solo. I remember that night so distinctly. It was emotional. After the accident, the agent wanted me to go out as Chase. Because I was the trumpet player with that gravelly sound. I knew I wasn’t a good enough trumpet player to do what he did. I declined. I would have had to work too hard.”\n\nElmhurst native Gary Polkow was a member of New Odyssey for forty years. He played trumpet, slide trombone, bass trombone and keyboards. He also arranged songs. (His brother Dennis is a pianist and contributor to Newcity.) Polkow adds, “We did a lot of that type of music where we would play horns with one hand and another instrument with the other hand. When I was at York High School [in Elmhurst] we had a seven-piece band called Strapperjak that did a lot of that type of music. We played Lighthouse [which had the 1971 hit “One Fine Morning”], Chicago, and we wrote a lot of our own music. All of those guys went on to be in entertainment or the arts. One guy [Bob Skoney] ended up running the Nashville Municipal Auditorium. Another guy [Jeffrey Couchman] became a playwright in New York and also teaches screenplay writing.” And former Strapperjak bandmate Michael Salvatori went on to write the music for Halo, the video game. He composed music for the 2014 game Destiny and co-wrote some of the Hot City horn parts with Paul McCartney. Strapperjak trumpet player Curt Merrill recently retired as band director at York High School. “All of us ended up in the industry, which is interesting,” says Polkow, who is the accompanist for Montini Catholic High School in Lombard.\n\nGary Todd was the only original member of the bass-drums-keyboard trio Odyssey, which started in 1972 and grew into New Odyssey by 1978. Todd played drums. The original Odyssey gigged at smaller clubs such as the piano bar at Corrado’s on Rand Road in Arlington Heights, the Baker’s Wife cocktail lounge in the Pheasant Run Resort in St. Charles and the Golden Eagle Restaurant on Rand Road in Arlington Heights—purchased in 1977 by former Chicago Bear Ed O’Bradovich who renamed it Ed O’Bradovich’s Steak Seafood House. O’Bradovich knew Odyssey because he hung out at Corrado’s.\n\n“We were trying to get from the smaller lounges into nightclubs and dinner showrooms,” Todd says. “A supper club back then was any place to have a dinner and a show as opposed to just going to a showroom. You would play a dinner set and then a later set when people would dance. You would do covers for the dancing. But the shows were production numbers and novelty ideas. We had this thing called ‘The Monster Show’, which was a medley of tunes like the ‘Monster Mash.’ We wore cloaks, had black light, flame shooters and pyro. We did a ‘Star Wars’ medley. Back in the eighties Tom T. Hall’s ‘I Like Beer’ was a comedy routine, pretending like you were drunk. People came for dinner and they stayed all night. Drinking laws made a change. The ability to pay bigger bands with people not staying out all night got to be a big problem.”\n\nDuring this time, Dave Major & the Minors and Onstage Majority were working Chula Vista every summer. Was there competition? “A little bit,” Jess answers. “Because Dave Major & the Minors did more of an old-style thing. Onstage Majority was more contemporary. ‘Shaft’ was new. ‘Jesus Christ Superstar.’ Dave Major & the Minors weren’t doing that, they were still doing Louis Prima shuffles.”\n\nThe atomic-era charge of Louis Prima (1910-1978) and his raucous sideman Sam Butera (1927-2009) was a cornerstone of the supper-club-show-band sound. I interviewed Butera in 1987 in a small motel room before his lounge gig at the since-razed Tropicana Hotel in Las Vegas. The tenor saxophonist shared stories on his musical collaborations with Louis Prima and the Witnesses. He kept talking about “Gleeby rhythms,” which was the name of Prima’s first band. Prima and Butera teamed up on fast-paced nuggets like “Just a Gigolo/Ain’t Got Nobody,” “Jump Jive an’ Wail” and “You Rascal You.” Butera talked about how Johnny Carson would sit in on the drums late at night at the Casbar Theater at the Sahara and how Howard Hughes showed up for one show in a dirty brown suit and dirty sneakers. Like the Chicago supper-club show bands, Butera and Prima’s (and Prima’s wife Keely Smith) glitz often surpassed the music.\n\nBeverly remembers a colorful gig mid-1970s with Onstage Majority at the Pickwick House in Palatine. The back of the stage had a wall made of flagstone. “One night we were horsing around and I started climbing the wall,” Beverly recalls. “The band said, ‘What are you doing?’ I said, ‘I’m climbing Mount Prospect!’”\n\n“We played the Gaslight Club at the Hilton O’Hare,” says Jess. That was a speakeasy. We were there for four years. The gaslight girls would sing with us. It’s pretty undercover. I don’t know why. Maybe there’s a lot of reasons why. I don’t want to get into that. There was Field’s Supper Club at 104th and Cicero [in Oak Lawn]. We worked the [Drury Lane Theater] Martinique Restaurant in Evergreen Park.”\n\nThe supper-club music scene also furnished a smorgasbord of oddball DIY albums.\n\nThe Onstage Majority debut album was 1971’s “Solo Flight.” The 1975 release had no official title but the cover was bathed in red. So they called it “The Red Album.” That project included wildly diverse covers such as Dionne Warwick’s “Then Came You,” Bach’s “Toccata and Fugue” and a loungy version of “Theme from Shaft.” Jess says, “Well, the wah-wah pedal with the guitar was the new thing at the time. And the major sound of ‘Shaft’ was the wah-wah pedal. I would demonstrate what the wah-wah pedal was and work it in conjunction with the guitar. I’d set it up with the audience before we did it.”\n\nA nearly ten-minute “Jesus Christ Superstar” medley is the final track on side two of “The Red Album.” “That was an amazing experience,” Jess says. “We jumped on that early in the game and offended so many people. Including my parents. We had priests that would walk out on our show. They thought it was sacrilegious, that we were making fun of God. We didn’t feel that way. I was brought up strict Baptist. ‘Jesus Christ Superstar’ was the exact gospel I had been taught, except with contemporary music.”\n\nThe Onstage Majority also neglected to title their third and final album. It had a white cover and “The White Album” was released in 1977. “We arranged songs in every way imaginable,” Jess explains. “Any of us who wanted to put the time in to do an arrangement. Everybody brought something in, whether they had to write it out or learn it by rote. By the time we got on stage they morphed into something different. We also hired people to do arrangements for us. We had a medley of all Beach Boys songs—we hired a guy to do a transcription of all Beach Boys material. We had a guy in Des Moines, Iowa who did arranging for us. He did a trombone solo for me, ‘Slaughter on Tenth Avenue.’ Roger Petersen has a very organized mind. One of our best pieces was a medley of ‘Jesus Christ Superstar’ when it first came out. He did a super job of putting that together. He also did a medley of ‘Fiddler on the Roof’.”\n\nGary Polkow says that New Odyssey learned to hustle to play these songs. Sometimes the band was given only a half-hour set. “So we’d put together a Beatles medley in which we would play ten songs in ten minutes with thirty different instruments,” he says. “We also did a Blue Man Group kind of thing with [the trippy 1968 Iron Butterfly hit] ‘In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida.’ Instead of doing a seventeen-minute drum solo, the three of us came out and did a drum line. But it was condensed.”\n\nThe supper-club show bands performed during a period of American political turmoil. But Bob Dylan and the Chambers Brothers were not in their repertoire. “We didn’t do songs that were politically motivated,” Beverly says. “We didn’t pay attention to that. We were trying to entertain people. We wanted to generate excitement. ‘Jesus Christ Superstar’ (1971) was all horns and big vocals. It was quite moving. We had people come up afterwards and say, ‘Wow, I’ve never heard a band anyplace do that kind of music. We took pride in that.”\n\n“We covered [the politically tinged 1968 anthem] ‘Someday’ by Chicago, but that would be before New Odyssey,” New Odyssey’s Gary Polkow adds. We would stay away from anything that leaned right or left. Very seldom was anyone offended by what we did. That was the line we would walk and it was intentional.”\n\nOne of the more colorful members of ROMEO is Dennis Koppo, a drummer and internationally known Donald Trump impersonator. Koppo is a seventy-three-year-old Humboldt Park native who has played drums for fifty years. He was best known for his 1970s work with future New Odyssey bassist Michael Jay (Fiddick) in the band Show Biz Kids. They were popular on the Midwest supper club and Holiday Inn circuit. “It was the Bee Gees, the ‘Saturday Night Fever’ stuff,” Koppo says. “It was more of a dance-oriented orientation than a show band or a supper-club act. We did showbiz things with a dance presentation. Maybe we’d do one Stones tune, but you could dance to it if you wanted to.” Koppo also played jazz on off-nights at the BackRoom on Rush Street, but he was never a headliner. He played with cabaret-pop singer Nan Mason at the BackRoom and also in a semi-jazz trio at The Flame Steak House in Oakbrook Terrace—that burned down in 1979.\n\nJay’s journey began as rhythm guitarist for the 1960s rock band Mogan, named as a tribute to Mogen David wine. That band’s circuit included the Cellar in Arlington Heights and other suburban teen clubs. The bass-drums-guitar-saxophone sound touched on Grand Funk Railroad with horns. Jay says, “After that I got into a show band that was put together by a group of four or five people who were going to buy a building and build a show lounge in West Chicago. We did end up on the road. That was Show Biz Kids.” The five-piece group consisted of piano, bass, drums, keyboard, bass and female lead singer Laurie Corbin.\n\n“Dennis put on a show,” Jay says. “He sang and played drums. Everybody had to sing. But it was all about our lead singer. She carried the heavy load. The show portion of what we did had dissipated into more of a dance band but some of those [show] numbers made us even more popular. In a show band you demand the attention of the audience for the visual part as well as audio—which could be comedy, music, like ‘The Ed Sullivan Show.’ The audience is not there to dance or talk with each other or meet someone. You sit down and watch and listen. We played disco. Most of the musicians complained about it. The rhythm was always the same. Most of the time it was boring, but if you wanted to survive in the business, that’s what you did. We did Donna Summer, Gloria Gaynor, Kool & the Gang.”\n\nShow Biz Kids ran from 1973 through 1977. Jay joined New Odyssey in May of 1978. The band performed under the tagline “3 Guys/30 Instruments.” “That was life-changing,” he says. “That was what I did until 2018. We played all over the country, all types of venues. Nightclubs evolved into corporate jobs that evolved into festivals and tours of theaters. Old movie houses. We’d do twenty-eight jobs in thirty days, come home for a month and go out and do it again.”\n\nPolkow considers the 1978 beginning of New Odyssey the end of the regular supper-club music circuit. “One of the reasons we survived was because we slowly started doing one-nighters, corporate gigs,” he says. “Then we started three or four months a year with corporate gigs. Soon we got out of supper clubs and started doing all corporate. Until the corporate started drying up. 9/11. Then in 2008 it was bad with the real estate crunch. It just kept getting worse, so we made the switch to fairs and festivals and concerts, even though we were doing some of that all along. That got bigger. We were also at the end of disco. At the beginning we were doing a lot of disco music. Show bands would go into a supper club and work a dance set or an easy-listening set, then you would put on a show for an hour, sometimes a second show for an hour and then you would play dance music the rest of the night. In order to have staying power, your dance music needed to be as strong as your show music. We excelled in learning a lot of strong techno-disco music. We were big in analog synthesis [sound waves changing voltages in a circuit], FM synthesis and incorporated it into our act. We would run our own sound. It was difficult because we had to do the sound from the stage and learn to have to send out the same mix we were listening to that people were hearing. Not an ideal situation. We learned to do that over the years.”\n\nIt is arresting when a visitor walks into a ROMEO meeting in a northwest suburban restaurant and sees the former Show Biz Kids drummer Koppo, who looks very much like Donald Trump commiserating with the old members of New Odyssey and Dave Major & the Minors. Of course he wears a red baseball cap to most meetings to accent the MAGA vibe. Koppo deploys a drawn-out Trump tempo when he speaks. He has visited twelve countries as a Trump impersonator and was featured in a Vanity Fair magazine layout a month before the 2016 election. I had a difficult time concentrating every time I talked to him. “People said I looked like Trump before he became a politician,” he says. “I produced a couple television shows for the Naperville Community Television station. So I had access to the studio. When he announced his candidacy I said, ‘What the hell?’ There’s a Barnes & Noble in downtown Naperville. I had someone interview me on the escalator there [like when Trump announced his candidacy in 2015 in New York City]. I went in the studio and did a [Trump] speech. I put it on my YouTube channel. About three weeks later I get a call from a casting agency in Hollywood. First I thought it was a joke. But it took off from there.”\n\nThe show-band experience has fueled the Trump experience. “It gave me a leg up because I was used to performing in front of people,” he explains. “A lot of times impersonators look like the person but have no experience in show business. I still made a lot of rookie mistakes [in the Trump acting role], but I had the advantage of being comfortable in front of an audience. I did a campaign ad for Joe Biden. A skit on the Bill Maher show. Sometimes it’s a curse. Even people who are in show business and who know I’m just an actor will treat me like Donald Trump. One time I was in Finland and people thought I looked so much like Trump there was demonstrations.”\n\nROMEO satellite member Terry Diers was in the Esquires and the second version of Dave Major & the Minors from 1969 to 1971. “Dave and Dick Perry were in school in 1963,” he says in a phone conversation from Indianapolis. “They were rock ‘n’ roll musicians, guitar and bass. I was a trumpet player. I tended more toward jazz. They asked me to play in their band and ‘convert us more into a jazz band than a rock band.’ The last thing a jazz guy wants to hear is ‘convert us.’ That never works. I played some gigs with them and it was fine, but they were rock guys just starting out.” So Diers went on the road with the Esquires and never returned to NIU for his senior year. “Two months in, I met the girl of my dreams and got drafted in the same week,” says Diers, eighty-two. “That was the end of my career with Dave Sandee and the Esquires.” His new career was a gig in the U.S. Army band.\n\nAfter a three-and-a-half-year stint in the Army, the Perry twins called Diers again. “Now they were Dave Major & the Minors,” he says. “They were losing Beverly and Jess. They were going to get drafted and they took teaching jobs. The twins replaced those two guys with a keyboard player, a new drummer and me on brass.”\n\nAlong with dozens of other supper-club acts and show bands, Dave Major & the Minors existed in a DIY world. They designed their own stage outfits, they made independent records and they even traveled in a unique style. Each band member had a thirty-two-foot Holiday Rambler travel trailer. “We camped,” Diers says. “That way we could take the kids and not live in motels. It sounds hokey, but it was practical. We traveled long distances, but we only moved once a month. We had a fan in Elgin who owned a trailer park. In winter he always had spaces available. He let us use them, big concrete pads. And we’d park the trailers on the pads. The kids had a place to play. We had phones and city water put in. The entire band was in the same place. Five different trailers. When we pulled into town it was like a circus. Our agent would only book us in the Chicago area for the winter so we wouldn’t have to haul the trailers around. One time in Rochester, Minnesota it was cold as hell with a foot of snow on the ground. Dave LeMire’s [Dave Major organ player circa 1969 to 1973] sewer system on his trailer froze so they could not use the toilet. He and I took turns laying on our backs under the trailer trying to thaw the pipes with a propane torch. My comment was, ‘If our fans could see us now.’”\n\nThe extravagant nature of the Chicago-area show-band show business was accented by wardrobes from another planet. At one point Onstage Majority carried thirteen different sets of stage clothes. “Dave Major & the Minors did a similar thing,” Jess says. “It was very important. A lot of them we got at Smoky Joe’s [on Maxwell Street]. There were racks of clothes and we had five guys and they had all our sizes. You can’t get that at Sears. It was terrific. This had to be sixty-five or sixty-six. We designed others ourselves. We got with a guy that represented the company that made the suits. He would show us our options. We’d say we wanted the pleated leg on the bottom, whatever. The inside would be white or red. Maybe we’d want white club buttons.\n\n“We had them custom-made in Hong Kong. If we needed four purple ones, four plaid ones, we’d have to turn to Hong Kong. You couldn’t find suits like that. Not that you’d want them! They’d be made overseas and then we’d bring them in to have them tailored.” Beverly recalls, “The Hong Kong guy would come to the states a couple times a year and get a room at the Sheraton O’Hare where we would get measured. We’d pick our style suits to be specially made—stitching, pleated bell bottoms, pocket style and so on.” The bands would have their new suits in four to six weeks. When the Jackson 5 were starting in Gary, Indiana, their earliest outfits were made at Smoky Joe’s, which closed in the early 1980s but revived in 2011. The late great Wayne Cochran would buy outfits at Smoky Joe’s on South Halsted when he was in town appearing on Rush Street.\n\nGary Polkow says, “We used to go to Irv’s a lot. Smoky Joe’s was big for us, but Irv’s was more of a conservative, standard suit which is what we ended up doing a lot as a show band. We’d dress in blues, lime greens, purples. We had a guy at Irv’s who was great at matching ties with the shirts.”\n\nIrv’s was a family menswear chain that thrived from the 1950s until 2009. At one time Irv’s had four stores in the Chicago area. The last store to close was in Prospect Heights. Besides New Odyssey, notable Irv’s customers included Chicago Bears Hall of Famer Mike Singletary and former Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert.\n\nThe legion of musical outfits was necessary because the bands often did three shows nightly. Many clubs would turn over the room for a new audience. Jess explains, “Every show we would come back out with completely different costumes and different material. We didn’t do sets. Everything was a show. We’d change outfits three times a night. We worked hard enough that we’d sweat through with what we were wearing. Those lights were hot. Some of the suits were polyester. You’d have to take six [outfits] in every week to get them cleaned. One guy was in charge of just running out the list of suits you were going to wear that week so you had an opportunity to get the other ones into the cleaners. Not only did you have thirteen suits, but you had thirteen pairs of shoes because each outfit had its own shoes.”\n\nNew Odyssey’s Todd says, “We were about ten years later. We did the suit-change thing but we never had the turnover crowds. It was always a warm-up set—it would be softer and subtle—a show set that would be the big production, comedy and specialty arrangements. You would use props. I used to do a thing in drag. We did ‘The William Tell Overture’ and we’d all put on these big [cowboy] hats. Then you would flop your hats to the music. Jim Beverly did a ten-to-fifteen-minute introduction to [the 1966 Otis Redding hit] ‘Try a Little Tenderness.’ There was always a presentation to the music, a dance set then a second late-night show. We did that show for the people who were staying late.” Each show segment ran from forty-five minutes to an hour. Jess adds, “We worked a lot of rooms where we didn’t do dance music at all. We were not there for people to dance to us.”\n\nOf course the sharp-dressed men had to show off their threads.\n\nFor that they turned to studio photographers in the Chicago area. None were bigger than Maurice Seymour Photography, the “Photographer of the Stars.” Seymour (1900-1993) photographed burlesque dancers and ballerinas. They set up a portable studio at the Palmer House and photographed celebrities and performers who were traveling through Chicago. Their portfolio included Harry Belafonte, Bob Hope and Bing Crosby.\n\nAnd Dave Major & the Minors.\n\n“Maurice was from the old country,” Jess says. When you were there getting your picture taken and he’d put you in a position, you did not move. This guy would yell and go ballistic. He scared the shit out of us. It was an honor to have your picture taken by him. We were all goofballs. Anything for a laugh. Except when we were getting our picture taken. Maurice Seymour was a scary dude.”\n\nActually, there were two “Maurice Seymours.” The brothers Maurice and Seymour Zeldman arrived in Chicago in 1920 from Russia. They did an apprenticeship at Bloom’s Studios in the State-Lake Building before opening their own studio in 1929 atop the St. Clair Hotel—the former Inn of Chicago and today the Hotel St. Clair—on 162 East Ohio. Maurice once called Bloom “The Maurice Seymour of his day.” The brothers shared the same dramatic flair in photography, so their styles were hard to differentiate. But after they left the St. Clair in 1955, Maurice operated the parent studio at 111 East Chicago. His brother moved to New York to establish a studio—and then changed his name to Maurice Seymour.\n\n“He had the old camera with the drape and the box,” Todd says. His touch-up was so great. You could see the skin tone.” Maurice Seymour took promo shots for New Odyssey, Onstage Majority and Dave Major & the Minors. Todd says, “This was the guy that all the entertainers went to. I was seventeen, so that would have been around 1972.” Another Maurice Seymour photo featured a long gasoline pump going left to right through the collective ears of Dave Major and the Minors. Beverly brought the pump to the photo shoot as a prop to illustrate how the band was full of gas. “My son took the same picture and did it for his country band’s promo,” Jess says. “They had a band called State Line.”\n\nBy the mid-1970s, other supper-club acts migrated to Chicago photographer Irv Bolber. New Odyssey was created in 1978. At the beginning it was a three-piece group that played thirty instruments. Todd wore an electrically charged drum suit with six triggers. New Odyssey bassist-guitarist Michael Jay says, “You had to have promo pictures. We always had over twenty-five instruments and we would pose accordingly. The first photos were done by Bolber in Chicago. The cover of our first album was his photo of posing with all our instruments. We actually laid on the floor of the studio and they laid the instruments on us.”\n\nWith the music, clothes and photographs wrapped into a dazzling package, the bands needed someone to book them into supper clubs and showrooms. That was the Don Faber Agency out of Skokie. “Dave Major & the Minors and Onstage Majority were his two main groups,” Beverly says. “He had other local bands that he’d book for lesser money. He’d sit down and fill a room up for a year in one afternoon, like Dave Major & the Minors will be here January and August, Onstage Majority in February and November and then he’d fill in with other acts. He got groups from New York, California, anywhere through other agents.\n\n“Don Faber was a fantastic tool that we used a lot, Jess says. “He always wore a suit and never drank. He was a good-looking guy. He was very organized and he knew how to manage young talent. Which we were. And we were not very business-savvy. He’d give us a non-musical opinion on what to do, but he did take a personal interest. We owe a lot of our successes—whatever that might be—to the fact that he was an older guy. He started us out doing a mailing list when we were in our twenties. It cost us a lot of money and it was a lot of work because it was all handwritten, but it was a smart thing to do. We would send our itinerary out to 25,000 people, so people would know we were coming.”\n\nBeverly adds, “We had table tents on the tables and people could sign up,” Beverly adds. We’d send them announcements of where we were going to be. That was another way of connecting with our audience.The owners loved it. We drew crowds. And that was simply through Don Faber.”\n\n“Faber had a bunch of bands,” Melodye recalls. He’d take twenty percent. I saw him at all the shows. I’d go to his office in Skokie to pick up albums, schedules and promo things. Table tents, matchbooks, pins and golf balls. He’d send out a mailing list every three months. People would show up from Omaha, Wisconsin, Chicago. Pretty soon you would lose touch with where they lived unless you got to know them.”\n\nFaber even had a hand in helping construct Chicago-area showrooms. Todd says, “He’d go into the club owner and say, ‘I’ve got groups to come in and do shows for you but I’m going to need to put up a curtain and need ten spotlights with a box so they can turn them on and off. There also was a guy named Harry Breen who was like Broadway Danny Rose. He even had the bow tie. He was trying to compete with Don Faber. He’d come to our band [New Odyssey] and say, ‘I want to be your Don Faber and you be my Dave Major & the Minors.’ He was one of those old-school variety-act agents.” Breen’s wife Celeste was a Chicago-area magician who choreographed the first New Odyssey album cover with the musicians sprawled out with all their instruments.\n\n“There used to be a building at 203 North Wabash where all those variety-act agents were,” Todd continues. “Marcus Glaser, he handled jugglers, musicians. Charlie Hogan handled Bob Hope’s appearances. He never talked to any of us. He was dealing in bigger stuff.” Hope was introduced to Hogan, who was booking acts into Chicago movie houses. He then booked Hope into a theater at Halsted and 65th Street where he played for six months. When Hogan died in 1970 at age sixty-eight, Hope gave the funeral eulogy.\n\nChicago brothers Al and Max Borde were agents during the waning days of the supper-club lounge scene. Max specialized in lounge acts and Al did the variety acts. Todd recalls, “It was after vaudeville disappeared and they called it the variety field.”\n\nAfter New Odyssey left Faber in the late 1970s, the band landed at the Navarone in Elk Grove Village. The Navarone was a supper club at Higgins Road and Route 83 that looked like a spaceship. During the early 1980s the Suburban Sun-Times had an office within walking distance of the Navarone. I was a Suburban Sun-Times writer at that time and wandered over there when we felt like leaving our little planet.\n\nBesides New Odyssey, the Navarone featured rock-oriented show bands like the Mob and Moses and The Highbrows. Moses and the Highbrows were a sextet from the Philippines that had appeared at the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas, the Copacabana in Japan and in Miami Beach, before landing in Elk Grove Village. Moses and his band even recorded a live album “Happy-Ning at the Navarone,” on their Foreign Devil Records, that included covers like the Johnny Nash reggae ballad “I Can See Clearly Now,” Tony Orlando and Dawn’s “Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree” and Little Richard’s “Tutti Frutti.”\n\nTodd recalls that Sam, the owner, “ended up managing the acts that went through there. He called me down one afternoon to talk to me. I was doing booking for the band. We went into the banquet room which was empty and all the lights were off. He pulled the chair around and declared he wanted to manage us. I was scared. He had the ‘reputation.’ And there was a place called the Athens Club.”\n\nThe Athens Supper Club was at 4726 North Western in Chicago. During the 1970s, celebrities like Telly Savalas found their way to the Athens for dinner and live music. The Athens presented two floor shows nightly and three on Saturday. Balconies surrounded two sides of the room and the supper club included a private bar. “Marina” was one of the most exotic belly dancers on North Western Avenue.\n\n“This guy also owned the Grand Plaza on Mannheim [in Rosemont],” Todd says. The Grand Plaza was a hotel with an outdoor swimming pool and downstairs VIP lounge. Todd continues, “He was running old-school stuff. We worked for him at the end. You’d go to the guy’s office and there’s a picture of him with Mayor Daley and that politician thing. We sat down after a Saturday night at the Athens. We worked five nights, and he said, ‘I’m not going to be able to pay you this week.’ We said, ‘Okay.’ You know? There would be a line of girls [Greek dancers], a stand-up comedian and us. And sometimes there would be three people in the place. They had Greek bands in there. We fried all our equipment there because we plugged in and it was all wired for European circuits. Nobody told us. The first night we played there we turned on and bzzzzt… There went all our stuff.”\n\nThe Tumbling Todds were a Chicago-based family act that appeared with Steve Allen, Rosemary Clooney and Vic Damone. Gary Todd began his entertainment career at the age of two as an acrobat in the group and the show business DNA has remained with him his entire life. “That put me in my own lane,” Todd says. “While everybody else was studying music and playing in bands, I was tumbling my way across the country with a dog act.” Todd has been married for forty years and has two children. Todd met his wife Sandy at the old Pickwick House in Palatine. She was dating Hal Delavan (1945-2011), the vocalist-trombonist for the Chicago-area show band The Brite Set.\n\n“I was brought up in a show-business family,” Todd continues. “My father was a vaudevillian. We traveled all over. We were like gypsies. We had a trailer. I was born in Seattle but we settled in the Chicago area around 1960. It was a good place for variety acts like we were. Acrobats. My dad was a comedian. He was a dancer in vaudeville. It was like a circus-type act although we weren’t really a circus act. I traveled so much as a kid I was home-schooled. I tumbled my whole life. That’s why I have two hip replacements and two knee surgeries. When we were doing our family act and when we didn’t have work my dad would take us, three boys like eight, ten, twelve, and we’d go sit in the waiting room of the Borde office. Then when the phone would ring with someone looking for an act, they’d go, ‘Well I got the Todd family here.’ Don [Faber] was more of the musical lounge thing.”\n\nThe chain of events with Dave Major & the Minors left Melodye with a permanent hurt. Time will never heal all of her wounds. “I didn’t know anybody in that town [Kingston],” she says. “There were only 800 people there. Two or three years later when I ventured out they knew who I was. Everybody on the street would whisper when I walked by. I also talked to a lot of people who couldn’t believe that’s who that was who did the shooting. Because they all had heard of Dave Major & the Minors. Somebody said, ‘Oh, I saw that car drive through the neighborhood a lot.’ He had a big white Lincoln Town Car and it stood out like a sore thumb in Kingston, which was all pick-up trucks.”\n\n“You don’t get over something like this. You learn to live with it. It took me a long, long time. I was in a puddle for fourteen years. I sat on a couch for two years. Then I got a job at a local veterinarian. Then I got another job at another veterinarian. I had seventeen animals in Kingston when my husband died. A lot of them were outside. I had a Burmese python. I had four cats, three big dogs. A big snake. A potbellied pig. In 1990 I had my pig in my apartment in Bloomingdale. Now I have eleven cats and two giant Caucasian Shepherds. Jozo dogs. I had them shipped here from Russia. They’re 225 pounds each. I love all animals. I was deprived of them as a kid. Living as an Army brat—I lived on base for seventeen years—you couldn’t have animals. I’d sneak them in the house. After the shooting, I was working for three different animal hospitals at once in Genoa, Elgin and Dundee. That was my therapy. I worked until my son finished high school and went straight into the Army. I sold the house, moved to a smaller place and kept working. I had to get out of town. I think there’s a reason for all of it. I don’t know what it is yet.”\n\nThe monthly lunch meetings of ROMEO can include anywhere from four to fifteen spritely supper-club-era musicians. They spot-weld their memories with the challenges of senior citizens. A standing ovation really means something at the ROMEO club. There are knee replacements, shoulder surgeries, talk of new diabetes drugs and Jess, who has survived three heart attacks. “And a cardiac arrest [in 2012] where I died,” he says. “So I haven’t done anything musically for seven years. But now I’m rehearsing every day. Playing guitar, keyboard and trombone. Breathing things like singing and playing the wind instruments is tough. But I’m challenged by it.”\n\nTodd still performs in a solo act as The New Odyssey Guy. Jess still performs at small bars and VFWs around the Chain of Lakes. “I do a single act,” he says. “I get up every day and play trumpet, saxophone and guitar. Just to maintain the chops. It’s a commitment, especially if you’re not working five or six nights a week like we were back in the day. It’s funny, mostly in my whole career I was the kid, the young guy. Now in this circuit, I’m the old guy.”\n\nThe show must go on.\n\nDave Hoekstra is the author of “The Supper Club Book: A Celebration of a Midwest Tradition” [2013, Chicago Review Press.] He will be guest speaker at 5:30pm, March 16 as part of the 2024 Supper Club series at the Landing at Hoyt Park, 1800 North Swan Boulevard in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin."
