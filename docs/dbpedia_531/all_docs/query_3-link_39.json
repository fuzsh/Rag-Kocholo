        "text": "Brittany Fholer\n\nThere are few men like Richard Mangham left in the world. He is an artist who uses trees as his canvas and saws and sandpaper as his paint brush and a woodworker who loves making furniture the way they did 100 years ago. He is a stark contrast to his fellow residents of Argyle, a town north of Fort Worth with a population of 3,489 as of 2012 and full of several “master planned” communities full of expensive homes.\n\nRich Mangham grew up in the “old” Argyle, before the fancy million dollar homes. The population of the area was around 500 and Argyle and Bartonville were all considered the same place. He grew up learning how to hunt and trap and fish and was one of about 39 in his 9th grade class. Everyone went to school in one building and grades 6th through 9th were all in the same hall.\n\nMangham, like most of the students in Argyle, went to Denton High School, and in the wintertime, Mangham and his friends would bring their shotguns to school and leave them in their trucks after checking their traps in the morning. At lunchtime, they would skin whatever they caught that morning in the church parking lot where they parked and rolled up the pelts to put them in their freezer when they got home.\n\n“I’ve lived here since my parents moved here in ’68. It was a completely different community then. It was wilderness,” Mangham says. “You didn’t have million dollar homes. People were farmers. It was the complete opposite of what it is today.”\n\nNobody had swimming pools back then, he says. If they wanted to swim, they swam in the ponds.\n\n“My wife thinks that’s crazy,” he says. “We’ll go to the ranch, and the boys will want to go swimming. We’ve got six ponds out there with crystal clear water and she’s like ‘Oh my God. No. They can’t swim in that.’ We did it all of our lives. That’s just what we did.”\n\n*****\n\nIn his final two years of high school, Mangham worked on a horse farm in Aubrey, called Gooch Quarter Horses. He rode bucking horses on the Denton High Rodeo team and thought was what he wanted to do for a career.\n\n“When I was in high school on rodeo team, I thought I’d be world champion bronc rider,” Mangham says. “But then it started hurting. And when it started hurting, I was like, ‘Man, these guys are stupid [for doing this].’”\n\nHe joined a friend working as a manager of a recording studio founded in a guy’s garage off of Farm Road 1171, a major road that runs through Argyle. When the man who owned the studio created a record label and moved to the West Coast, Mangham and his friend, who was the chief engineer, bought the studio from him and moved it to the Longhorn Ballroom in Dallas.\n\nHe sold his half to his partner and moved to the East Coast to work for Pace Concerts where he worked on big shows and met a lot of rock stars.\n\n“I can’t explain it,” he says. “It was an incredible life. I got to see everything, but I wanted a home, so I came back to Argyle. This is where I came.”\n\nHe joined forces with a friend who was a custom house painter.\n\n“I had never painted a house before in my life but it was something to do with your hands,” Mangham says. “I’m not the sit behind the desk. I’m a hands-on kind of guy. I get some type of fulfillment seeing what I’ve done.”\n\nThe friend taught him how to paint and Mangham ended up painted for him for about a year before he started his own painting business, getting crews together and doing carpentry work.\n\nMangham is one of the dwindling numbers of “original” residents still living in Argyle. He’s one of the few who lived in Argyle when it was still small town and country, he says. People move to Argyle to get the small town feel but, despite the fact that Argyle still has a population of over 3,000 and has very few businesses, Mangham says, “They’ve citified it.”\n\nMost of the people living in Argyle have transplanted from other areas in search of a more relaxed living situation, to get the small town feel advertised by the city’s website. Residents have come from Dallas, Fort Worth, Frisco, and other large cities to retire in Argyle and to get away or to just have a place to live away from the hustle of those bigger cities.\n\n“Properties are expensive and there’s not a lot of businesses in Argyle so most of the people aren’t working- they might work out of their home but their job isn’t in Argyle typically,” says Denise Sizelove, a customer and longtime friend of Mangham. “If you know him [Rich]- and there was a point in Argyle where you knew everybody, but that isn’t the case anymore- but if you know him, you respect him.”\n\nHe has been labeled “out of the box” by clients and close friends such as Steven Moore, a fellow Argyle resident. His brother Ray Mangham agrees with that label.\n\n“He is as honest as the day is long,” Ray Mangham says. “He doesn’t have a filter, so what you see is what you get, but what you get is a great human being.”\n\nIf he had anyone who disliked him, it would probably be due to the fact that he is so honest, Ray says.\n\nHe stands out in a town full of people living in recently built quarter-million to million dollar subdivision homes. His own home, on Frenchtown Road, which his studio sits behind, has been there since 1949. Mangham knew the previous family who lived there and in fact bought the home from the person who built it.\n\nHis greying hair is long enough to be pulled into a pony tail when he works and his clothes are always covered in something, paint or lacquer or glue or sawdust.\n\n“People think I don’t ever do laundry or wear clean clothes,” he laughs. “[My wife] Mitzi does the laundry and the back of my shirt is always pristine and shows it.”\n\n******\n\nInside Mangham’s studio, called A’Dreyia Studios, are dozens of pieces of tree trunks, either cut in half or just as stumps, waiting to be made into fireplace mantles, one of the things Mangham seems to specialize in. He sits down on a bar stool in his workshop, with walls covered in deer, elk and antelope heads, a few mounted fish, a fox pelt, and photo frames that he personally made from tree trunks with pictures of his sons in them.\n\nMangham makes his living off of building and creating things out of trees. He makes it clear that he isn’t the type of guy who is comfortable doing cookie cutter style woodwork. He says he can’t do cabinetry for that reason.\n\n“I guess the way I think is, I’m not one of those guys who just goes to Home Depot and buys everything because it’s already done,” Mangham says. “I mean, literally, I cut trees down.”\n\nHe knows what he’s looking for, which is to build something, he says. “I’ll literally go into the woods and find that one tree that I need,” Mangham says. “And then there’s times that I can’t find that tree and I do have stuff here.”\n\nHe has a room in his workshop full of hundreds of slabs of wood, mostly mesquite, and tree stumps for customers to choose for their mantles or tables if they want. When customers order something, Mangham will drag some of those pieces out.\n\n“It might take me a month of looking at stuff before the two pieces I need come together and I see it,” Mangham says. “I literally go in the woods and see what I need and that’s what I do. Sometimes I have to pull out pieces numerous times and just keep trying to match them together and match them together and then when it happens, it happens, and it’s immediate. When I put them together, I know right then, that’s what I’m looking for.”\n\nIt takes him ten 10 times longer to do cabinet work because of the way he puts pieces together, he says.\n\n******\n\nIn the workshop full of the outdoors, he points to a Mesquite root ball that has been lacquered. It has a stuffed pheasant inside of the hollowed center and there is a 4-foot glass piece that goes over the top, turning it into a coffee table.\n\n“That was hand-sanded for three weeks with a piece of sand paper and oil rubbed into it, sanded into it,” Mangham says. “One of the first pieces I ever built. But I see stuff like that. Where everybody else sees four legs and a top, I don’t see that.”\n\nHe says he has built stuff like that but it’s had kind of a twist to it.\n\n“I’m not an Amish [person] or professional carver raised like that where everything’s square,” Mangham says. “I like the way that [table] looks. I see- That’s Mother Nature, that’s the way she intended that. And I just like putting that stuff together like that. It comes natural to me.”\n\nMangham’s tables and mantles are all made by him and him alone. The longest it’s ever taken him to make a piece was 10 months. It was a 16-foot long, 4-foot wide, 2-inch thick dining room table. It was featured in the Cross Timbers Gazette in 2010.\n\n“I don’t laminate plywood,” Mangham says. “All my stuff’s built like it was 100 years ago.”\n\nHe does hand rub finishes where he rubs on a piece of wood with oil and sandpaper for a week to get the perfect finish.\n\nHe’s run into a couple problems, as most woodworkers will, with fingers and saws. Awhile back, he managed to cut his index finger and thumb on a table saw, with his thumb being sliced clean off. He found his thumb a few weeks later when his wife picked it up off the floor of the studio. He didn’t let losing his thumb and nearly losing a finger stop him from working though. Winter and fall are his biggest selling seasons, especially with the wooden crosses he makes which he says women will line up and fill his shop waiting to buy one or two of for Christmas presents.\n\nMangham is the only one who does work like his in Argyle but there are other woodworkers in the North Texas area. He counts one of them, Bill Marcus, as a close friend and mentor. He describes him as “rough country.”\n\n“He’s got a white beard, long hair, rough country,” Mangham says. “Good as they come, honest, hard-working. My wife says, ‘That’s you. In 15 years, that’s you.”\n\nMangham says Marcus does everything he does but has been doing it longer. Marcus restores log cabins across Texas, from the mid to late 19th century.\n\n“I do a lot of woodworking myself and I build furniture too,” Marcus says. “But he [Mangham] is 10 times better than I am. He is a hell of an artist. He’s the best woodworker I know, the most artistic woodworker I know.”\n\nSome of the pieces Mangham has made:\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript."
