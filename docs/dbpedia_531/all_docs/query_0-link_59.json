        "text": "More About Us\n\nJackson State University’s Department of Political Science helps students combine theoretical creativity and empirical research. Among the department’s areas of strength are American politics, comparative politics (particularly African politics), international relations, and public law. The department’s faculty uses diverse analytic perspectives, but their research programs share a common concern for the role of citizenship in government, political processes, and institutions.\n\nThe Fannie Lou Hamer National Institute of Advocacy & Social Action, cosponsored by the department, conducts summer seminars on the civil rights movement as a model of participatory democracy.\n\n“Challenging Minds, Changing Lives.”\n\nAPPLY YOUR KNOWLEDGE\n\nInternational exchanges and travel are available to faculty and students via the Jackson State University Office of International Programs and the Mississippi Consortium for International Development.\n\nREADY TO JOIN?\n\nFor more information, please contact us at (601) 979-2135. We look forward to meeting with you and seeing how our program can help you achieve your goals."
