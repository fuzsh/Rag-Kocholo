        "text": "© Robert L. Campbell\n\nNEW: May 23, 2024\n\nRevision note:\n\nThe Stepheny label opened (on a boutique basis) in 1956, ramped up production in the summer of 1957, peaked in 1958, slid back down through 1960 (for singles). LPs started with a batch of 5 in May 1958; others were ready in 1958 but had to be held for release till 1959; the last few dribbled out, with the final LP probably appearing in 1962. The earliest offerings suggest that Stepheny Records was intended to be a pop label, maybe a pop label dipping a toe or two into rock and roll. In time it branched out into jazz, Country, doowop, Exotica, R&B, and rockabilly, plus some things that are tough to classify.\n\nIt did not have a typical small-label background. Its founder and owner, Norman William Forgue, had been operating printing presses since his mid-teens. Before, during, and after his venture into the music business, he ran Black Cat Press (which specialized in miniature books), Normandie House, and The Norman Press.\n\nHe was also past the age of 50 when he started the label. Norman Forgue was born in Chicago on November 12, 1904. The Forgue family was of French-Canadian origin, via Kankakee, Illinois; his father ran an ice delivery business. The Forgues lived at various addresses on the Near West Side. Norman had to go to work full-time when he was 13, in the composing room of a printing company. He worked as an apprentice in other print shops, worked briefly in the pressroom at Western Electric, then joined the Navy (where he ended up in the print shop). On returning to Chicago he was a compositor, then a foreman and a superintendant, at Book Press. With the experience he had acquired, Forgue started Black Cat Press in 1932, Normandie House in 1937, and (with a partner) a large printing company, The Norman Press, in 1939.\n\nIt looks as though Forgue produced the first Stepheny release as a favor to local performers who were friends of his. Betty Gilbart and Frank Paige were a husband and wife team who had probably been on the scene for some time. They had also written a song, \"Still I Don't Care.\" Stepheny 45-01/45-02 consisted of \"Still I Don't Care\" and \"Melancholy Baby,\" sung by Betty, who was accompanied on the Hammond organ by Frank. Some copies of the 45 were sold in an elegant picture sleeve, using type faces that would have been instantly familiar to buyers of Black Cat and Norman books; the back of the sleeve gave a brief statement about the musicians and the new company. The address was 1800 Asbury Avenue, in Evanston, Illinois; the company would retain this location for the rest of its run. The record labels were generic in appearance, numbered the sides of the 45 consecutively (45-01, 45-02), and gave no publisher information about the songs—all signs that Forgue was new to the business.\n\nNorman Forgue named the company after his daughter, Stepheny Eveline Forgue. When the company opened, Stepheny was in her freshman year at the University of Kentucky, Lexington. According to The Lexington Leader (\"UK Sororities Extend Bids Sunday Afternoon to Coeds,\" October 1, 1956, p. 13), Stepheny E. Forgue of Evanston, Illinois, had pledged Kappa Kappa Gamma.\n\nThe 45s were mastered and pressed by RCA Custom Pressing, in those days the go-to for a lot of small labels. The G prefixes tell us that they were recorded and released in the final quarter of 1956. If any attention was paid to them in a print medium, we haven't seen it.\n\nMs. Gilbart was an alto who sang the material straight, without jazz tendencies and without affectations. Mr. Paige was a pop organist of entirely different tendencies from those exhibited by Ken Griffin, who recorded for Broadcast, Rondo, and Columbia, laying down what would be heard at every roller rink for many years after. Paige preferred the hushed tones and insinuating washes heard on many a radio soap opera (did he get regular work on them?). No one else is on Stepheny 45-01/02. \"Still I Don't\" is a sentimental waltz that could have been written two generations earlier; Stepheny Records wasn't aiming at jukeboxes yet, so it leaves room for instrumental interludes. \"Melancholy Baby,\" a much better song, gets a respectful treatment from Betty Gilbart (verse and chorus). Stepheny Records would never have great distribution, but for this initial effort did Norman Forgue even have distribution in mind?\n\n1956\n\n1957 (45-01 Series)\n\nFor some time after the Gilbart/Paige foray, it looked like one and done. But from the RCA Custom Pressing numbers out of the Indianapolis pressing plant (these run parallel to the numbers used on Salem releases during the same period), we infer that Forgue suddently picked up his activity in July 1957, with a bunch of singers and vocal groups sharing a smaller number of studio bands.\n\nThe company was still putting pairs of numbers on 45s: the 1957 offerings started with 45-03/45-04. It now added BMI or ASCAP designations but still showed no publisher information on the labels. The company had recognized that, in the singles market, money spent on label design and printing would draw more of a return than money spent on sleeve design and printing. Stepheny was named after Norman Forgue's daughter. That in itself wasn't so unusual: Connie Toole named Theron after one of his sons, and the Chess brothers named Marterry after two of their sons. The label's name had to be changed because society bandleader Ralph Marterie didn't like it; eventually Leonard and Phil Chess named their new studio Ter-Mar instead.) But Theron labels didn't have Theron Toole's picture on them; Marterry labels didn't portray Marshall and Terry Chess. The new red labels carried a black and white portrait of Stepheny Eveline Forgue, with the company name in white, in a distinctive script font. The company would keep retain this style of label for 45s through January 1960. An adapted version, with Stepheny's 1958 portrait atop a drawing of a Greek or Roman bust, was applied to LPs until the supply of blank labels ran out in 1961 or 1962.\n\nThe first announcement of renewed and enhanced production appeard in Billboard for September 23, 1957 (p. 20). It declared that Norman Forgue was running Stepheny Records in Evanston and had just put Jerry Allan, formerly a regional publicist for MGM in Kentucky and Indiana, in charge of sales. Jerry Allan was from Indianapolis, where he'd most recently been active in public relations for LaRue's Supper Club and the 16th Street Midget Speedway, among other clients (Indianapolis Star, October 10, 1957, p. 46).\n\nIn fact, Billboard had sort of covered two Stepheny releases the week before (September 16, p. 55). These were Stepheny 45-07 by Sonny Jason and Stepheny 45-11 by Marsha Winters (Billboard identified the Winters 45 by four digits of an RCA Victor matrix number). Billboard also referred to Sonny \"Jackson\" and relegated both singles to the tail end of the review section, where records rated less than 65 out of 100 had to sit.\n\nBillboard's lack of interest was worrisome. Press attention was an urgent need, because Forgue was telling the magazine that he had \"18 disks ready for release\" (Billboard, September 23, p. 20). How do you advertise and sell 18 singles—nearly all by different artists, each of whom has maybe a local reputation—when your company is new, short on promotion, and even shorter on distribution?\n\nTo our present knowledge, the flurry of activity in the summer led to 7 singles being released in September 1957, each with a pair of numbers in the 45-01 series. (There are a couple of gaps between 45-03 and 45-18, for releases we haven't verified. And maybe someone will find something beyond 45-18.) Just these 7 singles were a lot for Jerry Allan to juggle.\n\nStepheny 45-11 did get some positive text out of Phil Sheridan in the Philadelphia Inquirer (October 3, 1957, p. 11). On October 7, Billboard (p. 66) passed on two more of the seven Stephenys, 45-09 (Jodie Randall) and 45-15 (The Discorders). Ms. Randall's name came out as \"Dottie\" and The Discorders became the \"Disorders.\" Billboard would not give a real review to anything on the Stepheny label until April 1958.\n\nStepheny Records was about to pull a trick previously employed by Miracle, Chance, and Herald, among other indies that had started really slowly. If you hadn't caught the attention of the trades before, pretend you hadn't been around before… So Stepheny, whose releases were all too low-rated to earn a review in Billboard, was heralded as a brand new company, in a trade paper that hadn't covered it yet. Cash Box ran a (re)birth story on October 12, 1957 (\"Stepheny Records Formed,\" p. 28). The outfit was really around a year old and had just changed number series. The October 12 \"launch\" article mentioned 18 records already pressed, 4 already being distributed.\n\nA week before, Cash Box had reviewed the Marsha Winters record (identified as 45-12; October 5, 1957, p. 12). No one seemed to find this discrepant. Of the 18 singles, the 4 \"being distributed\" were obviously the 4 that had caught a notice in print. Surely every 45-03 that was ever going to be was already out. The same issue of Cash Box (\"Chez Paree Meeting,\" October 12, p. 42) carried a photo of Sonny Jason (Stepheny 45-07) at Chez Paree in Chicago, being interviewed by the MC. Seated next to him was Jerry Allan.\n\nOn October 12, Allan put on an event for The Discorders, a vocal quartet from Aurora, Illinois. It was held at a record store, where members of the group autographed copies of \"My Hula Hula Lulu.\" The Mayor of Aurora proclaimed it was Discorder Day. Norman Forgue presented the group with a silver record. Naturally a representative of Cash Box was on hand and a brief article with photos followed in due time (\"Discorder Day,\" Cash Box, November 2, 1957, p. 38).\n\nThe first five singles in the 45-03 series carry consecutive matrix numbers, indicating they were mastered and pressed together. They may have originated at one or two sessions over a few days in July 1957.\n\nStepheny 45-03/45-04 was the work of Johnny Dane (lead vocalist; he sounds like a confident teenager) and the Discorders. We don't know whether Johnny was a member of the group, catching separate billing on the record, or a solo vocalist who recorded with them just this once. Both titles are given rock and roll renditions (\"Why Did You Leave Me\" was probably written as a sentimental pop ballad, whereas the composer of \"Shootin' High\" seems to have been aiming for a Country if not a rock and roll interpretation). Accompaniment was by piano, electric guitar, string bass, and drums; \"Why Did You\" incorporates a guitar solo, while \"Shootin'\" was a juke box operator's dream, over and done in 1:51, with no space for such things. Recording quality is excellent: Stepheny was probably using Universal for these sessions.\n\n45-05/45-06 could be the most obscure single from a label that would produce some obscure singles. One John Keston (of whom we know nothing, except he was not an English runner and actor) recorded two songs composed by Earl Roland. If we had the SF1800 counterpart (see below), we'd be sure of Roland's publisher. And, if we could hear the single, we might have some idea of the studio ork. Earl Roland was connected with Sunny, one of at least two music publishing houses owned by Seymour Schwartz. Schwartz, then still the proprietor of Seymour's Record Mart, was on hiatus from two expeditions into the record business, first with Seymour and more recently with the very first incarnation of Heartbeat, which had put out two singles in 1956, then gone inactive. He was also occasionally placing his songs with other companies, such a side by the Gayden Sisters on Bally 1003 (also in 1956).\n\nSonny Jason, who was responsible for 45-07/45-08, we can actually see in a photo, thanks to the publicity in Cash Box. He was a pop vocalist with a pleasant baritone voice. On \"Easy Come Kisses\" Jason was accompanied by piano, vibes, electric guitar, string bass, and drums. The guitarist got a solo, which was tasteful. For \"Warm Red Wine\" a little studio reverb was added to give it all a feel of cloudy reminiscence. A soap opera organ (Frank Paige, surely) was added, the pianist doubled on the celeste, and no drums can be heard. Maybe Sonny Jason and John Keston were on the same session?\n\nJodie Randall was the stage name of Mary Jo Hughes. Mary Jo Hughes was born in Indianapolis, probably in 1928, and was living in the Chicago area when she cut her record. She made a few appearances singing on TV; the Stepheny 45 would be her first and last commercial recording. Again, Paul Foster was credited with one song and Earl Roland with the other. \"Red Shoes\" is a peppy show-band number with accompaniment by a trumpet, two trombones, piano, guitar, bass, and drums. The trombones get into a little call and response with the singer. \"Autumn Breeze\" is a saggy ballad with three trombones, mostly muted, celeste, guitar, and bass.\n\nAnother female vocalist, Marsha Winters, shared a four-tune session with Jodie Randall. Her release on 45-11/45-12 terminated a string of 10 consecutive H7OW numbers that started running on 45-03. Her mildly tearful sound is appropriate for \"Stay\" and \"Last Goodbye.\" Most of the songs the company got from Earl Roland were slow, frequently in waltz time, but \"Stay\" is done in passable Latin rhythm: three trombones, piano, guitar, bass, and Latin percussion. On this single the truly lachrymose number, \"Last Goodbye,\" was written by Eddy Howard, presumably the singer and leader of sweet bands. Here we find three muted trombones, piano alternating with celeste, guitar, and bass.\n\nWe have an intuition that 45-13/45-14 was purposely skipped. The two further 45-03s that we know of are most likely the product of another session in July 1957, a few days after the skein of five singles was ready for mastering and pressing.\n\nThe Discorders got top billing on 45-15/45-16, copies of which they would autograph in Aurora on Discorders Day (October 12). In a now familiar pattern, one song was by Paul Foster and the other was credited to Earl Roland and Beryl Orris. Orris was likely one of Seymour Schwartz's pseudonyms, and on the SF1800 label the publisher is Sunny. Mama didn't allow no rockin' and rollin' in here: \"My Hula Hula Lulu\" is a Swing number with fairly catchy lyrics. Hula hoops weren't going to be a thing for roughly another year; Lulu dwells in Hawaii. The Discorders sound a lot more like the Four Freshmen than any doowop group of the era. Accompaniment is by a saxophone section (alto, tenor, baritone, one of each), piano, electric guitar, bass, and drums. Arranged passages for the section, no solos. \"Nothing Else\" is a drippy ballad; the lineup remains the same for the studio band, saxophones playing sweet-band style, dominated by their alto lead.\n\nMaking a return appearance maybe 9 months after the company opened, Betty Gilbart cut \"You Can't Trust a Wolf\" b/w \"At Last (I Have Found You).\" She shared the session with The Discorders and the same studio band. The group was credited with backup singing on \"Wolf\"; the Discorders had more work to do there, producing the obligatory wolf whistles, but they were on the flip as well. The first batch of labels for 45-17 read \"You Can't Trust a Wool.\" Repairing the, er, howler must have generated a surplus of corrected 45-17 labels, making the 45-03 edition of the single much more common today than the SF1800 that followed. Songwriting chores were again divided between Paul Foster (\"Wolf\") and Roland-Orris, published by Sunny (\"Found\"). \"Wolf\" is an unnecessarily cutesy warning to young women about predatory men, with Swing licks from the three saxes. \"Found,\" in waltz time, has enough schmaltz poured over it to rival anything Lawrence Welk was producing at the time. There is a guest spot for an organist, who again has to be Frank Paige.\n\nWhile Discorders Day awaited a little ink and a photo array, the company's next public move was to buy a full-column ad in Cash Box (October 26, 1957, p. 4). (Norman Forgue had painstakingly designed the script Stepheny Records logo, already visible on the 45-03 series labels. Little could he anticipate that in our time, his choice of font would defeat optical character recognition and keep the ad from turning up in online searches by company name.) Although at least 7 titles had been in front of DJs and distributors, all were assigned new release numbers, in an SF1800 series. 1800 was the company's street address, and SF were Stepheny Forgue's initials. The new series gave a more professional appearance to the 45s, which now also cited the music publishers, and reinforced the impression of a brand new company. The SF1800s will be covered in the next section.\n\nMatrix Artist Title Release Number Recording Date Release Date H80W7106 Johnny Dane and The Discorders Why Did You Leave Me?

It shows 8 titles, four of which had been mentioned in one of the trades. The release numbers spanned from SF1801 to SF1817, making it look as though all but one or two of the 18 ready-to-go 45s were part of one big SF1800 batch in October 1957. (Did Norman Forgue not want an SF1813? We haven't found a 45-13. Down the road there wouldn't be an LP numbered MF 4013, and there would be LPs numbered MF 4014, 4015, and 4016. The other number series after October 1957, for singles on the Spinning subsidiary, yields no evidence, because it ended at HM6012.)\n\nClearly, Jerry Allan did not want to push all 18 (or all 14, or whatever the true number was) at one time. After Allan left, Mort Hillman didn't want to either. Records weren't marketed that way, and neither salesman was feeling suicidal. At chosen intervals, Allan, Hillman, or Forgue would talk up one SF1800 release selectively. The review copies that went to Cash Box (or, hoping against hope, to Billboard) were mailed on widely spaced dates over the next three months. Because the review or mention dates, when we've found them, didn't line up with release dates, we will work up through SF1817 in numerical order. Norman Forgue had heavily front-loaded the company's 45 production; the very last Stepheny single (for Christmas 1960) would be SF1843.\n\nIt's clear from the H series numbers applied by RCA Custom Pressing, and from scattered sub-credits, to The Discorders and others, that SF1801 through SF1817 were the product of a smaller number of recording sessions, not confined to July 1957, but also not spread out beyond the end of September.\n\nStepheny SF1801, by Johnny Dane and The Discorders, coupled a rock and roll ballad with a vaguely Country number. It had previously been 45-03/45-04. SF1801, which shows a credit to Stepheny's house publisher, Asbury Music, didn't get reviewed till January 1958 (Cash Box, January 11, p. 12; Billboard's brush-off misprinted the issue number, January 13, p. 72). This was purely a function of what was plugged when; Norman Forgue had other businesses to run, and Mort Hillman was trying to promote one single in a few different places at roughly one time.\n\nWe think Stepheny SF1802 was by John Keston. We've seen photos of its precursor, 45-05/45-06. We wouldn't mind hearing a copy of either.\n\nStepheny SF1803 should be familiar. It was by Sonny Jason and had gotten a fair amount of marketing as 45-07 (Norm Forgue also mentioned it in a note to Cash Box on the fateful date of October 12, p. 40). Paul Foster had a hand in writing both songs; his name showed up frequently in Stepheny composer credits, but only in 1957. On at least some copies of SF1803, the trail-off vinyl to \"Easy Come Kisses\" has H8OW-7110 stamped in it where the label shows H7OW-7110.\n\nStepheny SF1804 had been out there for a little while too. Jerry Allan told Cash Box (November 2, 1957, p. 15) that it was getting \"a big play\" in Indianapolis. OK, OK, Jerry Allan and Jodie Randall were both from Naptown.\n\nStepheny SF1805 was the Marsha Winters single, again familiar from the 45-03 days. Jerry Allan and Norm Forgue had put in a word for it in Cash Box for October 12, 1957 (p. 14).\n\nStepheny SF1806 was \"My Hula Hula Lulu\" by The Discorders, who had been on more than one session and had seen this particular record duly fêted on October 12 in Aurora.\n\nStepheny SF1807 we are fairly sure was \"You Can't Trust a Wolf\" by Betty Gilbart and the Discorders, b/w \"At Last I Found You\" by Betty Gilbart, Discorders still present but not named on the label. This would complete the string of seven as they'd been released on 45-03 through 45-18. The only review we've found is from Cash Box (February 1, 1958, p. 12). The late date (new Stepheny singles, recorded in January 1958, were on the verge of appearing) we attribute to SF1807 being at the far end of the queue for Hillman's efforts. But the Cash Box review called it Stepheny \"17,\" and 45-17/45-18 is what's usually seen nowadays. We still expect SF1807 to turn up somewhere.\n\nWith Stepheny SF1808, we start encountering sides that were recorded in time to appear in the 45-03s, but may not have seen release in that series. 1808 is by Joe Hayes in front of a band and mixed vocal group (two men, two women) led by Ted Sieber. The accompaniment is just electric guitar, piano, bass, and drums.\n\nSF1808 also wasn't among the 8 singles advertised on October 26, and we haven't found a solitary press mention on it. Both songs are by one Frances Philipps and are best described as Country takes on rhythm and blues. (Formulaically, one could say that rock and roll was a Country take on rhythm and blues, but these sides offer a Country take on R&B and they aren't rock and roll.) \"What'll\" employs the Jimmy Yancey bass line, and \"Please-\" (completion: don't mention her name) is an R&B ballad. Hayes was a baritone with a vocal quality that is just sort of odd. There was probably a market for this material but we doubt Stepheny was able to locate it.\n\nTed Sieber, we can say for sure, was the pianist on this date. Theodore Henry Sieber was born in La Junta, Colorado, around 1926. He moved to Chicago to study at the Chicago College of Music, where Rudolph Ganz was one of his teachers. In 1947, Sieber was the pianist for the Ambassadors of Song, a male vocal octet that included Howard Berhalter, later of Debbie and the Diplomats (see below). From the early 1950s through the mid-1970s, Sieber led a combo that played for dancers. He also wrote jingles and appeared in advertisements. When Ted Sieber died, in September 2015, his obituary mentioned that he had recorded for Stepheny. Can this be said of any other former Stepheny artist?\n\nWe have yet to turn up a copy of Stepheny SF1809.\n\nStepheny SF1810 was by a piano bar artist named Jack Ring, who receives credit for piano and vocal in front of \"rhythm accompaniment.\" His sides were done early enough to catch a release in the 45-03s; again, we haven't seen them in that form. We'd figured out Ring's line of work before we did the newspaper search on him. When it came time to celebrate the New Year, Ring was working the piano bar at Mangam's Chateau (Chicago Tribune, December 29, 1957, pt. 7 p. 10). Ring was competing with, we'll just pick a few, Buddy Charles (at the Black Orchid), Dorothy Donegan (at the London House), Chet Roble (at the College Inn lounge), Ramsey Lewis (at the Cloister Inn), and the Duke Ellington Orchestra (at the Blue Note). He probably did all right; a whole year later (Chicago Tribune, December 28, 1958, pt. 7 p. 10) he was still holding down the piano bar at Mangam's.\n\nFor two of his own songs, Ring chose a banjo (switching to electric guitar on \"Deetie\") and a busy drummer. Not the usual rhythm accompaniment. It seems his heart was in the 1920s. Ring was an OK singer, a little shouty; his attack on the piano was reminiscent of some Chicago musicians long departed from the scene, such as Frank Melrose. If there'd still been a market for what one of the trade papers called \"cornfed razzmatazz,\" the kind of market that Jack Teter was able to satisfy in 1949 and 1950, Ring could have made some interesting records.\n\nStepheny SF1811 is another mystery, to us at least. Anybody seen it?\n\nStepheny SF1812 featured a singer named Jack Nelson. One of the numbers, \"Return My Heart,\" was cowritten with Warren Knoble, a leader of pop studio bands. Although the Discorders were on two sessions, in the runup to SF1817 Nelson was the only artist besides Betty Gilbart to get two releases under his own name.\n\nWe'd thought Nelson was a pop singer, but what we get on Stepheny SF1812 is two credible Country performances. Nelson had a good tenor instrument that suited the material. \"Return My Heart\" is a fair song in the Hank Williams vein; \"Playboy\" just needed better lyrics. The accompaniment was by steel guitar (soloing on both sides), rhythm guitar, string bass, and drums, sounding as though they'd been working together for years, plus a special added attraction: a soprano saxophone. A what? Soprano saxes were rarely heard on any kind of recording in 1957; whoever played the session was used to employing the straight horn in Country music (there's a little solo on \"Playboy\"). Mort Hillman was from Cincinnati, the home of King Records; one would think he might have known something about the Country market. Apparently Stepheny didn't have (and wouldn't acquire) the right distribution for this kind of record.\n\nStepheny SF1815 included a number by Warren Knoble and a different collaborator (\"Pretty Girl\"). Effectively it was Nelson's theme song. His only other commercial recording that we know of had been for Chance and it, too, included \"Pretty Girl.\" The SF1815 \"Pretty Girl\" comes from the same session as the two sides of 1812, but the accompaniment is pared down to electric guitar, bass, and drums. Nelson sings it as a waltz-time pop ballad, no intimations of Country. \"Stingy Kisses\" probably was done at a session a little while later. It uses the exact same lineup from SF1812 (steel guitar solo included, no soprano sax solo) and returns to the Country presentation. Like \"Playboy,\" the song could have used better lyrics.\n\nStepheny Records did little to promote Nelson's sides; neither SF1812 nor SF1815 is known to have been reviewed anywhere. Mort Hillman did have a working relationship with the MC at an upcoming charity event, a DJ known as \"Coffeehead\" Larsen. So he arranged for Stepheny performers to appear at a muscular dystrophy benefit in Milwaukee. On December 14 (\"Disc Stars to Perform at M. D. Christmas Party,\" Cash Box, p. 40), an announcement put Jack Nelson among those scheduled (along with the Ebon-Knights). But when the event took place (December 17), there'd been a lot of slippage (Cash Box, January 18, 1958, p. 55). Stepheny's sole representative ended up being Del Clarke (who is not known to have released anything on the label; previously Nelson was to have been accompanied by Judy Valentine, who isn't known to have released anything either).\n\nStepheny SF1814 was advertised in October 1957. It brought King Kolax and his band to the label, at a time when the veteran trumpet player was having some trouble getting club gigs. The rationale for the record was to showcase the work of a songwriter named Allen Hall, Sr. The same tune appeared on both sides, one vocal and one instrumental, like a reggae number with a \"version\" (sometimes done with demos, but not a very common practice for a commercial release in 1957). The vocal side featured Clyde Williams, a baritone who had been a member of a couple of vocal groups in Chicago. When this session was made, Williams was singing regularly with Sun Ra's Arkestra. For the vocal side, strings were added to the Kolax combo (it would be interesting to know who wrote the charts for them). On the instrumental side, sans strings, the quintet that King Kolax had assembled got to stretch out a little. Clyde Williams didn't get invited back, but Norman Forgue included King Kolax in his plans for a Stepheny LP later on. Songs by Prentice McCarey, who played the piano in Kolax's quintet for several years, were also used.\n\nOne of McCarey's songs was taken up by Mark Mitchell, a singer about whom we currently know nothing. Mitchell's single was Stepheny SF1816. This, too, was advertised in October 1957. McCarey composed \"You Make Time Stand Still.\" The flip, \"Love's a Fire,\" was credited to Goldsmith, Kime, and Severson. Warren Kime was a jazz trumpet player in Chicago, and Paul Severson played trombone and piano and did a lot of arranging, sometimes for groups that included Warren Kime. In 1954 and 1955 Severson (usually in collaboration with Kime and others) copyrighted 40 songs. Out of this entire portfolio, \"Love's a Fire\" looks to have been the only one that got recorded. In the opinion of Gary Heller, who researched Severson's song copyrights, Severson and Kime must have written a tune and Goldsmith attached the \"Fire\" lyrics to it later, without excessive regard to fit. The Prentice McCarey song (McCarey took credit for music and lyrics) was, in his opinion, better crafted.\n\nMitchell had a decent tenor voice, but the production on these two romantic ballads was strictly pop. Now, however, Stepheny wanted strings. Heretofore, they'd been used only on the vocal side to SF1814. Strings would not appear on another Stepheny single till SF1830, and never again after that.\n\nHeller thinks the arrangements on SF1816 (strings, solo flute, piano, bass, drums) could have been Severson's. He also suspects the instrumental backgrounds were recorded first and the vocals dubbed over them (as was becoming a regular practice, though as far as we can tell it was not typical at this company). Paul Severson handled some pop arrangements for the Academy label (a Chicago indie that functioned from 1954 through 1958, managing to remain more obscure than Stepheny). Severson enjoyed more success recording his own jazz combos, with one LP for Academy and a second for Replica, which was run by an audio enthusiast in Des Plaines. Four Severson LP tracks (plus a fifth track not commercially released, if, as seems likely, the film's Dixieland number was one of his) also appeared in Ed Bland's eccentric film short, The Cry of Jazz, which got a few showings in 1959. Severson was mentioned in the film and some of his recordings were credited; in later years he screened it to students in his jazz history classes. But the manner in which it was assembled did little to promote his music. Severson's band was never on screen and members of Sun Ra's Arkestra appeared to be playing two or three of his pieces.\n\nStepheny SF1817, last in the October batch, was by a vocal quartet from Saint Louis, The Ebon-Knights. The quartet (to our despair, we don't know any of the singers' names) had been brought in for a four-tune session. Two were chosen for SF1817 and the other two were likely meant for a subsequent single. Instead, they were held for the group's LP. On this session, two trombones and an alto and a baritone sax supplemented the basic rhythm section. The alto saxophonist gets a couple of solo statements on \"The Way the Ball Bounces,\" an effective jump. For the ballad side, the company bypassed the Chicagoland songwriters it had been relying on and got the group to sing a standard, \"Poor Butterfly.\" Until 1959, when the company started shopping for the cheapest recording rate, Stepheny singles were nearly all well-recorded and the sonics on SF1817, we're obliged to report, are unusually good.\n\nFrom the H series matrix numbers, we see that SF1814, SF1816, and SF1817 were recorded, mastered, and pressed a little later the sides by the The Discorders and Betty Gilbart. All three were nonetheless advertised in Cash Box on October 26. A real live display ad (the second and last for Stepheny in Cash Box; a year and a half later there would be a single display ad for Spinning) ran on November 9 (p. 18), pairing a photo of four Ebon-Knights with a photo of four Discorders. Again, we attribute the later dates for other promotional activity to calendar management. The gap between HO7W numbers we ascribe to the four-tune session that was, for a time, going to lead to another single, instead of the Ebon-Knights' LP, which was released in May 1958 (see below). Clearly the group was doing something right, because only one other artist who recorded for Stepheny in 1957 ended up on an LP. (That was King Kolax: he'd been on SF1814 with one quintet; he would reappear nearly a year later accompanying Harvey Ellington, with a different quintet).\n\nAfter 6 or 7 weeks with Jerry Allan, Norman Forgue replaced him with Mort Hillman. A couple of months later, Jerry Allan would join Seymour Schwartz at the second edition of Heartbeat. There Allen must have recommended a ploy by then familiar (Heartbeat 1.0 had opened and closed in 1956). Hillman, meanwhile, was available because his record company, Salem, had just closed its doors. Hillman's hiring was announced in Cash Box on November 23, 1957 (\"Mort Hillman National Sales Mgr. of Stephany [sic],\" p. 36). Guess who wrote it? The article happened to mention that Hillman was going right out on the road to recruit distributors—and to promote SF1817. It also mentioned that in due time Stepheny would be getting into LPs; Salem had released three.\n\nNot so coincidentally, the same issue of Cash Box related a discovery story: Forgue, while returning to his parked car in a lot in the Loop at night, had heard the Ebon-Knights performing for passers-by at the entrance to an alley. (The liner notes to the Ebon-Knights' LP, by a DJ of Hillman's acquaintance named Jerry Leighton, would thicken the dramatic detail and alter the circumstances of the meeting. Per Leighton, the four Ebon-Knights, who had driven in from Saint Louis hunting for gigs, were so broke after a week in Chicago that they were down to their last bologna sandwich, which they were eating while sitting in their broken-down car.) This was utter BS, presumably the creative writing of Mort Hillman.\n\nThe Ebon-Knights then learned four tunes and cut their first sides in four days; this might conceivably be true. The article credits one Jerry Stadin with serving as arranger and musical director. We have found no newspaper references to him, but there are composer credits to Stadin on the Ebon-Knights' LP, one of which is to a number from their first session. How about a more plausible telling: Stadin pitched the group to Stepheny, bringing them to 1800 Asbury, Evanston, Illinois to make a demo, on which basis Norman Forgue decided to record them and told Leighton (or got Hillman to tell Leighton) he had to listen to them. The BS detector needle waves back into the red zone as we run past a 10-year (!!!) personal management contract with Norman Forgue, plus a 6-month (!!!!) gig he had booked for the group in Las Vegas (\"Stephany [sic] Signs New Group Discovery,\" November 23, 1957, p. 47). And do permit us the observation that if Norman Forgue had had anything to do with the article, he would have made sure Cash Box spelled his daughter's name correctly.\n\nWhat did materialize is that Stepheny SF1817 got a positive review in Cash Box on December 7, 1957 (p. 14). And Phil Sheridan gave it another in the Philadelphia Inquirer (December 11, p. 34). Billboard? Neah, couldn't be bothered.\n\nForgue and Hillman were able to land the Ebon-Knights a gig at Club Laurel, 5426 North Broadway, on a bill with the Don Thompson Quintet and Ann Marie Moss (Chicago Sunday Tribune, December 22, 1957, pt. 7, p. 9). Most importantly, the Ebon-Knights were factored into Stepheny Records' album plans.\n\nMatrix Artist Title Release Number Recording Date Release Date H8OW7106 Johnny Dane and The Discorders Why Did You Leave Me (Knoble-Nelson) Stepheny SF1801 July 1957 October 1957 H8OW7107 Johnny Dane and The Discorders Shootin' High (De Lucia) Stepheny SF1801 July 1957 October 1957 Stepheny SF1802 Stepheny SF1802 H7OW-7110 Sonny Jason Easy Come Kisses (Easy Go Love) (Foster-Burrichter) Stepheny SF 1803 July 1957 October 1957 H7OW-7111 Sonny Jason Warm Red Wine (Foster) Stepheny SF 1803 July 1957 October 1957 H7OW7112 Jodie Randall Little Red Shoes (Foster) Stepheny SF1804 July 1957 October 1957 H7OW7113 Jodie Randall Lonesome Autumn Breeze (Roland) Stepheny SF1804 July 1957 October 1957 H7OW-7114 Marsha Winters Stay (Roland) Stepheny SF 1805 July 1957 October 1957 H7OW-7115 Marsha Winters My Last Goodbye (Howard) Stepheny SF 1805 July 1957 October 1957 H7OW-7235 The Discorders My Hula Hula Lulu (Foster) Stepheny SF1806 July 1957 October 1957 H7OW-7236 The Discorders Nothing Else Matters (Roland-Orris) Stepheny SF1806 July 1957 October 1957 H70W-7237 Betty Gilbart You Can't Trust a Wolf (Foster) Stepheny SF1807 July 1957 October 1957 H70W-7238 Betty Gilbart At Last (I Have Found You) (Roland-Orris) Stepheny SF1807 July 1957 October 1957 H8OW-7288 Joe Hayes with Ted Sieber's Band and Vocal Group What Good'll It Do (Frances Philipps) Stepheny SF1808 July 1957 October 1957 H8OW-7289 Joe Hayes with Ted Sieber's Band and Vocal Group Please (Frances Philipps) Stepheny SF1808 July 1957 October 1957 Stepheny SF1809 Stepheny SF1809 H7OW-8350 Jack Ring with Rhythm Accompaniment Who's Blue (Ring) Stepheny SF1810 August 1957 October 1957 H7OW-8351 Jack Ring with Rhythm Accompaniment Deetie (Ring) Stepheny SF1810 August 1957 October 1957 Stepheny SF1811 Stepheny SF1811 H8OW-8322 Jack Nelson Return My Heart (Knoble-Nelson) Stepheny SF1812 August 1957 October 1957 H8OW-8323 Jack Nelson Playboy (LaVere-Bancino) Stepheny SF1812 August 1957 October 1957 Stepheny SF1813 Stepheny SF1813 HO8W-0114 Clyde Williams with King Kolax Band Baby You're a Little Bit Forgetful (Hall) Stepheny SF1814 September 1957 October 1957 HO8W-0115 King Kolax Band Baby You're a Little Bit Forgetful (Hall) Stepheny SF1814 September 1957 October 1957 H8OW-7293 Jack Nelson Pretty Girl (Knoble-Earnhart) Stepheny SF1815 July 1957 October 1957 H8OW-8324 Jack Nelson Stingy Kisses (LaVere-Marchfield-Raymond) Stepheny SF1815 August 1957 October 1957 HO8W-0219 Mark Mitchell You Make Time Stand Still (McCarey) Stepheny SF1816 September 1957 October 1957 HO8W-0220 Mark Mitchell Love's a Fire (Goldsmith-Kime-Severson) Stepheny SF1816 September 1957 October 1957 HO7W-0223 The Ebon-Knights The Way the Ball Bounces (Irwin) Stepheny SF1817 late September 1957 October 1957 HO7W-0225 The Ebon-Knights Poor Butterfly (Hubbell-Golden) Stepheny SF1817 late September 1957 October 1957\n\n1958 (Stepheny 45s)\n\nAs Mort Hillman tried to bring order to the company's promotional efforts, Stepheny Records had put in for a moratorium on studio visits. Sessions resumed after the first of the year. Subsequent releases on the SF1800 series would thus carry the J prefix from RCA Victor Custom Pressings.\n\nAnother vocal group, the Mar-Vellos, was probably recorded right after New Year's 1958. Stepheny SF1818, \"Boyee Yoing\" b/w \"Come Back My Love,\" was released by the end of the month. It was the first Stepheny 45 to carry a new portrait at the top of the label (the new portrait would remain in use through the first release of 1960). The Mar-Vellos had been around a while; their first recording was for the Theron label late in 1955. Unfortunately, we don't know the names of anyone in the group, though it apparently included two brothers. We do know that they were managed by James P. Johnson (he may have played the piano, but was obviously not James P. Johnson the master of Harlem stride), who led the studio band on their Theron single and cowrote some of their songs. H. P. Duncan also received a songwriting credit to one of their sides for Theron. Connie Toole, who operated Theron, sent the group on a tour in January and February 1956 but the money he invested was largely for nought; the Mar-Vellos' single would be the last on his label.\n\nStepheny SF1818 would be the most commercially successful record the Mar-Vellos put out. Keep in mind, we're speaking in relative terms. Billboard (February 10, 1958, p. 44) dumped the Mar-Vellos onto its less-than-70 list. The group didn't deserve this: \"Boyee Yoing\" is an exuberant jump, and \"Come Back My Love\" a solid ballad. Accompaniment, presumably directed by James P. Johnson, consisted of piano, electric guitar, string bass, and drums. A tenor saxophonist pops up with a listenable solo on \"Boyee Yoing.\"\n\nPeriod notices on the Mar-Vellos are hard to find. We have learned they were the featured attraction at the Teen Age Easter Hop in the Armory in South Bend, Indiana. Accompaniment was by local musicians (\"Rock 'n' Roll Four to Sing at Teen Hop,\" South Bend Tribune, April 5, 1958, p. 6). Why Stepheny didn't keep the group around a little longer is unclear.\n\nIn 1961, James P. Johnson opened his own label, which was called Marvello; King Kolax was his director of A&R. The Marvellos, as their name was then spelled, recorded two tracks in 1961, which ended up oddly split between two 45s. Most likely the group broke up not long after these last two singles were released. Yet of all the 45s on Stepheny and Spinning, the Mar-Vellos' would be the only one to get a reissue on a 45 in the United States. It came on the Cha Cha label, which opened in March 1960 and in its earliest days was distributed by Stepheny. But the Marvellos single, whatever the year, was reissued on Cha Cha well after Stepheny had closed down. Incidentally, Cha Cha C756 designated \"Come Back My Love\" as the A side. Stepheny singles after 45-01 never had A and B sides.\n\nNext came a group called the Cheerful Earfuls. The Earfuls were a quintet that can be seen in a photo with trumpet, tenor sax, piano, electric guitar, and drums. They boasted they could play nearly anything, and from the limited evidence of their recordings we know that one of them (we think it was the trumpeter) frequently switched to electric guitar. It wasn't your usual combo that got promoted for \"Dixieland jazz and singing\" and for leading a \"Rock & Roll jam session\"—during the same Tuesday through Sunday engagement (Decatur Sunday Times Herald, July 22, 1956, p. 42; July 29, 1956, p. 42).\n\nThe Earfuls, as their 1956 gig in Decatur, Illinois, might signify, had been on the circuit for a while. The core of the quintet consisted of the two Sotos brothers, who had left New York City for the Midwest and for a while ended up running a club in Moline, Illinois. The Earfuls already had two singles out when Stepheny Records signed them. Both were on a very small label called Zale, whose frontman was a retired boxer. The most interesting thing about Zale was not the records. It was that the guy whose money backed the label ended up getting whacked in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on orders from the Mob. The Zales appear to be from 1956. Whoever produced them apparently didn't want to rely on the Earfuls' instrumental contributions; the Earfuls sang and a studio band directed by Mike Simpson (who would also direct studio bands for Stepheny; see below) took care of the rest.\n\nThe Earfuls had landed gigs in Chicagoland before they came to Forgue and Hillman's attention. On December 7, 1956, they were at a Christmas Seal show at Morton High School; the announcement referred to them as \"rock-'n'-roll recording artists\" (Berwyn Life-Beacon, December 2, 1956, p. 7). In May 1957, they were playing the revived Brass Rail in the Loop (Chicago Tribune, May 19, 1957, pt. 7 p. 12).\n\nThe Earfuls' release on Stepheny SF1819 consisted of a two-sided rock and roll instrumental called \"The Drag.\" One edition of the labels attributes \"The Drag\" to \"Frye\"; the other to \"C. Earfuls.\" Either way the publisher was the same. A rock and roll instrumental most often called for two electric guitars; there were two, and, as far as we can tell, both of them soloed. Otherwise, there are contributions from the tenor sax, the piano, and the drums. \"Number One\" also layers on what sounds like an electronically processed vocalise; both numbers include hand claps that appear to have been overdubbed.\n\nThe company sent the Earfuls out to a couple of events. Don Bell, a DJ in Des Moines, Iowa, was running \"Bell Hops\" at the Val Air Ballroom. This was one of the few venues for a band like the Earfuls in Des Moines—Iowa had a law against serving liquor by the drink until 1963, so anybody who tried to operate a real nightclub got raided and shut down. At Bell's second anniversary event on February 27, the Earfuls were scheduled to be on hand along with Ronnie Self (\"'Miss Livin' Doll',\" Cash Box, March 8, 1958, p. 41). On March 8, the Earfuls participated in an hours-long show put on by the record companies at the First Annual Industry-Wide Disk Jockey Convention, in Kansas City (\"Huge Turnout at Deejay Convention,\" Cash Box, March 22, 1958, p. 23). The major labels all had acts in the show, along with smaller Midwestern operations such as Fraternity and Argo.\n\nThe Earfuls were back at Decatur Cocktail lounge on April 18, 1958, for a 10-day engagement (Decatur Daily Tribune, p. 18). They were not typed by genre this time. The next month they were in a \"Rock and Roll Revue\" which, with the ambivalence still evident at the time, featured \"Favorite Chicago Jazz Units.\" It took place at the Belmont Theater, Ashland and Lincoln. The Earfuls were billed second, after Tony Smith's Band (Chicago Daily Tribune, May 17, 1958, pt. 1 p. 15).\n\nThe Earfuls broke up a year or two later. A successor entity, just going as The Sotos Brothers, made a single for a company called Fredlo in 1961. Fredlo was based in Davenport, Iowa, where it operated at a sedate pace from 1956 through 1973; after Fredlo 6106, we are not sure what the Sotos brothers did, though there are reports of them appearing on a jazz record or two.\n\nStepheny SF1820 was the work of one Jerry Jaye, who wrote his own songs. Consecutive matrix numbers led us to suspect that Jaye performed on the same session as the Cheerful Earfuls. He did. The accompaniment by two guitars, piano, and drums is the work of you know who. oth sides are credible rock and roll, though Jaye doesn't seem to have been the strongest of vocalists: his singing is mildly enhanced with reverb, and on a certain phrase (\"Sugar dumplin'\") he is double tracked. So was Jaye a guest vocalist or was he one of the Earfuls? We have no idea. We may be allowed to report that we don't hear any tenor sax on his two sides. Jaye seemed to be modeling his songs after the work of Dale Hawkins and Bobby Charles, who were under contract to Checker and Chess, respectively. And the lead guitarist on his record was familiar with the work of Chuck Berry, also under contract to Chess. SF1820 was up against formidable competition from a well-established Chicago-based label.\n\nStepheny SF1821 marked the last appearance on a record by Grant Jones, who for a decade had been active as a standup blues singer. Jones had recorded for Mayo Williams' companies, Coral, and United/States. The idea in January 1958 was to make him over as a rock and roller. Mike Simpson, a Swing-based jazz musician whose axes were tenor sax, clarinet, and flute, was going to lead a rock and roll band. Somebody might have gotten a decent rock and roll record out of Grant Jones. Just not with these songs: the pursuit of teen appeal was sickly obvious. And the writers had no idea what rock and roll records teenagers (or anyone else) actually liked. Not with this band, either, despite the foreground accorded to the jangly guitar; why didn't Stepheny put Jones in front of the Earfuls?\n\n\"Soda Pop Rock\" has deliberately inane lyrics. As Jones fights his way through them, band members keep chanting \"A-pop-a-zooey!\" It doesn't help him. There is an OK tenor sax solo by Mike Simpson; other band members play trumpet, electric guitar, piano, bass, and drums. \"Pinball Machine\" has a theme marginally better suited to Grant Jones, maybe because he helped to write it. Somebody in the band (the drummer?) occasionally plinks a xylophone. But who in rock and roll compared a pinball machine to a \"dame\"? Who compared anything to a dame? Grant Jones was in good voice for the session; the material sank him.\n\nAs sporadically happens with Stepheny singles, SF1821 carries a second set of matrix numbers (incised in the vinyl only). U-4439 and U-4441 point to Universal Recording. As we are about to see, the company recorded several LPs at Universal.\n\nThe Ebon-Knights were back in the studio early in the year; from the spread between the RCA Victor numbers, we infer two sessions a few days apart. (Few Stepheny artists landed a second session, let alone a third.) Both sessions employed piano-guitar-bass-drums, with a guest appearance by a tenor saxophonist on two tracks. Stepheny SF1822, \"First Date\" b/w \"Only, Only You,\" was out in February and was reviewed in Cash Box (March 15, 1958, p. 12). \"First Date,\" the ballad, and \"Only, Only,\" the jump, were well sung and well played. How these qualities translated into sales we don't know.\n\n\"First Date\" would soon be the title cut of the Ebon-Knights' LP on Stepheny (see below), made up of tracks from their first session in September 1957 and from these two in January 1958.\n\nMort Hillman was able to book the Ebon-Knights into the Apollo Theater in Harlem, in a show that opened Friday February 28th. They were a good distance down the list; top billing went to Mickey and Sylvia and Billie and Lillie (New York Age, March 1, 1958, p. 17). The whole thing probably lasted one week, and it was the biggest publicity the group ever got. The final newspaper mention we've found on the Knights was from a gig at the Chaudiere Rose Room, in Ottawa, Canada. Well, Ottawa was probably warm while they were there. The Ebon-Knights opened on May 26, 1958 (Ottawa Journal, p. 11) and the club ran ads daily during the one-week stand. Though they now had an LP out, we can't see how the group could have stayed together much longer.\n\nStepheny SF1823 has apparently gone missing. Has anyone seen a copy?\n\nA singer named Bob Laurie made his first appearance on Stepheny SF1824. Lew Douglas, who led one studio ork after another on Chicago pop sessions during the 1950s, apparently had a hand in both of the songs, which were published by Vincent \"Bud\" Brandom's company. Allan Webster led the studio band for Stepheny. Laurie was better at portraying dejection (\"Young Heart\") than resolution (\"Ching\"). The songs were on the dull side. Still, the right band might have made them into rock and roll, whereas Webster and crew (three backing vocalists, piano, banjo, bass, drums) merely made them corny. Why a banjo? Why a ricky-tick piano? We'll never know.\n\nThe first Stepheny release aimed at a niche market was The Bush Leaguers' single, commemorating the Milwaukee Braves' World Series win the previous fall. Fulton and Steele had previously written \"Only, Only You\" for the Ebon-Knights. Here the writers figured Milwaukee was polka city, so \"Home of the Braves\" got three male vocalists, an accordion, a clarinet, piano, tuba, and drums. The group name arose because one of the New York Yankees had disparaged Milwaukee as a \"bush league town.\" Sure, the rhythm was right for exalting the local beer, but how were Braves fans going to do the tomahawk chop to a polka? \"Vacation Time\" generalizes to Wisconsin as polkaland. A female vocalist is added and the accordion is exchanged for a trumpet. Emerging from a company that had shown zero previous interest in polka, what could Stepheny SF1825 have pulled in?\n\nStepheny SF1826, recorded in March 1958, featured vocal group performances by Debbie and the Diplomats, who were from Chicago. Courtesy of the White Doo Wop Collector site (https://whitedoowopcollector.blogspot.com/2017/01/debbie-diplomatsstepheny-records.html), we don't have to relegate the singers to anonymity, the way we still have to do with the Ebon-Knights and the Mar-Vellos. When they recorded for Stepheny, the group, to the best of our knowledge, consisted of Debbie Kelley (soprano), Bert Sterling (tenor), Mel Johnson (baritone), and Howard Berhalter (baritone), who had started working together in 1955. Apparently their strongest following was in the Indianapolis area. Some of their gigs were as backing vocalists.\n\nThe group had been on the scene before 1955, with a lot more to its back story than older bios have indicated. A reference (Bill Myrick, \"Lone Gal Adds Zip to Quartet,\" Atlanta Constitution, June 6, 1960, p. 22-A) to Howard Berhalter as the \"leader\" suggests that he had organized the group, which, in 1953 and 1954, was merely the Diplomats. The billing as \"Envoys of Song\" seems to go back to the beginning. But, as it turns out, the group's name and billing were borrowed.\n\nHoward R. Berhalter was born in Chicago on February 4, 1913. He was surely working as a vocalist in the 1930s. Berhalter served in the US Army in World War II, rising to the rank of sergeant. In 1946, Howard Berhalter was a member of an ensemble, the Harmony Masters, which consisted of a male vocal quartet plus a pianist; Ray Steinler, bass, was the director. In 1947 and 1948, Berhalter was a member of a male vocal octet, the Ambassadors of Song, which had been established by Ray Steinler in 1937 (Steinler directed vocal ensembles of different sizes). On the occasion of a concert given in the Upper Iowa University gymnasium, in Fayette, Iowa, Berhalter was said to be currently affiliated with the Chicago Opera Company and to be serving as a vocal soloist with the Chicago Symphony. The octet's pianist was a 21-year-old named Ted Sieber. The program was eclectic, including classics, spirituals, some older show tunes, and Western songs (these last called for a costume change: into white cowboy hats and cowboy boots; \"Crowd Greets First UIU Concert,\" The Oelwein Daily Register, October 9, 1947, p. 1). Six months later, the Ambassadors performed for the Early Birds Breakfast Club in Spokane, Washington; one of the singers was temporarily out because of an illness in his family. Grace Prince was now playing the piano. The program was similar to what they had performed in Iowa; the audience especially liked the duet on Verdi's \"Solenne in Quest'ora\" by Howard Berhalter and tenor Leonard Balsamo (\"Singers Please Club Audience,\" Spokesman-Review, Spokane, Washington, April 27, 1948, p. 6).\n\nThe Diplomats were initially on the Harmony Masters pattern: four male vocalists and a pianist. No female singer would join the group until the second half of 1954. For a performance on the Purdue University campus on June 26, 1953, not only were the Diplomats identified by name but nearly their entire program was laid out (\"Musical Program for Convo Friday,\" The Journal and Courier, Lafayette, Indiana, June 25, 1953, p. 3). We're pretty sure a set list for Debbie and the Diplomats would look different. Diplomats 1.0 were: Howard Berhalter (baritone); Lawrence Gray (bass); Clifford Donnally (top tenor); Bert Sterling (second tenor); Richard Phillips (piano). Three of the four had been in opera companies. Phillips would play pieces by Chopin, among other composers, during their concerts.\n\nWhen the Diplomats performed at the Florentine Club in Shreveport, Louisiana, in October 1954, the writer for the local Times noted that they had performed there \"two seasons ago\". We're not clear when that was, but it couldn't have been prior to 1953; during 1952, Howard Berhalter was performing solo or with a female vocal trio. Often talked about by the group's publicist was a command performance at the White House for President Eisenhower. This apparently took place on June 11, 1953 (see a blurb in The Leader-Telegram, Eau Claire, Wisconsin, October 11, 1955, p. 3-A). The command performance is properly credited to five Diplomats sans Debbie. The early Diplomats did a fair amount of touring and reportedly made some guest appearances with dance bands (of the sweet and not the hot variety; for instance, they worked with Fred Waring). In July 1954, there were still five Diplomats. An item on a forthcoming appearance at Ball State University (\"'Diplomats' Sing at College Convo,\"\" Muncie Star, July 4, 1954, p. A-7) mentioned the same four singers but was didn't know what to do with the pianist, as though Richard Phillips was supposed to sing too. For an appearance at Central State College in Stevens Point, Wisconin on July 7, the Diplomats were billed as a male vocal quartet (\"Dramatization Opens College Assembly Series,\" Stevens Point [Wisconsin] Daily Journal, June 25, 1954, p. 7). An October 16 appearance for the Woman's Club of Rock Island, Illinois could have used a different lineup, but we lack information about the personnel (The Rock Island Argus, September 1, 1954, p. 14).\n\nA photo first used in an ad for possibly the group's next few performances in October 1954, shows a quartet with a female singer, whose name we don't know (The Times [Shreveport, Louisiana], October 19, 1954, p. 13-A). The Diplomats were also no longer carrying their own pianist. The same photo was used for an appearance in Minneapolis, extending from just before New Year's 1955 through the week after (Minneapolis Morning Tribune, December 29, 1954, p. 7); the group was at the Flame Room in the Radisson Hotel, with Don McGrane and the house band accompanying.\n\nWithin a few weeks the first female vocalist was out of the group. A singer and dancer who went as Miss Debbie or as Debbie Kelley had moved in, negotiating her own billing. An announcement for the new group's appearance at an auto show in Sioux City, Iowa, was accompanied by a photo of... Debbie (The Independent, Hawarden, Iowa, February 17, 1955, p. 10). This signalled that she brought some sizzle to the group's performances. Her mother and father, so we are told in a blurb from June 1955, had once been teamed as The Dancing Waltons. (If this is true, we don't know whether it means that Jules and Joanne Walton, who were teamed from 1940 onward, were her parents. Or, stretching a wee bit, Josie, Jules' sister and his dance partner from 1916 to 1935, and Josie's husband were her parents.) As of June 1955, the quartet's personnel had stabilized as Debbie Kelley, Howard Berhalter, Bert Sterling, and Mel Johnson.\n\nA photo of the same group ran a year later, when Debbie and the Diplomats were slated for the first show in a summer series at Mesker Amphiteatre in Evansville, Indiana (Evansville Press, June 22, 1956, p. 27). Cathy Carr, who had recently had a hit, and Tony Bennett, who would keep having hits, were at the top of the bill.\n\nAlso in 1956, Debbie and the Diplomats (just two male singers on this occasion; they were identified as a trio on the label) cut a 78 rpm lacquer with two sides at Modern Recording Studio, 55 Wacker Drive, apparently hoping the songs would be used in President Eisenhower's reelection campaign. No other year could fit for the Diplomats, who were not yet organized in the summer or fall of 1952; Debbie is credited on the label and audible on the acetate. They were accompanied by Priscilla Holbrook at the organ. It's unlikely that such material was meant for commercial release; the acetate looks like a demo for a political campaign, not for a record company. The title now available at archive.org is \"Ike's Our Guy\" (running time 1:49), words and music credited to Marion P. Winkelmann. The title on the other side (in poor condition on the copy of the acetate that was submitted, so not dubbed) was probably \"Eisenhower March.\" The reporter who interviewed Howard Berhalter during the group's 1960 run in Atlanta referred to it as another item the group had recorded without commercial success.\n\nA report of a performance in May 1957, at a show for Masons in Freeport, Illinois, describes the group's portion of the program as \"ensemble and solo singing, including light opera.\" The lineup on his ocassion was Miss Debbie Kelley, soprano; Bert Sterling, tenor; Howard Berhalter, baritone; and John Kenny, bass (\"800 Attend Masonic Program,\" Freeport Journal-Standard, May 4, 1957, p. 4). It seems that Mel Johnson's place had been taken by a bass singer. Whether Johnson subsequently returned, we are not entirely sure.\n\nDebbie and the Diplomats had a gig, maybe right before their session, at Yeamans Supper Club in Detroit (Detroit Free Press, March 7, 1958, p. 39). When it recorded for Stepheny, the group was making the second trip to the studio under its own name.\n\nComposer credits on both sides of Stepheny SF1826 went to Mascari and Wenzlaff, whose publisher was Bob-Cor. Mort Hillman knew these guys. The same writers and publisher had shown up around a year earlier on Salem S- 1002, by the Off-Beats. Here the songs sit uneasily between big band and rock and roll. \"Burnin' the Torch\" is a little more believable as rock and roll. Debbie, who takes an occasional solo line, and the three Diplomats (Bert Sterling, Howard Berhalter, and either Mel Johnson or someone like John Kenny) get some nice ensemble passages; otherwise, the vocal sound can get turbid. Accompaniment is by those two trombones (crossed slides could have been a company trademark), piano, electric guitar (with a brief solo on \"Burnin'\"), string bass, and drums. \"Unchangeable,\" the ballad side, tends toward the big band. Lyrics are well above average for Chicago professional songwriter product. But neither side is really doowop, though we suspect the group was capable of it.\n\nStepheny-Spinning did a couple of things to promote the record. In June, DJ Jim Lounsbury started a series of dances for teenagers, each Saturday night at the West End Ballroom, 121 North Cicero. A couple of live acts would appear, and the rest of the dancing would be to records. Debbie and the Diplomats, identified as Stepheny recording artists, were one of the two acts scheduled for the first event (Suburbanite Economist, June 4, 1958, p. 20). In July Debbie and crew were on the bill at the Chaudiere Rose Room in Ottawa, six weeks after the Ebon-Knights had put in an appearance (Ottawa Citizen, July 15, 1958, p. 23). They got further work in Canada, at the Casa Loma in Montréal (The Gazette, July 31, 1958, p. 12).\n\nIt would be nice to hear the quartet singing the songs it featured most nights. Stepheny had no intention of trying that; it did not invite Debbie and the Diplomats back to the studio.\n\nWe don't know the group's whereabouts in the early part of 1959, but one of the engagements they had lined up was for a June dinner dance, to be put on by the Junior Cancer League in the far south of Chicago. They were to appear with Ted Sieber's orchestra, which had recorded for Stepheny in 1957 (see above, SF1808), and a comedian then known as Stan Howard (Rhea Rosenberg, \"Jr. Cancer League Sets Dinner Dance,\" Chicago Daily Calumet, April 28, 1959, p. 4). You'll be reading more about Stan Howard. For now, suffice to say that his real name was Stanley H. Brasloff, he was born in Philadelphia a little before 1930, he entertained troops during World War II, we've found newspaper ads for his club appearances going back to 1948, and for a while he'd been based in Chicago, where in 1948 he'd headed a show for teenagers on WGN-TV.\n\nIn the summer, it looked as though there would be a single by the group for another company, even an LP, with emphasis on songs the group did regularly. A blurb in The Gazette (\"New Show Tonight at Casino,\" August 28, 1959, p. 11) for an appearance at the Bellevue Casino in Montréal said the group's recording of a medley from My Fair Lady was a hit, and that \"The Best Things in Life Are Free,\" \"Old Fashioned Girl,\" \"I Love You Truly,\" and \"Shake Rattle and Roll\" were on the LP. A record deal had fallen through.\n\nWhat's interesting is that Debbie and the Diplomats were on a released recording in 1959. It slipped past without an allusion in the Montréal blurb, or in any other we've seen for the group. An LP on RCA Victor's budget subsidiary, Camden, featured a studio band honoring Jean Goldkette, a legendary leader and impresario of the 1920s. In 1959, Goldkette was somewhere between 61 and 66 years old. He was still playing the piano, though he hadn't featured jazz for years and hadn't made a commercial recording since 1929. Chauncey Morehouse, the drummer, was the only musician who had been in his band in the 1920s. Goldkette was on board as the nominal leader, while Irving Brodsky played piano on the date. The arrangements to \"Dinah\" and \"My Pretty Girl\" were taken directly off old records; the other tunes (all from the era, but not previously recorded by any Goldkette band) were arranged for the date by Sy Oliver. Although the other instrumentalists (such as Doc Seversinson, trumpet; Will Bradley and Urbie Green, trombone; Hank D'Amico, reeds; George Barnes, guitar and banjo) were too young to have played in it, they were fairly successful at recreating the band's sound in the late 1920s. Noboby tried to replace Bix Beiderbecke or Frankie Trumbauer, but the saxophonists aimed for a period sound in their solos and a violinist took several in the manner of Joe Venuti. There were vocalists on four tracks, doing one-chorus band singing: nothing was said about them or their performances in the notes, but they were credited on the labels. Lou Hurst sang \"Blue Skies\" and \"Who?\" in a period high tenor. Debbie and the Diplomats sang \"Always\" and \"Put Your Arms around Me, Honey.\" Reasonably, they weren't trying to sound like one of the vocal groups that Goldkette had recorded with. On \"Arms,\" the vocal arrangement didn't favor Debbie; the real problem was that it was the weakest song on the album. \"Always\" was a much better song and it yielded a better performance by the group; Bobby Christian (see above) might have learned a little from this rendition. Camden CAL 548 was recorded in New York City and was released on July 13, 1959. It didn't make a splash.\n\nTwo album cuts thus constitute the group's last known recording. Did RCA Victor record Debbie and the Diplomats at other sessions and then decide not to release anything? Or did another company do that?\n\nIn October 1959, Debbie and the Diplomats were at the Tower Club in Hot Springs, Arkansas. The advertisement (Fort Worth Star-Telegram, October 25, 1959, sec. 2, p. 14) has them in for \"one week only\" (October 26-31), but they might have extended their stay.\n\nIn January 1960, Debbie and the Diplomats appeared at a Chamber of Commerce banquet in Schererville, Indiana, as part of Paul Marr's All-Star Show (\"Munster Chamber Dinner Wednesday,\" The Hammond Times, January 10, 1960, p. A-11). The Diplomats kept working as a quartet. This was far from a sure thing in 1960. While the group was in the midst of a second, longer engagement in Hot Springs, up popped an announcement that Debbie would be leaving. On February 26, 1960, the Chicago Tribune (pt. 3, p. 14) stated that comedian Stan Howard was headed from Chicago to Hot Springs to \"get hitched to Debbie Kelley.\" Debbie was expected to leave the group and work with Stan instead (besides doing stand-up, he served as MC on some of his gigs). It appears they got married; possibly Debbie was also working with Stan and not the Diplomats in Hot Springs in April (the Southtown Economist had Stan Howard at one of the hotels there on April 12, p. 29). All we can say is, there would be more notices on Debbie and the Diplomats. In fact, their return visit to the Tower Club had been announced as running from February 15 to March 26 (Hope Star, Hope, Arkansas, February 15, 1960, p. 2). The only personnel change we know took place was that Al Hunt, bass, definitely took over the position once held by Mel Johnson, baritone (Bill Myrick, \"Lone Gal Adds Zip to Quartet,\" Atlanta Constitution, June 6, 1960, p. 22-A). We're indebted to Myrick for going behind the PR packet and actually interviewing members of the group. In August, the group was across the border again, at the Killarney Supper Club in Windsor, Ontario (Windsor Star, August 22, 1960, p. 21). Stan Howard had performed at the same joint, but wasn't on the bill this time. In early September, the group was at the Gay Haven Supper Club in Detroit (on September 9, the Detroit Free Press, p. 12, mentioned they were finishing up their engagement). On September 10, they were set for a dinner dance for the local Amvets chapter in Itasca, Illinois, along with Del Rene and his ork (Suburbanite Economist, August 31, 1960, p. 6).\n\nThe 1961 Diplomats, however, were reduced to a trio. Bert Sterling, an original Diplomat with 8 years of service, had left the group. And now there were noticeable gaps between their bookings. During the year, Howard Berhalter took at least two non-Diplomat gigs. There were also notices for Stan Howard and Debbie Kelley together, starting in June 1961.\n\nJune found Stan Howard and Debbie Kelley on the road, stopping at El Morocco in Montréal (The Gazette, June 12, 1961, p. 11). (A few weeks later, El Morocco brought Sun Ra and his Arkestra in for July 31, 1961, apparently under the misapprehension that they played rock and roll. The club's management fired them after two days.) In July Howard Berhalter and the other remaining Diplomat worked a two-week show in Minneapolis with a different soprano (\"First Rehearsals for Aqua Follies Are This Week,\" Minneapolis Sunday Tribune, July 2, 1961, p. 4). Howard Berhalter and Bert Hanson, who the paper noted was from Minneapolis, would be accompanying Catherine Emma, who was from Chicago and had been in the Lyric Opera, during the Aqua Follies shows from July 12 through 23. They had to be on hand to rehearse for at least a week before opening night.\n\nBerhalter and Hanson worked at least one Diplomats gig after the Aqua Follies. A review of the group's second run in Orlando that year (Stan Roberts, \"Debbie, Diplomats Big Hit\", Orlando Evening Star, August 22, 1961, p. 10-A), mentions a rendition of \"Down by the Riverside\" and describes \"Shake Rattle and Roll\" as the \"show-stopper\" (with abundant dancing and acrobatics). Medleys from Flower Drum Song and The Sound of Music were also included. Now what if Stepheny (or RCA Victor, or somebody) had recorded \"Down by the Riverside\" b/w \"Shake Rattle and Roll\"?\n\nIn October, Stan Howard and Debbie Kelley were once again at El Morocco in Montréal for a couple of weeks (The Gazette, October 21, 1961, p. 23).\n\nWe've seen no notices for Debbie and the Diplomats beyond the second Orlando, Florida appearance. The group ran out its string in 1961 without making another record. Some edition of the Diplomats had been performing for nearly 9 years. Debbie and the Diplomats had already together for 5 years according to Bill Myrick (\"Lone Gal Adds Zip to Quartet,\" Atlanta Constitution, June 6, 1960, p. 22-A). On calling it quits, they had worked for close to 7.\n\nIn 1962, Howard Berhalter went on tour with vocal group a lot like the old Ambassadors of Song. It presented classical and light opera material, along with an occasional pop or show tune, and logged many miles on the road. The group did include one female singer along with the eight men. The group got excellent reviews, except on the one occasion that the local newspaper critic was a voice teacher. In 1963, Berhalter, still identified as a singer, was living in Florida; he would turn 50 that year. In 1963, any references to the Diplomats were in the past tense: for instance, a singer and voice teacher named Bob Quint had, at different times, been a Jack Halloran Singer and a member of Debbie and the Diplomats (The News Palladium (Benton Harbor, Michigan), April 10, 1963, p. 11). Howard Berhalter lived in South Florida for many years, moved to Palm Springs, California, for a while, then came back to Florida. He died in Fort Lauderdale on July 2, 1997, at the age of 84. In his obituary, all those years he'd committed to vocal groups rated half of one sentence, which mentioned only an \"all-male\" group (The Desert Sun, Palm Springs, California, July 7, 1997, p. B2).\n\nDebbie Kelley made a fair number of appearances with Stan Howard from 1962 to 1968. A radio program in Miami, Florida, in 1966, noted that it was (approximately) their fifth wedding anniversary. Once in a while, Stan was on the bill with another vocalist; we haven't seen any notices on Debbie singing solo without Stan. The last notice we've found is from May 1968.\n\nIn 1972, Stan Howard was still doing stand-up when he needed the money, but he'd recovered the identity of Stan Brasloff, spent a fair amount of time (uncompensated) around movie sets learning how they were made, and produced an independent film that was in theatrical release. To publicize the film, a couple of newspapers ran lengthy interviews with him. Debbie was never mentioned, either in the day's news or in reminiscence; the implication was that they were no longer together. After his movie failed to run up grosses at the box office, we quit finding press notices on Stan, under either last name. Nothing further until 1995, when Stan was married to the former Cecilia Gallo and his stepdaughter, Dina Gallo, was getting married in Florida. Stan Brasloff died in Philadelphia on April 17, 2003 (Philadelphia Inquirer, April 19, 2003, p. C11).\n\nStepheny SF1827, by Jack Fascinato and Orchestra, featured two instrumentals and was taken off Fascinato's LP, MF 4004. Right off the LP: the matrix numbers for the single immediately follow those for the two sides of the album. We promise to tell more of the story below. The sides had been recorded by Fascinato in his home studio, most likely in 1956. Fascinato had some success leasing his vocal sides to KaHill and Fraternity. But such companies didn't think his instrumentals would sell, and just two were picked up. \"Diggin' Duggan\" and \"Road Runner\" were among those that had to wait until Stepheny elected to make 14 Fascinato tracks into an LP.\n\n\"Duggan\" brings instant immersion into a world of sound like no other. The theme is stated on tuned bongos. Fascinato's themes often sound like Western Swing (how often did he use some of these lines behind Tennessee Ernie Ford?). But then Fascinato's musicians improvise on them. (We have no way of telling which instruments heard on these sessions were played by other people, or by how many other people, and how many by Fascinato himself.) \"Duggan\" includes an electric guitar solo that is definitely jazz; there are contributions on string bass, drums, several other percussion instruments, heightened with a couple of splashes of accordion. \"Road Runner\" uses a similar ensemble. Now the theme is stated on accordion (with the restraint characteristic of Reno Tondelli; again see below), there is a solo on tuned bongos, and other percussion is again spotlighted. Each piece is jukebox operator length: 2 minutes or less.\n\nThe Fascinato single was reissed on 45 rpm in the Netherlands, on a label called Delahay (SF5003).\n\nSun Ra would feature tuned bongos on a memorable session. It was done in New York in November 1965; Sunny and the core of his Arkestra had made their exit from Chicago in 1961. The Ra's esthetic aims, in the 1950s and in the 1960s, were entirely different, but one has to wonder: did the former Sonny Blount ever cross paths with Jack Fascinato, when they were working in Chicago? It seems like the kind of meeting that cosmic forces would have strained and lashed against. Except that there was time; Sunny and Jack were both on the scene from 1946 through 1956.\n\nStepheny SF1828, credited to The Sunny Nodaks, aimed at even more of a niche market. Someone had anticipated the nicheness; the single is designated as a Limited First Edition. Steele and Fulton had written a jingly number to promote North Dakota, with the vocal version on Side A and the instrumental version on the flip. To put commercial potential in perspective, in the late 1950s the city of Milwaukee had about 100,000 more inhabitants than the the entire state of North Dakota.\n\nLike SF1814, this was a record to promote a song: vocal on one side, instrumental version on the other. There are no surprises on the vocal side. Instrumentation is similar to what we've heard from the Bush Leaguers: trumpet, alto sax, accordion, piano, banjo, tuba, drums. There's a male vocal quartet, members of which might have already celebrated the Milwaukee Braves. The song, whose lyrics (\"Say hello ta/ North Dakota,\" etc.) we may describe as uncomplicated, is performed first as a polka, then more slowly as an unaccompanied barbershop quartet (the singers know their business), finally as a fast march, with added piccolo. Corny, but there's craft in it.\n\nThen we flip the record over. We're not in North Dakota any more. We've got Dixieland. By a serious band: trumpet, trombone, clarinet, piano, banjo, tuba, drums. The clarinetist gets a solo. The banjo player gets a solo (with a worked-out background). The trombonist solos. All are really good.Then there's a final flourish from the drummer. Wait a minute... did Danny Alvin's band take over? To our knowledge, no one's ever said that Alvin and crew played on SF1828. But they did record for Stepheny (see below). Maybe someone talked them into one more quick visit to the studio. For Danny Alvin, it could have been his very last visit; this session seems to postdate the two for his LP.\n\nStepheny SF1829 consisted of two weepers sung by Bob Laurie and backed by the Allan Webster Orchestra; they'd scored their second session for the label. This time around, the piano part dispensed with no clichés, but was no longer ricky-tick. Three or four backup singers also participated. The only instrument to get any prominence was the guitar; problem was, it needed to be a steel guitar. These songs weren't going to work without whole-hog Nashville production, and they didn't get it. Laurie probably didn't have the right vocal quality in any case. \"Our Last Dance\" still sounds dejected after we learn that that the beloved changed her mind, whispered in his ear, and they're still in their last dance. If you don't listen carefully to the words, you'll miss the twist.\n\nTommy Nichols was a pop singer who had been active in and around Chicago for around a decade, often accompanying himself on piano. He didn't record often. His only other appearances on singles had been for Chess in January 1953 (the Chess brothers, in an abortive early foray into pop music, hired a violin-laden studio ork to back him), then on one side of a Lee Monti record for Sharp farther into the year. His single on Stepheny SF1830 was in the same Italian vein as his appearance with Lee Monti.\n\nNichols had a good voice. We regret to say he made substantially better use of it on the Chess session. The Villa Venice Orchestra included, by our estimate, four violins, three trombones, a harp, guitar, piano, bass, and drums, plus a bunch of backup singers. All it lacked was an accordion. \"Three Sisters\" is an imitation Italian pop number, sung partly in Italian, partly in English. It's cute, but the overproduction wins. \"Miss You\" is all in English, the choir takes a hike, and trombones and violins play muted. Nichols compensates by going over-the-top melodramatic.\n\nBevi Wright got a little promotion in Cash Box, as a new artist Stepheny had plans for. She was described as a folk singer and the company was going to give her not one whole LP, but one whole series of LPs. Mort Hillman knew Art Ford, a prominent DJ based in Newark, New Jersey, and Ford had recommended her (\"Stepheny to Enter Package Market,\" Cash Box, May 10, 1958, p. 84). If the Cash Box article is credible, Stepheny had already signed Bevi Wright in May. Meanwhile, there was a little matter to regulate: Ms. Wright had to finish high school. She did not make an appearance in Chicagoland until July, when she was performing at the Gate of Horn on a bill with the Gateway Singers. (The Gate was the ideal venue for a folkie in Chicago in 1958; somebody'd worked to land this gig for her). At the Gate of Horn she accompanied herself on the guitar. The Tribune scribes liked her. She told one (July 13, 1958, pt. 7 p. 8) that she wasn't sure whether she wanted to be a folk singer, a pop singer, or some combination thereof. She was 18 and had just graduated from high school in New Jersey. Another spot of coverage (Chicago Tribune, July 27, 1958, pt. 3 TV-radio) stated that at age 5, she had been on a Mutual Radio Network children's show out of New York City, that she had been singing folk music in public only for a few months, and that this was her first engagement away from home.\n\nIn the end all that materialized was one single, Stepheny SF1831. The single was recorded in August. It looks to us as though Bevi Wright, the enthusiasm of a couple of scribes notwithstanding, didn't stick around Chicago long enough to do another session. Very likely, this was because she didn't find more work in Chicago. Despite early lofty expectations, the company did not release anything else of hers, not even the two further tracks that she might have made at a four-tune session, and probably didn't try to record anything further.\n\n\"You Know You Belong to Somebody Else\" is a pop tune. It's one that Bevi Wright was comfortable with and that she could deliver while accompanying herself on the acoustic guitar. Stepheny/Spinning wasn't satisfied leaving it to Bevi and her guitar. A good-sized choir edged into the studio, and whoever did the vocal arrangement had them sing \"leave me alone\" more loudly than any of the other words assigned to them. It's Wright, we think, who wanted to be left alone. Wright's own song, \"Lost Love,\" was an ordinary ballad, but it too would have benefited from a less-is-more policy. Now, in addition to the choir, there was a soap opera organ (Frank Paige again?), plus a rhythm section of piano, guitar, bass, and drums in which Wright didn't seem to be participating. At times she seemed to be forcing, just to be heard over the overproduction.\n\nStepheny SF1831 was released in September, receiving a tepid review in Billboard (October 13, 1958, p. 42) and, as usual, a more favorable review from Cash Box (October 25, 1958, p. 10). We wonder whether Bevi Wright was singing in public when the reviews came out.\n\nShe didn't have much more of a run. In January 1959, Bevi Wright was in a stage production of Eugene O'Neill's Desire under the Elms at the North Jersey Playhouse in Fort Lee (\"'Desire' Stars Husband, Wife,\" Bergen Evening Record, January 27, 1959, p. 26). In July 1960, she was singing again, at The Embers in Akron, Ohio, on a bill with Jimmy Boyd, a jazz pianist (Akron Beacon-Journal, July 12, 1960, p. 37). She was billed as a \"Lovely Shad Recording Star.\" he gig was good for a couple of weeks, judging from the ads that the club ran (they're the only ads we've ever seen for Bevi Wright). Shad Records, one of many labels operated at one time or another by industry veteran Bob Shad, was active in 1959 and 1960. It was partial to vocal groups from Long Island or North Jersey, probably also to recommendations from Art Ford. So it's plausible that Shad recorded Bevi Wright; problem is, we can't find a release by her. While in Akron, Bevi Wright was talked into making an ad for Garner Brothers Drive-In, located a couple of blocks from The Embers. How she really felt about being photographed holding up a king-sized It sandwich, we aren't sure we want to know (\"Who Is It? What Is It?\" Akron Beacon-Journal, July 20, 1960, p. 43).\n\nUnless someone digs up a released 45 on Shad, we can credit Bevi Wright with just one other commercial recording after her Stepheny. It was for Cap Records, a small company that first used an address in the Woods Building in Chicago; the label was fitfully active from 1962 through 1979. Presumably she had to return to Chicago to record Cap C-073, \"Teen Dreams\" b/w \"His Arms Are Open Wide.\" The songwriters and publishers would have been familiar from her time with Stepheny, and we doubt she brought her guitar. Lew Douglas arranged the session and conducted the studio ork. The year is said to be 1962. C-073 didn't advertise the connection on the label, but some other Cap 45s identify it as a subsidiary of Cha Cha. Cha Cha, run by Don De Lucia, songwriter and proprietor of Don-Del Music, had been assisted at its launch in 1960, when Stepheny brought Cha Cha into a cooperative distribution arrangement called the Discmaker's Group. We haven't found another notice on Bevi Wright anywhere; apparently her career as a singer ended when she was 22.\n\nThe Four Four's were another male vocal quartet. That's all we know. We're indebted to Dr. Robert Stallworth for a copy of their record, which isn't often found today. Margie Maye, the composer of \"Cry and Cry and Cry\" for the second Bob Laurie single, reappeared here as the co-composer of \"Where Are You.\" Now she was going as Marji Maye.\n\nThe Four Four's aimed at, and achieved, a square ensemble sound. There must have been dissension about the kind of music they were performing. If one focuses on the piano, guitar, bass, and drums, both songs have reliable R&B underpinnings. Had the melody and harmony moved somewhat predictably on top of these, the performances might not have been special, but they would have been good enough to play on popular radio. So how do we explain the trumpet here, the trombone there, the baritone sax somewhere else, throwing out Swing licks? On \"Where Are You,\" we keep hearing from a trombone off to the side, muted, and a baritone sax up front, never dropping below ff. The incongruous elements make for music that's mildly weird, massively unsure of its identity.\n\nPercussionist, bandleader, and composer Bobby Christian had been a Salem artist. We can't rule him out as a session participant in the early going. We suspect it was Mort Hillman who signed him to Stepheny (if so, signing him could have been the last major action that Hillman took before departing for New York). As 1958 began, Christian was recording for other small labels. He also made an LP for Mercury, Mr. Percussion, that was freshly recorded at Universal, in stereo; apparently Christian didn't keep possession of the masters, either. \"Crickets on Parade\" and \"I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles,\" as they appeared on the Mercury LP, were remakes. \"Mr. Percussion\" could have been made some months prior, but was released in November 1958. A session for Stepheny, right after the Mercury LP was released, resulted in SF1833, coupling \"Caravan\" with an original called \"Boola.\" Stepheny got the record out in a hurry. Christian normally employed a regulation big band, with trumpet, trombone, and saxophone sessions; \"Boola\" and \"Caravan\" were made without the band. \"Boola\" seems to be purely the work of Christian and his guitarist, with help from overdubs. \"Caravan\" adds a string bass and an \"obbligato by Vernyle\" (we'll explain that later). Judging from the J series numbers, there was a followup session a week or so later, which contributed to at least Stepheny SF1835 out of Christian's 1959 releases.\n\nChristian and band were playing a lot of engagements in 1958, including college and even high school dances. One of their bigger gigs, in the approximate time frame, was at the Martinique restaurant during the holiday season (Southtown Economist, December 24, 1958, p. 10). Stepheny Records also went forward with a Bobby Christian LP, probably planned soon after signing but deferred till early in 1959. \"Boola\" and \"Caravan\" would be included on it, along with other tracks almost certainly recorded at the same sessions.\n\nStepheny and Spinning, as our comment on signing Bobby Christian might have indicated, underwent a major shake-up in November 1958. Mort Hillman was approaching the end of a one-year contract. Instead of renewing it, he moved to New York City, where he'd probably wanted to be for a while. He settled in the Whitestone neighborhood of Queens. Hillman's first gig in the Apple was Vice-President and General Manager of Citation Records, run by arranger Irving Szathmary (\"Mort Hillman Joins Citation,\" Cash Box, November 29, 1958, p. 37). On April 13, 1959, Hillman became the top executive for DJ Art Ford, who had several enterprises to operate when not spinning disks: Ford was making movies, doing music publishing, running jazz festivals, and giving public speeches (\"Hillman to Ford Office,\" Cash Box, April 18, 1959, p. 52). And as we've noted, Hillman and Ford already knew each other (it's possible Hillman had worked for Ford before he moved to Chicago). In September 1959, Hillman took over as general manager for sales and A&R, reporting to Sidney Siegel at Seeco Records. Seeco (\"Mort Hillman New Seeco Gen. Mgr.\" Cash Box, September 19, 1959, p. 33) was expanding from Latin music (which had long been its specialty) into pop, and Hillman was expected to recruit and sign artists; he even got a couple of jazz musicians to record LPs for the label. Mort Hillman settled in at Seeco for three years. He was also able to get his (first?) wife, Marcia, involved in some of the company's projects. Over the next decade, Hillman would change jobs a few more times, but the relocation was permanent.\n\nNorman Forgue took his time before bringing aboard another VP in charge of sales; Ralph Cox, who'd worked for a number of distributors in Chicago, was hired in January 1959. Cox would last a few months, in a more narrowly defined role. Cox visited distributors and talked to Cash Box, but there is no evidence that he either expected, or was allowed, to do any A&R. Forgue had a backlog of Hillman projects on his hands, so the company's new recording slowed considerably while Cox was in charge of sales.\n\nMatrix Artist Title Release Number Recording Date Release Date J9OW-0359 The Mar-Vellos Boyee Yoing (Duncan-Johnson-Dapper) Stepheny SF1818 January 1958 January 1958 J9OW-0360 The Mar-Vellos Come Back My Love (De Lucia-McDonald) Stepheny SF1818 January 1958 January 1958 J9OW-0463 Cheerful Earfuls The Drag — Number One (Frye or C.

Stepheny opened a subsidiary called Spinning (unfortunately, kind of an obvious name for a record label). From the J series numbers, we can see that the first Spinning releases were being worked on around the same time as the first Stepheny LPs. The subsidiary's labels were mostly light green or green-blue in color and the logo looked nothing like the Stepheny logo. Release numbers were in an HM6000 series. Mort Hillman's initials, backwards?\n\nSpinning was immediately oriented toward rock and roll (which arrived late at the parent label) and doowop.\n\nFirst out was a batch of three. Mort Hillman had introduced Salem 45s the same way.\n\nEddie Thomas, a credible rock and roller, would show up later on Stepheny SF1837; the rationale for trading labels remains opaque to us. One side of Spinning HM6001 was a clever novelty number complaining that his girlfriend wouldn't hold him tight, except when they were watching a horror movie and she was frightened out of her wits. Accompaniment was by piano, electric guitar, string bass, and drums. Lots of shrieking was laid on to create an acceptable Halloween novelty. We've heard \"Frankenstein Rock\" because it's available online; the flip still eludes us.\n\nThe Jim Eddy single on HM6002 also aimed at rock and roll. This time the company was partly successful. The ballad side, \"Cry Cry Cry,\" used Eddy's agreeable tenor to portray a high school boy who had broken up with his girlfriend. Even if Jim Eddy was really 15 years older than the protagonist, he sounded right. Accompaniment was piano, electric guitar, string bass, and drums; enticements to overproduce were stoutly resisted. We wish we could say the same for \"The Bells of Love,\" where the previous ensemble is partly smothered by three extremely busy female backup singers. Maybe the company thought the backup singing would keep the song's scrawny joints from being exposed. The money would have been better expended on a better song...\n\nThe Petites were a family vocal ensemble. They were from northwestern Iowa (Emmetsburg) and before they recorded were known as the Pettit Family. The parents were Claude and Marie Pettit. Marie did the initial vocal coaching and training. The group first appeared in public in 1947, at a firemen's ball in Emmetsburg. The oldest newspaper notice we've found, in the Algona Upper Des Moines (\"Recent Visitor in Europe to Give Address,\" October 11, 1951, p. 9) announced the annual meeting of the Kossuth County Farm Bureau, to take place at Burt High School. \"Entertainment will be furnished by the Kossuth County Rural Women's Chorus, the Pettit family from Emmetsburg and the German Township Male Quartet.\" In its earliest edition, the group consisted of the four oldest children, Alice, Bob, Pati, and Mary; their mother provided accompaniment. As children grew up, the personnel shifted; Claudia joined the group some years before the Stepheny/Spinning session. The family moved to Ruthven and then to Spencer. By the mid-1950s, the Pettit Family was drawing lots of press notices from Iowa newspapers. In 1956, the family was living in Des Moines. In 1957 the vocal group was working regularly with a band. For instance, the Pettit Family with Ralph Zarnow and His Orchestra were booked into the Surf Ballroom in Clear Lake, Iowa, for July 20, 1957 (Mason City Globe-Gazette, July 12, 1957, p. 8)\n\nOn their two singles for Spinning, the blend makes it hard to tell how many by ear, but our best estimate is four female voices. No tricky harmonies, but the girls' ensemble was the kind that could be achieved only from years of working together. In order of age, the girls were Alice, Pati, Mary, and Claudia Pettit. The brother, Bob Pettit, appears in many photos and descriptions of the group, but on Spinning HM6005 he isn't audible. We hear Bob on Spinning HM6003, where he's allotted a few solo lines on \"Marguerite.\" Instrumentation throughout the session is electric guitar, tenor saxophone, piano, bass, and drums; they sound like the group's regular accompanists. he instrumental ensemble is notably tight, with frequent sax-guitar unisons. \"Blessed Are\" is a song of mild religious sentiment, well executed. \"Marguerite\" is a teen-girl kind of song, cut to a sturdy pattern that pre-dates rock and roll. \"Sweetie Pie\" shows the group had roots in Country music; is that really a steel guitar? \"Light Plug\" is novelty song about someone suddenly taking down the illumination at a party, with a predictable effect on the protagonist's male escort. Again, cute and well executed. One could argue that \"Light Plug\" wasn't a song for pre-teens, like Claudia.\n\nThe Petites cut four sides and, unsually with this company, all four were released; Stepheny/Spinning thought there would be sales. The group certainly attracted attention. After an appearance on Arthur Godfrey's show, where they eventually came in second, The Petites were signed (reportedly it was a $30,000 contract) to appear regularly on George Gobel's TV show, starting on September 23, 1958. Unfortunately for the company, this meant that in August 1958, getting ready for their TV work, the group moved to Southern California. Nonetheless, the release of HM6005 was held till September and the Petites' first televised appearance on the Gobel show. A description of the group that ran in various newspapers (su"
