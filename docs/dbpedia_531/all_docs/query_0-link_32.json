        "text": "(Left to Right): The O'Rahilly, Ellen Mangan, Richard Rahilly, Nell, Anno.\n\nPhoto c.1887.\n\nSee larger and full size. Richard Rahilly,\n\nborn Ballylongford, Co.Kerry, bapt 31 Dec 1839.\n\nSee Wikipedia and Wikitree.\n\nA highly successful businessman, shop-keeper and entrepreneur in Ballylongford and N Co.Kerry.\n\n\"A patriarchal figure not only in his own family but also in that of his younger brother\" [Gaughan, 1986].\n\nHe was educ boarding school, Ennis, Co.Clare (must be Springfield House).\n\nAodogán had his French exercise book from this school, beautiful copper plate writing.\n\nHe sp bapt of his 1st cousin Mary Ann Hickie's child Daniel Broder 1857.\n\nHe wrote on 7 Apr 1858 from Ballylongford to his brother Michael Joseph [P102/26]. \"Business is very dull at present in Ballylongford\".\n\nHe took over family business in Ballylongford c.1860, in the old Rahilly house, Ballylongford.\n\n\"Richard Rahilly\" (note not Mrs. Rahilly) is listed in Ballylongford in 1861 as baker, draper, fish curer and merchant, grocer and one of the principal farmers [\"Memory Lane\", The Shannonside Journal, 1994, p.121].\n\nHe may have had a previous marriage with a child born 1862.\n\nHe sp the bapt of his 1st cousin Edward McEllistrem 1863.\n\nHis mother and brother died 1866. He wrote some family dates in [P102/29].\n\nHe is described as \"merchant\", living Ballylongford at marriage.\n\nRichard mar 1868 to Ellen Mangan [bapt 24 Nov 1835].\n\n\"Richard Rahilly, Ballylongford\" is listed under \"Bakers\" and \"Grocers\" and \"Drapers\" in [Slater's directory, 1870].\n\nHe sp bapt of David Joseph Hickie January 1872.\n\nHe sp bapt of his wife's niece Catherine Mangan Feb 1872.\n\nThe Rahilly business:\n\nRichard built up his parents' business, expanded into many fields.\n\nHe was a grocer, spirit dealer, shopkeeper, baker, miller, fish curer, draper, general merchant, farmer, landowner, importer, inventor, post office and shipping agent. He became the wealthiest man in the area.\n\nThese were prosperous times for Ballylongford at the mouth of the Shannon. Royal Navy craft were frequent visitors to Ballylongford Bay. The port served much of the outlying area, even Limerick. (The town is much reduced in importance today.)\n\nRichard was apparently not a publican. He sold wine and spirits but apparently did not run a public house.\n\nHe is listed among \"grocers and spirit dealers\" but not among \"public houses\" in [Slater's directory, 1870].\n\nHe is listed as a grocer in [Bassett's, 1880-81], which also confirms he was a spirit dealer.\n\nHe is in \"grocers and spirit dealers\" but not in \"public houses\" in [Slater's, 1881].\n\nHe is in \"grocers\" but not in \"vintners\" in [Guy's, 1893].\n\nAodogán met a woman in Ballylongford who said her uncle bought the shop from Rahillys, and there was a great store of wines in the cellar under the shop.\n\nRichard was wealthy enough by 1874 to build a fine new 3 storey Rahilly house, Ballylongford, beside the old Rahilly house, at corner of main crossroads, the only 3 storey house in Ballylongford.\n\nRichard was a mainstream constitutional nationalist when younger. (He does not seem nationalist later in life.)\n\nHe attended Daniel O'Connell centenary celebrations in Dublin in Aug 1875 [Bourke, 1967].\n\nIn Sept 1875 he took part in an enthusiastic Home Rule meeting in Ballylongford which was addressed by Rowland Ponsonby Blennerhassett, Home Rule MP for Co.Kerry.\n\nSee his licence to carry arms, granted 1876.\n\nHe is listed as \"grocer\" at Margaret's death in May 1877 [GROI].\n\nRichard was at another moderate nationalist meeting, the North Kerry Farmers' Club, at Ballylongford on Fri 14 Sept 1877. See report in Irish Times, September 18, 1877. Again Rowland Ponsonby Blennerhassett, Home Rule MP for Co.Kerry, gave a speech. Richard seconded a vote of confidence in Blennerhassett. Reports that it was a Land League meeting are incorrect.\n\n[Bassett's, 1880-81] lists Richard as shipping agent, grocer, spirit dealer, baker, draper, hardware dealer, \"iron, coal and timber yard\" and \"artificial manure and seed merchant\", also listed under \"hotel keepers and posting establishments\", but not yet postmaster. (His 1st cousin Mark McEllistrem is postmaster.)\n\nApparently became postmaster for Ballylongford in 1880-81. Note that the sensitive job of postmaster would have to be approved by Dublin Castle, would only go to those considered loyal.\n\n[Slater's, 1881] lists him as the postmaster for Ballylongford, and also lists him under \"bakers\" and \"grocers and spirit dealers\" and \"linen and woollen drapers\".\n\n[Letter by Eliza Patt, 1881] says: \"you never saw such a deserted place now as Ballylongford. It's Richard Rahilly that holds the Post Office there now ... He is the only person that is doing any business in Ballylongford now\".\n\nHe was very progressive, inventive.\n\nHe wanted a machine to record sales in the shop. No such device on the market, so he proceeded to invent one of his own. It was said to be the first cash register seen in Munster. One story [O'Rahilly, 1991] is that an English salesman saw this, and his company started to design one of their own. Rahilly considered taking legal action, but was advised not to in the end. Another version of story [Bourke, 1967] is that Richard was inventing cash register, got into trouble with someone else's patent, which stopped him. See history of cash registers.\n\nIt was also said that the Rahillys were the first people in Ireland with a domestic fridge. He brought it from America. See history of fridges. He wanted to install an ice plant - could have shipped salmon by rail to Dublin, fresh for the London market - but his wife wouldn't support the plan. Years later The O'Rahilly said if they had put in the plant, he might never have left Ballylongford.\n\nHis wife Ellen put down almost every idea he came up with. She was against everything. Family story that she stopped him patenting something, and he always held that against her.\n\nAodogán in [O'Rahilly, 1991, p.16] says he asked Alfred about her. Alfred said he could sum her up in one word: \"She was a bitch.\" Alfred said Richard was terrified of her, used take refuge with their family.\n\nRichard was involved in setting up of the co-operative creamery in Listowel.\n\n[Gaughan, 1974] and [Gaughan, 2004] show that after many amalgamations Listowel co-op became Listowel Dairy Company, then Kerry Co-op, now Kerry Group (which owns Dennys).\n\nInvoice letterhead of 1885 describes him as \"R. Rahilly, Insurance, Steamship, Flour and Commission Agent\".\n\nEntry for Ballylongford in [Guy's, 1886] lists him as Postmaster, baker, draper, emigration agent, fish curer and merchant, grocer and one of the principal farmers.\n\nOn 22 June 1886, he wrote to his son Michael (age 11) regretting his own recent behaviour: \"I gave you so frequently .. bad example in many ways. .. I allude to my having\" [cut off edge, must be \"drunk more\"] \"than I ought on our trip to Queenstown, but which I trust that you will never again see from your father\". He urges Michael to \"avoid the possibility of such a sad thing occurring to you by .. joining the League of the Cross and becoming for all your life a total abstainer\" [P102/34].\n\nJustice of the Peace, Poor Law Guardian:\n\nRichard was a loyal British subject. He was a Justice of the Peace in Co.Kerry.\n\nAppointed JP on 19 Dec 1890 [P102/35].\n\n[Thom's] lists him as JP from 1892 edn.\n\nHe is listed as a JP when he signs a group letter in the Irish Times, February 12, 1891, from many JPs and notable figures of Co.Kerry, urging John Adye Curran, County Court Judge of Kerry, not to leave the county, and praising his work in reducing crime.\n\nHe was JP until his death 1896.\n\nIn a letter of 17 May 1891 [P102/44(14)] he refers to his brother-in-law Patrick Fitzgerald's support for Parnell: \"Patt of course with his accustomed aberration of intellect is a rabid Parnellite\".\n\nThough an anti-Parnellite, he rescued a Parnellite candidate from a mob at a meeting in Astee, nr Ballylongford, in July 1892 [Bourke, 1967]. This would be in general election, 1892, the first since Parnell's downfall and the split.\n\nIt is thought that his younger brother's brilliant children were helped through school and college by their rich uncle in Ballylongford.\n\nHe owned boats, sailed the Shannon and Atlantic coast. He went to race meetings, trips to England. Had summer vacations, mainly in Co.Clare.\n\nUnlike the Humphrys, the Rahillys and Mangans were very much interested in this world - comfort, beauty, gardens etc.\n\n[Guy's, 1893] lists him as JP, emigration agent, grocer, baker, draper, farmer, and agent for Bannatyne's flour and meal stores.\n\nRichard's last will dated 14 Mar 1893, with codicil apparently on the day he died, 24 Mar 1896.\n\n[Slater's, 1894] lists him as postmaster, grocer, draper, merchant and \"general dlr\" (would be \"dealer\").\n\nHe was a magistrate, sitting on the Board of Guardians in Listowel (Listowel Poor Law Union).\n\nNell's marriage settlement 1895 lists him as a JP. It shows he had shares in Guinness and Midland Great Western Railway.\n\n[P106/346] is letter of 25 Jan 1896 from him to Dr. David Humphreys. See image.\n\nRichard dies in 1896:\n\nRichard attended meeting of Board of Guardians in Listowel on Thur 19 Mar 1896 [The Kerry Evening Post, Sat 21 Mar 1896].\n\nThough [P106/318(5)] says it was Thur 12 Mar.\n\nHe cycled home to Ballylongford in torrential rain and wind for 9 miles. Got pneumonia.\n\nHe died at his house, Ballylongford, Tue morning 24 Mar 1896, age 56 yrs [The Kerry Evening Post, Sat 28 Mar 1896].\n\nNewspaper death notice in [P106/318(7)] and obituary in [P106/318(4)].\n\nHe was bur Lislaughtin Abbey near Ballylongford.\n\nNewspaper funeral list in [P106/318(5)].\n\nMass card in [P102/38] and [P106/37].\n\nEstate valued for probate at £24,945 [NAI]. This is about £10m in today's money.\n\nHe left his entire estate to Ellen. Estate granted to her 3rd Sept 1897 [NAI]. (todo) See papers in [P106/204].\n\nProbate granted at Limerick to his widow, of effects in England valued at £621, sealed at London 23rd February 1898 [National Probate Calendar, England].\n\nTheir son Michael Joseph took over business in Ballylongford. But he was anxious to marry and leave, and he sold it off 1898.\n\nEllen leaves Ballylongford:\n\nEllen left Ballylongford in 1898, and moved closer to her dau Nell (in Limerick city) by purchasing a grand country house, Quinsborough House, Co.Clare.\n\nQuinsborough was purchased by [Deed, Nov 1898]. Conveyance of house and lands to her dau Anno for £3000 (about £1m in today's money).\n\nEllen and her dau Anno lived at Quinsborough. Ellen always wanted to be gentry. She never liked being a shopkeeper's wife, no matter how wealthy. (Even though Mangans were only small farmers, they looked down on shopkeepers.)\n\nAfter Richard's death, Ellen continued supporting the education of T.F.'s brilliant children.\n\nNell and her family moved in with them at Quinsborough when Nell's husband Dr. David took ill. Apparently moved in in 1900. (Though Nell and David left their children there and went travelling.)\n\nEllen is listed in 1901 census at Quinsborough. She is described as \"Farmer\". Anno is with her. Her grandchildren Dick and Sighle are also with her, without their parents, who are travelling in Egypt. They have 3 servants living with them - a nurse, a female general servant and a coachman.\n\nQuinsborough is described as having 13 rooms. 12 windows in front of house. It has 11 out-buildings - consisting of 2 stables, 1 coach house, 1 harness room, 1 cow house, 1 calf house, 1 piggery, 1 fowl house, 1 turf house, 1 shed and 1 store.\n\nEllen dies in 1903:\n\nEllen attended Dr.David's funeral May 1903.\n\nHer will dated 16 June 1903.\n\nShe died at Quinsborough, Dec 1903, age 68 yrs.\n\nShe died 11 Dec 1903 [grave], [NAI], or 4 Dec 1903 [mass card], [GROI].\n\nMass card in [P102/42] and [P106/38].\n\nShe was bur Lislaughtin Abbey near Ballylongford.\n\nDick (age 7) and Sighle (age 4) were left alone in Quinsborough while everyone went to the funeral. Sighle told me she remembered they had a tremendous day sliding down the stairs on a tray. Their stern grandmother would have been horrified to know how they spent her funeral day.\n\nAdmin of estate granted to Nell, 13 Apr 1904, estate only £1,109. Richard's estate had been spent, and dispersed to the children.\n\nRichard and Ellen had issue:\n\nMargaret Rahilly,\n\nborn 5 July 1869, Ballylongford [GROI],\n\nbapt 10 July 1869 [Ballylongford RC par records].\n\nShe died as a baby, of diarrhoea, 25 Aug 1870, Ballylongford, age 1 yr [GROI].\n\nNell Rahilly,\n\nIrish revolutionary,\n\nborn Mary Ellen Rahilly,\n\nborn old Rahilly house, Ballylongford, Co.Kerry,\n\nborn 27 Apr 1871, according to family records and baptism entry (the next day).\n\nBirth cert says born 28 Apr but seems likely that is wrong.\n\nShe was bapt 28 Apr 1871, Ballylongford RC church. See baptism entry, part one and part two. From here.\n\nBapt sp by Thomas F. Rahilly and Ellen Mangan (probably her grandmother).\n\n\"Mary Ellen\" in Margaret Rahilly's will 1875 and at her marriage 1895. Often called \"Ellen\".\n\nAt marriage she is \"Maria Helena\" in church record but that is just the Latin. NOT Mary Elena or Mary Ellena.\n\nHer family later changed surname to O'Rahilly but she did not since she was already married by then.\n\nAnno O'Rahilly,\n\nIrish revolutionary,\n\nborn Anna Rahilly,\n\nborn old Rahilly house, Ballylongford, Co.Kerry,\n\nborn 17 Feb 1873 [GROI].\n\nSee birth notice in unknown newspaper. From [P106/318(3)].\n\nShe was bapt 19 February 1873 [Ballylongford RC par records].\n\nShe was known as \"Anna\" when young. \"Anna\" in Margaret Rahilly's will 1875 and on grave. NOT Anne.\n\nLater in life she adopted surname \"O'Rahilly\". Known as \"Anno\" when older.\n\n\"Aine\" in Irish.\n\nMichael Joseph O'Rahilly, \"The O'Rahilly\",\n\nthe 1916 leader,\n\nborn Michael Joseph Rahilly,\n\nborn new (3 storey) Rahilly house, Ballylongford (built 1874), Co.Kerry,\n\nborn 22 Apr 1875 [GROI].\n\nThough Aodogán O'Rahilly said he was born 21 Apr.\n\nThe plaque at the site indicates he was born in the new house. Though Mrs. Finucane (of the old Rahilly house, Finucane's pub, Ballylongford) says in 1966 letter [P102/548(3)] that The O'Rahilly was born in the old house, not the new house.\n\nHe was bapt 24 Apr 1875 [Ballylongford RC par records].\n\nNamed after his grandfather Michael Joseph Rahilly.\n\nNormally called \"Michael\" by family, sometimes \"Mick\".\n\nMargaret Rahilly (second Margaret),\n\nborn 12 May 1876, Ballylongford [GROI].\n\nShe died of bronchitis, 7 May 1877, Ballylongford, age 1 yr [GROI].\n\nNewspaper death notice in [P106/318(2)].\n\nBaptism of Nell Rahilly, 28 Apr 1871, Ballylongford.\n\nFrom here.\n\nRichard Rahilly sign.\n\nNow in Finucane's pub, Ballylongford.\n\nPhoto 2006. See full size.\n\nThis is thought to be Richard Rahilly's name carved (presumably when he was young) on a theatre seat in Dublin.\n\nBlathnaid O'Rahilly acquired this (sometime after 1951) when she was walking past a theatre being renovated in Dublin, either the Olympia Theatre or the Gaiety Theatre. Some of the workmen called to her and asked her wasn't she connected to the O'Rahillys. When she said yes, they gave her the carved seat.\n\nSee larger and full size.\n\nSee also The O'Rahilly carving his name (apparently following his father).\n\nRichard Rahilly listed among \"grocers and spirit dealers\" at Ballylongford in [Slater's directory, 1870].\n\nHome Rule meeting in Ballylongford, 1875\n\nThe Home Rule meeting in Ballylongford in 1875.\n\nRowland Ponsonby Blennerhassett, Home Rule MP for Co.Kerry (Isaac Butt's Home Rule party) speaks at Ballylongford on Mon 6 Sept 1875. Also present was the Irish nationalist politician and journalist Alexander Martin Sullivan.\n\nThere is praise for John Blake Dillon and the 1848 Rising.\n\nAmong those taking part is Richard Rahilly. He seconds various motions.\n\nFrom Tralee Chronicle, September 10, 1875. See p.1 and p.2.\n\nLetters\n\n[Letter by Eliza Patt, 1881] says: \"you never saw such a deserted place now as Ballylongford.

It could hardly refer to him.\n\nRichard's son Michael Joseph, \"The O'Rahilly\" had left university after illness.
