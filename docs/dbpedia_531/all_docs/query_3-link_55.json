        "text": "“Never in my life have I enjoyed going to the dentist until now. Fun, friendly and fast is the best way I can describe these visits. I am so grateful that a neighbor recommended Mangum Dental when we moved here four years ago. We have an adult daughter, who has Down Syndrome and is not the easiest patient to work with. But, the staff at Mangum Dental has the golden touch with her and all their patients.”\n\n“I was not a patient of this practice but I called during the holiday break with a horrific toothache. They got me in the same day and Dr. Ransdell’s first priority was to get me out of pain. He is truly a wonderful and caring dentist. I will definitely go back and refer all my friends to them.”\n\n“Did you ever wonder where dentists go when they need dental work?I see Brett Mangum at Mangum Dental (Yes….dentists need dental work too!).Not only is he a great dentist, who is very detail oriented….but he is the most caring, personable, and one of the nicest individuals I have ever met.I can give you my unqualified recommendation to see Dr. Brett Mangum when it’s time to see the dentist!Behind every great dentist is a great staff. His staff is one of the best I have ever seen in 35 years of doing dentistry. If I ever decided to come out of retirement…..I would want to work at Mangum Dental!”\n\n“I have always taken good care of my teeth so I have seen many dentists in my 64 years. My periodontist just retired so I was looking for a new dentist. I went to the Mangum practice because of a recommendation of a good friend. I was very happy with the doctor and staff. I will be continuing to visit the Mangum clinic.”\n\n“I am 29 weeks pregnant, my root canal had gone infected and without exaggeration i did not sleep even a minute that whole night, we just moved here from Texas and i don’t know any dentist in town, so i browse online and tried to fill up application and submitted appointments for next day, in so much deep pain i feltlike im already in labor…then i found Dr. Brett Mangum clinic online and their office hour that day which is friday starts at 7am….exactly 6:57 on my clock i just tried to dial, Ms. Valerie answered the call and i discuss my situation, she did accommodate me and put me in to 9am same day, since i have to travel 47mins to go down prescott….thank God for such a nice people like them, Ms. Johanna and Dr. Brett Mangum took care of me very well.Dr. Mangum discussed to me my options and thank God same day my pain is gone. He even follow up on me on weekend to check how am i doing. Highly reccommended dental clinic!”\n\n“Everyone there is great and I will certainly refer freinds and family members. We are new to the area and after 25 years with the same dentist, it was scary to make a change. You came highly reccomended by a co-worker and I am thrilled with this office, your service and staff!”\n\n“I couldn’t be happier with this business. I have been searching for a good affordable dentist for a couple years up here and today I found him! The staff is wonderful, professional and kind. The dentist is amazing and worked with me for a long time to make sure my treatment will be the best I can get for my budget. I am excited to go to the dentist! wow”\n\n“Dr Mangum is a kind, thoughtful and friendly dentist. His work is very good. He even called me on a Friday evening after implant procedure to see how I was doing. That blew me away- the consideration. He’s also great with kids. I was in the waiting room while he was giving care to a young child. He was very calm and reassuring.”\n\n“Mangum Dental will put you at ease with their quality work and unfeigned sincerity, in a warm and welcoming environment. I had two teeth pulled. The procedure was quick and painless. They worked with my budget and even followed up with me the next day to see how I was doing. Mangum Dental sets the bar for oral health care providers. ”\n\n“Everyone in this office is amazing I’ve never had such a good experience with a dentist. They provide tons of useful information, listen to you, address your concerns, and do a fantastic job with the cleanings, I actually didn’t leave in pain. The dentist takes time to sit with you and does not rush you out or treat you like you’re part of a mill. Can’t say enough nice things about this office”\n\n“Brett Mangum straightened my teeth with braces more than a year ago for a price that was less than competitors. After removing the braces, the retainer was having difficulty maintaining the correct position of two teeth, but Brett fabricated special retainers without charge to press the teeth back into alignment. I’m thoroughly satisfied with the results. My wife and I have been pleased with cleanings and fillings, too.”\n\n“I had an emergency! I had broken a moler in half. I am new to Prescott and didn’t have a dentist yet. I was referred by my sister to the Mangum office. They got me in right away and were able to save and fix the tooth. I am very grateful to have gotten such great service from a warm and caring staff. Thank you”\n\n“I had a preconception that my dental work was going to be less complicated. My Dentist explained my problem to me in a way I could understand. I am aware of what needs to be done and more importantly why. I have no anxiety in returning for the work to be started and then completed. I feel confident that I am in good hands.”\n\n“Everyone at Mangum Dental is amazing! They are very thorough, very nice, and make sure you understand everything going on. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a great dentist. It had been 24 years since I saw a dentist, and the staff made me feel at ease and glad I came in, and I look forward to going back.”\n\n“I was very impressed with how quickly I was able to be seen do to the nature of my problem. I was also very happy that you wre able to take care of my proble in a single visit and did not try to get me to schedule other work imeadiately.”\n\n“Outstanding service! I was at work when a bad molar gave way, I was in excruciating pain. Mangum got me in on an emergency basis and took care of me. They did a temporary root canal, followed by a permanent one and even let me make payments, thank you so much!”\n\n“After fearing a dentist for 45 years, Dr. Mangum made my dental experience delightful! He and his staff made me feel at ease throughout the procedures that I have received and is not afraid to discuss a service plan that will work with your insurance and your own budget. They can count on seeing me more often and I will definitely refer others to them.”\n\n“If anyone out there is having trouble deciding which dentist office to go to,,, look no further. Magnum Dental is very professional, yet friendly and I am very happy that I found this office. I had an emergency (twice) and they got me right in both times. I have a cleaning scheduled next, and once again, so happy I found this office. Thank you for your kindness and services.”\n\n“After very negative experience with another local dentistry Mangum was everything I had hoped for.The staff was polite, kind, professional and personable. Dr. J. Brett Mangum was a dentist who did what was best for me and he was confident and made me feel very comfortable. I was charged a very fare price (discount). I will go back to Dr.J.Brett Mangum as well as relate to others what a good dental office to visit with kind staff and a professional and knowledgeable dentist. Thank you so much for taking care of me today.”\n\n“I’ve been with you for over twenty years and have always received excellent care. I appreciate your friendliness and concern for my well being. I have told many others how well you have taken care of me.”\n\n“I HAD HAD 3 REALLY BAD EXPERIENCES WITH OTHER DENTISTS. THE STAFF AND DR MANGUM SR. MADE ME FEEL AT EASE AND IT WAS A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE. BY THEM CALLING ME BACK AND GIVING ME THEIR CELL PHONE # ON A LATE FRIDAY AFTERNOON TO MAKE ME FEEL LIKE THEY REALLY CARED. ALREADY HAVE MY NEXT APPOINTMENT SCHEDULED AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO THE APPOINTMENT. THANK YOU SO MUCH BOTH DR MANGUM’S FOR YOUR THOUGHTFULNESS AND WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE!!!!!”\n\n“If 5 is the maximum rating that I can give Mangum Dental can I use someone elses ratings as well? I found his demeanor as well as the staffs highly professional and very relaxing for the sensitivity of the work that they perform. I overheard Dr. Bretts’ conversation in the adjoining room with a paitent and found him to be very personable and somewhat humorous.”\n\n“I felt comfortable and well-informed as my wisdom teeth were removed. The removal was much faster than I expected, and recovery was good too. My cheeks didn’t even swell up! Both Dr. Richard Mangum and the assistant were very accommodating; she even took a few pictures for me like I requested. I recommend this dentist!”"
