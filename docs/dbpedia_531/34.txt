Source: Will of Henry Mangum, Isle of Wight Co, VA, mentioned his sons and

daughters and was witnessed by William Persons, Joseph Persons, Josiah Mangam.

Was this Josiah a brother, father?

The first record of a Menry Mangum in the New World is found in the records of

the Mill Swamp Baptist Church, Isle of Wight Co, VA. The records contain the

birth dat es of several children of Henry. They were Cathron, 1746, Briton,

Henry 1749, Richard, Ann, Samuel, John, Honour, Hearty, Martha, and Goodrich1768. No wife of Henry is mentioned but it wouild be interesting to know the

relationship between Henry and the two females mentioned in tjhe record, i.e.

Constantine Mangum and Agnes Mangum. Neither a land deed nor his will mention

his wife. There is no direct evidence as to who his parents were; however, it

is at least possible that he was a grandson or a son of John Frances Mangum who

were in Isle of Wsight Co by 1704.

Henry bought land in 1753 and 1760 keeping it until he sold it to his son,

Richard Mangum in 1782. He had some relationship, it would appear, with the

Person family. A good guess is that Henry was connected to this family by

marriage.

131. Samuel MANGUM (Frances Silvester BENNETT , Richard , Richard , Thomas , John , Thomas "of Clapcot" , John , Thomas , Thomas ) was born about 1722 in Albermarle Parrish, Surry County, Virginia. He died after 1761.

James Lynn Parham believes that his Pleasant Mangum, born in 1777 in NC, m Ann

Loyd in 1805 in Granville Co, NC, may have been a son of Samuel Mangum, son of

William Mangum, Sr. Lynn has found no documentation of the father of his

Pleasant. In my Mangum family history, I have listed Pleasant in the Chapter

entitled "Mangum Bits and Pieces" as we are unsure of his parents.

For recording keep purposes, I am placing Samuel in this family since there was

some relationship among these individuals.

!Samuel Mangum was a god parent along with William and Mary Mangum of a son of

James and Mary Mangum of the Albamarle Parish in 1743/44. He migrated to NC

with the rest of the Mangums and witnessed a deed there as early as 1751. He

obtained a land grant in 1756 which was originally surveyed for William in

1752. Samuel witnessed several deeds in Granville Co and was in the 1754

Granville Militia. He was living with Jno. TGompson in 1755 and therefore not

in the household of William and family. Samuel was a carpenter and planter.

In 1755 he took a nine year old orphan to teach him the carpentry trade. In

1757 he was the purchaser of the estate of James. He apparently died between

this date and 1758 when an account of his estate was made nearly 20 years later

and corrected. This account shows that Samuel left a widow and six children.

The names of his children are not given; however, we find a Howell Mangum

selling some of Samuel's land in 1773 and 1774 in Bute Co, NC.

This does not appear to be the Samuel Mangham of the Vaughn Ballard's "Solomon

Mangham." Perhaps he was a nephew?

Samuel married (MANGUM). (MANGUM) died after 1758.

They had the following children:

266 M i Howell MANGUM was born before 1758. He died after 1774 in Bute County, North Carolina.

"Descendants of Wiley Thomas Mangum & James Wilson Mangum" notes that Howell

Mangum may have been one of Samuel's six children, identifieed in the

administration of his estate in 1758. Howell Mangum sold some of the land

belonging to Samuel Mangum in 1773 and 1774 in Bute Co, NC. He may have been a

son of Samuel.
