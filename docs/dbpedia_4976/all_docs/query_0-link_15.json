        "text": "\"Giving back was a part of my father's philosophy of\n\nmaking money. He felt a genuine sense of gratitude for\n\nthe opportunities he had, and we feel the same way\n\ntoday,\" explains Malouf.\n\nHis political beliefs serve to reinforce his philanthropy.\n\n\"Everybody,\" states Malouf, \"believes in helping those\n\ntruly in need, but what's the most effective way to do it?\n\nIf you believe the government ought to do it, here's what\n\nyou have: (1) a program must be set up in Washington\n\nto function at the national, state, and local levels; (2)\n\npeople have to be hired to run these programs; (3)\n\nmassive regulations have to be published; (4) funds must\n\nbe appropriated, either through raising taxes or dcficit\n\nspending; (5) and if, perchance, the tax dollars do finally\n\ntrickle down, they will have been substantially diluted.\n\n\"The vastly superior alternative,\" argues Malouf, \"is to\n\ngive directly to fulfill the local needs, eliminating the\n\nnecessity of a federal program, bureaucracy, and budget\n\nto sustain it. If you give directly to meet a local need,\n\nyou get more mileage out of your dollars.\"\n\nThe city, named after the Canadian River, was settled\n\nin the 1880s and incorporated in 1887. The south fork of\n\nthe river knifes across the northern edge of the city. The\n\ndiversified economy is based on oil, agriculture, and the\n\nraising of cattle and quarter-horses. Wild turkey, deer,\n\nquail, and prairie chicken are nestled among the hills\n\noverlooking the serpentine valley that extends some 40\n\nmiles west-to-east across the Panhandle to the Antelope\n\nHills in Oklahoma, barely visible on the distant horizon.\n\nThe land is rugged, dominated by sagebrush but beauti-\n\nfied by the foliage of the cottonwoods in autumn.\n\nDriving through Canadian, the average person may\n\nperceive it to be \"another bland Panhandle town,\" but a\n\ncloser inspection reveals that such a perception is far\n\nfrom reality. There are many pockets of historical and\n\narchitectural interest in Canadian, for example:\n\n• The Women's Christian Temperance Union building\n\non Main Street, erected in 1911, is the only WCTU\n\nfacility in the U.S. still locally owned and operated.\n\nThe neat, red brick building now serves the commun-\n\nity as a library (upper floor) and community meeting\n\nhall (basement floor).\n\n• The beautiful Edward Abraham Memorial Home is a\n\nregional model for residential facilities serving senior\n\ncitizens. This facility was constructed in honor of the\n\nyounger Abraham brother who died in 1961 at the age\n\nof 44.\n\n• The Citadel is a showplace residence of the Dr.\n\nMalouf Abraham, Jr. family. It was originally built in\n\n1910 as the First Baptist Church. The renovation has\n\nwon national acclaim and publicity.\n\n• The antiquated three-story Moody Hotel, vacant since\n\n1960, has been renovated and refurbished into an\n\noffice complex to serve as the corporate offices for\n\nMalouf Abraham's enterprises and other tenants.\n\n• The picturesque 'big house' where the senior Abraham\n\nfamily lived until Nahim's death in 1964, is also being\n\nrenovated by Dr. Malouf Abraham, Jr., and wife\n\nTherese.\n\nMalouf, a vigorous man at age 68, still works hard—\n\nbut is increasingly reflective: \"During our family's 1961\n\ntrip to Lebanon, I remember looking steadily into the\n\neyes of a shepherd, a man about my own age, and I\n\nkept wondering if—had not my father come to Amer-\n\nica—that might have been me.\"\n\nIn 1987 the citizens of Canadian, Texas will collec-\n\ntively throw their hats in the air to celebrate the city's\n\ncentennial. In so doing, they will also be saluting the\n\nmemory of Nahim and Alia Abraham, pioneer builders\n\nof their community.\n\nStill very much alive in this small Panhandle city is the\n\ndaring and spirit that inspired a 17-year-old Lebanese\n\nboy to leave his homeland in quest of the American\n\ndream more than 80 years ago.\n\nCanadian owes much to the legacy of Nahim Abra-\n\nham.\n\nMr. Burch is a development consultant and writer who lives in\n\nAbilene, Texas.\n\ns\n\nThe Abraham family was reunited this fall during a\n\nreception at Texas Tech. Naceeb Abraham, right, greets\n\nMalouf, who was honored for his $150,000 endowment\n\ncontribution.\n\n16"
