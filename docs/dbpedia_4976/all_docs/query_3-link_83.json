        "meta_description": "Following the recent surge of interest in peculiar galaxies at high redshifts we consider the definition, or lack thereof, of morphological peculiarities on a sample of local universe galaxies. Studying the morphology of local universe galaxies is also of interest in trying to understand galaxy dynamics and quantifying the relations between morphology and environment. We use classifications given by five experts for a sample of 827 APM galaxies and find that there is little agreement between them on what qualifies as a peculiar galaxy. We attempt several objective approaches : matching galaxy images to ``templates''; examinig the 180-degree Asymmetry against Light Concentration (following Abraham et al. 1995); and exploring angle-dependent asymmetry measures. While none of the quantities we use results in a clean distinction between normal and peculiar galaxies, there is a rough correlation between some parameters and image peculiarity. However, the mixing between the two classes is significant. We conclude that the class of peculiar galaxies is not totally distinct from the class of normal galaxies, and that what we are seeing is really a sequence. It is therefore more useful to consider distribution functions of morphological parameters. The current and possibly other, more accurate parametrisations require better data, which is becoming available through CCD imaging.",
