Make sure you are running the right architecture too. I am not sure your processor can handle 64-bit but I may be wrong. Crosscheck that.\n\nHello,\n\nI looked in the BIOS and verified that I am already using Legacy boot mode (rather then UEFI). There is no option for enabling or disabling fast boot. The system still does not boot, so I think I’ll stick with my previous OS.\n\nThanks for your help!\n\nAbe"
