He studied in a religious state school and immediately went to work because he loved him with all his Lev and soul and gave up rest and did not sleep . He was drafted into the IDF in May 1961, and in the course of his duties he fell in Kuneitra on the 19th of Tishrei, 5710 (19.10.1967). He was laid to rest at the military cemetery in Haifa."
