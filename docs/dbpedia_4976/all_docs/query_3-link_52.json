        "text": "Objective: The purpose of the current study was to analyze both serum and salivary composition and oxidative stress markers in Type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) patients.\n\nDesign: Twenty consenting patients with DM but otherwise healthy patients aged 13-19 years and 12 healthy controls, matching in age and gender (Group 1), participated in the study. The patients were divided according to those who had controlled diabetes mellitus (Group 2) or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (Group 3). All were analyzed for saliva composition and antioxidants. Saliva was also analyzed for its levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and amylase activity, total IgA and total IgG concentrations and potassium, phosphorus, magnesium and calcium electrolyte concentrations.\n\nResults: A significant correlation was found between the severity of the DM/HbA1c values and the increase in both salivary and/or serum antioxidants (peroxidase, SOD and TAS), and the various TCL parameters (H1, H3, pre-incubation and oxygenation-potential)."
