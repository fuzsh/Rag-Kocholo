        "text": "Mark V. Ziesing Books\n\nSlippage, a collection by Harlan Ellison and Back in the USSA, an episodic novel by Kim Newman & Eugene Byrne were the two Ziesing books for 1997. Thus far in 1998, he has done Black Butterflies, a story collection by John Shirley. As Mark will tell you, he enjoys bookselling and publishing as they allow him to offer stuff that he'd enjoy having if he wasn't doing it himself. He hopes some of you share the same sort of oddball inclinations.\n\nTachyon Publications\n\nTachyon Publications is a small, publisher of science fiction and fantasy located in San Francisco. Their roster includes such contemporary authors as Peter S. Beagle and Jack McDevitt along with classic authors like Clifford D. Simak, Ward Moore and Stanley G. Weinbaum.

Over that period the company has published substantially more than 100 quality titles, placing an emphasis on book design and illustrations.
