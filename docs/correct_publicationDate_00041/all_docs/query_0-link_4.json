        "text": "November 4, 2016\n\nTry to picture this: a communist United States! It's been done before by plenty of alternate history (althist) authors, but probably never the way that historian/journalist Eugene Byrne and fiction author/weirdo Kim Newman have imagined it in this rollicking collection of novellas. Other althist writers would have been strict in determining exactly how the 20th century would have turned out if the United States had gone communist at its start, but this team does not go for this \"hard science fiction\" approach. Instead, they try a \"space opera\" approach and recast the historical roles of the century's major world powers: this communist USA becomes like the USSR, a still-Tsarist Russia takes the place of the United Kingdom, and Great Britain more closely resembles the United States. (Oh, and France is China.) This lets them have fun with presenting historical figures and events in a new way as Al Capone becomes this timeline's version of Joseph Stalin, and British and Russian soldiers fight American-backed Vietcong forces.\n\nAlthist purists may balk, and the question remains: why didn't Byrne and Newman try harder than substituting American socialist leader Eugene V. Debs for Russian socialist leader Vladimir Lenin? Well, perhaps they just felt that predicting an actual alternate timeline was futile. After all, there's no way they'd get every detail right no matter how much they research, and there's no way they could ever know if this is how it'd actually be. Or perhaps they thought it'd be more entertaining and interesting to do it this way. Althist writing for the sake of considering an alternate timeline is mostly an exercise in interpreting our own history. Why not just have some fun with it?\n\nSpeaking of which, they certainly seem to be enjoying themselves in the way that they reimagine historical figures in this timeline. Jack Kerouac and Howard Hughes are noncomformist drifters roaming the country by barnstormer, Isaac Asimov still lives in Russia and reads people's fortunes, and Alfred Hitchcock is a restaurant owner with a habit of poisoning past critics, among many others. Some of them are used specifically as replacements for the roles of real-life figures, much like how the world powers switch places - for example, Jean-Luc Godard is this world's Mao Zedong. Wikipedia has a list of them, though I didn't see Bill Clinton, listed as this world's Vladimir Putin, while reading the book.\n\nMore entertaining, at least for me, is the typical Newman trope of inserting fictional characters into the story. The main trigger of change in this timeline is that Teddy Roosevelt is assassinated and succeeded as president by Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles's film Citizen Kane), the epitome of American capitalist monsters; Tom Joad (John Steinbeck's Dust Bowl classic The Grapes of Wrath) is a folk hero of the proletariat; and Ensign Chekhov (yes, from Star Trek!) is the lover of a Russian princess, also among many others. The inclusion of such characters doesn't always work - the last section in particular includes JR Ewing, the Blues Brothers, and The Man with No Name in 1998 - but most of the time it makes things just a little more interesting.\n\nAll this is to say that the worldbuilding is quite excellent. Byrne and Newman are both experienced in writing althists, and it doesn't take long at all before they manage to immerse the reader in this familiar yet disturbing world. Better still, they do it without pounding it over our heads, meaning no one says, \"Man, can you imagine if we hadn't gone through a communist revolution in 1917?\" A lot of this is owed to Newman's writing style of interchanging paragraphs of exposition with paragraphs describing the actions of the moment, which seems adept for balancing worldbuilding with moving the plot along.\n\nBut none of this wouldn't work if we weren't invested in the protagonists, and thankfully, we are. It's exciting to see meek boy scout Charles Holdin Holley (known to most as Buddy Holly) stand up to his heroes, and by extension the communist government, in \"In the Air.\" We can't help but cheer when Debs and his rebel forces overthrow the disgustingly decadent robber barons at the end of \"Ten Days That Shook the World,\" even though we know that more villains will take their place. And the outcome of Melvin Purvis's hunt for a folk hero in \"Tom Joad\" is something to behold.\n\nI'll readily admit that some of the novellas are weaker than others. \"Citizen Ed\" is humorous, but not quite as compelling as the adventure stories that precede it. \"Abdication Street\" shows what Russia is like in this timeline, but otherwise feels rather fluffy. And there's something strangely disjointed about \"On the Road,\" the concluding story written specifically for this collection. It ends the book not with a bang, but with a whimper and some really weird imagery. But when the stories don't feel light and don't have trouble finding their tone, they're great.\n\nIt's a shame, then, that this book is so difficult to find. I've been looking (on and off) for this collection for years, and I couldn't even find it at my local libraries. Thankfully, an inter-library loan request gave me the gift to finally give it a try, and it's been worth the effort. Back in the USSA hits way more often than it doesn't, and even the lesser stories have great moments and interesting aspects to them.\n\nRandom Comments:\n\n- If I had to choose a favorite novella, it's easily \"Teddy Bears' Picnic.\" It's genuinely emotional to watch Bob's seemingly endless struggles, both as a soldier in the Indo-China War and as a veteran whose life story is repeatedly hijacked. Plus, the parts set during the war itself blend the first (and superior) half of Full Metal Jacket with the dark journey of Apocalypse Now.\n\n- I'm fascinated by how the iconic imagery and figures of the cowboy, America's distinct mythology, are used to shape the American socialist revolution in \"Ten Days That Shook the World.\" Waves of young men join the US Army following the death of Buffalo Bill in a German submarine attack, and Annie Oakley and Butch Cassidy are involved in the conflict. Makes me wonder what the Soviet equivalent was, if any.\n\n- I don't think any althist writer other than Newman, a popular and prolific film critic, would take a little time to explore this alternate timeline's cinema. In the USSA, Cecil B. DeMille directed this world's version of Sergei Eisenstein's Man with a Movie Camera. Meanwhile, Russia has its own version of Hollywood films and characters - Charlie Chaplin's Little Tramp (who appears as a character in \"Tom Joad\") is perfectly reimagined as \"The Little Anarchist.\"\n\n- You know this is the darkest timeline when Al Capone is president and Randall Flagg (Stephen King's recurring villain) is an influential religious leader. And who made Hannibal Lecter the head of the Department of Health?!"
