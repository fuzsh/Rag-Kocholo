        "text": "My latest local book, Unbuilt Bristol is to be published on May 18. Most families will probably be able to get by with just three copies (one for the coffee table, one for reading in bed, one for the guest room) but don’t let that put you off buying more if you need to.\n\nUnbuilt Bristol: The city that might have been 1750-2050 looks at around 50 of the buildings, monuments and other structures that have been proposed for Bristol at one time or another, but which were never actually built. While all your old favourites are there (all the other proposals for a bridge over the Avon Gorge, the insane 1960s/70s plan to fill in the Floating Harbour and cover it in roads etc.) there are plenty more which you won’t have heard of. Like the Victorian scheme to put Bristol’s main railway station in Queen Square, or a visionary 19th century plan to run the city’s street lighting using power generated by the rise and fall of the river Avon.\n\nSome things were easier to research than others. It’s very difficult, for instance, to keep track of several decades’ worth of failed plans to build new grounds for City and Rovers, as these schemes seem to change with every season. Or all the schemes for generating tidal power from the Severn; these are hard to follow as some of them are serious plans put forward by bodies which could, theoretically, find the money to do it. Others are more, ah, speculative. Talk of a dam across the Severn goes back to the 1840s, though the notion of using it to generate electricity only goes back to a piece of paper put in the staff suggestions box at the Great Western Railway’s Paddington offices in 1918.\n\nAnd as for the blasted trams… We’ve been talking seriously about trams now since the early 1980s, and we are still talking. Now it is true to say that there are all sorts of complicated topographical problems if you’re trying to put a tram system into Bristol. Not to mention all the complexities of the planning process itself, and trying to square the needs and wants of a very dense population. One of the most telling things that everyone needs to know about Bristol’s original tram system, which ran between the 1860s and 1940, was that the firm was run, from its early days by a man who was not an engineer or architect or builder. Sir George White was a lawyer. The first thing you need to put a tram system in place is not technology and it’s not even money; it’s a route and the permission and build it.\n\nThese problems aside, a person of a cynical frame of mind might also conclude that talking about a tram system suits some people better than actually building it. There are council officers in Bristol and the neighbouring authorities who have spent entire careers not building us a tram. And then there are all the lavishly-remunerated consultants…\n\nSo then, Unbuilt Bristol: The city that might have been 1750-2050 (to remind you of the title once more) has trams (or rather it doesn’t) and loads more besides. Anyone remember the 1990s plan to make a pyramid of bottles on top of the Create Centre? Or (for older readers) the amazing 1960s vision of streets in the sky? We were all going to be walking around on pedestrian decks and even a plaza suspended over the Centre while the traffic thundered by at ground level.\n\nAll this and more in (that title again) Unbuilt Bristol: The city that might have been 1750-2050, published by Redcliffe Press on May 18 at a very reasonable fifteen quid. More here."
