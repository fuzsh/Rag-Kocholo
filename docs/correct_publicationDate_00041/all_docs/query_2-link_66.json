A core principle of the research on which this book is based was to capture and include children’s voices. Children were invited to draw a picture of their school experience and subsequently describe the drawing to the researcher. The child described his drawing as depicting himself and his friend inside the classroom window looking out at the school yard. In this drawing, the child challenges the assumption that children with ASD prefer social isolation to engaging both with each other and their peers. Critically, the child communicates the responsibility for us as educators to create enabling and inclusive environments for all children.\n\nFigure 1: Middletown Centre for Autism and National Council for Special Education Evaluation Framework\n\nFigure 1.1: Teaching Strategies Selected by Teachers in the Irish Study\n\nFigure 1.2: Strategies to Support Language Understanding\n\nFigure 3.1: Ziggurat Model (adapted from Aspy and Grossman 2011)\n\nFigure 5.1: The Individual Education Plan Process\n\nFigure 7.1: Drawing by a Child in a Mainstream Primary School\n\nFigure 7.2: Drawing by a Child in a Special School\n\nFigure 7.3: Drawing by a Child in a Mainstream Primary Irish-Speaking School\n\nFigure 7.4: Drawing by a Child in a Post-Primary School\n\nFigure 7.5: Drawing by a Child in a Special School\n\nFigure 8.1: Key Elements in the Philosophy of Education at Reggio Emilia ← ix | x →\n\nFigure 9.1: The Interrelationships Between ASD and Intellectual Capacity\n\nFigure 9.2: Pictures by Primary-Age Children with ASD\n\nFigure 12.1: The ‘Self’ of Self-Evaluation\n\nFigure 12.2: ‘What’ Model of Reflection\n\nFigure 12.3: Gibb’s Reflective Cycle\n\nFigure 12.4: The School Self-Evaluation Six-Step Process\n\nTable 1: Summary of the Multiple-Case Study Research Approach and Data Sources\n\nTable 2: Research Sites\n\nTable 3: Exemplars of Children’s Drawings\n\nTable 4: Measurement and Weighting Criteria for Evaluation Data\n\nTable 1.1: Visual Supports\n\nTable 1.2: Six-Step Approach to Functional Behaviour Assessment (FBA)-based Intervention\n\nTable 1.3: The Six ‘Musts’ for Effective Teaching and Learning\n\nTable 3.1: Signposts for Accommodating Visual Differences in Early Years, Primary, Post-Primary and Special School Settings\n\nTable 3.2: Signposts for Accommodating Auditory Differences in Early Years, Primary, Post-Primary and Special School Settings\n\nTable 3.3: Signposts for Accommodating Olfactory Differences in Early Years, Primary, Post-Primary and Special School Settings\n\nTable 3.4: Signposts for Accommodating Gustatory Differences in Early Years, Primary, Post-Primary and Special School Settings\n\nTable 3.5: Signposts for Accommodating Tactile Differences in Early Years, Primary, Post-Primary and Special School Settings ← x | xi →\n\nTable 3.6: Signposts for Accommodating Vestibular Differences in Early Years, Primary, Post-Primary and Special School Settings\n\nTable 3.7: Signposts for Accommodating Proprioceptive Differences in Early Years, Primary, Post-Primary and Special School Settings\n\nTable 4.1: Snapshot of SNA Support in Schools for Children with ASD (NCSE 2015: 39)\n\nTable 6.1: Autism Standardized Assessment Considerations Checklist (ASACC)\n\nTable 8.1: Time-Sampling of Children’s On-Task Behaviour\n\nTable 8.2: Children’s Work included in Classroom Displays\n\nTable 9.1: Evaluating Positive Wellbeing for Children with ASD in Educational Settings\n\nTable 10.1: Profile of Inclusive Teachers (European Agency for Development in Special Needs Education 2012)\n\nTable 12.1: Sample SCOT Analysis as Teacher Self-Evaluation\n\nTable 12.2: Sample Analysis of IEP Targets as Evidence in the School Self-Evaluation Process\n\nTable 12.3: Sample Analysis of IEP Targets in Literacy as Evidence in the School Self-Evaluation Process\n\nTable 12.4: Sample ‘I Can’ Self-Assessment Grid\n\n| xiii →\n\nADAM HARRIS\n\nForeword\n\nSince I was a very young child, Ireland has been on a journey in terms of how it understands, supports and includes children with ‘special’ or ‘additional’ educational needs. We have moved, relatively quickly, from a model in which virtually no children who thought differently were educated in their local community to a point in which the vast majority are today. Indeed, this shift in policy and thought played out directly in my own life – as someone on the autism spectrum.\n\nWhen I was first diagnosed with Asperger’s Syndrome as a young child, my parents faced a stark choice. Should they send me to mainstream school, where they knew I would be able for the curriculum but would receive little or no support in accessing it and could well be labelled ‘the bold boy’ as a result? Or should they send me to a special school, where they knew I would receive lots of support but wouldn’t have the same academic opportunities or get to know my local peer group? On balance, my parents opted for the latter and I spent the first three years of my education in a special school setting. I really benefited from my time there but policy and thought began to shift too and so, shortly before my eighth birthday, I moved to a local mainstream school with a real commitment to inclusion but also supports to help me thrive such as a Special Needs Assistant (SNA) and access to resource teaching hours. This certainly changed the trajectory of my life, and the broader policy and thought underpinning educational journeys like mine has doubtless changed the lives of countless other people and, dare I say, the education system itself.\n\nWhereas once schools and teachers may rarely have heard words like ‘autism’ or ‘Asperger’s’, now you would be hard pushed to find a school or teacher anywhere in Ireland who does not have direct experience of teaching a member of the autism community. Whilst once autism might have sounded like an exotic or rare condition, it is now something that children ← xiii | xiv → and young people encounter as part of day to day life in their community. Indeed, the education system has become ‘autism aware’.\n\nHowever, there is a distinct difference between awareness and understanding. Awareness is about knowing something exists; understanding is about stepping into a person’s shoes and validating their perspective. Awareness is a vital first step in any journey towards inclusion; however, it is only the first step. I am aware that Mandarin Chinese is a language; however, I don’t understand it. As a result, I can’t meaningfully include a person who only speaks that language. In the same sense, we must ensure that all who work in our education system truly understand autism and the unique way in which autistic people communicate, understand and experience the world around us. ‘Mainstreaming’ has been something of a buzzword for some time – we have mainstreamed people, but we now must mainstream knowledge if we are to ensure inclusive education is not about legal access to buildings or educational institutions but rather about unlocking a person’s potential and respecting and celebrating diversity.\n\nThat is what excites me about Autism from the Inside Out: A Handbook for Parents, Early Childhood, Primary, Post-Primary and Special School Settings, edited by Professor Eugene Wall, Dr Patricia Daly and my friend Dr Emer Ring, with contributions from a broad range of academics from Mary Immaculate College. This book is an important tool in bridging the gap between awareness and understanding – providing all who support autistic students with accessible knowledge and practical methodologies, which can be employed both at home and in the classroom. This book builds on the proud history of Mary Immaculate College in relation to autism research and early childhood and teacher education, which has not only been extensive but has also recognized the unique needs of autistic students. Too often excellent research never converts to any real practical purpose from the point of view of families on the ground; this text harnesses a number of years of hard work into something we can all learn from. In the course of my own work as an autism advocate I have the opportunity to visit many schools and so often see excellent examples of inclusion that you would love to ‘bottle’ and bring to every school. This book, which is built on data from the research carried out by Mary Immaculate College staff as part of the National Council for Special Education’s Autism Policy ← xiv | xv → Advice, does just that, highlighting examples of good practice which can be employed in any early years setting or school.\n\nIt is important that this book takes a long view of autism, from the early years setting through to post-primary education. I am very often asked questions by parents and teachers which look for a ‘eureka’ moment for me. What helped me make friends? What allowed me to cope with the transition to mainstream school? How do I manage my sensory system? The answer is never one thing or one moment. It is always the culmination of work by a variety of key people in my life, at a number of key junctures, which, over time, has enabled me to learn and to overcome some key challenges. I socialize today because my parents pushed me to join extra-curricular activities from when I was around five years old, but also because I did transition year when I was sixteen years old. I managed the move to mainstream school because I had an excellent principal and SNA in the school I moved to, but also because the special school I was in worked to support my transition for many months prior to my move. In autism, there are no quick solutions, but you reap what you sow. The work of a teacher in second class may appear to change little, but it may be cashed in ten years later for all to see! For that reason, it is important that there is better joined up thinking between educators and the sectors that make up the system. It is welcome to see a publication which very much advocates team work in terms of supporting a child. I know that an important aspect of my educational journey was the positive relationship Mum and Dad had with my school and the active role my SNA played in the Individual Education Plan planning process. Too often, titles, egos and mutual unease can lead to disjointed and even dysfunctional approaches. This book not only advocates teamwork but backs up its benefits with evidence."
