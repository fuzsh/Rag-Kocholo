        "text": "Get Ready to Rock!\n\nWe are working on an exciting new project that will be a must read for the Bristol-based music lover and gig goer with the publication of The West’s Greatest Rock Shows 1963-1978.\n\nWritten by local reviewer and critic Robin Askew the book will be launched at a special event in Waterstones Galleries, Bristol, 7pm on Thursday 2nd May.\n\nThis anecdote-rich book whisks you through 15 eventful years of rock when the biggest names in the world performed at The Colston Hall, The Granary, the Corn Exchange, The Pavilion, Bath and the Pilton Pop Festival. Bristol Times editor Eugene Byrne, who has had a sneak preview of the publication says it is “A fabulous compilation album of teenage hysteria and rock n’ roll excess.”\n\nWe will be letting you know how you can get early copies soon.\n\nBristol’s bookshops recognised\n\nThree of the independent bookshops that stock titles from Bristol Books are regional finalists for the British Book Awards 2024 Independent Bookshop of the Year.\n\nBookhaus in Wapping Wharf; Gloucester Road Books on Gloucester Road, Bristol and Max Minerva’s in Henleaze and Portishead are in with a chance of getting the coveted “Nibbie” - the book industry equivalent of an Oscar!\n\nThey will hear in March who from the region will go through to the final, which will be a glittering occasion in May.\n\nIndependent bookshops are thriving with activities alongside book sales. We congratulate the bookshops on their achievement and encourage everyone to pop in, browse and meet fellow book lovers.\n\nTyntesfield shop stocks Bristol Books\n\nWe are delighted that the fabulous National Trust shop at Tyntesfield, near Bristol is now stocking a selection of Bristol Books.\n\nThe extravagant gothic revival house built for local merchant William Gibbs and its extensive grounds is a popular leisure destination for local people and visitors to the region. Its shop has a huge range of souvenirs and gifts and has now added some of our books to its shelves.\n\nRetail Manager Alice Offer said: “It’s so great to have local books in the shop.”\n\nIn fact, the books couldn’t be more local as Bristol Books offices in Wraxall border the Tyntesfield Estate!\n\nMatthew Sails into St Mary Redcliffe\n\nA whalebone brought back by John Cabot from his voyage on The Matthew to North America in 1497 can be seen in St Mary Redcliffe Church, along with a stained-glass window depicting Cabot and his sons. There is also a detailed model of the ship.\n\nSo, there is no more fitting venue for a talk about The Matthew of Bristol by author and Bristol Books director Clive Burlton.\n\nClive will be telling the story of the original ship and the creation of the modern Matthew, a faithful representation of the original vessel, which can be seen in Bristol’s Harbour every day, at an event in the church on Thursday April 11. You can book tickets here and our book The Mathew of Bristol will be on sale."
