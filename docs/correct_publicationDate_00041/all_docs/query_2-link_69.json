What sustains or inspires us, consoles or simply distracts us when our troubles might otherwise threaten to overwhelm? The past 18 months or so have made many of us question so much about our lives.\n\nSomehow, too, they have also shown us how to see again, have lead us both to tiny discoveries and monumental realisations, often almost right there on our doorsteps.\n\nFar from a pandemic anthology, LOCAL WONDERS is a gathering of mostly celebratory poems, written by poets from all over the island of Ireland, and farther afield, since early 2020 when the world was so utterly changed. It is an invitation to see and name and sing the praises of what is nourishing and of value to us now — not to turn away from the things that haunt and trouble us, but to see beyond into the better world that poetry makes visible."
