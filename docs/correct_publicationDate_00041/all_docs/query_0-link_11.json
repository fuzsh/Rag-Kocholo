        "text": "USA: Mark V Ziesing, 1997; HB.\n\nISBN-10: 0929480848\n\nISBN-13: 978-0929480848\n\nCo-written with Eugene Byrne.\n\nBuy it from Amazon.co.uk or Amazon.com.\n\n1989… One of the two superpowers which has dominated the 20th century is on the verge of being torn apart. The old communists regime which has held sway since the Revolution of 1917 is weak and divided. Dissident voices, silent for too long, have been raised against the corrupt and inefficient gangsterism of a morally and financially bankrupt ruling party. A new age of openness and reconstruction is dawning…\n\nThis is the United Socialist States of America.\n\nWhen Eugene Debs led the Revolution, few expected it to lead to the iron-fisted regime of Chairman Al “Scarface” Capone, a dictatorship that would last into the 1950s. But no tyranny, capitalist or communists, can stop real revolutionaries like Buddy Holy, Howard Hughes, Tom Joad, Eliot Ness, Kurt Vonnegut, andthe Blues Brothers.\n\nThis is the story of 20th century where America had a revolution… and Russia didn’t; where there were Tsars in the Kremlin and Commissars in the White House. Where America invaded Japan and Britain fought the war in Vietnam; where Isaac Asimov was a Russian TV astrologer and Ed Gein was a Hero of Labor.\n\nKim Newman and Eugene Byrne turn history on its head with this novel of “what if…?” — a must-read for Proletariats world-wide!\n\nTable of Contents:\n\n‘Abdication Street’\n\n‘Citizen Ed’\n\n‘In the Air’\n\n‘On the Road’\n\n‘Ten Days That Shook the World’\n\n‘Teddy Bears’ Picnic’\n\n‘Tom Joad’\n\nQuote:\n\n“I don’t know how much you know about America, Mr. Lowe, but a Labor Day weekend is some big deal. Every town has its parades, and speeches and hoe-downs. It was an even bigger deal under Chairman Capone. Everyone I knew bought it outright. Except Mom, of course. She was a real old dissenter. She was taking risks. She was First Aid officer at the tractor plant, and was too good at it to be got rid of.”"
