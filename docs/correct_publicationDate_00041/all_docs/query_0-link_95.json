I’m afraid that much of your fiction these days is not to my taste. I think the fault lies in me rather than the quality of your stories; my tastes these days run more towards charac- ter-led science fiction where people react to sociological changes, and possibly this is difficult to achieve in a short space. Also, although I know that biotechnology is the present cut- ting-edge science, my personal knowledge in this area is limited. Maybe I’m getting left behind. The perils of ageing. However, I shall keep subscribing, partly for the occasional gem, but also for your non-fiction. The book reviews are always useful (if only to show what to avoid) but I always enjoy the longer features on past sf masters. I especially enjoyed recent articles on Ballard and Blish, and the Neil Gaiman interview, but in issue 119 I’m afraid Elizabeth Counihan completely missed the target with the Gene Wolfe interview. Wolfe is one of, if not the best writ- ers working in sf and fantasy today, but he is notoriously a wily old bird when it comes to giving away infor- mation about his work. I think he completely out-smarted Elizabeth Counihan. The feature worked on the level of being an introduction for any- one who has never heard of Wolfe, but by the end, I was crying out for some specific information about his books. The most important feature of Gene Wolfe’s work is that so many of his novels, and especially his short fiction, take the form of puzzles to be solved by the reader. Many have very specific meanings hidden in the text, and for this reason I have read The Book of the New Sun more times than any other books that I own, finding fresh meanings and solutions each time. The down side of this is that reading Wolfe’s work can be like doing a crossword puzzle which never has the solution published. I think that Wolfe should follow up publication of each piece of work five years later with a set of text notes explaining the real meaning. That was meant tongue-in-cheek, but I would love to know if Wolfe ever did respond to John Clute’s ingenious suggestion that Severian’s mother was in fact the Autarch before a sex change or neutering operation. I would love to see a long interview with Wolfe done by John Clute, where he could really put him on the rack with probing specific questions. And, yes, I did know that Ameri- cans go out for breakfast a lot, and I’m sure Gene Wolfe has a nice house and likes Benny Hill. “Did you know we’re Catholics?” indeed. Nice snow job. Gene. Allan Lloyd Eardisley, Hereford Dear Editors: Interzone 119 continues a recent renaissance of the magazine: good issue after good issue, good story after good story within each issue. Not that there haven’t always been good stories and good issues, but we seem to be going through a particu- larly fertile patch. However, issue 119 has a fly in its ointment. Gwyneth Jones, reviewing Jack Deighton’s A Son of the Rock, says she is really sorry to be so cut- ting about a first-time novel from new British writer; I can’t help but wonder, then, why she bothered to review it. Still, she did, and now I feel I must defend it. First I must declare my interest: I come from the same town as Jack Deighton: I too am a “Son of the Rock.” This may make me more than usually sympathetic towards him, but it doesn’t completely cloud my critical faculties. The novel has weaknesses: it’s a rare first novel - a rare novel - that has none. I agree to some extent with Gwyneth’s comments on the technol- ogy, and the pace is perhaps a little slow to get going. But the reader’s patience is rewarded. The main char- acter, Alan, starts out as “irritating” and “self-satisfied,” as Gwyneth says; but he comes through his experi- ences, and develops by them, to the end where he faces the long twilight of his years with considerable dignity and strength. And in doing so he points a finger at the ephemera- and youth-worship of his - and of course, our - society. Alan’s development is the strongest element of the book, to my + Interaction + mind. “I felt guilty but I wasn’t both- ered enough to do anything about it” may not, as Gwyneth says, “consti- tute a howl of moral outrage,” but it does sound terrifyingly realistic to me. Isn’t that how we often react when we see the person with the col- lecting can in the station; or the Big Issue-seller outside the supermarket? Isn’t it how our whole society reacts when we see the horrors of Rwanda, or the latest human-rights abuse from the Indonesian government? Alan reacts to Sonny’s predicament as any of us might: he is too weak to stand up to his employers to try to prevent the destruction of Sonny’s home. In this he is being, among other things, a realist: he knows that he wouldn’t be able to stop the min- ing company an 5 rway. And yes, it takes the destruction of his own back yard to make him respond as he should have; but he absorbs his expe- rience and grows. Just like a real person. Perhaps worst of all, Gwyneth refers to the “few frigid lesbian bitches who turn him down.” In fact Alan is turned down by one woman who is a lesbian, and who he treats with respect and admiration; he certainly doesn’t think she’s “frigid.” It’s not a perfect novel; but I think it deserves a better chance than you gave it, Gwyneth. It would be a shame if Jack Deighton were to be so discouraged by this savage review that he didn’t try again. I think he will have great things in him. Martin McC allion martin. mccallion@ukonline. co. uk Dear Editors: Reading Neil Jones’s piece on “Trekoffery” {Interzone 120) I v/as slightly shocked at a comment made about the novelization of Star Trek: First Contact, namely that as the film will shortly be out on video why read the book? (I paraphrase slightly.) Such a comment seems to me out of place in a magazine that generally encourages reading. Some people, believe it or not, actually enjoy reading, even if it happens to be blatant commercial exploitation of a popular film. It might be noteworthy that much of this sort of spinoffery does well in the shops so presumably many peo- ple feel them to be worthwhile, although they are of course helped by what one of your readers entitled the “Pratchetting” of bookshelves (although I am not sure that Terry Pratchett really deserves the accusa- tion just because he happens to be prolific and popular). 4 mterzone I freely admit that I enjoy the occa- sional spinoff (should we call Star Wars spinoffs “Lucasoffery”?). This may be because I have grown up with them and maybe because they can be very entertaining even if not often very challenging. As has been said, it is lamentable that distributors tend to favour film and TV spinoffery so much and that shops do tend to “Force” or to “Trek” shelves (prefer- able, I think, to the term “Pratchet- ting”), to the neglect of more serious novels, sf or otherwise, but spinoffery will always have its place in the profit-seeking book market and I’m sure that many Trek fans will find plenty of reasons to buy First Contact despite the advent of the video. Malcolm Rowe lfurowe@reading. ac. uk Dear Editors: Here are some of my grumbles. 1. Why is it that science fiction is a relative unknown in the field of fic- tion? When I first decided to try sf I entered the reading market with one of these preconceptions that have plagued sf for years, in that I thought sf fans were anorak-wearing geeks who had no social life and could speak the Klingon language (yes, there is such a thing: this writer has seen it on the Internet). So I went along to my local bookshop and found that the sf shelf was groaning with those sword-and-sorcery books. I asked the bookstore assistant if she could recommend any decent sf and she just stared at me as if I had spo- ken to her in Klingon. Similar efforts to find help at the town library had me frustrated. Finally I went to W. H. Smith, and thankfully I found a guide to science fiction and a copy of SF 4, a collection of short stories edited by Gardner Dozois. The collection opened me up to some of the best lit- erature I had read that year, and the guide helped explain to me some of the sf sub-genres such as slipstream, cyberpunk and alternative history - and it also recommended sf books and magazines. So then I tried looking for the magazines that the guide recom- mended and again my efforts were snubbed. What the hell is going on? If I hadn’t been so determined to read science fiction then I probably would have given up. It saddens me to think that other people in my position who would have been avid sf fans like myself were turned away because of the limited market. I think it is high time that those people who are moan- ing that sf is in decline, as Gardner Dozois did in SF 4, should get off their backsides and start promoting sf to a wider audience instead of let- ting them think sf is all about The X- Files and Babylon 5. 2. I agree wholeheartedly with David Burrows’s letter in the May Interzone - he was upset at the treat- ment of Philip Pullman’s book North- ern Lights by retailers and the pub- lic. Pullman has created an evocative and vividly drawn alternative uni- verse, with beautiful and elegant prose. This is the first volume of his “Dark Materials” trilogy and it has won two children’s book awards. The second volume promises to be set entirely in our universe and could gain a few adult awards. We use the term “classic” so much that it has lost its meaning nowadays. However, I am confident in saying that this trilogy will eventually attain that fabled status, “a Klasik of Litrechar.” So don’t be embarrassed by rooting through the Young Adults section of a library looking for it. 3. 1 think the time is right for the Star Trek series on television to be axed before its welcome is outworn. I admit to being a keen Trek fan (although not going as far as learn- ing the Klingon language), but ever since the demise of Star Trek: The Next Generation the series has fallen both in ratings and in quality. The latest offering, after the abysmal Deep Space Nine^ has been Star Trek: Voyager, which has produced some of the most pitiful scripts ever aired on television (a particular episode comes to mind in which the Voyager was out of coffee and the Captain was upset; could you ever imagine Kirk or Picard worrying about coffee?). Gene Rodenberry would be devastated if he could see the depths to which his brilliant idea has plummeted. How- ever, the one glimmer of hope is the film series, which looks like it may have another batch of adventures in the offing for Picard and his crew after Generations and First Contact. I know that my comments will be con- sidered as traitorous by many Trekkies, but I also know there are some of you out there who share my opinions on this issue. Faisal Ahmad Huddersfield, W. Yorkshire Editor: In reply to your first point, what more do you expect people like Gardner Dozois to do to promote sci- ence fiction'^ In Dozois's case, he edits the best American sf magazine, Asi- mov’s, and also produces the annual yeaFs-best volume you refer to; addi- tionally, he edits or co-edits many other paperback sf anthologies for Ace Books (see our “Books Received” in this issue for an example). Collec- tively, his editorial efforts must have reached many thousands of new read- ers over the years. But to make sf more of a respected genre in the world at large I suppose what we need are more reputable “outsiders” who have a liking for sfto stand up and praise it in public - more Doris Lessings and Fay Weldons, who have done this sort of thing on occasions. Or, at any rate, their younger equivalents. But it’s an uphill struggle at present. when almost every “teenage” newspa- per scribbler and half-baked sub-edi- tor seems unable to see past the anorak joke. Dear Editors: As a subscriber since /Z 92, 1 have finally summoned the “bottle” to ask a couple of questions. However, to avoid embarrassing myself, first let me state my sf credentials - Asimov, Bova, Clarke, Delany, Ian M. Banks and Patrick Tilley are “my thing.” Orson Scott Card’s Ender’s Game and its sequels, and Dan Simmons’s Hype- rion and its sequels, are among my top- 10 reads. Now, having got that out of the way, from IZ 92 to IZ 119, two questions about the magazine have remained foremost in my mind: 1) “Ansible Link” - I suspect it’s humorous. If, however, I manage to understand 50% per issue, then I think I’m doing well. At the risk of appearing foolish, am I the only reader who doesn’t know/has never heard of/is totally clueless about most of what is written by David Langford? 2) “Mutant Popcorn” - does Nick Lowe assume... (a) The reader hasn’t seen the film, so this is a review for the reader’s benefit; (b) The reader has already seen the film, so this is a retrospective examination/dissection; (c) The reader simply wants to be entertained by Lowe’s incisive wit? Those are my two questions, but while I’m at the keyboard can I take the opportunity to add my tuppence- worth to the ST: TNG & ST: DSD v. B-5 debate. I believe B-5 has the clear edge over the children of ST, not because of its story-arc, but because it has interesting/intriguing baddies and we (the humans) aren’t all wonderful people (note ST: Voy- ager doesn’t even warrant a men- tion). Finally, I like Interzone. I like the stories, interviews and book reviews. I’m not complaining, just seeking enlightenment. Robert Lettman London Editor: Langford’s “Ansible Link” is the most consistently popular non-fic- tion item We publish (or at any rate so we are told by those who vote in each year’s readers’ poll). Like all gossip columns it may take some getting into, however. My advice is just to relax and enjoy those bits that you can; with luck, more and more of it will become clear to you in time. As for Nick Lowe’s film reviews, far be it from me to guess what Nick’s private assumptions are; but as editor - and being conscious of the fact that our reviews often appear too late to be “news” (I recommend you go to the film mags for that) - my own opinion is that your guesses (b) and (c) are the valid ones. Ausust 1 997 5 PART ONE B ob splashed tap-water into his eyes, and tried to blink away the throbbing in his head. He wasn’t supposed to be hung over till tomorrow, but everyone and his uncle was buying him drinks. In the Ladies’ Lounge, he’d gone easy, knocking back only the sweet sherry his Mam and Thelma drank. He wished now he’d stuck to the Back Bar and brown ale. Then again, Terry had just put a couple of gallons through his kidneys, on top of a fish-and-chip buttie tea, and he was in a worse state than Bob. Terry was in one of the stalls, hands jellyfish on the fioor, chinning the porcelain rim as he spewed. Bob went over and hooked his hands into Terry’s armpits, lifting him up and aiming his mouth at the toi- let bowl. He felt the racking of reverse peristalsis - a term remembered from school - run through Terry’s ribs. The last of the chips and Mother’s Pride came up as beery sludge. ‘‘She let you tup her last night,” Terry said. “Tight- drawers Thelma.” That was true. “She thought you were going to die in foreign parts, so she dropped ’em for you.” That was arguable. Yet more came up out of the bottom of Terry’s stom- ach. It must be the last of it. “She’ll never understand, that one.” Bob hauled Terry upright and wiped his face with a rough paper towel, getting off the worst of the sick. “You smell like a tramp’s dustbin.” Terry touched a fist to his chest and lightly thumped Bob over the heart. “She’ll never get in here. Bob. Not bloody Thelma.” “I should hope not. It’s the Gents.” “Ahh get on with you, you know what I mean.” Bob did. “Come on. Bob. Back to the battlefront . . . King, coun- try and Strongarm Ruby Red Bitter are calling.” Terry lurched out of the toilets. Bob followed, as he had been following his mate since St Godric’s primary school. 6 interxone Thelma had been furious when he volimteered. She’d screamed at him that he didn’t have to go in the Army - he could have had a medical exemption from National Service for his flat feet - and that now he’d passed his City & Guilds he should make a career for himself, but oh no, he had to sign up just because his best pal Terry had. . . The smell of piss was worse in the corridor outside the Gents. There was a sound, as if someone had left a tap running. Bob ran into Terry’s back. By the stairs stood a fat bloke in a dark suit. It took a moment to realize he was piddling against the wall. ‘T don’t much like flock wallpaper either,” said Terry, “but this is taking it a bit far.” The man turned and zipped the fly on immense trousers. “It’s me own fookin’ club, y’daft get,” he snorted in broad Mancunian. “I can take a burst where I fookin’ like.” Bob recognized the fat man. The Comedian was chairman and secretary of the club. He was in with Jack Carter, and in this part of town. Jack Carter ran everything. The Comedian looked at them. “I know you lads. It’s your party tonight, in’t it? Do or die, king and country?” Somehow, Bob didn’t want to admit it. But Terry took an unsteady bow. “Daft bastards,” the Comedian said, not without admiration. He pulled out a wad of notes. With pee- smelling Angers, he peeled off four blue Avers and shoved them into Bob’s hankie pocket. ‘\"Buy yourself some slant-eyed scrubber in Saigon, lads.” Terry tried to thank him but spasmed again, bend- ing double to drool thin bile on the already-stained car- pet. Bob held him up. “That’s a fookin’ pretty picture.” The Comedian’s enormous mouth opened in a bark of laughter that shook all his mounds of fat. Terry coughed again, hawking stomach lining. “Fare thee well, lads,” said the Comedian. “And when you get to the Bloody ’Chine, kill some fookin’ treens for the Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club. Bring us back a necklace of ears we can hang on the darts trophy.” He put his hand round the full glass and left it there. He told Bet Lynch to have one herself Ausust 1 997 7 Illustrations by Gerry Grace Teddy Bears' Picnic “Don’t mind if I do, Bob,” said the barmaid, looking him up and down. He’d lost a lot of weight. “A vodka- tonic. That’ll be four and ninepence please.” 1965 seemed a long time ago. Prices had doubled in two years. Everything in Indo or the NAAFI was dirt cheap. It was as well he had a wedge of back-pay from the months when he couldn’t spend it. Bet gave him change, peering at him from under vast false eyelashes like hideous jungle insects. He could hear her thinking “poor love, the things you’ve been through. . .” At quarter to two on a wet Sunday in February, the Club was almost empty. The few customers were old lads, men with no missus at home to do them Sunday dinner. They looked up from the News of the World and eyed him. Word of his adventures had obviously come home ahead of him. He’d sent a telegram saying he’d be back Monday, but had made it a day earlier. The taxi had dropped him off at the house an hour ago, but there was no one in and he didn’t have a key. Mam and Dad must have gone to Auntie Glad’s in Hartlepool. He went over to Thelma’s and found she’d gone on the bus to visit a schoolfriend in Thornley. Walking by Terry’s parents’ house, he noticed a boarded-over window. There was a red paint- splash like blood on the front door. He looked at the beer. Foam ran down the sides of the glass. He strained to hear the fizz. Hundreds of tiny bubbles burst. A pint of Whitbread Trophy Bitter! The pint that thinks it’s a quart! He’d liked the IPA in the NAAFI and Tiger Beer in Saigon, but Trophy was the taste of home, the taste of before. Maybe because he was a sort of hero or someone fur- ther up the chain of contempt thought he was cute, or maybe it was just procedure, but they’d decided to Blighty him fast. After a few days’ checkup at a base hospital at Cam Ranh Bay, he was on the gozome bird. The RAF had a few ancient, hideously noisy, Sun- derland fiying boats to shuttle quacks and Blighty Ones from Cam Ranh Bay to whatever troopship was near- est home. In a few days T for Tommy fiew him from Indo to Rangoon, Calcutta, Karachi and Aden. He was dropped off at Port Said to join the SS Uganda. Nobody from his unit was on board, but some of the blokes had heard about him. Before they passed Malta he’d been awarded honorary extra stripes and invited to join the Sergeants’ messdeck. The door opened with a blast of damp air, chilling him to the bone. An old man with a toothbrush mous- tache, fiat cap and stained overcoat ambled in, shout- ing to Bet that he’d have “just the usual ’alf” Further down, a man and a woman had an animated argument about whether someone’s car was blue or green. On the boat, a Welsh Sergeant-Major called Williams took a sort of shine to him. Old as the hills, he’d even been out in Burma during the Real War. Now, he was coming home from his third tour in Indo. ‘Tou get ’ome, it’s a lot smaller than it used to be,” he’d said. “Not just the size of the ’ouses. Things people are worried about are smaller, too. You’ll be d 3 dng for a pint of the local brew. I bet you’ve been dreaming about this foaming glass of Newcastle Brown or whatever muck it is you drink up there. For two years you’ve imagined that dirty great ’andful of beer you’ll down in one the minute you get off the train. Queer stuff, beer. Wherever you go. the first pint’s no bloody good. Especially at ’ome. The last pint you ’ave is always the best one.” The top of the pint had almost gone fiat. Only a thin line of white foam ringed the brown liquid’s surface. He patted the pockets of his battledress trying to find a cigarette. One thing about the Army was they gave you plenty of pockets. Not like the tight bell-bottoms the younger blokes were wearing these days. The fashion came from Russia, like most daft things. He found a battered pack of Guards in the Penguin Pocket on his trousers. He took it out, along with the paperback Williams had given him. The Edge of the Sword by Anthony Farrar-Hockley. The author had been captured in Korea and been tortured. Farrar-Hockley had guts, but his book was very stiff-upper-lip, officerly and British and matter of fact. If Bob wrote up his story, he wouldn’t be nearly so polite. They had docked at Avonmouth late last night. Troopships never landed at Southampton, Pompey, Lon- don or even Liverpool any more because it was “bad for morale.” Indo hands returned furtively to a dock miles from an 3 rwhere, preferably in the middle of the night. It was not a heroes’ welcome: no Lord Mayors, no mil- itary bands. They were greeted by glaring yellow sodium lamps, cranes, a knot of dock-workers huddling in grimy, glistening oilskins, a few MPs glowering from under the peaks of their red caps and a couple of dozen Queen Alexandra nurses in khaki cloaks. . . No anthems or h 3 mms were sung, there was only the hiss of the rain on concrete, the clanking of chains, the occasional shout. There were no cigars, only the smell of bunker- oil and damp clothes, and the diesel fumes from the Deltic loco hauling the hospital train waiting on the quay for Uganda's less fortunate passengers. The tab burned his throat, reminding him he’d not had an 3 dhing to drink since a mug of tea at the WRVS caravan on the docks. Sod it, he thought. He lifted the glass and necked the lot in one go. “Worth waiting for, was it?” asked Bet. “To be perfectly honest, no. It tastes of nowt much, doesn’t have enough alcohol in, and is full of gas.” He theatrically placed the empty glass by the pump- handle in front of her. “But it is nonetheless what we drink round here, and here is home. So I’ll have another pint please. Bet, love.” Off the boat, Williams saw to it that Bob was marched through demob on the double. Everyone was frightened of Sergeant-Majors, especially officers. He’d sorted Bob’s pay and made sure he didn’t have to bother with the nonsense of giving up his uniform and kitbag and signing for every little bloody thing. He even wan- gled first-class express rail warrants. They travelled together as far as Bristol Temple Meads, then Williams had to get off to change for Swansea. He was going to spend a few weeks with his sister, then he’d be back in the Army again. “Listen to me, lovely boy,” he’d said. “Going ’ome is hard work, but you got to stick it out, see.” The next pint was a little better. “What are you going to do. Bob?” asked Bet. “Reckon I’ll hang around ’til you close, then find a caff that’s open and read the Sunday papers ’til me Mam and Dad get back home.” She looked at him, knowing he was kidding her. 8 interxone ‘‘ni go back to accountancy I suppose,” he admitted. '1 can count with both sets of fingers and me toes, you know.” Aye, so ifs just as well you didn't get any of them shot off isn't it? Sorry to butt in like this, man, but I had to introduce meself sooner or later. Me name's Survivor- Guilt. You and me, we're about to get to know one another right canny well, young Robert. ‘Tou are a card Bob,” said Bet. '‘And after everything you’ve been through and all.” Obviously there were stories going around town: how he’d suffered, how heroic he’d been. Maybe he should write a book so everyone would know the truth. He was lucky. He’d come back in one piece. The firm had even taken the trouble to find his BFPO address and write him that his old job was waiting. He was all right. Bet- ter than most. Awright, Bob, whatever you say, marra. 'And what about Terry, eh?” Bet said. \"Who’d have thought he’d be that big a bastard? Pardon my French. If he come in here, the only pint he’d get’d be fiung in his bloody rotten face.” \"Do I look like a fanny?” yelled Sergeant Grimshaw, face up close against Terry’s. \"I repeat, do I look like a fanny?” \"No, sergeant,” Terry said, wide-eyed. \"Then why are you trying to fuck me? You ’orrible Northern bollockbrain scum-filth snot-gobbling shit- faced granny-shagger.” Bob, backbone rigid, swivelled his eyes. Terry seemed to be blasted by the sergeant’s breath. \"And what are you looking at, tart?” Grimshaw loomed up against Bob, eyes huge. \"Are you his girlfriend? Are you two nancy-boys homos of the botty-banging Jessie persuasion? I’ll have no unauthorized buggery in my barracks.” There were 30 or so young men on the parade ground, still in civvies, suitcases beside them. They were almost all National Servicemen, barely willing to heed the call of their country. Someone sniggered. A weight was lifted from Bob and Terry, as the sergeant wheeled off to shout at someone else. \"Let me make myself perfectly clear, ladies. These two poove puddings may be lower than the shreds of toe- cheese I scrape out of my socks, but you are all equally worthless in my eyes. You are all, I repeat all, less than nothing. You are merely the fanny-discharge of your mis- erable whores of mothers. After nine weeks, you may, and I underline may, be elevated from the mud to the position of Private Soldier in the service of His Majesty, the King. You, do you love His Majesty, the King?” The sergeant addressed a London lad called Butler, whose permanent grin could not be wiped away. Bob and Terry had met him at the station, on route to Basic Training Depot No. 9, which was near Walmington-on- Sea, a small town on the south coast. \"Yes, sergeant, I love His Majesty the King.” \"If His Majesty the King needed to wipe his bottom after a royal shit, would you rip the tongue out of your head and humbly offer it to him as toilet paper? If His Majesty the King needed a holder for his candle-stick would you bend double from the waist and open your arsehole? If His Majesty the King required you to gob Kim Newman and Eugene Byrne in your father’s face, tit-fuck your mother and run a lawn mower over your virgin sister, would you reply 'at once Your Majesty, anything you say Your Majesty’?” \"Is that a rhetorical question, sergeant?” The sergeant’s hand latched onto Butler’s crotch like a vice. Butler’s eyes went red. \"Sing soprano, you spunk-eating splash of spew. Sing 'The Happy Wanderer’.” Butler screeched, tears pouring down his cheeks. Grimshaw literally squeezed the tune out of him, wringing his balls as if they were a musical instrument. \"I love to go a-wandering. . .” Butler yelped, stumbling through the song, \". . . with my knapsack on my back. . . fol-de-ree, fol-de-rah, fol-de-rah-hah-hah-hah-aaarrgh!” Grimshaw gripped, white-knuckled, protracting the final note. \"Above us all is Lord God Almighty, who takes no interest in our affairs. Directly below God is His Majesty the King. Loyal to His Majesty the King are His Majesty’s Armed Forces. His Majesty’s Armed Forces have bestowed upon me absolute power of life and death over you, Butler. When I speak, it is not merely myself. Sergeant Grimshaw, speaking, but it is the voice of God, transmitted through His Majesty the King and down through every honoured echelon of His Majesty’s Armed Services direct to your pustulant ear- holes. Can you hear me, Butler?” The Londoner nodded through agony. Grimshaw eased his grip, then kissed him full on the lips. \"I love you, Butler. You are the best, the only, man in this whole squad. You are promoted to honorary Cor- poral for the duration of your basic. In my eyes, you are still the drippings from a S 3 q)hilitic rat’s knob-end. But, in comparison with them, you are a demi-god. You walk with giants, and you carry a Bren gun.” The sergeant stood back to survey the recruits, who stood like trees next to their suitcases and duffel bags. Bob realized the man had managed in five minutes to make a cohesive unit of young men who were mostly still strangers to each other. They were united in their utter hatred of Sergeant Grimshaw. \"In a moment, you will all get a cheap thrill,” Grimshaw shouted. \"Corporal Butler here will order you to strip naked. The last man out of his kit will be clean- ing the bogs with his toothbrush for the next month. Then, you will be examined for hideous diseases and dis- gusting parasites, be given a proper haircut with scis- sors the size of sheep-shears, and be issued with uniforms, boots and other essential kit. You will be required to take care of these with your worthless lives. Remember, these are not presents. These are lent to you for the duration of your service. Each and every bootlace and jockstrap is the personal property of His Majesty the King. If an item is damaged or lost, the rules of war require me to inflict merciless and disproportionate pun- ishment. Butler, give the order to disrobe, now.” \"Men,” Butler squeak-shouted, then dropping his voice an octave, \"at the double, kit off!” Bob unlaced his shoes first, and began neatly to get out of his civvies, folding and piling every garment as his Mam had taught him. Some of the others were stark naked before he had his shirt and trousers off Buttons pattered on the asphalt. Terry was ripping Ausust 1 997 9 Teddy Bears' Picnic off his clothes as if invited in for late night coffee with Sabrina. It began softly to rain. Grimshaw wove in and out of struggling lines. It was not easy to undress standing-up. Men hopped from foot to foot as they fought with socks and shoes. Bob knew he would be last. He tried to hurry, but he could not break the habit of neatness. At last, he folded his underpants and put them on the pile. He supposed he would have to learn how to clean toilets. Grimshaw walked past and looked down, first at his shrivelled genitals, then at his perfectly-folded square of clothes. ‘‘Very neat, Nancy.” Bob was astonished and relieved. There were other men still trying to undress. Finally, there was only Frank Spencer, the squeaky- voiced semi-imbecile who had been at the station with Butler. He had started undressing with his cap and worked down, and got his trousers stuck on his shoes. Spencer fell over, sobbing silently. “Butler, over here,” Grimshaw shouted. “Piss in this man’s eyes.” Bob saw Butler pause, realize how precarious his position was, and trot over to his friend. He pointed his knob, but couldn’t get a flow going. The rain was pissing down for him. Finally, he man- aged a pathetic dribble. He missed Spencer’s face. Bob would have liked to think that was deliberate. Spencer was crying out loud, scrabbling round like a crab, ripping his trousers apart at the seams in a last, desperate attempt to get them off. “Rest of you, line up,” Grimshaw shouted. The rain was stinging cold, with a January wind pelt- ing it against bare skins. Bob felt needles of ice against his back and buttocks. Like everyone, he was shaking, dripping rain droplets with every shiver. “Best bath you’ve ’ad in years, you dirty beggars.” They huddled in a line, hugging themselves. Their clothes were forgotten, soaked through by the rain. “Nobody gets a towel or a uniform until Spencer has well and truly been pissed on. And I mean by every man here.” Dread closed on Bob’s heart. He had never been able to use a public urinal. He would point and feel pressure in his bladder, but it just didn’t happen. He always waited for a sit-down to be free and pissed in private. And now he didn’t even need to take a slash. Grimshaw, this elemental force of malign nature, would skip to Bob as quixotically as he had from Terry to Butler to Spencer. When he failed to produce the thinnest squirt of piss. Bob would be on the ground where Spencer was. The sergeant would probably order the rest to shit on him. This was a nightmare that would never end. Noth- ing could be worse than this. And it was only his first day in the Army. “Sod this for a game of soldiers,” Terry said through chattering teeth. William Casper, who claimed to be 18 but looked four years younger, was in line after Butler. He was the only other “volunteer” in the squad. He hardly had hair on his pubes. And he couldn’t manage a piddle. Bob thanked His Majesty the King and God. The wrath of Grim would not descend next on him. “Pathetic, the lot of you.” The Sergeant picked up Spencer, who was now at last free of all clothes but his socks and shoes. “You all right, lad?” he asked, tenderly, smiling. “Could do with a cuppa rosie lee. I’ll bet.” Spencer cried out and nodded. ‘You’d love to be inside, warm. Wrapped up. Jam bun. Bourbon biscuits. Sing Something Simple on the wireless.” Spencer looked wistful, cracked an idiotic longing smile, and sagged, almost leaning on the sergeant, a cat cuddling up to a loving owner. “Well, you can forget that. Private Piss-Stain Spencer!” Grimshaw yelled, raping the moment to bleeding bits. “You’ve not earned a uniform yet. None of you human-shaped lumps of shit have. Fall in for- mation, and start running.” Naked and delirious. Bob collided with Terry as they tried to stand in an orderly group. Grimshaw took his swagger-stick to shins, then started whipping buttocks. The Sergeant jogged, and Bob tried to run along after him. His feet bled on the rough asphalt, and his ankles jarred with every step. The rain was bucketing down on them. After half an hour, Grimshaw called enough and directed them to the baths where, he delighted in telling them, they could get the filth off their feet with a nice cold shower. Bob thought it was a wonder no one had died. He and Terry leaned against each other and limped, moaning, towards the bath-house. Inside, immaculately uniformed, plumply pink and comfortable, was an officer. He took a look at the stum- bling men, who must have seemed like survivors of some war atrocity, and his look of composure vanished. He pantomimed appalled sympathy and wheeled on Grimshaw, red-faced. “It looks as though these men have been tortured,” he shouted. “That is correct, sah!” All anger vanished and the officer smiled indulgently. “Well done,” he said. “Carry on, sergeant.” Grimshaw looked at the men and shouted “into the showers, girls. And be sure to scrub behind your ears.” Bob read it over again. Some will tell you the greatest hero the British Armed Forces have ever produced was Admiral Nelson, some will put up Monty, some General Gordon, But to any National Serviceman who went through Basic Training Depot No. 9, the only real hero is Private Arthur Seaton. They didn't give Seaton the Victoria Cross. In fact, they hanged him and buried him in an unmarked grave. If I knew where it was, Fd smother the plot in wreaths, and so would a hundred others. Seaton, you see, was the sol- dier who killed Sergeant Grimshaw. Grim would have been proud of him. One shot, straight to the head, just the way he liked it. Sometimes, when I wake up think- ing Fm back in Walmington-on-Sea or Khe Sanh, I sob at the injustice. Seaton wasn't in our mob. He came along months after we'd shipped out. There's not a man who trained at Walmington who wouldn't swap tickets for the Cup Final for the chance to see Sergeant Grimshaw's brains shot out. It's a tragedy it wasn't cap- tured on film. I hope they buried Grim at a crossroads 10 mterxone with a bayonet through his heart and a tin of bully beef rammed up his arse. He handed the page to Thelma. Frown-lines crinkled her forehead, and she was unable not to look as if she smelled something bad. ''What do you think?” Thelma struggled to find words. \"It’s a bit... hard. Really nasty.” \"I can’t write a soft book, love. Not about the Army, not about the war.” \"It’s so bitter. Bob. This poor man Grimshaw was just trying to... well, to toughen you up, make men of you. You can’t still hate him.” \"Thelma, Frank Spencer had eleven thumbs. He was a walking disaster. He couldn’t cross the road without causing an accident. He couldn’t boil a kettle without burning the water. When he got through his basic, Grimshaw wrote up a report on him and got him assigned to the REME, recommended him for bomb-dis- posal. How long do you think he lasted? There are bits of him they still haven’t found.” \"Have you noticed,” Terry said, \"how Grim fixes every- thing according to the weather? We get PT or boasting or cross-country runs or assault-courses only if it’s cold and wet.” \"Right,” Bob agreed. \"If the weather outside is halfway decent, we’re indoors, learning how to use Blanco and Brasso, or how to clean a rifie, or how to break someone’s neck with our bare hands.” \"’olds and rolls and throws and breakfalls,” Butler snapped, getting the sergeant’s voice perfectly. \"I’d like to try some ’olds on Grimmy.” \"He’s not such a bad bloke underneath,” Casper put in. Everyone looked at him as if he’d just admitted he fancied Hitler. Casper was a strange one. The grand obsession of his life was bird-watching. Birds of prey. \"He’s a bleedin’ monster, birdy-boy,” Butler said. \"I tell you, when I’m out of this, back behind the wheel of a bus where the Lord intended I should be. I’ll be dream- ing of the day Grim steps out on that zebra crossing in front of my double-decker. Bump! Oh! Have I killed you. Grim? Bloody shame! Never mind, eh?” \"But he likes you. Corporal Cockney Get,” said Terry. \"Sing 'The Happy Sodding Wanderer’, Geordie Shite.” \"Fol-de-reeeee, fol-de-raaaarrgh-my-bollocks!” sang Terry. Butler smiled. Bob couldn’t get used to the way But- ler and Terry tossed unforgivable insults at each other, yet had become friends for life within days. Bob wondered if he wasn’t getting a bit jealous. He was starting to feel Butler getting in the way of Bob and Terry, just as Terry always resented Thelma. \"Cheer up,” Bob said. \"It’s a half-holiday tomorrow.” After two months, they were finally getting leave to visit the town for Saturday night. Apparently, there wasn’t much to do besides visit the pier that almost got blown up in the Real War and hang around Walker’s Palais de Danse. Walker’s was where the local girls would be. Butler had been talking about it all week. South Coast Girls were legendary in London. Butler was full of stories about knickers lost under the pier. Bob wondered if he’d be better for Thelma if he were Kim Newman and Eugene Byrne Ausust 1 997 11 Teddy Bears’ Picnic more experienced. He could imagine what she’d think, especially if he caught something. Still, he’d be away for two years. “You’ll never get any birds again, Butler,” said Terry. “Not after they’ve had some proper Northern cock. Me and Bob’ll run through ’em like a dose of salts.” “I jus’ want to see somewhere that’s not this bloody cage,” said Casper. There were moans of assent from up and down the hut. “Snap inspection,” someone shouted. Grimshaw burst in like the Federal Bureau of Inqui- sition, flanked by hard-faced corporals, pace-stick under his arm. Everyone stood to attention by their lockers. Grim- shaw started examining gear, passing brusque com- ments on the state of socks and conflscating copies of Health and Efficiency and Tit-Bits. Two lockers down from Bob was Frank Spencer, a ticking bomb. His mother, one of those smothering, pro- tective sorts, was always sending him parcels of things like vests, hot-water bottles, and tracts on the evils of drink. She also sent tins of corned beef. He told them he’d always liked it, and that his Mum must have assumed they didn’t have it in the Army. Grimshaw opened Spencer’s locker, and two tins of Fray Bentos fell out. “What’s this, cuntface?” “Two tins of c-corned beef, sergeant. From my mother.” “His Majesty’s rations not good enough for you, spas- tic? These foreign objects are an insult to the crown. You are aware of the regulation that says you can only eat Army bully beef?” “My Mum...” “I’m not interested in the pox-rotted slag who birthed you between Saturday night shag sessions with Sheffield Wednesday’s second team.” Irrepressible anger sparked in Spencer’s eyes. “Don’t you pick on my Mum,” he squeaked. In the silence, Bob’s spirit shrank. Spencer, the cring- ing reed, had snapped and talked back. Grimshaw would show no mercy. “So you’re missing your Mum’s cooking? Have to do something about that, won’t we? How’d you like a 48-hour pass so’s you can visit your Mum for a slap-up feed?” Spencer was as surprised as anyone but still mis- trustful. This must be a prelude to a punishment so ghastly it would go in the record books. Bob prayed Spencer would turn down the offer. “Nice,” Spencer said. Bob knew the abyss had just opened up. “Very well, Spencer, your wish shall be granted. Fairy Godmother Grimshaw will see to it that you spend this weekend in the bosom of your family. However, to com- pensate, all other leave is withdrawn.” Twenty-nine hearts turned to stone. Even Butler’s smile vanished. “While you, Spencer, are eating home cooking, we shall endeavour to change the situation here, so the grub comes up to your high standard of cuisine. The rest of you slags will spend the weekend peeling spuds.” Spencer could still get out of it, and turn down the leave, but he was too addle-headed to see ahead more than a few minutes. Bob knew even Frank Spencer would hardly enjoy his time at home, knowing what was waiting when he got back. They spent Saturday in a freezing shed next to the cookhouse peeling an Everest of potatoes. Grimshaw insisted each be peeled like an apple, in a single stroke that produced a perfect spiral of peel and a completely skinless potato. Bob’s Angers were cut ragged. They were so chilled and shrivelled that he couldn’t feel them, but he knew agony would set in over the next few days. Throughout it all, they talked about Frank Spencer. Terry kept up a bitter running commentary, about the warm tea and hot food he was eating. “That Betty of his’ll be giving him one right now,” he said. “I bet she has to put the rubber johnny on for him, or he’d get it over his head.” There were grumbles. Just now, much as Bob hated Grim, he hated Frank Spencer worse. “How about a song to cheer us up?” Casper sug- gested, feebly. “‘Boiled Beef and Carrots’?” He was pelted with potatoes. Finally, it was done. To one side was a heap of peel- ings as high as a man’s waist. To the other tubs of naked potatoes, streaked with blood. They sat in the hut, too exhausted to move. Grimshaw arrived, fresh from the mess, and exam- ined the work. “A job well done, men.” He picked up a potato and tossed it into the air, catching it again like a cricket-ball. Then, he picked up a peeling and delicately wrapped it around the potato. It didn’t quite fit. “While you’ve been working, I’ve given some thought to the matter of your diet. Choosy types like your friend Spencer have made me wonder if the staple fare in our cookhouse is fine enough for your poor delicate tummies. After consideration. I’ve decided to take potatoes off* the menu for a month. Tighten your bellies. Give you variety.” Bob was numbed. He couldn’t follow Grimshaw. “So,” the sergeant continued, “we shan’t need the fruits of your labours. This mess must be tidied away. Butler, get some flour and some buckets and make up paste. The rest of you, pay attention. By morning, you will have glued the peelings back in place. All neat and tidy. Tomorrow, we shall do the decent thing and bury the spuds with full military honours.” The next night, Butler and Terry held Frank Spencer down while the rest of the squad lined up, raw potatoes in their frostbitten Angers. They forced him to eat the cold, hard spuds. Frank sobbed, mouth bleeding, as he chewed. His teeth cracked on the stringy potato mulch. Bob held Spencer’s chin and forced him to swallow. He felt nothing. “Come in, come in, dear boy. We meet at last!” The Bloomsbury office was just as he had imagined a literary agent’s would be: thick carpet, heavy mahogany furniture, a few cardboard boxes (manuscripts, no doubt), an occasional table with a bottle of sherry. The only things out of place were framed pictures, messy collages made of pictures scissored from books and magazines. Kenneth Halliwell looked the part, too, wearing a silk 12 interzone Kim Newman and Eugene Byrne dressing gown, smoking a pink Sobranje in a cigarette- holder. He pressed a desk buzzer, ‘‘Joseph, could you delight us a moment with your presence.” A man popped in. Joseph wore Russian-style bell-bot- toms and a white vest. In his 30s, he was trying to look younger. His glossy hair was down over the tops of his ears. “Bob and I are in need of some refreshment. Would you procure some tea?” “Earl Grey, Lapsang Souchong or Ty-Phoo?” HalliwelFs assistant had a thin voice, with a little Leicester in it somewhere. Bob chose Earl Grey. It wasn’t Ty-Phoo and was easier to pronounce than Lap- sang Souchong. Joseph flounced out. “I am sorry about the boy,” said Halliwell. “Some- times I think, ‘if only I had a hammer. . .’ It’s so hard to get the help. Poor Joe fancies himself a writer, but he just hasn’t got it. He keeps turning out silly little plays, daft experimental stuff full of obscenities. How does he imagine he’d ever get by the Lord Chamberlain?” Halliwell picked up what Bob realized was his manuscript. “This, on the other hand, is good. Needs a polish, but I think we have something very saleable. It’s raw, it’s imme- diate, direct. Above all it’s angry, without being unpa- triotic. I shouldn’t think we’ll have too much trouble with the censors, though I hope to Heaven we have a little T “Why do you want trouble with the censors?” Even a publishing novice like Bob knew how heavily the Lord Chamberlain could come down on a book. The Lady Chatterley trial had all but bankrupted Penguin, and the upholding of the Obscenity verdict by Lord Chief Justice Gk)ddard had forced everyone to play safe. “Because, dear boy, every time the papers report that a book worries the censors, it means an extra 10,000 copies.” Ten thousand copies! An extra 10,000 copies! But only if they weren’t pulped by the Post Office. “I also took the liberty of getting a Roneo of your manuscript sent to Gelbflsch.” “Schmuel Gelbflsch? The Russian film producer?” “He’s Polish actually. Well, Jewish really. Gelbflsch won’t read your book himself He has people to do that for him. Sam dodders into London every year to buy books and plays. I know he’s desperate to do a film about the Indo-China War. The Russkies are just as mired in it as we are, and the right story could be terrific box-office.” He knew he was being a prat, but Bob couldn’t help but imagine Albert Finney playing him, and Larushka Skikne as Terry, with Michael Caine maybe as Stan Butler. Julie Christie as Thelma, William Pratt as Grimshaw, Jack Hawkins as Molesworth, Peter O’Toole as Fotherington-Thomas. A Royal Film Premiere, with the King and the Tsarina. Queues outside the Regal, with his name up in lights. “We’re going to have to think of a title. Joseph sug- gested It Ain't HalfHoty Mum. I quite like it. Conjures the insolent cheeriness of the ordinary soldier, but also suggests sentimentality and yearning for home. What do you think?” “Actually, Mr Halliwell...” “Kenneth, please...” “Actually, er, Kenneth, I don’t like that at all. It’s the sort of thing a Londoner would say. I’m from the North- East.” “Oh. Pity.” “Mortar!” yelled Bob “Hit the deck!” A second shell fell with an ill-tempered crump into a paddy field. A ten-foot tall column of water rose. Everyone yelled at everyone else to take cover. Bob threw himself at the dirt next to a wooden hut. He took the safety off his SLR and chanced a peep over a low wall of baked mud. Lieutenant Gurney paced up and down about 30 yards away, right out in the open, scan- ning the treeline with binoculars. “Bloody toff,” said Terry, crawling up beside Bob. “He’s trying to draw their Are so’s we can get some idea where they are.” “He’s showing off is what he’s doing,” said Terry. “He’s a belted earl. He has to prove he’s got more guts than us proles.” A ball of oily flame engulfed the lieutenant. “Christ in Heaven,” said Terry. “I didn’t mean that!” Burning pieces of Jack Gurney filled the air. They were breathing him, choking on him. Casper squirmed up next to them. “See any small-arms?” “Nowt yet. Only mortars. They just hit Lieutenant Gurney.” “That was no mortar. He trod on a mine.” Bob’s stomach clenched. This wasn’t a chance encounter with the treens. The platoon had been drawn into a trap. He flinched as a machine gun opened up from the treeline about 300 yards away. Tracers churned up the ground a comfortable distance beyond the wall. Earth pattered on them. “Aye, this spot’ll do,” said Casper. He unslung a long leather case from his back and drew out a lovingly-oiled Lee-Enfleld. From one of his ammunition-pouches, he took a telescopic sight wrapped in oilcloth. Neatly, he fixed the sight to the rifle. Casper was the platoon sniper. He’d been in Indo ten days when he took the brigade trophy for skill-at-arms. Butler came over. “Snudge says we’re to set up along here with what- ever cover we can. He’s put one of the Brens over to our right. He says you’re to set up here too, Casper. If you clock anything wearing pyjamas, slot it and pray it’s Ho Chi Mekon himself” “Willco,” Casper breathed. His mind was already miles away, willing victims to wander into his cross-hairs. Bob was starting to be afraid of little William Casper, with his hawk-eyes and ever-mounting kill score. He was an ancient child, more bird of prey than man. Bob, Terry and Butler sat with backs to the wall and heads well down. If Vic tried to come at them across open rice paddies, they’d hear about it soon enough. “What are we in for?” asked Terry. “Dunno,” said Butler. “Snudge is dialling 999.” A shell burst very close to the wall. Bob’s ears hurt. Nobody said anything for a while. At the morning briefing. Captain Fisher, the battal- ion intelligence officer, had said this would be a routine Bryant and May raid. Everyone home in time for tea and the football results on the Forces Broadcasting Ser- Ausust 1997 13 Teddy Bears’ Picnic vice. It was only as the platoon was rattling along a dirt road in a couple of old Matadors that Butler told Bob why the old sweats groaned when Captain Fisher walked into the tent. Bob had liked Fisher. He had a soft West Yorkshire accent, not a wireless announcer drawl like Gurney. He seemed an ordinary bloke. But behind his back, he was called Billy Liar. The Indo-China War in his head was long over and he was mopping up before the Victory Parade. Nothing he said bore any relationship with the truth. The way Fisher told it, all they had to do was come out here and burn down this village. The civilians and their livestock had already been moved to a protected compound (which was what Fisher insisted they call concentration camps). This was in keeping with the policy in the British sector of depriving the Viet-Cong or any NVA infiltrators of help from the civil population. The tactic had worked in Malaya in the 1950s, prompting Anthony Eden, the Saviour of Suez, to com- mit himself to the Relief of Indo-China. Eden hoped to replay World War II, with himself as Churchill and Ho Chi Minh, “that little Indo-Chinese Upstart,” cast as Hitler. When France went communist after the War, they pulled out of their former colonies, leaving a few ideologues - Red Jesuits, they called them - behind. A “democratic” regime sprouted, puppeteered by French colonial die-hards who refused to follow the Paris line, but that collapsed after the humiliation visited on all those battle-hardened Maurices at Dien Bien Phu. It fell to Britain and her Empire and Commonwealth to disinfect Indo on behalf of the free world. Naturally, Russia couldn’t let that happen, so Premier Kissinger got up in the Duma and pledged to match the Brits man for man and gun for gun. Eden and Kissinger both claimed to have made the first commitment to South- East Asia. The British and Russian armies each referred to their allies as “reinforcements.” It had been bloodless enough to start with, merely a matter of sending a few technicians and instructors to help the regimes in the Republic of South Vietnam. Now the commies were on the march again, with the support of plenty of folk fed up with the corrupt and incompetent succession of governments in Saigon. What had started as a “limited police action” with a few Gurkhas had in seven years become so popular it was keeping 100,000 British and 20,000 Anzac troops in work, not to mention the 150,000 Russians (and rising) who’d come along, too. Enoch Powell, Eden’s successor as Prime Minister, would gladly give the whole bloody shooting-match to the Ivans, anyone dammit!, and get Britain out. But a British Gov- ernment’s word was its bond, and the Russians couldn’t be allowed win the war on their own. The British were supposed to be fighting American- backed communists, but strategists spent more time jockeying for position with the Russians. A Punch car- toon showed King Edward VIII and Tsarina Tatiana in full state uniforms standing over a map of Indo-China, squabbling about who would administer which regions “when the victory was won,” while a tiny, ragged Ho said “what do you mean ‘when’?” The treens found their range. One of the eggs landed somewhere behind them, in the village. Someone yelled “first aid!” It all happened in slow motion. Bob reckoned he should have been deafened by the racket from the explosions. Somehow, he wasn’t. He was in mortal dan- ger here and realized he was enjoying it, savouring it. It was something to write home about. This was mak- ing a man of him. “The condemned men are entitled to a last smoke,” said Terry, offering round Capstans. They all lit up. Someone scurried over at a low crouch. “Put those fuckers out you stupid fucks!” shouted Sergeant Snudge. “Fucking treens can see your fuck- ing smoke a fucking mile away. Then you fuckers’ll be fucking fucked.” Bob stubbed the cigarette. He knew Snudge - bloody silly name - didn’t like him. None of the old lags did. They were new bugs, the sprogs, and as such bad joss. Regulars despised National Servicemen, claiming that they tended to get themselves and others killed, but the one time Bob snapped and declared himself as a vol- unteer, he was scorned even more openly. “The Mekon’s got us pinned,” said Snudge. “We can’t rush him because we don’t know where he is or how strong he is, and it’s over nearly-open ground. We can’t do a runner because the little bastards have cut the fuck- ing road as well. I’ve radioed for help, but we’ve to wait here until Billy Liar finds the bottle to tell Lieutenant- Colonel Windrush he’s fucked up afuckinggain. Then we have to wait until Windrush finishes dithering and gets Brigade’s permission to call for assistance. Just pray it’s the dropshorts and not the fucking Raf If you see any aircraft, then for fuck’s sake, fucking hide. Now get dug in. If a firework comes your way before you’ve got a hole, flatten yourself on the dirt face-down. And keep your gob open. It’ll stop you going deaf Butler, report to Popeye, collect some spare ammo, and a crate of gold-tops and pineapples. Get yourselves nice and fucking comfy. It’s going to be a fucking long day.” Bob wasn’t enjoying this any more. Terry had the spade, a crummy little thing with a handle no longer than his forearm. Eighteen inches down and he hit water. Not surprising, with a paddy field close by. “Bollocks!” said Terry. Two shells landed in front of them in rapid succes- sion, spattering loose change against the wall. Bob’s ears were ringing. “They’re cornin’,” said Casper quietly, from behind his rifle-sight. “Usin’ t’mud banks in t’paddy for cover. I see at least five. Can’t get a bead on any yet.” “I’ll tell Snudge and get the ammo,” said Butler, crawling at speed towards the middle of the village. Moments later, a vast cage of hot metal enveloped them. Mortar shells exploded all around, machine-gun bullets hammered the dirt wall. Any more and the wall would simply disintegrate. Bloody Yanks. The Mekon’s Communist Allies, the United Socialist States of America, were pledged to support North Viet- nam and the Viet Cong to the hilt. Except there were no actual Yanks in Indo. They’d learned a lesson invad- ing Japan in ’45 and liked to get others to do their fight- ing in the Pacific Rim. There was a supply route - the Casey Jones Trail - running through the warring 14 interxone Kim Newman and Eugene Byrne statelets that used to be China, all the way down to Cambodia. By the feel of it, all that Yank ordnance was being delivered right here. Casper fired, smoothly slid his rifie-bolt back, then forward, and bit his lower lip. He’d got one. Butler came back, dragging two wooden boxes behind him. “Help yourselves,” he said. One box contained smooth, round phosphorus grenades - gold-tops. In the other were the Mills bombs - pineapples - beloved of the Commando comics Bob and Terry had read as kids. They spaced out behind the wall, laying out grenades and spare magazines. They’d lost interest in digging in. There was a bigger than usual explosion behind them. Black smoke. Popping and zipping noises. The Mekon’s mortars had brewed up one of the lorries, and plenty of spare ammunition by the sound of it. Bob was breathing too fast. Was this what a panic attack felt like? “Terry?” he shouted. “Kiddo?” said Terry, tightening the chinstrap on his helmet. “Nothing,” said Bob. “Aye, mate,” said Terry, smiling. “Me too.” At the far end of the wall, the Bren opened up. Short, intense bursts hammered like a pneumatic drill. Casper fired over and over, working his rifie-bolt like the pis- tons of the Flying Scotsman. Bob peered over the wall, saw the top of a head - a shock of black hair - over a little mud-bank a hundred yards off He aimed, squeezed the trigger - almighty bang! - and missed. The Bren tore up water and mud. Bob jammed himself against the wall, head well down, and held the rifie over his head with both hands, work- ing the trigger with his thumb, tr 3 dng to stop the thing flying out of his hands, firing in the general direction of the enemy. A gold-top exploded Kke some pure white blossom, send- ing thin trails zipping out in every direction, searing squiggles into his eyeballs. Gleaming aluminium roared overhead. Trees burned like a Guy Fawkes bonfire. “Canberras!” shouted Butler. '‘English Electric Canberras,” said Bob. The napalm and the heat of the engines made the air look like the clear, freezing water of a brook in the York- shire Dales. The Main Humanities Lecture Hall of the University of Sussex was packed to capacity. Students even sat cross-legged in the aisles. There were nearly a thousand of them out there, all impossibly young and fresh. Bob had only a couple of years on the older ones, but they looked as if they came from another world. Clean-cut girls in college scarves and duffel-coats; Beetniki aping Russian style in goatee beards, bell-bottoms and Afghan coats; clever, angry lads from pit villages and factory towns; ironic, waspish waifs who had failed Oxbridge entrance and were going the plateglass route. “Settle down, please,” said Dr Dixon fi^om the podium. Bob hadn’t wanted to come, but Kenneth had pleaded. It would get into the papers, it would sell more books. He glanced across the stage at the men with whom he would debate. Francis Urquhart, the local MP, was talking down to the bewildered Jim Hacker, a former Eden protege serving his time as a Junior Minister. The government spokesmen sat unsubtly to the right, while Bob was next to Howard Kirk, reader in Sociology, who took the extreme left. Author of The Russians Can Bloody Have Constantinople, a book about radical oppo- sition to British imperialism, the long-haired academic smoked a roll-up with casual arrogance. “I suppose this is as quiet as it’s going to be,” said Dixon, nervously, “perhaps we can get started.” There was a uproar and cheering as a group of stu- dents unfurled a long banner. They wore American- style broad-brimmed hats and sleeveless leather jackets with red tin sheriff-star badges. Dixon attempted an apologetic smile that came out as a grimace. The 30- foot-long banner declared WORKERS AND INTEL- LECTUELS UNITE AGAINST ANGLO-RUSSIAN IMPERIALISM IN INDO-CHINA. Urquhart sneered at the misspelling. Hacker asked to have it pointed out, then laughed loudly at “intellectuels.” Men with cameras - press? - took pictures of the banner. His book had been out for five weeks and garnered good reviews. Bernard Levin, Malcolm Muggeridge and Christopher Booker praised him in the Times, Punch and the Statesman. Even a blimp called Brigadier Alis- tair Lethbridge-Stewart, drafted by the Daily Telegraph to pass comment, acknowledged Bob had “seen a thing or two,” though he finally dismissed the book as “a rather insolent eructation from the ranks.” Dixon introduced the panel. The politicians were hissed, which upset Hacker but steeled Urquhart’s con- tempt for young people. Kirk grinned and waved at the regimented clapping which greeted him. This was not an impartial crowd. “And finally,” said Dixon, “an Indo-China veteran who, as author of It Ain't Half Hot, Mum, has done much to bring into the public arena questions about British involvement in the war.” Students cheered and whistled. For him! They kept on cheering. Kirk was a bit put out. Bob was puzzled, but thrilled. At last, he had his hero’s welcome, from people who had looked down at him all his life. “Perhaps we could begin,” said Dixon, “by asking Bob for an assessment of the feelings of the ordinary soldier about service in Indo-China. Do the troops feel as though they don’t belong there?” Over and again. Captain Vinh had asked the same question, between punches, slaps, and blows from rifle- butts. Bob never did have an answer. For Vimto or any- one else. “To be honest,” he said, “most squaddies have no strong opinion on whether they should be there or not. They’ve been called up...” “What I think Bob’s trying to say,” interrupted Kirk, “is that our soldiers have been lied to by the British and Russian governments. Well over 90 percent of our ser- vicemen in Indo-China are conscripts...” “What I think Bob’s trying to say,” interrupted Urquhart, “is that our splendid lads are doing their duty like honest, loyal patriots...” “What I think Bob is saying is. . .” interrupted Hacker. He never got the chance to finish. The hall erupted. Some students jeered and whistled, the others chanted “Heavens no, we won’t go!” Most boys here would have National Service deferred so they could complete their education. Then they’d be August 1 997 15 Teddy Bears' Picnic called up. At least half would end up in Indo during their two years. Bob wasn't sure how he felt about the politics, but he honestly couldn't blame them for not wanting to go. He'd been stupid enough to volunteer. “This war is none of our business,” shouted Kirk above the din, to huge cheers. Urquhart tried to say something about an international duty to save the world from the evils of American Communism. Hacker looked queasy. Over to the side of the stage, a tall, muscular middle- aged bloke in a suit, short hair, thin lips, definitely ex-mil- itary - Hacker's bodyguard? - spoke into a walkie-talkie. A knot of men in brown corduroy trousers and polo- neck sweaters moved rapidly down the left-hand edge of the hall towards the stage. Bob knew at once these were serious people, not like the rich poseurs wearing Red Chic slouch hats and tin stars. He reached for the commando-knife taped as always to his ankle. Then he remembered he was the hero here. They'd be after the MPs. Objects flew. Bob's entire body flinched, and he fought the urge to throw himself flat on the stage. He heard explosions and gunfire, but it was just the slamming of spring- hinged wooden seat-bottoms as kids stood up. He looked at Hacker and Urquhart, who were cring- ing behind a human wall. The bodyguard's broad back was splattered with egg-yolks. Bob shook, uncontrollably. With a straight face. Captain Fisher assured us our action had been an outstanding success. We had killed 15 Viet-Congy wounded another 20 and captured two machine guns and 42 assorted small-arms, all Ameri- can-made. We listened in astonishment. There was only our platoon involved and as soon as the Raf pounded what may or may not have been enemy positions, the treens just faded away. I only saw a single dead enemy - the one Casper hit - and we certainly didn't carry off any weapons. Our score was one dead lieutenant - posthumous VC, of course, for the 14th Earl - and three men wounded. Nonetheless ''Billy Liar\" wrote it up as a victory. I don't know if anybody higher up the chain of command really believes him, but my impression is that we are sinking further into the mire of Indo because \"Fisher\" is too soft-hearted to tell his superiors how badly we're doing. In turn, they are too timid to tell the generals, who keep the worst of it from Enoch Powell, who tells the King we won the War in 1964. The only people who realize we're losing are sergeants, and they're as inscrutable as hateful buddhas. If they had any opin- ions of their own, they'd die rather than let them out. Believe me. I've seen that happen. In the senior common room Bob drank whisky with Dixon, Kirk and a few others. After the Minister and the MP fled, Kirk had turned the meeting into an anti- war rally, hijacking Bob's book for his political ends. Bob flustered and turned red at first, but part of him enjoyed the hero-worship of a thousand passionate and intelligent young people. And it was hard to argue with Kirk's line that Britain had no business in Indo-China. Dixon came over, evidently half-cut. “You know, old man, we tried to get your pal to come along.” “Terry?” The name was a stone in Bob's mouth. “He's controversial, isn't he? Does he mean it?” He was vaguely surprised Terry hadn't come up earlier. “Yes, Dr Dixon.” “Jim, please.” “Yes, Jim. Terry means what he says.” Bob hadn't seen Terry since coming back, and Terry had made no attempt to contact him. Most people thought what Terry had done was treasonable, but Bob hadn't written it that way. The least he could do was give his oldest friend the benefit of a doubt. Would Terry have got three cheers from the students? Yes, he probably would. “Hello,” said a woman. Bob looked into startling eyes. She was in her late teens or early 20s and slim, with long straight hair and an elfin face. She wore blue cor- duroy bell-bottoms and an embroidered Afghantsy coat. “Bob, this is Diana. Diana Scott.” “I'm a drama student,” she said. “I'm with Howard. Dr Kirk.” Bob guessed what that meant. Lucky bastard. A woman in early middle age bustled into the room, all smiles and theatrical kisses. “Who's that?” said Bob. “Howard's wife,” admitted Diana. “Probably come to collect him. It's her birthday. They're going to the the- atre. The latest Rattigan. Howard's looking forward to shredding it.” He looked funny at her, trying to work it out. She sighed and smiled indulgently. Bob must seem amazingly provincial to her. He was painfully conscious of his accent. “It's an open marriage. They're well-known for it. They regard wedlock as patriarchal and exploitative.” Bob had read about this kind of thing in the Observer. Him and Thelma would be in bed together of a Sunday morning, with the papers. He'd make fun of it, but secretly be envious; she'd be disgusted, but be secretly threatened. That was back when they were still sharing a bed. Recently, Thelma was losing interest in sex, and objected to him screaming in his sleep. Then there was the business of keeping the commando-knife under the * pillow. Just in case burglars came in when they were asleep, he said. Everybody nagged them both about having kids. “Come on. Bob,” said Diana. “I don't want to spend the rest of the evening drowning in sherry with these tweedy codgers. There's a wine bar just opened in town. From there we can go on to a discotheque.” They had 72 hours' leave. Lieutenant Noote, the padre, had tried to muster a team for “a game of footer against our ARVN friends.” Bob was deputed to tell him that the platoon would rather spend time in Saigon. It was hard to explain without mentioning whores. Bob knew Noote understood the situation exactly, but still felt guilty for disappointing the poor man. The padre was okay. He tried not to think about Thelma. During awkward pauses in the conversation, Noote's office rattled with skiffle from his wireless. Mostly, the Forces Broadcasting Service played ballads and big band, but there was one anarchic announcer - Simon Dee - who played Lonnie Donegan, Chas McDevitt and Ray Ellington, and was starting to give needle-time to 16 interzone radical new music coming out of Russia and Ireland and even Great Britain. You never heard Lulu or Cilia Black, who sang as if they were desperate for a shag, on Two-Way Family Favourites, and certainly you never heard Alan Price or the Quarrymen, or Newcastle’s own People’s Bal- ladeer, Alan Hull. Those songs made Bob feel things he’d couldn’t say out loud. Angry, joyous, sexual. North- ern things. He couldn’t hear Price’s “Kalinka” without wanting to explode, and there was something dreadful in the Quarrymen’s “gallant cossack horsemen in their thousands dying” he couldn’t get out of his mind. Saigon would have been wonderful if there wasn't a war on. All the mystery of the orient combined with the chic of France, the former colonial power. Many of the buildings are elegant, the food - if you can be bothered to wander beyond the NAAFI -is a marvellous mixture of French and oriental, the streets are full of bustle and life. Whole families riding on Russian motorbikes, street traders sell- ing cigarettes and souvenirs, kids asking for buckshee. . . and the women. But before a squaddy could find himself a nice girl and exchange ten shillings for three or four minutes of true love, he had to get tanked up. That was easy in Saigon, if dangerous. Walking into a bar where the Anzacs were drinking was asking to be duffed up. When Aussies get more than two ''tubes\" of Fosters in them, they start wondering what they are doing in Indo. Then they reason Britain got them in the war. Their next impulse is to find a Pom and knock his teeth out. The air was thick with the screeches: “I want you give me one. Tommy.” “Bet you fancy me, Brian.” “Sucky- fucky, ten-bob note!” As Terry negotiated with some 15 -year-old street angel, her younger sister was draping herself around Bob, fingers fiuttering against his fiy. “I love you long-time. Tommy,” she cooed in his ear. “Do you fine knee-trembler.” Butler came along and unpeeled the girl. Bob wanted to deck the cockney bastard. But he was also grateful. The longer he was in Indo, the harder he found it to be unfaithful to Thelma. At first, like everyone, he had been on holiday; all arrangements were sus- pended, all bets were off! Sex was affordable and available all the time, and no one thought less of you for whoring. Every time, he thought more about Thelma and dis- appointed himself The funny thing was that sometimes he couldn’t even remember what Thelma looked like. All around him were tiny, pretty faces. Almond eyes dark as night, tiny teeth sharp as pins. “Watch the door, our kid,” Terry said, as he and Bob went upstairs. Bob nodded. Often, soldiers were interrupted in flagrante by chop- per-waving young men claiming to be brothers or fiances of supposedly nice girls. It took a lot more than ten bob to square them. Down the street, a radio was playing. “A Mouse Lived in a Windmill in Old Amsterdam,” Ronnie Hilton. All signs were in faded French and Vietnamese, battered English and new-painted cyrillic. Everywhere, there were posters for Vimto. Some of the whores believed douching with the stuff prevented conception and VD. Kim Newman and Eugene Byrne The Russians were taking over in Indo-China, reliev- ing the British in the south, particularly the Mekong and the Piedmont areas. The Brits ran the show on the coastal plains and the highlands, where most guerrilla activity was. HM Forces had more practice at dealing with that than Ivan. Popeye Popplewell said the year before you could get “sucky-fucky” in Saigon for half a crown. The Russkies drove prices up, and wore girls out. They did ever 3 d:hing to excess. Including, so dark rumour had it, commit war crimes. A staff car cruised by, scattering children. In the back, an ARVN officer sat bolt upright, with more braid on his uniform than a cinema usher. With him sat a veiled Dragon Lady, one of the daughters of Fu Manchu. An ox-cart got in the way and the car stopped. The offi- cer stood up to shriek at a peasant, who shrugged. The officer ordered his driver to reverse. The Dragon Lady leaned forward to whisper in the driver’s ear and some- thing flashed. The driver’s head tilted back, a red yawn opening in his throat. Bob saw, but the officer didn’t. A tiny gun went off, and the top of the officer’s head came off in his hat. He tumbled out of the car like an unstrung Muffin the Mule. The Dragon Lady vaulted out of the car, ao dai rid- ing up to reveal bare and boyish calves. She paused, pointing a gloved hand at Bob. Her ladylike gun was almost swallowed by her velvet fist. His guts were ice. The sound was turned way down. A breeze lifted the veil and he saw a man’s face. A European face. The world wasn’t making sense. Then he was gone and noise fell in on Bob. Ronnie Hilton was still singing that a windmill with mice in was hardly surprising. The staff car’s engine was still turning over. Terry and Butler came down, buttoning up, big grins on their stupid faces. Bob was still shivering. Whistles sounded. Bob looked at faces in the street. No one had made any more attempt than he had to detain the assassin. No one seemed even to notice any- thing unusual. Terry took charge and got them out of there before the police arrived. “Blimey, Bob,” said Butler. “Can’t leave you alone for a minute.” On our last evening in Pay -Gone there was an ENSA concert hosted by Simon Dee in an aircraft hangar on the edge of town. The comedian was supposed to be Terry Milligan, but he was cancelled by the Ministry of Defence because he'd thrown a batter pudding at 10 Downing Street in protest at the war. Instead, we got Arthur Askey dressed as a bumble-bee. Cliff Richard came on and brought the house down with \"I've Got Sixpence,\" Britain's Eurovision entry that year. I think even he was surprised at the way everyone sang along, but he prob- ably wasn't aware of the superstition among troops in Indo. On the exact date when you have just six months' service left you start a \"chuff chart.\" Thereafter, you tick off each day as it passes. This gave rise to a song popu- lar in camps and barracks throughout South-East Asia: I've got six months, lousy \"^\"^^Hng six months. Six months to hang on to my life. I've got two months to whore, two months to be sore. And two months to get cured for my wife. Ausust 1 997 17 Teddy Bears’ Picnic You won’t have read in the papers about what happened next. The censors like you to think our troops are whole- some chaps who suspend their sexual desire for the dura- tion of hostilities until they can go home and get married. That night, as a troupe of go-go dancers called Pan's Peo- ple kicked into their routine, 2,000 battle-scarred squad- dies rushed the stage. Vietnamese girls are beautiful, but they don't look like the girls back home. We'd none of us seen a girl from back home for quite a while. In their spangled union jack shorts and halters, with long white legs and bulging breasts. Pan’s People were the girls from home we had all been imagining every night. Any man in the audience would have raped the pack of them - seeing on each the faces of his fiancee, girlfriend, some shopgirl, a meter maid - while the rest of us cheered him on. Redcaps came in with firehoses and doused our ardour. I understand two blokes were crushed in the chaos. I wonder what they told the families. Diana had a rich father and a Triumph Spitfire. It made getting to Avening a lot simpler. All morning they’d driven through the Cotswold countryside, stop- ping for a pub limch of cheese, beer and fresh bread. No scampi and chips in a basket here. This was England as everyone wanted it to be. With the aid of the AA map, they’d finally found Avening and asked a man at the local garage for directions to the Powell place. In the back garden, next to a heap of uncut firewood, was a battered Land Rover. The cottage was tiny, cut into the side of a hill at the top of a country lane. It seemed unusually modest for the home of the director of A Matter of Life and Death. Bob knocked. Somewhere a dog barked. The door opened. A small man in his 60s answered. He wore a cardigan and frayed carpet-slippers. He had a small, meticulously-groomed moustache, a large, bony, bald head and huge, bright eyes. For a moment, he said nothing. Then he noticed Diana. He smiled at her. “Who’s your agent, then?” Diana giggled. “Haven’t got one.” “But you are an actress?” “How did you guess?” “With your looks it would be a sin not to be an actress, or perhaps a King’s mistress.” Bob cleared his throat. “In you come then,” said Powell to Diana. “You as well,” to Bob. “I suppose you’re the chap who had the memorable adventures in Indo-China.” ‘That’s right,” said Bob. “Have you been sent my book?” “Unfortunately, yes,” said the old man, leading them into a small, cosy living room. “Earl Grey or Lapsang Souchong?” “Lapsang Souchong,” said Bob. “And you, my dear? You remind me of a pre- Raphaelite model. Cup of tea?” “PG Tips’ll do me fine,” said Diana, taking off her coat and flopping onto a sofa. “Good girl. I’m all out of the posh teas anyway. Tem- porary financial embarrassment. Haven’t made a movie for three years. And that was a nudist flick for a Greek friend.” Powell went off to busy himself with the kettle. Bob took off his crombie and sat next to Diana. She had never heard of Michael Powell and barely recollected the films he had made with his Hungarian partner, Imre Pressburger. But she was an actress, and a movie director was a movie director. No wonder the cunning little vixen had insisted on driving him down here. Until two weeks ago. Bob hadn’t heard of Michael Pow- ell either. Him and Terry had gone to the pictures twice a week for 15 years and knew all the actors and actresses, but couldn’t imagine why anybody would read credits. Kenneth had to explain to him the difference between a producer and a director. However, when given a list of Powell’s films. Bob realized he had seen most of them back when they were kids, though Terry had insisted they not go to see The Red Shoes, which Thelma had been interested in, because it was a girlies’ film, about ballet. When the Gelbfisch corporation bought the rights to It Ain't Half Hot, Mum, Bob had gone to London to meet one of Gelbfisch’s producers, a h 3 ^eractive young Italian (actually he insisted he was Sicilian), Martino Scorsese. Through the producer’s excited discourse Bob gathered Gelbfisch thought it best to have a British director for this subject, and he, Scorsese, had just the man in mind. A man who hadn’t worked for three years, had been rude about his book within moments of meeting him, and was now trying to seduce his girlfriend. “Sugar, anyone?” shouted Powell from the kitchen. “No thanks,” said Diana. “Three for me please,” said Bob. “Only joking,” said Powell. “I’m afraid I don’t have any.” In a tiny cinema at an advertising agency’s offices in Soho, Scorsese had shown him The Red Shoes. It was about a young ballerina and a ruthless White Yank impresario played by John Barrymore who told her she could be happy in love or be a great artist but not both. Scorsese sighed with pleasure every time Barrymore appeared. Terry had been right about it being a daft girlie film, but Bob found himself in tears at the end when the company performed the ballet without Moira Shearer, who had just killed herself Maybe it was Scorsese’s enthusiasm, but Bob was moved - perhaps even upset - by the film. He couldn’t forget it, even if he didn’t like it. Thelma said something similar about Bob’s book. Powell’s career stalled in 1960, when his Peeping Tom was refused a certificate by the Lord Chamberlain’s Office and the negative impounded by the police. It was allegedly the most disgusting picture ever made in Britain, but of course no one would ever know. Since then, he had only shot “glamour” films - silent strip-off shorts lasting one reel or, more bluntly, the length of the average wank - and Nakeder Than Nude. Scorsese des- perately wanted to get Powell working again. Powell came back with the tea. “Didn’t bring any Scotch, did you?” “No, I’m sorry,” said Bob. “Pity,” said Powell. “I asked Gelbfisch’s representa- tive on earth to get you to bring me a bottle. It’s the least I deserve for having waded through your book.” Bob was burning at this persistent rudeness. “I noticed a pub in the village,” said Diana. “They won’t have called time yet. I’ll go and get a bottle.” “There’s no need.” “It won’t take a minute. I insist.” She pulled on her coat and disappeared. “Sit at the table,” said Powell, “and I’ll explain what 18 interzone Kim Newman and Eugene Byrne rm going to do.” Bob did as he was told, and accepted a cup of sug- arless tea. “Fll make this movie,” said Powell, fixing him with inquisitor’s eyes. “Not because of your wretched book. Ill do it for the money, but mainly 111 do it for little Scors- ese. He’s watched all my films, dozens of times. He was quoting great lumps of dialogue to me over the phone the other day. I’ve been here for years. The phone wouldn’t ring for weeks at a time. Then this crazy Sicilian calls.” On the table was the figure of a winged lion, painted gold. Powell picked it up and fidgeted with it for a moment, drifting off into a personal reverie. “Look,” Bob started. “You didn’t come all the way down here to be insulted?” “If you don’t like the book, why don’t we just forget it?” “Should never have put it between hard covers. Bob. It’s a penny dreadful, a poorly-written compendium of cliches. Some nice yams in it, I admit, but there are two reasons I dislike it. First, there’s no magic, no poetry. Second, and this is far more important, there’s a great dishonesty at the heart of it. Haven’t got a fag on you, have you?” Bob fished a packet of Strands and his new Dunhill lighter from his pocket and flung them onto the table. Powell put a cigarette in his mouth and offered one to Bob. Bob refused. Powell lit his cigarette, passed the lighter back, and stuffed the packet into the pocket of his cardigan. “Now,” said Powell, “you’re feeling hard-done-by. You’re probably trying to think of a way of sa 3 dng how dare I insult you after all you’ve been through that won’t sound petulant.” Bob shook his head. “I don’t care whether you like the book or not.” “Of course you do!” he smiled. ‘You’re being dishon- est again. Now, what we need is a shopping list.” Powell took an envelope from a letter-rack and pro- duced a stub of pencil. “Unpaid rates bill. Should be big enough to make the list of the things we’re going to have to change.” “That’s enough!” said Bob, standing up. “I’m a frig- ging war-hero, me. I don’t have to put up with this.” “Sit down!” snapped Powell. “Have one of your cigarettes.” Do as the man says, Bobby, or thee and me'll have a major falling-out. Survivor-Guilt, again. There was plenty in the book that was dishonest. Bob knew. He couldn’t go on too much about the whores with Thelma reading over his shoulder as he typed. Not that that mattered any more. She’d found out about him carrying on with Diana. All the train-trips to Lon- don and overnight stays, pretending he was on business to do with the book. The marriage had been in trouble anyhow. Compared to his new friends, Thelma was just so trivial in her concerns, so boring. They wanted to change the world, she wanted to change the curtains. Bob took a Strand without lighting it. I wasn't talking about Thelma, Bobby lad. This rude old get here has tumbled the Other Thing, hasn't he? The unfinished business. “As it happens, I had another offer yesterday. The reputation, no matter how unearned, of having made Ausust 1 997 19 Teddy Bears' Picnic the most shocking film ever shot in Britain can some- times be helpful. So, either I film your book, or I make Confessions of a Radiogram Repair Man, a sex-comedy which has precious little sex and isn’t funny. But it’s British, and our cinemas are swamped with Russian police films, Australian musicals and German horror movies. I do have yet another choice, to starve, but I don’t much fancy that. “Bob, you rightly believe you’ve had hard times and have earned certain rights. So you have. Fair enough. But you can’t expect medals from an audience. They don’t automatically care about your suffering. They’ll buy their tickets and want something in return. Two hours of magic, wonder, terror, laughter and tears. Gelb- fisch bought your book, and Martino, bless him, is giv- ing it to me. You now forfeit any rights you have in this work, and gracefully pass them on to the experts. It’ll be an exploration. We’ll find out things you don’t know about yourself Maybe things you don’t want to know.” Bob was afraid, but couldn’t let it show. He sighed, smiled and shook his head in resignation. “Whatever you say, Mr P.” “Call me Micky.” Diana returned with a bottle of Johnnie Walker. “Just the ticket, my dear,” said Powell, patting the chair next to him. “Come sit. Bob, are we on exes?” “Eh?” “Expenses. Did Martino fioat you any of Sam Gelb- fisch’s wonga for development?” “Couple of hundred quid.” Powell’s eyes twinkled. “Excellent. We must adjourn to somewhere more amenable. Bob, be a good fellow and toddle into the vil- lage and get a jerrican of three-star. Then we can take the Land Rover. Harvey’s in Bristol, I think. Imre tells me great things about the new chef” As Bob left, he noticed Powell patting Diana’s knee. There was no resemblance, physical or vocal, but Micky Powell reminded him of Terry. “You lot, get out to the mortar pits and piss on them.” “Come again, Sarge?” “Water’s low and the mortar tubes are overheating. Your piddlell cool them down for a while. Get cracking.” “Why-nor,” said Terry, “me grandbairns’ll never believe I passed water for King and Country.” Bob and Butler laughed a little too loud, a little too long. They pulled on helmets and their new Russian- made fiak-jackets and ran out of the bunker at a crouch to the battalion mortar-pits. This was Day 67 or 68 of the siege of Khe Sanh, depending on which reckoning you used. By chuff-chart, it was Day 42, exactly six weeks before Bob was due to ship home. And Terry, Butler and Casper. If they got out of this place. There wasn’t an airstrip any more. The Viet-Cong and the NVA had pushed the perimeter in that close. It was ten days since the last transport, a Blackburn Beverley, had attempted a landing. It lay in a blackened, twisted heap inside what had become enemy territory two days ago. Behind the mortar pits, a small queue of men lay on their bellies. A corporal ushered them in, one at a time, to have a burst on the tubes. Bob had got over being piss-shy after about two minutes in Indo-China. As the perimeter shrank, 8,000 men and 60 artillery pieces were noosed into a smaller and smaller area of rocky, messed-up orange soil. Every enemy shell had been carried over the mountains on the back of a peas- ant, but now every shell was pulling its weight. There were dozens of casualties each day and they could only be evacuated by helicopter. The Army and Air Force were overstretched and the Navy was pressed into ser- vice, taking the wounded out to HMS Bulwark some- where out off the coast. The brass were getting edgy about sending the wokkas. You could tell when they were coming, not by the sound of their engines or rotors, but by the enemy machine-guns and ack-ack opening up on them all along the valley. Now they only fiew in in the thick fog that covered ever 3 dhing until the late morning, but the treens had the range of the landing-strip, and threw everything they had at it anyway. ‘You next/’ said the corporal. Bob scuttled into the sandbagged pit where half a dozen men, stripped to the waist, worked the mortars. “Over here,” said a squat little bloke with fair hair and a black beard. Everyone had beards now. If there’d been water for shaving they wouldn’t have to Jimmy Riddle on the artillery. “Try to give it a hosing from the middle down to the bottom. If you’ve not got enough, concentrate on the bottom.” They’d been here more than two months. At first, they’d been on “offensive patrols” but found nothing. In the dense elephant grass and bamboo thickets, you couldn’t see anyone not holding a gun to your nose. Mostly, they’d been holding a shrinking perimeter, liv- ing in holes in the ground covered in sandbags and oil- drums and empty shell-casings full of dirt, trying to ignore the rats, being shelled and shot at by snipers every hour of the day, wondering if they’d ever be able to sleep again. Bob undid his fiy and pissed. The mortar-tube hissed and a cloud of toxic steam billowed up from it. The lit- tle bloke studied his work with interest. The poor sod was only doing his job. It was bad enough that the wokkas couldn’t get casu- alties out, much worse that they couldn’t get supplies in. Food and ammo were low. Three divisions were sup- posed to be fighting their way up to break the siege, but no sign of them yet. The Raf dropped HE and napalm all over the jungle to no effect. The treens moved their big guns to new positions every night. “Nice one, son,” said the blonde bloke. “Cover your ears.” A round was dropped into the tube. Bob put his hands to his ears and turned away with his cock still hanging out. The shell went away with a nasty, loud “boink!” “I’d put that away if I was you,” said the blonde bloke. “Send in the next one, would yer?” Bob buttoned up and scrambled out of the pit. You’re in, Butler... Ha-ha! You’re in - urine - get it?” Captain Fisher had given a compulsory lecture, which was supposed to convince the men that there was no comparison between the British position at Khe Sanh and the Free French debacle at Dien Bien Phu. No, Cap- tain Fisher said, this was more like the British at Kohima-Imphal, where General Slim lured the Japs into 20 interaone Kim Newman and Eugene Byrne wearing themselves out by attacking a strong position, then defeated them. That night, someone finally settled Billy Liar’s hash. Person or persons unknown sneaked into Fisher’s billet and cooked off a gold-top in his sleep- ing-bag. ‘White-saucing” was by no means an uncommon fate for unpopular officers and NCOs. Lieutenant-Colonel Windrush didn’t even bother to start an enquiry. The bush telegraph had it that the CO was crackers or hit- ting the bottle, or simply just as pleased as everyone else that his intelligence officer had vaporized. Crackers or not, Windrush had more important things to worry about. Crouching behind the sandbags of the mortar-pit. Bob wondered whether or not to make a run for the bil- let. Along with food, water and ammo, cover was in short supply. Khe Sanh was, in Army parlance, a super-sangar, a fort and artillery base on a plateau deep in the Anna- mite mountains, surrounded by other mountains, near the border with North Vietnam and Laos. Its artillery covered the main NVA infiltration route into South Vietnam. Billy Liar aside, the Viet-Cong and the NVA - and their friends in Debs DC - certainly saw it as Britain’s Dien Bien Phu. Its loss could finally force the British to pull out of Indo-China. That would prompt the Australians and New Zealanders to leave too. The Russians might be unwilling to stay on by themselves. Potentially, the future of communism in South East Asia hung on this rat-infested, rust-coloured shit-hole on top of a mountain in the middle of a load of bigger mountains. The big NVA guns, 155mms, opened up from their positions on the Co Roc Ridge about four miles away. In Laos. In another country. “Best stay put for a bit, eh?,” Butler sniggered. “Bloomin’ marvellous, innit? I’ve been taking diarrhoea pills for the last month so’s I can get good and consti- pated and keep the number of bog-trips I have to make at an absolute minimum. Now we get orders to evac- uate bodily wastes. I’m going to write to my MP about this.” “Well, stick me in the envelope along with the letter. I’ve had enough of this now, I want to go home,” said Terry. Three 155mm shells crashed onto the airstrip in rapid succession. * “Hell’s bells,” said Terry. “Anyone got a tab?” “Only these,” said Bob, fishing a packet of Players No 6 from a pocket at the side of his flak-jacket. “I was read- ing in the Mirror the other week that the fag company makes these specially as going-to-work gaspers. You have your nasty cheap little Number 6s at the factory or the office. Then, when you go out in the evening, to the pub or club, like, you have your proper king-sized fags.” “Wouldn’t mind being down the club this evening. What day is it?” “Saturday, man.” “Never mind!” said Butler. “That means there’ll be a film show in the parish haU tonight. Wonder what itll be?” “Same as it’s been for the last five weeks,” said Terry. “The Reverend Noote will run The Browning Version, a travelogue called This is Belgium and Cliff Richard in Summer Holiday!' “’spect you’re right,” said Butler. “Never thought I’d get sick of the sight of a bus.” ‘You think you’ve got problems?” said Terry. “I’m hav- ing strange erotic fantasies about shoving a Mills Bomb up Melvin Hayes’s jacksie.” Casper emerged from the mortar pit. “Getting a bit crowded this side,” said Butler. “Shall we make a run for it?” Casper gazed at the sky, thought for a moment, then nodded. He hadn’t said anything in two weeks. People dealt w"
