At the University of Wessex, Sir John Westgate and Dr Katharine Beckford have spent ten years using computer power and AIs to create over 200 fictional characters from all periods of history, known as 'erams', who interact with their questioners as a real person would. Soliders, parsons, dockers, even a Victorian tart with a heart. For Dr Beckford, it's a wonderful use of artificial intelligence and a superb learning tool. For Sir John, it's a wonderful use of university funds and a superb way to make money (and gain personal honours). Something was bound to go wrong. When a number of erams escape into the world's computer net, and become self aware, it seems that the outbreak can be contained - but life is never that simple. The university authorities should never have attempted to destroy them.'--Page 4 of cover. 352 pages.\n\nCondition: Good. SHIPS FROM USA.
