        "text": "Project Description\n\nThe aim of the current project was to examine the possible relationship between True Crime Streaming consumption (low, medium, high) on scores for each of the five subscales of the Need for Closure scale (which includes the Needs for the Order, Predictability and Decisiveness, Avoidance of Ambiguity, Closed-Mindedness) and Need for Cognition.\n\nTo investigate this, a between groups factorial design was implemented. Participants completed an online survey (N=59, Mean age= 27.95, Males= 50.8%, Females= 49.2%) which included the full Need for Closure scale and revised Need for Cognition scale as well as a list of True Crime series for each of the major streaming services in Ireland (six in total). These total counts of series/documentaries were compiled from each platform to form an individual's total watching score. To create the grouping variables, the total score data was split into roughly three equal groups (Low, Medium, and High). Based on their score, individuals were then placed into one of the three groups. A MANOVA and subsequent Tukey post hoc test were used to analyse the data.\n\nProject Findings\n\nWhilst there was no significant result for the Need for Cognition or Needs for Order, Predictability, Avoidance of Ambiguity, and Closed-Mindedness; there was for Decisiveness.\n\nIndividuals who placed in the high True Crime streaming level had lower scores of Decisiveness than those in the low level of True Crime streaming. Since decisiveness centers around the ability to make decisions quickly, the results suggest that individuals who watch more true crime have less desire to 'freeze' on information. Gendi et al. (2023) found that the need and ability to achieve closure are negatively correlated, which could suggest that those who watch more true crime may have a better ability to achieve closure, than those who watch less.\n\nBuilding on this, combining both the high consumption of content and the relationship to Decisiveness (as both a Need and ability), may pose a threat to verdict and result in the possibility of hung juries. With the proliferation of such content online where ‘live’ updates are occurring pre-trial brings into question a multitude of legal and ethical dilemmas.Therefore, possibly having practical implications reaching into both real life cases and the subsequent criminal prosecution.\n\nThesis Title\n\nThe relationship between True Crime Streaming and Needs for Closure and Cognition."
