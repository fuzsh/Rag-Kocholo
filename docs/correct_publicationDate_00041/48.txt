Mark V. Ziesing Books

Slippage, a collection by Harlan Ellison and Back in the USSA, an episodic novel by Kim Newman & Eugene Byrne were the two Ziesing books for 1997. Thus far in 1998, he has done Black Butterflies, a story collection by John Shirley. As Mark will tell you, he enjoys bookselling and publishing as they allow him to offer stuff that he'd enjoy having if he wasn't doing it himself. He hopes some of you share the same sort of oddball inclinations.
