The recent trip to Canada by another popular Iranian TV host (Rambod Javan) and images of her pregnant (third) wife in Canada without Hijab (Islamic head cover mandated inside Iran) have stirred outrage inside Iran. Rambod Javan works for Iran's government-run state TV and has frequently stated, on air, his love for his homeland Islamic Iran yet he is now in Canada, like many other Persian celebrities, to have his wife deliver their newborn in Canada and receive Canadian citizenship! Javan's conservative as well as liberal critics in Iran now call him a hypocrite.

But Javan is not the first Iranian celebrity who has applied for residency or citizenship in the US or Canada. It is not difficult now to spot popular Iranian figures on the streets of cities like Los Angeles, Toronto and Vancouver. According to Cinema Press, Benyamin, Mahnaz Afshar, Reza Ghoochan Nejad, Mohammad Reza Golzar, Ronak Younesi, Mohsen Tanabandeh, Shila Khodadad, Sam Derakhshani are but a few of celebrities with residences outside Iran now.

In fact, some blogs and websites such as PersianUp now dedicate pages to images of Iranian actresses without Hijab when traveling or immigrating from Iran. Here are some examples:

Hananeh Shahshahani, a 29-year-old Iranian actress and musician before and after emigrating to the United States:

Iranian actress Baharak Saleh Nia is shown here before and after leaving Iran:

Another actress constantly under attack by conservatives in Iran because of her liberal feminist views about religion and Hijab is Mahnaz Afshar who is married to Yasin Ramin, businessman son of an influential political sentenced in May to seven years in jail, Fars news agency reported. Although moderate and reformist in political views, Yassin Ramin is the son of former culture minister Mohammad Ali Ramin, an ultraconservative who banned several publications in Iran under President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and held an international conference attended by holocaust deniers in Iran in 2006:

One of the most controversial women on Iranian TV has been Azadeh Namdari, a former host of a popular TV show in Iran whose divorce from another TV host and second marriage became controversial. On 25 July 2017, a video emerged showing Namdari drinking alcohol and without hijab while on vacation in Switzerland. The event drew a backlash on Iranian social media as she was an advocate of black chador (full Islamic body cover) and compulsory Islamic dress code in Iran:
