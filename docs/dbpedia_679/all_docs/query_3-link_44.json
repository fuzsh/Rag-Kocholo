        "text": "Shahram Mokri (Persian: شهرام مکری‎) is an Iranian writer and film director. Born 1977 in Marand, Iran, Shahram Mokri is a graduate of cinema from Tehran’s Soureh College.\n\nRaised in a family of movie lovers, director Shahram Mokri took multiple filmmaking workshops in his native Iran before enrolling in Tehran at the university to study cinema. He started making short films in 2000 and also edited television series and more than 20 short and documentary films.\n\n“I belong to the group of movie lovers who cut out photos of movie stars from magazines,” recalls Mokri. “I’d hang them on my bedroom wall or stick them on my school notebooks. I’ve loved to make movies since I was a child and I’m so happy to still be doing it now.”\n\nHis short films brought him national and international recognition along with his debut feature film, Ashkan, The Charmed Ring And Other Stories, which had its international premiere at Busan International Film Festival (BIFF) in 2009.\n\nMokri’s second film, Fish & Cat, premiered at the 70th Venice Film Festival and was awarded the Special Orizzonti Award for innovative content. He was nominated for the 2013 Asia Pacific Screen Award for Achievement in Directing for Fish & Cat. For his short film The Dragonfly Storm, Mokri won Best Director at the 2007 Noor Iranian Film Festival.\n\nFilmography\n\n– 2000: Electric Shock And Fly (short)\n\n– 2002: Toofan-e Sanjaghak (The Dragonfly Storm) (short)\n\n– 2005: Mahdoodeh-ye Dayereh (Limit of circle) (short)\n\n– 2006: This is the question (documentary)\n\n– 2007: Andosi (Ando-C) (short)\n\n– 2009: Ashkan, angoshtar-e motebarek va dastan-haye digar (Ashkan, the charmed ring and other stories)\n\n– 2011: Kham, pekhth, swkhth (Raw, cooked and burnt) (short)\n\n– 2013: Mahi va Gorbeh (Fish & Cat)\n\nSources: Wikipedia | Shahram Mokri, Asia Pacific Screen Academy | Shahram Mokri, Houston Iranian Film Festival | Fish & Cat, Film Society Lincoln Center | Meet the (New) Director: Shahram Mokri\n\nTagged: Awards, Cinema, Film, Iran, Shahram Mokri\n\nFish & Cat (from Persian transliterated as Mahi va Gorbeh) is a 2013 mystery drama slasher Iranian film directed by Shahram Mokri. The film was first premiered at the 70th Venice Film Festival in September 2013.\n\n“Selected in 2014 for New Directors/New Films (the annual spring showcase from the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the Museum of Modern Art in New York, USA), Fish & Cat heralds the emergence of a fresh and original new voice in Iranian cinema combining formal experimentation with a sly sense of humour.”\n\nShahram Mokri’s second feature initially seems as if it might be the first Iranian slasher movie, but things are not always as they appear. Filmed in one long, bravura shot by top cinematographer Mahmoud Kalari (A Separation), it plays mind-bending games with time and place while a pair of potential serial killer cannibals stalk a group of camping students at a lake.\n\n“In my short films I was trying to define a new meaning of time, of it being on one plane—very similar to the perspective Escher revealed in his paintings. I attempt to make type of experimental film that shows a new side of what the audience is used to seeing. On the other hand, Fish & Cat was produced due to my interest in slasher and genre films. I wanted to make a movie that would challenge our regular thoughts about time, and also one that used the same old genre structures. For Fish & Cat I took a real-life case and made it my own. It’s also a film that focuses on the Iranian youth generation. Because the film was been shot using just a single one, we rehearsed the film for two months exactly like we would have a theater performance. I decided to prepare with long rehearsals and we ran through the full movie twice a day. The actors do have theatrical backgrounds, so their experience being in front of an audience was helpful throughout.” – Shahram Mokri\n\nAwards\n\n– Special Prize, Venice Horizons Award: 70th Venice Film Festival (2013)\n\n– Best Film Award: Lisbon & Estoril Film Festival 2013\n\n– Muhr Asia Africa Special Jury Prize: Dubai International Film Festival 2013\n\n– FIPRESCI Prize and Youth Jury Award: Fribourg International Film Festival 2014\n\n– Best Film Award (International !f Inspired Competition) and SIYAD (Turkish Film Critics Association) Jury Award: 13th Istanbul Independent Film Festival (2014)\n\nFish & Cat (Mahi va gorbeh) (trailer):\n\nDirector: Shahram Mokri\n\nCast: Babak Karimi, Saeid Ebrahimifar, Siyavash Cheraghi Pour, Mohammad Berahmani\n\nProducer: Sepher Seifi\n\nExecutive Producer: Shahrzad Seifi\n\nScreenwriter: Shahram Mokri\n\nDirector of Photography: Mahmoud Kalari\n\nProduction Designer: Amir Esbati\n\nMusic: Christophe Rezai\n\nSound: Parviz Abnar\n\nProduction Company: Kanoon Iran Novin\n\nSources: Wikipedia | Fish & Cat, trigon-film.org (Photos), UCLA Happenings | Fish & Cat, The Hollywood Reporter, 13th !f Istanbul Independent Film Festival, Vancouver International Film Festival (VIFF) 2014 | Fish & Cat, Houston Iranian Film Festival | Fish & Cat\n\nTagged: Awards, Babak Karimi, Cinema, Film, Iran, Shahram Mokri\n\n“My name is John Ford and I make westerns” this is how John Ford introduced himself at the American Film Directors’ Association gathering. Negahdar Jamali, an Iranian from Shiraz introduced himself the same way when I first met him without knowing John Ford that well.\n\n“MY NAME IS NEGAHDAR JAMALI AND I MAKE WESTERNS” he introduced himself with self-confidence and without any weakness in his statement; not in the Monument Valley or in the Grand Canyon but in Shiraz and the deserts surrounding the city. He has been making Western films continuously for the past 35 years under hard conditions, and this film is about the struggle with his family, friends and society to make what he likes the most in his life “Western Movies”.\n\nWhile “My Name is Negahdar…” might begin as an oddity it soon evolves into a moving tribute to a man who will let nothing separate him from his art. “I almost fell into the trap of making a social documentary but then I realised that with this film cinema is the only thing that matters,” said Heidari.\n\n“It is about a man and his love for cinema and for making cinema. His love for cinema is just so pure. He doesn’t want to make money out of them, he just wants to make these films and he puts everything he has into it,” he said. “It’s inspiring and a lot more honest to just tell his story.”\n\nMy Name Is Negahdar Jamali And I Make Westerns (trailer):\n\nDirector: Kamran Heidari\n\nCast: Negahdar Jamali\n\nMovie type: Documentary\n\nPhotography: Kamran Heidari\n\nEditor: Bahman Kiarostami\n\nSound recorder: Sasan Kaveh\n\nSound mix: Kamyar Behbahani, Farshid Zarmehr\n\nMusic selection: Ennio Morricone, Hamid Saeed\n\nProduction Manager: Tahereh Alavizadeh\n\nProducer: Mehrdad Monavarian\n\nColor, SD-Video, 16:9, 65 min, 2012, IRAN\n\nSources: Iranian Film Festival in Germany, The Daily Star Lebanon, My name is Negahdar Jamali and I make westerns (Photos), Kamran Heidari Official Site | Films\n\nTagged: Cinema, Film, Iran, Kamran Heidari, Movie, USA\n\nThe UCLA Film and Television Archive is pleased to once again explore the diverse currents of Iranian cinema with its annual series highlighting recent and classic films from Iran and the Iranian diaspora.\n\nThe Program “UCLA Celebration of Iranian Cinema”, funded by the Farhang Foundation, will take place from April 25, 2015 to May 16, 2015 at the Billy Wilder Theater in Westwood Village, Los Angeles, USA.\n\nFilm directors Rakhshan Banietemad (4/25), Shahram Mokri (4/26), Kamran Heidari (4/27), Sepideh Farsi (5/8), Zhinous Pedram (5/10) and Amir Badie (5/16) will be attending in-person to discuss their work.\n\nIn the wake of Asghar Farhadi’s Best Foreign Language Film Oscar win for A Separation in 2011, the depth and breadth of Iranian cinema today continues to amaze even as the challenges faced by its filmmakers remain of concern.\n\nWhile established masters continue to make their unique voices heard, including writer-director Rakhshan Banietemad, whose award-winning Tales opens this year’s series, newer filmmakers continue to captivate. Farhadi’s influence can be felt in a number of outstanding, tightly-wound contemporary dramas by emerging directors (Melbourne, I’m Not Angry), while others are charting radically different paths visually and narratively (Fish & Cat, 316).\n\nScreening schedule:\n\nSaturday, April 25\n\nTALES (Ghesse-ha) / 7:30 PM /\n\nIn person: Rakhshan Bani-Etemad (DIR)\n\nIran, 2014 / 91 min. / DIR: Rakhshan Banietemad /\n\nCAST: Fatemeh Motamed Aria, Peyman Moaadi, Baran Kosari\n\nWinner of the Best Screenplay award in Venice, writer, writer-director Rakhshan Banietemad’s return to fiction filmmaking is a tour-de-force portrait of a people and a society at the breaking point.\n\nSunday, April 26\n\nI’M NOT ANGRY (Asabani nistam!) / 3:00 PM\n\nIran, 2014 / 110 min. / DIR: Reza Dormishian /\n\nCAST: Baran Kosari, Navid Mohammadzadeh, Reza Behoudi\n\nDirector Reza Dormishian’s second feature bluntly depicts the seething frustrations of a generation through the emotional and personal struggles of a student activist trying to get his life on track.\n\nFISH & CAT (Mahi va gorbeh) / 7:00 PM /\n\nIn person: Shahram Mokri (DIR)\n\nIran, 2013 / 134 min. / DIR: Shahram Mokri /\n\nCAST: Babak Karimi, Saeed Ebrahimifar, Siavash Cheraghipoor\n\nWith Fish & Cat, writer-director Shahram Mokri emerges as an original new voice in Iranian cinema, blending bravura technical skills with a boldly absurdist, apocalyptic vision.\n\nMonday, April 27\n\nMY NAME IS NEGAHDAR JAMALI AND I MAKE WESTERNS / 7:30 PM /\n\nIn person: Kamran Heidari (DIR)\n\nIran, 2013 / 65 min. / DIR: Kamran Heidari / CAST: Negahdar Jamali\n\nUtterly unexpected and thoroughly charming, director Kamran Heidari’s debut documentary about an amateur filmmaker in southwestern Iran explodes preconceived notions and illuminates the universal power of cinema.\n\nFriday, May 1\n\nTODAY (Emrouz) / 7:30 PM\n\nIran, 2014 / 88 min. / DIR: Reza Mirkarimi /\n\nCAST: Parviz Parastui, Soheila Golestani, Shabnam Moghadami\n\nIran’s official submission for Oscar consideration, writer-director Reza Mirkarimi’s tense, powerful drama unfolds over a single day after a cab driver allows himself to be drawn into the personal crisis of a woman who jumps into his backseat.\n\nSaturday, May 2\n\nRED CARPET (Farshe Ghermez) / 7:30 PM\n\nIran, 2014 / 80 min. / DIR: Reza Attaran /\n\nCAST: Reza Attaran, Marc Ansari, Susan Parvar\n\nOne of Iran’s most famous comedians, Reza Attaran, takes on Hollywood and the international media in this hilarious but gentle satire.\n\nWednesday, May 6\n\nWHAT’S THE TIME IN YOUR WORLD?

In 2012, Heidari directed his very first full-length documentary about the life of the eccentric and touching figure of Negahdar Jamali from Shiraz.\n\nIn 2013, Heidari directed another documentary, also on the life of an eccentric and touching person with a dream; Hamid Saeed, one of the best-known Iranian musicians with African roots.\n\nOne day while I was taking photos in Shiraz’s old neighborhood near the bazaar where century-old houses were falling into ruin I saw some beautiful writing on a wall which said “don’t know”.\n\nI took a picture of the wall. As I was editing the photo and looking again at the writing it made me wonder about the person who wrote it? Did he or she write the words in a good mood or were they in a philosophical state of mind?\n\nRumi, the great Persian poet and philosopher wrote that “I” is a euphoric state — “What I know, what I know”. This “I” is what I think about when I take photos — it has become my overall concept for the Shiraz Street Photos series.\n\nThese old neighbourhoods serve as my photo workshop, the walls are my interior design and I carry my studio on my back. The subjects of these portraits stand in front of walls scrawlled with text — text full of sadness, happiness, pleasure, love, but also full of hope for life.\n\nApart from text, these walls incorporate other elements such as telephone and electrical cables, heater vents, and cracks, which make this environment even more attractive to me. These people represent the “don’t know” text on the walls. One can view them from an anthropological perspective — the geographic sections of the city of Shiraz become the backdrops for its’ inhabitants. In all of the photos the subjects look somewhat surreal.

He’s travelling by motorbike across the province of Hormozgan, which is situated in the South of the country on the Persian Gulf, in order to realize his dream. He wants to organize a concert with the best black musicians in the country.\n\nBesides Persians, Indians, Arabs and Europeans, the province of Hormozgan, Iran’s “black south” has been influenced primarily by the descendants of slaves and merchants from Africa. Although Shiites, they still hold Voodoo ceremonies just as their African ancestors did and wakes in Hormozgan are more reminiscent of scenes from New Orleans, with the mourners dancing in an elated and joyous manner to black rhythms.\n\nFilmmaker Kamran Heidari accompanies Hamid Saeid as he attempts to make his dream come true. He must overcome numerous hurdles along the way: Hormozgan’s landscape, which is as inhospitable as it is breathtaking, traveling from the coast over rugged mountains to the desert, the African spirit rites; and the resistance of his wife, who is completely against his plan.\n\nIn an Interview Mr. Heidari talks about the healing tradition of Zar in the south of Iran: “There are wild winds (Dingomaro) coming from Africa and these winds are always in movement. Sometimes these winds take over ones body and then they will stay inside. This is when the Zar ceremony becomes necessary”.\n\nThe healers and masters of Zar ceremonies are called Mama Zar or Baba Zar, depending on gender, and by beating the drums and chanting MamaZar or BabaZar will drive these wild winds away. During the filming of the documentary, Kamran Heidari was asked many times to let Mama Zar drive the Dingomaro away from his body but he declined saying that he has made peace with these African wind spirits and has made friends with them. He would like to keep them in his heart.\n\nBy incorporating African rhythms into the music that he plays, Saeid succeeds in preserving his heritage that he then shares with others. But, at the same time, cultures are dynamic: by mixing African and Iranian beats, he is recreating traditions and moulding them into a new form of hybrid identity. Holding an ‘African-style’ concert in an area where many have rejected, or forgotten about their roots can be challenging. Heidari, together with Saeid, show us how to value this cultural heritage and give it a meaning through music. It was screened as part of the UCLA Celebration of Iranian Cinema in May 2014.\n\nDingomaro – Iran’s Black South (trailer):\n\nDirector: Kamran Heidari\n\nFilm by: Kamran Heidari, Dariusch Rafiy\n\nDoP: Sajjad Avarand\n\nCamera: Kamran Heidari, Bahman Kiarostami, Hasan Rastin\n\nEditor: Kamran Heidari, Martin Homel\n\nAssistant: Tahereh Alavizadeh\n\nSound Recording: Mohamad Hossein Kaveh\n\nSound Mix: Kamyar Behbahani\n\nPhotography: Tahereh Alavizadeh\n\nProducer: Dariush Rafi-y, Kambiz Khorram\n\nDocumentary / 66 min / Color / HD-Video / 16:9 / 2013 / IRAN\n\nSources: The Culture Trip | Kamran Heidari’s universal cinema beauty and humanity from Iran, Kamran Heidari Official Site | Films, Autentic | Dingomaro – Iran’s Black South, Blog Africa to Persia\n\nTagged: Cinema, Film, Hamid Saeid, Iran, Kamran Heidari\n\nReza Attaran (born 1968 in Mashhad) is an Iranian actor, director, screenwriter and singer.

The exhibition features sculptures and large fresco portraits of artists who have stood up for human rights.\n\nMotamed-Arya, 54, is involved in humanitarian activities and helps raise funds for different charities. Her latest gesture is putting up her Crystal Simorgh award, presented to her for the role of best actress in ‘Gilaneh’ in 2005, on sale to support people deprived of a home in Iran.

The program is curated by Ehsan Khoshbakht in collaboration with the National Film Archive of Iran.\n\nThe black comedy “Night of the Hunchback” (1965) directed by Farrokh Ghaffari, set over the course of one night against a backdrop of uptown Tehran partying to Ray Charles, focuses on the efforts of a group of stage actors, the father of a bride, and a hairdresser and his assistant (played by Ghaffari himself) to rid themselves of an unwelcome corpse.\n\nThe satirical documentary “The Night It Rained or The Epic of the Gorgan Village Boy” (1967) directed by Kamran Shirdel, offers a crash course in 1960s Iran. A newspaper story of a heroic village boy who prevented a train disaster appears and spreads quickly. The incident, reported on and challenged by local officials and journalists, is soon doubted and leads ultimately to confusion, with nobody knowing exactly who has saved whom.\n\n“The Cow” (1969) by Dariush Mehrjuii, which is considered as the milestone of Iranian new wave cinema, tells the story of a poor villager whose only source of joy and livelihood is his cow, which provides milk for the village. One night the cow is mysteriously killed and that’s when the madness, or rather transformation, begins.\n\n“A Simple Event” (1973) by Sohrab Shahid Saless depicts a few days in the life of a young boy living by the Caspian Sea. At school he falls behind his classmates and is almost expelled. He helps his father to fish illegally, and at home watches as his mother’s health deteriorates.\n\nAbout Iranian New Wave\n\nIranian New Wave cinema came about as a reaction to the popular cinema of the time which did not reflect the lives of regular Iranians. It began in 1969 and then ended with the beginning of the Iranian revolution in 1979. The films produced were original, artistic and political. The House Is Black by Forough Farrokhzad (1963) is considered to be a precursor to the New Wave cinema. Other films such as Farrokh Ghaffari’s “The Night Of The Hunchback” (1964), Abrahim Golestan’s, “Mud-Brick And Mirror” (1965), and Ferydoon Rahnema’s “Siavush in Persepolis” are all considered to be precursors as well. The first film considered to be part of this movement is Darius Mehrjui’s “The Cow” (1969). Other films considered to be part of this movement are Naser Taqvai’s “Peace in the Presence of Others” (1969/1972), which was banned and then heavily censored upon its release, and Sohrab Shahid Saless’ “A Simple Event” (1973) and “Still Life” (1974).\n\nSources: Tehran Times | News, Il Cinema Ritrovato, Wikipedia | Iranian New Wave\n\nTagged: Cinema, International, Iran, Iranian New Wave, Italia, Italy\n\nThe 4th Persian Film Festival is on from September 3rd to 6th at Palace Norton Street Cinemas, showcasing the best of Iranian cinema and the Persian speaking world.
