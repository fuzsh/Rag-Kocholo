        "text": "The animation, based on an ancient Persian theme, was in production four years and then, despite being completed the film’s premiere was postponed.\n\n“Hollywood always features fake heroes in their movies and animations such as those featured in the animation ‘300’,” Yaghmaian told ISNA on Friday.\n\nThis is the second Iranian animation after “Egypt’s Sun” that will go on screen in the cinemas, he added.\n\nVeteran Iranian actors Parviz Parastuii, Amin Hayaii, Habib Rezaii and Rambod Javan and actresses Sorayya Qasemi and Taraneh Alidusti are featured as the animation’s characters.\n\nThe animation is about Jamshid who falls in love with Princess Khorshid. Her father, the King, decides to call all eligible young men to participate in a competition. Meanwhile, the Khorshid is kidnapped and Jamshid begins a long journey to find her.\n\nDirected by Zack Snyder and based on the epic graphic novel by Frank Miller, “300” is a ferocious retelling of the ancient Battle of Thermopylae in which King Leonidas and 300 Spartans fought to the death against Xerxes and his massive Persian army. Facing insurmountable odds, their valor and sacrifice inspire all of Greece to unite against their Persian enemy, drawing a line in the sand for democracy.\n\n300’s Persians are ahistorical monsters and freaks. They are caricatured as black creatures with bloody eyes, supposedly resembling the terrorists of today. Xerxes is eight feet tall, scantily clad replete with body piercings and made up garishly.\n\nSB/YAW\n\nEND"
