We should adopt a wider and more comprehensive understanding\n\nwhile restoring security.He said issues on human rights and democracy\n\nshould not be ignored while enlarging peace and stability in CICA\n\ngeography, adding democracy and cooperation were the best way to prevent\n\ndisputes.Gul said one of the targets of CICA was to encourage mutual\n\nunderstanding an d respect between different cultures and\n\nreligions.Chinese State Councilor Dai Bingguo attended the meeting as the\n\nspecial representative of Chinese President Hu Jintao.Dai, addressing the\n\nopening session of the summit, said it is important to make full use of\n\nthe CICA and other regional mechanisms of cooperation, which serves the\n\ninterests and meets needs of all countries.Dai said CICA members should\n\nfocus on the post-financial-crisis era, increase trust and\n\ncoordination.Addressing the CICA summit, Ukraine President Viktor\n\nYanukovych said he introduced to the parliament last week the bill on\n\nfoundations of domestic and foreign policy that provides active and\n\nconstructive participation of Ukraine in building mutual trust between\n\nstates and overcoming traditional and new security threats.Yanukovych said\n\nin order to achieve that, all the prerequisites were created, the main of\n\nwhich is internal political stability. \" New political leadership\n\ninitiated a program of systemi c reforms aimed at fighting poverty and\n\neconomic growth. It will allow Ukraine to actively contribute to global\n\nefforts to combat common challenges.\"\"Ukraine, being an observer, highly\n\nappreciates the opportunity of cooperation within the CICA. I would like\n\nto emphasize that Ukraine is your good neighbor, friend and reliable\n\npartner.

These operations backfired on his country,\n\nand his wars increased terrorism in the world as the United States fought\n\nagainst it.\n\nHas the situation changed with Barack Obama? Many people said that the\n\nnational defense strategy was devoid of any talk about the war on\n\nterrorism. Nevertheless, the other principles of the strategy do not\n\nappear to be new. They call for defeating Al-Qa'ida and the extremists who\n\nsupport it in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the entire world, preventing the\n\nproliferation of nuclear and biological weapons (the focus is on Iran and\n\nNorth Korea, rather than Israel), consolidating peace and security in the\n\ngreater Middle East, and spreading democracy and freedom around the world.\n\nI believe that the aforementioned policy was also the policy of the Bush\n\nadministration and that it does not differ much from Bush's defense\n\nstrategy or his speech in Sharm al-Shaykh during the annual conference of\n\nthe World Economic Forum.\n\nIf there is any difference between Presidents Bush and Obama it is that\n\nthe former is a \"cowboy\" who challenged Al-Qa'ida to a showdown and that\n\nthe latter puts on a pair of silk gloves and speaks in accordance with\n\nTheodore Roosevelt's advice.\n\nThe US defense budget reached a record number, $708 billion, and my modest\n\nexperience of this budget says that many defense appropriations are\n\nregistered under other spending items of departments other than the\n\nPentagon and that the aforementioned number means that the budget with its\n\nappendixes and other provisions will reach $1 trillion in a bankrupt\n\ncountry.\n\nIn fact, when the Obama administration presented next year's budget, it\n\nasked for an additional $30 billion for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nPersonally, I do not remember that a year passed since 2001 without the\n\nadministration asking for additional spending on its wars.\n\nIt is known that there are 737 US military bases all over the world in\n\nwhich 200,000 of the original 1.8 million US soldiers are deployed,\n\ntogether with half a million other employees of the US Defense Department.\n\nThe spending in these bases is also in the hundreds of billions.\n\nAll of the above coincided with a large increase in the number and\n\narmament of the Special Forces. Early this year, these forces operated in\n\n60 states and now operate in 77 states from the Far East, the Middle East,\n\nand Africa to Latin America and everywhere. The declared goal is to resist\n\nAl-Qa'ida and terrorist groups, and the chosen weapon for this purpose is\n\npilotless planes. The United Nations called for stopping the use of this\n\nweapon because it kills civilians.\n\nDescribing the job of these forces, the Washington Post said it is a\n\n\"secret war\". The paper added that these forces operate unilaterally or in\n\ncooperation with some other states' forces.\n\nWhen colleague Ghassan Sharbil and I were in Yemen two months ago, we saw\n\nUS soldiers take over from other soldiers who had ended their term of\n\nservice. I remember the scene because I saw two of the leaving soldiers\n\ncarry two sacks of kat attached to their waists. One of them laughingly\n\nspoke to me about his pleasure at chewing kat.\n\nThe Special Forces carry out joint or unilateral operations and train\n\nlocal forces on fighting terrorism. Under the Obama administration, their\n\nbudget increased by 5. 7% to reach $6.3 billion, in addition to emergency\n\nappropriations amounting to $3.5 billion.\n\nDescribing the work of these forces, John Brennan, antiterrorism director\n\nat the White House, said: \"We will not be contented with a response after\n\nthe event (meaning after a terrorist attack). Rather, we will fight\n\nAl-Qa'ida and the extremist groups that are associated with it where they\n\nmake plans and receive training in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia,\n\nand other countries.\" This statement is e xactly of the kind of the\n\nstatement that was made by the administration of Bush Junior. It said: \"We\n\nfight them there so that we will not have to fight them here (in the\n\nstreets of US cities).\"\n\nI see no large difference between the strategies of the former and current\n\nadministrations, except the fact that Obama speaks softly and does not\n\nappear to be enthusiastic about waging preemptive wars for which his\n\npredecessor looked.\n\nI say this and then defend Obama. He is not weak or hesitant, as some of\n\nhis Republican opponents say. Rather, I find him practical, flexible, and\n\ncautious. He avoids confrontation as much as he can. Perhaps, he will have\n\nmore freedom to work after the midterm elections. He has not yet fulfilled\n\nhis promises to the Islamic world, to which we listened in his speech in\n\nCairo one year ago.\n\nAlso, he has not confronted Binyamin Netanyahu on the peace issue or the\n\nsettlement activity in Jerusalem itself, has not closed the Guanta namo\n\nDetention Camp, and has not reached a solution with Iran. Instead, he\n\npursued the previous policy of sanctions.\n\nIn spite of all the aforementioned and other facts, Barack Obama is a\n\nthousand times better than George Bush, and what remains for him to do is\n\nachieve the hopes that are pinned on his presidency.\n\n(Description of Source: London Al-Hayah Online in Arabic -- Website of\n\ninfluential Saudi-owned London pan-Arab daily.

The writer\n\nsays that the journeys to Gaza might seem like deterioration for the\n\nPalestinian national project the priorities of which have narrowed and are\n\nnot restricted to the need to lift the siege imposed on Gaza. However, the\n\nwriter adds, the Western public opinion's sympathy with the Palestinian\n\ncause seems to be the only weapon in this battle with Israel. (600 words)4\n\n.

Despite the Iranian opposition-s\n\ncontinuing efforts to contest the outcome and advance political\n\nliberalization, Ahmadinejad and his allies have largely succeeded in\n\nconsolidating their hold on power by using brute force to repress the\n\nreform movement. Hopes that a popular uprising might topple the regime\n\nhave fizzled.\n\nMeanwhile, the crisis over Iran-s nuclear program is escalating. The\n\nIranian regime continues to defy the international community-s efforts to\n\nprevent it from developing nuclear weapons. The closer Iran gets to\n\ndeveloping a nuclear weapon, the greater the likelihood that Israel, with\n\nor without U.S. help, might attack Iran-s nuclear facilities.\n\nWith diplomacy having failed to curb Iran-s nuclear ambitions, critics of\n\nengagement charge, it is time to resort to coercion before Iran crosses\n\nthe nuclear Rubicon. A rising chorus of voices now forswears engagement\n\nwith Iran-s rulers, insisting that it is time for the regime to go.\n\nBut closing off dialogue with Iran would be a precipitous and dangerous\n\nmist ake. Even fierce adversaries can settle their differences through\n\nnegotiation. The United States and its allies should keep the door open to\n\ndialogue until the 11th hour for four compelling reasons.\n\nFirst, tighter sanctions make sense only as a diplomatic tool, not as a\n\nblunt instrument of coercion. The new sanctions simply are not severe\n\nenough to intimidate Iran into submission, and more restrictive ones would\n\nnot pass muster within the Security Council. Accordingly, if tougher\n\nsanctions prove to be useful, they will do so by confronting Iran with a\n\nunited diplomatic front, thereby encouraging Tehran to make a deal to end\n\nthe country-s isolation. New sanctions are warranted as a complement, not\n\nan alternative, to diplomacy.\n\nSecond, the costs of abandoning diplomacy are so high that continued\n\nengagement makes sense even as Iran refuses to budge. To give up on\n\ndiplomacy is to leave the international community with two ugly options:\n\nliving with a nuclear Iran or carrying out a preventive military strike\n\nagainst Iran-s nuclear installations.\n\nA military strike would likely have worse consequences. Even if a strike\n\nwere an operational success, it would only set back Iran-s nuclear program\n\nby several years, while giving the regime a new incentive to acquire a\n\nnuclear deterrent and build better hidden and defended nuclear facilities.\n\nIn response to an attack, Iran might well seek to obstruct shipping in the\n\nPersian Gulf, potentially triggering oil shortages and soaring prices.\n\nIran could also intensify efforts to fund and arm insurgents in Iraq and\n\nAfghanistan, imperiling both countries. And it could launch attacks on\n\nU.S., European and Israeli targets on a global basis. Such prospects make\n\ncontinued diplomacy nothing short of mandatory.\n\nThe third reason for pursuing dialogue is that factional infighting and\n\npolitical intrigue within the Iranian regime make for considerable\n\npolitical fluidity. Admittedly, turmoil in Tehran brings inconstancy to\n\nIran-s foreign policy, but internal jockeying for power also means that a\n\ncoalition alignment favoring a negotiated settlement just might fall into\n\nplace.\n\nFinally, even as stalemate continues on Iran-s uranium enrichment,\n\ncontinued engagement may offer a roundabout means of arriving at a bargain\n\non the nuclear issue. Dialogue with the United States could focus on\n\nareas, such as Iraq and Afghanistan, where the two parties share a measure\n\nof common ground. Joint efforts to combat drug trafficking in Afghanistan,\n\nfor example, could help dilute the mutual antagonism and distrust that\n\ncontribute to blockage on the nuclear front. Iran remains several years\n\naway from mastering the technology needed to build nuclear weapons, which\n\nprovides time to search for such diplomatic openings.\n\nWith Iran having spurned Obama-s offers of compromise, it is tempting for\n\nthe U.S. administration to turn its back on dialogue. But the stakes are\n\ntoo high to abandon engagement. Even with new sanctions in the offing,\n\ndialogue still offers the best prospect for peacefully resolving what may\n\nbe the world-s most dangerous dispute.\n\nCharles A.

Thus, Rosatom is\n\nnow ready to not only build nuclear power plants abroad, but to fund their\n\nconstruction. Corresponding projects are planned in Armenia and Turkey.\n\nFor instance, Russia is ready to fund about 40 per cent of the\n\nconstruction of a nuclear power plant in Armenia.

Russia's new position runs\n\ncontrary to Iran's strategic interests, he noted. It is Iran's strategy to\n\ncounter U.S. unilateralism and to work for a multi-polar, power-sharin g\n\nglobal system, he said. Iranian officials formerly believed that Russia\n\napproved of this strategy, but Russian officials then began following U.S.\n\npolicies, and this is contrary to Iran's strategic interests, he added.\n\nMedvedev's remarks have triggered a wave of criticism in political circles\n\nin Iran.
