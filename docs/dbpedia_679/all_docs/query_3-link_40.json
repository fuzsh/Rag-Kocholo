        "text": "With Darren Aronofsky serving as Jury President, the International Jury will award the Golden Bear and Silver Bears of the 2015 Berlinale Competition.\n\nThe other members of the International Jury will be Daniel Brühl, Bong Joon-ho, Martha De Laurentiis, Claudia Llosa, Audrey Tautou and Matthew Weiner.\n\nDarren Aronofsky, Jury President, USA\n\nBorn and raised in Brooklyn, Darren Aronofsky celebrated his directorial debut in 1998 with the film π, which won Best Director at the Sundance Film Festival and Best Script at the Independent Spirit Awards. He presented the cinematic adaptation Requiem for a Dream at the Cannes Film Festival in 2000, and the cult film The Fountain at the Venice Film Festival in 2006. His film The Wrestler won the Golden Lion at Venice in 2008, which marked the sensational comeback of actor Mickey Rourke. Black Swan, starring Natalie Portman, was nominated for Best Director at the Academy Awards, the Golden Globes, the Director's Guild of America Awards and the British Academy Film Awards in 2011. His most recent work, the visually sweeping epos Noah starring Russell Crowe, was released in 2014.\n\nDaniel Brühl, Germany\n\nDaniel Brühl is one of a handful of German movie stars who have also established a successful international career. Following his distinction with the German Film Award for Das weiße Rauschen, Vaya con Dios and Nichts bereuen in 2002, he celebrated his breakthrough in 2003 with Good Bye, Lenin!, which screened in Competition at the Berlinale. For that role, Daniel Brühl received the European Film Award as well as another German Film Award. His international work has included roles in Anton Corbijn's A Most Wanted Man, Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds, Bill Condon's The Fifth Estate and Michael Winterbottom's The Face of an Angel. Following various productions in Germany, Spain, France and the US, he was recently nominated for numerous awards, including a Golden Globe Award, for his work in Ron Howard's Rush. His most recent role was alongside Helen Mirren in Simon Curtis's Woman in Gold.\n\nBong Joon-ho, South Korea\n\nBorn in 1969 in Seoul, South Korea, Bong Joon-ho studied sociology before graduating from the Korean Academy of Film Arts (KAFA). He initially worked as a screenwriter and director’s assistant while also making many short films of his own. His feature film debut Barking Dogs Never Bite was released in cinemas in 2000. His film Memories of Murder was screened at the San Sebastián film festival, among others, and won numerous awards. In 2006, following its world premiere in the Quinzane des Réalisateurs in Cannes, The Host would go on to become the biggest box office hit ever in South Korea. Bong Joon-ho was invited to Cannes once again in 2009 for Mother, this time in the section Un Certain Regard. His English language film debut Snowpiercer, featuring Chris Evans, Tilda Swinton and John Hurt, was a selection in the 2014 Berlinale Forum programme.\n\nMartha De Laurentiis, USA\n\nMartha De Laurentiis and her husband Dino founded their production firm - today known as the De Laurentiis Company - in 1980. Since then it has been responsible for over 40 feature films and television series, including Stephen King’s directorial debut Maximum Overdrive, The Bedroom Window by Curtis Hanson, Michael Cimino’s Desperate Hours, Breakdown and U-571 by Jonathan Mostow and Brett Ratner’s Red Dragon. It produced Ridley Scott’s film adaptation of Hannibal, which screened out of competition at the Berlinale in 2001. De Laurentiis Company is also an executive producer of the Hannibal television series, which stars Mads Mikkelsen and has entered its third season in the US. At the 2014 festival, Martha De Laurentiis talked about the Hannibal series at Berlinale Talents.\n\nClaudia Llosa, Peru\n\nPeruvian native Claudia Llosa studied Communication Studies in Lima and later scriptwriting at the Escuela TAI in Madrid. She began her career in advertising before starting her own film production company. Her first feature film Madeinusa was released in 2006. Three years later, the WCF-funded film The Milk of Sorrow was a selection in the Berlinale Competition programme and went on to win the Golden Bear and the FIPRESCI Award. The film was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. In 2012, her short film Loxoro was a selection in the Berlinale Shorts programme and won the Teddy Award. Her English-language film debut Aloft, starring Jennifer Connelly, Mélanie Laurent and Cillian Murphy, screened in Competition in 2014 and Sundance Spotlight 2015.\n\nAudrey Tautou, France\n\nAudrey Tautou's feature film debut - in the comedy Venus Beauty Institute - garnered her a César Award. Her international breakthrough came in 2001, when she starred in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's Amélie and was nominated for the European Film Award, as well as for another César and a BAFTA in 2002. Other films in her repertoire include Cédric Klapisch's acclaimed L'Auberge Espagnole trilogy, Not on the Lips by Alain Resnais, Salvadori's Priceless, Coco Before Chanel, and international productions such as The Da Vinci Code and Stephen Frears' Dirty Pretty Things. Most recently, the French actress worked with Claude Miller (Thérèse Desqueyroux) and Michel Gondry (Mood Indigo).\n\nMatthew Weiner, USA\n\nSince 2007, Matthew Weiner has been the creator, executive producer and writer of the successful and critically acclaimed television series Mad Men, whose seventh and last season is currently running in the US. To date, he has received nine Emmys, two BAFTAS, three Golden Globes, numerous WGA awards and many other distinctions recognising his work on the series. As a director, he has been nominated twice by the DGA for his work behind the camera. Are You Here, starring Owen Wilson and Amy Poehler, marks his feature film debut as a writer, director and producer. Weiner's other credits as a writer include the television series Becker, The Naked Truth, and The Sopranos - for which he was also an executive producer.\n\nThe International Jury presents the following awards:\n\nGolden Bear for Best Film (awarded to the film’s producer)\n\nSilver Bear Grand Jury Prize\n\nSilver Bear Alfred Bauer Prize for a feature film that opens new perspectives\n\nSilver Bear for Best Director\n\nSilver Bear for Best Actress\n\nSilver Bear for Best Actor\n\nSilver Bear for Best Script\n\nSilver Bear for Outstanding Artistic Contribution in the categories camera, editing, music, score, costume or set design\n\nJaideep Sahni’s Master Class at Film Writers’ Association, Mumbai: 15 years in 150 minutes\n\nBumping into Rajashree, urf (alias) Raju (that is how she likes to be known), a Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) alumnus and novelist, at Mumbai’s Linking Road, on Thursday evening, I told her I was considering attending the Film Writers’ Association’s Master Class by popular film-writer Jaideep Sahni, but the Facebook listing said it was only for members of the FWA. An Executive Committee member of the FWA, Convener of their Events Committee and the Moderator of the upcoming Master Class, Rajashree replied, “You can come, since you are a journalist, but only if you guarantee that you will write about it.” The demand was a deterrent, because I feel nobody should make such demands of journalists. They border on the unethical. I was with my friend Irfan (we were returning from a poetry session where I was welcome without any pre-condition, though I am not a poet) who had gifted me a book some years ago, a book that would find reference on Saturday afternoon in Jaideep’s Master Class. I introduced Irfan to her, we exchanged some pleasantries and as we parted company, I told Raju I would think about her offer and only confirm on Friday. I did, and headed for the venue on Saturday afternoon.\n\nUnexpected delays along the way meant that I reached at 2 pm for an event scheduled to start at 1.30. This was my first visit to the FWA’s office, located off Link Road, north of my own residence in Bandra, some 70-90 minutes away. Luckily, the session started only at 2.20. Unluckily, the number of attendees was twice the capacity of the venue. All seats were already taken and a good 50 persons were standing when I arrived, a number that was growing by the minute. Dreading the prospect of having to stand for three hours, and being unable to get a good view of the dais from where I found place to stand, I sent a text message to Raju, requesting her to try and find me a chair. There was no reply. She passed by me a few minutes later, with a mere nod. I was now resigned to my fate. Chak De India, written by Jaideep, was being shown on a DVD screen, and the projection was halted when Jaideep was escorted to the dais.\n\nManisha Korde, Joint Secretary FWA welcomed Jaideep and Rajashree, who was seated on his left. After brief introductions, Jaideep began his PowerPoint Presentation. The Master Class was held in three segments: Jaideep’s PPP, Raju’s questions and a couple of questions from the audience. Altogether, the session lasted for about two-and-a-half hours, and was studded with anecdotes from the 15 year writing career of Jaideep Sahni. Many thanks to the FWA for serving tea while the session was on, and a samosa after it got over. It also gave me an opportunity to meet acquaintances, like writers Jalees Sherwani (also a renowned poet, FWA President) Kamlesh Pandey (General Secretary), Anjum Rajabali (Executive Committee member) and Sridhar Raghavan (my colleague at Sterling group of magazines where I used to edit TV&Video World), and to see a picture of venerated Urdu writer of the 1940s, Saadat Hasan Manto on the office wall, with his thick, bushy hair, and a curl across his forehead. My thanks to the kindly soul who allowed me to sit in his chair for the last hour of the programme, when my legs were getting numb after standing for 120 minutes.\n\nJaideep impressed with his candid, easy-flowing speech, and his self-effacing style, even as he analysed why he felt certain components he, and the teams he worked with, put together in six of his films. The PPP did not include Jungle, his first foray into the Mumbai film industry, made by Ramgopal Varma, and Aaja Nachle, a Yashraj Films production, the house for whom he wrote three more films: Bunty Aur Babli, Rocket Singh: Salesman of the Year and Shuddh Desi Romance. Sahni’s output so far includes four films for Yashraj (run by Aditya Chopra), two for Varma (Company was the other), one which he made in Delhi with help from friends and was also Creative Producer of, and one produced by superstar ShahRukh Khan (Chak De India). He has also written lyrics in a few other films.\n\nNow to the book that Irfan gifted me. It was the screenplay of Richard Attenborough’s film, Gandhi, by John Briley. Briley is not known to be prolific, but the book is a masterpiece. I was so taken-up with it, that when I went to conduct a class on script-writing across three media--radio, television and film--at the Symbiosis Institute of Media and Communication in Pune, some six years ago, I used a couple of scenes from this screenplay as the base for the students to develop. Therefore, it came as a pleasant surprise and belated validation that Jaideep got interested in screenplay writing after he read this very book. An engineering graduate from small town Bidar (in the southern state of Karnataka), he worked in IT for a while, then joined advertising and then wrote lyrics for a band called Euphoria. “Listening to so many Hindi film songs, I began to feel that they just rotated some 50-100 words around to churn out new songs. Now, this can even be done with computer software, so I actually wrote a programme that could transpose words and create new songs every time, using the same words in different permutations.”\n\nInspiration for his film stories came from family memories (Khosla Ka Ghosla), research on the modus operandi of criminal gangs and their recruitment methods (Company), college days in a pit-stop town called Bidar (Bunty Aur Babli), a small item in a newspaper (Chak De India), friends trapped in the marketing rat race of the 21st century (Rocket Singh) and the new generation of 20 somethings, who live and work in metro cities, on their own, far away from their families, and have their own attitudes to morals and ethics (Shuddh Desi Romance). He strongly believes in workshops before shooting begins, and goes back every night after the readings to improve on the script, discovering that some actor has brought out an element that he could not have thought of. But he does not do detailed characterisation, except for one film, where he had to, because there were so many characters (Chak De India, about an Indian national women’s hockey team and its male coach).\n\nI have seen Jungle, half of Khosla Ka Ghosla on TV, half of Company on TV, Bunty Aur Babli, Chak De India and Aaja Nachle. Jungle was slightly disappointing, Bunty Aur Babli was partly formulaic (Jaideep acknowledges that the item song and the portion leading to it was inserted on the producer’s insistence), Aaja Nachle was under-rated. Khosla Ka Ghosla is the film closest to his heart because he went back from Mumbai to home-town Delhi, self-respect bruised, and decided to make one last film before calling it quits. It took him a long time to get it completed and released. But when it hit the screens, it became the talk of the country. Another work of sheer passion was Chak De India. He was driven to tears at the plight of the Indian women’s hockey team, and made it his mission to get them some respect, and sponsorship for their clothes and kits. Shooting began only when all the actresses had learnt play hockey at a level that could give any state team in India a run for its money, an exercise undertaken just to make sure that the long-shot sport, with so many players running at the same time, appeared realistic on screen.\n\nMaking a strong case for self-respect, Jaideep advised aspiring writers not to lick the boots of producers and directors, “Never indulge in the ‘Sir-Sir’ culture. Let your page do the talking for you. If you find something objectionable, speak up.” It is worth mentioning here that the writer duo Salim-Javed (Sholay, Deewar, Don, among other block-busters) were the first to ensure that writers were paid very well, treated very well and given credit on par with directors. S-J arrived on the scene around 1968, the year Jaideep was born! They have split now, with Salim doing little or no writing and Javed writing only songs. In every interview, the duo has spoken of the prevalent socio-economic conditions as the milieu which gave rise to their characters and scripts. Sahni expressed the same point of view and detailed the circumstances and incidents that gave birth to his stories. He also quotes lyricist-writer-director Gulzar on two or three occasions. (One song in Bunty Aur Babli, ‘Chhote chhote shehron se’, written by Gulzar, sounds so much like the whole film in a capsule)!\n\nA very good orator, Jaideep could manage to hold your attention in spite of a constant monotone. His command over both Hindi and English is amazing, expect for the occasional catch word, ‘yaar’, and the Punjabi way of combining the pronoun ‘aap’ with the verb ‘ho’, whereas it should be aap+haen. Incidentally, he said that some producers and directors often commented that he did not know how to write dialogue, because he wrote the way people spoke in real life, as against the stilted, unrealistic manner in which they talk in Hindi movies.\n\nBack in 2010, Jaideep enumerated the five stages in his life that led him to become a screen-writer, and they appeared in a newspaper as\n\n5 steps to being a screenwriter: Jaideep Sahni\n\nJayeeta Mazumder, Hindustan Times, Mumbai | Updated: Jul 17, 2010 02:01 IST\n\nWhat we heard and saw on Saturday, 30 January 2015, was a personal and much more elaborate presentation, and, one must add, with almost no groping or fumbling at all, except for a brief contemplative second, every time, before he answered Rajashree’s questions.\n\nJaideep Sahni’s filmography, as writer\n\n2013 Shuddh Desi Romance (Pure Indian Romance) (written by)\n\n2009 Rocket Singh: Salesman of the Year (written by)\n\n2007 Aaja Nachle (Let’s Dance) (screenplay & dialogue)\n\n2007 Chakde!

India\n\nMy humble comments and suggestions\n\n1.Hold these Master Classes at bigger venues. Yes, cost will be a factor, but you should find a way.\n\n2.Hold them at 3-5.30 pm. Most people in Mumbai have lunch at 1.30, and they have to travel great distances to reach the venue, in the mad Mumbai traffic, so starting at 1.30 or even 2 is not a good idea.\n\n3.I know there was an FWA meeting scheduled that day immediately after the Master Class, but that should not prevent you from putting the audience’s questions to the Master Classer. I presume there must have been 50 questions forwarded, on paper, as were the instructions, of which only two were answered.\n\n4.Try and convince speakers to dwell on the ‘process’ a bit. True, the experiences of Jaideep were lessons in themselves. A dash of the writing process would have added much more weight, undoubtedly. To manage time, the speakers could dwell on fewer examples than the seven films that Jaideep covered in detail. Yes, I realise that one cannot lay down strict guidelines for speakers, who, I am sure, come and speak pro bono, but surely a suggestion can be made, based on the time factor and the nature of the audience.\n\n5.Tea and a samosa were most welcome. On the tea, maybe half-a-cup would be much more appreciated than a quarter cup. On the samosa, it was so piping hot that my lips actually got scalded when I unsuspectingly bit into it (having skipped lunch to try and reach on time, I was really hungry by 5.30 pm) and I had to then wait for a full 12 minutes for it to cool before I could bite into it again. Delightful, nevertheless.\n\n6.Welcome the media, without any stipulation. Every media-person might not give such extensive coverage as what you have read here, and some might not write at all. That is an occupational hazard. Also, every media attendee will cost you tea and a samosa. Surely that is not too much of an investment into a worthy cause. (Tongue-in-cheek, samosa in mouth)!\n\nInterview with Lirio Ferreira, director of Blue Blood - opening film of Berlinale Panorama 2015\n\nLirio Ferreira was born in Recife in 1965. He started directing films while studying journalism. His first feature Baile Perfumado premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in 1997, followed by Árido movie (2005) and many documentaries that have won numerous prizes in Brazil and beyond. Blue blood is his third feature film, opening this year’s Berlinale Panorama.\n\nHow did get the inspiration to do Blue Blood? Did your career so far, mainly in documentary filmmaking, influence your idea?\n\nThis film can be a documentary and fiction, an action and thriller film at the same time. There are so many interpretations because of the epic, mythological background of the story. I made two documentaries before, both for Brazilian musicians and one of them inspired the soundtrack of Blue Blood - this is a real connection between my work, if you like.\n\nWhy did you decide to make your protagonist a circus performer? Does the circus fascinate you? (I remember that as a kid I was going to the circus a lot and it was a fantastic form of entertainment, which is kind of lost nowadays. With the film I felt like being six again.)\n\nI share your feeling exactly. I always imagine circus with lot of physical performances, not only animals or jongleurs as it has ended up being today. But also cinema itself is going through a transition, today even faster. My film is probably one of the last shot in 35 mm as the digital era is progressing. This is how I see the connection between cinema and circus - they both have change and no one could really expect or foresee their future.\n\nDo you see the film industry as a circus?\n\nAs I said, we cant know what we will see in five years time. There are so many ups and downs. But I like a metaphor Tarantino used, that since we don't use film anymore, cinema is gone. Well, or at least cannot be the same, ever.\n\nWhy did you choose the title “Blue blood” in particular?\n\nI would like to tell you all the possibilities and you can pick your favourite. Blue is for the sea - the deeper you dive the more blue you get; the inhabitants of the island and the circus group are both closed societies and their blood is mixing remaining in the same always place; also, when the Africans went to Brazil and brought their religion and traditions, there was the god of the sea. The mother in the film is religious and there is a scene where they dance on the beach and there is a blue statue of the god, looking at the open sea. People still believe at its powers.\n\nYou did very interesting camera work. Especially because the film begins in black and white and then it swifts to colour. Is there a specific intention each time, something you really wanted to show?\n\nFirst, I wanted to make some sort of division between the real and the fictitious. So the black and white part is somehow like taken from the past and then we get transferred to reality, to the ‘now’. But also, there is a film from Eisenstein, Ivan the terrible, that is all black and white and then there is a dancing scene at the end, the only in colour. This film is really important and has impacted a lot my filmmaking.\n\nAlthough the film depicts life in contemporary Brazil, there is a lot of traditional motives - in people’s lifestyle, in the music choices you've made - would you consider Brazil a country with strong traditional spirit that doesn't appear in contemporary Brazilian cinema?\n\nIn the film itself, there is no specific timeframe, you lose track of time. You also don't know how long the circus is going to stay for example. There is also the old man that is a mysterious character, appearing throughout the story and also in the end, mixing up with the characters as they grow up and evolve. In addition, the island where the story takes place is cut-off and the modernity needs more time to arrive.\n\nNot only in Brazil, but in many countries it is still very common for parents to make choices for their children, even if its not for the best - just like Pedro’s mother did for him in order to protect him. Does this still exist in Brazil?\n\nYeah, it happens sometimes, its unavoidable. But, Pedro’s mother specifically was driven by the fact that in the island they had more boys than girls - so she decided to keep her safe and protected and send the boy away.\n\nPedro has evolved into the ultimate macho young man who finds in his sexual adventures a kind of escape from ‘serious life’. Did you see it that way when creating his character?\n\nThe island itself is sort of an aphrodisiac. It attracts tourists to come and explore this naturally erotic atmosphere. The main character could had been a contortionist for example, but I decided to make him a “cannon-man” , which implies some kind of sexual attraction. Also, as he was separated from his sister as a child, without knowing the answer, he used his sexuality as a way of understanding and exploring the world; and this of course adds some potential to the romantic part of the film.\n\nWhich was the most challenging scene to shoot? The one where Pedro and his mother stay alone and talk about the past perhaps?\n\nYes, absolutely - it was one of the most difficult ones. It was a very intense day in the shooting process. Now, from the physical point of view, I would say that the scene where Pedro and his sister are swimming and we had to dive all together in order to shoot it under the water was quite risky for all of us. We shot at 22 meters depth.\n\nJustin Kelly - I am Michael, 2015 US - Interview\n\nby Martin I. Petrov\n\nJustin Kelly is an American writer and director, who has mainly directed music videos before entering the film industry with several short films. I am Michael is his first feature film that premiered at this year’s Sundance Film Festival and it was part of the Berlinale Panorama. The film tells the story of a gay activist and writer, who suddenly turned to religion, developing a theory against homosexuality and is starring James Franco, Zachary Quinto and Emma Roberts.\n\nWhat intrigued you most about Michael’s story in order to make a film about it?\n\nWell actually it all started with Gus Van Sant, who first read the story when it got published at the New York Times. He found it very inspiring and he suggested it. We've all seen the stories about closeted pastors that come out eventually but this was so unique as it was exactly the opposite. Gus also suggested James (Franco) for the part of Michael.\n\nJames Franco is extremely comfortable playing a gay character. Did you do any preparations in terms of how he should approach it?\n\nJames has played a gay character before, but I think here he felt it from the first moment as he liked the script very much. I think everyone was really excited about the film since the very beginning and that’s why it worked out pretty well. But with James, I really didn't have to explain a lot, he was picking up everything really quickly; there were times for example telling him to stand at the bar and undress with his eyes the guy he was observing and he was immediately responding from the first take.\n\nDid you strictly follow a script or most of it just came together after the shooting process was completed?\n\nWell, it was a bit of both actually. I reworked the script many times, because for example at some point I came to the realisation that the most important part is to portray their (Michael and Bennet’s) emotional breakdown and I started interviewing more people, doing more research. But, at the same time we had a tight schedule with 19 days of filming in total, which didn’t allow us a lot of flexibility. So if we were on a spot we were completing all the scenes that were meant to be shot there before moving along to the next place - so, yeah, we were jumping a bit back and forth and I couldn't always combine scenes that I wanted to.\n\nHow was it working with James and Zachary?\n\nI was lucky to work with such accomplished actors, they were both great. There were times that they had to switch totally their mood and emotions for the next scene, having just 10-15 minutes in-between to sit down and talk it through before moving ahead. We also changed a lot of things on the way - when during the rehearsal something didn't feel right we would just scratch it out or change so that it could fit better to the actors and the scene.\n\nConsidering the fact that most of the gay people believe there isn't a perfect homosexual relationship and that it’s very hard to maintain one, do you think that this thought might have been one of Michael’s incentives to make a decision and turn into religion leaving his past as a gay activist behind?\n\nOh, that’s tricky. There a lot of theories coming up all the time and I always feel conflicted. This is somehow connected to Michael’s queer theory that there isn't such thing as gay identity; that it doesn't matter if you're born gay and you should reject it; and this on the other hand can be used by a certain government that is against homosexuality, which could turn and say “hey, the Americans promote that there is no such thing as homosexual identity” so if you ‘choose’ it, you just decide, in their case, to die.\n\nBut on the other hand I don't believe that Michael and Bennett saw their relationship as problematic. They were together for ten years and everyone surrounding them described them as the dream couple - madly in love, they even shared a wallet!\n\nIn the end of the film, Michael calls Bennett, and although he persists on having made the right choice, there is still some doubt in his voice. Do you think that after so many years of giving up his nature for faith, the first is still alive deep down?\n\nIt is interesting because even six months before the filming process started, I made big changes to the script. And this is because when I remember talking to him and he was so anti-gay and convinced about doing the right thing; then the next conversation we had, he was somehow feeling guilty, he was reaching out to some of his Buddhist gay friends apologising for his behaviour. Also I could see something shifting in him every time I was going back to ask about his past. When I first met him he appeared as a proper Christian priest with his bible and everything; then we went for a coffee and when I started talking about Bennett and the dog they owned together, his demeanour totally changed, he suddenly became more relaxed, more free. So thats why I added the last scene with the phone call, where Michael seems to still have feelings and doubt can be sensed in his voice.\n\nDid you manage to have a conversation with Michael’s wife? What were her thoughts, is she concerned at all that he might change his mind and face his past again?\n\nNo, she is not afraid at all actually; It sounds crazy, but it wouldn't make any difference to her if he was a former drug-addict or an alcoholic. She believes he was cleansed after he believed in God and he was reborn. Also, since their love is real and their sex life is real, there aren't any serious concerns. However, I am aware of many other cases where gay men have started a straight relationship and after a while their partners where cheating on them with other men as they didn't feel like having a healthy relationship. Michael is such an extremist though, so I wouldn't be surprised if he’s never been or will never be with a man again - he’s admitted that for a long time in the beginning he had the urge to give in to his homosexual nature again but he kept surpassing it.\n\nMany films have been made lately on homosexuality, sexual liberation etc. Do you think that this is just a trend of our time or we can actually speak of a movement in world cinema?\n\nIt’s hard to say, but with each passing year homosexuality becomes more an more acceptable. It’s even seen in the industry with guys like James playing gay parts - for him the interesting story or character comes first and his sexuality is secondary. I hope that more people will grab on that soon, because it’s really genuine and interesting.\n\nSpeaking of liberation, there are still some regions in the US that do not tolerate homosexuality in a very open way. Do you think that your film could potentially contribute towards a change?\n\nI sense that we’ve started going for the non-judgemental approach. It depends on the point of view, of course, but I think that people would see the film and wether they like it not - for example some people at a Q & A the other day told me that they didn't like it cause Michael didn't go back to gay - it is always essential to have people on both sides, as this will keep the conversation going.\n\nThe 21st annual Sedona International Film Festival will celebrate the 100th birthday of film icon and former Sedona resident Orson Welles with screenings of Citizen Kane, Othello, Touch of Evil, Falstaff - Chimes at Midnight, several documentaries about his life and career – with post-film Q&As hosted by his daughter, Beatrice – and a discussion about his final, unfinished film, The Other Side of the Wind, from Feb. 21-March 1 at screening venues throughout Sedona.\n\nDocumentaries include the controversial, The Battle Over Citizen Kane, and Magician: The Astonishing Life and Work of Orson Welles.\n\nBeatrice, who lives part-time in Sedona, has helped Festival organizers pull together not only the feature films to be screened but panels and speakers for each screening including critic Jeffrey Lyons, The Other Side of the Wind producer Filip Jan Rymsza, cameraman Mike Ferris, actors Pat McMahon and Peter Jason; Josh Karp, the author of the upcoming book, “Orson Wells’ Last Movie: The Making of the Other Side of the Wind;” Ray Kelly, who is the driving force behind Wellesnet, the leading online source about Welles life and career, and other special guests.\n\nThe 2015 edition of the Sedona International Film Festival features 160 films from around the world, workshops, panel discussions and special events. The full schedule can be found at http://www.sedonafilmfestival.org.\n\nWelles lived in Sedona from 1977 to 1979, eventually moving to California to accommodate a hectic work schedule. His daughter, Beatrice, who manages Welles’ estate, is planning to write a book about her father, “whom I worship,” she said. “When I talk about my father, I wear two hats: I look at him as he was in my mind and that’s a separate person from my father. It’s impossible to think of Daddy as the genius who did all that he achieved.”\n\nBeatrice is quick to point out that 2015 is not only her father’s 100th birthday, but the 30th anniversary of his death. Welles’ ashes are buried at Spanish Villa in Ronda, Spain at the country house of retired bullfighter, Antonio Ordonez, where the American filmmaker spent vacations.\n\n“Spain is very emotional for me because it was very special for my father,” Beatrice said.\n\nAlthough she did not have a hand in selecting the documentaries – and does not necessarily like or agree with content in Magician: The Astonishing Life and Work of Orson Welles– she described The Battle Over Citizen Kane, originally a made-for-TV special by WGBH in Boston, as “an incredibly interesting documentary that you should watch first and then watch the movie because you will know what happened behind the scenes. They almost burned that negative.”\n\nSelecting Citizen Kane, though, was a no-brainer. “Every time I see that film there’s something that I hadn’t seen before,” she said. “It is truly a remarkable film.”\n\nShe said Othello, which won the Palme D’Or at the 1952 Cannes Film Festival, has a special place in her heart because of what it meant to her father. “When it premiered at Cannes, there was a four-to-five minute standing ovation. Nothing in my life could top that.”\n\nTouch of Evil (1958, Welles, Charlton Heston, Janet Leigh) has been restored and includes 14 minutes that producers removed from the original film after Welles was taken off as director. “They found notes on each scene that was cut and put it together with the ending he originally wrote,” Beatrice said.\n\nShe said that Falstaff -- Chimes at Midnight (1965, Welles, Jeanne Moreau, Margaret Rutherford) “was the movie my father wanted to be remembered by.” Until recently, she said the film had only been available on the black market. “Being able to show it is a very rare occurrence.”\n\nSedona International Film Festival films will run all day beginning Saturday, Feb. 21 on four screens at Sedona Harkins 6, 2081 W. Highway 89A; the Mary D. Fisher Theater, 2030 W. Highway 89A, and the Sedona Performing Arts Center at Sedona Red Rock High School, 995 Upper Red Rock Loop Road.\n\nPlatinum All-Access Passes are $990; Gold Priority Passes, $490; 20-ticket packages, $210; 10-ticket packages, $105. Full-time students can get the 10-ticket package for $85. Individual film tickets go on sale to the general public on Feb. 16.\n\nPackages, other than for full-time students, are available online at www.sedonafilmfestival.org or through the Festival Box office at (928) 282-1177. Student packages must be purchased through the Box Office and student ID’s are required. For more information, visit www.sedonafilmfestival.org."
