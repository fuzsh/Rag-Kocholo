To address this, the Housing Trust has done two things: 1) we are building our own construction team and 2) we will use of modular housing to develop housing opportunities for healthcare workers across the province. Modular develop can be faster because development is not paused by the weather, and overall its more eco-friendly. The Housing Trust looks forward to the future of affordable housing, hoping to inspire other developments facing similar capacity challenges. #ConstructionIndustry #AffordableHousing #ModularHousingProgram https://lnkd.in/eEcDeK8Q\n\n27\n\n\"This is a familiar kind of kludge: burdening new housing with a hundred policy objectives. It has costs. Buildings will end up smaller and more expensive. The city‚Äôs own analysis finds that 30-unit buildings might just barely make economic sense, and only if they are sold as condos. Translate this into architecture and built form, and this model will generate a patchwork of small, cheaply constructed buildings with awkward side yards. At best. At worst, it will generate paperwork until the city decides to try again.\" https://lnkd.in/gUVp_jZF Victoria did this, despite advice from builders. Globe editorial said: \"city then piled on numerous rules incl building height, parking & added costs. It‚Äôs akin to opening a door & immediately bolting it shut.\" Little accountability for bad policy. https://lnkd.in/gwfi4KbD\n\n1 Comment\n\nAddressing the Affordable Housing Crisis in Alberta At Praxijile, we recognize that significant efforts are being made to address the affordable housing crisis in Alberta and across Canada. However, the challenges are complex and multifaceted, including funding gaps, infrastructure deficiencies, high construction costs, regulatory barriers, and the financialization of housing. To truly make a difference, we need an all-hands-on-deck approach. This means engaging private developers, financial institutions, community organizations, and all levels of government. Praxijile is committed to ensuring that this key challenge remains a trending issue. We believe that through coordinated efforts, innovative solutions, and community involvement, we can create sustainable and equitable housing solutions for all Canadians. #AffordableHousing #SeniorsHousing #SupportiveLiving #HousingCrisis #PraxijileSolutions #PublicPrivatePartnerships #CommunityInvolvement #HousingInnovation #SustainableHousing #AllHandsOnDeck\n\n8\n\nTrending in #CHBAHighlights ‚¨áÔ∏è Canadian buildings of 3 of more storeys require two exits, a rule that has long restricted the types of housing that can be built. Support for single-stair buildings is growing, as they can allow for more family-friendly housing. https://lnkd.in/gUcRwj_X CHBA‚Äôs Technical Research Committee is heavily engaged in a national code change request to permit single exits in mid-rise multi-unit buildings up to 6 storeys. Given Canada‚Äôs chronic lack of supply and affordability challenges, CHBA supports this change as it has the potential to lower construction costs, allow for greater design flexibility, and increase housing supply by making the construction of ‚Äúmissing middle‚Äù housing more feasible.

The current OBC allows for an opening between floors limited to not more than 10m2 in area, but this will be removed in the new code. An opening for an escalator and moving walkways will remain, but at least one level of a stair will need to be fire separated or an alternative solution submitted. #OntarioBuildingCode #BuildingCodeChanges #OfficeSpaces #FireSafety Vortex Fire\n\n39\n\n2 Comments\n\nFrom concept to construction, affordable homes need to be built faster. This means: ¬∑ Bringing down the costs to build new homes, ¬∑ Helping cities make it easier to build homes at a faster pace, ¬∑ Changing the way Canadian homebuilders manufacture homes, and ¬∑ Growing the workforce to ensure we get the job done. With these actions, the federal government is helping build the homes Canada needs.

Single-stair buildings represent a promising housing type that could quickly flourish with the right support. This topic is explored in today's The Globe and Mail, with details on BC's intentions to update building rules to unlock the potential of gentle density homes. It highlights the need to relax the requirement for multi-unit residential buildings in Canada over two storeys to have two separate exit staircases. Small Housing's recent Case Study report delves into this very topic, showcasing the emerging movement across Canada to amend the National Building Code for single-egress residential buildings. Leading this movement are LGA Architectural Partners and David Hine, advocating for the allowance of single-egress buildings up to six storeys above grade. At Small Housing, we‚Äôre keenly observing this space. Greater design flexibility could be pivotal in making gentle density housing projects financially viable.

Because it looks like it in some provinces Firstly, what was the concept behind the Housing Accelerator Fund: Create more homes The Fund used 2 systems to accomplish this - Provide $Billions$ directly to Cities & Towns to build subsidized housing for social purposes: poor people who need homes - In order to get this money the Cites & Towns had to change Zoning Rules & drastically cut Red Tape to allow greater density on the same lots Allow 4 to 6 Units on a Single Family Lot Even more on land directly adjacent to Public Transit Cities & Towns mainly agreed because it was important to expand critical socialized housing for people in need Many City Councils passed \"Up-Zoning\" allowing for more density The Housing Accelerator Fund committed to $Billions$ in spending Then something truly EVIL happened Many Cities radically increased Development Fees & other fees attached to New Builds like Park expansions Even with greater density ALL NEW BUILDING COSTS INCREASED And not by a little: some rose 40%, 25%, 60% Why the hell would cities do this? - They just keep spending so addicted to more taxes - It's a secret way to reverse the density increase Wait Ron, why would cities lie about wanting more density That answer is pure politics City Councils are usually elected by tiny (20%) voter turnouts, those voters are mainly Boomers who NEVER want their neighborhoods to become more dense Cities found a way to take the Accelerator money & also DECELERATE building new homes to sell - Ron Call Butler Mortgage TODAY for more information and insight into this ever-changing market!

Next, the amendment will be considered at an upcoming City Council meeting. As Senior Technical Lead at HousingNowTO, Mark Richardson put it, an approved amendment would mean ‚Äúturning 199 surface parking spaces into over 900 units of new housing.‚Äù The proposed development would comprise 919 residential units, 612 of which will be rent-geared-to-income, affordable, and market rent controlled co-op housing units. Residents would inhabit three towers: a 31 storey building, plus a 19 and 41 storey co-op building with a shared podium containing above grade parking and community uses. At grade would be commercial and retail space. https://lnkd.in/etkPPpJ9\n\n32\n\n3 Comments\n\nüì∫ The proposed \"Major Streets\" policy for Toronto, presented to the Planning and Housing Committee, was approved. ‚úÖ This new policy will allow the construction of residential buildings up to 6 storeys high or 60 units on properties designated as \"Neighbourhoods\" along major streets. üö≤ üöó üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è This change addresses Toronto's housing crisis by diversifying housing types in areas previously protected from such developments. The proposal also includes setbacks for property lines and permits small-scale retail establishments to serve local needs. üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Proponents argue that well-designed, denser developments can enhance livability, support local businesses, and provide better access to amenities. The policy seeks to correct inconsistent development standards across different street designations in Toronto, where some streets have been limited to low-rise buildings despite their potential for higher density. üè¢ üè¨ üè¶ By embracing this policy, Toronto aims to foster a city that reflects its values of diversity, inclusion, and equity while expanding housing options for people of varying income levels. This move is seen as a crucial step towards addressing artificial land scarcity and creating a more accessible and vibrant urban environment. üåø #TorontoUrbanDevelopment #HousingDiversity #CityLivability #InclusiveCityPlanning #AccessibleHousing\n\n14\n\n2 Comments\n\nTOWNSHIP OF LANGLEY DEVELOPMENT NEWS The vision of Willoughby‚Äôs 200 Street 2040 Corridor Plan was presented to Mayor and council at today‚Äôs council meeting but decisions were deferred to September to provide more time to review the documents. There‚Äôs a lot of density in this new plan and the implications are big. Skip to page 9 and 10 to see the proposed densities and building heights. EDIT: the Community Amenity Contributions in the proposed plan are quite civilized, closely following the Township‚Äôs existing CAC policy. Each density category in the new plan is given both a base density and a maximum density to which the Township‚Äôs current CAC rates will be applied. The bonus density CAC is charged on density above the plan‚Äôs base density.\n\n55\n\n2 Comments"
