        "text": "NO ENTRY FOR MEN\n\nIran, 2011, 105 minutes, Colour.\n\nDirected by Rambod Javan.\n\nNo Entry for Men sounds particularly feminist, especially from Iran. While this is the theme, the treatment is comic, Iranian comedy style.\n\nIn fact, this film might be seen as an Iranian variation on the St Trinian’s theme.\n\nThe focus is on a girls’ school, a focus on the principal who is extremely severe, tall, swathed in her black and scarf, glasses, stern, appearing everywhere and reprimanding the girls. She demands a solely female staff.\n\nHowever, a middle-aged man is appointed, teaches science, works well with the girls, but is the target of sneer from the principal who wants to replace him.\n\nIn the meantime, there is a group of girls (St Trininan’s style) who plot and plan – especially to foment some kind of romance between the principal and the teacher. Neither is aware of the plan. (The St Trinian’s-type behaviour is much more restrained than that of the British – and much less permissive in its visual and verbal presentation.)\n\nThe teacher is a genial man, not the most attractive, is tantalised by the treatment that he gets from the girls, works hard with them with their studies, is tied up with trying to please the principal, urged on by the girls. However, he is far more attracted to one of the other members of the staff.\n\nThe stern principal begins to suspect something is wrong – and ultimately goes through a transformation, looking much more attractive, changing the colour of her clothes, the style of her glasses – only to be dismayed at the trick that was played on her. However, she is happy to continue with her transformation.\n\nThe film has a strong cast, especially the actress playing the principal. Among the supporting cast is Leila Hatami, this time playing a schoolgirl, though in so many other films she plays a mature adult woman (Nader and Simin: A Separation, Saadatabad).\n\nFor western audiences, a cultural curiosity."
