        "text": "In the 14th episode of iFilm sitcom 'Medical Building' to be aired at 18:00 GMT tonight (21:30 Tehran time), Farid, our resident master of mischief, has taken his fake Alzheimer's act to new heights but his wife, Mahboubeh, is at her wits' end!\n\nFrom misplaced car keys to the disappearing remote control, Farid has reveled in the chaos he's created with his phony memory lapses. But as they say, all good pranks must come to an end. Mahboubeh has decided she's had enough and is ready to turn the tables on her prankster husband.\n\nEquipped with determination and a dash of vengeance, Mahboubeh enlists the help of their son, Nasser, who's been in on Farid's little secret all along. Together, they hatch a plan that will make Farid think twice before fooling around with memory loss again.\n\nBrace yourself for misplacements, misunderstandings, and a rollercoaster ride of laughter as we discover whether Farid will stop his prank or take it to new levels.\n\nDirected by the talented Soroush Sehhat, the series takes viewers on a comedic journey through the life of psychologist Nima.\n\nDespite his expertise, Nima constantly faces challenges and is underestimated by his family and colleagues. Struggling to prove himself as a successful doctor, he rents an office in a building filled with physicians who doubt his qualifications due to his online university degree.\n\nTo make matters more complicated, his ex-wife practices as a psychiatrist in the same building, while his current wife, a former patient, battles intense jealousy.\n\n'Medical Building' humorously portrays Nima's everyday trials, from handling diverse patients to dealing with financial burdens like rent, business expenses, and alimony payments.\n\nAdding to the chaos, his current wife copes with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and his forgetful secretary has a remarkably weak short-term memory.\n\nThe cast list of 'Medical Building' includes Bijan Banafsheh-Khah, Shaqayeq Dehqan, Houman Barqnavard, Behnam Tashakkor, Mona Farjad, and Rambod Javan.\n\nMM/MM"
