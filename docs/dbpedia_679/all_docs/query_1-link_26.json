Overall, 64 informants between the ages of 30 and 89 were interviewed about the modes of application and consumption of medicinal plants in the region. Quantitative analysis was conducted that included informant consensus factor (ICF), use value (UV), relative frequency of citation (RFC) and cultural importance index (CI). In the current study, a total of 115 medicinal plants in 41 families were reported in the south of the Kerman region. Apiaceae, Asteraceae and Lamiaceae (with 14 species each) were the families with the most medicinal plants. The most frequently used plant parts were leaves at 26.17% and aerial parts (23.49%). Decoction (53%), liniment (23%) and infusion (9%) were the most common preparation methods. The highest UVs were obtained from the following medicinal plants: Amygdalus eburnea Spach, Genista tinctoria L., Calotropis procera (Aiton) Dryand., Fortuynia garcinii (Burm.f.) Shuttlew. and Cerasus mahaleb (L.) Mill. The ICF results indicated that cold-flu and fever were the most common diseases (0.67) in the south of Kerman. Based on the current study, the south of Kerman has many potential medicinal plants, and these plants should be the focus of future research. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Iran\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWalker, Richard Thomas\n\n2006-04-01\n\nGeomorphological observations reveal a major oblique fold-and-thrust belt in Kerman province, S.E. Iran. The active faults appear to link the Sabzevaran right-lateral strike-slip fault in southeast Iran to other strike-slip faults within the interior of the country and may provide the means of distributing right-lateral shear between the Zagros and Makran mountains over a wider region of central Iran. The Rafsanjan fault is manifest at the Earth's surface as right-lateral strike-slip fault scarps and folding in alluvial sediments. Height changes across the anticlines, and widespread incision of rivers, are likely to result from hanging-wall uplift above thrust faults at depth. Scarps in recent alluvium along the northern margins of the folds suggest that the thrusts reach the surface and are active at the present-day. The observations from Rafsanjan are used to identify similar late Quaternary faulting elsewhere in Kerman province near the towns of Mahan and Rayen. No instrumentally recorded destructive earthquakes have occurred in the study region and only one historical earthquake (Lalehzar, 1923) is recorded. In addition GPS studies show that present-day rates of deformation are low. However, fault structures in southern Kerman province do appear to be active in the late Quaternary and may be capable of producing destructive earthquakes in the future. This study shows how widely available remote sensing data can be used to provide information on the distribution of active faulting across large areas of deformation.\n\nActive faulting, earthquakes, and restraining bend development near Kerman city in southeastern Iran\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWalker, Richard Thomas; Talebian, Morteza; Saiffori, Sohei; Sloan, Robert Alastair; Rasheedi, Ali; MacBean, Natasha; Ghassemi, Abbas\n\n2010-08-01\n\nWe provide descriptions of strike-slip and reverse faulting, active within the late Quaternary, in the vicinity of Kerman city in southeastern Iran. The faults accommodate north-south, right-lateral, shear between central Iran and the Dasht-e-Lut depression. The regions that we describe have been subject to numerous earthquakes in the historical and instrumental periods, and many of the faults that are documented in this paper constitute hazards for local populations, including the city of Kerman itself (population Ë200,000). Faults to the north and east of Kerman are associated with the transfer of slip from the Gowk to the Kuh Banan right-lateral faults across a 40 km-wide restraining bend. Faults south and west of the city are associated with oblique slip on the Mahan and Jorjafk systems. The patterns of faulting observed along the Mahan-Jorjafk system, the Gowk-Kuh Banan system, and also the Rafsanjan-Rayen system further to the south, appear to preserve different stages in the development of these oblique-slip fault systems. We suggest that the faulting evolves through time. Topography is initially generated on oblique slip faults (as is seen on the Jorjafk fault). The shortening component then migrates to reverse faults situated away from the high topography whereas strike-slip continues to be accommodated in the high, mountainous, regions (as is seen, for example, on the Rafsanjan fault). The reverse faults may then link together and eventually evolve into new, through-going, strike-slip faults in a process that appears to be occurring, at present, in the bend between the Gowk and Kuh Banan faults.\n\nThe Prevalence of Problematic Internet Use and the Related Factors in Medical Students, Kerman, Iran\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMazhari, Shahrzad\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground Although problematic Internet use (PIU) is a growing problem among adolescents, few studies have examined its prevalence among university students in Iran. This study was designed to investigate the prevalence of PIU and its potential risk factors among students at Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran. Methods In a cross-sectional study, data was collected from 976 university students. PIU was assessed by the 18-item Problematic Internet Use Questionnaire. In addition, information on demographics and Internet usage pattern was also collected. Findings A total of 920 students completed the survey (response rate = 94.8%). Of them, 98% were Internet users. Overall, 21% of the students were identified as problematic Internet users. Logistic regression analysis showed that spending more time online, having a history of psychiatric disorders, and using the Internet for chatting and playing games were risk factors for PIU. Conclusion PIU is a common problem among university students. These results suggest the need for preventive and interventional strategies for this vulnerable group.

A total of 2431 citizens of Kerman were surveyed from September of 2005 to April 2006. The study population was selected by cluster method from 5 different areas, and 100 houses in each area were randomly approached. Questions on the urinary symptoms consisted of flank pain, urogenital pain, dysuria or any difficulty in urination, and alterations in urine color. Individuals with a suspicion of urinary calculi based on their symptoms were evaluated by physical examination, laboratory investigations, and plain abdominal radiography. Ultrasonography and intravenous urography were done if required to confirm the diagnoses. Of 2431 individuals, 196 (8.1%) had symptoms in favor of urinary calculus diagnosis, of whom 47 (24.0%) had urinary calculi (prevalence of symptomatic urolithiasis was 1.9%). Of the patients, 35 (74.5%) were underweight. Compared to the other participants, the patients with urinary calculus were younger (P = .001) and a larger proportion of them had a positive family history of urinary calculi (14.9% versus 6.5%; P = .02) and were rug weavers and office employees. Dependency on opium and its derivative was significantly more frequent in patients with urinary calculi (25.5% versus 0.2%; P = .001). This study showed that the prevalence of symptomatic urinary calculi in this hot and dry area is relatively high. According to our findings, the other factors including specific occupations, malnutrition, and substance use may also have influence on the rate of urinary calculus formation. Therefore, to prevention and early treatment of urinary calculi, evaluation of potential predisposing conditions should be considered with special attention to regional factors.\n\nAnthropometric Analysis of Cephalofacial Dimensions in Kerman, Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nPouya, Fatemeh; Eftekhar-Vaghefi, Seyed Hassan; Salehinejad, Parvin\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThe human body dimensions are affected by ecological, biological, geographical, racial, sex, and age factors. Craniofacial measurements can be considered to be one of the important tools for determination of the morphological characteristics of the head and face. In this study, which was conducted on Persian adolescents living in Kerman/Iran, different forms of head and face were determined for using in various aspects of medicine. The study was conducted on 732 participants including 366 males and 366 females in the age of 18-20-year-old. In addition to the height and weight of the participants, cephalofacial sizes of them were measured and then cephalic, facial, and brain indices were calculated. Among the cephalofacial sizes, cranial length and breadth, cranial circumference, prosopic length and prosopic breadth were significantly greater in males compared to females (P<0.005). Also, volume and weight of brain were significantly greater in male comparing to female participants (P<0.005). The predominant type of head was meso-cephal, and the predominant type of face was meso-prosopic in both sexes.\n\nProvincial health accounts in Kerman, Iran: an evidence of a \"mixed\" healthcare financing system.\n\nPubMed\n\nMehrolhassani, Mohammad Hossein; Jafari, Mohammad; Zeinali, Javad; Ansari, Mina\n\n2014-02-01\n\nProvincial Health Accounts (PHA) as a subset of National Health Accounts (NHA) present financial information for health sectors. It leads to a logical decision making for policy-makers in order to achieve health system goals, especially Fair Financial Contribution (FFC). This study aimed to examine Health Accounts in Kerman Province. The present analytical study was carried out retrospectively between 2008 and 2011. The research population consisted of urban and rural households as well as providers and financial agents in health sectors of Kerman Province. The purposeful sampling included 16 provincial organizations. To complete data, the report on Kerman household expenditure was taken as a data source from the Governor-General's office. In order to classify the data, the International Classification for Health Accounts (ICHA) method was used, in which data set was adjusted for the province. During the study, the governmental and non-governmental fund shares of the health sector in Kerman were 27.22% and 72.78% respectively. The main portion of financial sources (59.41) was related to private household funds, of which the Out-of-Pocket (OOP) payment mounted to 92.35%. Overall, 54.86% of all financial sources were covered by OOP. The greatest portion of expenditure of Total Healthcare Expenditures (THEs) (65.19%) was related to curative services. The major portion of healthcare expenditures was related to the OOP payment which is compatible with the national average rate in Iran. However, health expenditure per capita, was two and a half times higher than the national average. By emphasizing on Social Determinant of Health (SDH) approach in the Iranian health system, the portion of OOP payment and curative expenditure are expected to be controlled in the medium term. It is suggested that PHA should be examined annually in a more comprehensive manner to monitor initiatives and reforms in healthcare sector.\n\nAssessment of the dietary pattern of dormitory students in Kerman, Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nDoostan, Farideh; Mohseni-Takalloo, Sahar; Nosrati, Mohammad\n\n2016-09-01\n\nNowadays it is known that dietary imbalances are associated with non-communicable diseases which would be a major cause of worldwide deaths in 2020. This study was conducted to assess the dietary pattern of students who live in a dormitory in Kerman, Iran, based on Healthy Eating Index-2005 (HEI-2005). This cross-sectional study was conducted on 229 students who lived in the dormitory of Kerman University of Medical Science. The participants were recruited by multistage sampling. Their usual dietary intake was collected by using a valid food frequency questionnaire. The diet quality was calculated via HEI-2005. The HEI-2005 score was categorized into three groups: less than 50 (poor diet), between 50-70 (needs improvement) and more than 70 (good diet). The mean score of HEI-2005 in the present study was 64.22Â±8.98. 8.1% of the participants had poor diet, 63.4% had to improve their diet, and 28.5% enjoyed a good diet. The percent of energy intake from total fat, saturated fatty acid, solid fat and added sugar, and also sodium were significantly lower in the highest category of HEI-2005 than the lowest category. There was no significant difference in the intake of cholesterol, total vegetable and dairy products between the highest and lowest quartile categories. Majority of the participants need to improve their diet.Policy revisions and dietary interventions would require to promote diet quality and prevent non-communicable diseases in the future.\n\nEpidemiology and Clinical Features of Atopic Dermatitis in Kerman, a Desert Area of Iran\n\nPubMed Central\n\nEsfandiarpour, Iraj; Sedaghatmanesh, Maryam; Saviz, Mahdieh\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground Epidemiologic studies of atopic dermatitis (AD) in desert areas are still lacking. Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiology of AD in children in Kerman city, a desert area in Iran. Methods We evaluated preschool children (age, 2 to 7 years) and primary school students (age, greater than 7 up to 12 years) in Kerman. We selected 865 students to estimate the prevalence and assess other features of AD such as distribution of lesions, personal history, family history of atopy, aggravating factors, associated symptoms, and morphological variants. Results The prevalence of AD was 9.1% in our study population. The prevalence of AD was 9.17% and 9.09% in males and females, respectively. The prevalence of AD in the age range of 2 to 7 years was 13.53% and 8.33% among children aged greater than 7 up to 12 years. In total, 82.27% of the patients were in chronic stage of the disease, and 31.6% had a personal history of other atopic diseases. At least one first-degree family member with atopy was seen in 46.83% of the patients. The most common sites of involvement were the head and neck. The most involved areas in the limbs were extensor surfaces. The most frequent morphological variant of AD was the common type. Conclusion The prevalence of AD in Kerman was higher than in other Iranian cities but lower than that in developed countries. Diversity in the clinical features of AD has been observed among different studies, and the diagnostic criteria of AD should be adapted in proportion to the studied area.

Client satisfaction strongly influences the success of any treatment program. This study aimed to explore the difference between customer expectations and perceptions in drug addiction treatment centers of Kerman, Iran, using SERVQUAL model. Using a cross-sectional design 260 clients referring to drug addiction treatment centers of Kerman, were enrolled in 2012. From among 84 clinics, 20 centers were selected randomly. Based on the number of clients registered in each center, a random sample proportional to the size was selected and 290 subjects were invited for interviews. A well validated 22-item questionnaire, which measured the 5 dimensions of service quality (reliability, assurance, tangibility, empathy, and responsiveness), was completed by participants. Each item measured 2 aspects of service quality; expectations and perceptions. Mean Â± SD (Standard deviation) age of the subjects was 37.7 Â± 9.4. Most of them were male (87.7%). Less than half of them had an educational level lower than diploma. The total score of clients` expectations was higher than their perceptions (P < 0.001). Considering the 5 dimensions of the SERVQUAL model, only 1 dimension (i.e., assurance) showed no difference between perceptions and expectations of the participants (P = 0.134). There was a gap between the clients' expectations and what they actually perceived in the clinics. Thus, more attention should be devoted to the clients' views regarding service quality in addiction treatment clinics.\n\nCancer Incidence in Kerman Province, Southeast of Iran: Report of an ongoing Population-Based Cancer Registry, 2014\n\nPubMed\n\nShahesmaeili, Armita; Malekpour Afshar, Reza; Sadeghi, Azadeh; Bazrafshan, Azam\n\n2018-06-25\n\nIntroduction: The epidemiology of common cancers in Kerman province, southeast of Iran, was assessed based upon results of the Kerman Population-Based Cancer Registry Program (KPBCR). Methods: in this retrospective study, all patients diagnosed with primary cancers and registered with the KPBCR were included. New cancer cases registered from 2014 were identified from pathological labs, medical reports of 48 health facilities providing cancer diagnosis or treatment services and the national death registry program. Data for patients who were referred to neighboring provinces to access health services were also collected from national referral registries. Results from autopsies was additionally extracted from regional forensic and legal medicine centers and added to the registry periodically. Age standardized incidence rates (ASRs) per 100,000 person-years for all cancers were computed, using direct-standardization and CanReg methodology. Mortality to incidence (M:I) ratios and microscopically verified (MV) proportions were calculated as quality measures. Results: A total of 2,838 cases of cancer were registered in Kerman province, 2014. Of these 45. 6% involved women (n=1,293). Individuals aged 60-64 years represented the largest proportion (11.6%) of the total cancer prevalence, followed by those aged 55-59 years (10.86%) and 65-69 years (8.99%). The ASRs for all cancers were 155.1 and 118.90 per 100,000, in men and women, respectively. In women, breast (ASR: 26.4), skin (ASR: 13.0), thyroid (ASR: 9.2), leukemia (ASR: 8.0) and colorectal (ASR: 7.70) were the most common cancers. In men, bladder (ASR: 24.70), skin (ASR: 16.80), lung (ASR: 14.6), leukemia (ASR: 14.50), and stomach (ASR: 10.8) were found to be the most frequent. Conclusion: This study provided latest evidence on epidemiology of cancer in the southeast of Iran that could be used to empower prevention and control interventions in a developing country.

While several factors play a role in creating an environment where individuals become involved in sex work, female sex workers' experiences regarding entry into sex work in Iran are poorly understood. In this qualitative study, a convenience sample of 24 participants was recruited from a drop-in centre for vulnerable women in Kerman, Iran. Through in-depth interviews, participants were asked about their personal lived experiences of initiating sex work. Grounded theory was used to analyse findings from this research. We learned that major factors impacting on women's initiation into sex work circulated around their vulnerability and chronic poverty. Participants continued to sell sex due to their limited opportunities, drug dependence and financial needs. Improving sex workers' economic status could be a vital intervention in providing vulnerable women with options other than sex work. Female sex workers should be provided with government support and educational programmes delivered through special centres. Despite the illegal status of their work, sex workers' needs should be recognised across all aspects of policy and legislation.\n\nEstimation of flood environmental effects using flood zone mapping techniques in Halilrood Kerman, Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nBoudaghpour, Siamak; Bagheri, Majid; Bagheri, Zahra\n\n2014-01-01\n\nHigh flood occurrences with large environmental damages have a growing trend in Iran. Dynamic movements of water during a flood cause different environmental damages in geographical areas with different characteristics such as topographic conditions. In general, environmental effects and damages caused by a flood in an area can be investigated from different points of view. The current essay is aiming at detecting environmental effects of flood occurrences in Halilrood catchment area of Kerman province in Iran using flood zone mapping techniques. The intended flood zone map was introduced in four steps. Steps 1 to 3 pave the way to calculate and estimate flood zone map in the understudy area while step 4 determines the estimation of environmental effects of flood occurrence. Based on our studies, wide range of accuracy for estimating the environmental effects of flood occurrence was introduced by using of flood zone mapping techniques. Moreover, it was identified that the existence of Jiroft dam in the study area can decrease flood zone from 260 hectares to 225 hectares and also it can decrease 20% of flood peak intensity. As a result, 14% of flood zone in the study area can be saved environmentally.\n\nPrevalence of Active and Passive Smoking among Adult Population: Findings of a Population-Based Survey in Kerman (KERCADRS), Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nSalimzadeh, Hamideh; Najafipour, Hamid; Mirzaiepour, Fatemeh; Navadeh, Soodabeh; Shadkam-Farrokhi, Mitra; Mirzazadeh, Ali\n\n2016-01-01\n\nSmoking is one of the major modifiable risk factors for non-communicable diseases. Our aim was to report the pattern of active and passive smoking using the data collected through a population-base household survey in Kerman, Iran [(KERCADRS) Kerman Coronary Artery Disease Risk Factors Study]. Using a cluster random sampling design, we recruited 5900 adult persons (15-75 years old) into our survey. After consenting, every participant was interviewed by a trained interviewer. The section for smoking included questions about daily (smoking at least one cigarette per day), non-daily, past and passive cigarette smoking as well as the duration of the exposure. We used Kerman population distribution (as the target population) to adjust our estimates using direct standardization method. Overall, 8.3% of study participants (15.5% in men vs. 0.8% in women, P = 0.010) reported themselves as daily smokers and an additional 1.7% (2.9% in men vs. 0.4% in women, P = 0.010) as non-daily smokers. The passive smoking was common in total (27.5%), while women experienced more exposure than men (30.1% vs. 25.0%, P = 0.010). In daily smokers, 3.2% smoked more than 20 cigarettes per day. Among passive smokers, 62.6% were exposed to cigarette smoke more than 6 days per week. Smoking is pretty common among adult populations, particularly in men. A majority of tobacco-free young adult women are exposed to passive smoking. Age and gender oriented interventions are required to change this risk pattern in Kerman community to prevent from further smoking related morbidities and mortalities.\n\nPrevalence of Active and Passive Smoking among Adult Population: Findings of a Population-Based Survey in Kerman (KERCADRS), Iran\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSalimzadeh, Hamideh; Najafipour, Hamid; Mirzaiepour, Fatemeh; Navadeh, Soodabeh; Shadkam-Farrokhi, Mitra; Mirzazadeh, Ali\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground Smoking is one of the major modifiable risk factors for non-communicable diseases.

This study aimed to assess the quality of clinical services in Kerman's teaching hospitals located in southeastern Iran. This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2011 on 303 medical students at different levels of medical education at Kerman's teaching hospitals. A modified SERVQUAL instrument was used to collect the data after its validity and reliability were checked. The data were analyzed by SPSS 18.0 using the paired t-test, Kruskal-Wallis, and post hoc tests, when appropriate. In all five dimensions of quality, gaps were observed between students' perceptions and expectations as follows: Assurance (mean = -1.18), Responsiveness (-1.56), Empathy (-1.4), Reliability (-1.27), and Tangibles (-1.21). There was a significant difference between the quality perceptions and expectations of the medical students (p < 0.001). A significant difference was observed between three educational levels, including externships, internships, and assistantships regarding the dimensions of the quality gaps (p < 0.001). The clinical services provided by teaching hospitals in the study did not meet the students' expectations at any of the three educational levels. As we precisely assessed the dimensions and items that had the higher quality gaps, it was apparent that, for most part, clinical education officials could improve the quality by designing interventions, which would not be very difficult to do.\n\nThe influence of age, seat belt, time of day, and type of vehicles on road accidents in Kerman, Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nMohammadi, Ghorbanali\n\n2009-04-01\n\nTraffic accidents are one of the main external causes of morbidity and mortality in various parts of the world, including Kerman, a city that has experienced rapid growth in the number of cars in the last 5 years. The objective of this article was to identify the influence of age, belt use, time of day, and type of vehicle road accidents of southeastern Iran. This study used data obtained from Kerman police force reports on incidents of road traffic accidents (RTAs). We analyzed the police reports of total road accidents that occurred from 2005 to 2007. The involvement in fatal and non-fatal accidents was determined for females than among males. The analysis of the data indicated that the female drivers have a much better road safety record than male drivers, especially with regards to their involvement in severe traffic accidents. Forty-nine percent of accidents involve passenger cars, which is higher than other type of vehicles. Female drivers were found to be generally safer drivers than their male counterparts; male drivers who did not use seat belts had a higher involvement rate in road traffic accidents. Time of day analyses suggested that the problems of accidents in darkness are not a matter of visibility but a consequence of the way drivers use the roads at night. A number of recommended measures for the improvement of road safety in southeastern Iran are suggested.\n\nIdentifying types of domestic violence and its associated risk factors in a pregnant population in Kerman hospitals, Iran Republic.\n\nPubMed\n\nSalari, Zohreh; Nakhaee, Nouzar\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThe objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of different kinds of physical and emotional violence in an Iranian pregnant population and to examine its associated risk factors. This cross-sectional study was done from March through July 2005 in the 4 main hospitals of Kerman, Iran, which had maternity units. In total, 416 out of 460 women who were asked to participate agreed to be interviewed, a 90.4% response rate. All respondents were interviewed privately during the first 48 hours after delivery. The mean age (+/- SD) was 28.0 +/- 5.6, and all were married. Most of the women were urban residents (89.2%), and the majority of them were multiparous (78.8%). Nearly 16% of mothers said the pregnancies were unintended. In total, 35% (95% confidence interval: 30%-40%) of women had experienced 1 or more episodes of emotional violence during the pregnancy inflicted by their husbands, and 106 women (25%; 95% confidence interval: 21%-30%) had experienced at least 1 episode of physical violence. The highest odds of domestic violence during pregnancy was associated with unintended pregnancies (odds ratio: 7.66; 95% confidence interval: 3.45-16.99) and multiparous pregnancies (odds ratio: 6.88; 95% confidence interval: 3.46-13.68). Considering the high prevalence of different types of domestic violence during pregnancy, it should be regarded as a priority for health policy experts in Kerman and possibly Iran.\n\nThe effect of note-taking skills training on the achievement motivation in learning on B.A students in Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman and Kerman University of Medical Sciences (Iran).\n\nPubMed\n\nSharifi, Parvane; Rahmati, Abbas; Saber, Maryam\n\n2013-10-01\n\nTo evaluate the effect of note-taking skills training on the achievement motivation in learning. The experimental study comprised graduate students of the 2010-11 batch at Kerman's Bahonar University and Kerman's Medical Sciences University, Iran. The study sample included 110 people; 55 in the test group, and 55 in the control group. They were randomly selected and replaced through the single-stage cluster sampling. To collect the data, a questionnaire was used. Pre-test was performed before the training session in two groups. After training course, a post-test was taken. For data analysis, the independent t-test, was used. The average pre-test score of the test group was 182 +/- 34.15, while for the control group it was 191 +/- 30.37 (p < 0.089). After the training, the post-test showed statistically significant change. The test group scored 220 +/- 20.94 against the controls who scored 195 +/- 27.26 (p < 0.001). The findings showed that achievement motivation in learning increased significantly after imparting training in note-taking skills. Authorities in the educational system should invest more for promotion of such skills.\n\nSonographical and serological survey of human cystic echinococcosis and analysis of risk factors associated with seroconversion in rural communities of Kerman, Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nHarandi, M F; Moazezi, S S; Saba, M; Grimm, F; Kamyabi, H; Sheikhzadeh, F; Sharifi, I; Deplazes, P\n\n2011-12-01\n\nCystic echinococcosis (CE) caused by larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus, is an endemic zoonosis in Iran particularly in rural regions. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of CE among rural communities in Kerman using ultrasonography (US) and serology. Kerman Province, in southeastern Iran, is the largest province, with 2.9 million inhabitants. A sample of 1140 individuals (200 males and 940 females) was selected by randomized cluster sampling in 2006-2008. After acquiring informed consent for each participant a questionnaire was filled, complete abdominal US in supine position was carried out and 5 ml blood was collected for ELISA test. Two hydatid cases (0.2%) were detected by ultrasound. Serological results showed 7.3% seropositivity, and females (8.3%) were significantly more positive than males (2.1%). There were significant difference between CE seropositivity and sex, age and occupation. Residents of desert regions (Shahdad, Andouhjerd and Golbaf) were 2.5 times more likely to be seropositive than mountainous regions with better socioeconomic status (OR = 2.5; 95% CI = 1.09-5.95). Dog ownership does not appear to be a significant risk factor for CE in the region. Only about 10% of households own dogs, usually only one dog. However, the stray dog population of Kerman province is estimated at 145 000-480 000 (3.5-11.5 times the owned dog population). Infection in humans and animals would appear to come mostly from infected stray dogs. Management of stray dog population could make major progress in control of hydatid disease. In addition, proper washing of vegetables decreased probability of infection by 53% (OR = 0.47; 95% CI = 0.26-0.84). The serological study showed that many people, especially women, had been exposed to Echinococcus eggs and had seroconverted but were not infected.

This study was conducted to evaluate the quality of dental care and services provided to patients referred to a Dental School in Kerman, Iran. In this qualitative study, face-to-face, in-depth interviews were conducted with 41 participants [25 patients (P), 5 nurses (N), 6 dental academic staff (AS), and 5 dental students (S)]. Then, the interviews were transcribed and analyzed, using content analysis of data. Data analysis in qualitative research involves breaking down the data and searching for codes and categories that are then reassembled to form themes. Both positive and negative themes emerged. Positive themes included: good infection control, service accessibility, patient appointments and visits were not assigned on merit, precise examinations, and comprehensive treatment plans. Negative themes included: long wait time, lack of options to pass waiting time, such as newspapers and television, an insufficient number of nurses, and not enough professors for supervision. In addition, the results of this study show that the patients and dental staff have high expectations in relation to dental services, and that implementation of these expectations would increase the overall satisfaction with and the quality of the level of services. Finally, some recommendations for improving services in the Kerman Dental School were given to the managing team of the Dental School.\n\nInvestigation of the reasons for not using helmet among motorcyclists in Kerman, Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nMaghsoudi, Aliasghar; Boostani, Dariush; Rafeiee, Manoochehr\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThis study was carried out to investigate reasoning and interpretation of motorcyclists for not using helmet utilizing qualitative methodology of 'grounded theory'. The field of the study was Kerman, a cultural-historical city at the south-east of Iran. Participants were 21 young male motorcyclists. Two sampling strategies were used: maximum variation and snowball sampling. To collect data, in-depth, open-ended interviews were conducted. Data analysis yielded seven categories: fatalism; a barrier to social relationships; peer group pressure and negative labelling; messing up the appearance; disturbance in hearing and vision; barrier to normal breathing; and heaviness and superfluity of helmet. Based on the findings of the current study, it could be concluded that socio-cultural contexts, motorcyclists' worldview and partly helmet-related problems are of the main factors which affect motorcycling. Therefore, the studies, policy-makings, and intervening programmes to control injury and to promote safety among motorcyclists should be focused on socio-cultural barriers to helmet use in general and changing the motorcyclists' standpoints toward fatalism in particular. Helmet-related problems should be considered, too.\n\nApplication of support vector machines for copper potential mapping in Kerman region, Iran\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShabankareh, Mahdi; Hezarkhani, Ardeshir\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThe first step in systematic exploration studies is mineral potential mapping, which involves classification of the study area to favorable and unfavorable parts. Support vector machines (SVM) are designed for supervised classification based on statistical learning theory. This method named support vector classification (SVC). This paper describes SVC model, which combine exploration data in the regional-scale for copper potential mapping in Kerman copper bearing belt in south of Iran. Data layers or evidential maps were in six datasets namely lithology, tectonic, airborne geophysics, ferric alteration, hydroxide alteration and geochemistry. The SVC modeling result selected 2220 pixels as favorable zones, approximately 25 percent of the study area. Besides, 66 out of 86 copper indices, approximately 78.6% of all, were located in favorable zones. Other main goal of this study was to determine how each input affects favorable output. For this purpose, the histogram of each normalized input data to its favorable output was drawn. The histograms of each input dataset for favorable output showed that each information layer had a certain pattern. These patterns of SVC results could be considered as regional copper exploration characteristics.\n\nA newly emerged focus of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis in South-western Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nAskari, A; Sharifi, I; Aflatoonian, M R; Babaei, Z; Ghasemi Nejad Almani, P; Mohammadi, M A; Alizadeh, H; Hemati, S; Bamorovat, M\n\n2018-04-27\n\nLeishmaniasis is rising in many countries, including Iran, due to climate change, refugee crises, urbanization and etc. The aim of this study was to explore the epidemiology, extent and identity of Leishmania species in a newly emerged focus in Abdanan County, Ilam Province, South-western Iran. This study was performed as a descriptive cross-sectional study by a systematic house-to-house approach. The Leishmania species was identified by RFLP-PCR and sequencing. Altogether, 46799 individuals consisting 0f 22907 (48.9) female and 23892 (51.1%) male were interviewed and physically examined for the presence of skin lesions. Overall, the incidence rate was 0.34% (nâ¯=â¯160). All age groups were affected and the incidence rate was the highest in <10 years of age group (0.49%) and the lowest in >50 years old individuals (0.15%), although there was no significant difference regarding the sex and age. The majority of patients had one lesion (47.5%) on hands (56%) and most of the cases occurred in Abdanan city (%54) in summer. Based on the RFLP-PCR analysis, all the Leishmania isolates were L. major of single genotype. A newly emerged focus of zoonotic CL caused by L. major occurred in South-western of Iran. Multiple risk factors created this epidemic area. Further studies on the vector and reservoir are crucial needed to provide evidences to select the prophylactic and therapeutic measures for future control strategies. Copyright Â© 2018.

Concerning the experiences of previous earthquakes, the role and importance of nonstructural components becomes increasingly clear in the uninterrupted services of hospitals. In this study, non-structural retrofitting status of Kerman teaching hospitals was evaluated against natural disasters. This cross-sectional study was carried out in the second half of 2014 on the teaching hospitals in Kerman (Iran). The study population consisted of all Kerman teaching hospitals. The research instrument was World Health Organization/Pan American Health Organization (WHO/PAHO) standard checklist. Data analysis was carried out using descriptive statistics through SPSS 19. One hospital had a low retrofitting level, two hospitals had an average level and one had a high level. In the examined hospitals in this study, the medical gas section had the lowest preparedness against natural disasters, while the office, warehouse and furniture section had the highest resistance. Generally, the non-structural retrofitting status was 50% in one hospital and was between 65% and 85% in other hospitals. Generally, the retrofitting status of hospitals was not at the ideal condition, most hospitals were in average condition. Concerning the high risk of hospitals in disasters, it is necessary that senior executives and managers of Kerman Province and Kerman University of Medical Sciences take some measures to retrofit these buildings and to reduce the risk of vulnerability.\n\nPrevalence of dyslipidemia and its association with other coronary artery disease risk factors among urban population in Southeast of Iran: results of the Kerman coronary artery disease risk factors study (KERCADRS).\n\nPubMed\n\nNajafipour, Hamid; Shokoohi, Mostafa; Yousefzadeh, Gholamreza; Sarvar Azimzadeh, Behzad; Moshtaghi Kashanian, Gholamreza; Bagheri, Mohamad Mehdi; Mirzazadeh, Ali\n\n2016-01-01\n\nDespite the importance of identifying and screening dyslipidemia to prevent coronary artery diseases CAD(Coronary Artery Disease), little information is available on dyslipidemia in our large area. So the present study aimed to assess the management status of lipid abnormalities and its association with other CAD risk factors in an urban population of southeast of Iran. This cross-sectional study was a part of the Kerman coronary artery disease risk factor study KERCADRS (Kerman coronary artery disease risk study) as a population-based, epidemiological research among 5900 individuals aged 15 to 75Â years who were residents of Kerman city, the largest city in Southeast of Iran. Lipid profile was assessed using enzymatic laboratory methods. In total, 5558 persons from 5899 participants were assessed in whom 45.1Â % were male and 54.9Â % female. Overall 20.9Â % had borderline level of cholesterol (200-239Â mg/dl) and 8.7Â % suffered from hypercholesterolemia (â¥240Â mg/dl). The prevalence of undiagnosed dyslipidemia (UDL) was 16.8Â % and of diagnosed dyslipidemia (DDL) was 13.2Â % that both UDL and DDL were more prevalent in women. Also, UDL was more revealed in third and fourth age decades. Advanced age, anxiety, obesity (BMI â¥30 Kg/m 2 ), and family history of dyslipidemia predicted dyslipidemia in study population. The overall prevalence of UDL was higher than of DDL, and was significantly influenced by advanced age, anxiety, obesity, and family history of dyslipidemia. The data showed that our health care management system should improve its strategies to reduce the burden of this important CAD risk factor.\n\nSeroprevalence of canine visceral leishmaniasis in southeast of Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nMahshid, Mostafavi; Baharak, Akhtardanesh; Iraj, Sharifi; Sina, Kakooei; Javad, Khedri; Mehdi, Bamorovat\n\n2014-06-01\n\nVisceral leishmaniasis is an endemic disease in many parts of Iran and infected dogs constitute the main domestic reservoirs that play a key role in transmission to humans. The objective of this study was to assess the seroprevalence of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in southeast of Iran. This survey was carried out from 2009 to 2011 in Kerman, Bam and Baft districts in Kerman province and Zabol in Sistan-Baluchestan province. Blood samples were taken from 201 dogs after complete clinical examination. Following hematological evaluation; collected sera were tested by indirect ELISA method for the presence of anti Leishmania infantum antibodies. Overall seroprevalence was 15.4Â %, including 6.4, 3.5, 3 and 2.4Â % in Bam, Zabol, Baft and Kerman, respectively. However, seroprevalence of disease was not significantly related to age, gender, presence of clinical signs and hematological disorders. Based to the results of the present study, CVL is endemic in southeastern Iran. Delayed diagnosis and euthanasia of potentially infectious animals may occur with an increased transmission risk to sand flies and subsequently to humans. Implementation of potent screening tests with high validity is essential for rapid detection and successful dog elimination programs in endemic parts of Iran.\n\nExamining non-structural retrofitting status of teaching hospitals in Kerman against disasters\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMoghadam, Mahmood Nekooi; Moradi, Seyed Mobin; Amiresmaili, Mohammadreza\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground and objective Continuous services provision of a hospital before and after a disaster is one of the most prominent issues that all people, especially the authorities must take into huge consideration.

We analyzed 68 and 49 E coli isolates isolated from healthy fecal samples of patients with thalassemia and HIV-infected patients, respectively. The E coli isolates were studied using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction to identify the enterotoxigenic E coli (ETEC), enterohemorrhagic E coli (EHEC), and enteropathogenic E coli (EPEC) groups. Statistical analysis was carried out to determine the correlation of diarrheagenic E coli between HIV-infected patients and patients with thalassemia using Stata 11.2 software. The frequency of having at least 1 diarrheagenic E coli was more common in patients with thalassemia (67.64%) than in HIV-infected patients (57.14%; P = .25), including ETEC (67.64% versus 57.14%), EHEC (33.82% versus 26.53%), and EPEC (19.11% versus 16.32%). The results of this study indicate that ETEC, EHEC, and EPEC pathotypes are widespread among diarrheagenic E coli isolates in patients with thalassemia and HIV-infected patients.\n\nColorectal cancer trends in Kerman province, the largest province in Iran, with forecasting until 2016.\n\nPubMed\n\nRoya, Nikbakht; Abbas, Bahrampour\n\n2013-01-01\n\nColorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers. The aim of this study is determination its trends in Kerman province and individual cities separately until year 2016. This analytical and modeling study was based of cancer registry data of Kerman University of Medical Sciences, collected during 2001-2010. Among 20,351 cancer case, 792 were colorectal cancer cases in age group 18-93 years with a mean of 59.4 and standard deviation of 15.1. By applying time series and data trends, incidences were predicted until 2016 for the province and each city, with adjustment for population size. In colorectal cases, 413 (52%) were male, and 379 (48%) were female. The annual increasing rate in Kerman province overall was and can be expected to be 6%, and in the cities of the province Rafsanjan, Bardsir, Bam, Kerman, Baft, Sirjan, Jiroft, Kahnuj and Manujan had an increasing range from 5 to 14% by the year 2016. But in Ravar, Zarand and Shahrbabak reduction in rates of at least 2% could be predicted. The time series showed that the trend of colorectal cancer in female will increase 15% and in male 7% by year 2016. Given the trend of this cancer is increasing so that resources will be consumed in the treatment of the patients, efforts shoudlbe focused on prevention and early diagnosis of the disease. Screening could have an important role leading to improved survival.\n\nOral health status of dialysis patients based on their renal dialysis history in Kerman, Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nChamani, Goli; Zarei, Mohammad Reza; Radvar, Mehrdad; Rashidfarrokhi, Farin; Razazpour, Fateme\n\n2009-01-01\n\nMaintaining a high level of periodontal and oral health in patients undergoing renal dialysis is of paramount importance because of the inherent compromised host defence mechanisms. The aim of the present study was to determine the periodontal status and the level of dental caries in renal dialysis patients in Kerman, Iran. A cross-sectional study was conducted on two groups of patients: one including 68 renal dialysis patients (test) and the other including 30 healthy subjects (control). Half-mouth measurements of Gingival Index (GI), Plaque Index (PI), probing pocket depth (PPD), gingival recession (GR), clinical attachment level (CAL) and bleeding on probing (BOP) as well as decayed, missing or filled teeth (DMFT) index were recorded. The GI, BOP, PPD, CAL and GR were significantly greater among the test group as compared with the control group; however, the DMFT did not differ significantly among the groups. There was no relationship between the duration of the dialysis and the periodontal indices. It seems that patients with chronic renal failure have less favourable periodontal health than normal patients. The present study showed that oral home care practices were inadequate. Thus, preventive programmes to promote the oral health status of haemodialysis patients are needed.\n\nEffect of Health Education Based on the Protection Motivation Theory on Malaria Preventive Behaviors in Rural Households of Kerman, Iran\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGhahremani, Leila; Faryabi, Reza; Kaveh, Mohammad Hossein\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground: Malaria is one of the most serious diseases in pregnant women as well as children less than 5 years around the world. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of health education based on the protection motivation theory on malaria preventive behaviors in the households of Ghale Ganj, Kerman, Iran in 2011. Methods: The present quasi-experimental study was conducted on 144 households covered by 8 health centers of Ghale Ganj, Kerman. The study samples were selected through systematic random sampling and the study data were collected using a questionnaire including demographic information, the constructs of the protection motivation theory, and a checklist for assessing the malaria preventive behaviors. After the pre-test, the intervention group underwent an educational intervention and after two months, the post-test was performed through the same questionnaire. Then, the data were entered into the SPSS statistical software (v. 18) and analyzed using Chi-square and Wilcoxon non-parametric tests. Besides, P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: Before the intervention, no significant difference was found between the two study groups regarding perceived vulnerability, perceived severity, response costs, self-efficacy, response efficacy, and malaria preventive behaviors. After the intervention, however, a significant increase was observed in the intervention group's mean scores of all the constructs of the protection motivation theory as well as malaria preventive behaviors (P < 0.01). Conclusions: According to the findings of the study, educational intervention based on the protection motivation theory is highly effective in promoting malaria preventive behaviors.

However, under climatic warming observed over the past century, it remains uncertain how such impacts affect frost risk associated with plant phenophase shifts. Any increase in frost frequency or severity has the potential to damage flowers and their resultant yields and, in more extreme cases, the survival of the plant. An accurate assessment of the relationship between the timing of last frost events and phenological shifts associated with warmer climate is thus imperative. We investigate spring advances in citrus flowering dates (orange, tangerine, sweet lemon, sour lemon and sour orange) for Kerman and Shiraz, Iran from 1960 to 2010. These cities have experienced increases in both T max and T min, advances in peak flowering dates and changes in last frost dates over the study period. Based on daily instrumental climate records, the last frost dates for each year are compared with the peak flowering dates. For both cities, the rate of last frost advance lags behind the phenological advance, thus increasing frost risk. Increased frost risk will likely have considerable direct impacts on crop yields and on the associated capacity to adapt, given future climatic uncertainty.\n\nCapoeta damascina (Valenciennes, 1842), a new host of Contracaecum sp. and Capillaria sp. (Nematoda) from the Kor River Basin, southwestern Iran\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGholami, Zeinab; Rahimi, Mohammad Taghi; Kia, Eshrat Beigom; Esmaeili, Hamid Reza; Mobedi, Iraj\n\n2014-01-01\n\nObjective To investigate the parasitic infection status of cyprinid fish, Capoeta damascina in Gomban spring-stream, Kor River Basin, Fars Province, southwestern Iran. Methods A total of 12 cyprinid fish (7 females and 5 males) were collected from Gomban spring-stream, Kor River Basin, Fars Province, southwestern Iran. The collected fish were dissected carefully and their internal organs such as liver, gonad, muscle, abdominal lobes, whole viscera and digestive tract were surveyed parasitologically. Results One female cyprinid fish out of 12 fish was infected with three nematodes. Two nematodes (larvae) were identified as Contracaecum sp. which were attached firmly to the outer part of intestine and another adult helminth was recognized as Capillaria sp. which was recovered from digestive content. Conclusions This study is the first record indicating that cyprinid fish acts as a new host for recovered nematodes. Further helminthological investigations are highly recommended in different parts of Iran in order to expand our knowledge about helmintic parasites of cyprinid fish and their role in transmission of diseases to human and animal.

Therefore, understanding and improving the status of dignity among these patients is of great importance. This study aimed to determine the status of dignity in patients with CVD admitted to cardiac intensive care units (CICUs) in Iran. This cross-sectional descriptive study was performed in 2015 on 200 patients admitted to the CICUs of hospitals affiliated to Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Iran. The participants were selected using random sampling method. Patientsâ understanding of dignity was assessed through the reliable and valid Persian version of the Patient Dignity Inventory (PDI). Patients who were able to read and write or speak Persian and were conscious were included in the study. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics tests, independent t-test, and one-way ANOVA in SPSS software. The mean age of the study participants was 59.0 Â± 17.0. The mean score of human dignity was 3.60 Â± 1.39. The mean scores of the factors of loss of independence, emotional distress and uncertainty, changes in ability and mental image, and the loss of human dignity were 3.94 Â± 1.06, 3.63 Â± 1.37, 3.57 Â± 1.20, and 3.30 Â± 2.08, respectively. A significant statistical correlation was observed between human dignity and the demographic characteristics of gender and frequency of hospitalizations in a CICU and a significant difference between those who lived alone and those who lived with family was observed (P < 0.05). Patients hospitalized in CICUs experience numerous problems associated with human dignity in each of its four dimensions. It is recommended that a study be conducted to investigate the relationship between the human dignity of patients with CVD and their QOL, anxiety, and depression.

A cross-sectional study. Using a multistage non-random sampling approach, we recruited 2157 students from three universities in Kerman, Iran, in 2016. We collected data on substance use by individual face-to-face interview using direct (i.e. self-report of their own behaviors) and indirect (NSU: Network scale up) methods. All estimates from direct and indirect methods were weighted based on inverse probability weight of sampling university. The response rate was 83.6%. The last year prevalence of water pipe, alcohol, and cigarettes indirect method was 44.6%, 18.1%, and 13.2% respectively. Corresponding figures in NSU analysis were 36.4%, 18.2%, and 16.5% respectively. In the female population, VF for all types of substance was less than male. Considerable numbers of university students used substances like a water pipe, alcohol, and cigarettes. NSU seems a promising method, especially among male students. Among female students, direct method provided more reliable results mainly due to transmission and prestige biases.\n\nAn annual analysis of clinical diagnosis versus autopsy findings in fatal motor vehicle accident in legal medicine organization of Kerman province, Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nGhadipasha, Masood; Vaghefi, Soheila Sadat; Kazemi Esfeh, Shahrooz; Teimoori, Maryam; Ouhadi, Amin Reza; Mirhosseini, Seyed Mohammad\n\n2015-08-01\n\nOne of the most common causes of death in Iran and other developing countries, are traffic accidents. Accordingly, this study was done based on the investigation and prevention of traffic injuries. This cross sectional study includes all fatal traffic accidents in the province of Kerman during a year; moreover, spss19 software is used for analyzing data. The main references of this survey were both the clinical reports of the victims of the road accidents as well as their Autopsy findings in forensic medicine center of the Iranian province of Kerman. In this study, 1185 victims of road accidents have been under supervision. Furthermore, statistical information such as age, sex, education, career, position of the occupant (Car drivers, motorcycle drivers and pedestrians), injuries related to the accident, type of vehicle, City-location of the accident and Place of death are observed. The main causes of death victims of road accidents were categorized into six groups. Occupational groups according EE0-1Job category were classified into 9 groups. Results are reported as descriptive as a frequency index (%), mean Â± standard deviation, in addition, chi squared test was used to compare the clinical findings and autopsy And p < 0.05 was considered to indicate significance. In total 1185 people, there are 939 men (79.2%) and 246 women (20.8%). Most deaths occurred in young adult, 26.7% (19-24 years, n = 316).

Around 5900 adult individuals aged 15-75 years enrolled to the study from 2009 to 2011 applying randomized cluster household survey in Kerman, southeastern of Iran. Overweight was defined as body mass index (BMI) 25-29.9 kg/m2, obesity was considered as BMI â¥ 30 kg/m2, and central obesity was regarded as waist circumference (WC) > 88 cm for women and 102 cm for men. The overall age-sex standardized prevalence of overweight, obesity and central obesity was 29.6% (29.5% men, 29.7% women), 13.0% (9.3% men, 16.9% women) and 14.4% (7.5% men, 21.5% women), respectively. \"Overweight/obesity\" increased by age, [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 7.9 95% confidence interval (CI): 5.8, 10.7)] for 65-75 years old, 11.7 (95% CI: 9, 15.3) for 55-65 years old, 10.1 (95% CI: 7.8, 13) for 45-54 years old compared with the first age group), female gender [AOR: 1.5 (1.3, 1.8); P < 0.001], higher education (AOR > 1.5 compared with illiterate individuals; P < 0.001), and low physical activity [AOR: 1.4 (95% CI: 1.1, 1.8); P = 0.006] and decreased by smoking [AOR: 0.4 (95% CI: 0.3, 0.6); P < 0.001] and opium using [AOR: 0.5 (95% CI: 0.4, 0.7); P < 0.001].

Giardiasis causing more than 200 million symptomatic infections globally is one of the most common causes of diarrhea in developing countries. Based on molecular studies mainly targeting the small-subunit (SSU) rRNA gene locus of the parasite, eight assemblages (A to H) have been identified in humans and other animal species. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the frequency and molecular diversity of G. duodenalis in children from rural and urban day care centers from Behbahan, southwestern Iran. This cross-sectional study was based on a concentration method for the microscopic detection of G. duodenalis in stool samples of 450 children, aged 1-7Â years, in Behbahan, southwestern Iran. The survey was conducted from December 2015 to May 2016. PCR methods targeting the SSU rRNA and triose phosphate isomerase (TPI) genes of G. duodenalis were used for the identification and genotyping of the parasite isolates. Based on sucrose flotation and microscopy techniques, 2.7% (12/450) of children were infected with G. duodenalis, of which six (50.0%) were males and the other six (50.0%) were females. Overall, 91.7% (11/12) of the infections were detected in children from rural areas. The SSU rRNA and TPI genes were amplified successfully in nine and eight, respectively, of the Giardia-positive samples at microscopy. Among the eight TPI sequences, assemblage A, sub-assemblage AII, was identified in five of the isolates. The sequences of the three remaining samples were untypable. Although no significantly statistical difference between genotype and clinical symptoms was found, five out of the eight isolates identified as assemblage A were obtained in asymptomatic children. Giardia duodenalis infections were more prevalent in children from rural day care schools, and the predominant assemblage was A, sub-assemblage AII.

The purpose of this research was to predict the Internet addiction based on the personality characteristics of high school students in Kerman. This research was a descriptive correlational study. The statistical population included 538 male and female students in the second grade of high school in Kerman during 2010. The subjects were randomly selected by multistage clustering. Data was collected by two questionnaires including the five-factor Revised NEO Personality Inventory and the Internet dependency questionnaire. The data was analyzed using ANOVA test and multivariable regression analysis. The findings showed a significant relationship between the personality trait of emotional stability and academic fields, i.e. students with higher emotional stability experience less negative emotions when confronting with problems. Therefore, it is less likely for them to alleviate the negative emotions by the extreme and obsessed usage of the Internet. In addition, it appears that the students with high extroversion scores prefer social, face to face interactions with other people to interaction with the virtual world. Conversely, more introvert students avoid interactions with other people due to their shyness. Thus, they communicate with the virtual world more. Three personality traits of loyalty, emotional stability, and extroversion are the most significant predictors of Internet addiction in high school students.\n\nHIV, HSV2 and Syphilis Prevalence in Female Sex Workers in Kerman, South-East Iran; Using Respondent-Driven Sampling\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNavadeh, S; Mirzazadeh, A; Mousavi, L; Haghdoost, AA; Fahimfar, N; Sedaghat, A\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground We estimated the prevalence of HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and risky behaviors among female sex workers (FSW) in Kerman City, Iran. Methods: Women, 18 years or older, who reported selling sex for at least 6 months during their lifetime and had at least one sexual contact with a client in the recent 12 months were sampled using Responding Driven Sampling (RDS). Participants were interviewed about their sexual behaviors and provided whole blood for HIV, syphilis, and Herpes simplex type 2 (HSV2) testing. Data were analyzed using RDSAT Version 6.0 software. Results: Among samples of 177 FSW, we did not find any HIV positive cases. The weighted prevalence of syphilis and HSV2 were 7.2% and 18.0%, respectively. The reported STI syndromes for the proceeding year of the survey were 36%. Unprotected sexual contact was about 17â22% and link to injecting drug users through injection was about 18%. Conclusion: While this survey found no HIV, there were findings of risky sexual behaviors and STI, markers for potential infection for HIV. The prevalence of STI and sexual risk behaviors for HIV is considerably high in this subpopulation that alarming for an urgent public health preventive measures and national control-plan to be developed and implemented.

Regular screening is very important for early detection of these cancers, but studies indicate low rates of screening participation. In this survey we studied the rate of screening participation among women 18-64 years old referred to urban health centers in Kerman, Iran in 2015. A cross-sectional study was carried out on 240 women who were selected using a multistage sampling method. Data collected using a questionnaire covered demographics and questions about common cancer screening status in women. Analysis was by SPSS 19. The mean age of participants was 31.7Â± 7. Most (97.1%) were married, housewives (83.3%), had high school diploma (43.8%) and a monthly income more than ten million Rls. The frequency of the Pap test performance was higher in women who were employed and with a university degree (p<0.05). The frequency of mammography performance in women over 40 years was also higher in women with university degree (p<0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in the frequency of pelvic examination, and self and clinical breast examinations based on education, household income and employment (p>0.05). Our study found that the rate of screening participation among women is low. Investigation of the barriers, increasing the awareness of women about the importance and advantages of screening and also more incentives for health personnel especially family physicians to pay more attention to preventive programs could be effective.\n\nA Comparative Study on Willingness to Pay for Breast Cancer and Osteoporosis Screening in Kerman, Southeastern Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nSabermahani, Asma; Mohammad Taghizade, Sedighe; Goodarzi, Reza\n\n2017-05-01\n\nOne of the economic evaluation techniques involves calculation of willingness to pay (WTP) for a service to find out the value of that service from the clients' perspective. This study estimated WTP for both breast cancer and osteoporosis screening and comparatively examined the contributing factors. In fact, the comparisons served to provide an exact analysis of individual attitudes and behaviors in relation to screening programs for cancers and other diseases. This study was first designed in six scenarios several questionnaires concerning individual breast cancer and osteoporosis screening cases, and determined the WTP median in each scenario between people in Kerman Province of Iran in 2016. Then, the demand function for breast cancer and osteoporosis screening was formulated. Moreover, the factors contributing to WTP were examined through various scenarios in Stata and econometric techniques. The median and mean values of WTP in all the above scenarios were greater for breast cancer screening than for osteoporosis screening. Theoretically, the price assumed a minus sign whereas risk assumed a plus sign within the demand function formulated for both screening programs. Regarding the evaluated factors, age in breast cancer screening and risk of disease in osteoporosis screening were the major factors contributing to WTP. Breast cancer screening was more valuable than osteoporosis screening program from the perspective of the subjects. The programs can be successfully designed by concentrating on patients' age groups in breast cancer screening and high-risk patients in osteoporosis screening.\n\nInternet Addiction Based on Personality Characteristics of High School Students in Kerman, Iran\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZamani, Bibi Eshrat; Abedini, Yasamin; Kheradmand, Ali\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBackground The new phenomenon of Internet addiction among teenagers and young adults is one of the modern addictions in industrial and post-industrial societies.

There is no recent population-based data about the prevalence of human intestinal parasites in most rural areas of Iran. The current study aimed to determine the prevalence of intestinal protozoan infection in inhabitants of rural areas of Boyer-Ahmad district, Southwestern Iran. A total of 1025 stool samples were collected from the inhabitant of 50 randomly selected villages in Boyer-Ahmad Township. The stool samples were evaluated by parasitological methods including, direct wet-mounting, formalin ethyl acetate concentration, zinc sulfate floatation, and Trichrome permanent stain for detection of protozoan infections. Diarrheic samples were further evaluated with a modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining method for detection of coccidian parasites. The prevalence of both pathogenic and nonpathogenic intestinal parasites in the population was 37.5% (385 out of 1025 cases), some individual with multiple infections. Giardia lamblia was detected in 179 (17.46%), Blastocystis hominis in 182 (17.76%), Entamoeba histolytica/dispar in 9 (0.87%), Endolimax nana in 216 (21.07%), Entamoeba coli in 151 (14.73%), Ioedamoeba butschlii in 45 (4.39%), Chillomastix mesnili in 22 (2.14%), Trichomonas hominis in 2 (0.19%) and Dientamoeba fragillis in 2 (0.19%) of cases. Multivariate logistic regression revealed significant associations between protozoan infection (pathogenic protozoa) and contact with animals (OR yes/noâ=â2.22, pâ<â0.001) and educational status (OR higher/illiterateâ=â0.40, Pâ=â0.01).

In this study, the economic values of water in farms under Dorodzan Dam in southwestern Iran were calculated using linear programming models. The method was applied to three samples of farms that drew irrigation water from a canal, a well, and both a well and a canal. The results of this study revealed that the shadow prices of water in farms varied based on the water sources and time of year. Additionally, the estimated price for water is obviously higher than the price that farmers currently pay for water in the study area. Due to the different economic values of water calculated for different months, it is recommended that the price of irrigation water be adjusted accordingly during various seasons in a fashion similar to that of electrical energy.\n\nLut Desert, Iran\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1981-01-01\n\nIran is a large country with several desert regions.

Recent cancer registry data have shown very different rates of esophageal cancer (EC) and gastric cancer (GC) in four Provinces of Iran, namely Ardabil, Mazandaran, Golestan, and Kerman. The aim of this study was to have a preliminary assessment of the hypothesis that high rates of EC in Golestan and high rates of GC in Ardabil may be partly attributable to selenium deficiency. We measured serum selenium in 300 healthy adults from Ardabil (n = 100), Mazandaran (n = 50), Golestan (n = 100), and Kerman (n = 50), using inductively coupled plasma, with dynamic reaction cell, mass spectrometry (ICP-DRC-MS) at the US Centers for Disease Control (Atlanta, Georgia). The median serum selenium concentrations were very different in the four Provinces. The medians (IQR) for selenium in Ardabil, Mazandarn, Golestan, and Kerman were 82 (75-94), 123 (111-132), 155 (141-173), and 119 (110-128) microg/L, respectively (P<0.001). The results of linear regression showed that the Province variable, by itself, explained 76% of the variance in log selenium (r2 = 0.76). The proportion of the populations with a serum selenium more than 90 microg/L (the concentration at which serum selenoproteins are saturated) was 100% in Golestan, Kerman, and Mazandaran but only 29% in Ardabil. Our findings suggest that selenium deficiency is not a major contributor to the high incidence of EC seen in northeastern Iran, but it may play a role in the high incidence of GC in Ardabil Province.

A total of 52 rodents were collected from different parts of Boyer-Ahmad district, in Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad province, using Sherman live traps. Each rodent was anesthetized with ether, according to the ethics of working with animals, and was dissected. Samples were taken from various tissues and stool samples were collected from the contents of the colon and small intestines. Moreover, 2 to 5âmL of blood was taken from each of the rodents and the sera were examined for anti-Leishmania antibodies, by ELISA, or anti-T. gondii antibodies, by modified agglutination test (MAT). DNA was extracted from brain tissue samples of each rodent and PCR was used to identify the DNA of T. gondii. Results. Of the 52 stool samples of rodents studied by parasitological methods, intestinal protozoa infection was seen in 28 cases (53.8%). From 52 rodents, 19 (36.5%) were infected with Trichomonas, 10 (19.2%) with Giardia muris, and 11 (21.2%) with Entamoeba spp. Also, 10 cases (19.2%) were infected with Blastocystis, 3 (5.8%) were infected with Chilomastix, 7 (13.5%) were infected with Endolimax, 1 (1.9%) was infected with Retortamonas, 3 (5.77%) were infected with T. gondii, and 6 (11.54%) were infected with Trypanosoma lewisi. Antibodies to T. gondii were detected in the sera of 5 (9.61%) cases. Results of the molecular study showed T. gondii infection in 3 (5.77%) of the rodents. Findings of this study showed that rodents in Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad province, southwestern Iran, are infected with several blood and intestinal parasites; some of them might be potential risks to residents and domestic animals in the region.

Analysis indicated that the sample (n = 350) of prisoners had relatively high knowledge about HIV/AIDS and its modes of transmission. However, they had a lower level of knowledge about HIV/AIDS prevention. The overall knowledge of men about AIDS was significantly lower than women. Persons aged 46 years and older and illiterate inmates had the least knowledge about modes of transmission. In addition, the knowledge of illiterate prisoners about HIV/AIDS prevention was significantly lower than others. Evaluation of attitudes and practices of prisoners and implementation of educational programmes regarding HIV/AIDS are suggested.\n\nComparison of hydrothermal alteration patterns associated with porphyry Cu deposits hosted by granitoids and intermediate-mafic volcanic rocks, Kerman Magmatic Arc, Iran: Application of geological, mineralogical and remote sensing data\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYousefi, Seyyed Jabber; Ranjbar, Hojjatollah; Alirezaei, Saeed; Dargahi, Sara; Lentz, David R.\n\n2018-06-01\n\nThe southern section of the Cenozoic Urumieh-Dokhtar Magmatic Arc (UDMA) of Iran, known as Kerman Magmatic Arc (KMA) or Kerman copper belt, is a major host to porphyry Cu Â± Mo Â± Au deposits, collectively known as PCDs. In this study, the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data and spectral angle mapper (SAM) method, combined with field data, mineralogical studies, and spectral analysis are used to determine hydrothermal alteration patterns related to PCDs in the KMA. Gossans developed over some of these porphyry type deposits were mapped using Landsat 8 data. In the NKMA gossans are more developed than in the SKMA due to comparatively lower r"
