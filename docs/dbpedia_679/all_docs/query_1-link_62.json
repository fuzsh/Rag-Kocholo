        "text": "Mehran Modiri (Persian: مهران مدیری ‎‎, born April 7, 1967) is a prolific Iranian actor, television director, comedian and musician. His artistic career began in his teenage years as he was acting in local plays. He then entered the world of radio and television in the early 1990s, actively writing scripts for and participating in various comedy skits during the annual Norooz comedy television shows broadcast by the IRIB.\n\nContents\n\nACTORMehran modiriiranmusicplus\n\nFunny mehran modiri in khandeh bazar\n\nFilmography\n\nActing in Theater\n\nDiscography\n\nReferences\n\nHe continued appearing in television comedies, however, he achieved real stardom with his creation of Pavarchin (Tiptoeing), in which he won numerous awards for directing and starring in the picture. He tasted success again when he directed and starred in Noghtechin (Ellipsis), and Jayezeye Bozorg (The Grand Prize), which became major hits on television in Iran.\n\nAfterwards, he followed Pavarchin's storyline with the making of Shabhaye Barareh which became his most popular television program yet; the show remained incomplete after it was criticized for offending rural people, which resulted in an abrupt end to the show after 92 episodes, without completely explaining the Barareh history.\n\nHe has starred in two full length films, and had planned on entering the film industry once again after Shabhaye Barareh was completed. However, he instead started working on his next project, television series Baghe Mozaffar.\n\nModiri also released a music album and performed in a number of concerts. He is also a veteran of the Iran–Iraq War. He is married and has two children.\n\nIn 2009 Modiri was named by Newsweek as one of the 20 people who dominate power and public discourse in Iran.\n\nFilmography\n\nMehran Modiri has acted in various TV series. Most of the popularity and fame he has garnered among the people of Iran emanates from his participation in these programs.\n\nHis first movie as a director is Saat-e-5-e-asr (ساعت پنج عصر in Persian - means: 5 O'clock in the afternoon) had a great start in Iran's Box Office. In this movie, Siamak Ansari acts as the main artist. This movie could arrive in the Fajr Film Festival of 2017, but it didn't.\n\nActing in Theater\n\nBefore acting in TV series and films, Mehran Modiri had performed in the theater.\n\nDiscography\n\nAlbums\n\n1999 : Deltangi-ha - Declamation of Hatef Alimardani 's Poems.\n\n2000 : Az Roo-ye Sadegi - Composed By : Babak Bayat and Fardin Khalatbari\n\n2003 : Ahang-e Film-e Hamnafas - Composed By: Fardin Khalatbari\n\n2004 : Ahang-e film-e Shabhaye barareh\n\n2005 : Ahang-e film-e Baghe mozaffar\n\n2010: Ahang-e serial-e Ghahveye Talkh - Two tracks, produced by Farhad Moodiri"
