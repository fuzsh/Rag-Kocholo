The steady popularity of BIFFES over the years can be gauged by the hundreds of entries it is attracting from various parts of the world with diverse themes from all the walks of life. The Government of Karnataka is extending all the possible support and help to make the event a huge success and the role played by Karnataka Chalanachitra Academy in this regard is no less significant. The onus on the Government of Karnataka is to promote and spread healthy culture and BIFFES is an ideal platform through which it can be achieved to a greater extent. The Government is dedicated to enhance the physical and intellectual in- frastructure of this Festival so that it may address the year round interest it receives from film makers all over the world and the public. I take this opportunity to welcome one and all to BIFFES and am sure that the Bengaluru Film Enthusiasts would be treated to high quality cin- ema from across the globe, and their whole hearted participation would make this event a grand success. SIDDARAMAIAH Hon'ble Chief Minister Government of Karnataka Or BIFFES & SECRETARY The 10th edition of the Bengaluru International Film Festival is all set to be launched on the 22nd of February 2018 and will be celebrated for a week till 1st of March 2018. I extend my heartiest greetings to all those film enthusiasts who have descended on Bengaluru to be part of this Film Festival. Over the years, the Festival has attained so much popularity amongst the public and film professionals, that it has become an integral part of their lifestyle. The visibility of the festival across the global film fraternity is evident from the sheer number of entries the festival has received this year. There is a huge demand for participation from both the public and film makers from all over the world. BIFFES has made significant changes to provide an improved experience to the audience, and this has resulted in more and more film enthusiasts and film professionals taking part in the festival. There has been con- stant efforts in making changes to provide the best selection of Kannada, regional, national and world cinema to the public which has helped the festival's steady rise in the global film festival circuit. The Karnataka Government has provided many incentives to Karnataka Film Industry and BIFFES is another incentive. Moreover, the establish- ment of Kannada Chalanachitra Academy by the Government of Karna- taka is a huge impetus to BIFFES. Wishing all the success to this prestigious 10th edition of BIFFES. PANKAJ KUMAR PANDEY, IAS Secretary, Department of Information and Public Relations Govt. of Karnataka § 10\" BIFFES & CHAIRMAN It’s a great pleasure and honour to welcome the very best in Kannada and world cinema to the 10th edition of the Bengaluru International Film Festival to be held from 22nd February to 1st March 2018. First of all I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere thanks to our Honourable Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, who has been a pillar of support to our festival by accepting all our requests. His gen- erosity towards the film industry has helped Kannada cinema to flour- ish, through film subsidies and tax exemptions, amongst other benefits. BIFFES allows access to the world that might be otherwise out of bounds, by presenting diverse landscapes across the globe. Bengaluru is a cos- mopolitan city and is known for its plurality of culture. It can assimilate global cultures and still retain its own identity. Despite stiff competition from various language cinemas Kannada cinema has held its status both in terms of number of films made locally and also its representation in national cinema. At this festival a bouquet of selected Art House cinema, mainstream films and culturally significant works have been lined up for screening. BIFFES has opened up a new world for our new generation of film mak- ers to look at the possibilities of film expression and that was the main objective for the establishment of Kannada Chalanachitra Academy. In the years to come the academy will hope to take this forum outside Ben- galuru and create a conducive environment in the state to boost the quality of Kannada cinema to international arena enabling the rich tradi- tion of Kannada to extend beyond the borders of the state. On behalf of Karnataka Chalanachitra Academy, I extend a warm wel- come to all the participants of the festival and wish them a great, joyful and enriching experience at BIFFES. S V RAJENDRA SINGH BABU Chairman, Karnataka Chalanchitra Academy Festival Director § 10\" BIFFES & 4 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR We are extremely happy and proud to present the 10th Bengaluru Inter- national Film Festival to be held from 22nd February to 1st March 2018. BIFFES has established itself as an important fixture on the international film festival scene due to high standards in programming, organisation- al upgrades and the enthusiastic participation of audiences. The huge demand for delegate registration and the long queues at the screening halls in the last edition to view the best of the films have determined us to extend the scope of the festival and also enlarge the infrastructure. We will be screening more than 200 films under 16 categories from more than 50 countries this year. This time we have as many as 12 screens at PVR and Dr. Raj Bhavan, Karnataka Film Artistes Association, Chamara- jpet. The range of topics that are to be taken up for debate in this edition is a clear indicator to the growing maturity of the festival. We are constantly endeavouring to rise to the expectations of both the film makers and the enlightened audiences. Our endeavour is to ensure that the festival climbs to greater heights and to this effect we have undertaken significant measures to provide festival delegates with the best possible film viewing experience. On this special occasion, I welcome all the Delegates, Juries, Guests and special invitees and wish them a pleasant and meaningful week at BIFFES. DR. P S HARSHA, IPS Comissioner, Department of Information and Public Relations, Govt. of Karnataka Festival Executive Director Or BIFFES & i ARTISTIC DIRECTOR The process of selection of films for the festivals is not only becoming more and more challenging with the increasing quality of the projects, but also high- ly demanding in terms of Social content. Added to their strong sociological core, Independent Cinema is donning the activist role as an ethical alternate to the sullied image of the current political discourses. They are also evolving rapidly in terms of technological innovation and also as to how films can look better for less money. The significant aspect of these alternative voices and points of view, is their aggressive claim on the festival platforms to dissemi- nate their thought processes beyond the local or National boundaries. Cinema by nature is Global in its reach but in its detail it is predominantly rooted in a local milieu. Its potential to place the ‘Immediate Present’ into the creative intellectual discourse and to explore the contemporary themes go far beyond the possibilities in other Art forms and far deeper than in Newsreels and journalistic reportage. The films like “Insyriated”, “Insult” from Lebanon, “Excavator” from Korea, “Loveless” from Russia , “Father and Son” from Vi- etnam, “A sort of a Family” from Argentina, “Directions” from Bulgaria, “The Other side of Hope” from Finland on show in this edition of BIFFes are only a few examples to view and understand the human dilemmas of our times across the globe under one platform. It is widely proclaimed that Human rights are rights inherent to all human beings and also that it is inalienable. But the principle is more often breached than practiced even in democratic set ups. So is the concept of Social Jus- tice. Though it is generally thought of as a world which affords individuals and groups fair treatment and an impartial share of the benefits of society inequality persists in all types of political formations. BIFFes takes a critical look at these concepts through a bouquet of documentaries and features. This is the thematic value addition to this edition. The kaleidoscope of Cinema of the World, Competition sections, Country Foci, Director's retrospectives and all other programs of earlier era will continue. We are proud to record that BIFFes has completed a decade of its fruitful existence. We welcome all of you to share our happiness and satisfaction. The film loving public of Bengaluru, the founding organization Suchitra Film Soci- ety and all its erstwhile committee members, the Chairpersons of Karnataka Chalanachitra Academy Mr. Nagabharana, Ms. Tara and Mr. Rajendrasingh Babu, Previous Artistic Directors Mr. Girish Kasaravalli and Mr. Narahari Rao, the officials of the Department of Information and Public Relations, Karnataka Government and the young boys and girls who have volunteered all through the years to sustain this event for so long deserve special mention on this occasion.
