        "text": "Ali Farahi, who’s popularly known as Sina Farahi, has been getting a lot of momentum on social media.\n\nBorn on November 7, 1988, in Tehran, he pursued his education in Computer hardware engineering in Tehran. However, despite being an engineering student, he was inclined towards the world of digital media. That saw a change in his work and since early 2009 he has been active on social media platform Facebook. After understanding several aspects of digital media, he founded a Persian digital media agency. With novel ideas, his company saw decent growth in the digital world.\n\nToday, we live in a world where people have access to the content which has no limit. Keeping this in mind, Ali wants to give his audience the content which works best according to the latest trends. With the ever-growing and ever-changing content, the digital influencer has been open to experimenting with new ideas. Talking about it he said, “Today’s era is growing at a rapid pace and digitalization is reaching new heights. As an influencer, I make sure to create the content which has a universal appeal and due to cut-throat competition I need to make sure that my content stands apart from all.”\n\nThe influencer has set a benchmark for himself by creating relatable content not just for himself but also for his clients. His expertise in social media saw him become the social media manager of Varzesh3 website in 2013 after which he became a manager of Fast Click agency in 2015. After getting a good experience at a manager level, he co-founded a startup called Tag Star with Rambod Javan, one of the most renowned celebrities of Iran.\n\nApart from this, in 2018 he unveiled the biggest teacup of the world in Iran. In the same year, he established Hashtag Media Company which is known for many successful advertising campaigns in Iran. Ali’s goal is to make some interesting and relatable content according to the taste of the general public. With having limited resources, it took a little time for Ali Farahi to climb the ladder of success but nothing could stop this influencer to follow his passion."
