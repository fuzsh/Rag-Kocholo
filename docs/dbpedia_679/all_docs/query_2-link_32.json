(This may seem like a dumb observation, since everyone knows that the Greek gods acted like bonobos on a regimen of poppers. But, hey, the man conquered Persia by the age of 25, and I just wasted 10 minutes coming up with a joke about monkeys on alkyl nitrates. I yield the point.) My own morning routine is a fugue of mortal reminders, of proof in the Law of Entropy as It Applies to My Face. Take the daily bathroom mirror crisis. Every week sees another outbreak of hair along the ridge of my ear, out of the inner sanctum of my nostrils, from an eyebrow that looks increasingly like a tasered weasel. Crow’s feet spread into elaborate diagrams of crow’s dance steps, a waltz swelling into a dermatological rumba. Since the eyes are windows on the soul, my soul is apparently made of watered down tomato juice. And that’s what I see after my first cup of coffee. It’s human nature to want to dam the flow of time, to patch one’s crumbling hide with unicorn blood or Creme de la Mer. Hence my growing expenditures on hair product. And hence this health and beauty issue. Because, while you can embrace decay in the wisdom that the universe is transient, there’s more honor in taking up arms— or at least moisturizers— against a sea of troubles.

Kristen Thibeault, chef and proprietor of Kombu Kitch¬ en, launched her Lynn-based delivery service in March, aiming to bridge the gap between easy and healthful eating. Her mission: “To show the world that plant-based food can stand up against the finest popular cuisine,” says the nutrition and wellness counselor. Thibeault introduces a new menu — five entrees, a vegetable, soup, breakfast and dessert every week, deliveringthe food to local clients’ doorsteps and shipping national orders. “Living healthy is not an all or nothing kind of thing, ” says Thibeault. “We can change a few things every day and see monumental shifts in our lives.” But don’t tie-dye your cashmere just yet. Plant-based diets aren’t confined to activists. “I own a closet full of 6-inch designer shoes and not one pair of Birken- stocks,” says Thibeault, “so it’s not really a hippie thine ” hannah lott-schwartz § 1 F\\ 'fife U 1 Um l V .1 _ ■ 8 THE IMPROPER BOSTONIAN Good Eats QUITE THE MOUTHFUL With the cold weather settling in, it’s time to hunker down at YoMawithabowlof ohnnohkohswe. Don’t be intimidated by the name. The Burmese dish, which translates to chicken coconut noodle soup, is a relative of the more familiar Thai curries, but this dish reduces the spice, ramps up the heartiness and brims with springy wheat noodles. Sharpened with sliced raw shallots and a squirt of limejuice, ohnnohkohswe is at least as good for the soul as the usual chicken soup. Just way more interesting.

But what makes you think your busi¬ ness is more important than mine? Why are you giving me this look as if I’m taking forever, and I should let you go ahead of me? Maybe I have an important place to be. I probably don’t, but your judgmental facial expressions are unnecessary. Out of line? To Instagram users: I’m stressed, and my social anxiety has reached new heights. I don’t understand why it’s so important for everyone to have more followers than people they are following. Just follow me back! I’m self-conscious about the fact that you’ll look at my page and see less than 100 followers and judge me. I prom¬ ise you will enjoy my photos. I’m funny and use filters wisely. Just follow me back. Neu; user To Dana on Showtime’s original hit series Homeland: Why do you always look like you’ve just received the worst news ever? Your constant facial concern and indeci¬ siveness is distracting us from what really matters: your father’s inability to move his mouth normally.

Which requires more training: being a cheforaMMA fighter? It’s like anything in life, you have to practice every day to be really good at it. And if you take time off, you’re not progressing, you’re regressing. I'd say with culinary arts and martial arts it’s the same thing. If I’m not out there always look¬ ing at new ingredients andtalkingtochefs, you get a little stale. I’d say the same thing with mixed martial arts. Luckily for me, because [my trainer] fights in the UFC, [he] trains with all high-level fighters. He travels all the time. He’ll fight in Vegas; he’ll fight in Seattle; he’ll fight all over. He brings back all these great moves. Like, it’sjust never-ending. You can practice itfor 20, 30 years and still not know it all, believe it or not. I feel like culinary arts are the same way. How do you prepare for your martial arts competitions? I weigh about 203 pounds. I was 205 yesterday, I’m 203 today, but it stays right around there. But we’ll see, tonight I’ll be 205 again. I’ll fight at 185, so I’ll diet down to 195, and then about two days before the fight I’ll cut 10 pounds. It basi¬ cally happens overnight. I go in a sauna. All the water comes out of you, soyou look all lean and ripped. Duringthat period, I drinkagallon of water every day. The week before [the sauna], I start drinking two gallons, and, believe it or not, that helps get the water out of you. How do you incorporate your healthy lifestyle into your cooking? Ijust put a menu item on a month ago, and we call it skinny salmon. We tried to come up with a name for it to do itjustice, but it’s pistachio- crusted salmon, organic brown rice, aspara¬ gus and then it gets goji berry vinaigrette. It’s a superfruit from China, and it has antioxidants and vitamins B and C. The nutrients in it are ridiculous. I’ve made a mangosteen vinaigrette, I garnish some of my specials with hemp seed. It’s very high in protein and omega 3 fatty acids, which are very good for your heart and your cardiovascular system. Do you crave any specificjunk food while you’re training? Chocolate chip ice cream and milk chocolate. Just, like, plain blocks of chocolate. I could eat it with a fork and a knife, you know? HANNAH SHEINBERG First Taste BON APPETIT T’S BEEN JUST OVER TWO years since Patrick Lynch and Ali Fong’s Vietnamese concept, Bon Me, was named a winner in the first Boston Food Truck Challenge. In that time, their mobile family has grown with a second truck, and the husband-and-wife team show no signs of braking soon. In fact, they’re taking a new road. Come mid-January, Bon Me’s first stand¬ still location opens in Kendall Square— a fitting space for a kitchen born of a competition to promote innovation. “We’re really excited to be able to operate on this side of the river,” says Lynch, who’s been food-trucking full-time since Bon Me’s debut in April 2011. “The big upside of the restaurant is that we have that long¬ term outlook. We’re able to really invest in an area, which is a little tough for trucks.” The new menu is largely based on the truck’s dishes — bahn mi sandwiches, soba or rice noodle salads and rice bowls topped with Asian veggies and a choice of spice- rubbed chicken, barbeque pork or tofu and shiitake mushrooms. But Fong, who trained at the Culinary Institute of America and worked for Patricia Yeo at Sapa in New York, wants to explore the benefits of a stationary kitchen. “Having a brick- and-mortar location means we can do things that we can’t do on the truck,” she explains. Fong’s experimenting with daily specials and sides like mustard greens with chili oil and kabocha squash soup. “We’re going to ramp up a lot of our vegetarian and vegan options,” she adds. A new pate for the bahn mi will also debut. Developed by an employee for a class, the mushroom-based vegan spread gives veg-head diners a similar Bon Me experience to their carnivorous counterparts. With an order-at-the-counter setup and food ready in minutes, the restau¬ rant seats 15-20 and another 10 outside during warmer months. Setting up shop doesn’t mean anything is slowing down for Lynch and Fong, who are already thinking ahead to more mo¬ bile possibilities. The plan is to just keep on truckin’.

PRICE: $10 INGREDIENTS: Old Smokey Apple Pie Moon¬ shine, Carriage House Apple Brandy, apple cider, sweet vermouth. quickly slides into a clean, mellow balance with rounded, boozy notes on the back. Far less cloying than a bottle of Woodchuck, this isn’t an apple drink to tempt the innocent. It’s for grown-ups. BALANCE: Extremely fine. Served neat, the moonshine is as sweet as Drambuie. “It has a lot of cinnamon and sugar,” explains bartender Lillian Schmertz. But the brandy slices through the sugar while the vermouth gives the whole a fruity polish. PRESENTATION: Served over ice in a mason jar, with an apple-ringgarnish, this is the cultural opposite of martini service. It’s practically a declaration of yokel pride. “We’re big into the South,” says Schmertz. LOCALSOURCING: “Boston trends toward the seasonal,” says Schmertz. “We get the apple cider from Carlson Orchards in Harvard, and we’ll run [the drink] until we can’t get cider anymore.” So until the apple harvest runs out, the Rocky Top bestrides the cocktail menu’s summit of popularity. PAIRITWITH: Barbecue, of course. “It pairs well with the richness,” says Schmertz. “With pork belly, but also with desserts like butterscotch.” andrewrimas TASTE: Its ontological apple-ness is cider, not juice, so the initial sip is subtly tart. The fruit iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiimiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiimiiiiiiiiiii Beauty A Char, Char Better Thing A facial cleanser made with activated charcoal might sound like an inflammatory idea, but vegan skincare and beauty line Shamanuti’s Activated Charcoal Cleanser fights fire with fire. Oxygen-treated carbon’s super-porous properties act like a magnet for impuri¬ ties, drawing them out of your skin. Though the wash resembles gray sludge, it goes on mostly clear, with the brightening and exfoliating properties of the charcoal washing away weary winter skin. It’s ideal for treating sensitive spots, rosacea, eczema or just banishing that patch of dry under-eye skin c by cranked up radiators. You can also use the soot-inspired product as a deodorizing body wash or shaving cream. Just don’t try to use it to light your grill— we haven’t product tested for that yet. SHAMANim 368 Broady way, Cambridge (617-661-0280) shamanuti.com JENNIFER JACKSON WITH A CLAUSE New projects from big names WORD HAS IT THAT that the folks behind Water¬ town’s Strip-T’s will open a second restaurant in the Tamarind Bay space in Brookline’s Washington Square. However, chef/co-owner Tim Maslow is reluctant to spill the details. “It’s a confidential deal,” he says. But applying for a liquor license means giving up information such as the name of the business (Ribelle, Italian for rebel). Maslow does reveal that the restaurant will have close to 70 seats and, permits pending, seasonal outdoor dining. He won’t provide an opening date (“that’s a no-no”), but eventually allows he’d “love to open in March.” What Maslow would like best, he says wist¬ fully, “is to be that guy who opens quietly in the middle of the night.” Fat chance. ANOTHER PROJECT SURE TO ATTRACT attention is the takeover of the former Paddock space in Somerville by chef Ana Sortun (Oleana, Sofra). Slated for a summer opening, the as-yet-untitled— “It has a few names,” says Sortun— eatery will feature an all mezze menu and a “big bar” starring “big cocktails.” Cassie Piuma, chef de cuisine at Oleana (and an 11-year vet of Sortun’s 12-year- old Cambridge restaurant) will be both chef de cuisine and Sortun’s partner in the new venture. AFTER THE HOLIDAY CHAOS, AND IN the midst of winter’s chill, comes the perfect time to savor hearty fare like soups, stews and braises, as well as curl up with an enticing new cook¬ book. Stemed, the latest from chef Dave Becker of Sweet Basil (with stunning photography by Nina Gallant) fills the bill, and boasts a kitchen-friendly rub¬ ber cover. Dan Watkins Dan Watkins Hit'iiidkKfiiiim 11 THE IM PROPER BOSTONIAN 13 Diet Hard THE COTTON BALL DIET Of all the inedible things we put into our bodies (R.I.P. Twinkies), cotton balls should never be one of them. Purportedly used by model wannabes and those without taste buds, the diet necessitates the white puffs be dipped in gelatin or juice and then swallowed. They’ll fill you up (like a teddy bear) while providing all the nutrition you’d expect from a product more often used to remove makeup. HALLELUJAH DIET This one’s based on Genesis, 1:29: “And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed. ..to you it shall be for meat.” Reverend George Malkmus interpreted this as a higher plan for a strict vegan diet that’s 85 percent raw. This is a great choice for those who skip dessert but never miss a service. PURPLE FOOD DIET If you’ve ever asked yourself WWMCD (What Would Mariah Carey Do), here’s your answer. Purple foods, such as beetroots, plums and eggplant, supposedly rejuvenate the skin and help you maintain a steady weight— or so says many a celeb. Of course, there’s the problem of grape soda, purple Dum Dums and anything that comes out of Willy Wonka’s factory. TAPEWORM DIET Before you start to squirm, just think— unless you’re vegan or vegetarian, you eat animals anyway, right? Add a little tapeworm to your fried chicken and you’ll soon be eating guilt free. The tapeworm diet has been around since the dawn of dieting itself and now comes in a handy-dandy pill form. Downside: You’re eating tapeworms. FAD ABOUT YOU Some people will try anything to fit into their high school jeans— though few will admit to a diet of straight baby food or that lemon juice/cayenne pepper/maple syrup concoction. Here are some of the more questionable— and creative— fad diets that lasted about as long as the sugar high from a cranberry cocktail cleanse. leora yashari Wine Small Wonders If you’re looking for a potion to warm you on a January night, the mis¬ leadingly named petite sirah (not at all petite, not syrah) may be just the thing. This big California red regularly tips the scales at over 14 percent alcohol, but in recent years, winemakers have learned how to tame the beast. Today, the best examples are so concentrated with black fruit flavors that they achieve harmony and balance. The fol¬ lowing blind-tasting winners are worth a look, especially if you need a match for a hearty stew on a wintry evening. TWO ANGELS PETITE SIRAH, high valley, 2007 «si8. wine emporium) This blockbuster comes from a mountain vineyard. Opaque in color, there’s a lush, velvety richness and distinctive notes of black pepper and licorice to accent the chocolaty, plummy fruit. Here’s a delicious wine that shows off what petite sirah does best: provide intense flavor without the mouth-gripping tannins you might expect. BOGLE PETITE SIRAH, California, 2010 ($12, martvs, newton) A huge bargain, this petite sirah is sourced from Sacramento Delta vineyards. It has a smoky, fruity aroma along with that signature black pepper note. It’s velvety and soft on the palate with a supple richness. The tannins are mild, and the flavors exude crushed red and black berries. This could be one of the better retail bargains of the season. GIRARD PETITE SIRAH, napa valley 2010 ($30, Bauer wine and spirits) This is a massive, mouth- filling wine that shows the gamey, meaty side of the grape. An old vine blend with flavors of wild mushroom, bacon and the same dark chocolate lushness you find in other petite sirahs, the Girard also features substantial tannins. It’s a handcrafted, extremely full-bodied wine aged 19 months in barrel to soften its intensity. A great candidate for collecting, this bottle will mellow and develop some finesse over a decade in the cellar. MASTER OF WINE SANDY BLOCK IS VICE PRESIDENT OF BEVERAGE OPERATIONS FOR LEGAL SEA FOODS Purveyors CONTAINABLE ENTHUSIASM Samira and Ragab Hamdoun never planned to sell their hummus, but they took the leap after constant raves from family and friends.

But business quickly outgrew that corner of the market, and the couple set up shop in Belmont, expand¬ ing their wares to include a variety of handmade Middle Eastern favorites, including Egyptian ful medammes (gar¬ licky mashed fava beans with tahini, lemon and olive oil) and the sweet, tangy roasted red pepper-walnut dip known as muhammara. This month, the Hamdouns are launching a full takeout menu, complete with soups and shawarma. All it took was one tasty dip, and now their business is spreading.

But in Bob Spitz’s cozy, chatty book it’s amazing to discover how long this dynamo struggled to get Mastering the Art of French Cooking published. The Paris Cordon Bleu cooking school hadn’t been welcoming to this future star. Julia also battled with her French coauthors while maintaining their important, even loving relationship.

When WGBH gave Julia her French Chef show, with that signature voice trilling merrily in the upper registers, she managed to combine French culinary rigor with humor and homey charm. Husband Paul, a quirky intellectual and artist, was the man behind the woman. Julia went on to gigantically influence chefs, restaurants, cookbooks, television and taste. As food tilted toward skinnier nouvelle cuisine she persisted with her rich buttery ways. But, never one for stuffiness, she eventually adapted. **x FROM PAGE 347: Everywhere she went— in the subway, or in stores, or on the street, or in elevators, or in business offices— people stopped to congratulate her and tell her how much they enjoyed the show.

FIT OF PEAK A Piton on St. Lucia, viewed from Boucan by Hotel Chocolat a YOU SHOULD SEETHE mangos in St. Lucia,” said the cab driver on the way to Logan Air¬ port. “The juice just drips down your hands.” St. Lucia, nicknamed the Helen of the West Indies, is a 27-mile-long island of mountainous rain forest, with the 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 pair of lush twin Pitons acting as the destination’s gateway. Though it’s praised as one of the world’s top locations for honeymooners, the real passion here is in how the St. Lucians feel about their food, culture and the Jurassic Park- type scenery that can’t be captured by a Canon. Hotels and restaurants obsessively incorporate the natural surroundings into their architecture and cuisine, turning themselves into vessels for the tourism board. Even if mangos aren’t on the menu, you can taste a clear sense of place. St. Lucia is the product of a drawn out tug-of-war between the French and British. The natives speak fluent English, but also a Creole mixture of broken French called Patois. There’s a lot of English influence at Boucan by Hotel Chocolat, located on the outskirts of Soufriere (a French name, of course). The hotel, which ✓ Traveler’s Checks * There are only two main roads through St. Lucia, one on the west and one on the east. Some hotels can pick passengers up from the airport via helicopter to shorten the trip. * Due to the open layout, Boucan by Hotel Chocolat provides mosquito net bed¬ ding and complimentary insect repellent. started as a chain of chocolate shops in the United Kingdom that now stretches all the way to Newbury Street, is built on a 268-year-old 140-acre cocoa plantation called the Rabot Estate. The decor is the exact opposite of what you’d imagine if Wonka or Hershey owned a tropical resort. Here, rooms are polished in understated, rich cacao tones, and ■ 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 the entire space is open to the outdoors, most noticeably in the open-sky rainforest shower made with slabs of rock and small stones. The lobby itself acts as merely a frame for the Petit Piton, the steeper of the two prominent mountains. There’s chocolate in literally every dish on the menu, complete with a grinder full of cocoa nibs on each table, but the best way to attain death by chocolate is the hotel’s Tree to Bar experience. Like something out of a Kashi commer¬ cial, guests chop down their own cocoa pods with long-stemmed machetes before sampling the mucous-like seeds inside, which surprisingly taste like lychee. The next stop is the greenhouse-style nursery where the cocoa ferments, dries and roasts. Guests also graft their own cocoa trees, which are identified, so the staff can find the exact plant on a return trip. Later, the hotel’s SWEET SUITES The Rainforest Spa at Sugar Beach. chef demonstrates how to make 65 percent dark chocolate by grinding cocoa nibs, cocoa butter and powdered sugar with a mortar and pestle. After some not so sweet, sweat-inducing labor, guests leave with a bar of their own creation. The St. Lucian landscape resembles the verdant, volcanic terrain of Hawaii more than it does the surrounding Caribbean islands. Roads are carved precariously into the banana-leaf lined mountains, so the easiest (and safest) way to admire the jungle is on Rain Forest Adven¬ tures’ open-air tram. Set up like an amusement park ride, the tram glides through all four densely covered layers of the forest and reaches more than 1,400 feet above sea level. If you’re more comfortable below the canopies, try the Rainforest Spa at Sugar Beach. Wedged be¬ tween the two Pitons, this resort is made up of seven tree house treatment rooms built into the forest at varying heights above a small stream. The miniature log cabins feel like the inside of a tree trunk, and the services include all natural elements from the island, such as bananas, coconuts and even mud from the nearby sulfur springs. Castries, the capital port city in the north, is the most metropolitan part of the island with a population of 65,000 (a number inflated by tourists). Most towns and villages have a Saturday market— Castries’ is open everyday except Sundays. Even though the pavilion is clogged with cruise shippers, it’s worth merging with the masses to find vendors selling indig¬ enous fruits that they’ll gladly slice open at their stands. Try the skull-sized avocados, the boiled red nuts and the soursop, an island fruit with a prickly green surface and a cream-col¬ ored fibrous center. Orange-yellow coconuts, purchased from the trunks of trucks, are whacked with machetes so customers can gulp down the water inside. With its poetic greenery and simple, savory flavors, St. Lucia is a powerful aphrodisiac.

LEE } HAUTE PROPERTY Asana has transcendent moments under chef Rachel Klein. COLOR PALATE Black cod with fish roe is a refined dish to enjoy in an elegant dining room. AMED FOR THE SANSKRIT word for a yoga position, Asana found its culinary tranquility— or perhaps complacency— stirred when Rachel Klein took over the role of execu¬ tive chef last March. Prior to Klein, who helmed Om’s kitchen at its peak and previously served as executive chef at Aura at the Seaport Boston Hotel, Asana offered safe, swanky hotel food— the equivalent of a fancified P.F. Chang’s for the masters of the universe staying at the Mandarin Oriental. There was the $50 steak, the $30 chicken, the $30 fish. The dishes, like the polished wood and drap¬ ery, reflected a generic Asian-ish sen¬ sibility. While those stand-bys remain, Klein has introduced an elegant, confi¬ dent sense of place with a menu shifted to a more seasonal, local focus. Take the outstanding New England clam chowder ($9), a tureen of minced clams, cream and chives with a subtly briney stock evocative of a satisfying day on the ocean. It’s an ideal lunch when paired with the exceptional bread basket, comprising rolls and crisps so airy that they melt like spun sugar in your mouth. The gnocchi ($15, appetizer; $27, entree) was hearty winter fare, with tender potato pasta topped with salty gouda and duck confit, sweet diced apples and sauteed Brussels sprout leaves. Earthy and savory, it tasted delicious despite lacking the advertised duck cracklings. In contrast, the moulard duck ($33) looked beautiful— with a perfectly crackled scored breast surrounded by Brussels sprouts and a sweet date sauce— but was starkly undercooked (although ordered medium rare). On the other hand, the ridiculously priced Brandt strip steak ($46) arrived medium-rare as ordered, but the meat proved on the chewy side. Sizable at 14 ounces, the slab of rather bland beef lacked marbling and was a workout for the jaw. The black cod dish ($29)— a visually stunning canvas of white and red— embodied the best of Klein’s cooking. Tender cod and root vegetables floated in a dashi broth with red fish roe and a topping of sesame-chili kale crisps evoking nori. Like the chowder, it was reminis¬ cent of the sea without being overbearing. Not every seafood dish impressed as much. The hamachi sashimi ($16) overreached, the fish being overwhelmed by pickled shiitakes and spicy dried- cherry togarashi, while the ubiquitous deep-fried Brussels sprout leaves made this appetizer a study in superfluity. The most disappointing item was a yellowfin tuna melt with truffle cheese ($15) at lunch. The meat was so generic it could’ve been stuffed inside a blue plate special. If you’re at Asana for lunch, pay a little more and get the gooey, luxurious, fork-and-knife short rib sandwich ($18), a slow-braised concoction served with caramelized onions over sourdough. Unlike some of the more truncated openers — the beet appetizer ($14), for example— the sandwich was very generously sized, and it arrived overlaid with arugula, negating the need for a vegetable starter. Klein oversees the dining operations of Asana, M Bar, the Mandarin and its residences, a job that requires the juggling of competing demands. She has to meet the expectations of traveling CEOs looking to conspicuously consume a strip steak with a $18 cocktail (the Stately Romance, with its Earl Grey-infused gin, is a pricey treat). She has to appeal to food nerds hoping to see the flashes of brilliance she showed at Om, along with turning out more value-conscious, neighborhood fare for the after-work crowd. Asana’s food, under Klein, is better than ever. Yet the patches of unevenness on the menu suggests that a hotel restaurant, even a fine one, isn’t always the best setting for her gifts. * x n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The most common New Year’s resolution is to slim down. If you have an extra inch or two, or would like to jump-start a more serious slim-down, there is an instant gratification method of body contouring. Bella Contour is a new non- surgical way to reduce unwanted body fat and inches. Our treatment utilizes ultrasound energy to stimulate fat cells, causing the fat cells to empty their contents and shrink back to their original size. This body contouring treatment is ideally suited for women and men who have unwanted fat around the waist, love handles, buttocks, and thighs. The treatment is comfortable; it feels like a warm massage. It is extremely safe, non-invasive, completely pain-free, there is literally no recovery or downtime, and no known side-effects. 4 to IO sessions are required, and at SkinHealth, we typically see results even after the first treatment!

Based on the novel by Victor Hugo. Adapted from the musical by Claude -Michel Schonberg and Alain Boubil. Screenplay by William Nicholson. Directed by Tom Hooper. { SEAN BURNS } MISERY HAS COMPANY Tom Hooper’s take on the Broadway classic is anything but revolutionary. NE OF THE STUPIDEST decisions in the history of the Academy Awards was the coronation of Tom Hooper two years ago. For helming The King’s Speech, a perfectly forgettable (and rather appallingly photographed) bit of awards bait from the Weinstein Company, Hooper was elevated above contemporaries like David Fincher, Darren Aronofsky, David 0. Russell and the Coen Brothers. Hooper, a BBC mainstay also known for directing HBO’s John Adams miniseries, did not take the honor lightly. He’s used his newfound clout to tackle an impossible mission— the long-awaited adaptation of the ever-running Les Miserables, Claude-Michel Schonberg and Alain Boubil’s stage produc¬ tion that has stymied filmmakers for the 27 years it has packed in more than 60 million happy customers. The financial success of this film is a foregone conclusion, as are the inevitable awards-season hosannas. This is regrettable because Les Miserables is nearly unwatchable. “It’s like an exercise in how not to direct a film,” I jotted in my notes shortly after the screening. The showing was, of course, packed with studio-selected musical theater aficiona¬ dos who stood and applauded after every number until the tedium set in, and even this handpicked crowd could no longer bother to feign enthusiasm. For the benefit of anyone who hasn’t encountered Victor Hugo’s story in any of its incarnations over the years, Hugh Jackman stars as Jean Valjean, a noble fellow who did too many years of hard labor after stealing a loaf of bread, which earns him the enmity of Russell Crowe’s inexhaustible tyrant cop, Javert. There’s much ado about Anne Hatha¬ way’s Fantine, a willowy young lass with an infant daughter adrift in squalor and prostitu¬ tion. Somewhere in this soap opera, the Paris Uprising of 1832 breaks out, and many, many, many years go by. Schonberg and Boubil’s songs are catchy earworms— there’s a reason this thing has remained on stage for decades. But if there’s a more poorly directed film this year, I haven’t seen it. Hooper has a problematic affinity for wide-angle lenses and the handheld camera. Plus, somewhere along the way, a decision was made to make Les Miserables “gritty.” Gone is any sense of Broadway spectacle. Instead we’re stuck with grimy, under-popu¬ lated soundstage sets and shaky close-ups. Rather than embracing the artifice of musical theater, Hooper goes miles in the opposite direction. It’s deliberately drab, with the shaky camerawork and overall ugliness attempting to provide a “realistic” sensation, which seems awfully silly since every singer is backed up by an off-screen orchestra. It’s a disastrous approach to the material. Hooper has about three shots in his reper¬ toire, so every scene begins with the camera swooping down from a great height and then clinging nervously to the performers who are forced to sing entire numbers in off-kilter close-ups. For no apparent reason, Hooper often films with several feet of headroom, calling your attention to the empty top of the frame. He occasionally alternates this ap¬ proach with shots that cut the actors off at the eyebrows. The movie looks like it is improp¬ erly projected, and yet these were deliberate choices. Much has been made of the fact that the cast was recorded singing live on set, as opposed to lip-syncing pre-recorded tracks, as is the norm with movie musicals. This has become a selling point and would be down¬ right revolutionary, if we all decided to pretend that Peter Bogdanovich’s At Long Last Love and James Brown’s number in The Blues Brothers never existed. Hooper keeps the camera locked into a fisheye view of everybody’s nostrils just to prove they’re really singing, goddamnit. But maybe he should have reconsidered and realized that uncut tracks of Russell Crowe hoarsely flubbing notes are “authentic” in the worst way possible. Crowe will probably be singled out as the whipping boy, if only because, like Pierce Brosnan in Mamma Mia, he often sounds like a farm animal in the midst of strangulation. But besides an honest-to-gawd, jaw-dropping turn from Anne Hathaway, who outclasses everyone and drops the mike a half hour into this thing, Les Miserables is just plain lousy filmmaking. This movie is constricted, claustrophobic and all around unpleasant watch. When newcomer Samantha Barks does her best to win us over with the karaoke staple “On My Own,” Hooper can’t even keep her head in the shot.

Erin McKeown plays the Brighton Music Hall on Jan. 17. RIN MCKEOWN’S PLUGGED in on a deeper level than many of her peers. She not only markets her music online but also lobbies policy makers to preserve a free and open Internet. She directs these activities from her rural cabin between Northampton and Becket. “It’s not like I don’t have running water, but it’s pretty rustic,” McKeown says other home, where she has webcast her “Cabin Fever” concert series since 2009. She usually sings in her living room with guests like Sonya Kitchell and Ryan Montbleau, although— speaking of running water— McKeown once broadcast from a stool in the river next to her yard, with guitar in hand and feet in the current. “It was such a stupid idea,” she says, “and it was so fun.” The Skype-styled series began before the rise of Kickstarter or PledgeMusic as a sort of telethon to raise funds for her 2009 album, Hundreds of Lions. For her terrific Manifestra, out Jan. 15, McKeown turned to PledgeMusic, raising enough in money six days to pay for the album and more by offering packages like signed records, fantasy baseball consultations and house concerts. “I have 600 [packages] to make, and that’s far more than I ever expected,” says McKeown, 35. “It’s a good thing that the last job I had before being a musician was working in a warehouse for a music distributor, more than 15 years ago. So I know a thing or two about shipping.” The singer/songwriter knows something about recording as well, having made several albums that bridge folk and pop with gospel, electronica and swing jazz. “I’ve never thought what I did was folk music— maybe in the broad sense that I’ve always been part of a community of musicians,” says McKeown, who majored in ethnomusicology at Brown University. “But a long time ago, I got past any desire to fight about it.” McKeown’s genre-bending sound reaches maturity on Manifestra, poised to stand as one of the first great albums of 2013. It’s her second self-produced effort, recorded with her usual touring musicians: drummer Marc Dalio and saxophonist Matt Douglas, as well as bassist/ cellist Jeff Hill and keyboardist Erik Deutsch, who favors a Wurlitzer electric piano. Mc¬ Keown plays a hollow-body electric guitar. A string trio arranged by violinist Joseph Brent also colors the moody, playful and provocative album. “I used the exact same palette for this record, except that I turned up the distortion,” says McKeown, who launches a U.S./U.K. tour at the Brighton Music Hall on Jan. 17. “Manifestra just has an edge and a snarl to the sounds more than the last record. I don’t know why, except that’s what my ears were hungry for.” The concept of change seeps into the album, as well as a search for truth, trust and justice. There’s even a New Orleans-flavored cabaret tune called “That’s Just What Happened.” She says the first lines of the song “Manifestra” came to her in a dream, much the way the track’s title popped into her head. “I never doubted it, like ‘Do I mean manifesto?— no, it’s a manifestra,”’ McKeown says. “Opera’s in there; manifesto’s in there; and I love the word fenestra, which means window. There’s a kind of opening in it for me.” McKeown increasingly opens up to politics in her even-toned voice. She targets immigra¬ tion policy in “The Jailer.” She seeks account¬ ability on interconnected battlefields in “Baghdad to the Bayou,” which she co-wrote with longtime friend and MSNBC host Rachel Maddow, who texted imagery from trips to Iraq and Louisiana. McKeown recalls being on Maddow’s talk show after Hurricane Katrina as a personal turning point. “I remember leaving that session thinking, ‘Man, I really want to be able to do this like her,”’ she says. “I want to be able to articulate and have conversation and dialogue about this kind of stuff. It was a real motivator.” She has since stepped up her political activism, particularly on issues affecting musicians. McKeown has visited Capitol Hill, currently serves on the board of the Future of Music Coalition and just completed a year as a fellow at Harvard’s Berkman Center for Internet G Society. “It’s this concept of ‘How do I get in the room where these discussions are?,”’ says McKeown. “A free and open Internet allows me to craft this pretty unique form of expression.” x«« Merri Cyr — « //VO Henne: The future you can have, must have cannot stop until you do have Never stop.

Either way, you need advice, and possibly an IV. People get very excited this time of year, because New Year’s Eve has a lot going for it— imagery of a wizened old man metamor¬ phosing into a sash-wearing baby, balls de¬ scending, cork injuries, the chance to sing the hottest hit of 1788, “Auld Lang Syne.” Speaking of which, let’s refresh ourselves on the lyrics: “Should old acquaintance be forgot, and rah rah arrghg rrahhh blag- gghhh!” Repeat times seven. As a veteran New Year’s Eve partier, the most important advice I can give you is to pretend it’s the eve of Columbus Day. Good ol’ Columbus Eve— not much in the way of inflated expectations there, right? With no pressure to have the Best Night Ever, there’s no disappointment when you merely have a good time with some friends. Cover charges are generally quite manageable, and you don’t see miserable people wearing sunglasses indoors the morning of Colum¬ bus Day. But if you insist on celebrating NYE style, then you have six basic types of party from which to choose. The House Party A New Year’s Eve house party should always be at someone else’s house. Because New Year’s Day mysteries can include, “Where did all the water go from the hot tub?” and “How do you get Champagne off a ceiling?” I attended one soiree where some¬ one thought it would be funny to tuck toilet paper into a drunk guy’s pants as he left the bathroom, so that when he walked around the house it unspooled like a breadcrumb trail. And indeed, that was very funny. Normally, I’d say that after a big night you’d be wise to sleep in, but not after a New Year’s Eve house party. You want to muster all your energy and escape at daybreak to some other lair, lest you find yourself spending the afternoon chiseling the mac ’n’ cheese that got burned onto the pot at 3 am. Or mopping the ceiling. The New York Public Spectacle If you’ve ever been to Times Square for New Year’s Eve, please tell me why it’s fun. Because I’ve seen it on TV, and from my vantage point that whole production looks a lot like standing in the freezing cold with thousands of idiots waiting for a ball to slide down a pole while Seacrest mocks the rabble from on high. I’ll admit I haven’t seen the movie New Year’s Eve, but I presume it’s about New Yorkers bonding over a shared contempt for anyone who goes to Times Square. The Off-Site Party This is the party you throw at a house in Killington or possibly farther away, like U wAA /. : Thailand. It’s all exotic fun until the rude morning wakeup, which is complicated by the fact that you now have to hail a tuk-tuk and make it to the Phuket airport for a 9 am flight to Hong Kong. What were you thinking? The Impossible Expectations Party Your best friend’s birthday is on Jan 1. And she’s turning 30. And she just got a big promotion at work. And her boyfriend is going to propose at midnight. Basically, you need to lock her in a cage like a werewolf and not let her out until the conclusion of the NFL Divisional Playoffs. The “Pretend It’s Not New Year’s Eve” Not-A-Party Instructions: Go out for dinner and half¬ heartedly try to stay up until midnight, but if you don’t make it, no big deal. Then the next morning, you’ll be the bastard who’s smugly walking his dog at 8 am, drinking coffee and saying, “I bet if we left now we could get in a half-day of skiing.” If, on New Year’s Day, you encounter friends who weren’t so prudent, avoid broadcasting your cheerful optimism, or you may get stabbed with the celery stalk from a Bloody Mary. The Bar Party A bar party meets the most basic New Year’s Eve requirement, in that it isn’t at your house (unless you live in a bar, which is either sad or awesome). You’ve got to do your research, though. A few years ago, I ended up at a New Year’s Eve party at a Mi¬ ami club that had a $100 cover and an open bar. Good deal, perhaps? It would’ve been, if there were more than two bartenders on duty to serve a thousand people. At one point I saw a guy try to bribe a bartender $100 just to serve him a drink. Soon after midnight, we all left to go run around on the beach and climb the lifeguard stations while cops shone spotlights on us. So maybe we did manage to get a few drinks. But not as many as we would’ve had on Columbus Eve. x«* ■ 1 1 1 1 ■ 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Think that’s funny?

Oil ROB WILSON The Price Is Right’s only male spokes model tells us about breaking the glass ceiling. IN SEPTEMBER, GRAFTON’S ROB WILSON, 25, MADE TELEVISION history by becoming the first male spokesmodel on TV’s longest-running game show. Born in Framingham, Wilson has landed movie roles in Bride Wars, Surro¬ gates, Friends with Benefits and The Social Network. On television, he has appeared on shows like The Secret Life of the American Teenager, The Middle, Supah Ninjas and Entourage. As a model for Ford, Wilson has been in numerous campaigns as well as music videos for Victoria Justice, Manika, Toni Braxton and David Guetta. He lives in Los Angeles. Jonathan Soroff: Is Bob Barker your patron saint? Rob Wilson: No. Drew Carey is. So you broke the glass ceiling in game shows. How does that feel? It was just an awesome opportunity from the get-go. I like the idea of blazing a trail or leaving a legacy behind, and it’s just amazing to be a part of such an iconic show. When did you start watching The Price is Right? Oh, God, as soon as I could open my eyes and recognize what a TV was. My grandmother helped raise me, and I used to be at her house every day from the age of four or five, sitting next to her and watching it. Before you started on the show, did you haue any idea how huge the gay following was? I had no idea, but obviously if there’s a male model competition, there’s going to be a big gay fan base, and I think they really helped me. So when are you going to start rocking a Speedo instead of the board shorts? [Laughs.] I’m comfortable enough to do it, but for daytime TV, I don’t think it’s going to happen. Have you gotten a lot of fan mail? Absolutely. It’s crazy what’s happened, especially that whole first month. Some of it was cool fan mail from guys and girls. But there’s some creepy stuff, too, for sure. Like? My theatrical agent called and said a collage had arrived. Every photo is of me without a shirt, or in a towel, or whatever, and the person wanted me to sign it, and send it back to him. Do people recognize you on the street? Yeah, a couple of times. Especially around here at the studio and in the gym. Guys always look at guys in the gym to compare themselves. What’s your routine at the gym? I try to eat healthy and work out five times a week. I weight-train. I play basketball. I trained at a boxing gym here in Burbank. Oh, and a lot of sit-ups. Haue the other models helped you out? Absolutely. They’ve been awesome! They kind of held my hand through the whole process and offered me tips. Do you know the MSRP for a PT Cruiser? No, I’m terrible at that. I’d lose most of the games, although I am starting to get better. Which game is your favorite? I’m pretty old school. I get excited when the Plinko comes out. So Vanna White or Meredith Vieira? Oh, I’m going to have to say Vanna because she’s a legend. She made history on that show. Haue either Drew or the other models sexually harassed you? [Laughs.] No. Everybody’s cool. Who makes more money on a typical show— the contestants or you? There are people who walk away with a lot more than me, but mine is consistent. Don’t the contestants haue to pay taxes on the prizes? Y’know what? Yeah. That kind of bummed me out. This poor old lady won a car, a trip, 60 grand in stuff, and then she found out she had to pay taxes at home and here. But at the end of the day, they’re happy; they’ve got a new car. It’s a pretty good deal. I think most people keep the prizes. Haue the prizes gotten a lot nicer? Without a doubt. As soon as Mike Richards took over they stopped giving away Band-Aid removers and started giving away Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci. It’s pretty badass. Do people expect you to be a complete himbo? The cliche is that if you’re a model, you’re shallow and dumb. But after doing enough interviews, I think people see that there’s more to me than just taking my shirt off. Thing you miss the most about Boston? Besides my family? Without question, Italian food. Why do you think you won the male spokes¬ model competition? Maybe my personality, or maybe I had a little more modeling and acting experience, but I also had a badass crew in Boston voting for me. Worst modeling experience? I did a shoot for an online catalogue, and the photographer was foreign. When you do an underwear shoot, you put a sock-like thing over your package to eliminate any chance of your anatomy really showing. So I was doing that, and the guy was like, “No, no, Rob. It’s Holly¬ wood. Show your stuff!” I had to put up a bit of a battle, but it turned out OK. Would you ever do full frontal nudity? No. There’s no need to. Biggest lie on your acting resume? I have a list of skills on there that are a little over the top. It makes me look like a triathlete. There’s weird-ass stuff like pro kayaking. Fantasy loue scene partner? Maybe Adriana Lima in her acting debut. Actor who had you star-struck? I guess my man Justin Timberlake when I did Friends with Benefits. So haue you gotten to spin the big wheel? I did! And guess what? I got the dollar. *hk ■+ FOR MORE from Rob Wilson on misconceptions about male models, go to improper.com. ‘c?^|Couturf nBm) v i>i '•9 »} f |7TiT¥»T«7?? BiSpi Dan Watkins - REFINE * ontor* “IT’S HARD TO REMEMBER THAT TWO YEARS HAS BEEN ONLY TWO YEARS,” says Hayley Barna, 29, co- founder of the cosmetics blockbuster, Birchbox. She and best friend, Katia Beauchamp, 30, launched the company in late 2010. Since then, their “insider access” to high-end beauty products grew from a notion in a New York bathroom to a Harvard Business School model to a multi-million dollar company. The ladies still giggle like girls, but they command a white-hot venture. Birchbox has cornered the online, high-end beauty market with a simple but unique proposition: Women like to sample. (Men do, too, which is why Birchbox recently launched a masculine line.) For $10 a month, subscribers receive a box with four to five top-tier beauty products in sizes generous enough to last about a month. Once the customer has sampled a sufficient range of products to generate a Birchbox profile, the goods are targeted to her, or him. In addition to the customized deliveries, Birch- box’s “360 degree” marketing platform offers online tips, interactive services and sales on full-size merchandise. Some 40 percent of users have purchased full-size versions from the on¬ line shop, which is operated in partnership with more than 400 brands, many of them names like Kiehl’s, Juicy Couture and Elizabeth Arden. In the creation of this cos¬ metic success story, the eureka moment came, ingloriously, around February 2010, when Beauchamp was visiting her Harvard B-school classmate, Barna, at the apartment Barna shared with her best friend, Mollie Chen. Rifling through the medicine cabinet, Beauchamp 36 THE IMPROPER BOSTONIAN Photographed by Clay Patrick McBride came upon a hoard of beauty product samples. “Hayley was low-maintenance,” says Beau¬ champ, a slender, long-haired brunette. “So I figured the samples had to be from Mol- lie,” who worked as a senior assistant editor at Conde Nast Traveler. Chen became Birch- box’s first hire and is now the editorial director. “This is what every woman wants, I thought,” says Beau¬ champ, “to have a beauty editor best friend.” Before they gradu¬ ated in May, Beauchamp and Barna (smaller and more sharply etched than Beauchamp, but with the same billowing locks) used their harvard.edu address¬ es to email brand executives for help, like the CEO of Gurwitch Products, which distributes Laura Mercier, and the CEO of Benefit Cosmetics. Within days, Benefit became the first com¬ pany to sign on. The rudiments of Birchbox, which now has 140 employees, were readied over the sum¬ mer, with a September launch comprising “emailing everyone we know,” says Beauchamp. “And once the first box shipped, we just talked and talked about it. We heard the voice of the consumer. We had a value proposition that cut through the clutter.” And they got course credit for it, too. In October 2010, the com¬ pany — which does not disclose sales figures— caught the eye of venture capitalists, garnering $1.4 million in seed money. It collected another $10.5 million in August 2011, according to the trade press. Where do the founders see it going? “Taking over the world,” says Barna. “There’s so much more to be done,” she adds. Maintaining subscriber growth, fulfilling the new men’s line, building their international divisions. “I can see t-shirts and headphones,” says Barna, listing one clear idea after another. The headphones, she explains, could be a sample set tucked in a men’s box, along with other lifestyle or electronic goods. “Men like to discover, too,” says Barna. The corpo¬ rate name, in fact, was born to conjure gender neutrality, says Kelly Herman, senior manager. Both founders share credit for the idea. In September, in a move that expanded its footprint into Western Europe and gobbled up its competition, Birchbox acquired Paris-based Joliebox (for an undisclosed sum). Jolie- “This is what every woman wants , I thought. To have a beauty editor best friend.” box is several months younger than Birchbox and shamelessly pitched itself as the “French equivalent.” The younger startup acquired mirror service Boudoir Prive from the United Kingdom in December 2011, and Glamourum from Spain in February 2012. “There’s no shortage of ambition around here,” says Barna, who grew up shoulder- to-shoulder with enterprise in Armonk, N.Y., the headquar¬ ters of IBM. Her parents ran a family business, manufactur¬ ing light fixtures, and Barna majored in economics and psychology as an undergradu¬ ate at Harvard, concentrating on behavioral economics and how people make decisions with money. She worked with Bain S Company, Christie’s and Amazon before heading to B-school, where, on the first day, she met Beauchamp. They clicked. “We sat catty corner to each other, and I checked out her nail polish,” recalls Barna. “From there, it was an organic process.” Beauchamp, who hails from Texas, spent Thanksgiving 2009 at Barna’s house, where the germ of an online subscrip¬ tion business began to grow. “I wanted to work on some¬ thing more entrepreneurial,” says Barna, “but I wasn’t set on going out on my own.” Beau¬ champ grew up in El Paso and graduated from Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. (“my first experience on the East Coast”) with a degree in international studies and economics. Before Harvard, she worked in finance and commercial real estate. Birchbox presented the oppor¬ tunity to parlay two of her fa¬ vorite things: beauty and deals. Beauchamp has been married for two years to Greg Beau¬ champ, whom she’s known since elementary school; Barna lives with her boyfriend of two years, Fredrik Maro, a Norwegian entrepreneur. “We’re definitely better friends now than when we started,” says Barna. “It’s like we’re married, with 140 kids.” Carving out separate niches— Beauchamp works more with the brand partners, Barna stays on the strategic side— they keep up the comple¬ ment. “We’re very lucky to be totally aligned in the business,” says Barna. “We have different viewpoints but logic prevails.” Their closeness extends to private time. “We don’t see much of each other during the day,” she continues. “Katia’s out a lot, and I’m in meetings. We do get together on weekends. Last weekend I helped trim her [Christmas] tree, and we played a video game.” Right now, the ladies are fo¬ cused on building the men’s line with partners like the highly successful upscale grooming company, Jack Black. “It’s for a guy who’s looking to take things up a notch,” says Barna, whose older brother works for Birch¬ box, too. “It’s not about just the look, but knowing the details matter. He could be sporty, urban; Birchbox will match his personality.” The model, as Barna says, is “not a demographic, it’s a state of mind.” *** Hair and makeup: Katsumi Matsuo; assistant: Takashi Ash izawa; styl¬ ing: Cliff Hoppus; wardrobe on Katia: Serial Cultura top, Diesel uest, Ios- selliani necklace; on Hayley: Diesel blazer, Billy Reid top, Bing Bang necklace, Michael Spirt o ring.

BLISS SPA’S GINGER RUB, HOWEVER, USES FRESH GINGER AND FOIL IN A MASSAGE that doesn’t look like takeout lunch. Dollops of the spice, which are grinded in a food pro¬ cessor and mixed with essential oils like lavender, peppermint and lemon, are kneaded into the skin as a method of detoxification. And just in case that sushi is hard to stomach, the root is brushed clockwise on the abdomen to aid the digestive system. The rub saturates the skin during a 20-minute foil wrap, followed by a soak and body butter massage after the plant, and its healing properties, has had time to absorb. It s a treatment especially beneficial in the winter, as ginger stimulates the body s circulation and keeps the extremities, like hands and feet, warm, according to Bliss lead technician, Dawn Lamonica.

HANNAH SHEINBERG lissworld.com IMPROPER.COM 39 WHETHER YOU’RE STAVING OFF CIGARETTES OR SUGAR, TREATING BACK PAIN OR MIGRAINES, BOOSTING YOUR LIBIDO OR EGG COUNT, LICENSED ACUPUNCTURIST MELISSA WINTTURI SAYS THAT THERE’S A POINT-AND A NEEDLE-FOR THAT. WITH ROOTS IN CHINA, WHERE HEALERS DEVELOPED THE SKIN-PRICKING practice to correct imbalances in qi, or energy flow, acupuncture wasn’t popular¬ ized in the States until Nixon’s famous trip in 1972. Then, the Watergates— ahem, floodgates— opened. “It can be used to treat just about anything, really,” says Wint- turi, who owns Charles River Acupuncture in Inman Square. “It’s really calming to the nervous system.” Some 15 years before Nixon’s voyage, however, French physician Paul Nogier tweaked the traditional methods, using the ear as a point of focus. With more than 100 points on the organ, the ear links to every part of the body. “The main theory is that those points stimulate the nerves,” Wintturi says. In turn, those nerves affect the targeted area— say, the spleen, for an increase in energy. “After the treatment, I’ll send [clients] home with the press balls, so they can continue the treatment on their own,” she says. These press balls— alternatively called an ear seeds or magnets— are small rounded pieces of stainless steel that are applied to various points on the ear with adhesive after acupuncture. Because frequency is vital to the success of the treatment, these ear seeds act as acupuncture on the go between sessions. “It’s like going to the gym,” says Wintturi, “The more frequently you do it, the faster you’ll see results.” Charles River Acupuncture, 126 Inman St., #4, Cambridge /hit nr i nnm\\ i t • ° AT LEAST NOT FOR WEST BRIDGE CHEF/CO-OWNER MATT Gaudet, an advocate of vegetable-based sauces since working with culinary pioneer Jean-Georges Vongerichten over a decade ago in New York. While animal fats and proteins still take center stage on many New American menus, Gaudet is converting diners to the vegetal pleasures of a less gut-busting, more environmentally friendly diet. “Protein,” he claims, “is better suited as a garnish. It’s not 100 percent sustainable.” Instead of the traditional veal stock and butter, Gaudet uses sweet potatoes as a thickening agent to make a demi-glace for a dish of pork and sweet-potato jus. “It’s not as rich, and vegetables make a brighter sauce,” he says. Besides flavor and health improvements, substituting vegetables for fat also has West Bridge’s diners feeling less full and thereby more likely to try more dishes at the Kendall Square eatery, which encourages tapas-style ordering. Other chefs trend¬ ing away from Escoffier toward escarole include Rendezvous chef/owner Steve Johnson, Bondir chef/owner Jason Bond and Beacon Hill Bistro executive chef Josh Lewin, whose seasonal green sauces comprise ramps and green garlic in the spring and the tops of radishes, turnips and other root vegetables in the winter. LINH TRAN BRlNCAT^&fc/ HANNAH LOTT-SCHWARTZ 40 THE IMPROPER BOSTONIAN I BESIDES BEING KNOWN FOR THEIR STRICT PHYSICAL AND MENTAL REGIMENS AND MILITARY RULE, THE SPARTANS WERE ALSO PRETTY TRENDY. BODY WEIGHT TRAINING, WHICH THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF Sports Medicine declared as one of the dominant exercise fads in 2013, uses one’s own mass as a resistance tool, just like how those Greek warriors, and a shirtless Gerard Butler in 300, prepared for the battlefield back in the B.C. days. Body weight workouts, like push-ups, crunches, squats, lunges, pull- ups and certain yoga positions, don’t require any equipment besides limbs. “If you’re looking to workout and don’t have a lot of money to spend, it’s certainly a viable option,” says Mike D’Angelo, an exercise physiologist and an ESPN MuscleMania Pro. Even though there isn’t any fancy machinery to master, D’Angelo still recommends finding a trainer for those whose joints might need warming up. “Jump¬ ing and ballistic movements spell disaster for most de-conditioned folks... Weekend warriors are sure to get injured.” When executed properly, this retro routine builds strength, endurance and muscle tone. Plus, you’ll be ready for any invading hordes that come your way.

Fitness fanatics are taking notice, as barre studios are sprout¬ ing like mushrooms around town. Exhale Spa, the forerunner to the recent crop, specializes in Core Fusion classes, which com¬ bine elements of barre work with yoga movements to target core muscles. Caitlin Milbury, mind/body manager at Exhale’s Battery Wharf location, was a distance runner before she discovered the challenging workout. Unlike in running or other cardio classes, Milbury claims that “you don’t plateau because the intensity is always there.” She adds, “You can always stay in the position lower or hold it longer.” Many of Exhale’s teachers and staff were drop-ins who became obsessed with the dramatic ways the simple move¬ ments reshaped and transformed their bodies. Instructors guide you through the positions and make adjustments to stretches that make even marathoners’ muscles quiver in pain. The best part of a workout at Exhale’s Battery Wharf location, though, is the complimentary use of its Turkish hammam, where you can recover from your Black Swan torture in the room’s mix oi humidity and dry heat.

Coaching is largely what it sounds like: It’s having a strategist who keeps your goals in view and helps you make the right moves to get there. If applied to problem like, say, a festering work project, it’s like behavioral Sem tex, capable of clearing away the mental blockages between desire and achievement. “We hold a mirror up to a client,” says Aida Bielkus of Health Yoga Life, a Boston yoga studio that offers coaching as well as daily yoga classes. “Our job is to remind our clients that they have the greatness within themselves to heal, to be whole.” Specifically, this means an hour-long phone session in which the coach asks about the client’s most recent gust of negativity, then follows its roots to the origin of the problem. “Our proprietary method shifts people from reactivity to respon¬ sibility, where one has the choice to create change,” says Bielkus. Lest your nostrils wrinkle at the scent of pop psychology, coaching’s effects are tangible. “Our clients say over and over again that one session has done THERE ARE A LOT OF PURPORTED FIXES TO THE PANDORA’S BOX OF RELATIONSHIP TROUBLES AND ADDICTIONS, OF BALLOONING WAISTBANDS AND SKITTISH CEREBRUMS. more for them than anything,” says Bielkus. “It’s for people who are looking to improve their lives, who want to go from just functioning to living to their fullest potential.” ANDREW RIMAS Health Yoga Life’s TLC (Total Life Change) Plan offers unlimited yoga classes and two coaching calls per month Health Yoga Life, 12 Temple St., Boston (857-350-4124) healthyogalife.com EVERYONE’S WATCHED JAPANESE GAME SHOWS AND SEEN THE CONTESTANTS take a padded beam to their lower lumbars before toppling, wincingly, onto their faces.
