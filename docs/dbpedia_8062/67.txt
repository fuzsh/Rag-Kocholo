Woody Allen has cast Jesse Eisenberg, Alec Baldwin and Ellen Page in his next movie, an untitled film that will shoot in Rome this summer, TheWrap has confirmed.

TheWrap previously reported that Penelope Cruz also is starring.

Allen, whose vocal inflections continue to reflect his native New York, is filming in Europe more often.

The actor-writer-director has swapped "Broadway Danny Rose," "Bullets Over Broadway," "Manhattan" and "Manhattan Murder Mystery" for "Vicky Cristina Barcelona" and the upcoming "Midnight in Paris." That movie is set for domestic release May 2.

Eisenberg was nominated for an Oscar for his work in "The Social Network." Page stars in indie "Super"; Baldwin, who played Ed in Allen's 1990 "Alice," was recently cast in "Rock of Ages."

And Cruz won an Oscar for her role in her last Woody Allen film, 2008's "Vicky Cristina Barcelona."
