        "text": "50 films would have been a nice, round number for Woody Allen to quietly end his career with. But it looks like we’re getting another anyway.\n\nFollowing ongoing litigation with Amazon Studios over breach of contract on a four-picture deal spurred in part by Allen’s comments about Harvey Weinstein and revived allegations that Allen molested his daughter Dylan Farrow, Variety reports the director is headed to Spain to begin filming a new project. Allen denies the allegations made by Farrow.\n\nOwing to the controversy, Allen’s last film, “A Rainy Day in New York” was shelved by Amazon but is scheduled to be released in parts of Europe later this year. Amid the kerfuffle, a number of artists who worked with Allen previously expressed their regrets while a slate of other actors defended him.\n\nAllen appears to still be courting A-List talent, with Variety reporting Oscar-winner Christoph Waltz is attached to the still-untitled film. Also appearing are Gina Gershon, Wallace Shawn and Spanish actors Elena Anaya and Sergi López.\n\nThe plot sounds like familiar Allen fare, with Madiapro, the production studio for the film, stating it will be a “comedy-romance” about a married American couple who fall in love with other people after attending the San Sebastián film festival in Spain. The wife falls for a French director and the husband develops feelings for a local Spanish woman.\n\nSpain is a familiar backdrop for Allen, who previously made “Vicky Cristina Barcelona” in the titular city, also with Mediapro.\n\n“At Mediapro we’ve been working with Woody Allen for 14 years. His films, like every project the group produces, have a unique personality,” Mediapro founder Jaume Roures told Variety. “This latest movie has all the ingredients to be right up there along with what we’ve become accustomed to from a director of Woody Allen’s talent: an intelligent script and a first-rate international cast.”\n\nFilming is scheduled to begin July 10."
