        "text": "Michael Emerson has been best known for a while now as the creepy, manipulative (but in his own way heroic) Ben Linus on Lost. We’re guessing he’ll probably be a little bit less Machiavellian when he joins the cast of Woody Allen’s latest, untitled film.\n\nAllen’s still-under-the-usual-Woody-wraps project sees the writer-director returning to the US for the first time since he began his series of European movies a few years ago.\n\nAlmost nothing is known about the movie, aside from the fact that Sally Hawkins will be playing a fun neurotic type, with Cate Blanchett as a more balanced woman.\n\nThe Lost veteran is joining an ensemble that already includes recent Allen veteran Alec Baldwin, Bobby Cannavale and Alexander Kanellakos. It’s predicted to begin shooting this summer in New York and San Francisco.\n\nEmerson, who was last in a wide release with The Legend Of Zorro, has been spending most of his time working on his latest TV show, Person Of Interest, which was co-created by Jonathan Nolan and is produced by JJ Abrams."
