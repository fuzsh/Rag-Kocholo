        "text": "For 25 years, Woody Allen has offered a remarkable outpouring of films using a tightly knit production staff, veterans who considered themselves loyal members of the Allen professional family.\n\nFrom the outset, Mr. Allen yearned to foster the kind of creative ambiance on his movie sets that Ingmar Bergman, one of his idols, had. Like him, Mr. Allen used the same crews and many of the same actors in his films.\n\nNot anymore.\n\nQuietly, within the atmosphere of secrecy and control that marks Mr. Allen's creative decision making, the team that helped fashion movies like ''Annie Hall,'' ''Manhattan'' and ''Hannah and Her Sisters'' has largely broken up amid an intense effort to cut costs and overhaul the management of his operation.\n\nMr. Allen said the changes were entirely the result of cost-cutting measures taken because his highly praised films have not earned money in the United States. Most members of his production staff had been asked to take pay cuts to allow Mr. Allen to create his independently financed movies without the constraints of studio interference. As a result, he said, top staff members were leaving.\n\n''I took a substantial reduction in what I was getting,'' Mr. Allen said on Friday. ''A number of people who worked for years at certain prices couldn't afford to stay on. These are good friends. They just couldn't afford to work for this kind of money.''\n\nCurrent and former employees of Mr. Allen said the the departures included those of his longtime producer, associate producer, film editor, cinematographer, set photographer and costume designer, in a series of shifts that have become the talk of the New York film community.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
