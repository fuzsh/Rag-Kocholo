        "text": "Woody Allen is making his first TV show, but you won't see it on TV. Amazon has ordered a full season of a new series, currently titled Untitled Woody Allen Project, which will be written and directed by the filmmaker.\n\n\"I don't know how I got into this. I have no ideas and I'm not sure where to begin,\" Allen said in a statement. \"My guess is that Roy Price will regret this.\"\n\nNo details on the series, aside from its half-hour running time, were released. The show will be on Amazon Prime with more details to come."
