        "text": "Javier Bardem, the coolest Spanish actor on the planet (Antonio Banderas being the smoothest) is the latest star to sign on to Woody Allen's latest film, currently titled Untitled Woody Allen Spanish Project. He's the second big name on board, after it was recently announced that Penelope Cruz would be taking time out from her gruelling schedule of appearing in Pedro Almodovar movies to appear in the diminuite New York jazz musician's next film.\n\nWe don't know a whole lot about the story yet, other then the few morsels that were tossed our way a few months back â€“ it will centre around a love triangle involving foreigners visiting Barcelona (where it will mainly be shot), and therefore utilise both Spanish and English language dialogue. No word yet on whether it's going to be a comedy, a drama, or both.\n\nThis is only the fourth film Woody has shot outside of the U.S. in God knows how many years (he did shoot part of Bananas on location in Puerto Rico back in 1970), having recently made three in a row in the U.K., having tried unsuccessfully to get Scoop off the ground in Paris.\n\nThis Spanish project is expected to be on screens in the summer of 2008, and will being shooting after he's all done with his drama, Cassandra's Dream."
