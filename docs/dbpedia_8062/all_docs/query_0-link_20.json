        "text": "Update (Thursday, August 30, 3:30 P.M.): According to a new report from Page Six, Amazon has still not set a release date for Allen’s most recent completed film, A Rainy Day in New York, starring Timothée Chalamet, Selena Gomez, Jude Law, and Elle Fanning—prompting speculation that the film may not be released at all. Vanity Fair has reached out to Amazon for comment.\n\nThe original post continues below.\n\nHere’s an item to take a with a grain of salt: according to sources whispering to Page Six, Woody Allen is taking a break from making new movies. If the report is accurate, this would be the first time in decades that the notoriously prolific director, now 82, has paused his busy schedule. Since the late 1970s, Allen has averaged about a film per year. His next (and 48th) feature is A Rainy Day in New York, set to be released by Amazon toward the end of the year.\n\nSo, why the alleged break? Especially if, as Page Six writes, Allen has three more films left as part of his Amazon deal? For one, an insider told Page Six that Allen is allegedly struggling to find a financial backer for his next film. There’s also been an unsavory cloud hanging around Allen since 2014, and especially since the #MeToo movement gained steam last year. Allen’s estranged daughter, Dylan Farrow, has long accused her father of sexually abusing her as a child. Her brother, reporter Ronan Farrow—whose reporting on Harvey Weinstein helped to kick off the wider sexual misconduct reckoning—staunchly supported her claims. Allen has repeatedly denied the allegations, and has never been criminally charged for them. Per Page Six, an Allen spokesperson said “none of this is true,” regarding reports of the director’s film break. A rep for Allen again denied the claims in response to Vanity Fair’s request for comment. Representatives for Amazon have not yet responded to V.F.\n\nEven if Allen does not intend to take a break from making movies, the newly galvanized conversation around sexual misconduct in Hollywood has caught the director in its crosshairs—and has likely made it difficult for him to secure A-list actors for any new projects, let alone financial backers. Dylan penned a forceful essay in late 2017, asking why Allen has continued working, despite the allegations against him—and why mainstream actresses continued signing on for his films. Since then, an avalanche of stars, including Ellen Page, Greta Gerwig, Colin Firth, and Michael Caine have publicly disavowed Allen; Gerwig and Page said they regret appearing in his films. In addition, actors Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Hall, and Griffin Newman, all of whom starred in A Rainy Day in New York, announced they were donating their salaries from that film to charity organizations like Time’s Up and RAINN. Chalamet, who was constantly on the press circuit last awards season, said that he could not directly comment on why he chose to work with Allen due to contractual obligations, but expressly did not want to profit from the film.\n\nEven Allen’s Amazon deal has come under revitalized scrutiny in the wake of the movement, as it was negotiated by ex-Amazon Studios exec Roy Price in 2016. Last year, Price resigned from his post at the company after being accused of sexual harassment. (He never commented on the claims.) During his tenure, Price also, rather infamously, passed on female-driven shows like The Handmaid’s Tale and Big Little Lies, and canceled the female-centered Good Girls Revolt. Per The Hollywood Reporter, insiders say Amazon is now contemplating severing ties completely with Allen, even if that means a sizable payout. At the moment, Allen doesn’t have any official projects lined up for the future, though there is an untitled project slated for 2020 sitting on his IMDb page.\n\n13 Old Hollywood Hot Spots That Defined an Era\n\n1 / 13\n\nLiterary Life\n\nDylan Farrow’s New Career: Y.A.
