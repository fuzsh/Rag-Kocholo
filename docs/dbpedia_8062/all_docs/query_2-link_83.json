        "text": "Despite the #MeToo allegations against Woody Allen, Gina Gershon says getting cast in the longtime filmmaker's next movie was a \"dream come true,\" according to multiple reports.\n\nSpeaking at a Tuesday press conference in Spain with Allen and more members of the cast, Gershon responded to questions about boycotting Allen amid sexual assault allegations and the #MeToo movement.\n\n\"While I think there’s a lot of good that’s coming out of all these different movements, I just feel it’s really important that people really take a look at every situation and really make up their own minds about it,\" she said, according to The Hollywood Reporter and Screen Daily.\n\nGershon is best known for roles in \"Pretty in Pink,\" \"Face/Off,\" and \"Showgirls.\" She currently appears on The CW's \"Riverdale.\"\n\nA number of actors have distanced themselves from Allen in recent years over allegations of sexual misconduct. Dylan Farrow, Allen's adoptive daughter, in 2014 renewed the claim that Allen molested her in 1992 when she was 7 years old. Allen has long denied the allegations. He was investigated but not charged.\n\n\"I personally think that you really have to look at every single situation and really, between you and you, decide how you feel about this situation,\" Gershon added. \"And I can say with a very clear conscience and so much excitement that I am so thrilled to be here. This feels kind of like a dream come true.\"\n\nAllen added that despite the allegations, he remains focused on his work. (The officially untitled film is currently in production in Spain, according to the reports.)\n\n\"I don’t think of political movements or social movements,\" he said. \"I’m just not equipped mentally to have any deep insights on those things. I deal mostly with human relations and people and comedy... I’ll probably die in the midst of setting up a film shot one day on a set making a movie.\"\n\nContributing: The Associated Press"
