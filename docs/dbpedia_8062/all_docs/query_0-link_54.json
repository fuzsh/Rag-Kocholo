        "text": "Picture: Rex Features\n\nOscar-winning writer and director Woody Allen is set to start on one of the biggest collaborations of his career. Amazon Studios has signed the veteran moviemaker to write and direct his own television show, commissioning a full series with the current – imaginative – working title of 'The Untitled Woody Allen Project'.\n\nCommenting on the deal, Allen himself was traditionally self-deprecating about the whole business, claiming: \"I don't know how I got into this. I have no ideas and I'm not sure where to begin. My guess is [they] will regret this.\" Amazon, on the other hand, has never been more confident of success - and the announcement is an impressive delivery on their promise to create exciting, new and original content for online viewers.\n\nAs the first company to hold the filmmaker down for years, they are just as excited as we are to see the results of such a pairing. \"It's an honour to be working with him,' said Roy Price, Amazon Studio's vice president. Allen is renowned for his humorous and often slow-paced films about life and love, from his classics Annie Hall (1977) and the monochrome madness of Manhattan (1978) to his more modern ventures such as 2013's award-winning Blue Jasmine. It will be curious to see exactly how he makes the transition to television work.\n\nHe is famed for his frequent appearances within his own films; we wonder if he'll continue the tradition and feature – à la Lena Dunham in Girls – within the new series. We're hoping the answer's yes.\n\nThe announcement comes just days after Amazon's triumph at the Golden Globe Awards, where they made history with their television series Transparent, which became the first online TV show to win the award for Best Series. The future for online television looks brighter than ever.\n\n***\n\nMORE CULTURE\n\nGolden Globes 2015: Winners list\n\nBest Exhibtion Books 2015"
