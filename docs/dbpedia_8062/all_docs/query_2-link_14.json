        "text": "There's a scene in Woody Allen's 1977 masterpiece, Annie Hall, in which Alvy Singer (Allen) and Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) travel from New York to Los Angeles. \"It's so clean out here,\" Annie says. \"That's because they don't throw their garbage away,\" Alvy replies. \"They turn it into television shows.\" The throwaway line was an expected sentiment from Allen's self-loathing character, a struggling comedian and TV writer, and it more than likely reflected his real-life views at the time. A few decades later, TV is becoming the preferred medium for vaunted auteurs, with some movie directors publicly abandoning the big screen entirely (notably, Steven Soderbergh).\n\nTwo days after Jill Soloway's Transparent won the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Seriesâ€”Comedy, Amazon announced that it has lured the 79-year-old Allen to join its roster: It has ordered a full season of Untitled Woody Allen Project, a half-hour show that will be written and directed by Allen and made available to customers via Prime Instant Video. \"Woody Allen is a visionary creator who has made some of the greatest films of all-time, and it's an honor to be working with him on his first television series,\" Amazon Studios Vice President Roy Price said in a press release this morning.\n\nAllen, sounding more than a little like Alvy Singer, said, \"I don't know how I got into this. I have no ideas and I'm not sure where to begin. My guess is that Roy Price will regret this.\""
