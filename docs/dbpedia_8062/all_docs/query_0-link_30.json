        "text": "Much unlike his personal life, Woody Allen’s professional life has an unimpeachable integrity. The consistencies in his six-decade long film career bear testimony to this. His films begin with the title credits on black played to the tune of a jazz number. Last 37 years, he has only worked with 2 editors across 40 films.\n\nWhenever he played a character in a film, it was a claustrophobic, awkward, nebbish man trying to impress a girl. When he got tired of playing himself, he fell upon people like Larry David. Even when he wrote a younger character in his films, it wasn’t too different from how he would’ve written himself in the film. Think Owen Wilson in Midnight in Paris, who bore the misery of the protagonist’s struggle with his book, with a cheerful disposition.\n\nYet in spite of the apparent uniformities of his storylines, in his films, Woody brought a canvas that was sometimes a parody of and sometimes an ode to high literature. Combined with his terrific writing skills and oft sprinkled buffoonery, he crafted a style for himself that came to be known as “Woody Allen-esque”. It’s the kind of epithet that is only bestowed to a handful of filmmakers in any generation.\n\nTo admire Woody Allen in this day is a tough occupation. It is impossible to overlook the sexual abuse allegations made by his ex-wife Mia Farrow and their daughter Dylan. In 2014, when the allegations resurfaced, his son Ronan, wrote a scathing tweet debunking his father’s claims that he was innocent. Woody Allen in return, wrote a New York Times op-ed pointing to Mia Farrow’s “festering anger” taking over their “daughter’s well-being”.\n\nTo what degree can a man’s craft be admired, and his personal transgressions overlooked ? Unlike Polanski, he never fled from the situation and yet the allegations never settled themselves. It is not a debate I want to be part of.\n\nWoody Allen shaped the way I looked at films. He has shaped the way I look at life. I hate that his perception in my head will always be muddied because of these allegations but if you are an aspiring screenwriter or filmmaker, his work can’t be ignored.\n\nLast week, he turned 81 and he still has an “Untitled Woody Allen Project” listed on IMDB.Com for release in 2017. And this is a pattern he follows every single year: he makes a film. Most of the times, they are good films. Now there are so many of them that anyone wanting to take a dip into the Woody Allen oeuvre is spoilt for choices.\n\nIf in your universe, the phrase “Written and Directed by Woody Allen” never dissolved to black in the title credits, here’s a reckoner of some of his best films, to make that choice easier for you.\n\nTake the Money and Run (1969)\n\nUnhappy with the studios’ choice of actors in his previous film, this was the first film that Woody Allen wore the multiple hats of a writer, director and actor for. This was also the first time he took the route of a ‘mockumentary’ (he did it again in Zelig) to narrate the life and times of an idiotic bank robber. Leveraging his background as a stand-up comic, in his early years Woody Allen mastered the art of infusing comedic material into his screenplays. He perfected it to absurdist levels in films like Love and Death and Bananas but this is where it all began.\n\nLove and Death (1975)\n\nI have seen every Woody Allen film except Cafe Society and I find it hard to find a funnier film than Love and Death. Based in 19th century wartime Russia, Boris essayed by Woody Allen, strives hard to gain his lover’s affection only to get embroiled in a series of mishaps. Groucho Marx was one of Woody Allen’s inspirations and this film with the combination of it’s sharp wit and set pieces came closest to mirroring how Marx would’ve dealt with the subject. A sampler:\n\nSonya: Oh, don’t Boris please. Sex without love is an empty experience.\n\nBoris: Yes, but as empty experiences go, it is one of the best.\n\nThe Front (1976)\n\nUnlike every other film on this list, The Front is neither written nor directed by Woody Allen. Woody Allen plays a “front” for a screenwriter who is blacklisted at the height of McCarthyism in the United States. What made this film even more humane was that the people involved in the making of the film — Walter Bernstein, Zero Mostel, Martin Ritt were all themselves put out of work because of their anti-American views.\n\nAnnie Hall (1977)\n\nThis film is practically a film school for romantic comedies. Annie Hall is Woody Allen’s most celebrated film and is one of the only 42 films that got nominated for the Big Five Oscar categories of Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Film, Best Director and Best Screenplay. It won four of those awards on the big night. Cinematically, the film breaches many storytelling conventions and both the start and the ending of the film are unlike anything that had been seen in that era.\n\nOh and the only nomination that it missed out on winning? Woody Allen for Best Actor.\n\nManhattan (1979)\n\nVery few films ever resemble a painting in every frame. Thanks to some unforgettable shots by Gordon Willis, Manhattan is a visual treatise. While never as celebrated as Annie Hall, Manhattan’s screenplay has a timelessness to its story of an elder man unable to decide if he should take his relationship with a younger girl seriously. It’s a cliche for reviewers these days to talk about ‘how a city plays a character’ in the film. If they see Manhattan, I hope they will see what that really means.\n\nBesides, every time I see Manhattan there is something I see that gets etched onto my memory for good. The last time it was ‘Tracy’s face..’ (Get it? )\n\nThe Purple Rose of Cairo (1984)\n\nWoody Allen entertained the idea of breaking reality in his films. In The Purple Rose of Cairo, a character from a film in a theater breaks the fourth wall and goes for a walk with an audience member. Shot in black and white, it’s a film that was critically acclaimed for the choice of it’s premise. In this day and age, where the fantasy genre and parallel universes, have become staple for the likes of Marvel Studios, Woody showed how to do it without laser weapons and robotic villains.\n\nMatch Point (2005)\n\nThis was Woody’s first film shot in London and it involved a murder. These were both things that one could never associate with Woody Allen in the first two decades of his career. While he started off with comedies, Woody successfully pushed over to the romantic comedy genre in 70s and 80s. Around the 90s, he began experiments with the darker side of relationships. This included films like Crimes and Misdemeanors, Manhattan Murder Mystery and Cassandra’s Dream. None of which came close to the raw and unapologetic Match Point.\n\nMidnight in Paris (2011)\n\nThis film begins with a montage of Paris played to a Sydney Bechet tune. It’s a three minute track before a voice over begins. Nothing happens for three minutes. It’s just mood-setting. It made me think how many years does it take a filmmaker to convince a producer that this kind of opening where “nothing happens” is important for three full minutes. It’s a depressing answer for you and me but Woody Allen got there after five decades.\n\nIt is unlikely that Woody Allen will ever write another Oscar-winning script. His few films since Midnight in Paris have lacked the inventiveness that set this film apart from his work of the later years. Once again, breaking from reality, protagonist Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) roams around the streets of Paris to find inspiration for his book and walks into a 1920s Paris drinking den.\n\nThe rest, is history (no pun intended) because it was good enough to give Woody his last Best Original Screenplay Oscar. No other name has been associated for this award thrice. It’s an anomaly of a statistic. No other name has not shown up to receive an Oscar these many number of times.\n\nWoody Allen is an anomaly of a filmmaker."
