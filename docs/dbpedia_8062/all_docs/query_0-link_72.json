He also wrote The Revisionist, in which he starred alongside Vanessa Redgrave. Previously, he wrote and starred in Asuncion at the Cherry Lane Theatre. He is also an Academy Award-nominated actor, having starred in the films \"The Double,\" \"Night Moves,\" \"Now You See Me,\" \"The Social Network,\" \"Zombieland,\" \"Adventureland and \"The Squid and the Whale.\"\n\nIt was recently announced that Bruce Willis, whose career alternates between big-budget thrillers and small art house films, will make his Broadway debut in William Goldman’s adaptation of Misery.\n\nThe film's female lead will be played by Kristen Stewart, best known as Bella in the “Twilight” films."
