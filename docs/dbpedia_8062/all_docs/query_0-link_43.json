        "text": "As is standard for Woody Allen’s work rate, his latest film (To Rome With Love) is still in theatres, yet he’s already hard at work on his next work. Very little has been revealed about the currently untitled 2013 film, but a recent casting notice tells us that principal production is almost upon us.\n\nWe do know that filming will take place in San Francisco and New York. A recently released casting call confirms the San Francisco location, and that extras are needed for 6th August 2012 – less than two weeks away.\n\nFull details:\n\nUpscale SAG-AFTRA Members\n\nAvail Mon 8/6 – Marin County\n\nUntitled Woody Allen Project Theatrical – SAG\n\nMale or Female / All Ethnicities, AfricanAm, Am-Indian, Asian, Caucasian, East-Ind, Hispanic, Mid Eastern, Mixed, Pacific Islander / 28 – 52 yrs old\n\nSAG-AFTRA Members only. Clean Cut, Sophisticated, Conservative looking Marin types 30s – 40s with upscale attire, suits, dresses etc. for daytime party scene.\n\nMust be avail all day Mon 8/6 for 12-14 hr shoot starting by or before 6AM in Marin County and have your own transportation. Union extra rate is $145 for 8hrs plus overtime thereafter.\n\nValid ID required for I-9 paperwork.

What we don’t know – if Woody himself will appear, or anything related to plot or genre. Alec Baldwin claimed he would be playing a bigger role than he did in To Rome With Love. Louis CK auditioned for two roles. With so many comedic talents, we assume that comedy will play a part.\n\nAllen has a long history with San Francisco, most notably filming Take The Money And Run and Play It Again, Sam there. The San Francisco Chronicle just wrote an excellent piece about Allen’s relationship with San Fran, and the making of those films.\n\nWe will, of course, keep you up to date with any developments on this exciting new film!"
