        "text": "Los Angeles:Â Actress Blake Lively has reportedly come on board to act in veteran filmmaker Woody Allen’s upcoming untitled film.\n\nThe 27-year-old will join the cast ensemble, which includes Kristen Stewart, Bruce Willis and Jesse Eisenberg, reports deadline.com.\n\nThe film, which is yet to be titled and the plot details of which have been kept under wraps, will be produced by Allen’s usual collaborators Letty Arsonson, Stephen Tenenbaum and Edward Walson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAllen is casting the film as he prepares for the Cannes premiere of his movie Irrational Man, starring Emma Stone and Joaquin Phoenix. The comedy drama will be released in the US on July 17.\n\nLively’s latest film The Age of Adaline has grossed $24 million domestically so far. The Lee Toland Krieger-directed film snagged the third place at this week’s box office with an estimated $6.2 million in its second weekend.\n\nBefore joining Allen’s film, Lively is booked to star as a blind woman who regains her eyesight in upcoming romantic drama “All I See Is You” alongside Jason Clarke. The movie, which will be directed by Marc Foster, has no set release date yet."
