        "text": "We still don’t know when North American audiences will get the chance to see Woody Allen’s last film, “A Rainy Day in New York.” However, even with distribution up in the air, the filmmaker has moved on to his next project, an untitled film that he will begin shooting in Spain next month. And now, we know the actors that have signed on to star in the film.\n\nAccording to a report from French outlet Le Parisien, Allen has signed actors Christoph Waltz, Gina Gershon, Louis Garrel, Sergi Lopez, and Elena Anaya to appear in his untitled film. Normally, it’s not a huge news story when Allen announces his casts, as he’s always been known to attract some big names to his films. However, in light of recent events, the fact that he’s able to attract talent like Waltz is a bit surprising.\n\nREAD MORE: Luca Guadagnino Disapproves Of The “Perverted & Primordial Enjoyment” Felt By Those Attacking Woody Allen\n\nAs mentioned, Allen is having trouble distributing his last film after the filmmaker’s previous sexual assault allegations resurfaced during the beginning of the #MeToo movement. Since then, Allen has effectively been blacklisted in Hollywood, with his lucrative Amazon Studios deal destroyed and no US studios and distributors willing to work with him at this time. Even his cast for ‘Rainy Day’ distanced themselves from him, with Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Hall, and others giving back their salaries and publicly disavowing the director.\n\nSince then, he’s gone to Europe for financing for his latest project, and it appears that he’s also found more international actors to help round out his cast. Waltz, of course, is best known for his collaborations with Quentin Tarantino, as well as the recent film, “Alita: Battle Angel.” Gershon is an actress that rose to prominence in the mid-to-late-’90s in films like “Showgirls” and “Bound.”\n\nREAD MORE: Woody Allen & Roman Polanski Are Both Getting The Cold Shoulder From US Distributors For Their New Films\n\nGarrel is probably best known to French audiences, but the actor has appeared in dozens of films and has transitioned into filmmaking. That being said, he’s going to have a role in this year’s “Little Women” remake directed by Greta Gerwig. Anaya has also made a name for herself internationally, perhaps best known for starring in Pedro Almodóvar’s “The Skin I Live In.” Last, but certainly not least, is Lopez, who can be seen in Guillermo del Toro’s “Pan’s Labyrinth.”\n\nThere’s no release date set for Allen’s latest film."
