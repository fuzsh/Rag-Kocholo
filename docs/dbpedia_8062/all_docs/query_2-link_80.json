        "text": "A television series created by Woody Allen is coming to Amazon Prime, Amazon Studios announced on Tuesday. According to a release, Allen will write and direct what will be his first television series. The untitled program (currently using the name \"Untitled Woody Allen Project\") will include half-hour episodes and already has a full-season order. Allen will write and direct every episode.\n\n“Woody Allen is a visionary creator who has made some of the greatest films of all-time, and it’s an honor to be working with him on his first television series,” Roy Price, Vice President of Amazon Studios, said in a statement. “From 'Annie Hall' to 'Blue Jasmine,' Woody has been at the creative forefront of American cinema and we couldn’t be more excited to premiere his first TV series exclusively on Prime Instant Video next year.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I don’t know how I got into this,\" Allen said in the same statement. \"I have no ideas and I’m not sure where to begin. My guess is that Roy Price will regret this.\"\n\nAllen's next feature film, an untitled project with Emma Stone and Joaquin Phoenix in starring roles, is due out this year. He has no other movies currently in development.\n\nThe news came just two days after Amazon Studios won its first two Golden Globes for Jill Soloway's landmark series, \"Transparent.\" The show won Best Comedy Series and its star, Jeffrey Tambor, won Best Actor in a Comedy Series."
