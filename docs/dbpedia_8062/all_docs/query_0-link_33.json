        "text": "Film fans have officially entered an era that we haven’t experienced in decades, and you might not even be aware of it. But, as of this writing, Woody Allen is not working on a new film project. That’s right, the director, who has released a new film each year, like clockwork, is without a film on the horizon. Yes, there’s the still-unreleased “A Rainy Day in New York,” but as doubt surrounds that film’s release, Allen is apparently taking a break from filmmaking.\n\nREAD MORE: If Amazon Cuts Ties With Woody Allen, It Might Mean A Costly Payout\n\nAccording to Page Six, even though his IMDB says he’s working on an “Untitled Woody Allen Project,” Allen is currently not working on anything officially. This comes after a whirlwind of controversy resurfaced over the last year, as adoptive daughter Dylan Farrow has been very vocal about her alleged abuse by the director in light of the #MeToo movement.\n\nThis controversy, compounded by the recent string of actors and actresses vowing to never work with Allen again, has put the directors highly-publicized three-film deal with Amazon Studios in trouble. As mentioned, Amazon is currently sitting on ‘Rainy Day’ with no plans to release the film. There are also rumblings that Amazon is willing to dish out a huge paycheck to terminate its deal with Allen. And on top of that, the report suggests that Allen is currently unable to land any financing for a project, even if he wanted to film.\n\nREAD MORE: Woody Allen Says He Should Be A “Poster Boy” For #MeToo And Touts His “Wonderful Record” With Women\n\nAnd aside from the #MeToo controversy, Page Six reports that Allen is having trouble landing financing because his films just don’t make a tidy profit as they have in previous decades. So, as we’ve seen with the entertainment industry, you can still work if you’re controversial, as long as you are making money.\n\nThis leaves Allen in a position he hasn’t felt since the ‘70s — jobless. We’ll have to wait and see what the future holds for the 82-year-old filmmaker. Perhaps Allen’s legendary career is a casualty of bad timing and controversy."
