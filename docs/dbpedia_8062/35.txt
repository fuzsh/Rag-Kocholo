Christoph Waltz, Wallace Shawn and Gina Gershon are among the cast members of Woody Allen’s new film, a Spanish production company announced Tuesday. It is the director’s first movie since losing a major distribution deal and being ostracized by many in Hollywood over renewed accusations of sexual abuse.

Allen became persona non grata in Hollywood after his adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow, reiterated her allegation that he molested her as a child — a claim Allen has vigorously denied. Publishing houses recently passed on his memoir, actors disavowed working with him, and Amazon canceled a four-picture distribution deal, which prompted Allen to sue for at least $68 million.

The as-yet-untitled project is scheduled to begin production July 10 in San Sebastian, in Spain’s Basque Country, and, according to production notes, tells of a husband and wife who fall for other people during a film festival. Other stars in the new movie, Allen’s 51st, include the Spanish actress Elena Anaya (“Wonder Woman” and “Sex and Lucia”) and the French actor Louis Garrel (“The Dreamers”).
