        "text": "00:01 Stay tuned to meet a modern day Lazarus\n\n00:02 and his praying wife.\n\n00:04 My name is Yvonne Lewis.\n\n00:05 And I'm Jason Bradley,\n\n00:07 and you're watching Urban Report.\n\n00:31 Hello, and welcome to Urban Report.\n\n00:33 Our guests today are Doctors Thomas, and Laverne Jackson,\n\n00:37 Director and Associate Director respectively\n\n00:40 of M.E.E.T Ministry.\n\n00:41 Welcome to Urban Report, Doctors Jackson.\n\n00:45 Thank you, Jason.\n\n00:46 Thank you dear. Good to be here.\n\n00:49 I got my co-host Jason here, yeah.\n\n00:52 And I'm so glad he's here, so glad you all are here.\n\n00:56 Because we had the privilege of working together\n\n01:00 on from sickness to health,\n\n01:02 which is another program\n\n01:03 that's on the Dare to Dream network.\n\n01:05 And during that time\n\n01:07 you were talking about M.E.E.T Ministry\n\n01:09 and all the...\n\n01:10 your background and all that\n\n01:12 and all that God had done with M.E.E.T ministry,\n\n01:14 but so much has happened since then\n\n01:17 and I had to bring you on to Urban Report\n\n01:20 to talk about what's happened to you since then.\n\n01:24 So let's start there\n\n01:25 and then we'll work our way back to your beginnings\n\n01:28 but what happened when you were in London?\n\n01:31 Well, Yvonne, time has shrunk,\n\n01:34 it's been a year July 17, 2015\n\n01:39 we were scheduled to be in Nigeria\n\n01:41 on a medical mission training school.\n\n01:43 And God sees all things so that was cancer,\n\n01:47 council excuse me and we were invited to go\n\n01:50 to London for a two week seminar.\n\n01:52 So went there we board the plane that Friday morning,\n\n01:57 we landed in London, England that Friday afternoon.\n\n02:01 And business as usual we fly all the time.\n\n02:05 Dispatch, get settle in, fellowship with the people\n\n02:09 that we're going to spend the next two weeks with meals.\n\n02:13 My wife take a little walk at the meal,\n\n02:15 come back, sun is setting, prayer, take a shower\n\n02:21 and Friday evening I lied out.\n\n02:24 And my wife says, she heard a grunt from me\n\n02:28 and she can push me a little bit and wake me up,\n\n02:33 and I was there lying there on my back\n\n02:36 with my eyes wide open and no breath in my body.\n\n02:41 So she appeared blank called downstairs,\n\n02:45 we're doing medical missionary training\n\n02:47 in emergency situation like that,\n\n02:49 soon a person might be having a little cardio problem\n\n02:52 get a little cayenne and pepper,\n\n02:54 put on the tongue, but no response.\n\n02:58 No response and she can feel you in that part,\n\n03:03 I didn't wake up no more till seven days later.\n\n03:08 So those seven days, the story goes in my wife hand.\n\n03:13 Tell us what...\n\n03:14 tell us what happened?\n\n03:17 As he got right in, got back into bed\n\n03:20 and I heard this noise\n\n03:21 and I asked the individual to get to,\n\n03:25 get the cayenne and then when they brought\n\n03:28 the cayenne to me and I put it in his mouth.\n\n03:31 I noticed it wasn't going in,\n\n03:33 so I knew then that we needed some\n\n03:36 conventional methods here\n\n03:38 because we couldn't so she started to do CPR,\n\n03:42 but she was kind of a little on the small size\n\n03:45 so she was not actually working real good.\n\n03:48 So we called the paramedics and there was one come.\n\n03:53 Then after that, there was another,\n\n03:55 then there was actually there wind up\n\n03:57 three or four cars there.\n\n03:59 How long did it take for them to come?\n\n04:01 They came, well, you know when you have in a crisis\n\n04:04 you don't time is insignificant.\n\n04:07 So my...\n\n04:08 My times in laps that I was oxygen deprive for my brain\n\n04:13 for 30 minutes.\n\n04:14 But still not in that 30 minutes\n\n04:16 they had to get there,\n\n04:17 plus they had to perform a CPR\n\n04:20 in order to get his brain back functioning\n\n04:25 and then get him to the hospital and...\n\n04:27 He wasn't, you took his pulse could you find the pulse?\n\n04:30 Couldn't find the pulse, he wasn't breathing?\n\n04:32 He was not breathing at all, totally no breath at all.\n\n04:38 And so of course,\n\n04:41 I started praying\n\n04:42 and the other individuals started praying\n\n04:43 but when I got there they of course\n\n04:45 put me out of the room\n\n04:47 and then we were in a small area\n\n04:50 so there was a upstairs, we were really upstairs\n\n04:53 so they had to get someone with a longer cart to be a...\n\n04:56 Of 6'6''.\n\n04:58 Right and they had the several to lift him\n\n05:02 and to bring him down the steps to the ambulance.\n\n05:07 And the hospital, there were two hospitals,\n\n05:10 there was one actually\n\n05:12 within a few blocks from where we were,\n\n05:16 but they made a decision to take him to King's Hospital\n\n05:20 which was actually about 45 minutes away,\n\n05:24 but they got him there very quick, quickly.\n\n05:28 So there was no breathing.\n\n05:32 Did they say to you, he was dead?\n\n05:34 No, they did not.\n\n05:36 They didn't want me to know anything\n\n05:39 so they just told me that I had to stay out of the room\n\n05:42 and they didn't want to give me any information\n\n05:45 and then they told me\n\n05:47 they were going to take him to the...\n\n05:49 they said nearest hospital,\n\n05:52 but by the time they got him in that ambulance.\n\n05:54 They had breath\n\n05:57 because they had put some oxygen on him.\n\n05:59 So they did have some sort in that lapses,\n\n06:02 it was about 30 minutes\n\n06:04 before they could get him to breathe in\n\n06:07 and then when once they got him to the hospital\n\n06:09 they and I followed them in another car,\n\n06:13 and they indicated that\n\n06:17 they didn't know what was going on.\n\n06:19 They had a cardiologist come to me\n\n06:21 and tell me that he didn't have a heart attack\n\n06:25 and they said, he didn't have a stroke.\n\n06:27 So they said, we're not sure\n\n06:29 but they wanted to do some kind of special tests\n\n06:33 and the doctor said to me, \"We don't need to do that\n\n06:35 because he didn't have a heart attack\n\n06:37 and he didn't have a stroke.\"\n\n06:38 We don't know what's happening\n\n06:40 but he said, \"He's a very sick man.\"\n\n06:45 My husband has never been sick,\n\n06:47 so here all of a sudden in a matter of minutes\n\n06:50 he's going to be totally dependent\n\n06:53 and that once they got him into ICU,\n\n06:57 they had him hooked up\n\n06:58 to every type of apparatus you get,\n\n07:02 tubes were everywhere\n\n07:04 and he laid there like he was just sleeping.\n\n07:08 He didn't look sick or nothing\n\n07:11 but the doctors say, \"He's very sick\"\n\n07:13 and so what they did is they induced a coma\n\n07:17 because they were afraid that\n\n07:19 what would happen is his brain may swell\n\n07:23 so they put him in a coma and then they told me that\n\n07:26 we don't know whether he would come out.\n\n07:29 We don't know\n\n07:33 if he would be a vegetable.\n\n07:37 So, but they had to do what they had to do.\n\n07:41 How...\n\n07:43 You guys are in natural medicine.\n\n07:47 So this whole thing had to be so,\n\n07:52 just such a shift for you\n\n07:56 because he was not sick prior to this,\n\n07:58 everything was going fine.\n\n08:01 And then all of a sudden\n\n08:02 he's caught up into that whole system\n\n08:04 of all the meds and all the interventions\n\n08:08 which we're not saying that they're never useful\n\n08:11 but obviously they are,\n\n08:13 but it's just a shift\n\n08:15 from that total natural into the total allopathic\n\n08:19 and it had to be just, it's so traumatic for you.\n\n08:24 It was\n\n08:26 It was so sudden and just so traumatic.\n\n08:27 And the doctor said that you're going to be dependent.\n\n08:31 Well, as they share with my wife\n\n08:34 and she go through this that they didn't see\n\n08:36 no way I was gonna live anyway\n\n08:38 and if I did live I would be a vegetable,\n\n08:41 couldn't talk, couldn't walk.\n\n08:43 And so the time was up so he was trying to convince,\n\n08:47 you know we go into the pro help,\n\n08:48 and as Yvonne says that\n\n08:52 as things are beyond our control\n\n08:54 so far as the intervention.\n\n08:56 You know it was seven days when I woke up,\n\n09:00 holding my wife hand.\n\n09:02 And I woke up not looking around,\n\n09:05 not questioning what happened to me.\n\n09:08 None, that was not even on the mind.\n\n09:11 I woke up praying for the people in that place.\n\n09:16 Now remember, I'm coming out of,\n\n09:18 out of nowhere of asleep.\n\n09:22 There were three people in that,\n\n09:24 in that city country London\n\n09:27 that died from this situation,\n\n09:32 a cricket player, a soccer player\n\n09:36 and a gentleman died\n\n09:38 one day before his wedding, Methodist.\n\n09:43 and so when I woke up I woke up praying.\n\n09:47 I did not wake up questioning what happened\n\n09:50 and then I wake up and you know I'm,\n\n09:52 I'm into health and I've been doing this\n\n09:53 for these many years.\n\n09:56 That never crossed my mind and...\n\n10:00 But how were you aware of anything around you.\n\n10:04 Yeah.\n\n10:06 And that's where the journey really began.\n\n10:08 Like I said, when I woke up\n\n10:11 and you were over there.\n\n10:14 When I woke up, I woke up,\n\n10:18 Yvonne, in a praying mode.\n\n10:21 Now there's only one source\n\n10:24 that could come from God had to download that into me,\n\n10:30 I didn't wake up in a panic,\n\n10:32 I didn't wake up with remorse.\n\n10:34 I didn't wake up questioning.\n\n10:36 I wake up, I woke up praying not for myself,\n\n10:40 that's another not for myself\n\n10:43 and I could not talk, I could not walk.\n\n10:47 As my wife, bless her heart,\n\n10:51 her seven days the reports have kept coming\n\n10:55 because you know time is running out for them.\n\n10:59 So it's nothing else they can do,\n\n11:01 you know, they get their wiring,\n\n11:04 if I wasn't going to wake up out of the induce\n\n11:07 but see 30 minutes of oxygen deprivation to the brain.\n\n11:13 We know three to five minutes\n\n11:15 is irreparable brain damage.\n\n11:17 Brain damage. Brain damage.\n\n11:19 Irreparable. Yes, yes.\n\n11:21 So...\n\n11:22 But let me go back for one second,\n\n11:24 because it dawned on me,\n\n11:27 what when Dr. Laverne heard your grunt\n\n11:31 just before that what happened to you?\n\n11:33 Just before that,\n\n11:35 well Yvonne, as usual, that's what I asked my wife.\n\n11:38 He got up from the bed and went to the bathroom\n\n11:43 came back from the bathroom,\n\n11:45 got into bed and then there was this grunt.\n\n11:48 Now normally I'm told\n\n11:49 when he's there I'm totally sleep.\n\n11:52 You know I'm, I'm not aware but,\n\n11:55 I believe and feel that it was the Holy Spirit's\n\n11:58 unctioning to hear him at that moment\n\n12:03 because as soon as I heard it,\n\n12:05 I said, that doesn't sound right.\n\n12:07 And so I pushed him and I called to him\n\n12:10 and then he wouldn't answer,\n\n12:12 it was total dark in the room\n\n12:13 because there was no light,\n\n12:14 so I got up to turn the light on\n\n12:17 and then that's when I saw that his eyes was open\n\n12:21 and he wasn't breathing at all.\n\n12:23 And so that's when I started to,\n\n12:25 to I was praying all along because I couldn't,\n\n12:29 to me it looked like it was a heart attack.\n\n12:30 Right.\n\n12:32 You know that's what it looked like.\n\n12:33 But I could not tell from there.\n\n12:35 That's why we thought well\n\n12:36 cayenne pepper would be the best\n\n12:39 because it would be a, you know, helps to...\n\n12:40 Helps to dilute it.\n\n12:42 Yeah, and it would help there.\n\n12:44 I didn't question, once I saw that\n\n12:48 what we were doing was not effective.\n\n12:51 I didn't question as to you know,\n\n12:53 oh, should we go to the doctor?\n\n12:56 Or what are people going to think?\n\n12:58 I didn't question that.\n\n13:00 I knew that I needed some intervention\n\n13:02 and I knew that I would be able to have that...\n\n13:06 This way and so that's what you know that's the way.\n\n13:09 And look at how good God is because you walked in here fine\n\n13:12 and you got a firm hand shake, you're walking fine,\n\n13:17 you have all your faculties...\n\n13:18 Oh, brother. I mean, God is amazing.\n\n13:21 Yes.\n\n13:22 More than amazing, Jason, more and...\n\n13:24 He is miraculous really.\n\n13:26 So you woke up after those seven days...\n\n13:29 That's right on the Sabbath.\n\n13:31 Oh, come on now.\n\n13:32 Holding my wife... Yes.\n\n13:33 Come on now, oh...\n\n13:35 Blessed day, yes.\n\n13:37 I woke up and my mind,\n\n13:41 looked at her as I smiled\n\n13:44 and I just thought I mean prayer,\n\n13:46 folks, mourning, groaning,\n\n13:49 and after that\n\n13:52 then God began to communicate.\n\n13:55 I say communicate.\n\n13:57 Satan communicates too\n\n13:58 but God communicates through his word.\n\n13:59 Oh, yeah.\n\n14:01 And that's when God began to give me some clarity.\n\n14:05 Even up until that point,\n\n14:08 I still did not question what happened to me.\n\n14:14 What took place and I like to say this,\n\n14:16 I know our time will run out but I will,\n\n14:18 I'm humbled for the fact you know people folks,\n\n14:23 people at 3ABN but the prayers...\n\n14:26 That went up.\n\n14:27 That went around the world...\n\n14:29 That's right.\n\n14:31 You're not conscious of that fact as you travel,\n\n14:35 I've been in this work the day one,\n\n14:38 I was called into this ministry as of 40 years.\n\n14:43 I've been into this work 40 years,\n\n14:45 and God said,\n\n14:47 \"You cast your bread upon many waters is your return,\"\n\n14:50 as my wife relayed a story\n\n14:52 here we are in a foreign country.\n\n14:54 No money etcetera, etcetera, you know, I never forget.\n\n14:58 And that's the other thing, you're in a foreign country.\n\n15:01 Different currency. Yes, indeed.\n\n15:04 Not around your family.\n\n15:06 It bring a lot of dynamics into place,\n\n15:07 a lot of dynamics and for those seven days\n\n15:10 you know I'm resting.\n\n15:11 Jason, I'm resting, I don't know what's going on.\n\n15:14 So the battle with my wife and a Lord,\n\n15:17 I'm not even conscious of what's going on\n\n15:20 but she can tell you, the Lord provide,\n\n15:24 the conference presidents, people came to my bedside.\n\n15:28 I've been to before.\n\n15:30 Prayers go on from people\n\n15:31 who don't know me through other people family.\n\n15:35 Our daughter flew over there.\n\n15:38 Spiritual son, pastor, he flew over there,\n\n15:41 so that was very humbling.\n\n15:44 People come up and they were praying specific\n\n15:47 not just general, you know,\n\n15:48 they are praying specific prayers\n\n15:52 and so when I did wake up\n\n15:54 when the Lord touched me and woke me up.\n\n15:58 And he began to bring four...\n\n16:02 three precious texts\n\n16:05 that were all for me were in a word of God\n\n16:07 three precious texts.\n\n16:09 Like I said, I've been in this work\n\n16:11 for 40 years, in a prefaces,\n\n16:12 I've been in his work for 40 years,\n\n16:14 Yvonne and Jason, my wife and I,\n\n16:16 we from Chicago to Alabama.\n\n16:20 I would say to a lot of us as we into ministry\n\n16:23 there's a lot of sacrifice one would say\n\n16:27 and time would not permit all that would happen.\n\n16:30 But I would assume that I had really given\n\n16:35 all to the Lord 180 percent,\n\n16:40 my wife knows and those with me.\n\n16:44 I've seen people in the ministry.\n\n16:48 I've seen people with AIDS,\n\n16:50 I worked with full blown AIDS with viral load below 25.\n\n16:55 I've seen God snatched him\n\n16:58 from the paws of death, cancer reversed.\n\n17:01 I've had people die in my arms.\n\n17:04 I've been in the jungles of Africa and Papa New Guinea.\n\n17:07 I've been on every continent\n\n17:09 except for South Pole and North Pole,\n\n17:11 every state in United States,\n\n17:13 and I just assume\n\n17:16 I'm saying this for a reason\n\n17:18 and I pray that it resonate with those who listen this.\n\n17:22 I assume that God had all of me.\n\n17:29 I never look back even in troublous time,\n\n17:31 my wife can tell you.\n\n17:33 Troublous time, agonized time\n\n17:36 with associates and churches, etcetera.\n\n17:39 And as I lay there gave me Proverbs Chapter 4,\n\n17:43 very familiar text verse 20 to 23\n\n17:47 and 23 says what,\n\n17:48 \"Keep thy heart with all diligence,\n\n17:51 For out of it comes the issues of life.\"\n\n17:54 That was the first one.\n\n17:56 The second was Jeremiah 17:9,\n\n18:00 \"The heart is deceitful, desperately wicked,\n\n18:03 who can know it?\"\n\n18:04 Then he turned me over this is God,\n\n18:06 I'm lying there,\n\n18:08 as he woke me up, then he download to me\n\n18:11 Ezekiel 36, he started at verse 21.\n\n18:13 But you know verse 24, he said,\n\n18:16 \"I'm gonna take that stony heart\n\n18:17 and give you a heart of flesh.\"\n\n18:20 Now these scriptures all dealt with the heart,\n\n18:23 you know, and it's my heart.\n\n18:26 And he began to speak, reach in and he said,\n\n18:29 \"I'm not going to fix your heart,\n\n18:32 I'm not going to repair your heart.\"\n\n18:34 that's what he said to me, he said,\n\n18:36 \"I'm gonna give you a new heart.\n\n18:38 And these words, I'm gonna give you a heart\n\n18:40 with the capacity to hold my Spirit.\"\n\n18:44 I'm lying there, these words,\n\n18:48 the final words he said to me,\n\n18:51 \"Tuesday resonated.\"\n\n18:53 He said, \"Surrender.\"\n\n18:58 Did you hear what I'm just saying?\n\n18:59 I've been in this work 40 years.\n\n19:01 Yes, yes.\n\n19:03 I have moved forward in his work.\n\n19:06 My wife can tell you,\n\n19:07 we've been married for 44 years.\n\n19:08 Amen.\n\n19:10 I never deviated in the areas of my health.\n\n19:15 Yes, there have been troubles, my brothers etcetera.\n\n19:19 Never once give up, never once even doubt it.\n\n19:23 Never thought that you weren't surrendered?\n\n19:26 That is the key. Yes.\n\n19:28 That is very important\n\n19:30 and this, what I see throughout God's church in ministries,\n\n19:34 those of us in responsible position as leaders.\n\n19:40 We have seen the tokens of God blessing\n\n19:43 and when that came to me\n\n19:45 and reflect on Jeremiah 17,\n\n19:48 \"The heart is deceitful, desperately wicked.\"\n\n19:52 Yvonne, Jason, we were out doing good things.\n\n19:57 I mean good things\n\n19:59 not evil things.\n\n20:01 I was not conniving, slipshod,\n\n20:07 straight up the board, good things,\n\n20:11 and then he sprinkled\n\n20:16 something else on the plate.\n\n20:19 I told you I've seen AIDS reverse,\n\n20:21 I've seen cancer my 40 years,\n\n20:22 I've been in the jungles of Africa etc, etc.\n\n20:25 He said, \"Son,\n\n20:26 when are you going to come to me.\"\n\n20:28 I said, \"Lord, have we not cast out demons in your name.\"\n\n20:33 then he would say,\n\n20:35 \"I knew not you, workers of inequity.\"\n\n20:37 Now listen to me,\n\n20:39 I'm not our here chasing women,\n\n20:43 I'm not out here drinking, I'm not out here\n\n20:46 and I just lie there,\n\n20:47 I couldn't move\n\n20:49 God had me in a place where he wanted me.\n\n20:51 Did you hear me, Jason?\n\n20:52 Yeah, you're full of tension.\n\n20:54 Yes.\n\n20:56 I'm not a person lost for words.\n\n21:01 I grew up that way leadership position.\n\n21:04 Two things God revealed to me in there.\n\n21:08 Number one, I like to fix people lives.\n\n21:13 I've been like that,\n\n21:14 we come out of the ghettos of Chicago.\n\n21:17 I passion with the inner city youth.\n\n21:19 I like to fix people lives.\n\n21:22 I've always been in a leadership position\n\n21:25 from elementary school through junior high to high school,\n\n21:30 even to college.\n\n21:33 And God said, just sprinkle he said,\n\n21:36 \"Even though you've given me 99.99 percent\n\n21:42 that 1.1 percent are you still too much.\"\n\n21:51 He says, \"Either all or not son\"\n\n21:55 that's what he told me.\n\n21:57 And the rest of the story\n\n21:58 I will talk later how I began to dawn those.\n\n22:01 And I discover, Yvonne,\n\n22:04 that though,\n\n22:07 I know going places,\n\n22:10 I never sought to exalt myself you know.\n\n22:13 I never imposed myself, when people say,\n\n22:15 will you invite me?\n\n22:16 40 years, I never invited myself to go to places.\n\n22:21 So I'm just, you know, take an invitatory.\n\n22:24 God said, \"Surrender\" and I realize.\n\n22:29 Yeah, I'd like to put my hands on the wheel.\n\n22:33 I like to direct,\n\n22:36 but thinking it's a good thing\n\n22:38 because it is for a cause\n\n22:41 and then he gave me a simple formula three P's,\n\n22:45 three P's a simple formula to make it plain to me.\n\n22:50 Many Christians especially this movement\n\n22:54 we confuse our part in God's part,\n\n22:59 we mix them up.\n\n23:01 Would you listen to me, we do,\n\n23:04 we still living in Bible days.\n\n23:08 My situation, it might not have been me\n\n23:11 but we can expect God do this.\n\n23:14 But he gave me a simple formula\n\n23:16 I just did a four part series last month,\n\n23:19 a DVD on this,\n\n23:21 because he took me to John 15.\n\n23:23 They are my friend once I get John 15,\n\n23:25 then David, Pastor Dave was on your show\n\n23:29 where he have marriage-- he's one of our moderators,\n\n23:33 then he would share things they've been learning,\n\n23:35 John 15, God was download in John 15,\n\n23:38 the vine and the branch.\n\n23:40 But he gave me a simple formula\n\n23:41 three P's three P's to help me\n\n23:45 to gain clarity on my part in this work of salvation.\n\n23:52 The first P, the plan, the plan, P-L-A-N.\n\n23:55 The second P, the power.\n\n23:58 The third P, the person.\n\n24:00 The plan, the power, and the person.\n\n24:02 Okay now break each one down.\n\n24:04 I will break it down.\n\n24:06 Now add all those three P's it would define\n\n24:09 what is God exclusive role in the plan of salvation\n\n24:15 and what my role is, so won't be no confusion.\n\n24:18 You understand what I'm saying.\n\n24:20 I want to be plain,\n\n24:21 I want your audience to understand what I'm saying.\n\n24:22 Now God by right he owns everything,\n\n24:27 but in this overall plan of salvation,\n\n24:30 He give us a exclusive role\n\n24:34 that He would not impose Himself.\n\n24:37 You're getting what I'm saying.\n\n24:39 So out of those three P's,\n\n24:41 let me just throw it at you and Jason for a while.\n\n24:44 Out of those three P's which of those P's one or two,\n\n24:49 all of them belongs exclusive to God\n\n24:54 in him working out the salvation for us,\n\n24:56 what do you think? Definitely, the power.\n\n24:58 All right.\n\n24:59 We all agree with that.\n\n25:00 Go ahead, any other one?\n\n25:02 I'll say, all of them belong...\n\n25:03 Yeah.\n\n25:05 I phrase it, paraphrase,\n\n25:08 I preface that exclusive.\n\n25:10 Now remember I said that, \"All of belong to God.\"\n\n25:13 He's sovereign.\n\n25:14 But exclusive that is just his part\n\n25:19 and we have nothing to do with it.\n\n25:21 You getting what I'm saying.\n\n25:22 We have nothing to do with his part at all.\n\n25:26 The power and the plan,\n\n25:29 those two P's belong exclusive to God\n\n25:33 and that's where not just me,\n\n25:37 but as I travel and as I look back\n\n25:38 on my 40 years of working with folks\n\n25:41 that is a key problem.\n\n25:42 We've been in this world,\n\n25:44 this movement longer than\n\n25:46 God wants us to be in this movement.\n\n25:50 In this movement if you understand\n\n25:51 what I'm saying longer\n\n25:53 in the fourth generation since 1844.\n\n25:56 And the fact is that God look at the world today.\n\n26:00 You know you're share,\n\n26:02 the calamities, the more decadence,\n\n26:05 the crime, climatic, we go on and on,\n\n26:08 when I start out\n\n26:09 I'm in a whole new generation here.\n\n26:11 So I learn so God has an exclusive plan for us,\n\n26:15 that plan incorporates every aspect of our lives.\n\n26:21 You know, okay as before we came on the show here,\n\n26:24 you know plan.\n\n26:25 Plan for marriage, plan for occupation,\n\n26:28 plan for education, finances, ministry,\n\n26:32 that is exclusive God's plan.\n\n26:35 He has it.\n\n26:36 He describes it in His Word and inspiration.\n\n26:40 We don't have to go to God with your plan.\n\n26:45 Ask him to endorse your plan.\n\n26:48 That's what I did for 40 years.\n\n26:50 In allude to fact it was to help further his work.\n\n26:54 That's what so good about it,\n\n26:56 \"Hey this is God's work.\"\n\n26:57 I'm asking God to bless this plan\n\n27:00 because it's going to extend his work.\n\n27:02 You get what I'm saying. I do.\n\n27:03 That is the deception on our part.\n\n27:06 He has the power, the power not only the power\n\n27:11 for grace to me he executes plan\n\n27:13 but that power embrace the resources\n\n27:16 to carry his plan.\n\n27:17 I remember you know how does,\n\n27:19 how does ministry of 3ABN start,\n\n27:20 but the point is like ministry\n\n27:22 the resources, plan, power that's exclusive.\n\n27:27 This what God is downloading to me\n\n27:30 to move me to another level,\n\n27:32 the person is the third P.\n\n27:34 Now what's the role of that person.\n\n27:36 The person willing, willing.\n\n27:40 Now remember God is not going to make\n\n27:41 going to force his will,\n\n27:43 willing to submit and commit to his plan\n\n27:48 and to be recipient of his power\n\n27:51 to carry out His will.\n\n27:55 So the person's job is,\n\n27:58 is actually submission\n\n28:01 and yielding the will to God,\n\n28:05 is that what you're saying?\n\n28:06 That's right, John 15 bring this up\n\n28:08 perfectly clear to me,\n\n28:10 and we don't have time but you read a book with clarity.\n\n28:15 When I came back home\n\n28:16 and I picked a book Mount of Blessings.\n\n28:20 It says, \"For me your truths will burst\n\n28:24 on the scene like bright light.\"\n\n28:25 For me your truth,\n\n28:27 so what we're talking about is nothing new light.\n\n28:29 It's not, God is not going to give us new,\n\n28:31 it's there,\n\n28:33 it says that it burst forth on the scene\n\n28:35 were like a burst of light and with greater clarity.\n\n28:40 So in this experience greater clarity came to me.\n\n28:46 Look at that and look at that\n\n28:48 after 30 minutes of oxygen deprivation,\n\n28:52 God gave you greater clarity.\n\n28:56 Greater clarity.\n\n28:58 Of his truths and His Word.\n\n29:00 That's right. And his plan.\n\n29:01 That's right. Amen.\n\n29:03 That's, that is key, his plan, his power...\n\n29:06 His power and all he need is the person\n\n29:09 and the fact that, Yvonne, for 40 years\n\n29:11 and God gave us a sprinkle.\n\n29:12 You know M.E.E.T ministry only when I started off\n\n29:17 we started off, with elementary school.\n\n29:19 Tell us about M.E.E.T?\n\n29:21 Well, M.E.E.T Ministry is the acronym M.E.E.T\n\n29:25 Amos 4:12, \"Prepare to meet your God.\"\n\n29:29 In that acronym stands for\n\n29:32 Missionary, Education and Evangelistic Training\n\n29:37 combining the gospel with the help.\n\n29:40 We found out that Christ method alone\n\n29:44 were true success to ministry.\n\n29:46 You cannot separate the physical, the spiritual,\n\n29:50 nor the mental.\n\n29:53 So M.E.E.T Ministry is multifaceted,\n\n29:55 we operate a Gospel Medical Mission Training School\n\n29:59 there on the campus.\n\n30:00 It's out in western Tennessee 30 acres land small.\n\n30:03 We have a lifestyle center, been going for 20 years,\n\n30:06 where people come from all\n\n30:08 with all kinds of sickness and etc.\n\n30:10 We have a smart gardening program\n\n30:14 which will become an industry I call it smart gardening\n\n30:16 because we free, we free\n\n30:20 in a canvassing program.\n\n30:24 We publish, we publish books,\n\n30:28 have books and the fact is that\n\n30:30 strong evangelistic outreach that we do.\n\n30:34 You have a website and... Website.\n\n30:36 And now folks to your website. Right.\n\n30:38 It's www...\n\n30:40 MeetMinistry.org.\n\n30:43 MeetMinistry.org\n\n30:45 And it's up on the screen. Yes, upon yes.\n\n30:47 We'll be able to go there.\n\n30:48 So we've been doing that,\n\n30:49 the ministry been existing for 28 years prior to that,\n\n30:53 we were conducting, we ran a health food store.\n\n30:56 I've been probably rephrase a self supporting work,\n\n31:00 it's on television.\n\n31:02 I just show up on the scene,\n\n31:04 so the ministry had been established for 20 years\n\n31:07 and that's remarkable in itself,\n\n31:10 God has kept it.\n\n31:12 You know small ministry,\n\n31:13 we got about 18 full time worker there.\n\n31:17 God call my wife and I into the ministry\n\n31:19 and I've read inspired writings on self supporting.\n\n31:25 Wonderful information on,\n\n31:27 what the education work should look like,\n\n31:30 and my professional background is a teacher\n\n31:34 and so God just took that\n\n31:35 and put it in a different framework.\n\n31:38 So that's how we end up.\n\n31:40 And that's what we're doing,\n\n31:41 and it's been going on\n\n31:43 and this experience July 17, 2015,\n\n31:49 has impacted our lives more than the 40 years\n\n31:53 that I've been in this work.\n\n31:55 I believe it.\n\n31:56 The reason that that.\n\n31:57 Yes, I love to see people get well.\n\n32:00 But I found out a ministry like our was\n\n32:04 that we can become dispensers of information\n\n32:08 but not stainable.\n\n32:10 Do you understand what I'm saying, Jason?\n\n32:12 People in ministry need to be ministered to as well.\n\n32:14 Amen, amen.\n\n32:16 You're teaching and preaching everybody else,\n\n32:18 but you have to take time too.\n\n32:20 And you're so clear that and this is why I'm\n\n32:23 and that's to me is very, very key, Jason,\n\n32:28 that we think we are like islands,\n\n32:31 every man to his own tent.\n\n32:34 You see the human body gives us a clear understanding\n\n32:38 of how the body works synergistically,\n\n32:42 one sail but does not stand independent of other sails.\n\n32:48 You getting what I'm saying.\n\n32:49 And they're very supportive.\n\n32:51 And now, here I am, you know,\n\n32:54 I'm at the what you call\n\n32:56 the old age of the youth,\n\n33:00 you know when you reach 40.\n\n33:02 Now your age is youth, when you reach my age,\n\n33:04 you old age of the youth, so anyway.\n\n33:08 So I need to encourage men working on a,\n\n33:13 you know, a curriculum called Biblical truth,\n\n33:16 Biblical leadership in my 40 years what it takes.\n\n33:19 There's a difference between leadership and management.\n\n33:23 Leader need to know what management\n\n33:25 but leadership goes beyond managing,\n\n33:28 it's very important.\n\n33:29 But when God woke me up with that experience\n\n33:31 and as I began to delve into John 15,\n\n33:36 I look back, I said, I've read this 100 of times.\n\n33:39 John is one of my favorite books\n\n33:42 but when I begin to read that verse, those verses.\n\n33:45 Then I got down to verse 5 Jesus said,\n\n33:49 \"I'm the vine and you are the branch.\"\n\n33:52 Then this what hit me,\n\n33:54 without me you can do nothing.\n\n33:59 Have you read that? Oh, yeah.\n\n34:01 Have you read that? Yes.\n\n34:02 Okay, but I don't know what goes on your head,\n\n34:04 but I know as I travel and inner me go now.\n\n34:07 I said, \"What does that nothing means?\"\n\n34:11 Nothing?\n\n34:12 Nothing means nothing.\n\n34:14 Nothing, you can't tie your shoe\n\n34:16 if God didn't give you the grace.\n\n34:18 But it need to resonate with, Yvonne,\n\n34:20 because God is ready to wind his work up.\n\n34:23 He's looking for people that he can trust\n\n34:26 wholeheartedly with his spirit.\n\n34:29 I'm serious I see that.\n\n34:32 And so when I said nothing.\n\n34:34 Then I'm dissecting the Scripture\n\n34:36 and when he says,\n\n34:38 \"I'm the the true vine.\"\n\n34:40 That's what he said in John 51,\n\n34:42 and I read that before true vine.\n\n34:44 I'm thinking, okay, there's counterfeits out here\n\n34:46 but I learned how to study scripture contextually\n\n34:50 Jesus just, just got finished with the upper room.\n\n34:54 John 14.\n\n34:55 He was trying to prepare his disciples for crisis.\n\n35:00 You know in a crisis\n\n35:01 he's getting ready to go to death,\n\n35:02 but they don't think he is going to die.\n\n35:05 We can really prepare for a crisis\n\n35:07 coming upon this earth\n\n35:10 and we're not ready for it.\n\n35:11 So Jesus was trying to get them ready for this crisis.\n\n35:15 So he said \"I'm the true vine.\"\n\n35:18 he didn't say, I'm the vine.\n\n35:20 So when I read it before.\n\n35:22 Maybe that's counterfeit.\n\n35:23 No, he was talking to his church\n\n35:26 because Israel knew that God planted a vineyard\n\n35:29 and they were the vineyard,\n\n35:31 so the disciple thought they were the vine.\n\n35:35 I asked people and I'd say,\n\n35:36 why did Jesus say he is the true vine,\n\n35:39 because there's counterfeit.\n\n35:40 He was talking directly to his church\n\n35:42 because they thought that they were the vine.\n\n35:47 You get what I'm saying.\n\n35:48 He was the vine.\n\n35:49 I'm the true vine and my father is the husband\n\n35:52 bring out upon the husband\n\n35:54 and he the one that tents the vineyard.\n\n35:58 He's the one to take care.\n\n35:59 He's one that prune it.\n\n36:01 Then he said in verse 2, he says,\n\n36:04 \"Every branch in me\n\n36:07 that does not bear fruit I take it away.\"\n\n36:10 Okay, I'm going get to a question then he says,\n\n36:13 in the same verse, he said,\n\n36:15 \"Every branch in me that bear fruit I purge,\"\n\n36:21 I purge for what reason?\n\n36:24 To bear more fruit.\n\n36:27 You hear it. Now here's my question.\n\n36:31 What does God and you had a wide listening audience,\n\n36:34 of course you get theologians listen to it,\n\n36:37 doctors and florists.\n\n36:41 What does God choose to purge us Trials.\n\n36:47 All right, that's right.\n\n36:49 And that's what your audience will say too.\n\n36:52 Look at verse 3 John 15.\n\n36:55 God says,\n\n36:57 \"You are clean through the word,\n\n37:01 you are clean through the word,\"\n\n37:04 Hebrews 4:12 says,\n\n37:06 \"The word is like a twoedged sword.\"\n\n37:10 It cuts, it gets to the what very bone marrow.\n\n37:15 God said in Psalms 50:1 and this become more clarity,\n\n37:19 \"Purge me with his word.\"\n\n37:22 John 17:17,\n\n37:25 \"Sanctify them by that word, the word is true.\"\n\n37:28 We are cleansed through the word.\n\n37:31 Now follow me.\n\n37:32 So here we have my wife go through,\n\n37:36 while I'm seven day resting, she's going through a trial.\n\n37:40 Oh, yeah.\n\n37:42 No money,\n\n37:45 hospital, situation,\n\n37:48 husband whether he gonna\n\n37:52 wake or not, that's a trial.\n\n37:56 But as, as we said,\n\n37:59 those who were with my wife\n\n38:02 that one moment she held on to the word.\n\n38:06 She cling to the word.\n\n38:10 Trials, what I understand trials are,\n\n38:14 they reveal to us the intents of our hearts,\n\n38:20 trials revealed to us our helplessness.\n\n38:24 Exactly.\n\n38:25 Our hopelessness. Yes.\n\n38:26 That's what trials do.\n\n38:28 That's right, our dependence.\n\n38:30 Come on, the word comes to offer the solution\n\n38:35 for that trial case in point.\n\n38:38 Say, say we're very good friends,\n\n38:40 now I just say my wife and I been married for 44 years,\n\n38:42 and we found ourselves allowing\n\n38:47 our spirit to be controlled by the devil\n\n38:51 and he comes in and develop a division among us.\n\n38:55 You know we've been married and say,\n\n38:57 I did something that was just unforgivable\n\n39:02 and she began ruminating, begin to build up a wall,\n\n39:06 the resentment and bitterness and that's happened.\n\n39:08 Oh, yeah.\n\n39:10 That's a trail, we just say that's a trial.\n\n39:12 So now, per se, well, God, she said, well,\n\n39:16 God just send that trial to perfect my character\n\n39:18 but you're still ruminating,\n\n39:20 you still just rehearsing that bitter experience.\n\n39:24 And God's word comes to her,\n\n39:28 forgive and love\n\n39:33 God's word offer a solution for this situation.\n\n39:37 You get what I'm saying.\n\n39:39 Trials reveal in my heart\n\n39:40 'cause she's building a wall a resentment and bitter\n\n39:44 and God said forgive.\n\n39:46 How can I forgive, after all what he did to me?\n\n39:49 I'll forgive that's about it.\n\n39:52 You understand what I'm saying.\n\n39:53 Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n39:54 God sent the word is what cleanse us,\n\n40:00 it offers the solution once I recognize my happiness.\n\n40:04 John 15:4 says,\n\n40:06 \"Every branch in me cannot bear fruit without me.\"\n\n40:11 So then what's the purpose of the branch?\n\n40:15 Can the branch produce fruit?\n\n40:17 No, it receives sap from the vine.\n\n40:22 So the branch only become a channel,\n\n40:24 a conduit through which the sap\n\n40:27 flows through the vine into the branch\n\n40:30 and the fruit is produced.\n\n40:32 So if this bottle of water, my arm,\n\n40:35 Jason, Yvonne, is the branch,\n\n40:37 my body is the vine and this is the fruit,\n\n40:41 what's the fruit for, for the branch?\n\n40:45 Have you ever seen a branch eat his own fruit?\n\n40:48 No.\n\n40:50 And this is some apples and peaches and grape,\n\n40:52 what's it for, you go and pluck it.\n\n40:54 So therefore,\n\n40:55 what God will produce through me through you\n\n40:57 by abide in him our fruit\n\n41:00 which is the reproduction of the character of God\n\n41:04 in me that others partake of these fruit\n\n41:07 and be nourished that that same character is reproduced\n\n41:10 in the partakers of that\n\n41:12 'cause John 15:7 says,\n\n41:15 \"If you abide in me and my word in you,\n\n41:17 you ask what you will it should be done.\"\n\n41:20 Now in that context as the average Christian,\n\n41:24 Adventist Christian what does that mean.\n\n41:26 Well, a wife, a car, a job,\n\n41:29 that's not what that text is saying.\n\n41:30 Contextual saying, if you'll abide in me,\n\n41:33 my word in you, you ask what you will.\n\n41:35 So that means you're not asking your will\n\n41:36 because if you're in Christ and His word is in you,\n\n41:39 you gonna ask the will of God,\n\n41:41 of course the will of God that you be fruitful.\n\n41:45 And it says by this shall you be my disciple.\n\n41:49 So that can clear it...\n\n41:52 So go ahead.\n\n41:53 So I was gonna ask Dr. Laverne here\n\n41:56 during that time\n\n41:57 when your husband was lying there\n\n42:01 for those seven days\n\n42:02 and you were into that word and doing as Doc is saying,\n\n42:07 you were abiding in Christ.\n\n42:09 Tell us about your journey during that time?\n\n42:11 What were you doing during that time?\n\n42:15 What I was doing was of course, praying.\n\n42:19 But I was praying\n\n42:20 and I had to grab hold to promises\n\n42:25 because there was a lot of negativity.\n\n42:28 Constantly.\n\n42:29 Constantly coming to me, he was not going to live\n\n42:32 and so I knew in my mind and I spoke to God\n\n42:36 and I voiced I said,\n\n42:38 \"Lord, I know you didn't bring us over here.\n\n42:42 For me to bring him home in a box.\"\n\n42:45 That's not an option. Yes.\n\n42:47 That is not an option.\n\n42:49 So I need to know\n\n42:51 what it is that you would have for me to do\n\n42:54 because I know it's something.\n\n42:56 You know I'm not asking why this happened.\n\n42:59 What is it that you would have us to do?\n\n43:01 Give me what that is, and of course,\n\n43:04 he flooded me with his word\n\n43:06 and the most precious one is in Isaiah 43,\n\n43:10 you know when you go to the flood and all you know,\n\n43:13 yes, I will be with you.\n\n43:15 And so he let me know that he was going to be with me\n\n43:18 and whatever my needs were,\n\n43:20 and I am the type of the individual\n\n43:22 because I kept thinking okay, Lord,\n\n43:24 here we are, we got here.\n\n43:28 I didn't have time to change the phone,\n\n43:30 so I don't have a phone.\n\n43:32 I don't have the money that I need\n\n43:34 because I figured two weeks we didn't need what we need\n\n43:36 and you know I would have what I needed.\n\n43:38 Two week trips\n\n43:39 because we were back in two weeks.\n\n43:41 Two weeks...\n\n43:42 Two months.\n\n43:43 And so I said, okay Lord,\n\n43:45 now I don't have a means of transportation.\n\n43:48 I'm living with an individual, they don't have a car,\n\n43:51 the individual that's supposed to drive us\n\n43:53 don't have a license right now for some reason.\n\n43:56 So here I am no money, no phone,\n\n43:58 no means of getting around and then here\n\n44:02 I know my family's getting ready wanting to come\n\n44:05 because I had to let them know,\n\n44:07 I couldn't just keep it silent.\n\n44:09 Right, because you needed prayers...\n\n44:12 I needed prayers, I needed resources\n\n44:14 and I needed strength from the brethren.\n\n44:18 Yes.\n\n44:20 And from my family and so the,\n\n44:23 and I said, Lord, you know\n\n44:24 I am a person that lights I have A in place\n\n44:29 and then I got B in place\n\n44:30 and I got C if B doesn't work.\n\n44:33 So you had to be able to tolerate\n\n44:35 a little bit of uncertainty.\n\n44:37 Yeah.\n\n44:38 So the Lord said to me right now\n\n44:40 you can have A B or C.\n\n44:42 I'm your A B and C.\n\n44:44 I am A, he said,\n\n44:45 \"You got to trust in me and leave it in my hand.\"\n\n44:48 and then he took me to\n\n44:50 when Abraham went up and took Isaac\n\n44:53 and he was all the struggle in his mind\n\n44:56 but God said,\n\n44:57 \"I am Jehovah Jireh, I provide.\"\n\n45:01 And so I saw it every need he provided it\n\n45:05 when I needed it,\n\n45:07 so I had bills over here where I am,\n\n45:10 I got bills over in America that's got to be done.\n\n45:13 And the Lord took care every last one of them.\n\n45:17 But the most thing that was so special is the day,\n\n45:21 the night that he got in the hospital\n\n45:23 and I was needing a phone\n\n45:25 because so I could make phone calls.\n\n45:28 There was a guy who come,\n\n45:30 the people were getting ready\n\n45:33 to come to church that next day to see us at church.\n\n45:37 And here they're getting messages\n\n45:39 as they're on their way to church\n\n45:41 that he's in ICU in the hospital,\n\n45:44 and of course what the saying was,\n\n45:46 \"That can't be Thomas Jackson, no,\n\n45:49 the health men in the hospital.\"\n\n45:52 So anyway they came,\n\n45:54 and one of the guys that came,\n\n45:55 he says Sister Jackson, he said,\n\n45:57 \"What is it that you need, he said,\n\n45:59 because I have a friend here who has AIDS\n\n46:03 and I was going to bring him to the church.\n\n46:07 So he could talk to Brother Jackson.\n\n46:10 He said, now my friend has two phones.\n\n46:13 I said I needed a phone.\n\n46:14 He says, well, okay I'm gonna ask my friend.\n\n46:17 His friend gave that phone.\n\n46:19 And I kept that phone for two months.\n\n46:22 And he said, well, what do you need?\n\n46:23 I said I need international minutes.\n\n46:25 So he took that phone right away and came back\n\n46:28 and brought me a phone for international minutes\n\n46:31 so that I could make contact.\n\n46:33 I needed a vehicle.\n\n46:34 I couldn't drive over there,\n\n46:36 somebody had a church in Manchester\n\n46:40 called the girl's father\n\n46:43 who was come to see him as well,\n\n46:45 and says, they got to need a vehicle.\n\n46:47 He said, I am going to let them use my vehicle\n\n46:50 so to gas or will I tell you what\n\n46:52 I give them my vehicle\n\n46:53 and then out when I get back.\n\n46:55 I can drive your vehicle\n\n46:57 because the guy who was there that gave his vehicle,\n\n46:59 he was a instructor, driving instructor.\n\n47:04 So he had insurance on his where anybody could drive.\n\n47:08 Wow! God provided that.\n\n47:10 Now listen, not only that,\n\n47:12 the guy was going to turn in and turn his insurance in\n\n47:17 because he wasn't doing this service anymore.\n\n47:20 And the company told,\n\n47:21 no, you got to keep it for another two months,\n\n47:23 so the Lord set that up\n\n47:25 and then the guy who had the car\n\n47:27 couldn't sell the car and so he had us sit there\n\n47:30 waiting for us and use it, isn't that awesome.\n\n47:32 Oh.\n\n47:33 So every step God provided the means\n\n47:36 and whatever's needed before hand\n\n47:39 we just had to trust that he was going to be able to,\n\n47:42 to do what needs to be.\n\n47:44 And then I didn't know,\n\n47:45 that once he was in the hospital 32 days.\n\n47:49 And in 32 days, he had to have rehabilitation,\n\n47:53 speech therapy, physical therapy,\n\n47:56 writing, all of these in just 32 days.\n\n48:00 It's amazing and I praise the Lord\n\n48:03 that with his brain not having the oxygen,\n\n48:07 he could have lost short term,\n\n48:10 long term memory when he waken up.\n\n48:12 He couldn't, not even known us.\n\n48:15 That would have been devastating.\n\n48:17 But the Lord worked there where he remembered everything\n\n48:22 but just that the just had happened.\n\n48:25 And so when we were able to get him out of the hospital\n\n48:29 and then take him to a place\n\n48:31 where we can rehabilitate him outside...\n\n48:34 Country place was provided for us.\n\n48:36 And in that way we were able to bring him home\n\n48:40 after we got everything you know\n\n48:42 back in order what it needed to be.\n\n48:44 So I just thank God for how he works\n\n48:47 and still and all you know they still don't know\n\n48:50 we've been to specialists and all.\n\n48:53 But we know that you know what came to my mind again,\n\n48:56 as he was in the hospital.\n\n48:58 There I think\n\n49:02 his in the gospel where it says,\n\n49:04 you know when the man came and they brought him down\n\n49:08 through the roof and put him down\n\n49:10 and they said, that that was a strange act.\n\n49:13 I believe that this was a strange act.\n\n49:17 And our adapted father says\n\n49:20 that this was a present day Lazarus.\n\n49:24 Oh, really? Really.\n\n49:25 And that's how we introduce him.\n\n49:27 Yes, we had to have a present day Lazarus\n\n49:30 for people to realize that God plan works\n\n49:34 and that God is still in a business...\n\n49:36 Being faithful, God is faithful.\n\n49:37 Of answering prayer.\n\n49:39 That's right.\n\n49:40 You know, 'cause some prayers\n\n49:42 it takes him a little longer to do\n\n49:43 but this when we saw that he raised him up\n\n49:46 and it was a strange act that our God performed.\n\n49:49 Mercy, mercy, mercy. Yeah, thank you Lord.\n\n49:53 That's the kind of God we serve.\n\n49:54 Yes.\n\n49:55 It makes you want to shout.\n\n49:57 Okay, listen I've been shouting.\n\n49:59 I know you have. Have been shouting.\n\n50:02 He is literally raised from the death.\n\n50:04 He is raised, that is true, he really is,\n\n50:07 strange, people wouldn't believe it.\n\n50:08 Yeah.\n\n50:10 So he could come forward\n\n50:11 and even with his mind being intact to the point that\n\n50:15 you know when, when he got into,\n\n50:17 when we got in two part outside\n\n50:20 of two hours outside of London.\n\n50:21 We started making him do presentations\n\n50:25 to see to make that brain fire, you know.\n\n50:29 And I tell you he would get there,\n\n50:31 and at first he was a little hesitate\n\n50:34 but that brain kicked in and a Holy Spirit kicked in\n\n50:38 and it renewed every one of those\n\n50:40 nerves neuron you know.\n\n50:42 Yes, every synapse...\n\n50:43 Every synapse. Is firing.\n\n50:45 One thing that I'd like to bring attention to,\n\n50:48 to is the...\n\n50:51 basically you know how you go through a trial\n\n50:54 you can react.\n\n50:55 There's different ways that you can react.\n\n50:57 You can either rely on God or you can blame God.\n\n50:59 Oh, yes.\n\n51:01 And a lot of people tend to blame God,\n\n51:02 but you had faith\n\n51:04 and you held on to the Word of God,\n\n51:06 people were praying.\n\n51:08 Yeah, I mean that's, that's huge.\n\n51:09 And God honor that.\n\n51:11 He did, he did.\n\n51:13 We had a system\n\n51:15 because when I talked to the office\n\n51:17 I mentioned to them, I said, you know,\n\n51:19 I want to synchronize the prayers.\n\n51:21 So it when one prayer is going to we're all praying\n\n51:24 at the same time even though I'm here\n\n51:28 and six hours later, I'm praying at the same time.\n\n51:30 So I believe that as a result of those prayers going up\n\n51:34 around the world same time,\n\n51:37 God was hearing and answering those prayers.\n\n51:40 Mightily for what he...\n\n51:41 I know that time is running\n\n51:43 but something else very affirming.\n\n51:46 We have a cardiologist that goes to our church,\n\n51:49 wonderful man.\n\n51:51 He stayed with my wife on a phone,\n\n51:54 but he does not specialize,\n\n51:55 what happened to me\n\n51:57 it was the electrical current in my heart went\n\n52:01 and I want to...\n\n52:02 Shut down.\n\n52:03 Shut down, though when I woke up\n\n52:06 and after God continued to download his plan\n\n52:10 and continue unveil that.\n\n52:12 And there's the doctors and surgeons around\n\n52:17 and I wake up and a verse just flow from my mouth\n\n52:22 as though I'm speaking to people\n\n52:24 who understand the language.\n\n52:26 Proverbs 26:2,\n\n52:29 I said, Doc, the curse causeless shall not come\n\n52:34 and I quote myself,\n\n52:35 but these folks all know what I mean by that.\n\n52:39 And I quote myself and said,\n\n52:41 I said doc there's a cause for everything,\n\n52:44 you agree with that.\n\n52:45 So I said, what is your diagnosis?\n\n52:49 And he said you heart tip top shape.\n\n52:55 Your arteries are clean as a baby.\n\n53:00 You see you don't smoke, you don't drink.\n\n53:03 So it's a rarity.\n\n53:05 I said, doc, have you all checked it up.\n\n53:07 Now if ever the content my father but I know,\n\n53:10 when my mother died from,\n\n53:12 so you know so they have nothing.\n\n53:17 So doc, what's the prognosis?\n\n53:20 Now I'm asking these questions\n\n53:22 and he was getting little bit of...\n\n53:24 I'm a very observant person\n\n53:26 and so I'm getting little agitated,\n\n53:27 I said Doc, I'm not asking these questions\n\n53:31 to question your professionality,\n\n53:34 I'll plow the intervention and emergency,\n\n53:39 but by the way does not the patient\n\n53:42 have the right to know that's all I'm asking.\n\n53:46 Okay, but anyway\n\n53:48 I think so as it will with a situation like this\n\n53:51 there's electrical current my heart.\n\n53:53 Then who says it's not going to happen again.\n\n53:55 Say, well, this what we have do to him,\n\n53:58 all right talk to me, Doc.\n\n53:59 Well, we're seeing a little electric bolt to your brain.\n\n54:04 You got to hit the right spot,\n\n54:05 the right node in your right chamber of heart\n\n54:07 and we're just going to destroy to wipe it out.\n\n54:11 I just said...\n\n54:12 They call it burning it.\n\n54:13 Burning what?\n\n54:15 Burning the cell...\n\n54:16 There's a node that control electrical current,\n\n54:18 they just wiped it out,\n\n54:20 so what it meant to my man then what,\n\n54:23 you know when and what.\n\n54:24 And so,\n\n54:26 God is just downloading thoughts,\n\n54:28 I said, Doc, I said, I really appreciate your help.\n\n54:31 But I was saying I cannot agree\n\n54:34 with that procedure because you don't know\n\n54:37 because you see that there's something wrong\n\n54:39 with electrical current in my body\n\n54:41 cause to see electrical current.\n\n54:43 I have read and teach out,\n\n54:46 God is in doubt his people\n\n54:49 with a certain amount of vital force,\n\n54:52 a vital force is electrical energy\n\n54:54 that's life\n\n54:57 and electrical current is gone.\n\n54:59 So I got turned my fold here,\n\n55:01 I did not have a heart attack,\n\n55:02 I don't have cancer,\n\n55:04 vital force was capped out of me,\n\n55:08 you know what I'm saying,\n\n55:09 vital force.\n\n55:11 So I said no Doc, I want to get to States.\n\n55:14 He said, okay, because patients\n\n55:15 and he said well there's only two places\n\n55:17 in close proximity that they do this\n\n55:21 that's Vanderbilt, that's Nashville,\n\n55:24 the universal of Alabama,\n\n55:25 so our cardiologist goes, you know,\n\n55:29 very wonderful guy,\n\n55:30 I had fast forward get back home,\n\n55:33 he has all the paperwork he stayed on the phone.\n\n55:35 My wife got all the documents.\n\n55:38 And I went into his office and when he saw me,\n\n55:40 tears is rolled down his eyes,\n\n55:42 he just cried and we prayed together.\n\n55:46 But this is my last point and I thought he had,\n\n55:50 he already had my paperwork everything about\n\n55:51 this operation said, Doc, what about his operation,\n\n55:55 he said, I'll tell you what well,\n\n55:57 that's only one person I know that specialize is\n\n55:59 he's two hours away from us,\n\n56:01 Memphis, he is Asian doctor.\n\n56:04 He said, I set you a appointment you go there.\n\n56:08 Now it's so stereotyped mind because Asian doctor,\n\n56:12 he don't believe in Christianity,\n\n56:14 he's not gonna pray with me so I...\n\n56:17 He believes in Buddha.\n\n56:18 Yeah.\n\n56:22 God said, you abide in me, I got to go.\n\n56:24 So I'm sitting there my wife in an examination room.\n\n56:28 I'm on the table.\n\n56:29 Dr Lon open a door, he comes in, he has,\n\n56:34 so he looks at my wife greets her,\n\n56:36 then he looks like I'm looking at Jason.\n\n56:38 He has a look I never seen a doctor face.\n\n56:42 Can I get up for a moment. Yes.\n\n56:43 Then he walked over to me like this\n\n56:46 he said, \"God is good to you.\"\n\n56:50 Wow.\n\n56:53 I looked at him that resonate\n\n56:56 as this man he said, 15 percent of the people\n\n56:59 that he that does survive this\n\n57:03 that he's operated on don't survive,\n\n57:06 you know far as.\n\n57:08 So 85 percent of people\n\n57:10 who have what you had don't survive.\n\n57:13 If they are vegetables were not here.\n\n57:16 And I said doc, I know time is running out,\n\n57:18 I said, Doc, what about the surgery,\n\n57:21 he said, okay, let me keep you on a check.\n\n57:23 Let me keep you on the check.\n\n57:25 You know check me for weeks check,\n\n57:27 went back about a month or two ago,\n\n57:29 he said, and he just saw me my parents\n\n57:34 but I'm still going to a guy,\n\n57:35 I said, Doc, what about this operation.\n\n57:37 He said, there's no markers, what can they fire.\n\n57:41 I see you next year.\n\n57:43 Wow!\n\n57:44 I can't thank you enough for being with us.\n\n57:47 Thank you, may God bless you.\n\n57:49 Our time is up, I can't believe our time is up.\n\n57:52 Thank you, thank you.\n\n57:54 And make sure you tune in next time,\n\n57:56 'cause it just wouldn't be the same without you."
