        "text": "Donald Trump targeted Special Counsel Jack Smith this week after Smith “attacked” the judge presiding over Trump’s classified documents case in Florida, RadarOnline.com can report.\n\nTrump rushed to Truth Social early Thursday morning shortly after Special Counsel Smith filed a briefing that criticized the way Judge Aileen Cannon was handling the ex-president’s criminal classified documents case.\n\n“Deranged ‘Special’ Counsel Jack Smith, who has a long record of failure as a prosecutor, including a unanimous decision against him in the U.S. Supreme Court, should be sanctioned or censured for the way he is attacking a highly respected Judge, Aileen Cannon, who is presiding over his FAKE Documents Hoax case in Florida,” Trump fumed on Truth Social at 7:55 AM on Thursday morning.\n\n“He is a lowlife who is nasty, rude, and condescending, and obviously trying to ‘play the ref,’” the 45th president continued. “He shouldn’t even be allowed to participate in this sham case, where I, unlike Crooked Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, and all the rest, come under the Presidential Records Act.”\n\n“I DID NOTHING WRONG, BUT BIDEN DID, AND THEY LET HIM OFF SCOT-FREE. HOW DID THAT HAPPEN, JACK?” Trump concluded. “A TWO TIERED SYSTEM OF JUSTICE. ELECTION INTERFERENCE!”\n\nAs RadarOnline.com previously reported, Trump’s fiery Truth Social post on Thursday morning came just hours after Special Counsel Smith filed a fiery briefing of his own against Judge Cannon on Wednesday.\n\nJudge Cannon argued that ex-President Trump could claim the classified documents found in his possession at Mar-a-Lago in August 2022 as personal records – an argument that Smith called “pure fiction.”\n\nSmith further suggested that Judge Cannon’s argument would “distort” Trump’s upcoming classified documents trial because the argument was based on a “fundamentally flawed legal premise.”\n\nAlso surprising was the special counsel’s threat to \"seek prompt appellate review\" if Judge Cannon did not toss the personal records argument – a move that could subsequently see Judge Cannon removed from Trump’s classified documents case entirely.\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for the RadarOnline.com newsletter to get your daily dose of dope. Daily. Breaking. Celebrity news. All free.\n\nAs RadarOnline.com reported, Trump’s classified documents trial was initially scheduled to start on May 20 in Fort Pierce, Florida.\n\nJudge Cannon has since nixed that start day. It is currently unclear whether Trump will stand trial for the criminal classified document charges against him before the general election on November 5."
