        "text": "Last Updated on February 7, 2024, 9:54 AM | Published: February 7, 2024\n\nThe United States Department of Justice sends this information as posted below:\n\nNORMAN MAN TO SERVE NEARLY FIVE YEARS IN FEDERAL PRISON FOR LYING About Not Being Under Felony Indictment or Subject to Protective Order when he attempted to purchase a firearm\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY – Earlier this week, THOMAS LAVERNE BROWN, 50, of Norman, was sentenced to serve 57 months in federal prison for making a false statement during the attempted purchase of a firearm, announced U.S. Attorney Robert J. Troester.\n\nOn January 17, 2023, a federal grand jury returned a four-count Indictment against Brown, charging him with making a false statement during the attempted purchase of a firearm, two counts of possession of an unregistered firearm, and possession of firearms by a prohibited person. The Indictment further alleges that in August 2022, Brown was found in possession of several firearms. On June 6, 2023, Brown pleaded guilty to making a false statement during the attempted firearm purchase.\n\nAccording to public record, on August 20, 2021, Brown was charged with felony domestic assault and battery by strangulation in Cleveland County District Court case number CF-2021-1139. Public record further reflects that on October 6, 2021, a protective order had been issued against Brown in Cleveland County District Court case number PO-2021-328. That protective order was effective through October 6, 2026. In July 2022, Brown then attempted to purchase a firearm at a Norman pawn shop. Under federal law, it is illegal to receive a firearm while under indictment for a felony or possess a firearm while subject to a protective order. In connection with that attempted purchase, Brown filled out paperwork for the National Instant Criminal Background Check System and falsely indicated on the paperwork that he was not under indictment for a felony or subject to a protective order.\n\nAt the sentencing hearing on January 29, 2024, U.S. District Judge Stephen P. Friot sentenced Brown to serve 57 months in federal prison, followed by three years of supervised release. In announcing the sentence, the court noted the nature and circumstances of the offense and the need to promote respect for the law.\n\nThis case is the result of an investigation by Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. Assistant U.S. Attorney Wilson D. McGarry prosecuted the case.\n\nThis case is also part of “Operation 922.” Operation 922 is the Western District of Oklahoma’s implementation of Project Safe Neighborhoods, the Department of Justice’s signature initiative to reduce gun violence and enforce federal firearms laws. “Operation 922” prioritizes prosecution of federal crimes connected to domestic violence. For more information about Project Safe Neighborhoods, please visit https://justice.gov/psn and https://justice.gov/usao-wdok.\n\nReference is made to public filings for additional information."
