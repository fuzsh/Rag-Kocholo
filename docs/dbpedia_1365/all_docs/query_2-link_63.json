        "text": "When Laverne Cox steps foot into her luxurious New York City apartment, she can finally exhale. Inside the 634-square-foot studio that the Emmy-nominated actor, producer, and advocate calls home, she feels fully embraced. Even though the Manhattan spot isn’t the first small space that she’s ever lived in, it marks the first apartment that Cox owns—and it feels right at this stage in her life.\n\n“There’s something really cool about things being scaled back,” she says over a Zoom call from a seat at her glossy onyx table. “You can’t have clutter here. I’m more mindful of throwing things out and cleaning up after myself when I’m here.... You have to let go of a lot of stuff. There’s something beautiful about simplifying your life.”\n\nCox’s realtor found the property in 2020 while the actor was in town shooting Inventing Anna, the popular Netflix series created and produced by Shonda Rhimes about a real-life fake heiress. Apparently, he had a strong feeling that Cox would respond to the building—and evidently, that hunch was correct. “We looked at maybe 15 places, and this was the last one,” Cox recalls. “It’s an emotional thing; you walk in and you feel the space. You just know.”\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nWhat really sold her on the apartment was the location of the building, but the bones were so good that Cox didn’t anticipate doing a gut renovation. In fact, she passed on other places that seemed like big fixer-upper projects. But ever since she started watching small-space videos on YouTube years ago, she’s been fixated on the Pivot Apartment, a modular layout concept designed by architect and small-space expert Robert Garneau from Architecture Workshop PC. So when the opportunity presented itself to reconfigure the layout, Cox hired Garneau for the job.\n\n“I was excited about the challenge of a studio and making it really functional by maximizing storage,” she explains. “I was already familiar with Robert’s work, so I knew he was the one.”\n\nCox’s vision was to enhance the high level of workmanship with a touch of luxury through high-end finishes like brass inlay. She also gravitated toward a monochromatic palette with a mix of moody paint colors from Benjamin Moore (Stone, Amber Slate, and Overcoat). Cox describes the apartment’s aesthetic as “minimalist cozy luxury,” emphasizing that she wanted something modern that didn’t feel cold. “That’s what this apartment was about, and that’s the design I tend to respond to,” she adds. “I love textures, fabrics, and things that are tactile and feel like a warm hug, but I also like clean lines.”\n\n“It was very much about the mood, the vibe, the gasp that needed to be felt!” Garneau adds. “We had to do a lot of research on samples which ultimately allowed us to craft a meticulous and unique home tailored specifically for her. I am very proud of how everything turned out, especially how much she loves her new home.”\n\nThe entire renovation has taken a full year to complete, but Cox has been sharing every phase of the process on her YouTube channel. “Part of me wanting to document on YouTube was about being like, ‘Hopefully people can get ideas about what they can do with their small spaces and make [them] a little more luxurious,’” she explains. “There’s creative ways that people can make it work, especially if you live in a place like New York where it’s really expensive.”\n\nComing up with the final design was a six-month process, but she appreciated Garneau’s meticulous attention to detail. “Part of the reason I went with him was I felt like he would keep me calm during the process and help manage my expectations around things,” Cox notes.\n\nThe most drastic change was expanding the entry closet, which Cox hails as “genius.” It was Garneau’s idea to create cabinetry, and once he confirmed there were no pipes behind the drywall, he opened it up and added shelving for her wardrobe. (Cox insists that she’s “not an organized person by nature,” but now that’s hard to believe.) She didn’t alter the original layout of the apartment—she kept the mahogany floors, but slightly upgraded them to look and feel more modern.\n\nRenovating isn’t for the faint of heart, and Cox had her moments of frustration throughout this process, which were caused by supply-chain delays, the struggle to find the right-sized mattress for her motorized Murphy bed with a tufted headboard, and behind-the-scenes technical issues, among other things. (Most people don’t want to talk about compromises that were made, but Cox doesn’t refrain from recounting every inconvenience—major or minor.)\n\nNonetheless, she is beyond proud of what she managed to accomplish within her budget. Based on this experience, Cox would love to see more conversations being had about avoiding overly lavish lifestyles. “I’m 50 years old, and I bought my first place four years ago, so there was a lot of catching up to do—and all of that is okay,” she says. “You can be a star, and you don’t have to ball out to live well. I’m all about living modestly but living well.”\n\nAs her taste in interiors continues to evolve, Cox is becoming an even more intentional curator. The vibe in this home is constantly shifting, but it remains a safe space where she can take a respite from the outside world. “My life is big and wonderful, but it’s chaotic,” she says. “It’s about surrounding yourself with whatever you feel is beautiful that makes you exhale.”\n\nNow that Cox has been bit by the renovation bug, she’s already thinking about how to upgrade the guest bedroom and bathroom in her Los Angeles house to add a little more character. She adds, “I learned so much doing this that I’ll bring into the next renovation, but I’m going to need a break!”"
