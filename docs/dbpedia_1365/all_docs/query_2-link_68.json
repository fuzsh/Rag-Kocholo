Prosecutor Guy W. Calissi and First Assistant Prosecutor Fred C. Galda said Ronald Paul Marrone, Fair Lawn sophomore, track star, and choir boy, signed a statement of confession last night after having dictated the details of the killing early in the morning.

Calissi, right, Ronald Marrone arrives at the Paramus Borough Hall, yesterday, where minutes later he was arraigned in the rape-slaying of bis classmate, Ruth Starr Zeitler .\n\nDetectives were led to the youth when they found he bad a prior record. Ronald Marrone. 18, of Fair Lawn, center, wearing a Sunday School attendance pin, tells Bergea County Prosecutor Guy W. Calissi, right, and First Assistant Prosecutor Fred C. Galda how he strangled his pretty 15-year-old classmate at Fair Lawn High School, Ruth Starr Zeitler .\n\nThe scene was a wooded glen yesterday in Paramus where, the youth admitted, he raped and strangled the girl May 17. Her body was found by two boys last Thursday. FORMOSA QUIET Former Neighbors Recall Fears, But Confession Shocks Friends of the confession, but said ther was apparently a struggle in the car Marrone drove into the wooded area at noon on May 17. He said Marrone lifted the girl from the car, placed her on the ground, and took her clothing and school books from the vehicle and placed them about 20 feet from the body. The youth then stuffed a wad of tissue into the girl's mouth, Galda said .\n\nHe quoted the youth, whose home is at 15-19 Elmary Place, Fair Lawn, as saying the girl was breathing when he removed her from the auto but that breathing stopped after he put the gag in her mouth. An autopsy report showed the girl had been criminally attacked. Authorities said Marrone went to New York's Madison Squar Garden on the night of the slaying to hear evangelist Billy Graham. The dark, crew-cut youth was described as extremely devout by the Rev. William Brownson, pastor of the Second Reformed Church of Lodi; Mr .\n\nBrownson said the boy always carried the Bible in his pocket. Marrone was president of the young people's group of the church, a substitute Sunday school teacher, and a member of the choir. Galda said Marrone picked up Miss Zeitler in a car at 11:30 A. M. on the day of the murder, drove her to the deserted area alongside a branch -of the Saddle River, where he said he killed her, and managed to return to classes by 12:28 P .\n\nM. KEY TIP The girl, a pretty brunette, had left her home for afternoon classes at the High School May 17. She did not arrive for classes, and never returned home. When her body was found, her white plastic belt was knotted twice about her neck. Most of her clothing was rolled in a ball' nearby .\n\nJohn J.

HOLLER Reaction was divided today when it was reported Ronald Marrone, 18-year-old Fair Lawn High School track star and Bible class president,\" had confessed to the rape-slaying of RUth Starr Zeitler, classmate and friend. to the jury today .\n\nafter his family returned to this arer from Baltimore, a little more than 1 year ago. To his friends in Fair Lawn, thi boy was considered a stand-ou' trackman, quiet, very religious a member of the Order of DeMolay, and well-groomed. Living at 15-19 Elmary Place, Fair Lawn, his past behind him, Ronnie is reputed to have raced his into the hearts of teammates; and spectators who wit-nessl his feats on cross-country and cinder tracks throughout the County. Stripped of his track shoes, Ronnie slipped into obscurity. Not much is known \"of his personal Locker-room intimates knew him as a person with, an immense interest in track, very religious and one of those fortunate high-school lads with a car .\n\n\"He was a kindly, sympathetic sort of a person,\" confided a teammate. But in the Woodmere section of Lodi, his former neighborhood, Ronnie's presence was looked upon with fear and contempt, contempt especially so yesterday afternoon. \"When the story broke and his name was mentioned as the last person to have seen' Ruth alive, down deep in our hearts we knew,\" one Lodi father said. Marrone freely admitted his past in Lodi, when reminded yesterday, but explained it away by saying: \"God has forgiven me for that.\" Of slaying 15-year-old Ruth he said: \"I hope God will forgive me for that.\" MORE THAN SO QUIZZED Galda quoted the youth as repeating, \"I'm making this statement to God. I'm telling this to God\" as he held tightly to his Bible, which he was said to make a habit of carrying in his pocket .\n\nCalissi said Marrone began to give his statement shortly after 7 A. when he was brought to the Prosecutor's Office in Hackensack for the third time. He was among more than 50 persons questioned in a round-the-clock investigation launched after two boys found the girl's body Thursday evening at the end of a half-mile dirt road leading into the woods from Dunkerhook Road in Paramus. Announcing the Fair Lawn youth had signed the statement, Galda gave only sketchy details CONDUCT RITES FOR SLAIN GIRL Solem Requiem Mass Is Said At St. Anne's Fair Lawn A 14-car-proces- sion, escorted by tnree uorougn mptorcycle policemen, this morning carried pretty 15-year-old Ruth Starr Zeitler to St .\n\nAnne's R. C. Church where a solemn requiem mass was said at 9:40 A. M. The first two cars in the procession bore flowers, the third carried the girl's silver-tone casket, and the fourth was occupied by the girl's family .\n\nIn the car were the girl's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Zeitler; her maternal grandmother, Mrs. Ruth Feldman; her paternal grandmother, Mrs. Jessie Zeitler; Mrs .\n\nWilliam Taylor, and Paul Val-ente. Valente, 18, of Paterson, was Ruth's boy friend and said he hoped to marry her. The procession arrived at the church several minutes after the service was to begin. Swarms of school children and friends packed the church. Outside the church scores of newsmen and photographers were at work .\n\nAs the family left the car tears welled in the eyes of Mrs. Zeitler she was near collapse. Her husband and James Scullion, son of the funeral director, escorted Mrs. Zeitler from the car and up the steps of the church at Lyncrest Avenue and St. Anne Street .\n\nAs Mr. and Mrs. Zeitler and Scullion started up the steps, Mrs. Zeitler sagged near the ground and had to be held up by her two escorts. \"Please walk,\" she said to them .\n\nThe solemn requiem mass was said by the Rev. Hubert Woods, O. F. of St. Bonaventure's R .\n\nC. Church, Paterson, a friend of the family. He was assisted by the Rev. Bernard Sharpe, O. F .\n\ndeacon, and the Rev. Cor-mac McDonnell, O. F. sub-deacon, both of St. Anne's R .\n\nC. Church. The Rev. Capistran Pet-rie, O. F .\n\nis pastor of St. Anne's Church. The girl was buried later in Calvary Cemetery, Paterson, in a blue nylon dress. Directors of the Scullion Funeral Home, 267 Park Avenue, Paterson, said that scores of friends and school children visited tht Zeitler home to view the body. Mrs .\n\nZeitler was on the verge of collapse throughout the erth period, the directors added. DAILY CIRCULATION LAST MONTH 75,028 HOME DELIVERED fact, that Marrone allegedly drove Ruth to Radburn Center at her request, Woodmere residents remembered their fear of the slight in build, polite boy. For it was Marrone, who 3 years earlier, when a resident of 8 Lucille Drive, Lodi, had been seized in the act of gagging an 11-year-old girl with soft tissue in her mouth, allegedly attempting to assault her. Lodi residents said a local clergyman vouched for the boy's character, resulting in Marrone's acquittal. His parents subsequently moved, to Baltimore, Md .\n\nIt waj not much earlier that the same youth had been accused of forcing a 5-year-old girl to disrobe. The boy was not prosecuted for this charge. These facts, together with numerous other complaints, led to reaction on the part of these residents reports which early yesterday morning led to the arrest of Marrone. His father is an elder in the Second Reformed Church in Lodi. Young Ronnie was president of th; Young People's Bible Class and choir boy in the same church .\n\nPRICES HIGHER; TICKER TRAILS Heavy Trading Pushes Market Upwards Jew York. Mav 27 ()'.

Normal life was shattered in the wake of Friday's anti-American riots. Many persons feared that only the continued presence of Nationalist troops prevented a fresh outbreak. In addition to Taipei, four other Formosan cities where Americans live have now been put under martial law .\n\nThey are Taichung, Tainan, Chai, and the port city of Kaohsiung. The English-language China news condemned the riots as uncivilized and disgraceful to the Chinese people. But other Formosan newspapers continued to urge the Nationalist Government to press for an agreement giving it jurisdiction over criminal offenses committed in off-duty hours by U. S. military personnel .\n\nAmericans hesitated to drive their cars, fearing, an angry mob might materialize if they were involved in an accident with a Chinese. The U. S. Commissary and Post Exchange were reopened. But they had few customers, although Monday is usually a busy day .\n\nVice Admiral Stuart H. Ihger-soll, commander of the U. S. Seventy-seventh Fleet, broadcast this caution to the American colony: 1 \"It is hoped that American military personnel will have the good sense not to go on sightseeing trips.

He evidentally had strolled on to the toll road and was crossing it when hit .\n\nIdentified as the driver of the car was Peter Leissner, 17, of 33 Bergen Street, Garfield. He was driving a car owned by his uncle, Dr. Henry Dul of 164 Ackerman Street, Clifton. Because Leissner is a minor, police placed a juvenile delinquency complaint against him rather than the usual technical death-by-auto charge.

CAN'T BELIEVE IT \"I still can't believe that Rqn-nie did it he just doesn't seem the type,\" an acquaintance said. \"The entire neighborhood is breathing a lot easier, I can tell you that,\" a not so sympathetic observer and former neighbor said .\n\nAs the report circulated among those who knew Ronnie as Marrone the Miler, disbelief and shock proved to be the only adequate description to the act which Marrone allegedly committed on May 17. But to those, residents and parents living in the Woodmere section of Lodi, all one spokesman could say was: \"They feel a lot better now.\" Marrone was seen by residents walking in his old neighborhood the day; after Ruth's half-nude 'body was discovered in a Paramus glen. A successful runner for the Fair Lawn High School track' team during the past season, having scored 27 aggregate points for his squad, Marrone was admittedly the last person to have seen the slain teen-ager alive on May 17.

RELATIVES AT SLAIN 1 I CLERK IMPLICATED Frank Passaro, owner of the Wyckoff Pharmacy, was' the witness whose empty-handedness caused the temporary delay in the trial of the 23-year-old ex-marine for the March 4 murder of Victoria Zielinski in a Mahwah sand pit .\n\nIt was at the Wyckoff Pharmacy where Donald Hommell, 21, of Ramsey, was employed as a part-time clerk. Hommell has been implicated by the defense as the person who was seen last with the murdered girl. Passaro had been called as a rebuttal witness by defense attorney John E. Selser. Passaro angered both tle veteran trial lawyer and Judge Arthur O'Dea, who has presided during the Smith trial, when he said he had not brought the prescription records as he had been ordered in his subpeona .\n\nPassaro said he feared he would be violating rules of the State Board of Pharmacy. O'Dea declared that a court order supercedes any such ruling, and he ordered a County car to take Passaro to his Wyckoff drugstore and to return with the records. He adjourned the hearing until 12:30. Selser was not sure whether (Continued on page 2, column 2) enly small embankments on on ejthes side). Four children, including the Coddington boys' sister Joan, 10, were walking with the boy when the accident occurred .\n\nThey were Gill Harris. 10, Clifford Harris, 7, and Gerry Wildeboer, 6.

When Lattanzio, a former Lodi Councilman, read the stories of the case, he recalled tissue paper had been stuffed into the mouth of one of the small girls. Marrone was one of nearly 100 persons questioned in the cases involving the Lodi. assaults. The slain girl, known as Starr to her friends, was the daughter of Mr .\n\nand Mrs. Joseph Zeitler of 1-30 Lyons Avenue, in the Memorial Park section. Fair Lawn. She was to be buried today in Calvary Cemetery, Paterson. Marrone is the son of Mr .\n\nand Mrs. Paul Marrone of 15-8 Ll- mary Place, Fair Lawn. He has' a brother, Paul 15. He was also a member of the High School track team. SWITCHED HABIT Calissi and Galda said authorities began to suspect Marrone when they learned the youth did not take a customary ride with Starr another boy and girl before afternoon classes on the day of the slaying .\n\nThe other boy and girl did not take the lide; only Miss Zeitler accompanied Marrone in his mother's gray car. Assistant Prosecutors Frank J. Cuccio and William J. Arnold said that soon after the girl's body was found police went through records dating back 4 years, to find a clue to the murder. The records disclosed the attacks on the two small Lodi girls .\n\nand the questioning of Marrone among the suspects. Police said Marrnne was released in those cases be cause he had an alibi for the time the assaults took place. When Marrone was first questioned at Paramus police head quarters Friday and then again at the Prosecutor Office he said he had picked up the girl not far from her home but dropped her off at the Radburn shopping center. He wa; reported also as having gone with his father to the Zeitler home to tell that story to the girl's parents Friday morn ing, when he said he beard the girl was missing.
