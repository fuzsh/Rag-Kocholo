        "text": "RALEIGH — A Fuquay-Varina man faces up to 20 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to a scheme to defraud the Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan by conspiring to obtain matching charitable contributions for the Boys and Girls Succeed organization.\n\nDwayne Moorer West, 60, will be sentenced later this year, a news release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of North Carolina says. Two co-conspirators pleaded guilty to the same charges Jan. 23 and face up to 20 years behind bars as well.\n\n“This defendant recruited PSC employees to make fake donations to his charity so he could fraudulently secure over a half-million dollars in matching funds from PSC,” U.S. Attorney Michael Easley said in the release. “He then paid kickbacks to the employees.”\n\nWest owned BAGS, an organization that provided services to boys and girls in Wake County, documents and information presented in court say. From 2010 to 2018, he, Michael Lavern King, a PCS employee, and Martin Fareed Abdullah, a BAGS employee, obtained matching charitable contributions from PCS.\n\nKing and Abdullah solicited multiple PCS employees in the fraud, the release says. West obtained high-dollar checks that fraudulently showed donations from the PCS employees to BAGS. The checks were then used as donation receipts for submitting matching contributions requests to PCS.\n\nThe PCS employees then received a quarterly kickback from West, Abdullah and King for the use of their employee information, the release says.\n\nIn total, PCS matched nearly $600,000 in contributions.\n\nThe U.S. Postal Inspection Service investigated the case, which was prosecuted by Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Lisa K. Labresh."
