        "text": "The world of education has nourished and inspired Leverne Marshall for a long time.\n\nHis mother was a teacher for 41 years, and all four of his aunts taught school.\n\n“She was very strict,” he said of his mother’s classroom style, “but she was a great motivator. She knew how to motivate children to learn.”\n\nHe recalled watching his mother teach elementary school and listening to the messages she’d deliver to her students.\n\n“She pointed out to the kids that they were smart, that they were intelligent, that they were somebody,” he said. “And she said it to them every day.”\n\nWhen children are given those kinds of messages, Marshall said, “they begin to believe that.”\n\nExperienced principal, new challenge\n\nAs Lynchburg City Schools opened on Monday, Marshall introduced himself as principal of Sandusky Middle School. Maria Jaeger, the previous principal, was appointed the district’s new coordinator of math and science.\n\nBefore this year, Marshall served as principal of William Marvin Bass Elementary School — a job he’s held since 1994. He’s also worked as principal of Dearington Elementary School and Appomattox Middle School.\n\nAt Sandusky Middle, a school of about 570 students, Marshall faces challenges surrounding the state Standards of Learning tests. The school has been accredited with warning for three years in a row, based on SOL test scores. Last year’s scores have not yet been reported.\n\nDuring Marshall’s tenure at Bass Elementary, test scores soared.\n\n“Mr. Marshall has had a track record of excellence at Bass Elementary School for the last several years there, particularly when it comes to SOL testing,” said Scott Brabrand, superintendent of Lynchburg City Schools. “I thought he would be an excellent person to lead Sandusky with the challenges of the new, more rigorous SOLs.”\n\nBrabrand said Marshall was interviewed by an advisory group made up of teachers, administrators and parents and received a recommendation from that group. Brabrand interviewed him as well.\n\nAs Marshall prepared to begin his work, he noted the need for children to have a sense of hope as they attend school.\n\n“The focus is that you have to have hope, and you’ve got to be able to dream,” he said. “That’s the goal for our kids.”\n\nMarshall noted Sandusky Middle School is among several area schools that recently received a grant from the Virginia Department of Education through the 21st Century Learning Centers program.\n\n“We can give kids extra help, an extra push in the afternoon, after school,” he said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nHe said it was important to give parents opportunities to participate in school activity, but he emphasized that parental involvement with a child’s education can grow into many shapes.\n\n“You can be involved at home,” he said. “You can help the child with homework and read the child a story. You can make sure the child is fed before coming to school.”\n\nThe hopes of the first day\n\nOn Monday students were upbeat, with all of the first-day hopes that often hover above students this time of year. They greeted Marshall as he stood in front of the cafeteria and chatted with them as they trekked to lunch.\n\n“I’m not an office person,” Marshall said.\n\nMakayla Tolliver, a seventh-grader, said she was looking forward to making new friends and meeting her teachers — and also to taking more social studies courses. She said she likes the subject because it lets her “learn about people in the past who inspire me.”\n\nTerry Bright, a seventh-grade English teacher, noted the importance of building community, and she said she plays a YouTube snippet of the song “Getting to Know You,” from the musical “The King and I,” as she and the students introduce each other.\n\nAcademic work also entered the first-day scenario on Monday. Bright delivered a presentation about her interests — she called it “My Bag” — that served as a kind of model for future student reports. She reviewed prefixes and administered a diagnostic test about plot structure.\n\nPowerful past influences\n\nFor Marshall, the influence of powerful figures from his own life is never far away as he helps students to kindle their own hopes. He mentioned his mother — and the steady, firm voice of encouragement she offered her students.\n\nHe noted another figure as well.\n\n“Mr. Dudley was a coach and a mentor who really inspired me to reach for higher goals,” Marshall said.\n\nWilliam Dudley coached Marshall in ninth and 10th grades in basketball, and Marshall continued to seek his counsel long after that. For Marshall, whose father died when he was a child, the presence of Dudley was deeply important to him as he grew up in Wilmington, N.C.\n\n“My father died when I was 2 years old,” he said. “My mother put three boys through school by herself.”\n\nAnd Dudley carved out time, and space, to talk with Marshall and the other students long after the school buildings had closed.\n\n“When we got older, we could drop by his house any time,” he said. “His doors would always be open to sit down and talk about anything you wanted to talk about. That takes a special person.”\n\nThose two people, Marshall said, helped to inspire his own career in education.\n\n“If you want to focus on heroes,” he said, “my two heroes were my mother and Mr. Dudley.”\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSubscribe to our Daily Headlines newsletter.\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
