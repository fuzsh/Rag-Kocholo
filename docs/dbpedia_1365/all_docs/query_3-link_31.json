        "text": "'We have a right to remain here': Journalists protested as judge cleared courtroom\n\nand\n\nMembers of the media protested in open court today when Judge Merchan took the highly unusual step of clearing journalists from the courtroom during trial proceedings.\n\n\"Your Honor, may I object on behalf of the press,\" one person in the audience said, according to the official court transcript. \"Your Honor, our lawyer is objecting, the press lawyer is objecting. We have a right to remain here.\"\n\nThe transcript includes other quotes from \"a person in the audience\" but does not specify if it was the same individual. The press was cleared by Merchan before he admonished defense witness Robert Costello for his behavior on the stand.\n\n\"This is an open courtroom,\" one person said while asking why the room was being cleared of journalists, while the attorneys and Trump’s surrogates were allowed to stay.\n\nA court officer responded by saying, \"This is not an open forum. We will answer all questions in the hallway.\"\n\nNBC News has requested comment from a court spokesperson on why Merchan cleared the court to address Costello.\n\nJudge tells Costello his ‘conduct is contemptuous’ after clearing press from courtroom\n\nJudge Merchan chastised defense witness Robert Costello and threatened to strike all of his testimony in an exchange that took place after the judge unexpectedly had reporters removed from the courtroom.\n\n\"I’m putting you on notice that your conduct is contemptuous,\" the judge told Costello, according to the court transcript released this evening. \"If you try to stare me down one more time, I will remove you from the stand.\"\n\nMerchan then told Trump's attorney Emil Bove that he would strike Costello's \"entire testimony\" if his conduct persisted.\n\n\"Listen to the question and answer the question,\" Merchan told Costello.\n\n\"Can I say something, please?\" Costello asked.\n\n\"No. No. This is not a conversation,\" the judge responded before telling the court officer to let the press back in the room.\n\nWhen will this trial be over?\n\nThe schedule has been in a bit of a tumult today. When the trial wrapped last week, Judge Merchan told the lawyers to be prepared to deliver closing arguments this Tuesday. But before testimony even resumed this morning, the end of the trial had already been delayed by another week.\n\nThat’s because it wasn’t clear whether witness testimony was going to be finished by the end of the day today and whether there would be enough time for closing arguments, jury instructions and then deliberations to begin before the long holiday weekend. So Merchan made the decision to let witness testimony conclude this week and then take off for the holiday.\n\nThen, another twist got added to the mix when the defense and prosecution argued over entering a photo from a C-SPAN video. To be able to enter the photo, the prosecution asked to bring in another witness, requesting to do so tomorrow. But Trump’s lawyers got mad, saying they had two witnesses waiting and wanted to conclude today. Eventually, they reached an agreement.\n\nSo the schedule as it is written now: Defense witness Robert Costello will be back on the stand tomorrow, and the judge and lawyers will meet Thursday to discuss jury instructions. They're taking Friday and Monday off for Memorial Day and closing arguments will be next week.\n\nTrump complains about judge admonishing defense witness\n\nTrump exited the courtroom and complained about Judge Merchan clearing the courtroom to admonish a defense witness.\n\n\"The press is not happy, I don’t imagine, they just got thrown out of a courthouse. Nobody has seen anything like it,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump also complained that he wasn't able to call an expert witness to discuss federal election law. Courts generally oppose legal witness testimony since it's the court that interprets the law in a case.\n\nCourt adjourned for the day\n\nand\n\nJudge Merchan has dismissed the court for the day and said it will reconvene tomorrow at 9:30 am ET.\n\nJudge won't rule immediately on defense's motion to dismiss\n\nand\n\nJudge Merchan said he will wait to decide on Trump lawyer Todd Blanche's motion to dismiss the case.\n\nTrump attorney argues case can't hang only on Cohen's testimony\n\nand\n\nTrump's lawyer Todd Blanche argued that the case can't be decided based only on Cohen's testimony.\n\n“There is no way the court should let this case go to the jury relying on Mr. Cohen’s testimony,\" Blanche told the judge.\n\nBlanche went on to say that Cohen has lied to the court repeatedly about his congressional testimony, and that Cohen's entire testimony in the case should not be considered because of his \"history of lying under oath.\"\n\nJudge asks if Cohen can 'fool 12 New Yorkers'\n\nReporting from Manhattan criminal courthouse\n\nAs is routine, the court is now hearing arguments from the defense that the case should be dismissed because the prosecution failed to prove a crime.\n\nJudge Merchan responded to Trump's lawyer Blanche saying that because Cohen has lied in the past, his entire testimony should be tossed out: “Do you think that he’s going to fool 12 New Yorkers?”\n\nRobert Costello calls Michael Cohen a 'drama queen'\n\nand\n\nCostello went on to describe Cohen as a \"drama queen\" while answering questions about meeting Cohen following the FBI's raid of his home, office and hotel room.\n\nCostello testified that when it happened, Cohen was \"suicidal that day and very manic.\"\n\nProsecutor Susan Hoffinger asked Costello if he thought Cohen was a drama queen for his response. Costello answered that he didn't know Cohen at that time, and thought \"he was putting on quite a show.\"\n\nDefense makes motion to dismiss\n\nThe defense has made a motion to dismiss the case — saying the prosecution has failed to prove business records were falsified.\n\nIt is common for defense teams to make a motion to dismiss after the prosecution has finished completing their case.\n\nCostello declines to call the search of Cohen's belongings a raid\n\nand\n\nRobert Costello, resisting prosecutor Susan Hoffinger, said he would not characterize the FBI search of Cohen's home, office and hotel room as a \"raid.\"\n\nInstead, Costello said it was \"an execution of a search warrant.\" That is often the same description legal experts give when describing the search for government documents at Mar-a-Lago, to Trump's dismay.\n\nCostello refuses to admit he wanted Cohen as a client\n\nand\n\nUnder cross-examination from prosecutor Susan Hoffinger, Costello was asked if he had hoped Cohen would hire him as an attorney.\n\nCostello said he met with Cohen because Jeffrey Citron scheduled a meeting. Asked if it would be a big get for his firm and a high-profile case, Costello said probably yes.\n\nHoffinger entered into evidence emails between Costello and his son in which Costello said he'll be on Cohen's team, noting that it wasn't public yet. His son wished his dad congratulations and said he hopes it leads to a lot of good things coming his way.\n\nEric Trump says judge 'won't allow' Costello to tell his story\n\nMoments after Judge Merchan cleared members of the press from the courtroom, Eric Trump tweeted that the judge “will not allow\" Robert Costello to speak freely on the witness stand.\n\n\"The judges treatment of Bob Costello is truly disgraceful - he will not allow him to tell his story - the same story he told Congress - as he knows it will be devastating and end this sham trial,\" his post read.\n\nEric Trump was one of the few people present in the courtroom who was not ushered out following Merchan's admonishment of Costello. Attorneys from both sides and Trump's surrogates remained in the courtroom while members of the press were moved into the hallway.\n\nProsecution begins cross-examining second defense witness\n\nThe defense has completed the direct examination of their second witness — after suggesting they may only have two witnesses to call.\n\nThat means the defense could be near resting their case.\n\nJudge orders press cleared from courtroom after admonishing Costello\n\nThe judge ordered the courtroom cleared of reporters after warning Robert Costello about his responses to sustained objections.\n\n\"I’d like to discuss proper decorum in my courtroom,\" Judge Juan Merchan said. \"You don't give me side eye and you don't roll your eyes.\"\n\nJudge admonishes Robert Costello\n\nand\n\nJudge Merchan asked for the jury to step out of the courtroom and admonished Robert Costello, saying that he wants to discuss proper decorum.\n\n\"If you don't like my ruling, you don't say, 'Jeez,'\" Merchan said, adding that Costello can't strike anything because the judge is the only person who can strike something.\n\n\"You don't give me side eye and you don't roll your eyes,\" Merchan said. Costello said he understands.\n\nJudge loses patience with Robert Costello's reactions to objections\n\nand\n\nTo Costello's visible annoyance, Judge Merchan has had to instruct him not to answer when an objection is sustained.\n\nEven after the warning, Costello emitted a loud \"jeez\" after another sustained objection.\n\nMerchan did not take well to that, responding, \"I'm sorry?\" A chastened Costello was silent.\n\nRobert Costello says Michael Cohen said Trump wasn't aware of Stormy Daniels payment\n\nand\n\nTrump lawyer Emil Bove said the defense wants to focus on whether Cohen said if he knew Trump was aware of the payment to Stormy Daniels.\n\nCostello said on the stand that Cohen said numerous times that Trump didn't know, that Cohen did it on his own and that Cohen repeated that numerous times.\n\nRobert Costello visibly frustrated by sustained objections to his testimony\n\nand\n\nCostello was visibly frustrated after multiple sustained objections cut off his testimony.\n\nHe muttered \"ridiculous\" to himself on the stand.\n\nRobert Costello says Michael Cohen was 'absolutely manic' when home and office were searched\n\nand\n\nRobert Costello said on the stand that he met Cohen on April 17, 2016, at the Regency Hotel in Manhattan.\n\nAsked what they discussed, Costello said that Cohen told him that his home and office had been searched and \"he was absolutely manic.\" Costello said Cohen was marching back and forth in a conference room and saying that his life was shattered.\n\nCostello said Cohen wanted him to explain his options, and Costello said he told Cohen that the type of search warrant executed was much harder to get.\n\n\"'What's my escape route?' That's the phrase he used,\" Costello said.\n\nJudge tells lawyers what Robert Costello can testify about\n\nand\n\nJudge Merchan told prosecutors that they can cross-examine Costello on two prior inconsistent statements and said he would give some latitude on the pressure campaign.\n\nBut Merchan said he will not allow this to become \"a trial within a trial\" about the pressure campaign and how it affected Cohen. He said that's not the purpose of this trial.\n\nLawyers clash over permissibility of Costello's testimony\n\nand\n\nAfter the jury was excused, the lawyers began arguing in open court about the permissibility of Costello’s testimony.\n\nProsecutor Susan Hoffinger argued that Costello’s testimony should be admissible only to address any prior inconsistent statements. Defense attorney Emil Bove said the prosecution opened the door to this evidence, and that they intend to rebut the prosecution's “pressure campaign” theory.\n\nTrump looks bemused as the defense moved to call Robert Costello\n\nand\n\nAs the defense moved to call Costello, Trump remained fixated on papers in front of him.\n\nThen, Trump put down his pen and began gazing slightly ahead with a quizzical, bemused look.\n\nDefense calls Robert Costello, a lawyer who talked with Cohen\n\nAfter the brief testimony of a paralegal for the defense, Trump's lawyers called Robert Costello.\n\nImmediately, the lawyers moved into a sidebar conversation with the judge.\n\nCostello has said he told the grand jury that Cohen told him that Trump was unaware of the payment to Stormy Daniels.\n\nProsecution secures admissions from Daniel Sitko on cross-examination\n\nand\n\nRebecca Mangold, on cross-examination, got Sitko to acknowledge that the calls were made from the law firm Davidoff Hutcher & Citron, but it is not clear who at the firm called Cohen and there is no way to know.\n\nSitko also admitted that any call to a number ending 0000 reflected a call that was not answered. Mangold also got Sitko to concede that when there were two adjacent calls from and to the law firm and then to a voicemail inbox, it was really double counting: a missed call for which the caller left a voicemail.\n\nThe point here is that Blanche’s 75 calls between Cohen and Costello were not exactly that, due to double counting, missed connections and the possibility that someone else called.\n\nDaniel Sitko's testimony aims to address the phone calls discussed\n\nand\n\nDaniel Sitko's testimony is being used to enter a chart that sums up all of the phone calls that were already admitted into evidence through prior testimony.\n\nThe chart organizes the calls as a way to make it easier for the jury to understand them, what they mean and where they fall into the case.\n\nDefense calls its first witness\n\nand\n\nDaniel Sitko, a paralegal at Blanche's firm, takes the stand. The testimony is expected to be brief, after Blanche said Sitko would be used to enter a chart about phone calls.\n\nProsecution rests\n\nReporting from Manhattan criminal courthouse\n\nThe prosecution rested their case.\n\nNext up, the defense may call witnesses.\n\nTrump lawyer is cross-examining Michael Cohen again\n\nTodd Blanche is grilling Cohen on whether he blames Trump for losing his law license.\n\nCohen says involvement with Trump 'turned my life upside down'\n\nand\n\nCohen responded to questions from the prosecution about how \"painful\" it has been as a result of speaking out against Trump. In one response, Cohen said his life \"has been turned upside down.\"\n\nAsked if he had faced \"attacks\" due to his speaking out against Trump, Cohen answered, \"Yes.\" When asked if it's been \"painful\" for him and his family, he said, \"Very much so.\"\n\n\"My life has been turned upside down,\" Cohen said, adding that he has lost his law license, business and financial security and his family’s happiness as a \"direct result\" of speaking out against the former president.\n\nCohen says 'no doubt' Trump gave him final sign-off on Daniels payment\n\nCohen said during afternoon questioning by the prosecution that he had \"no doubt\" about having a conversation with Trump in which the then-candidate gave him the OK to make the payment to Daniels.\n\nHe said there was no way he could make the payment without Trump signing off on it because he wanted to ensure he would be repaid the $130,000.\n\nTrump legal spokeswoman says Trump wants to testify but must listen to lawyers\n\nand\n\nIn an interview with Fox News outside the courthouse, Trump's legal spokeswoman Alina Habba said: \"We know he wants to testify. He is willing, he is able, he is nothing to hide at all. He’s absolutely ready to tell the truth.\"\n\nStill, she said, \"he's got to listen to his attorneys.\"\n\nInside the courtroom, Trump's attorneys have not provided a firm indication that their client intends to take the witness stand. Nothing is prohibiting the former president from testifying in his own defense, and he could start doing so as early as this afternoon.\n\nC-SPAN photo will be admitted; no need for testimony\n\nand\n\nThe C-SPAN photo purportedly showing Trump and Schiller together when Cohen called on Oct. 24, 2016, will now be admitted after an agreement was met between the prosecution, the defense and Judge Merchan.\n\nThe picture will come in by stipulation through Cohen’s testimony; it appears no additional testimony is necessary, so a C-SPAN representative will not need to appear tomorrow morning after all. The stipulation will be read into the record and will reflect that the photo comes from the end of a video taken of the campaign event.\n\nTrump team complains about delay for C-SPAN witness\n\nC-SPAN is booking travel for its witness to travel tomorrow, according to Manhattan Assistant DA Rebecca Mangold.\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche complained that this is the fifth or sixth time that there has been a delay because of the DA’s office’s running out of witnesses. Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass replied that Blanche’s portrayal of events is simply wrong and that they have stopped early once for a medical reason.\n\nIf time were of the essence, Judge Merchan said, he would agree with Blanche, but there is no prejudice to anyone given that the jury is already going to be out for almost a week.\n\nIt’s up to Blanche, Merchan says, to decide whether he wants to continue with his witnesses today or adjourn until tomorrow morning at 9:30 a.m. It also appears, based on Merchan’s statements, that he expects a charging conference tomorrow and to have a draft jury charge for the parties to review Thursday.\n\nC-SPAN representative can testify at 9:30 a.m. tomorrow\n\nand\n\nRebecca Mangold, an assistant district attorney, told the court that a representative for C-SPAN will be available to testify at 9:30 a.m. tomorrow about the authenticity of the images purportedly showing Trump and Schiller together when Cohen called on Oct. 24, 2016.\n\nDershowitz and CNN legal analyst have an audible exchange in the courtroom\n\nand\n\nAlan Dershowitz, a prominent lawyer who defended Trump during his first impeachment, and Norm Eisen, a CNN legal analyst who worked for House Democrats during Trump's first impeachment, got into a very audible back-and-forth in the courtroom just now.\n\nDershowitz could be heard saying that he was not attending the trial for political reasons. Court security gently asked Dershowitz to return to his seat.\n\nDershowitz was seated in rows reserved for Trump.\n\nDistrict attorney's office only learned of C-SPAN photos over the weekend\n\nand\n\nThe district attorney's office represents that they only learned about the C-SPAN photos over the weekend and therefore they are last-minute additions to their case against Trump.\n\nBlanche does not dispute that Schiller and Trump were together on Oct. 24, 2016, but says it is “patently unfair” to allow the prosecution to present this evidence after the defense had already put on their case.\n\nJudge Merchan raises the prospect of adjourning until 9:30 a.m. tomorrow in the event the C-SPAN witness can be present in court.\n\nMerchan won't allow prosecutors to show C-SPAN images\n\nand\n\nThe state wanted the chance to show stills from a C-SPAN video that purportedly shows that Trump and Schiller were together when Cohen called on Oct. 24, 2016. Merchan denied that request, however, sustaining the defense team's objection and ruling that \"those videos cannot come in.\"\n\nTrump's lawyer says defense has two witnesses waiting\n\nReporting from Manhattan criminal court\n\nIn the back-and-forth between lawyers, Trump's lawyer Blanche said the defense has two witnesses waiting to testify.\n\nTrial takes lunch break\n\nReporting from the Manhattan criminal court\n\nThe trial has taken a break for lunch.\n\nProsecutor says DA's office has photo of Keith Schiller and Trump from 2016\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nWith the jury excused for lunch, prosecutor Joshua Steinglass and Trump lawyer Todd Blanche are arguing about whether the jury should see a photograph of Keith Schiller and Trump taken on Oct. 24, 2016, at 7:57 p.m., which is a still from a C-SPAN video.\n\nBlanche is extremely animated in arguing that the admission of the photograph would be hearsay, especially since the only relevance is the date and time. That makes it an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted, Blanche insists.\n\nSteinglass noted that the C-SPAN witness testified to their method of capturing events. To the extent that Blanche is arguing the photo is not relevant, the photo shows Trump and Schiller walking off the stage together at 7:57 pm, raising the prospect that, as Cohen testified, he could easily have spoken to both of them.\n\nBlanche denies disclaiming that Trump and Schiller were together that night.\n\nCohen testifies about using AI program to create cases\n\nand\n\nHoffinger asked Cohen about an episode when he used an artificial intelligence program to fake cases that his attorney included in a filing requesting early termination of his supervised release.\n\nCohen, for the second time in his testimony, explained that he went on the AI platform Google Bard to research relevant cases. The platform gave him cases that appeared to be legitimate, so he sent them along to his lawyer to work into the filing.\n\n\"I ultimately sent it to my current lawyer and she noticed that these cases were not legit, they were create by an AI program, which wants to please the user,\" Cohen said in part. \"It created these hypotheticals, and she immediately notified me they were wrong and we should notify the court, to which I said to her: Absolutely, please do.\"\n\nBlanche, for his part, appeared incredulous as Cohen presented this episode as an inadvertent error. He looked at Cohen's current attorney, who is seated in the front row, and shook his head. Blanche had attempted to use the episode to show that Cohen was still lying.\n\n(Including fake cases in a legal filing would be grounds for sanctions.)\n\nCohen says he never considered having Robert Costello as his attorney\n\nand\n\nThe defense appeared to be trying to make a point by pressing Cohen to testify that he never signed a retainer agreement with Robert Costello but did speak at length with him. Those conversations would still have attorney-client privilege even though Cohen never hired him.\n\nProsecutor Susan Hoffinger is now asking Cohen about his waiver agreement with SDNY through which he waived any privilege with Costello.\n\nIn that waiver agreement, which Cohen signed in 2019, Cohen says “Costello sought to represent me in connection with the SDNY Investigation and presented me with a retainer agreement.\"\n\n\"I declined to sign the retainer agreement and informed him that I was already represented. . . . [A]t no time did I sign a retainer or otherwise agree to retain Costello, nor did I ever consider Costello … to be my attorney,\" Cohen continued.\n\nCohen says he pled guilty to campaign finance violation in connection with Stormy Daniels payment\n\nand\n\nProsecutor Susan Hoffinger asked Cohen if the NDA with Stormy Daniels was legal and Cohen said it wasn't — undoing a point that Blanche had tried to hammer.\n\nAsked if he pleaded guilty to a campaign finance violation in connection with paying off Stormy Daniels, Cohen said he did.\n\nThis is a point that the prosecution is like to also keep trying to hammer, pointing to that guilty plea as the underlying crime they say Trump was trying to hide when the business records were changed.\n\nTrump lawyer did not question Cohen about 2017 Oval Office meeting, a key element in prosecution's case\n\nReporting from the Manhattan courtroom\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche finished questioning Cohen without asking about a meeting Cohen said happened in the Oval Office in early 2017.\n\nCohen said it was in this meeting that the reimbursement plan was confirmed — a key point for the state's case as it reaffirms the former president's knowledge of a scheme prosecutors say established the cover-up.\n\nCohen explains what Red Finch did for Trump\n\nand\n\nIn response to prosecutor Susan Hoffinger asking Cohen what Red Finch did for Trump, Cohen said the technology company was asked to assist in a CNBC poll about the most famous businessmen in the last century.\n\nCohen said Trump’s name was on that list but was at the bottom, which upset him. Cohen said he reached out to Red Finch, which assured him that they were able, through various IP addresses, to make Trump rise in the poll.\n\nCohen testified that he told Trump, and that they spoke about what number he should be, so as long as he was in the top 10 he would go to the next round of the poll. Cohen said he advised the CEO of Red Finch to start acquiring IP addresses, and purchased more and more.\n\nUltimately, when the poll came to its conclusion, Cohen said Trump was No. 9 on the list.\n\nTrump allies speak as protesters scream over them outside courthouse\n\nA group of Trump surrogates spoke outside the courthouse while protesters screamed, drowning out certain allies' statements by yelling out words like \"liar\" and \"traitor\" and booing loudly.\n\nSouth Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson was the first to speak, telling the crowd that he was there because he chose to be, because \"prosecution matters.\"\n\n\"I wanted this country to understand that prosecutors around the country are calling the sham trial exactly what it is: a sham trial,\" Wilson said.\n\n\"When I was the prosecutor in South Carolina, I was taught that a real prosecutor doesn't prosecute people. They prosecute conduct. What we're seeing today is the prosecution of a person because of who he is,\" the attorney general continued.\n\nKash Patel, a former U.S. National Security Council official, spoke next, saying that the real criminal is Cohen and Trump is merely a victim.\n\n\"I am honored to be here in support of Donald Trump. He has been victimized, we as a country are being victimized, by the unconstitutional weaponization of justice,\" Patel said.\n\nSeveral other Trump allies, including Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., and state representatives from New York, Missouri and Georgia, also shared comments in support of Trump as the protestors' screams grew louder, calling out, \"We don't care what you have to say!\"\n\nProsecution attempts to restore Cohen's credibility at the start of redirect\n\nand\n\nThe prosecution’s redirect begins by attempting to restore Cohen’s credibility on the 2016 call he had with Trump and his ability to negotiate the hush money payment with Stormy Daniels.\n\n“Were you too busy in October 2016 to get Trump’s approval on the Stormy Daniels payment?” prosecutor Susan Hoffinger asks.\n\n“No, ma’am,” Cohen replies.\n\nCohen now under redirect examination\n\nSusan Hoffinger, one of the prosecutors, has started her redirect examination of Cohen.\n\nBlanche is done questioning Cohen\n\n\"I have no further questions,\" Blanche told Merchan.\n\nCohen says he has a financial interest in the case's outcome\n\nand\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche asked Cohen, \"Do you have a financial interest in the outcome of this case?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Cohen said.\n\nAsked again if Cohen will benefit financially from a conviction, Cohen said no, it's better if Trump is not found guilty because it \"gives me more to talk about in the future.\"\n\nCohen says he's considering writing a third book, running for Congress\n\nand\n\nCohen, responding to questions from Blanche, confirmed that he's thinking about writing a third book and launching a congressional bid.\n\nIn addressing Blanche's questions, Cohen said his name recognition would help in a hypothetical run for Congress. He pushed back on the suggestion that he would simply be coasting off his links to the former president, saying in part: \"My name recognition is because of the journey I have been on and it is associated with Trump.\"\n\nBlanche replied: \"Your journey has included daily attacks on Trump?\"\n\nCohen's answer: \"My journey is to tell my story.\"\n\nAlan Dershowitz and Bernie Kerik attend today's court session\n\nLaw professor Alan Dershowitz, center left, and Bernard Kerik, a former New York city police commissioner, listen to Trump outside the courtroom today.\n\nTrump does not have to show up for Wednesday hearing in classified documents case, judge says\n\nU.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who is presiding over Trump’s classified documents case in Florida, has granted his request to not be required to attend a hearing in Florida on Wednesday.\n\nCannon said counsel for Trump must attend, but Trump himself does not.\n\nCannon this month indefinitely delayed the trial because of multiple pretrial issues that have yet to be resolved.\n\nTrump lawyer presses Cohen on income and where it came from\n\nand\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche asked Cohen a series of questions about how much he made in certain years and where it came from.\n\nAsked how much he made in 2017, besides what Trump paid him, Cohen said about $4 million from consulting. He confirmed that he made another $420,000 from Trump.\n\nAsked how much money he made in 2018, Cohen said about $4 million from the 2017 to 2018 period.\n\nCohen said that he's made about $4 million annually from books and podcasts, including $3.4 million from two books he wrote. He said he's not making a significant amount of money off of TikTok, and while he's not pitching a TV show about himself, someone else is exploring the idea.\n\nCohen says Trump Organization wasn't paying invoices from his lawyers\n\nCohen acknowledged he was still talking to Costello by June 23, 2018, and expressed a concern over “nonpayment” to his lawyers at McDermott Will & Emery, which had sent “significant invoices” to the Trump Organization but which were “not being paid in accordance with the invoices.”\n\nCohen says he expressed to Costello that the nonpayment was becoming an issue and asked that Costello have Giuliani pass that on to Trump. (In this line of questioning, Blanche is inadvertently calling attention to Trump's history of not paying people such as building contractors.)\n\nWhat to know about Cohen friend Steve Croman\n\nand\n\nBlanche is asking Cohen about his conversations with multiple people cited in a 2018 Wall Street Journal article, including his family, New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman and his college friend Steve Croman.\n\nCroman is a real estate landlord who has drawn harsh criticism for his alleged treatment of tenants. Earlier this year, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced that the state had reached a $514,000 settlement with Croman for allegedly defrauding renters.\n\nBlanche trying to emphasize Cohen's history of denials\n\nand\n\nBlanche is asking Cohen about his conversations with multiple people after the Wall Street Journal article came out in 2018, including his family, New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman and his college friend, Steve Croman, as Croman was serving jail time.\n\nCohen told all of these people, at the time, that Trump knew nothing about the payment, and in some cases, even recorded himself talking to various reporters.\n\nWith his cross-examination this morning, Blanche is using Cohen's repeated denials to create doubt about the veracity of Cohen's testimony now.\n\nMan who wanted to hire Cohen for work was later prosecuted by DOJ\n\nReporting from Manhattan criminal court\n\nCohen testified that a man named Imaad Zuberi wanted to hire him and he declined. Zuberi was later prosecuted by the Justice Department for lobbying and campaign finance-related crimes.\n\nBlanche suggests Trump was annoyed over Cohen's consulting gigs\n\nand\n\nBlanche is grilling Cohen over a string of consulting contracts he signed in 2017, including one with the telecoms giant AT&T. Cohen confirmed that Trump introduced him to the then-CEO of AT&T, but he conceded he never told the former president about these clients.\n\nCohen testified that, at some point, Trump asked about his fixer's consulting work. \"He was frustrated you signed a deal with AT&T?\" Blanche said.\n\nThe prosecution objected to the question. The judge sustained the objection.\n\nJurors are holding their heads in their hands\n\nReporting from inside the courtroom\n\nThe jury is having a tough time; jurors are rubbing their eyes, holding their head in hands and shifting in seats.\n\nCohen admits he did legal work with Mark Kasowitz, DA will have to address Cohen's hours of legal work for Trump\n\nand\n\nCohen admitted that among the legal work he did in 2017 as personal attorney to Trump, he served as co-lead counsel with Mark Kasowitz in a litigation. That data point could elevate Cohen as a lawyer in jurors’ minds.\n\nCohen also previously testified that he spent fewer than 10 hours total in 2017 doing legal work for Trump. His active assistance with legal matters — including helping with serving subpoenas on the State Department — seems to contradict that testimony and is an area for potential clean-up by the DA’s office when prosecutor Susan Hoffinger is up again on redirect.\n\nBlanche scores key concession from Cohen\n\nReporting from Manhattan criminal court\n\nBlanche elicits an admission from Cohen that while Trump’s job changed, his didn’t.\n\nThis was a good moment for the defense. Blanche will use this to back up a key defense theme: that Cohen did, in fact, function as Trump’s personal lawyer and was paid as such despite their never executing a retainer agreement, as had been the case historically.\n\nTrump's eyes are closed, but his surrogates are watching closely\n\nand\n\nWhile Trump is at the defense table, his eyes are closed for the most part and his chin is jutting toward Cohen.\n\nTrump's surrogates, which today includes several members of Congress and a state attorney general, are upright and watching the proceedings closely.\n\nLaw professor Alan Dershowitz is also in the courtroom, and can be seen resting his hand by his face while watching Blanche press Cohen on his specific recollection of events during the days after the release of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, how he was repaid by Trump for the payment to Daniels, and his acknowledgement that he stole from the Trump Organization.\n\nTrump’s senior aides, seating by his allies in the gallery, glance up from their cellphones on occasion.\n\nTrump lawyer's 'gotcha' moment on Cohen appears to fall short\n\nand\n\nTrump lawyer Blanche showed Cohen an email from former Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg to Cohen in January 2017, around the time of Cohen’s admitted last day at the company. The email itself says: “Thank you. You never stopped on for a bro hug. Anyway please prepare the agreement we discussed so we can pay you monthly.”\n\nIn this exchange, Blanche is reminding Cohen that he previously testified that he and Weisselberg had an agreement there would never be any retainer agreement. Blanche seems to think this is a big “gotcha” moment, but it does not quite go over that way, at least in the overflow room.\n\nCohen acknowledges he stole from the Trump Organization\n\nand\n\nTrump lawyer Blanche pressed Cohen about the money paid to RedFinch not adding up to the total that the Trump Org. gave him to make the payment.\n\nBlanche said to Cohen that he gave Red Finch $20,000 and he took $30,000. \"You stole from the Trump Organization, right?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Cohen testified, adding that he never paid the amount that he owed. He added that he discussed this with both federal and state prosecutors.\n\nCohen had previously testified that he received some immunity by testifying before the grand jury.\n\nCohen testifies about giving cash in brown paper bag to tech firm owner\n\nand\n\nBlanche pressed Cohen on the $20,000 he paid to the owner of RedFinch, a tech company that had done work for Trump. Blanche asked Cohen how he paid the firm, and the ex-fixer replied: \"I went to TD Bank and took out cash over a couple of days, I just didn't want to take out $20,000.\"\n\nCohen could not recall the exact increments for the cash withdrawal. Blanche asked Cohen whether he had a \"duffel bag of cash\" for the RedFinch owner, and Cohen said no, it was \"a brown paper bag.\"\n\n\"He came to the office and I gave him the cash,\" Cohen said.\n\nBlanche gets animated as he presses Cohen\n\nReporting from Manhattan criminal court\n\nBlanche is quite worked up, suggesting that he thinks he is about to disprove that Cohen’s retainer was always a fiction.\n\nBlanche asks Cohen about communications with reps for MLK relative\n\nCohen is being asked about pastor Darrell Scott, a Black community leader who continues to be an adviser to Trump.\n\nCohen separately acknowledged that on Oct. 26, 2016, he spoke multiple times with representatives for a relative of Martin Luther King Jr. who endorsed Trump.\n\nAll that was happening the week that Cohen was negotiating and finalizing the Stormy Daniels settlement.\n\nPortions of testimony seem disjointed, but lawyers need them for closing arguments\n\nThere have been portions of testimony elicited by both the prosecution and the defense in this trial that feel disjointed and out of place at the time, but the lawyers need to get them into evidence to use during closing arguments.\n\nThe hope is that it all comes together in the end, but in the meantime, the jury is left to sit and wonder.\n\nThe jury seems to be less engaged\n\nand\n\nSo far Cohen has been looking directly at Trump's lawyer, Todd Blanche, while testifying, not the jury.\n\nSeveral of the jurors appear to be looking around the audience and watching the door to the courtroom as several people cycle in and out — appearing less than engaged in this stretch of the cross-examination.\n\nThe difficulty this morning will be that while these proceedings are important for the jury to understand due to the complex nature of this case, the line of questioning is at times very hard to follow.\n\nTrump lawyer seeks to imply Cohen lied after preparations with Dan Goldman\n\nand\n\nPressed by Trump lawyer Todd Blanche, Cohen acknowledged that he met with Rep. Dan Goldman, D-N.Y., in 2019, when Goldman was a congressional aide, to prepare for prior congressional testimony.\n\nCohen also admitted to lying during that testimony.\n\nThe implication is that even when prepped by a federal prosecutor-turned-congressman, Cohen lies.\n\nAre we going to see more Blanche-on-Cohen fireworks today?\n\nBlanche’s questioning of Cohen reached a crescendo last week as the defense lawyer forcefully grilled the ex-fixer about his history of false statements and other contested issues. It’ll be interesting to see whether Blanche can build back to that level of intensity today.\n\nCohen confirms he spoke to the press last week, but not about the trial\n\nand\n\nCohen acknowledged speaking to reporters after Thursday’s court day ended, but says it was not about the case.\n\nThis year alone, Cohen says it’s possible he met with prosecutors more than 20 times, and closer to 20 than 12.\n\nMichael Cohen is back on the stand\n\nand\n\nTrump's former fixer is expected to face more cross-examination from Trump defense attorney Todd Blanche.\n\nWe're on Day 4 of Cohen's testimony.\n\nWhy are we talking about election law?\n\nand\n\nSome of you reading this might be wondering, “Why are we having this extensive conversation about an election law expert’s testimony?”\n\nIt’s because a felony falsification of business record charge requires not only that the prosecution prove Trump had an intent to defraud (through the false business records), but also had an intent to commit or conceal another crime, whether or not that crime is completed or even committed by him.\n\nPrior to trial, Judge Merchan found that the District Attorney's office had alleged three underlying crimes that could be a part of their case at trial: violations of federal campaign finance law, state election law or state tax law.\n\nAt trial, however, the prosecution has made clear that their primary theory of the case is based on Trump’s intent to conceal his violation of New York Election Law 17-152, which prohibits conspiracies to promote the election of a particular person through “unlawful means” and where at least one act is taken toward that goal.\n\nHere, the prosecution seems to be arguing that Trump, Pecker, Cohen et al. conspired to promote Trump’s election through the two unlawful campaign contributions that Cohen and AMI made. In other words, the unlawful means were campaign contributions in violation of federal law.\n\nJudge nods at question of underlying crime\n\nLots of legal analysts and political pundits (who may or may not know much about the law) have opined about the prosecution's decision to charge Trump with a felony by relying on a part of the law that says documents were altered to cover up another crime.\n\nCritics have said that the prosecution failed to show exactly what the underlying crime was. Prosecutors have alluded to two crimes that they could invoke, one being federal election law (that Cohen pleaded guilty to violating for the hush money payments) and the other being a New York state law.\n\nCritics have said that New York prosecutors shouldn't be able to use federal law violations to prove another crime. And others have said that without even charging a New York state law violation, they have failed on that front.\n\nBut Merchan just made clear that it's not that cut and dry.\n\nMerchan said that prosecutors aren't required to prove the underlying crime beyond a reasonable doubt — which could be a key distinction when he writes the jury instructions.\n\n'Just relax': Judge appears to chastise Trump lawyer\n\nand\n\nMerchan was in the process of explaining his ruling on a particular piece of expert witness testimony when Trump lawyer Emil Bove tried to interject. Merchan quickly admonished Bove.\n\n\"Just relax,\" Merchan told Bove.\n\nJudge discusses defense's application for testimony from a supposed expert on campaign finance\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nJudge Merchan said there was an application last week seeking testimony from Brad Smith, who the defense wanted to interpret certain phrases and definitions pertinent to federal election law.\n\nThey wanted him to opine on federal regulations, agency advisory opinions and decisions, and Supreme Court precedent.\n\nMerchan had signaled last week that legal analysis and interpretation are usually off limits for an expert. Here, Merchan noted that if Smith is only going to testify to very basic legal concepts and frameworks, it is hard to see why he needs to rely on such materials.\n\nOne option, Merchan, noted would be to allow the prosecution to have its own expert on campaign finance law, which would provoke a battle of the experts.\n\nMerchan said, however, that for similar reasons, Smith’s testimony was precluded by two federal courts, including Judge Lew Kaplan (the E. Jean Carroll judge) in the Sam Bankman-Fried matter.\n\nUltimately, Merchan said the best way forward is for both sides to submit proposed jury instructions. But Smith can discuss the function and role of the FEC and can explain general terms that have an official definition, such as expenditure or independent expenditure.\n\nMerchan and lawyers discuss evidence defense wants to use in its cross examination of Cohen\n\nand\n\nMerchan, Trump lawyer Todd Blanche and prosecutor Susan Hoffinger are working through evidence that the defense wants to use today to cross-examine Michael Cohen and are going over whether the prosecution would have grounds for an objection.\n\nThe discussion is happening before jurors enter the courtroom. Merchan has consistently required that the lawyers not argue their objections before the jury, a move that keeps them from potentially hearing things that are allowed.\n\nMerchan says summations set for after Memorial Day\n\nand\n\nUpon taking the stand, Merchan said it has “become apparent that we are not going to sum up tomorrow.”\n\nClosing arguments will instead happen the Tuesday after Memorial Day, or May 28, Merchan said, to ensure there are not multiple days between summations and deliberations.\n\nTrump maintains prosecutors have 'no case and they have no crime'\n\nBefore entering the courtroom, Trump complained that the trial is holding him back from campaigning, saying that sitting in a “very freezing cold courtroom” for the hush money trial for the last four weeks is “very unfair.”\n\n“They have no case and they have no crime,” he said.\n\nTrump then read aloud a series of quotes from legal experts who support his claims that the trial is a “witch hunt” and an attempt at election interference amid his presidential campaign.\n\nThe presumptive Republican presidential nominee also repeated accusations without evidence that Judge Juan Merchan is “totally conflicted” and that the Biden administration is behind his legal troubles in an effort to attack the president's political opponent.\n\nCourt begins for the day\n\nReporting from Manhattan criminal court\n\nThe court has begun for the day.\n\nHere's what you missed Thursday\n\nThe defense drew closer to the end of its cross-examination Michael Cohen, Trump’s former lawyer and fixer, on Day 18 of the former president’s hush money trial in New York City.\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche repeatedly asked Cohen about a 2016 phone call he had with Trump about the $130,000 hush money payment to adult film actor Stormy Daniels that Cohen had set up.\n\nBlanche also sought to discredit Cohen when pressing him about what had happened around the time of his 2018 guilty plea on federal charges in connection to the payment to Daniels.\n\nA group of Trump’s congressional allies also attended the trial expressing their solidarity and loyalty to the former president during the hush money trial, which they slammed as an election interference effort amid Trump’s required court attendance during his presidential campaign.\n\nAfter seeking clarity from the defense and the prosecution about the timing of witness testimony before proceeding with closing arguments, Merchan told lawyers on both sides to be prepared to begin them on Tuesday.\n\nTrump’s hush money trial makes big money for professional line-standers\n\nSome moms get flowers for Mother’s Day; Paige Singh got to see Donald Trump on trial.\n\nThe Bay Area mom, in town from California to accompany her husband on business, snagged a spot on Tuesday for what has quickly become one of the hottest tickets in New York City, thanks to her husband and the professional line-stander he hired as a Mother’s Day gift to hold a spot for her in the queue outside the courthouse.\n\n“My husband? He thinks it’s crazy,” she said. And her kids “just laugh.”\n\nBut for Singh, the hundreds of dollars she sent via Zelle to a stranger holding her place outside the Manhattan criminal courthouse was well worth the chance to see the former president of the United States on trial.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nHere's who's joining Trump in court today\n\nand\n\nTrump just arrived at the courthouse. He will be joined today by a number of allies:\n\nSouth Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson\n\nRep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo.\n\nRep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ohio.\n\nRep. Mary Miller, R-Ill.\n\nRep. Keith Self, R-Texas.\n\nJohn Coale of the America First Policy Institute, senior adviser for Center for Litigation\n\nAlan Dershowitz\n\nWill Scharf, Missouri attorney general candidate\n\nSteve Witkoff, NYC real estate exec; friend of Trump's since 1986; testified in civil fraud trial as an “expert\"\n\nBernie Kerik, former NYC police commissioner; Trump ally; advised Rudy Giuliani after the 2020 election\n\nKash Patel, Trump ally; was elevated to chief of staff to Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller in Nov. 2020 after the election following Trump’s firing of Defense Secretary Mark Esper\n\nVernon Jones, former Georgia state legislator; Trump ally; tried to run for governor of Georgia and then for Congress\n\nJerry Kassar, chair of the New York State Conservative Party\n\nChuck Zito, actor; former president of the NY chapter of the Hells Angels\n\nCourt is beginning earlier than usual\n\nJudge Juan Merchan is ordering everyone to be in their seats by 8:45 A.M.\n\nWhat to expect today in the Trump trial: Michael Cohen back on the stand\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nMichael Cohen will take the stand today for his third day of cross examination by Trump's attorneys. It could be the final day of testimony in Trump's first criminal trial.\n\nJust as it did last Thursday, Todd Blanche's cross-examination of Cohen could get tense. At one point, Blanche, Trump's attorney, even barked, \"That's a lie!\" at Cohen, the prosecution's star witness.\n\nOne question still looming over the proceedings is whether Trump will take the stand in his own defense. On Thursday, the most recent trial day, Blanche told the judge that he didn't yet know whether Trump would take the stand."
