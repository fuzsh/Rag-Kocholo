        "text": "BUFFALO - A driver's license examiner convicted of helping illegal aliens obtain fake licenses will spend a year in the county jail.\n\nJohn Douthitt, Harper County associate district judge, sentenced Fred Matlack on Monday to seven years in jail with all but 365 days suspended.\n\nAs part of his sentence, Matlack also will forfeit $6,400 found in his pocket when he was arrested in Woodward in August.\n\nIn November, Matlack pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit a felony in knowingly making false statements in an application for an Oklahoma driver's license.\n\nThe affidavit states that he accepted money for documents that Guatemalan nationals used to obtain driver's licenses. Matlack met several Guatemalan men in August in front of the Laverne City Hall and gave them forms to take to a tag agency to obtain licenses. None took a written or driving test, the document states.\n\nThe suspected middle man, Jorge Alejo Jaime-Ruiz, told officers he paid Matlack $300 for each form. The group then went to the Shattuck Tag Agency, where four men obtained driver's licenses with false names, the affidavit states. Information supplied to the tag agent indicated the Guatemalans were born in Puerto Rico.\n\nMatlack is no longer employed by the Oklahoma Highway Patrol, and investigators are reviewing his cases.\n\nArchive ID: 1018448"
