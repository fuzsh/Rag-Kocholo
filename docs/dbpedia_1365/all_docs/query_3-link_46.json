        "text": "CLIFTON PARK — Susan Laverne, one of three people charged in a $2.3 million mortgage fraud scheme last week, is also facing charges in Albany County Court that she pocketed money designated to pay off people’s mortgages. Laverne allegedly ran a settlement company, but rather than ensure that all interested parties were paid correctly as those companies generally do, she allegedly kept the money collected for herself. “She acted as the settlement company for a couple of closings and then the checks were not given to the right people,” Chris Baynes, the Albany County assistant district attorney handling the case, said. Laverne is in Albany County Jail facing charges of second- and third-degree grand larceny and criminal possession of a forged instrument. She has been held since July 26 in lieu of $50,000 bail. Baynes said the alleged fraudulent transactions occurred between July and November 2008 and involved more than $330,000. He said the investigation into Laverne’s activities is ongoing, and added that she will likely be arraigned on charges related to another scheme in Saratoga County Court next Tuesday. In that case she is accused of also acting as a settlement agency and, with Saratoga Springs couple Stephen and Nikole Sutliff, pocketing the proceeds of fraudulent closings on several properties bought in the city. The Sutliffs were arraigned Sept. 3; Laverne’s arraignment was adjourned until next Tuesday at her lawyer’s request."
