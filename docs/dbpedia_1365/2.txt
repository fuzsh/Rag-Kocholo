Before you start controlling Laverne, switch to Bernard and go into the Main Lobby. Go through the door into the convention room and Open the Grating. Go to the Chattering Teeth and follow them to trap it in the grating and then Pick them up. Go through the Swinging door into the Break area and pick up the Fork, Coffee, and Decaf. Head into the door to the right and get the Funnel from the Cabinet.

Head back into the lobby and up the stairs. Open the first door where the fat guy is sleeping. Close the door and get the Keys from the lock and leave. Go past the second door and enter the Third door to see Green Tentacle. Push the Speaker down and then grab the Videotape and use the On/Off switch to see something fall off of the ceiling in the Main lobby. Go upstairs and to the right to see Edison’s son and Pick Up the Hamster. Go out and upstairs, into the next room and then outside. Get the Crank from the Crankbox and go down the chimney.

Pick up the Fake Barf on the ground in the lobby and go see Dr. Fred in his laboratory. He’ll talk about a contract he signed, so Use Decaf Coffee on his Coffee Mug to make him start sleep walking. Go upstairs into Edna’s surveillance room which is across from Weird Ed’s room. You can’t get rid of Edna now, so you’ll need to switch to Hoagie. Go to the room across from where the Horse is where Ned and Jed are sculpting. Switch the Right Handed Hammer with the Left Handed Hammer. The statue in the present is now altered so you can now push Edna out of the room.

Put the Videotape in the VCR and then Use the VCR. Press the Square button on the VCR to Record. Then it’ll show IRS agents come and take Fred away. Rewind the footage and switch the footage to EP on the far right. Play the footage and you’ll see the combination. Go down into Fred’s office in the lobby. Grab the Booboo-B-Gone from the desk drawer and the Swiss Bank Account from the Desk. Open the safe and grab the contract.
