MANSFIELD – Thomas Slayton, a distinguished artist and versatile creative, is set to unveil his latest art exhibition, “The Accused,” on Aug. 6.

This compelling showcase will be held at the Phoenix Brewing Company and will run through Sept. 23, 2024.

“The Accused” features a striking collection of portraiture inspired by mug shots, offering a raw and authentic glimpse into the human condition.

Each piece captures genuine expression and emotion, reflecting the artist’s fascination with the unfiltered human experience.

The exhibition explores the contrast between the polished, idealized images prevalent in modern media and the unvarnished reality depicted in mug shots.

Thomas Slayton, a graduate of the Art Institute of Pittsburgh, has built a diverse career spanning advertising and marketing including owning an advertising agency while maintaining his love for art.

Slayton’s creative journey is always continuing, working as a Marketing Manager for a company specializing in speech-generating devices, and engaging in various freelance assignments.

Beyond his professional endeavors, Slayton is dedicated to honing his craft through drawing, painting, and woodworking. And Tom can usually be spotted in the wild, sketching at his favorite local coffee shop or brewery.

Slayton’s artist statement reveals the core of his inspiration.

“In a world of cell devices and social media, with selfies and filters, people seem to be taking away from the human aesthetic itself with unrealistic images and almost bizarre fake ideals,” Slayton said.

“Mug shots are images of people usually at their worst, some accused of doing unspeakable things but then always captured with a truly genuine image in their appearance, however bad or good it may be.

“That is the thing that fascinates me as an artist, capturing the most real and genuine expression with true emotion and therefore, the sublime challenge of making great portraiture.

“‘The Accused’ are drawn with the famous blue pens ‘borrowed’ from a local banking chain in Mansfield and rendered on premium bond printer paper, rescued from a dumpster.”

The exhibition promises an engaging and thought-provoking experience, blending the gritty realism of mug shots with artistic expression and caricature.

The Phoenix Brewing Company will provide the perfect backdrop for this exploration of human vulnerability and authenticity.
