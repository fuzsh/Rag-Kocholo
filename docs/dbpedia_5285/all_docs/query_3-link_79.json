It really didn’t go unseen.\n\n“It was a decision which wasn’t made lightly, as I’ve created memories that will live with me forever.\n\n“You accepted me from game one and all the way through to the end of last season, I truly mean it when I say you hold a special place in my heart.”\n\nEvans, who scored an FA Cup goal against eventual winners Manchester United last January, thanked his former teammates for helping to create “some of the greatest moments” of his life.\n\nHe said: “I genuinely couldn’t have done it without you. I have met people within the club who I’ll class as friends for life.\n\n“The club gave me an opportunity two years ago and I can easily say it’s been the best two years. For now it’s time to say goodbye, to undertake a new challenge, one that I personally couldn’t turn down.\n\n“I gave everything for Newport County and I hope you felt I did as well.\n\n“I wish nothing but success for the club in the upcoming season and the forthcoming years.”\n\nNewport kick off their League Two campaign away to Cheltenham Town on Saturday."
