        "text": "About me\n\nTom was first exposed to chiropractic by accident, after he sustained a rib injury playing county rugby for his native Cambridgeshire: a short course of treatment from a friend's father, who happened to be a chiropractor, saw him soon back to health and returned to the pitch.\n\nGiven his strong family connections to South Wales and the Welsh Valleys, Tom chose to study at the Welsh Institute of Chiropractic. Its proximity to the Brecon Beacons and stunning Gower Peninsula were – for this keen outdoor sportsman – a deal maker, and he graduated with a Masters degree in Chiropractic (MChiro).\n\nSetting up his own clinic has always been the goal. Tom wanted to be able to provide Chiropractic care in a relaxed and friendly manner, Hoxton Square in Shoreditch presented as the perfect location for this approach.\n\nAreas of interest\n\nTom’s clinical approach is a diversified 'evidence based' technique integrating established principles in human health science: where appropriate he uses sacro-occipital technique (SOT), activator method and Derrifield technique to assist in fully understanding, diagnosing and treating your condition.\n\nUltimately his aim is to understand the root cause of symptoms so as to reduce or lessen the recurrence of any issues in future.\n\nTom is experienced dealing with most Orthopaedic conditions and is able to assist all age groups. My special interest is Sports Chiropractic (mainly Snow Sports, Rowing, and On/Off-Road Cycling). I have undertaken further training to work towards ICCPS and FICS accreditation.\n\nMedical secretaries"
