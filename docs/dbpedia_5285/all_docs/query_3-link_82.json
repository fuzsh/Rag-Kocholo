        "text": "SAINT-DENIS, France – The first American woman to medal in the triple jump has moved on to the next chapter of another historic quest.\n\nJasmine Moore of Mansfield/Grand Prairie/Gainesville qualified Tuesday for the finals in the long jump Thursday at Stade de France with a leap of 6.66 on her second attempt. It was the fourth-best distance in Group A, and the sixth-best overall of those who participated.\n\nRelated:Grand Prairie’s Jasmine Moore qualifies for long jump finals, has chance at second medal\n\nTara Davis-Woodhall, who competed at Texas and lives in Northwest Arkansas, was first in qualifying at 6.90.\n\nTurns out making history is tougher than you might think. The day after winning the bronze medal in the triple jump was “tough,” Moore said, but watching the U.S.’ Noah Lyles win an epic men’s 100 meters motivated her to medal again.\n\nUntil then, Moore said, winning bronze took a little pressure off her to medal in the long jump.\n\n“But since I’ve gotten to experience it how much fun it was,” she said, “I’m, like, hungry for it again.\n\n“I still just cannot believe it. It makes me even more excited for the finals.”\n\nRelated:Jasmine Moore almost skipped triple jump, but overcame doubts to win Olympic medal\n\nMoore said she might have a little bit of an advantage over some of the other long jumpers because her experience in the triple jump gave her a head start training on the stadium’s runway.\n\nAsked if the long jumpers consider her a unicorn because of her unique status as a two-jump finalist, she said she isn’t well-acquainted enough with her peers to know. She’s only in her first season as a pro out of the University of Florida. But her name’s getting around almost as fast as she is."
