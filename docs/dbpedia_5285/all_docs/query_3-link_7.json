        "text": "Mansfield History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nIreland\n\nThe name Mansfield arrived in England after the Norman Conquest of 1066. The Mansfield family lived in Mansfield, a parish in Nottinghamshire. The place-name itself is a combination of Celtic and Anglo-Saxon terms, and literally signifies the field by the hill called Mam, from the Celtic word for a mother or a breast.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Mansfield family\n\nThe surname Mansfield was first found in Nottinghamshire at Mansfield, a market town that dates back to the Domesday Book of 1086 where it was listed as Mamesfelde. 1 The place name literally means \"open land by the River Maun,\" from the Celtic river name + the Old English word \"feld.\" 2 Looking back further, the area is known to date back to Roman times, with a villa discovered in 1787 by a Major Rooke and a cache of denarii coins found near King's Mill in 1849. Some claim the early English royalty were said to have stayed in the area, with the Mercian Kings using it as a base for hunting in the nearby Sherwood Forest.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Mansfield family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Mansfield research. Another 106 words (8 lines of text) covering the years 1066, 1659 and 1666 are included under the topic Early Mansfield History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nMansfield Spelling Variations\n\nA multitude of spelling variations characterize Norman surnames. Many variations occurred because Old and Middle English lacked any definite spelling rules. The introduction of Norman French to England also had a pronounced effect, as did the court languages of Latin and French. Therefore, one person was often referred to by several different spellings in a single lifetime. The various spellings include Mansfield, Manfield, Mansfeild and others.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Mansfield family\n\nMore information is included under the topic Early Mansfield Notables in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nMansfield World Ranking\n\nIn the United States, the name Mansfield is the 1,588th most popular surname with an estimated 19,896 people with that name. 3 However, in Newfoundland, Canada, the name Mansfield is ranked the 738th most popular surname with an estimated 58 people with that name. 4 And in Australia, the name Mansfield is the 965th popular surname with an estimated 4,111 people with that name. 5 The United Kingdom ranks Mansfield as 812nd with 8,340 people. 6\n\nMigration of the Mansfield family to Ireland\n\nSome of the Mansfield family moved to Ireland, but this topic is not covered in this excerpt. More information about their life in Ireland is included in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nMansfield migration to the United States +\n\nMany English families left England, to avoid the chaos of their homeland and migrated to the many British colonies abroad. Although the conditions on the ships were extremely cramped, and some travelers arrived diseased, starving, and destitute, once in the colonies, many of the families prospered and made valuable contributions to the cultures of what would become the United States and Canada.

The British continued to expand the settlements including setting the First Federation in the British West Indies by 1674; some of the islands include Barbados, Bermuda, Cayman Island, Turks and Caicos, Jamaica and Belize then known as British Honduras. By the 1960's many of the islands became independent after the West Indies Federation which existed from 1958 to 1962 failed due to internal political conflicts.
