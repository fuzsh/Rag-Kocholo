        "text": "John Legend is known for the energy he brings to any piano or vocal performance — but it looks like his 1-year-old son is aiming to do his dad one better!\n\nIn a July 21 Instagram post, Chrissy Teigen gave fans a behind-the-scenes look at the Legend family enjoying the dog days of summer at home. In the sixth slide of the post, their youngest, Wren, stole the show with a hyper-energetic toy piano performance that was so passionate, the little guy fell over. It’s cuteness overload, as is par for the course for the Legend children.\n\n\"In summmmmmerrrrrrr,\" Teigen captioned. Her Instagram carousel was filled with sweet moments of their kids (the couple also share Luna, 8 Miles, 6, and Est, 1), but all eyes were on Wren as he took after Legend himself.\n\nAs any parent will tell you, watching a child take after Mom or Dad with a genuine shared interest is a sight to behold, and Wren perfectly his piano skills at such a young age should make Legend and Teigen beam with pride. Is there a career as an artist in Wren’s future?\n\nJohn Legend is back on The Voice for Season 27\n\nAs announced earlier this year, Legend will make his long-awaited return to The Voice in Season 27 after taking a brief hiatus to spend time with his family and finish up his latest tour dates.\n\nThe one-time Voice winner always alluded to coming back, and thankfully, his return came sooner than most fans expected.\n\n\"My family's growing, I have a new album out, I'm gonna do a little bit of touring, and so it's probably better that I take a break,\" Legend told Entertainment Tonight in 2022. “But I'll be back on The Voice, just not this coming season.\"\n\nLegend’s promise will come true in Season 27. However, fans will have to wait a little bit longer, because before he returns, Season 26 will take place this fall on NBC! Gwen Stefani returns as a Coach, joining defending champion Reba McEntire and two rookie Coaches: Michael Bublé and Snoop Dogg."
