        "text": "Tom joined FWAG South West in 2016, working his way from assistant to senior adviser in Somerset. As a senior adviser, Tom has worked on a wide range of projects with a focus on the Quantock Hills, where he ran the local facilitation fund and helped deliver the E.L.M.S Test and Trial. Tom continues to work with Farmers in this area and around Somerset to promote nature recovery and sustainable land management.\n\nA previous career and qualifications in ecology has given Tom a passion for British wildlife and the natural world. Over the years this has developed into a specialism around habitat creation and management including woodland and heathlands."
