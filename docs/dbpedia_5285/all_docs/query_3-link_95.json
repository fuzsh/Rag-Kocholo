        "text": "Newport County fans have adopted the motto 'in Huw we trust' as they witness a revolution gathering pace at Rodney Parade.\n\nChange was in the air last autumn when the Supporters' Trust overwhelmingly backed the vision of former Swansea City chairman Huw Jenkins, whose takeover of the League Two outfit was completed in January.\n\nAfter a few months to survey the scene, the mastermind of the 'Swansea way' has instigated a close-season revamp.\n\nGraham Coughlan and his coaching team departed just before pre-season preparations started. Players were signed – even before a head coach was appointed.\n\nAnd a fortnight after his appointment as 'lead coach', Nelson Jardim was elevated to head coach.\n\nPlayers arrived at a sometimes bewildering regularity in the summer - 12 so far - with all bar the returning striker Courtney Baker Richardson between the ages of 22 and 24.\n\nThe departure of last season’s top scorer Will Evans to Mansfield will leave a big hole to fill up front, but fits the Jenkins way of selling talent to develop the club long-term. It remains to be seen whether other players will arrive with coffers boosted.\n\nCan Jenkins lay the ground for another football fairy tale? It's likely to take time.\n\nFor now his track record at Swansea is calming any nerves. On the evidence so far, it won’t be dull.\n\nHow did last season go?\n\nIt had its moments. They gave Manchester United a real fright in a memorable FA Cup third round tie at Rodney Parade and pulled off home wins over the two automatically promoted sides, Stockport County and Wrexham.\n\nBut they also had to cope with horrendous injuries and their small squad flagged badly at the end of the season, finishing with eight successive defeats.\n\nEarly in 2024 Newport were in touching distance of the play-off places. Their downward spiral ensured they finished the season 18th – three places below the previous campaign.\n\nThat said, straight-talking Coughlan was generally well liked by the Newport fans. His character embodied the DNA of a club which has had to scrap for everything, including its very existence.\n\nFor most of the season Coughlan showed he could operate with good effect in trying circumstances on one of the lowest budgets in the fourth tier.\n\nBut Jenkins is a de facto director of football who wants things done his way and Coughlan is an old style hands-on manager. It never appeared a football marriage made in heaven.\n\nIf anything, the parting of the ways with Coughlan came later than some expected. Coughlan left with head held high – Newport have set out on a different path.\n\nWhat are their prospects this season?\n\nFrankly, it’s anyone’s guess, but the elements need to gel quickly.\n\nUnder Jenkins, Newport have not just embarked upon an overhaul of manpower, a familiar process for lower division clubs.\n\nThe Jenkins method involves a different the style of play, with an emphasis on passing and building from the back. Done well, it's great to watch, but it takes time to perfect and defensively can bring its own problems.\n\nNewport have lost vast on-field knowhow with longest serving player Scot Bennett and striker Omar Bogle gone. Their new recruits significantly reduce the average age of the squad, but they must adapt to the demands of League Two quickly.\n\nThis is the Jenkins strategy to develop young talent who can affect the team, sell them for a good price and ensure the profit strengthens the entire club. Hence the need for patience.\n\nThe sale of last season’s top scorer Evans was not unexpected. Whether some of the proceeds will be spent before the deadline remains to be seen. The return of Baker-Richardson looks adroit.\n\nMidfielder Aaron Wildig will surely thrive under the new style, Bryn Morris remains a key figure and the permanent return of Wales under-21 utility player Matt Baker brings versatility. Left-back Anthony Glennon has impressed in pre-season while Cameron Atwi, signed from Cardiff, has undoubted flair.\n\nBut it’s a tough ask for Jardim in his first managerial post. He will need all the knowledge gleaned from working under former Swansea bosses Paulo Sousa, Carlos Carvalhal, Paul Clement and Francesco Guidolin, along with Aitor Karanka at Birmingham.\n\nArguably, Jenkins’ greatest skill at Swansea was his ability to pick suitable coaches to create a brand dubbed the 'Swansea way', which he is trying to emulate here.\n\nThe launch of Roberto Martinez’ managerial career, seven years in the Premier League and Swansea’s struggles since is testimony to Jenkins’ track record.\n\nNewport fans have put their trust in Jenkins, hoping he has not lost the Midas Touch.\n\nHead coach Nelson Jardim's said: “The boys are really enjoying the process, and you can see that on the pitch. There is still obviously a lot of work to be done, but it is coming.\n\n“The boys have been brilliant. They have worked really hard, and I have nothing but positive things to say.\n\n“It’s been tough for us at the same time as we’ve had our ups and downs, but that’s expected with the amount of change over the summer.\n\n\"We’ve had a lot of trialists in over pre-season and it’s taken the players time to adjust to the new style of play. Overall, I’m happy with how pre-season has gone.\"\n\nTransfers in\n\nAnthony Glennon (Grimsby, free), Ciaran Brennan (Sheff Wed, free), Joe Thomas (Swansea City), Kai Whitmore (Haverfordwest, free) Oliver Greaves (Mickleover, free), Jacob Carney (Sunderland, free), Matt Baker (Stoke City, free), Michael Spellman (Sunderland, free), Courtney Baker-Richardson (Crewe Alexandra, free), Cameron Antwi (Cardiff), Cameron Evans (Taunton Town, free) , Bobby Kamwa (Burton Albion, free).\n\nTransfers out"
