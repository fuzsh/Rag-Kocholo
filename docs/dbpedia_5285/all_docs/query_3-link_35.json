David M. Corbet on 8 Nov 1848\n\nJoseph Lafayette (26 Feb 1830-20 Sep 1855)\n\nRobert F. (1 Feb 1831-????) â m. Kathryn Lavina Angle in 1851\n\nWilliam E. (Mar 1836-24 Apr 1908) â m. Sarah Abigale Jett on 30 Jan 1861\n\nThomas Monroe (14 Jan 1839-27 Apr 1865)\n\nJohn Andrew âAndrewâ (Mar 1842-190x) â m. Emily Golde Palmer about 1886\n\nThomas was born in Tennessee, parents unknown, although thereâs reason to believe his motherâs name was Sarah. Familysearch.org postings claim his parents were Robert Mansfield and Sarah Grissom, both from Virginia, who married in 1788 in Greene County, Tennessee. Thatâs certainly a good bet, but Iâve seen no evidence.\n\nCatherine was also from Tennessee, the second of eleven or twelve children to James McCuistion II from Guilford County, North Carolina and Isabella Scott from eastern Tennessee.\n\nThomas and Catherine married on 26 Dec 1816 in Jefferson County.\n\nI donât know for certain where they were for the first decades of their marriage. The 1830 census showed a Thomas Mansfield family of the right age in the Regiment 67 township in Monroe County, 70-odd miles west-southwest of Jefferson County. They were a man in his thirties and a woman in her twenties with six children: two boys and a girl age 5-9, and two boys and a girl under 5. Some other man in his twenties was with them, most likely a brother to one of the couple.\n\n[When Tennessee created the new counties of Monroe and McMinn in 1819, it established the 67th Regiment as the state militia for McMinn, and the 66th Regiment as the militia for Monroe. I donât know why a township named for the 67th was in Monroe County.]\n\nAt some point they moved to Georgia, where the 1840 census found them in District 919 of Floyd County. They were a couple in their forties, with an unexplained man in his thirties and an unexplained woman in her twenties (maybe the presumed brother from the 1830 census and his wife), and seven children: a boy age 15-19, a boy and girl age 10-14, two boys age 5-9, and two boys under 5. The four younger boys must have been Joseph, Robert, William, and Thomas Jr. The girl could have been Isabella.\n\nTheir son John Andrew was born in Georgia in 1842. They returned to Tennessee between then and 1850, when the census showed them back in Jefferson County. Thomas (58), carpenter, and Catharine (53) had children Joseph (20), Robert (17), William (15), Thomas (12), and Andrew (8), plus an unexplained child from Tennessee named Margaret Jones (8). An orphaned grand-daughter, maybe?\n\nIn 1860, the household was down to Thomas (68), Catherine (60), and sons William (24), Thomas M. (21), and Andrew (18).\n\nIn 1870, it was just Thomas (78), and Catharine (70), and son Andrew (28). This was the only census to say that Andrew was born in Georgia. It also noted that he was blind. Son Robert (37) and wife Lavina (39) were living next door with their children.\n\nThomas died the following year. Although thereâs a findagrave.com memorial page for him, his burial location is unknown.\n\nIn 1880, Catherine (80) was still living with Andrew (38), still in District 4, Jefferson County. Catherine died in 1886. She is believed to be buried in Long Creek Cemetery. Given where Long Creek is, I think this is the one also called both Hinkle Cemetery (because itâs about 100 yards east of Hinkle Road) and Mansfield Cemetery. Itâs in a grove of trees in a bend of Hinkle Road, about a mile north of the intersection of I-81 and I-40, and a few miles north-northeast of Dandridge. Google Maps shows no public access to the site.\n\nChildren\n\nfour unknown boys (born 1820s)\n\nThe 1830 and 1840 census records show that these four existed, but no names. I find no trace of them after 1840.\n\nIsabella Sarah Mansfield (1827-1901)\n\nIsabella has her own entry in the family tree. At this point, placing her in this family is still speculation.\n\nJoseph Lafayette Mansfield (1830-1855)\n\nJoseph died in 1855. Thereâs no indication that he married or had children. There are two findagrave.com pages for him, placing him in both Mansfield Cemetery, and Hinkle Cemetery in Edna. As noted above, these seem to be the same cemetery.\n\nRobert F. Mansfield (1831-????)\n\nRobert married Kathryn Lavina Angle (6 Oct 1829-30 Apr 1909) in 1851. Known children:\n\nJudah C. (25 Apr 1853-1 Apr 1875)\n\nJacob T. (1855)\n\nIsabelle Caroline (17 Dec 1856-1929) â m. Enoch Carroll Bohannon\n\nJohn M. (4 Feb 1859-????) â m. Margaret Rebecca Bohannon in 1877\n\nAmanda Elizabeth (18 Mar 1860-27 Jan 1941) â m. William Sims Weaver\n\nRobert James âBobâ (16 Aug 1865-19 Feb 1931) â m. Mary Belle Swearingen\n\nHyman Monroe (1869)\n\nEllen Missouri (18 Oct 1872-4 Jan 1953) â m. George Martin Kimberlin in 1896\n\nThe 1860 census showed them in Carter Township, Carter County, Missouri with what I assume were Lavinaâs parents, Jacob and Judy âAnglerâ. Two of their children â Amanda and Robert â were later born there. They returned to Jefferson County after the war.\n\nIn 1870, they were living in District 4 next door to Robertâs parents and brother Andrew. In the 1870s, they headed back west. They were in Franklin, Laclede County, Missouri by the time their daughter Judah died in 1875, and were still there for the 1880 census. They later moved further west, to Oklahoma. I donât know when Robert died. Thereâs a findagrave.com page for him, but no location or date. Lavina died in 1909, and is buried in Berlin Cemetery, Berlin, Roger Mills County, Oklahoma.\n\nWilliam E. Mansfield (1836-1908)\n\nWilliam married Sarah Abigale Jett (14 Aug 1830-10 Aug 1905) in 1861. Known children:\n\nunnamed girl (18 Mar 1862-18 Mar 1862)\n\nAlice Dickey (21 May 1867-3 Jul 1932) â m. John C. Sartin on 20 Jan 1885\n\nMary P. (14 Oct 1868-29 Oct 1868)\n\nAnn (1876-19xx)\n\nWilliam enlisted in Company D, 3rd Tennessee Cavalry, which fought for the Union. His dates of service were 1 Dec 1862 to 10 Jul 1865. He was captured, and was one of the Union prisoners being tranported home aboard the steamboat Sultana when it exploded near Memphis just after the end of the war. Unlike his brother Thomas, he survived the ordeal.\n\nHe worked as a carpenter. The 1870 census showed him in Civil District 2 of Jefferson County with Sarah and daughter Alice (3). In 1880 they were in District 12, with daughters âAllesâ (13) and âAnâ (4). The 1890 census of Union veterans showed William still living in Jefferson County, and in 1900 he and Sarah were still there. Sarah died in 1905; William died in 1908 in Knoxville. I donât know where either one is buried. Their two infant children are buried in Mansfield Cemetery, which is about 100 yards east of Hinkle Road and a few miles north-northeast of Dandridge.\n\nThomas Monroe Mansfield (1839-1865)\n\nThomas Jr. enlisted in Company D, 3rd Tennessee Cavalry, which fought for the Union. He held the rank of sergeant. He was captured, and was one of the Union prisoners being brought back home aboard the steamboat Sultana when it exploded just after the end of the war. Unlike his brother William, he didnât survive. His body wasnât recovered, but thereâs a findagrave.com memorial for him linked to Hinkle Cemetery in Edna, Jefferson County. There are records of his pension until at least 1871, but they donât mention who was receiving it.\n\nJohn Andrew âAndrewâ Mansfield (1842-190x)\n\nAndrew, the youngest, was listed by the 1870 and 1900 censuses as born in Georgia, but not by the 1850, 1860, or 1880 censuses. I believe it anyway, because it fits with the familyâs appearance in Georgia in the 1840 census. Andrew lived with his parents until their deaths, probably because he was blind. I donât know whether he was born that way or suffered a disease or injury, but he was listed as such in 1870 and 1880.\n\nAbout 1886, Andrew married Emily Golde Palmer (Mar 1842-8 Jun 1916) from Rockbridge, Virginia. The 1900 census showed them living in Jefferson county, no children. It didnât ask about blindness, but did say Andrew couldnât read or write, although his wife could. In 1910, Emily, now widowed, was living with a nephew, William H. Mills (1853-1936), in Jefferson County. She died in 1916.\n\nLinks\n\nhttp://boards.rootsweb.com/localities.northam.usa.states.tennessee.counties.jefferson/491/mb.ashx -- I think this was Thomasâs brother\n\nhttps://www.myheritage.com/names/catherine_mccuistion -- Catherineâs mother Isabella Scott\n\nhttps://www.myheritage.com/names/catherine_mc%20quiston -- same\n\nhttps://www.ancestry.co.uk/boards/thread.aspx?mv=flat&m=75&p=surnames.mccuistion -- Catherineâs parents, grandparents\n\nhttps://www.ancestry.com/boards/surnames.nelson/2507.2521.2547.2554/mb.ashx -- Catherineâs relatives\n\nhttp://www.gmccuistion.com/john1855/b12050.htm#P12050 -- Catherineâs father and siblings\n\nhttp://www.mygenealogyhound.com/arkansas-biographies/ar-izard-county-biographies/james-mccuistion-genealogy-izard-county-arkansas.html# -- A McCuistion who moved to Izard County, AR; poss.

Clifton (1800-1852). There was indeed a Susannah who married Wilson M. Clifton and had the children cited by that ancestry.com page, but findagrave.com gives her dates as 1815-1900 and her maiden name as Wood. Therefore, I have not included her in the list of the Mansfield children, despite the suggestive fact that she had a son named Mansfield.\n\nThis Susannah married Wilson M. Clifton (1800-1852) from South Carolina, probably in 1830. The 1830 census showed Wilson living in Lawrence County, Tennessee, with a teenaged wife and a young daughter. (There was a wedding on 5 Jan 1830 in Lawrence County, Tennessee of a M. D. Clifton, but the brideâs name is not listed.) Known children:\n\nSammantha (1836-????)\n\nPatrick Henry (1833-1932)\n\nR. H. (1840-????)\n\nAlmardina or Shurrinda (1842-????)\n\nHetty Alma (1844-1894) â m. Brooks\n\nAnn Eliza G. (1846-1920) â m. Farrow\n\nMansfield William (1847-1927)\n\nSarah Elizabeth (1850-1917) â m. Megginson\n\nThe children were all born in Tennessee, so the family stayed in that state until at least 1850, but I canât track them between 1830 and the appearance of Susannah and family in the 1860 census for Tippah County, Mississippi. Susannah died in 1900 and is buried in Benton County, Mississippi.\n\nhttps://www.ancestry.com/genealogy/records/thomas-mansfield_165221091 -- That page\n\nhttps://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QK41-SX9T -- 1830 wedding\n\nhttps://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QK41-SX9W -- ditto, with some writing\n\nhttps://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XHG2-V8F -- 1830 census\n\nhttps://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:M6GX-K2J -- 1860 census\n\nhttps://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MFSY-CNX -- 1870 census"
