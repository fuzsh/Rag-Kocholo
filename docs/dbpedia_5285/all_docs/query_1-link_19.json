These emails are financial scams or phishing scams and include the fraudster emailing details about an unclaimed inheritance for the recipient, with the target of the fraud asked to email back for further information.\n\nCloned website\n\nIn this scam a copy of a genuine website for a firm of solicitors may be used to create a fake or cloned firm. This firm may issue spurious proceedings and seek cash to settle the claim or may seek to charge you in advance for services that will not materialise. Thomas Mansfield do not use any other website address other than:\n\nhttps://www.tmemploymentlaw.co.uk/\n\nhttps://www.tmfamilylaw.co.uk/\n\nhttps://www.tmwillsandprobate.co.uk/\n\nThomas Mansfield Solicitors, Thomas Mansfield Wills & Inheritance Planning, TM Wills and Probate, TM Family Law, TM Employment Law and Thomas Mansfield, and our partners and staff members have no involvement in these or any other scams. Our names are being used without our authorisation."
