        "text": "Highland Lakes and Dams\n\nLCRA operates six dams on the lower Colorado River in Central Texas: Buchanan, Inks, Wirtz, Starcke, Mansfield and Tom Miller. These dams form the six Highland Lakes: Buchanan, Inks, LBJ, Marble Falls, Travis and Austin. Two of the Highland Lakes – Buchanan and Travis – are the region’s water supply reservoirs to serve more than 1 million people as well as businesses, industries, the environment and agriculture in the lower Colorado River basin.\n\nEach of the dams was built to help manage floods and generate hydroelectric power. The dams in the Highland Lakes chain have hydroelectric generation stations that contribute to the Central Texas energy supply. Together, the hydroelectric plants at the dams can provide more than 295 megawatts of power.\n\nRead more about LCRA's hydroelectric generation\n\nLCRA moves water downstream to meet water supply needs through hydroelectric turbines, creating power along the way. Power generation at LCRA’s six dams along the Highland Lakes was once the major source of LCRA’s electric generation capacity, but LCRA now releases water solely to generate electricity only when directed to do so by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. Hydroelectric generation is a small portion of the power LCRA produces today, but it remains an important part of the Texas power grid.\n\nLCRA is in the midst of a multi-year rehabilitation program to increase the useful life, generating capacity and production efficiency of the dams.\n\nBuchanan Dam and Lake Buchanan\n\nYear completed: 1938\n\nPrimary purpose: Water supply, hydroelectric power\n\nLocation: Burnet and Llano counties\n\nOwner: LCRA\n\nBuchanan Dam and Lake Buchanan were the first completed in the Highland Lakes chain.

The dam was built across a deep canyon at Marshall Ford, a long-time river crossing and settlement. After a severe flood in July 1938, LCRA raised the height of the dam to add storage capacity for floodwaters.\n\nLake Travis is the only lake in the Highland Lakes chain specifically designed to hold back floodwaters. Lake Travis is considered full for water supply purposes at 681 feet msl. At that level, the lake contains 1.1 million acre-feet of water. Lake Travis is designed to hold an additional 776,062 acre-feet of floodwaters in what is referred to as the flood pool.\n\nLCRA is engaged in a multi-year, multi-million dollar renovation project to rehab and restore the dam’s floodgates to their original condition.

Named for an Austin mayor, the dam was built atop the remains of two earlier structures, both called Austin Dam. The first was built from 1890 to 1893, and the other from 1912 to 1915. Massive floods destroyed the first dam and heavily damaged the second.\n\nIn October 2020, LCRA completed a major project to replace the original floodgates on Tom Miller Dam to help maintain continued reliability and safety of the dam for generations to come. The $10.8 million project continues LCRA’s investment in the dam and marks the dam’s second extensive renovation since it was completed in 1940.\n\nRead more Tom Miller Dam and Lake Austin\n\nTom Miller Dam\n\nDimensions\n\n100.5 feet high, 1,590 feet long\n\nGenerating capacity\n\n17 megawatts\n\nTop of dam\n\n517 feet msl\n\nOverflow spillway elevation\n\n492.8 feet msl\n\nFloodgates\n\n9\n\nDischarge capacity\n\n108,000 cubic feet per second (cfs):\n\n4 large floodgates at 15,300 cfs each\n\n5 small floodgates at 8,580 cfs each\n\n1 turbine at 1,970 cfs\n\n1 turbine at 1,750 cfs\n\nLake Austin\n\nLake area\n\n1,830 acres\n\nElevation when full\n\n492.8 feet msl\n\nVolume when full\n\n24,644 acre-feet\n\nHistoric high\n\n495.2 feet msl on May 25, 1981\n\nHistoric low\n\n474.3 feet msl on Feb. 17, 1963\n\nTarget operating range\n\n491.8 to 492.8 feet msl\n\n100-year flood level at dam\n\n493 feet msl\n\nDimensions\n\n20.25 miles long, 1,300 feet at widest point\n\nOriginal name\n\nLake McDonald"
