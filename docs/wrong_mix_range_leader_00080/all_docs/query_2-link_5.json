        "text": "Decision made - the model 1936 Uniform (continued)\n\nA postscript on the Coats and Tunics\n\nOne other reason that the rank insignias were moved from shoulder patches to the collar was that in the field the epaulettes resulted in the rucksack rings chafing. Removing the epaulettes / rank insignia removed this problem, or at least reduced it. It should also be mentioned that despite the design improvements, the m/36 greatcoat and uniform was still not entirely comfortable in field use. Post Winter-War, the new m/43 uniform would be introduced which would be based on a detailed assessment of the performance of the m/36 in the Winter War. Assessment, re-design and field trials in 1942 based on almost a year of combat use through 1940 by the entire Maavoimat would result in a new uniform that was a vast improvement over the old.\n\nTrousers\n\nNo self-respecting uniform is complete without trousers (unless of course you’re Scottish). Finland, as has been mentioned, was heavily influenced by German uniform design and opted for breeches for the m/36 uniform. These were worn by pretty much every soldier in all ranks. The pants featured a high waist, button fly and adjustment tabs on the sides. No belt loops were fitted, as the breeches were meant to be worn with suspenders. The leg cuffs tapered towards the end, and were secured with a strap that went under the foot and buttoned up to the side. At the time, breeches were still widely worn by civilians (and would remain so well into the 1950's, and probably even later in northern Finland).\n\nImage sourced from: http://www.varusteleka.com/pictures/16129.jpg\n\nMaavoimat M/36 Uniform – Tunic, Breeches and Boots\n\nM/36 Caps\n\nThe caps worn by the Finnish soldier remained unchanged. The first m/22 style remained in service throughout the war as summer and dress versions for the troops. Minor alterations were made in construction and color but the style remained virtually unchanged. The m/22 was intended to be replaced by the all-purpose m/36 cap but in practice both were used. An m/34 cap was also trialed and for winter wear this had a separate quilted liner (of quilted cotton or silk) that could be snapped into the inside of the cap for added insulation. The sweatband was leather. The m/34 experimental and the simplified wool m/36 cap (which did not have the snap in liner) were essentially the same style but the m/36 cap used a gray soft cotton cloth lining.\n\nImage sourced from: http://www.mosinnagant.net/finland/images/m36_caps1.JPG\n\nNotice the different wool colors. The middle hat, 2nd row, is the summer m36 hat with National emblem.\n\nBoth of these all season caps were hot in the summer months and so the m/22 style continued to be worn in the summer months. This prompted a change and in 1939 an updated version of the m/22 was made to correspond with the new m/36 uniform. This was made of lightweight cotton. 1939 also saw the adoption of a fur winter cap made of heavy gray wool with a sheepskin inner, it had flaps that tied at the top to hold them up. The front brow flap was attached in the up position with a small metal snap.\n\nImage sourced from: http://www.mosinnagant.net/finland/imag ... r_caps.JPG\n\nM/39 Winter Hat: Australian and New Zealand clothing manufacturers would supply large numbers of m/39 fur winter hats manufactured in the heavy wool / sheepskin inner combination. There was no shortage of sheepskin or woolen textile material in either country.\n\nBoots\n\nWith the introduction the m/36 uniform came new footwear. No less than five different versions were tested for use. The standard high calf type leather boot with sewn leather sole was standard issue. An ankle height boot was also approved. Many of the early boots used wooden studs on the sole like hobnails but these quickly wore down and it does not appear that they were replaced. Another version of the calf boot was a half-felt version for winter use. These boots kept the shoe portion leather but the upper half was fabricated in black felt/wool material and they used a rubber sole. The use of Laplander style boots was fairly common amongst the Suojeluskuntas but Army stores produced a generic version for issue to ski troopers. If footwear was not available to the troops (more common than not at the start of the Winter War) then civilian foot-gear was worn in the field. The last version of the boot was strictly a winter version. Felt boots were fine insulators and were available they were prized possessions. Most boots worn by Finnish soldiers in the early months of the Winter War came into Finnish service from home-use along with their owners - or in circumstances where their original Russian owners were no longer in need of them.\n\nImage sourced from: http://www.mosinnagant.net/images/lapan ... rboots.JPG\n\n\"Lapp\" boots on the left with the distinctive curled toe for engaging the cross country ski bindings and a pair of black issue boots of the Army on the right. The Lapp boots are also of Army issue but modeled after the local boots. Many Lapp boots had a large flap to fold up the leg to prevent deep snow from entering via the top of the soldier’s boots.\n\nImage sourced from: http://www.kevos4.com/images/Boots1.jpg\n\nWartime Felt-lined boots on left. The Finnish ski boots on the right have a turned-up toe for fitting into skis.\n\nImage sourced from: http://www.kevos4.com/images7/brown_boots.jpg\n\nFinnish military boots - brown\n\n[Image sourced from: http://digi.kansalliskirjasto.fi/pienpa ... =4&type=hq\n\nAnother type of boot that was less common, but highly prized by its owners, were the Suomen Gummitehdas Oy (\"Nokia\") Wellington Boots (in fact, before its entry into the mobile phone business, rubber boots were among the best-known products of Nokia outside of Finland). As early as 1935 and 1936, all Border Guard companies received a batch of different Suomen Gummitehdas Oy (\"Nokia\") wellingtons for testing. They were generally preferred over leather and rubber-tipped leather boots in wet and wet & cold weather. Most Border Guard units ordered a few dozen short \"Pelto\" and longer \"Laatokka\" wellingtons from Nokia after the trials. While the Finnish Defence Forces did not issue wellington boots prior to the Winter War, they were on the shopping list “if available”. Worn with winter socks or foot-cloth wrappings, they were warm and kept the feet dry in the sometimes muddy conditions of the trenches and in the wet conditions of spring and autumn.\n\nSimilarly to Finland, there are two British Commonwealth countries where “Wellington” boots were (and are) ubiquitous. These are Canada and New Zealand. In Canada, Wellingtons specifically made for cold weather, lined with warm insulating material, were especially popular practical footwear for Canadian winters – and large numbers of such boots would be sent to Finland from Canada early in the Winter War (as we will see when we look at aid from Ca. In New Zealand, Wellingtons were generally called \"gumboots\" or \"wellies\" and were essential foot wear for New Zealand farmers as well as for abattoir workers, butchers, fishermen and schoolchildren in winter. In the early 1930’s, the largest footwear company in New Zealand was “Hannahs”, with 19 stores across the North Island, 11 in the South Island and a factory in Wellington which manufactured, among other shoe types, large quantities of Wellington Boots.\n\nHannahs had been founded by Robert Hannah, an Irish emigrant from Country Antrim (who had been apprenticed as a boot-maker in his youth), who opened his first boot shop in 1868 during the West Coast (of the South Island of New Zealand) gold rush. He moved to Wellington when the gold rush ended, and in June 1874 advertising in the Evening Post newspaper announced the opening on Lambton Quay of Robert Hannah & Co., who \"had long and practical experience in the business\" and sought the patronage of the people of Wellington.The business prospered and by 1879 there was another branch (and factory) in Cuba Street, followed by stores in Molesworth Street and Willis Street a few years later. By 1897, there were 10 stores in the North Island, set up with the assistance of Robert's younger brother, William, who had come out from Ireland in 1879. Although Robert was a manufacturer and retailer of footwear, he was also an importer, and claimed this was the profitable side of the business. The top floor of the Cuba Street premises was originally a small factory but by the early 1890's it had become too small, and the \"Palace G\" boot factory (of five floors) was built behind the Lambton Quay premises.\n\nImage sourced from: http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/etexts/Gov1 ... il018a.jpg\n\nHandworkers on heavy boots, Hannah's Shoe Factory, Wellington, New Zealand\n\nThis building was designed by the New Zealand architect Thomas Turnball, and began a long business relationship between the two men. Some 124 staff were employed here, and its weekly output was about 3000 pairs of boots - or about half the boot trade in New Zealand at the time. By 1908, business was so good that a combined factory/warehouse (of 2 floors) was built behind the Cuba Street premises. This was further expanded when adjoining properties were purchased. The building was also the company's head office for many years. Robert Hannah himself was an entrepreneur of his times, a shrewd and hard businessman, who also cared deeply for his staff. He paid them above the going wage, and worked hard to keep them employed during the Depression years. Robert Hannah died in 1930 but his family continued with the business. By late 1939, Hannahs owned 42 retail branches across New Zealand, employed more than 750 people and were the largest footwear manufacturer in New Zealand, rivaling the largest boot manufacturing plants in the British Empire (Hannahs is still in existence today and is New Zealand's most famous footwear brand. They have 52 stores nation-wide, as well as stores in Australia).\n\nIn November 1939, a single Finnish Purchasing Team representative from Sydney travelled to New Zealand together with the Secretary from the Finnish Consulate in Sydney to place orders with New Zealand clothing and footwear manufacturers. Following an inspection of the Hannahs factory, an order was placed for “as many Wellington Boots as the Company\n\nExcerpts of his report on the Hannahs factory, dated January 1 1940, translated from Finnish and republished in the “New Zealand Railways Magazine” (http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-Gov14_10Rail-t1-body-d6.html) reads as follows:\n\n“I was taken through the vast establishment by a foreman whose service with the company exceeded forty years. He had spent two years in America, familiarising himself with the methods of the famous Selby Factory, and the assembly of plants and the systems of any countries were familiar to him. He was sincerely of the opinion that Hannah's were abreast of modern footwear-making in all respects. The huge factory is rather like a self-contained township; its spaciousness and actual size are impressive, and one gets the feeling of a large and busy population. Hannah's make the whole range of footwear, from the smart feminine street shoe to the man's welted brogue, from the schoolgirl's sandal to the heavy military boot.”\n\nImage sourced from: http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/etexts/Gov1 ... l019a(h280).jpg\n\nThe “Clicking” room at Hannah's factory, Wellington, New Zealand\n\n“We went first to the preparing rooms, where the multitudinous patterns are cut, where skiving, perforating and other processes are carried on. “Skiving,” means shaving off the leather, and “clicking” means cutting out the uppers, and so on. This work is done by hand at Hannah's, for with leather at three shillings per foot, human care is worth its place. The various leathers come from all parts of the world, a substantial proportion of course being New Zealand-grown and tanned. Leather is a natural product, and its variations depend largely on environment and other regional circumstances. For instance, calf-skins come largely from France and the other countries that eat veal freely. The “chain” system of operations enters largely into this modern factory's organisation. Each man does one operation with skill and speed, and the article passes on, after inspection at chosen points.\n\nAt the ends of these lines, the shoes pour off for the finishing processes, and the imagination boggles at the moving masses of five-tier trolleys laden with shoes, taking selected routes like a crowd of trams at a Helsinki Exhibition rush hour. I had a look at a “Consolidated Laster.” This uncanny, almost human mechanism, grabs the leather upper, pinches and shapes it round and tacks it on, all in the same operation, at the rate of 150 tacks a minute, the operative working a simple knee-grip device. The Shoe Seat machine puts in eighteen tacks at one shot, and the Pulling Over machine pulls the toe into position and drives in the tacks at the same time. The tacks run down parallel tubes into their proper positions. The machine stitching of a welted shoe is an interesting operation, for no handwork could get the same strength and durability. All shoes are re-blocked, that is to say they are put back on the lasts and go through levelling and fitting processes. The making of heels has more to it than I imagined. The shaped leather layers are stamped out to the exact size, placed together, joined, and then a crusher compresses them and makes the hollow necessary for attachment to the sole.”\n\nImage sourced from: http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/etexts/Gov1 ... l019b(h280).jpg\n\nShoes on trolleys moving to the finishing department, Hannah's factory, Wellington, New Zealand\n\n“The soles themselves are cut out by instruments resembling die-presses, and the number, shapes and variety of sizes are bewildering. In the leather storeroom, there is a lesson in general geography. Although a substantial proportion of the materials come from New Zealand, the world is combed by Hannah's for the extraordinary diversity of coloured leathers, fabrics, crepe rubbers, ornaments, and the other thousandand-one things needed to make footwear for New Zealanders. I found one outstanding fact about wholesale boot-making; the secret is inspection. Hannah's inspection is constant and thorough-going, and, as they sell their goods only through their own stores, they guarantee every purchase. This giant institution, the achievement of one of New Zealand’s pioneers, is something of which even Nokia could be proud. Hannah's is, in truth, a National Footwear Service.”\n\nImage sourced from: http://mebooks.co.nz/clients/library.hu ... 00171a.jpg\n\nThe huge modern factory where Hannah Footwear is manufactured to-day. The largest and most up-to-date Shoe Factory in New Zealand\n\nHannahs could manufacture some 7,000 military style boots per week (OTL note: this was in fact the actual production capacity of the Hannahs factory, there were also other footwear manufacturers in New Zealand with similar production capacity such as Ducksworths in Christchurch) and in the first meeting with the Finnish Purchasing Team representative, indicated a willingness to place the complete factory workforce on the manufacturing of boots to meet any Finnish order as long as payment was guaranteed. In addition and unasked, Hannahs stated that they would collect donated Wellington Boots at every Hannahs retail outlet across New Zealand and collect them for shipping in Wellington together with the shipment from the Factory in Wellington. As we will see a little further on in this Post, the New Zealand Government stepped in with a Guarantee for all purchase orders placed by the Finnish Purchasing Team with New Zealand manufacturers. The end result was that in the second week of November 1939, the Finnish Purchasing Team placed an order for some 40,000 Wellington Boots with Hannahs, to be collected in Wellington for shipment at the end of December. Production would commence immediately.\n\nHannahs offered to do their best to produce more if this would help and the offer was accepted, up to a maximum of 100,000 boots. In the event, by hiring retired employees, paying overtime and advertising for skilled workers on a temporary basis, Hannahs managed to manufacture 65,000 Wellington Boots. In addition, a further 15,000 boots were collected at Hannahs retail branches around New Zealand, some used, some new. In total, 80,000 Wellington Boots from New Zealand would arrive in Finland at the end of February 1940. Australia, on the other hand, would contribute large numbers of leather boots to Finnish military design. These would be the standard Finnish military boots and some 200,000 would be shipped off at the end of December 1939, with a further 150,000 pairs leaving in early February 1940.\n\nLeather Uniform Items\n\nIn addition to the sizable quantities of military boots from Australia, there was another little-known advantage in purchasing uniforms made of leather (such as those used by tank crews for example) from Australia. This was the large supply of kangaroo leather available. Leather made from kangaroo hide has a number of features which were, at that stage, little known outside of Australia. To start with, kangaroo leather is lighter and stronger than the hide of a cow or goat. It has 10 times the tensile strength of cowhide and is 50% stronger than goatskin. When compared to other leathers, such as that made from steer hide, kangaroo leather can be cut much thinner than steer hide leather whilst retaining the same strength. Similarly, when split into thinner sheets, kangaroo leather retains considerably more of the original tensile strength of the unsplit leather than does, for example, calf (when split to 20% of its original thickness, kangaroo retains between 30 to 60% of the tensile strength of the unsplit hide. Calf on the other hand split to 20% of original thickness retains only 1 to 4% of the original strength).\n\n(Empirically, in 1939 this was known. The reason why was not. Studies of the morphology of kangaroo leather have now explained these particular properties. The collagen fibre bundles in cattle hide are arranged in a complex weaving pattern. The fibres are often at angles as much as 90 degrees to the skin surface. Cattle hide also contains sweat glands, erector pili muscles and a distinct gradation in elastin levels, concentrated in the upper part of the skin. Kangaroo on the other hand has been shown to have a highly uniform orientation of fibre bundles in parallel with the skin surface. It does not contain sweat glands or erector pili muscles and elastin is evenly distributed throughout the skin thickness. This structural uniformity explains both the greater tensile strength of the whole leather and the greater retention of strength in splits. Bovine skin is much more complex in cross section. Hence in whole section it has many more weak points from which tears can start when placed under tension. In addition when sliced into splits the collagen fibres running at significant angles to the skin surface will be cut. These then become weak points in the structural strength).\n\nThe end result however was that in 1939, it was known that thinner kangaroo leather could be used while having the same strength as thicker and heavier steer-hide leather. In addition, kangaroo leather was substantially cheaper – the kangaroos were shot as vermin, with no costs involved in raising them, and there were large quantities available. The Finnish Purchasing Team was flexible on the type of leather to be used and prepared to listen to the Australian experts. The end result was that when ordering leathers for tankers of the Armoured Division, as well as leathers for Ilmavoimat pilots and aircrew, kangaroo leather was accepted as a permissible material. The result was that a large percentage of the tanker and aircrew leathers supplied to Finland from Australia were made from kangaroo leather – and the kangaroo leather uniforms were of a lighter weight and had greater flexibility and comfort than steer-hide leather. In combat, this gave Finnish tankers and aircrew a slight advantage in physical dexterity and freedom of movement inside the tanks and aircraft that they fought in. This may not seem like much, but in combat, even a fraction of a seconds speed in reaction time can make a difference – and kangaroo hide leather uniforms sometimes gave the Finnish soldiers that miniscule advantage that was the difference between life and death in combat.\n\nFinland would continue to buy kangaroo hide leather from Australia through WW2, and by the time Finland re-entered WW2 and declared war on Germany, the tank crews of the 4 Maavoimat Armoured Divisions in existence in early 1944 were equipped with kangaroo-hide leather uniforms, as were the tank crews of the Polish 1st Armoured Division and the 3 Norwegian Panserbataljonen that formed the armoured component of the 1st Norwegian Division attached to the Maavoimat.\n\nImage sourced from: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/c ... ljonen.jpg\n\nNorwegian Army Panserbataljonen insignia. The 3 Panserbataljonen were equipped with American supplied lend-lease equipment and were manned by Norwegian volunteers who had been regrouping in the Finnish-occupied Finnmark region of Norway from mid-1940 on. The Panserbataljonen were formed in late 1943 after the Finnish decision had been taken to enter the war against Germany.\n\nBelow are a series of illustrations of Maavoimat and Ilmavoimat uniforms and uniform items made from Australian leather.\n\nImage sourced from: http://www.kevos4.com/images/tankers_helmet.jpg\n\nLeather tankers helmet. Australia would manufacture a considerable number of these from kangaroo-hide. Kangaroo leather was selected as the leather of choice for tanker uniforms manufactured in Australia for the Maavoimat.\n\nImage sourced from: http://www.mosinnagant.net/images/tank2 ... eather.JPG\n\nHere a complete tank commanders uniform can be seen in detail with the special m/36 tunic made of black leather along with the black leather \"breeches”. His padded leather tankers helmet is held in his left hand. Prior to the Winter War, this tunic was rare due to the small number of armored crews and the limited production of the leather tunics. Where leather uniforms were not available, a heavy canvas type jumpsuit or the simple winter wool or lightweight cotton summer version of the m/36 uniform was used.\n\nImage sourced from: http://www.mosinnagant.net/images/sototankuni.JPG\n\nHere you can see the leather m/36 commander’s tunic on the left along with the padded tankers helmet worn for protection while in the fighting vehicle. The radio earphones are incorporated into the helmet. You can see the plug in cord for this headgear in the commander’s hand. The right side figure is shown with the grey canvas jumpsuit that was used as an alternative to the leather uniform. This figure is more than likely a radio operator/gunner than a commander due to the lack of rank insignia on his uniform and the standard enlisted mans cockade worn on his m/36 cap.\n\nImage sourced from: http://www.ww2incolor.com/d/689434-1/Fi ... Oct12_1941\n\nFinnish tank crew in front of their T-28 during a parade in Petroskoi on October 12, 1940, shortly prior to the withdrawal to the new Finnish-USSR border. The uniforms are Finnish Army standard issue M/36, the headgear looks like captured Soviet tank helmets rather than the better quality Australian kangaroo-hide leather headgear. An additional factor in using Soviet headgear was that the tanks for two of the three Maavoimat Armoured Divisions (as of October 1940) were very largely captured Soviets ones and these had Soviet interphone systems and if equipped with radio, typically also the original Soviet tank radios. Hence the microphone and headphone systems inbuilt in the Soviet tank helmets were compatible with this signal equipment. BTW, the second soldier from the left has interesting footwear which look like the extremely rare Finnish Army M/36 marching boots. Despite the uniforms and additional shipments of tanned leather supplied from Australia, the Maavoimat would experience a shortfall of leather tankers uniforms through until after the Winter War. With three Armoured Divisions by September 1940 (two of them equipped with captured Red Army tanks), the Maavoimat would, as in the photo above, issue most of the tankers with the m/36 uniforms. Generally, only the troopers of the 21st Armoured Division (the first to be formed) were fully equipped with leather tanker uniforms.\n\nImage sourced from: http://www.wiking.fi/kuvat/kustannus/asepukum36.jpg\n\nThe Finnish Army M/36 Uniform was the main uniform used in the Winter War of 1939-40. It was worn by hundreds of thousands of fighting men. “Asepuku M/36” by Petteri Leino (published by Wiking-Divisioona OY) is the standard reference on the M/36 Uniform and provides comprehensive coverage, containing many previously unpublished period pictures. Written by a uniform specialist, the colour pages show authentic uniforms worn together with authentic weapons and equipment. The book has English photo captions and an English summary for every chapter. Highly recommended if this is something that interests you.\n\nFinnish Uniforms – supply during the Winter War\n\nAfter the first year or two of production when older styles were updated and material was standardized, the model 1936 uniform remained unchanged through the Winter War. The biggest problem with the m/36 uniform however was the lack of them. When the Winter War broke out between Russia and Finland, the mobilisation of the reserves and the movement of the standing conscript army saw only the conscripts doing their period of military service outfitted in combat uniforms – and less than 30% of the mobilized reservists (and the bulk of those with uniforms were in point of fact Suojeluskuntas members and members of the “active” reserves who trained regularly and who had been issued uniforms as a result). With the war taking place in winter, the issue of proper winter jackets and great coats to the Army was in even more dire straights, as only 150,000 of some 750,000 troops and Lottas were outfitted with current army issue great coats and cold weather boots. The remaining troops, lottas, home guards and cadets (the boy and girl soldiers) wore the so-called \"model Cajander Uniform\" that was a mix and match of primarily civilian clothing augmented here and there with any available uniform issue. This was a serious problem but as mentioned, Prime Minister Cajander did not believe, even on all the evidence, that the USSR would attack Finland. And while he approved both mobilization and emergency arms purchases, he would stubbornly and seemingly without reason dig in his toes on the issue of purchasing uniforms.\n\nIncidentally, in addition to a lack of uniforms, there was a general lack of rank insignia and service branch patches and the Finnish military would in large fight through the Winter War without these. In the immediate post-war analysis of combat experiences, it was found that there was actually a significant difference in casualty rates between units where rank insignia was worn, and those without. As a direct result, the Finnish military would go into battle against Germany in 1944 wearing no rank insignia or distinguishing features of any kind on combat uniforms.\n\nWith the outbreak of war, clothing manufacturers across Finland geared up to supply the troops. By December of 1939 over 45 different clothing manufactures including the state owned uniform producers as well as private makers were involved in the contract production of uniforms, boots and great coats for the Finnish Army. Many members of the Lotta Svard organization also made uniforms from fabric, as well as snow suits, gloves and winter hats. By February of 1940 over 200,000 additional woollen tunics and a similar quantity of winter greatcoats had been produced as well as an astounding 350,000 new pairs of woolen trousers. This however met only around half the needs of the mobilized Finnish armed forces and did not include the more than 100,000 uniform-issues needed for foreign volunteers.\n\nThe part played by Australia and New Zealand\n\nSome immediate assistance was provided by Britain which, in late December 1939 shipped 100,000 British uniforms to Finland. These were generally issued to Cadets (the younger teenage Boy and Girl Soldiers) as in general they were too small for the average Finn. The brown colour was also easily mistaken for a Russian uniform. However, as we have seen, both New Zealand and Australia responded to the urgent Finnish requests for assistance – and for orders placed with textile and clothing manufacturers by the Finnish purchasing agents in Sydney. With funds available (and in the case of New Zealand, both a loan made available direct to the Finnish Government by the New Zealand Government to fund all textile and clothing purchases made in New Zealand) and guarantees of payment to New Zealand manufacturers signing orders with the Finnish Government, the response was immediate. Large stockpiles of wool existed in both countries (as has been mentioned) and both countries also had experienced workforces – still with some significant unemployment. With guaranteed payments and a bonus for rapid delivery, manufacturers in both countries responded quickly. By early January 1940, two of the first Finnish cargo ships to leave Australia (& New Zealand) were en-route, packed with uniforms, boots, donated clothing, textiles, canvas, leather and bales of raw wool for the Finnish textile industry.\n\nIn support of Finland, sheep farmers had donated bales of wool to the campaign, amounting to shiploads of raw wool. Fortunately, with the outbreak of the War and the mobilization of the Finnish Merchant Marine, there were large numbers of Finnish merchant ships that could be utilized and a number of these were sent to Australia (and New Zealand, which similarly could not provide much in the way of military material but could certainly provide raw wool – which the small Pacific country did, filling a number of cargo ships with donated bales from sheep stations all around the country). Australia in turn would in the end fill half a dozen Finnish cargo ships to capacity with bales of unprocessed wool – enough to fill warehouse after warehouse in Tampere and indeed, these shiploads together with a similar donation from Argentina would provide Finland with sufficient wool to last through the entire Winter War period.\n\nAustralian and New Zealand textile mills produced woollen cloth to the specifications needed for the various pieces of Finnish uniform issue – underclothing, trousers, shirts, tunics, great coats and hats. Australian and New Zealand clothing manufacturers worked day and night shirts to produced finished pieces of uniform clothing while the growing Finland Assistance organization in both countries form “knitting circles” to knit woolen sweaters and scarves and to hand-sew various other pieces of needed military-clothing. The manufacturers in both countries were modern, efficient and well-run – and the labour force was highly motivated both by the overtime pay offered and by the knowledge that they were providing tangible assistance to “gallant little Finland” as well as supporting their own volunteer troops on the way to fight in Finland alongside the Finns. In New Zealand, the encouragement and support offered to the Finland Assistance Organisation by both the highly popular Prime Minister, Michael Joseph Savage, and the Leader of the Opposition, Adam Hamilton, would also go a long way to ensuring support across the length and breadth of the country for anything related to the provision of assistance to Finland.\n\nImage sourced from: http://blog.greens.org.nz/wp-content/up ... e-1935.jpg\n\nMichael Joseph Savage (23 March 1872 – 27 March 1940) Labour Prime Minister of New Zealand at the start of the Winter War\n\nMichael Joseph Savage (23 March 1872 – 27 March 1940) was the first Labour Prime Minister of New Zealand. He is commonly known as the architect of the New Zealand welfare state and is consistently regarded as one of New Zealand's greatest and most revered Prime Ministers. He was given the title New Zealander of the Century by The New Zealand Herald in 1999. Born in Australia, Savage first became involved in politics while working in that state. He emigrated to New Zealand in 1907 at the age of 35. He worked in a variety of jobs, as a miner, flax-cutter and storeman, before becoming involved in the union movement. Savage initially opposed the formation of the 1910 New Zealand Labour Party as he viewed the grouping as insufficiently socialistic and instead he became the chairman of the New Zealand Federation of Labour, known as the \"Red Feds\". In the 1911 general election Savage unsuccessfully stood as the Socialist candidate for Auckland Central. During World War I he opposed conscription, arguing that the conscription of wealth should precede the conscription of men. After the war the voters of the Auckland West electorate put Savage into Parliament as a Labour member in the 1919 general election, an electorate that he held until his death. He in due course became the Labour Party leader in 1933 and helped engineer the Labour/Ratana (maori political party) alliance. During the Great Depression Savage toured the country and became an iconic figure. An excellent speaker, he became the most visible politician in New Zealand and led Labour to victory in the 1935 election. Along with the Premiership he appointed himself the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Maori Affairs. The first Labour government swiftly proved popular and easily won the 1938 general election with an increased popular mandate. Savage, suffering from cancer of the colon at the time, had delayed seeking treatment to participate in the election campaign.\n\nSavage led the country into World War II, officially declaring war on Nazi Germany on 3 September 1939, just hours after Britain. Unlike Australia, which felt obligated to declare war, New Zealand did so as a sign of allegiance to Britain, and in recognition of Britain's abandoning its former appeasement of the dictators, a policy that New Zealand had vehemently opposed. At first doubtful, Savage would come to strongly support the sending of New Zealand volunteers and assistance to Finland. Announcing the decision to send the first battalion of New Zealanders to Finland in December 1939, Prime Minister Savage declared (from his sickbed) that: “With confidence in the future we range ourselves without fear beside Finland in the struggle against totalitarianism wherever it may be found. Where Finland fights, we fight; where Finland stands, we stand. New Zealand, as with Finland, is only a small and young nation, but we march with a union of hearts and souls towards a common destiny.” Savage brought an almost religious fervour to his politics and wholeheartedly encouraged New Zealand support for Finland up until his death in March 1940. Savage become something of an iconic figure to the Left and his picture hung in many Labour supporters' homes decades after his death.\n\nSavage’s successor as Prime Minister, Peter Fraser, would maintain New Zealand’s policy of providing whatever support for Finland could be provided without weakening New Zealand’s contribution to the British Empire’s military strength. As Minister of Health, Fraser had been involved in the negotiations with the Finnish government that had led to New Zealand providing assistance to Finland in setting up the School Dental Program and had been supportive of providing assistance to Finland from the start. Another influencing factor had been Fraser’s opposition to Communism (although initially enthusiastic about the Russian October Revolution of 1917 and its Bolshevik leaders, he rejected them soon afterwards, and eventually became one of the strongest advocates of excluding communists completely from the New Zealand Labour Party).\n\nImage sourced from: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/c ... Fraser.jpg\n\nPeter Fraser ((28 August 1884 – 12 December 1950) would succeed Savage as Prime Minister of New Zealand in March 1940. Fraser would also maintain New Zealand’s support, such as it was, for Finland through the war years. As Minister for Foreign Affairs between 1942 and 1949, Fraser would also keep foreign affairs under his control as well as focusing almost exclusively on the war effort. Throughout WW2 Fraser was concerned with ensuring that New Zealand retained control over its own military forces. He believed that Britain viewed New Zealand's military as a mere extension of their own, rather than as the armed forces of a sovereign nation. After particularly serious New Zealand losses in the Greek campaign in 1941 (and comparing these to the successes of the Commonwealth Division in the Winter War under Finnish command), Fraser determined to retain a say as to where to deploy New Zealand troops and on how they were to be used. Fraser insisted to British leaders that Bernard Freyberg, commander of the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force, should report to the New Zealand government just as extensively as to the British authorities. When Japan entered the war, Fraser had to choose between recalling New Zealand's forces to the Pacific (as Australia had done) or keeping them in the Middle East (as Winston Churchill requested). Fraser eventually opted for the 2nd New Zealand Division to remain in the Middle East (the 1st Division was a Home Defence unit). In late 1943 Fraser would order the New Zealand 3rd Division formed and sent to Finland together with a number of RNZAF squadrons. The under-strength 3rd Division would include the Queen Alexandra's Mounted Rifles (QAMR), the New Zealand Army’s only armoured battalion and would fight alongside the Maavoimat until the end of the war.\n\nFraser had a very rocky relationship with U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull, particularly over the Canberra Pact and the dispatch of New Zealand troops to Finland. When Fraser visited Washington D.C. in mid-1944, Hull gave Fraser a sharp and rather demeaning dressing-down over New Zealand support for Finland and opposition to the Canberra Pact, which resulted in New Zealand's military becoming sidelined to some extent in the conduct of the Pacific War. It also resulted in New Zealand strongly supporting Finland and Poland’s position on the Baltic, Poland, East Prussia and northern Germany issues and on war-crime trials in the immediate post-WW2 timeframe. After the war ended, Fraser devoted much attention to the formation of the United Nations at the San Francisco conference (UNCIO) in 1945; this was the apogee of Fraser’s career. Noteworthy for his strong opposition (in conjunction with Finland and Poland) to vesting powers of veto in permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, he often spoke unofficially for smaller states. He earned the respect of many world statesmen through his commitment to principle, his energy, and most of all his skill as a chairman. With dwindling support from traditional Labour voters, and a population weary of war-time measures, Fraser's popularity declined. In the 1949 elections the National Party defeated his government and Fraser became Leader of the Opposition. He died on 12 December 1950.\n\nThe end result would be that by early January 1940, New Zealand and Australia had in combination produced large volumes of military uniform pieces – enough to make a significant difference in the quantity of uniforms available for issue in Finland after they arrived. In addition, very large numbers of leather and wool gloves, mittens, sweaters, scarves, hand-made woolen undershirts and white snow-suits had been made and packed for shipment. Significant quantities of other kit was also included, often based on Australian or New Zealand Army issue but made up to as closely as possible match Finnish Army specifications.\n\nOther items sent included medical kits, messkits, shaving kits, woollen hats (and with typical Aussie humour, even in the midst of a World War, large numbers of Australian “slouch” hats which would go on to be worn by many thousands of Finnish soldiers through the summer months of the Winter War as well as over 1944-45 in the fight against Germany).\n\nImage sourced from: http://www.kevos4.com/images/medical_kits.jpg\n\nMaavoimat Medical Kit: Volunteers in Australia and New Zealand would pack thousands of these medical kits, as closely as possible matching the Maavoimat specifications.\n\nImage sourced from: http://netti.nic.fi/~junkyard/IM000355.jpg\n\nIn the above is a Finnish pioneer with a British-style messkit attached to his back (close-up below – when I was in the New Zealand Army we still used these – and I still use my old one for hiking…. 30 years old and going fine)\n\nImage sourced from: http://netti.nic.fi/~junkyard/IM000323.jpg\n\nBritish-style messkit used by the Maavoimat. Messkits were another item that was in short supply – some 250,000 messkits were supplied by Britain, another 150,000 were shipped from Australia and New Zealand. Finland also managed to source 100,000 German style messkits from Germany and during the Winter War, many thousands of messkits were from Red Army units that had been destroyed were collected and re-issued. Over the early months of the Winter War however, improvisation was the name of the game.\n\nImage sourced from: http://www.kevos4.com/images/shaving_stuff.JPG\n\nFinnish Army shaving kit: Australian and New Zealand school children would put together thousands of these shaving kits for shipment to Finland – and many an Australian or New Zealand father would curse his children as he found essential shaving items missing…..

In the UK, there were large numbers of these stockpiled, and a request from the New Zealand Government would result in 250,000 entrenching tools being shipped to Finland direct from the UK early in the war. Together with captured Red Army entrenching tools and existing Maavoimat entrenching tools, this would go a long way to ensuring every soldier in the Maavoimat was equipped with this very useful tool.\n\nImage sourced from: http://www.grantsmilitaria.com/gall/pix/images/182.jpg\n\nFinnish machinegunner with a tool case and spare parts box on his belt (this case would hold some essential tools and spares to keep his machine gun operating). Behind this case he has tucked an entrenching tool. The entrenching tool can be used to either dig, or, using its sharpened edge, it can hack away small branches and twigs which may interfere with his selected machine gun site. Before the Winter War the Finnish Army seems to have used a rather complicated leather frame system, which went around the blade of the entrenching tool, for carrying them. But just before mobilisation in late 1939 a simple carrying strap with hook to attach to the belt was introduced. However, this had a considerable downside - carrying the entrenching tool with this hook-system was really uncomfortable and noisy - the entrenching tool hung loose at the soldiers side without cover of any kind. Stuffing the entrenching tool under the belt (as seen above) was suggested as alternative method - neither of these worked that well. As a result, during the Winter War Finnish troops had a tendency to discard their Maavoimat-issue entrenching tools. By contrast, the British entrenching tool, which broke down, was easier to carry and also had a canvas cover, was far more popular. As a direct result of these experiences, the Finnish company Fiskars would work with the Maavoimat to design a practical new folding entrenching tool which would be issued in 1942 and which all Finnish soldiers would carry through the fighting of 1944 and 1945.\n\nImage sourced from: http://www.gerbergear.com/var/gerber/st ... gerber.jpg\n\nThe new (m/43) Maavoimat entrenching tools were manufactured by the Finnish companies Fiskars and Savotta. Fiskars Oyj Ab was and is a metal and consumer brands company founded in 1649 at Fiskars Bruk (Finnish: Fiskarsin Ruukki) in the town of Raseborg, about 100 km west of Helsinki on the old main road from Turku to Viipuri. Fiskars is best known today for its scissors, axes and high-quality knives. Prior to and during WW2, Fiskars would design and develop the new-model entrenching tool as well as a fighting-knife developed by Gustaf Johannes Lindbergh, the founder of the Finnish military martial art, KKT (KäsiKähmäTaistelu) that would be issued to all Maavoimat soldiers\n\nImage sourced from: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/c ... _Knife.jpg\n\nThe Isotalo-Taistelut-Veitsi (“Isotalo Fighting Knife, so named in memory of Antti Isotalo, the famous Finnish knife-fighter) would be designed during the Spanish Civil War by Fiskars and Gustaf Johannes Lindbergh, the founder of the Finnish military martial art, KKT as a direct result of the use of Puukko knives by Maavoimat soldiers in hand to hand combat. Lindbergh would produce a knife specially designed to use in hand-to-hand combat and by late 1939, this was starting to be issued in large numbers. By the end of the Winter War, all Maavoimat combat soldiers would carry an Isotalo-Taistelut-Veitsi, as would most of the foreign volunteers in Finland.\n\nThe above is of course not all-inclusive, many other items found their way into the Aid shipments (such as very large quantities of blankets), but it is indicative of the types of material aid that were supplied to Finland for use by the military from two countries which had no significant armaments industry to speak of but which still did what they could to assist. However, with an approximate six to eight week timeframe for the journey by ship from New Zealand and Australia to Lyngenfjiord, and then additional time for off-loading and transport to Maavoimat depots and then transport to the troops at the front and issuing, it would not be until later in the winter that the first issues of these uniforms and uniform and kit items would occur. But by this time, manufacturing within Finland together with the large quantities of New Zealand and Australian made clothing would ensure that the Finnish military and the foreign volunteer units were adequately clothed in winter-issue uniforms – and the shiploads of raw wool from Australia, New Zealand and Argentina had served to replenish Finnish warehouses, ensuring that a large stockpile of wool, woolen fabrics, leather and canvas was available through the next one to two years – a stockpile that ongoing trade between Finland and Argentina together with sporadic shipments from Australia and New Zealand would see maintained over the war years.\n\nNext Post: the Australian-Finland Assistance Organisation, Australian politics, the formation and dispatch of the Australian Volunteer Units and the Australian commanders\n\nThe Australian-Finland Assistance Organisation, Australian politics, the formation and dispatch of the Australian Volunteer Units and the Australian commanders\n\nThe Australian-Finland Assistance Organisation\n\nWe have already seen the accomplishments of the Australian-Finland Assistance Organisation in the substantial volumes of food, material assistance and fund-raising that was generated by the many thousands of members of this Australian-wide organization that seemingly sprang into being overnight. We will also in the near future look at the political pressure that this Organisation exerted on the Australian Government such that a large group of volunteers was actively supported in their efforts to travel to Finland and fight. However, despite appearance, it was not the case that this Organisation sprang up spontaneously - the Organisation itself was the result of some solid prepatory groundwork which had taken place after the arrival in Sydney of the Valtioneuvoston Tiedotuskeskus team members but before the Winter War actually broke out.\n\nOne of the early steps taken by the Finnish Consul, Paavo Simelius, in mid-1939, after receiving the first official communications that all was not well, had been to gather together the Executive Board of the Finnish Society of Sydney at his home and review with them what could be done. There was very little that Simelius could do in the way of harnessing Australian political support for Finland – Finland itself was not an unknown quantity, but it was, as a country, by and large irrelevant to Australia and to Australian interests. Simelius certainly did his best, meeting with the Australian Minister of Foreign Affairs but receiving only a non-committal response. The small Australian-Finnish community began to do what little they could, largely through the raising of funds from Society activities. In addition, Nestori Karhula, a former officer in the Finnish Army began to put together a list of Australian Finns who would, if necessary, be willing, able and suitable to travel to Finland to join the Finnish Army. The Finnish Consulate in Sydney made a request to the Australian government to obtain the necessary permissions for collection of funds for Finland and in this they did receive an immediate affirmative answer, according to which the permit was issued for fund-raising for Finland “non-military purposes”. Consul Simelius had already, on being advised that the Valtioneuvoston Tiedotuskeskus Team was en-route, arranged for the rental of office space with the limited discretionary funding available and Pastor Hytönen was appointed office manager and delegated the task of setting up office facilities, assisted by Mrs. Mimmi Tuomi and a number of other volunteers.\n\nReal progress however began to be made with the arrival of the Valtioneuvoston Tiedotuskeskus team in Sydney in early November 1939. one of their first meetings had been with the Executive Board of the Finnish Society – which at this time consisted of James Aalto (Chairman), clearest Kari Vice Chairman, Johan Kaasalainen (Secretary), John Partanen (Deputy Secretary) and Vilho Pullinen (Treasurer). James Aalto later recounted how Consul Simelius called up each of the Board members and asked them to come to an urgent meeting at his home where they met the Valtioneuvoston Tiedotuskeskus team, who described what was at stake and what their plans consisted of. The members of the Board were astonished and pleased to meet again the Rev. Kurkiala, whom they knew well from earlier years. Members of the Board and Consul Simelius made numerous suggestions which the Team added in to their plans.\n\nThe objective of the Valtioneuvoston Tiedotuskeskus team was to establish multiple approaches to the gaining of assistance for Finland in the event of a war with the USSR – by garnering official Australian government support, gaining wide-spread popular support via the news media, raising substantial funds through private and public fund-raising, gaining approval for the purchase of military and non-military materials and lastly to, if possible, negotiate the dispatch of Australian volunteers to assist in the war that was looking more and more likely. In all of these approaches, it would be necessary to both establish a close relationship with Australian politicians the government and also to move well beyond the small Finnish Society and tap into mainstream Australia – to reach out to the man and woman in the street and involve them in Finland’s struggle at many levels. That this was done so successfully, and in so many countries around the world, speaks highly of the abilities of the men and women of the Valtioneuvoston Tiedotuskeskus teams who were plucked from their day-to-day lives in Finland and dispatched around the world – and for many of these men and women, it would be their first trip outside of Finland. Finland would own much to the way in which these men and women persevered and succeeded so admirably.\n\nImage sourced from: http://www.uktshome.com/images/photos/h ... 3thumb.jpg\n\nOne of the first acts of the Sydney Valtioneuvoston Tiedotuskeskus Team – a dinner with the Finnish Society of Sydney where the Team introduced themselves and briefed the local Finnish community on their mission if the war that was expected actually broke out….early November 1939\n\nIn all of this, it was first necessary to secure the whole-hearted support of the local Finnish community as these would be the men and women on whom the small Valtioneuvoston Tiedotuskeskus Team would rely on for much of the drudgery – the answering of phones, mailing of letters, all the day to day administrative work that would be necessary. Meanwhile the new Finnish Consul, Paavo Simelius had been working non-stop to secure introductions for the 20 man Valtioneuvoston Tiedotuskeskus Team, some of whom were in turn working furiously with Australian journalists and advertising companies to put out material supportive of Finland. Elsewhere, members of the team, including the Rev. Kurkiala and Jorma Pohjanpalo were establishing their own contacts in the religious, political and business fields. Simelius had been successful in securing an appointment with the Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, in mid-November 1939. Menzies was non-committal at this time, advising Simelius that if Finland was attacked, there would be little that Australia could do beyond providing moral support. However, Simelius did gain permission for the small Purchasing Team to place orders with Australian manufacturers for non-weapons related orders such as clothing and food. In addition, Simelius gained Menzie’s blessing for a “large” fund-raising and publicity campaign to support Finland in the event of a war with the USSR. These approvals were communicated officially and in writing to the Finnish Consulate in Sydney from the Prime Minister’s Office.\n\nFor Simelius and the Valtioneuvoston Tiedotuskeskus Team this was a major coup. They had the approvals they needed and much of the legwork had already been done. Orders were placed immediately with a number of manufacturers and stock agents, the results of which we have already covered. With regards to a “large” fund-raising and publicity campaign to support Finland in the event of a war with the USSR, the Valtioneuvoston Tiedotuskeskus Team and the Re. Kurkiala had already done much legwork prior to securing approval from the Government. Chief among their accomplishments had been the preparatory work needed to set up a viable and effective “Assistance” Organisation. In this, the Rev. Kurkiala had achieved a notable success in securing the wholehearted commitment of a well-known Australian politician and organizer, Colonel Eric Campbell, while Consul Simelius had been in discussions with Dr. Lewis Windermere Nott, an Australian Dr., politician and, in 1939, a Member of the Council administering the Australian Capital Territory (within which Canberra is located). Colonel Eric Campbell, Dr Lewis Windermere Nott and the Rev. Kurkiala would, on 1 December 1939, become the joint Founders of the Australian Finland Assistance Organisation. Before we delve into the Australian Finland Assistance Organisation, a quick look at these two Australians is in order.\n\nDr Lewis Windermere Nott\n\nLewis Windermere Nott (12 February 1886 – 27 October 1951) was an Australian politician, medical practitioner and hospital superintendent. He was born at Windermere, a sugar-plantation located near Bundaberg in Queensland and was educated at Maryborough Grammar School, after which he studied assaying at the School of Mines and Industries, Ballarat, Victoria. He subsequently completed a medical degree at the University of Sydney. In 1913, he married Doris Ashbury in Sydney. The newly-wed couple travelled to Scotland where he continued studying medicine at the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, and the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow. At the outbreak of World War One he enlisted in the Royal Scots as a Captain and was made adjutant. In 1916 he was wounded and twice mentioned in dispatches. His affectionate letters to his wife, describing conditions in the field, were edited by his son David and published as “Somewhere in France” (Sydney, 1996). He then resigned his commission and resumed his medical training in December 1916. On graduation in 1918 he joined the Royal Army Medical Corps.\n\nImage sourced from: https://www.brotherhoodbooks.org.au/Boo ... 256678.jpg\n\n“Somewhere in France – The Collected Letters of Lewis Windermere Nott” by David Nott\n\nNott returned to Australia, took part in the campaign against hookworm and was then appointed medical superintendent of the Mackay District Hospital. From 1924 to 1927 he was Mayor of Mackay. In 1925 he won a seat in the Australian Federal Parliament for the Nationalist Party after unexpectedly defeating the Australian Labor Party candidate Ted Theodore, who had resigned as Premier of Queensland in order to enter federal politics. In 1928 Nott lost the seat to the Labor candidate, after which he ran unsuccessfully in North Sydney (1929) and Calare (1934). Nott moved to Canberra in 1927, the year that it became the national capital. In 1929 he was appointed Medical Superintendent of the Canberra Hospital and held this position until 1934 and again from 1941 to 1949. He campaigned for the creation of an advisory council for the Federal Capital Territory (in 1938 renamed the Australian Capital Territory, ACT) and was elected as a member of the council from 1935 to 1949.\n\nImage sourced from: http://www.mackayhistory.org/research/m ... 1_nott.jpg\n\nDr Lewis Windermere Nott\n\nWhen approached by Consul Simelius, Dr. was immediately sympathetic to the Finnish cause and agreed to take a leading role in the Australia-Finland Assistance Organisation. An inveterate politician, he was a well-known figure in Australia and an effective and fiery public speaker. His credentials as both a soldier and a Doctor were impeccable. From the start, Dr. Nott would take a leading role in the Australia-Finland Assistance Organisation and would also, as a medical practitioner and former soldier, organize a field hospital for the Commonwealth Division. Immediately on agreeing to co-found the Organisation, Nott wrote a series of letters to the Prime Minister, Australian politicians, Branches of the Nationalist Party, numerous Australian organizations such as the Country Womens Association, the Returned Services League and others and to the daily press advising them of the upcoming establishment of the Organisation, its intentions and asking for their support.\n\nImage sourced from: http://matthewleecunningham.files.wordp ... p-1931.jpg\n\nThe inaugural meeting of the Australian Finland Assistance Organization in Sydney on the 3rd of December 1939 was packed to capacity.\n\nTwo days after the USSR attacked Finland, the Australia-Finland Assistance Organisation held its inaugural meeting in Sydney. The Hall selected was packed to capacity, with Dr. Nott receiving a standing ovation to his speech, which along with others was reported in full in newspapers across Australian on the morning of the 4th of December 1939. Accompanying the reports on the meeting was an open plea from Dr. Nott to the Government for the whether the Prime Minister to give his imprimatur to a voluntary ambulance unit and field hospital to be dispatched to Finland immediately. There were, Nott said, many professional men like himself, who though medically fit, and with excellent civil and military records, were not allowed to go overseas with the second A.I.F. (Australian Imperial Forces). Nott pointed out that Australia’s fate was inextricably bound up with that of Finland, and Finland’s “gallant resistance” was an inspiration to democracy at its intelligent best. There was, Nott repeated, not one obstacle in the path of staffing the Unit at once, but the question of transport, stores and upkeep was the major consideration and Nott could only visualize the unit succeeding over an extended period of time by a combination of government and voluntary assistance. Nott and the organization were almost immediately inundated by an overwhelming response from surgeons, specialists, dentists and nurses from all states, even as far afield as North Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia.\n\nLeaving aside for a moment the success of the Australia-Finland Assistance Organisation, Nott would be appointed to command the Medical Units made up of volunteers that Australia would dispatch to Finland. As the volunteers grew into what would be the Commonwealth Division, Dr. Nott was appointed to command of the Divisional medical units, a command position he would accept and hold until the end of the Winter War, after which he would return to Australia and his former positions as Medical Superintendant and Councilor. In Finland, Dr. Nott was instrumental in introducing mobile medical units along the lines developed by the Canadiuan Dr. Norman Bethune in the Spanish Civil War. A frequent cause of death on the battlefield is medical shock brought on by loss of blood. A casualty whose wounds do not appear life-threatening suddenly dies. Bethune had conceived the idea of administering blood transfusions on the spot and developed the world's first mobile medical unit. The unit contained dressings for 500 wounds, and enough supplies, medicine and equipment for 100 battlefield emergency operations. Bethune organized a service to collect blood from donors and deliver it to the battlefront, thereby saving countless lives. Nott introduced similar units, Mobile Battalion Aid Stations, to Finland, designed to get experienced personnel closer to the front, so that the wounded could be treated sooner and with greater success.\n\nThe system that Dr. Nott designed was based on immediate aid from a unit medic, after which the casualty was routed to a near-frontline Battalion Aid Station for emergency stabilizing surgery, after which the casualty was evacuated to a Field Hospital for more extensive treatment. This proved to be highly successful and as these innovations percolated outwards through the Maavoimat medical units, during the last months of the Winter War, a seriously wounded soldier who made it to a Battalion Aid Station alive had a greater than 87% chance of survival once he received treatment. The ability of the Battalion Aid Station’s (and in some cases even Company Medics) to perform immediate blood transfusions on the spot proved of perhaps the most benefit – where blood transfusions could be administered on the frontline within minutes, survivability increased to 97% where the casualty was wounded rather than killed outright. This had a significant impact on morale – knowing that if one was wounded, one stood a high chance of surviving made a great deal of difference to the individual soldier’s mindset in combat.\n\nImage sourced from: http://www.ww2incolor.com/d/256765-4/10th+field\n\nA group of Army Nurses of the Commonwealth Division Field Hospital (400-bed capacity, commanded by Lt-Col. Dr. Lewis W. Nott) posing in front of a US-supplied 1/4-Ton Truck. The Field Hospital arrived in Finland with the Australian volunteers and would remain until November 1940, before transferring to the UK and then to the Middle East. Note that by later summer 1940, when this photo was taken, the Australian Nurses are wearing military-style trousers and shirts. This was another innovation introduced by Dr. Nott for practical reasons – working as nurses in the field, wearing military-style trousers and shirts for women proved to be a significant benefit. Although this was a change that would percolate only slowly, by 1944 some Maavoimat medical units would make similar changes, issuing military-style trousers and shirts to Lotta’s.\n\nIn 1949, Nott was elected as an independent as the first representative of the Division of Australian Capital Territory in the Federal Parliament, where he had unlimited speaking rights but could only vote on matters affecting the ACT. He was one of only five people who have represented more than one state or territory in the House of Representatives, and the only one to represent both a state and a territory. He was defeated by the Labor candidate Jim Fraser in the 1951 election. He was subsequently appointed as a medical officer in Victoria, but collapsed on the flight to Melbourne and died the next day of leukemia in the Royal Melbourne Hospital. Nott is buried in the Presbyterian Section of the Woden Cemetery, Canberra.\n\nDr. Nott’s funeral was no simple family ceremony. Representatives of almost every phase of his life paid their last respects at an impressive funeral service at St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church in Canberra. Members of practically all public bodies in the A.C.T. attended, crowding into the main church and the Warriors Chapel, the nave and overflowing outside, where approximately 200 persons listened to the service through amplifiers. The President of the Senate, Senator E. W. Mattner, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr. A. G. Cameron and the Minister for the Interior, Mr. W. S. Kent Hughes, who represented the Prime Minister, were present. The Opposition was represented by Messrs. A. A. Calwell and J. R. Fraser. Among many members of Parliament present were Mr. W. M. Hughes, whom Dr. Nott opposed in the 1929 election for North Sydney, and Senator W. J. Cooper. Both were members of Parliament from 1925 to 1928, when Dr. Nott was member for Herbert. Members of the diplomatic corps who attended included the High Commissioner for Ceylon, Mr. J. Aubrey Martensz, the Minister for Ireland, Dr. T. J. Kiernan, Mr. J. A. M. Marjoribanks, representing the Acting U.K. High Commissioner, Mr. Paavo Simelius, the Consul for Finland and Mrs. N. M. Lifanov, wife of the Soviet Ambassador.\n\nMany of the congregation had taken their seats in the church almost an hour before the service was to begin.A large detachment of police attended the funeral. The church was almost full when Mrs. Nott arrived and, assisted by her son and daughters, placed a wreath of red roses at the head of the raised flag-draped oak casket. Wreaths from many other organisations lay at its foot. Mrs. Nott was obviously under great strain, but carried herself bravely. Among family mourners were the deceased's cousins, Messrs. L. G. Priestley and R. G. Norris from Sydney. The service opened with a hymn of the family's selection \"Onward Christian Soldiers.\" The service was conducted by the Rev. Hector Harrison.\n\nIn his panegyric, the Rev. Mr. Harrison said: \"As we gather here this afternoon to pay our tribute of respect to the memory of Lewis Windermere Nott, there is common to each one of us a very real and unaffected sense of personal sorrow. And that sorrow is shared to the humblest in this fair city, by all classes, from the highest. During this past week we knew that we were losing a public figure who had brought much colour into the civic life of Canberra, and the best wishes of their many friends followed Dr. and Mrs Nott as they left us to live in Yallourn. But not for one moment did anyone dream that the city's loss would deepen into grief through his untimely death. The shock of the dread news shivered through the community over the week-end in a manner which left many stunned and incredulous at the thought of this buoyant spirit being laid low in death. There is a saying that God sometimes makes a man and then breaks the mould, so that the world never looks upon his like again. Many of us feel that the mould was broken when Dr. Nott was born. We cannot imagine another such as he appearing on the platform of public life in Canberra.\n\nTo-day the wells of memory are stirred to their very depths as hundreds think of Dr. Nott's life and work. There are some here today whose minds hark back to the grim, grey days of the depression years, when the Doctor was one of a group who battled to keep hope alive in the hearts of the despairing and who helped men, women and children with means of subsistence in the hour of their dire need. Others will remember the long fight that he waged for the representation of the Australian National Territory in Federal Parliament and of the reward which came to him when he took his seat as the first elected member for the Territory. The memories of a great many more will fly back to the years when the Doctor gave added medicine of a merry heart to the prescribed treatment at the Canberra Community Hospital. And the aged will recall his continued advocacy for Eventide Homes to lighten the passage of their years.\n\nFurther, hundreds of ex-servicemen will remember that there was one who understood them, because he too had lived and fought and suffered wounds amid the mud, blood and misery of those terrible Flander's fields in the First World War as well as on the battlefields of Finland at the height of the Winter War, where he was instrumental in bringing aid and succor to the soldiers of Australia and of Finland. Dr. Nott touched life at so many points that one can only mention a few of his interests. In Parliament, on the Advisory Council, in the Returned Servicemen's League and the Legacy Club, as founder of the Australia-Finland Assistance Organization, as a patron of the arts, and a lover of animals, his was an abounding life. All barriers of class or creed fell when he was about, and even those who oppos- ed him in public life were quick to appreciate his good humour, ready wit and warm fellowship, for his heart was too big to allow differences to divide.\n\nSo he laboured on for the good of all to the very end. His only hate was a deep-rooted hatred of injustice, and his was a voice that was heard whenever Canberra residents desired to ventilate any grievance. But kindness, sympathy and gener- osity flowed from his colourful personality and radiated goodwill wherever he went. And the background of his public life was an ideal home where he could be rested and refreshed for the work he loved. To Mrs Nott, who shared in so many of the Doctor's good works and to the members of the family we offer our deep sympathy and pray that the peace of God may abide in their hearts. So, in the ever-shadowing mystery of death, Lewis Windermere Nott has been taken. His name is written in the hearts of the people as well as on the records of the State. We give thanks for that best portion of a good man's life, his little, nameless, unremembered acts of kindness and of love. We pray that others may follow the example of the one whose body we shall soon commit to the ground, and whose soul we commend to Him who gave it birth.\"\n\nThe service concluded with the hymn \"Be Still My Soul.\"\n\nIn an atmosphere intensified by the solemn Funeral March by Chopin, the pall-bearers bore the casket from the church, followed by the relatives of the deceased and official representatives. Preceded by three police motor cyclists and a floral float loaded with beautiful wreaths, the cortege started for the cemetery. The slow-moving procession was approximately one and a half miles long, the last vehicles leaving the church as the hearse passed the Prime Minister's Lodge. It took the vehicles almost 20 minutes to pass a given point. At every street intersection, onlookers stood in silent reverence as the hearse passed. Windows at West Block and at Legations along State Circle were filled with spectators. A number of motorists who did not attend the church service joined the cortege. Mrs Nott did not attend the graveside ceremony, at which approximately 500 persons were present. Ex-servicemen who had served with Dr. Nott in WW1 and in the Winter War in Finland marched in front of the hearse to the site. The acting president of the A.C.T. branch of the R.S.L. (Mr. H. Preston-Stanley) paid a short tribute to the work of the deceased in the Canberra community, following which the Finnish Consul, Mr. Paavo Simelius, paid a short tribute to Dr. Nott’s contribution to the freedom of Finland.\n\nAs the service concluded with \"The Last Post\" and \"Reveille,\" played by Corporal N. Rundell, ex-servicemen comrades cast their Poppies of Remembrance into the grave, and the many dozens of wreaths were placed in position. They included wreaths from the Administrator, Sir John Northcott, the Deputy Prime Minister and Lady Fadden, from the Government and Army of Finland and from members of the diplomatic corps. Together with dozens of wreaths from private families or individuals, were floral tributes from the Commonwealth Government, the President, members and officers of the Senate, from the County of Cumberland Kennel Association, the Goulburn Kennel Asosciation, the Victoria League in Canberra, the Canberra Ambulance Station, the Greek Community, the Transport Section of the Department of the Interior, the staff of the Parliamentary Refreshment Rooms, the Trades and Labour Council, the Canberra Technical College, Canberra Legacy Club and the Women's Auxiliary, R.S.L. sub-branches in Canberra and Queanbeyan, the Canberra Hospital Auxiliary, the domestic staff of the Canberra Hospital, the Canberra Services Club, the Canberra Workmen's Club, the Canberra Community Hospital Board, the Canberra Highland Society and Burns Club, the A.C.T. Advisory Council, the Liberal Party, the Legion of Ex-servicemen, the Ex-Navalmen's Association, the Australia-Finland War Veterans Association, the Management and staff of 2CA, the Airforce Association, the nursing staff of the Canberra Community Hospital, the Canberra Guild of Archers, the staff of Hotel Kingston, the A.C.T. branch of the R.S.L., the Police Association, \"The Canberra Times,\" the A.C.T. division of the Australian Red Cross and many other organisations.\n\nNext Post: Colonel Eric Campbell\n\nThe Australia-Finland Assistance Organisation\n\nThe Australia-Finland Assistance Organisation\n\nOn the 30th of November, 1939, the Soviet Union attacked Finland with no declaration of war. The Valtioneuvoston Tiedotuskeskus team in Sydney had been warned that this was probable and was well prepared, with contacts in the Australian news media by now well established and background information prepared. Immediately the Soviet attacks commenced, telegrams to Valtioneuvoston Tiedotuskeskus teams around the world were dispatched, instructing them to initiate the plans that had been prepared for this eventuality. Short of any news on the Phony War, the Australian news media splashed the new of the Soviet attack on Finland across the front pages. Along with the front page headlines were a continuous stream of background articles filling the newspapers, describing Finland, setting out the situation, providing a background to the unprovoked attack on a small neutral country which wished only to remain at peace, suggesting ways in which Australians could assist Finland. The immediate Australian public reaction was one of indignation and condemnation of the USSR’s actions. Editorials stridently critical of the USSR blazed across every newspaper in the country. Well-prepared and prominent supporters of Finland spoke on the radio and seemingly overnight, the Australian Finland Assistance Organisation emerged, announced on the 3rd of December 1939 at a packed public meeting in Sydney where the prominent speakers included the joint founders (whom we will cover in the next Post), Dr Lewis Windermere Nott and Colonel Eric Campbell together with the Rev. Kalervo Kurkiala.\n\nImage sourced from: http://matthewleecunningham.files.wordp ... p-1931.jpg\n\nThe inaugural meeting of the Australian Finland Assistance Organization in Sydney on the 3rd of December 1939 was packed to capacity.\n\nDr Lewis Windermere Nott and Colonel Eric Campbell had laid the foundations for the Australia-Finland Assistance Organisation well. The day that the war broke out, letters and telegrams began to pour out of the Sydney Office asking those who had indicated their willingness to help to start work immediately whilst newspaper articles nationwide reported the founding of the Organisation and provided contact details for those who wished to setup branches or to join. Within days, branches of the Australian Finland Assistance Organization had been established across Australia, with offices prominently positioned in main streets. Churches, factories, schools, Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia Halls, the Australian Country Women’s Association, the Australian Red Cross, all were pressed into service as popular enthusiasm led to the organisation’s membership soaring into the thousands within days and into the tens of thousands within a fortnight. Fund-raising activities commenced almost immediately, with Churchs taking up Collections for Finland, street corner collectors in the cities and large towns, collections in the factory and the office, fund-raising fetes and, on a larger scale, requests to businesses for donations. Within days, thousands of pounds had been collected, within weeks, tens of thousands as the Australian public responded to the call. By mid-December 1939, it seemed that a large percentage of the Australian population were involved in the campaign to support Finland. It was a cause that stirred enthusiasm in the public, far more so than the war with Germany. And this enthusiasm was in large part the result of the skilful and ongoing distribution of information, news articles and commentary provided by the Valtioneuvoston Tiedotuskeskus team.\n\nImage sourced from: http://www.officemuseum.com/1932_Clerks ... ngland.jpg\n\nThe Head Office of the Australian Finland Assistance Organization was staffed by Volunteers and was a large and meticulously organized hive of industry. The Sydney Finnish community played a large part in the initial establishment of the Office but were soon joined by hundreds of Australian volunteers eager to help the cause of Finland as the Australia-Finland Assistance Organisation rapidly became an “Australia-wide” organization. The small Finnish community would continue to play a strong supportive role in the Organisation in Sydney, working in the Organisation’s Head Office performing the mundane administrative work that any such Organisation needs carried out efficiently in order to be successful.\n\nTwo Australian organizations were perhaps the most instrumental in the rapid expansion of support for the Australia-Finland Assistance Organization. These were the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia and the Country Women’s Association of Australia, both large and well-organised groups with memberships of well over one hundred thousand and with branches in every city, town and small rural farming community in Australia. Both were also fairly conservative patriotic organizations in all the best senses of the words.\n\nImage sourced from: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/c ... _Wagga.jpg\n\nRSL sub-branch club-rooms in Wagga-Wagga: The Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia was founded in 1916 and had originally been established out of concern for the welfare of soldiers who had served in the military in WW1. As well as arguing for veterans' benefits, it entered other areas of political debate and was very much politically conservative, with members supporting the British Empire and the King. In most areas of Australia, sub-branches of the League established clubrooms where war veterans could meet and socialise with their old comrades, with the land for the club buildings often donated by the various State governments. The Clubs were generally run on commercial principles and served alcohol and food. They were highly popular with veterans of WW1. From 1938 on, the RSL began to operate retirement homes for the care of aged veterans. Many RSL members, particularly those who had been officers, had also been members of the New Guard and as such, Colonel Campbell was able to recruit the support of RSL branches and sub-branches across Australia to the support of the Australia-Finland Assistance Organisation.\n\nIn working to gain the support of the RSL, Valtioneuvoston Tiedotuskeskus would constantly highlight that Finns and Finnish-Australians had fought and died for Australia in WW1 out of selfless patriotism and loyalty to their adopted country. And now, when Finland was in need, Finnish Australians were rallying to support their old homeland, and asking for the support of all Australians to help their country remain free from Soviet tyranny – and the Soviet Union was the ally and friend of Nazi Germany, with whom Australia was officially at war. Stalin and Hitler were described as but two faces of the same totalitarian enemy whom free peoples around the world were fighting. Much was also made of the way in which Germany under Hitler and the USSR under Stalin had jointly attacked Poland – and now, while Germany attacked Britain, the USSR was attacking Finland. As a returned Finnish-Australian WW1 veteran, Niilo Kara would find himself speaking at fund-raising events throughout New South Wales in support of Finland.\n\nPihlajaveteläinen Niilo Kara osallistui vapaaehtoisena ensimmäiseen maailmansotaan Australian joukoissa haavoittuen rintamalla.

Kuva Siirtolaisinstituutti, Turku / Niilo Kara fought in the First World War as a volunteer in the Australian Army, where he was wounded at the front. After recovering, he returned to Australia and was for some time a station hand (a “station” in the Aussie and Kiwi vernacular is a very large sheep or cattle farm).

Rural Australian in the early 1920’s was a large area, and rural women often lived lives of isolation, with an appalling lack of health facilities. The Country Women's Association was formed in both New South Wales and Queensland in 1922 by women who had to watch helplessly as their children died from minor illnesses. These women realised they had nowhere to turn but to themselves - and the result was staggering. Within a year, the Association was a unified, resourceful group that was going from strength to strength. The members worked tirelessly to set up baby health care centres, fund “bush nurses”, build and staff maternity wards, hospitals, schools, rest homes, seaside and mountain holiday cottages - and much more. At the same time they continued to run homes in which they were often mother, nurse, teacher and general hand. The women of the CWA, while believing deeply that their role in the family was vitally important, provided social activities and educational, recreational and medical facilities. The CWA expanded into South Australia in 1929 and by 1936 there was a branch in each of the States and Territories of Australia. During the depression years, the CWA helped those in need with food and clothing parcels. In the late 1930’s, as now, it was the largest women’s organisation in Australia.\n\nWhile Australian newspapers wrote in glowing terms of Finnish bravery as Finland defended itself against the attacker from the East, Australian Finns worked to support their Fatherland. Much had been made in the Australian newspapers of the Lotta Svärd organization and how they supported the Army and the war effort in Finland. In Sydney, Miss Aino Potinkaraa publicly opened a Sydney branch of the Lotta Svärd on the 4th of December and in an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald, spoke about the 30 Finnish women who met every night to knit woollen clothes for the Finnish soldiers and Finnish children. The news article sparked off a flood of inquiries about establishing similar clubs which were responded to quickly, the net result being similar groups under the aegis of the Australian Country Women’s Association being established across Australia, with the results that we have seen in an earlier post. Within days, Miss Aino Potinkaraa found herself the very public figurehead of the Australian Lotta Svärd, travelling around Australia making speeches at CWA branches, in Churches and at Schools, advising as to how women and schoolchildren could help Finland.\n\nSimilarly, the Rev. Kalervo Kurkiala, as a Lutheran minister, would speak at both Protestant and Catholic Churches throughout Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. The Australian Catholic Church was large (in pre-WW2 Australia, Irish Catholics and the descendants of Irish Catholics made up a significant part of the country’s population), influential and was stridently anti-Communist, with the Spanish Civil War having magnified Australian Catholic fears that the Communist menace would spread across Europe. The Soviet attack on Finland served only as an illustration that these fears were well-founded, albeit Finland was a Lutheran Protestant country rather than a Catholic country. Still, this made little difference to Australian Catholics and the Catholic Church were firmly and whole-heartedly supportive of Finland and of the Australia-Finland Assistance Organisation. The Australian Catholic Church would also throw their political weight behind the increasingly vocal campaign to send Australian volunteers to Finland. A widely circulated newspaper, the “Catholic Worker”, edited by Bartholomew Augustine Santamaria, played a prominent part in Catholic support for Finland.\n\nImage sourced from: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/c ... a_1943.jpg\n\nCatholic Archbishop of Adelaide Matthew Beovich with B. A. Santamaria at the first Catholic Action Youth rally in support of Finland, mid-December 1939. Archbishop Daniel Mannix, the acknowledged leader of the Australian-Irish community, was also a close friend and supporter of Santamaria’s.\n\nBartholomew Augustine Santamaria (14 August 1915 - 25 February 1998), known as Bob Santamaria, was an Australian political activist and journalist. A highly divisive figure, with strongly held anti-Communist views, Santamaria inspired great devotion from his followers and intense hatred from his enemies. Santamaria was a political activist from an early age, becoming a leading Catholic student activist and speaking in support of Franco's forces in the Spanish Civil War. He also was a strong supporter and wrote about Mussolini's regime in Italy, but denied that he had ever been a supporter of fascism. He always disliked and opposed Hitler and Nazism. He attributed Mussolini's alliance with Hitler to the failed policies of Anthony Eden and expressed regret that Mussolini aligned himself with Hitler. In 1936 Santamaria was one of the founders of the Catholic Worker newspaper and was the first editor of the paper which declared itself opposed to both Communism and Capitalism. In 1937, at the invitation of Archbishop Daniel Mannix, he joined the National Secretariat of Catholic Action, a lay Catholic organisation. Santamaria was also close to many influential Catholic Labour Party politicians, including Arthur Calwell and James Scullin (who would go on to become Labour Party Prime Minister). Bob Santamaria would strongly support the work of the Australia-Finland Assistance Organisation and would be a leading member and speaker for the Organisation throughout the Winter War and for that matter, through WW2.\n\nDuring WW2he would found the Catholic Social Studies Movement, which recruited Catholic activists to oppose the spread of Communism, particularly in the trade unions. The movement gained control of many unions and brought him into conflict with many left-wing Labor Party members, who favoured a united front with the Communists during the war. During the 1930s and 1940s Santamaria generally supported the conservative Catholic wing of the Labor Party, but as the Cold War developed after 1945 his anti-Communism drove him further away from Labor. In 1954 H V Evatt, leader of the Labour Party, publicly blamed Santamaria for Labor's defeat in that year's federal election, and his parliamentary followers were expelled from the Labor Party. The resulting split brought down the Labor government in Victoria. During the 1960s and 1970s Santamaria regularly warned of the dangers of communism in Southeast Asia, and supported the United States in the Vietnam War.His political role gradually declined. But his personal stature continued to grow through his regular column in The Australian newspaper and his regular television spot, Point of View (he was given free air time by Sir Frank Packer, owner of the Nine Network). A skilled journalist and broadcaster, he was one of the most articulate voices of Australian conservatism for more than 20 years and was greatly admired by conservative politicians. Santamaria had the satisfaction of living to see the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\nMany fund-raising events took place through December 1939 and January 1940. One of the more notables was a series of concerts organized by the Sydney Symphony Orchestra in conjunction with the Australian Broadcasting Company. The guest conductor was Georg Schnéevoigt (8 November 1872 – 28 November 1947), a Finnish musician and conductor who was also a close friend of the great Finnish composer Jean Sibelius. The first concert of the series was graced by the presence of the Governor of NSW, John de Vere Loder, 2nd Baronet Wakehurst and his wife. The program began with the playing of Finland's national anthem, followed by Sibelius' Symphony No. 1 E Minor, Opus 39 and after the interval, the Karelian Rhapsody, Palmgren’s \"Pastorale\" and Sibelius's Suite \"Walse Triste\" and finally, Finlandia.\n\nImage sourced from: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/c ... evoigt.jpg\n\nGuest Conductor Georg Schnéevoigt, a close friend of the great Finnish composer Jean Sibelius.\n\nThe wife of the Finnish Consul, Mrs. Simelius, also took on a public role with the organization, herself managing the group within Head Office that organized the collection of clothing donations from the Australian people. The volume of clothing collected in this way was large, and the logistical management task was substantial, with large volumes of winter clothing collected or made by volunteers of the CWA being transported by the Australian railways from all around Australia to warehouses in Melbourne from where large groups of volunteers further assisted in sorting and packing for shipment. In addition to funds collected by local branches of the Australia-Finland Asssistance Organisation, donations also poured in to the Head Office in Sydney, with hundreds, and then thousands, of letters arriving daily. All had to be opened, read, donations collected and replies written and posted. Perhaps fortunately, the Australian Post Office, on the instructions of the Postmaster-General, provided postage free of charge to the organization for both incoming and outgoing mail.\n\nExamples included a lady who wrote to the Sydney Morning Herald urging donations to the Organisation’s funds and as an example to others, she sent in £200 to help Finland. A Sydney suburban school sent a letter that read in part: \"We're just little kids, and we do not have a lot of money, but we hope that the 10 shillings we have sent will help to buy bandages for small Finnish children who have been injured.” At the same time, the Australian Government announced it was donating £10 000 to the Finnish Red Cross as a starting point and would match all privately donated monies sent in to the Organisation. The administration of the Australia-Finland Asssistance Organisation’s accounts were entrusted to Sir John Peden, a noted Barrister, Professor of Law and President of the NSW Legislative Council (the Upper House of the New South Wales Parliament, the President of which was the equivalent of the Speaker in the Lower House) from 1929 to 1946 as well as to Lady Kater (appointed as Secretary) and Mr. R. S. Maynard, Treasurer. In all, the Australian-Finland Assistance Organisation raised funds of slightly more than £1,400,000 (more than 200,000,000 Finnish marks) from public donations. This was of course in addition to donations in kind of food, clothing and the numerous bales of war wool which Australian farmers donated and was matched by the Australian Government. It was a magnificent fund-raising effort for a small country as far removed from Finland as it was possible to be.\n\nAustralian Politics and the dispatch of the Australian Volunteers\n\nIn Australia, as elsewhere, public opinion had been aroused by the appeal of the Finnish government to the League of Nations for assistance against Soviet aggression, and the subsequent resolution of the Assembly which called upon every member to furnish Finland with all possible material and humanitarian assistance. Typical of the Australian public response was that of a woman in Sydney who signed her letter on December 6th 1939 to the daily newspaper, the Sydney Morning Herald, as “Woman Sympathiser.” She wrote that she had been waiting in vain for some public figure in the Government in Australia to take the lead in standing beside New Zealand in sending help to the heroic Finns. Recognising that it was hard for Australians, in their isolation and with their deep rooted sense of security, to visualize the epic struggle, the woman argued that the Finns were fighting not only for their homes and liberties but for Australia’s as well. Her letter garnered much support and many supporters wrote in a similar vein. Despite this support, the Menzies Government remained non-committal. The Government’s military advisors did not think that the Finnish Army could hold out against the might of the Red Army and advised the Government that the war would be over before any Volunteers from Australia could reach Finland.\n\nHowever, the news reports from Finland on the fight the Finnish Army was putting up, the large casualties being inflicted on the invading Russians, the early Finnish victories, all fed a demand to send volunteers that was carefully and discretely fanned by the Valtioneuvoston Tiedotuskeskus team. And it wasn’t hard to fan - opinion from the countryside and from the influential Returned Servicemens :eagure was best illustrated by the vitriolic abuse hurled at the Soviet Union by the weekly Bulletin, where the bush ethos and the radical tradition were still served by the pen of Norman Lindsay. The Catholic Worker, edited by Bob Santamaria, we perhaps not as vitriolic but was certainly equally strident in it’s call for the dispatch of Volunteers. Within the pages of the media, there was little opposition to the calls to support Finland. The main opposition to these calls would come only from the small Communist Party of Australia and its leader, Lance Sharkey.\n\nImage sourced from: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/e ... 30s%29.jpg\n\nLawrence Louis \"Lance\" Sharkey (1898 – 1967) joined the Communist Party in 1924 and emerged in 1928 as a strong advocate of the Comintern line when he was elected to the CPA's governing Central Committee. In 1929 he was appointed editor of the party newspaper “Workers' Weekly” and would edit that paper and another party publication, “The Tribune”, through the 1930s. He became Chairman of the CPA in 1930 and would hold the post until 1948 (from 1948 to 1965 he served as the Secretary-General of the Party - closely following the prevailing Soviet line in each major turn of policy). In the summer of 1930 Sharkey visited the Soviet Union for the first time.When Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies declared the CPA illegal in June 1940, Sharkey and other party leaders went underground. A year later when Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union, the ban on members of the CPA was relaxed and Sharkey resumed open political activity. In March 1949 Sharkey told a Sydney journalist that \"if Soviet Forces in pursuit of aggressors entered Australia, Australian workers would welcome them.\" For this statement Sharkey was tried and convicted of sedition. The High Court upheld his conviction; and in October he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. He remained prominent in the Australian Communist Party where he minimised Khrushchev's repudiation of Stalin in 1956 and the Soviet invasion of Hungary later that year. He died of a heart attack on 13 May 1967 in Sydney.\n\nIn January 1940 Sharkey explained the facts as Australian communists saw them. Finland had been ruled by Mannerheim’s clique for twenty years. The clique had come to power at the point of the bayonets of German imperialism which had overthrown the socialist government that the workers had established in Finland during the course of the Russian revolution, murdering between 30,000 and 50,000 Finnish and Russian workers in the process. Australian communists were told that Mannerheim had established a White Terror Dictatorship in which the Communist Party was suppressed and trade union recognition was illegal until the last hours before the War. The government of Kuusinen was, by this account, the legitimate successor to the government of the Finnish People which had been overthrown by the bayonets of Mannerheim and Von Der Goltz in 1920. Sharkey argued that the Finnish White Guards were the mortal enemies of the Soviet Union and stressed that Finnish Reaction was dangerous because it was a puppet of world imperialism, a dagger in the hands of British, French and German imperialism. It was a danger because the Finnish terrain, in the hands of a strong Army, would make it a most powerful military base, especially as Finland commanded the approaches to Leningrad and Murmansk. The Finnish White Guards, added Sharkey, could have had a treaty with the Soviet Union on the same terms as the three Baltic States. This they had refused, believing in the support of British and French imperialism and, behaving provocatively, even firing on Soviet troops. Sharkey concluded by describing the Finnish negotiations with the Soviet Union as sabotage. But he was glad to report that the mutual assistance treaty between Kuusuninen’s Finnish Government and the Soviet Union made Finland and the Soviet Union secure from attack (noting in passing that the capitalist rulers of Finland are of Swedish extraction), and he comprehensively predicted that the toiling people of the whole world would rejoice at the liberalization of their brothers in Finland, and would spit on the lies of capitalism, the millionaire press, the labour imperialists and the Trotsky"
