        "text": "Editorial Review\n\nProduct Description\n\nThis book discusses the career of Charles Babbage (1791-1871), British advocate of the systematic use of science in industry and creator of machines that were precursors of the modern computer. Babbage used his immense personal charm and vitality in an attempt to change the thinking of contemporary industrialists who had little use for the higher reaches of science. Shifting his own energies from pure mathematics, he planned engines that would \"calculate by steam\": the Difference Engines, designed to compute tables according to the method of finite differences, and the more complex Analytical Engines, forerunners of the modern computer.\n\nAlmost forgotten and then rediscovered in the middle of the twentieth century, the Analytical Engines are among the great intellectual achievements of humankind. This biography of their polymathic inventor gives a convincing account of his tragic personal life and his important place in the history of science.\n\n... Read more\n\nCustomer Reviews (3)\n\nBabbage as a man of extraordinary breadth\n\nWhile Babbage is rightly mentioned in any book covering the history of the computer, he is often wrongly presented as somewhat of a crank. His life is generally described as that of a genius whose ideas were far ahead of the times and as a person who spent enormous amounts of personal and public funds in single-minded attempts to build machines that never worked. In fact, he was a man of extraordinary breadth and depth of interest, and his original difference engine worked very well. Furthermore, it can be strongly argued that the economic gains due to the fast and precise computations performed by his difference engine and the improvements in machining accuracy more than returned the public investment in the project.\n\nHyman does an excellent job in describing the totality of the life of Babbage. Even though I have read a great deal about the history of computing, until I encountered this book I had no idea that he was also a talented commentator on the social, economic and political changes taking place in England at that time. The industrial revolution was in high gear and Babbage was one of the leaders. His interests in all things mechanical are well documented as well as his numerous writings.\n\nBabbage was also an experimental scientist who constantly discussed improvements with those who were making them. At the time, most of the mechanical improvements were being made by people with little formal education, but with a great deal of practical experience. The majority of the members of the scientific establishment were reluctant to get their hands and bodies dirty by entering the factories, but Babbage never hesitated. He was also very instrumental in the creation and expansion of scientific societies, although he also wielded a very caustic pen in describing the pompous irrelevance of some of the members.\n\nBabbage also commented extensively about the relationship between the owners of the factories and the workers. His approach was to examine the problem in a scientific manner, largely refusing to take any side based on emotion. Many of his comments emphasize cooperation between the two groups and one can see some of the modern concepts of revenue sharing, worker ownership of stock, employee training and benefits. Babbage's writings were very influential and controversial, they were a strong influence on Karl Marx and Frederich Engels, who took a quite different approach. He was also an advocate of free trade and foresaw much of what went wrong in the British Empire.\n\nCharles Babbage has always had a place on my list of technological heroes, but after reading this book, he has been allocated a higher rank. He was a man with a great deal of understanding of how English and western societies were changing and many of his fundamental ideas of computing were over a century ahead of his time. Given the enormous economic benefits of the computer, had all of his projects been funded to completion, England may have remained an industrial powerhouse well into the twentieth century.\n\nPublished in the recreational mathematics e-mail newsletter, reprinted with permission.\n\nA Superb Read; Not What I Expected\n\nI read this book last year (2000) after reading a book of Ada Lovelace's letters (mostly to Babbage). I had purchased my hardcover copy at the Computer Museum in Boston MA back in the late 80's or early 90's, but had not read it because it looked daunting and dry. Was I wrong! This book is very readable and utterly fascinating; in fact a page turner that I could hardly put down. I've been looking for a softcover (or even another hardcover) for some time, so I could loan to friends. How delighted I am to find one! Babbage was a fascinating character and this book not only illuminates the man but also the times and the politics and the other fascinating technological events and efforts of the day. The discussion of the \"great gauge wars\" (the fight for the \"ideal\" width for railroad tracks) and Babbage's involvement was delightful. It appears he may have invented the first working strip chart recorder. This book was delightful and I got so involved with Babbage that I cried when his death occurred and the book ended. He was a giant among scientists and yet was frustrated all his life, by petty politics and short-sighted politicians, in the effort to build his stupendous and wondrous machines. A wonderful story, full of technological history. Other highlights: descriptions and pictures of the machines (of course); description of the effort to build a tunnel under the Thames river (by the the Jr and Sr Brunels); Babbage's methods (at times he did all phases of the work for his projects) and his workshop; his notes on working out the operation of the machines; family life; involvement in the technical societies of the day. (The book of Ada Lovelace's letters is also highly recommended if this is an interesting area for you.)...\n\nThe Computer was Invented well before Reticulated Electricit\n\nIn the early 19th century, a moderately well-off and very well educated Englishman dreams up an elaborate calculating machine for doing log and trig tables. When he begins this project, the railroad and the telegraph do not yet exist. The machine tools and manufacturing methods of the day are not up to the task, so the Englishman pushes out the envelope. He more or less succeeds in building his machine, but the British government is not interested.\n\nThe inventor goes back to the drawing board, and dreams up a much more elaborate machine, still all mechanical and steam driven, that essentially embodies all the abstractions of a von Neumann machine. Data and instructions are fed to it via punched cards. His collaborator for a number of years, and the author of the best description of the machine and what it can do, is Byron's daughter. The inventor is well known to all intellectual Britons of his day, including Charles Dickens. The inventor even realises that Boolean algebra may prove important for the sort of machine he is struggling to build. The Italian government is fascinated. But the British government again cannot be bothered, and thus refuses to fund the first computer. And so all that we have are hundreds of detailed blueprints.\n\nThe above, and more, is a true story, told in this remarkable book. After this book was printed, IBM paid to have Babbage's machine built by a Swedish team. It works as Babbage expected it to, and is exhibited in the IBM museum in Armonk NY. ... Read more\n\nEditorial Review\n\nProduct Description\n\nIn 1821 an inventor and mathematician named Charles Babbage was reviewing a set of mathematical tables. After finding an excess of errors in the results, he exclaimed, \"I wish to God these calculations had been executed by steam.\" Thus began Babbage's lifelong enterprise to design and build a mechanical calculating engine-the world's first computer. Drawing on Babbage's original notes and designs, Doron Swade recounts both Babbage's nineteenth-century quest to build a calculating machine-the Difference Engine-and Swade's own successful attempt to build a replica for the bicentennial of Babbage's birth. Set against the tantalizing background of Victorian science and politics with a colorful cast of characters, The Difference Engine is a saga of ingenuity and will-and the dawning of a new age. Amazon.com Review\n\nWhat a difference a century makes. Doron Swade, technology historian and assistant director of London's Science Museum, investigates the troubles that plagued 19th-century knowledge engineers in The Difference Engine: Charles Babbage and the Quest to Build the First Computer.\n\nThe author is in a unique position to appreciate the technical difficulties of the time, as he led a team that built a working model of a Difference Engine, using contemporary materials, in time for Babbage's 1991 bicentenary. The meat of the book is comprised of the story of the first computing machine design as gathered from the technical notes and drawings curated by Swade. Though Babbage certainly had problems translating his ideas into brass, the reader also comes to understand his fruitless, drawn-out arguments with his funders. Swade had it comparatively easy, though his depictions of the frustrating search for money and then working out how best to build the enormous machine in the late 1980s are delightful.\n\nIt is difficult--maybe impossible--to draw a clear, unbroken line of influence from Babbage to any modern computer researchers, but his importance both as the first pioneer and as a symbol of the joys and sorrows of computing is unquestioned. Swade clearly respects his subject deeply, all the more so for having tried to bring the great old man's ideas to life. The Difference Engine is lovingly comprehensive and will thrill readers looking for a more technical examination of Babbage's career. --Rob Lightner ...

Beyond that, I have nothing to add to the previous excellent reviews, except to note that it seems to be precisely the same book as Doron Swade's The Cogwheel Brain. I nearly bought both until I checked the tables of contents...\n\nOne of the great accomplishments of the 19th century\n\nCharles Babbage and John Herschel, the astronomer, were preparing tables for the astronomical society.They needed to check the work of computations by humans, by different computers.The need for tables was particulary important for navigators.The source of error in the tables was clear, human fallibility.The manual production of tables, calculation, transcription, typesetting, and proofreading created opportunities for error.The engine of change in 1821 was the steam engine.Charles Babbage wanted to produce a machine to produce error-free tables.\n\nBabbage entered Trinity in 1810.He studied on his own the work of the French mathematicians.His father was a well-to-do London banker.Charles married and received from his father an allowance of three hundred pounds.In London he established himself in scientific circles.By the spring of 1822 he had a small working model of his first design.Computing devices of the time required manipulation and were limited as to the size of the numbers the devices could handle.Babbit first used the method of differences, addition, in his design.He sent a brief announcement to the Astronomical Society about his invention.He received a mandate from the government and was prepared to build a new machine.He hired Joseph Clement for precision engineering work.Clement and Babbage devised new tools and modified machines.There was a need to produce large numbers of similar parts.Babbage conceived of his machine when manufacturing was in transition.By 1826 Babbage was wholly absorbed in the design of his Difference Engine.The machine was eight feet by seven feet by three feet.\n\nIn 1826 Babbage published a book on life assurance.While traveling in Europe following the death of his wife, he learned of his election as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics.He never resided in Cambridge and gave no lectures.Babbage expressed a view on the decline of science In England.Undoubtedly science was more professional in Prussia and France.Babbage's position alienated some of his supporters.In 1832 part of the engine was put on display in his drawing room.Clement was to leave the project.Work was not resumed.The Treasury Department spent more than seventeen thousand pounds on it.\n\nThere is a curious affinity between mathematics, mind, and computing.After the break with Clement, Babbage moved from the Difference Engine to the Analytical Engine.He devised the first automatic mechanisms for multiplication and division.He had in fact designed a general purpose four function calculator.In 1836 he opted for punch cards to control the engine.The Analytical Engine was never built.Babbage worked in isolation.With the Analytical Engine Babbage was seduced by the intellectual quest.\n\nAfter twenty years the Treasury axed the Difference Engine and wrote off the expense.Between 1846 and 1849 Babbage designed Difference Engine No. 2.Maurice Wilkins believed the Analytical Engine was one of the great accomplishments of the 19th century.The Science Museum in Britain built a version of the Difference Engine No. 2 for an exhibit on Babbage.\n\nWonderful Engines\n\nThis book has 2 basic parts.First, is the discussion of Babbage's life and his computing engines.Second, is the author's modern-day story of attempting to complete Babbage's Difference Engine, a feat which Babbage himself was unable to do.I picked up this book for the first part.I wanted to learn about Babbage and how his engines worked.While the author gives a wonderful account of Babbage's life and methodology, he does not clearly describe HOW these engines function.I realize that the engines are extremely complex, but a chapter on the functioning of the Difference Engine trial piece and some diagrams on its operations would have been much appreciated. Unfortunately, as were Babbage's contemporaries, we are left mainly in dark as to how simply turning a crank can produce the necessary additions.The author also never fully explains the \"method of finite differences\" upon which the function of the difference engine is based.\n\nThe most amazing part of the book is the overview of Babbage's design for the Analytical Engine- the first programmable computer.It is amazingly similar in concept to today's modern computers, but it uses motion through metal gears and cams, instead of electricity through logic gates and wires. I expected to be bored by the modern-day story, but I actually was interested in the process of reconstructing this 19th century machine.It was enlightening to see how the same problems Babbage faced 150 years before troubled engineers today.\n\nOverall, I recommend this book for those curious about Babbage and his engines. However, the writing seems jerky and unorganized in parts, and there is little technical description of the engines' functionality.\n\nDoron Swade's Quest to Build a Difference Engine\n\nThis is the first book I've read on Charles Babbage, but I imagine that there are others that are better.First, this book seems to assume you've already read a book or two about Babbage before.It almost has an apologetic tone and seems to be an answer to what, I assume, have been slights against Babbage and his work.Second, this book is as much about the author and his quest to build a Difference Engine as it is about Babbage himself.If you want to hear about dealing with office politics in an British museum, you may find this interesting.\n\nAll in all, this is a fairly dry read.It was interesting at points, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it for your first book on Babbage. ...

In these, Hartree provided the first comprehensive survey of the significant developments in computation that were going on at the time—the main directions of development in storage systems, serial machines, and parallel programming and coding, and particularly with high-speed automatic digital machines that were precursors of the modern stored program computer.\n\nCalculating Instruments and Machines was originally published in 1949 by the University of Illinois Press. It is Volume VI in The Babbage Institute Reprint Series. ... Read more\n\nCustomer Reviews (1)\n\nComputing Prehistory by One of Its British Participants\n\nCalculating MachinesDouglas R. Hartree\n\nA review by Frederick A. Ware\n\nThis book is volume six in the Charles Babbage Institute Reprint Series for the History of Computing. Douglas Hartree was primarily aphysicist, his most significant contribution being the Hartree-Fockself-consistent approximation technique for generating molecular wavefunctions. Later in his career, he became one of the leading computerresearchers in Britain during the late 1940s when Britain briefly overtookthe United States in this new field.\n\nThis was a tremendously enjoyablebook. It goes into significant depth in a number of areas. The reader isimpressed and surprised by how far computer hardware and softwaredevelopment had moved in the three years since the unveiling of Eniac.\n\nThis is a valuable historical reference, as well, touching upon theprimary classes of computing machinery during what is arguably the mostcritical two decades in the realization of the computer. In 1930 the onlycomputing instruments were the mechanical desk calculator and slide rule.By 1950 there were several dozen stored program machines doing useful workscattered across two continents.\n\nThis book covers the development ofcalculating instruments and machinery during the 1930s and the 1940s.Briefly, the nine chapters are:\n\n[1] Introduction\n\n[2] The DifferentialAnalyser (those Brits don't know how to spell) - The Bush DifferentialAnalyser is described extensively. The core of this mechanical analoguecomputer is the two diskintegrator. Shaft rotations are used to representnumerical values, and ordinary differential equations may be solvednumerically with the instrument. There is also some discussion of howmechanical analogue computers were quickly replaced by analogue electroniccomputers with the development of the vacuum tube operationalamplifier.\n\n[3] The Differential Analyser and Partial DifferentialEquations - Partial differential equations are turned into ordinarydifferential equations be evaluating them with one of the independent keptto a limited range. The equations are solved repeatedly to give a family ofnumerical solutions.\n\n[4]Some Other Instruments - Analogue instrumentationcapable of Fourier decomposition and Fourier synthesis is described.\n\n[5]Introduction to Large Automatic Digital Computers - The structure of adigital computer is described - main store, processing unit, control unit,and an input/output unit. Also the basic classes of commands used toprogram the machine are described: load/store transfers, arithmetic/logicaloperations, sequencing operations (branch and skip), and input/outputoperations. Computer science 101, but it was pretty new in 1949.\n\n[6]Charles Babbage and the Analytical Engine - A description of Babbagescomputer demonstrating how it mapped into the digital computer of chapter5.\n\n[7] The First Stage of Development - A description of the firstcomputers (really just souped-up calculaters with some kind of automaticsequencing capability). This included the Harvard Mark I mechanical digitalcomputer, the Bell Telephone relay digital computer, and the Penn Statevacuum tube digital computer. Of the three, the Eniac was the mostsignificant because of its blinding speed - the electronic components gaveit a 1000x performance advantage over the other technologies. The keycontribution of Mauchley and Eckert was to prove that large numbers ofvacuum tubes could be operated reliably. The architecture of the machinewas not significant, with all subsequent vacuum tube machines utilizing thefamiliar stored program architecture.\n\n[8] Projects and Prospects - Thedevelopment of large, fast main storage is the critical problem to beaddressed in the late 1940s. The two principle alternatives to vacuum tubeflipflops are mercury delay lines and electrostatic storage on a CRT . Bothare volatile and require refreshing techniques. Both go on to be used in anumber of computers in the next five years until ferrite core memory isdeveloped.\n\n[9] High Speed Automatic Digital Machines and NumericalAnalysis - The first attempts to develop numerical algorithms that arestable and efficient. The problems are the same as those attacked by theearlier analogue machines, but the problems of roundoff and quantizationmust be addressed for the first time. ... Read more"
