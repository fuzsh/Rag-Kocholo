March 17th, 1940. \n\n*Note: many of the soldiers in these images are equipped with civilian winter clothing and hats, along with some Soviet Mosin rifles. During the Winter War supplies for newly called forces of the Army and Finnish National Guard during mobilization in November were slim. Many forces only received a rifle and hat badge, the rest they would have to supply themselves. \n\nThese items were nicknamed “Malli Cajander” or “Model Cajander” after the Finnish Prime Minister Aimo K. Cajander. Budget cuts to the military along with poor organization in the early stages of the conflict left some soldiers to supply themselves with clothing from home, often this clothing was better for harsh winter climates as 78% of Finns lived in the countryside. \n\nSeparate battalion 10 (ErP 10) was established by the Salmi protectorate district of Finland on October 7, 1939, in accordance with the order received in Suojärvi from the following day.\n\nAs a unit belonging to the Finnish National Guard, the battalion received better than average equipment compared to other forces of the Winter War (Talvisota).\".",
