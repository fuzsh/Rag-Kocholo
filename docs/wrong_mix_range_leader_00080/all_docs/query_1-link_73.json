The transformation of what less than a century ago was a poor agrarian land on the northern periphery of Europe into one of the most prosperous states of the European Union today is a remarkable story, but is by no means an uneventful one. The gaining of independence from Russia in 1918 was accompanied by a bitter civil war which left its scars upon the body politic of Finland for decades. Finland fought three wars between 1939 and 1945, twice against the Soviet Union and once against Germany, and suffered grievous loss of life in addition to almost a tenth of its territory. The political history of the independent republic was for much of the twentieth century conflict-ridden and far removed from the image of consensual stability and good European membership that is projected today. The reinvention of Finland over the past two decades as a confident and assertive Eurostate, no longer in the shadow of the Soviet Union, has also been paralleled by a reevaluation of the nation’s history and identity. In particular, Finland’s recent past has come under severe scrutiny, as part of what may be seen as a purging process not dissimilar to the examination in eastern European countries of ‘blank spots’ in the recent past. This reassessment of the nation’s past constitutes one of the starting-points for this book. It is primarily a political history, though due consideration is given to the social, cultural, and eco­ nomic forces which have shaped that history, both in the short term and over the centuries. xiii\n\nxiv\n\nPreface\n\nWhilst adopting a conventional chronological structure, I have attempted to highlight those features which have made Finland what it is today. In particular, I have highlighted the spatial, tem­ poral, and political dimensions that have helped determine how language and culture have evolved. The ways in which the inhabi­ tants of a cold and rather infertile northern land have sought to adapt and innovate, how the land has been a means of sustenance and a symbol of nationhood, are at the heart of being Finnish. The struggle to wrest a living from the soil is an epic and abiding theme, running from the earliest days of human settlement as the massive ice-cap began to retreat, right up to the huge efforts in the late 1940s to resettle thousands of refugees. In this sense, Finland has been very much a frontier country, and this may well account for the two contradictory and conflicting forces that have made their mark in Finnish life over the centuries. The first seems to be strongly driven by a desire to harness and utilise all possible resources. It has created a strong tradition of obedience to author­ ity, reinforced by the Lutheran church, strong bureaucratic insti­ tutions, and a rigid respect for the law, but it has also preferred co-operation and consensus to coercion. The second is a far less formally defined tradition, of wildness, lawlessness, a kind of fron­ tiersman mentality that ignores or disobeys the law. The seven brothers of Aleksis Kivi’s eponymous nineteenth-century novel, who flee the constraints of civilisation to live a wild, free life; the puukkojunkkarit or roaring boys of Ostrobothnia, with their big knives and boastful swagger; the bootleggers of the inter-war pro­ hibition era, purveying lethal alcohol for thirsty customers around the land; even the lost, pathetic characters of Aki Kaurismaki’s films: all stand within this loose tradition of truculent defiance, with its deep distrust of the herrat, or gentlefolk. This is a tradition that is easily lost in the glossy presentation of the success story, but it has also played a part in shaping the Finland of today. The history of modern Finland seems to alternate between long periods of relative tranquillity and little visible change and short, intense bursts in which everything is transformed, and it appears to be going through one of these periods at the present time. I have attempted to understand and make sense of these changes against the background of a recent past that I myself experienced at first\n\nPreface\n\nxv\n\nhand, and which shaped my own perceptions of and ideas about Finland, and I freely admit that many of my conclusions may be coloured by this experience. Over the years, I have benefited greatly from discussions with colleagues in Finland and the UK; without this, I would not have been able to write this book, and I would like to thank them all for their kindness and support. I must also thank the personnel of the National Board of Antiquities and of the Labour Archives in Helsinki for their help in the selection of the plates. I also wish to thank the trustees of the Presidential Archive for allowing me to reproduce the photograph of President Kekkonen being welcomed by President Kennedy in 1961. Finland is officially a two-language state, and much of the histor­ ical terminology is of Swedish origin. Where I have deemed it appropriate, I have given the Swedish term with a Finnish equiva­ lent. The names of provinces, counties, and towns are given only in Finnish, except in cases where historically the Swedish term is better known, for example, in the Treaty of Nystad of 172.1. I have also given in parentheses, and in some cases used, the Finnish term for major institutions, such as the parliament.\n\nI A medieval marchland\n\nThe physical contours of northern Europe, including the 338,145 sq.km, of land and water that constitute the present-day republic of Finland, were essentially shaped in the aftermath of the great Ice Age. The retreating mass of ice scoured the crystalline bedrock of the Fenno-Scandian shield, leaving in its wake thousands of shallow lakes, eskers and drumlins, and a deeply indented coastline that is still emerging from the sea as the land recovers from the tre­ mendous compression of the glaciers. Only in the far north of Finland does the land rise above a thousand metres. To the east, the Maanselka ridge is a watershed for the rivers that run west­ wards into the Gulf of Bothnia and eastwards into the White Sea. The great lake systems of central and eastern Finland are separated from the coastal regions by a further series of ridges running in a south-eastward direction towards the south coast. Almost a quarter of the surface area of this inland region is covered by water, and a further 20 per cent is classified as wetland, mostly bogs and mor­ asses. With all but a tiny tip of land lying north of the sixtieth parallel (Oslo and the Shetland Islands lie on this latitude, Stock­ holm slightly further south), Finland can claim to be the most northerly of all the countries of mainland Europe, stretching over a thousand kilometres from the northern shores of the Baltic towards the Arctic Sea. Summers are warm, but brief; winters long, dark, and cold, though there is a considerable difference between the south-west, with snow cover on average between 70 and no days a year, the eastern regions, averaging 160-90 days, and the\n\n1\n\n2\n\nA concise history of Finland\n\nnorth, averaging 200-20 days. The inhabitants of this northern land have had to learn to live with winter, the floods of spring, and the vagaries of the summer months, when frosts in May or. August can wreak havoc with crops, and this has helped shape a culture in which stubborn resilience, patient endurance, and hard work are held in esteem. Finland is above all a land of trees, mostly pine and spruce, vast forests stretching as far as the eye can see; even today, over half the land surface of the country is still woodland. It was in all likelihood the forest, rich in game, that attracted settlers from the south and east some nine thousand years ago. Artefacts and bone remains from the Mesolithic period reveal an extensive hunting and fishing culture, essentially confined to the coastline and main watercourses. Elk were an important source of meat, bones, sinew, and hide, and were also an inspiration to Neolithic artists in wood and stone; seals provided blubber, meat, and skins for consumption and trade; fish, pike in particular, birds, nuts, and berries all supplemented the diet of these early settlers. From around 3300 bc, the area of present-day Finland was on the westernmost limits of a new culture, producing pottery with a characteristic comb pattern. It is thought that the bearers of this new culture from the Volga region also spoke a Finnic language, which, in turn influenced and modified by other languages with which it came into contact, developed into what philologists term Proto-Finnish. These people appear to have settled largely south of the Gulf of Finland, though one group from which the Sami are linguistically descended seems to have broken away at an early stage and migrated to the lands north of the great lakes of Ladoga and Onega. Contacts with Ancient Baltic and East Germanic peo­ ples significantly altered the Proto-Finnic language, and the culture of the peoples who spoke it. From the southern shores of the Gulf of Finland, the peoples who were to constitute the four main dialect groups of the Finnish language, South-West Finnish, Häme, Savo, and Karelian, moved northwards by land and sea over the next centuries. By the beginning of the Bronze Age in northern Europe, around 1500 BC, two sharply differentiated main cultural zones had emerged. The inhabitants of the western and southern shores\n\nA medieval marchland\n\n3\n\nwere strongly influenced by contacts with Scandinavia and Central Europe, those of the hinterland continued to receive their cultural impulses from the east. In the more fertile soils of the river valleys and coastal plains, farming became the cultural norm; in the forests and moors of the north and east, the hunting and fishing culture continued to flourish. The origins of the Finnish people, and in particular, the ‘eastern’ and ‘western’ aspects of settlement and culture, remain a subject of much debate and occasional contro­ versy, and this debate has influenced and continues to shape the way Finns perceive themselves and others. How the Finns them­ selves have been perceived by outsiders is quite another matter. The ‘Finns’ (phinnoi, fenni, screrefenni) mentioned by the earliest authors (Tacitus in the first century ad, Jordanes in the sixth) who attempted to identify the inhabitants of this hyperborean region were in fact hunter-gatherers of the far north - the sort of people who might indeed have had trade dealings with a traveller such as the ninth-century Norwegian Ottar, whose account of his travels in the north was preserved for posterity by King Alfred of Wessex. The dwellers in these far northern lands were described in a twelfth-century history of Norway as ‘people who regrettably wor­ ship false gods, namely, the Karelians and Kweni, the Hornfinns and the Biarmi’. The Kweni and Biarmi are known from other sources as traders in furs, and seem to have operated in an area between the White Sea and the northernmost part of the Gulf of Bothnia: as a distinctive group, they have long vanished into the mists of time. The Hornfinns were probably Sami, ‘Finns’ to the Norwegians (the northernmost region of Norway is known as Finnmark). The Kar­ elians began to spread out from their heartland around lakes Ladoga and Onega during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries -eastwards to the mouth of the northern Dvina, northwards to the shores of the Arctic, where they clashed with the Norwegians, whilst in the west they came into conflict with the Häme tribe. At the same time, they also began to come under the influence and control of the Orthodox church and the principality of Novgorod. The medieval European image of the ‘Finns’ as primitive hunters, practitioners of magic, and sellers of wind to stranded seafarers thus owed much to the tales of North Atlantic adventurers. Of the peoples who lived along the Baltic coastline and gradually\n\n4\n\nA concise history of Finland\n\nsettled the hinterland, we have remarkably little written evidence, although a thirteenth-century description of the sea route from Denmark to the eastern Baltic shows that this was a well-used sea route in Viking times, and archaeological finds also indicate that the shipbuilding technology of the Vikings was known and practised in western Finland. The word ‘Finland’ came into common usage during the middle ages, though the area it was meant to embrace remained vague and ill defined. Significantly, the term was used as a means of indicating the consolidation of central authority: by Pope Gregory IX in 1229, announcing that Finlandia had passed under his protection, and by King Magnus Laduläs of Sweden in 1284 when he named his brother Bengt duke of Finland. Sources from the period before the consolidation of Catholic and Swedish authority, such as runic inscriptions and Orthodox monastic chronicles, refer more com­ monly to tribes, such as the Häme. These tribes possessed the organisational ability to make war and engage in trade, and were sufficiently powerful to cause trouble to their neighbours when the occasion demanded; but in common with the other peoples within what Robert Bartlett has termed the arc of ‘non-literate polytheism’ stretching from the Elbe to the Arctic circle, they were eventually drawn into the institutional framework of Latin Christendom. As a political entity, Finland owes its existence to the realm which gradually established itself between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries on the central plains of present-day Sweden. The expan­ sion and consolidation of the kingdom of the Svea and Göta embraced Norrland and Dalarna to the north and west, the island of Gotland, and what came to be known as Finland Proper (Varsinais-Suomi, Egentliga Finland). For the seafaring peoples of northern Europe, the shallow waters of the Baltic were a ready means of communication during the sailing season rather than an obstacle (though the icing up of the sea in winter did effectively cut off communities otherwise linked by seaways and waterways), and there is plentiful evidence of intermingling and mixed settlement of the peoples around the north-eastern Baltic rim before the so-called ‘crusades’ which have conventionally marked the beginning of the period during which Finland became a part of the Swedish kingdom.\n\nA medieval marchland\n\n5\n\nw fl Rnnwc/AUpp&landfe^ Carelú\n\nBotnia\n\nH edad\n\nPlate i Map of northern Europe, printed in Sebastian Munster’s Cosmographia of 1551. The first detailed map of northern Europe to be printed was the Carta Gothica, later renamed Carta Marina, of Olaus Magnus, published in Venice in 1539. The wilderness dominates much of the map, as well as Olaus Magnus’s description of the northern peoples published sixteen years later. Signs of human habitation and cultivation are confined to the south-western comet; Finland Proper. To the north and east are the beasts of the forest, fish, and fowl, with the occasional crew steering a boat over the waters of a lake or sleds drawn by horses or reindeers over the frozen sea. This simplified version of the Carta Marina was reproduced in Sebastian Munster’s Cosmographia, first published in Basel in 1544, and running to numerous editions thereafter. Munster’s account of the languages spoken in Finland is a fair indication of the general state of ignorance and confusion about such distant places. In the words of his English translator, George North, ‘the inhabitantes of Fynland do speake two sundry languages. From Wiburg to Berga or Sibbona (Viipuri to Porvoo or Sipoo), they do for the most part speake the Sclavon tong, but nere the Sea coastes they use at thys present the Swecian language, and in the myddest of the Country, theyr proper speeche.’\n\nThe early eighteenth-century historian Algot Scarin believed the absence of pre-Christian monuments or fortified sites indicated that the sacred rites of the Finnish people must have been different from\n\n6\n\nA concise history of Finland\n\nthose of the other Nordic nations, and that Sweden was already possessed of a proper supreme authority whilst the Finns were still nomads. Historians of a more intensely nationalistic era tended to see in the crusades the establishment of Swedish rule over the Finnish people - a ‘Swedish conquest’ as M. G. Schybergson described it in his Finlands historia of 1903 - and the implantation of western Christian values. More recent scholarship has drawn attention to the fact that the Swedish state itself was in the very early stages of construction, and that much of what happened in the Finnish half of the realm was also taking place in the western half. The crusades themselves, although inspired by the general enthu­ siasm for taking the Cross and its message to the infidel and the heathen, were less significant than the slower process of establish­ ing an institutional presence. There is much uncertainty over the date and nature of the first crusade, which was first described over a hundred years later in the 1x70s. It is supposed to have occurred during the brief reign of King Erik (1155/56-60), and the work of conversion was in the hands of an Englishman, Henry. As both men were murdered shortly thereafter and elevated to popular saint­ hood, there is reason to be wary of the accretion of legend. The story of Henry’s murder by Lalli, and the miraculous events that followed, is of comparatively late provenance, whilst Erik’s saintly qualities were promoted by his son in order to reflect honour and prestige upon his family. The brief incursion was probably not unconnected with the increasing conflict between the Swedish realm and the princes of Novgorod, who were also seeking to augment their position west of lakes Onega and Ladoga. Raids and counter-raids, rather than planned and sustained campaigns, were the norm, and it is highly unlikely that Erik had the resources or inclination to support a crusade to convert the heathen Finns. That some kind of missionary activity was taking place is, how­ ever, indicated in the bull Gravis admodum, sent to the archbishop of Uppsala and his subordinate bishops by Pope Alexander III in 1171 or 1172, though the main thrust of this missive indicates that such work was having only limited success. The bull may have been intended to stir the Swedes into action, or it may also have been part of a campaign by the exiled archbishop of Lund, in the Danish kingdom, to reassert his authority over the newly created Swedish\n\nA medieval marchland\n\n7\n\nPlate 2 Bishop Henry trampling his murderer Lalli underfoot. From the Missale Aboense of 1448. According to the earliest versions of the legend, dating from the thirteenth century, Henry was an Englishman, elected bishop of Uppsala, who accompanied King Erik of Sweden on crusade to Finland in the 1150s. Here, he was murdered on a frozen lake by a peasant, Lalli, egged on to do the deed by a spiteful wife. A thirteenth-century poem, fragments of which remain, has Henry decreeing before his death that his body shall be borne on a wagon drawn by two oxen, and be buried at the spot where the oxen came to rest. This happened to be Nousiainen, the first seat of the bishop of Finland, and although the see was finally transferred to Turku in the thirteenth century, Nousiainen remained a centre of pilgrimage throughout the middle ages. Lalli was justly punished for his impiety, losing his scalp when he tried to pull off the bishop’s cap he had stolen. It is tempting to see in this fateful encounter between the first Finn recorded in history, a ‘wild’ man, and the ‘civilised’ westerner a paradigm for the later development of Finnish identity.\n\narchbishopric. The expansion of trade into the eastern Baltic, which brought German merchants to Gotland and Novgorod, the conso­ lidation of Danish power in northern Europe, and the creeping eastward progress of forcible conversion along the southern shores of the Baltic, may also have prompted renewed papal interest in\n\n8\n\nA concise history of Finland\n\nnorthern Europe. Danish forces raided the Finnish and Estonian coastline several times between 1191 and 1x02. The military Order of the Sword-Brothers, established in 1200 by Albert of Buxtehude, bishop of Riga, were busily engaged further south with the forcible conversion of the Livs around the mouth of the river Daugava. Papal correspondence indicates that the Swedes also carried out crusading raids, though they appear not to have attempted to build a more permanent presence in Finland until Danish forces had finally shifted their attention to the southern shores of the Gulf of Finland, conquering the Estonian stronghold of Lindenisse in 1219 and laying the foundations of the castle that still dominates the skyline of the modern city of Tallinn. By the middle of the thirteenth century, there existed a recogni­ sably Christian community in the relatively fertile plains of Finland Proper and on the scattered islands of the Aland archipelago. The see of the bishop was finally established on the banks of the river Aura, and work had begun on the cathedral in what was to be for almost six hundred years the capital of Finland: in Swedish, Abo, or ‘settlement by the river’, in Finnish, Turku, or ‘trading place’. Under the energetic leadership of Bishop Thomas, missionary work to the heathen Häme of the hinterland had begun. The work of conversion was not, however, a monopoly of the Catholic church. Russian Orthodoxy, having extended its influence into the region around lakes Ladoga and Onega was also active amongst the Häme. The crusade called by Pope Gregory IX in 1237 against the Häme became in fact a full-blown clash between the forces mustered by the church and the king of Sweden and the prince of Novgorod, Alexander Nevsky. The Russian chronicler records that the Swedish forces were heavily defeated in 1240 in a battle at the confluence of the rivers Neva and Izhora. However, according to the Erikskrönikan, a rhyme-chronicle written in the 1330s, the Swedes were revenged some nine years later, when, led by the powerful nobleman Birger Jarl, the Häme were finally subjugated. In the words of the chronicle, ‘They settled the land with Christian men / and there I trust they still remain, I And the land was turned to our belief / which gave the Russian king much grief’ (trans. Eric Christiansen). The fact that Sweden and Norway were locked in a serious conflict in 1249-50 makes the dating of this second crusade\n\nA medieval marchland\n\n9\n\nunlikely, and it has been argued that it actually took place a decade earlier, before the disastrous campaign against Alexander Nevsky, at a time when Novgorod was being hard pressed by the Mongols. Whatever the truth of the matter, the building of strong fortresses in Turku and Häme was a highly visible symbol of the presence of Swedish royal authority on the eastern shores of the Gulf of Both­ nia. The foundations of a third castle were laid at the end of the century, at Viipuri on the eastern frontier, and a lengthy period of warfare between Sweden and Novgorod was formally ended in 1323 with the signing of a peace treaty. The precise terms of the peace of Oreshek (Pähkinäsaari, Nöteborg) have caused much dis­ pute amongst historians. It would appear that the two parties ensured a fairly careful delineation of the frontier in the Karelian isthmus, which was divided in two, but thereafter the line of the frontier is open to interpretation. It is likely that the two parties were less interested in securing territory than in defining spheres of influence for taxation purposes over the peoples who dwelt in the vast tracts of forest and moor that stretched northwards from the great lakes to the Arctic. Novgorod was subsequently seriously weakened by internal convulsions and threatened by Mongols, Lithuanians, and the knights of the Teutonic Order, and was there­ fore in no position to assert its rights. The claim to authority, and the rights of taxation, were, however, remembered and renewed by the first Russian settlers on the Arctic coast in the sixteenth century. The institution of a Swedish royal council, the emergence of a regular administrative structure and a fiscal apparatus, and the codi­ fication of law codes during the reigns of Magnus Ladulas (1275—90) and Magnus Eriksson (1319-64) are the most evident signs of the consolidation of a realm that was also heavily involved in ambitious territorial and dynastic ventures in northern Europe. The Finnish lands were to all intents and purposes integrated into this realm, overseen by the king’s representative, the capitaneus Finlandiae. In recognition of the expansion of territory beyond the limits of Finland Proper, Dan Niklisson was named in 1340 as particum orienticum prefectus (governor of the eastern parts), and his successor, Gerhard Skytte, was also named as governor of the Eastland, a term that continued in use until the sixteenth century. The governor was also castellan of Turku castle and had authority over the two other castle\n\nIO\n\nA concise history of Finland\n\nfiefdoms, although the castellans of Viipuri on the eastern frontier were usually able to maintain a fairly independent position as marcher lords. At the end of the fourteenth century, new bailiwicks were created for the ‘New Land’ (Uusimaa, Nyland) on the southern coast, whose skerries and inlets had attracted settlers from Sweden in the previous two centuries, and for the region of Satakunta in the south­ west. This administrative reorganisation was largely the work of the powerful magnate Bo Jonsson Grip, who had secured the Finnish fiefs as a reward for assisting Albrecht of Mecklenburg to the throne of Sweden. Bo Jonsson also pushed the frontier northwards into Ostrobothnia, laying the foundations of Korsholm castle and successfully resisting the attempts of Novgorod to eject his forces. The administration of the Finnish lands was entrusted to mem­ bers of the nobility; and although formidable figures such as Bo Jonsson Grip and Karl Knutsson in the early fifteenth century were able effectively to create their own power bases there, this did not loosen the ties with the rest of the realm. In the words of Eric Christiansen, ‘the effect of this ungovernability was not to separate the province from Sweden, but, rather, to encourage the growth of Swedish institutions as a means whereby local interests could be protected’. Justice was dispensed, disputes settled, and fishing and hunting rights sorted out by a variety of law meetings held in the hundred. The jurymen of these courts were drawn from the local peasantry, though the man in charge of the hundred was invariably a member of the local squirearchy. From 1435, when the land was divided into two circuits, Norrfinne and Soderfinne, an annual high court was to meet in Turku in the week before St Henry’s feast day (18 July). There were several variants of King Magnus Eriksson’s Land Law in circulation, together with the revised codification of the laws issued under the name of King Kristoffer in 1442, and it was not until 1608 that a definitive printed version of the Land Law was available in Finland. Magnus Eriksson’s long reign ended in chaos. His nephew Albrecht of Mecklenburg eventually succeeded in establishing his claim to the throne, but at the cost of major concessions to the magnates, led by Bo Jonsson Grip. Albrecht in turn was out­ manoeuvred by Margareta, daughter of the great Danish king Valdemar Atterdag (1340-75), and wife of Magnus Eriksson’s son\n\nA medieval marchland\n\nii\n\nHakon, king of Norway (1339-80). Having persuaded the Danish nobility to accept her infant son Olav as the successor of Valdemar Atterdag in 1375, Margareta succeeded in having Olav proclaimed king of Norway some ten years later, and was seeking in 1387 to persuade the Swedes to support his claim to the Swedish crown when the seventeen-year-old Olav died. Fearful of the return to power of the Mecklenburgers, the Danish and Norwegian nobility elected to choose Margareta as their regent. The Swedes followed suit a year later, also granting Margareta the right to nominate the future king. It took a further decade to smoke out the last of the freebooters and pirates who had managed to establish themselves on Gotland during Albrecht’s misrule, but, in 1397, Margareta’s appointed heir, Erik of Pomerania, was crowned in the Swedish town of Kalmar as ruler of the three kingdoms. The letter of union which was also drawn up has been the subject of much controversy ever since, in terms both of the form of the document - it was written on paper and signed by seventeen high-ranking councillors from the three kingdoms, none of whom subsequently attached their seals to the document as they promised to do - and the meaning of its contents. It recognised Erik as elected king for his lifetime, and that in the event of the king having legitimate male issue, representatives of the three kingdoms would elect one of his sons as his successor. The union document decreed that each coun­ try was to be governed by its own laws and by native-born men of noble rank, but it sought to close loopholes which would allow lawbreakers sanctuary in one of the other countries of the union. It was also a mutual defence and assistance agreement, and the king was to conduct negotiations with foreign powers in concert with his councillors from the three kingdoms. To a great extent prompted by the shared unfortunate experiences of the previous decades of misrule and unrest, the Union of Kalmar was a project ambitious in scale, and one that soon began to run into difficulties. Margareta effectively ruled the three kingdoms until her death in 1411, and had sufficient authority and power to be able to impose her will. In Finland, for example, she was able to bring fiefs directly under crown control instead of leasing them out to the nobility, and she also sought to claw back tax land which had passed into the hands of the fralse, the upper stratum of society that\n\n12\n\nA concise history of Finland\n\nenjoyed tax-free status in return for providing military services to the sovereign. Erik XIII (1397-1439) endeavoured to follow Margareta’s rather autocratic policies, but soon alienated the nobility of Sweden by appointing foreigners to the principal fiefdoms. Erik’s costly wars increased the burden of taxation, which led to unrest and peasant uprisings. The most serious of all occurred in 1434, when the peasants of the mountainous region of Dalarna on the SwedishNorwegian border rose up under the leadership of a minor local nobleman, Englebrekt Englebrektsson. Although Englebrekt himself was murdered in 1436, Erik was never able to regain control in Sweden, and was to lose the confidence of the Danish nobility as well. Not one of the union kings was able effectively to establish control over all three kingdoms. Sweden proved the most difficult. The intrigues and machinations of a small, closely knit group of magnates made the union unworkable here, and might well have plunged Sweden into an aristocratic anarchy; the consensual princi­ ple not only survived, but was significantly strengthened - in the council of the realm (riksrad), and through the evolution of the estates, meeting in local and, from the mid-fifteenth century, national meetings (riksdag).1 How did these long and wearisome tussles between the union kings and the Swedish magnates affect Finland? The ‘Eastlanders’ played little active part in the great Englebrekt revolt, with the exception of the aged bishop of Turku, Magnus Olovsson Tavast, who was one of the high personages selected to mediate between the king and his Swedish subjects in November 1434. The ‘East­ land’ had been accorded the same right to participate in the election of the king as the other seven law districts of the realm in 1362, when the law-man (lagman) was invited to come with a jury of priests and twelve peasants to the traditional ceremony of electing the king at the Mora stone near Uppsala. Recognising the problems of travel from Finland, especially in winter, the letter decreed that the ceremony should proceed if the Eastlanders’ delegation did not arrive in time, and stipulated that the law-man should ‘do immedi­ ately what he would have done, had he arrived at the right time, the next time he came before the king’. In the late winter of 1457, the council of the realm tried to compel Christian of Oldenburg to make terms concerning the regency before he was officially hailed\n\nA medieval marchland\n\n13\n\nas king, on the grounds that the Finnish delegation would not arrive in time for the ceremony. Christian countered this by ordering the election to take place in Turku. On 24 June 1457, the election of Christian as king of Sweden was duly performed there by members of the council of the realm, the law-men, the chapter of Turku cathedral, the lesser nobility and representatives of the peasants of Finland Proper, and the burghers of Turku. The election in Turku of the king and the formal restoration of the union was above all a political act dictated by a complex struggle for power. In like manner, possession of the Finnish fiefs also bolstered the political position and income of the contenders invariably members of the magnate class, such as Karl Knutsson Bonde and, under King Christian I (1457-81), the Axelsson Tott clan. The rapid extension in the final decades of the fifteenth century of the state of Muscovy, which swallowed up the princi­ pality of Novgorod in the 1470s, and the convoluted politics of the Kalmar union, once more brought conflict to the eastern frontier. As long as the Axelsson clan controlled the key Finnish fiefs and castles, they were prepared to invest in measures to defend their holdings from the incursions of Karelian raiders. But the clan was weakened by death, and by 1483, the man elected regent of Sweden, Sten Sture, had taken over most of their Finnish fiefs. Preoccupied with the threat from Denmark and from his internal enemies in Sweden, Sten was inclined to strip resources away from Finland. The devastation brought about by Karelian and Russian raiding parties deep into Häme and Ostrobothnia from 1495 onwards and the heavy cost of maintaining the army nevertheless severely reduced Sten Sture’s income from his Finnish fiefs. His unwillingness to send reinforcements to relieve the hard-pressed forces defending Finland from Russian attacks brought the army to the verge of mutiny, and helped push the council of the realm into dismissing him as regent. The union was renewed once more with the election of Hans as king, though Sten Sture still retained considerable possessions, including the Finnish fiefs. The newly elected king’s efforts to regain control of some of these fiefs resulted only in his defeat and the return of Herr Sten as regent in 1501. Control of these territorially huge fiefs was an important aspect of the political struggles of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.\n\n14\n\nA concise history of Finland\n\nThe magnates sought to extract as much revenue as possible from them, yet the yoke of feudal servitude never descended upon the necks of the Swedish or Finnish peasantry, as happened to their counterparts to the south and east. For one thing, the crown never abandoned its rights. Although the fiefs were frequently leased out for long periods of time, this was for a stated period, often the lifetime of the holder. Furthermore, the holder was usually obliged to make due provision for the interests of the realm as a whole. In receiving the fief of Kastelholm on the Aland islands in 1485, Nils Eriksson Gyllenstjerna was, for example, ‘faithfully to build and improve the walls and buildings of the said castle of Kastelholm, which are needful for the said castle, to the benefit and use of the crown of Sweden, as he has promised us willingly to do’ in return for enjoying the revenue from the taxes, fees, and fines. In practice, the holding of fiefs was confined to the small circle of powerful nobles who also dominated the king’s council; it did not spread to the lesser nobility. Access to and participation in the processes of royal justice was never supplanted by the law and customs of the manorial court in the kingdom of Sweden. The manorial system was weakly devel­ oped in Finland as a whole, compared with the rest of the kingdom, although it was rather more evident in the fertile south-west. Those who advised or assisted the king by providing men and horses for his wars were known as frdlse (ralssi in Finnish), and were exempt from royal taxes on their land. Entitlement to this claim could be chal­ lenged - Margareta and her son, for example, reviewed the entitle­ ments given during the reign of King Albrecht - and the composition of the frdlse changed considerably over time. It is likely that the number of parcels of land in Finland that could be considered tax exempt (fralsejord, ralssitnaa} was greater than that calculated by the Swedish economic historian Eli Hecksher, but what is beyond dispute is the overwhelming dominance of the peasant farm in Fin­ land, where the tax-paying peasant (skatte-bonde, verotalonpoika) owned some 9 5 per cent of all cultivated land at the end of the middle ages. Of the 250 or so noble manors that were recorded in the early sixteenth century, mostly to be found in Finland Proper and in the more recently settled river valleys along the southern coast, only seven produced an annual income of more than one hundred marks.\n\nA medieval marchland\n\n15\n\nPlate 3 The Castle of Viipuri un the eastern frontier. The tower of St Olaf, seen here in a photograph from the 1930s, was begun at the end of the thirteenth century, and substantially rebuilt in the sixteenth century. Around the tower a substantial fortress grew, protecting the town of Viipuri (now Vyborg), which acquired its charter in 1403. The town and castle endured several sieges. In 1495, as winter approached, the Russians abruptly abandoned the siege when they seemed on the verge of capturing the stronghold. Their withdrawal prompted Bishop Magnus Stiernkors to claim that the cross of St Andrew had appeared in the sky to frighten off the attackers (the decisive assault occurred on 30 November, St Andrew’s day). Another legend attributed magical powers to the commander of the fortress, Knut Posse, who is supposed to have blown up a cauldron stuffed with explosives and an assortment of toads and snakes, causing the besiegers to flee in panic. The town and castle fell to the Russians in 1710, and passed under Russian control thereafter until Alexander I restored the conquered territories of Russian, or ‘Old’ Finland to his newly acquired Grand Duchy in i8iz. During the early decades of Finnish independence, Viipuri castle had a symbolic value as the fortress against the east, as this photograph is intended to show. Viipuri and the Karelian isthmus were lost to the Soviet Union in 1940. Now, they are rather sad and poignant reminders of the past to Finnish visitors.\n\nUnable to live off their estates, the lesser nobility had to secure office, as bailiffs, stewards and in particular, as sheriffs and district judges. Thus was established the tradition of service to the crown that was\n\n16\n\nA concise history of Finland\n\nthe characteristic hallmark of the Finnish nobility until the twentieth century. The policy of alliance with Muscovy contemplated by the Danish kings in their efforts to dislodge the powerful Sture clan and regain control of Sweden certainly did little to win over those with estates and revenues in Finland. The bishop of Turku was an enthusiastic supporter of the idea of a crusade against the Orthodox Russians, favouring a more aggressive policy towards Muscovy than the regent Sten Sture, and engaging in active diplomacy to try and forge a joint front with the master of the Teutonic Order in Livonia. In this, he was ably supported by the archbishop of Uppsala, and lobbying in Rome persuaded Pope Alexander VI to issue a crusad­ ing bull in June 1496 against the enemies of Christianity who, sixty thousand strong, had ‘most grievously destroyed a great part of the dioccsc of Turku belonging to the realm of Sweden, burning churches, desecrating the name of Christ and his saints, killing, robbing, insulting, violating and raping the wives and maidens of these parts, murdering the menfolk and placing the yoke of slavery upon many thousand Christians’.1 There was the threat of a renewed Russian onslaught once the truce of 1497 ran out in 1503, though a twenty-year truce was eventually negotiated with Ivan Ill’s governor of Novgorod by the castellan of Viipuri, Erik Turesson Bielke. In 1510, this was transformed into a sixty-year peace, though the Muscovite side managed to insist on a conference to mark out the frontier according to the terms of the 132.3 treaty. Setbacks in his war against Lithuania obliged Vasili III (1505-33) to agree in 1513 to postpone this meeting for a further five years. The Russian insistence on revisiting the boundaries delineated in the treaty concluded between Sweden and Novgorod in 1323 was in response to what they considered Swedish encroachments in Savo and along the Ostrobothnian coast, but it was also part of a new assertiveness, with Vasili for example ordering taxes to be collected and justice to be dispensed amongst the Sami of the far north. Tensions between the colonisers and the Karelians flared up frequently; there were complaints of Karelians stealing church property at Tornio at the head of the Gulf of Bothnia, and of frequent raids in the Karelian isthmus. Vasili promised to hang those found guilty of such malfeasance, but complained for his part\n\nA medieval marchland\n\ni7\n\nof the continuous raiding of his lands by the ‘men of Sweden’, whilst the governor of Novgorod provided evidence of villages built by settlers from the other side of the frontier. In addition to having to cope with the threat of renewed incur­ sions by the Russians, the eastern half of the realm was also vulnerable to attack from the sea. A strong Danish fleet com­ manded by Sören Norby occupied the Aland islands in 1507, and there were further raids on Porvoo and Turku in the following two years. The newly elected regent, Sten Sture, known as the younger, was quick to ensure possession of the Finnish fiefs, securing the loyalty of the peasantry and nobility of western Finland and mana­ ging to outflank his rival, Nils Bosson Grip, by doing a deal with the widow of the powerful castellan of Viipuri to win that vital fortress to his interest. The castellans of the Finnish strongholds and the local nobility remained loyal to the Sture cause even after its leader had been killed in battle against the force of King Christian II of Denmark in 1520, but the threat of attack from Christian’s Muscovite allies meant that they were unable to offer much assistance to the beleaguered widow of the dead regent. Stockholm finally surrendered to the Danish king in September 1520. After initially offering generous amnesty terms to the leading adherents of the Sture party, perhaps to ensure the peaceful handing over of the Finnish strongholds to his own appointees, Christian compelled the Swedish council and estates to acknowledge him as their lawful and hereditary king and had most of the leading members of the Sture party executed in the infamous ‘Stockholm bloodbath’. Executions were also carried out in Finland by the king’s agent, Rolef Madsen. Christian’s triumph was short-lived. In 1521, the young Gustav Eriksson Vasa, a relative of the Sture clan, raised the flag of revolt in Dalarna, and advanced upon the capital, taking Västeräs in April, and Uppsala in the summer. Gustav Vasa was acclaimed regent of Sweden by the council in August 1521, but his cause suffered a severe setback when the Danish admiral Sören Norby was able to destroy much of his fleet, thereby hindering the rebels’ attempts to blockade Stockholm into submission. Christian was able to use his close connections with the Habsburg dynasty to persuade the emperor Charles V to institute an Imperial ban on\n\ni8\n\nA concise history of Finland\n\ntrade with Sweden. For Gustav Vasa, the financial and material backing of the north German ports, above all Denmark’s old rival Lübeck, was vital. Although he was able to secure the backing of individual merchants, the councillors of Lübeck did not finally commit themselves to the rebel cause until 1522., sending a fleet to Gustav Vasa’s assistance in the autumn. This fleet, with its Swedish allies, inflicted a sharp defeat over Sören Norby off Vaxholm in the autumn of 1522, thus severely weakening the maritime link between the Finnish provinces and the beleaguered garrison in Stockholm. Stockholm finally surrendered to Gustav Vasa in the summer of 1523, shortly after the riksdag had acclaimed him king of Sweden. Christian had already been deposed by a noble revolt in Denmark, and had fled to Holland, leaving his commander Sören Norby to carry on the struggle in the north. Norby rejected Gustav Vasa’s offer of clemency, but a short autumn campaign compelled his forces in Finland to abandon their strongholds and retire. From his base on the island of Gotland, Norby continued to pose a threat to the new order, and the exiled Christian II strove tirelessly to find backers for his cause: but Norby was driven off in 1526, and Christian himself was imprisoned by his uncle and successor as king of Denmark, Fredrik I (1523-33). The end of the union brought out the strategic importance of the Eastland, but also showed clearly that the centre of power lay across the water, in Sweden. In spite of the gradual integration into the realm of the lands along the shoreline of the gulfs of Bothnia and Finland, much of the hinterland remained very much on the periphery, in much the same manner as the regions north of Uppland. Beyond the plains of south-western Finland, where one-third of the total number of Finnish farms recorded in sixteenth-century tax records were located, the forests and the lakes dominated the landscape almost completely. The density of settlement in a farming parish such as Masku, just to the north of Turku, was a hundred times greater than in the remote hinterland settlement of Tavinsalmi in the east. Most of the eighty-odd stone-built churches were located in Finland Proper, Satakunta, and Häme. Four of the six medieval towns, including Turku, and four of the six religious settlements, including the Franciscans on the island of Kökar, were\n\nA medieval marchland\n\n19\n\nMap 1 The kingdom of Sweden in the late middle ages.\n\nhere.3 South-western Finland was in fact on the eastern edge of a belt of long-established permanent settlement that stretched across the central Swedish plains from Vastergotland to Uppland and it had much stronger cultural and economic links with that heartland\n\n20\n\nA concise history of Finland\n\nthan with the hinterland stretching away to the northern and east­ ern horizons. There was nevertheless a steady expansion of the frontiers of permanent settlement throughout the middle ages. New hamlets and villages were created in the core areas of settlement. Colonisers from Sweden settled on the skerries and inlets of the southern coast, establishing a Swedish-speaking presence there that has lasted to the present day. The shores of the eastern Baltic attracted settlers from further afield, in particular, from the German lands. Many entered the service of the crown, but there was also a considerable influx of traders and merchants. The major trading towns of the realm all had a significant minority of burghers of German origin. Nine of the fourteen burghermasters of Turku between 1400 and 1471, and twenty of the thirty-six town councillors, were of German origin; the proportion of Germans recorded on the town’s lists of burghers in the fourteenth century was even greater. Colonisation was actively encouraged by the crown, eager to augment its tax revenues. The costs of defending newly settled areas, such as the lake region of Savo on the eastern frontier, where the castle of Olavinlinna was built at great expense in the 1470s, had the effect, however, of driving settlers further into the forests in search of lands beyond the reach of the tax-collector. The settle­ ment of Savo was particularly vigorous, expanding far beyond the region - to the Ostrobothnian coast and into the wilderness on the northern limits of Satakunta in the sixteenth century, and even across the Gulf of Bothnia to the forests of Värmland in the seven­ teenth century. The colonisation of Savo encroached upon the lands of the Karelians, and a long period of bitter frontier skirmishing followed. By the end of the middle ages, there were four major economic zones of settlement and land usage in the eastern half of the Swedish kingdom. On the hundreds of rocky islands of the south coast, stretching from the shores of the Karelian isthmus to the Aland islands, fishing was the main occupation, supplemented by summer grazing, bird-catching, and egg-collecting. In the wildernesses of northern Ostrobothnia, the settlers reared cattle, fished, and hunted; fields were small and here, too, the cultivation of grain was of negligible significance. Stretching in a great arc from the Karelian\n\nA medieval marchland\n\n21\n\nisthmus through the region of Savo as far as lake Oulujärvi, and across to the northern wildernesses of the Häme region was a zone in which burn-beat cultivation predominated. There were three princi­ pal sub-zones of field cultivation, of which the oldest was to be found in Finland Proper, the southern parishes of Satakunta, and the larger parishes of the Aland islands. In the area of later cultivation, which extended eastwards into the Karelian isthmus and into Häme and the northern parishes of Satakunta, and the third zone in southern and central Ostrobothnia, hunting, fishing, and cattle-rearing (espe­ cially in Ostrobothnia) played a central role in the household econ­ omy. A further zone, beyond the frontiers of settlement and stretching from the Atlantic to the White Sea, was inhabited by nomadic peoples, descendants of the earliest waves of migrants after the Ice Age, who fished, hunted, and herded reindeer. The evidence of place-names indicates that this zone had once been much larger, and it was a useful source of income for the neighbouring peoples, who mounted regular tax-gathering expeditions into the lands of ‘the people who live apart’ (a probable explanation of the term ‘Lapp’). The furs and skins thus procured remained a vital element in the economy of the northern frontier well into the sixteenth century. For families who farmed within the zone of permanent settlement to the south, spring and summer fishing expeditions into the wilderness were also an important means of supplementing food supplies and income. The pike in particular was a much-prized fish, which, in the words of the sixteenth-century cleric and historian Olaus Magnus, ‘not only provide sufficient sustenance for people throughout four large northern kingdoms, but when salted and dried in the sun are exported even farther by ship, stacked like great piles of logs, to be sold across the whole of Germany’. The wilderness, known in Finnish as erämaa, was never very far away from any place of human habitation. Even in the oldest areas of land cultivation, it could be found on the hilly margins. It was a valuable resource in a poor land, freely accessible to all who were able to mark out and claim a defined area as their hunting and fishing grounds. These erämaat were often at a considerable dis­ tance from inhabited areas; in Ostrobothnia, for instance, some two or even three hundred kilometres from the coast. Hunting expedi­ tions into the wilderness began to decline from the sixteenth century\n\nzz\n\nA concise history of Finland\n\nPlate 4 Bum-beat cultivation. The cutting down and burning of selected areas of woodland for the purposes of cultivation was practised for centuries in Finland. The technique varies according to the type of woodland, either mostly deciduous (kaskenpoltto) or coniferous (huuhta). The huuhta technique was highly destructive of the forest, since it allowed for only one crop. Seventeenth-century eastern Finnish settlers in the upland Swedish region of Värmland who took with them their timehonoured practices of land clearance soon ran foul of the authorities, anxious to preserve precious supplies of timber for the iron industry, and many were subsequently bundled off to the banks of the Delaware to try their skills in the forests of the new world. The big advantage of burn-beat cultivation over more conventional methods of land clearance - which in Finland might involve laborious uprooting of stumps, removal of stones, and draining of bogs - was that it produced a crop with relatively little effort. Overall yields on kaski land were probably less than on ploughed land, but land cleared by the huuhta technique - and it took four years from cutting to cultivation - often produced enormous returns in their one season of fruitfulness. As such, it proved attractive to the new settlers of eastern Finland, who were also able to supplement their food stocks by fishing and hunting. Burn-beating was still practised in parts of eastern Finland until the twentieth century, as shown in this photograph, taken in the parish of Eno in 1893 by the ethnographer J. K. Inha.\n\nA medieval marchland\n\n2.3\n\nonwards, as the crown laid claim to the wilderness in order to encourage settlement, and there is evidence of noblemen claiming ownership of tracts of wilderness for possible future colonisation; but hunting and fishing never became exclusive royal or noble privileges, and free access to the wilderness has remained a valued right to the present day. In the course of time, the erämaa might be settled and cultivated, with huts put up by hunters and fishermen to store their gear and provide rudimentary accommodation enlarged into a house and farm. The usual method of clearance was to cut and burn the trees and undergrowth; it was also possible to grow crops on the cleared site, fertilised by the ash. This form of cultivation, known as swidden or burn-beat, has in northern Europe long been regarded as peculiarly Finnish. It is highly likely that some form of burn-beat technique was used to clear land in western Finland in the early middle ages, and was certainly still used to prepare woods for new cultivation in later times, but this was only a transitory step. It did not become the norm for cultivation, as did burn-beating in much of eastern Finland. The wilderness was able to absorb and support the vigorous colonisation of the sixteenth and seventeenth century. By the middle of the eighteenth century, however, as rural Finland experienced a strong population growth, the supply of land suitable for burn-beat cultivation was shrinking rapidly. At the best of times, yields from the land wrested from nature were meagre. As the pressure on land mounted, harvest failures could and did spell disaster for many thousands. Wresting a livelihood from the wilderness, whether fishing, hunt­ ing, or the planting and harvesting of grain, necessitated co-operation and teamwork. As a rule, men hunted, ploughed, sowed, and reaped with the scythe, but there are instances of women doing this work. Indoor work and the dairy were usually the preserve of women, though in eastern Finland, men did the brewing and also prepared meat for the pot. Both sexes participated in land clearance, and in field work. Groups of peasants came together to hunt seals, build boats, fish the lakes, and clear the land. In Häme and western Finland, communally owned mills were not uncommon, with the peasant shareholders each grinding their own corn until millers, paid in hous­ ing, meadowland, hay, fuel, and a share of the grain, began to be\n\n2-4\n\nA concise history of Finland\n\nemployed in the eighteenth century. Many of the seasonal tasks of the farming community, such as harvesting, were shared efforts. These strong traditions of working together for the common good under­ pinned the producers’ co-operatives that took form at the beginning of the twentieth century, and provided a readily understood basis for the great upsurge of the associational activity - religious revivalism, the temperance movement, glee clubs, voluntary fire brigades, the youth movement - of the nineteenth century. Such communal activity was more common in the more popu­ lous regions of western Finland, where the village also functioned as an organisational unit (though far less so than in Sweden). Further east, where labour was at a premium, the family tended to form the basis of communal activity, and it was here that the extended, or so-called ‘big family’ was most commonly found, especially amongst the Karelians around lake Ladoga. These units were amalgams of two or more core families, with their servants and lodgers, living and working together. Big families were most commonly formed by brothers, and were patriarchal in structure. Whereas the Swedish custom of the heir, usually the eldest son, agreeing to provide housing, fuel, and benefits in kind to the head of the family and his wife as a precondition for entering into full possession of the farm had come into widespread use in western Finland by the end of the middle ages, no such provision existed in eastern Finland. Inheritance practices also differed: in the burn-beat lands of the east, the land usually passed to the males in the house­ hold on the basis of their contribution to the work. This meant, for example, that brothers-in-law or adopted children could and did inherit. Women in general did not inherit land, but received a dowry in kind upon marriage. In western Finland, on the other hand, all children had the right to inherit land - according to the medieval land laws, brothers were to inherit two parts to their sisters’ one. Furthermore, the law permitted members of the family to challenge the transfer of an inherited holding outside their own ranks. In general, medieval Finland seems to have been less affected by the great demographic and agricultural crises of much of the rest of Europe. It was largely spared from the Black Death, and there is relatively little evidence of deserted farmsteads, certainly\n\nA medieval marchland\n\n2-5\n\nin comparison with neighbouring Norway. A huge, heavily forested land mass, sparsely populated even in the fixed-field regions of the south-west, it remained on the outer limits of the continental European world vision, even after the publications of the Magnus brothers, the Historia de omnibus Gothorum Sveonumque regibus (The history of all the kings of the Goths and Svea) of Johannes, published in 1554, and the widely read Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus (The history of the northern peoples) of Olaus, published a year later. But the Finns were by no means totally isolated or cut off from the rest of Europe. There is ample evidence of active involvement in trade throughout the southern and eastern Baltic, and trade often acted as the principal filter and disseminator of mainland ideas and innovations to the northern lands. Finns also studied abroad. Two students from the bishopric of Turku were registered at the university of Paris as early as 1313, and a further forty-four are known to have studied there, including three who became rectors of the faculty of philosophy. In the fifteenth century, German universities attracted Finnish students, though some ventured even further afield to Italy. In common with the other peoples of Europe, Finns went on pilgrimage. Saint Birgitta’s encounter in Rome with a man from the diocese of Turku, ignorant of the Swedish language and unable to find in the Holy City a confessor who could understand his language, suggests that even humble peasants might find their way abroad. The church was able to recruit amongst the native population, and to provide an education in the cathedral school of Turku; there were also schools in Viipuri, Rauma, and Porvoo. But with little or no possibility of princely or noble patronage, the Finnish periphery could not com­ pete with richer areas of Europe in the output of verse or chronicles, not even with the Swedish heartland, where a vernacular literature was being created. ‘Where Sweden was poor, Finland was poorer,’ concludes Eric Christiansen, ‘in educated men, in books, in churches, in towns, in arts, in schools’; and this disparity was to endure, colouring the relationship of the two halves of the kingdom and leaving a complex legacy of snobbish superiority on the one side, and resentful feelings of inferiority on the other. The church was the great torchbearer of education and the arts in Finland, and its head, the bishop of Turku, was a figure of\n\n2.6\n\nA concise history of Finland\n\nconsiderable authority. Almost all the last Catholic bishops were members of the leading families of Finland. Magnus Olovsson Tavast (bishop 1412-50) enjoyed an extremely long and varied career, studying at the university of Prague, making a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, serving for a time as chancellor to King Erik XIII, playing an active role in the politics of the Kalmar union, and as bishop, doing much to adorn and beautify the cathedral and churches in his diocese. His protégé and successor, Olaus Magnus (1450-60), enjoyed a glittering career at the university of Paris before returning to Finland in 1437. Konrad Bidz (1460-89) was an active ecclesias­ tical administrator, and instigated the printing in Lübeck of a missal for the use of the Finnish clergy. Magnus Stiernkors (1489-1500) and Arvid Kurck (1510-22) were heavily involved in the political manoeuvrings and diplomatic intrigues of the last phase of the union conflict. Administering to the spiritual needs of the inhabitants of a vast and empty marchland on the outer limits of fixed settlement posed many problems for the church. The settlers of the hinterland were virtually unprovided for; as Bishop Laurentius Suurpää (1500-6) complained, the peasants in Savo lived fifteen or more Finnish miles (one mile was the equivalent of six kilometres) from the nearest church, which meant they seldom or never attended church services and lived in consequence ‘like Lapps or pagans’. ‘Many false gods here / were worshipped far and near’, noted the reformer and bishop of Turku (1554-57), Mikael Agricola, in the preface to his Finnish translation of the psalter, and he went on to list in detail these gods of the Karelians and rhe peoples of Häme. Agricola and his fellow-reformers undertook the task of bringing the people closer to God with much earnestness and zeal, and with the support of the state; but the old beliefs proved difficult to eradicate. Well into modern times, the parish priest continued to struggle against the vestiges of paganism; as late as the 1920s, one of the questions asked of the clergy during church visitations enquired about recent occurrences of pagan practices in the parish. As the new king of Sweden strove to establish his authority, what was the position of that part of his realm that Gustav Vasa in his voluminous correspondence frequently referred to as ‘thetta landsände'? In ‘this end of the country’ there were in the 1550s\n\nA medieval marchland\n\nz7\n\nsome 34,000 farms, a couple of hundred manorial estates, and a handful of towns whose combined population probably did not exceed 7,000, or the population of late-medieval Stockholm. The population and resources of the land had undoubtedly been increased by vigorous colonisation and settlement during the mid­ dle ages, and there were probably slightly over a quarter of a million inhabitants in Finland, or roughly a quarter of the popula­ tion of the kingdom as a whole. The supposed fecundity of Finnish women aroused comment from contemporaries. Olaus Magnus attributed this to the qualities of Finnish beer, and he noted dis­ approvingly that a surplus of strong young women left the shores of Finland annually for Germany to work as servants, when they might be used with profit by the king of Sweden to establish new provinces. This was a land of free peasants, rude and unlettered, but by no means unenterprising. Farmers along the coast built and sailed boats laden with butter, skins, dried fish, and livestock to trade with the merchants of Stockholm, Tallinn, and even further afield; and even though the hunting and trapping economy was beginning to diminish in importance, there was still a flourishing fur trade from northern Russia to the Ostrobothnian coast. The forests provided the materials for buildings, domestic utensils, and farming implements. The only buildings of stone were the steeply roofed parish churches, the handful of castles and monasteries, and the occasional manor-house. A few, such as the dean of Turku cathe­ dral, Pavel Scheel, may have amassed a modest fortune from their economic activities; but there was virtually no conspicuous con­ sumption, no commissioning of works of art, no acquisition of precious jewels, no charitable bequests. The late-medieval paintings that still adorn the walls of many of Finland’s oldest churches reflect a world of simple, humble piety, as do the verses of the Piae cantiones, a collection first published in 1582. It has been suggested that a deep-seated suspicion of wealth and a belief in the honest goodness of poverty, which is revealed in much folk poetry dating back to the middle ages and which was still very much in evidence well into the nineteenth century, was in all likelihood implanted by the mendicant Dominican friars. If so, it reflected no more than the everyday reality of a hard life on the margins of cultivable land.\n\n28\n\nÄ concise history of Finland\n\nThese poems occasionally reveal a perception of Sweden as a distinctly separate entity. Poems from western and central Finland, such as The Widow, see Sweden as a wealthier land. There are bitter hints of Swedish oppression in the poem Magdalene, col­ lected in Häme - the Finnish slave lives on fish-bones left by the Swedes - but this is an isolated example, and there is little evidence of the kind of ethnic hatred expressed towards the Baltic German overlords in Estonian folk poems, for instance. Religious differ­ ences and a long tradition of border raids divided the Finns of Savo and Häme from the Karelians, for whom all within the Swedish realm were enemies of the true faith. The final breaking of the Union of Kalmar and the establishment of the Vasas as rulers of the Swedish kingdom in the sixteenth century inaugurated an era of significant religious, social, and economic change. In the course of his long reign, the first Vasa king, Gustav I, set in train a number of administrative and fiscal reforms which would make better use of the resources of his vast but sparsely populated lands. He also succeeded in breaking the power of the church, which had used its economic strength and spiritual authority to cow and coerce his predecessors of the Sture clan. The removal of Christian II by the Danish nobility enabled Gustav Vasa to establish a bond of mutual interest with Fredrik I, the new king of Denmark, and his successor, Christian III (1534— 59), and he was also able to maintain peace on the eastern frontier until the final years of his reign. Notwithstanding several rebellions, one of which threatened for a time to bring down the dynasty, Gustav Vasa bequeathed to his ambitious sons an independent kingdom where the principle of hereditary succession had been acknowledged by the estates in 1544. In spite of the political and religious upheavals of the next fifty years - Erik XIV (1560-69) was deposed, Johan III (1569-92) provoked religious controversy, and his Catholic son Sigismund was rejected in favour of his uncle, Karl IX (regent from 1594, king 1604-11) - the Vasa dynasty remained in the saddle. In spite of serious challenges to the authority of the crown which had imposed heavy tax burdens on the peasantry to pay for seemingly unending military campaigns, had angered the clergy with its interference in church affairs, and had alienated the nobility, the accession of\n\nA medieval marchland\n\n29\n\nthe seventeen-year-old Gustav II Adolf (1611-32) marked the beginning of a remarkable partnership between ruler and estates which was to help sustain the immense war effort that propelled Sweden to the front ranks of the European powers during the first half of the seventeenth century. Sweden’s rise to the status of a great power on the European stage, however, was to have far-reaching consequences for the eastern half of the kingdom. The frontiers of Finland were also pushed eastward, but the overall effect of this expansion was to push the old core of Finland Proper away from the centre of royal power, Stockholm, and ultimately to expose a periphery poor in resources and manpower to attack from the rising power of imperial Russia.\n\n2 The Swedish legacy\n\nBetween the accession of Erik XIV in 1560 and the death of Karl X (1654—60), hardly a year passed when Sweden was not at war. Five major wars were fought against Denmark during this hundredyear period, with Sweden gradually gaining the upper hand and acquiring territory to the south and west that has remained Swedish to the present day. In the east, Sweden succeeded in expanding a bridgehead in northern Estonia acquired in 1561 to embrace most of Estonia and Livonia by 1629. The virtual collapse of the Musco­ vite state following the death of Boris Godunov in 1605 enabled Sweden to push back the Finnish frontier to the shores of lake Ladoga and to establish a land bridge to the Estonian territories through the acquisition of Ingria. The entry of Sweden into the Thirty Years War in 1629 and the astonishing victories that carried Gustav II Adolf and his forces deep into the Catholic heartland of Germany marked an entirely new phase. Sweden was now able to command lavish French subsidies and make war ‘pay for itself’ by a variety of methods from forced contributions to outright extortion. Its battles were fought by polyglot armies; the men conscripted back home constituted only a small minority of the Swedish forces fighting in Germany. More territory, this time on the north German coast, was acquired in the final peace settlement in 1648. Within seven years, Sweden was once more enmeshed in war, its armies drawn deep into Poland in a bewildering series of marches and battles, and twice flung against the old enemy, Denmark. The subsequent period of peace after 1660 revealed how overstretched\n\n3°\n\nThe Swedish legacy\n\n3i\n\nSweden had become. Careful management of the crown’s resources and a series of military reforms during the reign of Karl XI (1660-97) enabled Sweden to sustain two more decades of war against a wide coalition of forces before the sudden death of Karl XII in 1718 and national exhaustion brought an end to the age of military greatness. The faded banners and trophies of war that adorn the museums and great houses of Sweden are reminders of the glory and renown of Swedish arms across the European continent. Sweden’s expansion was, however, achieved at great cost. The creation of an armed force capable of winning victory on the battlefield and of defending con­ quered territory imposed heavy burdens on a poor kingdom whose total population barely exceeded a million at the beginning of the seventeenth century. Finland’s share of that burden seems to have been disproportionately high. In the five-year period 1626-30, for exam­ ple, of the 51,367 men who were conscripted into the Swedish army through a rote system, almost a third (15,281) were from Finland. Few of those who saw active service in the field returned home (although most died of disease in camp rather than wounds on the battlefield). There was provision for maintaining the conscripts from crown resources, which was placed on a more systematic footing in the 1680s. This proved to be a more flexible and stable system than the costly and often unreliable payment of wages to hired troops, and it established deep and enduring roots in the countryside of Sweden and Finland, where the farms and cottages allotted to the officers and soldiers remained distinctly identifiable as such well into modem times. Wealthier peasants could avoid the rote by agreeing to furnish a horse and rider for the cavalry. The regulation of this method of recruitment at the end of the seventeenth century confirmed the emergence of a peasant elite, the rusthollari, who in return for equip­ ping a horseman and providing him with a cottage and patch of land, were allowed significant tax reliefs. Like the soldiers’ dwellings, the rustholli farms scattered across the provinces of south-western and central Finland were a consequence of the military state created by Sweden’s rulers in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The readiness of the wealthier peasantry to provide horsemen for the cavalry was undoubtedly welcome to the crown, for the obligation of the nobility to do so had been seriously undermined during the course of the sixteenth century. But, as Robert Frost has\n\n31\n\nA concise history of Finland\n\nMap z The frontiers of Finland, 1595-1812.\n\nThe Swedish legacy\n\n33\n\nPlate 5 A sergeant’s dwelling, Juva. The system of recruiting men into the armed forces that evolved during Sweden’s age of greatness rewarded those who served with land and a dwelling, according to their rank. The rank-and-file soldier might expect a modest cottage; officers, who also took on administrative tasks, were often given sizeable two-storey houses with land. The dwelling-house pictured here probably dates from the late eighteenth century, and would have furnished a non-commissioned officer with a large room heated by an oven, in which the family ate, worked, and slept, and one or two small chambers for more private use.\n\nnoted, if the nobility were reluctant to serve out of obligation, they were more than happy to serve for reward. Most were poor. In return for their services as officers, the crown was able to reward them with an income from the land, much of which had passed under royal control as a result of the Reformation. The Finnish nobility in particular took full advantage of this during the long wars on the eastern frontier in the latter half of the sixteenth and early decades of the seventeenth century. Whereas the crown sought to reduce the number of fiefs in Sweden proper, it was willing to increase their number in Finland as a means of paying those mem­ bers of the aristocracy who had distinguished themselves in the king’s service, though it was unwilling to accede to the demands of these fief-holders for further privileges.\n\n34\n\nA concise history of Finland\n\nBy 1600, the number of farms in noble hands had risen sharply from a modest few hundred to over two thousand in Finland. At the same time, there had been a steady decline in the overall number of farms, which meant that the growing burden of taxation fell on ever fewer shoulders. The nobility zealously guarded their right of tax exemption, and their tenants were also not obliged to quarter men-at-arms or provide horses for the army. Others who performed useful military service, such as defending the frontier, were also granted tax exemption on their land. The brutal and arrogant behaviour of the officials who sought to extract taxes and services from those crown or freehold peasants who were unable to obtain such exemptions provoked anger and resentment. In 1589, a dele­ gation of three hundred Finnish peasants betook themselves to Stockholm with a petition for the king, in which they listed at length their grievances. They complained that they were mocked by rich farmers who had taken their farms by deception or bribery, denied justice, and cheated by officials, who lived in luxury whilst the crown’s demesnes were stripped bare. These haughty bailiffs and scriveners created their own retinues, who also robbed, raped, and pillaged the peasantry. In the eyes of the petitioners, official­ dom was one big, corrupt conspiracy that sought to cheat the king and milk the poor: They all band together against the poor peasants, and are further aided by the rich peasants, whom they help with gifts and bribes. Some bailiff’s servants marry the daughters of rich farmers and relieve their father-in-law of the obligation to provide transport and other services, wherefore an even greater burden falls upon the neck of the poor. In such manner do Finland’s officials torment the poor peasant and frighten him with their great pomp, for they travel between their farms with fifty or sixty men, so that simple folk are more afraid of their arrogance than they are of the king himself.\n\nIn spite of royal efforts to relieve the situation, complaints about the exactions of the king’s officials continued, and there were occa­ sional clashes between troops and peasants. At the end of November 1596, a serious revolt broke out in southern Ostrobothnia. The homes of hated local officials were looted and burned, and troops quartered in the district were attacked and driven out. This uprising was bloodily suppressed on New Year’s Eve, and pea­ sants who rose up in Häme and Savo were likewise scattered by\n\nThe Swedish legacy\n\n35\n\na show of force. There was a second uprising in February 1597, this time in northern Ostrobothnia. Although better armed than their predecessors, these rebels were also routed in battle at Santavuori on 24 February 1597. These uprisings, known in Finnish history as the ‘Club War’, took place against a tense political situation. Elected king of Poland in 1587, Sigismund was slow to arrive in Sweden to claim his crown on the death of his father Johan III in 1592; and when he did, at the end of.September 1593, he found it impossible to break the alliance of his uncle, Duke Karl, and the council of the realm. A committed Catholic, Sigismund was obliged to accept the affirmation of the Lutheran faith made at the church council hastily convened by Duke Karl in Uppsala, and to hand over the government of the realm in his absence to the duke and council. Karl, a ruthless and ambitious man, managed to browbeat the council into accepting him as regent in 1594, and although the subsequent riksdag at Soderkoping insisted that he govern with the advice and consent of the council, the duke was more than a match for the aristocratic constitutionalists who sought to bind him. The one notable figure who refused to bend to his will was Sigismund’s commander in Finland, marshal of the realm and admiral of the fleet, Kias Fleming. In order to get rid of Fleming, Duke Karl resorted to all the tricks of which he was eminently capable. He lent a sympathetic ear to the complaints of the Finnish peasantry, issuing letters of protection and promising to do away with the hated practice of quartering troops on their farms. The peasant uprisings in Finland during the winter of 1596-97 kept Fleming fully occupied there, at a time when the struggle for power between the duke, the council, and King Sigismund was very much in the balance. Fleming’s death in April 1597 did not greatly alter the situation. His successor as royal commander, Arvid Stalarm, was obliged to abandon Turku to Duke Karl’s invading forces in September, but easily regained control of the castle after the duke returned to Stockholm. Stalarm’s invasion of Sweden in the follow­ ing summer had to be aborted when the main invasion from the south failed to materialise, and the defeat of the king’s delayed invasion in September 1598 proved to be a fatal blow to Sigismund’s cause. The main Finnish strongholds capitulated to Duke Karl after a\n\n36\n\nA concise history of Finland\n\nbrief summer campaign in 1599. Karl, soon to be hailed as king by the estates of the realm, imposed stiff fines on the clergy, allowed his troops to plunder the farms of those he had not expressly included in his letters of protection, and had those whom he most hated and feared executed in the market place in Turku, after a trial at which the duke overrode all legal niceties. The brutal suppression of the peasant revolt in Finland left a deep impression. The Finnish historian Yrjö Koskinen, who grew up in Ostrobothnia, made frequent references to still vivid folk memories of the gruesome aftermath of the revolt in his pioneering study of the ‘Club War’, published in 1857-59. There were to be no further major uprisings here or elsewhere in the Swedish realm during the next hundred years, even though the fiscal and other pressures on the peasantry in no way diminished. In this respect, the absence of peasant tumults in the northern kingdom was in marked contrast to the revolts that afflicted France, that other great wager of war in seventeenth-century Europe. Why was this so? One obvious differ­ ence is that it is more difficult in a thinly populated land to bring together a sufficient number of discontented people to form the core of an uprising. Those who felt themselves oppressed also had a number of other options open to them. They could and did use the courts, and, as we have seen, readily turned to the king with their petitions. There is evidence to suggest that the king or regent did take heed of these complaints, though how effective their letters of protection or commands were is open to question. In the worst case, the poor farmer and his family might abandon the land, move elsewhere in search of better luck, or simply be swallowed up into the ranks of the landless. The crown showed a willingness to recruit Finns as settlers of the deserted farmsteads of the conquered terri­ tories in Estonia, and there was continued vigorous internal colo­ nisation, which was beginning to push into the territory of the Sami and deep into the forests on the Swedish-Norwegian frontier. And one must also remember that, although for the great majority the demands of incessant warfare bore heavily upon their subsistence economy, there were those who profited or were able to take advantage of chance and good fortune. The intensely religious and nationalistic Yrjö Koskinen did not shrink from claiming that ‘the bloody surge that tossed the Papacy\n\nThe Swedish legacy\n\n37\n\nback to the shores of the Rhine and Danube began as an insigni­ ficant rippling of the water in the marshes of Ostrobothnia’, or that the foundations of Finland’s civilisation were laid at this epochal moment ‘when its sons under Sweden’s banners shed their blood on the battlefields of Europe’. This image of an identity forged in warfare is a powerful and recurring one in modern Finnish histor­ iography. Even before Finland became an independent state, the exploits of fictive heroes in the wars had become an integral part of the national treasury of myths. But Yrjö Koskinen also argued that the conflict between Karl and Sigismund reduced Finland to greater dependence upon Sweden, and that during the subsequent era of Swedish greatness the Finnish language and nationality were further subjugated. Nationalist historians of a later generation also took up Yrjö Koskinen’s suggestion that a sense of national identity existed, albeit rather weakly, amongst the land’s leading people, and they argued that the Finnish nobility developed a distinct and separate set of ‘national’ interests during the long wars against the Russians. The creation of a Grand Duchy of Finland for Gustav Vasa’s second son, Johan, and of a princely court in Turku during the early 1560s to accommodate the ambitions of Duke Johan before he was imprisoned by his morbidly jealous brother Erik XIV, the rapid increase in the number of Finnish military compa­ nies, and of distinctive heraldic devices and escutcheons such as the Finnish lion, gave added substance to these claims. But, whilst it is true that decades of warfare on the eastern frontiers afforded members of the leading noble clans in Finland the opportunity to secure high rank in the army, and considerable rewards for their services, the interests they pursued so vigorously during the reign of Johan III pertained rather more to their rank than to a notion of a separate and distinct patria. The cohesiveness of the Finnish nobility undoubtedly suffered a severe setback as a result of Duke Karl’s vengeful and divisive policies; but the nobility of Sweden also suffered at the hands of the duke, and members of noble families from both halves of the kingdom went into exile in the lands ruled by Sigismund. Between the accession of Gustav II Adolf in 1611 and the peace of Nystad (Uusikaupunki) in 1721, the composition and character of the nobility of the kingdom of Sweden underwent considerable change.\n\n38\n\nA concise history of Finland\n\nIncessant warfare and the crown’s willingness to reward those who could provide useful services opened up the ranks of the aristocracy to newcomers, many of foreign extraction. The number of noble families more than tripled during the reign of Queen Christina (1632-54). There was also a massive increase in the transfer of taxable land to the nobility, with the most powerful families in the realm amassing huge land holdings. The restoration of these alie­ nated revenues, the so-called reduktion of the late seventeenth century, enabled the crown to regain a degree of fiscal indepen­ dence, and it caused some grief to the more recently ennobled who had benefited most from the crown’s generosity, but the nobility remained in possession of their own estates. Few of these estates in Finland were large enough to provide an income sufficient to maintain the standard of living expected of a nobleman. Service to the crown was essential, and in the competition for prestigious posts and high rank, the landed gentry in Finland tended over the years to fare less well than their Swedish counterparts. As part of Gustav Adolf’s general restructuring of the adminis­ tration of the realm, the office of governor-general for Finland was instituted in 1623. This proved not to be a permanent post, and the office-holders were of variable quality. The one whose memory endures in Finnish history is Per Brahe, who held the post twice, in 1637-40 and again between 1648 and 1654. Sweden’s incessant wars had drained and exhausted the eastern half of the realm, and the energetic Brahe found much to occupy him. He devoted much time and effort to improving the administrative and judicial infra­ structure, but he also sought to promote economic development, founding new towns and trying to prevent circumvention of the regulations which were meant to ensure trade remained in the hands of the urban burghers. The extension of the postal network to Finland during Brahe’s first period of office was an important and symbolic link, though the abominable quality of the roads meant that direct sea links to the capital were swifter and more reliable routes of communication for the trading communities along the Ostrobothnian coast. Per Brahe was also one of the moving forces behind the creation of a university, or academy, in Turku in 1640. This, and the estab­ lishment in the same town of a high court for Finland in 1623\n\nThe Swedish legacy\n\n39\n\nundoubtedly strengthened the distinctive identity of Finland Proper. But in other respects, however, Finland Proper ceased to be part of the heartland of the realm, as it had been in medieval times. Turku remained a small provincial town; Stockholm, founded around the same time, grew and became the centre of patronage and influence. In addition to the acquisition of new territories on the southern shores of the Baltic, the Swedish kingdom proper also expanded, to embrace the island of Gotland, the provinces of Jamtland and Harjedalen on the Norwegian frontier and Halland on the west coast after 1645, the west-coast province of Bohus and the rich southern farmlands of Scania and Blekinge after 1660. All this meant that Finland Proper, a region that had been a crucial strategic and fiscal asset in the politics of the Kalmar union period, became not only more marginal to the heartland of the realm, but also now had its own outer periphery to the cast. The sons of the nobility and clergy of Finland Proper were in general less than enthusiastic about starting their career in the eastern wilderness, preferring to hang about nearer the centre of the realm in hopes of preferment. The growth of a centralised administrative system inevitably rein­ forced the importance of Swedish as the language of communica­ tion (although Latin long remained the chief language of education and of culture). An anonymous survey of the kingdom of Sweden, published in London in 1632, is clearly speaking about Finnish speakers when it cites the poor pronunciation of Latin words like gratus (ratus), Dominus (tominus) and spes (pes) as sufficient reason ‘why the Nobles, Merchants, and others of ability, send their youth to be instructed in the Swedish tongue, by which meanes they are afterwards fitted for the learning of any other’, a revealing indication that the swedification of the higher social orders was already under way in Finland. The government for its part was aware of the need to appoint appropriately qualified men to offices requiring a knowl­ edge of Finnish, but the petitions of peasants complaining that bailiffs or judges were unable to understand them and had little or no knowledge of local customs or circumstances - and over half of the district judges appointed in Finland between 1653 and 1680 were of Swedish or foreign origin - tell a different story. The priesthood constituted a second intermediary layer between the common people and royal authority, and was recruited mostly\n\n4°\n\nA concise history of Finland\n\nfrom native-born men. Many clergymen were sons of well-estab­ lished clerical families in south-western Finland, though the church here also attracted bright boys from the ranks of the peasantry. In eastern Finland, the clergy was largely recruited from the clerical and burgher families of Viipuri, which had become Finland’s sec­ ond bishopric in 1554. Some parishes, especially in the vicinity of Turku, offered a comfortable living, but most offered at best a meagre livelihood, which the vicar often had to supplement. A new incumbent might find himself obliged to maintain the family of his predecessor as a condition of entry into the living; marriage to the widow or an eligible daughter was a not uncommon out­ come. Many priests sought to ensure security by having their son trained up for the priesthood in order to succeed the father, and a number of livings in western Finland and Ostrobothnia were occupied by several generations of the same family. The leaders of the Reformed church set high standards of worship and discipline, and frequently expressed their frustration and disappointment that their flock fell far short of these standards. Isak Rothovius, bishop of Turku between 1627 and 1652, strove mightily to enforce church discipline and strict adherence to the true Evange­ lical faith, and did much to improve the quality and training of the priesthood. The ability of the congregation to understand the funda­ mentals of the Lutheran faith was to be strengthened by constant repetition and learning by heart, and if necessary, physical chastise­ ment. In his primer (ABC-kiria, 1543), the reformer Mikael Agricola urged readers young and old who could speak the Finnish language to learn the commands of God and reminded them in good Lutheran fashion that the Law might frighten the soul, but Christ gave it solace. The publication a good hundred years later under the aus­ pices of Bishop Johan Gezelius the Elder (1664-90) of Finnish and Swedish editions of a combined reader and catechism, together with the measures laid down by Gezelius for teaching children to read and write, were slow, however, to bear fruit. Visitation records show disappointingly low levels of literacy, even in south­ west Finland, and priests in charge of confirmation classes continued to rely on learning by heart rather than from the book. Slow, dogged persistence, aided by the stipulation of the 1686 Church Law that confirmation classes be held regularly at suitable locations around\n\nThe Swedish legacy\n\n4i\n\nthe parish, began to yield results, as parishes gradually got rid of their illiterate clerksand even began building special school rooms in which the clerk could teach the basics of reading and writing to the local children. The church was also in the forefront of the expansion of settle­ ment northwards, into the terrain of the Sami people. In the uplands of the far north, as the consistory of Harndsand observed in 1686, the reformation had only recently begun to make inroads ‘and the old worshippers of Satan in that place live on and hobble on both legs, serving Baal and God’. A report submitted to the frontier commissioner in 1748, however, suggests that not only had the Sami in the southern parish of Kuusamo embraced Christianity, but also the Finnish language. Four decades later, the local clergy­ man Elias Lagus noted that Sami was only spoken in the far north of the parish, alongside Finnish. The church made some effort to inculcate Christianity through the medium of Sami, but it was less than tolerant of Sami culture. The burn-beat cultivation methods employed by the Finnish settlers threatened the fragile ecosystem which sustained the local hunting economy; the Sami had either to adapt to the newcomers’ own economy, or move away. By the time the tourists curious to know more about such an exotic people began to make their way northwards in the eighteenth century, much of Sami culture had been lost or destroyed.1 The Lutheran church had more mixed fortunes in its attempts to w"
