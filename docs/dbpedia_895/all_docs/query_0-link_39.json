        "text": "KID RAMOS / BOB CORRITORE\n\nThe Phoenix Blues Sessions\n\n(SWMAF 10)\n\n(1) No More Doggin' (2) Long Time Coming (3) Aw Shucks (4) Possum Up A Tree (5) Natural Ball (6) I Held My Baby Last Night (7) Baby Don't You Tear My Clothes (8) Snakes Crawl At Night (9) Talkin' About You (10) Nappy's Drifting Blues\n\nBob Corritore is a top class harmonica player and Kid Ramos rates in the first class of guitar players. Ramos has been diagnosed with cancer and all proceeds from sales of this CD go to benefit Kid. These takes were recorded in Phoenix in late 1990s and early 2000s on four sessions that featured legendary singers. Some of these songs have been released on previous albums. Anyway, the objective is to support Kid's recovery. Naturally no compromises have been made in the musical quality of this release.\n\nKid Ramos inherited his musical roots from opera singing parents. As a teenager he picked up on the blues and has done impressive work with James Harman, The Fabulous Thunderbirds and The Mannish Boys. Kid has been at his best as a solo artist with four albums and with the Los Fabulocos project which is a rocking mix of American and Mexican music. Bob Corritore visited Finland for the first time last spring playing harp with Tail Dragger at the Stompin' At The Savoy event. Bob is a multitalent who, along with touring writes a regular newsletter and does a weekly radio show.\n\nThese excellent sessions feature vocals from Nappy Brown, Chief Schabuttie Gillame, Big Pete Pearson and Henry Gray, who also plays piano on four tracks. Superb blues drummer Chico Chism plays on all tracks. With a lineup like this you can't go wrong. When he wants to, Kid Ramos plays raw and tough guitar. But here he is laid back, not wanting to take center stage. Same goes for Bob Corritore, who understands the stylish yet distinctive role of the harp. Best on this album in addition to the two featured instrumentalists is Nappy Brown's singing and Henry Gray's piano. Best wishes to Kid Ramos and thanks for the first-class music presented on this CD.\n\nHarri Haka"
