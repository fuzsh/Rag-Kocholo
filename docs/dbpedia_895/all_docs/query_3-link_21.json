        "text": "By Jim Hynes\n\nIt’s getting increasingly harder to hear traditional, real deal blues these days, but fortunately lifelong blues purists, John Primer and Bob Corritore bring us their fourth collaborative effort with Crawlin’ Kingsnake. Blues Hall of Famer Primer, fresh off his recent Grammy nomination for Tears for Magic Slim, continues to tour relentlessly with his Real Deal Blues Band and along with Lurrie Bell and Billy Flynn, is one of the few remaining traditional Chicago blues guitarists. Primer has the pedigree too; having played with Muddy until his death in 1983, preceded by Willie Dixon and followed by a long stint with Magic Slim.\n\nCorritore wears many hats. He grew up in Chicago but has lived in Phoenix for three decades now. He is the proprietor of that city’s most famous blues club, The Rhythm Room. As such, he jams and collaborates with many blues artists. You’ll find Bob’s name on multiple albums because he is one of the top traditional harp players and maybe even more importantly, because he has no problem leaving his ego at the door. Corritore’s acclaimed releases have been nominated or winners of major blues awards. He is also a record producer, radio show host, arts foundation founder, and occasional writer.\n\nThe two play together so comfortably and seamlessly, you’ll feel transported back to the heyday of that Chess Chicago blues sound. They sound every bit as vital as they did on their first team effort eleven years ago. Reinforcing their sound is a “super group” of traditional players – Bob Stroger on the bass, Jimi Primetime Smith on second guitar, Anthony Geraci on the piano, and Wes Starr on drums. They kick off with a vintage Chicago shuffle, “Take a Message,” with Corritore harmonica filling all the spaces surrounding Primer’s gritty vocal. Of course, the harp master gets a chance to display his extensive chops soloing as well as does Primer. The blues standard title track sounds as menacing as any of the countless versions of the tune. If Primer were performing this live, he may well preface it with, “Now, we’re gonna take you back deep in the alley.” His vocals, as on others, sound eerily like his mentor and former bandleader, Muddy Waters.\n\nIn fact, they cover three of Muddy’s tunes. They raise the tempo on “Stuff You Gotta Watch,” making it a joyous romp. Listeners may want the writer’s version on The Muddy Waters’ Woodstock album, performed with members of the Band for comparison. “Rosalee Blues” is a lesser-known Waters tune, a slow blues with Geraci playing Pinetop style to a tee. Primer turns to his slicing, fiery slide guitar in the closing standout “Feel Like Going Home.” We can relive the glory days of those great Muddy Waters’ bands with harp players like James Cotton, Jerry Portnoy and even Little Walter with pianists such as Otis Spann and Pinetop Perkins with these excellent, pure blues tracks.\n\nTrue to form Primer honors another of his mentors, Magic Slim on “Gravel Road,” delivering that vintage, simple but infectious Slim shuffle. While the album has a mix of blues chestnuts and more obscure material, Primer does contribute one original, “Hiding Place,” written and performed, of course, in vintage Chicago blues style, thereby sounding right at home with the repertoire. Primer’s guitar is especially strong on “This Little Voice.” There is one minor quibble, the lack of burning, slow blues among the many shuffles, with B.B. King/Dave Clarke’s “Chains and Things” the only entry there. Aside from that, this is a winner and strong candidate for Best Traditional Blues album in 2024. Primer, Corritore, and the band bring immense vitality to these vintage songs.\n\nOrder link for ‘Crawlin’ Kingsnake’ Here\n\n“Crawlin’ Kingsnake”"
