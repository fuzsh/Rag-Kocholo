        "text": "Harmonica ace Bob Corritore knows how to throw a party. The owner of Phoenix’s renowned Rhythm Room and affable sideman, leader, and collaborator enlists the support of a staggering 39 artists on this effort. Yes, get your magnifier to read the liners. This is Corritore’s 14th career album and perhaps his best, based on the assembled talent and stellar mixing job by Kid Andersen. These are tracks culled from recording session from 2016 to 2018. Corritore calls it his “Harmonica go-go album” as it rightfully carries the vibe of a 1968 live music dance club or juke joint. From fun-loving blues romps to early R&B to early rock n’ roll with a few nods toward soul and gospel, you can practically picture the gyrating go-go-dancers moving to this charged-up music\n\nThese are all covers excepting Corritore’s “I Got the World in A Jug” with Slim Harpo’s title track and Ben E. King’s “Stand By Me” being the most recognizable. Corritore is not a vocalist but can tap the best of them. Alabama Mike on four tracks, the most of any, and is backed by the Andy T Band with Anson Funderburgh on two. Sugaray Rayford has the honors on two including the stirring gospel finale “Keep the Lord with You.” Other notable vocal turns come from 94-year-old pianist Henry Gray doing Cubby Checker’s “The Twist,” John Primer on Muddy Waters’ “Love Deep as the Ocean” and Oscar Wilson on Jimmy Reed’s “Bitter Seed.”\n\nGuitarist Junior Watson joins Rayford for “Trying to Make a Living” and Kid Ramos is aboard for the gospel closer. The other lesser known vocalists who shine are Mighty Joe Milsap from The Fremonts (two tunes), Bill Howl-N-Madd” Perry with a standout “You Better Slow Down” and Jimi “Primetime” Smith on Corritore’s witty original. There’s a banter and background vocals that help to build the party-like atmosphere. Throughout Corritore blows hard, in the company of these blues veterans playing loosely, old school style. There’s no groundbreaking here but these players do dig deep. Keep this one on hand for that first barbecue and tell your guests to bring their dancing shoes.\n\n—Jim Hynes"
