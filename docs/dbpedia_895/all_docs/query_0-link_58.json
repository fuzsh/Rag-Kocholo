        "text": "Bob Corritore’s archive seems to have no end, as he regularly surprises us with the release of a new album belonging to the “From The Vaults” series.\n\nThis new volume gathers some recordings done between 1987 and 2017 by some of the many artists who over the years have performed in his club, The Rhythm Room, or have been broadcasted at his radio show “Those Lowdown Blues” he started in 1984. This time the album is devoted Phoenix area bluesmen.\n\nComing from Chicago, Bob Corritore settled in Phoenix, Arizona in 1981 where he has become a blues icon, recording and playing with all local bluesmen, like singers Tommy Dukes, Chief Schabuttie Gilliame, Big Pete Pearson or Dino Spells. At that time, he also convinced his good friend Chico Chism to come from Chicago to record with him, as well as Sugaray Rayford and Tommy Dukes who lived not far away.\n\nYou will find all these friends in the recording, together with an impressive cast of musicians. It’s hard to name all the musicians who participate in these recordings coming from Bob Corritore’s impressive archive, but I would like to name the rest of the Arizona bluesmen who participate in the album, like Jay Miller, George Bowman, David Riley, George Khoury and Huey Thierry, all of them on vocals. Among the musicians who backed them, mention guitar players Rusty Zinn, Kirk Fletcher, Johnny Burgin, Junior Watson or Chris James, piano players Henry Gray, Fred Kaplan and Matt Bishop, bass players Patrick Rynn, Paul Thomas or Troy Sandow, drummers Richard Innes, Brian Fahey and Rena Beavers, horns by Doug James and, of course, Bob Corritore putting his harmonica in all selected tracks.\n\nTwelve fantastic and genuine blues played with conviction and a terrific feeling by all these magnificent musicians, with Bob Corritore acting as the catalyst of all participant musicians. Like all previous volumes, this collection becomes a must for blues with capital letters lovers."
