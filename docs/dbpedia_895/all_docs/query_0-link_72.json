        "text": "Biography\n\n-2013-\n\nCONTEMPORARY JUKE JOINT BLUES, PERFORMED BY MODERN MASTERS\n\n“I first heard Dave Riley and Bob Corritore perform together at the King Biscuit Festival in 2009. Dave captivated the audience with his original songs, fine Mississippi-flavored singing and guitar, and friendly stage presence. And Bob’s masterful full-toned Chicago harp and strong ensemble playing charged each song with deep blues. Together they have a crafted sound completely unique to these two experienced blues players. This, their 3rd CD, upholds and advances their tour-tested formula. Come and get it from Dave and Bob. It’s not a history lesson or the same old stories. It is modern day down-home juke joint blues performed by two creative masters” ­­\n\n– Bob Margolin\n\nThe “Mississippi meets Chicago” blues partnership of Dave Riley and Bob Corritore is now in its 8th year. This is their 3rd CD together, and they have toured extensively in the USA, Europe and South America. Their stage show is a real down-home blues throw-down!\n\nDave Riley grew up in Hattiesburg, Mississippi before moving to the West Side of Chicago. He worked down South in later years, and was a close associate of Frank Frost, Sam Carr and John Weston.\n\nBob Corritore is a Chicago born and bred harmonica player. He won the 2012 Living Blues Award for Best Harmonica Player. Bob’s Harmonica Blues CD won a 2011 Blues Music Award, he is a recipient of the Blues Foundation’s Keeping The Blues Alive Award and performed on a Grammy-nominated album.\n\nHUSH YOUR FUSS! features original songs, rootsy old-school storytelling blues that puts you in rural Mississippi by way of Chicago, all in the well- honed style of Dave Riley and Bob Corritore"
