        "text": "Sugar Blue\n\n\"Grammy Award-winning harmonica virtuoso Sugar Blue is not your typical bluesman. He wasn't raised on a Southern farm or even on the South Side of Chicago -- he was raised in Harlem, New York. He didn't grow up with blues all around him -- he grew up with the sounds of Billie Holiday and James Brown and all the acts that played the Apollo Theatre. Sugar Blue has used this background to his advantage, though, creating an ultra-modern blues style and sound that is instantly recognizable as his own.\"\n\nKim Wilson\n\n\"Harmonica player, songwriter and singer Kim Wilson is as much a student and historian of classic blues as he is one of the U.S.'s top harmonica players.

Supported by the brilliant lead guitar work of Johnny Whitehill, the assured vocals of Chad Strentz and the bedrock rhythm of bassist Jim Mercer and drummer Martin Deegan, the sound of The King Snakes is the sound of contemporary blues finely-tuned and ready for the next millenium.\"\n\nAdam Gussow\n\n\"Gussow, half of the Harlem-based blues duo Satan and Adam, combines overblowing and legato upper-octave work with tongue-blocking to create a powerful, original style. Instruction topics range from vibrato and warbling to the \"four archetypes\"--warrior, lover, painter, and trickster--that undergird soulful playing.\"\n\nPat Hayes\n\nLead singer, harmonica player, and frontman for The Lamont Cranston Band.\n\nJames Montgomery\n\n\"When blues legend and WC Handy nominee James Montgomery plays the harmonica, he \"brings it on home\".
