        "text": "Willie Smith, Frank Goldwasser, me, and Rusty Zinn at the Mt. Baker Blues Festival\n\nIn 2007 I was invited to participate in a gig at the Highway 99 Blues Club in Seattle to raise money for Curtis Salgado, who had gone through some major health problems. Tons of players, naturally, participated. I got up to do a few numbers. Backing me up were a couple of young Seattle guitarists, Eric Daw and Steve Yonck, who I only knew slightly as relative newcomers on the scene. As we ran through my numbers, I found myself listening to what Steve and Eric were doing behind me. Eric played a Telecaster and had that great stinging sound, while Steve played a gold to Les Paul and had the famous lyrical tone that that guitar is famous four. Their different playing styles and approaches to tone made for a really nice blend, but the thing that really impressed me was how the two of them gravitated to different parts within a bar or two, playing different rhythms and riffs and gravitating to the part of the guitar neck that the other guy wasn’t using. I had been playing in five-piece bands with one guitar for many years, mostly for economic reasons, but I had grown up on the thrilling, seamless two-guitar blues styles of Muddy Waters and Jimmy Rogers on Muddy’s records, and Robert Jr. Lockwood and Luther Tucker, and when I heard what Steve and Eric were doing that night, I got really excited about music again.\n\nAt that time my sons were either in college or headed there, so I saw a window of time I could put behind music for the first time in years. I really missed playing, but I was tired of just throwing together another five-piece band together from the same twenty local guys I had always jammed with to play shuffles and slow blueses at random, rare gigs. Those had become soul-crushing evenings to me; I was better off staying home. If I was going to make a comeback, I decided, I needed to put a damn good, tight band together with some young players who I had never worked with before and rehearse some real material, especially original stuff.\n\nI talked to Eric and Steve about what I had in mind and the rehearsal commitment that at least at first would exceed the actual gigs. They were game. My friend and fellow harp player Mike Lynch told me about a great bass player who had just moved to town named Brady Kish. I went to check him out and he was everything Mike said he was, and a great guy to boot. Billy Spaulding was an excellent Seattle drummer who had a real feel for blues and r&b and who could also sing (I wanted backup vocals in this new band), but he had a reputation for drinking that made some bandleaders leery about him. I did some homework and found out that Billy was six months sober and was really committed to turning himself around. We talked and I agreed to give him a shot.\n\nWe rehearsed for three months before we played out first gig, and as The Mighty Titans of Tone we caught fire from the get go. We played regularly at the top Seattle blues room, the Highway 99 Blues Club, we were one of the few Seattle bands to get several showcase gigs at Seattle’s most prestigious club, the Triple Door, and we played the Winthrop Rhythm and Blues Festival. We began working more and more original material into our act, as I wrote the first originals I had come up with since the Slamhound Hunters and Eric Daw also came forward with some great tunes of his own.\n\nBy 2009 it was clear that we weren’t going to be able to keep the original lineup together. Eric wanted to focus on his career as a guitar tech and luthier and he was interested in moving back to his home state of Idaho. (He did just that. He is now the preferred guitar tech for many world-class guitarists, is selling lots of his own custom guitars, and he and his wife are raising two boys in Sand Point, Idaho.) Billy Spaulding is a fine keyboardist and singer, and he wanted to realize his dream of fronting his own band.\n\nSo I decided to take the Titans into the studio to record an album of my original tunes. We had been performing about seven of my songs and had those pretty well down, but that wasn’t enough for a record. I had to come up with another half dozen songs in a month That was a big challenge for me, but we ended up recording fourteen of my songs and one of Eric’s best tunes and releasing our “Black Diamonds” CD. I remixed those tunes just this year with my friend Al Kaatz.\n\nSeveral other players came through the band in the next few years, including Al Kaatz and Tom Boyle on guitar, and Eric Bryson on bass. For the past four years the second incarnation of the Mighty Titans of Tone has held steady: the great David Hudson on drums, Tim Sherman on guitar (Tim has won the BB Award for best blues guitar from the Washington State Blues Society five times), original member and phenomenal Fender and standup bass player Brady Kish, and our secret ingredient—Bob Knetzger and his amazing pedal steel guitar. (More on him a little further on.) Every three months or so I host Kim Field’s Big Blue Revue at the Highway 99 Blues Club, and for those shows we use the killer Emerald City Horns—Al Keith on trumpet and Brian Kent on tenor. (Brian also writes our horn charts.)\n\nThe Mighty Titans of Tone still plays regularly in the Pacific Northwest. I’m so proud to have been able to play with such fine musicians and great people.\n\nSee “The Mighty Titans of Tone” section of this web site for more information about the band, music samples, and a photo gallery.

Merle was the perfect entrée; he led me quickly to blue yodeler Jimmie Rodgers, the godfather of country music, honky-tonk originator Lefty Frizzell, and western swing genius Bob Wills and his cosmically talented band. I remember listening constantly to Hank Williams in college. Johnny Cash was a revelation; I still consider him one of America’s greatest folk singers. George Jones made my hair stand on end, but he has that effect on everybody. Willie Nelson’s eccentric singing and stellar songwriting were great. Being a harmonica player, I followed Charlie McCoy closely; his work with Area Code 615 was particularly innovative.\n\nI saw a lot of country shows over the years. I finally saw Merle for the first time in the Felt Forum in New York City when I was in college. He was the young Merle Haggard then, and I saw him many, many times over the years—every show I could get to. I stood in line at the Holiday Inn in Everett, Washington to get Ernest Tubb’s autograph. I saw Marty Robbins open for Merle once; he sang beautifully but was one of the most offensive performers I’ve ever seen. I sat in a booth with Dave Dudley between his sets at the Casino Tavern in Washington. Tiny Moore, who played with Bob Wills, came through Seattle with his fiddle and electric mandolin. I already mentioned seeing Gram Parsons with Emmylou Harris on their only tour; when Emmylou brought her Hot Band through Seattle a year later I was in the front row. Waylon Jennings did a killer show at Max’s Kansas City in New York with Ralph Mooney on pedal steel and the amazing Donnie Brooks on harmonica. I was in the audience for a really strong show from Tammy Wynette not long before she died.\n\nI finally got to Nashville in 1977 and caught an Opry show—Hank Snow was still hosting a segment then. After the show I grabbed a bite at a Bob’s Big Boy restaurant. I stood in line at the cashier to pay my bill and realized I was standing behind singer Dottie West and Weldon Myrick, the house pedal steel player on the Opry and with Area Code 615. I introduced myself to Weldon, who seemed astonished that someone had recognized him. Eleven years later I visited the harmonica player Herman Crook in Nashville. Herman was in one of the original five bands chosen for the Opry in 1924, and he still played every Saturday night on the show. Herman got me backstage, where I hung out with Little Jimmy Dickens and watched all the great pedal steel players from the wings.\n\nThere were country bands in Seattle like Ranch Romance and Stampede Pass that I sat in with on harmonica on occasion. At home, I was learning some rudimentary guitar and singing Merle Haggard tunes, but professionally I was a blues harp player and singer who dreamed about being in a really good country band. I finally got my opportunity in 2011 thanks to Lisa Theo."
