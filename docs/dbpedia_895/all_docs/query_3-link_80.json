        "text": "Somebody Put Bad Luck On Me\n\nVizzTone, 2023\n\n9/10\n\nListen to Somebody Put Bad Luck On Me\n\nBob Corritore has some talented friends, and they all bring their inimitable skills to these 16 songs that were recently recorded, which hosts Corritore’s harmonica prowess front and center.\n\n“This Little Voice” begins the listen with Corritore’s bright harmonica alongside John Primer’s smooth and fluid singing in the timeless blues climate, and “I Need A Whole Lotta Lovin’” follows with a retro rock’n’roll spirit that welcomes Thornetta Davis’ powerful and soulful pipes to the piano fueled delivery.\n\nFurther along, Tia Carroll’s animated pipes populate the rhythmic “I Want To Be Loved”, while the raw “Goin’ Fishin’” recruits Sugaray Rayford’s talk singing to the vivid storytelling of the rugged formula.\n\nCloser to the end, Corritore’s unmistakable harmonica playing suits Carl Weathersby’s husky pipes for the groove filled “I Don’t Know”, and “Let Me Find Out Your Name” exits with Willie Buck’s warm voice guiding the sturdy blues rock.\n\nCorritore’s recent ‘From The Vaults’ has illuminated songs from the past, but this time we’re treated to some of the best in today’s blues scene, where the rotating cast of singers makes each track shine in its own light."
