        "text": "Chicago guitarist/vocalist John Primer has traveled a legendary path in the blues to become a legend in his own right. Born in Camden, Mississippi on March 5, 1945, John relocated to Chicago with his mother in 1963. John’s blues career started in 1974, playing guitar alongside Sammy Lawhorn in the house band at Theresa’s Lounge on Chicago’s Southside. It was there that John backed up Junior Wells and James Cotton on a nightly basis. He then joined Willie Dixon’s Blues All-Stars for a brief stint before joining the Muddy Waters Band for 3 years (until Muddy’s passing), and then a 14 year run with Magic Slim & The Teardrops. During his time with Slim, John also served as an A&R man for Wolf Records, organizing numerous recording sessions with various Chicago artists, providing a important documentation of that time period. Wolf Records launched John Primer’s solo career with the 1991 release of Poor Man Blues and John has not looked back since. While touring the world extensively and releasing a steady stream of high-quality releases, John has somehow found the time to collaborate with Bob Corritore. Though they both travel in different orbits, when they do get together, they celebrate their common bond of Chicago Blues with some critically acclaimed recordings and live performances. John Primer has just released a brand new album Sept. 2022, Hard Times. These 13 hardcore, traditional, real deal Chicago Blues songs come straight from the heart and reflect John Primer’s 2 time Grammy Nominated status.\n\nJohn says “This Hard Times CD was made to get us through these hard times we are living in today. It will heal you from beginning to end and will take you to a better place.”\n\nBob Corritore is one of the most active and highly regarded blues harmonica players on the scene today. His style passionately carries forward the old school of playing that Corritore learned as a young man directly from many of original pioneers of Chicago Blues. His sympathetic, yet fiery harmonica playing is featured on over 100 releases to date, on labels such as VizzTone, Delta Groove, Delmark, HighTone, HMG, Blue Witch, Blind Pig, Earwig, Ruf, Putumayo and many others. Many of Bob’s acclaimed releases have been nominated or winners for various Handy, Grammy, Living Blues, Blues Music Awards and Blues Blast Music Awards. Bob is also widely recognized for his many roles in the blues, as band leader, club owner, record producer, radio show host, arts foundation founder, and occasional writer. His amazing website http://www.bobcorritore.com and his weekly e-newsletter reflect a life thoroughly invested in the blues."
