        "text": "Interview with harmonica player Bob Corritore, one of the most active and highly regarded bluesman on the scene today.\n\nWhat do you learn about yourself from the blues and what does the blues mean to you?\n\nThe blues means everything to me. I have grown up loving this music and making friends with some of the greatest of blues musicians. Most of life’s lessons have been learned in the context of this music. The greatest life lesson I have learned is to follow your heart and to believe in yourself.\n\nHow do you think that you have grown as an artist since you first started making music? What has remained the same about your music-making process?\n\nI feel like I am a lifelong student and I learn and explore music everyday. And I also consistently play with all of my heart and soul. Each live performance, rehearsal, or recording seems to show me something different about myself. What has changed is that with every passing year I feel that I’m a little better I getting my artistic expression across. I have been blessed with some great opportunities and I always try to live up to these cherished moments.\n\nCurrently you’ve an album with Bob Margolin. How did that relationship come about? Do you have any interesting stories about the making of the new album “So Far”?\n\nI first became aware of Bob Margolin in 1974 when the Muddy Waters Band played a concert at my high school gymnasium! Muddy and his band were simply incredible, and I looked on at them in awe. Little did I know that Bob Margolin and I would become great friends and eventually tour, record, and travel the world together. Over many years, I used to go see that band whenever I could and I mostly hung out with Jerry Portnoy (Muddy’s harmonica man), and I really did not get to know Bob well until much later. It wasn’t until the late 80s in Phoenix that we started working together. The Phoenix Blues Society put on a show dedicated to the music of Muddy Waters and Howlin’ Wolf. Bob Margolin was the featured out of town guest and I was playing in Chico Chism’s band and Chico was Howlin’ Wolf’s last drummer. That show was our first time playing together! Bob Margolin was quick to respond to my traditional Chicago Blues playing and I was delighted to play with this great musician who I admire. Every time that Bob Margolin came to town after that he always invited me to his stage. In 1996 Margolin and I did our first of many recording sessions together backing Henry Gray. The session was spectacular! In 2007 Bob Margolin was a special guest of my band project with Big Pete Pearson for a small tour of Europe that included the Lucerne Blues Frstival in Switzerland. Margolin and me eventually started a band project called the Bobs Of The Blues with Bob Stroger and various drummers. We just played the Northwoods Blues Festival in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin with Kenny Smith on drums. We love working with Kenny when the scheduling works out. Bob Margolin and me have done numerous shows together all around the world and have made lots of recordings over many years. So, our latest recording project was appropriately titled So Far! I have to say so far so good!\n\nWhy do you think that the Acoustic Blues continues to generate such a devoted following?\n\nSince So Far is my first all acoustic album project I really can’t speak from experience. Bob Margolin and I hope that we can do some acoustic shows in this format. I have to say that I really enjoyed exploring the acoustic approach to playing. Since Bob Margolin and I have been playing together for years we have a natural fit. So when he approached me with this project, I was happy and honored to sign on! For a harmonica player, acoustic playing has lots of hand effects and microphone dynamics. It’s much different than playing amplified harmonica.\n\nWhat moment changed your life and career the most? What do you think is key to a blues life well lived?\n\nThe first time I heard Muddy Waters on the radio was a complete life changer. I found complete satisfaction in his music. From that moment forward my life was going in that direction.\n\nAs far as your question how to lead a well lived blues life. I think it’s important that if you are involved in blues music, you must realize that you’re dealing with a genre that is not in the mainstream. I think that if you adjust your expectations to that reality, you can enjoy its many offerings with satisfaction. Nobody is getting rich off of blues music that I know. But we all get to live very rich lives filled with music, friendship, growth and travel. Over the years I have developed a strong and dedicated fan base that celebrates my achievements and encourages me. I’d like to think that I create music that touches people and gives them joy. As I get older, I miss the many great veterans that have left us, but I cherish their memories and the lessons learned. And it’s encouraging when the younger artists tell me that I have inspired them. It’s very gratifying when you can make music that’s important to you and then becomes important to others.\n\nWhat has been the hardest obstacle for you to overcome as a person and as artist and has this helped you become a better blues musician?\n\nThe music industry is a very competitive industry and though I have received lots of encouragement along my path there certainly have been lots of obstacles. My first obstacle was with myself. I had to achieve a level of skill that I thought was worthy of the sacred music that I was playing. The second obstacle was to convince the world around me that I was serious and that I had a place in this music. The third obstacle was to create a strategy to achieve the upward momentum of being an internationally accepted recording and touring artist. I am 65 years old now and I look back at the yearning and the struggle I went through and all of it made me stronger, better and more confident.\n\nWhat´s been the highlights in your life and career so far?\n\nThat’s a really tough question. It seems like each phase of my life has its own highlights.\n\nSo here is a small summary which is far from listing everyone and everything. In 1973 I sat in a set with John Henry Davis on the legendary Maxwell Street. In 1974 at age 18 I was able to get into the Chicago blues clubs and harmonica master Little Mack Simmons invited me on stage to join him for two harmonica instrumentals. This was my first time playing a Chicago Blues Club. Not long after that I got to sit in with The Aces (Little Walter’s legendary band) at the regular blue Monday jam session they hosted at Louise’s Lounge on Chicago’s south side. In 1980 I was hired as the harmonica player in Willie Buck’s band with also included Louis Myers, Dave Myers, and Big Moose Walker! That was some top shelf stuff and a real coming of age for me. I moved to Phoenix in 1981 and in early 1982 Louisiana Red came to Phoenix and stayed with me for most of a year. Playing with Red was so incredibly heavy. In 1984 I started my weekly blues radio show which is still going on! In 1986 Chico Chism (Howlin’ Wolf’s last drummer) moved to Phoenix and we worked together for the last 20 years of his life. In 1991 I started my music nightclub called the Rhythm Room. In 1992 and 1993 I got to do some short tours with the legendary Jimmy Rogers! That was a dream come true! In 1996 I began working with legendary piano player Henry Gray. We had an almost 25 years run of working together before he passed away in 2020. In 2005 I performed in Europe for the first time at the Marco Fiume Blues Passions Festival in Rossano Italy. Playing in Europe opened up a whole new market for me. I have been back to perform in Europe many many times! Over the years I have been blessed to perform numerous Muddy Waters tributes at various festivals. Always a highlight to be included in honoring the wellspring of my inspiration. I also feel blessed to work closely with other great artists such as Dave Riley, John Primer, Jimi Primetime Smith and of course Bob Margolin! And this latest album with Bob Margolin is my 20th release! All this so far and I’m not done yet!"
