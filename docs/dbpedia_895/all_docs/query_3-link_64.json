        "text": "Description\n\nHarmonica player/producer Bob Corritore lovingly assembled this collection of old school down home Southern blues and juke joint dance numbers, the rough-edged predecessors to modern Chicago Blues, all recorded in Phoenix, Arizona between 1995 and 2012 and drawn from Bob's vast vault of recordings.\n\nWhen the 25-year-old Bob Corritore moved from Chicago to Phoenix in 1981, he was soon joined by old friend Louisiana Red, and before long they were playing all over town. Bob started a weekly blues radio show, and in 1991 he opened the now legendary blues club the Rhythm Room. He would book his favorite blues artists at the club and arrange a recording session, capturing numerous amazing performances, now available via Bob's 'From The Vaults' series. This album features exuberant performances by Honeyboy Edwards, T-Model Ford, Henry Townsend, Big Jack Johnson, Robert 'Bilbo' Walker, Smokey Wilson, Tomcat Courtney, Dave Riley, Pecan Porter, and Al Garrett."
