        "text": "Label: Vizztone\n\nRelease: 17 juni 2022\n\nLongtime friends and heroes in the Blues World, Bob Margolin and Bob Corritore collaborate here on an acoustic duo album for the first time. Special guest guitarist-vocalist Jimmy Vivino graces two songs. Bob M wrote seven new songs and Bob C marches an original instrumental. They also cover some of their favorite songs. Bob M’s 1935 acoustic guitar and Bob C’s un-amped harp reveal personal, intimate performances informed by decades of friendship and gigs together.\n\nIt all started when Bob Corritore saw Bob Margolin playing in Muddy Waters’ band at his high school in 1974. They have both pursued such an intensely directed path in the Blues, it seems like this meeting was inevitable. Now here they are, So Far…\n\nBoth Bob Margolin and Bob Corritore have a busy performance calendar, but they’re planning to carve out some time to celebrate the new album together – so look for some acoustic duo gigs coming soon!\n\nBOB MAGOLIN was born in Boston in 1949, played in local Rock and Blues bands until he was hired by Muddy Waters in 1973. He spent seven years at Muddy’s right side, playing on Grammy-winning albums and star-studded shows including Martin Scorcese’s classic film of The Band’s farewell concert experience, “The Last Waltz.” In 1980 Bob started touring with his own band and doing special shows and guest appearances with many well-kown artists from the Rock and Blues Worlds. Bob released his own albums on Powerhouse Records, Alligator, Blind Pig, and Steady Rollin’/VizzTone, (of which he is a founding partner). He produced and performed on albums for countless Blues artists and produced and consulted on Muddy Waters reissues or the Blue Sky label (Sony/Legacy). Bob appeared at a Kennedy Center tribute, scripted and appeared in instructional videos for Hal Leonard Publishing, and wrote and released the e-Book, “Steady Rollin’”. Bob has played on several Grammy-winning recordings, won numerous W.C. Handy/Blues Music Awards for his playing and producing, and is a Keeping The Blues Alive Award recipient for Journalism. Bob appeared in and toured with the star-studded “Last Waltz Tour” productions led by Warren Haynes in 2017 and and 2019, which currently gearing up for 2022. Bob tours constantly, all over the world, wherever his road takes him.\n\nBOB CORRITORE was born in Chicago in 1956, and heard Muddy Waters on the radio at age 12, an event which changed his life forever. Within a year he was playing harmonica and collecting blues albums. He saw blues shows in his early teens, and cut his teeth sitting in on Maxwell Street until he was old enough to get in the clubs. He hung around great harp players such as Big Walter Horton, Little Mack Simmons, Louis Myers and Junior Wells, and received harmonica tips and encouragement from many of them. Bob became friends with many blues veterans, working with many of them in the late 70s and 80s, and going into the studio to produce some classic albums. In 1981 Bob ventured southwest to live in Phoenix, Arizona, where he was soon joined by Chicagoland friend Louisiana Red. Bob started his still-running Blues radio show in 1984, and in 1991 opened the now famous Blues and Roots Concert club, The Rhythm Room. In 1999 Bob released his first CD as a national recording artist. His many albums have now been released on Hightone, Blue Witch, and Delta Groove, and digging into his vast vault of recordings, Bob has released 10 albums since 2018 through his own Southwest Musical Arts Foundation in affiliation with VizzTone. Bob’s work has garnered a Keeping The Blues Alive Award, Blues Music Award, Living Blues Award, and Blues 411 Jimi Award. Bob remains very active with his own releases as well as numerous guest appearances on others’ albums. He performs regularly across the country and around the world with numerous projects. Bob has also become well known for organizing multi-artist showcase sets and events featuring traditional blues artists.\n\nOok op Blues Magazine ..."
