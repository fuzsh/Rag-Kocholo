He developed his style from listening to many of the original pioneers of Chicago Blues. Between his own releases and as a sideman for other artists, Bob has performed on over 100 LPs. Bob’s worked with loads of guests we’ve had here on Everyone Loves Guitar including Bob Margolin, Dave Mason, Kid Ramos, Sugaray, and others. Many of the albums Bob has play on were nominated for or winners of various Handy, Grammy, Living Blues, Blues Music Awards and Blues Blast Music Awards. Bob is a non-singing blues harmonica player and the things he’s accomplished are a testament to his sense of hustle and his work ethic.Subscribe & Website:  https://www.everyonelovesguitar.com/subscribeSupport this show: https://www.everyonelovesguitar.com/support",
