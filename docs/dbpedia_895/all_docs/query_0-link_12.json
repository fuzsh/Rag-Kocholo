We all have many different opinions about harp but are all family, and if one of us goes down, we all get together, so please help out if you can. The list of players on this project is kind of like a player's dream team. Charlie Musselwhite, Kim Wilson, Jason Ricci, Adam Gussow, Joe Filisko, Aki Kumar, Bob Corritore, Vicent Bucher, Marco Pandolfi and many more. All proceeds go to Phil who has given the okay for the project.
