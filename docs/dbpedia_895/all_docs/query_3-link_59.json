        "text": "Robert Joseph Corritore, musically known as Bob Corritore, discovered blues in his hometown Chicago. Aged twenty-five he settled in Phoenix, Arizona where he has done countless blues-related activities, as well as putting Phoenix in the blues map. Besides an excellent harmonica player and producer, Bob also runs his blues club, The Rhythm Room, and hosts his own radio show.\n\nDuring his early years in Phoenix, Bob regularly played with Louisiana Red and drummer Chico Chism. Then he started his radio show and, in 1991, he opened his blues club. All the great names of actual electric blues have been there, musicians who have also recorded in countless sessions arranged by Bob, known as “From The Vaults”.\n\nThis album is a superb example of these sessions where, together with Corritore on harmonica, you will find well known respected musicians like Honeyboy Edwards, T-Model Ford, Henry Townsend, Big Jack Johnson, Robert “Bilbo” Walker, Willie “Big Eyes” Smith, Patrick Rynn, Chris James, Johnny Rapp, Smokey Wilson, Tomcat Courtney, Dave Riley, Pecan Porter or Al Garrett among others.\n\nThirteen deluxe songs where the most real down-home blues sounds are displayed on a magnificent, genuine and totally passionate way. From the first album notes you will taste and breathe the whole spirit of a music that, despite time goes by will never die."
