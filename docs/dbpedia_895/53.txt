As one of the top blues harmonica players in the world, Chicago area native Bob Corritore travels the world playing the music he learned to love as a teenager growing up in Wilmette. Now living in Phoenix, Corritore also owns "The Rhythm Room," a club specializing in blues and roots music. Corritore also has a regular blues show on a Phoenix radio station, and is an enthusiastic blues ambassador and historian. On this edition of GLT's Talkin' Blues, Corritore talks to Jon Norton about hearing the blues as a teen. He also talks about the valuable lessons he learned by visiting his favorite blues artists on Chicago's tough west and south sides. Corritore performs at the 2016 Blues Blast Music Awards September 23, where he's also nominated with his collaboration with Henry Gray for "Historical Or Vintage Album."
