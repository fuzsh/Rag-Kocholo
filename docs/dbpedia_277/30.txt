Iero, who has been involved with many bands (Pencey Prep, Hybrid, Sector 12, I Am a Graveyard, the Pole Smokin’ Five, Give Up the Ghost, Reggie and the Full Effect and a Cure tribute band called Love Cats) but never as a lyricist. So being the face of Leathermouth was going to be a change of pace for him. He wrote all the lyrics in a week. “Two songs on the record, one’s called ‘Murder Was the Case They Gave Me’ … and the other one’s called ‘Bodysnatchers Forever,’ and it was weird, man. I was sitting in my apartment, playing the songs, and the words kind of came to me, and I was really proud of them too.”

Iero had never felt the urge to pen prose for any of his bands’ songs before, because he said he was “always very fortunate to be in bands with people that I felt were very poetic. I always felt like the voice that I would put across would be through the music end of it. The music end was kind of taken care of [with Leathermouth], so I did the lyrics.”
