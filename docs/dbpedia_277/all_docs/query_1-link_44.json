        "text": "Last November, the early 2000s New Jersey punk rock band Pencey Prep resurfaced with a surprise merch drop.\n\nBefore they disbanded in 2002, Pencey Prep consisted of Frank Iero in his pre-My Chemical Romance days, John McGuire, Neil Sabatino, Shaun Simon, and Tim Hagevik. They released their one and only full-length album, Heartbreak In Stereo, in 2001.\n\nThe merch drop, which was released via Iero’s Kings Road Merch webstore, included a limited run of t-shirts, a pullover hoodie printed on Champion, and the long-awaited vinyl pressing of Heartbreak In Stereo (limited to 1000 copies). Although everything sold out, Iero took to social media last night to announce that they will be doing a very limited repress of the hoodie.\n\nPre-orders are now available as of 12 p.m. EST and will end on Sunday, February 7 at 11:59 p.m. EST. As per Kings Road Merch, the intended release date of the hoodie will be February 26."
