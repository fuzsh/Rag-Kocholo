However, there is no sound attached to the video, which is leaving fans begging for more.\n\nIn the post, Iero shouts out Pencey Prep bandmate John “Hambone” McGuire. However, according to the comments, the video may have been taken prior to the start of Iero’s “official” first band.\n\nRead more: Travis Barker says new blink-182 record will be out before Warped Tour\n\nThat said, it looks like this footage could be taken from another project, Sector 12. In a comment, Nada Recording Studio say that they have old recordings of the band’s work.\n\n“I still have the old Sector 12(?) tapes and mixes,” Nada Recording Studio says in a comment.\n\nWhile fans are begging Iero to release the audio, it doesn’t look like we’re going to get it.\n\nIn a comment, Iero responds to Nada Recording Studio with, “Hahahah no way!!! Set them on fire and bury them in an unmarked grave.”\n\nHowever, while the photo appears to be from Iero’s pre-Pencey Prep era, Iero doesn’t say which project the footage hails from. Instead, Iero tells the story about how he and McGuire met.\n\n“I found an old box of vhs tapes this weekend. Lots of crazy memories flooded back. One of the tapes included the first show I ever played,” Iero says in the Instagram post. “I was a freshman in high school and I met @johnhambonemcguire who was a senior, he told me we were starting a band and that he booked us a show at our school for the junior ring dance in a month. I wasn’t old enough to stay the whole night, but I got to play the show and the rest, as they say, is history.”\n\nRead more: Bowling For Soup, Reel Big Fish announce co-headlining tour\n\nYou can check out the Instagram post below.\n\nNada Recording Studio is the same studio that released recording footage from My Chemical Romance’s 2002 album I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love back in 2013.\n\nRead more: Yelawolf calls out MGK, Post Malone, more on freestyle\n\nNot long ago, Iero shared a photo of the original Pencey Prep lineup to Instagram.\n\n“Fun times, definitely not a fun gig,” Iero says in the post. “Thank you @johnhambonemcguire’s friend Natalie for supplying the picture that jogged a million memories.”\n\nWould you like to hear what Frank Iero’s first live show sounded like?
