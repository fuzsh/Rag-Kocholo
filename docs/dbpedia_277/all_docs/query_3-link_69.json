        "text": "MCR STORY\n\nThe band technically got started when Gerard started writing songs, calling over buddy Matt Pelissier to help out. Ray hadn't been playing guitar seriously for about three years, but went over there anyway to check things out. He went to practice in their attic and ended up being blown away by the style of music and writing Gerard had done. It was a real dark, edgy theme, still containing a slight pop element. After a couple weeks a practicing there was an obvious energy they felt playing together. The band’s name comes from an Irvine Welsh novel, and was suggested by Gerard’s younger brother, Mikey. The younger Way brother started playing bass with them, and soon they got Frank a couple months later to fill out the other guitar spot. He happened to be in another band that had helped them get some of their first shows. When the band broke up their first instinct was to use him. Frank was already a fan of the band and an excellent guitar player. They were all in that stage of their life where you are kind of at that crossroads where you can either go one way or another. It worked out that they could all come together and form My Chemical Romance. They were extremely lucky to find each other and are even luckier to be where they are now. Making It Big Gerard Way (vocals), and his brother Mikey (bass), are two of the group members, as well as Frank Iero (guitar), Ray Toro (guitar) and Bob Bryar (drums). This particular band says they emerged from the New York/New Jersey Punk Scene, which had a major influence on them as teenagers. Guitarist Frank Iero has been in bands since he was 11 years old, being allowed to practice in the basement as long as his schoolwork was getting done. My Chemical Romance has been through a lot of labels, first being called \"emo\", moving onto \"vampire and zombie\" rock. They believe if you like the record, you like it, whatever it is. Their sound has been describes as Queen meets the Misfits. The band has been banned from Orange County, CA. My Chemical Romance were the surprise breakthrough act of 2005, gaining themselves the highly coveted support slot on the last Green Day world tour. Following the success of \"Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge\", the band began recording their follow-up record in April of 2006. Tentatively titled \"The Rise And Fall Of My Chemical Romance,\" the real title, \"The Black Parade\" was announced in August of 2006 by Gerard while performing at the Hammersmith Palais in London. Having reached the #1 chart position in numerous countries and selling over $380, 000 copies in it's first week alone, The Black Parade is set to define My Chemical Romance as the artists for the new generation.\n\nI Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love My Chemical Romance's first record, \"I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love\" debuted in 2002, was a worldwide attention grabber, featuring thirteen original songs by a group that's been on tour for the latter part of two years. They have gained a respectable following in North America and Europe. I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love is a concept album, and the debut album by My Chemical Romance, released in 2002. The storyline continues in Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge. The copyright of Bullets reads:\n\n© 2002 EYEBALL RECORDS/ MY CHEMICAL ROMANCE. UNAUTHORIZED DUPLICATION IS A VIOLATION OF APPLICABLE LAWS AND WILL RESULT IN GERARD COMING TO YOUR HOUSE AND SUCKING YOUR BLOOD\n\nThree Cheers for Sweet Revenge To make their second album Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge, MCR (as most people call them nowadays) had to pull themselves off the road that had accompanied them for so long. It was the only way they could have put out a decent record, and, oh boy, was it decent. \"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge\" is what everyone's calling \"violent, unsafe pop music\". The band has said it \"Rose from the ashes following the tragic events of 9/11\". Gerard's artwork is featured on the cover of the album, and was inspired by the band's love for horror movies, comic books, and science fiction. The story of the previous album continues in Three Cheers. The story is about two lovers that break up, but reunite when their hometown is invaded and over run by vampires. The female (dubbed as \"Helena\" on some fansites) ends up being bitten by a vampire and is sent to a hospital where she soon dies with a spike through her heart from her lover. The male continues to live, but realizes that he cannot continue living without her, and kills himself.\n\nThe Black Parade\n\nOctober 24th 2006 saw the release of \"The Black Parade\", My Chemical Romance's third and newest studio album. Produced by Rob Cavallo (Green Day) and featuring the guest vocals of Liza Minelli and the parents of Frank Iero and Gerard and Mikey Way; the band hit the studio in April 2006 to make their third concept album. The story of The Black Parade centers around a character called \"The Patient\" who has suffered an untimely death. The Black Parade, a parade devised by singer Gerard Way, come to take the Patient into the after-life while reflecting back on his short years alive. Citing Queen, The Smashing Pumpkins, The Beatles, Pink Floyd and David Bowie as influences for their melodramatic classic-rock tinged masterpiece, My Chemical Romance continue to exceed expectations - The Black Parade has to this day sold over 1.3 million albums worldwide.\n\nMy Chemical Romance today Today My Chemical Romance are headlining festivals worldwide, and are set to begin their full tour of The Black Parade in early 2007. Promising a theatrical stage show, over-the-top production with their \"longest tour ever\", MCR are sure to please many a fan across the globe.\n\nGerard A. Way\n\nGerard Arthur Way, born April 9, 1977 and hailing from Newark, New Jersey, is the lead singer of the band My Chemical Romance, brother to band mate Mikey Way (bass). When he lived in New Jersey, he used to stalk Christina Ricci, after finding out she lived nearby. He went to his first concert (Bruce Springsteen) with his mother, and once worked as a cart boy/bagger in a Grocery store. Gerard is 1/2 Italian (mother's side), and also 1/2 Scottish (father's side). Gerard's maternal grandmother Elena taught him how to draw, sing and perform. In the fourth grade, he starred in his school’s production of Peter Pan. He started to play in bands when he was only eleven. As a child, Gerard came to the revelation that everyone he cares about will eventually die, and that he will die alone. This has led to his current obsession with the idea of death.\n\nHealth He has recently recovered from an addiction to drugs and alcohol, being sober as of August 2004, and visits a therapist when the band's not on tour. Gerard’s band mates have pulled him out of a deep depression twice (before the band really got started, and as he was sobering up). However, he still enjoys smoking Marlboro red cigarettes.\n\nArt He attended the School of Visual Arts in New York City and graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1999. As a child, Gerard grew up in a dangerous and crime-ridden neighborhood. Way has said that he was never really allowed outside to play when he was younger. Instead, he remained indoors and created his own imaginary worlds in his head. This led to his later in life love for artwork. Gerard aspired to be a comic book artist (he loved comic books, and his favorite superhero was always Wolverine) before forming My Chemical Romance in 2001. He pitched a cartoon for Cartoon Network called \"The Breakfast Monkey\", but it sadly didn't work out. He considers himself a failed comic book artist yet has still done the artwork for the My Chemical Romance albums and used to design merchandise for the band \"Thursday\".\n\nMy Chemical Romance On September 11th, 2001, Gerard was working in the comic industry of New York City. Witnessing the horrors of that day incited him to “do something with his life”. The song, “Skylines and Turnstiles” is based upon the terrorism attacks of 9/11, and is the first song to ever be written by My Chemical Romance. The band’s name is based upon an Irvine Welsh novel, and was first suggested by Gerard’s brother, Mikey. Together with Matt Pelissier, Ray Toro, Frank Iero, and Mikey Way, My Chemical Romance recorded their debut album. At their first show, Gerard and the rest of the band got very drunk because they were so nervous. Pelissier was later replaced by Bob Bryar. Gerard and his band mates hope to start working on their third album late 2006. They earned popularity with their hit single “I'm Not Okay (I Promise)” and later with a tribute to his late grandmother Elena Lee Rush, titled “Helena”. Gerard came up with the wardrobe ideas for the Helena video. Both songs are from their CD \"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge\". Their next two singles, in which they hope to get videos for, are “You Know What They Do to Guys Like Us in Prison”, with additional vocals of Bert McCracken from one of their \"brother\" bands The Used, along with their tragic loss song, “The Ghost of You”. The band has made several efforts for various causes such as the South Asian tsunami victims, and the fight against breast cancer. Despite the pictures of Gerard looking ghostly pale, he tans very well. The bulletproof vests they sometimes sport onstage represent where they grew up because the crime rate there was very high.\n\nMakeup & Body Art Way is known to wear heavy eye shadow during his band's concerts, but has been seen with a thick black strip along his eyes, during the Taste Of Chaos Tour 2005. He is deathly afraid of needles, so he doesn't have any piercings or tattoos. Nipple rings freak him out. Marilyn Manson has been quoted saying that he would kick Gerard’s ass if he ever got the chance for stealing his makeup style.\n\nDiscography & Lyrics Way and his band released their first CD, I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love in 2002 and have released a CD titled Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge in June of 2004. Way is always trying to write new material, and he usually gets song ideas from the newspaper. He sees lyrics as a way of telling a story, and usually loves dark stuff \"anything twisted, weird, and a little evil\". The song, “Demolition Lovers”, is said to be about Gerard’s then girlfriend.\n\nMusical Influences & Tastes Their musical influences include Iron Maiden, the Misfits, and David Bowie. He has undoubtedly confirmed that he thinks Brody Dalle from the Distillers is hot. His favorite band is now Iron Maiden, but is still a David Bowie fan. He has been obsessed with revenge ever since he heard the Black Flag song 'Revenge'. He owns the same color Stratocasters as Billie Joe Armstrong (front man of the smash pop/punk trio Green Day).\n\nMikey J. Way\n\nMikey Way was born Michael James Way, on September 10, 1980 in Newark, New Jersey, where he grew up. He is the younger brother of Gerard Way, (with whom he has a very close relationship, and is also Scottish/Italian, like his brother). Mikey is related to Joe Rogan, Host of the NBC game/stunt show Fear Factor and former cast member of the sitcom News Radio (Joe is Mikey's mother's cousin's son). Growing up, Way worked for Barnes & Noble, in addition to being an intern at Eyeball Records (the company that put out My Chemical Romance's debut album, I brought You My Bullets You Brought Me Your Love in 2002). The first concert he ever went to was a Smashing Pumpkins concert.\n\nMy Chemical Romance Mikey is the bassist of the band My Chemical Romance, and only learned bass in order to play in his brother's band. He dropped out of college for the sole purpose of playing in My Chemical Romance He plays both A Highway 1 Precision Bass, and a Fender Standard Precision Bass. Mikey was also responsible for the band's name, which came from an Irvine Welsh novel Ecstasy: Three Tales of Chemical Romance. He and Gerard's grandmother, Elena, happened to buy them their first tour van. Before he joined My Chemical Romance, Mikey auditioned for Frank Iero's (rhythm guitarist for My Chemical Romance) band, Pencey Prep. He did not make the cut. During the few first shows My Chemical Romance played, Mikey drank liquor heavily to mask his extreme stage fright. Today, Mikey resides with Frank when the band is recording.\n\nInterests His favorite band is Anthrax, and can often be seen wearing his signature Anthrax shirt. Mikey is a recovering iPod junkie and an iPod battery hoarder. His favorite food is sushi and claims that he could eat his body weight in it. Schlock horror films are his absolute favorite. Mikey loves unicorns. He has a pet cat named Bunny Marie Way whom he loves. Bunny has a myspace. On the opposite hand, he hates small spaces, large and open spaces, and shopping for groceries.\n\nPersonal Life Mikey is engaged to Alicia Simmons. The rumored wedding date is said to May 17th, 2007, but this is strictly an Internet rumor. Simmons is a guitar tech and merch seller among other things. She played surrogate guitarist for From First to Last in 2005. They currently are living together in Brooklyn, New York City, and are very happy with one another. Recently, Mikey and Alicia got matching tattoos on their wrists. The tattoo(s) consist of a heart shaped jar with flames emitting from it; across the jar reads, \"FOREVER\".\n\nInjuries Mikey is nearsighted (scroll down for details). Mikey has been pretty lucky, considering the only injuries he's ever gotten were liver damage, a few broken toes (an epic battle with a brick wall), and multiple respiratory infections, as well as being bassist in the top-charting band, My Chemical Romance.\n\nGlasses The younger Way's trademark was his glasses, but that all changed in May of 2006. Mikey got Lasik eye surgery that corrected his nearsightedness and made the glasses superfluous. He no longer wears glasses.\n\nAs quoted from Mikey's myspace page:\n\n\"At the young age of 9 years, Michael James Way was struck with the affliction known as nearsightedness. Unable to see such things as the chalkboard, the movie screen (or anything more than 5 feet away) the lad was forced to get corrective lenses. Michael and his glasses spent many fruitful years together. They saw each other through the good times, as well as the bad. In May of 2006 this friendship came to a crashing halt. Michael's glasses met their end tragically, by way of Lasik eye surgery. The glasses leave behind two loving brothers, Ray Ban, Paul frank, and their father Chanel. Viewing times and dates will be announced shortly.\"\n\nFrank A. Iero\n\nFrank Anthony Iero was born on October 31st, 1981 (making him a Scorpio), in Belleville, New Jersey (which he prefers to big cities such as New York or L.A.). Not many people know how to say his last name, which is correctly pronounced \"eye-year-oh\". Frank is 5'4'' and has hazel eyes with a dark drown natural hair color (now dyed black). He grew up with his mom, Linda, who divorced his dad (a great influence to him over the years). Just like fellow band mate Gerard Way, he has been playing in bands since he was eleven. Frank went to a catholic school growing up, where he learned to tie a tie. He was bullied in high school. He went to Rutgers University on a scholarship, but dropped out to join My Chemical Romance.\n\nMy Chemical Romance He currently is the rhythm guitarist for My Chemical Romance, and is the youngest member of the band. He was recruited after the band decided they needed another guitarist (in addition to Ray Toro) to fill out the sound. He also dropped out of college (and another band, Pencey Prep, scroll down for more) to pursue the band full time. At the time when he joined My Chemical Romance, he had dreadlocks. Frank plays an Epiphone Elitist Les Paul Custom guitar with an Alpine White finish, among others. One of his guitars reads \"Pansy” across it in honor of the owner’s nickname. Sadly, Pansy was broken in recent months by an MTV guitar tech.\n\nBody Art He has the word \"HALLOWEEN\" tattooed on his fingers and his other tattoos include a Jack O Lantern on his back, \"Keep the Faith\" on his upper back, the letters \"N.J.\" inside his lip standing for New Jersey, \"I wish I were a ghost\" around his right wrist, a dove on his left lower chest, an anchor on the lower part of his right bicep with an \"N\" and \"J\" on either side, and he has a scorpion on the right side of his neck. Frank got the scorpion tattoo as high up on his body as he could once he decided that he didn’t want a real job.\n\nProne to Injuries He unfortunately has suffered from Bronchitis and ear infections, as well as two broken toes, four chipped teeth, lacerations to hands, knees, and his head, numerous contusions and bruises, and endured a nasty case of mono. Alas, he still smokes.\n\nInterests Some of his favorite bands are Black Flag, American Nightmare, The Bouncing Souls, and The Beastie Boys. Frank loves reading books, especially the Harry Potter series. Frank Iero admires Billie Joe Armstrong (front man of the punk band Green Day) so much he learned to play guitar by imitating him. He also plans on buying a guitar that looks like Billie Joe's. Frank’s favorite movies are Tim Burton’s Nightmare Before Christmas, Rushmore, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Iero once expressed a want to meet Tim Burton. He loves dogs and prefers sunsets to sunrise. Frank used to go for strolls in cemeteries claiming, \"It’s very peaceful.”\n\nSide Projects Frank has his own clothing line, record label, and publishing company called Skeleton Crew. It is not a T-shirt company. Before he started playing with My Chemical Romance, Iero fronted a band called Pencey Prep. Along with Pencey Prep, he also has played with the bands Hybrid, Sector 12, and Give Up the Ghost.\n\nBob Bryar\n\nBob Bryar was born December 31st, 1979, in Chicago, Illinois. He is the only member of My Chemical Romance who is not from New Jersey. He attended school at Eisenhower Junior High in Darien, Illinois. Bob once played drums and symphonic in a jazz band.\n\nBob replaced Matt Pelissier He replaced Matt Pelissier in 2004. There is not toco much information on Matt, and My Chemical Romance doesn't talk much about him because they \"don't like to talk shit\", but it seems that Matt was kicked out of the band because he kept messing up onstage, plus no one was happy playing shows together anymore.\n\nMy Chemical Romance Bob was once a front of house sound technician for The Used, and met My Chemical Romance while on tour with The Used. My Chemical Romance had trouble with their old drummer, so it was a given they needed a new one. That's when Bob here comes in. He's helped My Chemical Romance out a lot and is one of the best new drummers going today. With his own style, Bryar is now a permanent drummer of My Chemical Romance. He has earned the respect of his fellow band mates by being a dedicated and hard worker. Frank Iero (rhythm guitar) was once quoted,\n\n\"Bob and Toro are the two hardest working people I've ever met, and if there is a God, I thank him everyday for bringing us Bob.\" Every show that Bob has played with My Chemical Romance, Gerard has been sober.\n\nCameras There have always been disagreements between Bob and people who try to take his picture. He dislikes being photographed or filmed, and prefers to be the one behind the camera. Bob is known to either walk in the other direction if he sees a camera, hit the camera, or curse repeatedly at the person who is trying to take the picture/film him.\n\nFavorite bands, injuries Bob is a fan of Black Sabbath and thinks England is cold. He has his ears gauged at 24, and next time you see him, make sure to gaze into those baby blues of his. Bob is a cat person. Unfortunately, he has gotten hurt. Some are minor injuries and other... not so minor. He was once pushed out of a bus, as well as receiving a busted nose from a bar fight with security tough guy. He has had is heart broken (long story), and well, as for the brain damage. He refuses to comment.\n\nRay T. Ortiz"
