Check it out below.\n\nRead more: 10 post-My Chemical Romance songs that prove life’s not so bad\n\nYou might know Iero from My Chemical Romance, Leathermouth, Death Spells, the Cellabration, the Patience… and many more bands and side projects.\n\nHowever, before all that, the musician was the frontman of New Jersey’s Pencey Prep. Now he’s hitting us in the feels with a throwback picture from one of the band’s shows.\n\nThe street gig happened in front of the Midtown Grill in Clifton, NJ, circa 99. The image features a really young Iero and fellow bandmates getting ready for the show.\n\nIero also got really nostalgic sharing the image of the band’s original lineup and tagged some of the other members.\n\n“Fun times, definitely not a fun gig,” he writes.\n\nCheck out the picture below:\n\nWatch more: Hilarious Frank Iero stories and the definition of ‘punk’ from The Homeless Gospel Choir"
