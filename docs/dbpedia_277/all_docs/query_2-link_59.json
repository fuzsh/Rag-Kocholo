        "text": "My Chemical Romance will have been parted for a year on March 22nd; and there are still fans who can’t believe the news and some fans who still think they are getting back together. The band – Gerard Way (vocals), Ray Toro (Guitar), Frank Iero (Guitar) and Mikey Way (bass) – inspired a generation of kids from 2001 to 2013 with their albums that played from different ends of the court; realistic and imaginary.\n\nThrough their songs the band touched on such topics as the September 11th terrorist attacks, the reality of cancer, growing up in today’s society and loving yourself for who you are. As well as taking us on a colourful journey in to the comic book loving mind of Gerard Way; with their final studio album Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys. This album was an adventure from start to finish, with every song telling part of the story in the Killjoys’ (the persona of the band at the time) lives.\n\nWhat better way to sign off the year of no MCR than with a greatest hits album by them, entitled May Death Never Stop You – a rather fitting title I think. The record takes songs from all four of the band’s studio albums – I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love, Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge, The Black Parade and Danger Days… – and puts them together for one great CD. Although many fans will already have all of the albums, May Death… offers a previously unreleased track as well three demos and some stunning artwork which will be loved by fans thinking of adding this album to their collection.\n\nMay Death Never Stop You is a great name which clearly applies to the fans…they must still carry on even with out their favourite band.\n\nThe perfect way to say goodbye.\n\nThe track-listing for the compilation, as well as a trailer, is below:\n\n1. Fake Your Death\n\n2. Honey, This Mirror Isn’t Big Enough For The Two Of Us\n\n3. Vampires Will Never Hurt You\n\n4. Helena\n\n5. You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison\n\n6. I’m Not Okay (I Promise)\n\n7. The Ghost Of You\n\n8. Welcome To The Black Parade\n\n9. Cancer\n\n10. Mama\n\n11. Teenagers\n\n12. Famous Last Words\n\n13. Na Na Na (Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na)\n\n14. Sing\n\n15. Planetary (Go!)\n\n16. The Kids From Yesterday\n\n17. Skylines and Turnstiles (Demo)\n\n18. Knives/Sorrow (Demo)\n\n19. Cubicles (Demo)\n\nMay Death Never Stop You is out March 24th.\n\nMy Chemical Romance, the New Jersey band, with help from a few other acts, who started their own genre and have influenced kids all over the world for the past 12 years, announced on March 22nd that they will be splitting up. Lead singer Gerard Way posted on the band’s official website:\n\n“Being in this band for the past 12 years has been a true blessing. We’ve gotten to go places we never knew we would. We’ve been able to see and experience things we never imagined possible. We’ve shared the stage with people we admire, people we look up to, and best of all, our friends. And now, like all great things, it has come time for it to end. Thanks for all of your support, and for being part of the adventure.”\n\nMy Chemical Romance\n\nThe post did not really explain the reasons for the split, perhaps they felt that they had gotten the most they could out of the band, or maybe the romance just died. One sure thing that can be said though is that what My Chemical Romance did for the ‘Alternative-Rock’ genre will never be forgotten.\n\nNot only did they become the kings of the genre, they also went up against the print media in 2006, when ‘The Sun’ and ‘The Daily Mail’ created stories about the band just to sell newspapers, however they didn’t go into it alone as their fans, the ‘MCRmy’ congregated outside the Marble Arch in London to protest the stories. This just showed how supportive their fans were, they stuck with them through thick and thin…which must have made it harder for the band to announce their split.\n\nHistory of the Band:\n\nI Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love:\n\nOne week after the 9/11 attacks in America, Gerard Way was influenced so much that he decided to start a band with drummer Matt Pelissier. Ray Toro was then recruited by the band to play guitar, along with Way’s younger brother Mikey, after he heard the band and dropped out of college, to play bass. The band met Frank Iero whilst he was the lead singer and guitarist for ‘Pencey Prep’, after ‘Pencey Prep’ split in in 2002, Iero joined ‘My Chemical Romance’ as rhythm guitarist.\n\nThe band released their début album, ‘I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love’, just three months after forming, through ‘Eyeball Records’.\n\nThree Cheers For Sweet Revenge:\n\nIn 2003 the band signed to the major record label, ‘Reprise Records’. With who they released their second album, ‘Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge’, in 2004. The album propelled them into the limelight with huge singles, such as: ‘Helena’, ‘I’m Not Okay (I Promise)’ and ‘Ghost Of You’. The album showed the power which this band could put in to an album, and didn’t shy away from the sound of their début. After their Japan tour in 2004, the band replaced drummer Matt Pelissier for Bob Bryer.\n\nThe Black Parade:\n\nIn 2006, ‘My Chemical Romance’ started recording their third album with producer, ‘Rob Cavallo’ who has worked with the likes of ‘Green Day’, ‘Meat Loaf’, ‘Paramore’ and ‘Avril Lavigne’. On October 23rd 2006, the band released their third album, ‘The Black Parade’. Which saw the band take on a new style for the album, dressing as a dark marching band. The album varied in the theme, it was in parts powerful, but then in others mournful. However that does not mean it wasn’t a good album, far from it. Tracks such as: ‘Dead’, ‘Welcome To The Black Parade’ and ‘Mama’ are masterpieces, and other songs like ‘Cancer’ and ‘Famous Last Words’ give out a deeper meaning and it all holds the album together, being a record you could listen to whether you are blasting it out in your car or moping around your house. With one of the greatest music videos ever made, ‘Welcome To The Black Parade’, and a number one UK single spot it is easy to say that this album will never be forgotten.\n\nWatchmen:\n\nIn 2009 the band did a cover of the song ‘Desolation Row’ by ‘Bob Dylan’ for the motion picture ‘Watchmen’, which was released in the same year.\n\nDanger Days: The True Lives Of The Fabulous Killjoys:\n\nIn 2009 the band announced that Bob Bryer had left the band. On November 22nd the band released their fourth album, ‘Danger Days: The True Lives Of The Fabulous Killjoys’. For this album the band took on a brand new look, which was fictional comic book characters created by the band…The Killjoys. The album was written as though it was a graphic novel and was following the stories of ‘The Killjoys’. It was by far the bands most powerful album, it showed everything that ‘My Chemical Romance’ could do, and although did not reflect the sound of their first album, as with ‘Planetary (Go)’ being more of a dance song, it had the feeling of ‘The Black Parade’ and when listening to the record is obvious that the band put all of their energy in to writing and recording it. It is a fast-paced album, all the way up to ‘Vampire Money’, the last track on the album.\n\nThe band released five singles from the album; ‘Na Na Na’, ‘The Kids From Yesterday’, ‘Planetary (Go)’, ‘The Only Hope For Me Is You’ and ‘Sing’. The last song also being used to promote awareness for the victims of the Japan tsunami.\n\nConventional Weapons:\n\nIn 2012 Frank Iero announced that the band would be releasing a new project called ‘Conventional Weapons’, it consisted of 10 unreleased songs which were recorded prior to their ‘Danger Days…’ album. They released two songs every month for five months.\n\nEarly this year there was speculation about the band starting work on a fifth album, that speculation has been put to rest now however after Gerard Way’s website post. Rumours have been spreading saying that the band split as a way to leave their label, and that they will be still be playing together but under a new name. However the world will always know these four guys by the name which influenced so many artists today…My Chemical Romance.\n\nSo long and goodnight, Killjoys."
