        "text": "Casual Interactions #1: Full Transcription\n\nJohn: Welcome to Casual Interactions, a show about old friends getting together and telling stories. I’m John “Hambone” McGuire, and with me today are some of my oldest and dearest friends, Frank Iero and Shaun Simon.\n\nFrank has been a traveling musician all his life, best known as the guitar player of My Chemical Romance, and singer of Leathermouth and Death Spells. He’s currently fronting his own band and writing music as a solo artist.\n\nShaun is a writer and is best known for his work on The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys, Art Ops, and Neverboy. He’s currently working on Wizard Beach for BOOM! Studios.\n\nI’m a jack of all trades, and if I told you what I actually did for a living, I’d have to kill you.\n\nSo to say that we’re busy is an understatement. We are a group of friends who are just looking for an excuse to get together more and hang out. We used to do it over breakfast and we figured that eating eggs on mic would be a little too gross, so we’re gonna do this podcast instead. How are you guys doing today?\n\nShaun: Hey, man.\n\nFrank: Doing good, man. Doing very good. I’m very excited to see you guys.\n\nJ: I’m very excited to see you too, man.\n\nF: Especially in front of a mic without eggs on your face.\n\nJ: Well, you know, I often have egg on my face. I do say a lot of dumb shit. However, it is a little better to not be chewing on microphone, or slurping, or-\n\nF: I do have hard boiled eggs in my pocket that I’m waiting to bust out for later.\n\nJ: Is that what that smell is?\n\nF: That’s what I have. I’m prepared, that’s what I’m saying.\n\nJ: You were a Boy Scout for like 2 weeks. It’s evident that you’ve actually survived your training.\n\nF: When I was a kid though, I went to Catholic school and everybody wanted to be an altar boy, but I couldn’t do it because I would see my dad on the weekends.\n\nJ: Right.\n\nF: And I couldn’t do Boy Scouts either and I was real depressed about that. I remember.\n\nJ: Yeah but you know, he taught you how to play drums so there’s gotta be a-\n\nF: That was the upside, upswing.\n\nJ: There’s gotta be an upswing to it.\n\nF: I didn’t get touched-\n\nJ: Jesus, Frank.\n\nF: -and I learned how to play drums.\n\nJ: We’re not even a minute in.\n\nS: I can’t picture you as an altar boy.\n\nF: I know, me neither.\n\nS: You probably would’ve burned that altar down.\n\nF: Well here’s the thing, think about this-\n\nS: Holding fucking fire in your hands on the fucking altar.\n\nF: Later on, in my career as a grammar schooler in 8th grade, right before graduation, we were gonna have practice graduation. I don’t know why you have to have practice for graduation.\n\nJ: They need to make sure you can walk in a straight line.\n\nF: Yeah! Exactly. It’s like a DUI, basically, yeah, for 8th graders. But we’d have them in the church. And I remember a few of my friends had these stink bombs, and they were like, “Oh, we should throw them in the church.” And everybody was like, “No fucking way!” And I was like, “I’ll fucking throw that shit!” And I took them and I threw them and I got-\n\nS: Of course you did.\n\nF: Of course I did. And then they wouldn’t let me graduate.\n\nJ: You were an 8th grade domestic terrorist.\n\nF: I think I was just pissed that I couldn’t be an altar boy!\n\nJ: Well just think about how a church smells musty, base-line. Like any church you go into, you never walk into a church and go, “Wow! This place smells really good. They must be like, using Yankee Candles or something.” It always just smells base-line musty. And then you add a stink bomb to it, in a room that’s not very well ventilated either. Oh, Jesus!\n\nF: Yes, I called it Frankincense. Later on though too, I remember I had to go to one of those retreat things because of this, and then I ended up getting in trouble there because we stole the wine and they caught us drinking wine.\n\nJ: How about you, Shaun? You ever an altar boy or a Boy Scout when you were a kid?\n\nS: I was an altar boy.\n\nF: You were?!\n\nS: I was, yeah.\n\nF: Oh!\n\nS: I don’t know if I have any stories, though. I just did the shit and left. Right?\n\nF: But you have the knowledge and that’s how you can judge if I-\n\nS: Right!\n\nF: -you could see me in that position.\n\nS: That’s why I can see you burning down the church… if Frank was an altar boy.\n\nJ: Now churches just burn when you walk into them. Which is like, gotta be a 9th level spell. Good for you getting to that level of wizardry… So why don’t we take a second and step back and talk about how we met.\n\nF: Okay, go ahead.\n\nJ: So we all grew up in different parts of town. Frank grew up in Belleville.\n\nF: True.\n\nJ: I grew up in Clifton. Shaun grew up on the other side of Clifton. Now for those listening, the city of Clifton is shaped like a giant horseshoe, and this is in New Jersey. It borders 12 other towns, so where Shaun lived in Clifton might as well have been 4 towns away from where I lived.\n\nF: Is it really shaped like a horseshoe?\n\nJ: It is shaped like a giant horseshoe.\n\nS: It’s shaped like horseshit.\n\nJ: Yeah. Just parts of it smell like horseshit. I actually did a report on it in the 6th grade and that’s how I know it’s shaped like a giant horseshoe. Borders 12 towns, don’t ask me to name them now because I don’t remember most of them.\n\nF: I’m still thinking of like how- because I get lost everywhere, but maybe that’s why I can’t figure my way around Clifton.\n\nJ: Well you were only ever in Clifton, you’d never actually been outside of it. Like you went from Belleville into Clifton and you just never left.\n\nF: That’s true. That’s true, yeah. We’re talking about origin stories, right?\n\nJ: Yes!\n\nF: Alright. I remember, because I met Shaun first.\n\nS: Did you?!\n\nF: Yes!\n\nS: Oh, freshman year!\n\nF: I don’t even remember- freshman year orientation.\n\nS: Oh!\n\nF: I met you at the orientation.\n\nS: That’s like another world, though. Like, I feel like, I don’t know.\n\nF: It’s alright, you can say you don’t remember me.\n\nS: No, I do remember you. I do remember you!\n\nF: But you were friends with Eugene. And I was friends with Costa.\n\nS: That’s right.\n\nF: And they were friends.\n\nS: He used to steal cheese.\n\nF: He used to steal cheese?\n\nS: Didn’t he used to steal cheese?\n\nF: From who?!\n\nS: I don’t know!\n\nF: I think you made that up, but maybe!\n\nS: Maybe, maybe. He was just a really small kid and I used to think he used to steal cheese.\n\nF: He might have!\n\nJ: I think you just projected that on him.\n\nF: I definitely stole a lot of things with him. None of which I believe were cheese, but I mean, it’s possible!\n\nS: Maybe he was just mouse-like and I just- anyway.\n\nF: So they would skate together and I remember finding out that you skated too, and then I would just bring a board and watch you guys skate.\n\nS: Did you actually skateboard, though? Or did you just like-\n\nF: I did! And then broke both my ankles, and I was never good.\n\nS: Oh, okay.\n\nF: I think I got as far as, like, I maybe landed 3 Ollies.\n\nJ: That’s 3 more than me\n\nF: So that’s my first remembrance of you. But then you didn’t stick around long.\n\nS: I left after freshman year, yeah.\n\nF: So we didn’t even really hang out that much.\n\nJ: Now, I was 2 years older than Frank in high school, and so, I didn’t even know up until we started hanging out years later that you were in the same high school as me because I wouldn’t- not that I was like some cool older kid, I definitely was not. However, I wasn’t at freshman orientation that year because I was a junior, so yeah. So years later we end up meeting again because of a mutual friend. It was Bruno right?\n\nS: Bruno, yeah.\n\nF: Oh yeah!\n\nJ: Because you went to Bergen Community College with Bruno.\n\nS: Kinda went there.\n\nJ: Kinda went there. I mean, one does not simply really go to Bergen Community College.\n\nF: Shaun didn’t stick around any school for very long.\n\nS: I didn’t stick around very long.\n\nJ: He’s just out there smoking cigarettes, hanging with the cool kids, being bad.\n\nF: Yeah, and he can be an altar boy. I see, alright.\n\nJ: He can be an altar boy. He’s quiet about it. He shuts the fuck up, he gets in there, does his job, and gets out. Like you, you had to make a production about it.\n\nS: Yeah, Frank would’ve made sure everyone knew he was an altar boy.\n\nF: This is true! This is true. Fucking drama… Drama boy! Drama altar boy!\n\nJ: I mean, I could imagine you like, “I’m an altar boy,” and flashing your cross like you’re a cop. “Yeah, here. I’m on the job. I’m on the job for Jesus.”\n\nF: Ah, shit. Alright, fine. Touché!\n\nJ: So, Frank and I played in bands together in high school, and we played with one of our friends named Bruno. Bruno brought Shaun along one night to hang and we’ve all been friends ever since! We’ve since played in bands together, we’ve since played in bands separately, and now we’re here in Frank’s basement recording a podcast.\n\nF: Isn’t that crazy? Fucking small world.\n\nJ: It’s 20 years.\n\nF: Is it really?!\n\nJ: It’s about 20 years worth of friendship happening, culminating in this podcast.\n\nF: I’m so old.\n\nS: I don’t feel like I’m 20 years older than I was.\n\nJ: No, neither do I, man. I still, like-\n\nF: I do!\n\nS: I also don’t feel like I look it.\n\nJ: No, you don’t.\n\nS: I don’t know if that’s just me.\n\nF: You kept your handsomeness.\n\nJ: You were always the looks of the band.\n\nS: Yeah… I don’t know about that.\n\nJ: So yeah, we love hanging out together. We are always looking for new reasons to hang out because it’s hard when you get a little bit older. People have kids, people have different jobs, things that take you different places, some of us going all over the world. So what we’re going to do every episode is talk about a different topic. So today we’re really just gonna focus on our origin story. So that’s how we end up all meeting, and then a little while after that… You know, Frank and I have been playing in bands together since high school, I played with a couple different people. Frank tried to go to college, I tried to go to college a few times, and then we ended up getting back together and deciding to start a new band, and that band ended up being Pencey Prep.\n\nF: Yeah.\n\nJ: So we wanted a keyboard player, and we just loved hanging out with Shaun.\n\nS: Wait, did you want a keyboard player-\n\nF: I think we did!\n\nS: -or were you just like, “We like hanging out with this dude, do something for us.”\n\nF: I think it was both.\n\nS: It was a little bit of both.\n\nF: Yeah!\n\nJ: A little column A, a little column B.\n\nS: “Guitar is a little too hard to learn, here’s a keyboard.”\n\nJ: Right. And I was already playing bass. And that’s what it was. We pulled a keyboard out from under the bed and said, “Learn how to play this and you can be in the band.” Because we just wanted to keep hanging out with you. And that was it, you know, that’s the real origin story of how Pencey Prep started. We just wanted to hang out more with Shaun.\n\nF: This is true. Yeah! Here’s the moral of it: is that we continuously manufacture things so that we can hang out with you, Shaun.\n\nJ: Like this podcast!\n\nF: Yeah! That’s just an ongoing thing. 20 years later, Hambone bought a bunch of mics.\n\nS: Right, right!\n\nF: Just to lure you to our house to hang out.\n\nJ: Because breakfast wasn’t enough sometimes. I had to take it up a notch, recording you right now.\n\nF: Yes, exactly. Goddamn it.\n\nJ: I mean, that’s what it is. You look at a band like The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, right? Like, what does Ben Carr really do? Well, apparently Ben Carr is a tour manager and he runs the whole day to day operations of the band. But back in the day, they just wanted to hang out with their buddy, they wanted something for him to do, so they said, “Well, just dance onstage.”\n\nS: Oh, that’s right!\n\nJ: You should be happy, Shaun. We didn’t make you dance.\n\nS: Yeah, I wouldn’t have done that anyway. We would’ve had to say our goodbyes back then.\n\nF: Well, even early Pencey shows, there was a lot of playing verses- no, playing choruses! And then during the verses you would just smoke. Just smoke onstage.\n\nS: So I was like, “Here’s this dude, he’s gonna stand there and look cool, smoking a cigarette.”\n\nF: Right, yeah. It was very Velvet Underground.\n\nJ: And you wouldn’t even face the crowd either. You know, the whole band is going at it with the crowd, you were just turned sideways and just staring at whatever wall was in your direction on stage left, and just… smoking.\n\nF: Judging. Just judging everyone. Yes!\n\nJ: Light it up during the verse, fly in for the chorus, Shaun Simon.\n\nF: There it is! I mean, it worked.\n\nJ: That’s what you did.\n\nF: It did!\n\nS: It worked.\n\nF: That was a fun band to be in.\n\nJ: That was a fun band.\n\nS: You know what’s weird about that band? It feels like we were a band so much longer than we actually were. It wasn’t that long, right?\n\nF: You know what I think? I think that Pencey wasn’t long. The time period after when we were doing I Am A Graveyard, that was longer.\n\nS: Was that longer?\n\nF: I think so.\n\nS: Because we only had like 3 songs, didn’t we?\n\nF: Like 4 or 5. But I think that was the other thing too, we just liked hanging out so much that-\n\nJ: We didn’t wanna stop.\n\nF: We didn’t wanna stop, yeah.\n\nJ: I feel like it was about a year and a half leading up to us getting ready to record the record. Then we recorded the record, we went on that one ill-fated tour across America, and then we just kinda restructured the band when Tim left.\n\nF: Yeah.\n\nS: No, actually we restructured the band and then we did I Am A Graveyard, and then Tim left.\n\nJ: Then Tim left. Then that was the end of the band.\n\nS: Then Frank joined My Chem.\n\nJ: Yeah, I mean it was a really great time. The thing about that is to me , I look back on the record kinda cringing-ly. Because I just can’t listen to it, it’s really hard to get through. And it’s funny when I look at kids who were our age, recording now and the kinda stuff they’re doing. And granted, I know technology is very different, but the idea of our playing ability at 19, 20, 21, versus a kid who’s 19, 20, 21 now’s playing ability, it’s like night and day.\n\nF: Oh my god. Oh, I know.\n\nJ: It’s like, god bless that it happened before the internet and nobody caught on that we stunk. We were tight! We were a good band but we were like the high school band and everyone else is doing laps around us.\n\nF: I feel like that’s the thing too is like, now you see these young kids, 11 and 12, going on YouTube and learning how to play, and really giving it their all. It’s insane! I would just listen to records and smoke pot in my room and try to figure stuff out. And I don’t know, there wasn’t that outlet to get better. You actually had to go and take lessons from somebody. And it was like, “Fuck that.”\n\nJ: And taking lessons sucked.\n\nF: I know.\n\nJ: I mean I’m not shitting on anyone who does take lessons.\n\nF: No, no!\n\nJ: But when I was a kid I was like, “Dude. I don’t wanna take lessons, I just wanna go out and do this.” However, I realize now that it takes a lot of effort to make something look effortless.\n\nF: Yeah!\n\nJ: And I also look back at that record fondly because where I am today, kinda where we all are today, is because of that record. Like, the friends that I have and the family I have in my life, I met all because I was in the music scene. I think we all did, right? We all did.\n\nS: Everything kind of originated from that band.\n\nJ: My friend Carrie hit me up from Tennessee the other day and she was like, you know, talking about the Pencey Prep record. And I was about to just shit all over it because it’s- well it’s hard for me to go back and listen to. But she gave me the perspective and she said, “Hey, because of that record, because you were in that band, we met. And because of that, your other friends have met and now they have families and they’re all together because we were all kind of in that same place at the same time.” I have a profound sense of gratitude for the record. I just can’t listen to it.\n\nF: I wouldn’t change anything, because everything ended up the way it did. That’s wonderful. But if I could Doc Brown it, and just tweak little things here and there, I’d definitely- there’s a lot that I would tweak.\n\nS: Yeah, if someone played to a click track.\n\nF: Well, click- click would help!\n\nJ: Lots of auto-tuning.\n\nF: But that’s- yeah! I mean that’s the thing. There are certain things that you listen back and it’s cringy, but that’s because you were a fucking teenager! It’s supposed to be.\n\nJ: Right, and it was a very different thing being a teenager when we were teenagers, and being a teenager now.\n\nF: Yeah.\n\nJ: Night and day.\n\nF: I totally agree.\n\nJ: I would not survive as a teenager now.\n\nF: No! Fuck no! I’d be naked on the internet somewhere.\n\nJ: Somewhere.\n\nF: It would ruin my goddamn life! Totally. Doing some dumb shit.\n\nJ: Yeah, absolutely.\n\nF: We had VHS recorders. Destroy that shit.\n\nJ: Yeah, absolutely. My friend George Bungle lores over my head that he definitely has pictures of me when I was wearing eyeliner and flat ironing my hair, and I was like, “Please!” I was like, “George, just let me find a wife first, because it’ll be harder for her to leave me once those pictures come out. There would be lawyers involved.”\n\nF: Yikes. Yeah. Well, that’s the thing too, is like, I do have minor interactions on social media. Just like, through Twitter and Instagram, stuff like that. Facebook is an animal that I can’t understand so I just decide not to use it.\n\nJ: It’s all racist\n\nF: Is it really?! Jesus!\n\nJ: Facebook is where you go to figure out which of your friends have actually been racist this entire time.\n\nF: Oh my god! Ugh.\n\nJ: Yeah, just stay off it.\n\nF: That sounds terrible.\n\nJ: It’s pretty bad.\n\nF: So anyway, I’m not going on Facebook then. But people will send like, pictures of like, a moment in time, just this fucking split second moment in time, but, “Explain this.” I’m like, “Motherfucker!\n\nS: What do you mean?\n\nF: Yeah, exactly! \"What are you talking about?” You have to explain every goddamn moment of your life that’s been captured in some sort of video clip or like still, or photo, like- So you’ll see some questionable hairstyles, or styles of things. And certain things maybe made sense in a moment because you were making fun of something, but when it gets taken out of context, it makes no sense. But my response usually is like, “Alright, yeah, that may have been questionable, but I will show you 100,000 people that are wearing their hair like that still, right now, because I did that.”\n\nJ: Absolutely! Absolutely.\n\nS: What? Are they talking about your dreadlocks?\n\nF: Oh, that’s one!\n\nJ: That’s one!\n\nS: Is that one of them? Remember when we cut those off?\n\nF: Yeah!\n\nS: Threw them out the hotel window-\n\nF: In Chicago!\n\nJ: Chicago, yeah!\n\nF: Yeah, we planted them.\n\nJ: I mean, they’re technically biodegradable, right?\n\nS: Yeah.\n\nF: No!\n\nS: I don’t know about that.\n\nJ: Oh, no, they’re not!\n\nF: No. Those are bad for the environment. That’s why Chicago is the way it is. Because we threw them out the window.\n\nJ: Frank’s old dreadlocks. I’m sure there’s a tree growing where you threw that dreadlock outside of the hotel where I’m staying at next week.\n\nF: I don’t know if you remember this, though. That started out of a joke because we’re all in the back of this van, and we were talking about the music that Tim liked, which he was really into nu-metal and weird shit.\n\nJ: Oh my god, yeah, I remember.\n\nF: And I started tying knots in my hair, and they turned into that, and we put like, crazy glue in it\n\nS: Ew.\n\nF: And that’s how it started. And then it just got real nasty.\n\nJ: I wonder if people like, because you know everyone like, lives on their phone now, like the distraction in the back of the van. I don’t think a band would ever do that now because they’re gonna be so distracted being on social media. Whereas, to pass the time you guys were really busy throwing my Thin Lizzy CDs out the window and gluing your hair together!\n\nF: Oh man!\n\nJ: You left the case, though, which I always thought was funny.\n\nF: Did we leave the case?\n\nJ: You did leave the case.\n\nS: Why- who threw your CDs out?\n\nF: It was a tape, it was a tape. I think-\n\nS: Why did we decide that was a good idea?\n\nJ: How many times can you hear “Jailbreak” on the same tour?\n\nF: That! Yeah, it was like, “The boys are not back in town. we have to stop.” It just got to be too much.\n\nJ: It was the first intervention of many.\n\nF: Alright, here’s another thing about origin stories. I remember this like it was fucking yesterday, and Shaun will vouch for this. Those early My Chem tours in the van where you would have to bring these billfolds of CDs.\n\nS: Oh, absolutely.\n\nF: That was like 100 pounds of CDs that you were bringing with you every tour, to just pass the time, stuff like that. It was fucking horrible! Everything would be scratched and destroyed by the time you got back.\n\nS: Start it all over.\n\nJ: Oh yeah, absolutely. Because every bump in the road-\n\nF: Oh my god!\n\nJ: It’s the same thing when we used to drive around. So we had a van, a yellow school bus van, that I bought for like 800 bucks. The thing was the drizzling shits. It was a terrible, terrible van, but we needed a van to go on tour, and all we wanted to do was tour, so we went and I got the van and we got it fixed up. And the very first night of tour, we were playing at the Loop Lounge for our tour kickoff party. And as we were driving the van to the rehearsal space to go and pick up the gear, I bumped into a curb, the timing belt jumped, and we almost missed the first day of the tour. And it was all downhill from there because this van also, the anti-freeze hose popped, and destroyed the van’s on-board computer so we got stuck in Minnesota.\n\nF: Can we dive into that story a little bit more? Because that was the whole reason of the tour, was this one show that we got booked. Was it with Les Savy Fav?\n\nJ: It was Les Savy Fav at the 7th Street Entry in Minneapolis. So the 7th Street Entry is the smaller part of the First Ave. which one of the biggest and most famous rock clubs in America. You’ve seen it in Prince’s “Purple Rain,” and the whole point of the tour was that we got this gig at the 7th Street Entry with Les Savy Fav, and we were traveling out there to go and do this show. Now on the way, besides the timing belt jumping, we had a problem with the seal on the gas tank, so we could only ever fill the tank up-\n\nF: This is true, I remember!\n\nS: That’s right!\n\nJ: We could only ever fill the tank up three-quarters of the way, so that was the second problem.\n\nF: But you kinda didn’t know how far you were going. You just thought, “Alright, that’s three-quarters of a tank,” and then it would seep in and you would smell gas all day.\n\nJ: And we would smell gasoline.\n\nS: And wasn’t it like, we were nervous about flicking cigarettes out the windows?\n\nF: Yes! But it didn’t stop us.\n\nS: We just kept smoking.\n\nJ: No, and I remember going and getting that fixed, getting the seal fixed, and just sitting there, and the guy was literally- he had the van up and he’s underneath it and he’s smoking a cigarette and he’s checking it, and I’m like, “This is how I die! This is officially how it ends for me.” Thankfully, it didn’t. So, take us back. Frank, we were driving to Minneapolis.\n\nF: Driving to Minneapolis. This was the show, man. This is it, we were gonna make it. This is the like our big show! And so we stop off in Minnesota, right?\n\nJ: Right.\n\nF: And we’re like, “Alright, we’re gonna get a good night’s sleep. The next day, we’re driving to this show, we’re gonna play the biggest show of our band’s career. We’re gonna have our CD. It’s gonna be great. We’re gonna do this.” So we head out and I think it was maybe 2 hours into a 3 hour drive, and the van was like, “No, you’re not.” Because it just like- you ever see like, in a horror movie where like, someone cuts a stomach and just the bowels fall out? That’s how- everything. Like, the poor girl just fucking disemboweled on the highway.\n\nJ: So the hose popped-\n\nF: Blood. Car blood!\n\nJ: Anti-freeze everywhere! And now I know what hot anti-freeze smells like. It smells like hot maple syrup.\n\nF: Yeah.\n\nJ: So we pull over to the side of the road. Thankfully, there was a Ford dealership literally 1,000 feet where we were at the top of the hill. So we got them to tow us there. It cost $666.34 to repair, which I called my dad. I was like, “Dad, please! Please, let me use your credit card, we’re stuck out here!” And he did. Like, my father has-\n\nF: The greatest.\n\nJ: -always been so supportive of the music that I’ve played, the music Frank’s played. So he came and he gave his credit card number over the phone to this car dealership outside of Minneapolis, and we never made the show.\n\nF: Uh uh.\n\nJ: We didn’t play the show.\n\nF: Did not play the show. Did not pay him back either. Fucked up! Sorry. Oh shit.\n\nJ: He just put it on my tab. It’s like, “How many times you drop out of college, John?” And just add it up, you know. So I mean, so that was the first Pencey Prep tour. You know we played- our friend, Neil, who was in the band, he booked the tour, and this is back when e-mail is just new. Like, you know, there is internet, but people have like Juno and AOL. There’s no high speed internet, you know. You used to call CBGB’s to get a gig, they didn’t have an e-mail address. You’d have to call at like Tuesday or Thursday between these hours and if you did not call during those times, or you couldn’t get someone on the phone, you weren’t getting booked to CBGB’s. So, this is so many years ago! Like you think about it, this was 2000! This is almost 20 years.\n\nF: Was it 2000? Or was it 99?\n\nJ: Oh, maybe it was 99 at that point, yeah! I mean, you know, you and I have been friends- I graduated in 97, I met you in 1995. And then I met you a few years later so-\n\nS: Hm…\n\nJ: Yeah, 99.\n\nS: 99, yeah maybe.\n\nJ: 99 was the first Pencey- the first and only Pencey tour.\n\nF: Right!\n\nJ: So you know, we made the towns, we played the clubs, then the van had another problem where we got to, I think, Missouri of all places, and had to fix the gas tank again. And we were at a point, our last show of the tour was Columbus, Ohio in this basement. I forget the name of the club but it was a basement club and the guy stiffed up for money, because he’s like, “Well I’m not gonna pay you guys, you didn’t bring anybody.” It’s like, \"Well, we’re from fucking New Jersey!” So we gunned it all the way home, we would not turn the engine off because we were afraid it wasn’t gonna turn back on. Do you remember the CD that was stuck in the CD player that we had to listen to the entire 10 and a half hour ride home?\n\nF: No.\n\nS: No.\n\nJ: “Stay What You Are” by Saves the Day.\n\nF: Oh god! So bleak!\n\nJ: It got stuck in the CD player, because everything was going on, why wouldn’t that go wrong?\n\nF: Well, that’s the thing. That’s a great record, but like, to listen to over and over again on our- already being depressed. Fuck!\n\nJ: Yeah, we got our asses kicked on that first tour, you know? A little while after that, Neil wasn’t in the band anymore. And then a little while after that, we became I Am A Graveyard, and we did a couple years of that, still slugging along, and then the rest is history for Frank.\n\nF: For everybody!\n\nJ: Yeah.\n\nF: You guys did The Hostage after that, too.\n\nJ: We did do The Hostage for a little while. The Hostage, I think, we lasted maybe 6-7 months.\n\nS: I think we played, like, 3 shows.\n\nJ: We played 3 really awesome shows.\n\nS: Really, yeah, really good shows.\n\nJ: We had a good buzz about us, but the other guys in the band were dicks. You know what, I take that back. Dan wasn’t a dick, Paul wasn’t a dick, it was the other guy that was a dick.\n\nS: Yeah.\n\nJ: So… He got a little too big for his britches and the band had to break up.\n\nS: Well the problem with Dan, he… I remember, I think I was talking to you, and you with My Chem, you were like, “Yeah, why don’t you guys come out and open for us?” You remember that?\n\nJ: Yeah.\n\nS: In like Pittsburgh, or something like that. And then Dan was like, “Oh, I have to work because I have to pay my car lease,” or something.\n\nJ: Yeah, yeah.\n\nS: And it was like, “Dude, where’s your fucking drive to do this?”\n\nJ: The thing about being in bands and the things about doing any kind of like, artistry, or any kind of like, going into business for yourself, takes sacrifice.\n\nF: It does.\n\nJ: Putting the time and effort into doing something that’s outside of working 9-5, it takes hard work. Like, you could either make that decision to work 9-5 for someone else, or you work 18 hours for yourself.\n\nF: My dad and my grandfather were musicians and they played all the time, and it wasn’t always something they did full time, for a living. It was something they could do- you know, they had to have another job to support. But my dad would always tell me like, you know, “There’s music and then there’s a music business, and one, very often, has nothing to do with the other.”\n\nJ: Absolutely.\n\nF: And the thing about, you know, music- the business side of it is so cutthroat and unforgiving at times.\n\nJ: Right.\n\nF: And there’s no justice in it. Some of the best players are still looking for a fucking gig.\n\nJ: Absolutely!\n\nF: You could have a degree that you spent thousands and thousands of dollars on, and years and years of your life trying to obtain, and you can’t get a fucking job.\n\nJ: Right.\n\nS: Yeah.\n\nF: So it would behoove you to have a safety net, or like, a real job so that you can, you know, afford to do these things. But very often, that’s not conducive to this life. Know what I mean?\n\nJ: Right.\n\nF: So you kinda have to throw caution to the wind and say, “Fuck it. I’m gonna sleep on a bench if I have to, to do this kinda thing,” and that’s not the smartest thing I know.\n\nJ: Yeah, it’s definitely not the smartest thing, and I’d never like-\n\nF: It’s not easy either.\n\nJ: I’d never begrudge Dan, uh, for doing that-\n\nF: No!\n\nJ: The thing is, you know, where we- how we grew up, you have to go to college, you have to get a job, you have to do this, you have to be responsible. And not everyone is ready to go off and join the circus.\n\nS: I just felt like with The Hostage especially, that you know, me and you, Hambone, were on the same page with that. And I felt other people weren’t.\n\nJ: Oh, definitely not.\n\nS: You know what I mean? I feel like me and you were ready to go, if go was a thing that happened.\n\nJ: Right.\n\nS: And the others were like, you know, “I still have to do this so I have to work around my fucking flat tire on my fucking Mom’s car.”\n\nF: It’s very easy to say, “Hey, yeah, I’m down for the cause.” It’s another thing to do it.\n\nJ: Yeah, absolutely.\n\nF: That's the scary part.\n\nJ: In the words of Jim Teacher, “Everyone wants to rock and roll, no one wants to pay the price.”\n\nF: This is true, man. If it were easy, everybody would do it, right?\n\nJ: Absolutely. Absolutely.\n\nF: Fuck! But that’s the thing, too, is- you know, the shitty thing is that- even if you have the talent and you have the heart and you take the risk, you still gotta have the luck. It’s like, “Motherfucker!” It’s like this perfect- it’s like winning the lottery!\n\nJ: It is.\n\nF: It doesn’t make any goddamn sense.\n\nJ: For me, I didn’t have the luck. My luck took me in very different directions and I’d never change anything about it, I’m super super grateful for it. You know, however, I hit a point where I was in my early 30s and I was like, “Shit, I kinda need to get like, a job job, and make some money because I got nothing.” And that was cool, it was alright, because I have a work ethic. When you’re a person who’s passionate about their art and what they create, you know, whether it’s Shaun’s writing, Frank’s writing music, I’m producing podcasts now, you always have that reason to get up in the morning and kick yourself in the ass and go take care of business. So I was able to go find a crazy job that if I told you what I did for a living, I’d have to kill you. Uh, made a bunch of money, and then I was able to kinda come back to the thing that I love the most, which is playing music, and being creative. Sometimes you just have to take a knee and reassess your situation. Redefine your ideas of success.\n\nF: Yeah! Absolutely.\n\nJ: You know? So, I mean, I got my happy ending.\n\nS: There it is!\n\nF: There it is!\n\nJ: So do you guys have any final thoughts on the origin story?\n\nF: Oh man!\n\nS: I feel like we didn’t cover a lot.\n\nF: Yeah! We could probably keep going on the origin story, I think, for a couple- maybe we could take a break and then do another episode of origins.\n\nJ: Alright, so what we’re gonna do is, we’re gonna wrap this episode up. This’ll be Origins-\n\nF: Origins 1A!\n\nJ: Origin 1. This is part 1 of the origin story. Yeah, this is just the story of Pencey Prep and friendship, and next will be the story of Pencey Prep and Friendship: The Dark Knight Rises. So, you know, we’ll find some catchy subtitle for it. Frank, where can people find you?\n\nF: I live- New Jersey.\n\nS: Don’t give them your address!\n\nF: I use Instagram. I have an Instagram called frankieromustdie, I have a Twitter that’s @frankiero, and I have a website I guess, frank-iero.com. Because somebody had frankiero.com.\n\nJ: How rude!\n\nF: Yeah!\n\nS: Is that why there’s no A in it?\n\nF: Oh, what’s that?\n\nS: Isn’t that- don’t you do something where there’s no A in your name?\n\nF: I was- yeah, I was doing that for a while, too. So I could at least cut through some of the fakers. It’s like faker He-Man, dude. Somebody has frankiero.com, I don’t know who it is. I think, I don’t know if there’s like, I think there’s companies that like, go out and buy, just domain names and then try to like, hold them ransom.\n\nJ: Absolutely. Absolutely. I mean I’m shocked that I got hamfistedproductions.com.\n\nF: Dude.\n\nJ: I’m shocked that we got casualinteractions.com!\n\nS: Do we have that?\n\nJ: Oh yeah!\n\nS: The website?\n\nJ: Oh, I got it.\n\nF: Oh, nice! See?\n\nS: Oh shit! Look at you, man!\n\nJ: I’m proactive.\n\nF: Now, here’s the thing! You could use that for this.\n\nJ: Yeah.\n\nF: Right? And it’d be alright. Or you could start like, a weird porno hooker thing and make a lot of money.\n\nJ: Oh no, that’s why we’re sitting on it.\n\nF: Right, right!\n\nJ: I’m gonna wait until someone wants to pay us. When the money comes rolling in, we’re splitting it three ways, we’re going to Cabo! Shaun, where can people find you?\n\nS: I don’t use anything. I have Twitter, @shaunsimon.\n\nF: You have a Twitter?\n\nJ: You do have a Twitter.\n\nS: I have Twitter.\n\nF: Oh, alright. I’ll check it out.\n\nJ: He’s been known to tweet. What do you have in stores right now?\n\nS: What do I have in stores?\n\nJ: Yeah, what books out right now?\n\nS: Oh, nothing! I just- one of my books just was announced a few months ago called Wizard Beach. It’s coming out in December, I believe.\n\nJ: Alright, very cool.\n\nS: It’s a comic book. Not a prose book, so.\n\nJ: Maybe one day, you’ll write some prose.\n\nS: We’ll see what happens.\n\nJ: Well, when this episode drops, Wizard Beach will probably be right around the corner so definitely check out Wizard Beach at your local comic book store.\n\nF: Wait, if you write a prose book can you title it “Every Prose Has Its Thorn”?\n\nJ: Yes!\n\nF: So good.\n\nJ: You can find me at- you can check out my other podcast. It’s The Vintage RPG Podcast, it’s a gaming podcast. We talk about Dungeons & Dragons and other RPG games. You could also find me at maitaitv.com, for my punk rock Tiki podcast Mai Tai Happy Hour.\n\nSo, for Shaun Simon and Frank Iero, I’m John “Hambone” McGuire. Join us next month for another episode of Casual Interactions. Until then, hold onto your friends."
