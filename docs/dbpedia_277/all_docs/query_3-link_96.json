        "text": "Disclaimer: I’m not saying that this is the truth as for only Gerard and Frank know what the truth was. This is just a 20 year old girl who gets bored enough sometimes to analyze lyrics, and let me tell you, as an English Literature student I’m pretty damn good at it. If you don’t like frerard, don’t continue reading. I don’t want to change your mind, I don’t want for you to try and change mine. If you want to discuss something in a civilized way, feel free to contact me but otherwise I’m not interested. Also, note that I won’t ever, ever in my whole life go harassing these two men with frerard stuff because they have expressed they don’t like it and it’s disrespectful to not comply with what they want. I do not like LynZ Way, but that has nothing to do with Gerard or Frank, i didn't like her before she married Gerard either. I don't share some of the things she says/does but i would never, ever hate on her, i respect her as an artist and as a person, i just don't share some of her thoughts.\n\nWhat happened according to me:\n\n(if you click on the words in bold from now on there are links)\n\nFirst of all, I’d like to say the following: I don’t know them personally, I’m not friends with them, so this is an assumption I’m making here. Even if I don’t know them personally, I’ve been following this band since I was eleven and I’m twenty now, therefore I know a lot about them.\n\nNow, I’d like to say a few things about them. Gerard is a very artistic person, which means he has this kind of unique sensitiveness, as Frank does too. Gerard has always claimed that he doesn’t care about being cool and stuff, but I think he loves that everyone seems to like him. He loves being an inspiration and he loves being admired. In my opinion this is why he can’t deal with the thought of being rejected/hated. I consider that Frank takes all the people admiring him thing much more humbly, I believe that for him it’s an exchange: he stays true to himself and inspires people and in return he gets inspired by people and/or experiences he has because of being an inspiration.\n\nThis being said, let’s go back to when they first met: Frank was in Pencey Prep and he listened to MCR and fell in love with the band immediately (his words), and when he meets Gerard he thinks he’s ‘’rad.’’ Gerard describes Frank starting in the band as something almost magical, he says Frank was the missing piece. Now, this is in 2001, Frank was 20 and Gerard was 24, pretty damn young. I think they started making out with each other (see FT Willz/Frank’s poems) and it was more like a casual thing when they were wasted/stoned. Now, mind this, Frank was already with Jamia and apparently Gerard had a girlfriend too, but I don’t think that stopped them. I think they were young and reckless of what they were doing, starting this new life and flirting with drugs and alcohol.\n\nI think when things got serious, when Frank and Gerard started falling in love, Gerard got scared. He was heavily depressed and I still believe that he’s terrified of people hating on him, and when he told Frank that he could never ever made their relationship public, Frank got pissed at him.\n\nMoving on to chaos tour, Gerard was at his worst. He was taking drugs, getting wasted every fucking day and the person who never left his side was Frank. I think it’s very interesting (in the video of the bushes and Gerard) how Gerard is literally throwing up, and while the other guy stays away from Gerard, Frank goes with him and puts his arm around Gerard’s shoulder while he’s puking his guts out. Yeah, sure, it could be just that Frank is a very good friend, but if you look at the general picture, I think Frank had fallen pretty hard for Gerard and he was determined to be there no matter what. Here’s when Bert appears in the story, I do believe him and Gerard had something. Not meaningful, no feelings involved. But they definitely were fuck buddies, and maybe that’s what Gerard needed back then. i think it’s pretty alluring how Frank never appears in a photo with Bert alone, i mean they were touring together for two months and there isn't a fucking photo of Frank and Bert. Pretty damn suspicious. Now, Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge is for me a declaration that Gerard does in fact like guys and that something was going on between him and Frank. (i will make an analysis of the album soon).\n\nThis is when things get interesting: Gerard gets sober, Bert gets pissed because Gerard doesn’t want to hang out with him anymore (I do think Bert had some sort of feelings for Gerard) and Frank and Gerard are all over each other again, but not only on stage, when they are off stage they still do pretty ''couple-ly'' stuff: Frank sits on Gerard's lap and caresses his face, the hugs, the touching. Everything. Wasn't it called ''stage gay''? why are they doing it off stage, then? Another thing i find interesting is that Frank got the bird's tattoos around this time, which magically coincides with the time Gerard and Frank wore their special makeup and look at this:\n\nThey go to the Paramour Mansion to record The Black Parade. I don’t know what happened in that house, but after that Gerard and Frank don’t even look at each other on stage. Frank suddenly gets engaged with Jamia, and Gerard apparently gets engaged with some psycho stalker named Eliza. If you ask me, it’s suspicious. They stop doing what they usually do, touching each other, flirting and Frank gets engaged. And Gerard reacts by getting himself engaged, it’s like Gerard is telling Frank ‘’hey, look, I don’t need you, I don’t love you.’’ Apparently, a message appeared all over the internet warning Gerard about Eliza, and APPARENTLY it was Frank who wrote it. Too much of a coincidence, don't you think? Also, Eliza was fucking nuts, she wrote her own fanfiction about her relationship with Gerard. She was a stalker and really, really obsessive. It seems to me that Gerard just started dating the first girl that he saw because he was fucking jealous.\n\nEven if they weren't being as explicit as in Revenge Era, it was pretty obvious that the bond was still there. They just got more careful. Now, why would they feel like getting more careful if there was nothing going on between them? Why did they feel like hiding? It was very subtle, but it was there. Like the mustache joke, Gerard would stop doing an interview just to answer Frank's mustache gesture. Now, i've looked up what this gesture means, and apparently it's an euphemism for ''mustache ride'' (sexually explicit, don't click if easily impressed). Obviously, i don't know if this is what they meant by doing that, but i just find that there are too many coincidences in this story.\n\nThen, ProjRev starts, and everything seems to not only go back to normal, but to increase like 100%. We’ve all seen the kisses, the touching, almost fucking each other on stage things. And if you ask me, I think this is when they looked the happiest, even Gerard has said so himself. Gerard broke his engagement with Eliza, apparently he broke up with hair by a phone call and Frank was ready to tell the world about them (why hadn’t he married Jamia by then?) but then again, Gerard got scared and LynZ was the perfect cover. Starting to date Lyn didn’t stop Gerard, though. Here's a quote i reckon you'll find interesting:\n\nIt is often my nature to be abstract, hidden in plain sight, or nowhere at all. - Gerard Way.\n\nHe and Frank continued doing their thing, being all sexual and lovely on stage and suddenly, we have the fight on stage.\n\nNow, if you watch the youtube video, Frank stands up on what I think is a speaker or an amp and goes to hug Gerard, but Gerard pushes him away and Frank falls on top of him and they start to push each other around very, very violently. When the song ends, Gerard starts kicking stuff and he looks pissed as fuck. My guess is that Lyn had told Gerard to stop messing with Frank on stage, he went to tell Frank that it had to stop and Frank didn’t take it too well. I mean, they were in love, and Gerard was being a coward, he was ashamed of their relationship and I don’t give a fuck that he’s been open about gay stuff, he’s never had the guts to neither deny nor admit if he likes guys or anything regarding Frank. Anyways, just a few days or weeks after the fight, Gerard is getting married backstage with LynZ. His own brother wasn’t there, and if there was nothing more going on between Frank and him, if they were just best friends, what was then the reason he didn’t tell his ‘’best friend’’ that he was getting married? Why did Frank have to find out through Ray? There’s a few people that claim they saw Frank leaving the wedding in tears, and since there’s no visual proof, I don’t know if it’s true, but I do think it’s a huge possibility. A few weeks after that, Frank is doing a radio interview and he has been all chirpy and stuff, but when the radio host asks about Gerard’s wedding, he stutters. He’s all ‘’uh… it… it was very… sweet’’ and then he says ‘’Yea, I guess I’ll be the next one to get married.’’ After that, in the live from Hoboken, Gerard is trying so hard to get Frank’s attention during the show, but Frank ignores him. Then comes the huge part, when they are performing I’m not Okay and Frank instead of saying ‘’trust me’’ says ‘’lie to me’’ and mutters ‘’I’m not o-fucking-kay’’ looking directly at Gerard.\n\nThen, he goes with LeATHERMOUTH and sings his heart out, I mean, you can see he was depressed. Why would he be depressed if there was nothing going on between Gerard and him? They are both ‘’happily’’ married, aren’t they? Also, this is the time Gerard writes The World is Ugly and Boy Division, both of the songs talk about Frank in my opinion.\n\nAs you know, Gerard calls Frank and tells him he misses him, he misses creating with him and they get back together\n\nBut that November I got a call from Gerard that snapped me out of it. We talked for awhile about the band, about why we loved and hated it. We left the conversation with promises to to communicate and plans for a new record in place. In the coming months we forged ahead. Ideas started to take shape….there were conversations about what the songs should sound like, the trading of mix tapes for inspiration, and finally flights were booked to our adopted home of Los Angeles for pre-production. Looking back to that first phone call, what I think we meant to say to one another was “I miss you. I like making music with you, and in spite of all the other shit that comes with it, good and bad, I still wanna do that.”- Frank Iero.\n\nFrank gets the ‘’I miss you terribly’’ tattoo\n\nand they start recording Danger Days.\n\nNow, all through the Danger Days era, they look at each other like they are in love. Just look at the videos, it’s there. They are completely love-struck. The Danger Days Box the guys DIY-ed is covered in frerard stuff. ‘’I miss you’’ ‘’come home’’ ‘’I forgive you’’ I think it’s pretty damn clear, this is them getting back together not only as musicians but as lovers. During this era, Gerard acts like Frank is this precious treasure of his, checking his temperature during a show because Frank had a fever, for example.\n\nThey are doing an interview and Gerard reaches for Frank’s hand, and when Frank suddenly moves his hand Gerard realizes what he’s doing and takes his hand back, his face is awesome. He’s like ‘’Jesus, I was so close to grab his hand in public.’’\n\nAnd this is the worst part for me. The break up. All of them were really excited about MCR5 and suddenly, they break up. Out of the blue. I know Gerard has said he ‘’started slipping into old habits.’’ I guess that he is referring to alcohol and drugs, and if continuing with the band was making him be self-destructive, he did well calling things to an end. I don’t get people who hate on Gerard and say that it’s his fault that the band ended, he’s a human being. Can you really call yourselves fans when you’d rather watch the singer being destroyed than the band ending? Now, I’m not saying frerard was the big reason why they ended things, but I do believe it was part of it. Gerard didn’t want to go public and destroy his fake, plastic life and Frank was getting tired of it again. I think they both knew that they were going back to post-ProjRev era, when Frank was depressed and they weren’t talking and they decided to end things and continuing in the band together wasn’t going to help.\n\nCurrently, we have .stomachaches. which is an album that talks about heart-break and sadness (why would a happily married man feel the need to talk about that?) and Hesitant Alien, which seems super-duper positive, but there are notes of sadness, of missing someone there.\n\nNow, we all know that Gerard feels inclined to adopt this personas in each of his albums, first it was The Patient in The Black Parade, then Party Poison in Danger Days. I think that the Gerard we see now, the Gerard with suits, all chirpy and cynical is nothing but another persona, another character of his and I do think he’s hiding behind it because he doesn’t want to face the truth, that he misses everyone. The vibe I catch from Gerard is that he’s seeing himself as this kind of huge inspiration for people and he loves being adored, while Frank is being a humble little man who only wants to make music. They barely interact through social media, and it makes me sad, because even if frerard wasn’t real, they were best-friends. They were always together, 24/7, and now they are hardly talking.\n\nThis is what makes sense for me, this is what I believe. I don’t know if it’s the truth, but I think it’s more reasonable than all the ‘’stage gay’’ and ‘’we’re just friends’’ bullshit.\n\nAs for the future, I do see MCR getting back together. I think Frank was devastated after the break up, and he misses it. Gerard misses it too, but he ‘’wants to show the world what he has to offer as a solo artist’’ or some bullshit like that, and believe me, I think they’d eventually get back because they love each other."
