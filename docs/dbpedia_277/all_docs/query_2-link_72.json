        "text": "“Headfirst for Halos” was written after Frank Iero was high as a joke!\n\n“I Never Told You What I Do For A Living” also featured in the film “House of Wax” and is on the official soundtrack.\n\n“Skylines and Turnstiles” was the first song My Chemical Romance ever wrote.\n\n“Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge” was dedicated to the memory of Elena Lee Rush and Maria Jose Santos\n\nAfter witnesing the attacks of September 11, Gerard Way and former drummer, Matt Peliser, wrote “Skylines and Turnstiles”.\n\nApparently, their third album will be released on October 24th, 2006 and the first single off that album will be released on October 9th, 2006.\n\nCartoon Network turned down Gerard’s cartoon “The Breakfast Monkey”, even though that’s one awesome cartoon.\n\nFrank has a girlfriend.\n\nFrank has a tattoo around his wrists that reads “I wish I were a ghost”.\n\nFrank has his own clothing line, record label, and publishing company called Skeleton Crew.\n\nFrank has various tattoes on his body which most of them are “NJ” for New Jersey.\n\nFrank Iero has a tattoo on the in side of his lip.\n\nFrank Iero Has Halloween Tattooed on his knukles.\n\nFrank Iero used to have a band called Pencey Prep.\n\nFrank is supposedly scared of spiders.\n\nFrank learned to play guitar by imitating Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day.\n\nFrank, Mikey, and Gerard smoke.\n\nGenre: Rock\n\nGerard and Mikey are 1/2 Italian (mother’s side) and 1/2 Scottish (father’s side)\n\nGerard and Mikey Way’s favourite song of “THE BLACK PARADE” 3rd album is “The Black Parade”, Frank Iero’s favourite song of that album is “Cancer”.\n\nGerard dyed his hair because as many fans know each album has a story, this time with The Black Parade (My Chemical Romance’s third album) Gerard wanted to look like the main character, a man who had just gone through chemotherapy, hence his dark locks are gone and he now has buzzed blonde hair, causing some fans to become upset.\n\nGerard has a friendship ring that is constantly mistaken for a wedding ring.\n\nGerard was once attacked by a bird! It flew straight into his head! He says, “It was the craziest thing that’s ever happened to me. The bird just started pecking the heck outta of me.”\n\nGerard Way always wanted to be in musicals he said so in The Black Parade Press Conferance part 4.\n\nGerard Way and Bob Bryer were severly injured in the making of “Welcome to the Black Parade” which left Gerard on crutches and Bob in stiches and in the hospital for infection.\n\nGerard Way and Gabriel Ba are said to be coming out with a comic titled The Umbrella Academy.\n\nGerard Way got married on September 3, 2007.

It is also thought that he may have been kicked out due to too many errors during live shows.\n\nMCR is notorious for making songs that don’t have the title in the lyrics.\n\nMCR’s third single from “The Black Parade” is “I Don’t Love You”.
