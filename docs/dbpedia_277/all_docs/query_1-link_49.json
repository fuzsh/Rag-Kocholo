        "text": "Casual Interactions #3: Full Transcription\n\nFrank: I don’t know if you guys remember this, but yes, in addition to Shaun reciprocating by buying Hambone a car, my reciprocation-\n\nJohn: Oh god.\n\nShaun: What the hell did you do?\n\nF: What I did was, I came in one day, and I went down- sat down to play video games at the station that we had, and there was nothing left, and Hambone was like, “Oh, I sold them all at Cash Converters.”\n\nJ: Yeah!\n\nF: I was like, “Oh! Okay.”\n\nS: And they were all yours!\n\nF: Yeah!\n\nS: Oh!\n\nF: Yeah. So-\n\nS: That was nice of you, Frank.\n\nF: That was nice of me. I’m just saying-\n\nS: That was good.\n\nF: That we all reciprocate in different ways.\n\nJ: We all reciprocate in different ways. Cash Converters, we sold a lot of gear to to pay for the first tour!\n\nF: Yes!\n\nJ: Cash Converters is, or was, I think, a larger-\n\nF: Very- a literal corporation.\n\nJ: A corporation. It’s a corporate pawn shop.\n\nF: Yes.\n\nJ: Which was down the street from the porn shop in, I think, Little Ferry.\n\nF: Yes!\n\nJ: And you would go there-\n\nF: It depends on how you search for it. You’re going to either one. It depends on how you spell it. If you’re a good speller-\n\nJ: Yeah.\n\nF: I don’t know, you might just end at both.\n\nJ: There’s a small line between “pawn” and “porn,” and “Santa” and “Satan,” right?\n\nF: Yes. And “satin.”\n\nJ: And “satin.”\n\nF: Yeah.\n\nJ: So welcome to the Casual Interactions podcast. We are gonna continue with our origin story. I’m John “Hambone” and with me, as always, is Frank Iero and Shaun Simon. How you doing today, Frank?\n\nF: I’m doing good! I’m hopped up on Red Bull. Peeing like a madman.\n\nS: I can’t drink that stuff.\n\nJ: I used to be off it, but now I’m back on.\n\nF: Yeah? You’re back on the Bull?\n\nJ: I’m riding the Bull.\n\nS: Back on the Bull.\n\nJ: I’m riding the Bull again. How you doing, Shaun?\n\nS: I’m good, man.\n\nJ: Yeah?\n\nS: Thanks.\n\nF: I’m drinking it, though, because I’m getting prepared. I’m going to go see the Red Bulls play with my daughter, Cherry.\n\nJ: Oh, cool!\n\nF: We’re very excited about this.\n\nS: What are the Red Bulls?\n\nF: They’re a soccer team.\n\nJ: You go down to the soccer stadium in Harrison?\n\nF: This is gonna be my first time down there.\n\nJ: Okay, cool!\n\nF: I support Liverpool, LFC. And they came over and they played, like a pre-season exhibition game. And I went and got tickets, and me and my friends went and it was awesome! And then I noticed that Cherry was like, really upset because she like, really wanted to go. And so I was like, “Oh, man.” I was like, “Well, what if we went to, you know, like a soccer team here?” And the local team is the Red Bulls. I mean, there’s a New York City team as well, but the Jersey team is the Red Bulls, so we’re gonna go see them.\n\nJ: See, that was the one thing we always had in the studio back in the day, was Red Bull. Because I was working in a bar and I made fast friends with the Red Bull distributor so-\n\nF: Nice!\n\nJ: I just kept upping the orders for him and then suddenly he’d be like, “Oh, hey, I’m out in the parking lot. Can I talk to you for a second?” And he would just pop the back of the truck open and there’d be- he just put cases of Red Bull in my car.\n\nF: Fuck yeah! They did like, weird flavored ones that were really good too.\n\nJ: Oh, there’s a lime one that’s pretty good.\n\nF: Yeah!\n\nJ: I had that recently. I should probably, like, just stick to coffee but man, sometimes you just gotta ride that Bull.\n\nF: Is Red Bull- the Red Bull and vodka thing, I haven’t had one of those in a really long time. But is that still like, real bad for you? Did they change that?\n\nS: I don’t know.\n\nF: Have they changed their stance on that yet?\n\nJ: That’s why I barely remember Las Vegas.\n\nF: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nJ: So, today we’re gonna talk a little bit more about our origin story. And what we’re gonna talk about is touring and travelling, because touring and travelling now is very different than touring and travelling back when we were first a band.\n\nF: Yes. You needed an atlas.\n\nJ: An atlas.\n\nF: Yeah, and an abacus. Yeah.\n\nJ: Yeah.\n\nF: A lot of things starting with A, and ending in cus-es.\n\nJ: Shaun, are you uh, any good at reading maps?\n\nS: I have a pretty good sense of direction.\n\nF: Do you really?\n\nS: I don’t know about out in the middle of Iowa, but around here I do.\n\nF: I’m terrible. Terrible. I can’t even- I can’t get up from this chair and go find the bathroom without a GPS.\n\nJ: Yeah, it’s a good thing you drew a map.\n\nF: I can’t even read it!\n\nJ: Yeah. So we-\n\nF: It’s just squiggles.\n\nJ: We travelled a lot as a band. We did travel as a band. We went through, I’m gonna say- there was the original Pencey Prep van. Madame Yellow was the original van.\n\nS: That’s what we named it.\n\nF: Yellow Submarine.\n\nJ: Yeah. Yeah. And I remember my mom got really mad about that one day, because we had a- I had an air freshener of a topless girl.\n\nF: Oh!\n\nJ: And she was like, “What if the neighbors see it?!” Like, “Mom, they know I’m in a band! I’m a bad boy!”\n\nF: “Mom, I’m in a band, there’s gonna be tits!”\n\nJ: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Well, I mean, look back in the day at car washes, that’s- you had two choices of air fresheners.\n\nF: This is true.\n\nJ: You had the pine trees or you had the tits.\n\nF: Yep.\n\nJ: So we went in another direction, and I got yelled at by my mother.\n\nF: Tit trees.\n\nJ: Tit trees.\n\nS: There you go!\n\nJ: There you go!\n\nF: Sundries, and tit trees. Um-\n\nJ: So yeah, we had that first one.\n\nF: Do you remember the paint job that our friend Marco put on Madame Yellow after Thanksgiving?\n\nJ: Oh no, what was it?\n\nF: It was vomit!\n\nJ: Oh, that’s right!\n\nF: It stayed there.\n\nS: He threw up on it?\n\nF: Here’s what happened. We all went out, because big drinking night is-\n\nJ: The night before Thanksgiving.\n\nF: Everybody comes home, colleges or whatever, and we all went out, and our friend Marco was around. We all went out drinking. And you drove Marco home.\n\nJ: I shouldn’t have driven him home.\n\nF: And he leaned out and just painted the side of the van, and I think out of spite, we left it. You said that he had to clean it.\n\nJ: I did say he had to clean it, yeah.\n\nF: That was like, that was your stance on it. You were like, “No, no one cleans it. Marco has to clean it.” And we didn’t see Marco for a very long time!\n\nJ: He was embarrassed! He moved!\n\nF: And you were like, “This is a lesson that he has to learn,” but yeah, I don’t think it affected him really!\n\nJ: No, he didn’t care. It’s funny because earlier that year he like, was- earlier that year he was really thankful because I took him to Maxwell’s to go see Seven Year Bitch.\n\nF: Okay.\n\nJ: And I introduced him to Joan Jett, and he had no idea who Joan Jett was. Now this is so many years ago. It was Seven Year Bitch, Pansy Division, and Joan Jett was, I think, living in Hoboken at the time so she used to just go to shows.\n\nF: Yeah.\n\nJ: So he’s sitting outside. It got too hot in the club for him. And I’m sitting there, and I’m actually talking to Joan Jett, and I was like, “Hey, don’t go anywhere.” I ran outside, I grab him, and I was like, “You need to come inside right now. You gotta meet Joan Jett.” He goes, “Who’s Joan Jett?” And I just stopped dead in my tracks and I look at him and I say, “Marco, when you figure this out tomorrow, you are going to be really happy that I’m a good friend. Come here.” So, also, I just wanna say we do not advocate drinking and driving. Don’t drink and drive. Always call an Uber or a Lyft, whatever kind of ride sharing service you have. We made a lot of mistakes so you don’t have to.\n\nF: We don’t advocate drinking and meeting Joan Jett.\n\nJ: Yeah. Oh no, I highly advocate drinking and meeting Joan Jett. Listen, I totally- I totally asked Joan Jett for her number because you know what-\n\nF: Wow!\n\nJ: You miss 1000% of the shots you don’t take.\n\nF: There you go!\n\nJ: Yeah. No, it wasn’t happening.\n\nF: How’d that go?\n\nJ: She was like, “Oh, you’re so cute.” And she gave me a hug and a kiss on the cheek-\n\nF: Aw.\n\nJ: And she’s like, “You’re so nice. You’re a little too young for me,” and I’m like-\n\nF: Total crush.\n\nJ: Yeah, but look I- why not? I mean, I dragged out that jabroni in to meet Joan Jett. He didn’t know who she was. The next day though, he’s like, “Oh my god, I can’t believe I met Joan Jett!” I’m like, “You’re welcome.”\n\nF: Man.\n\nJ: So yeah, he puked on the side of the van. That was the first Pencey Prep van. Then we had another van that was like, a fly by night van that was the first like, Econoline van that we had. We shared between like, Pencey Prep and My Chem.\n\nF: That came from Dan Parks.\n\nJ: That came from Dan Parks.\n\nF: Yes.\n\nJ: And that quickly died.\n\nS: It had a- is that the one that had a loft on top?\n\nF: Actually, I’m sorry. That was the second Econoline van, that came from Dan Parks. The first one was the Lawrence Arms van.\n\nJ: The first one was the Lawrence Arms van!\n\nS: That’s right.\n\nF: That’s what it was.\n\nJ: So Lawrence Arms were passing through on tour and they were partying at the local party house with all of us, and their van died. And this is, I think, right around the time Agony and Apathy came out.\n\nF: Ok.\n\nJ: Don’t fact check me on that, but if you Google it, the record with Apathy in the title, it’s really good. It’s got “Porno and Snuff Films” on it. And their van died on the side of road, and they’re like, “Well, if anyone wants to go get it, they can just have the van. We’ll just give it to you because our label’s gonna buy us a new van.” Or something along those lines. We were drinking so, I was like, “This is great idea!” Because their van was sweet! And it had like, a TV in it, and it had a hook up for video games, and like, the captain’s chairs. So we went, we got it, and I paid to have it fixed, and it ran for a while. So that was the first My Chem van.\n\nF: Everyone van. That was the first everyone van.\n\nJ: Everyone van. That was The Hostage. We went up the Massachusetts, Shaun, with The Hostage, in that van.\n\nS: That’s right. Yeah.\n\nJ: And that’s where one of our friends brought a bunch of drugs across state lines, and didn’t tell me until they got there because they knew I’d be mad.\n\nF: Yeah, well, you don’t tell somebody about that.\n\nJ: Also, don’t bring drugs across state lines, people. It’s a bad idea. So then we, yeah, so that van died. Then we get the Dan Parks van.\n\nF: Yes! Dan Parks was a friend through Eddie Auletta, and so thankful he gifted us an old Econoline van.\n\nJ: Yeah.\n\nF: That got us through a little of touring as well, like, you know, tri-state touring I think. Maybe the farthest we went down was maybe Baltimore with it.\n\nJ: Right.\n\nF: And up to Connecticut, Boston, something like that. Correct me on this one: Was it the Parks van or was it the Lawrence Arms van that, you would have to keep your feet on the center console because the fan, like, that kept the motor running, would try to come into the van?\n\nJ: That was the Parks van.\n\nF: That was the Parks van, okay.\n\nJ: Yeah, every van had their different-\n\nF: Death trap!\n\nJ: Different death traps.\n\nF: It was like a mouse trap, dude! Yeah.\n\nJ: The Pencey van had the gas seal.\n\nF: Mhm, yes.\n\nJ: The Lawrence van, it just would overheat a lot. It would just constantly overheat, but it would overheat like, when you were going at like, low speeds.\n\nF: I’m also positive that something was dead in there. We couldn’t find out what it was, ‘cause it was like this weird sweet, smell of decay that stayed-\n\nJ: There was a sweet smell of decay.\n\nS: Was that the one that, when I was on tour with you guys, that we had a tuna fish sandwich in there that we called Sweet Chubby?\n\nF: That wasn’t tuna fish! That was sausage!\n\nS: It was sausage?\n\nF: It was a link of sausage that was shrink wrapped, and it was called Sweet Chubby. That! Yeah, that I think was the Parks van. I think that was the Parks van. But yes, Sweet Chubby.\n\nS: Holy shit.\n\nJ: Yeah, each van had their own disastrous breakdown story. Now in the past episode, we did tell the story about breaking down in Minneapolis. The final ride of the Pencey Prep van, though, do you guys remember this?\n\nF: Oh, please, yes.\n\nJ: I was playing in a band called Sleep Station at the time. And My Chem was up and coming, and we were going to play the Walk Together, Rock Together festival in Long Island. We had some of us in our friend JJ’s car, the rest of us were in the Pencey Prep van with all the gear, and we’re driving down the Long Island expressway and the Pencey Prep van dies.\n\nF: Was Pencey not playing that show? Because I feel like Pencey played that show as well.\n\nS: I don’t think I was there.\n\nF: No?\n\nJ: No, Shaun was- this was like the one adventure Shaun wasn’t on with us.\n\nF: Oh, man. Alright.\n\nJ: And it would’ve been better if you were there.\n\nF: [burps] I agree.\n\nJ: So, this is back in the day when Stacker2 still had trucker speed in it.\n\nS: Oh my god.\n\nF: Yeah.\n\nS: I took that shit.\n\nJ: And uh, yeah, and Shaun Hines was there with us too, on that trip, because we broke down center lane on the Long Island expressway. And so, they actually had the cops-\n\nF: Literally- I’m sorry, I don’t mean to interrupt, but literally the worst road in the world!\n\nJ: The absolute worst road in the world.\n\nF: It’s like- fuck, man!\n\nJ: It’s that and the 495 going down into DC. You don’t wanna break down there.\n\nF: No.\n\nJ: So we broke down center lane, the cops had to come, and they had to shut the entire highway down to push the van off to the side of the road.\n\nF: Oh, yeah.\n\nJ: So, we ordered a pizza and had it delivered to the side of the road. I had AAA Plus so I-\n\nF: Well, you had AAA, I think someone else had AAA, and I had AAA, so we all- we could combine the mileage-\n\nJ: Like a AAA voltron.\n\nF: Yeah.\n\nJ: And we made the gig that night. We actually had the van with all the gear towed to-\n\nF: The show.\n\nJ: The show. We just took what we needed and put it in JJ’s car and sent the band that was supposed to be on first in the lineup ahead in the car. And the rest of us arrived there. And then we got the van towed back to the rehearsal space.\n\nF: The best part of that story as well, is that not everyone could fit in the second car.\n\nJ: Yeah.\n\nF: So myself, and I think, two or three other people hid in the van-\n\nJ: Oh yeah.\n\nF: As it got towed, underneath the gear.\n\nJ: Like a Han Solo smuggler spot.\n\nF: The fucking most dangerous thing in the world!\n\nJ: Oh, so stupid. So stupid. And Frank, you know, thank you because you rode back, so I wouldn’t have to ride alone, to Jersey with the van in the tow truck with me.\n\nF: Oh, yeah. Large Marge, dude!\n\nJ: Large Marge! And then the guy wanted a tip, and we’re like, “We don’t have any money!”\n\nF: Yeah! “Look at us!”\n\nJ: “We just linked a bunch of AAA cards together to get home!”\n\nF: “To get to a gig that didn’t pay us!”\n\nJ: Yeah.\n\nF: “Like, you fucking crazy?!”\n\nJ: Geez. Geez.\n\nF: Yeah.\n\nJ: So, we’re talking about tour stories and the difficulties that go into touring. You know, back then when we started touring, maps, road atlases.\n\nF: Yes.\n\nJ: Maybe one person in the band had a cell phone. Maybe someone had like, a Gameboy for entertainment. And that was really it. The internet wasn’t so much of a thing, where you could get in contact with different promoters. You’d have to constantly call clubs, you’d have to constantly- if you had an email, like, no one was able to, “Oh, I’m gonna reach into my pocket and pick up my phone and check my email.” Like, a club promoter or a booker would have to physically be sitting in front of their computer checking emails from bands. So, you would have a tour, and I’m gonna do air quotes here for people listening at home, “booked.”\n\nF: Right, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nJ: “Maybe?”\n\nF: Possibly.\n\nJ: And you’re just, it’s a crap shoot and you’re hoping for the best.\n\nF: Mhm. Stopping at pay phones and hoping to check back in but you really didn’t see that person from when you, air quotes again, “booked” the show, until when you showed up at, hopefully, the right address.\n\nJ: Right.\n\nF: And there was a show there.\n\nJ: So when we were coming up, you know, not a lot of bands from the area actually ever left town and went on tour.\n\nF: Right.\n\nJ: Because you had the spirit, you had the want, you had the desire to do it. No one was really doing it. Like, people were big. There were a lot of bigger bands but they were bigger like, local. Like, they would pack in the M&M Hall, they packed in the Wayne Firehouse.\n\nF: Garfield.\n\nJ: The Garfield. They weren’t actually leaving town too often. Maybe going to New York, maybe going to Connecticut, maybe their cousin knows someone at a club in Baltimore, they’d go down. But that was the extent of it. You know, we- in our group, we were some of the first people to get up and get the hell out of town.\n\nF: I remember like, being in a high school band. I was in a band called Sector 12, and uh, we got a- we landed a gig in like, Connecticut, opening for The Pietasters or something like that, and it was like, “We’re going on fucking tour!” You know what I mean? And we all just jumped in like, somebody’s old like, Oldsmobile. Dad’s Oldsmobile and drove up there. And it was like, I mean, we had that show and then maybe a show in like, upper Jersey on the way home, and that was- yeah! That was like, I was like, “We’re on tour!” And it was the greatest feeling in the world, and that’s how I knew that I would dedicate my life to this, no matter what.\n\nJ: Yeah, you went to Connecticut and then you went up to Randolph to play Obsessions and you had to sell tickets.\n\nF: Yeah, totally!\n\nJ: You told the promoter, “Oh no, someone stole them from me,” and then you played anyway.\n\nF: Oh, I have a great Obsessions story, by the way.\n\nJ: Do tell.\n\nF: So, alright. If anybody’s ever been to- I don’t- is that place still even there?\n\nJ: Uh, there’s- no.\n\nF: It can’t be. It can’t be.\n\nJ: Yeah.\n\nF: Alright, so anyway. Playing a show at Obsessions, again, I think either Pietasters, or god, one of those Moon Ska bands that like, ended up being like, blue band group (?) where it was like, never anybody from the original band. Like, it was just like, yeah, these factions playing in all different places. So, opening up for a ska band, having to sell 150 tickets, sold maybe 5 of them because nobody would spend the money on it, and we broke down, and ended up- actually, no, we didn’t break down! Bruno was in this band with me, who was actually instrumental in getting Pencey all together, and bringing us together as friends, he got pulled over and so I stopped with him, ahead of him, to like, let him know where the club was. And as I got out of the car, the cop arrested me.\n\nS: What?\n\nJ: Oh yeah, that’s right!\n\nF: Yeah! Yeah! The cop arrested me because he was like, “You can’t approach someone else being pulled over.”\n\nS: Oh!\n\nF: But I just wanted to tell him, “Hey, listen, it’s up on the right.”\n\nJ: Yeah.\n\nF: But he got like, freaked out, and like, threw me in the back of the cop car.\n\nS: Oh shit.\n\nJ: Because there’s no real text messaging back then.\n\nF: No! And so, then they took whatever car I was in to the show, Bruno left, and then I arrived at Obsessions in the back of a cop car at the gig!\n\nJ: Yeah, street cred level over 9,000.\n\nF: And then, I remember this. I remember getting out, being let out of the cop car, and unshackled, and then walking into the club, and some kid in line going, “That’s an entrance!”\n\nJ: Yeah.\n\nS: Oh man.\n\nJ: Yeah. It’s kind of what I imagine like, the catalyst for you actually getting out of the back of an armored truck for the VMAs that one year.\n\nF: Yeah, yeah! Basically, yeah.\n\nJ: Just at a much smaller scale.\n\nF: Yeah. Imagine like, showing up like a badass, in shackles, out of a cop car, and then you get up and play like, emo pop-punk. You know what I mean?\n\nJ: Yeah.\n\nF: It’s like, “Ehhh.”\n\nJ: Real nasally singing about feelings.\n\nF: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nJ: Yeah, the whole GG Allin entrance and the actual stage show just doesn’t-\n\nF: Yeah, like, “Oh, this guy’s definitely gonna get up on stage and eat his own shit!” You know what I mean? Like, “No. No, he just got hurt once.”\n\nJ: So, Shaun, what was your first touring experience like?\n\nS: Well it was the first Pencey tour, right?\n\nJ: Right.\n\nS: Yeah.\n\nF: How old were we, at that point? 19?\n\nS: 19, 20?\n\nJ: I think I was 22 at the time. I was 21, almost 22.\n\nS: So we were what then, 20?\n\nJ: Yeah, I’m two years older.\n\nF: Okay.\n\nJ: So, I was like 22, you guys were like 20. Was that the first time you’d really been out of town, Shaun?\n\nS: I mean, except on like, family vacations and stuff, yeah.\n\nJ: Right. But I mean for like, something other than family vacations.\n\nS: Oh, yeah! Yeah, absolutely, yeah.\n\nJ: You know, coming into being in a band where we just kinda wanted to hang out with you more, to now we’re actually gonna like, hop in a van together and go see the country.\n\nF: We got him on tour too. We were like, “Hey, Shaun, help us move this couch real quick.” And then just like, shoved him in a van!\n\nJ: Yeah.\n\nF: “Hey, we got free puppies in here, you wanna come see it?”\n\nJ: Yeah, like did you actually tell your parents you were leaving, Shaun, or you just like, disappeared for like, a week?\n\nS: Just called them a week later.\n\nJ: Yeah. That sounds about right.\n\nS: Yeah.\n\nF: Oh man. My first tour-\n\nJ: Right.\n\nF: Was actually with my father.\n\nJ: Really?\n\nF: My father’s band was uh, touring down in Virginia at Virginia Beach. And they were doing like a week of shows down there, and stuff like that. And I remember going down and teching for him, and I was like maybe 15.\n\nJ: That’s cool. So you started out as a roadie.\n\nF: I started as a roadie, yeah!\n\nJ: That’s awesome.\n\nF: Yeah.\n\nJ: See, that’s super cool. So, I mean I traveled before like, I’d gone on trips with my friends when I was like 17, 18, but that was the first, for me, tour as well. And you know, of course, the label we were on at the time, I would ask like, a bunch of questions like, “What should we do? What should we do with this?” And they were like, “I don’t know, just do whatever.” Like, just so useless when it came to kind of giving any kind of advice or leadership towards what we were supposed to do. So we were, I think, wildly unprepared for it.\n\nF: Oh, definitely!\n\nJ: Well, Neil had toured a little bit, but not-\n\nF: Yeah.\n\nJ: Not like this.\n\nF: Right. I think he let on more than he actually did, you know what I mean? I think there was like, he’d been in a band- he was in a band called Stick Figure Suicide.\n\nJ: Right.\n\nF: And they had done- they had gotten some popularity and done some things, so I feel like we looked to him for you know like, “Alright, well, how do we do this kind of thing? What do we do?”\n\nJ: Right. And he booked the tour.\n\nF: He did book the tour, yeah! He had connections and stuff like that. I think, you know, as a young person, when you have a little bit of experience, you feel that sense of power. So you start to like, stand up a little bit taller.\n\nJ: Oh yeah, absolutely.\n\nF: You get to be able to tell everybody what to do, kind of thing, you know? So uh, I think there was a little bit of that but I think, really truly, none of us really knew what the fuck we were doing.\n\nJ: Oh no, not at that level. And then the people that we did look to, were just, they had nothing for us. They had no advice, they had nothing. You know, I would call them from like, the road and be like, “Well, this is going on, like, what should we do?” And they were like, “I don’t know, man. Whatever. Do whatever you think you should do.”\n\nF: “Figure it out.”\n\nJ: “Figure it out.” And you know what? In hindsight, a lot of that really was good. It’s good advice for life because you have to be able to think on the fly in a lot of situations. You have to be able to kind of adjust and adapt to some situations. But man, a little heads up would’ve been nice!\n\nF: Yeah, but think about it like this, ready? When we were young, like how old were you- how old were your parents when you were born?\n\nJ: Oh, man. Um, so I’m 40. So they were like 30.\n\nF: 30, right?\n\nJ: Yep.\n\nF: Did you have a fucking clue as to what you were doing at 30?\n\nJ: Oh god, no!\n\nF: No! So neither did your parents, they just fucking faked it. Know what I mean?\n\nJ: That’s true. That’s true.\n\nF: Like, I have kids now, and they think I’m an adult, and that I know what the fuck I’m doing.\n\nS: Right.\n\nJ: Don’t, don’t-\n\nF: I have no fucking clue!\n\nJ: Don’t play this for them.\n\nF: Well, yeah! I mean, eventually they’re gonna hear it and they’re gonna get it. But they’re gonna understand later on-\n\nJ: No, I- you’re right. You’re absolutely right.\n\nF: When they have kids, you’re just trying to keep them alive and not die yourself. You know what I mean?\n\nJ: Yeah.\n\nF: Like, that’s really it essentially. Hopefully, you smile more than you frown, but you have no fucking clue what you’re doing!\n\nJ: Yeah, and neither did we. So we went out, we hit the road, we did the thing, we made the towns, barely.\n\nF: Mhm.\n\nJ: And we came back with less money in our pockets than when we left.\n\nF: Definitely.\n\nJ: So, all in all, I think it was a successful first tour because we learned a lot. For us to be able to get out there and to acquire the knowledge, because then after that, man, one under your belt-\n\nF: Yeah!\n\nJ: Then you’re just so much better.\n\nF: Then you can- then your posture is a little bit straighter, and you can tell everybody else what the fuck is going on because you did a tour. You toured, you know. “When I toured, you know.”\n\nJ: “When I toured.” Oh no, it’s great because you see bands at like local clubs being like, “Well, I feel like I need to go on later because I have work the next day.” And I’m like, “Yeah, whatever jerk.” Like, “What?” I’m just like, “When’s the last time you left town?” “We went on tour!” “Where’d you go?” “We went to New York and we went to Connecticut.” “That’s not a tour. Who’d you ever beat?”\n\nF: Definitely start judging people.\n\nJ: Yeah.\n\nF: My favorite too now is like, when you see like, people like, you know, at local shows and stuff like that, or whatever, and they have like, the laminates just hanging.\n\nJ: Oh yeah.\n\nS: Oh right!\n\nF: Remember those kids who used to have laminates hanging, and you’re like, when you’re younger, you’re like, “Oh my god, look, they got laminates. They’ve been on tour, holy shit.” And now you’re just like, “You fucking jerks. Get that fucking laminate off you.”\n\nJ: “Yeah, come on. You don’t wear the title belt around the airport. Come on.”\n\nF: Yeah. “That’s just a luggage tag!”\n\nJ: “That’s just a luggage tag! Your mom’s address is on it, it’s not even yours! You don’t even own the house!” When we were younger though, we had a Kinkos around the corner from my house, so we would actually make all out own fliers at Kinkos. And we’d go in there and we would see bands that were going on the, air quotes, “tour,” and they were making their laminates there at Kinkos, when we were making fliers for our shows. Because we would make fliers for the shows that we were gonna go do in the towns we were going to, and then we’d walk around and hand out fliers.\n\nF: Yep.\n\nJ: Uh, to try to get more people to come out to the show. So it wasn’t just, “Well, Neil booked this tour.” It’s what happened when you got to town. Because you got a lot of hours to kill. For people who maybe have never been in a band, or been in a position where they have to go and do a soundcheck, and they’re from out of town, and you gotta there at like 4 or 5 o'clock in the afternoon to do a soundcheck. Maybe 7 o'clock at night, you’re not going on til midnight, it’s called hurry up and wait, because you’re going to be-\n\nF: A lot of that.\n\nJ: You’re rushing to get to the club, and then you’re there, and then all you can do is drink or go get a sandwich somewhere because there is nothing else happening until you get to get on stage that night.\n\nF: Mhm. I feel like too, back then, it was uh, a lot of- because you wanted to be there when doors- you didn’t know when you were gonna be able to get in.\n\nJ: Right.\n\nF: And load in, and stuff like that. And then also, you’d have to load in, and have to wait around for, you know, the sound guy who was usually, and I’m not saying that to all sound guys, but habitually, usually, the sound guy is a fucking mess.\n\nJ: Yeah.\n\nF: And- but acts like, you know, because everybody for some reason, I don’t know why, but, “I worked for Maiden!” Like, they all worked for Maiden at some point.\n\nJ: Maiden is a major corporation at this point.\n\nF: Yeah.\n\nJ: It’s like saying, “I worked for Target.”\n\nF: You know? And they have no time for your shit, no matter who you are.\n\nJ: Nope.\n\nF: “You’re doing it wrong, your equipment sucks, you’re too fucking loud.”\n\nJ: “Too loud.”\n\nF: And they have the best equipment but somehow they can’t get the vocal over the fucking- over the guitar sound. So, uh, yeah. That’s the other thing, it was like, “Alright, you gotta hurry up, wait for the sound guy that you’re gonna eventually fight with.”\n\nJ: Oh yeah. I was in-\n\nF: “About a show that you should all be in, like, on the same team, trying to make a good show.”\n\nJ: Yeah, absolutely.\n\nF: They don’t fucking give a shit about you!\n\nJ: No. I will say though, I was at Hank’s Saloon the other night playing a gig, and the sound guy comes up and I’m like, “Alright, I get it, I’m too loud,” and he goes, “No, you should turn up.”\n\nF: What?!\n\nJ: And I looked at him, and I’m like, “What kind of bizarre fucking world are we living in right now?” You know, and he was like, “Listen man, I want everyone to have a good time. I wanna make sure that you sound the best, so I sound the best.” And he’s like, “So let’s work together,” and I was like, “Where are you- and where have you been all my entire music career?”\n\nF: Seriously. Because I’m usually running into some weird racist fucking dude who has just, not like, he would much rather just mix nothing. Like, “I want no one here, so I can mix the radio,” I guess? I don’t know who he would really be preferring to mix.\n\nJ: Yeah. I used to have a running tally that I would keep in my guitar case of how many sound guys I’d come across that nodded off at the soundboard.\n\nF: Oh my god.\n\nJ: Like, you could actually- you see them and at first, their head’s down, they’re looking at the board, because it’s dark in most of these clubs. They’re looking at the board, and you see they’re kinda nodding their head, and like, you’re like, “Oh, maybe they’re digging the music,” and then like, their head doesn’t come back up, and they’re just kinda standing there. And you’re like, “Oh.”\n\nF: “Oh, he’s nodding off.”\n\nJ: “He’s nodding off.”\n\nF: “Got it.”\n\nJ: “Yeah, he thinks we suck.”\n\nF: Looking at cat videos on Instagram.\n\nJ: Yeah, we didn’t change that.\n\nF: Shit. Yeah. So alright, here’s my thing too like, as far as going back to the altas, right.\n\nJ: Right.\n\nF: And maps. Uh, back then when we were start- first started touring, like you had to buy those.\n\nJ: Oh yeah.\n\nF: Now, you go to a rest stop, they try to- they, “Please, take a map. They’re free.”\n\nS: Do they? Really?\n\nF: Yeah, they’re, “Just take one, please. We have all this paper printed. No one wants it.”\n\nJ: They printed so many, and they don’t wanna recycle it. They just like, “Please, just take these maps. Like, someone is gonna need to use a map one day.”\n\nF: “At some point.” Yeah.\n\nJ: You know, eventually, later on in- after uh, you went off to My Chem, I still- I went back and I started playing with Neil again. I was playing in a band called Fairmont with him which he still does to this day.\n\nS: Oh, that’s right, you did that.\n\nJ: Yeah, I did. I think I did like five or six years in Fairmont.\n\nS: I forgot about that.\n\nJ: Fairmont’s been around for, geez, I don’t know, like twelve, fifteen years.\n\nS: Was that before we did The Hostage?\n\nJ: It was right after we did The Hostage.\n\nS: Right after.\n\nJ: Yeah. And uh, I toured with Neil for years and the tours would get better, and it’s not uh, an indictment on Neil’s ability to book a tour, it’s just that the technology got better.\n\nF: Yeah.\n\nJ: So it was easier for him to communicate with the clubs. You’d actually have people checking their emails more, people in front of their computers more, cell phones started happening, so people would actually, “Oh! Oh yeah, you’re coming in. Oh yeah, totally. Here’s what’s going on.” So, it went from you hope you have a gig, to you’re sure you have a gig, to “Oh, we definitely have a gig. Here’s how much we’re getting paid. Here’s what’s expected of us.” And we actually printed out these maps from MapQuest, on how to get to the next town.\n\nF: That was the upgrade.\n\nJ: That was the upgrade from the old maps and the atlases.\n\nF: Do you think the people that printed like, the maps and atlases like, were at like, Y2K were like, “Oh, fuck!” Like, “This is our chance!”\n\nJ: Yeah.\n\nF: “Everybody’s gonna go down, they’ll need us again!” No?\n\nJ: That bat signal never went up for them, did it? It’s crazy too because I, you know, touring with you, when we did Leathermouth.\n\nF: Mhm.\n\nJ: We had uh, Vic, who was the driver. And like, you never saw a map in front of Vic. Vic knew every road like the back of his hand. I look at Google now when they do the little Google cars that do the street view of everything. Like, how many years it must have taken to get the street view of pretty much every street in America. Like, it’s crazy to think that’s been going on for years, and now like, if I’m trying to find someone’s house or if I’m trying to find like, a pizzeria, if I Google it, they actually show the map, and they show the building that I’m looking for. That’s crazy.\n\nF: Yeah. If you told me that as a kid, I’d be like, “Whoa. Am I gonna get a flying skateboard?”\n\nJ: Yeah.\n\nF: No, you can’t figure that out, right?\n\nJ: You can’t figure out a hoverboard.\n\nF: Got a fucking picture of everybody’s goddamn house, but you can’t invent a flying skateboard?\n\nJ: It’s the worst.\n\nF: You know, I will say this too, about uh, Neil’s hustle. He had that shit down where like, he got me and Shaun jobs at Staples.\n\nJ: He did.\n\nS: Oh fuck!\n\nF: This was, I mean, I don’t know if this is still like a really good idea for bands now, but I think it is. This was imperative to like, building Pencey, was us working at Staples and robbing them blind for making fliers.\n\nS: And just fucking with customers.\n\nF: Fucking with customers.\n\nS: We had a lot of fun there.\n\nF: Yeah, that definitely helped.\n\nJ: Yeah.\n\nF: But like, we would make fliers and merch. Like, we would make stickers and magnets and fucking t-shirt transfers and shit that we would just pretend it was for other customers, and make it for our band.\n\nS: Yeah.\n\nJ: No, it was great. I mean, the first batch of Pencey Prep t-shirts that we made, we silk screened in my basement. I got the silk screening gear that I borrowed from my friend Oliver/Levi (?) from down the block. He took me to Pearl Paint and i ranted to him the other night at a concert at Montclair and i’m so grateful to him because he turned me onto a lot of cool stuff and he taught me how to silk screen, so.. he took me to Pearl Paint- he lent me some gear, and then you guys come back with the transfer that we made the silk screen with. You know, but that’s what bands don’t do anymore, uh, because most people-\n\nF: They don’t steal?\n\nJ: Well, no. They well, you know. Allegedly, they don’t steal. Stealing is bad. Uh, no-\n\nF: I feel like that statute of limitations is up and we can talk about it.\n\nJ: Yeah, I mean, it’s been twenty years. Prove it.\n\nS: Yeah.\n\nJ: Where’s your security footage, guys? Come on. And that’s not a challenge. That is not- I’m not daring anybody to do that. You know, the thing is, bands now they- it’s all Facebook, promoting on Instagram.\n\nF: Yeah.\n\nJ: Twitter. Like, you know, the idea of us twenty years ago, even ten years ago like, walking around a town that we’ve never been in before.\n\nF: And flier-ing, yeah.\n\nJ: Flier-ing, going to record stores like, stapling posters to stuff. It doesn’t exist. It doesn’t exist anymore.\n\nF: Well, that was the thing too is like, we were able to barter with promoters. Be like,“Hey, listen, like, put us on this show, we’ll do all your flier-ing for you.”\n\nJ: Yeah.\n\nF: You know what I mean? And it wouldn’t cost us anything because we’d be at work making shit for our band.\n\nJ: Making shit for your band anyway.\n\nF: That was amazing. I think we did the first like, demo layouts and shit like that, too there.\n\nJ: We did. We did do the first demo layouts. Like, the ones that we hand cut ourselves and put into jewel cases that we stole from like, other CDs that we had lying around the house.\n\nF: Yeah. I did that shit like, later on too. Uh, for like a Death Spells, I did like a- I did a band with James Dewees called Death Spells, and we did like a cassette release where I did all that shit at Kinkos myself. And I did like, a Blood Nun thing with my other friend, uh, it just brought me back to those nights of us, you know, either stealing from Staples where we worked together, or being at the Kinkos by your house, Hambone, just hand cutting- that was the fucking coolest, funnest time.\n\nS: Yeah, it was.\n\nF: 3 o'clock in the morning at an all night Kinkos making demos.\n\nJ: Well, we used to take turns napping underneath the counter at Kinkos.\n\nF: Yep. Yeah.\n\nJ: Because it was 24 hours at the time, and it was right next to the diner. I mean, I was barbacking at the time, so I had just worked like, a double, and we practiced all day and I worked a double, and then we met up at Kinkos. We met up at Kinkos at like, I don’t know, like, 11:30 at night, 12 o'clock at night. And we printed til like 3 o'clock in the morning and we napped, and the next day we got up and we went on tour. You know, that’s the spirit and the beauty of the DIY ethic to me, where it’s not so much necessity, it’s fun.\n\nF: Yeah. It means more, too.\n\nJ: It means more.\n\nF: Yeah.\n\nJ: You know what it is to put those miles on your feet when you’re just trying to get someone to show up other than the bartender and bartender’s girlfriend.\n\nF: Right.\n\nJ: Who’s really not happy to be there to watch your band play.\n\nF: Yeah.\n\nJ: So you know, things are different now, and I wouldn’t say that they’re better, I just think it’s different.\n\nF: I have a question, right. Like, is there a scene now? Still? Is it different? I mean, I’ve seen a few like, smaller shows in like, New York City and stuff like that, but I feel like the Jersey one, I’m too far removed. You know? I was for uh, maybe a couple years ago, like, when my brother-in-law, Evan, was in Science, and he was doing uh, shows locally and stuff like that. I got a little bit more accustomed to like, the bands that were doing it, and uh, and all that. But I feel like now, like, I’m a little bit, I feel like it’s changed so much in these- in just the past five years.\n\nJ: Well, there’s a big indie rock scene. Now, I’m outside of it. I play in an outlaw country band called Secret Country now, like, that’s not- it’s not my world. However, we intersect with a lot of these bands because we play a lot in Jersey City. And Jersey City is just a playground for bands to be playing live music. The same thing with like, Asbury Park and other places. You know, Neil went on after doing Fairmont, he did a- he has a label called Mint 400, where for like- he’s gotta be like, ten years doing this now, where he promotes and he helps build up local bands. He puts out their projects, he puts on showcases at a bunch of different bars, and it’s not like when back in the day, you put on showcases. Like, these bands are hungry again. They’re hungry and they will pack in, I mean, they were doing Stosh’s the other night in Fair Lawn, and the place was packed. And it’s different bands they’re promoting, they’re hustling, they’re doing it differently though.\n\nF: See, that’s fucking awesome.\n\nJ: They’re more tech savvy than we were. They’re making like videos, and Instagram videos, and like little movies and shit. But yeah, I mean he is kind of the current like, standard bearer for indie rock in New Jersey. Just really trying to get bands uh, over, and he’s doing a good job of it.\n\nF: That’s awesome. I got a little disheartened when I was doing the Skeleton Crew label and I ran into a lot of bands that just didn’t wanna put in the work. They were just like, “Well, you know, you’re in a big band. Like, you’re gonna put our record out and just bring us on tour, and then we’re gonna be big, right?” And it’s like, “No, motherfucker.”\n\nJ: They thought because they were associated with you, who was super over at the time, and you know, I mean, that was Skeleton Crew so you had uh, The Black Parade hadn’t happened yet, right? It was just on the precipice of happening?\n\nF: I don’t know.\n\nJ: It’s right around that time. I mean, people definitely knew who My Chemical Romance was.\n\nF: Yeah.\n\nJ: So you have bands that are coming up that just, you’re right, they don’t wanna do the work. And you know, say what you will about Springsteen, he had a great quote once where he said, “It’s not getting signed. Getting signed shouldn’t be the end because it doesn’t stop when you get signed. It’s what happens after you get signed.”\n\nF: Yeah.\n\nJ: So, just because you get signed to a small label, a mid-tier label, a top-tier label like Warner Brothers, you gotta do the work.\n\nF: Mhm.\n\nJ: And if you’re not gonna put in the work, then you’re not gonna get anything out of it. I mean, maybe the lightning does strike you and you’re the one person who gets famous off of making some goofy video for a song. But that’s- after that, man, you know, you gotta put the time in.\n\nF: Yeah, I just, yeah. I didn’t- I don’t know. It didn’t make me want to put in any effort to help bands that didn’t wanna help themselves, you know?\n\nJ: Yeah. You had great t-shirts though.\n\nF: Oh, thanks! I can do a merch. I can do some merch. That I can do.\n\nJ: You merch like a motherfucker! Yeah.\n\nF: I’ll merch the shit out of you! No, but that like, that’s fun for me. Like, the design of it. And I really wanted so much to like, do that thing where you help bands like, become what they wanted to become, and get them to where they wanted to be. And then it bummed me out to see like, a lot of bands just be like, “Oh, well, you do it for me.”\n\nJ: Yeah.\n\nF: “You do it.”\n\nJ: Yeah, like. You know, we did it the hard way. When me, you, and Shaun did that first tour, we did everything the hard way. So, if you get to that point where, yeah, maybe there is catering or maybe you get a per diem or a buyout, or maybe you get a rider, or like, you know, a promoter actually promotes that you’re gonna be coming to the town. You earn that!\n\nF: Did we ever get a rider? We never got anything.\n\nS: Not in Pencey.\n\nF: Fuck no. Because I remember the first time I ever got anything, was on My Chem and we didn’t know we could ask for anything.\n\nS: We didn’t buy much.\n\nJ: Oh yeah.\n\nF: Somebody told us, like, “Hey, do you want to call ahead and see if you can get chips and salsa?” And we were like, “You can get chips and salsa?!”\n\nS: Chips and salsa! I remember chips and salsa! That was what it was!\n\nF: Yeah! That was it! And then we called fucking everybody and we were like, “Uh, can we get some chips and salsa?” And they were like, “Oh, yeah, sure.” We’re like, “Holy shit!” Then there was a discussion like, “Next time should we ask for peanut butter?” Like, we just like, kept going like that.\n\nJ: “Do you think we could get a pizza?”\n\nF: “No, you can’t get pizza. No. What are you, crazy?”\n\nJ: No, there were a few times-\n\nF: “What are you, Maiden?”\n\nJ: Yeah, right. Oh god. Well, there were a few times, I think, that we did get treated pretty cool. So the first big show that we had as Pencey Prep, I fast talked us onto the bill with Nada Surf at the Loop Lounge.\n\nS: Right.\n\nF: Oh, right, yeah.\n\nJ: Yeah, so. I got us on that, and then I ended up working there for like, seven, eight years afterwards, but that’s a story for another day.\n\nF: You became like an indentured servant!\n\nJ: Yeah, I got us like, one big show.\n\nF: You had to pay that off!\n\nJ: Well, they gave us two drink tickets apiece.\n\nF: Right.\n\nJ: Uh, and they definitely asked-\n\nF: And then they were like, “Now you can never leave.”\n\nJ: “Now you can never leave.” Yeah. Yeah. Oh my gosh, and then uh, Ricky took care of us when we played with Nada Surf again at the Bomb Shelter show at the Wayne Firehouse. Uh, Ricky always- Ricky was an independent promoter when we were younger and he was our age, and he was putting on all the best shows at the Wayne Firehouse and a couple other places. I mean, this is the kid who brought Alkaline Trio to New Jersey, he’s the kid who brought Hot Water Music, Jimmy Eat World.\n\nS: At The Drive In.\n\nJ: At The Drive In. You know, if there was a big, independent at the time, you know, we saw them at a local firehouse, for like seven bucks.\n\nF: Yeah, how crazy is that, man?\n\nS: Yeah.\n\nF: Jets To Brazil. I remember seeing Jets To Brazil at fucking Wayne Firehouse. But like, that was the thing like, that Bomb Shelter collective, man, like, Jamia, uh, Pelack, and Ricky, and like, just that’s what, I guess you wanna call it a scene.\n\nJ: That was the scene.\n\nF: Or that time, it was like, unbelievable. That was the most education I ever got. I went to college and high school, and all that stuff, and never finished it and never learned a fucking thing.\n\nJ: Nope.\n\nF: But in that like, span of a couple months going to see Bomb Shelter shows, holy shit man, it changed my entire fucking outlook on everything.\n\nJ: Yeah, we learned everything the hard way by hustling. Do you remember what the third and final like, big show that we had was, where we actually got treated right?\n\nF: Um-\n\nJ: It wasn’t Skate and Surf.\n\nF: Well, that was the biggest show we ever played.\n\nJ: That was the biggest show we ever played, but the one where we got treated real nice-\n\nF: Um, no.\n\nJ: We opened for The Strokes at Maxwell’s.\n\nS: Oh shit!\n\nF: Oh shit!\n\nS: That’s right!\n\nJ: We opened for The Strokes at Maxwell’s, and Maxwell’s was great because they would give you beers and then each member of the band got a meal, but it was like, a good meal. It wasn’t like, “Oh, here’s like, the crap that’s leftover.” You had like, a special band menu, but it was like the best food you’d eat all week. And then you played Maxwell’s which was a venue that was legendary in the state of New Jersey. And it held like, 200 people, and you would also see your favorite bands play there. So, The Strokes were just- they just dropped a hit. They had a demo out, uh, Last Nite was about to come out, and we somehow weaseled our way onto that show.\n\nF: Well, it was our show. We booked a show there.\n\nJ: Oh, that’s what it was.\n\nF: And they added The Strokes and a band called Longview.\n\nJ: And Longview, yeah.\n\nF: I believe, to the bill, and of course, they were like, the- you know, the buzz band of New York City, but I don’t think any of us had heard of The Strokes at that point.\n\nS: No.\n\nJ: No.\n\nF: And uh, we were like, “Who’s this band that they added on?” Of course, the show sold out, and we were like, “We fucking did it! Look at us! People like us!”\n\nJ: Like a bunch of jerks.\n\nS: Right.\n\nF: Totally, totally.\n\nJ: Oh, how wrong we were.\n\nF: Because of course, no one was there when we played, but it did fill up.\n\nJ: No no no.\n\nF: What? Go ahead.\n\nJ: They were there. They were all in the bar.\n\nF: The bar, yes yes yes.\n\nJ: Way in the other room. Because there was a bar in the room that we played, and there was a bar otherwise. And the place was packed, like, we walked in and we were like, “Oh my god, we’re gonna play for so many fucking people tonight!” And then we went, we soundchecked, we came out, we had our dinner, we saw all these people like, “Oh man, this is our night. Tonight’s the night!” And we go in there and uh, I think whoever’s girlfriends were there, at the time, and like, maybe my dad.\n\nF: Yeah.\n\nJ: Were the only people watching us. And then we get done, Longview comes up, and it’s kinda like the same thing for them as well, but more people came in because they-\n\nF: They were a New York City band.\n\nJ: They were a New York City band, and then The Strokes came on, and then there was no one in the outside bar where we were, and we just kinda- you know, we were like, “Well…”\n\nF: Harumph. Well, do you remember this?\n\nJ: “It looks good on the poster. We played with The Strokes.”\n\nF: We, while Longview was playing, we were downstairs and um, it was after our set, and we were kinda like, still buzzing a little bit. We played.\n\nJ: Yeah.\n\nF: You know what I mean? That was the thing.\n\nJ: That was the high. That’s always the high.\n\nF: It wasn’t even about like, people being there. Yeah. It’s not about people being there or liking your music, that’s the fucking cherry on top. You just get to play, and that’s the drug that you chase. You know, that high that you chase. And so, you played so you’re still buzzing, you’re feeling great. And some of The Strokes guys were there, and none of them were really talkative or all that nice. I think they were just a little bit offstandish, except for the drummer.\n\nJ: Right.\n\nF: Fab. And we all- I don’t know if you partook but we all got high.\n\nJ: Yeah. No, well I didn’t.\n\nF: And Bruno was there, our friend Bruno.\n\nJ: Oh god.\n\nF: And he took offense that they wouldn’t talk to us. Do you remember this?\n\nS: I remember this.\n\nJ: Uh huh, yeah.\n\nF: So then, The Strokes went onstage and he stole all their shoes.\n\nS: Yes. Right.\n\nF: So… Got ‘em!\n\nJ: Yeah, we did. So we’re gonna wrap up this episode on touring, part 3 of our origin story as friends. Frank, you got any last words on touring?\n\nF: Oh Jesus. No, I just- you know what? We should have a special where we- we’ll invite some friends.\n\nJ: Right.\n\nF: I think, from the past, and see if we can interview them about these times, and see if their-\n\nS: Oh, that would be fun.\n\nF: If their stories match up to our’s.\n\nJ: Right.\n\nF: Or! We invite them over, and then it’s like, what’s that guy, that Chris guy? Where he invites pedophiles over and then they get arrested for crimes, that we’ve admitted.\n\nJ: Oh my god! Frank!\n\nF: But we’re like, “Hey. Hey, uh, Bruno, would you come and get interviewed for our podcast?” And then he’s like, “Oh yeah, I stole their shoes.” And then we’re like, “Bruno, we’d like to have to meet uh, Officer Giles here! He’d like to talk to you about shoes that you stole!”\n\nJ: Oh, you know what, uh, I will say Bruno did very well for himself in life. He’s got a beautiful family, and I will always be grateful to him for bringing us all together. So cheers to you, Bruno. Thanks for being a part of what we did.\n\nF: Miss you, man! I haven’t seen him in forever.\n\nJ: I can track him down. We’ll get him on the show.\n\nF: Alright.\n\nS: Track him down.\n\nJ: Well, you know, I’m good at stuff.\n\nS: Yeah.\n\nF: Yeah! At investigative stuff.\n\nJ: How about you, Shaun? Any last words on touring?\n\nS: I don’t know, man. No.\n\nF: I remember later on, when touring got to you. You were like, “I am fucking done touring.” And do you remember this? It was overseas, you were on tour with My Chem.\n\nS: Oh, and I lost my fucking shoe.\n\nF: You lost your shoe.\n\nS: In Germany somewhere on the fucking road.\n\nF: In Germany, had one shoe.\n\nJ: One shoe.\n\nS: I was like, “Get me the fuck home, I’m done, man. I’m fucking done.”\n\nF: That’s what it takes though, sometimes, like you tour for a long time, and you’re out there, and it’s- yes, it’s you and your band and your friends versus the world. But sometimes, it just gets- it’s the travel.\n\nJ: It is the travel.\n\nF: It gets so much, and then you lose your fucking shoe, and you lose your goddamn mind.\n\nS: Right! Well, what it was too was that, it wasn’t my band.\n\nF: Yeah.\n\nS: So I was like, helping out with merch and it-\n\nJ: Cutting hair.\n\nS: While it was fun, it was like, “I’m not gonna be this dude that just latches on.”\n\nF: Right.\n\nS: You know what I’m saying?\n\nF: No, I hear you, yeah.\n\nS: So it was like, I needed to figure out my own shit too, so that kinda added to all of it too, you know what I mean?\n\nF: Mhm.\n\nS: So.\n\nF: Also, if you have one shoe, and you’re real far from home, and you don’t see like, the prospect of another shoe coming.\n\nS: That’s shitty, yeah.\n\nF: Like, that’s fucked! What the fuck do you do?!\n\nJ: Yeah.\n\nF: “It’s over. Fucking done now! What else can the universe take from me?”\n\nJ: Yeah.\n\nF: “My hands?!”\n\nJ: Was it the left foot or the right one?\n\nS: I don’t even know, man. It was- we stopped to piss on the side of the road and when we got back in, I was minus a shoe.\n\nF: Yep.\n\nJ: That’ll do it.\n\nF: Think about it.\n\nS: Yeah.\n\nF: “Now try putting both feet in one shoe for the rest of the tour.”\n\nJ: Some people are good at hopping.\n\nF: “Hop along.”\n\nJ: Yeah. So, that’ll be it for the Casual Interactions podcast. My words on touring are if you are in a band and you believe in yourself, invest in yourself, give it a try at least once. It is a lot easier now than it used to be, and it is a great way to see this beautiful country of ours, through the window of a van.\n\nF: Bring up a backup pair of shoes.\n\nJ: And bring up a backup pair of shoes. Because someone might steal them from you, or you might lose one in a field somewhere. So Frank, where can people find you?\n\nF: I am on Twitter @frankiero, I am on Instagram @frankieromustdie, and I have a wesbite frank-iero.com\n\nJ: Shaun, what do you have out right now?\n\nF: Wizard Beach.\n\nS: Yes! I keep forgetting it’s like, the same thing every time.\n\nF: Also too like, Art Ops, Trades, right?\n\nS: Oh, yeah, yeah! I write comics so there’s like, Art Ops, and Neverboy, and this book called True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys, and Wizard Beach is coming out soon. And there’s other stuff in the works, so.\n\nJ: Buy Shaun’s comics.\n\nS: Yeah!\n\nF: Fuck yeah.\n\nJ: You can find them wherever your comic stores are and by the time this episode does drop, Wizard Beach by BOOM!
