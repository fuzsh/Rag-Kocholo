        "text": "Frank Iero\n\nFrank Anthony Iero was born on October 31st, 1981 (making him a Scorpio), in Belleville, New Jersey. Not many people know how to say his last name, which is correctly pronounced \"eye-year-oh\". Frank is 5'4'' and has hazel eyes with a dark drown natural hair color (now dyed black). He grew up with his mom, Linda, who divorced his dad (a great influence to him over the years). Just like fellow band mate Gerard Way, he has been playing in bands since he was eleven. Frank went to a catholic school growing up, he was bullied in high school, he went to Rutgers University on a scholarship, but dropped out to join My Chemical Romance. Frank married his childhood sweetheard Jamia Nestor in March 2008 and he became the proud father of twin baby girls in September 2010.\n\nMy Chemical Romance\n\nHe currently is the rhythm guitarist for My Chemical Romance, and is the youngest member of the band. He was recruited after the band decided they needed another guitarist (in addition to Ray Toro) to fill out the sound. He also dropped out of college (and another band, Pencey Prep, scroll down for more) to pursue the band full time. Before he started playing with My Chemical Romance. Prior to joining My Chemical Romance Frank fronted Pencey Prep, he previouslly has also played with the bands Hybrid, Sector 12, and Give Up the Ghost. At the time when he joined My Chemical Romance, he had dreadlocks. Frank plays an Epiphone Elitist Les Paul Custom guitar with an Alpine White finish, among others. Frank has a penchant for naming his guitars such as \"Texas\", \"Bela\", \"Sinatra\", \"Angel\" and the one best known by fan was \"Pansy\". The demise of \"Pansy\" was long attributed to an unfortunate MTV Tech but it was later revealed that Frank had broken the guitar himself. Frank still has what is left of \"Pansy\".\n\nBody Art\n\nFrank has a lot of tattoos, he has the word \"HALLOWEEN\" tattooed on his fingers, a Jack O Lantern on his back, \"Keep the Faith\" on his upper back, the letters \"N.J.\" inside his lip standing for New Jersey, \"I wish I were a ghost\" around his right wrist, a dove on his left lower chest, an anchor on the lower part of his right bicep with an \"N\" and \"J\" on either side, a large chest piece, a scorpion on the right side of his neck and portraits of his grandparents on both arms to name but a few. Frank revealed in Life On The Murder Scene that he got the scorpion tattoo as high up on his body as he could once he decided that he didn’t want a real job.\n\nProne to Injuries\n\nHe unfortunately has suffered from Bronchitis and ear infections, as well as two broken toes, four chipped teeth, lacerations to hands, knees, and his head, numerous contusions and bruises, and endured a nasty case of mono. Alas, he still smokes.\n\nInterests\n\nSome of his favorite bands are Black Flag, American Nightmare, The Bouncing Souls, and The Beastie Boys. Frank loves reading books, especially the Harry Potter series. He admires Billie Joe Armstrong (front man of the punk band Green Day) so much he learned to play guitar by imitating him. He also plans on buying a guitar that looks like Billie Joe's. Frank’s favorite movies are Tim Burton’s Nightmare Before Christmas, Rushmore, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. He also once expressed a desire to meet Tim Burton. He loves dogs and has many to show it (at last count he had 12), he prefers sunsets to sunrise and claims he used to go for strolls in cemeteries claiming, \"It’s very peaceful.\"\n\nSide Projects\n\nFrank has his own clothing line, record label, and publishing company called Skeleton Crew. He is also the frontman of the band LeATHERMOUTH, and is involved in a tribute band to The Cure called The Love Cats.\n\nQuotes"
