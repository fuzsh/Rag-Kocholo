        "text": "My Chemical Romance (often shortened to MCR) is an American rock band that formed in 2001. The current members of the band are Gerard Way, Mikey Way, Frank Iero, Ray Toro and Bob Bryar. Shortly after forming, the band signed to Eyeball Records and released their debut album I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love in 2002. They signed with Reprise Records the next year and released their major label debut Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge in 2004. The album was a major commercial success, selling over one million copies due in part to the success of the singles “Helena”, “I’m Not Okay (I Promise)”, and “The Ghost of You”. The band followed this success with 2006’s The Black Parade, featuring their hit singles, “Welcome to the Black Parade”, “Famous Last Words”, “I Don’t Love You”, “Teenagers” and upcoming single “Mama”. While the band identifies their sound as simply “rock”, the subgenre of the band’s recordings has been a subject of debate among fans and the media. After a long honeymoon, Mikey Way returned to the band in time to support Bon Jovi. The band also recently filmed their October 7 show in Mexico City as The Black Parade. This will be made into a DVD which is due for release next year.\n\nEarly career (2001–2002)\n\nThe band was formed by frontman Gerard Way and ex-drummer Matt Pelissier around a week after the September 11, 2001 attacks. Witnessing the planes crash into the World Trade Center influenced Way’s life to the extent that he decided to start a band. Way wrote the song “Skylines and Turnstiles” to express his feelings about September 11th. Shortly thereafter, Ray Toro was called up and asked to join the band because at the time Way couldn’t sing and play the guitar at the same time. The first recording sessions were done in Pelissier’s attic, where the songs “Our Lady of Sorrows” (formerly called “Bring More Knives”) and “Cubicles” were recorded. Mikey Way, the younger brother of Gerard, loved the demo so much that he decided to join the band, dropping out of college and learning the bass guitair in order to do so.\n\nMy Chemical Romance was signed with Eyeball Records and played in the same room as Pencey Prep and Thursday. It was there that the band met Frank Iero, the lead vocalist and guitarist for Pencey Prep. After Pencey Prep broke up in 2001/2002, Frank became a guitarist for My Chemical Romance, just days before the band’s debut album was recorded. Three months after the formation of the band they recorded their debut album, I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love, subsequently released in 2002 on Eyeball Records. Despite only joining the band a few days before the album recording sessions began, Iero played guitar on two of the tracks, one of them being “Early Sunsets Over Monroeville”.\n\nMainstream breakthrough (2003–2006)\n\nIn 2003, the band signed a deal with Reprise Records. Following a tour with Avenged Sevenfold, the band began work on their second album, entitled Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge. Released in 2004, the album went platinum within a year. The band released three singles from the album: “I’m Not Okay (I Promise)”, “Helena” and “The Ghost of You”. It was during this time that the band replaced Matt Pelissier with Bob Bryar, after they went to Japan in July 2004. The true nature of Pelissier’s departure was due to an argument with band member Ray Toro as a result of mistakes made by the drummer during live performances.\n\nAt the start of 2005, the band was directly supported on the first ever Taste of Chaos tour, and was also the opening act for Green Day on the American Idiot tour. During the summer, they co-headlined the Warped Tour 2005 with Fall Out Boy. Later that year, My Chemical Romance co-headlined and headlined their own tour with Alkaline Trio and Reggie and the Full Effect around the US. That same year, My Chemical Romance collaborated with The Used for a cover of the Queen and David Bowie classic, “Under Pressure” that was released as a benefit single on iTunes and other Internet outlets.\n\nOn March 21, 2006, a 2 DVD/1 CD set entitled Life on the Murder Scene was released. It included one DVD chronicling the band’s history, and a second DVD with music videos, the making of their videos, and a couple of live performances. An unauthorized biography DVD Things That Make You Go MMM! was also released on June 27, 2006. The DVD does not actually feature any My Chemical Romance music clips or performances, but contains interviews with those who knew the band before much of their fame.\n\nThe band started recording their third studio album on April 10, 2006 with Rob Cavallo, producer of many of Green Day’s albums. It was originally thought to be titled The Rise and Fall of My Chemical Romance, but in an interview with Kerrang! magazine, Gerard Way suggested this was just the album’s working title, stating “It was never the title of the album, more a spoof, or joke.” On August 3, 2006, the band finished shooting the videos for their first two singles from the album, “Welcome to the Black Parade” and “Famous Last Words”, to be released on January 22, 2007. The video was directed by Sam Bayer, director of Nirvana’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit” and Green Day’s American Idiot videos. During the shoot for “Famous Last Words”, band members Gerard Way and Bob Bryar were injured. Way suffered torn ligaments in his ankle, and Bryar a burn to the leg which caused a severe staph infection that needed constant monitoring in hospital. Consequently, the band was forced to cancel a few tour dates. While these injuries were reported by several news agencies to have been the result of a car accident, a statement released by the band on their website and MySpace page has confirmed that these injuries occurred on the set of the video.\n\nThe Black Parade (August 2006–current)\n\nAnnouncement of The Black Parade at London Hammersmith Palais\n\nA biography titled Something Incredible This Way Comes was released, written by Paul Stenning (Published in 2006). It features their beginnings, right through to The Black Parade. On August 22, 2006, the band played a special one-off show at the 1800-capacity London Hammersmith Palais. The show sold out in 15 minutes prompting tickets being sold on eBay well over the tickets’ face value. The name of the album they promoted was announced and 20 people dressed in black capes with their faces obscured paraded around Hammersmith, followed by a large group of fans and street team members with signs saying “The Black Parade”. Later during the show the album title and the UK release date were confirmed. Prior to the band taking the stage it was announced that My Chemical Romance were unable to play, but they would be replaced by “The Black Parade”. After initial crowd hostility it became clear the band were simply performing under a pseudonym in keeping with the theme of the album. When the set began, the backdrop art displayed the words “The Black Parade”.\n\nOn September 2, 2006, My Chemical Romance posted “Welcome to the Black Parade” on their MySpace page and their PureVolume page. “Welcome to the Black Parade” had its first radio airing on September 11, 2006. On September 26, 2006 the “Welcome to the Black Parade” music video was released in the UK, and on September 27 in the US.\n\nOn October 12, 2006, My Chemical Romance made a rare in-store performance to 500 fans at Virgin Megastores on London’s Oxford Street. In order to get wristbands for the event, many fans slept outside the shop the previous night. British band Towers of London caused trouble at the event when the Towers guitarist, Dirk Tourette, allegedly flicked a cigarette butt at Bob Bryar while he was performing. “Welcome to the Black Parade” reached number one on October 15, 2006, on the UK Singles Chart, giving them their first number one. The Black Parade was released on October 23, 2006 in the United Kingdom and on October 24, 2006 in the United States.\n\nThe Black Parade World Tour started on February 22, 2007, with Rise Against, Thursday and Muse as support acts. At the first concert of the tour in Manchester, New Hampshire, My Chemical Romance announced the addition of Reggie and the Full Effect frontman James Dewees, who will play keyboards/synth on the tour. On March 12, 2007, the band appeared on the The Tonight Show with Jay Leno as the host. They played their single, “Famous Last Words” at the ending of the show as flames were bursting behind them.\n\nMy Chemical Romance received many positive and negative accolades. In Kerrang! magazine, issue 1138, My Chemical Romance won the following categories in the 2006 poll: Best Band, Worst Band, Best Album (The Black Parade), Worst Album (The Black Parade), Best Track (“Welcome to the Black Parade”), Best Video (“Welcome to the Black Parade”), Best Live Show, Best Thing about 2006, Worst Thing about 2006, Hero of 2006 (Gerard Way), Villain of 2006 (Gerard Way), and Sexiest Male (Gerard Way). Also, in issue 1139, Kerrang! rated The Black Parade as the 4th Greatest Album of 2006. In Rolling Stone magazine’s ranking of the top 50 albums of 2006, The Black Parade was voted the 20th best album of the year. My Chemical Romance won the award for “Best International Band” at the 2007 NME Awards. Gerard also won the “Hero of the Year” award.\n\nOn April 19, 2007, it was announced that Mikey Way would temporarily leave My Chemical Romance’s 2007 tour to spend time with his new wife, Alicia Simmons-Way. Mikey’s temporary replacement was Matt Cortez, a tech, and friend of the band. On August 29, 2007 during a concert in Holmdel, New Jersey, Mikey returned for the performance of the group’s song “I’m Not Okay (I Promise)”.\n\nDuring the third leg of The Black Parade World Tour with support act Muse, members of My Chemical Romance band and crew and members of Muse’s crew were struck by food poisoning, thus canceling six shows. My Chemical Romance was a part of Linkin Park’s Projekt Revolution tour in 2007, along with, Placebo, Mindless Self Indulgence, Saosin, Taking Back Sunday, HIM, and Linkin Park.\n\nFour original recordings from The Black Parade were featured on the Xbox 360 release of Guitar Hero II. “Dead!” was added to the song list in-game, and as of August 14, 2007 three more tracks were made available via bulk download from the Xbox Live Marketplace: “This is How I Disappear”, “Teenagers”, and “Famous Last Words”. The My Chemical Romance Track Pack is available for 500 Microsoft Points.\n\nIt was announced that My Chemical Romance will be on a headlining tour in Europe with Mindless Self Indulgence opening, starting in October 2007.\n\nIn September 2007, My Chemical Romance confirmed they have no plans to record a new album until at least mid-2008, though there are conflicting reports that the group will record late in 2007 for an early-2008 release.\n\nOn 2007-09-24, the group’s lead vocalist Gerard Way has stated the group plans to release two more singles from The Black Parade, both of which will feature music videos directed by Way himself. Mama was released on the 12th November 2007. Way also stated that bassist, and brother, Mikey Way will rejoin the group on tour, following his break from touring after his March 2007 marriage.\n\nDespite the group saying they would not write songs until 2008, they played a new song recently, titled “Stay Away”.\n\nMusical style and influences\n\nMy Chemical Romance’s music has been described by the media as “pop punk”, “emo”, “alternative rock”, “post-hardcore” and “punk revival”. The band themselves described their music as simply “rock” or “violent, dangerous pop” on their official website, as well as rejecting the term “emo” to describe their style, though another source quotes frontman Way stating that they are “What-else-ya-got-emo”. Frontman Gerard Way has recently stated in an interview that they were never Emo, as he says emo is “a pile of shit.”\n\nMy Chemical Romance cite their main influences as Queen, Thursday, Iron Maiden, The Misfits, Morrissey/The Smiths and the Beastie Boys. Gerard Way has said, “We love bands like Queen, where it’s huge and majestic, but also bands like Black Flag and the Misfits, who would go absolutely crazy.” Way has also said that his band patterns their career after that of The Smashing Pumpkins, another band they admire. Geoff Rickly, the lead singer of Thursday, has compared My Chemical Romance to Ink & Dagger. Growing up, they were also very influenced by horror films and comic books, and therefore their music, lyrics, and image all have overt elements of fantasy, storytelling, horror, and theatricality.\n\nThe band’s name “My Chemical Romance” is taken from the the Irvine Welsh novella collection Ecstasy: Three Tales of Chemical Romance.\n\nIn Life On The Murder Scene, Gerard Way says that they are “the most dangerous band in rock ‘n roll.”\n\nDISCOGRAPHY\n\n2002 ~ I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love\n\n2004 ~ Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge\n\n2006 ~ The Black Parade"
