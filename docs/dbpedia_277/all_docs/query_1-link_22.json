        "text": "A month after his last release, Frank Iero is back again with another merch drop!\n\nIero is known as the rhythm guitarist and backup vocalist of My Chemical Romance, along with his various successful solo projects over the years (the most recent iteration being Frank Iero and the Future Violents).\n\nAfter a cryptic tweet yesterday, fans spent the evening speculating what the announcement could be. However, the hint was staring back at us all along — a broken heart emoji a la the one and only Pencey Prep.\n\nBefore Iero joined My Chemical Romance in 2002, he was the guitarist and lead vocalist of the New Jersey punk rock band Pencey Prep. In addition to two EPs, the band only released one full-length album — Heartbreak In Stereo — in 2001 via Eyeball Records. Though the members parted ways the following year, fans of Iero have certainly not forgotten about this notable venture in his music career.\n\nThe most exciting item from this drop is undoubtedly Heartbreak In Stereo on vinyl. This marks the first time that this album has been pressed on vinyl, having only been previously available in the now incredibly rare and hard-to-find CD form. Fans have eagerly been asking for this record to be re-released for years on end, so this LP is absolutely a must-grab. This electric blue/oxblood vinyl is limited to 1000 copies.\n\nOther items include two t-shirts and a collegiate-style hoodie (The Catcher in the Rye, anyone?) Record and t-shirt/hoodie bundles are available for a discounted price.\n\nIn addition to this surprise Pencey Prep resurrection, Iero also released a new lineup of his solo merch! There are a variety of t-shirts, long sleeves, hoodies, sweatpants, and a face mask featuring the barbed wire heart, the cross, and a scorpion."
