        "text": "Let's start at the beginning of franks music career, you may have heard of a band called Pencey Prep, the band Frank was in before he joined My Chemical romance. At the time Frank was around 18 years old and so technically still a teenager with teenage issues. If you've listened to Pencey Prep, you'll know the songs I'm about to name.\n\nOne of Pencey Prep's songs is called 8th Grade, the lyrics are as follows:\n\nCaught staring again\n\nLike a deer in the headlights\n\nWhen I can't move fast enough\n\nI take a hit for the team\n\nPretty girl is blushing\n\nI can't tell if she's disgusted\n\nLaughter starts to swell\n\nLike someone gets the joke\n\nBell rings\n\nI make my escape\n\nIt helps a little\n\nBut doesn't save\n\nBeat down's a common thing\n\nIt happens every day\n\nMaybe I'm just strange\n\nCause I don't change schools\n\nMaybe I like the abuse\n\nOr maybe I'm just like you\n\nAnother confrontation\n\nYou've got something to prove\n\nYour girl can't tell how tough you are\n\nWhen you beat me up in the boy's room\n\nI made a big mistake\n\nBut I can't help who I like\n\nThis may not cost my life\n\nBut I am branded forever lame\n\nThis was not my decision\n\nYou were born with good looks\n\nAnd a solid right hook\n\nWhining makes no difference\n\nYou bruised my eye\n\nIt doesn't hurt at all\n\nOne day I'll rise above\n\nAnd you will take a fall\n\nI may be beat today\n\nBut I will survive\n\nI'll get up off the ground\n\nStand tall and fight\n\nMy eyes don't hurt at all\n\nI would rather die\n\nThan be your whipping boy\n\nSchool year's almost over\n\nSummer is one day closer\n\nAs God is my witness\n\nI will never be a victim again\n\nAs you can see I've put some of the lyrics in italics , because those lyrics, in my mind, are most important. Now Frank's supposedly admitted that this song is about liking another guy and even if Frank didn't say that, it's pretty obvious that that is in fact what it's about.\n\nFor example, the line, 'Caught staring again, like a deer in the headlights'. The image of a deer being caught in headlights, clearly gives the image of a deer running out in front of a car. This also symbolizes the vulnerability of the boy that the song is narrating and I know what some of you are thinking, that the song is a fictional story about some random boy that, 'Can't help' who he likes.\n\nWhen Pencey Prep ended, Frank joined MCR. However, he also joined a band called LeATHERMOUTH and the whole implication of Frank at least being bi continues. This next little section in quotation marks wasn't written by myself, I found it on a website, but the regular writing is me, analyzing it further.\n\n'Frank said in a LM show once: \"This is the LEATHERMOUTH, this song is called '5th Period Massacre', these are my friends and I'm the little faggot of MCR.\"' - I actually looked up the correct definition of 'Faggot' and yes, one of the definitions was: 'fagot: a bundle of sticks and branches bound together' but the other was, 'a male homosexual'. Now, I don't know about you, but, if you were straight, I doubt very much you'd announce to a whole room that you were homosexual if you weren't, am I right? You'd have to at least be bi or like men. The person's post then continues on an even more, say suspicious, note:\n\n'And there were rumors that Frank kissed one of the boys in the audience at the concert, but this is also what was said before he grabbed the boy: A guy who was half off the stage said, \"You're horrible!\" and Frank looked at him with a half smile and replied: \"I'm gonna suck you.\" and they played the next song, after the same guy from before announced, \"This is bad as hell!\" and Frank said again, \"Oh man, haha, if you think this bad, then you'll really hate this.\" and went to the '5th Period Massacre'. And again, after this song, the same guy said, \"YOU ARE FUCKING BAD!\" and Frank laughed and said, \"Oh man, you know what? I love you, where are you? I want to give you a kiss... Seriously, come here.\" And so Frank kissed him for about 45 seconds.'\n\nAgain, I doubt very much, if you were straight you'd randomly kiss a guy. I know a lot of straight males and every single one of them REFUSES to kiss another guy and yes, I am aware that there are some men that would kiss other guys even if they were straight. But for that length of time? A peck on the cheek or on the lips is more, 'acceptable' I suppose, but for 45 seconds? It really makes you think.\n\nMoving on, there's also many rumors that Frank admitted to liking men AND women to a magazine called, 'Teen Rock'. Sadly, it is extremely difficult to get hold of the magazine and it's not in English. I have researched into it and found someone on Yahoo answers had posted a question asking for people to translate a Spanish article they'd found. So, here's their post:\n\n'I have no clue what language these are. But I have to find out! lol :\n\n1:Frank Iero guitarrista de MCR admitio ser bisexual en una entrevista para la revista teenrocker y apesar de tener una pareja estable muchas veses a terminado besandose con Gerard Way el vocalista de MCR...\n\n2:Frank Iero, guitarrista de My Chemical Romance, dijo ser bisexual en una entrevista para la revista Teenrocker, y apesar de tener una pareja estable, muchas veces ha terminado en demostraciones muy afectivas\n\ny amorosas con el vocalista Gerard Way'\n\nUnderneath this, there were a few of people's translations, one of them being:\n\n'1. Frank Lero, a guitarist of MRC admitted being bisexual during an interview with the magazine Teen rocker and although he had a stable partner, he has ended up kissing with Gerard Way, the vocalist of the MCR...\n\n2. Frank Lero, Guitarist of My Chemical Romance, admitted to be bisexual during and interview for the magazine Teenrocker, and although he had a stable partner, he has ended up doing affective demonstrations with the vocalist Gerard Way'\n\nI know this person could've written it themselves, but it was posted up there many years ago.\n\nThe weird thing about all of this, is that this article seems to have literally disappeared, which brings me to the conclusion that perhaps someone got hurt from the comments made, or someone requested for anything to do with that article to be taken down off of the internet.\n\nThere's also that one famous quote of Frank, 'I would date Gerard' which could be taken as a joke but it just seems coincidental after everything that's happened between the two of them.\n\nPart 2 - Gerard\n\nGerard's quote claiming he 'Sucks way more dick than David Cassidy' I'm sure everyone has seen the video he says it.\n\nBut who is David Cassidy? David Cassidy is an American actor / singer / songwriter and isn't gay. Gerard could've just been sarcastic but I'm not entirely sure, because David Cassidy and Gerard Way are complete opposites and there are many different 'differences' Gerard could've listed than, 'I suck way more dick than David Cassidy'.\n\nSo I decided to do the obvious thing and just type in onto google, 'Is Gerard Way gay?' Not because I think he is, but I was just curious to see what people had posted. I clicked the first link which took me to Yahoo answers once again, this time someone had posted:\n\n'My sister heard gerard way(lead singer from my chemical romance) is \"gay\" with a band member from The Used. Is it true? Also is Gerard really gay? How did you find out?'\n\nThat was posted years ago and as I was looking at people's responses I saw that there were a lot of people saying no he's not gay, blah blah blah and I almost gave up looking until I saw someone's response, which was pretty interesting.\n\n'I heard about that to on a AOL interview! He didn't give a straight answer no pun intended'\n\n...Which of course got me frantically searching youtube with some sort of evidence to back this person up. But. I couldn't find it.\n\nAlthough I couldn't find that interview, it didn't matter. Because I've seen a newspaper article of Gerard admitting he likes men. (He quickly corrects himself, but he originally said men) and for this, I do have proof.\n\nNow, the truth is that Frank and Gerard hardly ever comment on their sexuality, IF SO, then it is extremely indirect. There was one interview after Gee had got married, he was asked about 'stage gay' or like that (can't remember the exact sounding of it) and his answer was along the lines 'she' (as in lynz) 'knows how it is, what I am-', He could've said 'Oh she knows i'm straight, man!' But he chose a completely different wording of it.\n\nGee appeared to like men a lot, we also had the thing with Bert, and guys, that was also about something!! ...and he definitely liked touching guys more than touching girls even when taking photos with fans , he wouldn't grab a girl around her waist, but he'd grab a guy around his lower back (almost ass) he also used to stand closer to the guys than girls he was taking pics with.\n\nSo that's 'The Early Years' of Frank and gerard although it's not very frerard related\n\nI hope you enjoyed this theory, likes and comments would really be appreciated and thank you for reading!"
