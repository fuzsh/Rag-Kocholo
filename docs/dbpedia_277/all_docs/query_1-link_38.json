        "text": "Pencey Prep's song 'Cotton Candy' delves into the complex emotions of longing and unrequited love. The lyrics paint a picture of someone who waits around, perhaps hoping for a connection that never fully materializes. The line 'I wait around until you leave' suggests a sense of resignation and patience, while 'You're lucky that I'm so naive' hints at a self-awareness of their own vulnerability. This juxtaposition of hope and naivety sets the tone for the rest of the song.\n\nThe recurring phrase 'Cot-ton can-dy, alright' serves as a metaphor for something sweet yet insubstantial, much like the fleeting moments of affection the narrator experiences. The imagery of 'Her lips move slowly to the right' evokes a sense of slow, deliberate movement, perhaps indicating a moment of intimacy that is savored but ultimately transient. This metaphor underscores the ephemeral nature of the relationship, much like cotton candy that dissolves quickly.\n\nThe song also touches on the theme of communication, or the lack thereof. Lines like 'Say you'll communicate, but close the door before you leave' and 'Write me a letter, sing me a song' highlight the narrator's desire for meaningful interaction. However, the repeated refrain 'Fifty-million sayers can't be wrong' suggests a sense of disillusionment, as if the narrator is questioning the sincerity of words and promises. The song concludes with a poignant reflection on missed opportunities and lingering affection, encapsulated in the lines 'Every time I see you, oh lady, I miss you' and 'Did you ever think I'd miss you?' This final sentiment leaves the listener with a sense of unresolved longing and bittersweet nostalgia."
