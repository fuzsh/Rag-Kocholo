        "text": "note: this article, with more content, was previously published on April 11th, 2015 via Sonic Dispersal’s Issuu page. You can view the rest of the issue here\n\nEnthralled and thrashing, Frank Iero lashes himself into a funnel of energy and spit across stage. He continuously strums amid the gravitation of a hundred hands towards him at once; so rapidly that the eye cannot focus, yet he never misses a beat. Anyone who experiences this knows that this is his purpose and exactly where he should be.\n\nThat is the first impression most will get from him; the madness stemmed from whatever kind of performance he’s a part of. The stage right subtly of broken toes and bloody fingers of the MCR era; the front-man mania wringing out of Leathermouth’s white attire and heavy sound; the youth induced praxis of Pencey Prep circa 2001. It all wraps up together, like a rubber band containing all the works he’s done, to reveal the now. Under the name Frnk Iero andthe Cellabration.\n\nIero emits a drive deriving from what seems to be a hereditary knack for musicianship, that he carries on to this day, and the folklore of his musical past. The strains of drive thru job nightmares to compensate for New Jersey tours still reaches the core of his heart. He still holds true to finding a way to do what he loves. “If you’re a creative person and you dedicate your life to it, that doesn’t always matter. You just do it ‘cause you have to do it,” he said. “You don’t do it because you think you’re going to succeed. If you’re doing this to get rich, it’s not happening. You’re gonna be very disappointed.” For someone who had been in the fluorescent lights of national music reporting and immersed in record label complexity for over a decade to exclaim that, gesturing all of the genuine sweat that pores could ever exude, makes the choice to interview him a no-brainer.\n\nIero’s work coalesces a fan base of dedicated lunacy, all together for their own personal convictions that somehow found resonance in what was My Chemical Romance’s sound. It paved a path that sprawled in figurative cement that you are not alone regardless of the severity, what you strive for in this life is valid and to get to it with all that you’ve got. He certainly reflects that in his own ethics; it is a prominent element in everything he does.\n\nIt was an honor to sit down with Frank to talk about music and how it twines people together in our ephemeral forever’s, both as the listener and the creator.\n\nOn Touring in Florida:\n\n“It’s weird, because you’ll have shows where there’s no in between. You’ll have these quintessential Gainesville shows where people are just fuckin’ off the wall nuts, and super excited and crazed, but you’ll also have the shows where it almost felt like aliens had come and taken a group of people and dropped them at a show and they have no idea why they’re there or what to do, but they’re just trying to get through it.”\n\nOn the Spelling of “Cellabration”:\n\n“I always loved when people, you know, called the band Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, or Joan Jett and the Black Hearts. I wanted to do that and I wanted to name it something that was non-genre specific.”\n\n“So I thought about it a little bit and the definition of the word “celebration” was a little bit funny, because it was everything I didn’t think I could be as a front-man. I figured if I brought that with me it could kind of fill in the blanks for how awkward and anti-social I feel sometimes.”\n\n“I like the fact that if I change the front to “Cell” it was like the building blocks of life. I like to inject that into it. And then when I did that I just thought there were too many E’s, so I changed that around and then everybody got mad and couldn’t spell it.And now it’s just funny. But next record, I don’t know. I might spell it differently.”\n\nOn the Song Writing Process:\n\n“I feel like different songs come from different places. For me, I found that life experience is the number one inspiration. I feel like it can come from anywhere. I like to try to be aware and present in the moment because you never know what you’re gonna miss.”\n\n“Sometimes it could be a color, it could be a texture, and it could be an experience that you went through, something that you saw somebody else go through, and I do find that it’s immediate. If you hold onto it for too long and then try to lay it down later there’s a weird disconnect on it and it doesn’t feel right. If you have it at that moment you need to somehow get it down.”\n\n“You try your best to capture that moment. I like to express myself in different mediums but it just for some reason music was one of those things that I think I was kind of born into.”\n\nHow it would feel to not grow up with musical influences:\n\n“I don’t know what that would be like, to not have it. I thought about it- I really enjoy writing and I enjoy doing other creative things but music’s always been there. I can’t even imagine what that family would be like.”\n\n“As a kid hanging out at the dinner table on the weekends when I’d go to my father’s, they always had these huge datebooks. I have one my bag in the bus, and it really doesn’t come that handy anymore, but back then it was like these huge billfolds and they would have these rubber bands wrapped around it. And if they wanted to make plans they’d have to look through it and be like, ‘Oh, I’m playing here on this day you know,\n\nwhen are you free?’ and it was such an experience, having these dates. And it wasn’t just about planning out it was like- these were memories, these were experiences, these were places that they were playing. They were playing to people and making them dance and like making them feel something, you know? It was such an experience with such a crazy world, the smoky, smelly world that they were in and it overtook a lot of their time. I just always wanted that and now that I have that I just wanna go home.”\n\nOn his influences while recording Stomachaches:\n\n“For this record, I definitely went back to things I listened to as a kid that my dad had played me […] I wanted to capture a moment in time. I didn’t wanna go back and mess with anything too much. I liked the old recordings, like Muddy Waters or Robert Johnson. There was just one mic in a room. You’d play it 100 times but you’d pick the best one, that was one take, and that was it. I liked that human element. I feel like that’s desperately missed in a lot of music today. I think there’s a lot of bands that still have that, and have that spirit about them, and I love that. Some of my favorite things about music, that I love, are things that are maybe considered mistakes. And that’s cool.”\n\nOn recording solo:\n\n“I feel like it’s lonely, but not in a bad way. What I miss about it is that excitement of not showing off, but getting other people psyched on things; getting that immediate reaction from someone […] I think it also flexes this muscle of self-editing, which is important. I feel like as a young songwriter every song was a kitchen sink. Like if I wrote a part, it had to be in a song. That’s a tough thing to master. Not everything you do is great, and not everything you do has to be in the song, and if you can get your point across in ‘this’ amount of time then that’s what you should probably do […] it’s not about you, it’s what’s best for the song and once you figure that out it’s a little bit easier to trim the fat. And so I tried to do that a lot.”\n\nYou can purchase Stomachaches at Frank-iero.com, Kings Road Merch or Itunes and find Frnk Iero andthe Cellabration on tour throughout the U.K, Europe and Russia from April through May.\n\nInterview/words by Gabby Strang\n\nPhotos by Kristina Luberto"
