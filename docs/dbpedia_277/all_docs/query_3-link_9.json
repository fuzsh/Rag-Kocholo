Iero is the vocalist of Death Spells and Leathermouth and is currently focusing on his current project frnkiero andthe cellabration. He also owns a music label/publishing company called B.CALM Press.\n\nIero grew up in Belleville, New Jersey. He grew up with his mom, Linda, who divorced his dad (a great influence to him over the years). He went to Rutgers University on a scholarship, but dropped out to join My Chemical Romance. He has played in various bands since he was eleven years old. In addition to his band Pencey Prep, Frank also played with the bands Hybrid, Sector 12, I Am a Graveyard, and briefly with Give Up the Ghost.\n\nIero uses an Epiphone Elitist Les Paul Custom guitar with an Antique White finish. One of his many guitars sports the name Pansy which appeared in the 2006 My Chemical Romance calendar and is also a nickname of his, although recently, Pansy was broken by an MTV guitar tech. Iero has named many of his guitars; some of these names include “Bella”, “Texas”, “Sinatra”, “Pansy”, “Angel”, “New” and “Jersey”. He has been seen playing Angel on several TV appearances and the guitar makes a cameo on Life on the Murder Scene. He admires Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day, and learned to play the guitar by imitating him."
