        "text": "Listening to this sci-fi classic is a must to be able to enjoy all aspects of the story. Published in 1953 and winner of the first Hugo Award, the title is now an intriguing and compelling listen. Motivated by professional rivalry, Ben Reich decides to murder his opponent in a world where Espers, or telepaths, are common. But because of them, there has not been a successful murder in 70 years. He will count on the help of a first-class Esper to create \"interferences\" and will be singing a catchy tune to himself to prevent Espers from reading his mind. Gerard Doyle's singing is one of the details that makes the audiobook special. The listener will not be able to forget this tune! E.D. Â© AudioFile 2019, Portland, Maine [Published: MARCH 2019]"
