        "text": "Wednesday, December 4, 2019 - 1:08 PM CST\n\nName: \"Harry Georgatos\"\n\nI first read THE DEMOLISHED MAN in 1978 part of my High school certificate. That year I also watched Brian DePalma's THE FURY. My first thought was Brian DePalma would be perfect for THE DEMOLISHED MAN movie only to learn that DePalma was attached to direct the movie after THE FURY but fell apart. There was even a draft of the novel from Oliver Stone. DePalma and THE DEMOLISHED MAN is a helluva missed opportunity.\n\nWednesday, December 4, 2019 - 2:02 PM CST\n\nName: \"Phil\"\n\nDePalma's filmmography have always had psychiatrists in a lot of his films.\n\nThere's Sisters, Obsession had a psychiatrist, The Fury had paranormal psychiatrists, then there is Dressed To Kill, Raising Cain and De Palma's unproduced Ambrose Chapel has psychiatrists dealing in M-KULTRA.\n\nThe Demolished Man deals with psychic psychiatrists and would have fitted well in De Palma's filmmography.\n\nWednesday, December 4, 2019 - 4:28 PM CST\n\nName: \"insider\"\n\nI don't trust anything written by David Koepp. De Palma should have persisted with Demolished Man then Snake Eyes. At the end of the road was Spielberg's masterful Minority Report, still Demolished Man was a major lost moment for De Palma. If the movie got made maybe De Palma would still be making studio films then ending up with shady European financial swindlers that were behind De Palma's severely compromised Domino, which had the hallmarks of something special."
