It was the first Hugo Award winner in 1953. Uncommon in such a nice example of the rather cool dust-jacket, very different from the more austere first US edition.",

Publisher's white cloth. Dust-jacket, correctly priced at 7/6 on front flap, overprinted with 4/6.\n\nThe first novel by the writer described by Ronald Bryden as \"the most exasperatingly gifted writer in England\". Hyams was a translator and author, active in various genres, fiction and non-fiction, from before World War Two. Although not widely known for his speculative work, he published several novels of Sci-Fi interest. The Wings of the Morning is a discussion novel in the style of the scientific romance set as a future war novel whose description does not very accurately anticipate the reality to come. This was his first novel written when he was 28 years old. Rare. No copies of any kind for sale at time of listing.\n\nSci-Fi & Fantasy\n\nJackson (G. Gibbard) Arctic Air Terror.\n\n£165\n\nLondon, Sampson Low, Marston, [1937].\n\nFirst edition. 8vo. Original cloth. Dust-jacket.\n\nThe only work of sci-fi from an author normally associated with more sedentary works on transport; this Lost Race tale set in the Yukon Territory, 'within a caldera heated by volcanic action, a technologically advanced but priest-ridden civilization of \"white Indians\", originally from ancient Egypt, uses its helicopter-like airships and strange Weapons to attempt to protect its gold from the outer world.' (The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction)."
