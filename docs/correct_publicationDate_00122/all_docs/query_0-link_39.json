        "text": "Publisher Description\n\nIn a world policed by telepaths, Ben Reich plans to commit a crime that hasn't been heard of in seventy years: murder. That's the only option left for Reich, whose company is losing a ten-year death struggle with rival D'Courtney Enterprises. Terrorized in his dreams by The Man With No Face and driven to the edge after D'Courtney refuses a merger offer, Reich murders his rival and bribes a high-ranking telepath to help him cover his tracks. But while police prefect Lincoln Powell knows Reich is guilty, his telepath's knowledge is a far cry from admissible evidence.\n\nDownload and start listening now!\n\nBester's two superb books have stood the test of time. For nearly sixty years they've held their place on everybody's list of the ten greatest sf novels\n\n— Robert Silverberg, author\n\nAbout Alfred Bester\n\nAlfred Bester (1913–1987) was an author whose passionate novels of worldly adventure, high intellect, and tremendous verve, The Stars My Destination and the Hugo Award-winning The Demolished Man, established him as a science fiction grandmaster, a reputation that was ratified by the Science Fiction Writers of America shortly before his death in 1987. He also was an acclaimed journalist for Holiday magazine, a reviewer for the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, and even a writer for Superman.\n\nAbout Gerard Doyle\n\nGerard Doyle, a seasoned audio narrator, he has been awarded dozens of AudioFile Earphones Awards, was named a Best Voice in Young Adult Fiction in 2008, and won the prestigious Audie Award for best narration. He was born of Irish parents and raised and educated in England. In Great Britain he has enjoyed an extensive career in both television and repertory theater and toured nationally and internationally with the English Shakespeare Company. He has appeared in London’s West End in the gritty musical The Hired Man. In America he has appeared on Broadway in The Weir and on television in New York Undercover and Law & Order. He has taught drama at Ross School for the several years."
