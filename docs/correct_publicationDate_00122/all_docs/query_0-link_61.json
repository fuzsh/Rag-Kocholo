        "text": "London, Sidgwick & Jackson, 1953.\n\nFirst UK edition. 8vo. Original red boards, dust-jacket, priced 9s 6d and with publisherâ€™s printed overlay to foot of front inside flap.\n\nThe Demolished Man was the first novel by Alfred Bester, who up until its publication had been best known for his Sci-Fi short stories. It was the first Hugo Award winner in 1953. Uncommon in such a nice example of the rather cool dust-jacket, very different from the more austere first US edition."
