        "text": "I’ve written of Alfred Bester before. Reading the\n\nAmazon.com reviews of The Stars My Destination, I’m surprised to read he\n\nactually wrote the Green Lantern Oath. I’ve only ever known Bester as a science\n\nfiction novelist. He built his reputation on two novels: The Stars My\n\nDestination, and The Demolished Man, both published in the\n\n50s.\n\nThe Demolished Man might be Ben\n\nReich, if the peepers (telepaths) manage to pin the murder of D’Courtney, his\n\nbusiness rival, on him. D’Courtney’s daughter, Barbara, the only witness to the\n\nmurder, has been reduced to catatonic grief and must be regressed to infancy.\n\nReich is haunted by two main characters: Lincoln Powell, bigtime peeper, and The\n\nMan with No Face. It’s part detective novel, part musing on corporate greed,\n\npart existential optimism – all of which begin with a game of sardines.\n\nThere are times, when I reread The\n\nDemolished Man, that I smile at the invented language. It is a risk many science\n\nfiction authors run, that the language they use to speculate on science will\n\nlook poorly informed 10 years later. Still, I grew up on the classics, and great\n\nworld-building trumps neologistic mishaps.\n\nStanislaw Lem’s The\n\nCyberiad (Fables for a Cybernetic Age) is more than neologistic play,\n\nalthough when I first read it as a 14-year old, much of the math was beyond me,\n\nand it was the wordplay I loved. It made me laugh a lot, the kind of laughter\n\nthat makes people try very hard not to look at you in the bus. Lem took obscure\n\n(well, to me, anyway) higher math theory and made two constructor robots, Trurl\n\nand Klaupaucius, have a lot of fun with them. The stories are structured like\n\nfables, with a wonderful feeling of once upon a time in the far, far future.\n\nThe crown of “SF’s angry young man” in\n\nthe 70s belonged to Samuel R. Delany, a man who took his wordplay seriously.\n\nMuch of his work revolves around linguistics, semiotics, gaps in understanding.\n\nMy favorite novel of his was written in 1966. In Babel-17, the Alliance hires Rydra Wong,\n\ncryptographer and poet, to figure out what they think is bursts of code that\n\naccompany acts of sabotage on Alliance planets, which they fear heralds a total\n\ninvasion. Rydra is a very cool chick. (She fights! She cracks code! She writes\n\npoetry!) There weren’t too many heroines in the 60s who weren’t trophy\n\ngirlfriends for space pilots.\n\nThis old\n\n“Rules of Science Fiction” essay, about what\n\nmakes an SF film cool, uncool, franchise or cheap, also works for SF novels.\n\n(I’ve quoted the heroine part here, but the entire essay is a treat. Do read\n\nit.)\n\nTHE\n\nHEROINE:\n\nHEROINES in\n\nCOOL films\n\ncome in two varieties: sultry lounge singers or tough-as-nails chyks. The former\n\nfall in with the police (who are secretly agents of evil) and get the hero\n\ntrapped, then realize what they have done and make feeble attempts to rescue\n\nhim. Tough-as-nails HEROINES spend the first third of the movie kicking the\n\nincompetent hero’s ass and telling him to shut up when he asks dumb questions,\n\nbut by the end of the flick they have fallen for his well-hidden charms and look\n\nready to raise a brood of black-haired baby brooders with\n\nhim.\n\nHEROINES in\n\nUNCOOL\n\nmovies sleep with the hero. And scream. The FALSE HEROINE (i.e. the one who puts\n\nthe moves on the hero, rather than waiting for him to seduce her) often dies,\n\nbloodily. The real HEROINE survives the boinking because her love for the hero\n\nis true, and because they have matching shades of blonde hair. In many cases,\n\nthe HEROINE has some connection to the bad guy – daughter, wife, former lover,\n\nlust object, pizza delivery girl – and thus the triumphant boinking is a\n\nnecessary plot device.\n\nHEROINES in\n\nFRANCHISE\n\nfilms try to kick ass a lot, when the scriptwriter isn’t looking. They are\n\nallowed one racy comment per film, though they may be asked to wear revealing\n\n(or, in the case of Star Trek VI, no) costumes. They are allowed to save the\n\nhero’s bacon precisely once per film with a well-placed blaster shot right as\n\nhe’s about to buy it, but otherwise they generally hang in the background. There\n\nis no jiggling allowed in FRANCHISE\n\nfilms."
