        "text": "Dear MPP Singh,\n\nDid you know there is $12-million of disrepair in the publicly funded schools in your riding of Brampton East? We wanted to share the following details of disrepair in each school in your riding in the hope that this detailed information would underscore the importance of developing standards of good repair for Ontario schools and also the importance of providing the adequate, stable provincial funding to school boards required for them to meet those new standards and eliminate the $16.3-billion repair backlog (as of November 2019) that plagues Ontario’s schools:\n\nTotal disrepair in each publicly funded school in Brampton East:\n\nCardinal Ambrozic Catholic Secondary School $ 185,000 Father Clair Tipping $ 863,928 Father Francis McSpiritt $ 380,000 Holy Spirit $ 560,000 St. Isaac Jogues $ 726,024 St. Patrick Sep S $ 2,866,678 Calderstone M.S. $ 298,676 Castlemore PS $ 193,570 Claireville P.S. $ 313,482 Eagle Plains P.S. $ 224,978 Hewson P.S. $ 321,291 Mount Royal PS $ 100,199 Mountain Ash P.S. $ 125,671 Red Willow PS $ 290,795 Robert J Lee PS $ 3,018,126 Sandalwood Heights S.S. $ 572,200 Shaw P.S. $ 76,352 Stanley Mills PS $ 168,440 Sunny View M.S. $ 189,163 Thorndale P.S. $ 124,265 Treeline P.S. $ 485,547\n\nSchool conditions matter. They impact student learning, attendance, and health.\n\nWe ask that you and your government please prioritize schools as critical infrastructure and take the steps necessary to ensure that the disrepair in all of Ontario’s publicly funded schools is eliminated and that schools are safe, healthy, well-maintained buildings that provide environments conducive to learning and working. We look forward to hearing back from you with details on your plan to Fix Ontario’s Schools."
