Students will use ability appropriate language skills in listening, speaking, reading, and writing for everyday and essential academic purposes. They will learn English language structures and simple sentence patterns to use in conversations, to read short adapted texts, and to write phrases, short sentences and paragraphs. They will also acquire knowledge and skills needed to adapt to Canadian life.\n\nPROGRAM OVERVIEW\n\nREGISTRATION FORM\n\nFor more information about the International Student Summer Program, please contact Rita Borg, Principal of the International Education Program at 905-412-3341 ext. 31460 or rita.borg@dpcdsb.org\n\n↧\n\nHome\n\n↧\n\nBlack History Month\n\nBlack History Month - February 2016\n\nEvents:\n\nFebruary 18 - Black History Student Conference 2016: It’s Everyone’s History - Opening Doors\n\nThis year’s theme is “It’s Everyone’s History - Opening Doors”.

Knowledge of a second language is valuable for a number of reasons. Through learning a second language, learners can strengthen their first-language skills and enhance their critical and creative thinking abilities; they also tend to become more tolerant and respectful of other cultures.\n\nIn addition, the ability to communicate in another language provides learners with a distinct advantage in a number of careers, both in Canada and internationally.\n\nThis course is to provide learners with fundamental communication skills in French and an understanding of the nature of the language and its culture. It offers learners the chance to develop a usable command of the French language that can be expanded through further study or through contact with French-speaking people.\n\nMonday & Wednesday\n\n6:00 pm - 9:30 pm\n\nFebruary 10 - May 25, 2016\n\nLocation: St. Aloysius Gonzaga S.S.\n\n2800 Erin Centre Blvd, Mississauga\n\nMaterial Fee: $30\n\nFor more information and to register, call 905-891-3034.\n\nAttention: These classes are for adults only.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nSecondary Library e-Resources -- Subject Specific\n\nBrowse by Subject:\n\nSubject\n\nBusinessHospitality & TourismCareersLaw & JusticeCulinary ArtsLiteratureEnvironment & GeographyMedia & TechnologyGardening & HorticultureReligion & PhilosophyGovernmentScienceHealthWar & MilitaryHistoryVideos\n\nBrowse Full List: Please click on the name of an e-Resource to connect to it online.\n\nBusiness\n\nNameDescriptionGeneral Business File ASAPAnalyze company performance and activity, industry events and trends as well as the latest in management, economics and politics.

Conceived as a comprehensive two-year curriculum that allows its graduates to fulfill requirements of various national education systems, the diploma model is based on the pattern of no single country, but incorporates the best elements of several.\n\nThe IB diploma candidates are required to select one subject from each of six subject groups.\n\nGroup 1: Studies in Language and Literature\n\nLanguage A: Literature; Language A: Language and Literature, and Language A: Literature and Performance (an interdisciplinary subject).\n\nGroup 2: Language Acquisition\n\nLanguage ab initio courses are for beginners (that is, students who have little or no previous experience of learning the language they have chosen). These courses are only available at standard level.\n\nLanguage B courses are intended for students who have had some previous experience of learning the language. They may be studied at either higher level or standard level.\n\nLatin or Classical Greek coursework provides opportunities for students to study the language, literature and culture of ancient Rome or Greece.\n\nGroup 3: Individuals and Societies\n\nBusiness and Management, Economics, Geography, History, Information Technology in a Global Society, Philosophy, Psychology, Social and Cultural Anthropology, Global Politics, World Religions.\n\nGroup 4: Sciences\n\nBiology, Chemistry, Physics, Computer Science, Design Technology, Environmental Systems, Sports, Exercise and Health Science, and Societies (this course meets the group 3 and group 4 requirements).\n\nAll of these subjects can be studied at the Higher or Standard Level.\n\nGroup 5: Mathematics\n\nStudents must study at least one course in Mathematics.\n\nMathematics courses include: Mathematical Studies at Standard Level, Mathematics at Standard Level, Mathematics at Higher Level, and Further Mathematics at Higher Level.\n\nGroup 6: The Arts\n\nDance, Film, Music, Theatre, Visual Arts: These subjects may be studied at Higher Level or Standard Level.\n\nNOTE: Students are required to choose one subject from each of the six academic areas, including one from Group 6 although instead of a group 6 subject they can choose a second from Groups 1 – 5.\n\nThe programme offers special features in addition to the strengths of a liberal arts curriculum.\n\nTheory of Knowledge (TOK) is a required interdisciplinary course intended to stimulate critical reflection upon the knowledge and experience gained inside and outside the classroom. Theory of Knowledge seeks to develop a coherent approach to learning which transcends and unifies the academic subjects and encourages appreciation of other cultural perspectives.\n\nCreativity, Action, Service (CAS) is a fundamental part of the diploma curriculum. The goal of educating the whole and fostering a more compassionate citizenry comes alive in an embedded way when students reach beyond themselves and their books.\n\nDiploma candidates are required to undertake original research and create an Extended Essay of some 4,000 words. This project offers the opportunity to investigate a topic of special interest and acquaints students with the kind of independent research and writing skills expected at university.\n\nThe grading system used by the International Baccalaureate Organization is criterion referenced. This means that each student’s performance is measured against well-defined levels of achievement consistent from one examination session to the next. Top grades are not simply awarded \"on a curve\" to a certain percentage of candidates, but rather reflect attainment of knowledge and skills relative to set standards equally applied to all schools. Validity, reliability and fairness are the watchwords of the IBO's international examining board.\n\nMore Information: IB Diploma Programme Curriculum\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nParent Reaching Out Events\n\n\"Preparing your Child with Differing Abilities for the Sacraments of First Reconciliation, First Holy Communion and Confirmation\"\n\nThursday, January 29, 2015\n\n6:00 p.m. – 8:00 p.m.\n\nCatholic Education Centre, Room 301\n\nMore Information: Event Brochure\n\n↧\n\nResources\n\nFEBRUARY IS PSYCHOLOGY MONTH\n\nHow to talk to children about traumatic events\n\nPSYCH 5 TO THRIVE facts sheets:\n\nMaking the Most of Parent-Teacher Interviews: A Parent’s Guide\n\nRaising Confident and Resilient Children\n\nHealthy Sleep, Healthy Child\n\nTalking to Teens About Stress\n\nSteps to Exam Success\n\nOther Resources:\n\nAnxiety and Anxiety Disorders in Children: Information for Parents (article by NASP)\n\nParent Guide - Psychological Assessment: FAQs\n\nPsychology Services: Making a Difference for Learning and Behaviour\n\nYour Guide to the Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA)\n\nArchives:\n\n2014\n\nPsychology Services & Catholic Board Learning Plan\n\nTier 1 - Universal Services for All\n\nTier 2 - Target or Selected Intervention\n\nTier 3 - Intensive Intervention\n\n2013\n\nStress and Worries Too Much of a Good Thing.pdf\n\nIs It More Than Just the Winter Blahs.pdf\n\nYour Child in Full Day Kindergarten.pdf\n\nStrategies for Dealing with Challenging Behaviours\n\n2012\n\nBoosting Your Memory\n\nEffective Strategies for Your Own Learning\n\nMedia Dangers, Part One: Cyberbullying\n\nMedia Dangers, Part Two: Violent Video Games\n\nProcrastination and Motivation: The Game of \"Get Started\"\n\nSleep Habits: Essential for Health and Wellbeing\n\nStress Management and Relaxation\n\n2011\n\nStudent Anxiety & Role of Psychology School Mental Health Initiative\n\nProject Memory: Making It Work!\n\n2010\n\nViolence, Youth & Gangs\n\nTips for Parents: What Parents Can Do To Help Their Children In School\n\n2009\n\nHelping Children Cope in Unsettling Times\n\nImportance of Play\n\n2008\n\nTips for Teachers and Parents: Stress In Students\n\nHow to Make and Keep Resolutions\n\nResponse to Intervention\n\nBehaviour Management in the Classroom\n\n2007\n\nExecutive Functions: Getting Organized for Success\n\nThe Psychology of Reading: From Research to Practice in the Classroom\n\nDefiant & Emotionally Unpredictable Students\n\nCyber Bullying\n\nADHD\n\nEating Disorders - Prevention is Worth Every Ounce\n\nHelping Withdrawn or Sad Students\n\nName Calling\n\nPreventing School Dropouts\n\nRetention\n\nSelf Esteem\n\nThe ABCs of Children's Mental Health\n\n↧\n\nNight School\n\nThe Dufferin-Peel Catholic District School Board offers evening credit courses under the Ontario Secondary School curriculum guidelines.

In this role she sat on provincial education committees and worked with both national and provincial boards. She was also responsible for curriculum development for national Junior Achievement programs that became part of curricula in many school boards across Canada.\n\nAfter leaving this full-time position, Sharon ran a special event planning business and served as a curriculum consultant and writer for Junior Achievement.\n\nSharon is a dedicated supporter of Catholic education and has participated as a parent volunteer on several school councils and committees over twenty years. She has also served as chair of the Central Committee for Catholic School Councils.
