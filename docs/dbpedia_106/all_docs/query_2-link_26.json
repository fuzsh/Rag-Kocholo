        "text": "Dear Peel District School Board Families:\n\nWe are now in week two of the 2021-22 school year -- and while it was a busy reopening as we adjust to new health and safety requirements, seeing all the smiling faces of students and re-experiencing the sense of community after an extended time apart has been truly fulfilling. We’ve missed you!\n\nAlthough it isn’t a normal return to school, we still have reasons to celebrate our Peel education school system -- a place where your children learn, grow and succeed with the guidance of exceptional educators and support staff. Our 259 schools are rich and alive in diversity and our priority for high quality learning, culturally relevant programming, including the health, safety and well-being of students remains at the forefront this new school year.\n\nAs you ease into the flow of this new 2021-22 school year, we want to let you know that we are committed to keeping our families informed and sharing updates as they are available to us. Please continue to check for our alerts and updates and contact your child’s school for information if you have any questions.\n\nFall 2021 school-based COVID-19 vaccination clinics\n\nIn partnership with the four school Boards serving Peel Region and Peel Public Health, the following COVID-19 vaccination school clinics will be available throughout the Fall to provide many accessible options for eligible students, parents, school staff, Peel residents and community members to get vaccinated.\n\nBelow is a list of school-based COVID-19 vaccination clinic locations as well and their availability.\n\nAll school-based clinics are open to walk-ins or you can book an appointment online.\n\nSecondary Modified Semester Calendar\n\nThis 2021-22 school year, secondary students are engaged in a Community Learning Model, which allows students who are online to learn alongside their peers who are attending class in-person. From September 2021 to January 2022, secondary schools will follow a Modified Semester Model, where students will take a total of four courses over 20 weeks (one semester). The modified semester calendar is available on all secondary school websites.\n\nPDSB appreciates your ongoing patience as we work to ensure a safe 2021-22 school year.\n\nElection Polls at two PDSB Secondary Schools\n\nElections Canada has approved two PDSB secondary schools -- Stephen Lewis Secondary School and John Fraser Secondary School -- for use as polling stations on Monday, September 20,2021. To reduce the number of people onsite at each school and to help keep students and staff safe, all classes at these two secondary schools will be moved to online learning, within the Community Learning Model, for the entire school day on Monday, September 20, 2021.\n\nIf your child(ren) attends Stephen Lewis Secondary School or John Fraser Secondary School, please DO NOT send them to school on Monday, September 20, 2021, as all classes will be online for the entire school day."
