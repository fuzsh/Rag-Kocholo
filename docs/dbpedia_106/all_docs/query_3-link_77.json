        "text": "Brampton and Caledon Catholic High School Rankings:\n\nBrampton’s Best Catholic High Schools 2024\n\nLast updated on by\n\nThe best Catholic high schools in Brampton and Caledon can be challenging to gauge. The way many parents do it is by planning to attend high schools that have very-good-to-excellent pass-rates on the EQAO test scores the Ontario government publishes every year for all publicly-funded schools in the province. Others simply rely on the SUSI Rankings to at least get a decent sense of what the best Catholic high schools in Brampton and Caledon might be.\n\nRELATED: For Brampton and Caledon Public High School Rankings, go here.)\n\nHowever, as Real Estate professionals who have a specialty in schools, we strongly feel that there is a problem with making a determination about the “best” Catholic high schools in Brampton and Caledon based solely on EQAO pass-rates. These test scores only emanate from Grade 9 and Grade 10 students… some who have attended the high school for only half a year! We wonder: How can you make a correct overall assessment of a high school based on these results alone?? The answer is: You cannot, and you really should not.\n\nWhat could be just as a determining of a factor are the programs or clubs offered by each secondary school. Programs & clubs have been seen to work very well in a secondary school to keep teenagers both focused and out of trouble, and we strongly recommend that these factors be considered.\n\nHowever, what the EQAO pass-rates are likely telling us is what the level of education of the incoming student population is generally, and that has been a worthwhile concern for my clients, as well.\n\nBrampton and Caledon Catholic High School rankings have traditionally been “determined” by the Fraser Institute, but since their default rankings are only for the previous year, they can often be slightly misleading to concerned parents who seek consistency from a school. After all, if they are moving into a certain school district, more often than not they will be staying there for the duration of the child’s grade-school education.\n\nThis is part of the reason why we created the SUSI Rankings, which for Catholic high schools in Brampton involves heavy research into a school’s consistency in EQAO pass-rates over the years.\n\nKeeping those thoughts in mind, here are the 2024 Brampton and Caledon Catholic High School Rankings, as determined by our research:\n\nTHE BEST CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOLS IN BRAMPTON/CALEDON 2024\n\nThese are the top 5 Catholic high schools in the Brampton and Caledon area, and our ranking formula has determined this particular order. However, please note that every high school will have its deficiencies and faults, just as every one of them will have glories and inspirations.\n\nOn our website, we have school rankings for:\n\nMississauga and Brampton\n\nOakville, Burlington, Milton, Georgetown and Hamilton\n\nEtobicoke and the West End/High Park area\n\nVaughan, Markham, and Richmond Hill\n\nSearching for Real Estate in Brampton Catholic High School Districts\n\nIf you’re looking to purchase a home in a great Catholic high school district, don’t trust your search to any other Realtor out there. We here at SusiHomes always have the latest school boundaries and the latest school district demographics to help in your search. Plus you get immediate alerts in your email on any new homes in your preferred school districts, using only YOUR parameters to weed out the ones that you might not be able to afford, or don’t like because there aren’t enough bedrooms or perhaps even too many pools (ONE is too many for some!).\n\nContact us NOW to get your most-informed search started!"
