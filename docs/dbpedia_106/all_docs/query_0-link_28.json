According to the U of T Alumni Office, St. Mike’s is the most active and successful alumni group in the President, university. That’s a great feather in our cap, but a hard University of St. Michael’s College Alumni Association reputation to keep up. To combat this, we’ve been recruiting alumni who are experts in key areas such as special events, Web site production, marketing and fundraising. These alumni don’t have the responsibility of sitting directly on the board, but are providing their time and expertise on specific committees or organizing groups. They can come in for a special project and leave when it’s completed, knowing they’ve accomplished something – they’ve helped us reach a goal. New President continued Although they had met briefly in high school, the Birgeneaus discovered each other again at a dance held for Frosh at St. Michael’s during Orientation Week. The rest is history. They met daily at the Coop, then in Carr Hall, and enjoyed the wonderful social atmosphere of the St. Michael’s community. Both remembered faculty from this period. Mary Catherine reminisced about the kindness of the Registrar, Rev. Hugh Mallon, CSB. She recalled Rev. Dick Donovan, CSB opening his French classes with a joke from the French edition of the Reader’s Digest. She studied English with Marshall McLuhan, who told the class that anyone who understood media could become famous and that he himself might someday be renowned. Bob remembered thought-provoking instructions in Religious Knowledge, better known as RK, with Father David Belyea, CSB and Gregory Baum.

Jean Vanier Jean Vanier: Loving Builder of Arks In January 1964, a philosophy class gathered in a Teefy Hall classroom to meet their new ethics professor. Nobody knew him, though the name was familiar - Vanier. The Canadian Governor- General of the day was Georges Vanier. A tall, angular man bustled into the room clutching a stack of books. In the days that followed, the class learned that Jean Vanier was, indeed, the son of the Governor-General. But his background was less important than his presence. He had a way of being with people, of listening with his eyes as well as his ears. Biographical notes about Jean often mention that he was a university professor, but not always that his only university teaching was the one semester at St. Mike’s. I was in that ethics class. Looking back, I know that Vanier was one of my best teachers ever. When he spoke, you felt his passion and conviction. But more importantly, when he invited his students to speak, as he often did, he would not accept superficial comments but would gently question and encourage a deeper response. What I could not be aware of then was the degree to which this man and his work would affect the course of my life. Vanier’s sojourn at SMC was a prelude to another project towards which his heart was drawn. He left Toronto for France at the end of the spring semester. In the village of Trosly, by the Forest of Compiègne, he bought a small house, and invited three men to live with him. These men had developmental handicaps and had long been institutionalized. Together they began fixing the house and working the garden. Jean named the house “L’Arche”. The word means “The Ark”, as in Noah’s Ark - a place of refuge in difficult times, but also a means of pilgrimage towards a new life. As L’Arche gradually grew, the call went out for help. In 1966, I My year in Trosly led eventually to fifteen more years living in went to Trosly, planning to stay only a few months, but remained for L’Arche with my family. My story parallels that of many men and a year. Then, as Vanier’s reputation grew, there was a groundswell of women, single and married, lay and religious, who have committed support. Hundreds of Canadians and people of other nationalities large portions of their lives to L’Arche. My family and I received so went to L’Arche in France, and many of these later contributed to much from the people of L’Arche, But L’Arche has also contributed a the growth of L’Arche as a world movement. L’Arche now numbers great deal to the field of human service and to the Church. Day by over a hundred communities around the globe: in Canada and the day, with simple actions, L’Arche communities demonstrate how love Americas, Eastern and Western Europe, Africa, the Middle East, can overcome fear. L’Arche and its founder are teaching the world Australia, India and the Western Pacific. that acceptance is more important than competition, reconciliation more important than domination, and community more important A L’Arche community may have one or many houses where people than efficiency. come together to live with and assist those who have developmental handicaps. It is a movement, Vanier would say, of “downward Jean has frequently spoken in Toronto, but it is joyful news that this mobility” - moving from the comfort and the self-sufficiency of our fall he will return to St. Michael’s. On 27 October, 2000, in the modern consumer age towards valuing and embracing those who afternoon, he will speak on the theology of L’Arche, exploring the have been marginalized and rejected as of little worth to society. It difference between doing the theology and living it. That evening, is, for Vanier, a response to the call of Jesus to reach out to “the he will give the annual Kelly Lecture, in which he will reflect on the least ones” among us. meaning of the new millennium. The Second Millennium was a time marked by much division and violence in the world. Can the Third Millennium be a time of reconciliation? Jean Vanier is recognized as a great Canadian not because of his privileged background but because he has chosen a life of love. In one of his many books, Images of Love, Words of Hope, he writes (pg 81): “We don’t have to do big things. We don’t have to be heroes. We are just called to be ourselves and to do little things of love.” by Brian Halferty ‘65 page 5\n\n6. DoubleBlue Alumni Profile Leo Knowlton While studying at St. Michael’s College, William Leo Know1ton developed a love for Philosophy that has never left him. This is obvious by his generous and unsolicited donation in the fall of 1999 to establish a permanently endowed lectureship in Philosophy and Theology. This permanent endowment will fund an annual course in Philosophy or Theology in the Christianity and Culture programme which was established in 1979 through a grant from the St. Michael’s Annual Fund and has become a flagship programme at St. Michael’s. In addition, the donation is such so as to allow the College to re- institute the Cardinal Mercier medal with a prize to be given annually to the student with the highest first-class honors in Fourth Year Philosophy. The medal and new prize will be known as the Mercier-Knowlton prize and will be a permanent recognition of Leo Knowlton’s firm belief in the importance of Philosophy in the curriculum. The Mercier prize had been awarded annually from 1924-1969; it recognized the work of Cardinal Mercier relative to the philosophy of St. Thomas Aquinas. Among the distinguished graduates who have won the medal are Leo Knowlton himself (1927) and our present President, Dr. Richard Alway (1962). This prize will be re- established for the school year 2000-2001. William Leo Knowlton, known as Leo, graduated from St. Michael’s College School with honors; thereafter he attended Saint Michael’s College at the UofT, where he obtained a BA. He subsequently studied law at Osgoode Hall. He was called to the Bar in 1930, practiced law until he joined the Canada Permanent Trust Company where his professional career centered on Wills, Trusts and Estates. He was granted his K.C. in 1948. He served with the Canada Permanent Trust Company for some 35 years and at the time of his retirement was the Executive Vice- President and General Manager. He was Vice- President of the Canada Permanent Mortgage Corporation, Chairman of the Board of Zurich Life Insurance Company, and director of many other corporate boards; he also served on Above: Leo Knowlton ‘27 the board of Princess Margaret Hospital, and was a member of Photo: Ashley and Crippen the advisory board of St. Michael’s Hospital. Mr. Knowlton has lived all his life in Toronto and has devoted that life to his professional career in a specialized field, but more importantly to his family, his daughters Mary (Mrs. Fran Matthews) and Adele (Mrs. Hugh O’Connell), his grandchildren and great grandchildren, all of whom have had and continue to have a deep affection for him. Those who know him professionally have recognized Leo’s integrity and business acumen; he has also been known for his loyal support for the University of Toronto and St. Michael’s College, Providence Villa and other charities. St. Michael’s thanks Leo Knowlton for this generous donation, and for his many previous contributions to the College. by Marie Daly Cook, ‘91 and Hugh O’Connell ‘55 page 6\n\n7. Alumni Profile James and Martin met in James’ first year at St. Mike’s. “Actually, we have Fred Flahiff to thank for that connection,” James laughs, “Kathleen and I became friends in his English class. We enjoyed the class so much that we ended up taking a number of his other courses together.” Master’s studies took James and Martin to Queen’s where they studied education and English respectively. Martin now teaches business communications at Acadia while James and the turtles continue to get acquainted. James’ immediate research area stretches from the Gulf of Maine to the Grand Banks, but technology has the potential to expand it significantly. “One of our most exciting opportunities was tagging a leatherback a couple of months ago with a satellite data recorder.” The recorder provided a wealth of information on the turtle’s (named Sherman) peregrinations. “Sherman was the first turtle that Kathleen ever saw, and it was the one and only time that she was in the field with us,” James recalls. Michael James Thus far, Sherman is the only leatherback that the team has tagged with a satellite-tracking device, but information from tagging the Mike James ‘96, son of the Hon.

One of the project sponsors is Fuji, so the fishers also try to take photos for us, using the one-use cameras that the company has donated. It doesn’t hurt that the turtles are charismatic organisms - we have received some remarkable pictures.

DoubleBlue Recruitment Recruitment at St. Michael’s College Left: Rachele Muia, B.A. (SMC 1972), In his document Planning for the St. George Colleges: A M.Ed. (1989) Raising our Sights Companion, the University of Toronto Provost recommended that all the Colleges develop a plan to “assess the effectiveness of recruitment activities and strategies, including an assessment of the quality of entering students”, a plan that would emphasize each college’s diverse strengths. As an alumna, and now as Registrar, I feel strongly that St. Michael’s College has much to offer prospective students: the personal attention which every student receives when they come to the St. Michael’s Registrar’s Office for assistance in academic or personal matters; the Chaplaincy; our residence facilities; and, our special academic programmes. More importantly, however, St. Michael’s is a friendly and informal community that welcomes students of all backgrounds.

A combination of luck and timing allowed the Alumni to dodge bullets while they managed just one score of their own in the first half. In the third quarter, the teams traded scores and the students (trailing 2-1) drove again to the Alumni goal line. The older Alumni were now starting to flag, but again the students were denied. In the fourth quarter, QB Mike “Cool Hand” Day (‘83) threw a spiral to Mr. Al “Hands” Hardy (‘80), who made the catch while sliding on one knee in the corner of the end zone. Pandemonium ensued as the game then ended 3-1 and there were hand shakes all around. This was a merry melee that would go big if repeated anywhere on the scrap map.
