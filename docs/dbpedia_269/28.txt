Career

Early music career

Christos Dantis started playing music in front of an audience when in his early teens. He sang and played either guitar or bass guitar, while also experimenting with the drums, in various music genre bands such as rock, funk, soul, R&B, metal etc. It was in the 1986â87 period of the Music Stage Taboo in Athens, when during the auditions for new singers to complement the program of main singers Tania Tsanaklidou and Dimitra Galani, composer George Hatzinasios was the "godfather" of his name Dantis.[2] During that period Christos sings in commercial advertising jingles while meeting with many influential producers like Akis Golfidis owner of R.I.A. Productions-Records back then, who produced most of his very first recordings in vinyl.

The first professionally produced song he sang was in 1986 titled "Tell me more" (T. Kallianiotis/T.Siganos) in a compilation named "Straight to the top"[3] consisting of various Greek artists singing English lyrics songs. The compilation was made by R.I.A. Productions and distributed by Sony in 1991. In 1987, he sang in his first 45rpm maxi single, again with R.I.A. Productions named "Christian Dante â Turn On" (C.Dantis/G.Shaggs) from Sakkaris Records (SR 8546).[4][unreliable source] One year later he collaborated with the composer Yannis Karalis and made his first television appearance on the TV show of Lilanda Likiardopoulou "Prova" on Karalis song named "Eida tin morfi sou".[5] Same year and his second LP single is out named "Belly Dance (Y.Karalis/T.Siganos).[6][unreliable source] Performances start to multiply for Christos singing covers of domestic contemporary pop/folk hits and foreign covers of songs sung by James Brown and Terence Trent d'arby.[7]

The album became gold and the song "Kapoios Sâ Agapaei" appeared on MTV once more. Dantis released another album a year later in 1995 called Tama. The album became gold and following his gold success, Dantis decided to release another album in 1996 called Foni Voodos and another in 1997 titled Ta Giousoufakia.
