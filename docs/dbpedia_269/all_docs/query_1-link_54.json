King, U. S. isavV The subject of victory in limited war °ne which deserves the attention of military 0 Political planners, particularly in view of takes of the recent past. From the military 11 Hander’s point of view, victory will al- ys be the objective; however, overriding Ob’ 1C&1 conslderations may dictate national v- Motives which preclude complete military • °ry. In view of the complexities of the to CS raased by the author, it is disappointing tead in his essay the cliches of the past, be military officer should be just as aware\n\nas his political counterpart of the complexities of international affairs in 1969. One of the old slogans which must be re-evaluated is MacArthur’s famous “In war, there can be no substitute for victory.” Playing the classic military role, MacArthur chased the enemy to the Chinese border, and the war escalated. Had he stopped near the 38th parallel—in keeping with the political objective of saving South Korea from the Communists—we would still be where we are today, at far less cost in lives. Going back to World War II, the policy of unconditional surrender may have cost us the possibility of having a united postwar Germany.\n\nLieutenant Parnell states “Only if we are prepared to fight World War III, can we prevent it.” I submit that we are prepared to fight World War III. This does not mean that we should deliberately- provoke it. The author goes so far as to discuss brinkmanship, and he even implies that we should return to this outdated policy. Unfortunately major wars often are started through blunder, mis­calculation, and irrational acts, including brinkmanship.\n\nThe author’s prescription for fighting limited war is well-stated, but does not apply to Vietnam. No effective way has been found to cut the enemy’s line of communications in that country.\n\nThe time has long passed for us to be still dividing the world into two ideological camps, as Lieutenant Parnell has viewed the prob­lem. Certainly the Soviet Union poses a major threat to our security. The reason for this is that the U.S.S.R., a country with in­terests inimical to our own, has a major nuclear capability; however, to see every other Communist country in the world as a threat is to ignore the deep divisions within the Communist world. If we are to follow a sensible national policy, we must exploit these differences.\n\nThe author counsels nipping Communist moves in the bud. This is sound policy, and has been done by the United States on more than one occasion. However, sometimes we end up helping the wrong side. Who could have predicted that Castro would turn Com­munist?\n\nOf course political considerations are not applicable at the tactical level. A command-\n\nOur historical ignorance, our diplo®'\n\natif\n\ncaf\n\nalways, however, the most unkind cut co\n\nan1\n\nid\n\ning officer who finds his ship under attack should defend himself without stopping to speculate on the political motives of his attackers. However, an essay which delves into matters of broad national policy should recognize the complexities of today’s inter­national scene.\n\n★ ★ ★\n\nF. W. Geberth—I read with interest Lieu­tenant Charles L. Parnell’s paragraph:\n\nEvery atrocity of the enemy must be made public to the entire population of the affected country and broadcast to the enemy, so that in addition to being hated by the populace, some of the enemy may begin to doubt the rightness of their cause. The enemy, by a com­bination of sophisticated and simple psycho­logical appeals, must be made to feel like an outcast from humanity, a criminal and traitor to his culture and heritage, and a tool of Com­munist imperialism.\n\nSubstitute “Western” for “Communist” and you have a very concise outline of the methodology of a vociferous segment of the population of the United States, whose propa­ganda assaults seem to be directed to making our difficult international position untenable.\n\nLieutenant Parnell’s discussion of the psychology we ought to bring to bear on the peace negotiations, and before, reminds me of a passage from a brief biography of General Sir Gerald Templer by the well-known naval historian, C. Northcote Parkinson. In his “A Law Unto Themselves,” speaking of the civil war in Malay, circa 1951, Parkinson talks about the years of British defeat in this theater, and he makes some observations about the non-Communist Chinese which are certainly applicable to most oriental philos­ophies:\n\nWhere they differ from the European is in being more realistic. Confronted by a battle­field or a racecourse, they seek, first and fore­most, to spot the winner. To be on the losing side they feel, is neither dignified, profitable, or even safe. It is for this reason that diplo­macy is usually lost on the Chinese. If they foresee your defeat, you are wasting your time.\n\nIf they anticipate your victory, it is they who will be trying their diplomacy on you. The vital thing is to give the impression that your success is certain and that your opponents are merely unlucky. This cannot be done, how­ever by a mere play-acting. You need to ha'c a real confidence in your own real abilitieS' It must be made clear from the start that y°u simply cannot lose.\n\ninnocence and the punctilious Amenc conscious confronted by the particular he® break of this war makes us easy mark for slings and darts of a sophisticated enemy- *\n\nomeS from closest home, the seats of power front rows of legislature.\n\nAmericans have always, finally, united 11 the face of “present danger,” but the ene''1' has weapons that are both effective and sub1 Let us hope that the danger is made clear the new breed of American in time. Mea1' while, some of us pin our hopes on the “P1^ fessional” services, for whom these ti’T must be “uphill all the way.”\n\n★ ★ ★\n\nLieutenant Commander A. N. Olsel1’ Civil Engineer Corps, U. S. Navy—Liet’j tenant Parnell has very succinctly analyze the factors involved and sequence of evef ‘ leading up to the “limited wars” in which \" ^ find ourselves involved. In his proposal ® quick action for small wars, he will find l't argument. On the other hand, two very ^ portant questions have been given only br'e mention in this essay. Discussions and Pr° posals on them could undoubtedly fih braries. On the first question “when do \" begin?”, no comment will be made as th will always depend, as the Marines say—-“0^ the situation and the terrain” and in the fir>a analysis by a political decision.\n\nOn the author’s question of “how far c we go?” however, there is one theory, ^'C provisions of which should always be cot> sidered, prior to terminating hostilities where short of unconditional surrender.\n\nWith the elimination of personnel, Communists’ principal remaining resource lS that of real estate. At the present time, Communist world already controls a large percentage of the world’s land. But the) still want more: The loss of some of their present real estate would be a severe bio'' to them.

Many of the factors re- r u to this approach would have to be re­f ec' to the diplomatic and political arena r resolution.\n\nMe\n\nin Panmunjon and Paris. any war, no matter what the size, the is to hurt the enemy. The loss of\n\nair group observes a radar contact sus­. ted to be a periscope, and the contact mediately disappears. The contact is tted, and the information is relayed to the fl ”• A decision is made to launch the ready UtV ASW helicopters.\n\n^ o situations of this type, the helicopters e often vectored to datum, the last known e°sition of the submarine. For the CVS, how- th^’ most dangerous course of action that j e submarine may choose, in fact, the most °§jcal choice would be to intercept and at- the CVS. Thus, a tactically better deploy- eut of helicopters would be to vector them\n\nto a point where they would intercept the attacking submarine, rather than to datum. By using Tacan equipment and some ele­mentary maneuvering board plotting, the helicopter can be vectored to intercept the submarine regardless of the submarine’s course or speed. The only assumption neces­sary is that the submarine is intercepting the CVS on an unchanging course and speed.\n\nThe plan is based on the fact that the DRM of the intercepting submarine is a constant and is also a Tacan radial. Figure 1 is a rela-\n\ntive plot. Point “O” is the CVS and the center of the maneuvering board. The datum is up­dated to account for any delays in the relay of information from the S-2E to the CVS. Point “A” is the geographical plot of datum. “AA'” represents movement of the CVS since datum time. “OA'” is the DRM which re­mains constant, and the MRM at datum time.\n\nFigure 2 is a solution for the maximum SRM. “OP” is CVS speed, “OP'” is maximum\n\nCaptain William C.

Point “B” is the CPA of the submarine for the time late, and is the relative position to which the helicopters should be vectored.\n\nThe plan can also be used if the CVS turns away from datum because the submarine’s reaction to the turn would not be instanta­neous. A sharp CIC crew would plot point “B” initially as a geographical point, and then advance point “B” as if the CVS were on the original course. When this plot is combined with a track of the CVS, it would be a simple matter to pick off the range and bearing to point “B” for the ETA of the helicopters over point “B.” This range and bearing would be a tacan radial and distance. Where the CVS has changed course, the tacan position given the helicopters would be valid only once.\n\nIn the case of the disappearing radar con­tact without any other intelligence, this plan\n\nis useful because at least it places the AS' helicopters in an area of high probability 0 making contact.\n\n★ ★ ★\n\nDoyle suggests a plan that in principle ready exists in tactical doctrine. His plan what would be called an intercept search- The unique aspect of Lieutenant Doyl® proposal and hence, worthy of note, is 1 association of the tacan information with 11 manuvering board solution parameters. , The applicability of this proposal reS on the assumption that the submarine is at tempting to attack the CVS.

King”\n\n(.See cover, January; p. 115, May; and pp. 101\"'®' September 1969 Proceedings)\n\nRear Admiral E. D. Stanley, SupP^ Corps, U. S. Navy (Retired)—With refcr' ence to the portrait of Fleet Admiral ErneS J. King, which appeared on the cover of d’f January 1969 Proceedings, there was e*' pression of interest in the fact that Fleet Ac miral King habitually wore a white handke* chief in the breast pocket of his blue servic^ uniform.\n\nI do not know when Fleet Admiral Ki® first adopted this custom in dress, but I know that it was habitual with him when * first met him in 1926. My father reported th3' summer for duty on the staff of Command^1 Aircraft Squadrons, Rear Admiral J- J' Raby, whose flagship was the USS Wrig Admiral King, then a captain, was the Con3' manding Officer of the ship.\n\nFleet Admiral King was tough, very tough’ but he understood people and had a kindly interest in young people. With his permis'\n\nand\n\n°Ur Navy adopted the double-breasted sack i following the example set by the Royal \\ avY, the uniform was designed with two _ C e Pockets and one breast pocket. In other 0rds, the Navy adapted the design of civilian 0thing of the time. It was civilian practice k Usc the side pockets to carry things and the feast pocket of civilian clothes habitually ported a handkerchief. Certainly, naval t'cers try always to be logical and to learn oy equipment is designed as it is. The very ct that the breast pocket was there implied -p at it had been provided for some purpose. , Us might not include carrying a pencil in e Pocket, but a handkerchief would be quite appropriate. Hence, it should not have been SUrprising to see a handkerchief placed in 'c breast pocket of the Navy uniform. As a\n\n,tl0n> I served in the Wright as an official ^apprentice boy” and for some time (perhaps in p°nt^ was allowed to serve as bow hook jr aPtain King’s gig. It is small wonder that °ITl that time on Fleet Admiral King was one \"heroes.”\n\n.aring my days as a midshipman and nior officer, I often thought of the handker- « which Admiral King wore in his breast ijrC^et and I admired that touch in his k ess- I was reminded of this use of a hand- erchief when I saw Admiral King in Norfolk at the time that he was appointed as ',lr|inCh/CNO. Shortly thereafter, I was a Jrn°ted to lieutenant. I suppose that it was combination of emulating my hero, the Ppeal of adding a white spot below my then ribbon, and some sense of having ^ ached a most exalted rank; but in any t- ent> after checking the Uniform Regula- ns and finding no bar, I decided to wear a lte handkerchief in the breast pocket of V blue service uniform. I wore it from then .^>til I retired at the end of 1965. At no time n those 23 years did any senior officer com- • nt to me about it. Several times, however, mor officers asked me the basis for my cus- i !Tl- My explanation was essentially what I SCt ^own here.\n\n, . hy did Admiral King wear a handker- let in his breast pocket of the blue service aorm? Here are some possible answers: ... t he blue uniform worn by our Navy up un- 1 the time of World War I had a high collar oo exterior-pockets in the jacket. When\n\nmatter of fact, it was not really uncommon to see a handkerchief worn in the breast pocket by naval officers in the early 1920s. But by the late 1920s, the practice had pretty much died out, except for the specific example of Admiral King.\n\nIt seems pertinent also to note that Ad­miral King was attentive to, and an innovator in matters of uniform. It was he who came up with the idea of wearing the grey uniform, which was official during World War II. It was he, who for a short while, wore the white service uniform jacket with blue trousers. I believe it was Admiral King who authorized the use of the black bow tie with the blue service uniform for semi-formal evening wear.\n\nAt this late date, I recommend that the Uniform Regulations be amended to pre­scribe (authorize?) the use of a white handker­chief in the breast pocket of the blue service uniform as a mark of, if not affection, then respect and admiration for Fleet Admiral Ernest J. King.\n\n★ * *\n\nCommander Edward C. Ives, U. S. Naval Reserve (Retired)—Although I never had the opportunity to see “Uncle” Ernie King in a dress uniform with a handkerchief in the upper left pocket, I did observe an unusual uniform violation which he practiced on the several occasions on which I had the pleasure to be in his presence.\n\nEarly in World War II, Secretary of the Navy, Frank Knox, who was a student of heraldry, noted that the cap device eagle worn by U. S. naval officers faced to “its own left.” In heraldry, a proud eagle should face “dexter”—to its own right. Secretary Knox issued a directive to the effect that all eagles\n\nENTER THE FORUM\n\nRegular and Associate Members are invited to write brief comments on material published in the Proceedings and also to write brief discussions on any topic of naval interest for possible publication in these pages. A primary purpose of the Proceed­ings is to provide a place where ideas of importance to the Navy can be exchanged. The U. S. Naval Institute pays an honorarium to the author of each comment or discussion published, at the rate of $45.00 per printed page in the Proceedings.\n\n1\n\non officers’ caps should face right.\n\nAs far as I know, there were two senior officers who did not change their cap devices, i.e., Admiral “Ernie” King, who was Com­mander-in-Chief of the U. S. Fleet (Com- inCh), and Admiral William Leahy, who was the Naval Advisor to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. I still have a “left-facing” eagle cap device.\n\nThe change from left to right facing eagles cost us about $5.00 per cap device even back in early 1942.\n\nWho Fired The First Shot?\n\n(See R. D. Layman, pp. 112-113, March; and p. 108, August 1967; see also the following comment, “Self Destruct Devices.”\n\nCaptain Lauro F. de Mendonca, Brazilian Navy—Mr. R. D. Layman believes SMS Goeben fired the first warship shots in World War I.\n\nBut Mr. Kenneth D. Smith, Jr., contra­dicted the statement later, and said that this honor should be due the famous German raider SMS Emden, which in the early dawn of 4 August 1914 fired several 10.5-inch shells at the Russian steamer Rjaesan.\n\nActually, the German cruisers SMS Augs­burg (Captain Fischer) and SMS Magdeburg (Captain Habenicht) fired the first shots of the maritime war in World War I, over the Russian base of Libau, at 1 August 1914, three days before the bombardment of Philippeville by the Goeben, and the seizing of the Rjaesan by the Emden.\n\nThe first shots fired by a ship in that war probably came from the Danube flotilla, Austro-Hungarian Navy, which helped the Imperial Army to fight the Serbian defenses after 28 July 1914.\n\n\"Self Destruct Devices”\n\n(See R. C. Smith, p. 96, June 1969 Proceedings)\n\nKenneth D. Smith, Jr.—During the last few years I have done considerable research on the Cormoran, including a review of official German and U. S. records and documents, and I would like to clarify one or two points in Captain Smith’s letter.\n\nThe Cormoran began her seagoing career as the Russian steamer Rjaesan (or Rjasan accord­ing to various documents). Built in Germany in 1909 for the Russian Volunteer Fleet Associa­tion, the vessel operated between Vlad1'0 stok and Shanghai.\n\nIn the early hours of 4 August 1914, 11 Rjasan was sighted in the Straits of Tsushi'11'’ by the soon-to-be-famous German crifof Emden, which was forced to fire several 10’ cm. shells at her before she hove to and s111 rendered. Thus, the Rjasan not only becaIllC the first of the Emden’s many prizes, but participated (unwillingly) in the first nav action of World War I. These were only of several “firsts” or “lasts” involving t0 Cormoran. She was also the last German \"rar^ ship to remain at large in the Pacific afl^ Indian Oceans in World War I and, as note in Captain Smith’s letter, she participated l0 the first military action involving the Unfie States after it entered the war.\n\nAs Captain Smith indicated, the Comoro1 raiding career was unsuccessful, and Adfflir Graf von Spee undoubtedly recognized th this would be the case when he detached dlC Cormoran and the Prinz Eitel Friedrich fr°°j his squadron and sent them south to ra1 merchant shipping in Australian wate'5' His main purpose in sending these two raid1’15 south was temporarily to distract attenti°° from the movement to South America (al1 ultimate destruction) of the main force of the German East Asia Squadron, and in this be was successful."
