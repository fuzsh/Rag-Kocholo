'Don't you agree’ Women vote on personality.\" She pursed her lips faintly, as though to say: \"Why argue?\" The nicest women usually refuse to let themselves be drawn into the battle of the sexes, even in fun. They know how futile it is—a debate between Martians and Venusians, without inter¬ preters. \"I vote for the man.\" she said. \"Shouldn't you strike a balance between the two?\" I suggested. 'But voting the party right or wrong is more a male fault,\" I said, presenting her side of the argument—as she had expected me to do. I think. But she did not come to my aid. She merely looked at me tolerantly, to see what I was going to say next. ‘The party vote can elect good men, and It also elects men who richly deserve to stay In private life,\" I Mid. \"For example, X.” And I mentioned a name \"Anyone who would vote for a person with a name like that needs to have his head examined.\" she Said.

Ah. female logic.\" I mumbled. \"That just Isn't the kind of name that deserves to be elected.” she said with an air of finality. And she wouldn't add any more to the subject, except a smile.

M'N'OAV, MARCH 12. 1961 A Force for Peace 'TITFRE ia every indication \"that * Commt .'ommonwealth nations arc plan¬ ning to form a solid front.in an *11- oui attempt to break the world dead¬ lock on disarmament. If such a concerted move were made by Commonwealth countries— collectively In the L'fiited Nations and'individually in their own partic¬ ular spheres of Influence—it would not be over-optimistic to look for some concrete results. Outside countries in recent years have tended to underrate the strength of the Commonwealth, see¬ ing in it perhaps only the ruins of the once mighty British Empire and pointing with glee at the conflicting racial policies and ideologies among it* members as further evidence of its futility and weakness. In subscribing to these view* they are gravely in error. Despite the differences in internal affairs as practised by various member nations the Commonwealth still provides a common meetine place wherein policies of mutual benefit can be de¬ rided. It would not he wishful think¬ ing to believe that in the face of any International emergency today the Commonwealth countries would bury their differences and unite as a solid force, just as they did In 1939. Firm proof of this has already been provided in the decision of Com¬ monwealth Prime Ministers that world disarmament is the major problem faring the London meeting. At present Canada. Britain and India are internationally recognized as the main champions of disarma¬ ment. but to a large degree their ef¬ fort* have failed to arouse the world —divided as it is by the two great nuclear powers—to any action. If, however, the Commonwealth emerges from this meeting as a third powerful international group, able to call on the support a I lies of both major powers. It could accomplish its objective, at the same time proving that the Commonwealth is still a force to be reckoned with, albeit a torce for peace rather than for war and total destruction. Who Does Job Best? 'THE Canadian Chamber of Com- A men* is taking the opportunity of the current Royal Commission on government organization to press Its argument that the government should get out of all business that can be performed satisfactorily by private enterprise. The commission has been told that the chamber does not like the CBC competing with private radio and television for the advertising dollar. The chamber also thinks gov¬ ernment annuities first offered in 1908 are now redundant, while the government printing bureau comes under criticism for extending Its op¬ erations far beyond the production required by parliament. *. The chamber say* that these gov¬ ernment operations are not fair to private enterprise hecause many of Iheir running expenses—such as of¬ fices. furniture, mail and telephone services—are paid by another de¬ partment. The National Film Board also onmes in for criticism. In the fiscal year ended March 31,, 1939. only three government department mo¬ tion picture films out of 45 were produced by private film companies. The chamber wants the private companies to get a much larger share of the business. As the voice of the business com¬ munity. the Canadian Chamber of Commerce is .merely fulfilling its function to bring its thoughts to the Giassco Commission, but that body will no doubt weigh up carefully what Canada's Crown corporations have achieved before accepting the criticism as a who'e. It should he a matter of deciding who doe* the job best. There can be little douht that, whatever their other faults, the CBC and the National Film Board have done a valuable job in presenting Canadians in the way that no profit- motivated private organizations would have done. It would be also difficult to say that the government annunities are any Ie*a a valuable contribution to the Canadian well-being than Cana¬ dian Savings Bonds which are ac¬ cepted everywhere! Despite what tit# Canadian Chamber says there are time* when private enterprise may have to take a back teat. They Won’t All Watch UrfGHWAYS Minister P A. Gag- * 1 lardi paints half a picture when he say* a boy hit by a car at 30 miles an hour is Just as dead as a boy hit at 50. That is a graphic response to a request for reduction of a high¬ way speed limit in North Vancouver, but while it may be true, it Is not the whole truth. The other part of the picture Is that If there is a boy in the road, the car travelling at 50 miles an hour is far more likely to hit him. Besides giving the boy less time to get out of the way, the car moving at 50 take* 201 feet to stop, according to a commonly accepted average, and the car moving at 30 takes 87. To Mr. Gaglardl's credit, how¬ ever, he has promised to take a “long look” at the request and he ha* offered some other observations that make good sense: that children can be given a false sense of security by being shielded from the automo¬ tive facts of life; that “children are not taught proper appreciation of a motor vehicle Consequently they feel a motorist is going to watch out for them, is going to stop for them ” Certainly every driver should constantly watch for children or any¬ thing else in the road and be pre¬ pared-do stop. But Mr. Gaglardl's meaning Is \"clear. Some of the distressing facts of life are that there are impatient and careless driver* as well as good, and that they won't all watch or stop; that, as can be seen on the highway approaches to Victoria, even the careful often are swept along, ex¬ ceeding the speed limit* for fear of impeding and disrupting the flow of traffic; that highways, huilt for rapid transit, are deadly places for young feet, with or without low-speed zones. But awareness of the danger is not the whole solution to the problem. The expensive day will have to come, If B.C. highways are to remain fully useful for their Intended pur¬ pose. when through residential areas they all are fenced, elevated or otherwise made as inaccessible as possible except at protected en¬ trances and crossings.

John, who loved poalry, , should have the best of teaching. He was a pupil at the renowned St. Paul s School, where he formed two last¬ ing friendships with Tom Young, a Scot. . and the Italian. Charles Dlodate, to whom he dedicated a LaUn poem. When only 16. this schoolboy genius wrote the following hymn. It has out¬ lived many of his later poems. Going on to Christ College, Cam¬ bridge. he graduated at the age of 20. Milton was now making a naaae by hia literary works and poems. It Is juat 300 years ago that Milton toured Italy, forsook poetry for a time and diverted hta attention to writing of ®ollt1cal affairs, for the England of Ms ■time was seething and the civil war was about to break. Milton arms, of course, on the side of Cromwell and wrote articles in favor o( the king's execution. But Mlltop was fast losing his sight. Alter some year* of poor sight, he went totally bljnd at the age of 4t. Never, theless. he continued at his post-* of secretary lor foreign affairs to the coun¬ cil of stale, until the nation was clamor- ing for the return of Charles 11. The Royalists left Milton alone, and so did many others He became lonely and neglected, and in the end a rectus*. But John Milton lived true to hts great Ideals. He started to recapture hts poem- dream. and. In the year 1663 he had,writ¬ ten Paradise Lost, having been blind for IS year* It was two years before It was pub¬ lished. to gain fy him the admiration of the world. Dryden wrote: 'Thl* man cuts us all out. and the ancients, too.\" Four yearst later came Paradise Regained. Milton cannot be called a hymn writer. His writings are too srhntastlr for the rank and file and do not lend them- selves readily to musical setting. This hymn ia founded on Psalm 136: let us with a gladsome mind ’ Praise the Lord, for He la kind; For his mercies-aye endure— Ever faithful, ever sure.

Actually he doesn't know any more about heavyweight champions than he does about the Russian race¬ horses he was talking about In this apace the olhef* day. but he couldn’t admit that to a visitor and so he plumped for Patterson. The tatter has more determination, he thinks, and la a smaller fighter. Nor wilt Patterson be to blame If his victory makes the Congolese rheer snd causes them to have another smack at the UN whiles, Canadian troops Included. Still and all perhaps a Nordic victory at this point in current history wouldn't he a had thing.

She came bark to New York 21 years after the premiere of the \"Gone With Uie Wind\" film that made her a celebrity, only to meet a reporter who didn't know of her starring part In this picture. Mias Leigh was huffed, but perhaps by knowledge of what the yean had done to her while this Innocent young news- . man was growing up. When young¬ sters become men it Is always a shock to adults, causing them to approach a mirror in fear.

And a good Job this is so else life would hr unbear¬ ably dull and society would stagnate.

The pro posats, whlrh have been discussed privately with member* of the Six. principally Western Germany, and partially disclosed In unofficial reports during the past lew months, have now been officially confirmed. Rritaln Is not oflering to join the Common Market as It stands. Nor la the ready to Join In the movement towards a European political federation -which !s the eventual aim of most of the Common Market countries. But In the political field she la willing to take part in the kind of loose political association that President de Gaulle has in maid for Europe. The proposal for a customs union Is limited to a common external tariff for raw mafenalx and manufactured goods coming from countries other than the Commonwealth and the Seven Power European Free Trade Area. It would not apply to agri¬ cultural produce. In return lor ex¬ cluding the Commonwealth. In order to preserve the present free entry of Commonwealth goods Into Britain, -the British are prepared to sacrifice Some of their own preferential tariff privileges In other Commonwealth countries. •The confirmation of three proposals coincided with the bolding of talks between British aqd French economie experts in London, following on similar Anglo-German and Aqglo-Itallan talks. Although the Anglo-French talks have hern officially described as \"useful\" the French are Understood to regard the British proposals as Inadequate on several counts. The French attitude appears to be much more sceptical than that shown so lar by the West Germans. By ROBERT NTEPHE.NN Thl* Is not surprising. For the West German and French motive* In approaching the talks are not the same. Indeed, the phrase currently used to describe this problem \"Sixes and seven*\"- has never been more apt. It is a tangle ot cross purposes, with at the heart of the tangle a painful paradox. The West Germans, who are ardent supporters of European federation, are also anxious for a trading agreement with Britain and the Seven, and want to avoid a political apllt which might weaken NATO. They and the Dutch have been working hardest for a com promise arrangement with Britain. The French under President de Gaulle have moved away from the aim of European federation, but it la they who are proving the most diffi¬ cult about a new deal with Britain. The paradox lx that President de Gaulle whose resistance to federation ha* weskcsied the political objections to closer British participation, is the very man who appears unwilling lor this participation to take place. Hie central fact ta that although the kind of European political organ¬ ization envisaged by President de Gaulle la one in which Britain could join, without serious scruples about sovereignty. President de Gaulla simply does pot want the British in. In President de Gaulle's view of the world. Britain belongs with the “Anglo- Saxons.* with the UJS. and the English- speaking Commonwealth. She Is not a natural part of the historic entity of Europe over whose recreation he sees France as destined to preside. Rritaln may be a frierjd and an ally, but to try to Include her In the GaulUat European family would he unnatural and embarrassing. It would prevent the development of the Independent European role In world affairs to which President de Gaulla looks forward. What the British have proposed. In fact. I* a European system In two layers. The Inner layer would be tha Six Powers of the Common Market, with a complete customs union among themselves, and with their own politi¬ cal Institutions dealing with questions directly concerned with the Common Market. Britain recognize* that this might lead to closer political Integra¬ tion ot the six. The outer layer would be a partial customs union Including the Six. Britain and other powers who raitht ask to Join. This could also develop common Institutions, including a political organization to consult on matters affecting Europe as a whole and Its ralatlona with th* rest ot the world. torsi cunritMt Sign of Peiping Decision in Albania The Packnack These Blank Expanses By GREGORY CLARK O NE thing to he said for thia new downdown architecture, these so- called contemporary style buildings like bogrk or shipping rrate* or Jumbo . _._ aL. ..An i gin** nqakrlum*: they provide some beautiful expanses ol^rall lor the sign painters to advertise patent medicines on In another few years.

Nevertheless we know that the most critical perils of the world are not associated with ignorance. We know that the unspeakable degradation through which humanity haa been dragged, la not the ac¬ complishment of Ignorance.

Somebody has put it that If you could give a modern university education to Nero and the Apoatle Paul, all you Perhaps It is simply that the physical nature of Spain, with Its stark mountains and sun- bleached plains, stretching across southwestern Europe like a bulls bide left to dry, produced a people In Its image, with epic qualities and epic failings. Perhaps the fascination lies In a sense of paradox. Spain Is one-third the size of Quebec, and of all countries seems among the least likely to make a major imprint In the Spentards may secretly pity anyone unfortunate enough to be bom outside their country.

The Chinese said in an ancient proverb that to edu cate a woman was to put a knife in the hands of a monkey. The modern man Is amused st the male vanity In that saying. But though It has a wrong application It was grounded In a sound principle. Certainly to educate a Nazi or a Communist Is to pul s knife in the hands of an ape : The situation is not improved if instead of a knife you give him a machine gun, and In¬ stead of ■ machine gun. an atomic bomb. An educated Nazi Is not an Improvement an an illiterate one. An lntetll gent Communist is not an lm- provement on a stupid one. He la Just more dangerous. We were not always so aware of this truth as we are now. after a world war which ended in an atomic explosion.

But Goldberg de¬ vised the strategy to do it, and Communist-dominated unions were either ousted or clea nsed. By GEORGE J. HARDER l sited Press International Arthur J. Goldberg, the new UB. secretary of labor, be lleve* that for every problem, there's a solution. Some solu lions are just harder ta find than others. If he finds one way won't work, he tries something else And then something different from that until the problem yields. That's why he's regarded as a whiz in the negotiating room. He never takes a dog¬ matic position from which he can’t retreat. Goldberg' was among the first to urge labor to set its own house In order against racketeers. He helped set up and run the Ethical Practices Code and Committee of the AFLrClO. Skill and Resources If this civilization disap pears. It will be laid waste not by hordes of uncouth bar bartons, but by the efficiency ef the most skilled scientists the world has produced, by the resources of the most IntelH gent and the best trained minds that any ctviUmtlon has ever known We must be careful not to fall Into the error of fearing knowledge and asking for s \"moratorium on science.\" If we are to conquer the prod iema confronting us we des perately need the full re¬ sources of our human knowl edge and the finest tech ntques of science He’s considered s middle-of- the-roader. a critic of the labor movement from Its own ranks who refuses to close his eyes to Its faults and failures. Lately, Goldberg has been preaching to labor leaders a philosophy of accommodation with management. To some old timers that seems like out right hcresey. It was that way when he was trying to. help labor lead ers get the AFL and the CIO together, There' were many who said It wouldn't be done. Goldberg produced one for¬ mula after another. He finally found one which, while it didn't please everyone and it didn’t work perfectly, brought the two powerful organlza tlons together.
