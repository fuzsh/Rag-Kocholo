CLAY, M.A. & SONS, AT THE UNIVERSITY PRESS. 268999 ^ About ten years ago Mr Gwatkin undertook to edit this Oration. The stereotyped text had been resised and settled ty him; notes on about the first 160 sectiona had been set up in type, and were waiting for final covrection, when Mr Gwatkin un- fortunately found that the pressure of other engage- ments made it hopeless for him to finish the work. The publishers some time last year tljerefore asked me to undertake the completion of the edition, as having recently been engaged on a revision of the speech of Demosthenes which, was made in answer to it. I have now done what I could in compliance with this wish. The notes in type have been finally revised by me alone for tlie press ; and therefore if there are any errora in them the blame must be mine, while Mr Gwatkin should be credited with the great learning and induBtry implied in their com- position. For the notes on the last 100 sections I am wholly responsible, as well as for those on the text, for the Introduction, Appendices, and Indices. I have been able also to introduce a certain nuniber of changes in the text in view of more recent ci:\\t\\cvs(a, I fear that the result may strike acxDQ iiitAac& »» ^e^** PREFACE.

A£SCHIN:bs was a man of bri11ia,iit natural gifts, wbo pkjed a part in a great national crisis perhaps not much leas creditably than most of hia contemporaries, but whose misfortune it has been to have been matched with a con- Bununate artist, and to have left work which it is for ever impossible to view except in comparison with that of hia greater rival. Thus in epito of bis natural facility, hia vivid presentation of facts, and the strength of his denun- ciation, hia oratory remains that of au amateur (ai! mni irrrx'\"'!^^) '• while that of Demosthenes in comparison has the advantage of geniiis trained by the prinuiplea of art and the discipline of experience. Aeschinea would have been the tirat to acknowledge this. He often warns his hearers against the profesaiotial artifices of DemoBthenes^; while he describes himself as being an unprofessional speaker, who had merely had the education and followed only the pursuits of an ordinary citizen, without any claim to special genius or great acqturenients' : and when he was afterwards requested by the Ehodiana to teach them the art of Rhetoric, according to the biographere, he repUed that he did not know it himself*.

Though he w sional Xoyoypd'/iot, lie hved in an age when everyone who aspired to have any influence in pubhc affaira was an orator with more or leas knowledge of tecfinioal rules. Few men of ordinary cultivation in our day would be iacapahle, if corapelUng oiroumfitanoea arose, of eipresaiiig their viewa in a fairly readable Magazine Article ; and few educated Athenians of the age of the Orators would under like circuQiBtancea be icoapable of conipoaing a apeeoh more or less conforming to the rules of art. And though Aescbines may have had only the ordinary training of a respectable citizen, he WBiB not a, man of ordinary genius; and when he attempted oratory, as the obvious weapon of political life, shewed at once that, with the defects of the amateur, — such aa an occ^aaifinal writer may display in comparison with a trained joumaliat, — he had the root of the matter in him. If we turn from the question of artistic excellence, leaving the palm undisputed in the possession of Demosthenes, and consider the moral quali- ties displayed by the two orators, it seems more difficult to decide. Partisan feeling is not quite dead after more than 2000 years. Historians, who believe in the patriotic virtue and the poUtical sagacity of Demosthenes, must needs denounce the invectives of Aeschines as audacious fictions or malignant calumnies ; yet it would not be difficult to convict Demosthenes of perversions of fact not leas shame- less ; and certainly nothing in all literature, except perhaps certain passages ia Cicero's Second Philippic, is to be found more deliberately malicious, and more in violation (as it would seem to us) of every principle of good taste or humanity, than the celebrated description of Aescbines' mother in the de Corona. But such comparisons are not very iruitfuL The change of sentiment in our age in regard to such mutual recrimiuatious is in some respects so great, that it is not now easy to make the necessary abatement ill forming our estimate of the character o£ the man who LTFE AND TLVES OF AEfiCBINES. xi uould utter such worda without loss of self-resiiect or of ruput&tion among his contemporarieH.

He had shared in the banishment of the cousti- tutional party by the Thirty in B.O. 404^3, and in ita returu*. He seems to have been then engaged in Bom.e of those military operations in Asia Minor which followed the attack of Tiesaphernea or the Ionian cities in B.a 399 ; but in what capacity and under what commander we are not told, though his son says that he distinguished himself for personal bravery'. The mother of our Orator was Qlaucothea (or, as it is sometimes found, Glaucis or Leu- cothea), — daughter of Glaucos of Achamoe, and sister of Cleobulus. It seems certain that neither Atrometua nor Olaucothea were members of wealthy or diatinguiehed femilies, and Aescliines nowhere makes any such claim. Yet his father's family was not mean; it belonged to a phratry which used the same altars with the Eteobutadae (a family of some distinction which was accustomed to supply the Priestess of Athena Polias'), and therefore was no doubt more or leas remotely connected with it in blood. And though Atrometus was poor, Aesuhines appears to have had the ordinary education of a boy of respectable parents. He was strong and vigorous in body, and after attaining the legal age for the docimasia' (about 15) might 1 Aeschin F L %%1S 147 * apisTair h rot K ti ros.

But, according to his own statement, he served at once for two years in the local guard or militia, the 7r*piVoXoi, in which every freeman had to do one, or perhapa two, years duty '.

When playing the part of Oenomaua and pursuing Pelopa he stumbled and fell, had to be assisted to hia feet by the Chorua-master Sannio, and was conse- quently hissed off the stags'. But events in Greece, between the 13th and 23rd year of the life of Aeachinea, were leading up to auch Aaeiunaai measures on the part of Athens as were likely to give him the opportunity of distinguishing himiself in other sceuea. A revival of her old maritime supremacy, though on a much reduced acale, had been commenced in b.o. 37B by the formation of the new League of states, whoae aynedri were to meet at Athena, and whoae contribution or syntaiis was to be paid into the Athenian eicliequer for the aupport of the commou int«reata. The Spartan aupremacy in the varioua Hellenic citiea, always oppressive and unpopular, and rendered odious for the lost nine yettrs by the diagntceful concessions to Perfda of the peace of Antalcidaa (B.C. 387), was systemati- cally attacked, until by the Peace of Callias, early in b.O, 371, it was practically brought to an end. But the battle of Leuotra shortly afterwards in the same year changed the position of affairs. Spnrta was no longer formidable; but the Theban Government interfered in every direction, ItB policy in the Peloponnese might have been viewed with comparative indifference at Atbeus; hut the eatabliah- njent of a Theban supremacy in Euboea was a menace to the Athenians which they could not bear with equanimity, ' See the first Life.

W I .Olid when the restoration of Manticea, and the fouuda- tioD of Megalopolis by Epaminondaa threatened Sparta with the formidahle oppositioo of a Arcadian Uniou, the Athenians hstened to tl ' request of the now humbled Sparta and made with her an offensive and defensiye alliance. An Athenian force wan despatched [b.O. 370—369] to hold the line of the Oneian range and prevent the march of Epaminondaa icto Pelo- ponneae. Epaminondaa forced hia way through and was BOon after rewarded by the adhesion of Sicyon. But Phlius remained faithful to Sparta, and was consequently subjected to a aucoession of atta^ka. The war went on in a desultory fashion for two years ; the Spartans were sup- ported bj a contingent seat by Dionjsius of Syracuse, I and inflicted a defeat upon the Arcadiane [the 'Tearless Battle' B.C. 368]. Then foUowod the second expedition of Spaminondas into Feloponne»4e, which combined the cities I for a time in hostility to Sparta ; though his departure was followed by fresh disturbances. No city had Buffered more I than Pbliua. It was subjected to attacks from I Sicyon, which was allied with Thebea, from ^/^/-Jj/*' Argos, Pellcne, and Arcadia. But it held to JJ^\"'^\"' I Sparta, in spite of the periodical wasting of its crops and other hardships which ita people had to endure, and won more than one success over its tavaders. lu b.o. 368 the Athenian general Chares was stationed at Corinth I with an army partly of mercenariea and partly of Athe- [ nian citizens, and aided the Phliasians in conveying the f provisiona to their town rendered necessary by the wasting I of their own territory. Among the Athenian youths serving under Chares was Aeschines (aet 23), and in an engagement in the dry bed of the stream Nemea, where ' an ambusottSe of the enemy was forced, he behaved (he I says) with such gallantry as to receive the public com- £Jon of the conunanderB '.

The opportunity soon ijama. While the events alluded to above had been taking place, the Peloponnese had been torn by intrigues. Sparta wanted to recover Messene, the Eleians Triphylia. Thus in aa 366 — 5 there was war between Elis and the Arcadians, ■which brought on an invasion of Arcadia bj the Spartans (B.C. 3S5), and a battle near Olympia, at the very time of the Festival, between the Eleiana (who had been excluded) and the Arcadians (B.q. 364). The Arcadians seized the treaaurea at Olympia to pay tbeir men, and then fell to quarreUing among themselves. The general result in the Arcadian towns was the increased power of the wealthier olaases, who could alone afford to devote themselves to the war, and & consequent inclination manifeat^d to make tartns with Sparta; while the opposite party sent pressing invitfttiona to Thebes to come and prevent such a settle- ment (B.C. 363—2). The anti-Thebaa party in Arcadia protested against the sending of a Theban army without invitation, and contrived to get a peace between them- selves and EUs confirmed in the Pan-Arcadian assembly (b.0. 362). The view of these proceedings held by Epami- nondas and the Theban Qoveniment waa that the Arca- dians were guilty of treason to them in making a peace ' In advifiing hostility to Athena, as the daiit;eroDS rival now that Sparta was humbled, Epaminoailaii waa reported to have eaid ujr Stl rd r^v ' A.6i^vai<itv iKfjoirhXfwt TrpauvKiXia, /ijtraitrfKeijf ell H?!' rpMTaaiav Tiji Kafi^icCat. ^^^. 7. iios. |xviii I.S'TRODUCTIOX. without their coacurreace; and that it would isSTitabl; break down what it hod been their pohcj to set up,— a power in Peloponneso capable of counteracting the claima of Sparta. A frei^h invasion was therefore decided upon : ^^ and in the spring of B.C. 362 Epaminondaa Mof^a marched to Tegea, and waa there joined hj hia Foloponnesian aUies. The Spartans under Agesilaus were atatioiied at Mantinea, wliich, further *orth on the road from Sparta than Tegea, had to he reached hj them along a. circuitous route. After an UDSuccesdul attempt at surprising Sparta itself, Epami- nondaa wae obliged to give battle at Mantinea, which lay between him and home. Immediately after his return from the unsuccessful attempt on Sparta ho sent his cavalry on to surprise Mantinea. This he would have effected, if it had not been for the opportune appearanoo of the Athenians, who had marched through the Isthmus, and appeared on the brow of the hill just as the Tbehan cavalry came in sight'. The nest day the battle waa fought, in which Epaminondas fell. Though the victory was with tha Thebana, the death of that great man nullified ita effeutu, and a peace waa made which practi- cally ended the Theban supremacy, Aesohiuea (aet. 27) fought at Mantinea, as he afSrms, with honour aud in a manner worthy the city ; yet, according to Diodorus, tho AtheDJan cavalry, though behaving well, were as a matter of &ot beatfiu and forced from their ground, until sup- ported by the Eleiau cavalry'. The three years which follow (b.c. 362—359) are a blank as far as our knowkdge of the life of Aeschines goes.

After the battle of Leuotra (B.C. 371) the Theban Bupremacy had been exercised in Euboea to the detriment of the Athenian interests, in whose League of 378 b.c. moat of the Eubneaii towns had shared. The seizure also of Oropus by exilea in B.C. 366, already mentioned, had been eflected at the instigation of Themi- son of Eretria', and was a mark of the animus of the anti- Athenian and philo-Theban party. But, as usual in Greek states, the opposition to the dominant party grew in inten- sity with time, and when the prestige of Thebes sank gradually after the death of Spaminondas (362 B.C.), it soon became possible for Athens to once more assert her influence in the island. In B.C. 358 the Tliebana sent a force into Euboea to surprise the rising party of opposition to them. ^ Urgent messages were sent to Athens for help ; buuE-aboca and with unusual promptitude a. fleet and army was despatched within five daya, apparently under the chief commaud of Timotheus, Diodes and Chares having aLso commands in the expedition, which in 30 days reduced the Theban army to retire under terms'; the Euboean towns being tostored to independence.

Itheniana | both parties were inclined to make terras, — the Atheniana because they dreaded that bj the wBakness or treachery of Phalaecus Philip would become master of Pbocis, and Philip because his chief object was tu secure a hold on Thermopylae, with the ulterior purpose of making himself master of Pbocis ; and, in order to do go, wished to have the opposition of Athens out of the way. Tbese events happened at the end of b.c. 347. Bj February in the next year the ten Athenian ambaasadors were ready to start to visit Pliilip'. Their names were Cteaiphon, Ariatodemus, Phrynon, latrocles, Philocratea, Demosthenes, Aeachines, Nauaides, Dercylus and Cimon, along with Aglaocreon of TeQodoa, to represent the allies whose synedri met at Athens in virtue of the lesiguc of 378. The purpose of this embassy — which was to be the _. , turning point in the career of Aeschines and in lo Pkiiip B.C. hia relations with Demosthenes — waa not to make the peace, but to ascertain from Philip on what terms the peace could bo made. The points on which ansjety was felt may be summed up in the two words — Thrace and Phocia. In regard to the first the Athenians had two objects, (1) to secure that Philip should not at- tempt to oust them from the Chersonese, and (2) that as regards the rest of Thrace he should not entirely destroy the position of their aEy Ceraohlepteg, and should restore to them the possession of Amphipolis. As to Pbocis, the DD thia service. PhaloccuB. instead of giving up tbe pasta which secured the pass, — A.lponus, Thronium, and Nicoea, — even imprisoned the Phocisu ambassadors who had been to Athena. ' Among tbe reasons inducing the Athenians to consent to thia embassy was the fact that Philip had been behaving with great liberality in the matter of the release of yarious Athenian eitiieas who had fallen into bis hands, especially iu respect to those far whose release Aristodemus had been ecni lo ncgoeiate. w I ques' LIFE AXD TIMES OF AESC NINES, xsv question was whether they could make auch a peace oa could prevent Philip's passage of Thermopylae, and hia interference— in accordance with the invitation ofThebea— in the Sacred War, to the destruction of their allies the Phocians. Of what actually occuired on it we have only the account given by AescMnes himself, in one of the most graphic narratives to be found in the remains of Attic Oratory. Demosthenes in his speech in the prose- cution of Aeschines has httle or nothing to say on it ; for hie charge against him does not relate to his conduct then, but to that of a subsequent period, — hia report at Athens and his conduct on the second embaasy. Besides, if the account of Aeschines la to be aA:cept«d, Demosthenes would have good reason for touching aa lightly aa possible on the details of the first embassy. According to Aeschines, then, Demosthenes took pains on the way to Pella to cultivate intimacy with himself, aud with Aglaocroon -and latrodea, and \"i\"' AacH:- to warn them against the dishonesty of Philo- firit nnbaun orates, though he had been actually nominated ambassador by him. He made himself also disagreeable and oS'oiisive ill various ways duringthejoitfuey, and spoke boastfully of the 'inexhaustible fountain of arguments 'whereby he would confound Philip and close up hia mouth 'with an unaoaked rush,' and would persuade him to re- store Ampbipolia. But when they were admitted to an audience with Philip these vainglorious boasts were falsi- fied. The ambassadors had arranged that they would address Philip in order of age, and accordingly Deraosthe- tiea was to speak last. Aeschines, when his turn camo.

On the subject of AmphipoUa, he then tried to shew how it had been from time immemorial acknowledged as an Athenian possession, and had been fonuallj allowed to be so by Philip's own father Amyntaa. 'After this and some other speeches it came to the turn of Demosthenes to speak. Every one was on the alert eipeoting a superb -display of oratory ; for, as we heard afterwards, Philip himself aa well as his courtiers had been informed of hia eitravagant professions. With an audience thus all expectation, up gets this creature, and, afler a prelude obscurely expressed and dead with fear, before he had got far on with hia subject, suddenly became silent, hesitated, and finally broke down alto- gether. Seeing his condition Philip intreatad him not to be alarmed, and not to imagine that such a contre- temps had the same effect as it would have in a theatre. Pray,' said he, ' take your time, recollect yourself at your ease, and deliver what you intended to say.' But having once got confused, and lost the thread of hia notes, he could not recover himself ; tried once more to resume his speech, and once more broke down. There was a general silence ; and the herald ItfuJe \\i8 withdraw. But when we ambassadors wore alone together, our admirable De- mosthenes with a very gloomy expression of countenance said that I had ruined tho city and the allies. When the other ambassadors no less than myself expressed astonish- ment at this, and demanded why he said so, he asked me whether I had forgotten the state of aHairs at Athens, and that the people were in extreme distress and very anxious for the peace. 'Or do you,' said he, 'plume your- self on the fifty ships that have tieen voted but will never be manned? For you have irritated Philip; and the result of what you have said will not be that war gives place to 'peace, bat- jwace to war, though not open war.' ' I LIFE AND TIMES OF AESCIIINES. W ^^^ AoBciiinos' reply was int^iruptcd by a second si to the presence of Philip, nha, as he asserts, addressed his answer almost entirely to his speech, without making any reference to Demosthenes, at which the latter orator wns deeply chagrined. ' But when wa were on our way home from our mission ' all of ft sudden he begaa much to our surprise to talk to 'each one of us with aii air of affectionate politeness. I 'never knew before the meaning of the words 'monkey,' 'downy,' 'jack o' botK sides.' Thanks to his instruction ' however there is no knavery that I do not understand now, ' Taking each of us separately aside in turn, he promised to 'get up a subscription for one, assistance in his private ' business to another, election as strategus to another : ' while as for me, he kept following me about with congra- ' tulations on my extraordinary ability, and praises of the I 'speech I had delivered, until I was tired and bored with I ' his compliments. And when wo were all dining together 'at Lariasa he kept jesting at himself and the fiasco he ' had made of his speech, declaring Philip to be the clevcr- ' est man under the sun ; and when I capped this by some I 'remark about his having shown a wonderfully good me- I ' mory in his answer to our speeches i and when Ctesiphon, I 'the eldest of us, said that old as he was and many as I ' were the years he had lived, he had never seen anyone 'so agreeable aud charming, our Sisyphus clapped bis 'hands and remarked 'Neither you nor our friend here' ' (meaning me), 'Ctesiphon, would venture to tell the Athe- ' Diana that Philip was a clever speaker and had a good 'memory!' — Being quite off our guard and having uo 'suspicion of the trap he was setting for us, which 1 will 'eiplain to you presently, he induced us to enter into a 'kind of arrangement that we tcotdd tell you these imprca- 'sions of ours; and in toy case lie added an eai-ncst ' intrcaty that I would not forget to say that DemoathcoHji ■ J -ihaA as well as myself put in a word Rboat kav^vj^aJ^^ ' ' F.

It ia perhaps too much to believe that Aeschines was of such guileless simpUcity as to be taken in entirely by auch a dovice on the pari, of Demosthenes as he describes ; and at any rate he condemns himself in owning to having given a report on any one's suggestion, rather than on his own genuine impression ; and GrO'te further criticises his con- duct as an ambassador by remarking, that it does not speak well for his good sense if he made Amphipolis the main subject of his address to Philip. Amphipolis had been too long in Philip's hands, and it was too valuable to him as covering the rich goldflelds of Pangaeua, to allow of any chance of its restoration. The two points that were really of importance, and within the range of practical politics, were to keep Philip out of the Chersonese, and North of Thermopylae. Tho former Kiight be effected by a peace arranged on the basis of a sCatiu quo, each party keeping the towns actually in their possession ; the second could only be secured by including the Phocians in the number of the Athenian allies, who were not to be attacked hence- forward. But to do this waa for the Athenians to range themselves in opposition to Thebes and all the members of the Amphictyonic Ijeague, who were prepared to use to the utmost the help of Philip for tho punishment of these hated enemies. And though Philip wished to disarm the enmity and opposition of Athens, ha had no intention, as soon appeared, of covenanting himself out of the right of aotiag as champion of the Amphictyonic Council, and LIFE AND TIMES OF AESCHINES. xxix putting an end to the Sacred War by crushing Phocis if necessary. The pea.t:e now recommended in conaequencQ of the embaasy of the ten really gave up this jmint ; for Phocis was to be left out of the treaty ; that is, Athena fbrtonUy renounced any oUigatioo to aaaiat the Phociana, whatever measures the Amphictyonic Council, or Philip acting iu its name, might cliooaa to take against them. Even the Becurity of the Chersonese was weakened ; for though Philip was debarred by the treaty from attack- ing towns iu it belonging to Athens, yet his hands were left freer by the Thracian Cersoble])tes, whose aon waa a. hostage in Philip's hands, not beiag included in the Athe- nian alliance, but making terms separately. This in fact left Philip free to act in all parta of Thrace, except the Cheraoneae, wholly without reference to Athens, The Peace, therefore, was not very glorioxB or satisfac- tory to the Athenians: and such no doubt the orators felt to be the case, though it was impoa- gf Sc'IS^nu Bible to deny that, unless the people were willing ^i,ar^\"'\"t. to fling in their forces boldly with the Phociana, J\"^ ^\"^ and risk all in an armed opposition to Thebes '*'?5J\" \"^ and Philip, which their mistrust of the Phocian leader Phalaecus, if nothing else, prevented, some peace was necessary. It was in these circumstances that Dc- moBthencs chai'ges Aeschines with Ms first act of tci^ver- aation. According to a decroa proposed by Demosthenes himself there were to be two meetings of the assembly ; in the first the subject of the Peace was to be debated, in the second the votes were to be taken. In the first Demosthe- nes says that Aeschines vehemently opposed the peace proposed by Philocratcs, saying that ' while a single Athe- nian remained alive he would never advise this peace, although a peace of some sort was necessary ' : but tkat on the second day he took quite the opposite view, spoke vehemently on the other side, eihorted the Athenians 'ivat to be for ever dwelling on the gloucs oi \\,Wir Micti^wns,'Wi^ XXX. jyTRODVCTJOX. to undertake the support of other Greeks who hod never supported them'.' Aeachines rcpUea that the charge of Demcrathenes involves an inapossibiJity, as, in accordanea with his own decrw), the second meeting was to bo for voting and not for speaking^. But, unfortunately for thia apparently telling retort of Aeschines, he himself some years later complaiued that at the second day's meeting 'De- mosthenes monopolised the bema, leaving no one olse any- thing to say; and made a speech, questioned Antipat«r, and carried the decree of Philooratea'.' If thia latter state- ment ia true, and Aeschinea saja that ho remembered it distinctly owing to certiain particularly disagreeable eipros- sions of Demoathenea, it doea a good deal to destroy his first defence grounded on the fact that there was no speak- ing on that day. Still a statement made 16 years aft«r- waida is less trustworthy in itself than one made when the affair was recent ; and it is evident that Aeschines was at this time no more uncertain in his view than were others. He did not like the peace, and yet he feared -to reject it, and warned his countrymen against rashly undertaking distant eipeditions, like the disastrous invasion of Sicily; and advised them, while they emulated the glories of their ancestors, to avoid their mistakes. The two views, whether put forward on the same or on two following days, are not inconsistent, and do not necessarily imply the corruption insinuated by Demosthenes. They seem rather to indicate the divided feelings which were shared by tlio people at large ; who would fain hare opposed I'hihp and humbled Thehes, but were uncertain of their ability to sustain such a contest, and beguiled themselves with hopeful theories as to Pidlip's real intentions. Demosthenes seems to have beea conscious that at this stage of the proceedings there was little to say against Aeschinea. His real denunciations are 1 Dem. F. L. 17, ' Aeschinea, F. L. §§ 63—5.

Aeschinea makes but a poor answer to thi^ charge. He tries to esiplain that all he said waa that these things were the true interests of Athens ; and that they were what he had striven for, though for- tune and Philip were too strong for him : and he denies point blank, — with what truth it is impossible to say, — that he had had secret intercourse with Philip, and had acted ill collusioa with hioi in tho composition of the letter which was sent back with the ambaaaadors and served to put the people off their guard ^.

He had an- ticipated the prosecution, threatened against him for his conduct on the embassy, by securing the ruin, and apparent- ly the suicide, of one of those who menaced it. la hia speech againit Timarchvs (e.g. 345) he had taken occasion also, as far aa poaaililo, to prejudice hia hearers against the private character of Demosthenes, and to prepare them to reject the accusation which he waa about to bring against himself when he stood his audit {rZBwa) for his embassy ; but of overt acts iu this period Demosthenea can find nothing to attack ericept an instance of op^wsltiou to the patriotic side, and of support of Philip, in the case of the mission from Byzantium of the orator Python (probably in B.C. 341)'; and again his iotercuurse with Aiiuxlntis, supposed to be a spy of Philip's, but whom Aeschines asserts to have been in Greece only for the peaceful pur- pose of making purchases for Philip's wife Olympias-.

LIFE AND TIMES OF AESCHINES. xxxv Demoatlisnes charges Aescbinea with having deliberately helped to bring about, with the espress purpose of giving P hili p an eicuse for interference '. Aeachinea on the other band maintains that he acted on this occasion from pure aeal for the honour of the god and the sanotity of the Delphic territory, as well aa from a proper feeling of indig- nation at the injury done to the honour of Athens: and that the act of impiety on the part of the Ampiiisaians had been [>asaed over by others, and among them by Demo- sthenes, for the sake of bribes received from AmphiBsa. In February B.C. 339 Aeschines was one of the Pjlagorne at the spring meeting of the Amphictyonic Council at Delphi^. There he was told that the Ampbissian dele- gates, in order to please tVie Thebaua, were about to propose the levying of a line upon the Athenians on the ground of their having after Plataea (479 B.C.) set up certain gilt shields in the New Temple before it was dedicated-\", or, as Grote thinks, for having caused the inaoription \"dedicated by the Athenians, out of the spoils of Persians and Thebans engaged in joint battle ftg.iinst the Greeks\" — to be regilded, and put up again in a new- cell or chapel without the necessary ceremonies, — the insult to the Thebans being thus rendered again con- spicuous. This animus on the part of the Amphissians was soon betrayed by a speech of one of their number denouncing the Athenians for having espoused the cause of the sacrilegious Phocians, nnd recommending that their delegates should be expelled as under a curse {imr/iii}. Aeschines retaliated in a long speech in which he de- nounced the Amphjaaiana for having cultivated the sacred Cirrlmoan plain, which had been declared dedicate to the ' DemoBth. de Car. gg 143—151 oiVo't ianr 6 ovy*\"™- * Aesohin. in CUa. gg 106—139. * For the nature oE the act here desetibad, see notEB to g IIQ, and Crete, ii. 270. xxsvi lymoDucTiox god, and ordered to be left fallow ever aince the 1st Sacred War in the 6th century. The Ainphictyons prookimed a crusade, and were resisted in orma by the AmphiBsian^ A fresh councO was summoned, — to which on the advice of DemoBthouea the Athoniana refiLsed to send delegates,^ and in the spring of B.C. 338 Philip was invited by the Amphictyonic Council to come forward as their champion. With whatever motive therefore Aesohines had acted, the result of his policy had undoubtedly been to bring PhiUp once more South of Thermopylae. For Philip promptly availed himself of the invitation of the Aniphi- Eiaicia, and ctyons; One evening in the spring of B.C. 338 cJlZ^md^'^ tlie Athenians were startled by the news that (^•\"t '■•^ he had seized and was fortifying Elateia, which commanded the passes over Mount Oeta'. The news caused the most painful eieitemeot at Athene. Philip was again close upon the Attic frontier; and there was no doubt that, if he were not stopped, before many weeks were passed he would be dictating terms in the city. For the moment his partisans were cowed, and amidst the gloomy or perhaps treasonable silence of the usual speakers Demosthenes came forward with energetic pro- posals for warlike preparations; urging that aa alliauoe should be made with Thebes, and that the fortifications of AtbcQS should be restored. Demosthenes asserts that in these circumstances Acsciines did not say a word, either by way of attacking his decree, or by way of warning to the people of the danger into which they were running*. Against this charge AcsL-hines has naturally little to say', eicept to point to the disastrous result of the policy of Demosthenes as consummated by the battle of Chaeroneia (Aug. ac. 338), and the death of so many citizens in that struggle. 1 Dem. de Cor. %% 169—170. \" Dem. de Cot. g§ 179—191. 3 Acach, iJi CUi. %% 137—1*7. LIFE AND TIMES OF AESCHINES. xxxvii But though the effect of Chaeroneia was to coufirm the supremacy of Philip it does not seem to have enhanced the influence of Aeachines ; he was ajtrr the indeed put forward as the mouthpiece of n ciaa-aiiiia party to attack Demosthenes by proaeeuting Ctesiphon for illegahty in proposing to crown Demosthenes for his services (b.o. 337); yet in the seven years which elapsed between the notice given of this impeachment and the actual trial of the case (b.c. 337—330), there is no evidence of Aeschinea taking a leading part in Athenian politics. Demosthenes affirms that he was in the pay of Alexander after Philip's death (rc. 33S), as he had been in that of Phihp'. But whether that was ao or not, when Alexander ndvanced into Greece in the autumn of 336, and, obtaining the submission of the cities, was nominated as hia father had been two years before, commander-in- chief of all Greece for the meditated invasion of Persia, no speech or motion of Aeschinea ia recorded. He of course did not share in the intrigue with Darius, in which Demostlicnes was deeply engaged, Darius sent 300 talents as a subvention to the people, to enable them to form a coalition in Greece against Aleiander, and BO prevent the contemplated expedition into Persia, This money was refused by the state, but Aeschinea affirms that Demosthenes received TO tidents, which he appropriated, and refused to refund or to use for public purposes'. The Persian alliance was now the one hope of the an ti -Macedonian party; and we must imagine Aeachi- nes watching with alternate hope and fear for news of the victorious progress of Alexander from the moment of his crossing the Hellespont (b.c. 334) to hia final triumph over Darius (B.C. 330), which made him lord of all Asia^ But t Dem, de Cor. § 397. * §wrCKitiy -xpualav, Aesoh, in Ctea. %% 173, 209, 230.

Alexander had indeed won most of hia great victories, Granicus (334 B.C.), Iseua (b.c. 333), Tjre (ac. 332), Arbela (331 B.C.) ; but the hnal defeat and death of Darius was not yet known at Athena when the apeeches were delivered'. The Conqueror was still far out of sight, and there were still all the chances of a long and distant campaign in favour of a collapse of hiH mighty power as auddea as had been its rise. Therefore the voice of orators had atill aome siguiSconce, and Greece at large was able still to take an interest in a controversy, which would have httle meaning except in a free state and before a. In these circumstances this great trial at length com- , . menced. It drew an immeuHa concourse from \"\"•t w^ all parts of Greece.

Where it waa strong, that is on the two legal points, it did not appeal to any deep feeling on the part of the audience ; and when it came to the aubject whioh deeply moved the hearers, the question of the right i or wrong of the Demoathenic policy, it laboured under two fatal disadvantagesj^it dealt aJmoat entirely in assertion, i and malignant interpretation unsupported by proofs; and secondly the speaker had not the courage, in view of theN popular feeling, boldly to set forth a policy counter to that I of Demosthenes. It was easy to point out the fatal r suits of the Demosthenic meoaiires. Athena had failed and Buffered ; Philip had prevailodj and Alexander was master of the situation ; but the hearta of the audience wero with the orator who still maintained that, while all was lost, their honour was safe. Nor does Aeachines ever venture distinctly to trace out the policy which he or his party would have preferred to pursue. Perhaps he had no distinct idea of what that pohcy should be. It could only have been one of temporary expedients and careful coro- pliance ; of taking shelter while the Macedonian storm lasted, and waiting till better times should come. Such a pohcy admits of no definite scheme; it depends on the necessities of the hour ; and can only be judged by the ulti- mate result. Therefore while Demosthenes is attacked and defended on a multitude of definite points in an active policy, as well as with the failure of its sum total, it is generally abstention in the tim« of need, rather than overt acts, which is laid to the charge of Aeachines. Aa to the speech itself its construction ia loose and irregular, and does not contain any narrative passages as lively as some in the same Orator's speech on the Falsa Legatio. The lengthy and somewhat conventional prooe- jniam was criticised adversely by the ancients : there is no regular statement of the subject of the indictment (^(>d- fl(crit) : such as there is gives only an im\"\\wrtfttA f INTRODUCTION. tion of the points. This is portly explained, if the theory of Blo^ and others be right that we have here the draft of the speech as drawn in 336, emended by fresh suggestions in 330, and still Airther emended after the trial had actually taken place, and before publication. But also the regular divisiona of a speech are not well observed. The main body of it, the narratio el demomtratio, extends from § 13 to 176; and all the rest is, as Haas says, 'Epilogue in the widest senae of the terra'; yot from § 176 to 230 there are matters which more properly belong to the previous division, and technically the Epilogue does not begin until § 230. Finally, the peroration is unduly long, and weak- ened and spoilt by the final section. The following ia an outline of the aipiment and arrangement of the speech. 1 — 8 Fzooemlnm.

I will etaow you that the latter does not apply to this case^. 43 — 50.

This ia illegal because the law on the distiuolioQ of dp%ij and ivtiii^eui. He therefore aup- poses that an answer to a first objection originally stood here and was cut out.

Evidently the suspicion of Calliaa and his brother, for whom Domosthcnea at that time trying to obtain citizenship, is here a secondary view.

This paragraph cannot have been written earlier than 330.

Acschinea did not obtain the necessarj' Sfch part of the votes, and coosequently incurred the penalty of 1000 drachinaa It cannot be supposed that he or his frienda were unable to pay this sum (about £40) ; or that he would have refused to do so from mere contumacy. He had lost the power of ever bringing such an action again, and he must have felt that it was the end of his career aa an Athenian citizen ; and that it was better to live elsewhere. If ho could not persuade his fellow- citizens that he was right, when Alexander was in the full tide of his success, what would be his case if newa reached Greece that Aleiander were defeated or dead? He therefore detenoined, forfeiting hia citizenahip by non-pay- ment, to put himself immediately under the pratection of Alexander, He retired to Ephesua, from which town the road through Sardis to central Asia began, and waited for the return of the king. He was therefore not at Athens to witness his rival's disgrace aTid recall (b.c. 325 — 4). But we have no particulars of hia lift at Epheaus, either as to what he did, or on -what he hved, whether by teaching as after- wards at Ehodes, or on the bounty of the Jlacedonian king. \"We are only told that in the confusion which followed the deatli of Alexander he retired to Rhodes and there ' set up a school and taught,' not apparently a school of rhetoric, for he told the Bhodians that ho did not know the art of rhetoric, but a more elementary school'. Presently, for ' Plntarch, Dem. c. 21, says that he lived jrspi 'PoSoi' «b1 '\\asia,ii aoipiirriiur. Ho therefore probably gave paid lectures of some Bort. The assertion of the Peeudo-Plutarch, Vit. i Or. 313 n that he was the founder of the Bhodian school of oratory — To'pDS.aBoj- SiSntntaXttoutXiifl^^— isBmaaifeBtanachco- Jiism. The so-called Bhodiaa School does not seem to have been famous until aboat about b.c. 100, and at any rate it was the growth of the politicBl importniioe of Ehodes, which djd not begin until the time of the euccessors of Alexander. LAST YEARS OF AESCHINES. xlvii s of which we again know nothing, he left Ehiidea for Samoa, where he died in his 75th year (about b.c.314), nearly eight years after the death of Demoathenes'. The only anecdote of this portion of his life which we have ia that narrated in the biography of the Psoudo-Hutarch. ' He read/ we are told, ' to the Rhodians hia speech againat Otesiphon ; and when all his hearers expressed their aston- iahmcnt that he should have teen defeated after such a speech, he said : \" You would not be HUrprised if you had beard the reply of Demoathen'CB.\" ' The last hope, perhaps the last wish, of a return to Athena ended with the death of Alexander, Even if he haAi been by nature inclined to take an active part in politics, which seema not to have been the case, there was little in the state of things at Athena to tempt him to desire to return ; and he was pro- bably more content to follow his peaceful occupation in places where the 'Macedonian question' was no longer a cause of vehement debate or social division. Three ora- tions of hia have come down to us, the genuineneaa of which has not, as far as I know, been impugned. They all hear the stamp of the same mind, and have similar merits and defects. Of these the speech on the embassy is the most graphic and lively. The subject of that against Timarchua renders it revolting to modem readers ; hut it contains a good deal that is of interest, and ia expressed in clear and direct language. Tbat againat Cteaiphon ia the most laboured, but not to my mind as efiective as the de Falsa Legaticme. A fourth oration, Xoyot iijXiaicdt, was anciently in e.dstence, attributed to Aeschiues, but was early declared spurious. Aeachines was married to a daughter of Philodemus, son of Philon, and had two sona and one daughter.
