Estimate of auto situation - Comrade Dennis reporting. v The estimate of the G!1 settlement contained in the Labor Commission statement in the Daily World was not repeated, the reporter express- ing his agreement\" with it. Chrysler is trying to drive a harder bar- gain with the use of the large-scale lay-offs. They seem to want a strike so that compensation won't have to be paid. The union is say- ing there will be no strike benefits which looks like preparation for a cheap settlement. There is much ill feeling among the workers. The widening of the differential between younger workers during probationary period and the others is especially bad, encouraging the company to turn workers over quickly and\" to use this astdisciplinary weapon. In tool and die shops 60% are \"casual\" workers. There are letters of understanding, including one on absenteeism which are as enforceable as the contract; but the membership was unable to vote on them. ^There will be oven greater piling up of grievances as umpires now have a \"reasonable length of time\" to decide rather than a fixed 30 days. Reuther had consciously traded off deteriorated grievance procedures, production standards and safety, with the worst contract in _GM. There was a class collaborationist and not class struggle approach to the contract. There were no membership meetings 'til they wanted Local 160 to go back to work on pretext of anti-pollution work and the members rejected this. Tbey did hold some classes and a couple of demonstrations of retirees on '30 and out\" which was pretty safe but they avoided membership mobilization because they were afraid of the young militant workers in the shops. Ratification meetings wore held under duress, with the workers sold the argument it was 50 cents and their not having confidence the union would get them any more. Before, the union leadership was dominated by Reuther personnel and politics jbut even then it was a coalition. Taken as a whole /the leadership is class collaborationist but has various ideological cur- rents. On political action the role of leadership has been to snuff out independent action. There are socialist, social democratic and Trotskyist influences in leadership and also some plain trade union men, good and bad. In relation to Black workers the leadership is completely insensitive. Following the contract, the dog -fight for the Reuther machine will intensify. The development of the rank-and» file is crucial. The leadership can be moved as seen on the reversal on local settlements before the national contract. This time produc- tion workers got the biggest share of the pie and skilled workers did not have a contract veto. UAW history and structure^ among most democratic, with caucuses of all kinds being traditional. Gradually curbs on rank-and-file have de- veloped like monthly meetings no longer being mandatory. Older work- ers tend to support the leadership mainly because they see no alterna- tive and there* is none right now. 90% of the young and Black are anti-leadership and very dissatisfied with the union. There are leadership turnovers but to other older workers who are not too dif- ferent since there is no organic ti ion. Younger workerSjWhen it comes to the crunch are not anti-union and were active, in the strike. The League of Revolutionary workers was neutral toward the strike on grounds of a racist leadership but are not being followed. The coming local and national elections are crucial. There is dynamite in the situation but what kind of leadership will come in? If the elections are tied to a fight ot. shop conditions and contract enforcement and all progressives actually run for stewards and local office, results can be gotten for the workers. Some estimate was made of our strength in auto in Michigan. . During the strike we participated in efforts to\" build Black caucuses but with not much success on that or other rank- and-file forms. 2,000 papers were distributed weekly mainly at GM and in Flint and contacts wore made and some recruits should result from this with some time. The Daily World coverage was pretty good but not enough of it was in tho\"l?hursday paper which was used for distributions. This was considered a political question. z-c 12/2 j .._;; 2 The* .level of union coiQbiousness was not as high W it used to be and there was always the danger of an attempt\" to bring together anti-union and racist forces And attract \"some youth but it was considered that\" — ruling class tactics did not acll for a frontal attack on the union and that any such attack could be defeated without question. It would take a strong rank and file movement to compel leadership to fight hard on grievances and safety. Many grievances were washed out in the settlement. There is a real problem whether the workers' needs can be met on a one company at a time or piecemeal basis. : \" Pisher in Flint disbanded the plant, began truck production with a new work force so that workers after 100 day strike found themselves \\ without jobs. The steward who fights for the worker is in a precari- ous position. Forms of struggle need to be developed to meet these problems. , . The settlement was a mixed bag. It was not a defeat. UAW got what it could without a mobilization of membership. If you look at what the company was trying to do and the actual result, they did not suc- ceed in weakening the union or on the question of money even though the actual new money was really only about 6 cents, A 1-3/4 cents equalization fund for hard duty jobs is to be applied at the local \"\" level in a year from now. ■•.._. . It would not be good for a general union rank-and-file group to call for a rank and file caucus in auto. A group of auto workers could do so. The Daily World could have a spread on auto- if it dealt with the problems auto workers faced and avoided anything that would be sub- ject to attack as interference in the internal affairs of the union. A Party pamphlet could also be issued on auto if it exercised the same care in treatment. Rank-and-file movements should be organized around concrete issues of local grievances, health and safety, con- tract enforcement. Every comrade should organise a group around him- self or participate in an -existing meaningful caucus. Discussio n : There were those in our ranks who wanted to avoid any criticism of the union leadership because it is a center union. On the other hand, we should not put them in the same bag with Meany. The problem is to develop rank-and-file forms and struggles on prob- lems at the point of production. The big turnover hinders this. There are special problems in the union with regard to racism and the discouragement of Black workers from organizing. The leadership favors the skilled. The UAW did not give a program for the industry ' and our Party did not get its program very far off of paper and de- velop it. There is nov; a merciless productivity drive with no fear of the union. In Tarrytown firings took place right after the strike on framed up charges. We -need a more planned, long-range company and industry-wide approach. The attempt is not to break up the union but to take out its guts and leave a hollow shell. But there is a question of developing not only class consciousness but even trade union consciousness. Some felt that the* monopolies had really gotten just about what they wanted in the settlement, especially consider- ing that the money was less than, in previous settlements. There was a plan to sell the contract to the workers by the union. Here was a center leadership running interference for the company and it could do it more effectively than a more rightist union leadership. Some felt that a Woodcock could become in many ways even more effective and vicious than a Meany. . . ; - , . C onclusions : \" ' - ■ ' *'- . (I) Comrade Dennis to write a Pol i t i c al. Af fa I r s article along the lines of the report and discussion. {2\\ The auto commission is to prepare a plan for 1971 especially on what we are going to do to build a rank-and-file movement, including Black caucuses and what is to be done to build the Party.

Angela Davi s Dafej^p - Comrade Rubin reportiiA The report was on observations of the work in the 4 .West .Coast dis-„ tricts and by the Party in relation \"to the national defense office. It was intended .only as an opener to. get at possible policy questions. Comrade Rubin's, tour had ended December 21. Washington - The ap- proach is to build 50 community, shop and school committees to give it firm roots at base and bring them together for an even wider com- mittee than the original city-wide committee of mainly younger move- ment people, Black and white. In number of pieces and quality, some of the best literature was produced there, A top district committee keeps' on top of work. There is a need simultaneously with building of the 50 committees to reach leading personalities and existing or- ganiztions. Oregon - For small district a good beginning committee with peace and religious forces, high school students, some actions, and literature. Weakness is with respect to Black community ^but it is beginning to be overcome. Northern California - Prior to the extradition, actions had been held and meetings with an area-wide committee and at least beginning committees in- 41 counties with sub- stantial numbers of Black and white, mainly movement type youth in- volved. There was the problem of Organizational inexperience and at that time lack of materials from the national defense office that led to a certain groping for direction and activity. It was decided to bring some additional forces into play to guarantee drawing in broadaz personalities and groups with Comrade Mickey to play important role directly. One of problems hero and elsewhere was that of older white forces with certain kinds of broad contacts working properly with the younger Black forces in leadership and accepting their leadership. Southern California - The National Office has had problem of being both the national office and the local office. In several communities the Party initiated coaraaittees and the National Office stimulated an artists committee, UCLA professors committee. A number of actions were held. The names of personality-type sponsors within the 1 mil- lion sponsors were quite limited in breadth and where they came from - almost exclusively from Southern California, New York and broadest from Michigan with a few each from Connecticut, New England, Eastern Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Colorado and South. There were probably more not turned in. List of committees in country was also most limited, almost exclusively to what we initiated and none in a dozen states where we have some Party organization but probably come existed, that the office did not have. The number of sizable financial contribu- tions was also quite limited, though the total income was a significant start. . _ ~\" - National Office and Committee was mainly younger Black militants with a handful of white movement type youth all relatively inexperienced but good people. Older whites tended to serve as technicians) give some advice but not an on-going working part of organization, reflect- ing both their own weaknesses and problems of approach to drawing them in. There was a need to try and draw in some of the broader sponsors and not assume none would do more than lend their names and to set them in motion in own circles in building related expressions. A Party Committee of Franklyn and Kendra Alexander, Lou Diskin and \"Dorothy Healey was established responsible to the District Board and through it to the National Party Defense Committee and the Political Committee. Discussions were held in this committee of how to help the mass defense and its organization develop with the knowledge that our ideas would not necessarily be completely accepted by the mass organizations. Ideas came up for an office manager and for an ad- ministrator to coordinate activity of the committees and assure ef- ficiency in servicing committees around the country and getting the material o **. « The problem of how to guarantee continual development of the campaign) wa3 discussed. Ideas included: The delivery of the sponsor sig- natures as each high point in numbers was reached, birthday parties for Angela, January 26th in a couple of cities, Madison Square Garden type reallies with major cultural figures in 5 or 6 cities all on the same week with preparation of a film from them {in a few months) , street actions around the time of extradition, development of forms and committees for expression of special interest groups, etc. Dates of the court procedure would also provide a certain development. It was agreed that in order to relieve some of the burden from Los Angeles and make use of the best ties and talents around the country, com- mittees in different cities should be asked to take responsibility for developing some special forms for expression country-wide of a par- ticular interest group that they would initiate, making use of their -£*>; own contacts and those of the Los Angeles office. Committees in' the • following- places would be asked to take- the~following areas of nation- al responsibility: Labor - Chicago; political action figures - Detroit: Black v/omeri - Hew York; Church - New York and Chicago and Los Angeles together; professors - Southern and Northern California; Cultural - Los Angeles and New York, same on lawyers, International - New York. Students and Youth - get thinking of YWLL. With respect to the idea of a number of broad co-chairmen nationally together with Henry Winston, there seemed to be some resistance but then agreement to go ahead with the earlier decision. A number of key problems emerged on the trip: \" ; 1.= The level of sentiment, individual expressions and potential was \"much beyond the level of organization. The proposals, including those on how to develop from one stage to another and not dissipate ;do not .yet fully answer this. \" - 2. Party mobilization is uneven; Big 'spontaneous reaction by our membership and League but without sufficient depth of understanding\" except on part of relatively few to- guarantee continued high level of activity by really large sections of membership. The lack of under- standing is on the objective importance of the case to the whole re- lationship of forces arid fight to block the\" path to the right. The ruling class has made it a test. It cannot be aside from\" the mass work and tasks of everyone^ no matter where they are and far from being a task on the side .has the- potential of being one of the power- ful avenues through which the coalition against war, racism and re- pression will be built. 3. There are various kinds of narrowness reflected in \"different places. Some were mentioned. Also fears of drawing in broader forces on grounds that the proper political line of defense might be lost and attempts to draw all forms directly under the one committee rather than cooperating efforts. Tendencies to be too afraid of criticism from the left. There is hesitancy to make anyone but the prosecutor in the case the target for- demands and not to include Reagan and Nixon on grounds they are too reactionary to be influenced; and left will hit us on this. Tendencies to skirt both the issue of innoccence on grounds of not wanting to be in a defensive posture and the question of whether a victory \"can be won in the courts, tenden- cies to over-stress the content of Angela's ideas and thereby the danger of slipping into that, as the overall basis of defense, avoid- ing any expression of disagreement with Jonathan's actions even with- in identification with his aspirations, ^8ome of these questions seemed to, be holding up the basic, brochure. U^u^t ^^vy*^<^^*^^ /aAAX ^ M ^fX 4. On finances, over $200;000 will be needed for the legal aspects aloneand the enemy is spreading the lie that funds will be misused. To got around this and make it easier to raise such money, perhaps an unassailable separate legal fund is needed. . Frahklyn reported on the status of the Los Angeles office and dis- cussed the political questions in extended remarks. The work of the office is beginning to move forward. The statement for 1 million sponsors is out and Abt's speech' in L03 Angeles. At the time of the extradition actions were held including a Christmas Vigil of 500 in .Northern Colifbrnia. There have been many problems including that of being both national and local committee and now need to have an extension of the national office in the Bay Area.\" A big problem in the office is stationery. Need is for travelling and a real mass media approach with a press bureau. The attornies which are how public were reported on. On the Co-Chairmen there was the problem of whether they would be honorary or play some role and who could be gotten for what. Letters had now gone out to several with' the re- quest to become such. Muhammed Ali is now a sponsor. .Comrade Alexander felt it was not true that there were concessions to leftist pressure. He also felt that to direct demands, to Nixon and' Reagan in addition would be to take away from confidence in winning the case. Mobilisation of masses of people can free her, not just an outcry. At the N.C. he felt he may have alienated some with how he put it; but felt Jonathan was handled one-sidedly which hamper- ed us from doing battle. It was put in moral and* psychological terms and we didn't deal with the absence of a mass movement that Jonathan could see would free political prisoners. It is not pos- sible to receive a fair trial but we will exhaust the court system. The only thing, though, that can free her is the action of the masses. There is a need for mfjb experienced cadre all oS and nationally * and to be able to see open Party people in this struggle^ He felt * ». ..the Legal. Defense -Fund idea- would -be good. -He reported on Eldredgc - Cleaver's attack on the Party as using Angela and doing the work of the pig. The Party needed to take this on publicly. The Defense Committee should ask the Panthers to state whore they now stand on the defense. Actions are needed for January 5 opening of pre-trial. A hundred people of means should be gotten to say now they* will stand bail for Angela, General discussion . The sentiment and potential already exhibited was tremendous ant\" we had to raise our level of leadership to it and help organize it on the broadest possible basis. While trying to build the national and local defense committees themselves as broad as possible we had to set in motion broader forces that would not express themselves directly through the committees. Even broader sugr* gostions were made for possible co-chairman along with Comrade Winston. The concensus was that it was necessary to direct the fire not only at the prosecutor but also at Reagan and Nixon. No one would understand that the prosecutor alone was responsible. for the frame-up. The concensus also was that we had to be careful not to give rise to the idea that it was impossible to win at the trial court level. Experience at the trial court level in the Smith Act, etc. did not rule it out or if not won there , that it could not be won on appeal or by clemency and therefore open up other kinds of speculation and pessimism. Left on their own the courts will not provide a fair trial but there is already mass pressure and it will be much more. We will need to deepen Party consciousness on a continuous basis and keep it on all our agendas. What is being built is a movement and not just a committee. Pull page ads of personalities are needed and many broad forms The world movement and role of the parties is the best ever and we must find ways to use it here. It is clear the Panthers have dropped the issue of Angela. We need a piece of materi- al in the name of the Party for mass distribution on the struggle. There is now greater clarity on differences of approach and narrowing of differences which should make it easier \"to got the materials and work needed faster. Finances for the legal aspects are an emer- gency question now. There is the possibility of getting a national student strike based on major youth and student organizations support- ing it. The rank-and-file movement is putting out a mass piece of literature ^ for unionists. Ideas on cultural figures who have spoken out, reaching into church circles and the Black press were discussed. The need for a fund raiser was stressed. The League has made it its foremost activity but often lacks experience in the broadest ways of working. Alongside the grpundswell of support has been much evidence of the influence of red-baiting and of the CRus's in the Black community. There has been a problem of this kind in the Black women's group and in getting co-chairman of the New York Committee with Comrade .Mitchell. Some of the community meetings in New York were reported and the development among cultural figures including an affair with them for February 2. A regional meeting of the defense organisation is taking place January 9th for the Bast and after similar meetings elsewhere, there will be a national meeting. There is a New York Student Committee. The Defense Commission has hot been giving suf- ficient leadership to the work and we need to develop a planned work approach by the Party, including on personnel, with the commissions answering the Org. Bureau in writing what they plan to do and the question of personnel for it. The fight has to be made for Comrade Angela Davis to have the right to have her own ideology. Comrade Dennis reported on the activity in Michigan which was among the broadest, involving top trade union, Black community, NAACP, forces and elected officials. An effort was being prepared by some of the boldest forces to press the NAACP Convention on the question. The \" main approaches arc to shop workers with the aim of gradually building up to short stoppages. With respect to answering Cleaver, there were some questions of form, treatment and place of answering him that were referred to the Black Liberation Commission. Othe r Conclusions : (1) The reports wore approved with the Org. Bureau asked to work out with the Defense Commission a plan for the work of the Party, including the setting up of a committee to write the Party piece of material on the question (2) Comrades Patterson and Johnson were asked to work on initiation of a legal defense fund.

The trip was viewed by the staff of the Teonle's World and my J'arty collective as an inpbrtant political event which would be critical in building nass contacts among working journalists and the loft press. It was also seen as the catalyst for fonning a left wing journalists organization in the ?ay Area. i, Wo have some cadre in the working press area, but because of the nature of the industry and the placement of the cadre, it nroved to be almostsia impossible to build a rank and file caucus. •WH5© 2 W m ; V'; •-- *«*»*. th. c^,, inoludls;r ^ _ not ^^ ianu V V© have boon nolo *n -i «<«■»-* > over tho Wlltos o? atl&oJS.rgfr ^ loa * «« Protoats ohoflm ao one of tho four ronr^«+«+? ■ Rulw 2 3ala *ao« I was : fwnnon for J?eac« >rh™7«+!t! ^ ft J lvoa °* *»<* Bay Area . ! novnrcen , as w «' \", fSSSTLS? * * ovor «0 workiag i oondon**, the mii n ^^\\^f^ d e ^e„co. ta Th 9 . fl t at e,ent « o«r ™i« e „^ST «Srtoa B t^S r ln T itln « artlc ^ for ' eonierenoo on vonen, mTtal ?„ JJ Tx>caX on ou * union < 8 vlth other K ?uild r,«tr^. ?he tI^T 0008 ' ^ «Wwd»ta& , owning tho Kqu«i Rights teena-Mnt^* ?° on renoVd lV *\"«f Guild.* cun^rt g ^\"** ~ rtearito tho Jtaoricwi ' « bas:« iin3 cono in^i^L« convoy to you that tho \"***\"£« w» $J JSrSfffis: *o1 r L;t 8 of is* ,* 1 ? to ~* -*» ' totwyitt in the trip And otiSt» th^f 1 ac * ivi *i<* to build ■: . -^^^^^ -t 7 : ««>ni^7ii» whon I returned? a *-**oles about Cuba nnd only 'S«S2 e ?SrS C SSSSrt^J n ° that ' «A«ioaHy, tho ' wr******, wouldn't be ^afj 1 ^\"^ &\"\"»* **** so™ > d«Ipfl.tj; , n , . ,,X '\" tcd in * U othpl - *«»** «clud«d *»a tho curront \"be ■b7C I I vas selected by the Chicano press, f~ I b6 I I ftn ono of the best know find widely read <JI writers- b7c organizers.

It i3 not incensitivity, but crass mas male supremacy and I am critical of it for that. KLense forward my criticisms and comments to the awrowiate bodies.

These policies have found a more clear T echo in the Nixon Administration. f There are shifts in the tactical policies that these forces follow. The shifts in the tactical policies are reflections of the resistance and the problems that they face in carrying out their reactionary policies. For example, they followed one tactical policy from the begin- ning of the Nixon administration through the 1970 elections. This was based on demagogy around the troop withdrawals from Vietnam while expanding the war into Cambodia. The Nixon Asia policy, as it applied in the \"Vietnamineation\" of the aggres- sion in Vietnam, has now become much clearer. It is a policy of putting greater stress on the organization, financ- ing and leading of national armed forces, the greater use of smaller para-military groups directed by the CIA. This activity is designed to take place under a canopy of massive U.S. air power. The troop withdrawal tactic was related to this shift in U.S. policies. Until the elections a domestic policy was based on putting some breaks on the inflation by cutting living standards, more taxes on the poor, cuts in govern- ment spending, in housing, road building and all social welfare projects. These policies added to and speeded up the crisis development in the economy. These economic -2- I., i policies were coupled by the line of sharp attacks on all liberals and progressives and the attempt to create an atmosphere of hysteria. It was these tactical policies that received a setback in the 1970 elections* The electorate, but especially the, working class, the Black Americans, overwhelmingly voted against these policies. The 1970 elections vere a shock to these forces. Now there is some readjustment. The Nixon ad- ministration has moved to deficit government spending, to easier credit and money policies. This is a confession that capitalism cannot function without the artificial governmental economic stimulation. Cut these steps have created new pressures. Inflation has been given a new stimulant. Therefore, prices and taxes will go up. The new moves to expand the aggression in Indochina has set off a new wave of mass resistance to these policies. ■During the Cambodian invasion the mass upheaval forced the Administration to agree not to use ground troops in Cambodia and Laos. Because of the defeats the forces of South Vietnam have suffered in Laos; this has created a new dilemma for the Administration. It is generally an accepted conclusion that while U.S. imperialism militarily and even economically could » continue the aggression in Vietnam — that politically it cannot. The political situation in the United States is ',m igo-134637 W \" *9 ] ■ 1 such that any long-tern continuation would create political ' T explosions.- Therefore, what is new is that the internal political pressures are beginning to build up measurably. This is by far the most important factor propelling the withdrawal of troops from Indochina. The Nixon Ad- ministration would like to reverse or halt this process. ,But it is a very difficult thing to do because of the political situation. The 1970 elections, in this sense, left some very deep political tracks that will last for some ' time. It seems to me the U.S. -Saigon dilemma is shortly going to reach some very decisive turning points. On the one hand, it is almost impossible for the Nixon Administra- tion to postpone for very long the pull-out of at least U.S. ground troops. There will come a point when the puppet government in Saigon will be forced to consider alternatives to the present course. The defeats in Laos have greatly added 1 to the dilemma that they face. Amongst the alternatives will be the consideration of some form of coalition in government. Of course, we cannot dismiss the possible alternative of overcoming the dilemma by provacative and 'irresponsible action including the invasion of North Vietnam. But there is no question that the situation is headed for a critical point. ->*- NX' 100-13^637 ' W ■ U.S. — Soviet Relations ~\" ,T It- seems that the basic policies of U.S. imperial- ism continues (1) to make no basic concessions or agreements on any real substantial questions, but (2) to continue to build an image that the Nixon Administration is \"negotiating\". What their policy says is that agreements are not possible or necessary but it is important policy in the United States to keep the dialogue going with the Soviet Union. The fact that the Nixon Administration is forced to try to keep an image of \"reasonableness\" and \"negotiations\" with the Soviet Union is a reflection of the basic political moods of the people of the United States. The U.S. policy towards the events in Chile is the same as the Nixon Asia policy. To get either Chilean ■i or some other Latin American ground forces under the cover of a U.S. air armada, to move against the government of Chile. It is this same policy that the U.S. follows in the Mid East — the ground troops are of Israel, but the weapons and, es- pecially the air forces, are U.S. Regarding the U.S. policy towards China, it pushes the same policy which is that whatever fits into its anti- Soviet policy plans are acceptable. About questions related to the popular image of the Soviet Union in the United States. Contrary to past periods, the Soviet Union is not considered the aggressor nor an immediate threat by any section of the people of the United States. It is generally seen as a stable, firm ~c 'u* 160-13*637 reasonable state. This does not mean that masses do not accept many of the anti-Soviet falsehoods that are being spread. There are some rather serious emotional reactions in Jewish circles. The reactionary circles have been able to use the nationalism that has emerged as a result of the question of Israel. There is no question that Zionism as it influences Jewish nationalism, has emerged as a serious handle for imperialism, 'She- broader Jewish circles the question- of Jews in the Soviet Union is very much a secondary issue. This has been and remains a very difficult situation, especially for Jewish communists because there is the very high wave of Jewish nationalism. On this question it would seem to me that the reactions of the Jews in' the Soviet Union to this campaign in the imperialist countries is too little, too late and in too low a key. Silence by Jews in the Soviet Union is used very effectively by the reactionary forces in the United States. From here it generally seems that there should be a quicker and more dramatic response to the lies and propaganda in the United States. There is a very specific area in this ideological struggle that- I want to mention. For some time the imperialist propaganda machine has worked overtime in creating ,...y ' the image that the Soviet Union is not now a working class state, that it does not relate to questions of the class struggle in the capitalist world* Of course, t^e Maoist propaganda has been very helpful in promoting this U.S. imperialist falsehood. A word about the cultural exchange programs. There is, of course, the special problems now because of the attacks by the extremist elements in the Zionist movement. The cancellation of the Bolshio Ballet tour in the U.S. because of these attacks on Soviet cultural figures, I think V/as well understood by broad sections of the American people. Frankly, I think it had a good effect. But there are some other problems about the cultural exchange. Workers and the poor simply do not have, money to pay for the high priced tickets which are charged as Soviet Cultural figures appear. Therefore, inadvertently, it creates the image that this is an operation that only the high or the middle class can see. I really don't know what to suggest, but if the promoters of these events in the U.S. would be asked to consider performances either promoted by some trade Unions or people's organizations — it, might be of help in this situation. There is a general question of the propaganda battle that' goes on between the two world systems. We have a general problem, in that much of * the material from the Socialist countries does not reach broad masses. The polemics that are very good don't reach masses. There is much good material that is published but they are not getting to broader masses. It is my opnion that this is not an insurmountable problem. There are ways by which mr 100-13^637 • • ■ W much of this can be corrected. But I must say that much •. r of the cadre involved either do not understand the need to reach broader masses cr,in some cases, don't care* These are questions around which 'some discussions should ;take place . One of the areas of tremendous interest now in the U.S. is the question of environment. The pollution of the environment. There are millions of young people who are now seriously concerned whether the human race can survive because of the environmental problem, if capitalism continues as the social system! The placement of the fundamental position of the Soviet Union, in pro- tecting and guarding the environment can have some very deep-going effects in the United States. There is more concern about this question than possibly any other question in the United States now.\" -8- w NY 100-134637 \"Comrade Gus Hall has asked me to convey to you the following thought in addition to the enclosed memorandum: He is sorry he cannot, at such short notice, fulfill your specific request for an analysis of public attitudes in our country regarding United States - USSR relations.

He may go to Moscow for a week or ten days before the beginning of the Congress. Further, he may make his trip to Czechoslovakia before attending the Soviet Congress. ^Regarding this Congress, GUS HALL and HENRY WINSTON, National Chairman of the CPUSA, have agreed that the CPUSA delegation will consist of GUS and ELIZA BETH HALL, HENRY and FERN WINSTON, and I I b\" if o I I b7C HALL and WINSTON have also reached an understanding that WINSTON will do some international traveling after the 24th Congress of the CPSU. Sometime in April, 1971, there is to be a big PAUL ROBESON celebration in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) . It has been decided to send HENRY WINSTON to represent the CPUSA at this celebration. A short while later, there is to be a Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party and WINSTON, accompanied by SIMON GERSON, will make up the CPUSA delegation. JAMES JACKSON, Chairman of the International Affairs Department,, CPUSA, returned from a trip to Venezuela just a few days ago.

HARRIS was then getting ready for a vacation of a week to ten days in London, England.^ As a result of this visit, HALL formed the opinion that HARRIS is growing away from the CPUSA. HALL believes that HARRIS has come into some new money from his family and is keeping this fact from .the CPUSA leadership. HALL stated that he gained this impression by the way HARRIS is acting and by ,the fact that he has noticed a number of things in the home of HARRIS which were not there before. It should be noted that the fact that HALL is suspicious of HARRIS does, not mean that it is true that he is growing away from the CPUSA. It could be Just that HARRIS is beginning to look after himself more than he used to. HALL also noted that the feud. between himself and HENRY WINSTON, National Chairman of the CPUSA, is continuing and is even sharper than before. HALL remarked that JAMES JACKSON, Chairman of the International Affairs Department, CPUSA, is OK on theoretical matters. But when it comes to a decision, if there is a black person involved, JACKSON is just as much a nationalist as the other black Party leaders.

This was a national school and took place with no connection with* the Illinois District of the Party. Although this was a national school, it is customary to contact the local district leader- ship and perhaps even invite some district leaders to speak before the school. However, in the case of this school, no one contacted the district, even though some leading people from the National Office of the CPUSA were conducting the school, including l [ a member of the National Committee, CPUSA/ KLING indicated he is going to complain b7c about this to the National Office, CPUSA. KLING then discussed the behavior of those in attendance at this school. He stated they behaved very badly. Housing was provided for these young people in the homes of Party people and these youths apparently messed things up pretty badly. They did not even treat these people like comrades. KLING said it finally dawned on him that since the school was coming to an end last week, perhaps the district ought to hold a party or supper for the students. In this way, people in the district could meet these young people and the youths could be introduced to some district leaders as well as to some national leading people in the Party- KLIN G contacted the National fiff^o *vf tu CPUSA and | | bo I l agreed to bear 50% of the b7C cost, as a result, the supper for the youths was held. KLING was chairman for the affair and insisted that CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT speak. KLING introduced LIGHTFOOT not only as the Illinois District Chairman but also as a national leader and a leader with an international reputation. It was a good affair although it did not do away with the shortcomings of the school ♦ On February 9, 1971, there was a meeting in the dis- trict headquarters to discuss this affair for the youth at /3t/-9//l- the national school. Among those pres ent for thi« fUg^ icc^n '22j2 were JACK KLING, CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT,\" and | P I T (fre\" 33<$°^ of the factors discussed was the fact tnat| „.iraEX£tt ,. hlZ young trade union active, who should have been &£n^totjf£&#*&s IMsAIa - i - ! ?zB$j\\mv}fo 1 fBl — NEW YORK /n ffl/ not there, KLING Indicated that he could not underst and JKhxJ J was not there.

He went into a rage and attacked KLING, accusing KLING of white chauvinism. He said the reason KLIKG preferre dl lis ber ausp KLING an d other s ■haYfi hftftn. gunning for i 1 a Negro, and l T II is living witft l L KLING was shocked and asked UGHTFOOT if he was accusing him of white chauvin- j£fiL — LTfiHTFfinT. replied that he was. LIGHTFOOT also accused b/c I . I of white chauvinism bpnaiisA of her attitude toward \\ I and I I and because she had previously reported some drunk and disorderly conduct by some black comrades. LIGHTFOOT also brought up the subject of a letter he had received from HERB WRIGHT, a former district leader, who had accused every white leader in the district of white chauvinism. KLING has a copy of WRIGHT'S letter to be given to GUS HALL, General Secretary, CPUSA, who is also to show it to WINSTON. LIGHTFOOT has misplaced his copy of the letter so WINSTON has not seen it yet. KLING said he was stunned by this attack by LIGHTFOOT. KLING said he is going through hell with the antics of LIGHTFOOT. Although nominally the leader of the district, LIGHTFOOT Just does what he pleases. KLING also had a disagreement with LIGHTFOOT con- cerning the fire that had destroyed the CP-rented quarters at Madison and Central, Chicago, the site of the new Marxist school which LIGHTFOOT intended to open. LIGHTFOOT wanted to make a public charge that the \"enemy\" had burned the place down because it was being used by communists. KLING finally was able to calm LIGHTFOOT down by persuading him that if he made this charge, no other landlord would rent to him. KLING then displayed a letter that LIGHTFOOT had sent out soliciting sponsors and donations for his new school, KLING stated this letter is \"atrocious.\" LIGHTFOOT originally stated that he wanted this to be a broad school with hundreds of people from all political areas as sponsors. - 2 - The letter which UGHTFOOT sent out contained a list of sponsors, 90% of whom are members of the CP and the rest are Black Panthers, The content of the letter itself is horrible from a communist point of view, said KLING. These people have embraced the ELDRIDGE CLEAVER concept that the CPUSA defense of ANGELA DAVIS is a sell-out to the government. According to KLING, LIGHTFOOT sent this letter out to all the CP of Illinois clubs without even showing it to the leadersh ip of the d istrict. The only person he show ed it to was l I who is LIGHTFOOT 1 s bo | this project. KLING said he just cannot hlC control xnis situation at all. district leadership. Then, he talks to people like[~ if; o KLING stated that LIGHTFOOT keeps coming up with a new harebrained scheme everyday. He recounted that LIGHTFOOT c ame to a meeting of tht> nt atript Board with a letter from I I who is in prison in West Germany, a^nugpri of assaulting several people. LIGHT- FOOT sald l I needs a defense and belie ves the Party should send FU>RY to West Germany to help l 1 LIGHTFOOT brought this up before the Board and as a result the Board members pledged $150 toward such a fund. KLiEG*_ b/C himself, had to promise to give LIGHTFOOT $50 for the I 1 fund. Since KLINGLdid_nx>t have this kind of money, he was given $100 for th e| | fund, $50 of which KLING could say .came from him. KLING remarked that it now looks as if LIGHTFOOT is not going to leave the district and go to New York City permanently until next May or June, rather than this month, as it appeared earlier. Yet, at the same time, LIGHTFOOT keeps determining policy on his own without consult ing the b' and tells them what to do. This puts KLING in a difficult b7C position because he cannot very well tell such people that LIGHTFOOT is wrong without starting a real argument with LIGHTFOOT. KLING also has problems with l I who is organizing in the district for the unemployment action in Washington during April, 1971. KLING does not agree with HALL on this action at all because it is too close to the May-June peace actions. KLING sa id that] fr ants to quit b€ his p resent job in the district. I r raid KLING that j^ I I wants to be a district organizer in either Wisconsin or Cleveland__Qhio. He thinks I I would like the Job in Cleveland because L^Lhas— a-j girl friend there.

I I would probably feeO-he-was demoted if b he was sent there. KLING feels that| | would not be b7C adverse to taking the position of district organizer in Chicago. ' KLING then discussed a recent art i^if* whi^h anoftarqH in the \"Chicago Defender\" in which l 1 I denies any connection with the FBI and charges that he knows who the informer is who turned in ANGELA DAVIS and that he will make his charg e public soon. There is some suspicion that I \"H * s tne informer, so much so that when I I of f ered some money to the be Party, even to LIGHTFOOT, they were afraid to take it. ^q ISHMAEL FLORY finally took the m oney for the defense of ANGELA DAVIS.

HENRY WINSTON and OSCAR BROWN had agreed, that a big campaign should be started In Chicago to get blacks into television. This idea originated with BROWN. They felt this would be a worthwhile project, would get mass support, and would be a feather in the cap of the CP. It was decided to set up a committee for this proje ct which would include CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT, JACK KLING, and l I \"Muhammad Speaks.\" LIGHTFOOT woul d be in ch arge of mobilizing this p roject and should go and see | I However, at that point, I \\ had some problems with his leg and had to go into the hospital, so no one went to see him. Subsequently, WINSTON began to put some pressure on K LING, so K LING got LIGHTFOOT to take s ome blacks and go see l I However, when they talked to I I they discussed everything except the TV project. WINSTON continued to put pressure on KLING and KLING told WI NSTON to t alk to LIGHTFOOT about it, KLING later learned that l I did agree to this project and a narrow committee has been set up composed mostly of communists and a few artists. KLING indicated that he has a suspicion that when WINSTON recontacted LIGHTFOOT about this project, be probably told LIGHTFOOT that KLING said LIGHTFOOT had not done anything on the project, and this may have been what made LIGHTFOOT blow up at him. KLING then mentioned the question of a letter that b6 b7C b6 | had sent out to some people on the subject of tne jews in Russia. The Party had originally blamed ABE FEINGLASS b7 ° - 4 - for initiating this letter. Because of this suspicion, a number of people, including JACK SPIEGEL, went to see FEIN- GLASS and confronted him. FEIN GLASS told them that he does not agree with the CP on the subject of Israel but he had nothing frn do .with that letter. He sug gested that all go to see l I which they did. I I told the m the letter was not his idea. FEINGLASS challenged ! l and asked why he ha d not to ld anyone about this letter before it was sent out. | | explained that the letter had been prepared by some social democrats in a Jewish labor organization in Chicago, and he had merely signed it. KLING stated that some people are getting ready to send an open letter to b6 I [ demanding to know why he would send out a letter b7C like that when he claims to be in favor of better relations with the Soviet Union, to be against the war in Vietnam, and other similar positions. Then KLING stated that a new Martin Luther King Commemoration Co mmittee has been se t up. Th e chairman of this commit tee is l l and f [ is treasurer. I \"H and JESSE JACKSON are honorary cnair- men. This committee is planning some action for April 3 and 4, 1971, KLING was very enthusiastic about this new committee which he believes has great possibilities. KLING stated that this committee is much broader than the National Coalition Against War, Racism, and Repression. KLING then raised the problem of finances in the Illinois District of the Party, He recalled that the district used to get from $800 to $1,000 per ye"
