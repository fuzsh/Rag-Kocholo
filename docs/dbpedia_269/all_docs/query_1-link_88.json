        "text": "Thank you so much for this thread!\n\nFor me, this is probably the most favorite performance by Alexei. Though he did not win World title, I love this one, more than his OGM-winning The Man in the Iron Mask. He shows so much emotion. He lost SP (3rd place), so was ON FIRE.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rwy-pNScPA4\n\nWas that 3A-half loop-3S? or -3F? What a 'gorgeous' combination! Who else can do that among the current crops of skaters? Hanyu. And Aaron, maybe.\n\nI also love Alexei's speed while doing Circular Step and Straightline Step Sqs, which I miss under CoP rules these days.\n\nOff topic: I often love watching performances in the Free of those who made mistakes in SP or who got lowbelled in SP unfortunately. Because they are ON FIRE. e.g. Gracie at 2013 US Nats and Dai at Japanese Nats come to my mind.\n\nWhat I'd love to see is the BESP version of Yagudin's 2002 Oly's FS - I remember it as this amazing moment - one of my favourite skating moments ever - and then I found some, I believe, American commentator-vid of it where they basically came across as saying that it was so-so - I believe they used the word \"conservative\", for instance. Also, they didn't seem sure that he had won, and I remember not one vestige of doubt about it... What a weird feeling... So, if anyone's seen a BESP vid, please post it! (Oh, how I mourn having lost the BESP commentary! I want it baaaaaaack - but, sorry, I digress... )\n\nDo you remember what cheesefest it was where Alexei skated with two real knives ?\n\nThis one, doris?! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnxkMvBq7w4\n\nAt Sears Open 2001. Wow, 3F, 3A and 3S while holding two knives!\n\nLoved his step sequences!\n\nOff topic: personally I still wanted that Joubert would have kept his previous Free 'The Inception', but after watching this, it's understandable and forgivable that Brian dropped it and wanted to go for 'Gladiator'.\n\nWhat was the best version of Gladiator, do you think?\n\nMy favourite Gladiator was Alexei's performance at 2000 Trophee Lalique: http://youtu.be/yG3fQXgQVK0\n\nThe performance is nowhere near clean, but the intensity, the passion, and the abandon that Alexei skated with in especially in the second half of the program is just staggering.\n\nAs for a lesser-known Alexei program, I really liked his Broken Arrow LP as well: http://youtu.be/4Qtl44YyBEc\n\nI thought Broken Arrow was quite an interesting program and I'm sad that he dumped it for Tosca at 2000 Worlds.\n\nThank you so much for this thread!\n\nFor me, this is probably the most favorite performance by Alexei. Though he did not win World title, I love this one, more than his OGM-winning The Man in the Iron Mask. He shows so much emotion. He lost SP (3rd place), so was ON FIRE.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rwy-pNScPA4\n\nI read somewhere that Yagudin did a move in his 2001 worlds version of Gladiator, a move that is not allowed in formal competitions. They said he did it for the Canadian audience who had supported him all along. Does anyone know what's the move called? Is there any specific term?\n\nSorry if this is off topic or it doesn't intest you but I though it is interesting.\n\nFlorent is training with Alexei Yagudin!\n\nYou are currently training with Alexei Yagudin in Courchevel. How is that working out for you?\n\nI suffer every single day. He teaches me so much. I feel honored to have the opportunity to work with him, when very few athletes have done it in the past. I enjoy every minute of it and I seize this wonderful opportunity and make the best of it, in order to be ready for 2014.\n\nPart of the interview from Figure Skating Magazine.\n\nIs there a good source of a summary which describes what Yagudin has been up to during the years since Salt Lake? He has had quite obvious opportunities to go in many different directions, and am wondering what exciting paths he has passed through. Thank you.\n\nI read somewhere that Yagudin did a move in his 2001 worlds version of Gladiator, a move that is not allowed in formal competitions.
