        "text": "The View is the only platform by and for women in the justice system with lived experience. We are the survivors of trauma and state-endorsed violence. Women also experience the worst effects of the climate crisis, including war, famine and rape. Increasingly eco-activists are being incarcerated indefinitely for peaceful protest. We stand with our suffragette sisters. Women are treated unfairly by the justice system, whether as women who have committed a crime or as victims. We work with women using art to reclaim their stories and reframe their future. Join our community’s vision for a world where women are celebrated, respected and treated with love and dignity – a world where every woman matters.\n\nIn this edition of The View, we celebrate some of the most courageous and inspiring women of our time, some well-known, some less so. Women who have built feminist funding platforms. Women who have left a billion-dollar endowment to benefit women medical students in NYC.\n\nThis is the world we want to live in. These are the women that we want to know. The women whose legacy and sisterhood leave an indelible mark, like a kiss, of love and solidarity.\n\nHere is a peak into issue 11:\n\nBeyond Breaking News – The Unbroken Indrani Mukerjea retells her traumatic and life-changing experience in prison to Utkarsha Kesarkar.\n\nIn today’s social media-driven world, it’s easier than ever to obsess over unrealistic body expectations seen and heard on social media, Tilly Fawcett writes It’s MY Body!\n\nLEANNE’S STORY AT THE SMILEY CHARITY FILM AWARDS\n\nThe View Magazine is a Community Interest Company (CiC) that is a feminist human rights multi-media platform. We advocate for all women who have been in contact with the justice system, whether as women in conflict with the law or women who have been victims of crime and are traumatized by the failures of agencies meant to keep us safe.\n\nWe believe that women in prison and serving their license in the community must be heard and that the issues that affect them need to be highlighted. We know that change can only come from within, by women who have been affected by that system.\n\nFounded by 3 incarcerated women the quarterly magazine embodies their challenges within the system that institutionally retraumatizes its inmates rather than rehabilitates. The View pays for contributions from women in the criminal justice system, which showcases their art, prose, and poetry to encourage them to own their narratives and tell their stories in their own words. You can subscribe here.\n\nWe pay our women artists half the proceeds from sales of merchandise from the art they have created that you can see in our online shop here that we sell across England and Ireland at art fairs and pop-ups and online and in our soon-to-open shop on Caledonian Road.\n\nThe work The View recognises that women in prison often have complex mental health needs. Almost £500m a year is spent on prison health care contracts and about £150m on mental health care, so why are women not receiving the treatment they deserve? Self-inflicted deaths are 8.6 times more likely in prison than in the general population and 70% of people who died from self-inflicted means whilst in prison had already been identified as having mental health needs.\n\nThe View generates profits from commercial sales of the magazine, and art that may be reinvested into much-needed advocacy and employment and skills programs for women and children who have suffered violence and trauma, as well as research into the systemic issues behind the inequality faced by women in the criminal justice system that will lead to real, meaningful criminal justice reform.\n\nVote for The View!\n\nPrison notecards"
