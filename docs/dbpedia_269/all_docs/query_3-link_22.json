Night coming ou, tfitgr were for dqNirtinff, when wo gave them a knife and aa oM coat each, with which they were much pleated, and in?it«d ua by tigni to go on ihore along with them. On the lSUi» we were near Porto Lcgurok whence some of the natlTiO came out to meet us on iMirlc-l^gi, while others made frrea^ as if to welcome «s» on the lode of httls and rocks near tho the sea, all seemingly rqoiced to see us i those on shflMre running up and down to eadi Other, and those on the bark- logs piradung with all their strength to meet us. No sooner was our anchor doWit than thejr came off to w in crowds, some on bark-lo^ but most of tnem swimming, dl the while talking and calhM to each other confusedly. In an instapt our ship was AiU otthese swarthy gentrv, all quite naked. Among the rest wks their king or chieC who was no way distinguishable from the rest by an^ particular orna- ment, or even by any deference paid to him by his people^ hu only ensim of sovereignty beuia a round black stick ^ hard wood, about two feet and a hwf long. This being ob- served by some of our people^ thvf brought him to me» and concluding that I was the chief of the shi[H bo ddivered his black sceptre to me in a handsome manner, which I lmmo> diately returned. Notwithstanding his shvagie iqipearane^ diis man bad a good countenance, and there was someUiing di|piified in his manner and beheviotirt I soon found a Way to regale them, by setting before them abundance of our choicest Peruvian conserves, with which they seemed much gratified. The^ were accommodated with spoons, mostly silver, all of which they very honestlv returned. Having thus conlmeAccld friendsblp with the natives, I sent an officer ashore to view the watering-place; and, to mske him the more welcome^ I sent with him.some coarMjbhM hsize and some sugar, to distribute among the women., Oii M^ng our boat rc»dv to put off, the king was for aoeompa^ nying her in his bfjinc-fog, but I persuaded him to go in th# boat» with which be seemed to be much frrati^Mir Tlui m^ jnainder of the day;Was spent with our wud viator^ who be- haved in fwnofal veijr, quietly. .

They also rolled our casks down to the beach, but aliv^ expected a white man to assut them, though quite tatisfied if he only touched the cask with his finger. This eased our men of a great deal of fatigue^ and shorten- ed the time of our stay at this place. We even found means to moke those who used to stay all day on board, of some use to us ; for, when we came to heel the ship, we crowded them all oter on one side, which, with other shifts, gave her a deep healk while we cleaned and paid her bottom with pitch and tallow^ The natives seemed every day more and more attached to us. When our boat wait ashore in the mornings there wps oonataatly a laige retinue in waiting on the beach for our ptiftkt and particuhn>h for thoae wnom they guctwd to be abo^e the common rank, by their better dress. By this tim^ the news of onr arrival had ^read thlwdgh all the neigbbour- iiw partly and some natives of difKnrent tribes from that wMch dwdt about the bayi canse duly to visit us.

Having completed oar busfaiess in five days, we prepared for pur departure on the 18th August, aqd employed that morn- ing in making a large distribution of Suoar among the wo- men, and gave a oreat many knives, oldaxes, ahd old iron among the men, being the most valuable presents we could make them ; ond, in return, they gave us bows and arrows, deer-skin bags, live foxes and squirrels, and the like. That we might impress them with awe of our superior power, wis saluted them with five guns on loosing our top-sails, which greatly frightened them, and there seemed an universal damp on their spirits on seeing our sails loosed, as sorry for our approaching departure. The women were all in tears when my people were coming off to the ship ; and many of tho men remained till we were under sail, and then leapt into the sea with sorrowfol countenances. < < vi< Having made some stay in California, some account of that country and its inhabitants may be expected ; though I believe a complete discovery of its extent and boundaries would produce few real advantages,, except satisfying the cu- rious. That part of California which I saw, being tne south- ern extremity of its western coast, appears mountainous, Varren, and sandy, much like some parts of Peru ; yet tho soil about Porto Leguro, and most likely in the other vnllies, IS a rich black mould, and when turned up fresh to the sun, appears as if intermingled with gold-dust. We endeavoured to wash and purify some of this, and the more this was done, the more it appeared like gold. In order to bo ht* ther satisfied, I brought away some of this earth, but it was afterwards lost in our confusions in China. However this may be^ California probably abounds in metals of all sorts, though the natives had no ornaments or utensils of any me- tal, which is not to be wondered atc» as they are perfectly %- . norant of all arts. The country has plenty of wood, but the trees are very amall, hardly better than bushes. But woods, which are an omamtnt to most other countries, serve only to make this appear the more deiolate; for locusts swarm here in such numbers^ »' *■ *; *>■■ 1^' i:^ sU-'!«Wi»*''«s.' <*;_ ■:■*, - 4i4RnSi^^'^'*^ '^' ii'iwitiiiii .i.^jy .-iTt inAJP, xti* Btctim ,' Georgi Sheltdeke, # iJiMlilitri, that tluy da noljkaMlit j^rete leaf dta the:tiMri: hkjihA: day, tfaotaticitniieUlrfiiiMicts are continually oft the irfflgin cldudii and are fXM[eaMly troubletome by flvfng ill oneft: face.

The wa^ tering^place is on the north side of the bay or haibOur, being ft Nnall river which there flows into the sea, a^d nay easily lie known by the appearance of a great Quantity of green canes growing in it, which always retain their verdure^ not being touched by the locusts, as these canes probabty contain something no«:ious to that voracious insect.. The men of this country arc tall, straight, and well 8et» having largd limbsj with coartse black hair, hardly reaching to their shoulders. The women are of much smaller size^ having much longer bliir than the men, with which some <» them almost cover their faces. Some of both sexes have Stod countenances ; but all are much darker-complexioned an any of the other Indians I saw in the South Seas, being a very deep copper*colour. The men go quite nak^, weoi^ iag only a few trifles by way of ornament, such as a band or wreath of red and white silk-ffrass round their heads, adorn- cd on coch side with a tufb of nawk's feathers. Others have pieces of motherH>f-pearl and small shells fastened among their hair, and tied round their necks; and some had large necklaces of six or seven strings, composed of small red and black berries. Some ate scarified all over their bodies; others use paint, some smearing their faces and breasts with black, while others were painted black down to the navel, and from thence to the feet wiih red. The women wear a thick fringe or petticoat of srlk-gras§, reaching from their middle to their heels, and have a deei^ skin carelessly thrown over ilicir shoulders.

Thov^ the appearance of the CW> lifomians is exceedingly savage, yet, mun what I could; ob- serve of their behavioof to eiwh other, and their dqportuMit towards us, they seem to possess all imaginable hiunaaityr All the time we were there* and constantly am<Miff many hundreds of then, there was nothinff to be seen but ue most (igreeaMe harmony, and most aflStcmmate behaviour to ^h other. When any of us gave any fhinff eatable to one per- son, he always divided it amon^ i^ who were around him, reserving the smallest share to himself. They seldom walk- ed eingly, but racMdy in pairs, hand in hand. They seemed of meek and gentle dispositions, having no appearance of cruelty ^n their countenances or behaviour, yet seemed haughty towards their women. Th^ lead a careless life, having every thing in common, and seemed to desire nothing beyond the necessaries of life. They never once offered to piUer or steal any of our tools or other utensils; and such %as their honesty, that my men having forgotten their axes one day on shore, while cutting wood, which was noticed by one of the natives, he told it to the king, who sent into the wood for the axes, and restored them with much apparent •satisfaction. Their language is guttural and harsh, and they talk a jgreat deal, but I could never understand a single word they spoke. Their dwellings were venr m^n, being scarcely sut- iicient to shelter them. Their diet is, I believe, mostly ^b, which they frequently eat raw, but they sometimes bake it in 4ho sand. They seldom want abundance of this food, as the men go out to sea on their bark-logs, and are very expert harponiers. Their harpoons are made of hard wood, and with these they strike the largest albicores, and bring them ashore on their bark-logs, which they row with double paddles. This seemed strange to us, who had oflen expe- rienced the strength of these fish; for frequently when we had hold of one of these with very large hooks, made fiist to eight-strand twine, we had to bring the ship to, to bring them in, and it was then as much as eight or ten men could do; so that one would expect, when an Indian had struck one of these fish, from his light float, it would easil^r run away with the man and the bark-log } but they have some sleight in their way of management, by which the strength and ■• ■ H '.A •BAT.

When Uie iCaHforniant want to drinkt they waqe into the rinr, up to their middle^ where they take up the water in llteir Itands, or stoop' down and snclc it with their mouths. ^ Their tlnte is occupied between hunting^ fishing, eating, and thtfbiMi' and kavuig abundimt <$tercis^ and rathtr a spare diet, their lives are ordinarilfy prolonged to considerabje 1^ many of both sexes appearing to to very old, by thdr face^ befatf much wrinkled^ and their hair verv gr^. Th^ bowl iuPeMMut six feet long, with strings macie of deer's si- news, bat their arrows seemed too lon|p for their bolrs ; and eoia^ieri% that they have no adequate tools, these artiflba must i^e^ire much time in making. Tlie shafts of thdr ar- rows eonsist of a hollow eane^ for two- thirds of their length, die other third, or head, being of a heavy kind of wood, edged with flin^ or sometimes agate, and the edges nbtched like a saw. With a very sharp pomt. They made no display of their arms to us, and we seldom saw any in tlieir hands, though they have need of some arms to aefend themselves from wild beasts, as I saw some inen who had been severely hurt in that way, partictriarly one old man, who had his thi^ almost torn in pieces by a tiger or lion, and thoi^ hcfUed, it was frightiUlly scarred. The women commonly go into the woods with bows and' arrows in search of game, while the men are chiefly occupied in fishing. I can sav no- thing respecting their government, except that it did not seem any way strict or rigorous. When the king appeared in public, he was usually attended by many couples, or men wuking hand in hand, two and two together. On the first morning of our arrival, he was seen in this manner coming out of a wood,' and noticing one of my officers cutting down a tree, whom he judged to be better than ordinam by ha- ving i^lver lace on his wabtcoat, he shewed both his autho- rity and civility at the same time, by ordering one of his at- tendants to take the axe and work in his stead. One day while we were there, a prodigious flat fish was seen basking in the sun on the surface of the water near the' shore^ on which twelve Indians swam oif and surrounded him. Finding himself disturbed, the fish dived, and they after hifti, but he escaped from them at this time. He ap- peared again in about an hour, when sixteen or seventeen Indians swam oif and encompassed him ; and, by continually tormenting ;#v ^ji* ...jii^uis.^ imif*mi»tmi0*4 % for ^ P9n!jiNpiM%ii^ /r4«(f]ilipQS/if; H nqt to jbe.expHM4, ^1^ ynih fidbjeb t^ Iiu|<PP« Ptrovit^ 4iilit<^ himi IwtrlMMtf i|>lou|djiet h^ «m|iijdloi|L yfifdi ih&at li^igiji iiM0iiii«ihk «i witli: the M»^ oC.f dim Ii^iiMiKlk' ' t M #t 9^1^ •g0«ch ifjt,^ jvm M a likeijr plaoe^ |^ maelpc _ i^jllj^ i%wb|(^h we miglpt^lirQfiJMMi » iioij^^; < ConstacnDg t|bfi Ifog^ of the Togri^gy ibcfiii» ihip wjM In a vei^rDpl ^pi^4Ui«n» at h«r aioli aad ing-yien 99 old ^<i roitteq^ i^#' if any acoidtnt hftd ben our nuiitff <^ ifi^ we,1^4:j|«en rcdneed-t^ieKlrem* ' \\ ana'uajfacrjh havingj iiftt<;h<l^e.eUW of . «ailt:i>r agakitt deficiencicB wbijBh; ^lud not be a^ij^UiW : Having: t|V«ady oyer4^roe Jfiajngi^ dpbctthle^ seemiijigly; ioiKiinifi0unl-< ^^ in .pra|^^ wo ^erefa^'of hope toget over theie itiKH; fiiil-tfeplM^^ epqptec^ oar natiy^ ihoresi favir£ tt» fij^i;iU to-fqfi^ilfij^li^s Usdioua 0 so< vejjJ^llf^ifififortW a qopi^tiojii* We «are now m ir«lkl;y& Q)ai^ileii| ^t ifre :9onl4 scarcely bavie been able to navigrtef our veud witiM»ui jtlMi .f^stance of tbe n^roas not amount-' ins noip^ to tbiictj^ !wbite%; so mucb bad our crew been redu- oed by untO]var4|ri|6C«deot«. !^ We 4iscoveii9^.an islaud on the 2.Utr 1 IQ l^agne^ W« & Wm fl'Oin Capo St mi^m, * but as tbe wind, blew fnab* t. could' Qot'get nearer than two leagues, and did not think profwr to Ime time in laying-to in the n^ht.

A great part of the inhabitants of Dotavia are Chineeei who are remarkable for wearing there their ancient dress^ having their hair rolled up in such a manner that there is little Sffi^rence in that respect between the men and women. Ever since the revolutifm in China, which brought that coun^ try under the Tartar yoke^ the Tartarian dress has been im* posed upon the whole kingdom, which was not effected with- out great bloodshed : For many of the Chinese were so su^ fierstiliously attached to their ancient modes, that they un- accountably chose rather to lose their lives than their nair | as the Tartar fashion is to shave the head, except a long lock on the crown, which they pkiit in the same manner we do; The Dutch, taking advantage of this superstitious attachment ofthe Chinese to their hair, exact from nil the men who live under their protection, a poll-tax of a doiiar a month for the liberty of wearing their hair, which prpdnces a very conii- der^le revenue.

Jmendix to Shehfocke*t Voyage round the World, CoHtamiiig ObKrvatiom on the Country and InhabUantt of Peru, by Capttun Betag/h * u. IMTBOPUCTION. This article may rather seem misplaced, as here inserted amone the circumnavigations ; but, both as having arisen out of the voyi^ of Shelvocke, and because arranged in this manner by Harris, it has been deemed proper and ne- cessary to preserve it in this place, where it may be in a great measure considered as a supplement to the preceding voyage. In the opinion of Harris, \" The time that Beta^h lived among the Spaniards in Peru, and the manner m which he was treated by them, gave him an opportunity of acquainting himself with their manners and customs, and with the nature and maxims of their govemmoit, such aa no Englishman had possessed; and the lively manner in which he tells his story, gives it much beauty and spirit.'* We have already seen, in the narrative of Shelvocke^ the occaiiba * Karris, I. 240. \"V'^: 'T^trt <ftAi*.'^.

PtO'ticulan if the Capture of the Mercury by thi Spaniard$» It was in the beginning of the year 1720, about the mid' die of March, when Captain Shelvocke sent Hately and the rest of us to seek our fortunes in the lighter called the Mer-» cury. He then went in the Speedwell to plunder the villago of Payta, where we might easily have joined him, had he been pleased to have imparted his design to us. We had not cruized long off Cape Blanco, when we took a small bark, having a ^od quantity of flour and chocolate. There were also on Imard an elderly lady, and a thin old friar^ whom we detained two or three days; and, after taking put what could be of use to us, we discharged the bark and! them. Soon after this we took the Pink, which Shelvocke ci^ the rich prize. Her people had no suspicion of our being an enemy, and held on their way till they saw the Mercury standing towards them, and then began to suspect us; oa which, about noon, they clapt their helm hard a-weatlier^ and crowded all sail before the wind; and, being in ballast^ this was her best sailing, yet proved also the greatest advan* tage they could have given us ; for, had she lield her wind, our flat-bottomed vessel could never have got up with theirs. About ten o'clock at night, with the assistance of hard row« ing, we got up within shot of the chase^ and made her bnng to, when pretty near the shore. On boarding the priz^ in which were about seventy persons, thirty of whom vWere negroes, Hately left me and Pressick in the Mercury, with other four, where wc continued two or three days, till a \" >.,w.if<4ivcew- ii.= { i ahcftvj rAin sppUed all our brettd and otber dnr proviiMNN* fl^e. then yrenl on board the pru^ tending tore* Mctt^ take cbaive of the Mertttiy. n- % Merrily we stood off and on in the height of Glftl Blanoo for ^eren or ei^t day% expecting to meet idtb mi {Speedwell} and at^ that place we eWt ashore the Spani4f UHi»t(dto» a padre or priest* and toniegMitleram ptME^ngi^ iit last we espied a sau J^mg to wiadward; alid» JittTiDg ti» dOttbt that she wafeeith^r the ;SkM4dtrell qr the €lMflCflii^ Hfte Itood towards her, while she also «dged down toiNurds wfii ^bout ten in the mbmiog we werb near enoo^ to taalu- her out to be a ship of war, but n^itheri>f thbse we wiilhld for. The master of our prize had before informed us, diat he had fallen in with the BrHliantet which was cruizing for our prifAteers, and We h^ till: now entirely disregiEOKUHi his in- formation. Upon this, IliUely advised with me what we ought to do in this emergency, when we agreed to endea- vour to take adyaata^ of tha infotmatkm given us by the S^asuards; eonsiderHui^ as the firlUiante nad spdcen M^ very lately with the Pmk, that there mf^t not he manj questions asked How.

This being very troublifr- some, the Indians advised me to hiy the reins on the mulcts neck, and on doing that the creature easily hit the way. These sand hills often shift from place to place, which I sup- pose is occasioned by stsong eddy winds^ reverbenU^ froi|| the mountains. ■'''* We rested at night in an old empty house, aBdut half way, which the gukle told me was built by the inhisbitant*^ of Piura, for the aqeomi^odationr of the prince of San Bitenoj viceroy of i Peru, when they met and reg^ved him at his entrance on his government. After a short rest, we continued our journey, and arrived at Piura, a handsotne regularly built tQwn^ on the banks of the river Callan or Ptura* The Indian conducted us to the house of an- hon^t Spanish gentleman and his wife, to whose charge he com« mitted us, and then returned to Fhyta. In less thana quar- ter of an hour, the inhabitants of the town flodced to see 119, as a raree-show, and entertained us with respect and ci- vility, instead of using us as prisoners of war. The gen^ tieman to* whose charge we were committed was named Don Jeronimo Batdivieso, who had five (feughters, who- veered us in so benevolent a manner, that we hoped our time wodd slide easily away, and our captivity prove now^ disagreea- ble; and I now became sensible of the favour shewn me by Son Pe^fo in sending me to this place ; for he had such in- terest in all Peru, that for his sake we found very good treat- ment. After refreshing onrseTvesr according to the custom of the oountry, with chocolate, biscuit, ana water, wc were sere- naded by the sound of a harp from some inner apdrtment. 1 ( m If* t^mmmmm •% f*»* in^. ?'»';• Mtjjp. xit. tieh fin* ' Oiwgt SMoMJift 0f 'irUch initriunent the artiil Men«d to have • i^fiod fliand* as I heard paiti of Mfeitl fiunous ctMnpodtionty bodi It^ian and English.

During the prevalence of the Italian part)' at the^ eoMK of Madrid; the last viceroy of Tern, the pillMf of Sisn Buen6» who was an Italian, brought a great maiiy iltitH sicians to diat country along with him, by whom the tail^ tor mdsic haid spread every wher^ and had become as good, in Fran as in old Spain. I the rather notice thls^ becaustb bv our being lovers of music, and behavinff peaoeafafy aila <»villytO' the inhabitants, we passed our time quietly anici chcaftrfiilly. We were only exposed to one iaoonvenienci^' which l^ed all the time we remained here : which was, thtf daily assembling of the people to stare at us. I and mr sergeant Cobbs, bczng used to exercise in public, bore thia Eretty well ; but Mr Pressick, being a srave man, at first ung down his bead, and was very melancholy. Bat he grew better acquainted with the people by dejgrees, and camtf to like them so well, that we had much ado to get hini away* When it became necessary for us to remove our quarters. Almost all the commodities of Europe are distributed- throttgh Spanish America by a sort of pedlars^ or mer- chants who travel on foot. 1 hese men come from Panamar to Payta by sea; and in their road from Payta to Lim% make Piura their first stage, disposing of their goods, and lessening their burdens, as they go along. From Piuray some take the inland road by Caxamarca, and others Uie road along the coast through Truxillo. From Lima they take their passage back to Panama by sea, perhaps carrying with them a small adventure of brandy. At Panama they again stock themselves with European goods, and return by sea to Payta. Here they hire mules to carry their goods, taking Indians abng with them to guide the mules and carry them oack : And in this way these traders keep a continual round, till they have gained a sufficiency to live on.

' AoMng my int onquirlei Was into the condition of othei^ English prisoners at this place. I learnt from Ueutenant Seroeantion and his men, who were here before us, that most of tndn had adopted the rdigkm Of the country, had beeii chriftened, and were dimersd among the convents <^ the dty. The first of these iroet had his catechism iu one hand, and a Iar«r string of beads dangling in the other. I smiled^ and asked him how he liked it r He said, very well ; for ha^ Ting a religion to chuse, he thought theirs better than nonei eqiecially as it brought him good meat and drink, and tt quiet life. Many ofShelvocke's men followed this example and I may venture to say, that most of them had the samO substantial reason for their conversion. It is here reckoned very meritorious to make a convert, and many arguments were used for that purpose, but no rigorous measures were mad to bring any one over to their way of thinking. Those who consented to be baptized, generally had some of the merchants of IJma for their patrons and cod-fathers, who never failed to give them a good suit of c&thes, and some money to drink their healths. « Afaiottt this time four or five of Cllpperton's men had leats from the convents where they resided, to meet together at r. Eublic-houte kept bv one John Bell, an Englishman, who ad a negro wife, who had been made free for some service or other. The puipose of this meeting was merely to con- firm their new baptism over a bowl otpuneh ; but they all got driink and quarrelled, and, forgetting they were true catholics, they demolished the image of some honest saint that stood in a comer, mistaking him for one of their com- panions. Missing them for a few days, I enquired at BeU what was become of them, when he told me they were all in the Inquiution } for the thin^ having taken air, he was obliged to go himsdf to complam of their behaviour, but he got them released a few days after, when they had time to re> pent and get sober in the dungeons of the holy office.

Some time afterwards, about a dozen of our men from the Success and Speedwell were sent to Calao, to assist in. ca- reening and fitting out the Flying-fish| designed for Europe. They here entered into a plot to run awav with the Marofi- rita, a good sailing ship wnich lay in the harbour, meapuig to have gone for themselves, in which of course they would have acted as pirates. Not knowing what to do for amnui* liition and a compass, they applied to Mr Sergeantson, pre> tending they meant to steal away to Panama, where there was an English factdi^, and whence they had hopes of get* ting home. They said they had got half a dozen firelocks^ wju which they might be able to kill wild hogs or other gam^ as they went along, and begged him to help them to some powder and shot, and a compass to steer their way through the woods. By braging and making catholic signs to the people in Lima, they mui collected some dollars, which they desired Sergeantson to lav out for them ; and he, not mistrusting their plot, bought them what they wanted. Thus furnished, one of. them came to me at Lima, and told me their intention, and that Sprake was to have the command, as being the only one among them who knew any thing of navigation. I answered, that it was a bold design ; but as Captain Fitzgerald had engaged for my honour, I conM not engage in it* Their plot was discovered a few doys after, thdr lodgings searched, their arms token away, and they were committed to prison. The government was much in^ censed against them, and had nearly determined upon their execution ; but they were soon all released except Sprake^ who was the ringleader, and was kept in irons for two or three months, and then set at liberty. The dominions belonging to the Spaniards in America are sp large and valuable, that, if well sovemed, th^ might ren* der that monarchy exceedingly rormidable. In my long stay in Peru, I had the means of examining at leisure, and with atte ition, their manner of living, the ^rm of dieurgpr vemment, and many other circumstances little known in our part of the world, and had many opportunities of enquiring into things minutely, which did not tall under my immediate observation ; and of which I propose to give as clear and acr purate an account as I cani constantly distioguislMng W : , tweeft - .-^^mirfsaelewBiv^— - r.

Every inaffistrate in this country knows that his reign is short, and thw he will be laughed at if he does not make a fortune, so that they wink at each other ; and, so great is the distance between Spain and Peru, that the royal orders lire seldom regarded, being two years in going backward and fbrwaind : Hence arise many clandestine domgs. According to law, the king ought to have a twentieth part of all the gokit and a fifth of all the silver procured from the mires ; but vast Suantities are carried away privately, without paying any nty, both north by Panama, and south through the Straits 0f Magelhnr There are also vwt sums allowMi for the mi- litiv jS-r 7« I.

Hence it may easily be imagined what immense riches would flow into the treasury of Madrid) if his catholic majesty were faiUifully aerved. • u^The country of Peru is naturally subject to earthquakes. ,^bout fifty years before I was there, or about the year 1670^ there were two great ones at Lima* which overturned many houses, churches, and convents. And in the reign of Charles II. the late king of Spain, there was an earthquake near the equator, which lifted up whole fields, carrying them to the distance of several miles. Small shocks are often felt which dp no harm, and I have been often called out of bed on such becasions, B.nd heard nothing more about the matter ; but on these occasions the bells nlways toll to prayers. Yet, al- though this country has suffered much from earthquakes, es- pecially near the coast, their churches are lofly and neatly built. Such parts of their buildings as require strength are made of burnt bricks ; but their dwelling-houses are all con- structed of bamboos, canes, and bricks only dried in the sun, which are sufficienUy durable, as it never rains in Peru. Instead of roofs, they are merely covered over with mats, on which ashes are strewed, to keep out the dews. The small river of Lima, or Runact consists mostly of snow-water from the neighbouring mountains, which are covered all the year with snow, that partly dissolves in the summer-season, from ^September to March. One would expect the weather to be much hotter here; but there is no proportion between the heat of this part of America and the same latitudes in Africa. This is owing to two causes; that the neighbourhood of the snowy mountains diffuses a cool temperature of the air all around ; and the constant humid vapours, which are so frequent that I often expected it to rain when I first went to Lima. These va- pours are not so dense, low, and gloomy, like our fogs, nor yet are they separated above like our summer clouds ; but an exhalation between both> spread all around, as when we say the day is overcast, so that sometimes a fine dew is felt on the upper sarments, and may even be discerned on the knap of the cloth. This is a prodigious convenience to the inha- bitants of Lima, who are thus screened half the day from the pun ; and though it often shines out in the afternoon, yet is ^e heat very tolerablt^ being tempered by the sea-breezeti, . . . and ,'. miAPi zn. ucr. viii. .

In -these amaseaaetits they have several customs peculiar to them* jdves. After evening prayers, the genderoan changes his idress from a okudc to.a montero, or jockey'<K»at, with a laced Unen ciqp on hb head, and a handkerchief round his neck, •instead of* wig; or if he wear his own hair, it must be tucki ■ ed under a ci^ and concealed) as it is the universal fashion r to be diuli disguised. Even those who have no mi^^«ss, am .ashamed to appear virtuous, and miist be somehow masked :;or disguised^; in order to countenance the wav of the world. As all this is night-work* they have an established rule to ,avoid quarrds, ^ never speaking to or noticing each other, when ffdinginquestof.or to visit their ladies. .>.n /; J 'fu In uort^ the fore^^part of every Jiight in theyear is a kind .of masquerade Alnong peof)le of any rank who do not keep •calashes,, one couple never walks close behind another, but «e«^h: at ^e distance of at least twelve paces, to prevent the . oveiheiuring : of any secret whispers. Should a lady drop a &n qr any thing dse by accident, a gentleman may take it up, but he must not |^e it to the lady j but to the gentleman twho accompanies her, lest slie ^lay happen to be the wife or 'tutm of him who takes it up ; and as all the ladies are ydled, -these wise rules are devised to prevent any impertinent dis- coveries. Any freedom in contravention of these laws of gak lantry would be looked upon as the highest affront, and would be thought to merit a drawn swora through the midriff*. . Should any one see his most intimate friend any where with a woman, he must never take notice of it, or mention it af- terwards.
