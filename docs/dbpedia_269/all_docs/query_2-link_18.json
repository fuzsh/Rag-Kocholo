        "text": ".\n\nChristos Dantis (Greek: Î§ÏÎ®ÏÏÎ¿Ï ÎÎ¬Î½ÏÎ·Ï; born Christos Vlahakis, 26 September 1966), is a Greek multi-instrumentalist singer, songwriter, lyricist, and record producer best known for his hits such as \"To Palio Mou Palto\" and \"Ena Tragoudi Akoma\" and later for composing and co-writing the song \"My Number One\" for Elena Paparizou, winning the Eurovision Song Contest 2005 for Greece.[1]\n\nCareer\n\nEarly music career\n\nChristos Dantis started playing music in front of an audience when in his early teens. He sang and played either guitar or bass guitar, while also experimenting with the drums, in various music genre bands such as rock, funk, soul, R&B, metal etc. It was in the 1986â87 period of the Music Stage Taboo in Athens, when during the auditions for new singers to complement the program of main singers Tania Tsanaklidou and Dimitra Galani, composer George Hatzinasios was the \"godfather\" of his name Dantis.[2] During that period Christos sings in commercial advertising jingles while meeting with many influential producers like Akis Golfidis owner of R.I.A. Productions-Records back then, who produced most of his very first recordings in vinyl.\n\nThe first professionally produced song he sang was in 1986 titled \"Tell me more\" (T. Kallianiotis/T.Siganos) in a compilation named \"Straight to the top\"[3] consisting of various Greek artists singing English lyrics songs. The compilation was made by R.I.A. Productions and distributed by Sony in 1991. In 1987, he sang in his first 45rpm maxi single, again with R.I.A. Productions named \"Christian Dante â Turn On\" (C.Dantis/G.Shaggs) from Sakkaris Records (SR 8546).[4][unreliable source] One year later he collaborated with the composer Yannis Karalis and made his first television appearance on the TV show of Lilanda Likiardopoulou \"Prova\" on Karalis song named \"Eida tin morfi sou\".[5] Same year and his second LP single is out named \"Belly Dance (Y.Karalis/T.Siganos).[6][unreliable source] Performances start to multiply for Christos singing covers of domestic contemporary pop/folk hits and foreign covers of songs sung by James Brown and Terence Trent d'arby.[7]\n\n1990â2000: Growing popularity\n\nDantis later released his first personal album called Dahtilika Apotypomata in 1990 with music and lyrics written by Gianni Karali which became platinum.\n\nIn 1991, he released the golden album Aman which was also released in 4 European countries with remixes. At the same time the video clips from the album were played on MTV and MCM accompanied by a TV special offering live performances and an interview with Steve Blame the presenter of MTV.\n\nThe first experimentations Christos Dantis did with folk songs was in 1993 with the album Ala. One year later Dantis released his most familiar pop-rock album to date, titled 4. The album became gold and the song \"Kapoios Sâ Agapaei\" appeared on MTV once more. Dantis released another album a year later in 1995 called Tama. The album became gold and following his gold success, Dantis decided to release another album in 1996 called Foni Voodos and another in 1997 titled Ta Giousoufakia.\n\nNot wanting to disappoint his growing fan base, Dantis released a double album titled Tournas â Dantis Live or known by some as Krifo Sholeio. The live recordings were taken from his concerts that year with Kostas Tournas. Striving for the best, Dantis began work on his next album immediately. It took just 11 months of preparations in studio for his next album To Palio Mou Palto which was released in 1999. The album immediately became gold.\n\n2000â2004: Further success\n\nA few months later, he redid the song \"24.000 baci\" by Adriano Celentano for the movie Safe Sex created by Repas and Papathanasiou which is included in the movie soundtrack. The song reached the top of the charts after just a couple of days of release. In 2001 he moved to the independent Greek record label Nitro Music and released the album To Domatio which soon became platinum and the songs \"To Domatio\", \"Dos Mou Fotia\" and his duet with Notis Sfakianakis \"Himonas Einai\" became hits.\n\nAfter a two-year break, Dantis returned in May 2003 by signing with Sony Music Greece and with the album Ena Tragoudi Akoma composed entirely by Giorgos Theofanous. In 2004 he participated in the Greek talent show Fame Story as a member of the committee and in May, he released one of his most successful albums to date Maya Maya. Besides himself, music and lyrics were written by Vangelis Konstantinidis, Vassilis Giannopoulos, Sofie Pappa, Natalia Germanou, Manos Psaltakis, Christoforos Germenis, Konstantinos Pantzis, Giannis Liondos, and Antonis Skokos. In the winter of 2004-05 he appeared at club Fix with Christos Pazis.\n\nIn 2005, he composed the song \"My Number One\". The music was written by himself and lyrics by Natalia Germanou. It was chosen as Greeceâs official participation in the Eurovision Song Contest in Kiev, Ukraine and sung by Elena Paparizou on May 21, 2005. The song won the contest and Greece won the contest for the first time. The song became very popular with Elena Paparizou and Dantis reaching highs in their careers.\n\n2005âpresent\n\nIn May 2005, Christos Dantis wrote the album Eho Sta Matia Ourano for Katy Garbi along with the songs \"Akouse Agori Mou\", \"To Narkotiko Mou\", and his duet \"Spaciba Baby\".

He cooperated with NOVA's satellite platform and wrote the song \"Ola Super\" with lyrics by Vangelis Konstantinidis which will be the musical pattern for 9 sports channels.\n\nIn September 2005, he went to Thessaloniki with Katy Garbi for a number of appearances. Following that, he released a CD single titled \"Prodosia\" in October 2005. The songs \"Beautiful\", \"Ola another CD Single titled \"Gia Senane Bora\".

In January 2007, ERT asked Dantis to take part in a National Selection as a singer to represent Greece in the Eurovision Song Contest 2007. His song \"No Madonna\" hit the charts but didn't make it to the competition.\n\nIn September 2007, after his collaboration with the Mad Music Channel under the \"Mad Secret Concert\" events, he released the album \"DANTIS â ROCK AND LIVE\" with many popular cover songs of artists such as The Killers, Kaiser Chiefs, Nek, and great other like James Brown and Stevie Wonder.
