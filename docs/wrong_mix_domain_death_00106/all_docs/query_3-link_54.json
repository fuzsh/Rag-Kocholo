The following day, he returned to the Expo for an afternoon reception at the Temple of Music building. A long line of people stood inside the building waiting to shake hands with the President. When a young man with a bandaged right hand approached the President, McKinley offered to shake his left hand. Suddenly the sound of two gunshots rang out. McKinley slumped over, shot twice in the stomach by Leon Czolgosz, an anarchist who had concealed a gun in his bandage. Several men standing nearby wrestled the attacker to the ground while others rushed the President to another room.\n\nMcKinley underwent emergency surgery at the Exposition's hospital, which was no more than a first aid station. In the rush to save McKinley's life, the doctors present did not wait for a specialist to arrive before they began surgery. They relied on mirrors to reflect the afternoon sun because only one electric light lit the room. As was the practice at the time, they operated without masks or gloves and did not have the proper surgical instruments with them. The doctors found and removed one bullet but could not locate the second. They refused to use an x-ray machine provided by Thomas Edison because they did not know what long-term effects its use might have on the President. Typical of the time, McKinley was sent to a private home rather than a hospital to recover. He and his wife temporarily moved to the home of John Milburn, President of the Pan-American Exposition.\n\nWhile delivering a speech in Vermont, Vice President Theodore Roosevelt received word of McKinley's shooting. He arrived in Buffalo the next day, accepting an invitation to stay at the home of Ansley Wilcox, a prominent lawyer. The two had been friends since the early 1880s when they both worked closely with New York State Governor Grover Cleveland. Wilcox recalled that \"the family and most of the household were in the country, but he [Roosevelt] was offered a quiet place to sleep and eat, and accepted it.\"1 The Vice President stayed at the Wilcox house for four days, meeting with newspaper reporters, members of the President's Cabinet, Senators, and other government officials who had gathered in Buffalo after the shooting. Wilcox later wrote, \"From the first moment of his [Roosevelt's] arrival, and the favorable answers which were made to his questions about the condition of the President...the Vice President seemed possessed with an abiding faith that the wound would not be fatal.... So, when, on Tuesday...everything seemed to be going well...it was thought best that the Vice President...should go away in order to impress the public with that confidence in the outcome which everyone then felt.\"2\n\nRoosevelt hurried to the Adirondack Mountains in northern New York State to join his vacationing family. Well-known for his love of the outdoors and the strenuous life, he embarked on a hike up Mt. Marcy, the highest peak in New York State. On his return, Roosevelt saw a man approaching and later recalled, \"When I saw the runner I instinctively knew he had bad news--the worst news in the world.\"3 The messenger handed Roosevelt a telegram explaining that McKinley had developed an infection and was not expected to live through the night. Roosevelt hurriedly arranged for a horse and carriage to take him on the six-hour journey to the nearest train station, 35 miles away in North Creek. At dawn, as he prepared to board a special train to Albany and then to Buffalo, Roosevelt received the terrible news that President William McKinley had died at 2:15 am.\n\nThe country had been without a President for almost 12 hours by the time Roosevelt arrived in Buffalo on the afternoon of Saturday, September 14. Many people became anxious for his inauguration to take place. After stopping to pay his respects to the President's widow, Roosevelt returned to the Wilcox home. He requested that the inauguration be quiet and private. The Buffalo Courier reported the next day that \"it was hurriedly agreed between the Vice President and members of the Cabinet that it would probably be better to have the ceremonies take place away from the (Milburn) house in which lay the remains of the dead President. The Wilcox house was at once agreed upon.\"4\n\nThose invited to attend included the Wilcoxes, the Cabinet, U.S. government officials in Buffalo at that time, the doctors who had operated on McKinley, and officials of the Exposition. A few newspaper reporters received permission to attend at the last minute to take notes. Fearing the inauguration might take on a \"circus\" atmosphere, Roosevelt forbade any photographs taken of the event. The ceremony, in which Federal District Judge John R. Hazel administered the presidential oath, was brief, private, and solemn. The crowd outside milled around for hours hoping to get a glimpse of the new President. Beyond a brief press statement, Roosevelt stayed out of the spotlight for the two days he remained in Buffalo. Later his friend Ansley Wilcox, whose home had witnessed the historical event, wrote, \"It takes less in the way of ceremony to make a president in this country, than it does to make a King in England or any monarchy, but the significance of the event is no less great.\" 5\n\nQuestions for Reading 1\n\n1. Why do you think that the crowd, the police guards, and even President McKinley failed to realize that the man with the bandaged hand might be dangerous? Could something like this take place today? Why or why not?\n\n2. What factors caused the doctors to operate on President McKinley under such poor conditions? What might they have done differently?\n\n3. Why did Roosevelt leave Buffalo four days after the shooting? Do you think this action had a positive effect on the public? Why or why not?\n\n4. Why do you think people became anxious to have Roosevelt take the presidential oath? Why did he take the oath in a private home rather than a public building?\n\n5. What do you think Ansley Wilcox meant by his statement comparing the coronation of a king and the inauguration of a president? Explain your answer.\n\nReading 1 was adapted from sources housed at the Buffalo and Erie County Historical Society and the Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site.\n\n1Ansley Wilcox, \"Theodore Roosevelt, President\" (unpublished manuscript, 1901; reprinted October 1919, Buffalo and Erie County Historical Society Library Collection, Buffalo, New York).\n\n2Ibid.\n\n3Eloise Cronin Murphy, Theodore Roosevelt's Night Ride to the Presidency (Blue Mountain Lake, New York: The Adirondack Museum, 1977), 19.\n\n4Buffalo Courier, September 15, 1901.\n\n5Ansley Wilcox, \"Theodore Roosevelt, President\" (unpublished manuscript, 1901; reprinted October 1919, Buffalo and Erie County Historical Society Library Collection, Buffalo, New York).\n\nDetermining the Facts\n\nReading 2: Roosevelt's First Presidential Proclamation\n\nWhen Theodore Roosevelt took the oath of office in the library of Ansley Wilcox's home on September 14, 1901, most Americans remained in a state of shock and grief over the death of their beloved President. Some wondered and even worried about what type of president Roosevelt would make. Roosevelt took several steps to calm the fears of the nation and give comfort to mourners. Shortly before the inauguration he made a statement to those gathered in the library that the newspapers printed the following day.\n\nI shall take the oath at once in accord with the request of you members of the Cabinet, and in this hour of our deep and terrible national bereavement I wish to state that it shall be my aim to continue absolutely unbroken the policy of President McKinley for the peace, the prosperity and the honor of our beloved country.¹\n\nAfter the ceremony, the new President, Cabinet members, and several other advisors met in Ansley Wilcox's study to draft Roosevelt's first presidential proclamation. Filled with crossed out sentences and added words, the first draft clearly shows Roosevelt's apprehension. After rewriting the draft, he threw the original away and issued a typed copy to the press. Wilcox, understanding the importance of the events taking place in his home, removed the papers from the wastebasket and placed them in his scrapbook. Following is Theodore Roosevelt's first presidential proclamation:\n\nBy the President of the United States of America:\n\nA proclamation: First part. A terrible bereavement has befallen our people. The President of the United States has been struck down--a crime committed not only against the chief magistrate, but against every law-abiding and liberty-loving citizen.\n\nPresident McKinley crowned a life of largest love for his fellow men, of most earnest endeavor for their welfare, by a death of Christian fortitude; and both the way in which he lived his life and the way in which in the supreme hour of trial he met his death WILL REMAIN FOREVER A PRECIOUS HERITAGE of our people.\n\nIt is meet that we as a nation express our abiding love and reverence for his life, our deep sorrow over his untimely death.\n\nNow, therefore, I, Theodore Roosevelt, President of the United States, do appoint Thursday, September 19, the day in which the body of the dead President will be laid in its last earthly resting place, as a day of mourning and prayer throughout the United States. I earnestly recommend all the people to assemble on that day in their respective places of divine worship there to bow down in submission to the will of Almighty God, and to payout of full hearts their homage of love and reverence to the great and good President whose death has smitten the nation with bitter grief. In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.²\n\nQuestions for Reading 2\n\n1. Why might some people have been worried or even upset about Roosevelt becoming President? (Refer to your textbooks for information on Theodore Roosevelt's progressive policies if necessary.)\n\n2. Why do you think Roosevelt stated that he planned to \"continue absolutely unbroken the policy of President McKinley\"? Do you think this was a reasonable claim? Why or why not?\n\n3. Why did Wilcox keep Roosevelt's initial draft of the proclamation? How does it add to our understanding of the people, the place, and the event involved?\n\n4. Are there words in the proclamation that are unfamiliar to you? If so, circle them and try to find out what they mean.\n\nReading 2 was compiled from documents housed at the Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site.\n\n¹Buffalo Courier, September 15, 1901.\n\n²Buffalo (NY) Express, September 15, 1901.\n\nDetermining the Facts\n\nReading 3: The Bully Pulpit\n\nWhen Roosevelt began his presidency in September 1901, he faced an administration he did not choose and policies with which he did not necessarily agree. He asked McKinley's Cabinet to remain in office under his administration, but within a year several of it members had resigned. Despite changes in the Cabinet, Roosevelt did not demonstrate how different his policies would be from those of his predecessor until the following year when a national crisis arose over a coal strike.\n\nAt the turn of the century, coal was America's principal source of heat and energy. Mining was dirty, dangerous, and unhealthy work characterized by low pay and long hours. Early in 1902 the United Mine Workers went on strike to try to obtain better pay, shorter hours, and recognition of their union. The strike wore on for several months, leaving families without coal to heat their homes and cook their meals. Mine owners asked President Roosevelt to send in the Army to break up the strike as the government had done in the past. Roosevelt did threaten to send in the Army--not to break up the strike, but to work the mines--if the mine owners did not agree to talk to the workers about their demands. For the first time in U.S. history a President took the side of the workers in a labor dispute. Both sides compromised and the strike finally ended peacefully. This action conveyed the message to both the owners and workers of industry that Roosevelt would not be a \"status quo\" President.\n\nRoosevelt also preached the message that all Americans, regardless of race, ethnicity or religion, had the right to an education and to gainful employment. Roosevelt, who had suffered health problems as a child, felt a special bond with children. As the father of six, he knew the importance of providing a healthy childhood and a good education. He was frustrated that he could not change the child labor laws himself. However, his outspoken and public stand on many issues helped initiate later efforts to change the laws concerning women's rights, African Americans' civil rights, and child labor. Unfortunately, Roosevelt did not live to see most of the changes he rallied for enacted into law.\n\nRoosevelt not only challenged U.S. domestic policy, but also worked toward expanding the role of the United States in foreign affairs. Since his resignation as Assistant Secretary of the Navy in 1898 to fight in the Spanish-American War, Roosevelt desired to be at the forefront of world affairs. The presidency offered him the opportunity to see the United States become a world power. One world problem that interested Roosevelt was that naval and commercial ships had to travel around South America or Africa to get from one ocean to the other.\n\nAttempts had been made to build a canal through Central America, but nothing had been completed by the turn-of-the-20th-century. In 1903, Columbia offered to negotiate a treaty with the U.S. to build a canal through Panama (then part of Columbia). The Panamanians, who wanted independence from Columbia, offered to make their own treaty with the U.S. to build a canal for less cost. Roosevelt decided to negotiate with the Panamanians. Construction of the Panama Canal began in 1904, and it opened a decade later in 1914.\n\nWhen Roosevelt won the 1904 presidential election he was \"now president...in his own right.\"¹ He continued to be involved in the affairs of other nations during his second term. In 1905, he helped settle a war between Japan and Russia when he invited representatives from both nations to the United States to discuss the possibility of peace. As a result of the meeting, both sides gave in to some of the demands of the other, and they agreed to end the war. In 1906, Theodore Roosevelt became the first American to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Although Roosevelt chose not to run for President in 1908, he admitted to friends that he probably enjoyed being President more than any other man. The position had allowed him to publicly say and do things he thought important for the nation and the world. His time in office truly offered him a \"Bully Pulpit.\" He did run for President again in 1912 as a candidate for the Progressive or \"Bull Moose\" party but lost to Democrat Woodrow Wilson. Roosevelt died in 1919 at the age of 60.\n\nQuestions for Reading 3\n\n1. What is meant by the phrase \"status quo\"? List some examples of how Roosevelt challenged the status quo.\n\n2. Why do you think the Panama Canal was important to Theodore Roosevelt? Would you have negotiated with the Colombians or the Panamanians? Explain your answer.\n\n3. Theodore Roosevelt called the Presidency a \"Bully Pulpit.\" What did he mean by that? Find examples in the reading to support this phrase.\n\nReading 3 was adapted from Lewis Gould, The Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt (Lawrence, Kansas: University Press of Kansas, 1991); and other sources housed at the Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site.\n\n¹Lewis Gould, The Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt (Lawrence, Kansas: University Press of Kansas, 1991), 146.\n\nPutting It All Together\n\nThe following activities will help students understand the impact of national events on the American public and how such events relate to the history of their own community.\n\nActivity 1: Where Were You On the Day...?\n\nPresident McKinley's shooting was a shocking event for Americans in 1901. By interviewing parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, or friends, students can learn the personal feelings of people who remember more recent tragedies. Ask the students to find one person who remembers what he or she was doing on the day each of these events occurred: (1) the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, (2) the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963, (3) the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1968, (4) the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger in 1986, and (5) any major event that occurred in their community that is still remembered today. Have students compile notes from their interviews and ask them to share what they have learned.\n\nActivity 2: A Snapshot of History\n\nAnsley Wilcox kept a scrapbook of the events that took place in his home, in Buffalo, and in the United States between May and November of 1901. For one month have each student follow an ongoing national event such as a presidential election, a trial, or a sports team's effort at winning a championship by clipping an article out of the newspaper every day. Each day also have them clip an article on an interesting local story even if it is not ongoing. Students should paste the articles in a notebook and write one or two sentences telling what happened in their lives that day. If they have a \"souvenir\" (ticket stub, photo, etc. ) from that day, have them include it with their notes. At the end of the month, hold a classroom discussion on the brief \"snapshot\" students have created of their nation, their community, and their family.\n\nActivity 3: Buildings That Have Witnessed History\n\nAsk students to locate a home or building in their community that has served many different purposes over the years. Using primary resources such as atlases, directories, property tax records, census data, and photographs, have the students trace the history of the structure from its construction to the present day. They may want to interview people who lived near the structure for a long time. Then ask students to make a time line with information about the structure at various times in its history on one side. On the other side have the student write what happened in the United States during that same time period. The students may want to donate the completed project to the local historical society so that others can benefit from their research.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt Inaugural Site: Birthplace of the Modern Presidency--\n\nSupplementary Resources\n\nBy looking at The Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural Site: Birthplace of the Modern Presidency, students examine the circumstances under which Theodore Roosevelt first became President of the United States and how his policies and actions modernized the presidency.
