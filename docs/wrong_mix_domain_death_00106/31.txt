On 5th September, 1901, President William McKinley attended a public reception at the Pan American Exposition, a 6-month-long Worldâ€™s Fair, in Buffalo, New York. He was at the height of his power, having been re-elected at the beginning of the year. But one of the people who stood in line to meet him was an anarchist, determined to carry out the first US presidential assassination of the 20th century.
