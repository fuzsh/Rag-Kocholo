        "text": "Maithili literature encompasses poetry, novels, short stories, documents and other writings in the Maithili language. The most popular literary figure in Maithili is the poet Vidyapati (1350–1450), who wrote his poems in the language of the masses, when sanskrit was state official language . After Vidyapati Maithili became more common in literature .\n\nThe Maithili script, Mithilakshara or Tirhuta as it is popularly known, is of a great antiquity. The Lalitavistara mentions the Vaidehi script. Early in the latter half of the 7th century A.D., a marked change occurred in the northeastern alphabet, and the inscriptions of Adityasena exhibit this change for the first time. The eastern variety develops and becomes the Maithili script, which comes into use in Assam, Bengal, and Nepal. The oldest recorded epigraphic proof of the script is found in the Mandar Hill Stone ( bounsi, banka district, bihar ) inscriptions of Adityasena in the 7th century A.D., now fixed in the Baidyanath temple of Deoghar.\n\nEarly Maithili Literature (ca. 700–1350 AD)\n\nThe period compromised of Maithili ballads, Maithili songs, and Maithili dohas. Some important Maithili writers of this era were:\n\nJyotirishwar Thakur(1290–1350) whose Varnartnakar is the first prose and encyclopedia in northern Indian language.\n\nMiddle Maithili Literature (ca. 1350–1830 AD)\n\nThe period was of theatrical writings. Some important Maithili writers of this era were:\n\nVidyapati(1350–1450)\n\nSrimanta Sankardeva(1449–1568)\n\nGovindadas(late 17th century)\n\nModern Maithili Literature (1830 AD to date)\n\nModern Maithili came into its own after George Abraham Grierson, an Irish, diligently researched Maithili lokgeet /folklore and transcribed its grammar. Grierson was said to judge that Maithili and its dialects could moreover be called as the language of the masses of Janakpur, Siraha, Saptari, Sarlahi, Darbhanga and Madhubani”.\n\nBible Society of India , in 2010, a translation of testament into Maithili was published under joint copyright with Nepal Wycliffe Bible Translators.\n\nmagazines and journals brought new development of maithilil in modern era Some important writers of this era are:\n\nAcharya Ramlochan Saran(1889–1971)\n\nBaldev Mishra(1890–1975)\n\nKrishna Kumar Jha ‘Anveshak”, Editor of Maithili Darpan Magazine and author of Mithila Anveshan\n\nSnehlata( 1909–1993).

Shri Ganapati Thakur was his father, who was a Maithil Brahmin. The name Vidyapati is derived from two Sanskrit words, vidya (“knowledge”) and pati (“master”), Implying thereby “a man of knowledge”.\n\nVidyapati father, was a priest in the court of Rāya Gaṇeśvara, the proxy ruler of Tirhut. Infact his great-grandfather, Devāditya Ṭhakkura too was a Minister of War and Peace in the court of Harisimhadeva. Vidyapati also worked in the courts of various chiefs in North Bihar.Its been said he was having two wives, three sons and four daughters.\n\nThe Kīrttilatā gives hint of an incident where the Oiniwar King, Raja Gaṇeśvara, was murdered by the Turkish commander. Malik Arsalan was Turkish commander. By 1401, Vidyapati persuaded Jaunpur Sultan in overthrowing Arsalan and installing Gaṇeśvara’s sons, Vīrasiṃha and Kīrttisiṃha, on the throne. With the Sultan’s assistance, Arsalan was forced to quit the throne and Kīrttisiṃha, the oldest son, became the king of Mithila.\n\nMythology\n\nIn the last six centuries, Vidyapati’s life has been mythologised in myriad ways .His admirers attributes miracles to him and have explained his interaction with the Gods. One of the most important stories is one where Lord Shiva came down to earth to speak with Vidyapati, after being impressed with his righteousness.\n\nVidyapati, is famous for his love songs and prayers for Lord Shiva !!! Vidyapati is known as genesis or co institutor of Maithili Song\n\nMaithili song of Vidyapati are sung by great Maithili singers like Udit Narayan, Sharda Sinha , kunj bihari\n\nCurrently maithili Singer has many new star Singer like Maithili Thakur, Poonam Mishra ,Keshav JHA, Madhav Rai,Rajni Pallavi, Madhvi Madhukar JHA, Adityanath Thakur,Arunita Jha and a few more. Maithili Thakur is most popular and she is a internet sensation now .\n\nAll My Inhibition\n\nAll my inhibition left me in a flash,\n\nWhen he robbed me off my clothes,\n\nBut his body became my new dress.\n\nLike a bee hovering on a lotus leaf\n\nHe was there in my night, on me!\n\nOther works\n\nVidyapati is regarded as father of Maithili Song which comprises bhajan and Lokgeet , but also composed on other topics including ethics, history, geography, and law. A few of his work include.\n\nPuruṣa Parīkṣādeals with moral teachings.Recently Publications Division of Government of India has brought out the Hindi Translation of Purusha Pariksha by Akhilesh Jha. There are 25 stories in the book selected from 44 stories in the original work.

The oldest composition in Brajabuli is attributed to Ramananda Raya, (Godavari province , Governor ), Gajapati Prataprudra Dev,( king of odisha )He was a disciple of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. He recited his Brajabuli poems to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, when he first met him on the bank of river Godavari .\n\nBengali literature\n\nThe clout of the lyrics of Vidyapati on the love of Radha and Krishna on the Bengali poets of the medieval period was so profounding and deep down that they almost replicated all .. As an outcome an literary language was made, which was known as Brajabuli. It was developed in the sixteenth century. Brajabuli is naturally Maithili (as existed during the medieval period) but its forms were altered to look like Bengali. The medieval Bengali poets, Gobindadas Kabiraj, Jnandas, Balaramdas and Narottamdas composed their padas (poems) in this language. Rabindranath Tagore composed his Bhanusingha Thakurer Padabali (1884) Mixture of Western Hindi (Braj Bhasha) and archaic Bengali and christened the language Brajabuli as an imitation of Vidyapati (he initially promoted these lyrics as those of a newly discovered poet, Bhanusingha). Even during Bengal Renaissance in 19 century sri Bankim Chandra Chatterjee have also written in Brajabuli.\n\nTagore was much enchanted and captivated by Vidyapati.. He gave a new tune to Vidyapati’s Bhara badara."
