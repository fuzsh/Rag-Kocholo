        "text": "Sitamarhi is a confusing name as there are two places of identical names i.e. Sitamarhi. One is in Bihar, bordering Nepal and another in Uttar Pradesh, the neighboring state. In Bihar Lady Sita or say Goddess Sita, the wife of Lord Rama emerged from a pitcher while tilling land. When there was no rain for several years, according to the tradition, King Janak, father of Goddess Sita ploughed land to please Lord Indra, deity of Rain in Indian Tradition. As soon as he stuck the spade to soil a lady, from pitcher, emerged. Later the same place was called Sitamarhi in Bihar while the place where Sita assimilated to the land as she was believed to be emerged from land she took her last rest in same land that had given birth to her, is in Uttar Pradesh also called Sitamarhi. Both the places are dedicated to the same Goddess. Sitamarhi has various spellings Sitamadhi, Sitamadi and also called Sita Samahit Sthal.\n\nLegend of Sitamarhi :\n\nAs the legend goes Goddess Laxmi and Lord Vishnu incarnated as Sita and Rama in Treta Yuga. In Indian mythology whole epoch of existence of earth has been divided into four parts i.e. Satyuga, Treta, Dwapara and Kaliyuga. Lord Vishnu was cursed by Sage Narada that he would feel the agony of separation of his beloved as he was humiliated by behavior of Lord Rama in MohiniRupa. As a consequence Lord Rama got separated from his wife Sita when Ravana abducted her while he was in exile. When Lord Rama conquered Ravana and killed him he took his wife to Ayodhya. As the story belongs to the Later Vedic period when much of female’s status in society has deteriorated and chastity of women had become prominent. It is said that Lord Rama was made to prove chastity of her wife as she had spent a long time in Lanka, the abode of Ravana, the demon. To maintain public sentiment Lord Rama sent Sita in exile where she stayed in Ashrama of Sage Valmiki who has written Ramayana, the Sanskrit version. There she gave birth to Luv and Sage made one more infant with his divine power that was named Kusha.\n\nAs traditions, when Lord Rama performed AshwamedhaYajna to prove his might over other rulers his Ashwa (Horse) was captured by Luv and Kusha. When he reached at the place where his horse was tied he was introduced by Sage Valmiki with his own sons. He was also asked to take Sita as she was pious. Rama asked Sita to establish her chastity before people of Ayodhya. Since Sita was innocent, she couldn’t bear the humiliation anymore and asked her mother earth to take her with herself. Soon earth erupted and Sita was submerged into it.\n\nSitamarhi thus carries deep religious values and significance and is considered a holy pilgrimage centers like Prayagraj& Kashi. Today, here stands a magnificent and beautiful Shree SitaSamahit Temple visited by thousands of pilgrim everyday with deep faith and reverence.\n\nThe place is serene and soothing to visitor which also gives you some spiritual inspiration besides architectural and sculptural magnificence.\n\nTemple Traditions :"
