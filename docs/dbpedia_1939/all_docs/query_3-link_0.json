        "text": "This article is about the district. For its eponymous headquarters, see Sitamarhi.\n\nDistrict of Bihar in India\n\nSitamarhi is one of the districts in the Mithila region of the Indian state of Bihar, India. Dumra is the administrative headquarters of this district. The district is a part of the Tirhut Division and is located along the border of Nepal.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThis place is considered as birthplace of Sita, the main character of the epic Ramayana and a temple dedicated to Sita lies near Sitamarhi town.[2] A Rock cut sanctuary of Mauryan period is found near Sitamarhi.[3]\n\nIn 1875, a Sitamarhi subdistrict was created within the Muzaffarpur district.[4] Sitmarhi was detached from Muzaffarpur and became a separate district as of 11 December 1972.[5] It is situated in the northern part of Bihar. The district headquarters is located in Dumra, five kilometers south of Sitamarhi.[clarification needed]\n\nSitamarhi district became a full-fledged district when it was split from Muzaffarpur district in 1972.[6] 1994 saw the split of Sheohar district from Sitamarhi.[6]\n\nThe district was a part of the Red Corridor.The Indian government recently declared it naxal-free.\n\nCommunal riots\n\n[edit]\n\nSitamarhi district has a history of communal riots dating back to the partition of India.[7] In 1948, violence broke out in Belsand, following by riots in 1959 over issue of the Mahavir Flag; roughly 50 people, mostly Muslims, were killed. Further violence occurred around the issue of Durga Mela - these riots began after a false rumour that Muslims had slaughtered a cow, which was eventually found alive. Another riot in 1959 on the issue of cow slaughter killed 11 people, again mostly Muslims, and destroyed 200 houses. Subsequent riots occurred in 1967, 1968, 1969, and 1989.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nSitamarhi district occupies an area of 2,294 square kilometres (886 sq mi),[8] comparatively equivalent to Australia's Groote Eylandt.[9]\n\nIt is bordered by Nepal to the north, Madhubani district to the east, Darbhanga and Muzaffarpur districts to the south, and Sheohar and East Champaran districts to the west.\n\nIt is situated on a flood plain. In August 2019, Sitamarhi district suffered heavy flooding.\n\nPolitics\n\n[edit]\n\nThis section is transcluded from 17th Bihar Assembly.\n\nDistrict No. Constituency Name Party Alliance Remarks Sitamarhi 23 Riga Moti Lal Prasad BJP NDA 24 Bathnaha Anil Kumar BJP NDA 25 Parihar Gayatri Devi Yadav BJP NDA 26 Sursand Dilip Kumar Ray JD(U) NDA 27 Bajpatti Mukesh Kumar Yadav RJD MGB 28 Sitamarhi Mithilesh Kumar BJP NDA 29 Runnisaidpur Pankaj Kumar Mishra JD(U) NDA 30 Belsand Sanjay Kumar Gupta RJD MGB\n\nBlock\n\n[edit]\n\n1.

It is situated on the Darbhanga Narkatiaganj railway line and has the largest railway station of the district. Another broad gauge track, running between Muzaffarpur and Sitamarhi. Direct train services are available to places such as New Delhi, Kolkata, Varanasi, Hyderabad and Kanpur. State highways link it to the Madhubani (to the east) and Sheohar (to the west) districts. Railway lines connect Sitamarhi to Darbhanga in east, and to Muzaffarpur in the south and to Raxaul in the west. Sitamarhi has a railway junction. Sitamarhi railway station is on the Raxaul-Darbhanga rail route.\n\nThe nearest airport to Sitamarhi is the Darbhanga Airport which is about 70 km from Sitamarhi.\n\nThe Sitamarhi-Bhitthamore Road is important for religious reasons as it connects Janakpur, which houses a 200-year-old Janki Temple with Sitamarhi—considered to be the birth place of Goddess Sita.\n\nNational Highway 227 passes through Bhitthamore. Thus it is a gateway to Janakpur, Nepal and other parts of Sitamarhi & Madhubani.\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical populationYearPop.±% p.a.1901782,557— 1911807,936+0.32%1921782,221−0.32%1931835,055+0.66%1941921,265+0.99%1951999,655+0.82%19611,158,546+1.49%19711,323,793+1.34%19811,627,716+2.09%19912,013,796+2.15%20012,682,720+2.91%20113,423,574+2.47%source:[11]\n\nAccording to the 2011 census Sitamarhi district has a population of 3,423,574,[13] roughly equal to the nation of Panama[14] or the US state of Connecticut.[15] This gives it a ranking of 96th in India (out of a total of 640).[13] The district has a population density of 1,491 inhabitants per square kilometre (3,860/sq mi).[13] Its population growth rate over the decade 2001-2011 was 27.47%.[13] Sitamarhi has a sex ratio of 899 females for every 1000 males,[13] and a literacy rate of 53.53%. 5.56% of the population lives in urban areas.
