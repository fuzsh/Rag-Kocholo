        "text": "Tourist Places To Visit In Sitamarhi\n\nPlanning A Trip To Sitamarhi? Here's our list of top tourist places to visit in Sitamarhi\n\nSitamarhi, the headquarters of the district of Sitamarhi is located in Bihar’s Mithila region. It is considered by a large number of Hindus to be the place of birth of Sita, the queen of Raja Ram of the epic Ramayana. Sitamarhi comes to life especially during Ram Navami, the day Ram was born. There are a few tourist places to visit in Sitamarhi although one could go to nearby places that are worth a visit as well. The majority of the sight seeing places are related to Hindu temples but that is only to be expected since Sitamarhi is closely related to Ramayana. When you have generally visited the places of tourism in Sitamarhi you may like to go to Patna which is around 120km from Sitamarhi.\n\nHaleshwar Sthan\n\nPhotograph by sitamarhi.nic.in\n\nHaleshwar Sthan is a charming place of worship for the Hindus. Dedicated to Lord Shiva, Haleshwar Sthan is believed to have been founded on the holy occasion of Putra Yeshti Yagya by the famous King Videha. The temple was thereafter named Haleshwarnath Temple and the place called Haleshwar Sthan. The temple has a fairly large number of devotees on a daily basis and this of course becomes a large gathering on the occasion of Shivratri.\n\nPanth Pakar\n\nPhotograph by https://www.tripoto.com\n\nThere is a banyan tree which is located about 8km away from Sitamarhi. This tree, according to folklore is supposed to be the tree under which Sita had stopped and rested for a while on her way to Ayodhya after her wedding had taken place. This is quite a popular tree for visitors that arrive in Sitamarhi. A decent tourist spot, Panth Pakar is well maintained as well. Sitamarhi is quite a laid back town and when you visit this place do make sure that you do not miss out Panth Pakar.\n\nSita Temple\n\nPhotograph by https://www.tripadvisor.in\n\nDedicated to Goddess Sita, the Sita Temple was constructed only about 100 years back. Inside the temple you will find statues in stone of the brothers Ram and Laxman and of course of Sita. There is a spring which is located fairly close to the temple. This is believed to be the site where Sita, as a baby, was found lying in a furrow. Local folklore says that a Hindu sadhu called Birbal Das discovered this temple just by chance. The place is only 1.5km from the railway station and is celebrated as the place where Sita was born while Janaki Kund is close by to the south of this temple. If you wish to see some excitement you must come here during Navratri and the Ram Navami festivities. Janaki Kund is supposed to be the place where baby Sita was bathed by King Janak who adopted Sita.\n\nPupri\n\nPhotograph by youtube.com\n\nPupri in Bihar is well known for its famous temple of Lord Shiva, known as the Baba Nageshwarnath temple. According to legend Lord Shiva is said to have made his appearance here. The temple is visited by large number of devotees. The crowd is that much larger during Shivratri. The temple is beautiful and inviting. It has been maintained well too. Visitors will gain if they could visit the temple during Maha Shivratri.\n\nHanuman Mandir\n\nPhotograph by youtube.com\n\nThere is a beautiful temple of Hanumanji at Sitamarhi. Known as Hanuman Mandir, Sitamarhi, it is an ideal location for you to spend some quality time with your family. The temple is attractive as a tourist spot with spacious and clean grounds.

Established more than 25 years ago the temple has a beautiful idol of the Vaishnav Mata and it is this idol that continues to draw large number of devotees. According to local residents the Mata fulfils the desires of all devotees. It is this factor that attracts large number of devotees who visit the temple especially during Sharadiya Navaratri and Chaitra.\n\nBairagnia\n\nPhotograph by daanapaani.net\n\nBairagnia is about 32km from Sitamarhi and is located near Motihari, the place where Gandhiji was placed in prison in the year 1917. There are a few major attractions at or near Bairagnia. These include the temple that is dedicated to Shiva at a village called Areraj. The other major attraction consists of two Ashoka edicts. One of these is located at Lauria Areraj and the other is at Ramgarhwa. All these attractions are located fairly close to each other.\n\nPatna\n\nPhotograph by https://www.goibibo.com\n\nPatna is about 120km from Sitamarhi. So if you have spare time you may like to extend your stay in Sitamarhi by a road trip to Patna where you can visit Kumhrar, the historic city that was the predecessor to Pataliputra, which formed the foundation of today’s Patna. At Kumhrar you will see the ancient monuments going back to the proud days of the Mauryan Empire. Visit the Gandhi Maidan the place where many a fiery speech was made towards our Freedom Struggle. See the Buddha Smriti Park which has the ashes of Lord Buddha and the saplings of the Bodhi Tree."
