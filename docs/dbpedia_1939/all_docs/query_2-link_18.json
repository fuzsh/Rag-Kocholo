I rapidly tried to find a poem about writing poetry, but did not find any suitable poem. I asked my Spanish translator, a living poetry encyclopedia, but the few poems he proposed were rather negative and I found that for that occasion we should have a positive poem. He reminded me as well that I have written several poems about poetry. Why I should not use one of them, he asked? Since recently two of my short poems have been published, I was a bit hesitating, but finally I let me be convinced. I hopeyou will like the poem as well. The poem is from my – not yet published next book The Restlessness of the Word. In Dutch it is a quite strong poem as some words have a double meaning.\n\nIn Dutch verloren woorden lichten, is quite poetic and has even a double sense “lichten” not only means to RAISE / DIG UP but also to LIGHT UP.\n\nVERGEETPUT means literary Pit of Forgetting. Actually, in my poetry, I use sometimes neologisms as well as words which are hardly used anymore to strengthen the image or the sound, “Forgotten” words.\n\nThank you in advance for your translation\n\nBest wishes\n\nGermainAttachments area\n\nWRITING POETRY\n\nMaking audible\n\nthe inaudible\n\nlifting lost words\n\nfrom the dungeon of Time\n\npenetrating\n\ninto the deepest of being.\n\nGermain Drogenbroodt\n\nTRANSLATION INTO TAMIL\n\nதமிழில்\n\nகவிதை எழுதுதல்\n\nகேட்கமுடியாததைக்\n\nகேட்கும் வகையில்\n\nமறைந்த சொற்களை\n\nகாலமெனும் இருட்டறையிலிருந்து\n\nமேலெழுப்பி\n\nவாழ்வின் ஆழத்திற்கு ஊடுருவி\n\nஉருவாக்குதல்!!!!\n\nTranslation into English by GERMAIN of Spain.\n\nHeld every year on this day 21st March, WORLD POETRY DAY celebrating one of the most treasured forms of cultural and linguistic expression and identity. Practiced throughout history- in every continent and culture- poetry speaks to our common humanity and our shared values, transforming the simplest of poems into a powerful catalyst for dialogue, discussion and peace.\n\nUNESCO first adopted 21 March as World Poetry Day during its 30th General Conference in Paris in 1999, with the aim of supporting linguistic diversity through poetic expression and increasing the opportunity for endangered languages to be heard. World Poetry Day is the occasion to honour poets, revive oral traditions of poetry recitals, promote the reading, writing and teaching of poetry, foster the convergence between poetry and other arts such as theatre, dance, music and painting, and raise the visibility of poetry in the media. As poetry continues to bring people together across continents, all are invited to join in.\n\nMESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL\n\n“Arranged in words, coloured with images, struck with the right meter, poetry has a power that has no match. This is the power to shake us from everyday life and the power to remind us of the beauty that surrounds us and of the resilience of the human spirit.”\n\n— Audrey Azoulay, Director-General, on the occasion of 2020 World Poetry Day\n\nOn this great day we recollect poets of repute in thousands throughout the world in hundreds of languages specially translated ones..\n\nWith pride and pleasure we recollect the great poets like John Milton, Keats, Shelley, Kaalidas, Mahakavi Bharathiyaar,\n\nHerein below is given the list of great Indian poets languagewise :\n\nAssamese\n\nAmulya Barua (1922–1946), first published posthumously in 1964\n\nAtul Chandra Hazarika (1903–1986), poet, dramatist, children’s story writer and translator\n\nBhabananda Deka (born 1929), writer, poet, critic, columnist, playwright\n\nGanesh Gogoi (born 1907–1938)\n\nHem Barua (1915–1977), poet and politician\n\nLakshminath Bezbarua, a doyen of Assamese literature\n\nChandra Kumar Agarwala, Romantic poet\n\nHemchandra Goswami, Romantic poet\n\nAmbikagiri Raichoudhury, Romantic poet\n\nHiren Bhattacharya (1932–2012), writer, poet, critic, columnist and editor\n\nHomen Borgohain (born 1932), writer, poet, critic, columnist and editor\n\nJyoti Prasad Agarwala (1903–1953), playwright, songwriter, poet, writer and film maker\n\nBishnu Prasad Rabha (KolaGuru)\n\nNabakanta Barua, also known as Ekhud Kokaideu (1926–2002), novelist and poet\n\nNilmani Phookan (born 1933)\n\nHarekrishna Deka (born 1942), poet, fiction writer, and critic\n\nRahim Bora (born 1930), poet, fiction writer\n\nBengali\n\nAbul Bashar (born 1951), poet and writer\n\nAnnadashankar Roy (1905–2002)\n\nBharatchandra Ray (1712–1760), Raygunakar, Shakta court poet and song writer in Krishnanagar\n\nBinoy Majumdar (1934–2006), Indian poet\n\nBishnu Dey (1909–1982), poet, prose writer, movie critic\n\nBuddhadeb Basu (also spelled “Buddhadeva Bose”) (1908–1974), poet, novelist, short-story writer and essayist\n\nChandidas (born 1408 CE), refers to (possibly more than one) medieval poet\n\nDwijendralal Ray (1863–1913), poet, playwright, and musician, known primarily for patriotic plays and songs, as well as Hindu devotional lyrics\n\nGovindadasa, Medieval Vaishanavite poet\n\nHumayun Kabir (1906–1969), poet, educationalist, politician, writer, philosopher\n\nIswarchandra Gupta (1812–1859), poet and writer\n\nJatindramohan Bagchi (1878–1948)\n\nJatindranath Sengupta (1887–1954), poet and writer\n\nJibanananda Das (1899–1954)\n\nJoy Goswami (born 1954), Indian poet\n\nKazi Nazrul Islam (also spelled “Kazi Nozrul Islam”) (1899–1976), poet, musician, revolutionary, and philosopher\n\nKrittibas Ojha (also spelled “Krittivas Ojha”), medieval poet\n\nMalay Roy Choudhury (born 1939), founder of the Hungry generation movement\n\nMallika Sengupta (born 1960), poet and writer\n\nMichael Madhusudan Dutta (also spelled “Maikel Modhushudôn Dôtto” and “Datta”) (1824–1873), born Madhusudan Dutt, poet and dramatist\n\nNabaneeta Dev Sen (Nôbonita Deb Shen) (born 1938), writer and poet\n\nNabinchandra Sen (1847–1909), poet and writer\n\nKazi Nazrul Islam (1899–1976), poet, national poet of Bangladesh, novelist, short story writer, dramatist, singer, composer, essayist, translator, and movie director\n\nPremendra Mitra (1904–1988), poet, novelist, short-story writer, including thrillers and science fiction\n\nPrabhat Ranjan Sarkar (1921–1990), known for Prabhat Samgiita\n\nPurnendu Patri (born 1930), poet, novelist, artist and film maker\n\nRabindranath Tagore (1861–1941), Indian poet who won the 1913 Nobel Prize in Literature\n\nRamprasad Sen (1718–1775), Shakta court poet\n\nShankha Ghosh (born 1932), poet and critic\n\nSamir Roychoudhury (1933–2016), post-modern poet, short story writer, critic and editor\n\nSubhash Mukhopadhyay (Shubhash Mukhopaddhae) (1919–2003)\n\nSubhro Bandopadhyay (born 1978), poet\n\nSubodh Sarkar (born 1958), poet\n\nSudhindranath Dutta\n\nSukanta Bhattacharya (1926–1947), poet\n\nSukumar Ray (1987–1923), humorous poet, short-story writer and playwright\n\nSunil Gangopadhyay (Shunil Gônggopaddhae) (born 1934), Indian poet, novelist\n\nSyed Kawsar Jamal (born 1950), Indian poet and essayist\n\nrapada Roy (1936–2007), poet, essayist and short-story writer, short stories, and essays, humourist\n\nIndian poets writing in English\n\nIn alphabetical order by first name:\n\nA.
