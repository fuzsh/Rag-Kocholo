The Indo-Aryan and the Dravidian are the dominant groups and together comprises all the major Languages of India.\n\nBihari language belong to first one.\n\nIndo-Aryan:\n\nIt is part of the Indo-European family of languages, which came to India with the Aryans.\n\nIt is the biggest of the language groups in India and accounts for about 74% of the total Indian population.\n\nIt comprises of all the principal languages of northern and western India such as Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Gujarati, Punjabi, Sindhi, Rajasthani, Assamese, Oriya, Pahari, Bihari, Kashmiri, Urdu and Sanskrit.\n\nLinguistic Identities in Bihar\n\nOn the basis of language-cum-culture, the present day Bihar can be divided into four distinct categories of subregional identities – Maithili, Bhojpuri, Magadhi and the tribal language(s) of the Jharkhand region.\n\nGrierson has described the language of Bihar as Bihari, 4 which in his scheme of classification belongs to the Eastern group of Hindi, covering an area of 90,000 square miles and is spoken by the 36,000,000 people from the Himalayas on the north to Singhbhum on the South, and from Manbhum on the South-east to Basti on the north-west.\n\nMagadhi\n\nThe word ‘Maghi’ is a deviant of sanskrit word Magadhi. And the region in which this dialect is spoken is referred as Magadha.\n\nThe ancient land of Magadha now roughly corresponds to the present districts of Patna and northern half of Gaya district.\n\nThough the Magahi language extends to the other parts of Bihar such as Na landa, Aurangabad, Nawada, Monghyr, Gir idih, Hazar ibagh, Dhanbad, North-eastern Palamau, Northern Ranchi and the other parts of Bihar, the purest form of Magahi is preserved only in the districts of Patna and Gaya.\n\nThis may be referred as a ‘core region’ of the Magahi language.\n\nCore region preserves not only the purity of dialect and cultural distinctiveness, it also helps in the determination of and sealing in the variation of the dialect or language.
