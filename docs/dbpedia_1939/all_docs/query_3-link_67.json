In a surprising turn of events, Mahabali Hanuman was sent by Lord Rama to retrieve the horse, only to be captured by Luv and Kush as well.\n\nLord Rama himself had to intervene and visit the Sita Samahit Sthal to uncover the identity of the formidable warriors who had bested his army. It was then revealed that Luv and Kush were none other than his own sons.

Upon entering through the main gate, visitors are greeted with a majestic depiction of Mother Sita in her royal form, reflecting her life in the grand palace of Ayodhya. However, as one descends to the lower level of the temple, they will encounter a statue of Mother Sita in the guise of a sanyasini, symbolizing her second exile to the forest and the hardships she endured while living as a recluse in sage Valmiki’s ashram.\n\nIt is at this lower level of the temple that Mother Sita fervently prayed to Jagat Janani Mother Bhagwati, seeking validation of her unwavering devotion to Lord Ram. Overwhelmed by the burden of proving her purity in a world that doubted her, Mother Sita beseeched Mother Bhagwati to appear and take her into her embrace. Moved by Mother Sita’s plea, the earth split open, and Mother Bhagwati manifested herself. Before returning to the earth, Mother Sita entrusted her sons Lav and Kush to Lord Ram, signifying her ultimate sacrifice.\n\nMother Sita’s origins can be traced back to Punaura village in Sitamarhi, Bihar, where she emerged from the earth during a time of famine in King Janak’s kingdom. Upon King Janak’s plough striking a metal object and unearthing a pot containing a beautiful girl, he adopted her as his daughter, naming her Sita due to her emergence from the earth. Just as Mother Sita emerged from the earth, she eventually returned to it, symbolizing the cyclical nature of life and the eternal bond between humanity and the earth.\n\nLocated within this temple is a unique form of Kush grass that is exclusive to this sacred site. Legend has it that Mother Sita herself used to comb her hair here, resulting in the grass growing in the likeness of her flowing locks. Even today, women come to worship this special grass, which can be found at the lower part of the temple entrance.\n\nSurrounded by a forested area, the temple boasts a serene atmosphere.

Adjacent to it stands a towering 108-foot statue of Hanuman, a beloved devotee of Lord Ram and Mother Janaki. The statue is designed to resemble a mountain with caves, housing statues of Lord Ram, Lakshman, Mother Janaki, and Hanuman.\n\nThe Hanuman temple complex exudes a sense of tranquility, providing a respite from the outside world. Lush green lawns and cozy huts under dense trees offer visitors a peaceful retreat. The massive Hanuman statue has become a popular attraction, serving as a focal point for selfies and admiration.\n\nThe statue of Hanuman Ji is the largest in Uttar Pradesh and is also recognized as one of the largest statues in the world.

Born into a Brahmin family in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, Swami ji was a well-known lawyer before he embarked on his spiritual journey. Settling in Rishikesh, he pondered a question that had long troubled him: while religious texts and Puranas abound with references to Lord Ram, there seemed to be a glaring absence of any mention of the burial place of Mother Sita.\n\nDrawing from the Valmiki Ramayana and Tulsi Geetawali, Swami ji was convinced that Mother Sita’s final resting place must be along the banks of the Ganga. Determined to uncover the truth, he embarked on a 900-kilometer journey on foot, scouring the ghats of the Ganga in search of the sacred site.\n\nHis quest led him to Sitamarhi, where he discovered an ancient temple dedicated to Sage Valmiki. Convinced that this forested region, also known as Baripur or Bankat, was where Mother Sita had been absorbed into the earth, Swami ji decided to make this his home. Embracing a life of austerity, he devoted himself to sadhana, subsisting on the offerings of the villagers and immersing himself in prayer.\n\nOne fateful night, Mother Sita appeared to Swami ji in a dream, revealing the exact location where she had been absorbed into the earth. Encouraged by this divine intervention, Swami ji set out to build the temple, guided by the signs and symbols mentioned in the scriptures. Through his unwavering faith and determination, he was able to pinpoint the precise spot where Mother Sita had merged with the earth, ensuring that her legacy would be honored for generations to come.Therefore, he initiated the construction of the temple by establishing the Satyanarayan Shriprakash Punj Trust in Delhi.\n\nAccommodation Facility\n\nIf you are visiting from out of town and looking for accommodations, there is a well-appointed, air-conditioned hotel within the temple complex, as well as several guest houses nearby.
