        "text": "Sitamarhi Sitamarhi is a witness to the Treta Yuga, the mythological and religious place of the district of Dipta with the glory of the Taposthali of Maharishi Valmiki, the place of exile of Mother Sita, the birthplace of Lord Sri Ram’s sons, Luv and Kush, and the glory of the site containing Sita. Mata Sita is embedded in every particle of this place. The site has been authenticated by Saint Shiromani Goswami Tulsidas ji through the verses of his poetic poetry – where Valmiki Bhaoya Huntsman to Munindra. The monk, born to Siya, was born to Love-Kush. Baripur-Digpur Beach Bilasati Bhoomi. This has been confirmed by Saint Beni Madhav Ji in the Gosain character. Digpur-Baripur Beach Sitamarhi. Presently, there is also the village of Digpur (Digh) in East Baripur and West direction of Sitamarhi.\n\nExplaining the importance of this holy place, it is the place where Maharishi Valmiki composed the epic poem Ramayana with the inspiration of the grace of Brahma. The Maharishi Valmiki ashram here has the sanctum sanctorum of the exile of the second exile for the protection of Sita’s sattva, the ideal form of all mothers in the ashram. Where Maharishi was educated by Lav-Kush Kumar and defeated his Chaturangini army after holding the horse of Rama’s Ashwamedha yagna.\n\nSitamarhi, the site of Sitamarhi, contains the temple to show the entry of Mother Sita to the earth. Even when Maharishi Valmiki had certified purity on the order of Shree Ram for the protection of true form of Sattva on the last union of Sita Ji and Rama, Mother Sita herself stood forever in the lap of Mother Earth for authenticity of Purity. It is believed that when Sita started going into the lap of the earth, Shri Ram ji took hold of her hair, which is still present around the temple containing Sita. It is known as Sita Kesh. Women pay obeisance to Sitakesh with reverence. This gives them the desired fruit. Especially in the month of Shravan, women pray for Sita’s hairstyle and make adornment and wish for their unbroken beauty. Presently, the grand Sita temple of the site containing Sita, the world famous 108 feet tall Hanuman ji idol is the center of major attraction for the devotees and tourists.\n\nInset\n\nOdia crowd throngs Baba’s ashram\n\nThe 125-year-old saint Oriya Baba continues to teach morality lessons to devotees at the ashram on the banks of the Ganges. The ancient Sita Temple and Maharishi Valmiki Ashram are among the historical sites. Deenbandhu Deenanath Mauni Baba, who is engaged in grand and huge temple construction (Sitadham) work, is known for his faith and faith in people. Now I am going to finish it hope you enjoyed this journey with Bharat Darshan2:0.\n\nThanks for visiting"
