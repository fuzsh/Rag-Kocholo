        "text": "Born at 6am in the 14th arrondissement in Paris, 28th September 1942, Pierre Clémenti died in the same city, of liver cancer, Monday 27th December 1999; days before the end of the century. He never knew his father, who was said to have been killed in the war, and instead took his name from his Corsican mother.\n\nHe discovered poetry at reform school as a young teenager, and his love of it lasted a lifetime. After working as a bellboy at the Hotel Littré in the late 1950s, where he managed to sell a few poems to a female guest he’d spent the night with, he was able to concentrate on hanging out with his friends in Saint Germain. On these streets he was fatefully sidetracked into an acting career that became symbolic of so many aspects of European cinema of the time: experimentalism, anarchy, androgyny, anti-heroism, surrealism and pariah culture.\n\nPierre Clémenti, actor for Buñuel, Garrel, and Bertolucci, was a brilliant filmmaker, free, poetic, adventurous, madly in love with editing and color. Recently, three 16mm films were found where he left them 20 years ago, at the Pompidou Centre (whose original director had been granted him an editing room for life back in the day). Three films made of dazzling rushes accumulated over 15 years, edited for years, and, unfortunately in a pretty bad condition. Their restoration on film was the only way to elevate them to where they belong, while respecting the format chosen by the artist.\n\nIt’s in 1967, with the money he earned acting in Michel Deville’s Benjamin, that Pierre Clémenti bought his first 16mm Beaulieu camera. During the next 15 years he never stopped filming, during shoots, during trips, at home, amongst friends and family. Certainly influenced by the psychedelic movement, he began a filmmaking career abundant with color, rock music, poetic eroticism, and references to psychotropic experiences."
