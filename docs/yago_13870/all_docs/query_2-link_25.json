        "text": "In the enigmatic world of director Justine Triet's third film, \"Anatomy of a Fall,\" suspense unfurls like a darkly comic tapestry in the courtrooms, earning it the prestigious Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. The central question echoes through the narrative: Did Sandra kill her husband, Samuel, or is there more to the story than meets the eye? The film intricately explores not only the literal fall of Samuel, scrutinized through forensic eccentricities and a simulated fatal plunge but also the figurative descent of Sandra as her life becomes dissected during the trial. As the legal proceedings unfold, justice takes on a surreal form, less concerned with truth than the perception of it. Sandra's character, portrayed with remarkable depth by Hüller, becomes the focal point of a turbulent marriage, laid bare under the pressures of money, ambition, and parenthood. The courtroom becomes a stage for humiliation, where even her fiction writing is questioned, revealing the fine line between reality and imagination. \"Anatomy of a Fall\" is a clever, cutting, and nimble exploration of relationships, justice, and the unsettling intersection of fiction and reality. Triet's meticulous storytelling, sharp courtroom sparring, and a clever ending make this 2.5-hour mystery an engaging journey into the complexities of the human psyche.\n\n*I know I am late with this* Foreword: The world is astoundingly complex, we live today in times of unprecedentedly severe threats to our (dignified) existence, and there is so much to be done in so many areas. At the same time, it feels deeply exciting to be a contemporary of the #Barbie film, which I perceived as a great reminder of the freedom people have achieved (ie fought for) to openly share perspectives. The film has definitely made me realize how much I don't understand about others' perspectives and predicaments. Hopefully, I will now be more open to them. I invite everyone who has not yet seen them film to do so with full dedication. Because also, it is just a darn good film, with a good story (yes, basic at times), and very good acting. And yes, SPOILERS in the article.\n\nThere is a controversy about Bradley Cooper's giant prosthetic nose that he's using in his portrayal of famously-large nosed man Leonard Bernstein in the upcoming film MAESTRO. The backlash against the nose is two-fold: 1. That's a dumb-looking nose and like Nicole Kidman's borderline obscene nose in THE HOURS, I am unable to appreciate the performance because I cannot stop staring at that enormous honker. 2. Jews with big noses is an anti-semitic trope. Also Bradley Cooper is not a Jew and how dare he! As the world has been waiting for me to weigh in on this, here we go. In terms of #1, I don't disagree, but I'm sure it will be fine. We'll get used to it. Is it silly? It is. But also from a publicist's perspective, this does not bother me. The studio was lightning quick to release a positive statement from the Bernstein family (so fast that I'd bet money that had it ready to go prior), and this is a lot of great awareness that the film might not otherwise have had. The kids are not clamoring for more Leonard Bernstein representation. In terms of #2... This is incredibly stupid. I say this as a Jew and also a thinking person. Cooper *loves* Bernstein and chose to use the nose because Bernstein has an enormous nose. Cooper also has a big nose, but all noses are not created equal, and if this is what BCoops needs to get there, more power to him. The second part of that question - should a non-Jew be playing a Jew? - is a bit thornier. My rule of thumb is this. If a people from a minority group (in this case Jews) - routinely play characters not in that group (in this case non-Jews) then the reverse is fine too. So Jews can play Italians and Italians can play Jews and Brits can play Americans and Americans can play Brits. But trans folks very rarely are up for non-trans parts (I can think of a single actress off the top of my head who is an exception), so cis-gendered actors shouldn't be taking trans parts. Little people don't get parts for people of typical height (Hugh Grant in Willy Wonka isn't playing a little person - he's playing a fantasy character. That's different.), so in hindsight Gary Oldman shouldn't be playing a little person in Tiptoes (google it). Native American actors shouldn't have Native American characters taken from them, because there aren't enough of those roles out there. The yardstick should be about not taking parts away from actors who are already limited in their ability to win roles by the industry. It shouldn't be about \"But a non-Jew can't play a Jewish role.\" They are actors after all. https://lnkd.in/eZrHbPZS"
