        "text": "Energy, excitement, and creativity are just a few words to describe what John Sellman, Jr. delivers through his abilities as a creative. As a writer, director, singer, songwriter, musician, producer, actor and even radio host, John continues to wear many hats in the arts. His presence in society is represented by his passion and drive to create great works.\n\nJohn began his journey in film as a music producer and actor in 2017 for the stage play, turned movie, “What If\", produced by a Baltimore based production company lead by Sharee Harris. In that production, he assumed partial responsibility as the Second Assistant Director. He would continue to solidify those roles for the movie \"Broken\", 2019 and various on screen projects. In 2020 John took on a new challenge as a screen writer, and also making his directorial debut for the highly anticipated movie “For All Have Sinned”. “We all have a story, put a beat behind it and share your song with the world.” -John Sellman, Jr.\n\nAllan Piper may be best known to some viewers for his live fact-checks of the former president. Allan was NowThis' supervising politics producer throughout the Trump presidency, which was a different kind of horror story.\n\neVil Sublet is Allan's third feature film. He produced and directed the George-Takei-narrated documentary, Married and Counting, which tells the story of two men in pre-marriage-equality America who celebrated 25 years together by traveling the country to get married in every state that would let them. Huffington Post called it “one of the most relevant, heartfelt, and timely documentaries of the year… a brilliant gem.” Allan’s first feature was the cult comedy, Starving Artists, which the Boston Globe called one of “the best films you’ve probably never seen.”\n\nHaving worked as a filmmaker for both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, Allan is the only person ever to do online video rapid response for multiple presidential nominees. Allan also has produced and/or edited TV shows for networks including ABC, CNN, Bravo, MTV, TLC, Discovery, Food Network, History Channel, Travel Channel, Animal Planet, and PBS.\n\nAs an adolescent, John Barnhardt devoured every film in every genre he could get his hands on, as a film student he would stay late in college and take on extra projects, who’s dreamed of a film career since age nine, when he watched The Road Warrior with his father. “I want to make movies,” Barnhardt announced to his father as they walked out of the theater. “Good,” his dad replied. An engineer by trade and avid photographer, Barnhardt’s father put a camera in his son’s hands and from that moment on fueled his hunger. “My dad was a true forward thinker, an artist; he saturated me with movies. We’d watch The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now; my dad never filtered what I saw. He loved the classics, too. We’d watch everything then talk about it.”\n\nAfter graduating from Colorado State, with a degree in English and Poetry, Barnhardt followed his heart to Charleston, South Carolina, where he began the slow crawl up the film ladder, starting at the bottom working in the Channel Four Newsroom; where he ran the teleprompter, working for peanuts. While he was working his way up the ranks at Channel Four, Barnhardt was taking college classes from Professor Russell Schaaf at Trident Technical College; filming anything and everything he could, including gore-drenched, god-awful (but well-shot) horror flicks, many staged in his Park Circle home. By doing this John founded his Barnfly Productions company as well as slowly expanded his portfolio. When Schaaf, his Trident professor and mentor, mentioned that they needed someone to teach a 16mm film class, Barnhardt jumped at the opportunity and spent the next eight years teaching first as an adjunct, then full-time faculty member, amassing an entourage of appreciative students, while honing his own technical expertise. After Trident, Barnhardt went out to build his portfolio even more. As Director/Cinematographer for Born to Explore with Richard Wiese—part of Charleston-based Litton Entertainments Saturday “Weekend Adventure” block on ABC—Barnhardt has traveled the globe, filming thrilling footage nearly face-to-face with gorillas in the Ugandan Jungle; slogging through pools of pigeon poo in Morocco; photographing crocodiles, elephants, you name it. And since winning the Outstanding Achievement in Single Camera Photography Emmy for it. Barnhardt’s no-holds-barred approach, his relentless push back against mediocrity and complacency, and his deep gratitude to his father and his friends shows, is felt and experienced in all his work.\n\nA quest for redemption is unfolding in Washington, D.C. Thanks to forward-looking “second chance” legislation, three men who were sentenced in their youth to life in prison have the chance to plead for release. The film captures their journeys as they unfold: Anthony “Pete” Petty, who has just won his freedom and must rebuild his life after three decades in prison; Gene Downing, who awaits his second chance hearing after two decades behind bars and hopes to reunite with a daughter born after his incarceration; and Colie Levar Long, who is mentoring youth incarcerated with him at D.C. Jail. He longs to finish college as a free man after a 26-year interruption. D.C. is leading the way with second chance reform, a transformational criminal justice movement spreading across the country. But, as the film shows, a second chance is never guaranteed.\n\nWynette Yao is an award-winning filmmaker who has produced, directed and written films on subjects as wide-ranging as Egypt, tornadoes, bees and bog mummies. She relishes image-making and storytelling that brings alive the human experience behind history, science, and modern life.\n\nIn 2018, Yao joined FAMM Foundation, a non-profit that advocates for criminal justice reform. She has been grateful to make videos, spots and long-form documentaries aimed at fighting for a more fair and effective justice system, including the award-winning “Half of Us,” “The Vanishing Trial” (Bronx Social Justice Matters Festival, 1st Place, Documentary Shorts) and the newly-released feature documentary, “District of Second Chances.”\n\nYao’s previous work includes “Oceans at the Tipping Point” (Winner of the Innovation Award, Blue Ocean Film Festival), “Who Betrayed Anne Frank?” (Winner of the Gold Remi Award, Worldfest Houston Film Festival), and “All Quiet on the Western Front’ (Nominated for a National Emmy Award, Historical Documentaries).\n\nBIOGRAPHY FOR TRAVIS EDWARDS\n\nEver since creating his first films as a kid with nothing more than a Betamax camera and a little ambition, Travis’s film career has spanned everything from stop-motion animation to both fiction and narrative features.\n\nHe primarily lives behind the camera and in front of the edit screen, finding ways to creatively tell stories that can impact people’s hearts and minds.\n\n*4:00pm Screening followed by a conversation with the director, Anina Belle Giannini and Le Chef Sébastien Giannini\n\nAnina Belle Giannini is a Canadian American hotelier, writer, and passionate home cook.
