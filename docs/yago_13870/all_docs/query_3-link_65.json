        "text": "“I have written all kinds of stories—humorous ones, for teenagers, for kids, and stories that border on the fantastical. But I particularly like to write about lonely people and things happening to them,” Satyajit Ray famously said in a 1989 interview to Pierre-André Boutang.\n\nTo say that Netflix’s Ray is simply about things happening to lonely people would be ignoring its many nuances and reducing it to just this one aspect. Because the four stories couldn’t be more diametrically opposed to each other. And yet a common thread runs across all of them—the sheer vulnerability of the human mind. The production designers had their task cut out for them—they could go all out but within the four corners of Ray’s vision. Let’s take a deep dive into how they managed to do the same.\n\nForget Me Not: Designing Narcissism\n\nThis Ali Fazal-starrer deals with the delusions of a deeply self-centred man who has consciously failed everyone around him—his wife, co-workers, his childhood friends and even an unborn baby. For a while, even the audience does not realise the full extent of his narcissism. And production designer Anasuya Sengupta’s set design had to be aligned with the same: “With his decline, the arrogance and confidence of the world the viewer sees declines too. With this in mind, we tried to keep the opulence unmissable in the earlier scenes—in his home, his office and luxury hotels.”\n\nAs narcissists often are, Fazal’s character is also a deeply lonely man despite being blessed with the best the world has to offer. And Sengupta was conscious of weaving the same in the film’s larger design aesthetic. “We turned the rich man’s loneliness into a design theme in itself,” she elaborates. “This was done by first suppressing the gloominess as an undertone and then letting it fully take over by the end, in the asylum.”\n\nThe asylum was created by completely overhauling an entire floor of the Golden Tobacco Factory located in Mumbai. And careful attention was given to aspects like the ageing of the walls, installing appropriate grills and bars on windows, using wet floors and scribbles on the walls—all of it to create a sense of impending doom.\n\nBahrupiya: Documenting Madness\n\nOften hailed as one of Ray’s darkest works, this short is a layered commentary on the limits of the human mind and the heavy price we often pay for not realising the same. KK Menon is at his vulnerable best in the character of Indrashish, a man who considers himself almost akin to God because of the superior makeup tools bequeathed to him by his grandmother.\n\nThe space he works in, which features largely in the film, mirrors the haze in his mind. And production designer Shibaji Pal had to capture the same, down to the brass tacks. “For the design scheme of this story, we developed a Bengal School style of poetic surrealism—this mixes fantasy and dark imagery around the themes of Calcutta. Mostly we experimented with various table props, the wall texture with a washed light accent and subdued curtain patterns,” he says. “Calcutta has a typical damp wall smell and I tried to capture the same through an overall damp watercolour treatment.”\n\nThe makeup sketches and drawings left by his grandmother that KK Menon’s character uses to build new facial prosthetics and assume new identities was interestingly inspired by the works of Leonardo Da Vinci. “Uncertainty, chaotic forms and the merging of thoughtful images with delusional ideas from the depths of the subconscious mind—that’s what those drawings in Bahrupiya represent,” Pal continues. “And the inspiration behind the final prosthetic face that destroys Indrashish was aptly based on Salvador Dali’s painting The Face of War.”\n\nFor costume designer Sabrani Das, the idea was to stay loyal to the hypocrisy that was consuming Indrashish’s character: “The make-up was Indrashish’s passion. He used to feel very strongly about it. At the same time, he was a bitter man. So, for him, this skill was like a coin with double sides—where one side was an achievement and the other was revenge. And so naturally for me, the makeup was the hero and villain at the same time.”\n\nHungama Kyon Hai Barpa: Marrying Time\n\nBased on one of Ray’s funniest stories (“Barin Bhowmik’s Ailment”) this Abhishek Chaubey-directed short explores the blurry lines of guilt and conscience through the comical lens of kleptomania. The decision by Chaubey and the writers to contextualise the story in the contradictory world of wrestling and Urdu poetry is both amusing and theatrical.\n\n“Considering the story, the world-building needed to placed amidst Islamic culture—everything from the locations, the props and right down to the Urdu signage,” explains production designer Aditya Kanwar. “My team and I put together lots of references and used the Ballimaran street of Delhi, where part of the story is based, as a starting point to build further.”\n\nIt is the 1980s when we see the Wrestling Magazine, an important prop, in the film. Kanwar’s team looked at a host of old magazines from over the years and took inspiration from how the cover art used to be hand-painted and then subsequently printed to make the actual magazines. While for Roof Safa—a shop that literally helps you clear your conscience—the inspiration was again Old Delhi. “Usually, these shops are dusty and stuffed to the brim with all sorts of antiques and lots of bits and bobs,” says Kanwar. “Taking this as a base, we built the look of the store by selecting various props and antiques to go with the colour palette but also being conscious that the timeline of this store's existence over the years was visually emphasised. Rooh Safa roughly translates to the journey of the soul. It’s a beautiful thought, so we propped it up with meticulously sourced antiques from the Mughal Era and British Raj down to the timeline of the film in order to interpret the same.”\n\nSpotlight: Balancing Faith And Illusion\n\nBased on Ray’s story of the same name, this Harshvardhan Kapoor and Radhika Madan-starrer is a subtle satire on the limits of faith and the clashing insecurities of those who have tasted fame. There is the character of Kapoor, a moderately famous actor whose paths cross with the young goddess-like character of Madan (Didi), and fireworks ensue.\n\n“Our film is staged in the juxtaposition of two worlds—his and hers. Her is a charismatic leader, a divinity that envelopes all with just her aura because she heals with just one look. His world was deceptively simpler. Director Vasan Bala reiterated often that it was to be a visual and emotional takeover whenever Didi’s character stepped in, without actually seeing her,” says production designer Dhara Jain. Designing the religious and spiritual elements was a challenge in itself. The team went out of its way to ensure that no religious sentiments were hurt. “We only wanted to work on the hypnotising blind faith of a cult,” states Jain.\n\nAnd yet, the imagery is vivid—the use of the colour blue around Madan’s character symbolised the serene and grounded effect emblematic of her persona; while having Didi, her personal self, lying in the opposite of the colour spectrum in fire red represented power, energy and the primal life forces. For Didi’s cult, the blue logo of the all-seeing double cosmic eye was inspired by Satyajit Ray’s ‘Devi’ poster. Jain’s team wanted to create a blinding illusion through it. And the phrase often repeated in the film ‘ek look hi kaafi hai’ was the source behind the double eye in the logo. This was further combined with spiritual elements such as the rose petals, blue rings and golden rays of light.\n\nJain recounts how the treatment of the logo in its tangible form was where the crew had a lot of fun—hundreds of meters of mal fabric was first dyed in variant indigo blues and screen printed with yellow gold, illustrating Didi’s elemental offerings and the chant of her symbolic presence."
