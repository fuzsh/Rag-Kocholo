        "text": "\"Why are you here?\" \"Revenge.\" What a line. XYZ Films has revealed an official trailer for an action movie called Hounds of War, a new movie from the action director Isaac Florentine. This one will be released on VOD directly starting in September. Hounds of War about the best military mercenaries money can buy. Known as \"The Hounds\", they are sent on a final mission by their creator: a carefully planned trap set up to destroy them. So another \"trap\" movie to play against M. Night Shyamalan's Trap? Sure why not. Hounds of War stars Rhona Mitra, Robert Patrick, and Frank Grillo, with Steven Elder, Yvonne Mai, Joey Ansah, Lee Charles, and Mark Strange. Looks like it was filmed mostly on Malta, which is an infamous tax haven and a nice place to save money making a movie, even though it's not the most exciting place to shoot something this generic & derivative. It's like The Expendables meets John Wick, yet looks even worse.\n\nHere's the official trailer (+ poster) for Isaac Florentine's film Hounds of War, direct from YouTube:"
