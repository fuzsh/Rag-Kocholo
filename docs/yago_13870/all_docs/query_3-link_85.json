        "text": "Hold onto your peaches, a Call Me By Your Name sequel might be happening. There’s been speculation about the return of Elio, the character that brought Timothée Chalamet to stardom, since, well, the first movie – and director Luca Guadagnino has added more fuel to the fire by confirming that he still wants it to happen.\n\n“A sequel is an American concept,” he told Indiewire while promoting his current Chalamet-fronted romance Bones and All. “It’s more like the chronicles of Elio, the chronicles of this young boy becoming a man. It is something I want to do.” The idea feels akin to François Truffaut’s Antoine Doinel films, a series which follows the life of the 400 Blows character played by Jean-Pierre Léaud. Or something like Before Sunrise for sexual awakenings.\n\nCall Me By Your Name actually did get a sequel, just in book form. In Find Me, by author André Aciman, Elio and Oliver are separated for decades but still long for those days back in Italy. They both find other people – Elio with an older man, and Oliver with his wife – but they eventually leave their partners and find their way back to each other.\n\nRumours of a follow-up to the acclaimed romantic drama have been swirling for over four years now. It doesn’t help that Guadagnino loves to drip-feed his ideas to the press. The director has envisioned everything from Elio becoming a cinephile to casting Dakota Johnson as Oliver’s wife. Here’s another idea he shared:\n\n“Let’s give a small scoop: the sequel (but I don’t like to call it a sequel, their story is a ‘cycle’) will take place in Paris. And it begins with Elio crying. With this light shining into his eyes… and we wonder: are we still where we left him (in front of the fireplace)? No: he’s crying because he’s watching the ending of one of the best movies of the eighties, Paul Vecchiali’s masterpiece Once More/Encore. Absolutely consistent with the character: Elio loves Paul Vecchiali’s cinema… that is melancholic like him.”\n\nChalamet, who has maintained a close friendship with Guadagnino since he gave the actor his break-out role is firmly on board. In an interview with Time, he said, “I don’t see any world where [a sequel] doesn’t happen. I think Andre [Aciman, author of the novel] is comfortable with a sequel being made. I know Luca really wants it. And I know Armie and I are 1000% in.”\n\nSince we’re five years in and still talking about a potential sequel, there’s been some obvious road bumps. Meetings about the sequel were put on hold during the pandemic, and there’s also the Armie Hammer-shaped elephant in the room, which likely rules out any reunions between Elio and Oliver if there is no casting shuffle."
