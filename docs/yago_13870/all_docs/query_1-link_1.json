It grossed $112 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nAlice temporarily dumps her college boyfriend Josh, moving to New York City to be a paralegal and live with her sister, Meg, an OB/GYN who has no interest in having a baby or being in a relationship. Alice befriends wild Australian co-worker Robin, who enjoys partying and one-night stands, and local bartender Tom, who embraces the bachelor lifestyle and hooks up with several women, including Alice. Tom meets Lucy at his bar when she uses his Internet for free; she explains she is looking for \"the one\" using various dating sites.\n\nAlice meets with Josh, ready to reconcile. He explains he is seeing someone else, which distresses her. Meg has a change of heart while watching over a baby, deciding to have a child of her own via a sperm donor.\n\nShortly after she becomes pregnant, Meg unexpectedly hooks up with a younger man, Ken, after meeting him at Alice's office Christmas party. He, the law office receptionist, is smitten with her. She tries to break it off, but he continues to pursue her. Thinking Ken is too young for her to have a future with, Meg hides the pregnancy from him.\n\nBack at Tom's bar, Lucy has a string of horrible dates, at which point he realizes he has feelings for her. In an attempt to put herself out there, Alice attends a networking event, where she hits it off with a man named David.\n\nLucy has been in a relationship for three weeks with Paul, who reveals he has been seeing other people, thinking she was doing the same, and breaks up with her. Lucy breaks down at her volunteer job reading to children at a bookstore. George, who works there, soothes her, and they begin a relationship.\n\nAlice and Robin attend Josh's holiday party; Alice finds she cannot watch Josh with his new girlfriend. She runs into David, who shows her a private view of the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree, dazzling her, and they begin a relationship. Three months later, as she is singing with David's daughter Phoebe, he becomes upset with her, reminding her that she is not Phoebe's mother. His wife died two years ago and David believes it is too soon for Phoebe to have a stepmother. They break up as a result.\n\nTom becomes upset with Lucy's relationship with George and invites Alice to get drunk. They talk about their frustrations with their feelings for Josh and Lucy and sleep together to distract themselves. Ken discovers Meg is pregnant but is eager to help raise her child. She, fearing that he is not truly committed, ends the relationship.\n\nAt Alice's birthday party, Robin invites Tom, David, and Josh without Alice's knowledge, as she thought it would be funny. Shaken by the presence of all three men, Alice confronts Robin. Tom confesses his feelings to Lucy, but she announces she is engaged to George. Josh approaches Alice, and they make out but stop when she discovers he is now engaged and is merely looking for closure with her.\n\nInvigorated by a desire to find herself, Alice leaves to go home. Her cab hits Robin, who was trying to stop the cab for Meg, who is in labor. They rush to the hospital, where Meg gives birth to a baby girl. Ken convinces her to resume their relationship, while Alice rekindles her friendship with Robin.\n\nThe film closes with Alice reflecting on her time living alone and being single. Meg and Ken are together, while Robin continues her old habits. Tom opens up to the possibilities of non-casual relationships. Lucy marries George, and David talks to his daughter about her mom. Finally, Alice is seen exploring the Grand Canyon by herself to witness the sunrise on New Year's Day: a dream she'd always had.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nDakota Johnson as Alice Kepley, Meg's sister and Robin's friend and co-worker.\n\nRebel Wilson as Robin, Alice's friend and co-worker.\n\nLeslie Mann as Meg Kepley, Alice's sister.\n\nAlison Brie as Lucy, she has online dating down to a science hoping to find her soul mate.\n\nAnders Holm as Tom, a bartender.\n\nNicholas Braun as Josh, Alice's ex-boyfriend.\n\nDamon Wayans Jr. as David Stone, Alice's love interest.\n\nJake Lacy as Ken, Meg's love interest.\n\nJason Mantzoukas as George, works at the bookstore where Lucy volunteers to read at children.\n\nColin Jost as Paul.\n\nBrent Morin as Lucy's date.\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nDevelopment and casting\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film rights for the Liz Tuccillo novel were purchased in 2008, the same year as the book's publication.[4] Drew Barrymore was initially attached to direct[5] however she was replaced in 2013 with Christian Ditter.[4]\n\nLily Collins was in early talks on February 24, 2014, to join the cast of the film.[6] Alison Brie was in talks to join the film on June 19, 2014.[7] Dakota Johnson, Rebel Wilson, and Leslie Mann were all cast in the film on January 29, 2015.[8] Damon Wayans Jr. was added to the cast on March 6, 2015.[9] Jason Mantzoukas and Nicholas Braun were also cast, on April 14, 2015; Braun played the love interest of Johnson's character, while Mantzoukas played the love interest of Brie's.

The site's critical consensus reads, \"How to Be Single boasts the rough outline of a feminist rom-com, but too willingly indulges in the genre conventions it wants to subvert.\"[18] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 51 out of 100 based on 32 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[19] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.[16]\n\nRichard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, praising the film's supporting cast and script.[20] Alonso Duralde of the TheWrap wrote:\n\nThe script offers enough laughs to keep the movie from feeling completely disposable... and it outshines many of its genre peers through little touches like not punishing its female characters for enjoying sex and casting Damon Wayans Jr. (as a romantic interest for Alice) in a role in which his race is thoroughly irrelevant.[21]\n\nThe Guardian's Peter Bradshaw gave it 1/5 stars, writing, \"Wilson has one or two good lines, but this film looks like itâ€™s been put together by one of Brie's dodgy algorithms.\"[22] Linda Barnard of the Toronto Star gave it 1.5/4 stars, writing, \"Unsure what kind of movie it wants to be, How To Be Single is a messy mix of everything, burying the final, genuinely felt 20 minutes that could have saved this intermittently amusing, sloppily made rom-com.\"[23]\n\nAccolades\n\n[edit]\n\nPeople's Choice Awards nominated How to Be Single as Favorite Comedic Movie, but it lost to Bad Moms.[24]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
