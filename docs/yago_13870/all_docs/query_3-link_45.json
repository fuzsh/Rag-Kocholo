        "text": "Name: Andre Bird-Pierre\n\nSchool: Graceland\n\nPosition: DL\n\nHeight: 6’4″\n\nWeight: 280\n\nQ: What goals did you set and/or accomplish in your final collegiate season?\n\nWas to come in dominate, compete, and be overall force. I feel since I came to Graceland I have achieved that as well. Also be a team Player.\n\nQ: What would your coaches and teammates say about the type of player you are?\n\nI am independent, leader, loyal and someone the coaches can turn to when things aren’t going right. I am the voice of reason from time to time.\n\nQ: When you are studying film, what do you focus on to improve your game?\n\nI focus on what I can prove on myself. I study the mistakes I had made and analyze what I can do better. Whether that be in games or even practice. After wathing film and noticing that i didn’t hit a pass rush move as a defensive end or I work on to holding and maintaining my leverage from taking on a double team as a interior lineman. I study the offensive formations and tendencies to pick up which plays maybe more pass heavy or run heavy formations. As well as, which formations teams like to run toward either the boundary or field, which is why studying film is so important.\n\nQ: What separates you from the other pro prospects at your position?\n\nIs my versatility, you can put in on the inside of the dline or the outside doesn’t matter because my relentless pursuit to the ball helps me make those plays. I play with a high motor and intensity i can be a difference maker on the field.\n\nQ: What is your offseason plan to train and prepare for professional opportunities?\n\nMy plan is to go back home (Long Island, New York) and train. I am currently looking at training with some of the best coaches I know. Just trying to narrow down which trainer better suits me.\n\nQ: What kind of strengths and abilities will you bring to a team that will stand out both on and off the field?\n\nStrengths are being very humble with every opportunity presented to me, on the field you are going to get a high caliber player someone who is not afraid to make mistakes and be OK with being coach-able to fix those mistakes. Off the field you will have someone who is community based and will positively create a great image not just for myself but to the organization or takes me as well.\n\nQ: What is your final pitch to the NFL or any other pro leagues?"
