        "text": "Satyajit talked about the film in his 1960 film to French journalist Pierre Andre Boutang in 1989. Sharmila played the role of a young woman who is seen as an avatar of goddess Kali in the film that also featured Soumitra Chatterjee and Chhabi Biswas.\n\nSatyajit said in the old interview, “I once made a film called the goddess Devi, it dealt with religious dogmatism, it didn’t attack religion as such, it attacked dogmatism, the extreme form of religion...But people (are) writing in the papers that ‘Oh! Mr Ray is not a Hindu, he is making such films against Hinduism’. But they are stupid people you can’t take them into account. This happens in India all the time. We have a fairly backward audience here, in spite of the film society movement and all that, if you consider the audience at large, it is a backward audience.”\n\nHe added, \"An unsophisticated audience, exposed to the commercial Hindi cinema more than anything else. And so you face this problem, but you make the kind of films (you want to) and I make the kind of films that I want to make. I make the kind of films that I enjoy making... that engages my attention, my creativity, that is all I can do.\""
