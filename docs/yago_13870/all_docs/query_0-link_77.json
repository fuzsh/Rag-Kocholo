years -- Stephen Sondheim.\n\n[ Cheers and applause ] In 1974, he made his acting debut on \"Great Performances\" in the role of piano player Maxie Schwartz in our presentation of \"June Moon.\"\n\nSince then, he gifted us with more than a dozen new productions and as many revivals of his work.\n\n\"Company\" is where our evening began.\n\nIt's a show that held a very special place in his heart.\n\n-One of the most startling and thrilling things I ever saw in a museum was, there was a Mondrian exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art.\n\nAnd in his early days, like everybody else, he was imitating others and that sort of thing.\n\nYou're seeing he's drawing representative things.\n\nAnd then, we turned the corner, and there was a picture of a painting of a cow, and a second painting of the cow, and it started to break apart, and a third painting of the cow, and by the time of the fifth painting, it was almost \"Broadway Boogie Woogie.\"\n\nHe had found his voice.\n\n-Was there a score where you found your cow?\n\n-\"Company's\" the first full-blown score I wrote that really -- that's me and nobody else.\n\n-♪ Somebody hold me too close ♪ ♪ Somebody hurt me too deep ♪ ♪ Somebody sit in my chair ♪ ♪ And ruin my sleep ♪ ♪ And make me aware of being alive ♪ ♪♪ ♪ Being alive ♪ ♪♪ ♪ Somebody need me too much ♪ ♪ Somebody know me too well ♪ ♪ Somebody pull me up short ♪
