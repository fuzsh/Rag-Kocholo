        "text": "Some people called him Major, some called him Captain, some called him Colonel; some called him General and some called him simply Andre, depending on the moment in time when he intersected with their lives.\n\nThis is a testament to his ability to communicate and empathize with everyone, no matter what their level of education or fortune may have been and whatever their status may have been in our society. It is a testament that at any moment of his existence, he always found a way to help the less fortunate and the needy.\n\nThis did not seem to be a likely scenario when Andre Jean-Pierre was born on October 31, 1940, in the city of Jacmel, from Michel Jean-Pierre, a carpenter and Lorita Alliance, the first of 13 siblings. It did not seem a likely scenario when as a child he nearly died in a drowning accident. Notwithstanding this humble beginning, his mother inculcated in him a few but strong principles that will guide him throughout his existence.\n\n1- Always be your best and do your best\n\n2- Never stray from the path of righteousness\n\nThese principles took him through elementary school with the Brothers of Christian Instruction.\n\nHis third guiding principle was in a way imposed on him and developed as he found himself somewhat responsible for his 12 brothers and sisters, at 17 years of age, due to the premature death of his beloved mother.\n\nAfter brilliantly completing his secondary cycle of studies at the Lycee Pinchinat, he applied to and was admitted to the Haitian Military Academy. He graduated and started his military career as a second lieutenant. This career spanned a period of 24 years, a period during which a simple joke could land you in trouble and a simple faux pas could mean a death sentence. He managed to survive, move forward and ascend to some of the highest echelons of the Haitian Military hierarchy.\n\nHow did he do it?\n\nFirst and foremost, by being kind and courteous to everyone. He knew that the people you meet on the way up are the same people you meet on the way down.\n\nSecond, he learned how to surround himself with good friends. He valued friendship in good times and even more in bad times. He was a good listener and showed time and time again that he was worthy of the trust and confidence placed in him.\n\nThird, he continued to value knowledge and education. He had this insatiable yearning to learn more and more. While stationed in Port-au-prince, he attended the Goethe Institute and was fluent in German; he obtained a law degree from the University of Haiti and completed a degree at the Institute of Higher Commercial and Economic Studies.\n\nIt is during this period that he befriended one of his classmates, Marie-Emilie Auguste. Cupid’s arrows were very effective and a year later, they were married. From their union often disrupted by the political instability that then prevailed in the country, two beautiful daughters were born, Sandra and Isabelle. Both daughters adored their father and lovingly recall how “Pappy Andre” as they called him, would take them tirelessly to school every day, to piano lessons, ballet lessons, tennis lessons or to the beach. From this intense interaction, the wisdom was passed surreptitiously to the young generation. Still today, among many other advices, they remember the mantra:\n\n“Every time you fail, you lose a battle, but not the war. So, keep trying.”\n\n“Shoot for the moon, if you miss, you land among the stars.”\n\nBeing a good father, was only one facet of this complex personality. His intellectual aptitude was not lost on his superiors and his colleagues. He was chosen to attend advanced courses in Defense Management, at the Quantico Military Base in Virginia and other military formation programs in Monterrey, California and Fort Dix, New Jersey.\n\nHe received more and more important assignments and responsibilities and eventually became the second highest ranked officer of the Haitian Armed Forces. He also was called upon to serve as the Finance Minister during the transition presidency of the General Henry Namphy.\n\nBut, there was more…\n\nHow can we not mention his entrepreneurial spirit? As a lower level office, Andre always endeavored to supplement his income and secure a good life for his family. An open air movie theater, a drug store, a sugar cane mill and a distillery are but a few of the businesses that he created, always with the help and the backing of his devoted wife, who marveled at his talent for planning and organizing.\n\nBy 1994, the political winds had shifted. After a premature retirement, he no longer felt safe in the country and decided to emigrate to the United States. Soon thereafter, he enrolled in the Touro Law School in New York City and obtained his JD degree. He moved to Florida and volunteered to provide legal assistance to the elderly and whomever may have needed his assistance.\n\nIt does not seem that he had much time left for anything else, but you would be mistaken to believe that. Andre was an avid athlete. He played badminton early on and then tennis, his favorite sport that he practiced almost daily in sunny Florida. He was a shrewd player and all his tennis partners will know what I mean, when I mention the “five mile an hour ace serve. ” He always kept his sense of humor and I still remember his remark when his opponent missed the first serve. He would say with a smirk on his face : “Faites le second comme le premier”, (Hit the second as you did the first!) hoping for a double fault.\n\nFinally, I cannot end without telling you about his faith. Andre was a devout Catholic. His faith, inspired by his mother and forged during the years spent with the Brothers of Christian instruction and perhaps reinforced by his near-death experience, always provided him with the support he needed in the difficult moments of his life.\n\nThe American humorist, Mary Roach wrote:” I don’t fear death so much as I fear its prologues : loneliness, decrepitude, pain, debilitation, depression, senility.” Andre knew that the end would come one day and he talked about it with serenity, but he never had to fear the prologues, because he was never depressed, never lonely and enjoyed an excellent health.\n\nHe was a young man of 77 years of age, who was taken from his wife, his daughters and grandson, his family, his friends and all those who have had the privilege of knowing him.\n\nTo all, we offer our most sincere condolences. Let the happy memories be the balm that soothes our pain! We will have vision of his childish smile, his nonchalant gait! We will miss his intelligent discussions! The Lord, the eternal living God, may have claimed his soul, but he will always be with us. Andre Jean-Pierre will live in our memories. He should live in our memories, for he remains an example that can be offered to the next generation, virtues that they will do well to live by."
