        "text": "Youâve probably seen A Christmas Story enough times that you never really need to watch it again. But watch it you will. And youâll enjoy every minute of it again, tooâeven though you know every twist and turn it will take for our young hero Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) to finally get his hands on his much-desired Red Ryder Carbine-Action 200-Shot Range Model Air Rifle. (An item he repeats 28 times throughout the filmâs 94-minute running time; you could make an eggnog drinking game out of that.)\n\nThis Christmas, when you inevitably tune in to catch at least one airing of Bob Clarkâs holiday classic during the annual 24-hour marathon (one on TBS, the other on TNT), weâve got a way for you to watch A Christmas Story in a whole new way: by keeping your eyesâand earsâopen for these 25 blink-and-youâll-miss-âem gaffes, anachronisms, and fun facts that make watching the classic film an entirely new experience.\n\n1. Ralphie doesnât know how to spell âChristmas.â\n\nAt least it doesnât appear that way when he gets his Christmas themeâor shall we call it a Chistmas themeâback from Mrs. Shields, who also didnât notice the âRâ missing from the word.\n\n2. Jean Shepherd makes an on-screen appearance.\n\nIf the voice of the man who brusquely informs Ralphie and Randy that the line to sit on Santaâs lap begins about 2 miles further back than they had anticipated sounds familiar, thatâs because itâs the voice of the narrator, a.k.a. Adult Ralphie, who also happens to be Jean Shepherd, the man upon whose short stories the film itself is based. The woman behind Shepherd is his wife, Leigh Brown.\n\n3. Bob Clark has a cameo, too.\n\nNot to be outdone, director Bob Clark pops up in front of the camera, too, as Ralphieâs neighbor, Swede. Heâs the guy who seems awfully curious about how Ralphieâs dad managed to snag himself a leg lamp. When The Old Man Parker informs him that itâs a Major Award, Swede responds: âShucks, I wouldnât know that. It looks like a lamp.\"\n\n4. Ralphieâs dad is never given a name.\n\nOver the years, a gaggle of sharp-eared A Christmas Story fans have pointed out that in Bob Clarkâs scene, Ralphieâs dad is given a name: Hal. This is because they believed that in the brief exchange between the two neighbors, Swede asks of the leg lamp, âDamn Hal, you say you won it?â But a quick confer with the filmâs original screenplay confirms that Swedeâs actual query is, âDamn, hell, you say you won it?â\n\n5. Speaking of the leg lamp â¦\n\nThe continuity folks must have been taking a coffee break during the unveiling of the leg lamp. Watch closely as the amount of packing debris covering The Old Manâs back and head changes from shot to shot. In one shot, his back is covered in the stuff; cut back and thereâs nothing there.\n\n6. Is the leg lamp really a lamp?\n\nIn addition to being stumped by the word fragile, The Old Manâand the rest of the familyâis initially confused as to what the legâs purpose is. Is it a statue? (âYeah, statue!â) One canât blame them, as thereâs no electrical cord to be seen. Itâs just a leg. Yet, once the lampshade is discovered, the Parker clan is magically able to plug that titillating little fixture right in.\n\n7. One final thing about the leg lamp â¦\n\nAfter witnessing the moment that Ralphie explains would become âa family controversy for yearsââthe breaking of the leg lampâMrs. Parker balks at her husbandâs accusation that she would be jealous of a plastic lamp. But just moments before the âaccidentâ in question, we hear the sound of breaking glass. And lots of it. Plastic doesnât sound (or break) like that.\n\n8. Is it Toronto or is it Indiana?\n\nThough the film is set in Hohman, Indianaâa fictionalized town based on Shepherdâs hometown of Hammond, Indianaâparts of the film were shot in Toronto. This becomes apparent in some of the outdoor scenes, such as when the family is shopping for a Christmas tree, as one of the Toronto Transit Commissionâs signature red trolley cars zooms by.\n\n9. Bolts versus nuts.\n\nWe all remember Ralphieâs reaction when his attempt to help his father fix a flat tire goes terribly awry. But hereâs a fun fact that only true motorheads would pick up on: In the scene, Ralphieâs dad implores him to hold the hubcap horizontally so that he can put the ânutsâ in it. But the 1938 Oldsmobile that heâs driving actually uses removable bolts. A fact that Shepherd confirms in his narration of the scene when he recalls that, âFor one brief moment I saw all the bolts silhouetted against the lights of the trafficâand then they were gone.â Oh, fudge!\n\n10. Scott Schwartz is not Schwartz. But he is.\n\nRalphieâs two best friends are Schwartz, played by R.D. Robb, and Flick, played by Scott Schwartz. As if this tale of two Schwartzes werenât confusing enough, when Ralphie tells his mom that itâs Schwartz who taught him how to drop the F-bomb, Mrs. Parker immediately calls the boyâs mother. But the voice we hear of fictional Schwartz taking a whooping is actually the voice of Scott Schwartz. Got it?\n\n11. Schwartzâs whereabouts are confusing.\n\nImmediately following his unceremonious (and totally false) ratting out of his buddy, Ralphie remembers how âthree blocks away, Schwartz was getting his.â In the original story, that may have very well been the case. But the filmâs production called for Schwartzâs home to be just a few doors down from Ralphieâs, as we see as the kids walk to school together. Not three blocks away.\n\n12. Ralphieâs not a very good listener.\n\nRalphie felt understandably ripped off when, after weeks of waiting for his Little Orphan Annie decoder ring, the first message he decoded was simply an advertisement for Ovaltine. But heâs lucky he could decipher the message at all, because a few of the numbers that he wrote down donât match the numbers that announcer Pierre Andre broadcast, most notably the last one; Pierre said 25, Ralphie wrote 11.\n\n13. Uppercase or lowercase?\n\nPerhaps itâs that very error above that made it necessary for Ralphie to decode Annieâs message on at least two pieces of paper. How do we know that? Check out the difference in the âEâ in the word âBe.â In the earlier shot, itâs an uppercase E; in the final message, the letter is lowercase. Weâre on to you, Ralphie.\n\n14. For a sports fan, Old Man Parker doesnât know much about sports.\n\nThough the exact year of A Christmas Storyâs setting is never stated, many of its context cluesâincluding the makes and models of the cars we see and the popularity of The Wizard of Oz and Little Orphan Annieâput its year around 1939 or 1940. Yet in the beginning of the film, Mr. Parker becomes irate after reading in the paper that the White Sox âtraded Bullfrog.â But the White Sox never traded Bill âBullfrogâ Dietrich, though they did release him on September 18, 1946, which would make this comment six years premature. He also refers to the Chicago Bears as the âTerror of the Midway,â when in fact their nickname is âMonsters of the Midway.â\n\n15. The case of the mysterious levers.\n\nOld Man Parker seems to have a lot of non-human enemiesâhis car, the Bumpus hounds, and a seemingly possessed furnace among them. In one scene, The Old Man yells upstairs for someone to open the damper, which Mom does rather reluctantly. But watch closely when the camera cuts back to the levers, which are in the opposite position as Mom set them just seconds earlier.\n\n16. Diversity as an anachronism.\n\nBy the time A Christmas Story was released in 1983, racial segregation in Indiana public schools was a thing 34 years in the past. But if Ralphieâs story takes place any time before 1949, he would not have had any Black classmates, as he does in the film.\n\n17. The rotating banana.\n\nHoping to score some extra points with his teacher, Ralphie presents Mrs. Shields with the worldâs largest fruit basket. Itâs so large, in fact, that its individual pieces of fruit seem to have minds of their own. Watch the way the banana shifts position each time the camera cuts back to Ralphie.\n\n18. A drawer full of unimaginable mischief.\n\nRalphie and his classmates are a troublemaking lot. And when they decide to launch a classroom-wide prank in which theyâre all wearing a set of false teeth, Mrs. Shields is well-prepared. Sheâs got a drawer full of pranks past, including a pair of chattering teeth â¦ a gag gift that wasnât actually invented until 1949.\n\n19. Speaking of toothy anachronisms â¦\n\nIn his attempts to make Ralphieâs life a living hell, we get an up-close view of the braces worn by Scut the bully. Theyâre the kind that are directly bonded to the front of his teeth, a process that wasnât invented until the 1970s. Until then, metal braces were wrapped around the teeth.\n\n20. Three-barrel hinged glasses werenât a thing either.\n\nAfter nearly shooting his eye out on Christmas morning, Ralphie steps on his own glasses, revealing they use a three-barrel hinge connector, which would not have been possible until the 1980s.\n\n21. Ralphie shoots three times, hits four.\n\nWhen Ralphie is forced to defend his family against the rascally Black Bart (in his own imagination), he shoots three bad guys before his nemesis Bart escapes. But when the pile of bad guys is shown with their eyes Xâed out, there are four of them.\n\n22. A very Bing christmas.\n\nOn Christmas morning, the Parkers kick back with that most classic of Christmas albumsâBing Crosbyâs Merry Christmasâin the background. As cherished a tradition as that may be, the album wasnât released until 1945.\n\n23. A bowling ball for Christmas.\n\nOld Man Parker is thrilled when his wife gifts him with a shiny new blue bowling ball for Christmas. Thereâs just one problem: colored bowling balls werenât introduced until the 1960s.\n\n24. Melinda Dillion gets top billing.\n\nGetting top billing must have been quite a thrill for actress Melinda Dillon â¦ until the actual credits rolled and her name was misspelled.\n\n25. Flash Gordon gets credit, too.\n\nKeep watching the end credits roll and youâll see Flash Gordon and Ming the Merciless among the names that scroll by. Though it never made the final cut, the credits for an additional fantasy sequence in which Ralphie and his trusty firearm help Flash Gordon face off against Ming remain.\n\nA version of this story ran in 2018; it has been updated for 2023."
