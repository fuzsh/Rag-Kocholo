        "text": "SHARE:\n\nAll 32 NFL teams have officially reported to training camp, and padded practices are well underway.\n\nHere’s my annual list of one intriguing player from each team to keep an eye on as things ramp up around the league:\n\nArizona Cardinals: WR Greg Dortch\n\nThe Cardinals have quietly assembled a dynamic offense featuring rookie Marvin Harrison Jr. and emerging young stars Michael Wilson and Trey McBride.\n\nGreg Dortch might be the name most casual fans are unfamiliar with. The former undrafted free agent finished last season with 24 receptions for 280 yards and two touchdowns, most of which came late in the year after Kyler Murray returned from injury.\n\nOne coach in Arizona told me that Dortch, who primarily lines up in the slot, has “been catching everything coming his way” during camp. Expect Dortch to get looks out of the backfield in offensive coordinator Drew Petzing’s scheme as they enter Year 2.\n\nAtlanta Falcons: TE Kyle Pitts\n\nPitts was on this list last year, but he didn’t have the breakout I hoped for. He finished the season with 53 catches for 667 yards and three touchdowns. With a new offensive coordinator in Zac Robinson, a new quarterback who loves his tight ends in Kirk Cousins, and the organization showing their commitment by picking up his fifth-year option, I once again have hope that Pitts could become the player we all thought he’d be when he was taken No. 4 overall.\n\nAs a side note, the Falcons placed Pitts in a four-person dorm room with the quarterbacks for training camp. Robinson and Cousins seem to have a plan for him, and this is a pivotal year for Pitts, who could earn a nice extension if he has a big season.\n\nBaltimore Ravens: CB Jalyn Armour-Davis\n\nA former fourth-round pick out of Alabama, Armour-Davis has appeared in just 12 of 34 games during his first two seasons due to injury. The Ravens have long been fans of his coverage skills and knack for finding the football.\n\nSo far this summer, he has stayed healthy and has been a bright spot in the Ravens' defense. The expectation is that he’ll have a role as an outside corner as long as he can stay on the field.\n\nBuffalo Bills: CB Kaiir Elam\n\nA first-round pick in 2022, Elam has dealt with injuries and has often been a healthy scratch on game days for much of his young career. There was even some talk that Buffalo might trade him last year to give him a fresh start, but GM Brandon Beane kept him around.\n\nThat decision seems to have been the right one so far. Elam has spent time with the first team and has had coaches raving about his improved consistency. New cornerbacks coach Jamile Addae has taken Elam under his wing, and the two have worked closely this offseason. So far, it’s translating on the field, and Buffalo is hopeful that will continue into the season.\n\nCarolina Panthers: WR Jonathan Mingo\n\nThe Panthers worked hard this offseason on improving their receiver room, adding Diontae Johnson in a trade and moving up to select Xavier Legette. However, that doesn’t mean Mingo, a second-round pick from last year, is out of the equation.\n\nHe’s been making plays all summer and has caught the attention of head coach Dave Canales and quarterback Bryce Young. “He’s running routes really well, doing a great job against both on and off coverage, and having a plan with his routes. He’s made some really big-time catches,” Young said.\n\nCanales added, “When he shows up, he’s all of his size and all of his speed. He’s such a smart, conscientious guy. I just really feel great confidence about him.”\n\nChicago Bears: DE Austin Booker\n\nI was stunned that Booker fell to the fifth round in April’s draft, and clearly, Chicago was as well, since they traded a future fourth-round pick to move up and get him.\n\nBooker has shown flashes since arriving at rookie minicamp, to the point that the Bears' pursuit of a veteran pass-rusher has cooled off a bit. He continued to impress in the Hall of Fame game against Houston with a good get-off and power. If he keeps it up, he could cement himself as a rotation player for Matt Eberflus.\n\nCincinnati Bengals: WR Andrei Iosivas\n\nThe Bengals were perfectly fine with allowing Tyler Boyd to leave in free agency, even when his market was cold, and he only got $2.4M from the Tennessee Titans. There is obviously a reason for that, and the potential emergence of another receiver, possibly Andrei Iosivas, could be it.\n\nThe 6-foot-3, 205-pound Iosivas has garnered praise from Burrow, and receivers coach Troy Walters called him their third-best receiver on the roster. With Boyd no longer on the team, over 75 percent of snaps are up for grabs, and Iosivas appears to have the early lead in securing a lot of them.\n\nCleveland Browns: RB Nick Chubb\n\nChubb suffered a significant and gruesome knee injury during Week 2 of last season, requiring multiple surgeries. He has been making progress toward returning, and the Browns are optimistic that he’ll be back on the field.\n\nHowever, this was somewhat underreported in the offseason: Chubb agreed to drop his 2024 payout from $12.2M to $2.275M. He could earn it all back through active per-game roster bonuses and incentives, but the Browns were clearly not going to keep him under the old contract, and Chubb had to make a significant sacrifice just to stick around.\n\nMeanwhile, the incentives to reclaim the money are challenging: 1,000 or more yards, 10 or more touchdowns, making the All-Pro team, and stuff to that extent is what would be necessary. Chubb’s return and timing will be one to watch.\n\nIn the meantime, Cleveland added Nyheim Hines, D’Onta Foreman, and Pierre Strong Jr. as veterans to join Jerome Ford in the running back room should Chubb not be ready.\n\nDallas Cowboys: TE Jake Ferguson\n\nFerguson had a big season in 2023 with 71 receptions for 761 yards and five touchdowns, but I think he's a player who could enter \"star\" territory in 2024. Ferguson was second in targets and catches last season, and offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer has mentioned that Ferguson has taken his game to another level this offseason.\n\nThey plan to move him around and make him an even more versatile option in the offense. With all the talk about Dallas needing to pay record contracts for their quarterback (Dak Prescott), receiver (CeeDee Lamb), and pass rusher (Micah Parsons), another big year from Ferguson could lead to discussions about him demanding a record tight end contract.\n\nDenver Broncos: RB Javonte Williams\n\nThe Broncos drafted Audric Estimé in the fifth round out of Notre Dame, and there were some unconfirmed reports suggesting it might have implications for Javonte Williams, but that is far from the truth.\n\nWilliams was not himself last season after returning from a significant knee injury. He has looked far different so far in camp, and it’s evident that the injury and rehab are behind him. Coach Sean Payton recently said, “he looks like a completely different player. He’s fully healthy now, and you can see it in his play.”\n\nDetroit Lions: WR Jameson Williams\n\nThis offseason was the first time Jameson Williams, as an NFL player, could focus solely on football. In his rookie season, he was recovering from an ACL injury, and in his second year, he faced a suspension for gambling on non-NFL games.\n\nPeople in Detroit are giddily anticipating what Williams will do this season, especially as he steps into a more significant role with Josh Reynolds no longer on the team. There is a strong belief that Williams is on a mission. He has been laser-focused all summer, and offensive coordinator Ben Johnson is prepared to implement new plays featuring Williams as a key contributor.\n\nA healthy Williams would have been the top receiver on most draft boards in 2022. GM Brad Holmes was willing to trade up to select him and play the long game. It took a bit longer than they hoped, but this could be the year for Williams.\n\nGreen Bay Packers: DE Lukas Van Ness\n\nThe Packers have historically taken a slow and steady approach to developing their young players, especially their pass-rushers. Van Ness, the No. 13 pick last season, showed promise down the stretch with three sacks in the final six games and added another in the playoffs.\n\nWith new defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley aiming for a more aggressive defense, Van Ness is a player to watch as someone who could take another step forward and eventually become a full-time and consistent player for Green Bay in 2025.\n\nHouston Texans: LB Azeez Al-Shaair\n\nThe Texans made it a priority to sign Al-Shaair during free agency, eventually agreeing to a three-year, $34 million contract. Texans coach DeMeco Ryans, a former linebacker, worked with Al-Shaair in San Francisco when he was their defensive coordinator.\n\nAl-Shaair recorded 163 tackles for the Titans last season and is disruptive against the run game and pass. Teammates, including fellow linebacker Christian Harris, have Al-Shaair's leadership on defense. While the Stefon Diggs and Danielle Hunter move garnered most of the attention, the Al-Shaair signing in Houston is arguably just as significant and important for the organization.\n\nIndianapolis Colts: OT Bernhard Raimann\n\nRaimann is another player who was on this list a year ago. I mentioned how, during the 2022 draft process, some scouts considered him a prospect with starting left tackle potential, but they acknowledged he needed time to develop.\n\nAfter an up-and-down rookie year, Raimann validated those scouts' assessments with an excellent sophomore season, starting 15 games and showing significant improvement. As we head into this season and with Anthony Richardson returning from injury, I think we might start hearing more about Raimann as being one of the NFL’s best young tackles.\n\nJacksonville Jaguars: S Andre Cisco\n\nThe Jaguars made a change at defensive coordinator this offseason, hiring Ryan Nielsen. Nielsen’s defense relies more on man coverage and emphasizes an aggressive, attacking approach, which suits Cisco’s style.\n\nThe former third-round pick has been one of the league's more underrated safeties, leading the team with seven interceptions during the past two years. During the first week of training camp, he intercepted passes from all three of the Jaguars' quarterbacks — Trevor Lawrence, Mac Jones, and C.J. Beathard — in a single day. This new scheme aligns well with his strengths, and Cisco could be on track for a Pro Bowl season.\n\nKansas City Chiefs: OT Kingsley Suamataia\n\nThe Chiefs had Donovan Smith at left tackle last season, but he remains a free agent. As a result, the position is open for competition. Kansas City drafted Suamataia in the second round, and they indicated he could compete for the starting job.\n\nWhile some scouts viewed Suamataia as a project, he possesses the size and mobility to become a starting tackle. He has experience playing right and left tackle from his time at BYU. If he doesn’t secure the job immediately, Wanya Morris, the Chiefs' third-round draft pick from last year, is also in contention for the position.\n\nLas Vegas Raiders: EDGE Malcolm Koonce\n\nKoonce showed impressive production last year, recording eight sacks in 11 starts.\n\nHe's a favorite of defensive coordinator Patrick Graham, too. With Maxx Crosby and Christian Wilkins drawing significant attention, Koonce could find himself in advantageous positions to make plays. The fact that he’s in a contract year should only motivate him even more.\n\nLos Angeles Chargers: RB JK Dobbins\n\nDobbins is returning after rupturing his Achilles with Baltimore in Week 1 of last season. He was fully cleared earlier this offseason and signed with the Chargers partly because of the connections to the Ravens with general manager Joe Hortiz and new offensive coordinator Greg Roman.\n\nIf there’s one thing we know about Roman and the style of football Jim Harbaugh prefers, it’s a downhill, power-run offense. Given that Justin Herbert is dealing with plantar fasciitis, Dobbins could be relied upon heavily to start the year. As long as he stays healthy, he can be a capable back, averaging an impressive 5.8 yards per carry during his career.\n\nLos Angeles Rams: C Steve Avila\n\nAvila was one of the most impressive rookies last year, starting every game and playing every snap — 1148 of 1148. However, the Rams are making a change this year by moving him from his natural guard position to center, following the re-signing of Kevin Dotson and the addition of Jonah Jackson.\n\nThere is clearly a strong emphasis on the interior of the offensive line in Los Angeles, and Avila’s transition to being the primary center will be something to watch.\n\nMiami Dolphins: CB Cam Smith\n\nA second-round pick just last year, Smith had a limited role in his rookie season, playing only 19 defensive snaps. Defensive coordinator Vic Fangio openly admitted Smith wasn’t ready to take the field, which wasn't a great look.\n\nAs Smith enters a crucial second year with a new defensive coaching staff and a secondary in need of improvement, it will be worth watching to see what he can do if given an opportunity. Remember, Smith was the first player selected by the team in the 2023 draft.\n\nMinnesota Vikings: QB Sam Darnold\n\nThe Vikings signed Darnold to be their bridge quarterback until a rookie (eventually J.J. McCarthy) could take over following Kirk Cousins' departure in free agency. However, I kept hearing this offseason and even during free agency before he signed with Minnesota that some coaches believe Darnold has untapped potential and that he didn’t get a fair chance in New York and Carolina.\n\nDuring his one season in San Francisco, Darnold didn’t play much but did make an appearance in the 49ers' blowout loss to Baltimore on a Monday night, where he showed some flashes that coaches keep bringing up.\n\nI believe Darnold has the edge in Minnesota’s quarterback competition. With their weapons and Kevin O'Connell as the play-caller, I could see a scenario where Darnold finds early success, and McCarthy sits for more than just a few games.\n\n>> READ MORE: Predicting Winner of Every QB Battle\n\nNew England Patriots: CB Christian Gonzalez\n\nGonzalez was outstanding on the field last season. However, his rookie campaign was cut short after just four games.\n\nHe earned NFL Defensive Rookie of the Month honors in September, totaling 17 tackles, one sack, one interception, and three pass breakups before suffering a torn labrum.\n\nNow fully healthy, the Patriots view Gonzalez as a potential lockdown No. 1 corner and believe he could be considered one of the league's best as early as this season. There is a lot of excitement about the player he could become, and the team will rely on him in the secondary for 1-on-1 situations vs. opposing top receivers.\n\nNew Orleans Saints: DE Chase Young\n\nThe Saints have been searching for the right player to pair with Cameron Jordan and believe they have found their solution in Chase Young. The former Defensive Rookie of the Year is thought to be fully recovered from the knee injury he suffered a few years ago, which many did not realize was as severe as it was.\n\nNew Orleans signed him to a one-year deal. In the early part of training camp, he has been the talk of the defense with his explosive pass-rushing performances and impact in the run game. Given that he signed a one-year deal, Young could be in line for a significant contract if he has the standout season he expects now that he is fully healthy.\n\nNew York Giants: TE Theo Johnson\n\nWe saw the Giants front office speak very highly of Theo Johnson during the offseason version of Hard Knocks, and it seems they plan to give him a chance to get on the field early in his young career.\n\nThe Giants could use him, especially after Darren Waller retired this offseason. At 6-foot-6, 259 pounds, Johnson has showcased reliable hands and the skill to navigate intermediate routes with fluidity.\n\nNew York Jets: DT Javon Kinlaw\n\nThis offseason, the Jets surprised some by signing Kinlaw to a one-year deal worth more than $7 million. It didn’t seem like his market was that strong, but Kinlaw had previously played for coach Robert Saleh, and he was a player they clearly wanted to add to the defensive line.\n\nSo far, Kinlaw has had a dominant start to the summer, to the point that Aaron Rodgers singled him out during one of his press conferences: “Kinlaw is a creature. I mean, he’s a beast, man. I haven’t seen a guy like that too many times in the league.”\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles: G/T Mekhi Becton\n\nThe Eagles have long had one of football's best offensive lines and decided to take a chance on the former Jets first-round pick this offseason. Becton had a solid rookie year in 2020 but was limited to one game during the next two seasons due to injury.\n\nHe returned last year and started 16 games but had his share of ups and downs alongside a struggling Jets offense. Becton had interest from several teams, but he specifically chose Philadelphia because of their offensive line coach, Jeff Stoutland, who is known as one of the best in the league.\n\nThe Eagles have experimented with Becton at guard and could also use him as a swing tackle. A fresh start and working with some of the best in the league should benefit Becton.\n\nPittsburgh Steelers: WR Van Jefferson\n\nThe Steelers have been searching for another receiver option on the trade market, but if there’s one player who has been working hard to earn playing time this season, it’s Van Jefferson. The former Rams second-round pick spent most of last season in Atlanta and signed with Pittsburgh this offseason, following Arthur Smith.\n\nHe has received most of the reps in two-receiver formations alongside George Pickens and has performed well enough that no one behind him has surpassed him on the depth chart. Pittsburgh could still add another receiver to the mix, but Jefferson is a name that could see playing time regardless.\n\nSan Francisco 49ers: WR Jauan Jennings\n\nThe lingering Brandon Aiyuk situation could allow Jauan Jennings to have a more prominent role in Kyle Shanahan’s offense in 2024. Jennings had five catches for 42 yards, one receiving touchdown, and one passing touchdown in the Super Bowl, and he is also one of the better blocking receivers in the league.\n\nIf Aiyuk gets traded, and rookie Ricky Pearsall is dealing with nagging injuries, Jennings could be called upon to take on a more significant role in the receiving game, especially early in the season.\n\nSeattle Seahawks: DE Boye Mafe\n\nMafe had a stretch last season where he recorded at least one sack in seven straight games. A pass-rush extraordinaire, Mafe is bound to have a bigger season as he enters his third year, especially with new coach Mike Macdonald.\n\nThe 25-year-old Mafe has the highest ceiling of all of Seattle’s pass-rushers and could be poised for a big year. Macdonald’s defense in Baltimore led the NFL in sacks in 2023 (60), with contributors including veterans Jadeveon Clowney and Kyle Van Noy, both of whom were signed late in the offseason.\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers: WR Jalen McMillan\n\nThe Buccaneers have quietly been one of the better drafting teams in recent history, and they might have found another immediate contributor in third-round rookie receiver Jalen McMillan.\n\nNo player in any training camp has received more praise than McMillan, and I’ve received more texts about him than any other player. \"He's a guy that runs so smoothly,\" Baker Mayfield said. \"He does some things at the top of his routes—he's so friendly to the ball—it's stuff that veterans do.\"\n\nWith Chris Godwin entering the final year of his contract, it seems McMillan could be Tampa’s No. 3 receiver this season. If he performs as well as people in Tampa expect, he could move up next season.\n\nTennessee Titans: QB Will Levis\n\nOne of the reasons Tennessee was convinced to hire Brian Callahan as their head coach was his strong investment in Will Levis and the potential work he could do with him.\n\nCallahan has worked with quarterbacks like Peyton Manning, Joe Burrow, Matthew Stafford, and Derek Carr — and now he’s taking Levis under his wing. Despite this, there hasn’t been much national discussion about Levis making a significant leap in his second year.\n\nTennessee has done everything in its power to create a quarterback-friendly situation by hiring Callahan, signing Calvin Ridley, Tyler Boyd, and Tony Pollard, and drafting JC Latham, in addition to having key pieces like DeAndre Hopkins, Tyjae Spears, and Chigoziem Okonkwo.\n\nWhile it is early, people in Tennessee have praised Levis’ attitude and believe he has developed into a leader. His performance on the practice field has given them hope that this team could be a real competitor in the AFC.\n\nWashington Commanders: LB Frankie Luvu\n\nWashington had a very active offseason under new general manager Adam Peters. Their approach included signing veterans like Bobby Wagner and Austin Ekeler to help with the culture, as well as bringing in players like Frankie Luvu, whom they want to build around for the long term.\n\nIn the last two seasons, Luvu has recorded 236 tackles, 12.5 sacks, an interception return for a touchdown, and three forced fumbles. He was a player new coach Dan Quinn coveted in free agency.\n\nEarly reports from training camp suggest that Luvu has been dominant in both the run and pass game, and it wouldn’t be surprising if he becomes a key figure in the Commanders' defense for years to come."
