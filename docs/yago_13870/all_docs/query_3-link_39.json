        "text": "As many of you know after reading my post about the Stanley Cup from yesterday, I spent the last week on vacation down the Jersey shore.\n\nAnd from many of my other posts before that, you know I enjoy going for some long bike rides — especially down the shore!\n\nSo what could be better than squeezing in a nice bike ride on a week’s long vacation? Squeezing in a nice bike ride on a week’s long vacation with a great friend of mine, of course!\n\nI got to go on a great ride with my buddy Casey Boy from The Preston and Steve Show on our sister station, WMMR.\n\nWe rode through multiple shore towns as we got in a practice ride in preparation for this Sunday’s Ben To The Shore ride! For those that don’t know, the Ben To The Shore Bike Tour is a charity event that raises funds for Families Behind the Badge Children’s Foundation, which is for the families of fallen first responders and police officers.\n\nIt is always a lot of fun and something I look forward to each year!\n\nDuring our practice route, Casey Boy and I rode about 25.81 miles from Wildwood to Town Bank to Cape May Point to Cape May then all the way back to Wildwood where we started.\n\nIt was a great time and has me ready to conquer the 65-mile Ben To The Shore ride! This will actually be my tenth year riding in the event and each year it gets better and better.\n\nIf you are interested in donating, visit fbbcf.org or visit the Team WMMR Rock and Rollers page.\n\nI can’t wait for Sunday and hopefully, the weather holds up for the ride! I’m sure there will be a lot of people on the ride for this great cause!\n\nWho do you think will cross the finish line first, me or Casey Boy?"
