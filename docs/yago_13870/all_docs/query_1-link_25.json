        "text": "You've been making music for a while, but how did you end up releasing your new single, \"Good Day Today\", on tiny British dance music label Sunday Best?\n\nIt's a strange world. My music agent played the track for Jason Bentley, a DJ at KCRW here in LA. Then Jason played it in Ibiza, which is where Ben Turner and Rob da Bank from Sunday Best heard it and liked it. It's nice when this kind of thing happens by accident. I'm not a musician, but I love making music. It's a blast.\n\nAre you a confident singer? How do you feel about your voice?\n\nI don't feel real good about it. I'm not really a singer, but my voice is treated like any other instrument; you can tweak it and manipulate it in so many ways these days. I was nervous about recording, but felt comfortable in the studio. I wouldn't perform live. What do I sing in the shower? I don't shower too often.\n\nWhat's your favourite record?\n\nI really love \"Song to the Siren\" by This Mortal Coil. That song does something to me, for sure. I actually wanted to use it in Blue Velvet but couldn't get permission at the time. Then I eventually got to use it in Lost Highway.\n\nWho are the most enjoyable to work with – actors or musicians?\n\nMusicians are probably a bit more fun, but there are many similarities. When musicians are playing together, they can experience a high that is unique. It's a completely joyful thing and magic can happen. I've felt it myself. A film set is much slower – there are many more details, but you still get crazy highs.\n\nYou paint and take photographs as well as make music and films. Does that mean you're easily bored or easily distracted?\n\nIt just means that if you wake up in the morning with an idea for painting, you do that. If it's for music, you do that. You do whatever fires you up. I'm working on a painting right now, but if I had to stick to the one art form I'd pick film because it incorporates elements of all of them. You'd get to do some music for the film, some still photography, some painting, all of those things.\n\nYou sometimes tweet about making your own furniture. What was the last thing you built?\n\nA cabinet, with four drawers and three compartments. It's made of Douglas fir, half-inch plywood and cold, rolled steel. I'm actually having a show in LA next March that will be furniture and paintings together. It's so much fun to build things. When I grew up, my dad had a wood shop so I'd be in there building stuff all the time, because that's what he did. I love the smell of pine – just cutting pine with a saw puts me in a dream world.\n\nYou're also a champion of new technology. Would you ever release a film just on your website?\n\nThat's where everything is heading very soon. It will just be downloads. But it doesn't matter how people get hold of a film; as long as they can see it in the right way it will still be beautiful. If people can see a film on a big screen, with the lights low and good sound, then they still have the chance to enter another world. Some films do better on a small screen than others, but if you saw 2001 on a phone it would be just the most pathetic joke.\n\nWhat do you think of WikiLeaks?\n\nUltimately it's a good thing. It keeps people honest and reveals who the crooks are. I think it's a force for good.\n\nIt was the 20th anniversary of Twin Peaks this year. What do you think its impact on TV has been?\n\nSome people say it influenced things but you'd have to ask them. I just love the world of Twin Peaks and I was happy and surprised at how well it travelled.\n\nWhat other TV have you enjoyed recently?\n\nI love Mad Men, and I've actually met Don Draper and Peggy Olson. I like everything about it – the writing, the directing, the acting. It's its own great world, with great characters. Every show should be that.\n\nYou're famous for your love of coffee and for meditating regularly. Which is the best way to wake up in the morning - coffee or meditation?\n\nBoth. You drink a cup of coffee and then you go meditate.\n\nYou've said you began meditating on 1 July 1973. How did you feel on 2 July?\n\nGreat, and even better on the 3rd. I've been meditating twice a day for 37 years and never missed a session, not one. It helped me with anger. There's that whole thing of some artists thinking they need all that anger and I was one of them. It's a false notion. Negativity kills creativity, it occupies the mind and you're miserable. To take the analogy a bit further – if you have a splitting headache, you're vomiting and you have diarrhoea, how much work are you gonna get done? And how much are you gonna enjoy it? An artist doesn't have to suffer to show suffering.\n\nYou were raised as a Presbyterian. Do you still believe in God?\n\nFor sure. Meditation has maybe made the belief stronger.\n\nWhat will Christmas be like in the Lynch house?\n\nJoyous. For a present, I'd like a saw.\n\nA small Inca table saw."
