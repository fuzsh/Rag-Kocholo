        "text": "This year brings much cause for celebration at Daro Film Distribution, as the company is celebrating its 30th birthday. “Our biggest accomplishment within the company is the fact that we are still in business after 30 years, which is quite rare in this industry,” exclaims Pierre André Rochat, the president of Daro Film Distribution.\n\nRochat says, however, that the road to success has still seen its fair share of challenges. “One of the biggest changes that we have seen after 30 years in business has been the globalization of the industry. As more and more territories are creating their own programming, we have seen an evolution in the production of formats that are catered to appeal to local audiences.”\n\nRochat says that for Daro Film Distribution, one of its own biggest challenges is catering to both the local and global market simultaneously. “We buy worldwide products on the one hand and look after the needs of individual territories on the other,” he says.\n\nSince being founded in 1982, the company has grown to become one of the world’s leading independent distributors. It now represents more than 100 production companies around the world, with a catalogue of more than 5,000 programs to offer the market. This includes everything from blockbuster theatrical films to action series to TV movies, animated content, documentaries and more.\n\nAmong the titles in the company’s catalogue are the hit Hollywood film The Shawshank Redemption, which is part of its Cecchi Gori library acquisition under which it has the European rights. “This has been an incredibly popular movie for over ten years now and is still number one on IMDb’s top 250 ratings,” Rochat says.\n\nTaken Back: Finding Haley is a brand-new female-led thriller produced for Lifetime. The plot centers on a woman in jeopardy. “There is a great demand for this genre of film,” Rochat says.\n\nFor buyers after holiday fare, the company offers A Christmas Wedding Date. Rochat calls the film “fun and uplifting” and says that it appeals to the entire family.\n\nDaro Film Distribution will have all of these titles and more available at MIPCOM. Rochat is very much looking forward to another trip down to Cannes, he says. “We look forward to spending quality time with all of our clients and program suppliers, as well as meeting potential new clients. MIPCOM is also a great place to keep informed on the latest industry trends and issues.”"
