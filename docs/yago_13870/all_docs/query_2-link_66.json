        "text": "Orson Welles has inspired a great many people to become film directors.\n\nSome, however, were rather inspired by his accomplishments in theatre, and thus became theatre directors.\n\nMeanwhile he has inspired me to wholeheartedly devote myself to the virtually impossible task of manufacturing a time machine, just to be able to attend this meeting in Paris.\n\nWish me luck.\n\nFinally locating and watching this seminar after seeing clips posted on twitter for years makes me feel like the ape in 2001: A Space Odyssey when the monolith teaches him that he can use a bone as a tool. Who would have guessed that Orson's lecture at the Cinémathèque Française would be on their streaming service, which is called Henri?\n\nFascinating interview with Orson Welles. He hates films that are homages and as interested as he appears in the then-new format of shooting on video he is concerned that there may be a risk of it becoming a \"cheap temptation\". He also doesn't hold back with his thoughts on Elia Kazan.\n\nThe film is available for free on the website of the Cinémathèque Française.\n\nIn which, at one point, Welles argues for the importance of actors over directors and screenwriters, while seemingly proving it, in a filmed q&a, with many questions untranslated from the French. Riveting nonetheless. Damn, this guy was a movie star on top of everything else. Come to watch Orson smoke and charm the room. Leave with fresh insights into his perspectives on directing and even how he might have felt about streaming, digital, and much of our current cinema world.\n\nWelles being Welles. A beautiful thing. Filmmed nine years after F for Fake and just a few years before his final appearance in a visual medium (doing the intro to a brilliant episode of Moonlighting), this is the best interview with the great big fat freak, the essential American auteur.\n\nWatched this over a week. I never wanted it to end. For those who don't speak French, sometimes there is a bit of a language barrier with the French translator speaking over a lot of the English. But over an hour and a half, one gets used to it. Honestly, it's the closest thing you're gonna get to actually having a panel discussion with him, so if you want that, this is for you."
