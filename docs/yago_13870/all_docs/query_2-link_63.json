Reviewers may know general information about a flight to provide context—vintage, variety or appellation—but never the producer or retail price of any given selection.

In the northern parts of the Central Coast, Chardonnay tends to dominate the plantings, with Pinot Noir, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon also playing significant roles. The cool, maritime-influenced climate along with the fertile and gravely soil contribute to Chardonnay’s crisp acidity and citrus flavors, and the extended growing season yields concentrated Merlot and Cabernet. Some of the top northern Central Coast AVAs include, Santa Lucia Highlands, Santa Cruz Mountains and Monterey. South of Monterey, the Paso Robles AVA has garnered fame for its wines produced from Rhône varieties, Cabernet and Zinfandel.

The Pinot Noirs from this area tend to have black cherry and…\n\nThe wine region of Sonoma is home to some of the most historic vineyards and wineries in California. In the 1850s, Hungarian Agoston Haraszathy planted various grapes in Sonoma that he was confident could rival European varieties, and today it is a leading wine region in California as well as the U.S. The Pinot Noir and Chardonnay from the Russian River Valley and Sonoma Coast are predominantly made by smaller wineries and have experienced increased popularity, as can be explored in our Sonoma Wine Guide. Dry Creek Valley Zinfandel, the only varietal that the U.S. can call its own because it was the first planted in California, is rich with ripe and jammy berry characteristics and can gain complexity with oak barrel aging. The same goes for the elegant Cabernet Sauvignon wines of the Alexander Valley, which tend to be…"
