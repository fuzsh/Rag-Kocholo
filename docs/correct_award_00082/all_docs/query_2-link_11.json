        "text": "(1830–1914). German poet, novelist, and short-story writer Paul Heyse was a prominent member of the traditionalist Munich school of writers. He received the Nobel prize for literature in 1910.\n\nPaul Johann Ludwig von Heyse was born on March 15, 1830, in Berlin, Prussia (now Germany). He studied classical and Romance languages and traveled for a year in Italy, supported by a research grant. After completing his studies he became an independent scholar and was called to Munich by Maximilian II of Bavaria. There, with the poet Emanuel Geibel, he became the head of the Munich circle of writers, who sought to preserve traditional artistic values from the encroachments of political radicalism, materialism, and realism. Chief among his carefully wrought short stories is “L’Arrabbiata” (1855). He also published novels, including Children of the World (1873), and many unsuccessful plays. Among his best works are his translations of the works of Giacomo Leopardi and other Italian poets. In 1871 he formulated a definition of the novella form, the “Falkentheorie” (falcon theory, from Giovanni Boccaccio’s model novella, Tale of a Falcon).\n\nHeyse, who was given to idealization and who refused to portray the dark side of life, became an embittered opponent of the growing school of naturalism, and his popularity had greatly decreased by the time he received the Nobel prize. He died on April 2, 1914, in Munich, Germany."
