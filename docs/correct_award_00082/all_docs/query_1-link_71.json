        "text": "A. S. Dmitriev 1991\n\nGerman Literature from HÃ¶lderlin to Wagner\n\nAuthor: A. S. Dmitriev;\n\nWritten: 1991;\n\nFirst published: 1991 in Istoriya zarubeznoy literatury XIX veka, Moscow, Higher School, pp. 34-113;\n\nSource: https://www.ae-lib.org.ua/texts/dmitriev__german_romantism__ru.htm\n\nTranslated: by Anton P.\n\nCHAPTER 1: GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS\n\nThe development of German literature in the 19th century. takes place in accordance with the laws of the European literary process.\n\nThe main factors that determined the character of the literary process at the end of the 18th and the first three decades of the 19th century were the influence of the French Revolution, the political fragmentation and economic backwardness of the country, the anti-Napoleonic liberation movement and the atmosphere of the general political reaction of the Restoration period without a previous revolution.\n\nIn the conditions of feudal absolutism, the authority and general aesthetic significance of the Enlightenment persisted in the 19th century. For all the differences and contradictions between Romantics and Enlighteners in Germany, German Romantics did not engage in such fierce battles with Enlighteners, as, for example, took place in the 1820s in France. On the contrary, it was the early German Romantics who created the true cult of Goethe in Germany, proceeding from his aesthetic positions in their creative practice. The historical principles of Herder’s thinking, his research in the field of folklore gave impetus to the future flourishing of German folklore studies in the activities of Romantics. Many significant aspects of the creative practice and aesthetics of both Schiller and Goethe indicate that German Romanticism had deep connections with the late Enlightenment and was formed in complex synchronous interactions with it.\n\nThe features of the transitional period from the Enlightenment to Romanticism marked the work of two outstanding writers of that time. The outstanding German poet Friedrich HÃ¶lderlin (1770-1843) is essentially a Romantic, but not associated with the schools of German Romanticism due to his adherence to the peculiar ideas of Hellenistic utopia and some artistic principles of Classicism. He differed from the Romantics and from many of his other compatriots-contemporaries in that, having once enthusiastically embraced the ideas of the French Revolution, he remained faithful to them forever, although the turn of the revolutionary events in France towards Thermidor could not but introduce the elegiac intonation of disappointment into the poet’s work. His works in his early thirties are solemn and passionate hymns inspired by the ideas of the French Revolution. Both the hymns and the subsequent lyrics of HÃ¶lderlin – landscape, love, epic and, of course, philosophical proper – are remarkable for their distinctly philosophical sound, which has absorbed his serious hobbies for various philosophical systems, antiquity, Spinoza, Schiller; the friendship with Schelling and Hegel, classmates at the University of TÃ¼bingen, also affected him. This striving for the sphere of philosophy was embodied by HÃ¶lderlin in his individually peculiar romantic utopia – the Hellenistic ideal of harmony and beauty with a distinct civic humanistic emphasis. He makes extensive use of the possibilities of free verse, applying the norms of both ancient and modern German prosody.\n\nIn the mainstream of the genre of the “novel of growth” (Bildungsroman) widely established in German literature, a significant place belonged to HÃ¶lderlin’s novel Hyperion, in which the Hellenistic moral, ethical and social ideal, expressed to an even greater extent than in its lyrics, allows us to speak of HÃ¶lderlin as a poet and prose writer, whose work is associated with the emergence of an active romantic hero. In the same row is his dramatic fragment The Death of Empedocles.\n\nAnother significant German writer of the late 18th-early 19th centuries, typologically associated with romanticism, was the novelist Jean Paul (real name Johann Paul Friedrich Richter; 1763-1825). While condemning the Jacobin dictatorship, he, like HÃ¶lderlin, nevertheless remained faithful to the ideas of the French Revolution. A number of Jean Paul’s novels are characterized by Romantic features of a fantastic utopia (the novel Titan), combined with the sentimentalist line of the German and English Enlightenment (Lawrence Sterne). The type of hero of many of his novels – an eccentric character, over whom the author himself mocks – is close to E. T. A. Hoffmann’s eccentric enthusiasts. Without developing the theoretical foundations of romantic irony, Jean Paul widely used it in some of his works, anticipating the appeal of Romantics to it.\n\nA sharp satire on the social order, sounding in the works of Jean Paul, who believed that literature should be closely connected with reality, an optimistic worldview and some other aspects of his ideological and aesthetic positions allow us to speak of him as an artist who shared the idea of ââthe social significance of art.\n\nTo the same extent as on literary movements, the influence of the French Revolution affected the development of philosophical thought in Germany at that time. It is noteworthy that almost all known philosophical systems of Germany of the late 18th-early 19th century, aesthetics were their most important component. And Kant, Schelling, and Hegel in their interpretation of the system of the universe gave an important place to art.\n\nThe greatest representative of the philosophy of classical German idealism is Immanuel Kant (1724-1804), whom Heine called a “Robespierre in the kingdom of thought” and whose system Marx called the “German theory of the French revolution”. The unknowability of this world (a thing in itself), the existence of a priori, lying outside of sensory experience, forms of consciousness.\n\nAnother major German philosopher of that time, Johann Gottlieb Fichte (1762-1814), a representative of the subjective-idealistic direction of philosophical thought, was significantly influenced by the French Revolution. Many of the main provisions of the philosophical and aesthetic system of the early German romantics were associated with Fichte’s ideas. Like Kant, the specific socio-political principles of the French Revolution were transformed by Fichte, in connection with the specifics of the social development of Germany, into an abstract philosophical and ethical plan outside of concrete social practice. However, it was precisely under the influence of the French Revolution that the concept of personal freedom, absolute free will, became one of the key provisions in Fichte’s teachings.\n\nDuring the years of the Napoleonic occupation, Fichte acted as a passionate propagandist of liberation ideas (Speeches to the German Nation), although the appeals had a certain nationalistic connotation. This position of Fichte won him great popularity among the advanced intelligentsia, and especially among students. In 1810 he became the first rector of the newly founded university in Berlin.\n\nFichte rejected the Kantian dualism, denying Kant’s position on the existence of a thing-in-itself, that is, objective material world. Despite the fact that Fichte has some minor deviations towards objective idealism, on the whole he took consistent subjective-idealistic positions, arguing that the active activity of the absolute “I” is the original force that creates the entire universe.\n\nTo a much lesser extent, the influence of the French Revolution affected another prominent representative of German classical idealism, Schelling (1775-1854). In the late 1790s and early 1800s, Schelling took part in the development of the aesthetic program of Jena Romanticism. At the same time, Schelling created his main works: The Philosophy of Nature, The System of Transcendental Idealism and Philosophy of Art.\n\nSchelling’s natural philosophy, which arose as an attempt to generalize the latest achievements of the natural sciences, had its positive aspects, consisting primarily in the fact that nature is viewed as a universal unity of various manifestations, as a unity that develops as a result of the collision of opposing forces.\n\nRepresenting in classical idealism a kind of objective idealism, Schelling developed, in contrast to Fichte, the concept of idealistic monism. Removing the Fichtean antithesis of “I” and “not-I”, subject and object, Schelling asserted the unity of nature and creation. At an early stage of development, according to Schelling, only nature existed as the embodiment of the unconscious spiritual principle, which at subsequent stages evolved to its highest expression: human consciousness. A little later, the philosopher formulated this principle differently, as the identity of nature and consciousness. Therefore, Schelling’s system is often called the philosophy of identity.\n\nSchelling’s aesthetic views were a vivid expression of the Romantic concept of art and beauty. In the Philosophy of Art, where Schelling’s path to religious mysticism is already tangibly outlined, the essence of art is interpreted as the most perfect expression of the world spirit, a synthesis of subject and object, consciousness and nature, that is, art is “the self-contemplation of the absolute spirit.” And the System of Transcendental Idealism states that art is “the eternal and genuine organon of philosophy.” The Jena school fully shared this concept of art as a kind of self-valuable and all-encompassing original beginning of all beginnings. Thus, the Jena romantics, like Schelling, believed that science arose in the bosom of art and there it will return in the coming harmonious universe. Unlike the enlighteners, who saw the task of art in imitating nature, Schelling believes that art is the expression of the absolute idea that lies in nature. And only the intuitive power of brilliant artistic insight, bestowed on the artist, allows him to grasp this absolute idea in nature. Therefore, in full agreement with the Romantic philosophy of the creative act in art, Schelling asserts the unconsciousness, the miraculousness of the creative process.\n\nGerman classical idealism reaches its peak in the philosophy of Hegel (1770-1831). Reactionary idealistic features in the sociological, historical, legal and political concepts of Hegel’s philosophical system came into sharp conflict with his dialectical method. Deepening Schelling’s concepts, Hegel, from the standpoint of objective idealism, regards as the basis of being, both material and spiritual, an absolute idea, which in its development goes through three stages: logic, philosophy of nature and philosophy of spirit. The absolute spirit, the philosopher claims, is the highest stage in the development of the absolute idea, which has three stages of self-knowledge: in art, religion and philosophy.\n\nThe main features of Hegel’s system and dialectical method are defined in his main works: Phenomenology of Spirit and Science of Logic. Its aesthetic concept is presented mainly in Lectures on Aesthetics.\n\nThe development of art, according to Hegel, goes through three stages (forms) as three different incarnations of the ideal, that is, the sensual, figurative expression of the absolute idea in reality. Of these three forms (the first two are symbolic, to which oriental art corresponds, and classical with antique art), the last one, the romantic, most fully embodies the realization of the idea. But unlike classical art, in which the form is in full accordance with the content, romantic art is characterized by the predominance of content (ideas) over form. Hegel included both medieval and contemporary art as a romantic form.\n\nSuch a picture of the development of art is, of course, conventional and built according to an idealistic scheme. Fruitful, however, is the principle of historicism, according to which Hegel considers the change of styles and genres as a natural process.\n\nThe variety of German literary movements in the 1830s undoubtedly reflected significant shifts in the country’s economic and socio-political development of those years.\n\nThe news of the revolutionary explosion in July 1830 in Paris, like a refreshing, life-giving whirlwind, swept across Germany, backwater and fragmented, deceived in its bright hopes, generated by the patriotic enthusiasm of the liberation war against Napoleon. These events were received with particular enthusiasm by the German youth, whose moods were very vividly expressed by Heine. Upon learning of the revolution in France, he wrote in his diary: “Lafayette, the tricolor banner, the Marseillaise ... I feel like I’m intoxicated. Bold hopes are passionately rising, like trees with golden fruits, with thriving branches, stretching their foliage to the very clouds ... I am all joy and song, I am all sword and flame!”\n\nThe July Revolution in France was the impetus that caused revolutionary outbreaks in Germany, prepared by the internal development of class contradictions in the country. These events reflected the growth of the class consciousness of the German bourgeoisie, its desire to eliminate the political fragmentation of the country, which hindered the development of trade and the economy.\n\nThe opposition movement generated a wave of repression from the ruling circles of Germany.\n\nShifts in the economic and socio-political life of the country were not slow to affect various forms of public consciousness, in particular philosophy and literature. The philosophical movements of the 1830s in Germany were reflected in the formation of German realism.\n\nIn the 1830s, sharp contradictions were identified in the camp of Hegel’s followers – a group of Old Hegelians or Right Hegelians (Gubler, Hinrichs, Erdmann) and a Left Hegelian wing, or Young Hegelians (Bruno and Edgar Bauer, David Friedrich Strauss, Max Stirner) stand out. From the position of radical republicanism, the Hegelian left had a negative attitude towards Prussianism and sharply criticized the dogmas of the Christian religion.\n\nThe character of German literature of this decade changes sharply in comparison with the literature of the 1810-20s. In his famous work The Romantic School, Heine emphasized: “With the death of Goethe a new literary era begins in Germany; with him went to the grave old Germany, the age of aristocratic literature has come to an end, the democratic age begins.”\n\nIndeed, the main phenomena in German literature of the 1830s testify to its certain democratization in comparison with the previous stage of development. Moreover, these new tendencies were reflected primarily in the ideological and aesthetic evolution of Heine.\n\nThe process of the formation of realism in German literature of the 1830s was clearly manifested in the work of Georg BÃ¼chner (1813-1837), and above all in his drama Death of Danton (1835). Socio-political issues under the influence of the July Revolution and internal German contradictions, which actively saturated the German literature of the 1830s, were most radically interpreted by BÃ¼chner, who directed the activities of one of the secret revolutionary organizations, the Human Rights Society in Hesse.\n\nThe dramatic events of the French Revolution at the end of the 18th century allowed BÃ¼chner to artistically solve the problem of revolutionary violence, to reveal the role of the leader and the people in the revolution. The writer, naturally, took into account the experience of the events of July 1830 in Paris, clearly showing the limitations of the bourgeois revolution.\n\nQualitatively new trends in the German literary process of the 1830s had an active impact on the creative evolution of Karl Immermann (1796-1840), a writer who made a significant contribution to the development of German progressive literature, in particular to the development of the social novel genre. Immermann’s creative quest led him to close personal friendship, and at times to active creative collaboration with Heine, despite the differences in their political views. His most significant works, which played a role in the subsequent development of German literature, were the novels Epigones (1836) and Munchausen (1835-1839). These novels reflected some of the most important moments of the socio-political development of modern Germany: the gradual ousting from the historical arena of the feudal nobility by a new emerging class, the bourgeoisie.\n\nThe playwright Christian Dietrich Grabbe (1801-1836), whose work played a significant role in German literature of the 1830s, was close to Immermann in aesthetic positions. The central work of Grabbe, which most fully embodied his social and aesthetic principles, is the drama Napoleon, or One Hundred Days (1831). The events of the play, especially the battle scenes, reminded the Germans of the recent struggle for national liberation, aroused opposition sentiments. It is no coincidence that this play was approved by the Young Germans.\n\nA leading place in German literature of the 1830s, along with Heine, was taken by Ludwig Boerne (1786-1837), a consistent in his convictions and active participant in the social and political struggle, a representative of the radical wing of the German petty middle class, a talented publicist.\n\nBoerne’s activities, which had a wide resonance in Germany, reflected a certain stage in the development of German bourgeois democracy. The process of economic development of the country, intensifying in the first half of the 19th century, entailed an ever greater deepening of the class differentiation of the third estate. Boerne was precisely the ideologist of the most leftist part of the German bourgeoisie, which protested both against the feudal regime and against the power of the emerging industrial and financial tycoons.\n\nA significant part of Boerne’s articles was devoted to theatrical life. “Dramaturgical sheets”, which later compiled a separate collection, were written by the pen of a militant revolutionary publicist. Boerne uses the form of theatrical review to sharply criticize the social life of the then Germany. After the July Revolution, Boerne, impelled by the intensifying persecution against him, moved to Paris.\n\nAmong Boerne’s works, the Paris Letters (1830-1833), which painted a vivid and broad picture of the life of France in the early years of the July Monarchy, had a particularly great influence on the literary and social life of Germany in the 1830s.\n\nIncorruptible honesty and consistent struggle against the feudal monarchy and big business, the outstanding talent of a publicist made Boerne one of the leading figures of the progressive camp in Germany. Young Engels called him “the standard-bearer of German freedom, the only husband of Germany in his time.”\n\nHowever, Boerne’s positive socio-political program was marked by the stamp of utopia, for many representatives of the then German democracy, which was based on the petty bourgeoisie and the artisan proletariat. Boerne and his associates strove to achieve the establishment of a republic of small owners, the economic basis of which would be universal material equality. In his passionate struggle for the fastest solution of topical political issues (the elimination of estate privileges and the overthrow of feudal regimes in Germany), Boerne did not see real prospects for historical development, and sometimes he treated art issues in a vulgar way.\n\nThe turning point in the development of German literature was vividly expressed in the work of the literary group, which already in the 1830s was called Young Germany. The core of this group were the writers Karl Gutzkow, Ludolf Winbarg, Heinrich Laube, Theodor Mundt, Gustav Kuehne.\n\nYoung Germans opposed the tradition of Romanticism, sought to bring literature closer to reality, to social and political life.\n\nAs a single literary group or school, Young Germany existed for a very short time. If at the beginning of the 1830s there was some ideological and aesthetic unity in the literary works of a number of young writers, then after the decision of the Union Parliament and the unfolding censorship and political persecutions, the Young Germans, with the exception of Winbarg and to some extent Gutzkow, turned out to be, in essence, renegades in relation to their former ideals, hurrying to testify their allegiance to the Prussian monarchy. On the whole, however, the impact of Young Germany as a general trend on German literature continues until about the turn of the 1830s-40s. And, of course, the Prussian king Frederick William IV was well aware of the complete harmlessness of the former Young Germans for the Prussian government when in 1842 he lifted the censorship restrictions directed against these writers.\n\nThe defeat of the revolution of 1848-1849 dramatically changed the nature of national literature in Germany. German literature is rapidly losing the broad international authority that it gained from the late 18th century and the first half of the 19th century, especially during the era of Goethe and the Romantics. Fearing the activity of the social lower classes, the cowardly German liberal capitalist class did not achieve either the elimination of the feudal-monarchical regime or the national unity of fragmented Germany in the course of the revolution. Having betrayed the ideals of the revolution, the liberal burghers chooses the path of compromise with the feudal-Junker elite, who retained in their hands and consolidated political power. At the same time, this compromise gave impetus to the rapid development of the capitalist mode of production, and national unity was achieved by “iron and blood” – the Bismarckian “revolution” from above under Prussian rule in 1871.\n\nIn such a political environment, philosophical thought loses its former optimistic and humanistic orientation. In this regard, the enormous popularity that the pessimistic work of Arthur Schopenhauer The World as Will and Representation (1818-1844) receives among the German intelligentsia of the second half of the 19th century is noteworthy.\n\nSome representatives of German literature fundamentally dissociate themselves from a great social and ideological content (the Munich literary circle – Paul Heyse, Emanuel Geibel, etc.). The so-called trivial literature is becoming widespread – entertainment and adventure (Kurt May), vulgar sentimental (E. Marlit) novels, literature that asserted the imperial ideas of Pan-Germanist chauvinism (F. Dahn, E. Wildenbruch, and others).\n\nGerman literature finds itself within the narrow framework of provincialism, the so-called regionalism, developing a range of topics related only to the living conditions of a particular province. The term “critical realism” (for all its inadequacy), with which we designate the defining direction in the literatures of France and England after 1830, is completely inapplicable to the literature of these decades in Germany (and especially after 1848), where one can speak only in connection with the work of Theodor Fontane, a novelist of the 1870s. And although the leading German prose writers of the 1840-60s considered themselves (and with sufficient reason) realists, they, again, with no less reason, both in theory and in their work, asserted their understanding of realism, designating it as “poetic realism” (the term of Otto Ludwig), who set himself the task not of a merciless analysis of reality, but of its idealization, softening of its contradictions. It is in this vein that many features of the work of Theodor Storm, Wilhelm Raabe, Otto Ludwig are determined.\n\nCHAPTER 2: EARLY (JENA) ROMANTICISM\n\nThe founders of the school of Jena romanticism were the brothers Schlegel, Friedrich and August Wilhelm, who settled in Jena in 1796. At the University of Jena, the Schlegel brothers, Fichte and other young teachers are fighting the routine professorship, and in the Schlegel house a kind of center of ideological opposition is formed. Frequent visitors to this house are Novalis (pseudonym of Friedrich von Hardenberg), physicist Ritter, naturalist Steffens, philosophers Schelling and Fichte; an aspiring young writer Ludwig Tieck often comes here from Berlin. Tieck, in turn, was associated through close personal friendship and shared views on literature and art with W. G. Wackenroder and the Berlin pastor and theologian F. D. Schleiermacher. Goethe is also a guest of this house. At first, Schiller maintained close personal and creative contacts with the Schlegel brothers, especially with the elder August.\n\nThe beginning of the publication of the Athenaeum magazine in 1797 strengthened the organizational foundations of the Jena school and at the same time made its activities even more strongly opposed to modern reality, but not so much to its socio-political as to some ideological aspects.\n\nJena Romanticism developed in an atmosphere of advanced socio-political ideas that the revolution of the late 18th century put forward and sought to carry out. in France, and he could not help but experience their fruitful influence. Novalis and Friedrich Schegel originally welcomed the revolution, while Tieck dreamed of becoming a volunteer in the French Republican army and fight against the European coalition. At the same time, rejecting not only the results of the French Revolution, but also the paths of development in general, the Jena Romantics in the conditions of the feudal backwardness of Germany thereby remained outside the forces of social progress, carrying in their worldview and social positions the potential for rapprochement with the camp of reaction. They were alien to the belief in the implementation of the advanced ideals of the French Revolution in the future. They were neither reactionaries nor restorers of medieval relations, but their search for a just non-bourgeois ideal became retrospective and often expressed itself in the idealization of the distant past, usually the Middle Ages, which they nevertheless strove to correlate with modern social development (Novalis’ utopia). At the same time, in the utopian ideal of the Jena Romantics, the emphasis was not on the social, but on the aesthetic side.\n\nBut in the new artistic vision of the world, which the Jena Romantics asserted, their inevitable losses arose in comparison with classicism and the Enlightenment. They consisted primarily in adherence to the so-called disinterested art, which has no tasks outside of itself. The implementation of this principle carried not only a denial of the flat utilitarianism of the epigones of the Enlightenment, but ultimately also a rejection of the high civic educational mission of art. Denying the social and political practice of the developing bourgeois society, the Jena Romantics came to a conscious separation of art from social and political life in general.\n\nThe aesthetic system of the Jena Romantics, taken in its entirety, is characterized, first of all, by a subjective vision of the world, a desire to get away from depicting real concrete historical reality. But if one examines the entire completeness of the content of this system, taking into account all its tendencies, then one cannot fail to notice that the leading points just noted are by no means exhaustive for it. As a concrete analysis of the aesthetic positions of the Schlegel brothers, Wackenroder, Tieck, and even Novalis, the most subjectivist of the Jena Romantics, shows, their theoretical searches contain certain potential prospects for an objective reflection of reality. It is no accident that it was the Jena romantics who were the first to make a significant contribution to the development of the theory of the novel, and from their subjective-Romantic positions they foresaw its rapid flourishing in the literature of the XIX century.\n\nBut the very subjective psychologism of the Jena Romantics, their appeal to the disclosure of the wealth of the inner world of man, to a large extent prepared the subsequent realistic development of characters.\n\nEach national literature had its own preconditions for the emergence and development of Romanticism, but the activities of the Jena Romantics are largely at the origins of the development of European Romanticism. It is them who have the priority and the greatest depth in the development of the theory of Romanticism. The ideas of the Jena school, especially thanks to the activities of August Schlegel, had a wide resonance outside Germany and in a number of cases had a huge influence on the aesthetics of romanticism in almost all countries of Europe and the USA; the aesthetic thought of Russia also responded to the activities of the Jena Romantics.\n\nIn their philosophical quests, the Jena Romantics turned primarily to Kant, since he emphasized the primacy of personality in his ethics.\n\nAs we know, the main contradiction of the Kantian philosophical concept lies in its dualism – in the assumption of the existence of a thing in itself, the material world, regardless of the existence of the subject as a carrier of a priori thinking. This incompleteness of the subjectivism of the Kantian system did not satisfy the romantics who strove to assert the total role of the “I” in the universe. Therefore, their quest was much more consistent with the ideas of Fichte, set forth in his Science Teachings (1794). Many of the main provisions of the philosophical and aesthetic system of the early Jena Romantics turned out to be connected with these ideas.\n\nCompared with the philosophical concept of Kant, Fichte deepens and makes much more consistent the subjectivist concept of the universe, freeing it from Kantian dualism. Denying Kant’s proposition about the existence of a thing-in-itself, i.e. objective real world, Fichte argues that the activity of the absolute “I” is the original force that creates the entire universe. Fichte’s “I” is the “I” taken to the highest degree of generalization of this concept, as a certain initial philosophical principle of the existence of all that exists.\n\nPerceiving the general model of Fichte’s absolute “I” and its creative role in the universe, the Jena Romantics made certain adjustments to this model, trying to remove the contradictions of Fichte’s subjectivism in relation to idealistic monism. Therefore, they make a conscious substitution of Fichte’s absolute philosophical “I” by the concrete empirical “I” of an individual person.\n\nThis substitution was combined with the belief of the Jena Romantics in the primary role of art in human existence, in the universe as a whole.\n\nTowards the end of the existence of the Jena community, some of its members showed a certain departure from the subjectivist concept of Fichte towards the ideas of objective idealism in the spirit of Schelling, who at the beginning of his career was in close personal and creative contacts with the writers of this group. Many of Schelling’s early ideas were formed in an atmosphere of active spiritual communication and exchange of thoughts with other members of the Jena group. Both sides strove to overcome both the Kantian dualism and the dualistic contradictions of Fichte’s subjectivism.\n\nSoon after the death of Novalis in 1801 and as a result of some other circumstances, the Jena group ceases to exist, which does not prevent its former members from maintaining their creative activity. However, all the most significant and constructive was created by them during the existence of the Jena school.\n\nOne of the most talented theorists of Jena Romanticism was Friedrich Schlegel (1772-1829), who underwent a noticeable evolution in his aesthetic and social positions. Having perceived the educational ideology and the advanced ideas of the French Revolution (the most significant work of this plan is the article “Georg Forster”, 1797), he focused on the development of Romantic theory. After the dissolution of the Jena circle, Schlegel shows interest in mysticism and religion. He converts to Catholicism, his social and political views become reactionary. At this time, he creates a number of interesting works.\n\nThe concept of a new romantic literature was developed by Friedrich Schlegel in his Fragments (published in 1798 in the Athenaeum magazine).\n\nConsidering Romantic literature a new stage in the literary process, Friedrich Schlegel, as one of its characteristic features, notes that it is in constant development, and therefore he calls it progressive. Another distinctive feature of the new literature, Schlegel considers its universality, which, in his opinion, means the creation of a kind of syncretic genre of literature, which should include not only all literary genres that have existed until now, but also philosophy and rhetoric. This principle of universalism was not characteristic of the subsequent development of German literature, except for the prose of Heine. Attempts to create such universal works by the Jena Romantics themselves bore the stamp of experiment. The range of contradictions of Schlegel’s romantic aesthetics is very wide, without losing interest in civic ideas, in the ideals of the French Revolution, recognizing a social function for universal poetry, he still focuses on the subjective factor, from a subjective standpoint, comprehending the principle of freedom in this literature; relying on the philosophical system of Fichte, Schlegel puts the personality of the artist as the central figure of all that exists (“What kind of philosophy falls to the lot of the poet? A creative philosophy based on the concept of freedom and faith in oneself, showing how the human spirit dictates laws to everything that exists and that the world is a work of his art”).\n\nFriedrich Schlegel is also of great importance in the development of the theory of Romantic irony, which occupies one of the most important places in the circle of questions characterizing the programs of the Jena school. The role of this theory in the complex of their philosophical and aesthetic ideas is determined by two main factors: its most important value for the subsequent development of romanticism and of philosophical and aesthetic thought in general, and the fact that it most vividly expresses the romantic interpretation of the personality in the universe. Schlegel emphasizes that the philosophical measles of irony is directly and directly related to Fichte’s concept.\n\nFor Fichte, the author of Science Teachings, the concept of freedom, equivalent to that ethical ideal, towards which the absolute “I” strives, realizing itself in constant action, is fundamental in his system. Just as Fichte’s absolute “I” strives for an endless realization of itself in the ethical ideal of freedom and never comes to the end of this process, so the personality of the artist in Friedrich Schlegel, being limited in its capabilities, constantly strives to reveal itself in the ideal, “to the fullness of the statement,” while realizing the impossibility of achieving this fullness. It is the awareness of this insoluble contradiction that gives rise to the so-called ironic act, which entails self-parodying, buffoonery and “genuine transcendental buffoonery” as a consciousness of one’s own powerlessness.\n\nAt the same time, an ironic act, contradictory in its essence, demonstrates not only the artist’s understanding of the insolubility of a contradiction, but also the strength of this artist, which consists in the full manifestation of the freedom of his personality, since the very awareness of the insolubility of a contradiction gives him the opportunity to rise “above all conditioned”, i.e. .e. objective, real world, which includes the personality of the artist, and his work, and the squalor of provincial philistine Germany.\n\nIrony itself is interpreted by Friedrich Schlegel as a predominantly philosophical and aesthetic category, as a kind of play of the spirit, free from the expression of any social, civic functions of literature. Revealing his understanding of irony in works of art, Schlegel carries out an idea that is important both for this theory and for the worldview positions of the Jena Romantics in general. This is the antithesis between art and everything “conditioned”, that is, concrete, real world, real social relations.\n\nA bright and original theorist, Friedrich Schlegel was little gifted as an artist. Of the few works of art he wrote, the story Lucinde (1799) deserves attention. It is a kind of experimental work, written according to the prescribed recipes of Romantic aesthetics, as it was presented by Friedrich Schlegel. The story affirms the Romantic ideal of an independent free individual. Moreover, this personality appears in its main modification for Romantics: the heroes of the story, Julius and Lucinde, are artists by vocation, and not by their social status, not by profession. The idea of ââthe artist’s complete freedom is brought to the maximum expression in these characters. Julius and Lucinda live only for themselves, they are completely satisfied only with mutual communication. They have no conflicts with reality. Real life-affirming intonations play an important role in the characteristics of the heroes of the story, in its entire philosophy of being. “We live in the most beautiful of worlds” – this idea is affirmed in various versions in Lucinde. But the appeal to real life is limited in Lucinde by a very narrow framework, for the portrayal of the relationship between Julius and Lucinde outside any social context is, of course, an artificial construction.\n\nFriedrich Schlegel’s story was a kind of gospel of a new Romantic ethics. In Lucinde there was a stormy Romantic protest against the official, philistine, generally accepted norms of morality and marriage. The free relationship of Julius and Lucinda, not sanctified either by the church or by other official institutions, was contrasted by the author with the immorality of most legal marriage unions.\n\nTo the same extent as the ethical concept of Lucinde opposed generally accepted norms, its artistic and aesthetic principles, which were demonstratively opposed to the aesthetics of classicism and the Enlightenment, were completely new and unusual – the novel completely rejects the completeness of the artistic form, logical composition and other usual formal components of prosaic storytelling.\n\nThe most gifted artist in the Jena circle, an original and profound thinker was Novalis (real name Friedrich von Hardenberg) (1772-1801), who was the most characteristic and vivid exponent of the entire aesthetic, philosophical and ideological system of the Jena Romantics. Disappointment in the French Revolution led him to idealize the institutions of the obsolete feudal system, with which he connects his idea of ââa perfect social order. These ideas are developed in his publicistic works – fragments of Faith and Love (1798) and the article Christianity or Europe (1799). Novalis went further than Schlegel in asserting the principle of subjectivity. He dreamed of such complete freedom and such a perfect strength of the human spirit, when the entire external world would correspond to the will of man. Consciously replacing Fichte’s absolute (philosophical) “I” with the empirical “I” of a specific individual, Novalis, in the spirit of Fichte’s subjectivism, develops his theory of “magical idealism” as an expression of faith in the unlimited creative potential of an individual. At the same time, he puts forward the concept of “romanticizing the world” – combining the real with the ideal, transcendental categories with the concepts of life practice, raising the ordinary to the transcendental.\n\nNovalis’ aesthetics is in full accordance with his philosophical positions. He sees the meaning of poetry in prophecy, absolutizes art, taking it beyond the rational, beyond the determinism of reality. He sees the essence of Romantic poetics in “the art in a certain way to achieve attraction with mystery, to make an object mysterious and at the same time familiar and tempting.” Novalis admits the possibility of poetry, devoid of content, poetry, consisting only of “euphonious, full of beauty words, but without any meaning and connection.” True poetry, in his opinion, can only be a great allegory. “The novel should not have any purpose, it is absolute in its intrinsic value.” The spirit of poetry, according to Novalis, can only be embodied in the fabulously miraculous. He identifies the whole real world with a fairy tale.\n\nThe poet is the central figure of such a universe, only he can access the innermost secrets of existence. The poet is a chosen person, endowed with the gift of providence and true all-pervading wisdom. “A poet understands nature better than a scientist. Only an artist can comprehend the meaning of life.” The poet and the priest are combined for Novalis in one person. All these ideas are contained in the fragments of Novalis’ Flower Dust.\n\nNovalis took a prominent place in the development of German lyrics as the author of the deeply inspired poetic cycle Hymns to the Night (1800). In it, he develops his monistic concept of being and death. The philosophical understanding of the problem of life and death has here a certain religious-church coloring and is directly linked in the fifth hymn with the myth of Christ. This poetic cycle is permeated with yearning for death-night. The author is burdened by earthly existence, strives for unity with his beloved Sophie (who had died just 15 years old) beyond the threshold of earthly existence. But the antithesis of day and night, life and death, or rather, what will happen after death, should be understood in the Hymns not at all as a denial of earthly being, but as a desire to affirm the infinity of human existence, not limited only by his earthly hypostasis.\n\nNovalis embodied his main aesthetic ideas in the novel Heinrich von Ofterdingen (1800; of the two outlined parts, the second was just begun).\n\nNovalis chose the minnesinger of the early thirteenth century as the historical prototype for his hero. The main ideas and the whole concept of the novel are revealed as an expanded aesthetic utopia, the meaning of which is concentrated in the allegorical tale of the protagonist Klingsor. Novalis projects his aesthetic utopia into Germany’s feudal past. But it would be completely wrong to believe that in the novel he idealizes the feudal Middle Ages and calls for its restoration. Germany at the beginning of the 13th century in the novel has little in common with the Germany of that time. Novalis sets his task in the novel not so much to show the picture of feudal relations in an idealized light as to create a romantic atmosphere of a poetic half-fairy idyll, which supposedly was the German Middle Ages – “a thoughtful Romantic era, concealing greatness under a modest dress”.\n\nNovalis’ novel is far from the chaotic and fragmentary composition of Friedrich Schlegel’s Lucinde. Its construction is well thought out and has a harmonious logical character. Heinrich von Ofterdingen is a clear and deliberate antithesis to Goethe’s novel Wilhelm Meister. Novalis opposes the philosophical and aesthetic principles of Jena romanticism to the Enlightening understanding of the tasks of art. However, the authority of Goethe as the most significant German writer of those years remained unshakable in the eyes of Novalis. Recreating the image of Goethe in the image of Klingsor, the author portrays the latter as the greatest poet. Heinrich is his student. Novalis’ novel became, in a sense, a classic work of romantic literature, because it especially clearly sounded the idea of ââstriving for a vague and indefinite romantic ideal, symbolized in the image of the “blue flower”. This symbol, in turn, merges with the ideal lover, which Heinrich finds in Matilda, then, having lost her, finds again in her reincarnation – in Cyan. But the symbol of the “blue flower” in the novel has a much broader meaning than the association with the beloved. The ideal is not only love. This is the path of knowledge through which the hero of Novalis must go. The beloved is only a part of this ideal, only a milestone on this grandiose path of comprehending truth and beauty.\n\nUnlike most members of the Jena community, Ludwig Tieck (1773-1853) was not well disposed to theoretical pursuits, but had a bright creative talent, which was most fully manifested precisely in the years of his “Jena” youth. Lyrics, novels, dramas, short stories are genres developed by the young writer. As the author of wonderful romantic novellas, the novel about an artist (Kuenstlerroman) The Wanderings of Franz Sternbald (1798), Tieck has retained its readers to this day. His best dramatic work, included in the gold fund of German national drama, was the comedy Puss in Boots (1797), in which the author ironically and ingeniously mocks the vulgar rationalism of Berlin’s philistine theater-goers, brought up on the models of epigone-enlightenment plays. Tieck’s comedy has become a classic. an example of the embodiment of the theory of romantic irony.\n\nCHAPTER 3: LATE ROMANTICISM\n\nThe significant changes that the stormy era of Napoleonic and anti-Napoleonic wars brought about for Germany, as well as for all of Europe, brought new features to the character of German romanticism. Along with the further development of the romantic tradition inherent in the activities of the Jena romantics, the anti-Napoleonic liberation struggle of 1806-1813 played an important role here. Theoretical searches, philosophical and aesthetic problems, which so saturated the searches of the early romantics, are now receding into the background. Late romanticism enters the stage of more concrete artistic thinking, reflecting at the same time the general tendency of romanticism to embrace the objective phenomena of reality. One of the central accents is the national German tradition associated with the patriotic rise of the national self-consciousness of the German people in the struggle against foreign occupation. It was the late Romantics who enriched the German national culture, drawing from the treasury of national legends, tales and songs. Based on folk song tradition, German lyric poetry experiences a complete renewal and extraordinary flourishing in the works of Brentano, MÃ¼ller, Eichendorf, Heine, Uhland, Chamisso. The tradition of German novelism, which goes back to the works of the early Tieck, is brilliantly developed in creativity.\n\nAt the same time, national orientation often entailed nationalist tendencies, idealization of feudal vestiges, the idea of ââa peculiar feudal-patriarchal nationality.\n\nThe late romantics Clemens Brentano and Achim von Arnim formed the nucleus of what became known as the Heidelberg Romantics. The brothers Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, and Joseph von Eichendorf were close to them.\n\nClemens Brentano (1778-1842) wrote a bright page in the history of German Romanticism. It is noteworthy that, being a passionate adherent of the early romantics and being in close personal contacts with them, Brentano, as an artist, left the bosom of Jena Romanticism, but laid new qualities in the further development of this trend. Thus, in his novel Godwi (1801), the influence of the romantics of the Jena school is clearly perceptible, and at the same time the beginning of a new modification of the German Romantic novel is already opening here, which in the Heidelberg romantics is noticeably closer to objective reality.\n\nEven more significant was Brentano’s contribution to the development of German lyric poetry. His merit in this area lies in the fact that, picking up the undertakings of the Sturmers, he enriched German poetry with elements of folklore. The Romantic reform of German verse, which was initiated by Brentano, of course, largely deprived German lyrics of the breadth of social content, aimed at philosophical saturation (over time, these losses will be made up for in Heine’s romantic poetry). But in return, German poetry will become simpler, more democratic, more accessible to a wide range of readers, and its national orientation will increase.\n\nIn many aspects of his lyrics, Brentano is a typically Romantic poet. In particular, he is exclusively subjective, his poems are deeply personal in nature, which is felt sometimes even where an objectively narrative folk ballad beginning gets a strong sound. It is no coincidence that almost all of his early lyrics are love lyrics. But as social relations are disharmonious, so is love devoid of harmony. Together with joy, she inevitably carries in herself suffering, the caresses of the beloved are changeable and fickle. In a number of Brentano’s love poems, an irrational interpretation of love arises.\n\nAs in his poetic vision of the world, Brentano departs more and more from the Jena Romantics, he seeks to more actively saturate his lyrics with folk motives, increasingly uses the techniques of national German folklore. Among the poems of Brentano, written in the folk tradition, one should especially note Lorelei – a song that the main character Violetta sings at the end of the novel Godwi. Having no direct source in folk poetry, being completely the fruit of Brentano’s fantasy, this song nevertheless gave rise to an independent romantic legend that organically fits into the national German culture. Becoming a kind of symbol of Romantic lyrics, Brentano’s Lorelei even created a certain poetic tradition in German romanticism, but the basis of which arose the poetic masterpiece of European romanticism: the immortal Lorelei by Heine.\n\nBrentano’s influence on the subsequent development of Romantic lyrics in Germany is associated not only with his personal creative activity as a poet, but also with the collection of German folk songs, to which, together with his friend Arnim, he devoted much effort. The collection of folk poems, songs and ballads The Boy’s Magic Horn (1806-1808) includes materials related to the 16th-18th centuries, including, in addition to direct sources, some poems by a number of famous German poets of that time, and a number of original poems by Brentano himself.\n\nNot being the fruit of strictly scientific folkloristic studies, The Boy’s Magic Horn achieved its main goal: it gave the reader a broad understanding of the high aesthetic merits of the social consciousness of the German people. And this was done at a time when the question of national unity was for Germany one of the most pressing socio-political issues.\n\nHowever, traces of a certain bias in the selection of the songs of The Magic Horn are quite palpable. In the collection, the spirit of anti-feudal protest is completely muffled, only in very few songs can you find such intonations. On the contrary, the compilers assert feudal morality and legitimacy: anyone who dares to protest against those in power will face a cruel punishment. When you get acquainted with the collection, the abundance of spiritual songs is clearly striking. Songs for soldiers, songs with a military theme compete in their number with spiritual songs, which to some extent reflected both the nature of the historical position of Germany in those periods and, at the same time, its modern military-political situation. This is especially true of military songs, in which patriotic intonations are clearly heard (Song of the Battle). However, other war songs idealize outright military robbery (Old Landsknecht).\n\nAt the beginning of their career, the brothers Grimm, Jacob (1785-1863) and Wilhelm (1786-1859) were close to the Heidelberg romantics, who made a major contribution to the development of German philological science and folklore. The fruit of their folkloristic research was the collection Children’s and Family Tales in three volumes, published in 1822.\n\nCHAPTER 4: HEINRICH VON KLEIST\n\nThe bright and deeply dramatic talent of Heinrich von Kleist (1777-1811) demonstrates the profound transformation of German Romanticism.\n\nComing from a poor noble family of a hereditary Prussian officer, at 22, Kleist boldly breaks with family traditions, forever parting with the officer’s uniform. He becomes an eternal homeless wanderer, often for no apparent reason changing his occupation and temporary refuge, nowhere finding a place for himself. And always and everywhere – a bright creative burning and an ambitious dream “to pluck the laurel crown from Goethe’s brow.” But instead – just a chain of bitter disappointments. Having achieved neither fame nor material well-being, dreaming only that each written work would provide him with the most modest opportunities to work on the next one, having met, in his sincere and deep patriotism, only cold hostility from King Frederick William III and his court, Kleist decides on suicide, the thought of which had occurred to him more than once before.\n\nThe most striking accomplishments of the creative spirit of Kleist relate to drama and short stories.\n\nHis time, associated with the replacement of crumbling feudal foundations with new bourgeois-capitalist social relations, Kleist perceived as an era of collision of irrational forces beyond the control of human will and reason. He considers the absurd misunderstandings and everyday conflicts in his private life to be a manifestation of the fatal nonsense that prevails in the world. Hence the dominant idea of ââsome of his dramas is the idea of ââfate. It was in this spirit that Kleist’s dramatic first-born, The Stroffenstein Family (1803), a kind of classic example of “tragedy of fate”, was written.\n\nThe breadth of Kleist’s creative range and at the same time the complexity of his creative method manifested itself, in particular, in the fact that two comedies, The Broken Jug (1805) and Amphitrion (1807) are adjacent to his experiments in the field of romantic drama, the first of which is included among the masterpieces of German classical drama and to this day has been successfully staged on the stages of German theaters. It can hardly be assumed that Kleist set out to show the social contrasts of the German countryside in this comedy. But it must be admitted that the characters in the play are clearly divided into two groups according to social criteria: judges and peasants. Moreover, the entire group of the latter is outlined with the author’s undubted sympathy.\n\nA keen perception of the contradictory German reality, as it were, switches Kleist into a completely different moral and psychological atmosphere, so opposite to the elements of cheerful laughter in The Broken Jug and Amphitryon: he abandons the enlightened and pure, harmonious in its integrity and morality, image of the female images of Eve and Alcmene, and creates, perhaps, the most controversial of his works, the drama Penthesilea (1808), in which he uses one of the versions of the ancient myth about the queen of the Amazons who took part in the Trojan War on the side of the Trojans, as is mentioned in the Iliad. The clash of violent passions underlying the drama is given not only to the highest degree of tension, which is in itself generally characteristic of romanticism, but also in such a qualitative expression that is inherent in Kleist. The hypertrophy of romantic passion gets a manifestation that goes beyond the norm.\n\nThe Jena catastrophe of 1806 caused a sharp change in public attitudes and creative orientation of Kleist. Previously, he considered himself, in the traditions of Enlightenment cosmopolitanism, a citizen of the world, sought to abandon any socio-political topicality, directed his searches into the sphere of pure science, into the area of ââRousseauist denial of modern civilization, as an artist gravitated towards abstract moral and ethical problems (The Stroffenstein Family, to a large extent The Broken Jug, The Marquise of O), to the fabulous mythological plots of Amphitryon and Penthesileia. Now the poet feels inextricably linked with the fate of his homeland, experiences its humiliation hard, becomes a hater of the French occupiers, a Prussian-German patriot, whose patriotism sometimes borders on chauvinistic hatred of the French. This tendency towards French-eating is very noticeable in the drama The Battle of Hermann (published 1821). National-German problems in drama, short stories and lyrics express the general ideological orientation of his artistic work. It is no accident that now Kleist pays great attention to journalism. These new tendencies bring him closer to late German Romanticism. In this regard, the periodization of the writer’s creative path is quite clearly defined. The first period (approximately) lasts from 1801 to 1807, the second from 1808 to 1811.\n\nThe Romantic idea of ââall-consuming passion received a different embodiment in the drama Kaethchen of Heilbronn (1810), a work more significant than Penthesilea both in the coverage of the phenomena of reality and in the degree of artistic completeness. The German Middle Ages is an organic ideological and artistic component in this drama, in contrast to the role of a purely conditional props, which does not contribute anything to the disclosure of national problems, which is assigned to it in Kleist’s creative firstborn The Stroffenstein Family. The spirit of the times and the leading ideological and aesthetic tendencies of late romanticism were reflected here in the writer’s appeal to the traditions of national folklore. The plot basis of the drama is gleaned by the author in the motive of the true and false bride, widespread in the fairy tales of different peoples, which existed in the German fairy-tale and folklore heritage. Kleist embodies this motif in the genre of “knightly drama”, as evidenced by the subtitle: “A great historical performance from the times of knights.” This genre had a rich tradition in German literature, born more than thirty years earlier by Goethe’s drama Goetz von Berlichingen and developed in its own way by the later romantics. Following some principles of their worldview and aesthetics, and to some extent paying tribute to fashionable literary tastes, Kleist introduces a mystical element into the development of a folklore motif, which is of no small importance both for the plot of the drama and for the image of the main character.\n\nKleist embodied in Kaethchen his ideal of a woman, infinitely devoted to a man, but deliberately shifted the emphasis in her characterization. Annoyed by the slavish obsession of the girl who follows him everywhere, sleeping with his horses, the count kicks her, prostrating at his feet like a dog, which does not make the mystically obsessed Kaethchen less devoted to the count. The author, perhaps, was aware of the incompatibility of this scene with the real plan of the narrative. If Penthesileia, which manifests itself completely incongruous with the logic of the female character, was placed by Kleist in the atmosphere of myth, so his Kaethchen is shown in a widely represented fairy-tale frame. It is no coincidence that her antipode Kunigunde is a character already completely constructed according to the canons of a fairy tale.\n\nIn the socio-critical tendency of the drama, Kleist clearly gravitates towards a realistic manner, not always organically and consistently combining it with the Romantic basis of the conflict and the central image.\n\nIn the drama The Battle of Hermann, Kleist, carefully recreating the historical and national flavor, successfully drawing signs of the way of life and customs of the ancient Germanic tribes, creates a poignant political pamphlet in a dramatic form that raises pressing issues of our time. The legions of the Roman emperor Augustus occupying German lands are associated with the Napoleonic army conquering modern Germany.\n\nSinging in this drama the patriotic feat of the leader of the Cherusci, Hermann (Arminius), who, thanks to the alliance with Marbod, completely defeated the Roman legions of Varus in the Teutoburg Forest, Kleist at the same time, in the image of Hermann, painted the ideal figure of that Prussian monarch who, sacrificing all his personal property, would lead to a decisive struggle against Napoleon of other German princes. The Prussian king Frederick Wilhelm III was, as is known, very far from this ideal. In the fight against the enslavers, the author justifies any means – deception, betrayal, provocation, murder of the defenseless. This can also explain the presence in the play of naturalistic scenes of the cruel, inhuman massacre of the Romans by the Cherusci.\n\nGerman history also draws the plot of Kleist’s last drama Prince Friedrich of Homburg (published 1821), a talented and brilliant work that had considerable stage success after the death of the author and appears in modern theatrical repertoires.\n\nThe drama Prince Friedrich of Homburg, similar in its ideological sound to The Battle of Hermann, arose in the same political atmosphere of the defeats of Austria and Prussia, passionately and persistently expressing the author’s hope for an active struggle for national liberation. If in the first drama this hope is associated with a nationwide unification of Germans under the leadership of one leader, then in Prince Friedrich of Homburg the main political idea is concentrated in the image of an ideal monarch. Kleist belonged to those who were in Germany both before the defeat of Jena and after him expected active military and political actions from Frederick William III. Hence the writer’s sharply critical attitude to the Prussian king, which was already preceded by his Rousseauist denial of noble privileges, rejection of the modern Prussian military and state apparatus.\n\nHowever, it would be a mistake to interpret this work only as an expression of a certain political idea through artistic means. In this sense, with all its topical tendentiousness, Prince Friedrich of Homburg is still less a purely propaganda play than The Battle of Hermann. Kleist significantly deepens the psychological motivation of the image of the main character here, a whole group of main characters is more subtly and versatile individualized, the dramatic collision of the play is developed more thoroughly and deeper.\n\nPrince Friedrich of Homburg by its aesthetic nature, by the nature of the ideological and artistic embodiment of the main conflict, is a romantic drama, reproducing the characteristic romantic antithesis of the hero and society. The young prince is a further development of the Kleistian romantic character, various aspects of which were already embodied by the writer in the images of Penthesilea, Alcmene and Kaethchen. Just like these characters, who are guided in their actions by the dictates of passion, of their heart and, by virtue of this, come into conflict with generally accepted norms, the Prince of Homburg is, as it were, immersed in the inner world of his soul. Despite the warning of his subordinates, the prince during the battle violates the disposition and thereby the will of the Elector, placing himself, his desire, his impulse over them. And the author fully justifies his hero, because, in his opinion, it is precisely this self-will that leads him to victory. True, trying not to make a rebel out of his hero, Kleist admits a completely different interpretation of the prince’s act. Like Kaethchen, he is prone to somnambulistic trance. And at the time when the disposition is dictated, he almost does not hear it, being immersed in the memories of a sweet dream, of glory and his beloved, of whom he dreamed in this trance.\n\nMoreover, painting the image of an ideal monarch and, in accordance with this, confronting the prince and the elector in conflict, Kleist in every possible way avoids belittling the latter. The character of the prince is carefully developed in the drama, given in evolution (Kleist takes him through a deep crisis) and in sharp moral and psychological contradictions.\n\nThe antipode of the prince elector is also revealed in the evolution of his character. If not with a predetermined author’s intention, then at least objectively this image sounded like an instructive example to Frederick William III. Kleist’s “Great Elector” not only bravely and energetically leads the armed struggle for national independence and further strengthening of his state, but also, being fully autocratic ruler, he listens to the advice of his assistants, is able to deviate from the letter of the law, if necessary for the good of the homeland. He revokes the death sentence of the prince and solemnly awards him, awaiting execution, with a laurel wreath of the winner with a gold chain. The call to arms on the battlefield, to the destruction of all enemies of Brandenburg is the final powerful and acutely relevant chord of the drama for the then historical conditions (in the Russian translation of Boris Pasternak, the finale is weakened by the removal of this last call).\n\nDespite the fact that Kleist’s creative talent was most clearly manifested in drama, his short stories made a significant contribution to the development of this genre in German literature.\n\nNot all short stories (Kleist has eight of them) are equal in their artistic merit. Among them there are those that are insignificant both in the nature of the plot and in the depth of its development (The Beggar from Locarno), with an unnecessarily complicated, intricate plot (The Duel). In these and some other novellas, irrational factors, the element of the miraculous, play a significant, and sometimes a decisive role in the development of the action (Saint Cecilia, or the Power of Music). The action of most of Kleist’s short stories, as a rule, takes place outside Germany and in a more or less distant past, starting with the Middle Ages. The events described in the short story The Marquise of O are attributed to the end of the 18th century, and in the short story Betrothal in Santo Domingo to the beginning of the 19th century. In this regard, it should be noted that in his short stories, Kleist, in the spirit of romantic aesthetics, pays significant attention to historical themes. At the same time, as in traditional German romanticism, he is not attracted here either by a large-scale historical background, or significant events or social conflicts of the past. Social problems almost everywhere play a purely peripheral role and are not for Kleist the main task of artistic embodiment. Moral and ethical conflicts, the struggle between good and evil, the clash of the Rousseauian ideal of natural human relations, passions with social conventions – the development of these themes is devoted to both short stories and many of Kleist’s dramas.\n\nOne of the masterpieces of Kleist’s work and of all German prose in the genre of the novella is his story Michael Kohlhaas. The philosophical and ethical issues underlying all of Kleist’s work are also developed in this story, which interprets the idea of ââduty and justice. And although this philosophical and ethical concept plays an essential role here, it is relegated to the background, giving way to its widespread social embodiment.\n\nAs in the Romantic dramas of the writer (Kaethchen, Amphitryon, Penthesileia, Prince Friedrich of Homburg), the hero of the novel Michael Kohlhaas is a modification of the Kleistian romantic character, constructed and revealed again according to the Rousseauian principle, the essence of which is collision of natural human impulses with social conventions. The initial possibility, rather even the inevitability of this conflict is laid down in the very first paragraph of the novel, which gives a brief description of the moral character of Kohlhaas. From it we learn that he is an honest and God-fearing worker who loves his home and family, who is always ready to help his neighbor, a model of a loyal subject. And further, in the course of events, Kohlhaas is revealed as a person whose spiritual appearance is determined by one dominant passion – a highly developed sense of justice that determines all his actions.\n\nThe main character and conflict, conceived as Romantic, in this story, like in no other work of Kleist, receive such a deep social and concrete-historical determinism that the whole work is perceived as a whole as realistic, despite the romantic, irrational and mysterious story with a gypsy woman. into which the wife of Kohlhaas Liesbeth, killed by the landsknecht, is reincarnated. The idea of ââromantic passion, revealed in conflict, is realized in the story as a consistent and uncompromising struggle of a representative of the third estate for his rights against his social antagonists, the feudal nobility. When Kohlhaas exhausts all legal means to achieve justice, he enters into an open armed conflict with his opponents, becoming for some time the leader and banner for the oppressed. And it is not so important that the author himself not only does not share, but condemns these methods. It can be considered that Martin Luther is the mouthpiece of the author’s positions on this issue in the story (an episodic figure, outlined rather schematically). Kleist, with the objective sound of the story, was able to show, albeit in a relatively narrow historical aspect, the irreconcilable acuteness of class contradictions at a certain stage in the historical development of Germany. In this connection, the role of Kleistian historicism is especially strengthened. With the very first phrase of the story, he precisely defines the place and time of its action: “On the banks of the Havel in the middle of the sixteenth century lived a horse dealer Michael Kohlhaas.”\n\nThe main characters are clearly divided into social groups: the feudal chivalry with their minions and the third estate. And there is no need to guess at whose side the author’s sympathies are.\n\nMichael Kohlhaas is the only one of all Kleist’s works that, in terms of its political relevance, echoes his later dramas. It is with this aspect in mind that its finale and some of the political nuances of the story, already veiled for the current reader, but well understood by the writer’s contemporaries, are fully revealed. This is primarily the antithesis of Brandenburg and Saxony, consistently passing through the entire story. The Brandenburg resident Kohlhaas is deprived of his legal rights in Saxony, where he cannot find justice. Although the court environment of the Brandenburg Elector is portrayed in a negative light, the latter helps the hero to achieve the truth. And although Kohlhaas is executed according to the Brandenburg legal regulations for the lawlessness committed by him on Saxon land, his claim against the Junker Tronk is fully satisfied, the offender is punished to the fullest extent of the law, and the sons of the executed Elector of Brandenburg are knighted. It is he who is the supreme bearer of justice, which Kohlhaas fully recognizes. So retrospectively, in the development of a historical plot from the 16th century, Kleist testified to his political condemnation of Napoleon’s ally of Saxony and exalted in Brandenburg the contemporary Prussia, in which he wanted to see the main force in the fight against foreign occupation.\n\nCHAPTER 5: E. T. A. HOFFMANN\n\nAmong the writers of late German romanticism, one of the most prominent figures was Ernst Theodor Amadeus Hoffmann (1776-1822). Hoffmann is a European writer whose work outside his homeland has received a particularly wide response in Russia.\n\nHe was born into the family of a Prussian royal counsel. From his youthful years, a rich creative talent awakens in Hoffmann. He reveals considerable talent as a painter. But his main passion, to which he remains faithful throughout his life, is music. Playing many instruments, he thoroughly studied the theory of composition and became not only a talented performer, conductor, but also the author of a number of musical works.\n\nDespite his varied interests in the field of art, at the university, Hoffmann was forced for practical reasons to study law and choose a profession that is traditional in his family. He studies law diligently and with great success. After becoming an official in the legal department, he displays outstanding professional training, earning a reputation as an executive and capable lawyer.\n\nAfter graduating from the university in 1798, the agonizing years of service as an official of the judicial department in various cities of Prussia began, years filled with a passionate dream to devote oneself to art and the painful consciousness of the impossibility of realizing this dream.\n\nIn 1806, after the defeat of Prussia, Hoffmann lost his job, and with it, his livelihood. After Berlin, Bamberg, Leipzig, Dresden are the milestones of the thorny path along which, accompanied by various everyday misfortunes and rare glimpses of luck, Hoffmann walked, working as a theater conductor, decorator, teacher of singing and playing the piano.\n\nAnd only in 1814, when Napoleon was expelled from Germany, for Hoffmann the years of joyless wanderings come to an end. His hopes of getting a well-paid position in Berlin, in which he could apply his knowledge and talent in the field of music or painting, did not come true. The desperate financial situation forces him to accept the position procured by his close friend Hippel in the Ministry of Justice in the Prussian capital, which for Hoffmann was tantamount to, as he himself wrote about it, “returning to prison.” He fulfills his official duties, however, flawlessly and in 1818 he was appointed to a responsible post. But not success in the service, but the lively artistic and literary life of Berlin is primarily of interest to Hoffmann. In literary and musical Berlin, Hoffmann is a recognized figure.\n\nAt this time, changes are taking place in his social positions. In connection with the revival of the opposition movement, mainly among students, Hoffmann in 1820 was appointed a member of the commission to investigate political crimes. While very skeptical and mocking at the nationalist student unions, Hoffmann, however, as a lawyer and as a citizen is imbued with the spirit of those new advanced norms of bourgeois law and political ideas brought to Prussia from across the Rhine, which, overcoming the stubborn resistance of the old social and legal institutions, little by little suppressed police arbitrariness and limited personal royal interference in judicial procedures and court decisions. Being extremely dissatisfied with his new appointment, with which he associated “disgusting arbitrariness, cynical disrespect for all laws”, the writer demonstrated considerable civic courage by openly protesting in his appeals to the Minister of Justice against the lawlessness imposed by the commission. And his persistent demarches were not unsuccessful. But when it became known that in his fantastic novel Lord of the Fleas under the name of a certain crook Knarrpanti, Hoffmann ridiculed the chairman of the Kamptz commission, a prosecution was instituted against him under the obviously far-fetched pretext of divulging judicial secrets, which threatened the suspect with heavy punishment. And only agitated public opinion and active efforts of friends helped to terminate the case against the writer on condition that he removed a criminal place from the novel. Meanwhile, a rapidly developing serious illness – progressive paralysis – made it impossible for him to move independently. Hoffmann died on January 25, 1822.\n\nHaving entered literature at a time when the Jena and Heidelberg Romantics had already formulated and developed the basic principles of German romanticism, Hoffmann was a romantic artist. The nature of the conflicts underlying his works, their problems and the system of images, the very artistic vision of the world remain with him within the framework of romanticism. Like the Jena Romantics, the majority of Hoffmann’s works are based on the artist’s conflict with society. The original romantic antithesis of the artist and society is at the heart of the writer’s worldview. Following the Jena school, Hoffmann considers the creative personality to be the highest embodiment of the human “I” – an artist, an “enthusiast”, in his terminology, who has access to the world of art, the world of fairy-tale fantasy, those only spheres,where he can fully realize himself and find refuge from the real philistine everyday life.\n\nBut the embodiment and resolution of the Romantic conflict in Hoffmann is different from that of the early romantics. Through the denial of reality, through the artist’s conflict with it, the Jena Romantics rose to the highest level of their perception of the world – aesthetic monism, when the whole world became for them a sphere of poetic utopia, a fairy tale, a sphere of harmony in which the artist comprehends himself and the Universe. The romantic hero of Hoffmann lives in the real world (starting with the gentleman Gluck and ending with Kreisler). For all his attempts to break out of it into the world of art, into the fantastic fairy kingdom of Jinnistan, he remains surrounded by real concrete historical reality. Neither a fairy tale nor art can bring him harmony to this real world, which ultimately subjugates them. Hence the constant tragic contradiction between the hero and his ideals, on the one hand, and reality on the other. Hence the dualism, from which Hoffmann’s heroes suffer, the dualism in his works, the insolubility of the conflict between the hero and the outside world in most of them, the characteristic two-dimensional nature of the writer’s creative manner.\n\nOne of the essential components of Hoffmann’s poetics, like that of the early Romantics, is irony. Moreover, in Hoffmann’s irony as a creative device, which is based on a certain philosophical, aesthetic, worldview position, we can clearly distinguish two main functions. In one of them, he appears as a direct follower of the Jena Romantics. We are talking about those of his works in which purely aesthetic problems are solved and where the role of romantic irony is close to that which it plays among the Jena romantics. The romantic irony in these works of Hoffmann gets a satirical sound, but this satire has no social orientation. An example of the manifestation of such a function of irony is the short story Princess Brambilla, brilliant in its artistic performance and typically Hoffmannian in demonstration of the two-dimensional nature of his creative method. Following the Jena school, the author of the novel Princess Brambilla believes that irony should express “a philosophical view of life,” that is, be the basis of a person’s attitude to life. In accordance with this, like the Jena Romantics, irony is a means of resolving all conflicts and contradictions, a means of overcoming the “chronic dualism” from which the protagonist of this novel, actor Giglio Fava, suffers.\n\nIn line with this basic tendency, another and more essential function of his irony is revealed. If among the Jena Romantics, irony as an expression of a universal attitude towards the world became at the same time an expression of skepticism and refusal to resolve the contradictions of reality, then Hoffmann saturates irony with a tragic sound, for him it contains a combination of the tragic and the comic. The main bearer of Hoffmann’s ironic attitude to life is Kreisler, whose “chronic dualism” is tragic, in contrast to the comical “chronic dualism” of Giglio Fava. The satirical beginning of Hoffmann’s irony in this function has a specific social address, significant social content, and therefore this function of romantic irony allows him, a romantic writer, to reflect some typical phenomena of reality (The Golden Pot, Little Zaches, The Life and Views of the Cat Murr are works that most characteristically reflect this function of Hoffmann’s irony).\n\nHoffmann’s creative individuality in many characteristic features is already determined in his first book Fantasies in the manner of Callot, which included works written from 1808 to 1814. The novella Cavalier Gluck (1808), the first of Hoffmann’s published works, outlines the most essential aspects of his worldview and creative manner. The novel develops one of the main, if not the main idea of ââthe writer’s work – the insolubility of the conflict between the artist and society. This idea is revealed through the artistic device that will dominate in all subsequent work of the writer – the two-dimensional narrative.\n\nThe subtitle of the short story Remembrance of 1809 has a very clear purpose in this regard. He reminds the reader that the image of the famous composer Gluck, the main and, in fact, the only hero of the story, is fantastic, unreal, because Gluck died long before the date indicated in the subtitle, in 1787. And at the same time, this strange and mysterious old man is placed in the setting real Berlin, in the description of which one can catch specific historical signs of the continental blockade: the disputes of the inhabitants about the war, carrot coffee steaming on the tables of the cafe.\n\nFor Hoffmann, all people are divided into two groups: artists in the broadest sense, people who are poetically gifted, and people who are absolutely devoid of poetic perception of the world. “I, as the supreme judge,” says the author’s alter ego Kreisler, “divided the entire human race into two unequal parts: one consists only of good people, but bad or non-musicians at all, while the other consists of true musicians.” The worst representatives of the category of “non-musicians” Hoffmann sees in the philistines.\n\nAnd this opposition of the artist to the philistines is especially widely revealed by the example of the image of the musician and composer Johann Kreisler. The mythical unreal Gluck is replaced by the very real Kreisler, a contemporary of Hoffmann, an artist who, unlike most of the same type of heroes of the early romantics, lives not in a world of poetic dreams, but in a real provincial philistine Germany and wanders from city to city, from one princely court to another, driven by no means a Romantic yearning for the endless, not in search of a blue flower, but in search of the most prosaic daily bread.\n\nAs a Romantic artist, Hoffmann considers music to be the highest, the most romantic kind of art, “since it has only the infinite as its subject; the mysterious proto-language of nature expressed in sounds, filling the human soul with endless longing; only thanks to her ... man comprehends the song of songs of trees, flowers, animals, stones and waters.” Therefore, Hoffmann makes the musician Kreisler his main positive hero.\n\nHoffmann sees the highest embodiment of art in music primarily because music can be least of all connected with life, with real reality. As a true romantic, revising the aesthetics of the Enlightenment, he rejects one of its main provisions – about the civil, social purpose of art: “...art allows a person to feel his higher purpose and from the vulgar vanity of everyday life leads him to the temple of Isis, where nature speaks to him in sublime, never heard, but nevertheless understandable sounds.”\n\nFor Hoffmann, the superiority of the poetic world over the world of real everyday life is beyond doubt. And he sings this world of a fairytale dream, giving it preference over the real, prosaic world.\n\nBut Hoffmann would not have been an artist with such a contradictory and in many respects tragic outlook if this kind of fabulous story determined the general direction of his work, and did not demonstrate only one of its sides. Basically, however, the writer’s artistic perception of the world by no means proclaims the complete victory of the poetic world over the real. Only madmen like Serapion or philistines believe in the existence of only one of these worlds. This principle of a double world is reflected in a number of Hoffmann’s works, perhaps the most striking in their artistic quality and most fully embodying the contradictions of his worldview. First of all, such is the fairy tale The Golden Pot (1814), the title of which is accompanied by the eloquent subtitle A Tale from New Times. The meaning of this subheading isthat the characters in this tale are Hoffmann’s contemporaries, and the action takes place in real Dresden at the beginning of the 19th century. This is how Hoffmann re-interprets the Jena tradition of the fairy tale genre – in its ideological and artistic structure the writer includes the plan of real everyday life. The hero of the novel, student Anselm, is an eccentric loser, endowed with a “naive poetic soul,” and this makes the world of the fabulous and wonderful available to him. Faced with it, Anselm begins to lead a dual existence, getting from his prosaic existence into the kingdom of a fairy tale, adjacent to ordinary real life. In accordance with this, the story is also compositionally built on the interweaving and interpenetration of a fantastic plan with the real one. Romantic fairy tale fantasy in its subtle poetry and grace finds here in Hoffmann one of its best exponents. At the same time, the real plan is clearly outlined in the short story. Not without reason, some researchers of Hoffmann believed that this novel could be used to successfully reconstruct the topography of the streets of Dresden at the beginning of the last century. Realistic detail plays a significant role in characterizing the characters.\n\nA wide and brightly developed fairy tale plan with many bizarre episodes, so unexpectedly and seemingly randomly intruding into the story of real everyday life, is subordinated to the clear, logical ideological and artistic structure of the novel, in contrast to the deliberate fragmentariness and inconsistency in the narrative manner of most early romantics. The duality of the creative method of Hoffmann, the duality in his perception of the world was reflected in the opposition of the real and the fantastic and in the corresponding division of characters into two groups. Conrector Paulman, his daughter Veronica, registrar Geerbrand are prosaic-minded inhabitants of Dresden who, according to the author’s own terminology, can be classified as good people, devoid of any poetic flair. They are opposed by the archivist Lindhorst with his daughter Serpentine, who came to this philistine world from a fantastic fairy tale, and the dear eccentric Anselm, whose poetic soul opened the fabulous world of the archivist.\n\nIn the happy ending of the novel, which ends with two weddings, she receives a full interpretation of her ideological plan. The registrar Geerbrand becomes the court counselor, to whom Veronica gives her hand without hesitation, having renounced her passion for Anselm. Her dream is coming true, “she lives in a beautiful house on the New Market”, she has “a new-style hat, a new Turkish shawl,” and, having breakfast in an elegant negligee by the window, she gives orders to the servants. Anselm marries Serpentine and, becoming a poet, settles with her in the fabulous Atlantis. At the same time, he receives as a dowry “a pretty estate” and a gold pot, which he saw in the archivist’s house. The golden pot, this kind of ironic transformation of Novalis’ blue flower, retains the original function of this romantic symbol. It can hardly be consideredthat the end of the Anselm-Serpentine storyline is a parallel to the philistine ideal embodied in the union of Veronica and Geerbrand, and the golden pot is a symbol of philistine happiness. After all, Anselm does not abandon his poetic dream, he only finds its fulfillment.\n\nThe philosophical idea of ââthe short story about the embodiment, the kingdom of poetic fiction in the world of art, in the world of poetry, is affirmed in the last paragraph of the novel. Its author, suffering from the thought that he has to leave the fabulous Atlantis and return to the miserable squalor of his attic, hears Lindhorst’s encouraging words: “Haven’t you yourself just been to Atlantis and do not you own there at least a decent manor as a poetic property? your mind Isn’t the bliss of Anselm nothing more than life in poetry, which reveals the sacred harmony of all things as the deepest of the secrets of nature!”\n\nNot always, however, Hoffmann’s fiction has such a bright and joyful flavor as in the novel under review or in the fairy tales The Nutcracker and the Mouse King (1816), Alien Child (1817), Lord of the Fleas (1820), Princess Brambilla (1821). The writer created works that are very different in their attitude to the world and in the artistic means used in them. Gloomy nightmarish fantasy, reflecting one of the sides of the writer’s worldview, dominates in the novel Elixir of the Devil (1815-1816) and in Night Tales. Most of the Night Tales, such as The Sandman, Mayorat, Mademoiselle de Scuderi, which, unlike the novel Elixir of the Devil, are not burdened with religious and moral problems, compare with it in artistic relation, perhaps, primarily becausethat they do not have such a deliberate whipping up of a complex plot intrigue.\n\nThe collection of short stories The Serapion Brothers, four volumes of which appeared in print in 1819-1821, contains works of unequal artistic level. There are purely entertaining, plot stories (Signor Formica, The Interdependence of Events, Visions, Doge and Dogaress, etc.), banal edifying (The Player’s Happiness). Nevertheless, the value of this collection is determined by such stories as The Royal Bride, The Nutcracker, Artus’ Hall, Falun Mines, Mademoiselle de Scuderi, which testified to the progressive development of the writer’s talent and contained in itself, with high perfection of artistic forms significant philosophical ideas.\n\nThe name of the hermit Serapion, a Catholic saint, calls itself a small circle of interlocutors who periodically organize literary evenings, where they read their stories to each other, from which the collection is compiled. Sharing subjective positions on the issue of the relationship between the artist and reality, Hoffmann, however, through the lips of one of the members of the Serapion Brotherhood, declares the absolute denial of reality to be illegal, arguing that our earthly existence is determined by both the inner and the outer world. Far from rejecting the need for the artist to turn to what he himself saw in reality, the author resolutely insists that the fictional world be depicted as clearly and clearly as if it appeared before the artist’s eyes as the real world. This principle of the likelihood of the imaginary and the fantastic is consistently implemented by Hoffmann in those stories of the collection, the plots of which are drawn by the author not from his own observations, but from the works of painting.\n\n“Serapion’s principle” is also interpreted in the sense that the artist must isolate himself from the social life of our time and serve only art. The latter, in turn, is a self-sufficient world, rising above life, standing aloof from political struggle. With the undoubted fruitfulness of this aesthetic thesis for many of Hoffmann’s works, one cannot but emphasize that his work itself, in certain of its strengths, did not always fully correspond to these aesthetic principles, as evidenced by a number of his works of the last years of his life, in particular the fairy tale “Little Zaches, nicknamed Zinnober” (1819), noted by the attention of Karl Marx. By the end of the 1810s, new significant tendencies were outlined in the writer’s work, expressed in the strengthening of social satire in his works, an appeal to the phenomena of modern social and political life (Little Zaches. The Life and Views of the Cat Murr), from which he continues in principle fenced off in their aesthetic declarations, as we saw in the example of the Serapion brothers. At the same time, one can state more definite exits of the writer in his creative method to realism (Master Martin the Bochard and his apprentices, 1817; Master Johannes Wacht, 1822; Corner Window, 1822). At the same time, it would hardly be correct to raise the question of a new period in the work of Hoffmann, for simultaneously with social satirical works in accordance with his previous aesthetic positions, he writes a number of short stories and fairy tales that are far from social trends (Princess Brambilla, 1821; Marquise de La Pivardier, 1822; Errors, 1822). If we talk about the writer’s creative method, it should be noted that, despite the significant gravitation in the above-mentioned works towards a realistic manner, Hoffmann continues to create in a characteristically romantic way in the last years of his work (Little Zaches, Princess Brambilla, Royal bride from the Serapion cycle; the romantic plan clearly prevails in the novel about Cat Murr).\n\nVissarion Belinsky highly appreciated Hoffmann’s satirical talent, noting that he was able to “portray reality in all its truth and to castigate the philistinism ... of his compatriots with poisonous sarcasm.”\n\nThese observations of the remarkable Russian critic can be fully attributed to the fairy tale Little Zaches. In the new fairy tale, Hoffmann’s double world is fully preserved in the perception of reality, which is again reflected in the two-dimensional composition of the novel, in the characters of the characters and in their arrangement. Many of the main characters in the tale-novella Little Zaches have their literary prototypes in the short story The Golden Pot: student Baltazar – Anselm, Prosper Alpanus – Lindhorst, Candida – Veronica.\n\nThe two-dimensional nature of the novel is revealed in the opposition of the world of poetic dreams, the fabulous country of Jinnistan, the world of real everyday life, that principality of Prince Barsanuf, in which the novel takes place. Some characters and things lead a dual existence here, since they combine their fabulous magical existence with existence in the real world. Fairy Rosabelverde, she is the canoness of the shelter for noble maidens Rosenschen, patronizes the disgusting little Zaches, rewarding him with three magical golden hairs.\n\nIn the same dual capacity as the fairy Rosabelverde, she is the Canoness Rosenschen, the good wizard Alpanus also appears, surrounding himself with various fabulous wonders, which the poet and dreamer student Baltazar sees well. In his everyday incarnation, only accessible to philistines and sober rationalists, Alpanus is just a doctor, inclined, however, to very intricate quirks.\n\nThe artistic plans of the novels being compared are compatible, if not completely, then very closely. In their ideological sound, for all their similarity, the novellas are quite different. If in the fairy tale The Golden Pot, which ridicules the worldview of philistinism, satire has a moral and ethical character, then in Little Zaches it becomes sharper and gets a social sound. It is no coincidence that Belinsky noted that this short story was banned by the tsarist censorship for the reason that it contained “a lot of mockery of the stars and officials.”\n\nIt is in connection with the expansion of the address of satire, with its strengthening in the novel, that one significant moment in its artistic structure changes – the main character becomes not a positive hero, a characteristic Hoffmannian eccentric, a poet-dreamer (Anselm in the short story The Golden Pot), but a negative hero, the disgusting freak Zaches, a character who, in a deeply symbolic combination of his external features and internal content, first appears on the pages of Hoffmann’s works. Little Zaches is even more a “fairy tale from new times” than The Golden Pot. Zaches is a complete insignificance, devoid of even the gift of intelligible articulate speech, but with excessively inflated arrogant pride, disgustingly ugly outwardly – due to the magical gift of the fairy Rosabelverde looks in the eyes of those around him not only a stately handsome man, but also a person endowed with outstanding talents, bright and clear mind. In a short time, he makes a brilliant administrative career: without completing a law course at the university, he becomes an important official and, finally, the all-powerful first minister in the principality. Such a career is possible only due to the fact that Zaches appropriates other people’s works and talents: the mysterious power of three golden hairs makes blinded people attribute to him everything significant and talented done by others.\n\nSo within the limits of the Romantic worldview and the artistic means of the Romantic method, one of the great evils of the modern social system is depicted. However, the unfair distribution of spiritual and material wealth seemed fatal to the writer, arising under the influence of irrational fantastic forces in this society, where power and wealth are endowed with insignificant people, and their insignificance, in turn, with the power of power and gold turns into an imaginary brilliance of mind and talents. The debunking and overthrowing of these false idols in accordance with the nature of the writer’s worldview comes from outside, thanks to the intervention of the same irrational fairy-magical forces (the sorcerer Prosper Alpanus, in his confrontation with the fairy Rosabelverde, patronizing Balthazar), which, according to Hoffmann, gave rise to the social phenomenon. The scene of the indignation of the crowd bursting into the house of the all-powerful minister Zinnober after he lost his magical charm, of course, should not be perceived as an attempt by the author to seek a radical means of eliminating the social evil that is symbolized in the fantastic and fairy-tale image of the freak Zaches. This is just one of the minor details of the plot, by no means having a programmatic character. The people are not rebelling against an evil temporary minister, but only mocking the disgusting monster, whose appearance finally appeared before them in its original form. The death of Zaches, who, fleeing from the raging crowd, is drowning in a silver chamber pot, is grotesque within the framework of the fairy tale plan of the novel, and not socially symbolic.\n\nHoffmann’s positive program is completely different, traditional for him is the triumph of the poetic world of Balthazar and Prosper Alpanus not only over evil in the person of Zaches, but in general over the ordinary, prosaic world. Like the fairy tale The Golden Pot, Little Zaches ends with a happy ending: a combination of a loving couple, Balthazar and Candida. But now this plot finale and the embodiment of Hoffmann’s positive program in it reflect the deepening contradictions of the writer, his growing conviction in the illusory nature of the aesthetic ideal that he opposes to reality. In this regard, the ironic intonation is strengthened and deepened in the story.\n\nA great social generalization in the image of Zaches, an insignificant temporary leader who rules the whole country, a venomous irreverent mockery of crowned and high-ranking persons, “mockery of the stars and ranks”, of the narrowness of the German philistine, are added in this fantastic tale into a vivid satirical picture of the phenomena of the socio-political structure of the modern Germany.\n\nIf the short story Little Zaches has already been marked by a clear shift in emphasis from the world of the fantastic to the world of the real, then to an even greater extent this tendency manifested itself in the novel The Life and Views of the Cat Murr, coupled with fragments of the biography of Kapellmeister Johannes Kreisler, which accidentally survived in junk sheets (1819-1821). Illness and death prevented Hoffmann from writing the last, third volume of this novel. But even in its unfinished form, it is one of the most significant works of the writer, representing in the most perfect artistic embodiment almost all the main motives of his work and artistic manner.\n\nThe dualism of Hoffmann’s worldview remains and even deepens in the novel. But it is expressed not through the opposition"
