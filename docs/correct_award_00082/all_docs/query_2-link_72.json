        "text": "Heyse, Paul Johann Ludwig von (b. March 15, 1830, Berlin [Germany]--d. April 2, 1914, Munich)\n\nGerman writer and prominent member of the traditionalist Munich school who received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1910.\n\nAfter completing his studies Heyse became an independent scholar and was called to Munich by Maximilian II of Bavaria. There, with the poet Emanuel von Geibel, he became the head of the Munich circle of writers, who sought to preserve traditional artistic values from the encroachments of political radicalism, materialism, and realism. Chief among his carefully wrought short stories is L'Arrabiata (1855). He also published novels (including Kinder der Welt, 1873; Children of the World) and many unsuccessful plays. Among his best works are his translations of Giacomo Leopardi and other Italian poets. In 1871 he formulated a definition of the novella form, the \"Falkentheorie\" (\"falcon theory,\" from Giovanni Boccaccio's model novella, Tale of a Falcon). Heyse, who was given to idealization and who refused to portray the dark side of life, became an embittered opponent of the growing school of naturalism, and his popularity had greatly decreased by the time he received the Nobel Prize."
