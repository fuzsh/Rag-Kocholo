After studying poetry at Berlin University, he moved to Bonn University to study Romance philology. In 1852, he received a doctorate for his dissertation on Provençal poetry. Later that year, he received a grant from the Prussian Ministry of Culture that allowed him to continue his studies in Rome and in various Italian libraries. Heyse later settled in Munich.\n\nWork\n\nPaul Heyse wrote short stories, poetry, novels, and plays and translated Italian poetry. He was a member of two literary societies – Tunnel über der Spree and Die Krokodile. Heyse was perhaps most successful as a writer of short stories. One of his most well-known novellas is L’Arrabiata (1852). Heyse’s writings emphasize freedom and individuality."
