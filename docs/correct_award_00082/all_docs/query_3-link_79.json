        "text": "Excellent guests\n\n‘Outside was the moon, up above in the sky, and the long garden beside the lake resembled silver, with its noble plants, palms, magnolias, agaves and the scent of roses’. These words of the German Poet Paul Heyse – 1910 Nobel Prize for Literature – describe the rapture of one of his stays at the Grand Hotel, where he was often a guest in the decade 1899-1909, and where he set his novella ‘A Venetian Night’, from the volume ‘Novellas from Lake Garda’ (1902). But the list of excellent guests that have stayed at the Grand Hotel is nearly endless: from Sir Winston Churchill to Gabriele “The Poet” D’Annunzio; from King George of Saxony to the novelists William Somerset Maugham and Vladimir Nabokov; down to the great stars of music, theatre and dance, who in the last years have performed at the summer festival hosted by the Vittoriale at Gardone Riviera, and who have chosen the Grand Hotel as a place to stay on the Garda.

Karl Koeniger. The Grand housed in winter season a large number of people of culture, industry and the nobility, including, in the spring of 1903, the retinue of King George of Saxony.

He was also a poet and the landscape of Gardone inspired some poems published in a book printed by Mondadori in 1973. One of the poem is dedicated to the great camphor of the promonade along the lake: \"Green Eyes has the Night. / Venus ingemmest sunrise-white rose on the back of the fairing Baldo. / To the west the moon still keeps the twilight. / Strange images become foggy with vapors of day.\"\n\nBack to list\n\nRead more\n\nBENITO MUSSOLINI\n\nBenito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini (1883-1945), was the founder of fascism, head of the Government of the Italian Kingdom from January 1925.

He was an important figure of the world literature thanks to the success of Lolita, published in 1955 by the Olympia Press in Paris. Many journalists interviewed him in the garden of the hotel and found a quiet old man, tall, stribg, dressed like a colonial English man much more than a Russian-American. He was confident in front of the camera, next to his wife. They asked the reason for the holiday on the lake \"On these hills there are rare butterflies\" he said. \"Perhaps in the United States lolitas were called \"butterflies\"? Someone cracked a smile. Nabokov was also an entomologist (and what fame!), as well as a literary critic and a so different writer from the one who wrote his most famous novel.\n\nBack to list\n\nRead more\n\nALBERT SABIN\n\nAlbert Sabin (1906-1993), physician and virologist.

He had an adventurous life and he normally spent the last period of his life at the Grand Hotel Gardone before reaching Venice, where he used to stay at the Gritti.

It is situated in a wonderful environment, characterized by a particular climate that makes a stay very pleasant in all seasons, but above all in late autumn and spring, when the Monte Baldo and its snow make the landscape more beautiful in a contrast of colors. A sort of amphitheater hillside rich in Mediterranean vegetation is situated behind the hotel, while the lake opens in front of it so as the Garda Island, the rock in Manerba and the peninsula of Sirmione, \"flower of islands and peninsulas\", where two thousand years ago seemed to Catullus to hear the joyous laughter of the waves of Lake Garda.\n\nBack to list\n\nRead more"
