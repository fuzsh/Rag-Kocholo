        "text": "The library holds one of the most extensive collections of modern papers in German-speaking countries. Since the 16th century the collection has been steadily enhanced to comprise a wide range of subjects. Regionally it focuses mainly, but not exclusively, on the political and cultural history of Munich and Bavaria in its diverse aspects. With regard to content, the collection has a universal orientation.\n\nModern papers A – Z (overview)\n\nModern papers according to professions (PDF, 250 KB)\n\nSince the heydays of humanism, the collection has become decidedly European in the scope of subjects, partly also with regard to the persons and languages represented. From the early 19th century onwards, non-European cultures have come to be represented in the papers of eminent explorers and scholars.\n\nDating back to the origins of the library founded by Duke Albrecht V of Bavaria in 1558, the collection now comprises approximately 1,100 entities. Over the centuries, it has continuously grown by acquisitions and donations.\n\nIn 1558 the first modern papers were acquired together with the private library of the Orientalist scholar Johann Albrecht Widmanstetter. The papers of the humanists and medical doctors Hermann and Hartmann Schedel followed next, being included in the private library of Johann Jakob Fugger, which was bought in 1571. The papers of the cartographer Philipp Apian were added to the collection in 1589.\n\nApproximately 200 collections date from the 15th to the 18th centuries. In the wake of the dissolution of the monasteries, valuable new sources were added in the first decades of the 19th century, such as the papers of Prosper Goldhover and Bonifazius Sadler relating to the history of astronomy. When the Mannheim Court Library was transferred to Munich, the papers of the Camerarius family of humanist scholars became part of the collection, including substantial sources on the history of medicine in the 16th and 17th centuries.\n\nAs the collection became more and more well known, its growth accelerated in the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Dynasties of renowned scholars and artists in Munich and Bavaria traditionally gave their papers to the library, sometimes over several generations. Until recently important additions have been provided by their descendants. For additional information on papers of persons born or mainly active in Bavaria also refer to Bavarica.\n\nPapers of persons born or mainly active in Bavaria\n\nIn certain fields such as the classics, scholarly papers have been acquired from all over Germany. Amounting to about 50 provenances, the subject is one of the preeminent special subjects represented in the collection. A selection of pertinent papers can also be searched under antiquity.\n\nAntiquity – Personal papers\n\nThe collection also includes personal papers from approximately 150 writers, in the 19th century notably the so-called \"Münchner Dichterkreis\", a group of writers gathering around Paul Heyse who in 1910 was awarded the Nobel Prize of Literature. His private personal papers belong to the most voluminous individual collections in this field. The papers of writers and poets are also recorded in the Literaturportal Bayern (Literature Portal Bavaria), augmented by a concise description and further links.\n\nLiteraturportal Bayern\n\nAbout one eighth of the collection pertains to the fields of the sciences, mathematics, medicine and architecture.\n\nPapers containing modern architectural drawings and related written sources have been digitized for the database ArchIcon and complemented by short descriptions.\n\nArchIcon\n\nRulers and politicians of Bavaria are continuously represented.\n\nThe Bayerische Staatsbibliothek also owns an extensive collection of papers relating to music by composers, conductors, musicians, musicologists, music teachers or professors as well as music institutions in a wider sense. Traditionally, sources without written music have been kept in the Department of Manuscripts and Rare Books, whereas manuscript music, printed music and sound carriers as parts of personal papers have been integrated into the collections held in the Department of Music.\n\nPapers relating to music\n\nApart from provenances split between the two collections, sources may also be found only in either of them. For a comprehensive overview of the collections please refer to the list of personal papers and collections pertaining to individual persons in the Department of Music.\n\nList of personal papers and collections pertaining to individual persons in the Department of Music (PDF, 323 KB)\n\nPlease address specific requests to the pertinent department.\n\nPapers are mainly attributed to individual persons. Archives of societies and foundations are also represented.\n\nPapers generally include handwritten or typewritten sources such as letters, speeches, lectures, random collections relating to a specific subject, preliminary stages or variants of published works, frequently also pictorial materials. Personal papers may additionally include biographical sources like school or university certificates, rewards or documents, often also photographs.\n\nPhotographs are recorded in the respective inventories. Additionally, they are in process of being digitized in collaboration with the Department of Maps and Images to be included in the Bildarchiv (Image Archive), where they can be searched, selected and ordered online.\n\nUsing the collection of the Bildarchiv\n\nIn some cases, a selection of private books may be part of the unit. A great number of these books have been included in BSB DISCOVER! and may be searched by the keywords \"BSB-Provenienz Nachlass …\" (is currently not working). As far as they have been transferred to the library’s general collection, they may be ordered online.\n\nBSB DISCOVER!\n\nModern papers proper\n\nIn 1829 modern papers was introduced as a separate administrative unit by Johann Andreas Schmeller. Until then corresponding sources had been treated as manuscripts and registered according to the established scheme – with reference to the language of the documents for instance as Codices latini, germanici or gallici; if predominantly illustrated, sometimes also as Cod.icon. Consequently, they can be searched in the printed manuscript catalogues, as well as in the printed catalogue by Karl Dachs.\n\nList of the printed manuscript catalogues\n\nDachs, Karl: Die schriftlichen Nachlässe in der Bayerischen Staatsbibliothek München\n\nFrom 1829 personal papers have been kept under shelfmarks adapted from the family names of the respective persons. The first array of papers Schmeller catalogued under \"Doceniana\" were those of his predecessor in the library and fellow scholar of German studies, Joseph Bernhard Docen. Notwithstanding, certain types of material, such as manuscripts of literary or academic works, for a transitory period kept on being assigned to the established shelfmarks for all manuscripts.\n\nAs a result of the continuously increasing number and size of personal papers, it was decided to switch to a numerical sequence beginning with \"Ana 301\", identifying personal papers only by the former ending \"Ana\".\n\nAs far as complying with legal requirements, PDF registers to personal papers are provided in BSB DISCOVER! and can be consulted online.\n\nBSB DISCOVER!\n\nFragmentary collections\n\nHaving been established in 1982 as Fasciculi germanici (Fasc.germ.), fragmentary collections constitute a compromise, mainly defined by its size in between the main collection of modern papers and the autograph collection. The parts of fragmentary collections are usually constituted by a limited group of letters or documents. They are grouped in numerical sequence and have been extensively catalogued.\n\nRecords of the catalogued units of fragmentary collections (PDF, 0.9 MB)\n\nList of the uncatalogued units of fragmentary collections (PDF, 119 KB)\n\nThe letters held in fragmentary collections (and mentioned in the records of the catalogued parts) can also be searched in the database Kalliope.\n\nKalliope"
