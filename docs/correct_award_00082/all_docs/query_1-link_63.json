APPLETON AND COMPANY NEW YORK :: MCMXXVII :: LONDON Copyright, 1925, by D. APPLETON AND' COMPANY Tnit/. PRINTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO PAUL AND ANNA PREFACE These studies of Nobel Prize Winners in Literature have been the result of research for several years and lectures upon the subject in University Extension courses, before college clubs and other groups. The vast scope of the subject suggests temerity in one who attempts to treat it in such limited space. The writer realizes the inadequacy of the book and possible con¬ flicting statements because of diverse authorities that have been consulted. After careful “siftings,” it is offered as an incentive to further study, as a roadmap to many paths of literary research. Biographical data and brief criticism of the authors’ works are followed by a bibliography which is suggestive rather than ex¬ haustive. The writer of these chapters has been, in large measure, the recorder of research by many individuals and educational institutions, with personal deductions from wide reading. Among many books that have been stimulating are Creative Spirits of the Nineteenth Century by Georg Brandes, Studies from Ten Litera¬ tures by Ernest Boyd, books upon the drama and trans¬ lations by John Garrett Underhill, Ludwig Lewisohn vii Vlll PREFACE and Barrett H. Clark, and studies of Knut Hamsun by Josef Wiehr and Hanna Arstrup Larsen. Other specific books of interpretation are emphasized in text and footnotes, as well as in bibliography. Gratitude that defies fitting words would be here ex¬ pressed to Miss Anna C. Reque of the Bureau of In¬ formation of the American-Scandinavian Foundation, to the Svenska Akademien Nobelinstitut of Stockholm, to Mrs. Velma Swanston Howard, Miss Svea Boson and Thekla E.

The grandfather, Imanuel, an army surgeon, is accredited with changing the fam¬ ily name to Nobel. His son, Emanuel, father of Al¬ fred, taught science in Stockholm, as a young man. With inventive ability he experimented with explosives, submarine mines, and other destructive forces and, by paradox, became designer of surgical appliances and India-rubber cushions to relieve suffering. He was interested in ship construction and spent some time in Egypt. To his sons he transmitted his spirit of scientific research, with all the dangers as well as the inspiration of such ambition. Two explosions, during experiments with nitroglycerine and other chemicals, 2 THE NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS caused severe loss. The first, occurring about 1837 in Stockholm, shattered the nerves of the people as well as their windows, so that Emanuel went to Russia, on the advice of friends prominent in affairs of industry and government. Here he was employed by the Rus¬ sians to continue his experiments with submarine mines; with his family, he remained here until after the Crimean War, contributing to naval warfare by his inventions. An older son, Ludwig, remained in Russia when his family returned to Sweden. This son gained repute as an engineer and discovered the petroleum springs at Baku.1 A second explosion in one of the factories of Sweden, in 1864, caused the death of a younger son of Emanuel Nobel and shocked the father so severely that he was an invalid physically for the rest of his life. Alfred Bernhard Nobel was born at Stockholm in 1833. He was less robust than his brothers; he was sensitive and nervous, suffering from headaches all his life. His mother, Karoline Henriette Ahlssell, was his devoted comrade from the early days when he would lie on the couch while she read to him or told him sagas and hero-stories. She was wise and happy by nature, confident that Alfred would become “a great man,” in spite of poor physique and moods of depres¬ sion. He never married, although he loved a young 1 Westminster Review, 156, 642. ALFRED NOBEL 3 girl who died in her youth, but he was devoted to his mother to the end of her life. Letters and frequent visits to her in Sweden, in his later life, kept alive his affectionate nature and his idealism. Like his father he showed studious interest in chemistry, physics, and mechanical engineering. Ship¬ building attracted his attention for a time and, when he was about seventeen, he was sent to the United States to increase his knowledge of mechanics, as ap¬ plied to ships, by association with John Ericsson. At the home of the latter on Franklin Street, New York, where a tablet has been placed to commemorate the services of this inventor in the Civil War, young Nobel lived for a time. His father sent him to John Ericsson in order to investigate an invention of his, an engine which was supposed to work by heat from the sun. He stayed several months, probably not more than a year. Ericsson was passing through a period of fluctuating fortunes. At the end of 1849 his balance was only $132.32 — his total receipts for the year had been but $2,000. Two years later he re¬ corded a balance of $8,690.10. In the interval he had sold several patents and had received congratula¬ tions from the King of Sweden upon the great future for his “test caloric engine.” This was the goal of his experiments during these years; its success was to be tested in the trial trip of The Ericsson, February 1 1, 4 THE NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS 1853. A squall came up as the boat was launched and making headway, and it sank, carrying with it hopes of the inventor after years of experiment, and half a million dollars of invested capital. Ericsson was crushed for a few weeks. How pluckily he recov¬ ered his courage, made his plans for The Monitor , offered that to the United States government and won success for the cause of the North, is familiar history. 2 Upon Alfred Nobel, with his quick, impressionable temperament, this direct contact with Ericsson must have left strong influences. Perhaps he decided then that, should fortune favor him, he would leave a fund to aid scientists in their experiments and to protect them against financial duress during periods of dis¬ couragement. When he returned to Sweden and Russia, he cooperated with his father and brothers in manufacturing nitroglycerine and other explosives; he was constantly seeking for a compound which would be more powerful and less dangerous. In 1857, at St. Petersburg, he had taken out a patent for a gasometer. It has been said that the discovery of what was later known as dynamite came by accident to Alfred Nobel, during an experiment about 1865-66. Some nitro¬ glycerine had escaped into the siliceous sand of the 2 The Life of John Ericsson by William Conant Church, z Vols., New York, 1901. ALFRED NOBEL 5 packing and this brought about a partial solution of his problem. Dynamite, which was composed of 75 per cent nitroglycerine and 25 per cent kieselguhr, or infusorial earth, was produced. He applied for patents in several countries, and sought for funds to start fac¬ tories which he believed would make a fortune by manufacture of this new explosive. It was sometimes called “Nobel’s blasting-oil.” He told French bankers that he had invented “an oil that would blow up the world”; a facetious commentator declared, “French bankers thought it for their interest to leave the globe undisturbed” and refused him credit. 3 Napoleon III became interested and arranged for funds for Nobel’s factories in France. With some samples of dynamite in his hand bag, Alfred Nobel came to the United States on the same commercial mission. New York hotels received him with sus¬ picion because of rumors about the “deadly explosive”; he went to California where, through the aid of Dr. Bandman, a friend of Nobel’s brother, a factory was started near Los Angeles. In a few years manu¬ factories were in operation in Italy, Spain, France and Scotland, as well as England and Sweden. When Al¬ fred Nobel was forty years old he was making his fortune out of this “giant powder.” For several years he lived in Paris where he had laboratories for 3 Vance Thompson, in Cosmopolitan, September, 1906. 6 THE NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS further experiments with gelatin, balastite, and forms of smokeless powder. In his later home, in San Remo, he carried on developments and took out more patents in petroleum and artificial gutta-percha. He received the tribute of scientists and educators but the ignorant people regarded him with a mixture of awe and fear — “he had put the long hammer of Thor to work again among the giants.” In spite of his inspiring life-work and many suc¬ cesses, in spite of his wealth and honors, Alfred Nobel was a lonely man. His health was unstable ; he often worked with bandaged head and in intense pain, ac¬ centuated by the gaseous fumes of his laboratory. He was self-distrustful and fearful that people were attracted to him only by his wealth. One of the few individuals who gained and kept his confidence was Baroness Bertha von Suttner. In her Memoirs the personality of Alfred Nobel is revealed in com¬ ments and letters. She came to him in response to an advertisement in a Paris newspaper, asking for a secre¬ tary for “a very wealthy, cultured gentleman.” She remained only a few days in her joint capacity of secretary and housekeeper, for a happy solution of her interrupted romance with the Baron von Suttner eventuated in her speedy marriage. She exchanged letters and visits with Alfred Nobel for many years and was devoted to him in life and in memory. She ALFRED NOBEL 7 describes him as somewhat below average height, without physical attractiveness but in no sense “re¬ pulsive,” as he imagined himself to be. He was a fine linguist, somewhat of a philosopher, a good con¬ versationalist and entertaining as a story-teller. He allowed her to read a long philosophical poem which he had written in English and she found it “simply splendid.” He was critical of the shallow, false¬ hearted people, especially those who importuned him with low motives; but he had faith in a better develop¬ ment of humanity as education progressed. One of his few intellectual companions in Paris was Madame Juliette Ad'ams, author and editor of the Nouvelle Revue; at her salon in Rue Juliet, Nobel would meet, occasionally, men of science and let¬ ters. In the Memoirs of Baroness von Suttner may be located the first intimations of Nobel’s motives which led to the Nobel prizes, especially the specific form which was known as “the Peace Prize.” It will be recalled that the Baroness von Suttner was one of the early winners of this prize by her widely-read ro¬ mance, Die Waflen nieder ( Lay Down Your Arms!). In 1890, after the publication of this story, advocat¬ ing world peace, Nobel wrote letters of high com¬ mendation. On another occasion he said to her, “I wish I could produce a substance or a machine of such 8 THE NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS frightful efficacy for wholesale devastation that wars should thereby become altogether impossible.” 4 He contended, with the mind of a prophet, that a day might come when “two army corps may mutually annihilate each other in a second”; then he believed that “all civilized nations will recoil and disband their troops.” On January 7, 1893, three years before his death, he wrote to the Baroness from Paris.5 “I should like to dispose of a part of my fortune by founding a prize to be granted every five years — say six times, for if in thirty years they have not succeeded in reforming the present system they will infallibly relapse into barbarism. ... If the Triple Alliance, instead of comprising only three states, should enlist all states, the peace of the centuries would be assured.” Affirm¬ ing his belief in “reasonable Socialism,” he deplored the custom of leaving large fortunes to heirs; too often the results were lapses in mental ambitions and in¬ dustry. On December 10, 1896, Alfred Nobel died suddenly in his workshop at San Remo. For a long time he had realized his condition of reduced vitality. He consulted doctors unwillingly and heeded their counsel with reluctance. He kept a record of his own pulse 4 Memoirs of Bertha von Suttner; Records of an Eventful Life, Vol. I, p. 210, New York, 1910. By permission of Ginn & Co. 5 Ibid., Vol. I, p. 438. ALFRED NOBEL 9 and heart action but he never desisted from a full day’s work in his laboratory. His last letters have a sad note that is sometimes sarcastic yet he kept faith in and with humanity to the last. He had been care¬ fully considering the disposal of his fortune, deter¬ mined that it should contribute to progress in science and literature, for the welfare of mankind and the education towards world peace. His will startled the civilized world by its originality and idealism. The man who had been most successful in inventing ele¬ ments of destruction, by a paradox, had left most of his large fortune to constructive, creative purposes. Because he distrusted many lawyers he had been his own legal adviser in large measure; sometimes he had acted as his own secretary, lest an outsider might abuse his confidence. In appointing M. Ragnar Sohlmann as executor, he explained that here “was a man who had never asked anything of me.” (Later the manager of the factory at Bergen became associate executor.) He left legacies of five thousand pounds each to his nephews but some efforts to “break the will” were threatened. Emanuel, then head of the family, refused to sanction such interference and, after many complications and delays, the will was allowed, and varied equivocal, or impractical, conditions were interpreted by “Code of Statutes,” issued by the King of Sweden, June 29, 1900. IO THE NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS From this pamphlet is quoted here the extract from the will: 6 “Extract from the Will and Testament of Dr. Alfred Bernhard Nobel, Engineer, which was drawn on the 27th day of November, 1895: ‘With the residue of my convertible estate I hereby direct my executors to proceed as follows: They shall convert my said residue of property into money, which they shall then invest in safe securities; the capital thus secured shall constitute a fund, the interest accruing from which shall be annually awarded in prizes to those persons who shall have contributed most mate¬ rially to benefit mankind during the year immediately preceding. The said interest shall be divided into five equal amounts, to be apportioned as follows: one share to the person who shall have made the most important discovery or invention in the domain of Physics; one share to the person who shall have made the most important chemical discovery or improve¬ ment; one share to the person who shall have made the most important discovery in the domain of Physi¬ ology or Medicine; one share to the person who shall have produced in the field of Literature the most distinguished work of an idealistic tendency; and finally, one share to the person who shall have most 6 Nobel Stiftelson, The Nobel Foundation, Code of Statutes given at the Royal Palace in Stockholm on June 29, 1900 (Stockholm, 1901). Objects of the Foundation. From copy in Library of Congress. ALFRED NOBEL 1 1 or best promoted the Fraternity of Nations and the Abolishment or Diminution of Standing Armies and the Formation and Increase of Peace Congresses.’ ” In further details the will provides: “The prizes for Physics and Chemistry shall be awarded by the Swedish Academy of Science in Stockholm; the one for Physiology or Medicine by the Caroline Medical Institute in Stockholm; the one for Literature by the Academy in Stockholm ( i.e . Svenska Akademien) and that for Peace by a Committee of five persons to be elected by the Norwegian Storthing. I declare it to be my express desire that in the awarding of prizes, no consideration whatever be paid to the nationality of the candidates, that is to say, that the most deserving be awarded the prize, whether of Scandinavian origin or not.” Because of difficulties in interpreting certain sections and elucidating other phrases, this Code of Statutes was drawn up “in consultation with a representative, nominated by Robert Nobel’s family, and submitted to consideration of the King.” After adjustments of in¬ terests had been “amicably entered into” by the tes¬ tator’s heirs, June 5, 1898, it was decreed that “The instructions of the will above as set forth shall serve as a criterion for the administration of the Founda¬ tion (Nobel) in conjunction with the elucidations and further stipulations contained in this Code.” One 12 THE NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS “stipulation” was that “each of the annual prizes founded by the said will shall be awarded at least once during each ensuing five-year period after the year in which the Nobel Foundation comes into force.” The phrase used by Nobel in the words relating to the prize in Literature, “the Academy at Stockholm,” was interpreted “as understood to be the Swedish Acad¬ emy — Svenska Akademien.” Another significant ex¬ planation was — the “term, ‘Literature,’ used in the will shall be understood to embrace not only works falling under the category of Polite Literature, but also other writings which may claim to possess literary value by reason of their form or their mode of ex¬ position.” This last provision, which seems elastic and somewhat vague, has not led thus far to undue difficulties and criticisms. The phrase “during the preceding year,” as applied to scientific and literary achievements alike, was a strange, impractical provision which was well inter¬ preted broadly in the Code thus: “only such works or inventions shall be eligible as have appeared ‘during the preceding year’ is to be understood, that a work or invention for which a reward under the terms of the will is contemplated, shall set forth the most mod¬ ern results of work being done in that of the depart¬ ments as defined in the will to which it belongs ; works or inventions of older standing to be taken into con- ALFRED NOBEL 13 sideration only in case their importance has not pre¬ viously been demonstrated.” Two other stipulations were made that have been applied to the awards in literature, as elsewhere, “The amount allotted to one prize may be divided equally between two works submitted, should each of such works be deemed to merit a prize.” Thus, in 1904, the prize was divided between Jose Echegaray, the Spanish dramatist, and Frederic Mistral, the poet of Provence; again, in 1917, it was divided between two Danish writers, Gjellerup and Pontoppidan. On the other hand, if all of the “works under examina¬ tion fail to attain to the standard of excellence” re¬ quired, no award need be given that year, the “amount added to the main fund or may be set aside to form a special fund for that of one of the sections to promote the object of the testator.” In 1914 and 1918 there were no awards in literature. To facilitate impartial judgment it was directed that each of the four sections of the Swedish corporation of award “shall appoint a committee — their Nobel Committee — of three or five members to make sug¬ gestions with reference to the award.” To be a mem¬ ber of this Nobel Committee one need not be “a Swedish subject or member of the Corporation.” “How are these candidates for prizes nominated?” is a frequent question. It is stated explicitly in this i4 THE NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS Code of Statutes, section 7: “It is essential that every candidate for a prize under the terms of the will, be proposed as such in writing by some duly qualified person. A direct application for a prize will not be taken into consideration.” Further explanations are given of “qualifications entitling a person to propose another for the receipt of a prize” — he must be “a representative, whether Swedish or otherwise, of the domain of Science, Literature, etc. in question and the grounds for the award must be stated in writing.” In this same Code of Statutes, in a later section (p. 23) there is expanded information regarding “The right to nominate a candidate for the prize-competition” — this shall “belong to Members of the Swedish Acad¬ emy and the Academies in France and Spain which are similar to it in constitution and purpose; members also of the humanistic classes of other Academies and of those humanistic institutions and societies that are on the same footing as academies, and teachers of aesthetics, literature and history at universities and colleges.” For publicity it was provided that these “regulations shall be publicly announced at least every five years in some official or widely circulated journals in each of the three Scandinavian countries and in the chief countries of the civilized world.” The names of candidates must be presented by February first of each year. 1 ALFRED NOBEL 15 Although the successful candidates for the various prizes are usually “broadcasted,” in these days of shrewd journalism, sometime in November, the official announcements of the awards are made on “Founder’s Day,” the tenth of December, the anniversary of the death of the testator. “At this time the adjudicators shall make known the result of their award and shall hand over to the winners of the prizes a cheque for the amount of the same, together with a diploma and a medal in gold, bearing the testator’s effigy and a suitable legend.” The last word may be more freely translated, inscription. In further explanation the Code of Statutes decrees : “It shall be incumbent on a prize winner, whenever feasible, to give a lecture on the subject treated of in the work to which the prize has been awarded, such lecture to take place within six months of the Founder’s Day at which the prize was won, and to be given at Stockholm or, in the case of the Peace prize, at Christiania.” This feature of the award has not often been “feasible” in literature, although a few of the winners have received the prizes in person at Stockholm and made fitting responses, as we shall note in later chapters. The decree is final:7 “Against the decision of the adjudicators in making their award no protest can be lodged. If differences of opinion have occurred they shall not appear in the 7 Ibid., section io. 1 6 THE NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS minutes of the proceedings, nor in any other way be made public.” To assist in their investigations and to further the “aims of the Foundation, the adjudicators shall possess powers to establish scientific institutes and other organizations. The institutes so established and belonging to the Foundation, shall be known under the name of Nobel Institutes.” While the general administration of the funds and awards rests with the Nobel Foundation, consisting of five persons (“one of whom, the President, shall be appointed by the King and the others by the delegates of the adjudicating corporations”) the specific work of investigation and judgment rests with the organiza¬ tion cited in the will. In literature, the “prizes are assigned” by the Swedish Academy, after careful in¬ vestigation by its members, and the assistance of the Nobel Institute and Librarian. A large collection of books, mostly of modern writings, forms the Library. In all languages, translations, when necessary, are found here, also reports concerning works of recent publication. The Swedish Academy was founded by King Gustavus III in 1786. It has devoted itself to “the arts of elocution and poetry, to the preservation of purity, force and elevation of diction in the Swedish language both in scientific works and products of pure literature. Annual prizes have been offered, for scores of years, in elocution and poetry. Eighteen members, ALFRED NOBEL i7 all Swedes, comprise this Academy, of which the King is patron. He appoints the Inspector of the Nobel Institute of the Swedish Academy but its “immediate management is by a member of the Academy, chosen by that body.” Two conditions of the will of Alfred Nobel have been faithfully followed — the recipients in all branches have done something (if not “most”) “to benefit hu¬ manity”; in the second place, “no consideration what¬ ever has been paid to the nationality of the candidates,” in the way of favoritism. The most reasonable criticism of the awards, especially in literature, has been a failure to carry out what seems to have been the assumed, but not expressed, desire of the donor, namely, to stimulate work as well as to reward past achievements. Otherwise, why that puzzling phrase about “the year preceding”? Not wholly without foundation is the comment that too many of the awards in literature have been “tombstones rather than stepping-stones.” Many of the earlier recipients were past seventy, with productive faculties low, be¬ fore the honor. It is a satisfaction to the public to know that a worthy writer has had world recognition before he dies, and that his last days may have many comforts possible through the financial award of about $40,000 — but such conditions do not seem in accord with the spirit of the Nobel will and the attitude of 1 8 THE NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS the donor toward creative work. The awards have been too often retroactive rather than stimulating to further writing. Other winners, as will be noted later, have accomplished vigorous literature, after the award as well as before the honor. During the years from 1901, when the first prizes were given, to 1925, twelve nationalities have been represented in literature. Germany and France have had the largest percentages in awards: Spain, Italy, Poland, Norway, Sweden have had two winners each. Great Britain (including the awards to Rabindranath Tagore and to Yeats as well as Kipling) has been thrice honored. Denmark divided the prize one year; Switzerland came into the lists with her poet, Carl Spitteler. In science and “promotion of peace,” America has such names on the roster of honor as A. A. Michelson in physics, T. W. Richards in chemistry, Dr. Alexis Carrel in medicine, and Theodore Roose¬ velt, Elihu Root and Woodrow Wilson in the “peace • n prize. What have been the influences of the will of Alfred Nobel and the awards upon international literature? An unquestioned result has been to arouse both curios¬ ity and aspiration among writers and readers. No other prizes, among any peoples, have caused such widespread interest. The announcement of the Nobel prizes each year has become an event of outstanding ALFRED NOBEL i9 significance. Journals enter into competition, in re¬ cent years, to get the first word over the wires and to publish the most informing articles upon the winners. Tense interest precedes and follows the awards. Whatever may be one’s individual opinion about the justice in every instance, the fact remains that the chosen writer becomes the center of study and discus¬ sion for the current season and later years. To some critics this method of appreciation is offensive; some¬ times it may seem to be a sensational “thrust into the limelight” of an insignificant or mediocre writer. In the majority of cases, the result is like that of a strong telescope which can distinguish the “fixed stars from the meteors” in the literary horizon. The second influence is upon writers of every na¬ tionality — an incentive to produce “a distinguished work of an idealistic tendency,” some book which will prove of “benefit to humanity.” This term, ideal¬ istic, is difficult to render in all languages. In the French explanation of the will, it is explicit, “le plus remarquable dans le sens de l’idealisme.” It is not easy to justify the prizes in literature, in several cases, if one emphasizes the usual meaning of “idealistic.” Occasionally, the award was given for some less recent work, some hitherto unappreciated note of idealism in an earlier writing. Two examples, among many, are Bjornson’s tales of peasant life, with interwoven 20 THE NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS sagas and poetry, Arne and A Happy Boy, or Mistral’s Mireio, the pastoral poem of Provence which was written more than forty years before the prize was given. In these two cases, as will be noted later, there was appreciation of efforts to rescue a dialect or lan¬ guage from literary desuetude. Upon both writers and readers, the influence of the Nobel awards in literature has been to promote broader interests and sympathies, more earnest study of standards and as¬ pirations in widely separated races. CHAPTER II POETS OF FRANCE AND PROVENCE The prize of 1901 has been awarded: Sully-Prudhomme, Rene Frangois Armand, member of the French Academy, born 1839, died September 7, 1907: “as an acknowledgment of his excellent merit as an author, and espe¬ cially of the high idealism, artistic perfection, as well as the unusual combination of qualities of the heart and genius to which his work bears witness.” 1 There has been a steadily cumulative interest fn the Nobel prizes, during the last twenty-five years. Proof is found by comparing journals of 1901 and 1925, with reference to data and discussion of prize winners of the respective years. That the will of Alfred Nobel was an epochal document, in the history of science and literature, was a slowly recognized truth. What is .idealism in literature? What writers will be can¬ didates with books “of idealistic tendency”? How important will be the influence of such awards? Such were queries in many minds. The meaning of ideal¬ ism is elastic in interpretation, as examples among the winners will testify. A general principle holds, how¬ ever, in past and present standards — the idealistic 1 Inscription with the Nobel Prize Award in Literature, 1901. 21 22 THE NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS writer sees beyond nature and externals; he sees “with the eye of the spirit.” The difference has been ex¬ pressed in fitting analogy, by contrast between a photo¬ graph and a portrait of the same individual — if the latter is painted by an intuitive artist, with vision and insight, as well as artistic technic. Rene Frangois Armand Sully-Prudhomme, the first author to win the prize in literature, in 1901, received adulatory comments from French journals and several pages of personalia and criticism in literary maga¬ zines of England, Germany, Scandinavia, and America. For more than forty years he had been recognized as one of the greatest living poets, the philosophical poet of the nineteenth century in France, about whose life and work there was inadequate information in English translations; the inadequacy is still apparent. The French Academy was happy that one of its members should have been chosen for this honor, the first on the list of international candidates. Born in Paris, May 1 6, 1839, this French poet evidently belonged to the nineteenth century, in its middle and later decades, rather than to the twentieth century and its productive or prophetic writers. In the poetry of Sully-Prudhomme are found, al¬ most always, two elements sometimes in conflict, wist¬ ful tenderness and serious, challenging reflection. This combination of traits may be explained, in part, SULLY-PRUDHOMME 23 by the circumstances of his inheritance and childhood. For ten years his mother had waited to marry her lover, the father of the poet; four years after their marriage, he died. Devoted to her son and believing that he had marked skill in science, she gave him every possible chance for education; but his home life was lacking in gayety or lighter interests. At the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris, Rene Sully-Prudhomme ex¬ celled in mathematical sciences and his future seemed assured as a scholar and teacher. Then an illness affected his eyes so seriously that he had to abandon concentrated study and he began to write poems of philosophic trend, questioning the meaning of life yet vibrating with emotion. The first collection of his poems, Stances et poemes, appeared when he was twenty-six years old. It was received with encomiums from critics and sold so well that he determined to relinquish the hope of ever be¬ coming either a scientist or a lawyer and decided that he would devote his time to poetry. In this collection is found “Le vase brise,” one of the most familiar of his poems, with the extended analogy between the broken vase, the verbena, and the heart; here is the echoing refrain, II est brise, n’y touchez pas. The next year Les Epreuves, translated as The Test , 24 THE NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS was published, followed by Les Solitudes three years later, and Les vrais tendresses, in 1875. In these poetic meditations he showed the conflict, ever present in his own nature, between the reason and the emotions, le combat sans vainqueur Entre la foi sans preuve et la raison sans charme. Even more pronounced was this motif of disharmony in the two later poems, La Justice and Le Bonheur. By his countrymen he was hailed as successor to Victor Hugo and was elected to membership in the French Academy in 1881. In the long and best known poem by Sully-Prudhomme, La Justice , there are strong traces of the influence of Lucretius, the classic poet whom he admired and translated with felicitous skill. A Prologue and an Epilogue and eleven “Vigils” com¬ prise the structure of this poetic search for the element of Justice. There are two divisions ; Part I is entitled “Silence au coeur,” rendered into English as “Heart, Be Silent!” and Part II, “Appel au coeur.” The chosen medium of expression is dialogue between two symbolic characters, “The Seeker,” who analyzes all things with metaphysical exactness, and “A Voice” which proclaims the “divine aspect in all things.” Justice cannot be located in the Universe; it may be found in the heart of man, “which is its inviolable and sacred temple.” / SULLY-PRUDHOMME 25 As La Justice exemplified the search for Justice in Universal Nature, so Le Bonheur, the second long poem published in 1888, was a symbolic epic, a prog¬ ress towards supreme Happiness by three routes — curiosity, sensuousness and science, virtue and sacri¬ fice. The three Parts have been called, in one trans¬ lation, “Intoxication,” “Thought,” “The Supreme Flight” (“Le supreme essor”). There are lines that are strained in effect, far less convincing and harmoni¬ ous than the arguments in La Justice ; by contrast there are passages of poetic beauty. Faustus and Stella are the two seekers after Happiness. In a climax — which might be more dramatic — they “take flight” spiritually from the temptations and disillusionments of earth to seek, in sacrifice, their fruition of possible happi¬ ness. One of the colleagues of Sully-Prudhomme, who has written frankly of his personality and poetry, is Ana- tole France. In the biography of the latter, Anatole France: the Man and His Work by James Lewis May,2 among the vignettes written of the group of poet- friends who discussed life and literature, is a typical sketch of Sully-Prudhomme, at the age of thirty-six, “mathematical and even geometrical in his sonnets.” He stressed his intellectuality, as well as his handsome face and wealth. More illumining, and far more 2 London and New York, 1924. 2 6 THE NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS sympathetic, is the analytic study of Sully-Prudhomme, in the chapter entitled “Three Poets” in Anatole France’s critiques On Life and Letters, first series, translated by A. W. Evans. 3 Comparing Sully- Prudhomme, Frangois Coppee and Frederic Plessis, the critic finds in the first poet, “in his favour, not only the mysterious gifts of the poet but, in addition, an ab¬ solute sincerity, an inflexible gentleness, a pity without weakness, and a candour, a simplicity that lift his phil¬ osophical scepticism, as it were on wings, into the lofty regions whither formerly the mystics were exalted by faith.” As a friend and confidant, he extols this man of gentle melancholy, sentimental yet reflective, ro¬ mantic yet philosophical. Edward Dowden, in his essay on “Some French Writers of Verse,” 4 attributes the seeming unhap¬ piness, or melancholy of Sully-Prudhomme, reflected in some of his poetry, to the lack of a creed or a loyalty to which he can give absolute devotion. He calls him “an eclectic” and finds an analogy in the tale of Merlin, the poetical romance by Edgar Quinet. He stresses the almost feminine sensitiveness of this poet, a woman’s tenderness which in no way dimin¬ ishes his manly vigor. An individual of “harder or 3 London and New York, 1922, pp. 133-144.

SULLY-PRUDHOMME 27 narrower personality” would not have been so dis¬ turbed by the conflicts between reason and emotion, by the deterrents to perfect happiness. Ill health for many years was a contributory factor, doubtless, to many moods of introspective sadness. He suffered from partial paralysis in later years. Francis Grier¬ son in Parisian Portraits 5 gives a graphic, intimate picture of this “typical Academician” with grace of manners and intuitive insight into people, waging war against his illusions with the part of his mind that was scientific, and maintaining his poetic vision by his sensi¬ tive emotions. At his home in the rue de Faubourg he always welcomed younger poets. He seldom went into society, although he was often found at the salons of Countess Diane de Beausacq, the author of Maximes de la vie. This woman of independent spirit and beautiful hair, who was dressed in tones of lavender, was an inspiration to the poet. To¬ gether they discussed philosophy and art; Sully- Prudhomme emphasized “the aristocracy of the mind,” the eternal quality of poetry, music, taste, and judg¬ ment. After the Franco-Prussian War, which was a great strain upon the physical and spiritual endurance of the poet, Sully-Prudhomme wrote Impressions that awak¬ ened political discussion and revealed his pervasive 5 London, 1913, pp. 66-81. 28 THE NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS idealism. Essays upon the Fine Arts, The Art of Versification and Le testament poetique were expres¬ sions of his poetic studies and theories. On the other hand, Que sais-je? which appeared in 1895 was an¬ other index to his scientific inquiries into natural science, philosophy, and metaphysics. A commenta¬ tor upon these queries, well entitled What Do I Know?, has said that his last words might be summa¬ rized as “peut-etre.” Doubts, yet never bitterness of despair, characterize his speculative poetry. Four years after he received the Nobel prize and two years before his death, at the age of sixty-six, he wrote La male religion selon Pascal, a last record of his pro¬ found search for spiritual values in life and literature. Several of the shorter poems by Sully-Prudhomme, chosen from the five volumes of his verse, have been translated into English by such poets as Arthur O’Shaughnessy, E. and R. Prothero, and Dorothy Frances Guiney. These metrical interpretations are found in anthologies of French poetry by H. Carring¬ ton and Albert Boni. The latter has included a few of the most representative and musical of Sully- Prudhomme’s poems in The Modern Book of French Verse. A wistful love poem is here entitled “A Sup¬ plication,” translated by I. O. L. : 6 6 The Modern Book of French Verse, edited by Albert Boni, New York, 1920. By permission of Boni & Liveright. SULLY-PRUDHOMME 29 Oh ! did you know how the tears apace Fall by a lonely heart, alas! I think that before my dwelling place Sometimes you did pass. And did you know of the hopes that arise In wearied soul from a pure young glance, Maybe to my window you’d lift your eyes As if by chance. . . . ****** But if you knew of the love that enwraps My soul for you, and holds it fast, Quite simple over my threshold, perhaps, You’d step at last. More typical of this scientist-poet is the verse- picture entitled “The Appointment,” translated by Arthur O’Shaughnessy.7 ’Tis late; the astronomer in his lonely height, Exploring all the dark, descries afar Orbs that like distant isles of splendor are, And mornings whitening in the infinite. Like winnowed grain the worlds go by in flight, Or swarm in glistening spaces nebular; He summons one disheveled wandering star, — Return ten centuries hence on such a night. The star will come. It dare not by one hour Cheat Science, or falsify her calculation; Men will have passed, but watchful in the tower Man shall remain in sleepless contemplation; 7 Ibid. 30 THE NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS And should all men have perished there in turn, Truth in their place would watch that star’s return. Not all of the verses by Sully-Prudhomme are as pictorial as these selections. There is an unevenness more than usual in his meditative stanzas. While his popularity waned with the years and new rivals, he was long the honored bard of France, with name linked with that of Victor Hugo in his meditative poetry. The Nobel prize stimulated new interest among world readers; more translations and critical estimates appeared — and are still being issued. Maurice Baring in a recent book of criticism, Punch and Judy and Other Essays, has written words of succinct analysis of this French poet: he distinguishes him as “a poet who thinks and not a thinker who merely uses poetry for recreation.” He adds, of his simple yet fastidious form, “Other poets have had a more glowing imagination; his verse is neither exuber¬ ant in colour nor rich in sonorous combinations of sound. The grace of his verse is one of outline and not of colour; his compositions are distinguished by his subtle rhythm; his verse is as if carved in ivory, his music is like that of a unison of stringed instru¬ ments.” 8 8 Punch and Judy and Other Essays by Maurice Baring, New York, 1924, pp. 216-219.

FREDERIC MISTRAL Frederic Mistral Poet of Provence 31 The prize of 1904 has been awarded, one half to: Mistral, Frederic, born 1830, died March 25, 1914: “for reason of the fresh originality, rich genius, and true artistry in his poetry that faithfully mirrors the nature and life of the people of his native country; and also with respect to his sig¬ nificant activity as Provengal philologist.” 9 Three years after the first Nobel prize in literature had been awarded to Sully-Prudhomme, it came again to a writer who is ranked among French authors, although he is distinctively of Provence, Frederic Mis¬ tral. This poet of Mireio, a pastoral epic, if one may use the term, and the preserver of the Provencal lan¬ guage from literary oblivion, shared the financial award and the honor for 1904 with Echegaray, the Spanish dramatist, who is discussed in another chapter of this book. Mistral was seventy-four years old when this recognition came to him; he lived for ten years longer, wielding influence upon world literature and receiving reverential homage in his own Provence. His home in later years was in the same quiet town of Maillane, in the Bouches-du-Rhone where he was born in 1830. His father was a wealthy farmer who had aspira- 9 Inscription with the Nobel Prize Award in Literature, 1904. 32 THE NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS tions to make his son a lawyer. The boy was sent to school at Avignon and, later, took his degree at Nimes University and studied at Aix. One of the teachers at Avignon was Joseph Roumanille who had a large share in restoring interest in the language. He compiled a fixed orthography of the Provencal forms and revived racial sentiment in the schools. Like his pupil, Mistral, he was a firm advocate of classic poetry. Twenty years before, a famous bar¬ ber, Jacques Jasmin of Agen, had recited troubadour songs throughout the villages and had preserved, by voice, many native legends and folk ballads. It is said that he gave his receipts in money to charity and that, within a few years, he had gathered $300,000. The school-teacher formed a society of young men at Avignon, including “seven poets and dreamers,” among whom were numbered Roumanille, Mistral, Aubaniel, Mathieu, and Brunet. They pledged alle¬ giance to Poetry, Love, and Provence. There has been general acceptance of the statement that Mistral gave to this group of poets the name of Felibres, orig¬ inally called “The Seven Felibres” or Scribes of the Law. They agreed to write in their native language of Provence, to extend its knowledge and use, so that it might be more than a dialect. They maintained that it was similar to that of the medieval troubadours, that it came from the language of Rome and thus was By courtesy of The New York Public Library FREDERIC MISTRAL FREDERIC MISTRAL 33 the parent tongue of Italy, France, and Spain. AL though some of these statements have been seriously questioned by orthographers, the enthusiasm of these ^elibres was acclaimed and literary masterpieces fol¬ lowed; the celebrations of the Felibres are still note¬ worthy festivals. Another story is that Mistral, who was very fond of his mother, began to write his verses in French and brought them to her, assured of her encouragement and praise. Alas ! his mother could not read French, although she was confident that her son was a poet of rare genius. “Let us sing in the language of our mother!” was the determination of the youth. He collected legends, folk-tales, and romantic episodes from every possible source near his home in Provence. In 1858 was published the first edition of Mireio t the pastoral epic which has held its literary rank, with increasing appreciation, for more than sixty years. Roumanille was sponsor for this work; the next year a French translation was made by Mistral and the book amazed Parisians by its poetic charm. It was dedicated to Lamartine. Mistral was compared, by enthusiastic critics, to Vergil, Theocritus, and Ariosto. Into the twelve Cantos of his poem Mistral wove many local customs and personal memories. The mas , or farmstead, was modeled from his own home and Ramoun, the wealthy w^-dweller, had many 34 THE NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS traits of his own father. Familiar to him from boy¬ hood had been the festivals and daily tasks here por¬ trayed — the wheat-threshing, the snail-gathering, the fireside meals, the dance of the farandole on the eve of harvest day. In outline it is a simple, somewhat conventional theme. Mireio, daughter of a “farmer- prince,” loved the son of a poor basket-weaver; their romance had days of joy and nights of deep sorrow; the epical climax of the death of Mireio at the Church of the Holy Maries is relieved of its grim tragedy by the words of hope on the lips of the dying her¬ oine. There is a gayety of spirit, a zest of life in the open¬ ing lines of Invocation, the poet’s promise to tell the life story of this lovely girl of fifteen and her innocent, ardent passion: I sing the love of a Provencal maid; How through the wheat-fields of La Crau she strayed Following the fate that drew her to the sea. Unknown beyond remote La Crau was she; And I, who tell the rustic tale of her, Would fain be Homer’s humble follower. What though youth’s aureole was her only crown? And never gold she wore, nor damask gown? I’ll build her up a throne out of my song, And hail her queen in our despis’d tongue. Mine be the simple speech that ye all know, Shepherds and farmer-folk of lone La Crau. FREDERIC MISTRAL 35 The romantic episodes are told in the cantos, “The Suitors,” “The Battle,” “The Witch,” “The Saints,” ‘ Death.” Graphic pictures of local customs and setting are suggested by the subtitles “Lotus Farm,” “Leaf-Picking,” “The Cocooning,” and “the Ca- margue” (or salty marshes of the Rhone). Exquisite songs are interspersed like this in Canto III, “The Cocooning” : If thou the moon wilt be, Sailing in glory, I’ll be the halo white Hovering every night Around and o’er thee. If thou become a flower, Before thou thinkest, I’ll be a streamlet clear, And all the waters bear That thou, love, drinkest. Mireio was made familiar to American readers of the last generation by the translation of Harriet Wa¬ ters Preston (Boston, 1872). Several excerpts from her verse-interpretations of this and Mistral’s later poems are to be found in Library of the World’s Best Literature, edited by Charles Dudley Warner; an excellent sketch of the poet is found here. With unique, virile words George Meredith has rendered 3 6 THE NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS into verse some stanzas from Canto X, “The Mares of Camargue” : 10 A hundred mares, all white! their manes Like mace-reed of the marshy plains Thick-tufted, wavy, free o’ the shears: And when the fiery squadron rears Bursting at speed, each mane appears Even as the white scarf of a fay Floating upon their necks along the heavens away. When the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of Mire'io was celebrated at Arles, Calve sang the “Song of Magali” and noted French actors and opera ar¬ tists rendered Gounod’s Mireille, which is based upon Mistral’s pastoral. The most dramatic canto is the eighth, the flight of the heroine across the rocky plains of La Crau, finding shelter at the shrine of the Holy Maries. The maiden’s prayer for help in her hour of need, for understanding of her love for her “handsome Vincen,” is wistful and appealing. Two cantos have been devoted to revival of these old legends of the Holy Maries. Disciples of Jesus, driven from Palestine after his crucifixion, according to tradition, were set afloat in a barque by their persecu¬ tors. They had neither sail nor oars. They were washed ashore on the sacred soil where now stands the 10 Poems by George Meredith, New York, 1897, 1898. By per¬ mission of Charles Scribner’s Sons, and the heirs of George Meredith. FREDERIC MISTRAL 37 village of Les Saintes Maries. Among these disciples were Lazarus and his sisters, Mary and Martha, their servant Sarah (who was the patron saint of gypsies), Mary Magdalene, Joseph of Arimathea, and Tro- phine, one of the oldest and wisest of the disciples who converted to Christianity the town of Arles. Two long narrative poems followed Mireio — Calendau and Nerto. The former, published in 1867, is more potent in dramatic skill than the earlier pas¬ toral. It has lines of emotional intensity, when the heroine, a Princess who lost her rank because of love for a humble suitor, inspires him by her fine spirit and tales of prowess and chivalry. “The Scaling of Ventour” is a dramatic episode in this poem. Two stanzas, translated by Harriet Waters Preston, indi¬ cate the action and colorful quality; this is a descrip¬ tion of “the catch” : 11 Yet had we brave and splendid sport, I ween, For some with tridents, some with lances keen, Fell on the prey. And some were skilled to fling A winged dart held by a slender string. The wounded wretches, ’neath the wave withdrew, Trailing red lines along the mirror blue. Slowly the net brimful of treasures mounted ; Silver was there, turquoise and gold uncounted, Rubies and emeralds million-rayed. The men 11 By permission of the Atlantic Monthly Co. 38 THE NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS Flung them thereon like eager children when They stay their mother’s footsteps to explore Her apron bursting with its summer store Of apricots and cherries. There is less atmosphere in Nerto, an epic tale of the last days of the Popes at Avignon and “the miraculous burial-place,” The Aliscamp of history Far below Arles. The legend of this spot is one of the best portions of Nerto : out of the heaven came, Our Lord himself to bless the spot, And left, if the tale erreth not The impress of his bended knee, Rock-graven. Howso this may be, Full oft a swarm of angels white Bends hither, on a tranquil night, Singing celestial harmonies.12 Among the collections of lyrics of love and patriotism by Mistral the earlier volume in 1875, entitled Les Isles d,Or) contained songs in many moods. Lamar¬ tine listened to recital of these and other verses “in the sweet nervous idiom of Provence, which combines the Latin pronunciation with the grace of Attica and the 13 Translated by Harriet Waters Preston. By permission of Atlantic Monthly Co. FREDERIC MISTRAL 39 serenity of Tuscany.” He adds, “The verses of Mistral were liquid and melodious, they pleased with¬ out intoxicating me.” 13 The later collection, issued in 1912, was entitled Les Olivades. Mistral thus ex¬ plained the title: “The days that grow chill and the swelling seas — all things tell me that the winter of my life has come, and that I must without delay gather my olives and offer the virgin-oil on the altar of God.” At this time the poet was eighty-two years old. He had written an autobiography, Mes origines, with reminiscences of his youth, which was translated as Memoirs of Mistral by Constance Elisabeth Maud; the lyrics of Provence were rendered into English here by Alma Strettell (Mrs. Lawrence Harrison). Few writers have had more intensive love of country than Mistral. He refused the offer of a chair in the French Academy because it would neces¬ sitate leaving Provence; he was given prizes by the Academy and badges of the Legion. Late in mature years he married a beautiful young woman of Arlesian family; she has been crowned Queen of the Felibres, in a yearly festival of contests and songs. Towards the close of the nineteenth century Mistral began col¬ lecting specimens of Provencal flowers, rocks, and archeological relics for a museum at Arles; he called this his “last poem.” In a typical mas, or farmstead, 13 Cours familier de litterature. 40 THE NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS he placed these collections and equipment of varied kinds, showing the customs of the land. He rep¬ resented, also, certain feasts and traditions by wax figures. Among others, here is the Arlesian legend of the feast of Noel and the visit of three women to a mother and her first-born; one brings a match that the child’s body may be straight, another brings an egg, that his life may be full, and a third brings salt, symbol of wisdom.14 A large part of the Nobel prize money was used by Mistral for the housing and equip¬ ment of this Museum. Alphonse Daudet, like Mistral, is a native of Provence. The natives admire the literary grace and wit of the former, “even if he may laugh at us oc¬ casionally,” they say, but they love Mistral. For ten years the latter worked upon his Comprehensive Lex¬ icon of Ancient and Modern Provencal } which was published in two large volumes in 1886. He was honored by the educated classes and loved by the peasantry, landowners, and boatmen of the Rhone. In 1897 he incorporated into his narrative in verse, Le poeme du Rhone , many customs and songs of the days before steamships had increased the speed of travel and reduced its picturesqueness. In twelve cantos he celebrated this famous river and its border 14 “Frederic Mistral: Poet of the Soil” by Vernon Loggins, Sewanee Review, March, 1924. FREDERIC MISTRAL 41 towns. A dramatic scene recalled the flight of Na¬ poleon across the border from Russia. As poetic art this poem is inferior to Mireio or Calendau ; it lacks spontaneity yet it has musical measures. Poet of the soil was Mistral, akin in his simplicity and loyalty to Burns and Whittier, although more of a scholar and technician than either of these writers of verse. Like them, however, he created anew the life of his rural people; he touched daily incidents with poetic beauty. He received many distinguished vis¬ itors from every country in his later years and treas¬ ured letters from scholars of every land. Among the latter was a letter from Theodore Roosevelt written when he was President and had received a copy of a new edition of Mireio ; to the poet he ac¬ knowledged his indebtedness of many years for the delights that he had found in this wistful love poem of Provence, which mirrored so perfectly the traditions and life of the people. CHAPTER III TWO GERMAN SCHOLARS: THEODOR MOMMSEN— RUDOLF EUCKEN The prize of 1902 has been awarded: Mommsen, Theodor, Professor of History at the University of Berlin, born 1817, died November I, 1903: “the greatest living master of the age in the art of representing history, taking into especial regard his monumental work, Romische Geschichte.” 1 France was the first country to be honored by the Nobel prize in literature; Germany was the second. In 1902, Theodor Mommsen, whose records of scholarship included history, law and archeology, was the chosen candidate. He was eighty-four years old and lived for only a year after the award. While there was gratification among his countrymen and friends in other lands, at his recognition and this high honor, yet there were adverse comments in several journals about the perversion of the intent of Nobel’s will. The recipient had finished his work; the award could never quicken him to further research or expres¬ sion of idealism. This choice showed the intention 1 Inscription with the Nobel Prize Award in Literature, 1902. 42 THEODOR MOMMSEN 43 of the Swedish Academy to consider “literature” in a broad sense, including contributions of scientific value as well as those of artistic merit. Garding, in Schleswig, was the birthplace of Mommsen; his school days were spent at Kiel. Be¬ fore he was thirty years old he had been employed by the Berlin Academy to decipher and examine Roman inscriptions in Italy and France, because of marked accuracy and zest in research. He combined the read¬ ing of law with that of history and, in 1848, was called to the department of law at Leipzig University. Always fearless in political convictions and ardent in Liberalism, he was obliged to retire from this Uni¬ versity because of active participation in the political issues of 1848-1849. Two years later he was called to professorship of Roman law at Zurich; after serv¬ ice here for two years he accepted a similar position at Breslau. In all these places he was recognized as magnetic in the classroom and inspirational in his contact with University students from all parts of the civilized world. In 1858, he went to the Univer¬ sity of Berlin as Professor of Ancient History and there extended his influence among scholars and lay readers. Although specific in his interests and a student of deep earnestness, he had read and traveled widely; as conversationalist he excelled, informed upon topics 44 THE NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS in almost every branch of learning and activity. To him has been attributed the oft quoted sentence, “Each student must choose his special field of labour but he must not imprison himself within its confines.” 2 He was called “the modern Erasmus” because of his versatile knowledge. He wrote with facility and grace, as well as vigor, whether his theme was a monumental History of Rome , or a journalistic discus¬ sion of current affairs. In political creed he belonged to the National Liberal Party. He was, however, never partisan in his ultimate purposes and hopes for future union of factions. He opposed Bismarck in his tenets and sometimes won over him in courts of law and in the Prussian House of Delegates, by his keen, logical mind. At the same time, he admired the Chancellor very much and said, “What a calamity it is for us all that political animosity should deprive us of the privilege of mixing socially with such a man!” On principle, he was opposed to British attitude towards the Boers, and gave his allegiance to the revolutionists. Again, he deplored the strained re¬ lations at times between his country and England and asserted, “What a pity that two great nations of kin¬ dred race should remain at loggerheads!” 3 He de- 2 Bookman, 18: 346. 3 Ibid. 346-348, December, 1903, article on Mommsen. By permission of the Editor of The Bookman. PHEODOR MOMMSEN 45 tested slavery and considered the Civil War in the United States “a holy crusade.” 4 More than one hundred volumes of original writing and translations from the Latin and Germanic lan¬ guages are listed under Mommsen’s name in large German libraries. Edward A. Freeman, a critic and historian of international repute, has called Mommsen “the greatest scholar of our times, well-nigh the great¬ est scholar of all times.” His writings show mastery of law, languages, customs, archeology, coins, inscrip¬ tions and monuments, that are of inestimable value to students. He was editor of Corpus inscriptionum Latinarum which was issued by the Berlin Academy of which he was secretary for many years. To the average reader, however, the name of Theodor Mommsen will always be associated with his History of Rome, written 1854—1856, which still maintains its authenticity and popularity. As a writer, Mommsen was always illumining, with a vivid style; he was often dramatic. He touched descriptive scenes with grace and color but he was convincingly realistic in his por¬ trayal of events and characters. He unfolded a large canvas but he kept a true focus and threw a strong light upon both individuals and group-pictures, from the early days of Rome to the death of Julius Caesar. 4 Some Eighteenth Century Byways and Other Essays by John Buchan, Edinburgh and London, 1908, William Blackwood & Sons. 46 THE NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS Although his masterwork was entitled History of Rome, he explained, in the Introductory Chapter, that he intended “to relate the history of Italy, not simply the record of the city of Rome.” While the Romans represented the most powerful branch of the Italian stock, yet they were only a branch — but this civic community of Rome gained sovereignty over Italy and the world of its day. Like the historian Freeman, Mommsen insisted upon “the unity of history,” the similarity of human nature from 1800 B. c. to modern times. Few writers have surpassed him in revivifying historical characters. He had strong likes and dis¬ likes, prejudices which he could impress upon the reader, although he was generally justified in his state¬ ments and balanced in his estimates. The portrait of Cicero, which “was bitten with vitriolic energy,” as Mr. Buchan has said, in Some Eighteenth Century By¬ ways and Other Essays , has been most widely quoted; it is less impartial than his characterizations of Han¬ nibal, Sully, and Caesar. By temperament and political bias, Mommsen was an admirer of Julius Caesar; he has given to him a living portraiture. The pictorial Chapter IV in Book III, descriptive of Hannibal’s Passage of the Alps, is a world-famous extract from this History of Rome. In the same chapter is the analysis of Hannibal’s character, so often quoted: “He was primarily marked by that THEODOR MOMMSEN 47 inventive craftiness, which forms one of the leading traits of the Phoenician character; he was fond of taking singular and unexpected routes: ambushes and stratagems of all sorts were familiar to him; he studied the character of his antagonists with unprecedented care. . . . The power which he wielded over men is shown by his incomparable control over an army of various natives and many tongues. . . . He was a great man; wherever he went, he riveted the eyes of all.” 5 6 There is history of dramatic incident, written with pictorial skill, in such passages as the Battle of Cannae, the story of the Gracchi, and the Crossing of the Rubicon. The breadth of Mommsen’s interests are suggested by such later chapters as those on Roman Religion, Manners, and Literature and Art. While he was deeply interested in the past, and informed about its aspects and personalities, he was alert in all move¬ ments of the present and their trends. He looked to the future with prevision and optimism. In the In¬ troductory Chapter to his famous History of Rome he contrasts modern history with past cycles of culture which will be repeated and adds : “And yet this goal will only be temporary: the grandest system of civili- 5 History of Rome by Theodor Mommsen, translated by William P. Dickson, New York, 1908, Vol. II, pp. 244, 245.

Rudolf Eucken German Philosopher The prize of 1908 has been awarded: Eucken, Rudolf, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Jena, born 1846: “because of the sincerity of his search for truth, the penetrating power of thought, the clarity of vision, the warmth and force of interpretation with which he has, in his numerous works, cultivated and developed an ideal world philosophy.” 7 In 1908, six years after the Nobel prize came to Mommsen, it was again awarded to a German scholar, Rudolf Eucken.

RUDOLF EUCKEN 49 countries other than his own, this recipient was no stranger to readers of current literature. Born in 1846, in Aurich, East Friesland, Eucken was younger than the majority of the earlier winners; he accom¬ plished much writing and lecturing after the honor had been given. His mature life was devoted to a struggle against the materialistic philosophy of his day. He was a worthy winner of a prize for “the most distinguished work of an idealistic tendency” in his country. His incessant purpose was expressed in his autobiography: “My reminiscences tell about all of the struggle to prevent the externalization of life. This externalization is not, it is true, the defect or fault of one particular nation; it is found in every nation and a radical change is needed in each. . . . Every man who shares the conviction that a spiritual reformation is needed will follow with a kindly sym¬ pathy the modest efforts which are recorded in my reminiscences.” 8 His native province, East Friesland, is an agri¬ cultural and trading region in Germany, near Holland, with occasional fisheries as industry. His birth town, Aurich, is the commercial and social center. The boy’s childhood was somewhat sad; he was the 8 Rudolf Eucken: His Life, Work and Travels by himself, trans¬ lated by Joseph McCabe, New York, 1922. By permission of Charles Scribner’s Sons. 50 THE NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS first child born to his parents after ten years of mar¬ riage, and his father died when the lad was five years old. He had a series of misfortunes in his infancy and youth : his throat was badly torn in the effort to extricate a curtain-fastener which he nearly swallowed as a baby; he had scarlet fever and wrong treatment, so that he was threatened with blindness for a time but recovered; a younger brother’s death added to the family gloom. Rudolf Eucken inherited studious inclinations. His father, spending his days in the postal service, was a fine mathematician. His mother (daughter of a clergyman who was a leader of Radicalism) was well- read in science and ambitious for her son; the latter records that she was, also, a practical housewife. Af¬ ter the father’s death their finances were low and the mother took lodgers to add to her income. She was determined that Rudolf should be well educated, that he should become a philosopher or scientist. He recalls his debt to her in his reminiscences. At the gymnasium at Aurich he showed interest in mathe¬ matics and in music. A strong influence of those plastic days was his teacher, Reuter, who was forced to retire by the bureaucracy because of his liberalism. Other professors who left traces upon his development were Letze and Teichmuller. For a time he was at the University of Berlin. After experimental teach- RUDOLF EUCKEN 5i ing he was called to Basel as professor of philosophy. His mother went with him but their plans for happy years together were shattered by her death. Basel was at this time a small University with about one hundred and fifty students; Eucken came into close contact with these in the classroom and outside ac¬ tivities. Already he had begun to write studies upon philosophers of classic days, Aristotle and others. In 1873 he accepted a call to Jena University where he was brought into comradeship with such brilliant associates as Kuno Fischer, Haeckel and Hildebrand. The issue, in 1878, of Eucken’s book, Fundamental Ideas of the Present Day (or The Fundamental Con¬ cepts of Modern Philosophic Thought ) aroused sud¬ den interest among scholars of every country in this daring, idealistic philosopher of Jena University. The basic idea was to emphasize the harmonious re¬ lations of history and criticism. At the request of President Noah Porter of Yale University, a trans¬ lation of this book into English was made by Professor M. Stuart Phelps; thus American readers became ac¬ quainted with this German scholar who was to enter later into friendly contact with academic organizations here. By his marriage, in 1882, to Irene Passow, Eucken increased his prestige among intellectual and social leaders. He says that his wife “was not one of the THE NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS 52 learned women,” but that she had intellectual interests, gifts in art, and fine administrative ability. Her mother was the daughter of the noted archeologist, Ulrich, born in Athens; thus Eucken’s circle of friends widened among scientists and historians. He con¬ tinued to write books with cumulative power, like The Life of the Spirit, Contributions to the History of Modern Philosophy , The Problem, of Human Life as Viewed by the Great Thinkers, Life’s Basis and Life’s Ideals, Christianity and the New Idealism. 9 Many of his own countrymen, who were materialistic philos¬ ophers or monistic evolutionists, criticized Eucken severely; he declared the German press “ignored him.” He popularized religious philosophy, especially under such titles as The Truth of Religion, and Can We Still Be Christians f He was invited to deliver lec¬ tures in Holland, France, England, and America. Some of these later books followed the award of the Nobel prize in 1908. He was called “the winning dark horse of that year” ; he said that the honor came as “a great surprise” to him. As further recognition he was made a member of the Swedish Academy of Sciences. The comments in the German press were noticeably restrained beside the enthusiastic tributes in France, Holland, and England. In 19 11 he went to England and, later, to America as academic lec- 9 For further titles, see bibliography and list of translators.

His wife and daughter came with him to America and were guests in the homes of Professors Moore and Miin- sterburg at Cambridge. The reader of his Reminis¬ cences will smile at some of the comments upon Ameri¬ cans and his reception here. In Germany, with the arrival of “an exchange professor” and his first lecture, there is a demonstration of welcome, with formal pro¬ gram and the presence of notables in statescraft as well as letters. He found no such condition at Harvard University. He presented himself to President Lowell and was told, “You may begin at once.” 10 By contrast he says, with naivete, President Butler of Columbia University gave a banquet in honor of Eucken and Bergson, who were lecturing in New York at the same time. Among Americans whom the German scholar met with friendly contact were Andrew Carnegie and Roosevelt. He says of the latter, “With Roosevelt I had a very spirited conversation on American ideal¬ ism and its future, in which he gave proof of consider¬ able historical knowledge.” 11 He found Americans, 10 Rudolf Eucken: His Life, IVork and Travels by himself, trans¬ lated by Joseph McCabe, New York, 1922, p. 162.

After he returned from America, he planned a trip to Japan and China, hoping to carry into the Orient his principles of ideal¬ istic philosophy; he sought cooperation of all nations in “solving problems of life.” The war interfered with this project and caused him deep depression. He tried in every way to appeal to the less material¬ istic traits of his people. In 1915, he wrote The B.earers of German Idealism, a book which sold copies by the tens of thousands and supplemented, in a way, his earlier volume, The Historical Significance of the German People. He found the war “the saddest mo¬ ment in German history”; he felt the nations were dis¬ loyal to themselves and sentiments of honor. His daughter, a musician of rare gifts, lost her lover dur¬ ing the war. In his sons, one a physician and another a political economist, Eucken saw examples of many of his idealistic influences. The writings of Eucken, especially those of religious trend, have been popular in America, as well as Eng¬ land. Several of his essays have been collected and translated by Meyrick Booth. In the Harper’s Li¬ brary of Living Thought is the translation by Lucy Judge Gibson and W. R. Boyce Gibson of his Christian¬ ity and the New Idealism (1909 and 1912). The Meaning and Value of Life had one of the same trans- RUDOLF EUCKEN 55 lators; Joseph McCabe, who translated the autobiog- raphy, has rendered, also, Socialism: an Analysis (1922). Among other books in constant demand at libraries are Religion and Life, the lectures which he gave in London, Oxford, and elsewhere, 19 11, and Ethics and Modern Thought: a Theory of their Rela¬ tions, which were the Deems lectures, delivered in 1913 at New York University. These are translated by Margaret von Seydewitz from the German manuscript. Can We Still Be Christians f with its challenging title (1914) is a careful, tolerant study of historic Chris¬ tianity, an advocacy of a religion which will adapt itself to the demands of daily life. Spirituality and morality must combine to form a high level of progress and the Church must become “a repository of the facts and tasks of life itself.” Comparisons have often been made between Eucken and two other modern thinkers and writers on philos¬ ophy of kindred motive — Adolf Harnack and Henri Bergson. The former, who has been professor at Leipzig and Berlin, author of such stirring books as What Is Christianity f and History of Dogma, has the German background while Bergson, in his Creative Philosophy has written an epoch-making book with dissimilar but potent deductions. The two men, Eucken and Bergson, have been discussed in a dis¬ criminating essay by E. Hermann who thus summarizes 56 THE NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS the message of the Nobel prize winner in philosophy: “Eucken stands before us today as perhaps the great¬ est thinker of our age and the protagonist of a new idealism which satisfies our demands for moral reality as no idealistic philosophy has ever done, and as the teacher who has most fully and boldly developed the religious implications of ethical idealism. His philoso¬ phy of life is an insistence upon the supremacy of the spiritual. His defence of freedom is a doctrine of spiritual liberty rooted in the saving initiative of God and our dependence on Him. His vindication of our personality is the rescue of the free, God-centered per¬ sonality from the thralldom of a self-centered in¬ dividuality.” 12 Especially interesting is the Nobel Lecture, delivered at Stockholm, March 27, 1909, by Eucken, translated by Alban G. Widgery, Cambridge, 1912 (W. Heffer and Sons). As an introductory thought, Eucken em¬ phasizes that we are living in an age when tradition has become a subject of doubt and new ideas are strug¬ gling to guide our lives. The two terms, “ Naturalism or Idealism,” which form the title of this Nobel ad¬ dress, have become confused in meaning and have caused misunderstandings. To Eucken, Naturalism 12 Eucken and Bergson: Their Significance for Christian Thought, by E. Hermann, Boston, 1912, p. 87. By permission of The Pilgrim Press. RUDOLF EUCKEN 57 means “faith in man’s relation to Nature”; Idealism accepts this faith but asks if this is the whole of life or if there is not another kind of life, also. He pleads for domination of “The True, the Good and the Beautiful” in life, not merely utilitarian aspects. Life is not just a reflection of a given reality but a striving upward; it does not find another world but “it may produce one.” Idealism which deals with such expansion of daily life has no new aims to-day beyond that of classic times but it is emphasized, be¬ cause “we have been driven beyond the standards of Naturalism.” The task before literature is coopera¬ tion in this effort to reach a higher level, “to purify and confirm, to make the fundamental problems of our spiritual existence impressive to us, to raise life above the mere transient culture, by the realization of some¬ thing eternal.” This, as he interprets it, was the idea of Alfred Nobel in his will and awards; this has been the life purpose of Eucken as teacher and writer. CHAPTER IV BJORNSON: NORWEGIAN NOVELIST AND PLAYWRIGHT The prize of 1903 has been awarded: Bjornson, Bjornstjerne, born 1832, died April 26, 1910: “as a tribute acknowledging his noble, splendid and varied works of art which have always been distinguished by fresh¬ ness of inspiration, and, at the same time, by unusual purity of soul.” 1 One of the five members elected by the Norwegian Storthing, to select the winners of the prize for the promotion of peace, under terms of Nobel’s will, was Bjornstjerne Bjornson. It was a fitting choice for he was a vigorous advocate of world peace, an ardent worker in all causes for “the benefit of mankind.” When the award in literature for 1903 was given to him, he was already known as “Norway’s Father.” As writer of novels and plays, he had been read more widely than almost any other Scandinavian of his day, at that time surpassing Ibsen in translated works. As publicist and orator, as manager of theatres and civic legislator, he exerted national influence. In giv- 1 Inscription with the Nobel Prize Award in Literature, 1903. 58 By courtesy of The American-Scandinavian Foundation BJORNSTERNE BJORNSON BJORNSON: NORWEGIAN NOVELIST 59 ing him the Nobel prize the adjudicators had in mem- ory, especially, his earlier tales of peasant life which intermingled poetic idealism with sagas and realistic pictures of Norwegian life. His plays of later years, Beyond Human Power, The Editor, and Sigurd Slembe, were problem plays that awakened discussion in many countries; they were more universal and real¬ istic in tone than the earlier fiction. Bjornson had a remarkable combination of virility and gentleness. He was a Viking clansman, as he often averred, but he was also a poet, loving the folk songs and pictorial delights of rugged Norway with deep, ardent affection. The symbol of his strength, represented twice in the lingual root of his name — Bjorn, a bear — was fitting for his large, fearless mind and spiritual energy. He was a warrior when occasion demanded resistance to evil; he was a skald when he wrote tales of peas¬ antry. He was born in 1832 at Kvikne, in the valley of the Dovre Mountains. He lived seven years after the Nobel prize was given to him, keeping his mentality alert until almost the end of his seventy-eight years. His father was pastor in this small place, without beauty of scenery or fertility of soil. When the boy was six years old the family moved to a region of marked contrasts, in Romsdale. His memories of this picturesque scenery and his delights in the valleys; hills, 60 THE NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS and fjord, were commemorated in his poem, “Over the Lofty Mountains.” His school days at Molde were busy and happy; he read with insatiable appetite for sagas and history, and became devoted to the Swedish poet, Wergeland. At seventeen he went to Christiania to prepare for the University. Here he was a schoolmate of Ibsen; with typical humor he Vrote — and treasured — this doggerel of these early days : Overstrained and lean, of the colour of gypsum, Behind a beard, huge and black, was seen Henrik Ibsen. The two families cemented their friendship of many years by the marriage of Bjornson’s daughter, Berg- liot, a singer of much talent, to the son of Ibsen. At Christiania, Bjornson became much interested in Danish literature, especially drama, and he began his play, The Newly-married Couple , which was not finished until a decade later. He completed, however, a one-act play, Between the Battles, which was staged in Christiania with only moderate success. For a time he abandoned drama and devoted himself to the peas¬ ant tales, to characters of types familiar to him, against a background of Norwegian folklore. He was proud to recall that his forefathers were peasants; he knew the common people and sympathized with their customs and ambitions. He sought to blend sagas and scenes BJORNSON: NORWEGIAN NOVELIST 6 1 from modern life, with mutual interpretation. Those early stories of simple life, Arne, The Fisher Maiden, A Happy Boy , and Synnove Solbakken, were well re¬ ceived in Denmark and Germany, as well as his own country. Soon they were translated into English and commended for their simplicity, poetry, and national spirit. Sir Edmund Gosse, writing in the late i88o’s, said of Bjornson: “His spirit was as masculine as a Viking’s and as pure and tender as a maiden’s. Through these little romances there blows a wind as fragrant and refreshing as the odour of the Trondhjem balsam willows, blown out to sea to welcome the new¬ comer; and just as this rare scent is the first thing that tells the traveller of Norway, so the purity of Bjorn- son’s novelettes is usually the first thing to attract a foreigner to Norwegian literature.” 2 Mr. Georg Brandes, in his excellent study of Bjornson in Creative Spirits of the Nineteenth Cen¬ tury, affirms that the popularity of these peasant tales was not so great throughout Norway as one is inclined to believe from later reports. “People loved the peasant in the abstract” but they did not know him, nor were they deeply interested in his welfare or his aspirations. Moreover, the critics found them senti¬ mental and failed to appreciate the legends and 2 Northern Studies by Edmund Gosse, Walter Scott, London, i&oq.

In the two tales, Synnove Solbakken and Arnet Bjornson repre¬ sented two heroes of Norwegian life; Thorbjorn of the first story was the youth of physical virility, de¬ veloped by contact with gentler influences; Arne, by contrast, was dreamy and poetic, in need of more ro¬ bust experiences. There are wistful strains of melody in this story of Arne — this yearning for the ideal. Sir Edmund Gosse has translated one of these lyrics in rhymed couplets: Through the forest the boy wends all day long, For there he has heard such a wonderful song. He carved him a flute of the willow tree, And tried what the tune within it might be. The tune came out of it sad and gay, But while he listened it passed away. He fell asleep, and once more it sung, And over his forehead it lovingly hung. He thought he would catch it and wildly woke, And the tune in the frail night faded and broke. “Oh God, my God, take me up to Thee, For the tune Thou hast made is consuming me.” BJORNSON : NORWEGIAN NOVELIST 63 And the Lord God said, “ ’Tis a friend divine, Though never one hour shalt thou hold it thine. Yet all other music is poor and thin By the side of this which thou never shalt win.” 3 The character of Arne, the poetic, restless boy who tries to break away from the rock-ribbed confines of Norway, is an individual and a national type; his mother, Marit, is one of the most real, appealing women of Norwegian fiction. In these two peasant tales, and the lighter, more joyful romance of A Happy Boy , is found some of the best poetry by Bjornson. Many of these verses are found in Poems and Songs, translated by Arthur Hubbell Palmer from the Nor¬ wegian in the original meters. 4 “Synnove’s Song,” “The Day of Sunshine,” and “Ballad of Tailor Nils,” from Arne, are typical examples of his lyrics. In¬ cluded in this anthology are patriotic poems. One of these, entitled “Song of Norway,” from Synnove Sol- bakken (1859) is one of the most familiar of National Songs, beginning, Yes, we love this land that towers Where the ocean foams; Rugged, stormswept, it embowers Many thousand homes. 3 Ibid., p. 32.

Thither, when thwarted our longings, we sail, — Sighs to the clouds, that we breathe when we fail, Form a mirage of rich valley and mead Over our need, — Visions revealing the future until Faith shall fulfill, — The land that shall be ! 6 Ever after a visit to Upsala University and a longer residence in Copenhagen, Bjornson had cravings to write and to direct plays. In the latter position he served for a time, 185 7 — 1 859, at Bergen. His first plays were of saga heroes and chieftains, like Hal- vard of Between the Battles and Sigurd Slemhe or Sigurd the Bad. They possess militant virtues and moral integrity but they are driven to misdeeds and 5 This has been adapted to song by Nordraak; another, “Forward,” has been set to music by Grieg. 6 Poems and Songs by Bjornstjerne Bjornson, translated by Arthur Hubbell Palmer, from the Norwegian in the original meters, London 1915.

Thus Sigurd seeks to make peace with his half-brother, Harold Gille, but is betrayed into revenge and murder. Mr. Brandes suggests that in these plays the spiritual sufferings of Bjornson — who would elevate and har¬ monize the Norwegian people but finds himself misun¬ derstood and rejected in his idealism — are revealed by analogy. He stresses the difference between Bjornson and Ibsen in this respect and others; the former seeks, comradeship and unity; the latter is “solitary by na¬ ture.” Bjornson portrays all aspects of nature; Ibsen seldom uses such descriptions. With fine distinctions between the two men, in nature and literature, Mr. Brandes writes: “Henrik Ibsen is a judge, stern as one of the judges of Israel of old; Bjornson is a prophet, the delightful herald of a better age. In the depths of his nature, Ibsen is a great revolutionist. . . . Bjornson’s is a concilatory mind; he wages war¬ fare without bitterness. His poetry sparkles with the sunshine of April, while that of Ibsen, with its deep earnestness, seems to lurk in dark shadows.” Ibsen loved the idea ; Bjornson loved humanity. 7 Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch, in his study of Bjornson, in Adventures in Criticism 8 9 divides his writings into 7 Creative Spirits of the Nineteenth Century by Georg Brandes, translated by Rasmus B. Anderson, New York, 1923, p. 345. By per¬ mission of Thomas Y. Crowell Co. 9 London and New York, 1925. New edition. 66 THE NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS three periods which he calls “simplicity, confusion and dire confusion.” The first group of tales are those of idyllic type, already considered in Arne and A Happy Boy ; the second represent a transition towards the realistic and self-conscious, exampled in The Fisher Maiden and Magnhild; the third, showing more complications of thought and style, are like The Heri¬ tage of the Kurts (originally entitled Flags Are Fly¬ ing) and In God’s Way. The influence of German and French realists may be traced in these later novels, especially the former with its portrayal of polygamous conditions. Other critics consider Magnhild an ad¬ vance in characterization over any previous fiction by Bjornson, especially in the musician Tande and the relationship between him and Magnhild. If the author intends to show that a woman may be happy in other ways than love, he does not “get the message over” until it is interpreted by Mr. Brandes or other critics. Rationalism mingles with idealism in the first scenes of In God’s Way. As the years passed, Bjornson traveled on the con¬ tinent, in England and to America for a visit in 1 8 8 1 . He sharpened his outlook upon life but he never lost his “passion for truth,” his hatred of oppression in any form, his belief that individuals and nations might be joined by friendship rather than separated by antag¬ onisms. He was deeply impressed by certain forms BJORNSON: NORWEGIAN NOVELIST 67 of hypocrisy which he witnessed in Norway and he attacked such abuses in the problem plays, The King, The Editor, and The Bankrupt. Unlike the tradi¬ tional patriot who says, “My country — right or wrong — but my country!” Bjornson adopted as his slogan, “Norway must be right at all cost!” His plays, which revealed innate evils, made him unpopular with politicians and brought about threats of violence. He used to tell, with humor, of the visit of some aggressive opponents among the young men who threw stones at his windows but went away singing the refrain of his National Song, Yes, we love this land that towers, etc. As dramatist, Bjornson attained a skill which is being recognized by students of to-day. The Newly- married Couple, which was, probably, the first play to be written in original draft but held for later publi¬ cation, has a psychological theme, well constructed — the adjustment necessary between the love of a maiden for her parents and the new, strange love for her hus¬ band. The characters are vital and the lines effective. Another early play, Lame Hulda ( Halta Hulda) , was more emotionally intense; the heroine, lame for twenty-four years, experiences a brief, tragic passion for a man whose love is pledged elsewhere. There is lack of those elements of comedy that lighten 68 THE NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS the lessons of The Newly-married Couple. To the earlier period of play writing belongs, also, Maria Stuart in Scotland, a brilliant retelling of the familiar romance but lacking dramatic situations at the close; Bjornson was always at his best in Scandinavian back¬ ground; nevertheless John Knox is a commanding personality in this play. In this time of mental con¬ flict between the ideal and the realities in life as they affected his development, he wrote that vigorous novel, The Fisher Maiden, with vivid characterization, and one of his most pictorial poems, The Young Viking. Truth is the demand of the dramatist, in every crisis in life, as depicted in his problem plays, from The Bankrupt to A Gauntlet. Wit'h skill he shows The King, thwarted in his high ideals and his love, trying to “serve the freedom of the spirit,” to be a true “citizen-king” but ending his life in despair be¬ cause of the deceit of others. The Bankrupt has a strong character in Berent, the lawyer; the “problem” centers about the merchant’s temptation to use the money of others. The Editor aroused much contro¬ versy, because it was claimed that Bjornson had here satirized a Swedish editor but the charge was un¬ founded; rather the editor and his victims, Halvadan and Harald, typify journalistic conditions in every land. Mr. Brandes suggests that the dramatist may have been modeling these two brothers from the older poet, BJORNSON: NORWEGIAN NOVELIST 69 Wergeland and himself, in their struggles to create love for truth and freedom. In Leonarda, with lyrical as well as dramatic qualities, Bjornson spoke a message of more tolerance and historical signifi¬ cance through three generations of Norwegian so¬ ciety. Two excellent translators of his plays have been Edwin Bjorkman and R. Farquharson Sharp ( see bibliography). By translation and inclusion in selected plays of merit from many languages, Beyond Human Control has become one of the most familiar of Bjornson’s so¬ cial dramas. It is one of the chosen plays in Chief Contemporary Dramatists, Series I, by Thomas H. Dickinson. There are two parts to this drama, with differing motifs — the first in chronology and most widely read and staged is Beyond Human Power (or Beyond Our Power: Over ALvne I, 1883) dealing with problems of religious faith and fanaticism; the second part ( Over AZvne II, 1895) treats of differences of opinion between labor and capital. The first part, a complete play, has been given throughout Europe and was performed in New York in 1902, with Mrs. Patrick Campbell in the leading role. The charac¬ ters are strongly balanced in interest; the wife of the self-sacrificing, impractical pastor, Clara Sang, is a masterly delineation of wifely loyalty and maternal responsibility. The Bishop is well drawn in antithesis THE NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS 70 to Pastor Sang. A Gauntlet created discussion in Norway because of its daring theme — the advocacy of the same standards of social purity for men and women. It is less effective dramatically but morally it is vigorous. Bjornson’s later work in drama includes such good reading-plays as Laboremus, Daglannet , and When the New Wine Blooms .9 As examples of literary work after the age of seventy, to which may be added the story, Mary,10 with emotional power, they stand as testimonials to the vigor, mental and spiritual, of this worthy “Viking” of our day. After he received the Nobel prize, in accord with the proviso of the Code of Statutes, he made a noteworthy address upon the theme, “Poetry As a Manifestation of the Sense of Vital Surplus.” His own vitality and zest in life never lapsed. He declared that the possession of a new pair of trousers in his old age gave him a sense of delight like that of a child and he would get up an hour earlier “to get full enjoyment of these clothes.” Edwin Bjorkman, one of the most intuitive of his many trans¬ lators, tells, in his Voices of Tomorrow 11 incidents in the later life of Bjornson that verify his childlike na¬ ture, combined with serious, passionate efforts for hu- 9 Translated by Lee M. Hollander, Poet Lore, 1911. 10 Translated by Mary Morison, 1910. 11 New York, 1913. BJORNSON: NORWEGIAN NOVELIST 71 man betterment. His wife, an actress by training, was his amanuensis and critic; between husband and wife existed a rare bond of sympathy: at formal dinners, and on social occasions of varied kinds, Bjornson in¬ sisted that his wife should sit at his right hand, in spite of other conventions. As writer, speaker, “lay preacher,” and civic adviser, Bjornson has an assured rank among “The Creative Spirits of the Nineteenth Century.” CHAPTER V GIOSUE CARDUCCI— ITALIAN POET “The prize of 1906 has been awarded: Carducci, Giosue, Professor in the History of Literature at the University of Bologna, born 1835, died February 16, 1907: “in consideration not only of his wide learning and critical re¬ search, but, in the first place, as homage to the plastic energy, the freshness of style, and the lyric strength that distinguish his poetry.” 1 In 1906, when he was seventy years old, Giouse Carducci, the greatest of living Italian poets of that time, for more than two score years professor at the University of Bologna, was announced the winner of the Nobel prize in literature. As in the case of Mistral, the choice had fallen upon a poet of patriotic influence, although the Italian was far more inde¬ pendent in spirit, with less sentimental devotion to his country. At different periods he had been a critic of both the Liberal and the Monarchial parties; some¬ times he had seemed to be vacillating in his political convictions but he had always been an ardent patriot for Italy of the past, with hopes for a future of greater freedom and world influence. 1 Inscription with the Nobel Prize Award in Literature, 1907. 72 GIOSUE "
