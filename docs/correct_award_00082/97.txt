Life and Career

He was also a prolific translator, and his translations of Italian literature into German helped to popularize the works of Dante, Petrarch, and other Italian writers in Germany.

Heyse was also interested in the theater, and he wrote several plays throughout his career. Despite his success as a writer, Heyse also worked as a professor of Romance languages at the University of Berlin for many years, and he was a respected scholar in his field. He was later appointed to the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts in recognition of his contributions to literature and culture. He died on 2 April 1914, in Munich, German Empire.
