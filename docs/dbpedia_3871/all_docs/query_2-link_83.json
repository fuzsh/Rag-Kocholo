        "text": "June 24, 2001\n\nBy ROBERT MESSENGER\n\nLIBRARIES IN THE ANCIENT WORLD\n\nBy Lionel Casson.\n\nYale University, $22.95.\n\nn 642, when Islamic armies captured Alexandria, a Greek scholar asked the commanding general if he might take possession of the famous library. The request was referred up the chain of command to the Caliph Omar, who replied, ''If these writings of the Greeks agree with the book of God, they are useless and need not be preserved; if they disagree, they are pernicious and ought to be destroyed.'' The library's consignment to the flames gave the city's baths fuel for six months. The classicist Lionel Casson tells this anecdote in his charming and brief narrative history of the birth (and deaths) of libraries in the ancient world. The first really big and well organized library, Casson tells us, was Ashurbanipal's royal library in Nineveh, from whose ruins we got the epic of Gilgamesh. Casson takes the story all the way through the creation of the great Christian libraries at the monasteries of Monte Cassino and Vivarium. Along the way, he discourses on all sorts of topics: the discovery of papyrus and parchment, the shelving methods devised in Alexandria, the first bookshops, the separate storing of Greek and Latin books in Rome, even Marcus Aurelius' borrowing privileges. Casson often pushes on too quickly, leaving the reader to scrounge in the notes for more books to read about Callimachus, Eratosthenes of Cyrene, Cassiodorus, how Christianity threatened literature, and so on. This is, of course, why we have libraries."
