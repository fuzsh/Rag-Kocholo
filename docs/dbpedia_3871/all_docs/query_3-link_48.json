        "text": "20 Dec 2023 19:38\n\nI couldn't have been more than nine or ten when I started reading books about Greek mythology. At about the same age I first read Mary Renault's The Lion in the Gateway; the agonies that followed on the realization that one set of my ancestors were the Bactrians in Xerxes's army may easily be imagined. Add to this a mother educated at a pukka lyceo classico and high-school and college Latin (begun because, as the principal told me at the time, \"It was thought you would do better in a language you didn't have to speak\") and you have the makings of a life-long interest in dead Mediterranean languages with lots of declensions and their speakers.\n\nSee also:\n\nAlexander the Great\n\nAncient metallurgy\n\nAncient trade\n\nDemocracy\n\nEmpires and Imperialism\n\nEpicureanism\n\nthe Etruscans\n\nImport of Eastern religions to Europe\n\nIonia\n\nthe Late Bronze Age Collapse\n\nLucretius\n\nMyths\n\nPhoenicians\n\nPlato\n\nKarl Popper\n\nProto-industrialism\n\nReception and Appropriations of Classical Culture\n\nRepublics\n\nRome\n\nRecommended, big-picture:\n\nWalter Burkert, Orientalizing Revolution: Near Eastern Influence on Greek Culture in the Early Archaic Age [How the Greeks became civilized]\n\nM.
