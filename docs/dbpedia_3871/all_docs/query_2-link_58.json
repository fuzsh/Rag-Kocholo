It was a name for someone who lived in Gascoigne.\n\nJohn de Caleto or Caux (d. 1263), Treasurer of England, was \"probably a native of the Pays de Caux. By Matthew Paris he is called John of Caen (Johannes de Cadamo), and other writers give his cognomen in the various forms De Calceto, De Cauz, De Cauaz, De Caus, and De Chauce. The Peterborough chronicler, Walter of Whittlesea, who wrote in the fourteenth century, states that he was born in Normandy, of a noble family, being related to Eleanor of Provence, the queen of Henry III, and entered the monastic life when a child seven years of age. Coming over to England at an early age, he became a monk of the monastery of St. Swithhun, Winchester, of which he was chosen prior in 1247.\" 1\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Casson family\n\nThe surname Casson was first found in Gascony (French: Gascogne), an area of southwest France bordering Spain, that was part of the \"Province of Guyenne and Gascony\" prior to the French Revolution, where the family held a family seat in ancient times.\n\nAntoine Casse, born in 1639, son of Noel and Michelle of St.Pierre, travelled from France to Canada in the 17th century.
