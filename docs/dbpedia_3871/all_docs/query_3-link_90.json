J. and E. Hall, Dartford, and in 1912 became assistant engineer in charge of Physical Experimental Work at the Royal Aircraft Factory, South Farnborough. It was in this capacity that he devised several valuable improvements in the mechanism of aeroplanes and the disposition of their parts tending to complete stability without material loss of efficiency.\n\nBy the autumn of 1913 he had carried his researches so far that any aeroplane built to his design would give such a result, and in November 1913 was for the first tune [sic, time] able to snake [sic, make] uncontrolled flights of several hours' duration in winds up to thirty-eight miles an hour. On one occasion Colonel Seely, the then Secretary of State for War, was his passenger, and he later made demonstration flights before the King and Queen. After flying with Colonel Sykes, the Commanding Officer of the Royal Flying Corps, from the Royal Aircraft Factory, Farnborough, to Salisbury Plain and back, both passenger and flyer leaving the aeroplane to control itself whilst they wrote notes throughout the journey, he persuaded the authorities to take the matter up as having been tested and demonstrated in practical form.\n\nMr. Busk was flying his own stable aeroplane at Aldershot, when, on 5th November 1914, it caught fire in the air, causing his death, in his twenty-ninth year.\n\nHe had in 1911 received a Commission as 2nd Lieutenant in the London Electrical Engineers, Territorials.\n\nHe was elected an Associate Member of this Institution in 1914.\n\nMember 1900.\n\nEngineer, HMS ''Lion''.\n\nEngineer Captain, HMS ''Tiger''.\n\nKilled during the Battle of Dogger Bank.\n\n1915 Obituary\n\nEngineer-Captain CHARLES GERALD TAYLOR, M.V.O., R.N., was born at Ruabon, North Wales, on 8th May 1863.\n\nHe was educated at the Grammar School at Ruabon, after which he went to Portsmouth Dockyard as engineer student in H.M.S. \"Marlborough\" from 1879 to 1885.

It was mobilized almost immediately, and proceeded to Belgium with the Seventh Division at the beginning of October 1914. Mr. Cunningham went with his regiment and served through the severe fighting in the neighbourhood of Ypres in October and November 1914. During the great attack on the enemy's positions in the West in September 1915, he was one of four men selected by his officer to carry out a dangerous patrol; all the men's horses were shot, and he and another man were wounded.\n\nHe died at the Australian Hospital, Wimereux, near Boulogne, on 1st October 1915, in his twenty-ninth year.\n\nHe was elected a Graduate of this Institution in 1907, and was part author of a Paper on the Endurance of Metals, published in the Proceedings in December 1911.\n\nGraduate 1902; Associate Member 1911.\n\nLecturer/Demonstrator in Engineering, University College Nottingham.\n\nLieutenant, Duke of Wellington’s West Ridings Regiment, 3rd Battalion and 9th Battalion (Reserve of Officers).\n\nKilled in action, France.\n\n1916 Obituary\n\nLieutenant WILLIAM INCHLEY was born at Nottingham on 24th November 1883.\n\nHe was educated at All Saints' School, Nottingham, and at University College, Nottingham, where he entered as a Bursar, attended a three years' day course in Engineering, and gained the Associateship of the College in 1901.

Thornhill on the Chester—Holyhead widening scheme of the London and North Western Railway.\n\nAfter an illness of some months' duration, he returned to Messrs. Beloe and Priest in 1899, by whom he was engaged as chief assistant, and in the following year he acted for the same firm as resident engineer on the construction of Bebington Sewage Works.\n\nOn the completion of this work in the following year he became resident engineer for Arrol's Bridge and Roof Co. on the construction of the transporter bridge over the River Mersey between Widnes and Runcorn.\n\nSubsequently he acted in a similar capacity on the Talgarth District Waterworks, Brecon, the Ashton swing bridge at Bristol, and the Gosport Waterworks aqueduct, etc.\n\nIn March 1915 he received a Commission as Captain (temporary) in the Royal Engineers, after training at Longmoor Camp, Aldershot, and from there he was transferred to the War Office, soon after being promoted to Staff Captain. Owing to the arduous nature of the work, which entailed the supervision of vessels constructed for the purpose of filtration and purification of water for the troops abroad, his health broke down, and phthisis developed.\n\nHe was removed to Trearddur Bay, near Holyhead, and afterwards to West Kirby, Cheshire, where his death took place on 21st March 1916, in his thirty-ninth year.\n\nHe was elected an Associate Member of this Institution in 1903, and was transferred to, full Membership in 1915; he was also an Associate Member of the Institution of Civil Engineers, and a Member of the Liverpool Engineering Society.\n\nMember 1898; voted to Council 1905; Vice-President 1910; President 1913-1914.\n\nDirector-General, Royal Ordnance Factories, Royal Arsenal (became Chief Technical Adviser to the Ministry of Munitions, Sep 1915).\n\nBrigadier General, General Staff, Chief Superintendent Ordnance Factories.\n\nKilled on HMS ''Hampshire'' en-route to Russia with Lord Kitchener.\n\n1916 Obituary\n\nSir HAY FREDERICK DONALDSON, K.C.B., the second son of Sir Stuart A. Donaldson, the first Premier of New South Wales, was born at Sydney on 7th June 1856.\n\nHe was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, afterwards receiving technical training at the University of Edinburgh.\n\nFrom 1875 to 1877 he served an apprenticeship at the London and North Western Railway Works, Crewe, under the late Mr. F. W. Webb, and afterwards received further technical training, from 1877 to 1879, at Zurich and at Cambridge.\n\nIn 1880 he was employed on Parliamentary work and as engineer in charge of the construction of the Burnley tramways, and in September of the following year was appointed one of the assistant engineers, and shortly after an executive engineer, on the West of India Portuguese Railway and Harbour. During a part of his service here he was in charge of the harbour works at Goa.\n\nIn 1887 he returned to England, and was soon appointed by the late Mr. Thomas A. Walker engineer in charge of No. 1 section of the Manchester Ship Canal, which work involved the construction of entrance locks, estuary banks and heavy piling work.\n\nAfter leaving the Manchester Ship Canal, he was engaged in 1891-2 in private engineering practice, and on 1st January 1893 was appointed Engineer-in-Chief of the London and India Docks Joint Committee, a position which he held until 31st December 1897, when he received the appointment of Deputy Director-General of Ordnance Factories, Woolwich, under the late Sir William Anderson.\n\nSir William Anderson died in 1898, and during the illness preceding his decease, and after his death, Mr. Donaldson, as he then was, was temporarily in charge of the Royal Ordnance Factories, and in 1899 was appointed Chief Mechanical Engineer.\n\nIn 1903, on the retirement of Sir E. Bainbridge, he became Chief Superintendent of the Royal Ordnance Factories. The heavy responsible work, much of it carried on under very trying conditions, greatly taxed his health and strength, added to which were the great demands for guns and munitions for the present War. For his services he received the honour of Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1910, which was followed by that of K.C.B. in 1911.\n\nIn September 1915, at the request of Mr. Lloyd George, he temporarily gave up his position at Woolwich in order to act as Technical Adviser at the Ministry of Munitions, and he frequently accompanied the Minister of Munitions on his visits to the chief industrial centres throughout the country; in the autumn he also visited Canada and the United States.\n\nIt was as a representative of the Ministry of Munitions that Sir Frederick Donaldson, in company with Mr. Leslie S. Robertson, became a member of the staff of Lord Kitchener on the visit to Russia, whose tragic deaths took place on 5th June 1916 by the sinking of H.M.S. \"Hampshire\" off the Orkney Islands. Sir Frederick was then nearly sixty years of age. For the purposes of this visit the War Office granted him the relative precedence of a Brigadier-General.\n\nSir Frederick took an active interest in the work of this Institution, of which he was elected a Member in 1898. He joined the Council in 1905, was a Vice-President in 1910, and occupied the Presidential Chair in 1913-14. During the first year of his Presidency the Institution held its Summer Meeting at Cambridge. This was the first time such a Meeting had been held at one of the older University towns, and, thanks to the admirable arrangements largely organized by the President and his late brother, the Rev. S. A. Donaldson, D.D., then Master of Magdalene and Vice-Chancellor of the University, the Meeting was a great success. At the Summer Meeting in Paris in 1914, about a month before the War broke out, he was at the last moment prevented from attending, owing to urgent matters at Woolwich.\n\nHe read a Paper before the Institution in 1903, on \"Cutting Angles of Tools,\" and gave an instructive Lecture to the Graduates in 1909, on \"The Interchangeability of Screw-Threads.\"\n\nHe took a most active part in developing the system of examination for Graduates and Associate Members, and made most earnest appeals to the members for establishing on a financial basis the Benevolent Fund of the Institution. He was a Member of Council of the Institution of Civil Engineers, and did excellent work in connection with the Engineering Standards Committee, both as a member of the Main Committee and as Chairman of the Sectional Committee on Screw-Threads and Limit-Gauges.\n\nMember 1892, proposed by John Isaac Thornycroft.\n\nSecretary of the Engineering Standards Committee.\n\nGeneral Staff, Director of Production at the Ministry of Munitions.\n\nKilled on HMS ''Hampshire'' en-route to Russia with Lord Kitchener.\n\nNote: birth surname Robinson, he used Robertson.\n\n1916 Obituary\n\nLESLIE STEPHEN ROBERTSON (formerly ROBINSON) was born at Kotagherry, India, on 4th October 1863, being the youngest son of Sir William R. Robinson, K.C.S.I., sometime Governor of the Presidency of Madras.\n\nHe was educated in Germany and at King's College, London, and acquired his scientific training at University College, London, under Sir Alexander B. W. Kennedy (then Professor Kennedy) from 1883 to 1885. He was one of the organizers and the first Secretary of the University College Engineering Society.\n\nHe next served two years at the works of Messrs. Denny and Co., of Dumbarton, and from 1887 to 1889 was in the drawing-office of the firm, being later appointed to superintend the Experimental Testing Department.\n\nAfter some experience at sea as engineer on board the R.M.S. \"Jumna,\" he entered the drawing-office of Messrs. John I. Thornycroft and Co., at Chiswick. For a time he acted as works manager until he was put in charge of a large contract for the French Government at the works of the Societe Anonyme des Forges et Chantiers de la Meditermnee, at Havre. On the completion of this work he visited the United States and Cuba.\n\nIn 1892 he commenced private practice as a consulting engineer in Westminster, and six years later was joined by Mr. F. D. Outram, late R.E. Until 1898 he represented Messrs. Normand, of Havre, and had charge of their work in this country. He also acted as Secretary of the first section of the International Railway Congress held at the Imperial Institute, and accompanied the Commission on Light Railways appointed by the Cape Government.\n\nMr. Robertson contributed two Papers to this Institution, one in 1897 on \"Mechanical Propulsion on Canals\" and the other in 1898 on \"Narrow-Gauge Railways.\" Amongst other literary work he translated and edited the English edition of M. Bertin's treatise on \"Marine Boilers,\" and delivered a course of lectures on \"Water Tube Boilers\" at University College, London.\n\nIn 1901 he was appointed Secretary of the Engineering Standards Committee, and he was thus brought into contact with every British engineer of eminence.\n\nIn July 1915, with the permission of that Committee, lie was appointed assistant to the Director of Production at the Ministry of Munitions, and in this position he was concerned with organizing the production of the metal components of gun-ammunition. His knowledge of the engineering capacity of the workshops of Great Britain was invaluable in the important negotiations leading to the enormous increase in the output of munitions that has been accomplished.\n\nIt was in this connection that he became a member of Lord Kitchener's staff on the visit to Russia, and lost his life on 5th June 1916, in his fifty-third year, by the sinking of H.M.S. \"Hampshire\" off the Orkney Islands.

Owing to illness he took an aegrotat degree in the first part of the Mathematical Tripos of 1895 but in the following year he obtained a first class in the first division of Part II. He then read for the Bar and was called in 1897.\n\nAfter the death of his father, through the tragic accident in Switzerland in 1898, which occurred while Bertram was on his way to Australia on legal business, he determined to give up his career at the Bar and to take up engineering to conserve his father's large practice as a consulting engineer, and joined his uncle Mr. Charles Hopkinson, M.I.Mech.E., and the late Mr. E. Talbot, a former assistant of Dr. John Hopkinson, as a partner in the firm of Hopkinsons and Talbot, of London and Manchester.\n\nDuring his five years association with the firm he was jointly responsible for the electrification and extension of the Newcastle-on-Tyne Tramway system, described in a Paper before the Inst.C.E., and of the Leeds Tramway system; and also advised upon or carried out electric lighting or tramway schemes for the Corporations of Salford, Stockport, and Crewe, and the District Councils of Sale, Hindley, and Ambleside. During this time he was also frequently engaged as an expert in patent cases in the Law Courts. The position he attained in work of this character was recognized in later life by his frequently acting as assessor to the Judge in technical cases.\n\nIn 1903 Professor Ewing (now Sir J. Alfred Ewing, K.C.B.) retired from the Chair of Mechanism and Applied Mechanics in the University of Cambridge, and Bertram Hopkinson was appointed his successor, and held the Chair until his death. Under his guidance the Cambridge School of Engineering grew in numbers and prospered, and greatly extended its influence and repute, particularly as a home of advanced research. Professor Hopkinson was himself devoted to research and inspired his students with something of his own enthusiasm and originality, many of whom subsequently came to occupy positions of importance and responsibility in engineering industries.\n\nHis researches were very varied in character, and the papers he communicated to scientific societies and the technical institutions very numerous. They were all characterized by great originality, refusal to be bound by traditional methods and doctrines, directness of attack and a singular appreciation of the essential points involved.\n\nHe contributed to this Institution a series of Papers on \"Indicated Power and Mechanical Efficiency of Gas-Engines,\" 1907; \"Effect of Mixture Strength and Scavenging upon Thermal Efficiency,\" 1908; \"Cooling of Gas Engines,\" 1913, and was awarded the Willans Premium for the first two of these.\n\nProfessor Hopkinson was co-inventor of the Hopkinson-Tring torsion meter, now largely used for measuring the shaft power of turbine-driven ships.\n\nOn the outbreak of war he threw himself unreservedly into the National Service, disregarding all other interests which would interfere therewith. He was then a Major of the O.T.C. at Cambridge.\n\nFirst he took up R.E. work at Chatham, but a little later became attached to the Admiralty, where his work on explosions found full application and enabled him to undertake further work of great national importance. Afterwards he directed his attention to the equipment of air-craft, and was appointed to positions of successively increasing importance in connexion with the control of experimental work, at first with the War Office and then with the Air Ministry, where he became Deputy Director of Air-Craft Equipment. Here again his knowledge of internal-combustion engines and explosives, and originality of conception, were of the greatest value to the Nation. To quote from a letter of condolence to the University of Cambridge written by command of the Air Council, they place \"on record their deep sense of the high and permanent value of the work done for the Flying Force by the late Colonel Hopkinson, and their recognition of the patriotic self-abnegation with which he devoted his great abilities and scientific attainments to the Public Service.\"\n\nHe was made a Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George in 1917. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society and held a professorial fellowship at King's College, Cambridge. He became a Member of this Institution in 1904; he had served on the Council of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, and was a Member of the Council of the Royal Society, and of the Institution of Civil Engineers at the time of his death, and was an original member of the Advisory Council for Scientific and Industrial Research appointed by the Privy Council.\n\nColonel Hopkinson was killed in an accident whilst flying in England on military duty on 26th August 1918, at the age of forty-four.\n\nGraduate 1912; Associate Member 1918.\n\nAssistant Locomotive Superintendent, Central Argentine Railway,\n\nCaptain, 50th and Lieutenant, 112 Squadron, Royal Air Force.
