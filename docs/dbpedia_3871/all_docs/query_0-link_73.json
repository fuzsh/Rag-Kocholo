Kaster is a professor of classics and Kennedy Foundation Professor of Latin at Princeton University. His teaching and scholarly interests are focused largely in the areas of Roman rhetoric, Roman ethics, and the history of ancient education, noted a biographer on the Princeton University Web site. He has taught graduate and undergraduate classes on a wide variety of classical subjects, including Roman comedy; Roman letters; the book in Roman society and culture; invective, slander, and insult in Latin literature; and Rape and Roman Rhetoric. He has also taught widely on ancient writers and personalities, such as Caesar, Cicero, Catullus, Euripides, Sophocles, Virgil, Tacitus, and Thucydides. A prolific writer and academic, he has contributed dozens of articles to scholarly journals and associated publications, and has presented numerous papers and lectures at conferences and symposia. Kaster is the recipient of fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Fund.\n\nGuardians of Language: The Grammarian and Society in Late Antiquity is a \"multifaceted survey of the professional world of the Roman grammarians,\" noted James Galbraith, writing in Libraries & Culture. Kaster relates how grammarians of the time were responsible for teaching children the basics of Latin grammar. In addition, they were also required to be vigilant in protecting the Latin language from drift and corruption. Despite their role in conveying and protecting the language that connected citizens in ancient antiquity, they were not largely heralded by contemporary writers, and have not been thoroughly considered in academic works to date. Kaster notes the discrepancy between the roles played by the ancient grammarians, how their relatively meager standing in the social and political arenas of the day is not commensurate with the vitally important role they played in the educational system that catered to the elite members of society. Kaster observes that ancient grammarians found their source of power in their influence and control over the Latin language. Galbraith concluded, \"Guardians of Language is well written and fascinating, but it is also a challenging book that assumes a classical background.\" However, Galbraith also noted that nonclassicists would still be able to derive a great deal of worthwhile information from the book, observing, \"There is much to be gleaned even if one tends to glaze over during the Latin passages.\"\n\nKaster explores the emotional life of ancient Romans in Emotion, Restraint, and Community in Ancient Rome. Here, he addresses milder, socially useful and applicable emotional states that ameliorate problems, undo \"offenses and thereby aid the smooth coexistence of people in society,\" commented Lionel Casson in a Historian review. Kaster considers five major emotional conditions identified by their Latin names: verecundia, pudor, paenitentia, invidia, and fastidium. Each is carefully considered in a separate chapter. Verecundia concerns the individual regard for reputation of self and others; pudor expands on this concept of verecundia, but is interpreted as widely as the modern word \"shame,\" Casson reported. Paenitentia concerns regret at a material or ethical shortcoming or shortfall; Invidia corresponds to modern concepts of envy and resentment; and fastidium covers the gamut of sights, sounds, and concepts that produce disgust or aversion, from mild to extreme. Kaster considers how these emotional concepts were formed in Roman times, how these emotions affected interactions among Romans, and what they meant to Roman society at large. Throughout the book, Kaster's \"presentation is densely textured but clear and often brightened by modern examples, in colorful vernacular,\" stated Casson, who concluded: \"Translators, historians, commentators, and others who deal with Latin texts will find the book a most useful guide\" to emotional behavior and its connection to society in ancient Rome.\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nAmerican Historical Review, February, 1990, Sabine MacCormack, review of Guardians of Language: The Grammarian and Society in Late Antiquity, p. 145.\n\nAmerican Journal of Philology, spring, 2007, Peter Toohey, review of Emotion, Restraint, and Community in Ancient Rome, p. 137.\n\nChoice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries, May, 2006, L.M.
