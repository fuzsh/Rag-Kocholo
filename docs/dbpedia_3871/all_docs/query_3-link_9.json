        "text": "Casson History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nFrance\n\nIreland\n\nThe vast movement of people that followed the Norman Conquest of England in 1066 brought the Casson family name to the British Isles. Casson comes from de Cassagne, the name of the House of the Lords of Montagu, who were a family of distinction from the province of Bearne, France. 1\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Casson family\n\nThe surname Casson was first found in Hampshire, where a Ralph Cattessone was on record in 1115. Other early records include Robert Casseson in 1327 in the Subsidy Rolls of Cambridgeshire, John Catessone, on record in the Feet of Fines of Suffolk in 1366, and William Casson in the Register of the Freemen of the City of York in 1601. 2\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Casson family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Casson research. Another 62 words (4 lines of text) covering the years 1789, 1815, 1820, 1821, 1829 and 1841 are included under the topic Early Casson History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nCasson Spelling Variations\n\nMultitudes of spelling variations are a hallmark of Anglo Norman names. Most of these names evolved in the 11th and 12th century, in the time after the Normans introduced their own Norman French language into a country where Old and Middle English had no spelling rules and the languages of the court were French and Latin. To make matters worse, medieval scribes spelled words according to sound, so names frequently appeared differently in the various documents in which they were recorded. The name was spelled Cassan, Cassane, Casson and others.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Casson family\n\nOutstanding amongst the family at this time was Stephen Hyde Cassan (1789-1841), English ecclesiastical biographer, son of Stephen Cassan, barrister, by his wife Sarah, daughter of Charles Mears, born in 1789 at Calcutta, where his father was sheriff. He was educated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, and took his B.A. degree on 14 Jan. 1815. He received deacon's orders on 26 March following, and was ordained priest the next year. While curate of Frome...\n\nAnother 72 words (5 lines of text) are included under the topic Early Casson Notables in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nCasson Ranking\n\nIn the United States, the name Casson is the 11,905th most popular surname with an estimated 2,487 people with that name. 3\n\nMigration of the Casson family to Ireland\n\nSome of the Casson family moved to Ireland, but this topic is not covered in this excerpt. More information about their life in Ireland is included in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nCasson migration to the United States +\n\nBecause of this political and religious unrest within English society, many people decided to immigrate to the colonies. Families left for Ireland, North America, and Australia in enormous numbers, traveling at high cost in extremely inhospitable conditions. The New World in particular was a desirable destination, but the long voyage caused many to arrive sick and starving. Those who made it, though, were welcomed by opportunities far greater than they had known at home in England. Many of these families went on to make important contributions to the emerging nations of Canada and the United States. Analysis of immigration records indicates that some of the first North American immigrants bore the name Casson or a variant listed above:\n\nCasson Settlers in United States in the 17th Century\n\nTho Casson, who landed in Virginia in 1635 4\n\nAnn Casson, who arrived in Virginia in 1643 4\n\nCasson Settlers in United States in the 19th Century\n\nHenry Casson, who landed in Savanna(h), Georgia in 1848 4\n\nS P Casson, who arrived in San Francisco, California in 1851 4\n\nJohn Casson, who arrived in Allegany (Allegheny) County, Pennsylvania in 1865 4\n\nA.

They made many attempts but failed in some to establish settlements on the Islands including Saint Lucia and Grenada. By 1627 they had managed to establish settlements on St. Kitts (St. Christopher) and Barbados, but by 1641 the Spanish had moved in and destroyed some of these including those at Providence Island. The British continued to expand the settlements including setting the First Federation in the British West Indies by 1674; some of the islands include Barbados, Bermuda, Cayman Island, Turks and Caicos, Jamaica and Belize then known as British Honduras. By the 1960's many of the islands became independent after the West Indies Federation which existed from 1958 to 1962 failed due to internal political conflicts. After this a number of Eastern Caribbean islands formed a free association. 7\n\nCasson Settlers in West Indies in the 17th Century\n\nMr. John Casson, (b. 1617), aged 18, British settler travelling aboard the ship \"The Dorset\" arriving in Barbados in September 1635 8\n\nContemporary Notables of the name Casson (post 1700) +\n\nAnn Casson (1915-1990), English stage and film actress, daughter of Sir Lewis Casson\n\nChristopher Casson (1912-1996), English-born, Irish actor\n\nTom Casson (b. 1990), English rugby union player\n\nSir Lewis Casson MC (1875-1969), English actor-manager and producer, husband of actress Dame Sybil Thorndike\n\nSir Hugh Maxwell Casson (1910-1999), English architect, interior designer, artist, writer and broadcaster, perhaps best known as director of architecture at the 1951 Festival of Britain on London's South Bank\n\nJennifer Casson (1995-2024), Canadian rower at the 2024 Summer Olympics from Kingston, Ontario\n\nMrs. Joan Casson, born in Widnes, British councillor, held the position of Sheriff of Nottingham, England from 2001 2002\n\nMs. Dinah Victoria Casson C.B.E., British Co-founder for Casson Mann, appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire on 8th June 2018, for services to Design 9\n\nHenry Casson, American politician, Secretary of State of Wisconsin (1895-1899)\n\nMargaret Casson (1913-1999), Lady Casson South African-born architect, designer and photographer, wife of architect Sir Hugh Casson\n\n...

Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.\n\nMotto: Prosequor alis\n\nMotto Translation: I follow with speed.\n\nCitations +\n\nLower, Mark Anthony, Patronymica Britannica, A Dictionary of Family Names of the United Kingdom.
