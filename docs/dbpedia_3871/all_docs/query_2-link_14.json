        "text": "The Land of Punt was a major civilization in the ancient world. Located to the south and east of the Nile Valley, it was Dynastic Egypt’s main trading partner and the source of much of the frankincense, myrrh and other coveted products that were used by the Pharaohs in their traditional rituals and ceremonies. According to the Egyptian First Dynasty rulers or Horus-Kings, Punt (Ta netjer or “God’s Land”) was also their ancestral homeland.\n\nGiven its historical importance, Egyptologists have long debated just where exactly this mysterious territory was situated. The riddle appeared to have been finally solved in 2010, when preliminary isotopic analysis narrowed down the prospective locations to present-day Eritrea. However, follow-up isotopic work as well as DNA studies conducted since then, analysis of clay from pots that were brought to Egypt from Punt, and little-known botanical evidence and epigraphs firmly locate the ancient land in a broader region stretching from northern Somalia, Djibouti and the Eritrea/Ethiopia corridor to northeastern Sudan. The recent discovery of the first actual Puntite artifacts and their similarity to those of ancient Egypt has, in particular, confirmed the close ties between both areas.\n\nRoute to Punt\n\nOne of the key factors in pinpointing the location of the Land of Punt is its geographical proximity to ancient Egypt. In this regard, scholars have often indicated that the territory was situated to the south and east. But what exactly do they base this on?\n\nIn the 1850s, the Antiquities Service of Egypt discovered hieroglyphic texts in the vicinity of Thebes (Luxor) in Upper Egypt. These inscriptions identify Punt as a source of aromatics found to the east of Egypt. This, in turn, would prompt the Egyptologist Heinrich Karl Brugsch to postulate that the ancient land was located in the Arabian peninsula. A few years later, his colleague the archaeologist Auguste Mariette came upon geographical lists at the Karnak Temple, which had been left by the Pharaoh Thutmose III of the Eighteenth Dynasty (r. 1458–1425 BCE). These hieroglyphics include Punt among the territories that lay to the south of Egypt. The Egyptologist Abdel Monem A. H. Sayed explains:\n\nThe first lists of this kind, and the most comprehensive, are those of Thutmoses III, where the regional and site names are arranged in a manner coinciding with their geographical locations.\n\nThe list of toponyms of the African side of the Red Sea begins with the heading Kush, the Egyptian name for Upper Nubia. Under this heading are recorded 22 toponyms. Then comes the regional name Wawat or Lower Nubia, with 24 toponyms listed under it. After that, the list begins again from the south, recording regional and site names closer to the Red Sea shore. The regional name Punt is mentioned as a heading for 30 toponyms. After Punt comes Mejay as a heading of 17 toponyms. Lastly comes the regional name Khaskhet extending along the Red Sea shore of Egypt, with 22 toponyms listed (Schiaparelli 1916, 115-9).\n\nThis clear hieroglyphic account allows the following important deductions[…] The relation between Punt and the other regional names in the list (Kush, Wawat, Mejay and some of the toponyms under the heading Khaskhet), of which the African locations are agreed among Egyptologists, shows clearly that in the time of Thutmoses III Punt was the most southerly region and adjacent to the Red Sea coast. This is of great value for locating Punt during the New Kingdom in general, and the time of Queen Hatshepsut in particular, with which I deal later.\n\nA 26th Dynasty stela was also recovered from the ancient site of Dafnah (Daphnae) near the Egyptian Delta, which contains an inscription stating that “when rain falls on the mountain of Punt, the Nile floods.” This is a clear allusion to the northern Ethiopian highlands, around Lake Tana where the Blue Nile rises (cf. Sayed (1989)). The Papyrus of Hunefer, a 19th Dynasty document by an Egyptian royal scribe, strengthens this association, for it too includes the Blue Nile within the confines of Punt. Van Auken (2011) notes:\n\nThe Greek historian Herodotus wrote, “Egypt was the gift of the Nile.” Three tributaries created this amazing river. The first is the White Nile, a long gentle river flowing from Lake Victoria — a high mountain lake bordered by Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. This tributary joins with the shorter but more voluminous and nutrient-richer Blue Nile, springing from Lake Tana in Ethiopia. And in ancient times, a third tributary joined these two, the Yellow Nile flowing from the eastern highlands of Chad. The Yellow Nile is now dry but was once a part of this trinity of rivers creating the ancient Nile.\n\nEach year during the rainy season, the ancient Nile River would overflow its banks and inundate Egypt; as it retreated, it left behind nutrient-rich black silt that made Egypt one of the most fertile lands in recorded history. Today, two dams now control the Nile — there is no flooding and no rich silt fertilizer.\n\nAround this river of life-giving water grew one of the greatest cultures on the planet. The ancient Egyptians called the river Iteru, meaning “Great River”; the modern name comes from the Greek Neilos (Nilus in Latin), transliterated to Nile.\n\nThe Edfu Text, found in the Horus Temple in Edfu, and the Papyrus of Hunefer tell the story of a “hill people” who became the first settlers of this region. “We came from the beginning of the Nile where god Hapi dwells at the foothills of the Mountains of the Moon.” The Mountains of the Moon are likely those that contain Lake Tana in ancient Abyssinia (modern day Ethiopia), the origin of the Blue Nile. This name may be traced back to a Greek ruler of late Egypt, Ptolemy, and the use of the name “Mountains of Selene,” the moon goddess of the Greeks.\n\nCoupled with some of the floral and faunal evidence discussed below, Mariette’s discovery and the Dafnah tablet helped shift scholarly opinion as to where Punt was situated (including eventually that of Brugsch himself) away from a hypothesized Arabian location to the adjacent Horn of Africa.\n\nCozzolino (1993) enumerates over 50 other hieroglyphic inscriptions relating to the Land of Punt, and a few additional engravings have subsequently been discovered. The earliest of these writings is the Palermo Stone. It informs us that an ancient Egyptian expedition to Punt brought back 80,000 measures of ‘ntiyw (a particular type of incense), among other items, during the thirteenth regnal year of Sahure (ca. 2445 BCE), the second Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom’s Fifth Dynasty. Unfortunately, the Palermo Stone does not specify where Punt itself was located. We do, however, have an idea of how Sahure’s men got there. In 2002, an inscribed block was found at the pyramid of Sahure in the Abusir necropolis, with two of its registers depicting the arrival of ancient Egyptian cargo vessels transporting goods from Punt. From this, we know that the Sahure expedition was carried out by sea rather than overland. Punt was therefore not a landlocked territory.\n\nA Sixth Dynasty inscription provides an even clearer indication of the route that the ancient Egyptians took to get to Punt during the Old Kingdom. Phillips (1997) notes that Pharaoh Pepi II or Neferkare (2278/2269–2184/2175 BCE) dispatched one of his expedition leaders, Pepinakht, to retrieve the body of the official Anankhti, who had been killed by bedouins in the Eastern Desert (the “desert of the Asiatics”) while overseeing the construction of a ship intended for another commercial expedition to Punt. Thus, the particular water route that was favored by the ancient Egyptian rulers appears to have been via the Red Sea. This is confirmed by a later, Middle Kingdom rock inscription at Wadi Hammamat from the reign of Pharaoh Mentuhotep III or Senekhkere (r. 2004–1992 BCE) of the Eleventh Dynasty. According to the chief treasurer Henu, he was ordered by the king to build a vessel destined for Punt along the Red Sea littoral:\n\n[My lord, life, prosperity] health[…] sent me to dispatch a ship to Punt to bring for him fresh myrrh from the sheiks over the Red Land, by reason of the fear of him in the highlands. Then I went forth from Koptos upon the road, which his majesty commanded me…\n\nI went forth with an army of 3,000 men. I made the road a river, and the Red Land (desert) a stretch of field, for I gave a stretch of field, for I gave a leathern bottle, a carrying pole[…], 2 jars of water and 20 loaves to each one among them every day. The asses were laden with sandals[…]\n\nThen I reached the (Red) Sea; then I made this ship, and I dispatched it with everything, when I had made for it a great oblation of cattle, bulls and ibexes.\n\nNow, after my return from the (Red) Sea, I executed the command of his majesty, and I brought for him all the gifts, which I had found in the regions of God’s-Land. I returned through the ‘valley’ of Hammamat, I brought for him august blocks for statues belonging to the temple. Never was brought down the like thereof for the king’s court; never was done the like of this by any king’s-confidant sent out since the time of the god.\n\nIn 1971, the Egyptologist Kenneth Kitchen demonstrated the feasibility of such ancient travel down the Red Sea coast by charting an actual itinerary to get to Punt. This maritime gazetteer includes 80 possible anchorage points, as well as the intervening distances between them. It stretches from the Port of Sudan to northern Eritrea, a broad region that Kitchen suggests was coextensive with the Land of Punt.\n\nSo we know from the existing hieroglyphic texts that the ancient Egyptians preferred to reach Punt by water, and through the Red Sea specifically. We also know that this navigation was doable. The question is, what actual port did the ancient Egyptians use for these trading expeditions once they had finished constructing their vessels? A stela that was discovered at Wadi Gawasis (Wadi Gasus) provides an answer. Erected by Khentkhetwer, an official under the Twelfth Dynasty Pharaoh Amenemhet II or Nubkaure (r. 1922–1878 BCE), it contains an engraving that explicitly identifies Saww as the port where Khentkhetwer and his men arrived after their voyage to Punt. The Khentkhetwer stela inscription reads:\n\nGiving divine praise and laudation to Horus[…], to Min of Coptos, by the hereditary prince, count, wearer of the royal seal, the master of the judgement-hall Khentkhetwer[…] after his arrival in safety from Punt; his army being with him, prosperous and healthy and his ships having landed at Sewew (Saww). Year 28.\n\nIn 2004, archaeological excavations led by the Egyptologists Kathryn Bard and Rodolfo Fattovich at Mersa/Wadi Gawasis in Egypt identified this harbor as the old port of Saww, which the ancient Egyptians used during their expeditions to Punt. The excavators found a number of commodities at the site that may have been brought back from Punt, including fragments of carbonized ebony wood (Diospyros sp.) and obsidian. Since the latter volcanic glass does not occur naturally in Egypt, it was clearly imported from elsewhere. Lucarini et al. (2020) sought to identify the exact provenance of these artifacts, so they conducted a geochemical analysis comparing six obsidian fragments, which Sayed et al. had gathered from Mersa Gawasis some years prior, to those from various source areas in the Horn of Africa and Arabian peninsula (viz. sites in Eritrea, Ethiopia and Yemen). However, the scientists did not examine any obsidian culled from Djibouti or Somalia. Of the sites they did sample, Kusrale in Eritrea was found to be the most likely procurement location for five of the six analysed Mersa Gawasis obsidian artifacts. The other obsidian fragment appeared instead to have been obtained from the Dhamar Reda volcanic region in Yemen.\n\nMoreover, the archaeologists working at Mersa Gawasis also discovered actual shipbuilding materials dating to the Middle Kingdom, such as anchors, timbers and huge steering oars, as well as 26 well-preserved coils of vessel-rigging rope that were lying on the floors of a cave. Most intriguingly, they came upon 43 cargo boxes from the reign of Pharaoh Amenemhat IV (r. 1990–1800 BCE). Two of these boxes were engraved with a package label, which had been recorded by the scribe Djedy. It included inscriptions for his name, a cartouche of Amenemhat IV and regnal Year 8, and the phrase “wonderful things of Punt” in hieroglyphics. The cargo boxes were made of sycamore wood and were all empty since their contents, which are believed to have included frankincense, were apparently unloaded into containers or bags for later transport via caravan across the Eastern Desert. Additionally, Bard found a limestone stela with hieroglyphic text on it that commemorates two royal maritime expeditions to Punt and Bia-Punt (“Mine(s) of Punt”) during the reign of Pharaoh Amenemhet III (r. 1831–1786 BCE).\n\nResearchers exploring the ancient seafaring vessels at Wadi Gawasis would later find ceramic fragments inside. These sherds once formed pots, which were used to hold goods for transportation from Punt to Egypt. The scientists also analyzed the actual clay that was used to make this pottery. They discovered that it came from the eastern coast of Africa, further proving that this area was indeed part of the Land of Punt (Hoare (2020)). More specifically, of the main prospective locations for the ancient territory, this finding points to Djibouti, Eritrea and Somalia since Ethiopia is landlocked and Yemen is in the Arabian peninsula.\n\nThat the ancient Egyptians journeyed to and from Punt through a Red Sea route, and via the old port of Saww in particular, has thus been confirmed. What we shall now see is that the main landing point of these trading expeditions, at least during the New Kingdom, was in northern Somalia. As such, Punt was located in a more expansive area between Cape Guardafui and the Port of Sudan.\n\nFlora and fauna of Punt\n\nBesides the route taken to get there, another key aspect in situating the Land of Punt is the flora and fauna of the various proposed locations for the ancient territory. Specific plants and animals, which are said to have been native to Punt, are depicted on Egyptian temple walls and murals. Some of these “wonderful things of Punt” were also brought back to Egypt as gifts and offerings. Combined, this leaves us with invaluable information as to what kind of habitat the Puntites actually lived in.\n\nPlants\n\nIn 1858, Mariette discovered a wall in the funerary temple of the Pharaoh Hatshepsut (r. 1479–1458 BCE) at Deir el-Bahri, which depicts an Egyptian expedition to Punt during the queen’s reign. The temple reliefs show in detail the flora and fauna of Punt, as well as the Puntites themselves. Among the clearly identifiable plants are doum palms (Hyphaene thebaica), tree species that were regarded as sacred in ancient Egypt. Kitchen argues that on the Somali coast, the doum palm is restricted to the southernmost areas, far from the suggested Puntite nucleus in the north. In actuality, the doum palm grows throughout the Somali territories. The traditional gourd used by Somali pastoralists (who historically expanded from the north) is, in fact, crafted in part from doum palm fibers. Accordingly, the Plant Resources of Tropical Africa (PROTA) foundation describes the geographical distribution of Hyphaene thebaica as follows:\n\nHyphaene thebaica is distributed from Senegal and Gambia eastwards to Somalia, and is especially common between latitudes 8°N and 12°N. It also occurs in Libya, Egypt, Israel, the Arabian Peninsula and western India. Hyphaene thebaica is often planted. It was already cultivated in ancient Egypt, where it was considered sacred.\n\nOne of the main products that the ancient Egyptians traveled to Punt to obtain was ebony. Through hieroglyphic inscriptions, which indicate that the Egyptians themselves chopped down the plant while in Punt (“cutting ebony in great quantity”), ebony is known to have grown wild in the territory. The Puntites apparently did not import it from elsewhere for later resale to the Egyptians.\n\nBarnett (1999) notes that analyses of plant specimens found in tombs have confirmed that the particular variety of ebony that was used in ancient Egypt is Dalbergia melanoxylon. This species is endemic to Eritrea, Ethiopia and Sudan alike, according to PROTA. In Somalia, ebony today has a limited distribution. Archaeological evidence, however, suggests that the plant was more abundant there too in Pharaonic times. On this likelihood, Ahmed Ibrahim Awale, a scholar who recently led excavations in northern Somalia (more on that below under Traces of ancient civilization), writes:\n\n[Over] the past several millenia, so much has changed in the composition of vegetation in the Somali peninsula. The discovery of crocodile artifacts in Hargeisa valley suggest that a tropical riparian ecosystem existed in those areas. Therefore, it cannot be discounted that ebony, one of the chief exports from Punt, was sourced from the area. Diospyros spp., locally known as ‘Kolaati‘, is still found to a limited extent in riparian formations in Somalia.\n\nFrankincense Terraces of Punt\n\nOf all the items that were exported from the Land of Punt to ancient Egypt, frankincense was by far the most important. Sayed (1989) notes that the Deir el-Bahri murals record Pharaoh Hatshepsut as specifically commanding her party “to fetch (as the texts say) ‘fresh incense’, and ‘frankincense living trees’ from ‘the frankincense terraces of Punt’.” The main purpose of that Egyptian voyage to Punt — the largest sojourn of its kind to the ancient territory — was, therefore, to retrieve the prized aromatic resin. Indeed, the very reason why Hatshepsut organized such a massive expedition was because she wanted her men to bring back live frankincense trees for later transplantation in Egypt. Her temple reliefs show that each of the 31 heavy incense trees required 4 to 6 men to transport them to the cargo ships, or 124 to 186 Egyptian and Puntite carriers in total. Since there were around 150 crewmen on the expedition’s five vessels (30 per ship), this would mean that the “Frankincense Terraces of Punt” had to have been situated near the shore.\n\nSayed asserts that this incense-yielding locale, the “Frankincense Terraces of Punt,” was the northern Somali littoral. In particular, the northeastern section extending from Bandar Qasim to Alula. He bases this in part on historical texts, which hail this region as an early center of incense production and exportation. Chief among these old documents is the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (Periplus Maris Erythraei), a travelogue written in the 1st century CE by an Alexandrian merchant. It indicates that a top-grade libanos peratikos or “incense from beyond the straits” (Bab el-Mandeb straits) was exported from ancient city-states that dotted this part of the Red Sea area, including Avalites, Malao, Mundus (Moundou), Mossylum, the Market and Cape of Spices, Pano (Panon), Opone (Opun) and Akannai (see toponym map below, on the left). The Periplus specifies that the laurel-grove of Akannai/Acannae is “where alone is produced the far-side frankincense, in great quantity and of the best grade.” Likewise, the historian and philosopher Arrian of Nicomedia testifies that the best frankincense of his day was exported from the same area around Ras Fiel/Ras Filuk (Cape Elephant/Cape Elephas), just off the Acannae harbor in present-day Alula.\n\nIn fact, various scholars hold that the classical market-town of Opone (Opun), located on the Ras Hafun peninsula in northeastern Somalia, is the etymological source of the toponym Punt. In this regard, G. W. B. Huntingford (1950) writes that “the name of the next cape south of Guardafui, Hafun, has descended through the Greek form Opone, from the ancient Punt.” Neville Chittick (1975) similarly asserts that “the possible early date of this [Hafun West] site would accord well with the relationship between the name Opone (Hafun) and the name Punt (pronounced Pwene?) suggested by Lewicki (1969, p. 38) citing F. Storbeck.” (*N.B. Also refer to Doresse in Lacroix (1998). For additional details, see What is the etymology of the term “Punt”?.)\n\nAccording to Sayed, the ports of Malao, Mundus, Mosyllum and Akannai were the main hubs for incense exportation. He further notes that:\n\nComparing these locations with Hepper’s (op.cit. pl.XV) distribution of frankincense trees in north Somaliland today, we find an astonishingly close congruity. The areas where B. frereana (the best grade incense in Somaliland according to Hepper) grows [are] actually concentrated in those four locations, or at least — in the case of Malao — very near.\n\nSayed (1989) remarks that the ancient Egyptians imported two types of frankincense: a lower grade variety called sntr, and a higher grade variety known as ‘ntiyw or nty. According to inscriptions from the Sixth Dynasty travelers Harkhuf and Sebni, the lower grade sntr type was obtained from the Nile Valley or in Punt and was transported overland to Egypt. The higher grade ‘ntiyw incense was, on the other hand, exclusively acquired from Punt and was typically imported by sea.\n\nF. Nigel Hepper of the Royal Botanical Gardens reports that botanists have identified this ‘ntiyw variety with Boswellia frereana. Along with Boswellia carteri, he indicates that these are the incense types that are prevalent on the northern Somali littoral (cf. Sayed (2002)). Both species of frankincense have also been found in actual ancient Egyptian tombs (Lucas (1945)). This is pivotal since, according to Hepper, northern Somalia is the only area where Boswellia frereana grows in close proximity to the seashore, and on the requisite rocky hills to boot. Although such “terrace” land formations also occur in other parts of the Red Sea region, in Djibouti, Eritrea and Sudan, frankincense here grows instead at a minimum of 100 kilometers inland. The tree varieties that are found in this hinterland are likewise different from Boswellia frereana. Analogously, Chittick (1975) points out that a broad and arid plain lies between the sea and the steep mountains of the northwestern littoral of Somalia. It is therefore in the northeastern parts of the country, where the mountain ranges sit on the coast itself, that the most probable location of the “Frankincense Terraces of Punt” is to be found. Not coincidentally, this is also the very area where the ancient emporiums of Mossylum, Akkanai and Opone were all situated.\n\nAnimals\n\nAs with its flora, the fauna of Punt that is depicted on the Egyptian frescoes and described in hieroglyphic texts is native (though not entirely exclusive) to the Red Sea region. Among these animals is the giraffe, which today is only found in Africa. Superficially, this seems to rule out an Arabian location for the Land of Punt. A closer reading of the ancient testimonials, however, reveals that the giraffe was apparently also present in parts of the Arabian peninsula and Levant during the classical period. The ancient Greek historian Diodorus Siculus refers to the species as “camel-leopards”, and notes that it used to roam the area between northern Arabia and Syria (cf. Scott (2012)).\n\nIn an analogous vein, the representation of what may be a one-horned rhinoceros on the Hatsheptsut temple reliefs has been suggested as being indicative of an Indian location for Punt. This is because two-horned rhino species are today limited to Africa, whereas the one-horned rhino is restricted to the Eastern Himalayas. However, as Kenneth Kitchen (1971) observes, the rhinoceros figure in question, unlike the other animals depicted at Deir el-Bahri, is badly damaged, and this makes its identification difficult. Going by a similar “one-horned” rhino representation that was discovered at Kerma in Sudan, the depiction thus appears to have been an error. Kitchen writes:\n\nThat the beast seems only to have one horn (not two, as has the African rhino) is simply an error, analogous with that of one of the two Kerma representations of Middle Kingdom date (cf. Hilzheimer, ZÄS 67 (1931) 40), and with the stylized determinative of Louvre C. 14 accepted by Keimer (ASAÉ 48 [1948] 52 and fig. 5).\n\nThe archaeologist John Bimson also indicates that early Egyptian hieroglyphs included a pictogram of a one-horned rhinoceros. This, in turn, suggests that the species may have once inhabited the Nile Valley (cf. Sweeney (2006)). In short, the ultimate geographical origin of certain of the land-dwelling fauna of Punt is inconclusive.\n\nA rather different situation exists with the fish and other aquatic creatures that are illustrated on the same murals. Sayed (1989) points out that the Hatshepsut temple walls show marine species whose natural habitat is saltwater, including the lobster (palinurus). The body of water that is depicted therefore could not have been the freshwater Nile river, but instead more likely the Red Sea. Correspondingly, an analysis of the aquatic fauna on the Puntite temple reliefs by Eva Danelius and Heinz Steinitz found that the bulk of the specimens are indeed Red Sea varieties. As Kitchen (1971) notes, only a handful appear to be freshwater species, a fact which can be easily explained:\n\nOne factor largely discounted by Herzog (pp. 27, 55) is that of the fishes in the Deir el Bahri reliefs. These are, almost throughout, Red Sea/Indian Ocean fauna, with only two or perhaps three fresh-water species; see Eva Danelius and H. Steinitz, JEA 53 (1967) 15-24. If Hatshepsut’s expedition had reached Punt solely by travelling up the Nile, the overwhelming majority of Red Sea fishes is totally inexplicable. Why not solely Nile fauna, as in other Nile scenes? On the other hand, the Red Sea fauna fit a Red Sea route to Punt. The very few fresh-water fishes (a turtle; catfish, able to go in salt water, anyway; tilapia, dubious) could reflect the Nile part of the journey (Koptos-Thebes) or even fauna in Punt (River Baraka into Tokar Delta?), and pose an infinitely less problem.\n\nAdditionally, the walls of the Hatshepsut temple’s upper Portico of Punt feature bas-reliefs of a mysterious bird, which was among the animal species brought to Egypt from Punt. The bird was originally assumed to be a crane because only its rear could be seen. However, the Egyptologist Filip Taterka of the Polish Academy of Sciences found a well-preserved depiction of the same species on a nearby wall block. Thanks to its unique head feathers, Taterka was able to identify the animal as the secretary bird (Sagittarius serpentarius). This conclusion was also later confirmed by three ornithologists, who are experts on the secretary bird. Taterka’s finding is of particular importance vis-a-vis the debate on the whereabouts of Punt because the secretary bird only lives in open grassland in Africa. The species is endemic to Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan alike; it actually serves as a national emblem in Sudan. According to Taterka, this fact strongly tips the weight of evidence in favor of a Northeast African location for Punt (cf. Foundation PAP). He states:\n\nIt was long thought that a bird that was difficult to identify was a crane, because at this spot the ornament was in poor condition—only the rump was visible.[…]\n\nIt is not without significance that today the secretary bird is the main element of the emblem of Sudan.\n\nThe most definitive faunal data regarding where Punt was situated comes from baboons (Papio hamadryas). These are among the creatures that are depicted on the Hatshepsut temple walls at Deir el-Bahri, as well as on other ancient Egyptian murals. Baboon remains have also been found within actual tombs in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt. Moreover, in the Egyptian pantheon, the deity Thoth, who is associated with the moon cult, is often shown with the head of a baboon.\n\nIn 2010, a research unit led by Salima Ikram of the Egyptian Museum and Nathaniel Dominy and Gillian Leigh Moritz of the University of California analyzed hairs from two such mummified baboons, which had been kept at the British Museum. To determine the place of origin of the specimens, the scientists compared the baboons’ oxygen isotopic values with those of living baboon specimens from various hypothesized Puntite locations, including Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia and Yemen. Although the isotope data of one of the baboons was distorted, initial results from analysis of the other specimen indicated that its oxygen isotopic values matched closest with those of modern baboons from Eritrea and eastern Ethiopia. This prompted Dominy to posit that “Punt is a sort of circumscribed region that includes eastern Ethiopia and all of Eritrea”. He also suggested that the port of Massawa in Eritrea may have been the landing point of the ancient Egyptians’ expeditions to Punt since a baboon specimen from that harbor matched well with their ancient baboon mummy.\n\nIn 2015, the same Egyptian and American researchers conducted a more comprehensive isotopic study to confirm their preliminary findings. This time they compared both hair and bone samples, which they had extracted from two New Kingdom baboon mummies, with those of living baboons from the primary hypothesized locations of the Land of Punt. Analyzing both oxygen and strontium values, the scientists found that the closest matches were with specimens endemic to eastern Somalia and the Eritrea-Ethiopia corridor. They thus concluded that this area was the likeliest source of the baboons that were exported from Punt to Ancient Egypt:\n\nThe tandem origins of maritime trade and international diplomacy have roots in the Red Sea region. Graphic and epigraphic accounts of this trade often provide specific place names, or toponyms, with unambiguous geographic locations. Yet the location of one crucial polity, Punt (or Pwnt), remains uncertain. Punt was a major emporium of gold, electrum, and biological materials such as myrrh, ebony, ivory, short-horned cattle, leopards, and baboons (Papio hamadryas). The importance of these materials is reflected in the 1200-year duration of trade between Ancient Egypt and Punt (Vth-XXth Dynasties; ca. 2458-1163 BC). The recovery of mummified baboons from several New Kingdom tombs, which was a period of thriving trade with Punt, raises the possibility of using stable isotope analysis to source their provenience. Here we report the oxygen and strontium stable isotope composition of two P. hamadryas mummies from XXth Dynasty tombs. We also analyzed the hair and bone of modern baboons in 106 habitats spanning five hypothesized locations of Punt: (1) Eritrea-Ethiopia; (2) Mozambique; (3) Somalia; (4) western Uganda; and, (5) Yemen. Isoscapes based on kriging interpolation of hair keratin δ18O values and bioapatite 86Sr/88Sr ratios were produced and an index of similarity was calculated based on the geometric mean of the two kriged maps. Our results reveal a high likelihood match with eastern Somalia and the Eritrea-Ethiopia corridor, suggesting that this region was the source of Papio hamadryas exported to Ancient Egypt.\n\nIn 2023, Dominy co-authored an archaeogenetic study which compared the mitogenome of a Late Period (c. 800-540 BCE) baboon specimen retrieved from Gabbanat el-Qurud (“Valley of the Monkeys”), Egypt, with those of other baboons recovered from various hypothesized Puntite sites in Africa and the Arabian peninsula. The scientists observed that the Gabbanat el-Qurud baboon carried the G3-Y mtDNA haplogroup, a baboon mitochondrial subclade whose present-day distribution is focalized around Eritrea and eastern Sudan, including the Adulis vicinity. Along with other lines of evidence (discussed below) — which indicate that, centuries before the establishment of the Axumite kingdom, Adulis was a key part of ancient Punt — this discovery further reifies that the Red Sea area in Northeast Africa was indeed the location of the old Puntite civilization (cf. Grathwol et al. (2023)):\n\nAdulis, located on the Red Sea coast in present-day Eritrea, was a bustling trading centre between the first and seventh centuries CE. Several classical geographers––Agatharchides of Cnidus, Pliny the Elder, Strabo––noted the value of Adulis to Greco-Roman Egypt, particularly as an emporium for living animals, including baboons (Papio spp.). Though fragmentary, these accounts predict the Adulite origins of mummified baboons in Ptolemaic catacombs, while inviting questions on the geoprovenance of older (Late Period) baboons recovered from Gabbanat el-Qurud (“Valley of the Monkeys”), Egypt. Dated to ca. 800–540 BCE, these animals could extend the antiquity of Egyptian-Adulite trade by as much as five mummified baboon from Gabbanat el-Qurud and 14 museum specimens with known centuries. To explore this possibility, we analysed complete mitochondrial genomes from a provenance together with published georeferenced mitochondrial sequence data. Phylogenetic assignment connects the mummified baboon to modern populations of Papio hamadryas in Eritrea and eastern Sudan. This result, assuming geographical stability of phylogenetic clades, suggests that present-day Eritrea, and by extension Adulis, was a source of baboons for Late Period Egyptians. It also establishes geographic continuity with baboons from the fabled Land of Punt (Dominy et al., 2020), giving weight to speculation that Punt and Adulis were essentially the same trading centres separated by a thousand years of history.\n\nOther products of Punt\n\nGold\n\nIn various hieroglyphic texts, the ancient Egyptians refer to Punt by another name: Bia-Punt. This roughly translates as “Mine(s) of Punt”, which indicates the primacy of gold among the imports from the old territory. A Sixth Dynasty inscription belonging to the Pharaoh Pepi II is more explicit, as it demands “more than the mining region of Punt” (Sagrillo (2014)). Punt, or at least some of the districts under its control, was thus a center of gold production. This fact is of considerable value in helping to narrow down its location since gold was and is only mined in select areas around the world.\n\nThe first mention of the new toponym comes from the Sixth Dynasty traveler Harkhuf (ca. 2250 BCE). In inscriptions recorded at Aswan, this official asserts that he brought back products from “Bia-Punt.” According to Sayed (2002), this first reference to Bia-Punt appears to specifically concern the Nile area in northern Sudan. Sayed (1989, 2002), moreover, notes that the Harkhuf inscription is a clear allusion to gold, which the latter had presumably imported overland. In 1976-77, Sayed led a University of Alexandria expedition at Wadi Gawasis, where his archaeological team also found a Twelfth Dynasty stela “inscribed with a hieroglyphic text recording an order issued by King Sesostris I (Senusret I) to his vizier Antefoḳer to build ships to be sent to the region of Bia-Punt” (cf. Sayed (1978)).\n\nHence, Bia-Punt could be accessed through a water route. This implies that the region in question may have been coextensive with the Atbai desert in Sudan, which has long been a hub of gold mining. Other possibilities in the interior include the gold mines of western Ethiopia, as suggested by Eric Robson in his 2007 monograph In Search of Punt: Queen Hatshepsut’s Land of Marvels. Furthermore, Ibrahim (2013) reports that geologists have identified a zone in northwestern Somalia as potentially containing gold reserves. The Nubian Gold Corporation signed an agreement to prospect there, and the site has gold-quartz deposits with an estimated 13.5 gold parts per million. Since gold in Northeast Africa is associated with old metamorphic rocks — Precambrian geological formations that are found in all of these areas — Bia-Punt could conceivably have been situated anywhere within this traditional Puntite sphere. Eritrea would seem the most logical possibility, for it is the only territory in Northeast Africa and the Arabian peninsula whose entire geological structure consists of Precambrian rocks. On the other hand, Bressan (2013) notes that the geological formations of Yemen, Oman and other areas in Arabia are marked by recent sediments that are mostly bereft of gold. This makes the Arabian peninsula an unlikely location for Bia-Punt, the “Mine(s) of Punt.”\n\nSlaves\n\nIn addition to gold, slaves were among the main exports that the Puntites sent to their ancient Egyptian trading partners. Most of these captives appear to have been of “Negroid” ancestral stock. This is suggested by the Grand Procession mural in Thebes at the tomb of Rekhmire, a vizier under Pharaoh Thutmose III. The painting contains several registers or levels, which depict various foreign envoys submitting tribute to the ancient Egyptians, including Puntite, Cretan and Nubian emissaries. The Grand Procession’s uppermost register shows a couple of reddish-skinned, orthognathous Puntite delegates, who strongly resemble the mural’s similarly copper-toned Egyptian, Cretan and Hamitic-type Nubian figures. These Puntites are flanked to the right by jet black-skinned, prognathous men, who, except for their attire, are physically identical to the Nilotes in the Nubian panel. As Kitchen puts it, “beside the so called ‘Hamitic’ type (like Parahu) not very different from Egyptians in appearance, others represented were clearly of Negro stock” (cf. Balanda (2005)). The Grand Procession is paralleled by the Book of Gates mural in the tomb of Pharaoh Seti I, which similarly contrasts an Egyptian “Hamitic” type with a Nilotic “Negroid” type (Richardson (2003)).\n\nDimitri Meeks of the French National Centre for Scientific Research, like many other Egyptologists, believes that the conspicuously Nilotic folks on the Grand Procession represent the Puntites’ slaves. As such, they would have been accompanying their masters on this tributary voyage. The Egyptologist Stanley Balanda, however, argues that the “Negroid” individuals may instead have been diplomatic envoys too because “both races are being represented in the same way without distinctions being made to indicate any social or legal differences”. By his reckoning, the Nilotic figures would therefore have also inhabited some districts of Punt alongside the Egyptian-related Puntites. Meeks’ position on the slave origin of the “Negroid” individuals that are standing near the Puntites is compatible with an Arabian location for Punt (a geographic theory of which he is one of the main proponents). Balanda’s postulation is not, though, since there appear to be no indigenous populations in the Arabian peninsula, relict or otherwise, that have a similar phenotype (cf. Coon (1939)). On the other hand, both arguments are in line with a Northeast African locus for the Land of Punt.\n\n“Negroid” groups — Nilotic and Bantu populations known in Djibouti and Somalia as jareer or adoon and in Eritrea and Ethiopia as shanqilla or barya (terms denoting “negro”) — have long constituted the bulk of the slave class in the Horn. In antiquity, most of these slaves were captured from the surrounding areas bordering South Sudan and the Great Lakes region. However, there is textual evidence pointing to an early presence of two separate ancestral stocks in Northeast Africa; one with “Hamitic” affinities, and the other of apparent “Negroid” origin. (*N.B. On a population level, the Afro-Asiatic speakers of the Horn generally do not intermarry with jareer/barya (“negroes”), whether at home or abroad. This is due to traditional beauty standards, which place a low value on “Negroid” features. These aesthetic preferences are how the Afro-Asiatic-speaking populations have managed to maintain their distinctive physiognomies to a remarkable degree, despite being flanked by Niger-Congo/Nilo-Saharan/Khoisan communities with markedly different phenotypes. The Afro-Asiatic speakers’ reluctance to interbreed with “negro” groups also stems from a desire to preserve their own ancestral heritage (cf. Mwakikagile (2009), Gwyn (2013), Folklore Institute (2003)). Correspondingly, ancient DNA analysis has found that the early Cushitic settlers of East Africa were of North African ancestral stock, and that their modern descendants in the Horn share close affinities with them; see Ancient DNA from Ethiopia.)\n\nThis racial dichotomy was reported as far back as the kingdom of D’mt/Da’mat in Eritrea and northern Ethiopia, which flourished around 3,000 years ago during the pre-Axumite period. According to Robert Hoyland, who conducted archaeological excavations in the area in 2013, inscriptions attributed to the kings of that polity describe its rulers as lords of “Da’mat, its east and its west, its Sabaeans and its immigrants, its red people and its black people”. Tibebu (1995) likewise notes that “the distinction between the saba qayh (red men) and tsalim barya (dark slave) was also made during the Aksumite period”.\n\nIn that regard, in keeping with the Grand Procession and other ancient Egyptian murals, the Asiatic Society (1968) reports that epigraphs belonging to the Axumite King Ezana differentiate between “red” Nubians and “black” Nubians; the former correspond with Hamito-Cushitic peoples related to the Egyptians, and the latter are associated with Nilotes:\n\nThe Nubians at that time also (as in previous centuries) were divided into the Red People or the Kasu or Cushites (Hamites like the Egyptians) and the Black People or Sudanian Negroids[…] these two peoples evidently were contrasted as “Red” and “Black” from their skin-colour; and as late as the fourth century A.D., the great Ethiopian King ‘Ezana, who conquered Nubia, differentiated between these two classes of Nubian.\n\nThanks to the medieval chronicle of the Ethiopian Emperor Susenyos I, we are able to precisely identify the descendants of the “red” and “black” populations in the Horn. The royal court historian refers to the Afro-Asiatic-speaking non-slave populations as qayh (red) and the “shanqilla” groups as tsalim (black) (cf. Pankhurst (1976)). In short, whether the “Negroid” figures that are standing beside the Puntites on the Grand Procession mural represent emissaries or slaves, either possibility is consistent with a Northeast African center for the Land of Punt. This is because there was both an early presence in the area of distinct “Hamitic” and “Negroid” populations (as depicted on said fresco), and a well-established slavery tradition involving Nilotic captives. (For further details, see Who were the ancient Nubians?, If Nubians are ancestrally related to Egyptians, why do they now speak a Nilo-Saharan language instead of an Afro-Asiatic language?, and Are Sudanese “Arabs” really peninsular Arabs?.)\n\nBesides the foregoing, other ancient Egyptian inscriptions indicate that the Puntites also exported a number of Pygmy slaves. Harkhuf writes that during the second regnal year of the Pharaoh Pepi II (r. 2278–2184 BCE), he brought back a dancing pygmy as a royal gift for the child-king, which he had acquired from Punt by way of the kingdom of Yam in the Sudanese region. The traveler also avers that another pygmy had been imported from Punt at an earlier date, during the reign of Pharaoh Djedkare-Isesi of the Fifth Dynasty (r. 2414–2375 BCE). This exotic presence of Pygmy individuals in the Nile Valley is exemplified by Bes, the dward-god of ancient Egypt. According to the Egyptologist Amelia Edwards, the diminutive Bes and the goddess Hathor were “two of the principal deities worshipped by the Egyptians [who] had their divine origin in Punt” (see below for further discussion). Hart (2005), moreover, writes that the name Bes was also invoked by the ancient Egyptians as a catch-all term for their various dwarf-deities, who were unprepossessing in appearance but otherwise harmless:\n\nThe Egyptians had a number of monstrously formed dward-deities for which the name Bes was employed. The god in a plumed crown was normally bearded with his broad face surrounded by a lion’s mane and ears. His tongue often protruded in a playfully aggressive fashion. The body of Bes represented a band-legged dwarf wearing either a panther skin or a kilt, more Syrian than Egyptian, and a lion’s tail. Imitating for magical purposes the solar iconography of the god Horus of Behdet, Bes can be shown with his arms stretched out with a hawk’s wings suspended from them. The ‘sa’ sign meaning ‘protection’ is frequently carried by Bes.[…] He has his most crucial contribution to make to Egyptian life in his role as protector of childbirth in partnership with Taweret.\n\nThis begs the question, from where did the Puntites capture the Pygmy slaves to begin with? Perhaps somewhere in the central African hinterland, where they in fact have long been concentrated. Based on recent archaeological finds in an inland valley in northwestern Somalia (discussed below), Ibrahim (2013) argues that the Puntites had intermittently ventured even further in the interior, far beyond the boundaries of Punt and toward the Congo Basin and the gold mines of Mashonaland. There, they would have accessed slaves, additional gold reserves, and other commodities in the trans-regional trade networks for later barter with the ancient Egyptians. It would appear that such mercantile contacts persisted for centuries, as Leo Africanus testifies that the Sultanate of Mogadishu (Magadazo) originally controlled the gold trade at Sofala in present-day Mozambique (“this golden trade [at Sofala] was first in the power of the Moores of Magadazo”).\n\nMore parsimoniously, Lunde and Porter (2004) report that the so-called “Pygmies” brought back to Egypt might instead have been natural dwarves. This raises the possibility that these captives were simply short-statured individuals, and thus, plausibly drawn from the native hunter-gatherer communities of the Horn (as represented by the diminutive Chabo, Eyle and Ribi foragers) or Great Lakes regions (as represented by the small Hadza and Sandawe foragers). In support of these scenarios, Scozzari et al. (1999) observed a moderately high incidence of B-M60 haplotypes among individuals in northern and southern Egypt; Scozzari et al. (2014) also report that ~28% of Berbers in Egypt’s Siwa Oasis, a medieval hub of the slave trade, carry the B2a subclade (Table S7). However, this paternal lineage has not been found in ancient samples from either Egypt or Sudan (cf. this essay; Ancient DNA from Sudan). It instead today occurs at greatest frequencies among both the Hadza and Mbuti hunter-gatherers of southeastern and central Africa. Furthermore, genome analysis of modern Afro-Asiatic speakers in the Horn of Africa indicates that these individuals bear a predominant non-African ancestry (over 70%), with minor Sub-Saharan African admixture (~27%) that was in part derived from ancient East African foragers. This East African hunter-gatherer component is, however, rare among the contemporary Egyptian and Libyan samples (see Genetic affinities of the Cushitic, Ethiosemitic and North Omotic-speaking populations of the Horn of Africa). Ergo, the presence of haplogroup B in Egypt is indeed likely a legacy of the captured “Pygmies,” who — considering the absence of this clade from the Nile Valley’s archaeogenetic record — seem to have been imported in significant numbers only after the Graeco-Roman period.\n\nBee hive-shaped houses\n\nA mural at Deir el-Bahri shows a Puntite village next to a body of water containing Red Sea aquatic species (see above). This settlement consists of domes or bee hive-shaped huts, which are raised above ground on poles and accessible by ladder. Junker (1921) remarks that “Negroes” and mixed peoples, who are distinct from the “Hamitic” Puntites, can be seen standing near these houses:\n\nIt is significant that the first encounters with the Negroes of which we have any knowledge occurred through two quite different channels. When Queen Hatshepsowet, in the ninth year of her reign, i.e., 1482 b.C., sent a great fleet to the land of Punt, which included roughly the regions of Italian Eritrea and of British Somaliland, the expedition there met with genuine Negroes as well as half-breeds among the Hamitic Puntites. In the famous pictures of the rock temple at Der el-Bahri we see them moving about among the round huts built on piles. Whether they lived in a state of subjection to the real inhabitants of the country, or had settled beside them in the harbour district, or had merely come from the hinterland for purposes of trade, are matters of conjecture.\n\nBalanda (2005) further states that, in Northeast Africa, such pile-dwellings are today restricted to the Nile Valley itself, for “houses on stilts were common in places subject to seasonal flooding such as regions inhabited by the Dinka and other tribes of the Sudan.” He argues that this particular scene, therefore, appears to depict a northerly part of the Land of Punt situated closer to Egypt, as opposed to the more distant sections of Punt which are clearly located in the Horn (namely, the Frankincense Terraces of Punt, the Mine(s) of Punt or Bia-Punt, and the Mountain of Punt). Kitchen (1971) reaches a similar conclusion:\n\nHere, Herzog concentrates on pile-dwellings, one of the unique features of the Deir el Bahri scenes. While structures of this sort are known (past or present) in some form in many parts of the world, the only areas that prove relevant are S. Sudan and E. Africa. At present, those in the Sudan are between 12° N. and the Uganda border. There are some slender indications (tribal traditions; negritic skeletal remains) for the relevant Nilotic peoples having once lived further north than now – perhaps within part of Herzog’s Punt. He would dismiss Somaliland as unsuited and lacking any tradition or evidence.\n\nBalanda and Kitchen are evidently right since their explanation accounts for both the uniquely built homes and the “Negro” figures portrayed at Deir el-Bahri. Moreover, it is supported by genetic research. Balemi (2018) reports that 55.55% of the Nilo-Saharan-speaking Berta individuals that he analysed bear the Eurasian F-M89 haplogroup. In Northeast Africa, the earliest instance of this Y-DNA lineage has been observed among Christian-period specimens entombed at sites on Meroë Island and the Nile’s 4th cataract (Yousif and Eltayeb (2009)). This is significant because it reveals that the Berta of the Ethiopia-Sudan border area — whom Koettlitz (1900) notes still build stilted huts very similar to those shown on the Deir el-Bahri mural — in the past had contact with and absorbed Eurasian-affiliated peoples (i.e., the Puntites). These are the exact conditions required to explicate the presence of both “Negroes” and mixed “Negro Puntite” folks dwelling near the “Hamitic Puntites” (or Puntites proper).\n\n(*N.B. As of 2023, on the continent of Africa as a whole, the oldest instances of the Eurasian Y-DNA haplogroup F-M89 have been detected among Early Neolithic individuals excavated at Kahf Taht Al Ghar, an archaeological site located in the Maghreb, Northwest Africa. Genome analysis of these ancient specimens, who were agriculturalists, indicates that they bear European-related Anatolian Neolithic ancestry. By contrast, the medieval Kulubnarti individuals buried in Sudan mostly carry Levantine ancestry (which includes ancestry derived from the Middle Neolithic pastoralists of Skhirat, northern Morocco) as well as European-related Steppe ancestry and East Asian ancestry. Ergo, there are two separate ancient population sources that ultimately could have transmitted the Eurasian F-M89 clade, which many Berta individuals now harbor. The Kulubnarti Nubians appear to be the more probable candidate group considering their geographical proximity to the Berta. For our genome analysis of these medieval Kulubnarti Nubian specimens, see this. Also refer to here for a fuller discussion on the Middle Neolithic Skhirat individuals. The latter ancient pastoralists seem to be the ancestral population from whom the modern Cushitic, Ethiosemitic and North Omotic-speaking groups of the Horn and the contemporary Nubians of the Nile Valley inherited much of the Levantine ancestry they carry.)\n\nPuntite short-sword\n\nAnother wall-painting found at the Pharaoh Hatshepsut’s temple in Deir el-Bahri depicts the Puntite chief Parahu wearing a sheath around his waist, which contains a particular kind of short-sword. This dagger is characterized by a straight double-edged blade design, topped by a hilt in the shape of a trident. According to Grottanelli (1947), among modern populations, only Somalis have traditionally manufactured a short-sword of this unique type.\n\nKnown as the bilao or bilawa, the dagger is evidently of great antiquity since old rock engravings featuring it have been observed at various archaeological sites in the Horn region, including Bur Eibe (Bur Eibi) in southern Somalia. The weapon figures at some of these locales are believed to have been carved at a time period more recent than the Puntite era. However, the short-swords portrayed at Bur Eibe are ancient, of sufficiently remote age to have been wielded by Parahu and his constituents in Punt.\n\nGrottanelli (1947) writes:\n\nThe Somali[…] have long had, and still retain, a typical cutting weapon, a straight bladed dagger of a design peculiar to them alone (fig. I). That this weapon is traditionally old among them, is proved by the ancient Somali rock engravings discovered by Graziosi at Bur Eibi (fig. II), which faithfully reproduce the unmistakable shape of their hilts and straight double edged blades. The antiquity of this type of dagger would prove even greater if it were possible to identify it, as Revoil maintained, with that worn at the belt by Punt chiefs as depicted in the Deir-el-Bahri wall paintings. Be this as it may, it is a fact that the Somali departed so unwillingly from this particular type, that when they started forging swords for themselves they remained faithful to the same model, merely making the blade longer (fig. III). They adopted the Semitic word for “sword” (sayf or sef), but Reinisch’s texts show that they often continue to call this[…] bilawa or bilao, i.e. “dagger.” To this day, swords and sabres are very rare among them, as is the case with most Cushitic tribes.\n\nPuntite leg-rings\n\nOn one of the wall panels at the Hatshepsut temple in Deir el-Bahri, the Puntite chief Parahu is shown with a series of yellow-colored rings adorning his right leg up to the middle of his calf. These seem to be leg bracelets, which are either made of gold or some other gold-plated metal. Although modern Cushitic-speaking males generally do not wear such leg rings, both ancient rock art and traditional accounts suggest that this was indeed once a custom of their Cushitic ancestors.\n\nHussein (2023) points out that an old cave painting at Laas Geel, an archaeological site in northwestern Somalia, depicts a pastoralist man wearing what appear to be stacked rings around one of his legs. These accoutrements are similar to the aforementioned leg bangles, which can be seen on the Puntite ruler Parahu. Describing this rock art, Gutherz and Jallot (2011) state:\n\nThe colours used for the human figures are the same as those used for the cows and the execution makes use of the same techniques. The thorax is often the only part which has resisted time. It is covered by a white or red ochre wide tunic, adorned with vertical stripes. The filiform arms outstretched in a gesture suggesting adoration, sometimes end with hands in the form of a fan. The legs are held together and clothed with “baggy” trousers. Rings possibly adorn the ankles, but there are no feet.\n\nAn oral history, as recounted to colonial administrators by a Karimojong Nilote elder in British East Africa, likewise asserts that in the later 1800s, a distinct pastoralist community used to inhabit parts of the Great Lakes region now occupied by Bantu/Nilotic/forager peoples. These herders have since been assimilated into the Oropom, a local hunter-gatherer community. Evidently, the vanished pastoralists were Cushitic peoples because they are described as having been “very light-skinned” with “pronounced slant eyes,” and their “men wore their hair long in a pigtail, like Indian women” — Cushites being the only folks in eastern Africa who have many members that adhere to a pastoral lifestyle and have a light complexion, oblique eye folds and lank hair. With regard to where ancient Punt was located, what is especially interesting about this testimony is the revelation that “both their men and women wore many bangles, sometimes stretching from their ankles to their knees and from their wrists to their armpits” (Wilson (1970)).\n\nFrom the above account as well as the Laas Geel cave painting we may glean that wearing leg rings was a longstanding custom among Cushitic peoples. This tradition, though now essentially extinct, seems to have persisted to at least the 19th century.\n\nHenna\n\nDuring the Hatshepsut expedition to Punt, one of the key products that her party brought back with it to Egypt was henna (Lawsonia inermis) (IPA (1967)). A mural at Deir el-Bahri (shown to the right) depicts this queen’s men loading the plant onto their vessels alongside other cargo. The ancient Egyptians required the henna for cosmetic, medicinal and ritualistic purposes. They utilized it for personal beautification, as a fragrance to perfume their body oils, lotions and ointments, and also as an ingredient in the embalming process. Likewise, ancient texts convey that the early Greeks made similar use of henna. The physician Dioscorides of Anazarbus (c. 40 CE – 90 CE) refers to the plant as cyprus. This descriptor is reportedly the origin of the toponym Cyprus, as the ancient Cyprians once held a monopoly over trade in henna (Churchill (1875)).\n\nIn Egypt, actual mummies have been found with traces of the dye on their hands, feet, nails and hair. Grafton Elliot Smith, for instance, states that the 18th Dynasty official Henttawi had his hair dyed a bright reddish color. This practice seems to date to at least the predynastic era, for Guy Brunton writes that a Badarian old woman apparently had henna-dyed hair of a light brown-red hue (Lucas and Harris (1999)). (*N.B. Brothwell and Spearman (1963) also observed authentically blond ancient Egyptian individuals; their hair samples were not affected by either hair dye or cuticular damage.)\n\nThe custom of using henna to decorate the body was, therefore, of some importance in ancient Egypt. It is also still adhered to by modern Egyptians. Moreover, henna is a cultural staple of the Afro-Asiatic-speaking populations in the Horn of Africa. Among Somalis, Afars, Oromos, Saho, Beja, Bilen, Tigre, Jebertis, Argobbas and Hararis, the dye is used on a weekly basis for cosmetic adornment. More elaborate designs are reserved for special occasions such as wedding ceremonies, Eid celebrations and birthdays. Although usage of henna in the Horn is closely linked with Islam, the plant’s exportation from Punt suggests that, as in Egypt, this tradition is actually a holdover from remote times.\n\nKohl\n\nKohl is another one of the “wonderful things of Punt” that were brought back to Egypt. The ancient Egyptians usually mined malachite and galena (lead sulphide) — the main elements used to make, respectively, the earlier green and later black varieties of kohl — at Sinai and the Eastern Desert, as well as in various areas in Upper Egypt. However, they would sometimes also import these cosmetic ingredients from the Arabian peninsula through Punt in the Horn region (Hardy et al. (2006)). During the New Kingdom, the Egyptians would procure kohl itself directly from Punt (Bard and Fattovich (2018)).\n\nIn ancient Egypt, kohl was liberally applied as eye-paint on both men and women. This has been gleaned from analysis of the contents of actual kohl pots and other cosmetic vessels, which were used to store the eye-paint. A dark residue has often been discovered on the inside of these containers (cf. Kalloniatis (2019)). Hassan and Hassan (1981) describe the creation process and storage of galena-based kohl by the predynastic Egyptians as follows:\n\nThe galena was ground on a cosmetic palette and applied as black eyeliner, equivalent to the kohl still widely used in Egypt. The ground galena was mixed with water and natural resins (Lucas 1948). The prepared galena paste was kept in shells, reeds, vessels, or wrapped in leaves. Another pigment used for eyelining in Predynastic and Dynastic Egypt is malachite. Sometimes both pigments were found together. Lucas (1948) noted that the black eye pigments used in ancient Egypt consisted of galena in 40 of 61 cases.\n\nThe receptacles used for storing kohl later evolved to small containers and eventually to tubes, pots and spoons during the dynastic era, with little sticks to apply the cosmetic to the eyes. Besides its obvious aesthetic function, scholars have proposed that in ancient Egypt, kohl may have also served a ritualistic or protective purpose insofar as its use was an attempt to symbolize the Eye of Horus (wadjet) (Mendoza (2017)). Likewise, the C-Group pastoralists of Lower Nubia, whom Oric Bates and George Andrew Reisner have identified as ancient Libyans, were known to apply the kohl eye-paint (E. S. Thomas (1926) notes: “the “C” Group people dressed in skins ; they used black eye paint and tatued their bodies, proving that they had light skins.” For additional details on this, see I have noticed that many rural Berber women have traditional face tattoos. Is this also common among other Afro-Asiatic speakers? And where did this practice originate?).\n\nThe omnipresence of kohl in old Egypt is clearly reflected in dynastic period artwork. Monument walls and temple murals, such as at the Nebamun Tomb-Chapel, routinely show Egyptian figures wearing the eyeliner. Statues are likewise often depicted with painted eyes. This fact is especially interesting given that some ancient Puntite sculptures — which were recently excavated in northern Somalia; see discussion below — similarly feature contouring of the eyes, as if with kohl. Besides visual art, kohl is mentioned in the ancient Egyptian fable the Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor. This story describes an encounter between a stranded Egyptian merchant and a talking snake, the latter of whom calls himself the “Prince of Punt.” The serpent offers to the trader a number of gifts to take back to Egypt, including kohl (Westling (1999)).\n\nAs with henna, kohl remains today in wide usage among Egyptians. The eye-paint is also a traditional fixture among the Afro-Asiatic-speaking populations in the Horn of Africa. This serves as yet another compelling reason why the ancient Land of Punt was almost certainly located in Northeast Africa.\n\nAppellatives\n\nOne of the most insightful clues as to the location of the Land of Punt involves the etymology of the word Berber. It has often been assumed — incorrectly — that the appellative originated with the ancient Greeks as a cognate of barbaros (“barbarian”). However, the first mention of the term actually dates earlier to the New Kingdom of Egypt (c. 1500 BCE), when it served as an ethnonym for the Puntites. Specifically, during the Hatshepsut expedition to Punt, the ancient Egyptians identified their Puntite counterparts as brbrta in hieroglyphic symbols. This is believed to have been an onomatopoeic imitation on the Egyptians’ part of the “bar” or “ber” sound that was apparently common in the Puntite language (cf. AECR (1976); Bowersock (2013)). In view of these hieroglyphics, the Egyptologist Ernesto Schiaparelli suggests that the Puntites inhabited a region coinciding with northern Somalia, Eritrea (then part of northern Ethiopia), and the Atbara zone in northeastern Sudan (AECR (1976)):\n\nIn the “Dictionnaire des noms geographiques contenus dans les textes hiéroglyphiques” by H. Gauthier, the Italian Egyptologist Schiaparelli is quoted as identifying the inhabitants of Punt during the Hatshepsut expedition with the people living in the northernmost part of Ethiopia, what is now Eritrea, and in two cities named Berbera. One is situated just north of Atbara, the town at the confluence of the Blue and White Niles, the other on the coast of Somaliland. Schiaparelli based his conclusion on the hieroglyphic signs which stood for the Puntites, namely [brbrta]. I believe that these signs brbr were an onomatopoeic attempt on the part of the Egyptians in the expedition to imitate the language of the people with whom they were dealing. The actual occurrence of brbrta as identifying the people of Punt, a historical people of ca. 1500 B.C., gives weight to the theory that it was here in the Egyptian New Kingdom that the word Barbar originated, rather than in the land of the Sumerians, or the Semites, or the Indo-Europeans.\n\nSchiaparelli also bases his argument on the aforementioned Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, a document which repeatedly alludes to “Berbers” living in these same areas. As a result, this territory was known to the ancient Greeks as “Barbaria” or “Barbara”, meaning the “land of the Berbers” (Huntingford (1980)). The Periplus indicates that there were Berber commercial settlements all along the Red Sea coast during the 1st century CE, with two such concentrations: one in the “Barbaria” in the Nile Valley around southern Egypt and northern Sudan, and the other in the “far-side” ports of the “other Barbaria” in the Horn (viz. “there are other Berber market-towns, known as the ‘far-side’ ports”). These Berbers/Puntites were therefore still trading in frankincense and other commodities in the southern part of their territory, just as they had over a millennium before in Pharaoh Hatshepsut’s time. This is confirmed by the Roman scholar Pliny the Elder. In his treatise Natural History, Pliny tells us that the Pharaoh Sesostris I — a ruler who, as seen on the Wadi Gawasis stela, ordered at least one expedition to Punt during his reign — led his men to the “far-side” Berber port of Mosylon (Mossylum), a cinnamon emporium located in the present-day Bosaso area in northeastern Somalia:\n\nBeyond these is the Gulf of Abalites, the island of Diodorus, and other desert islands ; also, on the mainland, a succession of deserts, and then the town of Gaza, and the promontory and port of Mossylum, to the latter of which cinnamon is brought for exportation : it was thus far that Sesostris led his army.\n\nAnother key aspect of the Barbaria connection is the form of governance that the territory’s denizens were said to have adhered to. The Periplus indicates that the Berbers were divided into tribal communities, each ruled by its own chief. These independent city-states in the greater Barbaria were, in turn, overseen by a learned king or paramount chief named Zoscales (Zoskales):\n\nOn the right-hand coast next below Berenice is the country of the Berbers. Along the shore are the Fish-Eaters, living in scattered caves in the narrow valleys. Further inland are the Berbers, and beyond them the Wild-flesh-Eaters and Calf-Eaters, each tribe governed by its chief; and behind them, further inland, in the country towards the west, there lies a city called Meroe.[…]\n\nThese places, from the Calf-Eaters to the other Berber country, are governed by Zoscales; who is miserly in his ways and always striving for more, but otherwise upright, and acquainted with Greek literature.[…]\n\nThe voyage to all these farside market-towns is made from Egypt about the month of July, that is Epiphi. And ships are also customarily fitted out from the places across this sea, from Ariaca and Barygaza, bringing to these far-side market-towns the products of their own places; wheat, rice, clarified butter, sesame oil, cotton cloth, (the monache and the sagmatogene), and girdles, and honey from the reed called sacchari. Some make the voyage especially to these market-towns, and others exchange their cargoes while sailing along the coast. This country is not subject to a King, but each market-town is ruled by its separate chief.\n\nAs in the Berber period, the various Puntite districts were apparently governed by separate leaders. This is clear from Egyptian hieroglyphics, which Balanda (2005) notes repeatedly allude to the “chiefs” of Punt in the plural. For example, an inscription at Deir el-Bahri reads: “pitching tents for the king’s representative and his (the king’s) expedition to the myrrh terraces on both sides of the sea[…] in order to receive the chiefs of this land.” Likewise, an inscription at Sinai, which dates from the 36th regnal year of the Pharaoh Amenophis III (r. 1390–53 BCE), records an official indicating that: “I went forth by the sea coast (pr.n=j hr-gs wtd-wr) to announce the marvels of Punt to receive aromatic gums which the chiefs had brought (jn.n wrw) in their Khementy-boats as revenue from unknown lands.” The loosely centralized governmental structure of the Berbers/Puntites, therefore, also appears to have remained essentially unchanged since the New Kingdom.\n\n(*N.B. From the Deir el-Bahri hieroglyphic text above, we also learn that there were “myrrh terraces on both sides of the sea,” which the ancient Egyptians visited during their sojourns in Punt. This statement appears to give some credence to Balanda’s assertion that the Puntites inhabited both the Horn of Africa and the neighboring parts of the Arabian peninsula. Other evidence to that effect includes linguistic analysis by Alexander Militarev, who identified a Cushitic substratum in the Modern South Arabian languages. Militarev, an advocate of a Levantine origin for the Afro-Asiatic language family, suggests that this signifies that a) Cushitic speakers originally dwelled in Arabia, in an area adjoining that of the speakers of the MSA languages, b) most Cushitic speakers later migrated to Northeast Africa, and c) the Cushites who stayed behind in the Arabian peninsula were assimilated by their Semitic neighbors (cf. Blažek (2013)). Since the ancient Himyarites occupied the Hadramout governate and southwestern areas in Yemen near the domain of the MSA speakers, it is relevant to note that “in the 5th century the Himyarites, in the south of Arabia, were styled by Syrian writers Cushaeans and Ethiopians” (Baynes (1878)). Additional evidence supporting Balanda’s contention includes genetic and anthropometric analysis: Non (2010) observed close mtDNA ties between various Cushitic/Ethiosemitic-speaking populations of the Horn and Yemenis from the Hadramout governate, and Billy (1988) reported that his Cushitic and Ethiosemitic-speaking samples shared anthropometric affinities with Yemenis.)\n\nÉdouard Naville relates that the ancient Egyptians also referred to the Puntites by another name, “the khebsi of the divine land.” This designation was apparently uncommon in earlier times, but subsequently gained currency during the Ptolemaic era, when it often appeared on hieroglyphic texts. Glaser links the appellation khebsi with that of Habesch, a toponym denoting the later territory of Abyssinia (Naville and Carter (1906)). Naville writes:\n\nAnother name of the Puntites is[…] “the khebsi of the divine land.” This name is somewhat rare in the old texts, but it is frequently found at a later period in the Ptolemaic inscriptions which speak of Punt. Brugsch translates the word khebsi, “those who cut or detach the incense from the trees;” Max Muller, “the curled men, or the men with long curls.” Brugsch already alludes to the assonance on which Glaser lays stress, between that word and that of Habesch, which is the name of the actual Abyssinia, and which used to stretch over a vaster territory. Whatever may be the meaning of the word, it seems to designate the real Puntite population of Hamite race, to distinguish it from the negroes who also inhabited the land of Punt.\n\nThus, the ancient Egyptians called the Puntites firstly brbrta (an umbrella term for Cushitic speakers of Northeast Africa) and then alternately brbrta and khebsi. The advent of the later designation, khebsi, coincides precisely with the time period when the Cushitic-speaking Agaw forebears of the Abyssinians are thought to have adopted Semitic tongues. It therefore appears that the Egyptians were trying to draw attention to the fact that, although the Abyssinians had switched languages, they, now styled as khebsi, were still ultimately of the same Cushitic Puntite stock as the Agaw and other brbrta.\n\n(For more details, see Why did the ancient Egyptians refer to the Puntites as brbrta if they were Cushitic speakers rather than Berber speakers? and What evidence is there that the Puntites spoke an Afro-Asiatic language?.)\n\nAncestral and spiritual homeland\n\nThe ancient Egyptians held a special reverence for the Land of Punt. Known to them as Ta netjer or Ta nuter (“God’s Land”), they regarded it as both their ancestral homeland and a spiritual center. Thus, whenever the ancient Egyptians depicted the Puntites on their temple walls, they consistently showed them as being similar to themselves in appearance and size (unlike other non-Egyptians, who were instead frequently caricatured). Punt was likewise always identified in the hieroglyphic texts without the determinative symbolizing a foreign territory.\n\nThe Egyptologist Gaston Maspero summarizes these conventions as follows:\n\nThe legends which seem to bring the ancestors of the Egyptians from the Red Sea coast have already been mentioned. They are closely connected with the worship of the Sky and Sun god Horus of Edfu. Hathor, his nurse, the “House of Horus,” the centre of whose worship was at Dendera, immediately opposite the mouth of the Wadi Hammamat, was said to have come from Ta-neter, “The Holy Land,” i.e. Abyssinia or the Red Sea coast, with the company or paut of the gods. Now the Egyptians always seem to have had some idea that they were connected racially with the inhabitants of the Land of Punt or Puenet, the modern Abyssinia and Somaliland. In the time of the XVIIIth Dynasty they depicted the inhabitants of Punt as greatly resembling themselves in form, feature, and dress, and as wearing the little turned-up beard which was worn by the Egyptians of the earliest times, but even as early as the IVth Dynasty was reserved for the gods. Further, the word Punt is always written without the hieroglyph determinative of a foreign country, thus showing that the Egyptians did not regard the Punites as foreigners. This certainly looks as if the Punites were a portion of the great migration from Arabia, left behind on the African shore when the rest of the wandering people pressed on northwards to the Wadi Hammamat and the Nile. It may be that the modern Gallas and Abyssinians are descendants of these Punites.\n\nThe Egyptologist Flinders Petrie, moreover, contends that the stimulus for the establishment of ancient Egypt’s first dynasties arrived from Punt in the south, a territory which he asserts was located on both coasts of the Red Sea, in the Horn of Africa and Arabian Peninsula:\n\nOn looking to the Egyptian representatives of the various races known to them, we see but one resembling the Egyptian high class race. The people of Pun (Fig. II), so admirably sculptured on the temple of Hatshepsut, are very closely like the high Egyptians. Further, the Egyptians call Pun “the land of the gods” ; and they do not appear to have made war on the Punite race, but only to have had a peaceful intercourse of embassies and commerce. It appears that Pun, or Punt, was a district at the south end of the Red Sea, which probably embraced both the African and Arabian shores. The name is connected with the Poeni, or Phoenicians, who appear to be a branch of that race. The Egyptians may then be another branch of the Punite race, and their earliest immigration into Egypt confirms this.\n\nPetrie (1920) explains further that, since dynastic Egypt’s first Pharaoh Menes/Narmer hailed from the old city of This or Thinis in Upper Egypt — as did the Thinite Confederacy, a grouping of predynastic Egyptian nobles led by Menes — and because This would remain Egypt’s first capital until the Third Dynasty, when the seat of government would be moved northward to the newly-established city of Memphis, the impetus for the foundation of dynastic Egypt originally came from the south. In other words, this catalyzing influence ultimately penetrated the Nile Valley from the direction of ancient Punt:\n\nBefore Menes comes a dynasty of kings of This, and Menes is the Thinite who led his people to a new capital at Memphis. If the invading race had come in from the north, or from Suez, Memphis would have been naturally reached first, and their establishment so high up as This would be less likely [by “up” Petrie means toward the source of the Nile river, which is located well south of Egypt; therefore, traveling upriver here is traveling southward]. But the monarchy starting at This, in the middle of Egypt, points to the race having come into Egypt by the Koser road from the Red Sea. They must further have come from the middle or south end of the Red Sea ; as, if they were from the north end, they would have entered at Memphis. The first settlement being at This points then to an origin in the southern half of the Red Sea.\n\nCorrespondingly, George Rawlinson reports that hieroglyphic inscriptions variously describe Amun, the king of the ancient Egyptian gods, as the Hak or King of Punt. The sky deity Horus is also venerated as “the holy morning star which rose to the west of the land of Punt.” According to Petrie, all of Egypt’s earlier Pharaohs, in fact, claimed divine descent from Horus. The Egyptian priest Manetho (fl. 300 BCE) identifies these rulers as Thinite and Memphite in his lists. During the Fifth Dynasty, this tradition apparently changed because the Pharaoh Userkaf and other new kings, who Manetho identifies as Elephantine, each instead started to refer to himself as “Son of Ra” after the sun god Ra. Petrie (1920) writes:\n\n[…] it has never been observed that no Egyptian king claims descent from Ra until this Vth dynasty. The earlier kings are always Horus kings, or Horus and Set united ; but no king calls himself “Son of Ra” until the new dynasty, who are here stated to be children of the god Ra, and to begin as his high priests at Heliopolis.\n\nMoreover, a Ramesside monument inscription at the Sinai peninsula identifies the lunar god Thoth as the “Lord of Punt” (cf. Shaheen (1998)). This ancient text in full reads (Gardiner and Peet (1917)):\n\nBeloved of Hathor, lady of the turquoise, beloved of Thoth, lord of Punt.[…]\n\nLord of the two lands, Usimarrēr Setepenrēc, beloved of Hathor, lady of the turquoise, lord of risings, Ramesses Meriamūn beloved of Thoth, lord of Punt.\n\nAs the historian Amelia Edwards further notes, Hathor, the greatest and one of the oldest of the ancient Egyptian female deities, was in fact styled as the “Lady of Punt”:\n\nThe Egyptians entertained an extreme reverence in the abstract for the Land of Punt, which apparently formed part of a larger district known generally as Ta-nuter, or the Land of the Gods. Hathor and Bes, two of the principal deities worshipped by the Egyptians had their divine origin in Punt, and Hathor was adored under a special form as “The Lady of Punt.” Bes, in his grotesque features and general characteristics, is clearly a barbaric divinity, and is occasionally represented as nursing or devouring the large cynocephalus apes depicted in the wall-sculptures of Dayr-el-Bahari as indigenous to the Land of Punt. The Egyptians appear to have cherished a vague tradition of their own origin as natives of Ta-nuter at some extremely remote period ; and it is interesting to note that the curved beard characteristic of these natives of the Land of the Gods is a special attribute of divinities as well as of deified personages in Egyptian art.\n\nAnother sobriquet that the ancient Egyptians used to identify the goddess Hathor was “Mistress of Punt” (cf. Redman (2021)). The respect they held for her, and for Punt generally, is perhaps best expressed by Pharaoh Hatshepsut herself. Hieroglyphic inscriptions attributed to this monarch remark (Manley (1996)):\n\nIt is the sacred region of God’s Land; it is my place of distraction; I have made it for myself in order to cleanse my spirit, along with my mother, Hathor… the lady of Punt.\n\nGiven the above, we can better situate ancient Punt by examining whether or not the various hypothesized Puntite locales once had an established spiritual cult devoted to deities from the Egyptian pantheon. To this end, the Roman scholar Pliny the Elder refers to the area near present-day Bulhar in northwestern Somalia as the “Port of Isis” (Isidis Portus), so named after the Egyptian goddess Isis. In the original Latin text, Pliny states that “in eum Troglodytis myrrha confertur” (Österreichische Leo-Gesellschaft (1941)). This phrase translates into English as “myrrh of Troglodytes is poured into him.” Ergo, in antiquity, the Port of Isis appears to have held a ritual significance. Certain pastoral-themed rock art in northern Somalia, such as at the Laas Geel site, likewise seems to depict worshipers in ceremonial attire honoring the deity Hathor, the presiding “Lady of Punt” and figurative “mother” of Queen Hatshepsut (cf. Ibrahim (2013)).\n\nAnalysis of toponyms or place-names provides additional, confirmatory evidence that northern Somalia was a spiritual hub in ancient Punt. According to Ibrahim (2013), the traditional name for the northern Somali territories, waaqoyi, is etymologically derived from waaq, an appellation connoting both the pre-Abrahamic religion of the Cushitic peoples and its sky-god. As such, waaqoyi literally translates as “God’s Land” (Ta netjer) — the very name which the ancient Egyptians used to refer to the Land of Punt:\n\nThe Somali word Waaqooyi or Waqooyi has two meanings: a) North direction; and b) the northern mountainous areas facing the Gulf of Aden. Since Waaq (in Somali) and Waaqoo (in Oromo) are equivalent to God, Waaqooyi is undoubtedly the Land of gods! Because of the past sacredness of those northern mountainous areas, their relation to Waaq can be fully justified. Many other place names in the northern Somali coast and hinterland can be identified with Waaq such as Waaqeel (a plain near Gacan Libaax Mountain), Waaderiaya (on the coast between Mait and Las Qoray), Waaqderi (near Las Anod) and Waaq Dhambala (the Estuary where Waheen seasonal watercourse enters the sea).\n\nIt could be as simple as that! Waaqooyi — a word which is as ancient as the Somalis — means ‘the land of gods.’ Therefore, the Land of Punt could be no other place than Waaqooyi (the northern Somali coast).\n\n(For additional details, see Were the ancient Egyptians related to the Puntites?.)\n\nBiological affinities\n\nEgyptologists have long acknowledged that whichever geographical location truly conforms with the Land of Punt, it should have populations that share close biological ties with the ancient Egyptians; or, at the very least, with the ancient Egyptians’ lineal descendants, the modern Egyptians. This rules out Mozambique and Uganda since their Bantu and Nilotic majorities are fairly recent settlers, and these groups also do not have any significant affinities with the ancient and modern Egyptians. The Afro-Asiatic (Hamitic-Semitic) speaking populations of the Horn, Sudan, Maghreb and the Arabian peninsula, on the other hand, are in an altogether different position. Anthropological studies have confirmed that they share close physical and genetic ties with Egyptians as a whole. This perhaps should not come as a surprise, for the ancient Egyptians were Afro-Asiatic speakers too.\n\nMorphology\n\nAs seen at Deir el-Bahri, among other archaeological sites, the ancient Egyptians consistently show the Puntites on their temple walls as being very similar to themselves in physical type — just as though these groups were sibling populations. The Puntites are depicted as moderately tall and of gracile build, with “Caucasoid” features and reddish-brown skin; they also frequently wear their hair long. John Desmond Clark writes:\n\nThe Puntites are depicted in several Eighteenth Dynasty scenes. Typically, the men have dark reddish skins and fine features; characteristic negroid types are not shown, although they occur amongst depictions of riverine southerners (of Wawat, Kush, Irem, etc.). Other Puntite features are also not found amongst other southerners. Long hairstyles are typical for Puntites until the reign of Amenhotep II; during his reign and earlier, in that of Tuthmosis III, an intermediate ‘bobbed’ hairstyle appears, and thereafter Puntites have close-cropped hair similar to that of the chief of Punt under Hatshepsut. A long or medium dressed goatee is found at all periods\n\n— Peoples of Cushitic origin. Top row, from left to right: Somali man, Beja man, Afar man, Oromo man. Bottom row, from left to right: Somali woman, Agaw woman, Afar woman, Oromo woman. Modern Cushitic peoples with the cad (“light” or “olive-skinned”) phenotype and mariin (“red-brown”) phenotype have in all essential aspects retained the physiognomy of their Cushitic ancestors. For this reason, they closely resemble the Cushitic Puntite figures depicted at Hashepsut’s temple and other ancient monuments in Egypt.\n\nSuch external morphological traits are relatively common among the Afro-Asiatic-speaking populations on either side of the Red Sea (see, for example, the anthropometric studies Leguebe (1981) and Billy (1988) below). For our purposes, then, the skeletal characteristics of these groups are more useful in locating Punt.\n\nIn terms of height, the Egyptologist Édouard Naville states that the Puntite chief Perahu (Parahu) is depicted on the Deir el-Bahri temple walls as “a tall well-shaped man.” This portrayal concurs with the estimated stature of an ancient individual excavated at Heis (Xiis), a site in northwestern Somalia corresponding with the old “Berber” port of Mundus (discussed further below). Measurement of the total length of this adult male skeleton (c. 21 to 46 years in age), which was exhumed from Tomb 75, produced a height of around 1.68 m (cf. González-Ruibal et al. (2022)). When adjusted for flesh covering the bones in the living and minor osteological shrinkage from dehydration, this gives a stature close to the averages of 1.729 m and 1.723 m, respectively, which Boughey (1971) reported for his Dir male sample from northwestern Somalia and Puccioni (1931) reported for his Darod male sample from northeastern Somalia.\n\nIn 1975, G. P. Rightmire analysed the skulls of ancient Egyptian male and female individuals (Egyptian E, Gizeh) and Cushitic specimens of the Pastoral Neolithic, comparing the crania of these Afro-Asiatic speakers with those of various earlier Khoisan and Bantu samples (including Rwanda). He observed that most of the Egyptian and Cushitic individuals were distinct from the Sub-Saharan African samples, with the Cushitic Baharini, Makalia I, and Elmenteitan F1 specimens in particular showing close ties with their Egyptian counterparts. As Rightmire put it, “there is little doubt about Baharini as Egyptian female.” Analogously, Kemp (2006) found that the ancient and modern Egyptians are craniometrically closest to other Afro-Asiatic speakers and Nubians inhabiting Northeast Africa. They are also more distantly related to populations in the Near East, but again share no significant affinities with the ancient and modern “Negroid” populations in Africa. Spradley (2006) compared the skulls of recent populations from northern Somalia and Egypt with those of various Sub-Saharan African groups and recently mixed African Diaspora populations, including African Americans (who are descended from enslaved Niger-Congo speakers from West Africa, with ancillary European and Native American admixture). She similarly observed that the individuals from “Somalia and Egypt are closest to one another.” Likewise, Terrazas Mata and Benavente (2013) report that their Horn of Africa and Dynastic Egypt samples craniometrically cluster together, separately from their Niger-Congo, Nilo-Saharan and Khoisan-speaking samples. The scientists attribute this shared affinity between the Horn and Egyptian groups to common descent from ancestral Afro-Asiatic-speaking populations, whom they suggest ultimately arrived from the Middle East. In the same vein, Adel et al. (2021) note that:\n\nCraniofacial features are considered one of the most unique features of populations with different ethnic backgrounds. The Egyptians present facial features close to those of Northeast Africans, Mediterranean Asians, and Europeans, all of them sharing Caucasian ancestry.\n\nThe biological ties between the Afro-Asiatic-speaking groups in Northeast Africa are, in fact, so well established that researchers have moved on to exploring which specific ancient “Hamitic” series in the region they share the most immediate affinities with (e.g. Batrawi (1946); Mukherjee (1955); Billy (1977); Billy (1981b); Rösing (1990)). G. Billy (1975) summarizes these findings thusly:\n\nDuring the dynastic era, this last [Upper Egyptian] variety covered a wide central zone of the Nile valley, stretching well beyond towards East Africa, as shown by the similarity which persists with the present-day Ethiopian populations (Tigre) or even Somali. By virtue both of its diffusion and its perenniality, they deserve to be assimilated to the basic population type of the Egypto-Nubian complex.\n\nAltogether, this highlights the close relatedness of the Puntites and ancient Egyptians, ancestral populations whose apparent descendants have remained biologically proximate.\n\nIn addition to the preceding, Egyptologists have noted a sporadic occurrence of blondism in the Land of Punt. This can serve as a helpful hint as to where the territory was situated, for blond individuals were relatively uncommon in the ancient world. The Hatshepsut expedition murals show the Egyptians being received by a chief of Punt, the aforementioned Parahu/Perahu, who Édouard Naville (1906) indicates is depicted as “flaxen” or blond-haired. Naville writes:\n\nThe Punite is a tall, well-shaped man, of a type which certainly belongs to the Caucasian race ; his hair is flaxen, and is divided into well-made plaits ; his nose is aquiline, his beard long and pointed ; he wears only a loin-cloth, with a belt, in which a dagger is fixed. The left leg of the chief is covered with a bracing of rings which seem to be of metal. The Punites are representatives of the Hamitic race, of that red race to which the Egyptians also belong, and which gave its name to the Erythraean Sea. They are painted red, but with the red of Horus, which is not exactly like that of ancient Egyptians.\n\nSweeney (2006) argues that this precludes both the Horn and Southern Arabia as prospective locations for the Land of Punt since there are few blond individuals today among the Afro-Asiatic-speaking populations in these areas. He asserts that the blondism points instead to an Indo-European source centered in the Near East; either the Indo-Iranian mariyanna elites of the Levant, or the Phoenicians (whom he proposes may have acquired such an element through intermarriage in western Europe). However, ancient blond individuals did, in fact, exist in the Nile Valley itself. Archaeologists working in burial sites associated with the Meroitic culture have unearthed a number of clearly blond specimens. Janssen (1978) reports that “330 graves were excavated in cemetery 221 (Meroitic) and a proportion of blond individuals of Caucasoid type found.” Hrdy (1978), also analysing Meroitic remains, notes that many ancient individuals buried at Semna South in Sudanese Nubia had blond or red hair. He suggests that this “probably points to a significantly lighter-haired population than is now present in the Nubian region.” Archaeogenetic analysis indicates that this blondism was likely inherited from earlier European settlers in Nubia. A Meroitic period individual (dated to c. 350 BCE to 350 CE) excavated from the Kwieka site in northern Sudan was found to bear the Eurasian mtDNA haplogroup H2a, and, moreover, this ancient mitogenome showed ties with Northern European mitochondria (cf. Breidenstein (2023)). Given these finds, the minor incidence of blondism among the Puntites appears to reflect a direct Meroitic strain in this population and, indirectly, an Indo-European one (for empirical evidence of such an influence, see Batrawi diagram above). This too is in agreement with a Northeast African locus for Punt.\n\n(*N.B. Lazaridis et al. (2022) conducted a comprehensive analysis of phenotypic traits borne by ancient individuals exhumed in Europe and Asia, and report that blond hair was most common among their early European samples (viz. 62.5% in Early Medieval Germany, 42.9% in Pre-Christian Iceland, 40% among ancient Saxons of England, and 40% among the Motala hunter-gatherers of Sweden; cf. Supplementary Materials). By contrast, the scientists did not observe instances of blond hair in any of their examined ancient Levantine samples, except for a low frequency of 14.3% among specimens from Chalcolithic Israel — a situation clearly ascribable to foreign influx since no blond individuals have been found among both earlier Levantine samples from Mesolithic and Neolithic Israel and later Levantine samples from Middle-to-Late Bronze Age Israel. In brief, archaeogenetic analysis has confirmed that the blondism documented among the Meroites and ancient Egyptians is almost certainly affiliated with early European populations, as are the instances of red hair in the Nile Valley (refer to Ancient DNA from Sudan). For details on these ancient peoples, who introduced the Steppe genome component to Northeast Africa, see Genetic affinities of the Cushitic, Ethiosemitic and North Omotic-speaking populations of the Horn of Africa.)\n\nGenetics\n\nY-DNA and mtDNA\n\nAlong with comparative morphology, genetic analysis provides much information on the likely location of ancient Punt. Examination of uniparental lineages, which include both Y-DNA (paternal) and mtDNA (maternal) haplogroups, has revealed strong ties between the Afro-Asiatic-speaking populations in the Horn and Nile Valley.\n\nTrombetta et al. (2015) observed that around 74.5% of southern Egyptians are haplogroup E1b1b-V12* or E3b1a1 carriers (cf. Supplementary Table 7). According to Hirbo (2011), this clade is next most prevalent among Cushitic-speaking populations in East Africa (Garreh=74.1%, Gabra=58.6%, Borana Oromo=50%). E1b1b-V12 is also immediately ancestral to the V32 subhaplogroup that constitutes the main paternal lineage among ethnic Somalis from Somalia (80%) and Tigre individuals in Eritrea (60%) i.e., in the core ancient Puntite area. (*N.B. While the Tigre nowadays speak a Semitic tongue, their language contains a North Cushitic (Beja) substratum. This suggests that they were originally Cushitic speakers, who later adopted a Semitic language from South Arabian settlers in the Eritrean highlands. Accordingly, Hirbo (2011) reports that his sampled Beja individuals overwhelmingly belong to the E1b1b paternal haplogroup (100%). Hassan et al. (2008) further indicate that most of their Beja male samples, like the Tigre, fall under the clade’s V32 subhaplogroup.)\n\nAntonio et al. (2019) identified E1b1b-V12 in two Imperial and Medieval Roman individuals, remarking that “this haplogroup is present at high frequency across present-day North Africa, especially in Egypt (up to 74.5%)” (cf. Supplementary Materials). Moreover, Sirak et al. (2021) observed a prevalence of the Y125054 subclade of V12 among Christian-era Nubian individuals from Kulubnarti in Sudan. These specimens also had considerable West Eurasian ancestry, which the scientists propose was likely derived from Egypt. Prendergast et al. (2018) further indicates that an ancient Cushitic individual (ca. 3350-3180 BP) excavated at Cole’s Burial, Kenya, a site associated with the Pastoral Neolithic cultural complex, bears the CTS3282 sublineage of V32. As of 2021, this is the earliest reported instance of E1b1b-V32 in the archaeogenetic record. (For more details, see I have heard that the V12 and V32 subclades of the paternal haplogroup E1b1b, which are today common among Afro-Asiatic speakers in Northeast Africa, are old Arabian lineages. Is this true?.)\n\nSimilarly, mitochondrial analyses by Stefflova et al. (2011) and Boattini et al. (2013) found that the maternal haplogroups that are common among the Cushitic and Semitic-speaking Afro-Asiatic populations in the Horn are also frequent among the Afro-Asiatic speakers in Egypt. These shared clades include the M1 haplogroup, whose earliest occurrence has been detected among Epipaleolithic Iberomaurusian specimens excavated at Taforalt (Loosdrecht et al. (2018)) and early Neolithic individuals buried at Ifri n’Amr or Moussa (Fregel et al. (2018)), both located in Morocco. Loosdrecht et al. (2018) note that the M1 and U6 mtDNA lineages are “mostly confined to present-day populations in North and East Africa” and that “U6 and M1 have been proposed as markers for autochthonous Maghreb ancestry, which might have been originally introduced into this region by a back-to-Africa migration from West Asia.” Stevanovitch et al. (2004) also report that M1 is now particularly common in Egypt’s Gurna Oasis, suggesting an ancestral connection between the Gurna population and other Afro-Asiatic-speaking communities in the Horn of Africa.\n\nAutosomal DNA\n\nAs discussed on Ancient DNA from Ethiopia, the Afro-Asiatic-speaking populations in Northeast Africa also appear to share the same autosomal DNA (auDNA) signature. Hodgson et al. (2014) observed that ethnic Somalis, Afar, Amhara, Tigray and Oromos are defined by a West Eurasian-affiliated ancestral component, which they refer to as “Ethio-Somali”. Dobon et al. (2015) found that roughly the same ancestral element defines Egyptian Copts, Beja, Afro-Asiatic-speaking Ethiopians, Sudanese Arabs, and many Nubians (evidently, individuals descended from the Hamitic Kasu or “red Nubians”). By contrast, Hodgson et al. discovered that the Omotic-speaking Ari are defined by a separate, Nilo-Saharan-affiliated ancestral component, which the researchers call “Ethiopic”. Thus, the Ethio-Somali/Coptic and Ari components appear to correspond rather closely with the “red” (“Hamitic”) and “black” (“Negroid”) ancestral populations, respectively, that are depicted on the ancient temple walls and mentioned in the hieroglyphic inscriptions as having inhabited Punt.\n\nThe foregoing was also confirmed by López et al. (2021), who compared the genomes of the Afro-Asiatic-speaking groups in Ethiopia with those of other global populations, both ancient and modern. The scientists identified a West Eurasian ancestral component among the local Afro-Asiatic speakers, which they suggest is Egypt-related and traces back to the inhabitants of the Land of Punt:\n\nEthiopians in the southwest, typically NS speakers plus a few non-NS speaking groups (Chabu, Dasanech, Karo), are more related to Bantu and Nilotic speakers relative to AA speakers in the northeast that instead show more ancestry related to Egyptians and West Eurasians (Fig 3, Fig S12). The inferred timing and sources of admixture related to Egypt/W.Eurasian-like sources, starting around 100-125 generations ago (~2800-3500 years ago; Fig 3, Fig S12) as in previous findings (Pickrell et al., 2014; Pagani et al., 2012), is consistent with significant contact and gene flow between the peoples of present day Ethiopia and northern Africa even before the rise of the kingdom of D’mt and interactions with the Saba kingdom of southern Yemen which traded extensively along the Red Sea (Currey, 20"
