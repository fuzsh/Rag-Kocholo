Their dates vary from the ancient to the relatively modern. At Grimspound on Dartmoor, for example, you find a Bronze Age village, while little more than half a mile down the lane towards Widecombe in the Moor you will discover the remains of Challacombe – a medieval village with its ruined longhouse and system of strip lynchets still visible on the hillside. Half a mile to the west lies evidence of a major Victorian mining site that once employed 150 people in a mass of buildings, diggings and large waterwheels – all now gone. None of these settlements happened haphazardly; they were built at these locations for good reasons, and disappeared for others. These villages are now referred to as ‘lost villages’ or sometimes ‘ghost villages’, and there are an estimated 3,000 of them. Many date from pre, or medieval history and the reasons for their disappearance are varied. Some were aﬀected by natural causes, such as changing climate, coastal erosion, flooding, or the changing course of a river. Often communities were deliberately displaced or forced to move because of the changing economy. In the fourteenth century, large areas of Scotland were cleared because the landowners had replaced arable farming with livestock. There was more money to be made from wool and meat than there was from crop production, and fewer labourers were needed. This situation led to mass emigration. Similarly, as a consequence of the famine in Ireland during the mid-nineteenth century, many people had no alternative but to emigrate if their families were to survive. In both of these 1\n\nlost villages aw.indd 9\n\n3/4/08 11:21:52\n\nthe l o st v illages\n\ninstances, many villages, hamlets and farms were left abandoned as people sought to improve their lives in foreign lands. Then, of course, there were villages built around natural resources, where for example quarrying or mining took place. When the resource ran out the village became unsustainable, and the people had to move to find work. The same principle often applied in agricultural villages, as over the years improved technology and mechanisation meant that fewer jobs were available on the land. Famously, the bubonic plague in 1348 caused many villages to change location. When you discover an isolated church in a rural area with no other buildings around it, the local people sometimes claim the church stands alone because of the ‘Black Death’. Other than the church, most buildings were made of wood and when the plague ravaged the village, the entire settlement was burnt to the ground and rebuilt in another location. How much of this is truth, and how much myth, is diﬃcult to ascertain. Bearing in mind that roughly half the population of the country died during this terrible period, the plague probably did contribute to the eradication of some entire communities. But the reasons why churches sometimes stand in isolation might reflect any one of the above scenarios. In this book we study villages that met their end during the twentieth century, the most diverse period in history. Because of this diversity, there are many diﬀerent factors contributing to the end of communities that in some instances had existed for a thousand years. Also, because it is still relatively recent in our past, there are people alive who can either remember living in these communities or are descended from those who did. Through photographs and memories we can actually put names, faces and characters to the people who were displaced. Standing on the site of a remote ancient settlement on Dartmoor, it is hard to have any real aﬃnity with the people who lived there. But when we come across an overgrown village that disappeared less than 100 years ago, there is a greater sense of sadness for their loss. After all, these people were very like us: they spoke the same language; dressed in a similar fashion; they went to school; found jobs locally; married and had children; they took part in the life of the village, its clubs, sports and festivals. As well as studying the villages themselves, this book is an exercise in social history – an examination of how our near ancestors lived during the early part of the twentieth century. In 2\n\nlost villages aw.indd 10\n\n3/4/08 11:21:52\n\nintr o ducti o n\n\nsome ways, these lost villages also represent a lost lifestyle, a way of life trapped in time. Even 50 years ago, the lives of everyday people – our parents, grandparents, and great grandparents – were very diﬀerent from those that we live today.\n\n3\n\nlost villages aw.indd 11\n\n3/4/08 11:21:52\n\nT H E L o S T v I L L AG E S\n\nTheBessieBelleandMatildatakingscrapawayfromMorwellham Quayin1903 PhotographcourtesyofMorwellhamandTamarValleyTrust\n\n4\n\nlost villages aw.indd 12\n\n3/4/08 11:21:57\n\nAt the start of the twentieth century Britain was changing rapidly and some villages disappeared as a result of these changes. Even though the new century would bring unimaginable advances in science and technology, Britain’s dominant status in the world was on the wane. The Victorian age made Britain ‘Great’. It was a time of great engineers and innovators, when the industrial revolution brought commerce to every corner of the kingdom. By 1851, British factories and engineering works were at their height of productivity, a situation reflected in the Great Exhibition at Crystal Palace opened by Queen Victoria on 1 May. This historic event was a celebration of Britain’s industrial prowess. Our journey begins in a wooded valley along the River Tamar, the border between Devon and Cornwall, in a quiet rural backwater a few miles from Tavistock. This picturesque country setting might appear out of place when discussing the industrial revolution. However, in the 1860s, Morwellham Quay was the busiest inland port in the west of England. Yet just 100 years later during the 1960s, the cottages had become ivy covered ruins, the quays silted up, and the docks abandoned. Thousands of tourists visit Morwellham Quay each year, so you might think it is an unusual place to begin a tour of Britain’s ghost villages: indeed, the village was never totally abandoned and several cottages have seen continuous occupation. But in one respect it is probably an ideal place to begin our journey if we are to understand the way people lived in Britain 100 years ago, as well as some of the reasons why several communities disappeared at the turn of the twentieth century. Also, if you had been fortunate enough to visit Morwellham Quay before the 1970s, you would 5\n\nlost villages aw.indd 13\n\n3/4/08 11:21:58\n\nthe l o st v illages\n\nhave observed a very diﬀerent scene from that of today. At that time, other than a handful of surviving houses that were still being lived in, it was exactly what you would have expected from a ghost village: the school had closed, the workers had moved away, and most of the buildings were abandoned, forgotten and ruined. In 1969, the Morwellham and Tamar Valley Trust began its work at Morwellham Quay, commissioning teams of archaeologists, surveyors and historians to research the mines and village, and to begin the painstaking work of restoring these to their former glory, thus preserving part of Britain’s industrial heritage for future generations. The village has now been restored to how it would have appeared in the 1860s when around 300 people lived there, with many more walking in daily from nearby villages and hamlets to work on the quays. At some of the restored cottages you are aﬀorded an insight into how people lived at the time, but very little would have changed domestically by the turn of the century. You can see the lamps that were used to light the home; the sculleries where women spent all day on a Monday washing the clothes in the copper before rinsing them in a bucket and pressing them through a mangle; the open fires on which the poorer people cooked and the ranges used by the more aﬄuent; the bath tubs in which they bathed; and the outside lavatories that oﬀered little more than a hole in a wooden shelf with a bucket beneath. When you read some of the personal accounts later in the book you will observe that conditions at some of the villages we visit had changed very little by the middle of the twentieth century. But how had this small riverside village come to such prominence, only to slide once again into obscurity? Morwellham Quay was originally established by the Benedictine monks who had founded Tavistock Abbey in 974 ad. So it is quite probable that the original settlement pre-dates the Norman Conquest. At Morwellham Quay the monks found that a stream joining the River Tamar was a useful place for landing a boat. By navigating the river to this point, they were able to establish a quayside from which boats could bring supplies for the abbey and, just as importantly, export the woolen cloth that was being produced at Tavistock on which the abbey’s wealth depended. After the dissolution of the monasteries in the 1530s, the land passed to the Russell family, who would later become the Dukes of Bedford. But by now the real value of the village was becoming 6\n\nlost villages aw.indd 14\n\n3/4/08 11:21:58\n\na l o st v illage li v es again\n\nevident. The whole area was rich with minerals and metallic ores and successive mining booms transformed the site into a bustling inland port. The surroundings brimmed with tin, silver ore, lead ore, arsenic and copper, some of which was brought to the quaysides by packhorses toiling across the hills from Dartmoor. At the time of Elizabeth i copper was in great demand for the manufacture of canons and other items of ordnance, a demand which continued right through to the early nineteenth century when Britain was at war with Napoleon. Copper was not only used in the manufacture of weapons but for a wide variety of things – from machines, engines, boilers, pots and pans to coins and the fittings of carriages and trains. It was even pressed into sheets to plate the bottom of ships. Therefore, the lodes in the Tamar Valley set the scene for a mining boom that would last at various levels of intensity until 1900. As the activity in the Tamar Valley steadily intensified, the roads were still very basic and the trains of packhorses bringing the ore would make them muddy and hazardous. So, as early as 1803, a brilliant mining engineer named John Taylor began work on the Tavistock Canal, linking Morwellham Quay to the town four miles away, and from there the mines of western Dartmoor. The packhorses would bring their loads from the mines to Tavistock, from where iron barges would ferry them down to the port, returning with lime, coal and timber. However, building a canal in such hilly terrain was no simple task, so Taylor designed it with a gentle decline. This meant that although barges were able to come down to Morwellham Quay from Tavistock on the current, the return journey necessitated the use of poles to push them through a tunnel that was one and a half miles long, before being hitched to ponies for the remaining haul into town. In 1844, it was discovered that Morwellham itself had its own important resource, as a massive lode of copper ore passed through the hillside close to the port. The resulting mines, run by the Devonshire Great Consolidated Mining Company, would produce somewhere in the region of 700,000 tonnes of copper ore and 72,000 tonnes of arsenic during a 60-year period. At the height of its activity, this complex of five mines covering an area of 167 acres was served by a comprehensive transport system, which included the Tavistock Canal and three separate railways, two of which were built on inclined lines. During this period the valley would prove to be Europe’s leading source of copper, and more shipping navigated 7\n\nlost villages aw.indd 15\n\n3/4/08 11:21:58\n\nthe l o st v illages\n\nthe River Tamar than the Mersey. It became so busy that at several places along its banks there was a series of continuous quays: not only at Morwellham but at places like Newquay and Gawton. At some places along the quiet lanes today you can still see stones inscribed with the words ‘to the quays’. One of these can be found near the old tollhouse at Rock, while another situated along the road to Bere Alston points to Gawton Quay. In the restored village school room there is a series of long benches that most people will recognise from their school days as being called forms. Every child was taught in the same room – no matter what their age. So in order to distinguish between them, the children in their first year would sit on the front bench, known as the first form; the second year pupils would sit on the second form and so on. There are, however, very few forms in the school room, because many children born to mining families before the Education Acts of 1876 left school and began work at around eight years of age. The realisation that such young children were engaged in so dangerous and frightening an occupation illustrates the point that, for most people at Morwellham, life was more about survival than enjoyment. It was a hard, cruel existence, a continual struggle, and each job on oﬀer presented its own dangers. Without doubt the most dangerous job was that of the copper miners themselves, who worked in cramped and dirty conditions. First there were dangers posed by the mine, which included roof falls and flooding. Some of the mines went deep underground, even going beneath the river, and flooding could happen almost without warning. The water was polluted due to unsanitary conditions, often spreading viral diseases. To combat this, a large waterwheel – similar to those used at mills – was installed in the mine to pump water out of the tunnels. Long ladders would have to be negotiated while carrying heavy equipment, resulting in regular falls. Prolonged work in poorly lit conditions led to many sight defects, in severe cases even blindness. Others were blinded by flying rock fragments. Apparently an early form of Braille was developed in the nearby mining community of Bere Alston. The noise of underground explosions and drilling caused deafness. And perhaps worst of all was the dusty atmosphere, which when breathed into the lungs caused extreme respiratory problems, even premature death. So all in all, mines of any description were not very pleasant places in which to work. 8\n\nlost villages aw.indd 16\n\n3/4/08 11:21:58\n\na l o st v illage li v es again\n\nTo extract copper, the early miners would heat the rock and then pour cold water over the heated surface, causing the rock to crack and making it easier to hammer out the ore. The process was improved with the arrival of gunpowder, which would be packed into natural cracks in the rock or into cavities specially carved out for the purpose. However, these explosions proved to be very dangerous, often causing cave-ins and generating massive amounts of dust. Fuses made from straw or quills combined with small amounts of gunpowder were used to trigger these explosions. As one can imagine they were extremely unreliable and premature explosions caused many deaths. The safety fuse of 1831, which was a length of cord filled with gunpowder, improved things greatly. During the 1860s, a compressed air drill operated by two people was introduced. An adult miner would do the drilling, while one of the younger boys, perhaps even one of the eight-years-olds, would hold the drill steady. While drills such as these certainly improved productivity – and the wealth of the mine owners – they had terrible consequences on the health of their operators. Standing next to the drill and holding it for hours on end caused many of the boys to be profoundly deaf by the age of 20. The drill would also cause clouds of thick, choking dust. Neither the man nor the lad would be likely to live beyond 40, and because of this the air drill was nicknamed the ‘Widow Maker’. Miners would remain underground for their entire working day (often for 10 or 12 hours) and during the winter months would only see sunlight once a week – on Sunday. Lunch at the mines of western Devon, similar to those of Cornwall, would have been a pasty. Within the pastry case, a traditional miner’s pasty would have meat and vegetables in one end and fruit or jam in the other, thus presenting a two course meal. The miner’s wife or mother would mark the crust with his initials, so that he would know which end was which at lunchtime. These pasties were eaten in the dim light whilst sitting on a rock with filthy hands, as there were no washing facilities below ground. Often the thick pastry rim, contaminated by the miner’s dirty hands, would be thrown away at the end of the meal. Things were marginally better for those working on the surface, many of whom were young girls and women known as bal maidens. The word ‘bal’ derives from an old Cornish word for mine, and the maidens were often as young as eight or nine. Normally, married women did not work at the mines, so the workforce comprised of 9\n\nlost villages aw.indd 17\n\n3/4/08 11:21:58\n\nthe l o st v illages\n\nyoung unmarried women and widows. Their job was to dress the ore, which involved separating the metal from rocks that had been brought up to the surface from the mine. At diﬀerent sites along the Tamar, processes varied depending on the metal being extracted, but as a general rule the work of the bal maidens fell into one of three categories: sorting, washing and transporting; mechanical breaking; and the separation of finer ores by sedimentation techniques. The various jobs were allocated according to age but they were all physically demanding and required high levels of skill and strength. The ore would first be washed and sorted by the very youngest girls, according to its weight and appearance. Young teenagers would then sieve the rock through boxes called jigs that would separate out the medium sized portions of copper ore. The older females would do the backbreaking work of spalling, cobbing and bucking. All three of these involved the use of hammers to break up the rock. During spalling, with an aptly named spalling hammer, the rock would be broken into fist sized pieces; a cobbing hammer would break it into marble sized chunks; and bucking would involve grinding the smallest pieces into almost powder form. Bal maidens had a distinctive dress style, wearing steel tipped shoes or clogs and a bonnet known as a gook that covered much of their face and shoulders. This was their only protection against flying shards or the winter weather through which they continued to toil. They also wore an apron called a towser and those that could aﬀord them would have two. One was worn while walking to and from the mines to try and look decent, while the other was put on for working at the dressing floors. This sounds a very drab uniform but it shows that against a background of adversity they took pride in their appearance. There is also evidence to suggest that bal maidens could be quite gay and colourful. When Queen Victoria visited the Duke of Bedford at Endsleigh, his summer retreat in 1856, she arrived at Morwellham Quay by paddle steamer from Plymouth and continued her journey by coach along the Duke’s riverside drive, which can still be seen in part today. The bal maidens gathered at the quay to greet the Queen, wearing bonnets festooned with diﬀerent coloured ribbons. Victoria was so moved by the sight that she reputedly asked for some of the ribbons as a keepsake. Both miners and bal maidens were poorly paid. At the end of the nineteenth century a miner would earn around 15 shillings a 10\n\nlost villages aw.indd 18\n\n3/4/08 11:21:59\n\nA L o S T v I L L AG E L I v E S AG A I N\n\nMorwellhamQuayphotographedin1906,withthequaysand docksdeserted PhotographcourtesyofMorwellhamandTamarValleyTrust\n\nVillagechildrenplayingonMorwellham’sdesertedHigherCopper Quayaround1914 PhotographcourtesyofMorwellhamandTamarValleyTrust\n\n11\n\nlost villages aw.indd 19\n\n3/4/08 11:22:10\n\nT H E L o S T v I L L AG E S\n\nThisphotographfromanunknownmineprovidesagood illustrationoftheclotheswornbybalmaidensandotherworkers PhotographcourtesyofMorwellhamandTamarValleyTrust\n\n12\n\nlost villages aw.indd 20\n\n3/4/08 11:22:16\n\na l o st v illage li v es again\n\nweek and a bal maiden roughly six or seven. Everyone worked from Monday to Saturday lunchtime, and the only holidays were Christmas Day, Good Friday, and possibly the parish feast day. On Midsummer’s Day the mines were spring-cleaned and the workforce was permitted to leave early. They were also given money to spend at the Midsummer Fair. This presumably was considered as a bonus but for men it usually amounted to around 12 pence, and for the women about six pence. Many people worked on the quayside, loading copper ore onto the boats that would ferry it down the river towards Plymouth. From the mine area to the quay, the ore was loaded onto trucks that were pushed by hand on an inclined railway. At the quay, the trucks were unhitched and taken to a siding, from where their cargo would be unloaded by hand and stacked in piles ready for the next boat. These workers were paid one penny for every tonne they loaded and unloaded on the quay, and made an estimated 10 shillings a week – not as much as the miners but certainly more than the bal maidens and other surface workers. One of the most important men in the village was the assayer, who managed the quayside. One aspect of his job was to test ore samples to ascertain the quality of the copper. He did this in a laboratory where, after crushing the ore into powder and adding various chemicals, it was burnt to see how much metal would remain. From this he was able to put a price on the ore as it stacked up on the quayside. At the height of productivity every available space at the quays was crammed with copper ore awaiting shipment, and those at neighbouring places such as Newquay and Gawton. The assayer worked long hours, both testing the ore and managing the quayside, for which he received around £4 a week. Compared to miners and bal maidens, this was a huge amount of money, so he was able to live in some style. He would have been well-educated, and also had assistant samplers that were paid around £1 a week: such jobs were highly prized in a mining community. At Morwellham Quay, the reconstructed cottages oﬀer stark comparisons between the relative luxury of the assayer and the squalid conditions in which the miners lived. The assayer’s house had a large kitchen, which doubled up as an oﬃce; a parlour; two bedrooms; and a scullery. The parlour was rarely used other than for entertaining guests, so the kitchen with its table and chairs was the hub of household activity. For cooking, the large fireplace had an integrated oven or ‘range’. The room would also have a 13\n\nlost villages aw.indd 21\n\n3/4/08 11:22:16\n\nthe l o st v illages\n\nWelsh dresser displaying decorative china and many utensils that miners could never aﬀord, such as a skimmer for making cream, a potato masher and a marmalade slicer, used to cut up fruit. There would also have been a meat press for tenderising diﬀerent joints, as well as a great variety of pots, pans, jars and metal cutlery. In the scullery would be the copper for boiling the clothes, the poshy tub and long handled posser used to agitate all the washing, a mangle, and several flat irons. Both bedrooms in the assayer’s house were upstairs and had comfortable beds with sheets and blankets for all the family. The miner’s cottage normally had a bed for the husband and wife, but the rest of the family, which included numerous children and sometimes even grandparents and lodgers, would sleep on sacking on the floor. The cottage usually comprised of three small downstairs rooms in which a dozen or more people would often live. There was a small fireplace in the living room on which a metal rack was used for cooking. The family might own a metal kettle to boil water and a tin in which to cook their diet of stodgy food, mainly potatoes and turnips. Most families reared a pig, which was kept in a sty at the back of the house behind the outside lavatories until it was ready for butchering. With so many people in a confined space, and with non-flushing toilets and pigs near the back door, the smell was very unpleasant in summer, and flies would have been a serious problem. But by 1900, the massive lode of copper ore at Morewellham was all but exhausted and the mines were systematically closing down. The pumps of the Devonshire Great Consolidated Mining Company finally stopped working in 1901. The now extensive rail network linking Tavistock to every part of Britain meant there was little point in using either the canal or the River Tamar to transport what little ore remained. Remnants of the mining industry around Tavistock and Dartmoor survived until the 1920s, but Morwellham Quay had served its purpose and the population began to move away. As well as the school, the village had two chapels, one Wesleyan and the other United Methodist Free Church. There were also large lime kilns, a smithy, hotel, cooperage, wainright, and shop – all the trappings of a successful community. The Duke of Bedford paid for the building of many of the cottages himself to cater for the growing population, including some of those which are now open to the public. But by the time of the First World War, the village 14\n\nlost villages aw.indd 22\n\n3/4/08 11:22:17\n\nA L o S T v I L L AG E L I v E S AG A I N\n\nJaneMartin’sslate-hungshopphotographedabout1914,which soldcreamteastoday-tripperswhovisitedMorwellhamQuay bypaddle-steamerfromPlymouth PhotographcourtesyofMorwellhamandTamarValleyTrust\n\nThisphotographtakenin1986showsthelimeburner’scottagewith itsrestorationnearingcompletion.Thiswasoneofseveralruined buildingsatMorwellhamQuaythathavebeenrestoredforfuture generationstounderstandhowtheirancestorslived PhotographcourtesyofMorwellhamandTamarValleyTrust\n\n15\n\nlost villages aw.indd 23\n\n3/4/08 11:22:26\n\nthe l o st v illages\n\nwas already practically deserted and the majority of properties had fallen into disrepair. Morwellham Quay was one of a series of forgotten villages and hamlets situated along both banks of the River Tamar, such as Newquay, Gawton, Calstock, Halton Quay, and Weir Quay, some of which went into terminal decline. So its reconstruction could be considered representative of several lost communities from all over west Devon and east Cornwall. Throughout its history, even during its busiest period in the 1860s, industry and agriculture worked side by side in the Tamar Valley. Agriculture ultimately prevailed and, as the nineteenth century ended and the twentieth century began, the area had reverted from a hectic centre of Victorian industrialisation back to the peaceful rural valley that existed before the arrival of the Benedictine monks. In such a tranquil and picturesque setting, it is now hard to imagine the frantic activity and the thousands of people who had lived and worked here: thriving communities now resigned to the pages of history.\n\n16\n\nlost villages aw.indd 24\n\n3/4/08 11:22:26\n\nThe virtual abandonment of thriving communities, as a result of the closure of local mines around the turn of the twentieth century, was certainly not unique to the Tamar Valley. Some communities, although suﬀering economic hardship and a degree of population loss as people moved to find alternative employment, survived by replacing mining with other industrial enterprises. Others survived because their geographical location enabled the inhabitants to commute to neighbouring settlements in order to find work. In mid-Wales, on a remote road between Machynlleth and Llanidloes, in a windswept wilderness of mountains and moorland, you will still find a few houses collectively known as Dylife. Similar to Morwellham Quay, these houses are the remnants of a once important mining community, which was abandoned around 100 years ago. It evolved over the centuries from a group of scattered farmsteads into a bustling village of the Victorian age supporting around 1,000 souls, complete with parish church, post oﬃce, school and smithy. At one time the excavations here were regarded as the glory of the Montgomeryshire mines until their importance was eclipsed by those at Van, to the south-east. But unlike numerous other mining villages, it was Dylife’s very remoteness that ushered its downfall, because when the mines closed it was too distant from any other sources of employment to make it sustainable. Lead mining at Dylife had begun as early as the Roman occupation. At Pen y Crogben, a stone’s throw to the south, there was a Roman road and fortlet. In the surrounding area there is evidence to suggest that both copper and lead ore were being mined as far back as the Bronze Age. Before its dramatic growth in the nineteenth century, Dylife was most famous – or perhaps 17\n\nlost villages aw.indd 25\n\n3/4/08 11:22:26\n\nT H E L o S T v I L L AG E S\n\nDylifephotographedinthelatenineteenthcentury,withRhodGoch atthecentreandminers’cottagesseeninthedistance PhotographcourtesyofPowyslandMuseum\n\nTheremainsofSiônJones,nowondisplay inStFagansNationalHistoryMuseum, nearCardiff PhotographcourtesyofStephenFisk\n\n18\n\nlost villages aw.indd 26\n\n3/4/08 11:22:34\n\nfr o m riches t o rags\n\ninfamous – for the brutal murders of three people: a woman and her two children. During the early eighteenth century, people were already beginning to move into the area in search of employment. One such person was a blacksmith from Ystumtuen in Cardiganshire, named Siôn Jones, who arrived in Dylife around 1719, leaving his wife and children at home. Soon after his arrival he began to have an aﬀair with a local woman, a maid at Llwyn y Gog, a short distance away, who he subsequently married. Several weeks later his wife paid him an unexpected visit, bringing his two children on foot to spend a few days with him. The two areas were joined by rough tracks skirting the mountain of Plynlimon, which provides the sources of both the rivers Wye and Severn. On their return journey, Jones murdered them and threw their bodies down a disused mineshaft at Dyfngwm, a short way to the south-west. Some time later, three workmen who had been sent to Dyfngwm to retrieve some of the old timbers that were going to waste in the mineshaft made the gruesome discovery of the three bodies. Siôn Jones was arrested and put on trial for the murder of his wife and children. and, having been found guilty he was ordered – as the village blacksmith – to make his own hanging frame. On the day of his execution he was taken to Pen y Crogben, the site of the old Roman fortlet where, with the frame suspended from a gallows, he was obliged to sit on the back of a horse until the animal was made to move forward. In 1938, the landowner Will Richards, himself an ex-miner, unearthed part of an iron frame and a skull. These are now on display at St Fagans National History Museum, near Cardiﬀ, where the skull is claimed to be that of the murderous Siôn Jones. The modern history of Dylife really begins around 1800, at which time most of the land in the area was owned by Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, who was reputed to own so much of Wales that he could travel to Machynlleth from his home in Wrexham without leaving his own property. In 1814, he leased the land at Dylife to Hugh Williams and John Pughe, two men from Machynlleth who had latterly managed the mines. Although these two individuals were largely responsible for the surging success of these mining operations, they had an uneasy working relationship. It had taken them five years to negotiate the terms of the lease. Stephen Fisk, who has researched the village explains: 19\n\nlost villages aw.indd 27\n\n3/4/08 11:22:34\n\nthe l o st v illages\n\nhe signing of the lease was delayed because they failed to T produce satisfactory financial accounts and articles of partnership that would govern their working relationship. They obtained the lease in 1814, and they and their successors continued to operate the mines until the 1850s. But through- out this period financial management continued to be unsatisfactory, and there were repeated diﬃculties in relations between the two lease holders. When there was a need to purchase new equipment, for example, both men would pay half the cost. Employees were paid twice a week, on separate days, receiving half their wages from Williams and half from Pughe. There was resentment between the two men, with Williams taking the view that Pughe was devoting much less time and energy to the management of the mines than he was.\n\nDisagreements aside, the mines were extremely profitable and, as well as lead, they yielded significant quantities of copper, zinc and silver. New shafts were dug and machinery was brought in to assist with pumping, drawing, crushing the ore, and extracting the lead. Much of this machinery was powered by a series of massive waterwheels: most spectacularly Rhod Goch, or the Red Wheel. Erected in 1851, it had a diameter of 63 feet and a width of three and a half feet. It was unquestionably one of the largest waterwheels in Britain at the time, possibly second only to the Lady Isabella on the Isle of Man. But not all of this machinery was powered by water: for instance, a blowing machine, which aided ventilation, was operated by young lads turning a handle. So the overall operation was a mixture of new and old technologies, mechanisation and manpower. Headstones in the churchyard indicated that many of Dylife’s male population died between the ages of 36 and 40, but similar to the Tamar Valley, children as young as eight would have been employed in various roles. Where the mining operation at Dylife did lose some of its profitability was in the transportation of the lead ore to the smelters, at places like Bristol, Chester and Liverpool. Morwellham Quay was ideally placed and able to use the River Tamar as its transport artery, but Dylife sat in the remote mountains of mid-Wales. The ore therefore had to be transported across rough mountain tracks to the port of Derwenlas, near the mouth of the River Dyfi, some 12 miles away. Here it was loaded on to ships for delivery to the smelters. 20\n\nlost villages aw.indd 28\n\n3/4/08 11:22:35\n\nfr o m riches t o rags\n\nIn order to transport the ore to Derwenlas, Williams and Pughe employed local farmers to use their horse drawn carts. Even this caused problems, as the roads were narrow and winding, and in the droving season they would encounter herds of cattle and flocks of sheep coming in the opposite direction. The drovers would utilise mountain passes that took them through Dylife and on towards mid-Wales, and England beyond. They would stay overnight at the Drop Inn, which was situated at the western end of the village, and they would have shoes put on the cattle at Rhyd y Porthmyn farm, before continuing their journey. At such times the local farmers would no doubt have mixed loyalties, as they were able to make money from both the drovers and the mining company. In 1852, an article in the Mining Journal noted that celebrations were held at Dylife for the wedding of the landowner, the current Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, at which time around 300 people lived in the village. On 28 April, all employees of the mining company were invited to a party to celebrate the occasion and, according to the article, they were supplied with tea, coﬀee and cold meat. It was reported that the mountain of Plynlimon, overlooking the scene, resounded with hilarity and song, despite the absence of any alcohol. Wedding celebrations aside, these were not particularly happy times for Dylife, as the relationship between Williams and Pughe continued to decline. But the fortunes of the village were soon to take an upturn after the men agreed that their best solution was to sell the mines. At this point, Richard Cobden appears on the scene, one of Britain’s most eminent politicians and the man who had famously led the opposition to the Corn Laws. Cobden, who was married to the youngest daughter of Hugh Williams, played a major part in the sale of the mines and the creation of a new company to administer them. In partnership with another senior politician, John Bright, Cobden persuaded a group of Manchester businessmen to buy shares in the new company, and the Dylife Mining Company Limited was registered on 7 July 1858, under the chairmanship of Bright himself. All of this was good news for both the village and the mines. Stephen Fisk notes that:\n\nithin a few years the new company had done a great deal to W develop the operation of the mines. New shafts were dug vertically so that cages could be installed to lower and raise the 21\n\nlost villages aw.indd 29\n\n3/4/08 11:22:35\n\nthe l o st v illages\n\nminers and to bring up the wagons containing ore. In other lead mines at that time miners would descend at an angle by ladder, and the ore was still being drawn up in large buckets known as kibbles. Another waterwheel was put in place to provide power to a system of metal ropes that transported ore over a mile from two mine shafts to the dressing floors. Changing rooms were provided, Dylife being the only mine in mid-Wales, north Wales, or Shropshire to have such a facility. Transportation remained the company’s only major concern. However, in 1864, the problem of getting ore quickly and eﬃciently to the smelters was resolved when the railway arrived at the village of Llanbrynmair on the line that joined Aberystwyth to Shrewsbury. Llanbrynmair was only eight miles from Dylife and the road to it was much better than the mountain track to Derwenlas. For most of its length it also followed a gentle downward slope. By now the village had established a true sense of community. It was no longer regarded as just a place where outsiders came to secure employment. It now had its own identity, where much of the population could trace their ancestors back several generations – and the village was still growing. Welsh mining communities were very religious and a diversity of denominations were catered for by several chapels. An Independent chapel had existed at Dylife for some time, before a Methodist one was opened in 1841; a Baptist chapel in 1852; and finally, St David’s Anglican church arrived in 1856. The following year both a vicarage and school were opened. Cottages were scattered throughout the area of the mines. In particular, there were rows of cottages and allotments towards the western end of the village at Rhanc-y-myndd, and others at the eastern end known as Bryn Golau. The new mining company built many houses to accommodate its employees, and it also paid £25 a year towards the costs of the school. By 1864, the population was teetering around the 1,000 mark. There were three hostelries in the village: the Llwyn y Grug Inn, the Star Inn, and the Drop Inn. The innkeeper at the Llwyn y Grug also ran a grocery and a butcher’s shop, and there was a post oﬃce and a smithy. For entertainment, there was a monthly fair at which traders from Machynlleth, Llanidloes and Llanbrynmair would set up stalls. The fair at Llanbrynmair was particularly known for cobbling. Another form of popular entertainment was cockfighting 22\n\nlost villages aw.indd 30\n\n3/4/08 11:22:35\n\nF R o M R I C H E S T o R AG S\n\nMuchofDylife’sminingmachinerywaspoweredbyenormous waterwheels,includingRhodGoch,ortheRedWheel,seenhere.

At Dylife, or any other mining village for that matter, there were many health concerns. However, there was little access to doctors for the ordinary working man, most of whom died tragically young. At Dylife there would undoubtedly have been a high incidence of lead poisoning, not only in the miners but in those working above ground on the dressing floors. Stephen Fisk notes:\n\nhe inhabitants of Dylife would have absorbed lead through T the food they ate, the water they drank, the air they breathed, and the soil and dust they touched. Once inside the human body lead inflicts severe damage on the production of blood, the internal organs, the enzyme systems, the nervous system, and the brain. At high levels lead will cause coma, convulsions and death.\n\nThe mines at Dylife reached their highest level of production in 1862, when 2,571 tonnes of lead ore were sold and profits of about £1,000 a month were made. After this the productivity of the mines steadily declined, as did the price of lead, and in 1873 the Manchester businessmen decided to sell up. During the next decade two other companies attempted to maintain some informal mining until 1886; and from that year to 1901 a local man, Even Evans, continued to coordinate a limited amount of production, employing 20 to 30 men. Evans invested in the building of a tram road, proving that he had both imagination and a vision of a future for the village. However, he lacked the necessary capital to maintain the mines, the tram, and all the other associated paraphernalia. So, in 1901, the mines finally closed. And with nobody else stepping forward to continue production, they soon became flooded and abandoned. As a new century dawned, yet another village was being lost and its inhabitants were faced with the cruel decision of either remaining to eke out what existence they could from agriculture, or uprooting for a better life elsewhere. Many headed for the United States, following a pattern of emigration that had begun earlier in the nineteenth century. On one day alone, it is recorded that 99 people left Llanbrynmair, bound for America. Other people, especially those with additional skills, sought employment in the coal mines of South Wales or England. A few people carried on living at Dylife after 1901. In 1921, there were 12 pupils on the school 24\n\nlost villages aw.indd 32\n\n3/4/08 11:22:46\n\nfr o m riches t o rags\n\nregister, but in 1925 the school was closed. The last marriage at St David’s church took place in 1915, with the last christening in 1926. The church was demolished in 1962. Abandoned cottages fell into ruin and slowly disappeared from the landscape. No doubt their stonework was removed to enhance the walls of local farms. Two of the chapels were converted into private houses, which still exist today. Another surviving building of interest is the Star Inn, which continues to provide refreshments, meals and overnight accommodation. The Glyndwr Way, a long-distance walk that cuts across the middle of Wales, passes very close to the remnants of Dylife. As well as a mere handful of surviving properties, you can still discern the shadows of several other buildings; disused mine workings; the pits where the great waterwheels once stood; reservoirs, and the leats that carried water down to the village and mines. In places the path follows the route taken by the farmers as they took their horse drawn carts laden with lead ore towards the port of Derwenlas. The walk, however, does not go as far as the port and diverges into the town of Machynlleth, where in 1404 Owain Glyndwr convened a Welsh parliament and proclaimed himself Prince of Wales.\n\n25\n\nlost villages aw.indd 33\n\n3/4/08 11:22:46\n\nT H E L o S T v I L L AG E S\n\nTheghostlyremainsofoneofaseriesofcottagesdottedaround theareaofStokeBottom.Thisonecanbefoundverynearthe disusedquarry\n\n26\n\nlost villages aw.indd 34\n\n3/4/08 11:22:51\n\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, tiny hamlets and villages existed all over the rural landscape, as the power of water was harnessed to turn the wheels of industry – albeit on a very localised and small scale. Rivers everywhere provided the power for mills and factories, many of which were isolated concerns, the ruins of which can be found on riverbanks the length and breadth of Britain. Others nestled at the heart of tiny communities, so small in fact that even though they might only have disappeared relatively recently in historical terms, there is little available information about them. One such village was Stoke Bottom in the Mendip Hills of Somerset, near the coal mining town of Radstock. Although this was largely a coal mining area, the local craft at Stoke Bottom was papermaking. Today, you can still see traditional papermaking processes being practiced at the nearby Wookey Hole paper mill. Particulars of the Wookey Hole mill published in 1858 stated that:\n\nThe Mill is placed at the head of the River Axe, which takes its rise in the Mendip Hills, and percolates through the rock into the mill-head, which is a reservoir of considerable extent formed in a natural cavern under the hill. The stream has a fall of 40 feet, and gives power equal to 40 horses by means of a Turbine waterwheel.\n\nPapermaking was a traditional art in this area of Somerset, but the mill at Wookey Hole became so successful that many of its smaller competitors in the surrounding area were forced to close. The skilled papermakers from other settlements would then walk daily 27\n\nlost villages aw.indd 35\n\n3/4/08 11:22:52\n\nthe l o st v illages\n\nto Wookey in order to secure employment. We can only surmise as to whether or not this situation helped to bring about the decline of Stoke Bottom, but evidently while some villages flourished and grew, others slowly disappeared from the landscape. If you visit the lost village today you will find the ruins of what appears to be the mill itself and several cottages, both in the woods by Stoke Bottom Farm, and by crossing a field to a lane where there are further cottages near a disused quarry. Local people rumour that some of the cottages were still in occupation as late as the 1960s or even 1970s, but nobody seems really certain of the facts. There was also a local Georgian mansion house called Stoke House, set in its own landscaped gardens, which is said to have been abandoned around 1905. The mansion house itself, which was demolished before the Second World War, was reputed to be haunted by a young lady of the house who is said to have thrown herself out of an upstairs bedroom window after suﬀering from a broken heart. Therefore, Stoke Bottom truly is a ‘ghost village’ in more than one respect. On the other side of Somerset in the upland region between Exmoor and the Brendon Hills is another lost village of which similarly very little is known. Today, the ghostly remains of a small village known as Clicket – little more than a hamlet – can be found just outside the Luxborough parish boundary. In a remote and often gloomy valley, you will discover the remains of a mill and several cottages, one of which is larger than the rest and is believed to have been a meeting house. As well as buildings, a search through the undergrowth reveals the site of the waterwheel, two millstones, and a tiny picturesque packhorse bridge, still in very good condition. All around the area natural springs of water in the hillsides create little rivulets known as ‘goyals’ to Exmoor people. The main stream into which these goyals flow is the Chernet River, which runs through the area where the village once stood and along the valley to Timberscombe. As well as the mill itself, there are the remains of a weir and a millpond. Boundary walls appear to have ancient hedge beech trees growing out of them, one of which is reputed to be among the largest in the county, although Clicket is not actually as ancient as the ruinous scene might suggest. Clicket is in a deep valley to the south of Timberscombe. There are no actual roads leading to it, so the best approach is to drive up from Dunster towards Luxborough. This will take you through 28\n\nlost villages aw.indd 36\n\n3/4/08 11:22:52\n\nT H E P ow E R o F wAT E R\n\nPartofthelostSomersetandDorsetCanal,veryneartheghost villageofStokeBottomintheMendipHillsofSomerset.This ambitiousschemewouldhavelinkedBathtoChristchurch,but only13mileswereevercompleted.Thesectioninthephotograph wouldhavegonefromNettlebridgetoFromealongtheMellsvalley, andalookonamapillustrateshowinvaluablethatwouldhave beentothepapermillatStokeBottom\n\n29\n\nlost villages aw.indd 37\n\n3/4/08 11:22:58\n\nT H E L o S T v I L L AG E S\n\nAtWookeyHolepaperwashungoverhairropesorlaidflaton hessianinthedryinglofts.Theventilationshuttersneeded skilledregulation PhotographreproducedfromWookeyHoleguidebookwiththepermissionofDanielMedley, generalmanager,WookeyHoleCaves\n\n30\n\nlost villages aw.indd 38\n\n3/4/08 11:23:06\n\nthe p ow er o f water\n\na large wooded area of plantations, known as Croydon Hill, the summit of which is Bat’s Castle standing at 365 metres – not to be confused with Bat’s Castle Settlement to the east, which presents a lost village from an earlier age. Along the road, as you begin your descent, there is an Exmoor National Park fingerpost pointing the way to Clicket through a field gate on the right. You can also drive on towards Nurcott Farm and find a suitable car park, and there is also some parking on the path above Thorne Farm. There are several footpaths but an Ordnance Survey map is essential, from which you will see a network of well-worn, centuries old tracks that would have been used by drovers, lime burners, quarrymen, school children and farmers bringing their corn to and from Clicket Mill. Alternatively, the remains actually lie within the grounds of Allercott Farm, where you can rent holiday cottages and explore the valley at leisure. So although there is a series of public footpaths, be aware that some of the village is on private property. It might seem improbable now but 100 years ago Clicket was a busy little community, which had probably been in existence for around 400 years. In 1851, the census recorded a miller and five other families; about 40 people in total. Most of the men were farm labourers, although one is recorded as being a quarryman who worked at Allercott quarry, while another was marked down as being a lumberman. It is easy to see how timber provided a source of employment in the village, as the valley is bordered by substantial plantations. Also, the Ordnance Survey map reveals disused quarries liberally strewn over quite a wide surrounding area, while of course farming was the lifeblood of many lush Exmoor valleys. There are also lime kilns in the local landscape. So, from the census, we can deduce that the community existed and thrived for a number of reasons other than simply because of the existence of the mill. Over the years, Clicket Mill has been referred to by several names, including Hydron and Beckham, and at the time of the 1851 census, the miller was a certain William Langdon. It was certainly in existence during Elizabethan times. As well as the mill building itself, the remains of the miller’s house can still be seen and it was here that Langdon lived with his wife and five children. Apparently, the household also supported his simple sister-in-law and a 14year-old servant boy, called James Gadd. Clicket Mill was a corn mill to which local farmers would have sent their corn to be ground by the miller. They would have sent 31\n\nlost villages aw.indd 39\n\n3/4/08 11:23:06\n\nthe l o st v illages\n\ntheir produce by pack animal along the various pack horse trails. These animals would normally have been donkeys or horses; or possibly oxen may have sometimes been employed. Because of the steep valley terrain, it is very unlikely that heavy farm carts were ever used in such operations. Langdon himself had two donkeys of his own called Dick and Short, which provided a collection service to some farmers. They would negotiate the valley tracks to nearby farms and pick up any corn that required milling. It was said that they knew the route so well that they were able to do this unattended, although it is more likely that the young James Gadd would have kept a watchful eye on the situation. After milling, the resultant flour, or ‘middlings’ as some of it was known, would have been loaded into panniers and returned along the same paths. But there is no doubt that as with papermaking at Stoke Bottom, small corn mills would slowly have gone out of business as they were unable to compete with larger concerns that oﬀered better facilities and mechanisation. Clicket’s diﬃcult terrain and uneasy access would have made it less appealing to farmers in the modern age as well. So, around 1900, the mill finally fell silent and was abandoned, quickly falling into disrepair. From then until the First World War, it became the playground of local children, but its last residents were an elderly couple who had been evicted from their cottage. Sadly, with nowhere else to go, they took refuge in the old mill and lived there for about a year in a building with no windows or doors. To them, this was preferable than being forced to live at the poorhouse at Williton, which was considered to be a humiliation for the independent people of Exmoor. But eventually the old man died and it is believed that his wife finally succumbed to the poorhouse, where she lived out the rest of her days. Of the other buildings in the village it is recorded that the remains of the larger house at Clicket was a meeting house. Whether or not it was also a family home at the same time is unsure, although it almost certainly would have been. There was no church or chapel in the village, the nearest being at either Timberscombe or Luxborough Churchtown. So religious gatherings would have been held periodically at the meeting house, evidence of at least one of which is known from a magazine of the Bible Christians from 1851. It was recorded by Pastor S. Crocker that around 70 people attended the meeting. As the village supported only 40, it is assumed that 32\n\nlost villages aw.indd 40\n\n3/4/08 11:23:06\n\nT H E P ow E R o F wAT E R\n\nAmillstoneamongstthefoliageofClicket,whereoncestooda thrivingcornmill PhotographcourtesyofDennisCorner\n\nAgroupoframblersstopandlookattheruinsofClicket,andenjoy thesolitudeofalocationthatwasonceabustlinghiveofactivity PhotographcourtesyofDennisCorner\n\n33\n\nlost villages aw.indd 41\n\n3/4/08 11:23:15\n\nthe l o st v illages\n\nthe remainder of this congregation would almost certainly have been drawn from the local farming community. Edward Cording, who presided over the meeting, was a farmer himself who farmed along the valley towards Timberscombe Common at Croydon. It is therefore probable that some of the farm labourers dwelling at Clicket would have been in his employ. At this meeting, the gathered throng enjoyed addresses delivered by Pastor Crocker and brethren Conibeer and Hicks. It was described as a “tea meeting on behalf of the Missionary Society,” and Pastor Crocker wrote that it had been a “blessed meeting, and the friends exerted themselves nobly.” A collection for the Missionary Society amounted to one pound, thirteen shillings and three pence. Bible Christians, or Bryanite preachers, had first entered this part of west Somerset in the early 1820s, led by a lady called Mary Mason, known as the Maiden Preacher. They established cottage fellowships for prayer and preaching, and this was undoubtedly what was taking place at Clicket. One of the most important fellowships in the area was started in the shopkeeper’s cottage at Timberscombe. Edward Cording and his elder brother, James, arrived on the scene in 1833. Their father John had been a prosperous farmer at Bathealton who had moved to Upton in 1817. John had become involved with the new Bryanite preachers and his two sons were inspired by his enthusiasm and became preachers themselves. After the death of John, the two brothers obtained the lease of the manor and farm called Croydon Hall. This house sat along the side of the valley below Timberscombe on the way to Clicket, so for the next 60 years passing preachers were always welcome and Clicket would have been a regular place for cottage meetings. Edward was very much responsible for building a chapel in Timberscombe, which was opened in 1836. James died at the end of 1836 but Edward lived until 1886. He was a local preacher for 52 years and circuit steward from 1840 to 1869. He gave up farming at Croydon in 1876 and went to live at Timberscombe in a house he had built himself, just opposite the chapel. However, by 1900, attendance at the chapel had dropped away, and the reasons for this mirror the situation at Clicket: basically, economic depression and depopulation was beginning to take their toll. Local mines and slate quarries were closing and the reports from the circuit pastors spoke of young people, often entire families, moving away to seek a better life elsewhere. In 1907, the Bible Christian Church became part of the United Methodist Church, and in 1932 this 34\n\nlost villages aw.indd 42\n\n3/4/08 11:23:15\n\nthe p ow er o f water\n\namalgamated with the Wesleyans and the Primitives to become the present day Methodist Church, and a chapel is still going strong in Timberscombe today. Other social activities at Clicket are known to have included a juvenile band and an annual club walk on Whit Monday, complete with floral staves. But as well as having no church or chapel, the village had no shops, the nearest being at Luxborough. Nor did Clicket have a school, so the children had to walk each day along the valley track to Timberscombe, following the route of the stream. This journey took them through South Cleeve Grove, Black Well Wood, and past Bougam Farm. It was a distance of nearly two miles through diﬃcult terrain, against the uncertainty of Exmoor’s notorious weather. A sunny aspect during the walk to school in the morning could have turned into a torrential downpour by the time of the return journey in the afternoon. And as the fog on Exmoor is legendary, the necessity to stick together and be aware of their surroundings would have been drummed into the children at a very young age. In the 1851 census, there were nine children described as ‘scholars’, although some of these were infrequent attendees. In an article for the West Somerset Free Press, local historian Hilary Binding quoted an entry in the Timberscombe school logbook from October 1879 which said that a certain John Webber from Clicket (spelt Clicott) had called at the schoolhouse on account of a summons he had received. At this meeting he was informed of the poor school attendance of his two sons, Edwin and Jesse. Edwin had only attended 14 times during the Harvest Quarter and in another period, out of a possible 140 days, he had only attended on 41 occasions. And as if that was not bad enough, Mr Webber was then told that during the same period Jesse had only attended on 33 occasions. Hilary Binding also wrote of a photograph in her possession, which illustrates some of the last people to live in Clicket. “The men are clearly working men but they have a rakish air,” she wrote. “One sports a chequered tie, watch chain and straw boater above the apron which points to him being the miller. I have been told that another of the men in the photograph had to leave the country fairly quickly following a brawl in which a man was killed.” In the Somerset County archives, the last census of the nineteenth century mentions Kiln Close and Quarry Close, which supports the idea that Clicket was more of a village than the 35\n\nlost villages aw.indd 43\n\n3/4/08 11:23:15\n\nthe l o st v illages\n\nscattered remnants we see today might suggest. It also records the names of people who lived there, names that are still commonplace in the area, among them: James Hole, the Reverend Henry John Taylor, John Cole, Martin Williams, James Williams, Robert Tarr, and Ursula Tarr. The latter causes us to immediately think of one of Exmoor’s best loved landmarks, the Tarr Steps which ford the River Barle near Liscombe. As for when the last people left the village, little is known, although several sources tell of a lady from Clicket who, during the 1950s, walked to work each day from the village to Porlock on the Somerset coast, a journey of at least seven miles, depending on her route. This would have been a gruelling and hilly journey, the most likely route of which would have taken her through Timberscombe, Wooton Courtenay, Huntscott, Luccombe and Horner. The return journey at the end of the long working day would have been even worse, as it was an upward climb for much of the way. The record of one Clicket lady was printed as an obituary in a local paper. The date of the piece and the journal are unsure, although it was probably printed around 1977 in the West Somerset Free Press. However, this obituary recorded the death of Mrs Lily E. Bryant, and states:\n\nNews of the death in Bristol on November 9th, of Mrs Lily Elizabeth Bryant, recalls a long family association with the Washford district, and Mrs Bryant’s own contribution as a caterer at many social events. The older generation, especially those connected with the Methodist Church, will remember one of her specialties – rabbit pie suppers.\n\nThe obituary explains that:\n\nMrs Bryant, born in 1889 in the now vanished little village of Clicket, near Timberscombe, was the last surviving child of George and Rachel Burge. In 1914 she married Mr William John Bryant, eldest son of John and Emma Bryant, of Bilbrook. Mr W. J. Bryant was for many years a local preacher in the former Williton Methodist circuit. While living in the Washford district, Mrs Bryant was a keen worker for the Methodist Church, the WI, Mother’s Union and Royal British Legion. She worked for many years as the confectionery cook at the Bungalow Café, Minehead, and also as cook at Woolworths in Minehead. 36\n\nlost villages aw.indd 44\n\n3/4/08 11:23:15\n\nthe p ow er o f water\n\nEventually, Mr and Mrs Bryant left the district for Fishponds in Bristol, to reside with their youngest daughter, Barbara. Mr Bryant died there in 1971 and the following year Mrs Bryant moved to Abbotswood, Yate, to live with her eldest daughter, Lilian. In December 1976, due to poor health, and on medical advice, she entered Newton House, Cadbury Heath, where she died after a very short illness. Was therefore, Lily Elizabeth Bryant (nee Burge), the last surviving resident of the lost village of Clicket? The valley in which Clicket once stood, although beautiful, can be dark and damp, so it is easy to understand why its people chose to abandon it. The lady who walked to Porlock each day illustrates the fact that the residents of Clicket would have been aware of the outside world, and the Bible Christians recorded how local people were moving away in search of a better life. To young men and women, this gloomy valley must have seemed like the back of beyond. There was little here to tempt them to stay, particularly when a better life with better prospects could be oﬀered virtually anywhere else. From the start of the twentieth century many small rural villages became depopulated as their prevalent industries went into steady decline; and some, like Stoke Bottom or Clicket, disappeared from the maps completely. The sound of pack animals as they trudged along ancient tracks towards Clicket Mill are today replaced by the wild sounds of Exmoor, such as the roaring of the famous red deer. It is quite appropriate that the site has been returned to nature, considering that the word ‘clicket’ refers to the copulation of foxes. Whether or not there will be future Clicket’s is very unlikely. Today, we have an aﬄuent element to our society that purchases rural cottages as second homes and weekend retreats. Sadly, if rural people today find it hard to live in their ancestral communities because there is no work available, this does not spell the end of the village, as there will be a ready army of city professionals armed with hefty bonuses, ready to snap up their homes. Exmoor and the Brendon Hills are perfect examples of this scenario, as one or two villages are now almost completely owned by people from outside. But in a sense, are these not lost villages in their own right? It is true that the houses remain standing, but rural villages were made of more than just bricks and mortar: villages were often measured by the people who lived in them, their traditions, history, faith, and sense of community. 37\n\nlost villages aw.indd 45\n\n3/4/08 11:23:16\n\nSome parts of Britain were so remote that even during the Victorian age and early twentieth century they seemed to change very little. They were so remote, in fact, that the people living there would have been largely oblivious to the social changes and improvements taking place in other parts of the realm. The villages covered so far in this book met their demise through the collapse of their mining, industrial, or agricultural base. However, there were more complex reasons as well, such as those factors influencing the abandonment of Mingulay. Mingulay island, which roughly measures two-and-a-half miles by one-and-a-half miles, covers an area of 1,581 acres (640 hectares). It is the second most southerly of the group of islands known as the Bishop’s Isles, which lie oﬀ the southern tip of the Outer Hebrides, south of Barra, and which include Vatersay, Sandray, Lingay, Pabbay, and Berneray – the last of which is the only significant landmass south of our subject. Make a note of these names, as several feature in the following narrative. Many small Scottish islands were deserted during the nineteenth century, as well as villages on the larger islands of the Western Isles, Orkney Islands and Shetland Isles. Some of these settlements could be regarded as villages, while others comprised of a few scattered crofts. In our definition, if a community had such things as a school and a church, as Mingulay did, it can be regarded as a village. So just as Morwellham Quay represented a number of other lost villages in the Tamar Valley, and Dylife the abandoned mining communities of mid-Wales, Mingulay is representative of numerous island settlements that were disappearing around 1900. What might appear strange is that people should wish to live in 38\n\nlost villages aw.indd 46\n\n3/4/08 11:23:16\n\nA S o R E LY- D I S T R E S S E D C o M M U N I T Y\n\nOnMingulaypeatwasplentifulandusedforfuel.Thisphotograph showspeatdiggersonanunspecifiedHebrideanisland PhotographbyCherryKearton,reproducedfromthebookwith Nature and a Camera byRichardKearton,publishedin1898byCassellandCompany\n\n39\n\nlost villages aw.indd 47\n\n3/4/08 11:23:25\n\nthe l o st v illages\n\nsuch a remote location in the first place. The island is surrounded by high cliﬀs, with only one possible landing place on the east coast where a bay is enclosed by an amphitheatre of hills. The village was situated at the head of this bay, but for much of the year the treacherous sea conditions eﬀectively cut the islanders oﬀ from the rest of civilisation. Surprisingly, the island was an extremely good place to live. It had supported human settlement since the Neolithic times. Its people were very close-knit and self-suﬃcient, and while things were going well their isolation from the rest of Britain was no particular handicap. There was an abundance of peat, which could be used for fuel. The grass on the hills was suitable for grazing cattle and sheep. The sea provided fish and the cliﬀs teemed with colonies of seabirds bursting with eggs. These colonies also attracted a trickle of Victorian tourists interested in ornithology, although not to the same extent as the more accessible islands of the Outer Hebrides. So what went wrong? The truth is that Mingulay continued to prosper while its population remained constant. Before 1841, the only known population figure was 52, recorded in 1764. The island could clearly support this number of people. Most of the Bishop’s Isles were owned by a clan chief called General MacNeil of Barra who, during the 1830s, was facing financial ruin and the prospect of bankruptcy. He began a process of evicting people from one or two of these islands. Some of the people were forced to live on Barra itself in order to work at the General’s kelp works at Northbay. The islands from which they came were then given over for the grazing of sheep: much more profitable to the MacNeils than any revenue provided from crofting. The enterprise failed and from around 1837 these islands were steadily repopulated – all that is but one: the island of Sandray. Sandray had a similar population to Mingulay, and the MacNeils continued to reserve it for sheep. Some of its population emigrated to Mingulay, which had already seen a partial growth after the eviction of its other neighbours. By 1841, Mingulay’s population had swelled to 114 and continued to grow, peaking in the 1880s at around 160. In little over 100 years, the island’s population had trebled and its limited resources were coming under increasing pressure. Ben Buxton, an authority on Mingulay, has written extensively on the subject, including the book Mingulay: An island and its people and a chapter about the island in the book, The Decline and Fall of St Kilda. He writes that: 40\n\nlost villages aw.indd 48\n\n3/4/08 11:23:25\n\na s o rely- distressed c o mmunity\n\nhe rising population also led to overcrowding in the village, T which became insanitary, and there were outbreaks of diseases such as typhoid, measles and influenza. It was often impossible to get to Barra to summon the doctor, or, just as importantly, the priest. The rising population, lack of land and problems of access led to a few families moving to crofts at Garrygall in Barra in 1883.\n\nPressure on the land caused by this population rise meant that the inhabitants had to find other means of supplementing their incomes. Fishing was the obvious choice and the period coincided with the growth of a fishing port at Castlebay on the larger island of Barra. Up until this point, fishing had largely aided the island’s self-suﬃciency. Their catch – usually by line – would have been white fish, such as cod or ling, which would be cured on the rocks. Some of their catch was sold to the fishing industries of Glasgow and Northern Ireland. As a port, Castlebay developed because of the plentiful herring that shoaled in Scottish waters, while for the people of Mingulay it provided opportunities for selling fish. There was, however, a problem: the island had only one place from which boats could be launched or landed, and that was on the beach at Mingulay Bay. Rocks at either side of the bay, which in the past had been used to land people and goods, certainly could not accommodate fishing boats. The broad sweep of the bay opened it up to the elements, providing little shelter from the wind or swell. Boats at anchor here could easily be driven on to the rocks. Any boats that did attempt to use the beach could only be launched by wading into the choppy, freezing waves to at least chest height, an operation made impossible for much of the year because of the atrocious sea conditions. Ben Buxton notes how one visitor to the island reported the problem of landing supplies: “It is no unusual occurrence for them to have to throw their bags of meal into the sea and drag them ashore by means of a rope.” The visitor further suggested that, “it is easier to reach America than to get there.” All of this put Mingulay fishermen at a disadvantage, as they were unable to begin fishing before March or April, whereas their rivals from Barra could cast oﬀ in February. Also, herring had to be caught using nets as opposed to line, and this required larger boats. To compete in the herring industry several men from Mingulay 41\n\nlost villages aw.indd 49\n\n3/4/08 11:23:25\n\nthe l o st v illages\n\noperated suitable craft, but as they were too large to use the beach they were anchored at Castlebay. Several other fishermen based themselves on the nearby island of Berneray during the fishing season, as access was easier. However, this meant being away from home for lengthy periods of time. Of those without their own fishing vessels, some were able to secure seasonal employment aboard herring boats from Barra, and women from all over the islands sought work as herring gutters. This also involved working away from home during the summer months at places on the east coast of Scotland, such as Peterhead, following the fish as they migrated. This growing dependency on fishing, coupled with the rise in the island’s population, meant there was less time being spent on traditional island activities, such as crofting and fowling – the very activities that had made the community self-reliant. If they were to compete at all, the problem of finding a suitable place to anchor their boats was paramount: not only to support the fishing boats but in order to land the increasing amount of supplies the villagers needed now they were becoming less self-suﬃcient. One answer to this problem would have been the building of a boat slip, but the islanders had neither the knowledge nor finances to accomplish this. In 1890, a government commission was informed of the problem of access to the village and, in 1896, its inhabitants sent a petition to the Secretary of State for Scotland, signed by all of the male population, appealing for help in constructing a “boat-slip with a boat-hauling convenience.” The petition concluded with the hope that “your lordship will lend a favourable ear to the cry of a sorelydistressed community.” Ben Buxton goes on to explain that in the following year, the Congested Districts Board was established by the Scottish Oﬃce to promote economic development in crofting areas:\n\nT he Board took on the problem and, having ruled out a pier or boat slip because of the exposed nature of the bay and its sandy floor, proposed a crane or derrick for hoisting boats right out of the water. However, this scheme was downgraded, presumably because of cost, and in 1901 a derrick for loading and unloading people, animals and goods into and out of boats was installed near the landing place. While this may have been useful, the main problem, that of the boats remained. 42\n\nlost villages aw.indd 50\n\n3/4/08 11:23:25\n\na s o rely- distressed c o mmunity\n\nWhile all of this was going on, village life was maintained. A school was opened in 1859 by the Ladies’ Highland Association. Presumably, education before this date was provided in the home, as were religious services. Without a doubt, the access to formal education and the practice of working away at mainland ports would have given the villager’s some idea of the outside world – and the standard of life enjoyed beyond their island retreat. In 1898, a substantial Roman Catholic chapel was built to administer to the island’s predominant faith. The building of the chapel came courtesy of the See of Argyll and the Isles, a project founded in 1878 and funded by a wealthy merchant from Castlebay. This was the first chapel on the island for centuries. It provided both an area in which to hold services and rooms for the visiting priest who, during the summer months, would come monthly from Barra and less frequently at other times of the year. In the 1890s, the landowner was Lady Gordon Cathcart. Like the MacNeils before her, she did not feel there was any profit to be made from crofting. Fishing was a much more viable proposition; and besides, she had just paid for the improvement to the pier at Castlebay. Lady Cathcart would only permit the crofters at Castlebay to cultivate small plots of land: just enough to grow a few potatoes, but not enough to make them independent. This lack of land eﬀectively forced them into the fishing industry. So with no new crofts being provided for the growing population, and no house building undertaken, the people were living in increasingly squalid, overcrowded conditions. A few nautical miles to the north of Mingulay, but south of Barra, lay the slightly larger island of Vatersay, which had traditionally been crofted before the evictions earlier in the century. Many descendants of those who had lived on Vatersay now lived on Barra, probably even a few on Mingulay itself. Aware of the abundance of space on this sister island, the cottars of Castlebay sent an appeal for land as early as 1883, which was rejected. The island was being managed as one large farm and the only people living there were the farmer, his family and workforce. In 1894, there was an interesting development, as a government commission designated certain areas to be suitable for crofting, among them Vatersay. However, Lady Cathcart refused to comply, maintaining that crofting tenants were poor rent payers. Her Ladyship wanted all available men to work in the fishing industry. Fuelled no doubt by the government’s decision on crofting and Lady 43\n\nlost villages aw.indd 51\n\n3/4/08 11:23:25\n\nT H E L o S T v I L L AG E S\n\nMingulayBay,photographedinJune2006.Theislandis surroundedbyhighcliffs,sothiswastheonlypossiblelanding place.Thevillagewassituatedattheheadofthisbayandfor muchoftheyearthetreacherousseaconditionseffectivelycut theislandersofffromtherestofcivilisation PhotographcourtesyofTonyKinghorn\n\n44\n\nlost villages aw.indd 52\n\n3/4/08 11:23:31\n\na s o rely- distressed c o mmunity\n\nCathcart’s total disregard for them, their families and heritage, a group of men who became known as ‘raiders’ began to turn the tide of history. The first raids took place on farms at Northbay and Eoligarry on Barra, where men began to mark out crofts. Subsequently, this land was purchased by the Congested Districts Board for the purpose of crofting. The first raid on Vatersay was in 1900 when a group of Castlebay cottars invaded the island and similarly began to mark out areas for crofting. In 1902, the Board bought up this land and made it available to the cottars for growing potatoes. Until now, they had not really encroached on the farm itself, but in 1905 when the lease on the farm came up for renewal – and their appeal for land was again turned down – the cottars began to mark out crofts near the farm itself. Ben Buxton writes:\n\nhe Mingulay people no doubt followed these events with T interest. By 1905 the community was in decline: the photographs taken by Robert Adam show that some buildings had been abandoned, and Morag Campbell Finlayson wrote ‘we spend the winter months lonely and dull… we shall be like prisoners during the bad weather… I am hoping to leave Mingulay soon’. (She did so shortly afterwards.) In July 1906 four Mingulay cottars joined a large number from Castlebay in a raid on Vatersay, and, for the first time, some of the desperate Barra men began to build huts in the vicinity of the farm buildings. In August Michael Campbell attempted to build a hut at Ledaig, Castlebay, but desisted when the local crofters asked him to, and later in the year he built the hut near the farm on Vatersay. In January 1907 he and others from Mingulay moved into the hut, and they were followed by a stream of other Mingulay settlers throughout 1907.\n\nThe island of Sandray, from where a number of Mingulay’s population had originated, was still being used for grazing sheep, and was inhabited by a solitary shepherd. So a number of men raided the island and set about constructing stone and thatch houses at Sheader. Here, a sheltered bay enabled them to fish for lobsters. They sent an appeal to the Congested Districts Board asking for crofting land, as it was becoming impossible to exist on their own island: even fishing was regarded as more dangerous there than at other locations. 45\n\nlost villages aw.indd 53\n\n3/4/08 11:23:31\n\nthe l o st v illages\n\nAttempting to solve various such problems around the Bishop’s Isles, the Board oﬀered to buy the land on Vatersay from Lady Cathcart, but the price she demanded was too high and instead she took legal action against 11 of the raiders, including five men from Mingulay. In June 1908, this action resulted in 10 of the raiders being summoned to Edinburgh to appear before the Court of Sessions. They were subsequently sentenced to two months imprisonment. However, the case was surrounded by media interest, which both highlighted and sympathized with the plight of the island crofters. Much of this interest was achieved by a man from Mingulay, Neil MacPhee. Although not one of the men under summons himself, he acted as their spokesman, writing intelligent and thought-provoking correspondences to the press. These did an enormous amount to sway public opinion in their favour. All of this, however, placed the Congested Districts Board in an awkward position. It seemed increasingly the case that once a raid had taken place, they would simply buy up the land in question for the crofters. Obviously this could not continue for two reasons: the first being that it encouraged disgruntled crofters to strike when and where they liked; and secondly, because the landowners were becoming more unrealistic about the price of their land. Nevertheless, due to public sympathy, Lady Cathcart appears to have had a change of heart over Vatersay: an agreement was reached and the crofters were given an early release from prison. Having secured Vatersay in 1909, the Board created 58 new crofts in four townships. Over the next few years all of the islands south of Vatersay were systematically abandoned. Berneray was vacated in 1910, followed by Pabbay and Sandray in 1911. Not everyone from Mingulay wished to leave their ancestral island home, but it was an inevitability, especially after the school was closed and the teacher transferred to a new school on Vatersay in 1910. The last reluctant few finally left Mingulay in the summer of 1912. Today, the island remains uninhabited and the school, the chapel and other village buildings lie in ruin. Those who visit the islands south of Vatersay now go to see the colonies of puﬃns, gannets and other seabirds that thrive in this remote corner of Britain. Others might go out of curiosity, and to wonder why a land which happily sustained human life for thousands of years was so completely and irreversibly deserted in such a short period of time.\n\n46\n\nlost villages aw.indd 54\n\n3/4/08 11:23:32\n\nA S o R E LY- D I S T R E S S E D C o M M U N I T Y\n\nRemainsoftheoldschoolhouseonMingulaywhichwasfinally closedin1910whentheteacherwastransferredtoanewschool onVatersay PhotographcourtesyofPaulStore\n\nThesecottagesonVatersaywerenodoubtabandonedatthetimeof theevictionsduringthenineteenthcentury PhotographcourtesyofCalumMcRoberts\n\n47\n\nlost villages aw.indd 55\n\n3/4/08 11:23:43\n\nT H E L o S T v I L L AG E S\n\nHallsandstoday:theshinglebeachhastotallygoneandthefew remainingruinssitprecariouslyontheedgeoftherocks.Perhaps futurestormswillonedayclaimwhatremainsofthese?

However, coastal erosion caused by the ravages of the ocean is not the only factor that has played a part in the abandonment of coastal communities. In terms of general history, perhaps the most famous coastal disappearances were at Kenfig in south Wales, devoured by sand dunes cast up from the Severn estuary, and at Dunwich, a major sea port in Suﬀolk, slowly demolished by the shrinking shoreline. But from the twentieth century, Hallsands on the south coast of Devon remains the most studied and perhaps controversial of coastal devastations. On the night of 26 January 1917, the village of Hallsands was destroyed during a severe storm. The village had been protected by a large pebble ridge and on that fateful night exceptionally high waves came pounding over it, crashing into the houses. The village had become vulnerable because sand and gravel had been dredged from the seabed in order to enlarge the naval dockyards at Devonport, consequently reducing the shingle beach. The few houses and hotel that make up the modern hamlet of Hallsands can be found near Start Point, which itself is close to Prawle Point, the southernmost extremity of Devon. Visitors today can no longer visit the old village, but it can be studied from a viewing platform. Looking down from this vantage point you immediately ask the question: “why was a village built in such a precarious spot in the first place?” But the fact is Hallsands was not always as close to the water’s edge as it is today. The houses were built on a shelf of rock that protruded from the base of the cliﬀs. These rocks provided a relatively flat surface, but 49\n\nlost villages aw.indd 57\n\n3/4/08 11:23:49\n\nthe l o st v illages\n\npresumably any uneven areas were levelled oﬀ with compacted sand. This ledge hovered significantly above the water line and was never less than 10 feet from the sea – even at its highest level. In the main, the village formed one narrow street along this ledge, with houses on either side of the street, while a sea wall provided extra protection from the English Channel. Some of the houses even used the cliﬀ face as their back wall, which although not uncommon on the south coast, seems rather reckless. Every boy scout knows that you should never pitch your shelter beneath a cliﬀ, for obvious reasons. Apart from the possibility of landslides and falling rocks, for which this shoreline is renowned, its location beneath east-facing cliﬀs suggest that on days when the South Hams basked in sunshine, Hallsands itself would have been enveloped in shadowy gloom for much of the day. But on the positive side, the overhanging cliﬀs oﬀered the village protection against westerly gales. The only reason why a village would be built in such an unlikely location is because the livelihood of its occupants depended on it – and Hallsands depended on fishing. Along the rocky coastline between Hallsands and Salcombe, there are few places from which fishermen could operate, let alone live. Then there was the little matter of Skerries Bank, a veritable garden of Eden for fishing folk, still today fished for sole, mackerel, gurnard, bass and other varieties of fish, which absolutely abounded here in oﬀshore depressions known as ‘pits’. Hallsands was about as close to these pits as you could get. As the village did not have a harbour, and was therefore unsuitable for trawlers, the villagers relied heavily on inshore crab and lobster fishing, or ‘potting’ as it was known. But in order to catch crabs and lobsters, they first had to gather bait. For this they did not have to go far, as the fish used for baiting the pots could be hauled in from the beach. Basically, rowing boats would take massive nets called ‘seine nets’ out to sea, following instructions from a man who sat on the cliﬀtop called a ‘hillman’, who would be on the look out for suitable shoals. A purpose-built rowing boat was used which had a platform at the stern on which the net was carefully packed. The boat would leave the shore with the net paying out behind it and would follow a short semi-circular course around the shoal back to the shore. Then it was pulled at each end. Every man and woman would receive a share of the spoils. Each man would receive one share of the catch and each woman two50\n\nlost villages aw.indd 58\n\n3/4/08 11:23:50\n\nthe cruel sea\n\nthirds of a share. The owner of the boat and nets would receive three shares. Seine fishing was very much a communal activity that brought the entire village together, and for many young lads it was their first experience of fishing. The catches would be mostly mullet and bass during spring and early summer, and mackerel in late summer. Only certain fish would be suitable for crab bait, so the remainder would either be eaten by the local families, sold to hawkers who would take them around the nearby farms and hamlets, or would be sent to London by train from Kingsbridge seven miles away where it would largely end up in Billingsgate market. Only bass, mullet and salmon were sent up-country: mackerel deteriorates quickly and would have been immediately sold locally. Because Hallsands did not have a harbour, the beach was eﬀectively the village work place. Here, crab and lobster pots would be stacked, nets dried, and boats would sit upon the shingle waiting to be launched. Several other methods of fishing were practised from Hallsands, as well as seine fishing and potting. These included tuck netting, trammel netting and longlining. Tuck netting, or drag netting as it was known elsewhere, was similar to seine fishing, except instead of catching shoals of fish that were observed moving close to the shoreline, the nets would be taken much further out to sea. And instead of encircling the shoal, the tuck net would form a wall beneath the water, which was then slowly dragged back to shore. During this process, teams of men would work on the beach, and in a special hauling boat. The trammel was a static net that was kept in an upright position below the water line. Lead weights would anchor its bottom to the seabed, while cork floats would keep its top near the surface. The net formed two layers, which entrapped any fish that swam into it headlong. Longlining, on the other hand, was employed to catch fish that actually lived along the seabed, such as ray at the Skerries and conger eel near the cliﬀs. The line was a baited piece of rope, and after being anchored to the bottom for the required period of time, it would be hoisted up to the boat, where the waiting crew would pull the fish aboard. Apparently conger eel, which were particularly good as crab bait, would be subdued with a mallet before being hauled into the boat to stop them thrashing about and causing injury or damage. Much of the catch from all of these diﬀerent fishing methods was used to bait the pots that were set oﬀshore to ensnare crabs 51\n\nlost villages aw.indd 59\n\n3/4/08 11:23:50\n\nT H E L o S T v I L L AG E S\n\nHallsandsphotographedin1885.Above:thebeachwasnarrowat thistime,duetonaturalcauses,andWilson’sRockappearstosit halfinandhalfoutofthewater.Below:aladywithseveralchildren infrontofherhouse,givesagoodideaofhowthebeachwasused astheworkplaceofthefishermen.Hardlyaninchseemsunused PhotographscourtesyofPlymouthRecords&Archives\n\n52\n\nlost villages aw.indd 60\n\n3/4/08 11:24:00\n\nthe cruel sea\n\nand lobsters. Once caught, the crabs were either kept alive in large storage pots from where they were periodically picked up by a crab smack from Southampton, or they were taken to Kingsbridge railway station to be sent to London. Catching crabs was one thing; however, selling them was quite a diﬀerent matter. This aspect of their business was in the hands of agents in London. The crabs, lobsters and other fish sent from Hallsands had to compete with those sent from many other fishing communities, so they often found themselves at the mercy of unscrupulous traders. The crab pots were made from willows, many of which were brought from the Somerset Levels. But as a coincidence, a nearby spring running through the above valley created perfect conditions for growing them. Each family was able to harvest much of their own annual requirement, and men and women alike would weave the finished pots. The spring also provided the village with its water supply. Initially, water would have been collected in buckets after a long trudge up the hill, but around the start of the twentieth century the water was being channelled to the village through bore pipes. Nobody quite knows how old the village is or when the first people lived here. Early records mention a chapel at Start Point, today noted for its lighthouse. If there was a chapel here around 1500 there is certainly no archeological evidence to indicate where. Hallsands itself is within the parish of Stokenham, and the Stokenham Manor Court Rolls of the early seventeenth century mention it on several occasions, but with diﬀerent spellings, such as Halesande, Halsands, and Halesands. These unquestionably refer to the same place, and the variety of spellings reflect the fact that few people could read or write at the time, all of which serves to hamper modern investigations and makes some of our assumptions the product of conjecture. By 1900, there were approximately 160 people in the village living in 37 houses, most of which were owner-occupied. This was unusual to say the least, and how fishing families could aﬀord mortgages is not clear. However, tenants were oﬀered the chance to purchase their properties when the landlord, Sir Robert Newman, died in 1857, and most seized the opportunity. Hallsands enjoyed similar facilities to most small rural villages of the time. There was a pub named the London Inn, positioned along the main street, which brewed its own ale. Naturally, its clientele largely comprised of local fishermen. The men who ferried 53\n\nlost villages aw.indd 61\n\n3/4/08 11:24:00\n\nthe l o st v illages\n\nthe fish to Kingsbridge and other tradesmen visiting the village were able to use the stabling facilities for their horses, while they themselves enjoyed the hospitality within. There was also a shop, with a post oﬃce; a bakery; and for spiritual guidance, the mission room. Several properties were built on top of the cliﬀs, where there was a coastguard station with a row of cottages to house the men, and just to the north, a Bible Christian chapel that had superceded the mission room as the venue for religious services. The mission room itself became a sort of village hall where people gathered to tell stories, sing sea shanties, dance, and entertain their neighbours from villages like Beesands and Torcross. Here, many people would meet their future marital partners. One thing the village did not have was a school, the nearest being at Huckham – itself no more than a cluster of farms and cottages a couple of miles inland along twisting lanes. There was no transport, so all the children of the village would congregate in the morning and walk together. In the spring the children would gather primroses and bluebells on the way home for their mothers to brighten up their kitchens. Today, the South Hams are still a delight in spring and summer, with ancient hedgerows and variety of wild flowers. So village life at Hallsands had many similarities to other rural communities of the day. And what the villagers could not provide for themselves or purchase at the small village shop run by Katie and Louisa Mingo, local traders would bring. The packman, for instance, would visit on his horse, bringing materials, coloured ribbons and cottons. Boots, shoes, underwear and other clothing would be brought on approval by a courier from Tanners of Kingsbridge. Most fishermen had allotments on the cliﬀ top to grow their vegetables, and there was a coal depot along the road to Beesands. Coke to fuel the range was brought from the Kingsbridge Gas Works and there was a steady supply of driftwood along the beach. From an early age, children would drag driftwood up over the shingle for their fathers to cut up with saw or axe. Much of this wood came from shipwrecks and good pieces could be used for carpentry purposes, making shelves or earth closets. Most men in the village never had a bank account. Payment for their catch was either by cash, money order or cheque. Money orders could be cashed in at the post oﬃce and local traders were happy to cash the cheques. 54\n\nlost villages aw.indd 62\n\n3/4/08 11:24:01\n\nthe cruel sea\n\nSeveral books have been written about Hallsands and one in particular, Sisters Against the Sea by Ruth and Frank Milton, tells the fascinating story of the Trout family.
