        "text": "4,000 - 2,500 BC ⁄ BCE\n\nThough many artefacts of Old and Middle Stone Age settlements have been discovered throughout South Wales, Neolithic migrants didn't arrive into the Cardiff area until around 2,500 BCE, most likely via the Severn estuary.[REF] Tinkinswood Burial Chamber, just west of the city in the Vale of Glamorgan, dates back to around this time.\n\n1500 BC ⁄ BCE\n\nAn ancient variation of Welsh was the dominant language of all of northern Europe.[REF]\n\n55 BC ⁄ BCE\n\nThe Roman Empire invaded Britain for the first time, on 26 August this year.[REF] The famous Roman general, Julius Caesar wanted revenge for the fact that Britons helped the French (then, part of Gaul) fight against the invasion. He was also looking to impress his Commanders, and thought that conquering Britain would be a way of earning respect.\n\nCaesar was unsuccessful in his attempt as most of his troops were lost in the crossing of the English Channel. Further attacks later in the year and in 54 BC ⁄ BCE were also fruitless. 1st to 11th Century (0 - 1099) Anno Domini ⁄ Common Era↓♦↑\n\n43 AD ⁄ CE\n\nThe Roman general, Didius Gallus, was amongst the invasion force that finally managed to overcome the Welsh tribes in South Wales. Didius arranged for the building of a small wooden fort where the Castle now stands and some historians believe that this is where the City gets its name from - \"Fort of Didius\" (Caer Didi).\n\nThe Roman Empire, once in control of Britain, brought an era of peace and expansion to Wales. Many of the roads we drive on today, closely follow the original Roman trade routes (namely the A48 that runs from Gloucester to Carmarthen via Newport, Cardiff, Bridgend and Neath and the A470 which runs from Cardiff to Llandudno)\n\n45 - 300 AD ⁄ CE\n\nThe era of peace led to the fort being reduced in size, however during the 3rd Century, Irish raiders were beginning to make frequent hits on South Wales. The fort was rebuilt and strengthened to help repel the attacks.\n\n445 AD / CE\n\nApart from the first written reference of Cardiff in the Annates Cambriae (The Welsh Annals) there is not much mention of Cardiff between now and the 1st millennium, although we do know that the Romans started losing their grasp on Britain when they were overrun by 'Barbarians' (The Silures).\n\nAdd to this the fact that the dreary climate was so different to where the Roman Soldiers were from (Romania, Spain and North Africa) that not only were the Romans finding it difficult to fight off the Silures, they were generally losing interest in this cold, wet, isolated island.\n\n850 AD ⁄ CE\n\nThe first recorded Viking attack is made on the Welsh coast.\n\n1081 - 1090\n\nSome 20 years after William, Duke of Normandy (AKA William the Conqueror) wins the Battle of Hastings in 1066, he marches on into Cardiff for his first and only visit after conquering Glamorgan.\n\nHe commissioned the building of a wooden fortification very close to the River Taff, and used the original Roman defences as the base of the building. Robert FitzHamon, William's Kinsman and Earl of Gloucester, took charge of the area, and was responsible for the construction at this time.\n\nHe built the motte (mound) with a wooden stockade within the site. In the 12th century his son-in-law, Robert the Consul, built the stone keep which is visible today. 12th Century (1100 - 1199)↓♦↑\n\n1100\n\nA small town had begun to establish itself outside the castle, and was primarily made up of settlers from England.\n\nSt. Mary's Church (where the Prince of Wales pub now stands) was to become a Priory of Tewkesbury Abbey in Gloucestershire around this year.\n\n1107\n\nRobert FitzHamon was killed fighting in Normandy and his Daughter, Mabel, married Robert the Consul.\n\nBishop Urban of Llandaff, was appointed to the position by the Normans, became the first bishop of a Welsh diocese to profess obedience to the Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\n1111\n\nThe first town wall, a wooden palisade, is erected this year.\n\n1126\n\nBishop Urban and Robert the Consul signed an agreement on settling disputes between them and the first record of a mayor of Cardiff, Ralph, dates from this year. Ralph is described as Prepositus de Kardi, Prevost of Cardiff.\n\nThe title may have some German or French links, but I cannot confirm this for sure. Robert, Duke of Normandy was imprisoned in Cardiff Castle.\n\n1136\n\nThe building of the Polygonal stone keep in Cardiff Castle was probably begun this year on the orders of Robert the Consul and at 35 feet was the highest ever built anywhere in Wales.\n\n1147\n\nGeoffrey of Monmouth, famous for his book 'History of the Kings of Britain' published in 1136 and which first popularised the stories of King Arthur and his knights, became Archdeacon of Llandaff until his death in 1154. He may also have lived there during this time. Geoffrey had dedicated his book to Robert the Consul who died this year.\n\n1175\n\nRecords of the time indicate that St. Mary's Church may have been rebuilt and enlarged at this time.\n\n1180\n\nSt. John's Church was probably built about now, and was intended as a independent chapel within the town walls. It acted as a chapel of ease for St. Mary's, allowing parishioners a wider choice of places of worship.\n\n1185\n\nThe borough of Cardiff was burnt, and the castle damaged during a widespread uprising of the Welsh under the formidable Lord Rhys (Rhys ap Gruffydd), ruler of Deheubarth.\n\n1188\n\nAccompanied by Gerald of Wales, Archbishop Baldwin of Canterbury on a tour of Wales called the volunteers for the third crusade at Llandaff, reputedly by the medieval Cross there.\n\nGerald described Cardiff Castle as having high walls and 120 men-at-arms with a larger number of archers.\n\n1189\n\nPrince John was made Lord of Glamorgan this year. 13th Century (1200 - 1299)↓♦↑\n\n1206\n\nJohn, now King, confirmed Cardiff's charters, including the right to hold two weekly markets and two annual fairs.\n\n1211\n\nCadwallon ab Ifor Bach raided the lands around Cardiff from his lordship of Senghenydd.\n\nThe monks of St Mary's Church were withdrawn to Tewksbury Abbey.\n\n1217\n\nCardiff came into the hands of the powerful Clare family.\n\n1218\n\nThe establishment of Llandaff Cathedral chapter has been completed by now.\n\n1233\n\nCardiff Castle was captured by Richard de Burgh, the earl marshal, during the course of a power struggle with Henry III.\n\n1242\n\nThe Dominican Priory of the Black Friars was founded on the western side of the castle next to the present Cooper's Fields and outside the town walls.\n\n1266\n\nThe rebuilt Llandaff Cathedral was dedicated this year.\n\n1267\n\nGilbert de Clare, 'the Red Earl', captured Gruffydd ap Rhys, lord of Senghenydd and great-grandson of Ifor Bach, holding him in Cardiff Castle before exiling him to imprisonment in Kilkenny Castle, Ireland.\n\n1270\n\nThe construction of Castell Coch by Gilbert de Clare may have begun this year following an attack on his Caerphilly Castle by Prince Llewellyn ap Gruffydd of Gwynedd.\n\nGilbert probably also had the Black Tower at the South Gate of Cardiff Castle built about now as well as ordering the town wall to be rebuilt in stone.\n\n1284\n\nIn or about this year, the Franciscan Friary of the Grey Friars, with the largest church in Cardiff 154 feet long, was founded on the eastern side of the castle outside the town walls on the side of the present Capital Tower.\n\nBy about this date the bishop's palace or castle had been constructed at Llandaff by Bishop William de Braose. 14th Century (1300 - 1399)↓♦↑\n\n1316\n\nCardiff was attacked and badly damaged by Llawelyn Bren, son of Gruffydd ap Rhys.\n\n1318\n\nLlewellyn Bren was executed in Cardiff Castle by Hugh Despenser after being captured in the Brecon Beacons and reputedly his body was buried in Grey Friars.\n\nHugh Despenser had married Eleanor whose brother Gilbert de Clare - son of 'the Red Earl' - had been killed at the battle of Bannockburn in Scotland in 1314.\n\n1324\n\nThe earliest craft guilde in Cardiff, the Cordwainers and Glovers (workers in leather), had its privileges confirmed by Edward II.\n\n1326\n\nCardiff was made a stable port for the export of wool and hides but, as it was not a royal borough, Carmarthen took over this role eight years later.\n\n1331\n\nAbout this year, the Town Hall was built in High Street for the administration of the borough and it was also used as Cardiff's first market hall.\n\nIt continued in use for some 400 years and included a court room with a gaol beneath it and about this time the leper hospital of St Mary Magdalen was founded outside the town's East Gate.\n\n1340\n\nThe oldest existing charter for Cardiff dates from this year when the town had a population of 2,000 - 3,000 making it the largest borough in Wales.\n\n1349\n\nThe Black Death first appeared in the area at this time.\n\n1373\n\nThe first reference to Flat Holm in Cardiff records stated it belonged to the Lord of Glamorgan. 15th Century (1400 - 1499)↓♦↑\n\n1402\n\nOwain Glyndŵr attacked Cardiff during his Welsh rebellion.\n\n1404\n\nOwain Glyndŵr's troops attacked Cardiff again, capturing the castle and inflicted great damage on the town. The bishop's palace or castle at Llandaff was destroyed at the same time, and was afterwards abandoned.\n\n1425\n\nIt was probably in this year that Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, built the Octagonal Tower in Cardiff Castle.\n\n1451\n\nRichard Neville, Earl of Warwick, issued a charter in which he praised the burgesses for their efforts to fortify and defend Cardiff.\n\n1473\n\nThe rebuilding of St John's Church with its 130-feet high tower was completed after about 20 years' work as Cardiff recovered from the Glyndŵr attack. The tower was paid for by Anne Nevill who was later to marry Richard III.\n\n1480\n\nAbout now the death occurred of the poet Deio ab leuan Du who wrote the words which appear on Cardiff's coat of arms: 'Y ddraig goch ddyry cychwyn' ('The red dragon will show the way').\n\n1486\n\nThe marcher lordship of Glamorgan, including Cardiff, was confiscated by the crown after Henry Tudor's Lancastrian victory at the previous year's Battle of Bosworth in which Richard III of the House of York was killed. The triumphant Henry VII granted the lordship to his uncle, Jasper Tudor.\n\n1495\n\nJasper Tudor died and Cardiff with the lordship of Glamorgan reverted to the crown. 16th Century (1500 - 1599)↓♦↑\n\n1536\n\nWales was united with England from this year, the marcher lordship of Glamorgan was abolished and Cardiff became part of the new shire of Glamorgan and its county town.\n\nThe Herbert family quickly became a powerful force in the town and, with the ending of the medieval restrictions on them, Welsh people now began making their homes and established businesses in Cardiff.\n\n1537\n\nThomas Howell left money to found a girls' school in Llandaff, but a dispute over the will delayed its opening for three centuries.\n\n1538\n\nCardiff's two friaries, with a total of 15 friars, were dissolved by Henry VIII. The Franciscan Grey Friars was converted to a mansion by the Herbert's but the Dominican Black Friars was left to deteriorate into ruins.\n\n1542\n\nThomas Capper was burnt at the stake in Cardiff for heresy. A radical Protestant, he was the first religious martyr in Wales since Roman times. From this year Cardiff became represented by a Member of Parliament.\n\n1543\n\nThe year saw the introduction of the English militia system with regular musters of all males aged 16 to 60.\n\n1551\n\nWilliam Herbert, Earl of Pembroke, was created the first Baron Cardiff.\n\n1552\n\nOn a visit to Cardiff, the antiquary John Leland described it as well-walled with five gates and a mile in circumference.\n\n1555\n\nThe Protestant martyr and local fisherman, Rawlins White, was burnt at the stake for heresy during the reign of the Catholic Queen Mary.\n\n1564\n\nAt Tongwynlais, an iron foundry was established by the Sussex ironmaster Sir Henry Sidney.\n\n1570\n\nA congress of Welsh bards was held at Cardiff Castle at the invitation of William Herbert to order 'the bardic rules'\n\n1573\n\nCardiff was made a head port for the collection of customs duties, one of four such ports in Wales.\n\n1574\n\nHenry Herbert carried out extensive restoration work on Cardiff Castle.\n\n1576\n\nThe notorious local pirate, John Callice, brought a captured Spanish vessel into Cardiff and sold its contents.\n\n1577\n\nA successful campaign to stamp out piracy in the Bristol Channel based on Cardiff was started.\n\n1578\n\nThe contemporary Glamorgan historian, Rice Merrick (Rhys Meurig), described Cardiff Castle as having been rebuilt by the Herberts, containing luxurious apartments and attractive gardens with many fair houses and large streets in the town.\n\n1581\n\nThe first royal charter was granted to Cardiff by Elizabeth I.\n\n1582\n\nThe centuries old timber bridge across the River Taff in Cardiff was replaced by one made of stone.\n\n1595\n\nWilliam Morgan, translator of the Bible into Welsh in 1588 became Bishop of Llandaff, a position he held until 1601.\n\n1596\n\nNearly 40 people died of fever in the town's County Gaol this year. 17th Century (1600 - 1699)↓♦↑\n\n1602\n\nThe Pembrokeshire historian, George Owen, described Cardiff as 'the fayrest towne in Wales yett not the welthiest'.\n\n1607\n\n'The Great Flood' occurred in January causing devastation along the coast of South Wales. The foundations of the old St Mary's Church (on the site of the former Prince of Wales Theatre) were fatally weakened and St Johns become the parish church as a result. St Mary Street is named after the ancient church.\n\n1608\n\nJames I confirmed Cardiff's royal charter and a new annual fair was introduced on November 30th in addition to those starting on June 24th and September 8th of this year.\n\n1610\n\nThe first known maps of Cardiff and Llandaff were published. They were the work of John Speed, the famous cartographer.\n\n1614\n\nThirteen people were drowned attempting to cross the River Ely in Cardiff by ferryboat.\n\n1631\n\nThe Puritan vicar of St Mary's, William Erbery, was forced to resign and his curate, Walter Cradock, had his licence revoked because of their extreme evangelical views.\n\n1635\n\nThe famous buccaneer, Sir Henry Morgan, is thought to have been born in Llanrumney.\n\n1642\n\nAt the start of the Civil War, Cardiff Castle was occupied for Charles I by William Seymour, the Marquis of Hereford. At the Battle of Edgehill, the Royalist MP for Cardiff, William Herbert was killed.\n\n1643\n\nBooks and documentary records from Llandaff Cathedral were burnt by Parliamentary soldiers on Cardiff Castle green.\n\n1645\n\nIn the summer Charles I spent a week at Cardiff Castle trying unsuccessfully to raise financial support for his course. Later this summer the castle and town surrendered to a Parliamentary army.\n\n1646\n\nAccording to the parliamentary sources, 'the Battle of the Heath' took place to the North of the town for control of Cardiff and its castle. Some 250 Royalists were claimed to have been killed.\n\n1648\n\nIn May at St Fagans, in the last major battle ever to occur in Wales, some 8,000 Royalists were defeated in a two hour fight by 3,000 Parliamentary troops of the New Model Army with about 200 soldiers, mainly Royalists, killed.\n\nOf the 3,000 Royalist prisoners taken, four officers were executed and 240 men were transported to Barbados, Oliver Cromwell visited Cardiff eight days after the battle.\n\n1650\n\nThe first state school in Cardiff was established by Cromwell's Commonwealth government but was closed in 1660 with the restoration of Charles II.\n\n1653\n\nThe first warship to be given the name Cardiff was a 360 ton 18-gun frigate.\n\n1657\n\nThe noted Quaker leader Charles Fox preached in the Town Hall.\n\n1661\n\nA Quaker meeting in the town was broken up and some 40 local Quakers, suspected of disloyalty to the newly restored monarch, Charles II, were imprisoned.\n\n1666\n\nCardiff's first Angel Hotel was opened a short distance from the present hotel next to the Cardiff Castle.\n\n1667\n\nA Quaker burial ground came into use outside the town's South Gate.\n\n1678\n\nFrancis Place drew the first known depiction of Cardiff, a pen and wash drawing from the west bank of the River Taff. The Celtic scholar Edward Lhuyd also visited Cardiff now and described St Mary's church as being in ruins.\n\n1679\n\nPhilip Evans, born in Monmouth, became a Jesuit at Saint Omer and after his ordination in 1675 ministered to Catholics in South Wales for four years.\n\nIn the national frenzy occasioned by the Oates plot he was apprehended and imprisoned in Cardiff, where he was joined by John Lloyd of Brecon, a secular priest trained at Valladolid.\n\nThey were hung, drawn and quartered at Gallows Field near the junction of today's City Road, on July 22nd. They were both canonised by the Pope in 1970.\n\n1685\n\nAn English Quaker, Thomas Briggs, is recorded as having walked naked through Cardiff to emphasise the virtues of simplicity.\n\n1688\n\nCharlotte, daughter and heiress of Philip Herbert last of the male Herbert's of Cardiff Castle, married John Jeffreys, son of the notorious 'Hanging Judge' George Jeffreys. In Llandaff and Whitchurch, 84 parishioners requested the removal of the vicar because he couldn't speak Welsh.\n\n1696\n\nPart of the wall of Llandaff Cathedral collapsed and its bell fell to the ground, an indication of the ruinous condition it was in at this time, but a Presbyterian chapel was built in Womanby Street.\n\n1698\n\nThe last recorded burial in the old St Mary's churchyard took place this year. 18th Century (1700 - 1799)↓♦↑\n\n1703\n\nThe battlements of the north-west tower of Llandaff cathedral collapsed during a gale.\n\n1708\n\nThe oldest of the bells of St John's Church was cast this year and the cattle market was moved from inside the town walls to a site near the East Gate.\n\n1713\n\nThe Old Brewery in St Mary Street, originally Williams Malthouse, was opened.\n\n1723\n\nPart of the south-west tower of Llandaff Cathedral collapsed, adding to its dilapidated state.\n\n1725\n\nDaniel Dafoe, author of Robinson Crusoe, on a visit to Llandaff, noted that the cathedral had no steeple or bells.\n\n1729\n\nEight men and three women died of fever in the towns County Gaol.\n\n1731\n\nA pub was first opened on the site now occupied by the Owain Glyndwr. The pub was initially called the 'Mably Arms' (or possibly the Buccaneer), and over the centuries has been called the 'Kemys Tynte Arms', 'The Tennis Court' and 'The Buccanneer' before its current name.\n\n1736\n\nIn a shipwreck on Flat Holm about 60 soldiers were drowned.\n\n1737\n\nBecause of the previous year's disaster, a permanent lighthouse was established on Flat Holm by the Society of Merchant Ventures of Bristol.\n\n1739\n\nThe tower of St John's Church began to be used as the town's fire station.\n\n1740\n\nThe great Methodist leader, John Wesley, preached in Cardiff on the first of many visits he was to make to the town.\n\n1746\n\nLlandaff Court, now part of the Cathedral School, was built for Admiral Thomas Matthew.\n\n1747\n\nA new Guildhall was completed in St Mary Street, continuing in use for over a century.\n\nA local smuggler, Owen Williams, was hanged for murder.\n\n1750\n\nMelingriffith tinplate works in Whitchurch was opened on the site of an old iron forge.\n\n1755\n\nIn November, the Bristol Channel including the Cardiff area was affected by the 'tsunami' tidal wave from the great Lisbon earthquake.\n\n1759\n\nIn a running fight between seamen from two vessels in September in Womanby Street, a Royal Navy sailor was killed by a musket shot.\n\n1760\n\nTown Quay or Old Quay, the bigger of the two quays where Westgate Street is now, was rebuilt and extended to about 50 yards, the latest in a series of reconstructions dating back to the Middle Ages.\n\nThe Taff was also dredged to assist the movement of ships from the mouth of the river, some two miles away, to the quays.\n\n1763\n\nIn April, serious rioting occurred in the town in a dispute following a cock fight.\n\n1765\n\nHowell Harris, leader of the Methodist Revival 'the Great Awakening', preached in Cardiff and the first record of horse racing on the Great Heath dates from this year.\n\n1766\n\nThe Scottish Earl of Bute married into the great local landowning family of the Herberts and a Cardiff Turnpike Trust was set up to construct a toll road between Bonvilston and Rumney.\n\n1767\n\nA road was built between Cardiff and the new town of Merthyr Tydfil, reputedly largely financed by the ironmaster Anthony Bacon.\n\n1770\n\nThe bridge over the River Taff at Llandaff was rebuilt.\n\n1773\n\nFollowing a shipwreck on Flat Holm, seven passengers and two crewmen were buried on the island.\n\n1774\n\nAn Act was passed for 'the better paving, cleansing and lighting of the streets of Cardiff'.
