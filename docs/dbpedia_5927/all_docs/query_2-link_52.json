        "text": "Today (Thursday 13 June), the Plaid Cymru Party launched its manifesto for the 2024 general election. It states the need for everyone to have an affordable home and outlines the party’s position on Local Housing Allowance covering the bottom third of rents. It also states that it wants to scrap the benefit cap as well as No Recourse to Public Funds.\n\nResponding to the manifesto Matt Downie, Crisis Chief Executive, said: “It is welcome to see the Plaid Cymru Party emphasising the need for safe affordable homes and stating the importance of ending homelessness. The situation across Britain is stark. Absolutely no one should be without a home.\n\n“Changes like long-term investment in Local Housing Allowances so it covers the true cost of rents, scrapping the benefit cap and ending no recourse to public funds will ensure that many more people in Wales, and across Britain, will have a safe place to call home.”"
