        "text": "Welsh Government has expanded its workforce in the last few years - but less than one in 10 is working in North Wales. The number of Government employees now stands at just over 6,000.\n\nThis is less than the 6,400 in place in 2010 before austerity measures were brought in by UK Government but around 700 more than back in 2019. Welsh Government said the extra staff had been brought in to deal with the additional administrative workload due to Brexit and Covid.\n\nThere have also been staff moved from UK to Welsh governments due to the transfer of planning services as well as ICT staff moving in-house.\n\nREAD MORE: Legendary local restaurant boss closes North Wales Italian after 30 years\n\nBut of the 6,022 now employed only 534 are based in North Wales - which is between 8% and 9% of the total workforce. North Wales has around 22% of the population of Wales. When Welsh Government opened the £27m North Wales headquarters in Llandudno Junction in 2010 it estimated that around 650 staff would be based there in the future.\n\nThere are 447 Welsh Government staff in Mid-Wales and 614 in West Wales - while the vast majority (4,279) remain in South Wales.\n\nPlaid Cymru's Mabon ap Gwynfor said Welsh Government should be spreading staff across every corner of Wales while Aberconwy's Conservative MS Janet Finch-Saunders said funds should be directed at frontline services like the NHS and it was an \"added insult\" that North Wales is \"overlooked\".\n\nMr ap Gwynfor said: \"The Welsh Government have invested in offices in north and mid Wales which are under-utilised. With the move to home working there is no reason why they cannot decentralise their work and get their staff to work from every corner of Wales, and make good use of their office spaces when needed.\n\n\"The UK is an over centralised model, and we don’t want to see that model replicated here. We need to change that centralised culture and make sure that every part of Wales feels the benefit of devolution.\"\n\nMrs Finch-Saunders said: \"Welsh Government have increased the number of staff and are now pushing forward plans to increase the number of Senedd Members. This endless expansion of the Welsh state needs to be stopped. Taxpayers’ money would be far better spent on frontline services, like local authorities, the NHS, and schools.\n\n“It is an added insult to local residents that North Wales is overlooked in the expansion of the state as only 8% of all Welsh Government staff are based in our region. That is completely unacceptable when considering the monstrous amount of money that is wasted annually on the headquarters in Llandudno Junction.\"\n\nDue to home and hybrid working after the pandemic the office remains under-used.\n\nThe Aberconwy MS added: “I have recently disclosed that the North Wales office, despite being only a decade old, had an average monthly running cost of £130,967 in 2021/22, has seen £703,000 spent on repairs since 2018/19, and sat largely empty. When considering that the First Minister refused to pursue my idea of making the headquarters a flexible working hub for entrepreneurs, the Welsh Government has no excuse for not seeing more staff based there.\"\n\nMr ap Gwynfor added: \"S4C managed to do it, and recently we heard the excellent news that Llenyddiaeth Cymru/Literature Wales will be the first public body with its headquarters based in north Wales, in Ty Newydd Llanystumdwy. The Welsh Government should follow these examples.\"\n\nA Welsh Government spokesman said: \"The Welsh Government has continued to contain its running costs in recent years through tighter controls on the creation of new posts and on external recruitment including for permanent staff. There has been a modest increase to manage the most urgent programme for government priorities, demands of Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"This includes transferring key functions into the Welsh Government including bringing ICT Services in-house and the transfer of Planning & Environment Inspectorate Wales.\"\n\nThey added: \"The Welsh Government has adopted a ‘location neutral’ approach for the majority of posts advertised – this means the post-holder can carry out their responsibilities from any Welsh Government office.\"\n\nThe attached table gives the breakdown of staff by region as at 30 September:\n\nWelsh Government Staff - 30 September 2022\n\nRegion\n\nHeadcount\n\nFTE\n\nNorth Wales\n\n534\n\n504.7\n\nSouth Wales\n\n4,279\n\n4,038.6\n\nMid Wales\n\n447\n\n418.0\n\nWest Wales\n\n614\n\n580.8\n\nOther\n\n148\n\n139.8\n\nTotal\n\n6,022\n\n5,681.9\n\nREAD NEXT:"
