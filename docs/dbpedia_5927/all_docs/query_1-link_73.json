        "text": "Be on your guard against the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. Nothing is covered up that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known. What you have said in the dark shall be heard in the light, and what you have whispered in private rooms shall be shouted from the rooftops.\n\nJesus of Nazareth – Luke 12:1-3\n\nIn September last year I received an email from Chris Franks telling me that a complaint had been made about articles I had written on the subject of the Ynys Môn by-election.\n\nA lot has happened since then which I have not been able to make public before, but am able to make public now. Rather than present it all in one go, I am going to break it down into a series of individual posts, in order to give a sense of how things unfolded over time.\n\nEverything was done by email, so I am publishing the email correspondence in its entirety. I have redacted only personal details such as addresses and phone numbers for obvious, and I hope understandable, reasons.\n\nFrom: Chris Franks\n\nSent: Monday, 9 September 2013, 12:35pm\n\nTo: Michael Haggett\n\nSubject: Complaint\n\nDear Mr Haggett\n\nThe Membership, Disciplinary and Standards Panel of Plaid Cymru has held an initial meeting to consider a complaint received from a member regarding your Blog postings concerning the Mon By election. The initial procedure is for the Membership, Disciplinary and Standards Panel to determine if there are sufficient grounds to pursue the complaint.\n\nI would confirm that the Panel has decided to appoint a Hearing Panel to investigate this complaint. Shaughan Feakes of Ty Gwynfor has been appointed the investigation officer. Shaughan will contact you directly as appropriate.\n\nYou will understand that this matter will be dealt with in the strictest confidence and only the chair of the party is authorised to make any public comment, if at all. My mobile is ----------- if you require clarification regarding the process.\n\nRegards\n\nChris Franks\n\nChair\n\nMembership, Disciplinary and Standards Panel of Plaid Cymru\n\nFrom: Michael Haggett\n\nSent: Wednesday, 11 September 2013, 3:50am\n\nTo: Chris Franks\n\nCc: Rhuanedd Richards [Chief Executive], Shaughan Feakes, Leanne Wood\n\nSubject: Complaint\n\nDear Chris\n\nThank you for your email.\n\nYou have said that a complaint has been made by a member of the party. I need hardly remind you that under the terms of the constitution no disciplinary action can be initiated against a member unless the complaint has been signed by no fewer than five members of the party. A complaint by one member alone cannot be entertained ... unless that member happens to be the President, Leader of the Party Group in the National Assembly or Party Chair. For the complaint to be valid it would also need to be served on both the Chief Executive and myself. I can confirm that I have not received anything.\n\nUnless or until a valid complaint has been made there are no grounds for investigating anything or appointing a Hearing Panel. So I would advise you and the Membership, Disciplinary and Standards Panel not to be premature and I, for my part, will not consider what you have said to have any relevance to me or my standing in the party unless or until that changes.\n\n-\n\nHowever, having made that clear, I would very much welcome answering any criticisms of what I wrote on Syniadau from anyone who wants to take issue with it. Anybody has been able to do that at any time. However I would warn those in positions of responsibility in the party to tread very carefully, for in this matter I have upheld our party, our democratic values and our policies against those in the party who have tried to undermine them. Don't be so foolish as to attempt to take disciplinary action against me when such action would be better directed at prominent members of the party who openly oppose party policy, tell lies about it, and bring our party into disrepute as a result. Better still would be for those in positions of responsibility in the party to follow my lead and try to repair the damage that has been inflicted on us as a party by not being afraid to publicly reaffirm what our policies are.\n\nBest regards\n\nMichael Haggett\n\nSecond Tranche, published 8 February 2014\n\nFrom: Chris Franks\n\nSent: Wednesday, 11 September 2013, 1:44pm\n\nTo: Michael Haggett\n\nSubject: Panel Aelodaeth, Disyblaeth a Safonau / Membership, Disciplinary and Standards Panel\n\nDear Michael\n\nThank you for your email today. I fear that you are referring to the constitution which was superseded at the special conference held earlier this year. I attach for your information the relevant section of the current constitution which might assist.\n\nBest Wishes\n\nChris Franks\n\nRheolau Sefydlog ADS / Standing Orders MDS\n\nFrom: Michael Haggett\n\nSent: Wednesday, 11 September 2013, 5:46pm\n\nTo: Chris Franks\n\nCc: Rhuanedd Richards, Shaughan Feakes, Leanne Wood\n\nSubject: Panel Aelodaeth, Disgyblaeth a Safonau / Membership, Disciplinary and Standards Panel\n\nDear Chris\n\nThank you for attaching the new standing orders. Would you please now send me a copy of the entire constitution.\n\n-\n\nIt is clear that you and the Membership, Disciplinary and Standards Panel are not acting in accordance with these standing orders. Section 3 requires there to be grounds for initiating disciplinary or investigatory procedures. You would therefore need to set out what these grounds are, but you have not done so.\n\nIt is therefore premature for you to move on to Section 4. You cannot appoint a Hearing Panel without having grounds for moving to this stage, and until a Hearing Panel has been appointed, it cannot appoint an Investigating Officer.\n\nYou may of course take whatever steps you wish to determine whether or not to move to Section 4, but they are of no concern to me unless or until you do.\n\n-\n\nFor my part, I would repeat my warning. A complaint against me by one member of the party will not make the party as a whole a public laughing stock. But if the party itself chooses to instigate formal investigatory or disciplinary procedures against me, that investigation will of necessity have to cover the actions and statements of those I have criticized, which makes them subject to disciplinary procedures for damaging the public reputation of the party.\n\nSo go ahead, make my day. The people I have criticized should be held to account, and it is high time the party took action against them. But if the party is so two-faced that it takes action against a member for exposing what they have done, but does not take action against them for what they did to occasion such criticism, it will damage the public reputation of the party even more.\n\nBest regards\n\nMichael Haggett\n\nThird Tranche, published 9 February 2014\n\nFrom: Chris Franks\n\nSent: Thursday, 12 September 2013, 5:21pm\n\nTo: Michael Haggett\n\nSubject: Complaint\n\nDear Michael\n\nI refer to previous emails and would comment as follows.\n\nThe Hearing Panel may potentially deem your comments are damaging or potentially damaging to Plaid Cymru under Section 3.1.111 and that the matter requires further investigation under Section 3.3.2 and have appointed an Investigating Officer under Section 4.2.\n\nAt this stage I cannot comment further.\n\nBest Wishes\n\nChris Franks\n\nChair Membership, Disciplinary and Standards Panel\n\nFrom: Michael Haggett\n\nSent: Friday, 13 September 2013, 2:50am\n\nTo: Chris Franks\n\nCc: Rhuanedd Richards, Shaughan Feakes, Leanne Wood\n\nSubject: Re: Panel Aelodaeth, Disgyblaeth a Safonau / Membership, Disciplinary and Standards Panel\n\nDear Chris\n\nYou are being defensive and evasive; which is a shame, because there is no need for it.\n\nYour last email is rather muddled. Let me make the position clear. Under Standing Orders any complaint or allegation would in the first instance come to the attention of the Membership, Disciplinary and Standards Panel under clause 3.2. Under clause 4.1, a Hearing Panel is appointed by the MDSP to proceed with a specific case but, as set out in clause 3.9, it can only do so if the MDSP resolves that further investigation is required.\n\nIn order to reach that decision, the MDSP is required to evaluate the complaint or allegation under clause 3.3. If the MDSP has done this you as its Chair must, of necessity, be able to tell me what the grounds for the decision are. This means, at the very least, telling me what comment or comments of mine you have found to be of concern. The fact that you are unable to answer even this most basic question clearly demonstrates that the MDSP has acted prematurely, contrary to the procedure set out in Standing Orders.\n\nUntil or unless you are able to tell me what comment or comments have caused concern, and in what way it or they might potentially be deemed to be damaging or potentially damaging to the public reputation of Plaid Cymru, you cannot take matters further.\n\nYou are acting like a man closing his eyes and putting his foot hard down on the accelerator. It's a recipe for disaster. If you are determined to press ahead you must take two steps backwards and do things properly. Until or unless you do so there is no process or procedure to which I am a party or in which I can have any involvement.\n\nBest regards\n\nMichael Haggett\n\nPS. I would remind you that I have not received a copy of the entire constitution.\n\nFrom: Chris Franks\n\nSent: Monday, 16 September 2013, 11:19am\n\nTo: Michael Haggett\n\nSubject: Complaint\n\nDear Michael\n\nI refer to your email of 13 September 2013.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt I take it that you acknowledge that you are the author of the Syniadau Blog. I will confirm that the complaint relates to your comments posted in the run up to the Ynys Mon By-Election of 2 August 2013. The specific complaint concerns the following statement.\n\n“We do not need dishonest politicians like Rhun ap Iorwerth. If he's elected on Thursday he will be a liability to Plaid Cymru for years to come, because he clearly isn't interested in Plaid's policies for Wales. He is a cuckoo who has duped his way into our nest in order to follow a private agenda of his own, or the agenda of a narrow interest group within the party that refuses to accept democratic decisions made by the membership as a whole.”\n\n“If Rhun wants clarity, then we need to be absolutely clear that he is misleading people on this issue by telling blatant lies.”\n\n“If Rhun ap Iorwerth is elected, it would be a tragedy for Plaid Cymru, for Ynys Môn and for Wales.”\n\nShaughan Feakes as Investigation Officers will be contact you to go into the detail of the complaint and receive your comments in a comprehensive manner. It might be helpful if I provide his contact details should you wish to speak to him. ie (H) ----- ------ and (Mob) ----- ------\n\nI would remind you that this matter is to be treated in a strictly confidential manner.\n\nBest Wishes\n\nChris Franks\n\nMembership, Disciplinary and Standards Panel\n\nFrom: Michael Haggett\n\nSent: Monday, 16 September 2013, 6:08pm\n\nTo: Chris Franks\n\nCc: Rhuanedd Richards, Shaughan Feakes, Leanne Wood\n\nSubject: Re: Complaint\n\nDear Chris\n\nBefore anything else, would you please send me a copy of the entire constitution rather than just one section from it. This is now the third time I have had to ask. And yes, I am happy to acknowledge that I am responsible for Syniadau, and that I am the author (MH) of all the articles in it except for a few guest posts ... although I am surprised that you should think there was any doubt about it; or why, if you had such doubts, you would not have raised the matter earlier.\n\n-\n\nThank you for at last providing details of what comment or comments of mine the Membership, Disciplinary and Standards Panel has evaluated and found to be of concern. If you set up a Hearing Panel to consider these comments, you would also need to tell me who has been appointed to it so as to determine whether there are any conflicts of interest. If you yourself are on it, then in any correspondence you have with me you will need to be careful to distinguish in what capacity you are acting. The Hearing Panel will also be required, under Clause 4.3, to determine a timetable and inform all parties of what it is. If and when these details are provided, I will consider myself a party to the investigation and cooperate fully with it.\n\nI have not yet heard anything from Shaughan Feakes, but will be happy to answer any questions he cares to send me. Because of the way in which you have sought to handle this matter before now, I must insist that things be done in writing so that there can be no doubt or ambiguity about what has been said. This might have been avoided if you had chosen, at least in the first instance, to adopt a less confrontational approach.\n\nI think it would also be appropriate to say—especially as you have now said it twice and appear to be relying on it—that this matter is not confidential. Under Clause 9.1 the restriction is that no public statements should be made by any of the parties, but only by the Chair of the Party, and this restriction only applies for a certain period. Several people have and will be privately informed of what is happening.\n\n-\n\nAs I warned you in both my previous emails, making the decision to formally investigate any comments I have made will of necessity extend the matter to those about whom these comments were made. You have now informed me which comments are of concern. The first two are contained in this post of 28 July 2013\n\nRhun ap Iorwerth is lying about Wylfa B\n\nand the third is in this post of 31 July 2013\n\nPurely a matter of luck\n\nIn so far as these comments relate to the matter of Rhun ap Iorwerth's dishonesty, I must first ask what other action and decisions the MSDP has taken about it. Would you please confirm whether or not you have evaluated what he said on Sunday Supplement on 28 July 2013 and on Pawb a'i Farn on 29 July 2013. If the MDSP has conducted itself with due diligence and in an even-handed manner, I would expect you to have done this as part of your general remit under Clause 3.2iii of Standing Orders. However you would, of necessity, have to do this in evaluating the complaint against me and making the decision to appoint a Hearing Panel.\n\nFor my part, I am now making a formal complaint against Rhun for lying about Plaid Cymru's policy on nuclear power on these two programmes, thus damaging the public reputation of the party. I would not ordinarily have chosen to do this because I believe public exposure of lies made in public is a more appropriate way of dealing with such people than making an internal complaint; but if you choose to instigate formal investigatory or disciplinary procedures against me, you leave me with no other choice. By making this complaint, I will have the right to be kept informed of the progress and outcome of the disciplinary process against Rhun.\n\nThe MDSP is, of course, free to evaluate this complaint and decide not to appoint a Hearing Panel to investigate it. But, as I said before, if the party is so two-faced that it takes action against a member for exposing senior members of the party when they tell lies, but does not take action against them for what they did to occasion such criticism, it will damage the public reputation of the party even more.\n\nThe party would also have to account for why you are taking action against me now for my criticism of Rhun, but took no action against me for what I said in criticism of Elfyn Llwyd, Bob Parry and Dafydd Elis-Thomas when they told essentially similar lies. The details and supporting evidence are in these posts on Syniadau:\n\nElfyn Llwyd owes us an apology\n\nCorrecting Confusion on Ynys Môn\n\nHow can anyone trust such a blatant liar?\n\nThis matter is a running sore within the party and needs to be dealt with. I am therefore also making formal complaints against Elfyn, Bob and Dafydd for telling lies about party policy on nuclear power, thus damaging the public reputation of the party. Please keep me fully informed of the progress and outcome of the disciplinary process as it relates to all four.\n\nFor my part, I have no objection to the complaint against me and my own complaints being considered collectively by one Hearing Panel (subject to there being no conflict of interest involved) and by one Investigating Officer. However I am making separate formal complaints against each one individually, and will understand if the individuals concerned would like the complaints against them to be considered separately. I will need to be kept informed of the progress and outcome of each complaint, whether they are handled together or separately.\n\n-\n\nFinally, although the complaint against me appears to relate to what I said about Rhun ap Iorwerth's dishonesty, it is possible that other aspects of what I wrote in the comments you quoted are of concern. Please advise me whether this is the case because, if so, I might well make similar formal complaints on the grounds that it is not possible to properly consider my criticism of others without also considering the actions or statements that occasioned such criticism.\n\nThank you for making my day.\n\nBest regards\n\nMichael Haggett\n\nFourth Tranche, published 11 February 2014\n\nFrom: Chris Franks\n\nSent: Tuesday, 24 September 2013, 12:01pm\n\nTo: Michael Haggett\n\nCc: Rhuanedd Richards, Shaughan Feakes\n\nSubject: Re: Complaint\n\nDear Michael\n\nI acknowledge your complaints about other party members.

But, apart from that, there are still several other matters that require a response from you. As you seem to be wilfully ignoring them, I will remind you of what they are:\n\n1. The names of the people on the Hearing Panel.\n\n2. The timetable for the investigation.\n\n3. Whether the MSDP had already evaluated Rhun ap Iorwerth's statements on Sunday Supplement and Pawb a'i Farn, and what action or decisions you had made regarding them.\n\n4. Whether, apart from the matter of Rhun's dishonesty, there are any other aspects of what I said in the comments you quoted which you found to be of concern.\n\nYou need to be more explicit about the MDSP's evaluation of my complaints against Rhun, Elfyn, Bob and Dafydd. What is \"the appropriate time\"? I have brought their lies to your attention and you are therefore obliged to actively evaluate the matter now, even if the party turned a blind eye to what they said before. You cannot postpone this or do nothing. At the very least, I would expect you to have forwarded my complaint to the other members of the MDSP so that they can see the evidence and evaluate these complaints prior to your next meeting. Please inform me whether you have done this and when your next meeting will be held.\n\nAs I have said before, how anyone can possibly evaluate and decide to formally investigate the complaint against me for what I said about Rhun without at the same time evaluating and proceeding with a formal investigation against Rhun for what he said is quite beyond reason, and therefore flawed. If what I said on Syniadau about Rhun's dishonesty is factually correct (and even the most cursory examination would have shown that it is, not least because I included full details to back it up) then there can be no doubt that what he said has damaged the public reputation of the party, not what I said in criticizing him for doing it.\n\nI would also remind you, again, that you have misread clause 9.1. It makes no mention of confidentiality. The only restriction is on making public statements, and this only applies for a certain period. If you hoped that nobody else would get to hear about the two-faced way in which you have handled this matter so far, you miscalculated badly. However there is now, if you treat my complaints against Rhun, Elfyn, Bob and Dafydd with due diligence, an opportunity for you to resolve the matter in a fair and even-handed way. Be careful to do so.\n\nBest regards\n\nMichael Haggett\n\nFifth Tranche, published 12 February 2014\n\nFrom: Michael Haggett\n\nSent: Monday, 30 September 2013, 10:59am\n\nTo: Chris Franks\n\nCc: Rhuanedd Richards, Shaughan Feakes, Leanne Wood\n\nSubject: Re: Complaint\n\nDear Chris\n\nYet another week has come, and I must again remind you that you have not answered several of my questions.

The Hearing will be held at Ty Gwynfor, Atlantic Wharf, Cardiff. You are entitled to attend, present evidence both oral and written and also be represented at the Hearing. The same rights will be accorded to the complainant. Any written evidence should be presented by 5.00 pm Friday 16 October.\n\nPlease confirm that you have received this email.\n\nThe complaints made by Elin Jones AM against you are;\n\nI can confirm that I am making my complaint against Michael Hagget, the author of the blog Syniadau, on the basis that the content of the blogs of July 20th, July 28th, July 30th and August 15th all included statements that were damaging to the public reputation of Plaid Cymru (Standing Order 3.1.iii). The blog can be found here: http://syniadau--buildinganindependentwales.blogspot.co.uk/\n\nI have included here 3 sentences/paragraphs in particular that were damaging:\n\n“We do not need dishonest politicians like Rhun ap Iorwerth. If he's elected on Thursday he will be a liability to Plaid Cymru for years to come, because he clearly isn't interested in Plaid's policies for Wales. He is a cuckoo who has duped his way into our nest in order to follow a private agenda of his own, or the agenda of a narrow interest group within the party that refuses to accept democratic decisions made by the membership as a whole.”\n\n“If Rhun wants clarity, then we need to be absolutely clear that he is misleading people on this issue by telling blatant lies.”\n\n“If Rhun ap Iorwerth is elected, it would be a tragedy for Plaid Cymru, for Ynys Môn and for Wales.”\n\nYou have indicated previously that you have a copy of the relevant Constitution and Standing Orders so I only include below the relevant clauses relating to the formal hearing\n\n4.6 Where they resolve that there is a case to answer, they shall convene a formal hearing which will:\n\n4.6i Receive and examine the report of the Investigating Officer\n\n4.6ii Hear from and examine the evidence of the complainant(s) or\n\ntheir representatives.\n\n4.6iii Hear from and examine the evidence of the person(s) being the\n\nsubject of the complaint(s) or their representatives.\n\n4.6iv Either party may submit written evidence which shall be received\n\nand examined.\n\n4.7 The Panel will determine the outcome and dismiss the case, or alternatively impose appropriate sanction where culpability is established. This decision will usually be made and conveyed to all parties on the day of the formal hearing. However in exceptional circumstances the Hearing Panel may reserve judgement for further deliberation.\n\n5 SANCTIONS\n\n5.1 Sanctions that may be imposed may include, but are not limited to\n\n5.1i Denial of an application for membership\n\n5.1ii Admonition\n\n5.1iii Formal written warning\n\n5.1iv Instructions as to future conduct;\n\n5.1v Suspension from membership for a period not exceeding 12 months;\n\n5.1vi Exclusion from the Party.\n\n5.2 In determining sanctions, the Hearing Panel shall consider whether the imposition of a sanction is necessary at all and, if so, whether a lesser sanction will suffice.\n\n5.3 Resolution of culpability and determination of an appropriate sanction may be reached by majority decision within the Hearing Panel where unanimity is not achieved.\n\n5.4 The Hearing Panel shall maintain a written record of its deliberations and findings.\n\nYours Sincerely\n\nChris Franks\n\nChair Membership, Discipline and Standards Panel\n\nSeventh Tranche, published 14 February 2014\n\nIn my email to Chris of 14 October, I had told him that I would take steps to have him removed from his position as Chair of the Membership, Discipline and Standards Panel because he continued to refuse to answer my questions. Although Chris then sent me two further emails, he still didn't answer them.\n\nIn any organization, people have different roles and responsibilities. Chris had been given this role and responsibility, and therefore I dealt with him, made it clear to him what he was doing wrong, and gave him every possible opportunity to do his job properly. It was only appropriate to get other people involved when it became obvious that Chris had no intention of either answering my questions or doing his job properly.\n\nFrom: Michael Haggett\n\nSent: Monday, 21 October 2013, 3:26pm\n\nTo: Leanne Wood\n\nSubject: Proposals for resolving our problem\n\nDear Leanne\n\nI have kept you informed of correspondence between Chris Franks and myself by sending you copies of our emails, but I am now writing to you directly as leader of the party.\n\nAs anybody can see (and this includes a number of people from whom I have taken advice) Chris is either completely out of his depth as Chairman of the MDSP or, from a more charitable perspective, that dealing with too many other commitments means he does not have sufficient time to devote to this particular job. I must therefore ask that you replace him with someone who is able to do the job properly.\n\nDespite my warnings, Chris appears determined to press ahead with disciplinary action against me with a cavalier disregard for his obligation to follow the correct procedures and act in a fair and even-handed manner, and is defensive and evasive when put on the spot about it. There are many questions which he has simply refused to answer.\n\nHe has also not done anything with regard to the formal complaint that I made against Rhun ap Iorwerth, something I did on the grounds that it was wholly unreasonable for any disciplinary procedure to hold me to account for my criticism of his dishonesty without at the same time holding Rhun to account for telling the lies that occasioned such criticism. And because it would be unfair to single out Rhun for telling essentially the same lie as Elfyn Llwyd, Bob Parry and Dafydd Elis-Thomas had told before him, natural justice requires that all four of them should be held to account.\n\n-\n\nThe onus is on you, as leader of the party, to act. If the current farce is allowed to continue, it has the potential to be hugely damaging to the party. I assure you that I have no desire to see this happen, and therefore want to propose this solution.\n\nThe issue at hand is public perception about Plaid's policy on nuclear energy. A series of high-profile members of the party have made public statements in the media which are untrue, and the general public (and probably a good number of Plaid Cymru members as well) have therefore been misled about what our policy is. This is what needs to be corrected.\n\nYou as leader of the party, backed up by Llyr Huws Gruffydd as our Environment, Energy and Agriculture spokesman, need to make prominent public statements saying, explicitly, that it has not been our policy to treat a new nuclear power station on or next to an existing nuclear site any differently from a new nuclear power station somewhere else, and that Plaid's policy is one of total opposition to the construction of any new nuclear power stations.\n\nI am not asking you to make any explicit public criticism of Elfyn, Bob, Dafydd and Rhun for having said something different. They do need to be reprimanded for making these untrue statements, but this can be done internally to spare them and the party any public embarrassment.\n\nMy motivation throughout has been to stand up for Plaid Cymru and our policies in the face of those who have tried to undermine our position on this issue by telling lies about it. I, therefore, will be satisfied if you and Llyr make these public statements.\n\nBest regards\n\nMichael Haggett\n\nThe following emails are not in strict chronological order.

He still hasn't answered most of my questions, but at least there has been some action and I'm grateful to you for that.\n\nI'll continue to keep you informed of what is happening by copying you in on emails so that you can decide whether to intervene at some stage in the future, if it becomes necessary.\n\n-\n\nThere were, however, two parts to my last email. To be frank, any internal investigations or disciplinary procedures are a relatively minor matter, and I am not copying this direct email to you to any of those involved in that process. My intention is simply to raise the matter of being clear in public about what party policy is, because what we as a party say in public is much more important.\n\nI must admit that I can't see any reason why we should be reticent about stating what our policy on nuclear power is. It is crystal clear, both in the 2010 motion and the 2011 motion (some of the associated wording is very slightly different, but not the essential parts) that our policy is to be totally opposed to the construction of any new nuclear power stations, and that Wylfa B would be a \"new nuclear power station\". I have no idea where the narrative of being \"opposed to nuclear, except on existing nuclear sites\" has come from. It may, perhaps, have been party policy at some time in the past, but it certainly hasn't been party policy since the September 2010 conference, if not before.\n\nTwo things have happened recently which I believe offer us a golden opportunity to make the sort of statement I urged you and Llyr to make now, not as something that would appear to be motivated by any idea of \"correcting\" what had been said before, but as a completely \"natural\" response to current political events. The first is that our membership has just overwhelmingly reaffirmed our policy of being totally opposed to any new nuclear power stations, with no distinction between whether they are on new or existing nuclear sites. The second is the deal done to construct Hinkley C, which will escalate electricity prices for decades to come at a time when all political parties are looking for ways to reduce the burden of higher electricity bills, and add to the burden on general taxation through hidden subsidies to cover the underwriting of security, insurance, cost over-run and decommissioning risks.\n\nSo please help me out on this. Is there a reason why you would be unwilling to make such a statement?\n\nBest regards\n\nMichael\n\nEighth Tranche, published 16 February 2014\n\nFrom: Michael Haggett\n\nSent: Monday, 21 October 2013, 3:30pm\n\nTo: Chris Franks\n\nCc: Rhuanedd Richards, Shaughan Feakes, Leanne Wood, Elin Jones\n\nSubject: Re: Complaint\n\nDear Chris\n\nThank you for your email of 19 October.\n\nThe first thing to note is that you are still refusing to answer my questions. This is a list of the simple, factual information that you haven't provided:\n\n1. The names of the people on the Hearing Panel.\n\n2. The timetable for the investigation.\n\n3. Whether the MDSP had already evaluated Rhun ap Iorwerth's statements on Sunday Supplement and Pawb a'i Farn, and what action or decisions you had made regarding them. As so much time has passed since I asked this question, you will now need to be specific about when you did this.\n\n4. Whether, apart from the matter of Rhun's dishonesty, there are any other aspects of what I said in the comments you quoted which you found to be of concern.\n\n5. What action you have taken with regard to my formal complaints against Rhun, Elfyn Bob and Dafydd, specifically:\n\n5.1 Whether you have informed them of the complaints against them.\n\n5.2 Whether you have set up Hearing Panels.\n\n5.3 The names of the people on those Hearing Panels.\n\n5.4 The name of the Investigating Officers and timetable for the investigations.\n\n6. Whether you have kept the other members of the MDSP informed of our correspondence. Again, you will now need to be specific about when you did so.\n\nAs you had not even set a timetable for the investigation of the matter, it is wholly bizarre that you should now tell me that it has been completed, and even more bizarre that this so-called \"investigation\" has not involved asking me one single question. Once again, you are blatantly ignoring the party's standing orders.\n\nEven more incredibly, you have now informed me that the deadline for presenting written evidence was 16 October ... three days before you sent your email.\n\nIn order for you to proceed with any hearing, you first need to disclose the case against me. As your decision to hold a hearing is based on the Investigating Officer's report, I therefore need to receive a copy of it. I would also need to receive a copy of any evidence the complainant might wish to offer in support of her allegation. Only then will I be in a position to decide what evidence or representation I would need to properly defend myself in any hearing.\n\n-\n\nI would also remind you once again of the wider implications of this matter and the damage that will be caused to the reputation of Plaid Cymru if you do not act in a fair, impartial and even-handed manner.\n\nYou have a duty to evaluate the conduct of any member of the party, whether through a complaint or as part of the MDSP's general remit under Clause 3.2iii of Standing Orders, and I have absolutely no objection to being held to account for anything I have said. But it is wholly unreasonable to decide to set up a Hearing Panel and appoint an Investigating Officer to hear a case against me for what I said about Rhun ap Iorwerth's dishonesty without, at the same time, following the same procedure with regard to Rhun for telling the lies that occasioned such criticism.\n\nSo far you have refused to act even-handedly, but you are still able to put things right by taking exactly the same steps which you have chosen to take against me against Rhun. Natural justice requires that you must also take the same steps against Elfyn, Bob and Dafydd, because they told essentially similar lies and it would be unfair to take action against Rhun alone. Your refusal to act in an impartial manner shows blatant bias and prejudice on your part; and it was because because you had failed to do your job that I made formal complaints against all four, so as to leave you with absolutely no excuse for failing to act with proper diligence. The Chair of the MDSP needs to take their responsibilities very much more seriously than you have done so far, so as to avoid bringing the party into even further disrepute. It is only fair to inform you that I have now taken steps to have you replaced, as the deadline I set in my previous email of 14 October has expired. It certainly spurred you into action, but the action required of you was to answer my questions.\n\n-\n\nI must therefore insist that the MDSP postpones any hearing against me until such time as it has disclosed the case against me and the evidence to support it, and until the complaints against Rhun, Elfyn, Bob and Dafydd have been properly investigated. I understand that they might wish to have the matter treated separately, and I fully respect that. But as the case against me (so far as I can tell, since I have not received an answer to question 4 or a copy of the Investigating Officer's report) hinges entirely on whether Rhun was or was not telling the truth, it is impossible to make a proper judgment in one case without having considered the other cases as well.\n\nBest regards\n\nMichael Haggett\n\nThe Investigation Report, published 17 February 2014\n\nAfter Leanne had asked Dafydd Trystan to intervene in order to make sure that disciplinary procedures were properly followed and that everyone was treated properly and fairly, I received a flurry of emails and a small mountain of information. I'll publish all of this in the next post.\n\nThe most important piece of information I was given was the investigation report. But before I publish it, there are some things which I need to make clear.\n\nI've taken the decision to make what has happened public in order to highlight the hypocrisy and double-standards of the people involved in these disciplinary proceedings. As is already clear from the correspondence with Chris Franks, he was determined to press ahead irrespective of the rules set out in Standing Orders, and ignored nearly all of the questions I asked and the warnings I gave him about it. Because of this wall of silence, I had no way of knowing exactly what was happening behind the scenes. I'm sure that I still don't know everything, but I now know an awful lot more than I did at the time.\n\n-\n\nThe investigation and the Investigating Officer's report are key parts of Plaid Cymru's new disciplinary procedure that did not exist before. The investigation is crucially important because it forms the basis on which the Hearing Panel must decide whether there is a case to answer, and it is also an important piece of evidence in its own right at the disciplinary hearing. In normal circumstances (see Clause 4.2 of Standing Orders) the investigation would be carried out by Plaid Cymru's Chief Executive, Rhuanedd Richards. But she, entirely properly, declined this role because she had worked with Rhun ap Iorwerth for a number of years at the BBC, and therefore might have been seen to have a conflict of interest. The responsibility was therefore passed to Shaughan Feakes.\n\nIn a previous comment, I described Shaughan as a \"senior member of staff\" at Plaid Cymru's head office in Cardiff. I have been taken to task for using that description, because it might be taken to imply that he was one of those included in my phrase \"people in positions of power\". I did not mean to give that impression. By senior, I only meant that he was rather older than most of the other people who work in Ty Gwynfor.\n\nI don't want to embarrass him in any way by giving a few personal details, but he is semi-retired and works for Plaid on a part-time basis. He is one of many people who give their time and effort to the party out of commitment and dedication, and without these people the party simply couldn't function. I've spoken to him on the phone a few times in the past about other things, and he has always been helpful and courteous to me.\n\n-\n\nChris told me in his email of 16 September that Shaughan would contact me \"to go into the detail of the complaint and receive [my] comments in a comprehensive manner\". This never happened, and I specifically told Chris, twice, that I was waiting for him to contact me. I copied Shaughan in on my email correspondence with Chris, and expected him to email me. I didn't see how it would be possible for him to \"go into the detail of the complaint\" without sending me a copy of it, though I could perhaps understand that some parts of the complaint might need to be redacted. The idea that he would read it out to me over the phone was, to me at least, unthinkable.\n\nAs will become clear, the investigation was conducted and concluded without me being asked a single question. I therefore made some very harsh criticisms of Shaughan, both for not getting in touch with me, and for what he wrote in the report because it presented a completely one-sided picture. Yet even at the time, I realized that he had been put in an awkward, if not impossible, situation. This is what I said in an email on 11 December:\n\nShaughan conducted his so-called investigation without contacting me or asking me a single question, in direct contravention of Clause 4.2. This was despite him being copied in on all correspondence, in which I specifically noted on more than one occasion that I was still waiting to hear from him. He was also instructed to contact me to \"go into the detail of the complaint\", but did not do so. I was kept entirely in the dark about the complaint, only receiving a copy of it five weeks after his so-called investigation had been completed and the report written.\n\nBy attaching his name to this joke of a document, he must bear personal responsibility for it and fully deserves to be reprimanded. However I would not want to be overly critical of his behaviour. As someone who works in Ty Gwynfor, he was severely compromised and probably put into an impossible position, and it is only fair that these mitigating circumstances are taken into account.\n\nNevertheless, the end result is that Plaid Cymru staff resources have been improperly used to prepare and present evidence in favour of one member of the party, while deliberately and completely ignoring the right of another member of the party to receive the same consideration. I had every right to expect that an equivalent amount of time and effort should have been given to investigating and presenting evidence that would show that what I said about Rhun's untruthfulness was justified.\n\nYet even this was premature. For as I was later to discover (on 20 January to be precise) Shaughan did in fact try to contact me by phone, but didn't get through because he was using old contact details. At the same time I also discovered that Plaid Cymru's lawyers had given him specific legal advice to conduct the investigation by phone rather than by email or letter. This puts things in a completely different light.\n\nIt is now clear that Shaughan was not to blame for failing to contact me. From my point of view, I can't see what would have prevented him from sending me a short email to say that he had tried to get in touch with me, but there is probably a good explanation for this too. Shaughan would in all probability have discussed the matter with Chris, and therefore believed that it was Chris's responsibility to tell me this. I don't know for sure, but I think it is quite possible that Chris might even have instructed him to ignore what I said in the emails I copied to him and not contact me by email at all, for he specifically went so far as to tell the other members of the Hearing Panel (Lisa Turnbull and Farida Aslam) that if they received any emails from me they should delete them.\n\nIn short, while I still have some criticisms of Shaughan, I have to say that with hindsight they are minor and completely outweighed by the mitigating circumstances of the impossible position he was put into. So I want to take this opportunity to apologize to Shaughan for the harshness of my criticism. Others are far, far more to blame for what happened than he was. I think it is important to say this now, before I publish the report, rather than wait for it to become apparent later.\n\nNinth Tranche, published 18 February 2014\n\nFrom: Dafydd Trystan\n\nSent: Wednesday, 23 October 2013, 7:38am\n\nTo: Michael Haggett\n\nSubject: Re: Proposals for resolving our problem\n\nDear Michael\n\nLeanne Wood has referred your correspondence to me as Party Chair relating to the disciplinary process.

The blog can be found here:\n\nhttp://syniadau--buildinganindependentwales.blogspot.co.uk\n\nI have included here 3 sentences/paragraphs in particular that were damaging:\n\n“We do not need dishonest politicians like Rhun ap Iorwerth. If he's elected on Thursday he will be a liability to Plaid Cymru for years to come, because he clearly isn't interested in Plaid's policies for Wales. He is a cuckoo who has duped his way into our nest in order to follow a private agenda of his own, or the agenda of a narrow interest group within the party that refuses to accept democratic decisions made by the membership as a whole.”\n\n“If Rhun wants clarity, then we need to be absolutely clear that he is misleading people on this issue by telling blatant lies.”\n\n“If Rhun ap Iorwerth is elected, it would be a tragedy for Plaid Cymru, for Ynys Môn and for Wales.”\n\nThe context of these blog postings was the Ynys Mon by-election – the most important by-election for Plaid Cymru since Ceredigion 2001. It was an excellent campaign with a perfect candidate for Ynys Mon. The people of Ynys Mon agree with me on that.\n\nHowever, for a member of Plaid Cymru to seek to destabilise the campaign by accusing the candidate of “misleading people” and “telling blatant lies” is unacceptable behaviour. These statements were used over and over again on social media against Rhun by the Labour Party and the blog became the subject of an article in the Western Mail.\n\nLuckily for Plaid Cymru the blog is not widely read and had next-to-no-impact on the people of Ynys Mon. Even if they did hear of the blog’s content, I am sure they would have known Rhun’s integrity well enough to trust him over an unknown blogger.\n\nThe blog was however a distraction for Plaid Cymru workers during the election and was demoralising for those canvassers who heard of its existence during the campaign. I know because I was there.\n\nAs the Party’s Director of Communication, I chose to ignore the blogs and not contact the author during the campaign. To do so could have run the risk of stirring up more negative blog activity.\n\nHowever, after the election was over and now again almost a month later, then the content of the blogs cannot be ignored.\n\nThey damaged and had the potential to cause considerable damage to the Party’s byelection on Ynys Mon.\n\nThe author showed no party loyalty or respect for the hundreds of party volunteers who gave hours and days and weeks of their time to Plaid Cymru in Ynys Mon in July 2013.\n\nIf this Party does not fight and win elections then it has no power to change the fate of Wales. It is not a one-issue protest group. It is a national political party. Any attempt to undermine your own party’s candidate and campaign during an election period should not be tolerated by this Party.\n\nDiolch\n\nelin\n\nElin Jones AC/AM\n\nPlaid Cymru\n\nAberystwyth\n\nFrom: Chris Franks\n\nSent: Wednesday, 23 October 2013, 2:17pm\n\nTo: Michael Haggett\n\nSubject: Complaint\n\nDear Michael\n\nThank you for your email of 21 October.\n\nHere is my response to your list of questions and comments.\n\n1.

I've included the entire correspondence on these matters in date order as part of this email. Start reading at the bottom and work your way up.\n\nSince you wrote, I have received a flurry of emails from Chris. I am grateful that the combined efforts of Leanne and yourself have prompted Chris into action. Some of my questions have been answered, but many have not. I still require answers to the outstanding questions without further evasion.\n\n-\n\nThe emails and attached documents I have received today contain a lot of information, which it will take me some time to digest and respond to. However I can make this point now:\n\nMy complaints against Rhun, Elfyn, Bob and Dafydd must be properly evaluated by the MDSP without delay. This is a responsibility that cannot be postponed. Elin's complaint against me was made on 30 August, and I was informed that a Hearing Panel had been set up on 9 September, just over a week later. My complaints were made on 16 September, and should have been evaluated within an equivalent timescale; yet more than five weeks have passed without any action being taken.\n\nThe MDSP must have met before 19 October (the date on which Chris informed me of the Hearing Panel's decision to proceed with a formal hearing) and there is absolutely no excuse for them not to have evaluated my complaints and then made a decision about whether or not to appoint Hearing Panels for Rhun, Elfyn, Bob and Dafydd at that meeting, if not before. This failure to treat Elin's complaint and my complaints even-handedly and impartially is confirmation that they have acted, and are still acting, in an unfair and blatantly biased manner. This must be corrected immediately.\n\nThis may not be the fault of the entire MDSP, however. The only person on the MDSP I have dealt with has been Chris. For all I know, he might not have forwarded our correspondence to them beforehand or put the matter on the agenda. From his refusal to answer my questions about it and the completely ridiculous comment he has just made about other members of the Hearing Panel returning documents and deleting emails, it seems highly likely that he has been keeping other members of the MDSP in the dark about what has been happening.\n\nBest regards\n\nMichael Haggett\n\nTenth Tranche, published 21 February 2014\n\nFrom: Dafydd Trystan\n\nSent: Thursday, 24 October 2013, 4:44am\n\nTo: Michael Haggett\n\nCc: Leanne Wood\n\nSubject: Re: Complaint\n\nDear Michael\n\nThank you for your note, and for enclosing the significant amount of correspondence between yourself and Chris Franks as Chair of the Panel.\n\nMy concern here as Chair relates to matters of process, and as such you raise two two significant and (in process terms) distinct issues:\n\ni) The timing of your hearing. The correspondence attached notes a date for your disciplinary hearing. You make the point in your Email to Chris that you have received a considerable amount of information recently. It strikes me as entirely reasonable if you were to request, during the next day or so, a short delay so that you may evaluate the information and prepare properly for the hearing.\n\niii) The timetable for dealing with the complaint against Rhun ap Iorwerth and others. I am not going to begin micro-managing the workload of the Panel charged with dealing with such matters on behalf of the party. It would for example, be reasonable for such a panel to deal sequentially with complaints received, dealing with a certain number - say two or three - at each convened meeting. I would however expect the panel to a) deal with all complaints within a reasonable time frame; and b) to where appropriate keep complainants informed of the progress of their complaint. Accordingly, I shall be writing to the Chair of the Panel requesting information regarding the timetable for dealing with your complaint. That information will clearly be shared with you once available.\n\nYour correspondence raises one more issue, which I feel I should consider - and that is the confidentiality of the process. There seems to be some discussion in your correspondence regarding the confidentiality of this process. It is therefore appropriate for me a Chair of the Party to rule on this matter, and I rule that the disciplinary process is strictly confidential - and I shall inform all parties to the process of this ruling.\n\nThank you for taking the time to write to me, and for replying promptly to my correspondence from yesterday.\n\nShould you have any further concerns or questions about the process please do not hesitate to contact me.

This meeting has unfortunately been postponed. You will be notified shortly about the new time/date of the meeting.\n\nKind regards\n\nFrom: Michael Haggett\n\nSent: Monday, 28 October 2013, 1:15pm\n\nTo: Dafydd Trystan\n\nCc: Rhuanedd Richards, Shaughan Feakes, Leanne Wood, Chris Franks, Elin Jones\n\nSubject: Re: Complaint\n\nDear Dafydd\n\nThank you for your email of 24 October. I will deal with this first as the points are quite simple.\n\nWith regard to point i, please re-read the final paragraph of my email of 21 October. I note from -------'s email that the hearing has now been postponed.\n\nWith regard to point iii (you don't appear to have a point ii), you will need to be more active and thorough than you anticipate. The point you seem to be trying to avoid is that although Chris is chair of the panel that has been, as you say, \"charged with dealing with such matters on behalf of the party\", it is perfectly clear that Chris has handled his responsibilities badly. You have therefore been asked to intervene to ensure that all procedures have been properly followed and that everyone is treated properly and fairly. This means that everything that has not been done properly will need to be re-addressed. You have now been given all the details, so please get on and deal with it.\n\nAs to confidentiality, no ruling from you is required. Clause 9.1 of standing orders says that public statements can only be made by the Chair, but that this restriction only applies for a certain period. Chris tried to make out that it said something different, and I pointed out that he was wrong. You would be well advised not to make the same mistake. Very clearly this matter cannot be confidential, because I must be allowed to inform others about what is happening. How else, for example, could I take advice or have the option of choosing others to represent me? As you can see from the correspondence, I am keeping others informed about what is happening and I will continue to do this.\n\n-\n\nI will now turn to the other matters. The package of information I have been given contains numerous documents. Most of these are relatively uncontentious, so I will focus on the document which is of most serious concern, namely the Investigating Officer's report.\n\nAs I said before, it is bizarre that a so-called investigation has taken place in which I was not asked a single question. Page 1 of the report contains the extraordinary statement that, \"Michael Haggett has not responded to my several requests to speak with him.\" I have not received any such request.\n\nChris told me on 9 September that Shaughan would contact me, and said the same again on 16 September. In my reply of 16 September I specifically noted that he had not yet done so, but that I would be happy to answer any questions he cared to send me. In my email of 24 September I repeated that Shaughan had not been in contact with me.\n\nThe question that must now be asked is why what I said, more than once, was deliberately ignored. The result is an investigation that was fundamentally flawed because no-one asked me any questions, despite the clear obligation set out in clause 4.2 for it to make enquiries of all parties. Clause 4.3 requires that a timetable for the investigation be determined at the outset, and for all parties to be informed of what it is. I repeatedly asked Chris to provide this information, but he refused to do so. If he had, the problem would have been flagged up and could have been dealt with weeks ago.\n\nI must therefore insist that a new investigation is held. It would take far too long to list all the other inadequacies of the investigation as reflected its report, but this is the most important of them: The central question is whether what Rhun said on Sunday Supplement and Pawb a'i Farn about Plaid's nuclear policy—specifically that it makes a distinction between new nuclear power stations on new sites and new nuclear power stations on existing nuclear sites—is or is not true. If Rhun lied, there can be no possible objection to me calling him a liar. It is a simple matter of fact that can easily be ascertained by competent investigation. Everything hinges on this, yet the report skirts round the issue. The new investigation must properly address this question.\n\nBecause of what has happened, it is now foolish to believe that a fair and balanced investigation can be carried out by anyone within Plaid Cymru. Clause 4.2 of Standing Orders makes provision for an external investigator to be appointed in exceptional circumstances like these, and I would insist this is now done. I believe it would be best if the investigation concerning me, and the investigations concerning Rhun, Elfyn, Bob and Dafydd were all conducted by one person from outside the party.\n\n-\n\nThe flawed investigation is only one of many problems with the way the process has been handled. At every stage, Chris has been defensive and evasive, and it is now becoming clear why he was doing so. It is quite appalling that the Hearing Panel was presented with a completely one-sided document that takes no account whatsoever of anything I had to say, but it was made even worse by giving the impression that I was refusing to say anything. As if that wasn't bad enough, it is clear from Chris's email of 23 October that the other members of the Hearing Panel had not even been given copies of my correspondence with Chris, and were therefore denied the opportunity to consider what I had to say in those emails.\n\nThrough these actions, Chris engineered a situation in which the other members of the Hearing Panel were asked to make a decision about whether there was a case for me to answer without being presented with the evidence that would enable them to make a proper decision. This is a double-dose of blatant wrongdoing on his part, and is much more serious than Chris being incompetent and evasive. As a result, what little confidence I might have had in Chris before has completely disappeared, and I must again insist he is replaced by someone who will do a better job.\n\nBest regards\n\nMichael\n\nFrom: Dafydd Trystan\n\nSent: Tuesday, 29 October 2013, 5:42am\n\nTo: Michael Haggett\n\nCc: Leanne Wood, Chris Franks\n\nSubject: Re: Complaint\n\nDear Michael\n\nThank you for your Email dated 28th of October.\n\nOn the two issues of process identified from your original correspondence:\n\ni) I am reassured that the postponement of the hearing, will allow you ample opportunity to prepare and present your case to the panel.\n\nii) I am informed that the timetable for dealing with the complaint against Rhun ap Iorwerth and others is being drawn up, and am assured that once set, that timetable will be communicated to you.\n\nYour Email also presents a number of comments regarding the matters at hand.

You are burying your head in the sand. My questions will not go away just because people refuse to answer them, and it is your job to make sure they are answered.\n\nAs chair of the party, you must take responsibility for internal party machinery and representing the voice of members. On both counts, this matter falls squarely onto your shoulders. But even if you question this, Leanne has specifically asked you to ensure that the party's rules are being adhered to and that everyone is treated properly and fairly. This is an ongoing responsibility that you cannot shirk. Therefore I will continue to write you until such time as the disciplinary processes relating to Rhun, Elfyn, Bob, Dafydd and myself have been resolved, or until you have been relieved of that responsibility.\n\n-\n\nI'm sure you enjoy the prestige and prominence of being chair, but the job also involves dealing with matters that you'd prefer not to deal with. I can understand why you want to distance yourself from what has happened, for it has been a farce from the very beginning. But by turning a blind eye to blatant wrongdoing, and by refusing to act when asked to do so, you are making yourself complicit in that wrongdoing. Chris's reputation is now in tatters. Do you really want yours to go the same way?\n\nI can't say I particularly care about either Chris's reputation or yours, but I do care about our party. So I urge you again to act to prevent Plaid Cymru becoming even more of a laughing stock on this issue than it is at present. You owe this to the membership that only a month ago overwhelmingly voted to reaffirm our position on nuclear power at conference ... and, as set out in section 15.2i of the constitution, it is conference that is responsible for determining the party's policy. No matter how \"inconvenient\" this may be for those in positions of power in the party, our rules are quite clear.\n\nDo I need to remind you of the big picture? A series of prominent members of the party have told lies about Plaid Cymru's policy on nuclear energy. But instead of taking action against them for telling lies, the party is trying to take action against me for exposing them as liars. I have no objection to being held to account for what I have said, but I will not tolerate the party turning a blind eye to what they said to occasion my criticism of them.\n\nBest regards\n\nMichael\n\nFrom: Chris Franks\n\nSent: Monday, 18 November 2013, 12:33pm\n\nTo: Michael Haggett\n\nSubject: Complaint\n\nDear Michael\n\nFurther to the email postponing the hearing I now inform you that the meeting will be held on Wednesday 27 November at 6.00 pm which will be held at Ty Gwynfor, Cardiff.\n\nBest Wishes\n\nChris\n\nFrom: Michael Haggett\n\nSent: Friday, 22 November 2013, 6:57pm\n\nTo: Dafydd Trystan\n\nCc: Rhuanedd Richards, Shaughan Feakes, Leanne Wood, Chris Franks, Elin Jones\n\nSubject: Re: Complaint\n\nDear Dafydd\n\nI must once again remind you that I have not received answers to my outstanding questions. No matter how tightly you shut your eyes to them, they will not go away.\n\nIn your email of 24 October you acknowledged that it was unreasonable for Chris to act in the way he has done regarding my complaints against Rhun, Elfyn, Bob and Dafydd, and on the 29 October you said you were assured that a timetable for evaluating and investigating them was being drawn up. It is now clear that you were rather too easily assured. If you were foolish enough to leave responsibility for this in Chris's hands, he has not taken a blind bit of notice of you, just as he has not taken a blind bit of notice of standing orders in dealing with me.\n\nLike a toy robot, he will keep pressing blindly forwards until someone in Plaid Cymru has enough sense to realize the damage he is doing to the party, and enough decisiveness to stop him while there is still some slight hope that the damage can be repaired.\n\n-\n\nI will simply repeat that you cannot move to an investigation unless you set out a timetable for it and inform all parties of what it is (Clause 4.3) and that any investigation must make enquires of all parties (Clause 4.2). Until a proper investigation has been conducted the Hearing Panel cannot resolve whether or not there is a case for me to answer (Clause 4.4). If they were then to decide that there was a case for me to answer, I would need to be informed of what that case was before I could answer it at a formal hearing.\n\nAs I said before, if the party is determined to proceed with disciplinary action against me, it must go back and do things properly.\n\n-\n\nIt would, though, be a shame to let the meeting arranged for 27 November go to waste. So I would suggest that other members of the MDSP are included and that the meeting be used to evaluate my complaints against Rhun, Elfyn, Bob and Dafydd, and to set up investigations by an external investigator for my complaints against them and for Elin's complaint against me. This will require them to have been given copies of all my correspondence with Chris and yourself beforehand (in electronic form, so that the links in it can be followed) as they cannot make an informed decision without it. There is too much information for them to be expected to go through it all in just a couple of hours at one meeting, and Chris has admitted that he has until now kept them completely in the dark about what I have had to say.\n\nHowever if the MDSP does not set out a timetable before or at that meeting—and bearing in mind that the party has now allowed more than two months of continual evasion to elapse without doing a thing about it—there will be no alternative but to conclude that the party never had the slightest intention of dealing with these complaints in a fair and even-handed way. The two-faced hypocrisy of trying to stitch me up by blatantly ignoring every rule in the book, while at the same time refusing to even consider whether Rhun was or was not telling the truth, will be plain for all to see.\n\nBest regards\n\nMichael\n\nFrom: Dafydd Trystan\n\nSent: Saturday, 23 November 2013, 8:37am\n\nTo: Michael Haggett\n\nCc: Rhuanedd Richards, Shaughan Feakes, Leanne Wood, Chris Franks, Elin Jones\n\nSubject: Re: Complaint\n\nDear Michael\n\nThank you for your latest Email.\n\nMay I refer you to my previous Email, where I was clear that I have considered all of the matters you have drawn to my attention and sought assurances on two specific matters of process.\n\nI am pleased that on one of those matters, the timetable for your complaint, sufficient time has elapsed to allow you to prepare fully for your hearing.\n\nOn the complaint that you have lodged, as advised previously, I have sought assurances and been given assurances as to the timescale for dealing with the next steps with that complaint.\n\nYou raise one new matter in your Email - and that is the access of members of the panel to correspondence relating to the matter(s) at hand.

You declined to attend the hearing, despite being invited to do so. Due to Farida Aslam’s -----------------------------------------------, and the fact that the hearing had already been postponed twice, Fflur Jones, another committee member from the Membership, Disciplinary and Standards Committee had been briefed in Farida’s absence, and stood in for Farida on the panel.\n\nAs you will be aware, upon receipt of the Investigating Officer’s Report into the complaint against you, the Hearing panel had resolved that you had a case to answer, and a formal hearing therefore convened. The manner in which the hearing was conducted, despite your absence, was in keeping with clause 4.6 of the Standing Orders, a copy of which you are already in receipt.\n\nThe panel considered the considerable investigation report compiled by Shaughan Feakes, the Investigating Officer. Having considered all the evidence available, the panel decided that it could not dismiss the complaint against you, but rather that the complaint against you should be upheld. Due also to the seriousness of the complaint against you, it was also decided that sanctions should be imposed upon you in keeping with clause 5.1 of the Standing Orders.\n\nIt was the decision of the panel that the sanctions to be imposed upon you are as follows:\n\n1. That you are given a Formal written warning, which will remain live for a period of 12 months from the date of this letter.\n\n2. That if any further complaints are raised against you during that period of 12 months, and those complaints are eventually upheld by a panel of the Membership, Disciplinary and Standards Committee, the result will be your immediate expulsion from the Party.\n\nThe reasons why the Panel reached this decision are as follows:\n\nHaving considered the length and breadth of the complaints against you, particularly the choice of language you used in your criticisms of Rhun ap Iorwerth, it is the panel’s decision that your actions were damaging, or potentially damaging to the public reputation of the Party, in keeping with ground 3.1iii of the Standing Orders. Whilst the Panel appreciates, and indeed welcomes open debate concerning Plaid Cymru’s policies, and our politicians’ reliance or commentary upon them, it cannot condone blogs being written which uses language such as “We do not need dishonest politicians like Rhun ap Iorwerth”….. “He is a cuckoo who has duped his way into our nest”….. “he is misleading people on this issue by telling blatant lies” …. “If Rhun ap Iorwerth is elected, it would be a tragedy for Plaid Cymru”….\n\nSuch comments are biased, unprofessional and personally vindictive, and do not contribute anything to a proper and mature political debate regarding whether a Plaid Cymru prospective politician had upheld, or strayed away from Plaid Cymru’s official policy on nuclear power. Whilst your blogs did not ultimately manage to damage the result in the Anglesey by-election, it nevertheless gave scope for Labour and other political parties to try and switch the focus onto criticism from within Plaid Cymru of Rhun ap Iorwerth, which in turn generated negative articles being published in the Western Mail, and in Labour party tweets. Even in blogs hosted by Cai Larsen, called the Menai blogs, which were generally supportive of Rhun ap Iorwerth, comments such as “But the issue I’d like to focus on is this – there’s little we can learn from Labour, but discipline is an exception. They have their arguments in a room and they pull together in public. Some of us have a great deal to learn from that” were made. This demonstrates that your unwise decision to blog in such a personally vindictive manner about Rhun ap Iorwerth caused even our supporters to despair at a perceived lack of discipline within Plaid Cymru. Indeed, it is the panel’s view that had it not been for the extremely positive and talented campaign run by Rhun ap Iorwerth, your negative comments could have had a much more adverse effect on our performance in the by-election. For all these reasons therefore, we consider that your blogs did have a potentially damaging effect on the public reputation of Plaid Cymru.\n\nElin Jones AM will therefore be informed that her complaints against you have been upheld. You have the right to appeal against this decision, in keeping with section 6 of the Standing Orders. If you wish to appeal, then please do so within seven days of the date of this letter.\n\nYours sincerely\n\nChris Franks\n\nChair\n\nMembership, Disciplinary and Standard Hearing Panel\n\nFrom: Michael Haggett\n\nSent: Wednesday, 11 December 2013, 5:17pm\n\nTo: Rhuanedd Richards\n\nCc: Leanne Wood\n\nSubject: Appeal and other matters\n\nDear Rhuanedd\n\nI have received an email from Chris Franks dated 5 December which is included with the complete chain of previous correspondence below.\n\nIt is perfectly clear that standing orders have not been adhered to and that the decision of the Hearing Panel is therefore invalid. I need only repeat what I said before in my email of 22 November:\n\nYou cannot move to an investigation unless you set out a timetable for it and inform all parties of what it is (Clause 4.3) and that any investigation must make enquires of all parties (Clause 4.2). Until a proper investigation has been conducted the Hearing Panel cannot resolve whether or not there is a case for me to answer (Clause 4.4). If they were then to decide that there was a case for me to answer, I would need to be informed of what that case was before I could answer it at a formal hearing.\n\nBecause of this I am registering an appeal to you as Chief Executive of the party (Clause 6.7) on the grounds that the procedure adopted by the Hearing Panel was flawed and therefore unjust (Clause 6.3i).\n\n-\n\nIt is also true that the verdict and conclusions of the Hearing Panel as set out in the letter of 5 December demonstrate that they are based on factual inaccuracies (clause 6.3ii).\n\nThe most blatant factual inaccuracy is that the report produced by Shaughan Feakes states that I had not responded to his \"several requests to speak with him\". I would repeat what I said in my email of 28 October:\n\nIt is bizarre that a so-called investigation has taken place in which I was not asked a single question. Page 1 of the report contains the extraordinary statement that, \"Michael Haggett has not responded to my several requests to speak with him.\" I have not received any such request.\n\nChris told me on 9 September that Shaughan would contact me, and said the same again on 16 September. In my reply of 16 September I specifically noted that he had not yet done so, but that I would be happy to answer any questions he cared to send me. In my email of 24 September I repeated that Shaughan had not been in contact with me.\n\nThe question that must now be asked is why what I said, more than once, was deliberately ignored. The result is an investigation that was fundamentally flawed because no-one asked me any questions, despite the clear obligation set out in clause 4.2 for it to make enquiries of all parties. Clause 4.3 requires that a timetable for the investigation be determined at the outset, and for all parties to be informed of what it is. I repeatedly asked Chris to provide this information, but he refused to do so.\n\nI should add that in the email of 16 September, Chris said that Shaughan would \"contact me to go into the detail of the complaint\", and it would have been frankly impossible for him to have given me the detail of the complaint without sending me an email. In total, Shaughan received 25 emails from me, yet did not contact me at all.\n\nIt is clear from the email of 19 October that this so-called report was a factor in the decision to hold a formal hearing, and from the email of 5 December that it was relied on as \"considerable\".\n\nBut as well as this, the so-called report includes several inaccuracies based on incomplete or deliberately selective investigation, because it did not consider or present the evidence that I would have given him or pointed him to in response to the enquiries he should have made of me.\n\nAs a second and separate matter, it is now appropriate for me to note specific wrongdoing from several individuals that have been involved in the process.\n\nChris Franks\n\nChris has proceeded with this matter in an unacceptable manner from the very beginning. He has fundamentally misunderstood the new nature of the disciplinary procedure. He has not taken any notice of standing orders even when his failure to follow them had been pointed out to him, and he has been defensive and evasive when questioned. Many of my questions still remain unanswered.\n\nAt first sight, these failures appeared to have been due to incompetence or, perhaps, being under so much pressure that he did not have time to deal with this matter with due diligence. However he went on to do things that simply cannot be excused by incompetence or lack of time. In particular he presented Shaughan's report to the Hearing Panel knowing full well that it contained blatantly untrue statements, and at the same time refused to provide them with copies of my correspondence with him, which would have clearly exposed this untruthfulness. The two other members of the Hearing Panel were therefore deprived of sufficient evidence to reach a proper conclusion about whether to proceed to a formal hearing. This is a double-dose of blatant wrongdoing on his part, and is much more serious than Chris merely being incompetent and evasive. He is clearly unfit to be Chair of the MDSP because he has refused to act in a fair and even-handed manner.\n\nIt is still not clear whether the Hearing Panel was presented with this correspondence at or before the meeting of 3 December. The email of 5 December is deliberately ambiguous, cryptically referring only to \"all the evidence available\" without specifying what it was. However because the email of 5 December does not attempt to address or answer any of the points I raised, it seems obvious that they weren't considered. Any procedure that refuses to consider or answer the points I have made is clearly unjust.\n\nThroughout this process I have made a series of perfectly reasonable requests which, if followed, might have resulted in this matter being concluded in a fair and even-handed way in accordance with the rules set out in standing orders. But they were unreasonably denied. Yet Chris's blind rush to stitch me up by abusing the processes set out in standing orders in order to reach a pre-determined conclusion has backfired ... for he has now disqualified himself, along with the remainder of the Hearing Panel, from taking any further part in this matter.\n\nShaughan Feakes\n\nShaughan conducted his so-called investigation without contacting me or asking me a single question, in direct contravention of Clause 4.2. This was despite him being copied in on all correspondence, in which I specifically noted on more than one occasion that I was still waiting to hear from him. He was also instructed to contact me to \"go into the detail of the complaint\", but did not do so. I was kept entirely in the dark about the complaint, only receiving a copy of it five weeks after his so-called investigation had been completed and the report written.\n\nBy attaching his name to this joke of a document, he must bear personal responsibility for it and fully deserves to be reprimanded. However I would not want to be overly critical of his behaviour. As someone who works in Ty Gwynfor, he was severely compromised and probably put into an impossible position, and it is only fair that these mitigating circumstances are taken into account.\n\nNevertheless, the end result is that Plaid Cymru staff resources have been improperly used to prepare and present evidence in favour of one member of the party, while deliberately and completely ignoring the right of another member of the party to receive the same consideration. I had every right to expect that an equivalent amount of time and effort should have been given"
