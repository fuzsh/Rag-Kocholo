        "text": "PLAID Cymru is searching for a new home – and has put its Cardiff HQ up for sale.\n\nParty executives say Ty Gwynfor in Park Grove – named after the party’s iconic first MP Gwynfor Evans – is no longer considered appropriate.\n\nIt is looking for a replacement in the Cardiff area – either in the Bay or elsewhere in the city with good public transport links to the National Assembly.\n\nIf the party sells its headquarters – it would like to be in a new home at the start of next year.\n\nChief executive Dafydd Trystan said: “We are looking to buy more appropriate headquarters. Ty Gwynfor is a bit like a rabbit warren and there is no appropriate disabled access.\n\n“The party is seeking to become the largest party in Wales by 2001 and the building is not really fit for purpose as a national office.”\n\nMr Trystan added: “We are looking for premises in the Cardiff area such as Ocean Park or Atlantic Wharf, or even slightly further afield, where there are good transport links.\n\n“Accommodation close to the Assembly is relatively expensive and we don’t have an inexhaustible pot of money.\n\n“We’d like to be in place by the start of 2008 so we are established by the time of next year’s council elections. But I can assure members that wherever we go the name Ty Gwynfor as the name of the headquarters will remain.”\n\nPlaid is the main opposition party in the National Assembly with 15 of the 60 seats.\n\nphillip.nifield@wme.co.uk"
