        "meta_description": "The narrow win after two recounts of Plaid Cymru’s Ben Lake in the Ceredigion constituency at the June 8th General Election could be seen as heralding a new dawn in the fortunes of the Party of Wales. Ceredigion itself stood out in the UK as the most pro-EU region in the country in a poll taken before the EU referendum, a trait that was borne out by the county’s 54.63% vote for Remain. This is therefore a part of the world that is something of a paradox: this extremely rural constituency – some of the least densely-populated parts of the UK are to be found within its boundaries – melds together a variety of co-existing communities: old and new, tourist-orientated coast and agricultural hinterland, low-wage labourers and high-earning university staff. It is home to some of the strongest Welsh-speaking areas in Wales whilst witnessing an exodus of its young people and in-migration from beyond its borders. The present paper will seek to examine what the Ceredigion result may indicate by focusing on the question of the youth vote and the possible spearheading of a change in Plaid tactics regarding the question of independence for Wales, a position that has rarely found any support among core Plaid voters in rural Welsh-speaking Wales. We will also seek to zoom in on the ‘Arfor’ plan, a Plaid-backed vision of new regional governance for the West of Wales, in which language planning and economic development go hand in hand. Could this new polity stave off the worst effects of Brexit in Ceredigion and enable the county to put an end to “this steady, silent haemorrhage” that “saps the life of nearly every town and village the length and breadth of the county”, as reflected in the words of Ben Lake’s maiden speech in Westminster?",

        "text": "Introduction\n\n2A little further south to the area where Theresa May came to her momentous decision lies the equally rural county of Ceredigion where a battle was to be fought during the 2017 General Election in which the victorious party, Plaid Cymru, would have to demonstrate the same clear-headedness and self-assured thinking displayed by PM May in her decision to go for an early election. The present paper will therefore seek to show how the result in the Ceredigion constituency might herald a new dawn in the way Plaid Cymru seeks to position itself in the post-Brexit Wales, especially in terms of the youth vote and on the question of a potential push for Welsh independence.\n\nCeredigion: a brief overview\n\nCeredigion’s political history\n\n8The mid-nineteenth century saw a series of elections besmirched by vote-rigging and tenant evictions, all of which culminated in 1869 with a Commons select committee inquiry into alleged election malpractice in Cardiganshire. The allegations were laid against Tory landlords, who had the nasty habit of evicting Liberal-voting farm tenants. When Gladstone’s Liberal government of 1872 brought in the secret ballot, this largely put an end to such behaviour. Not long after, in 1874, Thomas Edward Lloyd of Coedmor was the last Tory landowner to represent the county.\n\n10In the modern era, the first jarring interruption in the cosy succession of Liberal MPs to represent the constituency came in 1966, that year of other breakthroughs in Wales with the election of Gwynfor Evans, the first ever Plaid MP, elected in the Carmarthenshire by-election. In the 1966 Cardiganshire constituency a young and ambitious Welsh-speaking solicitor named Elystan Morgan became the Labour candidate and unseated the Liberal incumbent Roderick Bowen, who had represented the county since the post-war election of 1945. Morgan was in fact a defector from Plaid Cymru; in the 1964 general election he had unsuccessfully fought as a Plaid candidate in the neighbouring constituency of Meirionydd. A native of Bow Street, in the north of the county, Morgan was a local boy made good. He went on to hold the seat for Labour in the 1970 election when Heath was elected.\n\n11The Liberals soon fought back in the February election of 1974, with the election of a candidate embodying most completely the make-up of the constituency’s electorate. Geraint Howells was a Welsh-speaking local farmer, embedded in the cultural and social life of the county. Howells and Elystan Morgan were culturally cut from the same cloth; both were from north Cardiganshire farming families, both were prominent members of their non-conformist chapels, so there was very little to distinguish them apart from more societal questions in which the Labour Party in Wales held diametrically opposing views to those of Plaid Cymru. A question of this order reared its head in the matter of the setting up of a Welsh-medium comprehensive school to cover the catchment area of Aberystwyth. Howells was a firm supporter of Ysgol Gyfun Penweddig, the bilingual comprehensive set up in 1973. The battle for the opening of such a school had left its mark on the Welsh-speaking population of north Cardiganshire, which could in effect explain the more than 10% swing in the vote from Labour to the Liberals. Howells went on to hold the seat in 1979, 1983 and 1987.\n\n12Another shake-up came in 1992. Suffering from a bad knee that made it difficult for him to cover the hustings in what was now a huge constituency – Cardiganshire had become Ceredigion and Pembroke North in the redrawing of boundaries in 1983 – Geraint Howells lost his seat by 3,000 votes to Cynog Dafis, his Plaid opponent who had come fourth in the previous election. Dafis and Plaid had entered into a strategic alliance with the Green Party, yet this cannot fully explain the Plaid victory since the Greens only polled just over 800 votes in the 1987 election. It could possibly be put down to the seeds of the 1970s environmentalist movements that were so prevalent in the mid Wales of the times and which were beginning to bear fruit some twenty years later. The politically explosive and divisive question of the Welsh language was also perhaps being looked at in a new light. It was more than twelve years since the Tories had come to power in Westminster and Margaret Thatcher had wreaked havoc in Welsh communities the length and breadth of the country. Voters were slowly coming to the conclusion that there had to be a change in the way things had always been done.\n\n13Cynog Dafis held onto his seat in 1997, with a majority of 7,000 over Labour. In 1999 Dafis also became an Assembly Member in the newly-established National Assembly for Wales through the regional list vote, but he soon found that both jobs were too demanding. He resigned his Westminster seat in 2000, triggering a by-election that was successfully won by Plaid’s Simon Thomas, who went on to hold the seat in the 2001 election.\n\nThe 2017 General Election in Ceredigion\n\n16If Plaid had been looking to select a candidate that would in some way prove to be a greater attraction to younger voters than whatever candidate the Labour Party would field, then the choice of Ben Morgan Lake turned out to be a stroke of genius. Plaid was forced to recognize that after the disappointment of the EU Referendum result that Welsh youngsters undoubtedly felt, many would be tempted by the tantalizing appeal that a Jeremy Corbyn-led Labour Party seemed to offer. The Party of Wales would therefore have to pull out all the stops to find a candidate that could appeal to the core youth vote in Ceredigion – students in Aberystwyth or Lampeter universities could elect to cast their vote in the constituency if they chose – whilst drawing sufficient numbers of traditional rural Welsh Plaid voters. It was always going to be a race to beat Labour; after all, Plaid had already targeted the seat in the 2015 election as winnable and, had it not been for the debacle around Mike Parker, they would have gained it back from Mark Williams, whose majority had been greatly reduced. Yet, when Ben Lake was selected, nobody could have predicted the final surge in Corbyn’s campaign, not least among young voters.\n\n17Ben Morgan Lake was born in 1993 and brought up in a Welsh-speaking family. He attended Lampeter Comprehensive School and went on to graduate from Trinity College Oxford with a degree in History and Politics, later completing a Master’s in Modern British and European History. He worked as a research officer for Elin Jones, Ceredigion AM and current Presiding Officer, at the Welsh Assembly. He has stated that he sees himself in the legacy of his predecessors:\n\n19 Walesonline, June 9, 2017. https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics/who-ben-lake-plaid-cymrus-13 (...)\n\nI am a new name in Ceredigion politics but I hope to belong to a long tradition of Ceredigion MPs who made their mark on Westminster politics – from Elystan Morgan to the late Geraint Howells, and of course Cynog Dafis. More than ever, Westminster needs to hear Ceredigion’s voice.\n\n18Yet again, the campaign was acrimonious. Accusations of skulduggery and slandering from the LibDems were bandied about by Plaid, and were possibly even embarrassing to the LibDem incumbent himself, Mark Williams, who had found himself lumbered with a young and inexperienced campaign manager that the LibDem central office had sent up to Ceredigion and who possibly underestimated the damage done to Williams’ credibility through attacking Plaid on its so-called acceptance of Brexit. However, media pundits right up to the very day of the election had not suspected a Plaid victory.\n\n19Late into the early hours of the morning of June 9th and after two recounts, Ben Lake was declared the winner, a mere 104-vote difference between him and Williams. It was a historical result: for the first time since 1859, no constituency in Wales would be sending a Liberal MP to Parliament. The results were as shown below:\n\nCandidate\n\nParty\n\nNumber of votes\n\nShare of votes\n\nDAVIES, Ruth, Rosamund\n\nConservative\n\n7,307\n\n18.37%\n\nHAM, Grenville Morgan\n\nGreens\n\n542\n\n1.36%\n\nHARRISON, Tom\n\nUKIP\n\n602\n\n1.51%\n\nLAKE, Ben Morgan\n\nPlaid Cymru\n\n11,623\n\n29.23%\n\nMULHOLLAND Dinah\n\nLabour\n\n8,017\n\n20.16%\n\nSIR DUDLEY, the Crazed\n\nOfficial Monster Raving Loony Party\n\n157\n\n0.39%\n\nWILLIAMS, Mark\n\nLiberal Democrats\n\n11,519\n\n28.97%\n\nDid Brexit play a role in the Ceredigion General Election result?\n\n20In West Wales, the EU funded the equivalent of €1,078 per head in 2014, so for the most astute voters, the Remain vote should have been a given in the EU Referendum of 2016. The figure of 68% of Welsh exports going to the EU, especially in farming, was also known at the time, but this did not seem to prevent some rural areas of Wales, heavily-dependent on agriculture, from voting to leave the EU. Ceredigion seemed to buck the trend that other parts of rural, agricultural Wales demonstrated in the Brexit vote.\n\nThe five factors that impacted the EU Referendum vote in Wales and their importance in the 2017 General Election in Ceredigion\n\n24Welsh researchers since the EU Referendum of June 2016 have highlighted five factors that could have influenced the EU Referendum result which we shall discuss here in relation to their impact on the Ceredigion 2017 General Election result. The five factors listed as having in some way contributed to the Welsh EU Referendum result were (1) Labour hegemony (2) English in-migration (3) EU funding (4) the democratic deficit in Wales, resulting in an alienated, impoverished, angry population (5) the lack of Welsh media leading to an information deficit\n\n25In the 2017 General Election in Ceredigion, Labour performed well, mirroring Jeremy Corbyn’s UK-wide result, especially among the youth vote. There was also a tactical vote that was discernible in the highly Remain-voting areas of Wales – and Ceredigion was a perfect example of this – consisting in choosing to vote Labour over one’s choice of party in the 2015 General Election, if only in the hope of stopping Brexit. In terms of the Ceredigion result, there is no doubt that this tactic played heavily on both Ben Lake’s and – to a lesser extent – on Mark Williams’s traditional electors as the following table of vote flows might suggest:\n\n27The Remain voter vote flows are particularly instructive regarding the Plaid Cymru vote since the more left-leaning Plaid under Leanne Wood has possibly legitimized the socialist/left-wing narrative for Plaid-voting Welsh-speakers to the extent that they can now contemplate voting Labour in constituencies such as Ceredigion when tactical voting is called for. Plaid also loses out when the overall vote flows by party are examined in Wales in the figure below:\n\n28Vote flows by party, Wales General Elections 2015-17 (source: BES Research)\n\n29Only UKIP suffers a greater migration of its voters from 2015 to 2017. Both The Green Party and Plaid Cymru, who were once in an alliance in Ceredigion, found that many of their 2015 electors migrated over to Labour in the 2017 General Election. When commentators hail the resistance of Labour in Wales in the 2017 election, shifts in voting patterns as shown in the above figures should not be underestimated. For Plaid there are lessons to be learnt and a necessary future repositioning of the party in anticipation of the Labour Party persisting in its left-leaning agenda, even though this is not so much the case with the Labour Party in Wales.\n\n30On the question of English in-migration, in Ceredigion the phenomenon is probably more significant in relation to the Remain vote as the highly-skilled intellectual workers of the universities and various research centres in the county could possibly have contributed to Ben Lake’s victory. English in-migration elsewhere in Wales, especially the migration of English retired people to the North Wales coastal areas such as Conwy and Clwyd West, probably fed into the EU Referendum Leave vote and acted as a bulwark for the Conservative votes there, despite significant increases in the votes for Labour candidates in those constituencies.\n\n33Finally, the matter of an information deficit due to a lack of uniquely Welsh media is perhaps less pronounced in Ceredigion, especially once again among Welsh-speakers, who are able to access a tradition of community newspapers – papurau bro – offering a different perception of daily life and news. Some of these papers include occasional forays into more national or even international topics worthy of discussion. However, Plaid Cymru in particular cannot rely on the pool of Welsh language activists/speakers to bolster its electorate in the future, especially if the party decides to put the question of Welsh independence on the agenda in the wake of a disastrous Brexit for Wales.\n\nThe youth vote\n\nA push for independence?\n\n35So, what next for Wales? And what next for Plaid Cymru? Could Ben Lake epitomize the new breed of MPs that are going to be necessary if Wales is to be lifted from its position of poor woman of the UK and Europe?\n\n37Perhaps Plaid Cymru are aware of the need to focus on the youth of Wales since a Plaid Ifanc (Young Plaid) was set up in September 2017. In its constitution document, it sets out a clear mission statement:\n\n31 Our Constitution on http://www.plaidifanc.org/en/who-are-we/ Consulted on September 12, 2017.\n\nPlaid Ifanc’s core aim is the establishment of an independent Welsh Republic with a seat in the General Assembly of the United Nations and a full member of a socially just and politically united European Union. As well as being an organization committed to the self-determination of all peoples, it is committed to achieving social justice, defending human rights and the safeguarding of the environment.\n\n40Critics have been quick to refer to it as a kind of Welsh Gaeltacht. Its proponents point out the common factors among the four counties that could make up Arfor, giving purpose to such a regional authority, among which are highlighted the high percentage of Welsh speakers, an inflow of older people coupled with an outflow of young people, rural dependence on agriculture, food and tourism, a preponderance of market towns and university towns, a high percentage of public sector jobs and some of the lowest wages in Britain, and among the lowest wages in Europe.\n\n41Arfor’s remit over time could include: proposing a growth deal for the West of Wales to the UK Government; creating a strategic development plan for the Welsh West; creating a community bank for the region; creating a comprehensive language scheme across the region and across the public sector within the region; using a model of a combined authority and elected Mayors as possibilities for debates on governance.\n\n42The more astute observers will have spotted that the region put forward for Arfor just so happens to be controlled by Plaid local councils and represented in Westminster by Plaid MPs. Unfortunately, there is probably little appetite, even within core Plaid supporters, in particular in South Wales, for a scheme that seems to suggest that the party is retreating into a linguistic hinterland, one that alienates almost 90% of the population of Wales.\n\n43Moreover, given the way the Brexit negotiations have progressed – or not progressed -between the UK government and the devolved nations, the very idea of devolution could be under threat after Brexit. Strategically, this is not the time for Plaid to be splitting its electorate along age-old linguistic lines that have never proved fertile in the past.\n\nConclusion\n\n44This paper set out to determine whether the 2017 General Election in Ceredigion in which Ben Lake gained the seat from the LibDem incumbent could in some way be seen as the beginning of a change in direction for Plaid Cymru. As the fallout from the EU Referendum settles and Brexit draws inexorably closer, Plaid Cymru finds itself at a crossroads. It is patently clear that the party was not able to cash in on its move to the left under Leanne Wood in the 2017 General Election; if this had been the case the party would have successfully wooed voters in the South Wales Valleys and posed a greater threat to Welsh Labour, neither of which it succeeded in doing."
