        "text": "Local government of Cardiff, Wales\n\nFor the district authority from 1974–1996, see Cardiff City Council. For the local authority prior to 1974, see Cardiff County Borough Council.\n\nCardiff Council, formally the County Council of the City and County of Cardiff (Welsh: Cyngor Sir Dinas a Sir Caerdydd)[3] is the governing body for Cardiff, one of the principal areas of Wales. The principal area and its council were established in 1996 to replace the previous Cardiff City Council which had been a lower-tier authority within South Glamorgan. Cardiff Council consists of 79 councillors, representing 28 electoral wards.\n\nLabour has held a majority of the seats on the council since 2012. The last election was in May 2022 and the next election is due in 2027.\n\nHistory\n\nMunicipal life in Cardiff dates back to the 12th century, when Cardiff was granted borough status by the Earls of Gloucester. The offices of the mayor, aldermen, and common councillors developed during the Middle Ages. When elected county councils were established in 1889 under the Local Government Act 1888, Cardiff was considered large enough to run its own services and so it became a county borough, independent from Glamorgan County Council.[4] The town of Cardiff was still considered the county town of Glamorgan, with Glamorgan County Council building its headquarters there. Cardiff was one of only two county boroughs in Wales created in 1889, the other being Swansea. (Newport was later elevated to county borough status in 1891, followed by Merthyr Tydfil in 1908.)[5] In 1905, Cardiff became a city, and thereafter Cardiff County Borough Council was allowed to call itself Cardiff City Council.\n\nIn 1974 local government across Wales and England was restructured into a two-tier system under the Local Government Act 1972. Cardiff became a lower-tier district council, called Cardiff City Council, within the new county of South Glamorgan. The South Glamorgan County Council provided county-level services in the area.[6]\n\nFurther local government restructuring in 1996 under the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994 saw the city of Cardiff become a unitary authority: the present Cardiff Council. South Glamorgan County Council was abolished. Ahead of the reforms the county council had campaigned for a new \"Greater Cardiff\" authority to reflect the boundaries of South Glamorgan, but the Conservative government of the time decided to keep the Vale of Glamorgan (which covered a marginal Conservative parliamentary seat) separate from Cardiff.[7]\n\nThe 1994 Act directed that the new council should be called \"Cardiff County Council\".[8] The council's constitution calls it instead the \"County Council of the City and County of Cardiff\". For most purposes the council styles itself \"Cardiff Council\", except where the full legal name is required, when it uses the form from its constitution.[9]\n\nPolitical control\n\nThe first election to the reconstituted council was held in 1995, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until it came into its powers on 1 April 1996. Political control of the council since 1996 has been held by the following parties:[10]\n\nParty in control Years Labour 1996–2004 No overall control 2004–2012 Labour 2012–present\n\nLeadership\n\nThe role of Lord Mayor of Cardiff is largely ceremonial. Political leadership is provided instead by the leader of the council, although the two roles were temporarily combined between 1999 and 2003. The first leader following the 1996 reforms was Russell Goodway, who had been the last leader of South Glamorgan County Council. The leaders of Cardiff Council since 1996 have been:[11]\n\nCouncillor Party From To Russell Goodway Labour 1 April 1996 1 Jul 2004 Rodney Berman Liberal Democrats 1 Jul 2004 6 May 2012 Heather Joyce Labour 17 May 2012 27 Mar 2014 Phil Bale Labour 27 Mar 2014 25 May 2017 Huw Thomas Labour 25 May 2017\n\nAt the age of 31, Huw Thomas became Wales' youngest council leader when he was elected in May 2017.[12]\n\nComposition\n\nFollowing the 2022 election and subsequent changes of allegiance up to July 2024, the composition of the council was:[13]\n\nParty Councillors Labour 55 Conservative 9 Liberal Democrats 10 Common Ground 2 Independent 2 Propel 1 Total 79\n\nCommon Ground is an alliance of Plaid Cymru and the Greens, with its candidates standing for both parties as \"Plaid Cymru, Green Party, Common Ground\". The next election is due in 2027.\n\nElections\n\nSince 2012, Cardiff Council elections have taken place every five years.\n\nThe council was run by a Labour majority administration between 1995 and 2004. The Liberal Democrats ran a minority administration from 2004, in coalition with Plaid Cymru.[14]\n\nFollowing the 2008 local elections in Cardiff there was still no party with an overall majority. The Lib Dems increased their total number of councillors to 35, forming an administration with Plaid Cymru, with Rodney Berman as leader of the Council. The Conservatives replaced Labour as the official opposition. Labour suffered badly, losing 14 councillors. Plaid Cymru gained four councillors. Three independent councillors were elected; two former Conservatives who had left the group in 2006 being joined by an additional member.\n\nIn 2012, the Labour Party took overall control of the council, and remained in overall control following the 2017 and 2022 elections.\n\nYear Seats Labour Liberal Democrats Conservative Plaid Cymru Independent / Other Notes 1995 72 61 9 1 1 0 Labour majority controlled 1999 75 50 18 5 1 1 Labour majority controlled 2004 75 27 33 12 3 0 Lib Dem minority 2008 75 13 35 17 7 3 Lib Dem / Plaid Cymru coalition 2012 75 46 16 7 2 4 Labour majority controlled 2017 75 40 11 20 3 1 Labour majority controlled 2022 79 55 10 11 2[a] 1[b] Labour majority controlled\n\nParty with the most elected councillors in bold. Coalition agreements in notes column.\n\nPremises\n\nThe council's main offices are at County Hall on Atlantic Wharf.[15] It was built in 1987 as the headquarters of the former South Glamorgan County Council. The council also uses the City Hall on Cathays Park in the city centre, built in 1906 for the former Cardiff City Council. Full council meetings were held at County Hall prior to 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic required meetings to be held virtually. From the resumption of in-person meetings in May 2022, full council meetings were held at City Hall.[16] City Hall closed for refurbishment in 2023 but is planned to be brought back into use as the council's meeting place once the work is complete, although this may not be until 2026.[17]\n\nElectoral wards\n\nSince the 2022 elections, the unitary authority area has been divided into 28 electoral wards. Many of these wards are coterminous with communities of the same name.[18] The following table lists council wards, communities and associated geographical areas. Communities with a community council are indicated with an asterisk.\n\nWard Communities Other geographic areas 1 Adamsdown Adamsdown 2 Butetown Butetown Atlantic Wharf, Cardiff Bay, Cardiff city centre (part), Tiger Bay, Flatholm 3 Caerau Caerau Culverhouse Cross 4 Canton Canton Leckwith, Victoria Park 5 Cathays Cathays and Castle Blackweir, Cardiff city centre (Castle), Cathays, Cathays Park, Maindy 6 Cyncoed Cyncoed Roath Park, Lakeside 7 Ely Ely Culverhouse Cross, Michaelston-super-Ely 8 Fairwater Fairwater Pentrebane 9 Gabalfa Gabalfa Mynachdy, Maindy, Heath 10 Grangetown Grangetown Cardiff Bay (part), Saltmead, International Sports Village 11 Heath Heath Birchgrove 12 Lisvane and Thornhill Lisvane* and Thornhill Cefn Onn 13 Llandaff Llandaff Danescourt 14 Llandaff North Llandaff North Hailey Park, Lydstep Park, Mynachdy, Gabalfa 15 Llanishen Llanishen 16 Llanrumney Llanrumney 17 Pentwyn Pentwyn and Llanedeyrn (since 2016) 18 Pentyrch and\n\nSt Fagans Pentyrch* and St Fagans* Capel Llanilltern, Coedbychan, Creigiau, Gwaelod-y-Garth, Rhydlafar 19 Penylan Penylan 20 Plasnewydd Roath Cardiff city centre (part) 21 Pontprennau and\n\nOld St Mellons Old St. Mellons* and Pontprennau Llanedeyrn Village 22 Radyr Radyr & Morganstown* Morganstown, Radyr 23 Rhiwbina Rhiwbina Pantmawr, Rhydwaedlyd, Wenallt 24 Riverside Riverside and Pontcanna Part of Cardiff city centre, Llandaff Fields, Sophia Gardens 25 Rumney Rumney 26 Splott Splott and Tremorfa Pengam Green 27 Trowbridge Trowbridge St Mellons estate, Cefn Mably, Wentloog 28 Whitchurch & Tongwynlais Tongwynlais* and Whitchurch Blaengwynlais, Bwlch-y-cwm, Coedcefngarw, Coryton, Cwmnofydd, Graig-goch, Llandaff North\n\nArms\n\nCoat of arms of Cardiff Council\n\nCrest\n\nA Tudor rose on three ostrich feathers Argent issuing out of a mural crown Proper.
