        "text": "Labour, Reform UK emerge as big winners · Conservatives get poorest result ever\n\nThe overwhelming victory of the Labour Party and the rise of populist radical right Reform UK are the two main features of the elections to the House of Commons that took place on 4 July in the United Kingdom. Among the stateless nations’ parties, Plaid Cymru and Sinn Féin emerged stronger from the contest, while the Scottish National Party (SNP) suffered a drop to pre-referendum figures.\n\nSetback for SNP\n\nThe Scottish pro-independence SNP, immersed in an internal crisis, as well as one of reputation and project, has lost almost half of the votes obtained in 2019 (from 1.2 million to around 700,000), which, due to the uninominal majority system, means they lose 38 seats out of the 47 they won five years ago, with only a few seats still to be declared. From being the largest party in Scotland and third-largest in the UK, they are now second and fourth respectively.\n\nThe result is a blow to the SNP, which had stepped into the election saying that, if it won a majority of Scottish seats, this would give it the mandate to negotiate a second independence referendum with the UK government.\n\nPolls suggest independence support remains between 40% and 45% in Scotland. This indicates that a significant proportion of pro-independence voters have this time abandoned the SNP, which has fallen below 30% of preferences in Scotland.\n\nThe other pro-independence party, Alba, led by former first minister Alex Salmond, did not do well either: 12,000 votes and no seats.\n\nPlaid Cymru progresses\n\nScotland has voted for the Labour Party, as has—and by an even larger margin—Wales. However, here the pro-independence party, Plaid Cymru, has improved its results, growing by some 60,000 votes and two percentage points (from 10% to 12%) compared to the 2019 election and maintaining four seats. This was not a clear outcome, as one of the four constituencies it controlled disappeared. The left-wing sovereigntists compensated for this loss with victory in Ynys Môn, one of their main electoral targets.\n\nPlaid leader Rhun ap Iorwerth has said the party’s results are excellent and give him “confidence” ahead of the 2026 Welsh election. Plaid Cymru's manifesto calls for devolution of several powers and “fair funding” for Wales. Labour, which will have a free hand in this, has shown itself willing to negotiate some of these transfers and improve the country's funding.\n\nSinn Féin consolidates itself\n\nIrish republicans consolidated all seven seats they held in Northern Ireland, and increased their vote total from 180,000 to 210,000. With approximately 33% of the vote share north of the border, Sinn Féin strengthens itself as the largest party, a position it won in the last elections in Stormont and also in the local elections. It is the first time republicans have won these three elections in a row.\n\nThe other party that advocates Irish reunification, the SDLP, maintained its two seats, although it fell in vote percentage.\n\nThe Sinn Féin leadership hopes to use this new victory to increase pressure on the UK government to agree to negotiate a roadmap for a referendum on Irish unity. All UK governments have so far rejected such a possibility.\n\nWithin the unionist camp, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP, right-wing) has lost three of its previously held eight seats to the Traditionalist Ulster Voice (TUV, to the right of the DUP and opposed to the Good Friday Agreement), the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP, the former largest party in the unionist camp and more moderate than the DUP) and an independent Unionist candidate.\n\nMore of a success in seats than in vote share for Labour\n\nKeir Starmer is set to become the next UK prime minister after Labour—with a moderate programme—won 412 seats out of 650 in the UK as a whole. A historic victory that leaves the Conservative Party of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak with its poorest result in history, with 121 seats and an obvious threat: that the far-right camp, led by Nigel Farage, will either phagocytize it or drag it towards more right-wing positions. Farage’s party, Reform UK, won four seats and more than four million votes, just over 14% of the total. The Conservatives narrowly missed out on 20%. Farage, for the first time, will sit in the House of Commons.\n\nAlthough Labour's performance in seats is a big hit, it is less so if we look at vote share. Starmer’s party won less than 34%, about the same proportion as the two right-wing parties combined."
