        "text": "Pre-publication version of Martin Johnes, 'History and the making and remaking of Wales', History, 100 (2015), 667-84. History – in the sense of both the past itself and representations of that past – has been employed over the centuries to assert a Welsh identity. Indeed, by the early twentieth century, history was a defining constituent of national identity in Wales. This article explores how history continued to be used to promote Welsh identity after the Second World War, a practice that grew, particularly in education, as concerns over the future of traditional Welsh culture deepened. Yet popular understandings of the past were frequently fragmented and distorted, even as the depictions of the past put forward by academics and the heritage sector grew more nuanced. Consequently, as the post-1945 period continued, popular understandings of history began to undermine the development of the embryonic nation-state that was emerging in Wales.\n\nEach year the National Eisteddfod alternates between north and south Wales in a festival that consistently redefines itself and what it means to be and perform Welshness. As a publicly funded and organized national institution, the National Eisteddfod’s performances, competitions, and pavilions reflect aspects of Welsh memory and heritage through traditional poetry, dance, and music. Likewise, this space is central to the continuing evolution of Welsh memory and Welsh music. The work of memory, language, and music during the annual ten-day festival in 2018 experienced numerous structural changes from customary eisteddfodau. Through musicals, folk music, carnivals, and other performances, music and memory in Cardiff Bay intersected with transatlantic identities, protest, and the deindustrialized urban setting. Using interviews and a transoptic landscape analysis, this paper explores the musical, performative, and national land- scapes of the 2017 and 2018 National Eisteddfodau to better understand these emerging postcolo- nial, post-industrial, performative, and pluralized memories in Wales.\n\nHow are linear monuments perceived in the contemporary landscape and how do they operate as memoryscapes for today’s borderland communities? When considering Offa’s Dyke and Wat’s Dyke in today’s world, we must take into account the generations who have long lived in these monuments’ shadows and interacted with them. Even if perhaps only being dimly aware of their presence and stories, these are communities living ‘after Offa’. These monuments have been either neglected or ignored within heritage sites and museums with only a few notable exceptions (Evans and Williams 2019; Williams 2020), and have long been subject to confused and challenging conflations with both the modern Welsh/English border and, since the 1970s, with the Offa’s Dyke Path. Moreover, to date, no study has attempted to compile and evaluate the toponomastic (place-name) evidence pertaining to the monuments’ presences, and remembered former presences, in today’s landscape. Focusing on naming practices as memory work in the contemporary landscape, the article explores the names of houses, streets, parks, schools and businesses. It argues for the place-making role of toponomastic evidence, mediated in particular by the materiality of signs themselves. Material and textual citations to the monuments render them integral to local communities’ social memories and borderland identities, even where the dykes have been erased, damaged or obscured by development. Moreover, they have considerable potential future significance for engaging borderland communities in both dykes as part of the longer-term story of their historic environment.\n\nPopular interpretations of national identity often focus on the unifying qualities of nationhood. However, societies frequently draw hierarchical distinctions between the people and places who are ‘most national’, and those who are ‘least national’. Little attention is paid to these marginal places within the nation and the experiences of their inhabitants. This article helps to address this by analysing the ‘less Welsh’ British Wales region of Wales, a country which has traditionally possessed a hierarchical, regionally constituted nationhood. The article studies the British Wales region both ‘from above’- considering how some areas develop as ‘less national’- and ‘from below’, introducing empirical ethnographic work into ‘everyday Welshness’ in this area. Whilst previous work on hierarchical nationhood focuses on how hierarchies are institutionalized by the state, this article demonstrates how people at the margins of the nation actively negotiate their place in the nation. Whilst people in this area expressed a strong nationhood, they also struggled to place themselves in the nation because they had internalized their lowly place within the national hierarchy. The article demonstrates the importance of place and social class for national identity construction, and draws attention to the role of power in the discursive construction of hierarchical nationhood.\n\nThrough the auto-ethnographic lens of a learner of the Welsh language living in Gwynedd, a largely Welsh-speaking region of North West Wales, Fiona Bowie explores the phenomenon of Welsh identity, its fluidity and variety, and the contested and political nature of identification with Wales, its language and culture. The simple essentialism sometimes implied by terminology (to be or not to be 'Welsh' or a 'Welsh-speaker' for example) takes on particular nuances as one moves from the micro level of ethnographic observation to the wider national stage and political arena. The value of combining these perspectives becomes clear not just for Wales, but when examining any form of identity politics."
