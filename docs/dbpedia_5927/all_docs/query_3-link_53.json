        "text": "Smears won’t stop council doing its job\n\nI WRITE to refute the comments of Daniel Mohammed of Fairwater.\n\nIt was stated that I dismissed the issue of developers’ proposals of potential housing and that we have done little to engage residents. This is simply an untrue smear. The politics of the letter are clear, when he “begs” people to ignore a Plaid Cymru leaflet.\n\nI explained to Mr Mohammed at some length in person that as an executive councillor I am obliged not to give a view on this issue at the present time.\n\nIn terms of engagement, my Plaid colleagues have delivered 6,000 leaflets to all houses in our area, informing residents of what the issue is. How on earth can we be accused of not informing residents? Indeed, residents tell us that they have never been better informed.\n\nIn addition, the address given to residents in our leaflet is correct. Residents are asked to write to me as an executive councillor, not as a Plaid Cymru person.\n\nI have already fed many views into the consultation. Since I will be one of the people making a decision on this, it is clearly proper to write to me, unpalatable though that is to New Labour.\n\nI noted at our last PACT meeting in Fairwater, dealing with Fairwater and Pentrebane issues, that there were Labour members present from Canton and Llandaf.\n\nPerhaps they were there to hold the hands of the former Labour councillors who turned up for the first time in 15 months? The aunt of the writer also lives in Ely, but seems to be on a mission to act politically in Fairwater.\n\nFairwater’s new Plaid councillors are talking the talk and walking the walk. The closure of Birdie’s Lane is one example of this. No amount of smear will stop us doing our job for our community.\n\nCoun Neil McEvoy\n\nPlaid Cymru Fairwater\n\nHousing plan not council-led\n\nPRIVATE developers have suggested building a mixed development of 4,000 houses between Fairwater, Pentrebane and Radyr on open farmland.\n\nThis is proposed as an amendment to the Cardiff Local Development Plan currently undergoing public consultation.\n\nThis is not a council development. The council proposed that developments should take place within the existing built-up areas.\n\nPlaid Cymru encourages all residents to write to the council with their views on this proposal becoming part of the Local Development Plan.\n\nMy friend Coun Lisa Ford says she has lived in Fairwater almost all her life and does not want to be surrounded by houses.\n\nThe council has to undertake this formal legal process. The council executive will have to make the decision. Please write to Plaid’s deputy council leader Neil McEvoy at County Hall, Atlantic Wharf and express your view.\n\nNeil himself is not allowed to express a view until he has assessed all the options with other executive members.\n\nCoun Keith Parry\n\nPreswylfa Street, Cardiff\n\nCouncil’s green credentials\n\nCARDIFF council will have to work harder to convince us of their environmental credentials (“Cardiff is leading fight to go green”, August 18).\n\nIt might be the first local authority to offer doorstep food and garden waste recycling in Wales, but it certainly was not the first in the UK.\n\nIts fortnightly green bag “co-mingling” recycling is more expensive and less effective than sorting paper and cardboard from glass and metal on the doorstep; and its enthusiasm for plastic bags rather than bins is shared by the seagulls and rats but not many people.\n\nMy wish list for Cardiff Council includes:\n\nDoor-to-door contact with pensioners to ensure they take up the insulation grants they are entitled to.\n\nInstalling ground source heat pumps under school playing fields to generate their heat and light.\n\nSolar panels on all public buildings’ south-facing roofs.\n\nA transport policy to deter 48,000 people from commuting to Cardiff by car every day.\n\nRepair all the potholes to make the roads safe for pedestrians and cyclists instead of causing months of gridlock by installing granite slabs to connect Queen Street to the Castle.\n\nThen I might take the council’s “going green” claim seriously.\n\nJenny Rathbone\n\nLabour parliamentary candidate for Cardiff Central\n\nRuinous greed of politicians\n\nI AM a regular contributor to Viewpoints and I would really appreciate it if you would allow me to express an opinion.\n\nWhat the Tories are saying is unbelievable – they want a doubling of salary. I wouldn’t trust politicians as far as I could throw them, but it is inferred I do not understand market forces.\n\nLudicrous house price inflation is eating into salaries. Pensions are suffering. We only just survived a cataclysmic collapse of the banking system.\n\nI have just bought a Bosch strimmer and was very surprised to see it was made in China. We had mass unemployment under Thatcher, mass unemployment under New Labour.\n\nWhile Great Britain slides down the pan, China is killing thousands down the pits. While most of our pits are shut, China has a terrible record on pit safety.\n\nSome figures, supposedly inaccurate, say 91,172, were killed in 2008. Some say there were 413,700 accidents. Chinese workers are paying a terrible price to take our jobs.\n\nWe can’t even make wind turbines. There is no money, because our stupid Government is too busy propping up its mistakes.\n\nWe see other countries dying to vote, while we have no confidence in our own democracy – our greedy, selfish, money-grabbing system governed by millionaires.\n\nRichard Shurey\n\nPenygraig, Tonypandy\n\nPropping up a corrupt regime\n\nWHEN the death of the 200th British soldier in Afghanistan was announced, I was saddened but proud to organise a silent vigil in Cardiff, protesting against the war.\n\nAfter politicians have shed their crocodile tears, the wives, children and mothers will be left to grieve their loss for years to come.\n\nWhy are we propping up President Karzai and his gang of warlords, gangsters and criminals?\n\nOn his way to his first election, he hosted International Women’s Day in Afghanistan. Since then he has brought in new laws that have undermined women’s rights.\n\nThe election for which so many of our soldiers shed their blood has been tainted by fraud. Women have been prevented from voting by violence or the threat of violence. The biggest kick in the teeth for women has been legislation that allows a husband to starve his wife if she refuses to satisfy his sexual demands.\n\nChildren can be sold off in marriage. Corruption is endemic. Karzai’s family are up to their necks in the drugs trade. Warlords responsible for appalling human rights abuses are playing a leading part in his government.\n\nThe mass media may glorify the war and hypocritical politicians send messages of condolence, but the peace movement will carry on the struggle to end this futile war.\n\nRay Davies\n\nVice Chair CND Cymru\n\nBedwas, Caerphilly\n\nStop attacking our great NHS\n\nTHE adverse reports about the University Hospital of Wales (eg August 19) seem totally unjust. This hospital provides a magnificent service for patients. I have been there for serious operations and the dedication of all concerned was second to none.\n\nWithout the wonderful NHS many people would suffer. I accept problems can arise, as in any organisation, but the overall benefit should not be overlooked. Attacks by British right-wing politicians overseas are despicable. The NHS has provided a comprehensive service since the 1940s and long may that continue. It is something we should cherish.\n\nSteve Tarbet\n\nWestfield Park, St Fagans\n\nFond memories of cinema-going in Cardiff\n\nGOOD for you Patrick Duggan, of Maelfa, Llanedeyrn, for your letter in Monday’s Echo (Viewpoints, August 17), about the Central Cinema, otherwise known as the Bughouse, which supposedly had the best sound effects of all the cinemas in Cardiff.\n\nReading this article brought back many happy memories of my childhood.\n\nOnce a week my grandfather would take me out for a treat, the same one week after week, but it was great.\n\nFirst stop Solly Andrews’ cafe on the Hayes for lunch, then over the road to the island to the fruit and veg stalls for bruised apples and pears.\n\nNext stop the Central Cinema.\n\nHe always made sure that when it was cold we would have a seat near the radiators. They were huge and really out of date, but kept us warm.\n\nSeeing the picture of the Gaumont cinema in Queen Street also brought back happy thoughts.\n\nWhen I was growing up it was the Empire and every Saturday morning the children’s show was great.\n\nThen it became the Gaumont, then in later years C&A, Dixons and now Primark.\n\nNot forgetting the Top Rank nightclub in the basement.\n\nThe children of today cannot really know the old Cardiff unless we, the older generation, tell them of our childhood.\n\nWe don’t need calculations to add up, or the internet to correspond with each other – what is wrong with the verbal contact of writing a letter?\n\nAR Sullivan\n\nWhitchurch, Cardiff\n\nA cinema with a glorious past\n\nI READ with interest Mr Duggan’s letter of August 17 and would like to point out that the picture of “one of the many cinemas in Cardiff” was in fact the Gaumont Theatre, formerly the Empire.\n\nThe commissionaire shown was Mr Gerry Murry, who was also chief of staff.\n\nI was one of the projectionists at the Gaumont at the time. The picture was taken because it was the last day. The theatre closed that day after a long history going back to the music halls.\n\nMany famous names appeared there.\n\nThe Gaumont was far from being a “Bughouse” and was in fact a very fine theatre full of luxury and every comfort. It was at the time a sad loss to the city."
