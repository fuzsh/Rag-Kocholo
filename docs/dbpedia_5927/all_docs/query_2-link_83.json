        "text": "The three-year agreement - which was not a formal coalition - was drawn up in December 2021 in which the two parties agreed to work together in 46 policy areas.\n\nAnnouncing the early end of the agreement, Ap Iorwerth said: \"I am proud of the way in which the agreement demonstrated a new way of doing politics which focused on areas of policy which impact people’s everyday lives.\n\n\"These include rolling out free school meals for all primary school pupils, expanding the free childcare offer for thousands more families, taking radical action to address the housing crisis, steps to safeguard the Welsh language, the creation of a national energy company Ynni Cymru and more.\n\nREAD MORE: SNP MSPs targeted with more online abuse than any other party\n\n\"Working collaboratively was a constructive response to the chaos and uncertainty of Brexit and the Covid pandemic and the harm caused by the UK Conservative Government. We will continue to try to secure the delivery of policies agreed as part of the cooperation agreement.\"\n\nAp Iorwerth cited concerns over First Minister Vaughan Gething’s election campaign finances as a factor, claiming the receipt of £200,000 from a company convicted of environmental offences “demonstrates a significant lack of judgment”.\n\nThe donation from Dauson Environmental Group has been at the centre of an ongoing row given the company has twice been convicted of environmental offences.\n\nThe BBC reported earlier this week £31,600 will go from Gething's leadership campaign to the Labour Party. Senior Labour figures have warned the party against taking any of the cash from Dauson Environmental Group.\n\nAp Iorwerth added: \"Plaid Cymru will move onwards with a clear and continued commitment to scrutinising Labour’s record, and with a renewed determination to put forward bold ideas which match the people of Wales’s ambitions for our country.”\n\nGething said he was disappointed about the end of the agreement, suggesting Plaid Cymru “has decided to walk away from their opportunity to deliver for the people of Wales”.\n\nThe First Minister said: “The co-operation agreement was about mature politics, working together on areas where we agree.\n\n\"While it was always a time-limited agreement, we are disappointed Plaid Cymru has decided to walk away from their opportunity to deliver for the people of Wales.\""
