        "text": "New Report Under Embargo Until: Tuesday 18 June 2024 00.01 hours\n\nNEW REPORT\n\nORGREAVE TRUTH AND JUSTICE: 40 YEARS ON, THE CASE FOR AN INQUIRY\n\nOur new report: ‘Orgreave Truth and Justice: 40 years on, the case for an Inquiry’ is being delivered to the Home Office on 18 June 2024, at 14:00hrs and the major political parties at their headquarters on the same day.\n\nFrom 00.01, 18 June 2024, this report shall also be released to the media and the public here: https://otjc.org.uk/orgreave-truth-and-justice-40-years-on-the-case-for-an-inquiry/\n\nThe report contains new information recently uncovered including public statements of police and government actions during the year-long strike v the truth of their private acts. The report confirms the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her government were influencing the miners’ strike and policing, while publicly stating a policy of ‘non-involvement’.\n\nOrgreave, 18 June 1984 represents one of the most serious abuses of power by police and government in this country’s industrial and trade union history, the truth of which has never been told or acknowledged by the State. Instead, as this report confirms, successive Conservative Governments and senior police have worked to cover it up. Many files remain unexamined or inaccessible to the public until at least 2066.\n\nPatrick McCarroll, Miner at Orgreave said:\n\n“At Orgreave I was terrified. Anyone that says they weren’t is a liar. We were in the field, near the back. There were dogs everywhere. I was chased all the way. The dogs were barking, I ran across the railway line, away from them. I ran and ran, there was an Asda, I ran through that, there were horses chasing men through the car park. There were people hiding up trees, people trying to hide everywhere”\n\nKate Flannery, Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign Secretary said:\n\n“It is important that the truth is established via an independent inquiry and that the police and government are brought to account for their actions at Orgreave on 18 June 1984. This day is particularly significant as it shines a light on what was going on in mining villages and communities throughout the year-long 84/5 miners’ strike. With the National Archive files released it is obvious that Conservative Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher’s involvement alone is enough for an inquiry into Orgreave on 18 June 1984. There are STILL many government files held back – some of which are under lock and key until at least 2066. An inquiry should reveal what is in those files and what has been held back for 40 years.”\n\nKevin Horne, Miner arrested at Orgreave said:\n\n“There has been no accountability of policing at Orgreave. This sent a very clear message that the police could employ violence with impunity. This must surely have set a culture for the police cover up in 1989 at Hillsborough. The police lied in their statements and in court about what they did at Orgreave. We want the answers to questions about the lying and violent behaviour of the police. We want to know how police officers were briefed and why they were not held to account by the Director of Public Prosecutions or their own employer.”\n\nENDS\n\nNOTES TO EDITORS\n\nReport to be delivered to:\n\nHome Office: 2 Marsham Street, London SW1P 4DF (c/o Permanent Secretary).
