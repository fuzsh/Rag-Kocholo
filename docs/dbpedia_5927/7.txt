PLAID Cymru is moving to a new home in Cardiff Bay after 10 years in the city centre.

Party leader Ieuan Wyn Jones yesterday visited the offices in Atlantic Wharf, close to the Senedd and Cardiff County Hall.

The new home is described as a more modern and suitable building than the Ty Gwynfor premises on Park Grove.

Mr Jones said: “The last few years have been exceptional for the party.

“We gained three new seats at the Assembly election, entered into government for the first time in the party’s history and won over 200 seats at the local elections, equalling our best ever result.

“It is definitely time for us to invest in more suitable offices that will help us on our way to gains at the Westminster election and to becoming the largest party in the Assembly.”

Plaid chief executive Gwenllian Lansdown said: “We had no disabled access and we were all hidden away.”
