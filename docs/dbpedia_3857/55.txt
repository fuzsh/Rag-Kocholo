Located in Karaisalı, which is very rich in natural beauties, Bahçecik is a 10-minute walk after Kapıkaya Canyon. It is a place that has remained untouched because it is not well known by the public, and has never spoiled its beauty. Flowing from 20 meters away, Bahçecik Waterfall offers a wonderful view. It has fresh air, waterfall views and a recreation area built into various trees. The municipality has made a nice area for tents and picnic tables. There are areas where you can meet your toilet needs.
