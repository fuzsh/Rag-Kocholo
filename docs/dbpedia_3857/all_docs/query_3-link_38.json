        "text": "Emperor Galerius issued the Worldâ€™s first known edict of tolerance on April 30, 311. With this edict, Christians were granted the freedom to worship and to rebuild their churches, provided they obeyed the laws. Another feature of the edict of toleration is that it inspired the 2nd edict, which was extended to all religions in Milan in 313. These two edicts of tolerance laid the foundations of tolerance in the world.\n\nThe Tolerance Way is the route that we believe the edict was delivered to Nicaea (Nicaea) via Izmit (Nicomedia), the capital of the period and the only city with the title of Metropolis. The total length of it is approximately 126 km (walking and cycling paths), and the GPS points are available online."
