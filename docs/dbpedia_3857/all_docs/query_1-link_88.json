        "text": "Advantages of transfer over other ways to get from Side to Beldibi Bahcecik, Goynuk Mahallesi\n\nAs Side — is an important transport hub in Turkey, there are taxis, shuttles, buses and trains.\n\nHow to get from Side to your destination\n\nThere are at least four ways to get where you need to:\n\nby shared or private transfer;\n\nby taxi (by calling the taxi service or flagging on- site);\n\nby train or subway;\n\nby bus or shuttle bus.\n\nAdvantages of transfer over booking taxi via the app\n\nAdvantages of private transfer\n\nMinimum 10 minutes faster, because the Kiwitaxi driver knows your arrival time in advance and will be waiting for you in Side, at the appointed place.\n\nNo turmoil. You won’t have to search for Wi-Fi, open the app, enter the travel preferences and choose a car — everything you need has already been done.\n\nThe car meets the requirements: necessary amount of seats and luggage space, air conditioner and a child safety seat, if you requested it.\n\nDisadvantage of private transfer\n\nAbout 10–20% more expensive, because Kiwitaxi transfers are provided by certified drivers in the cars no older than 7 years, regularly inspected.\n\nCompare transfer and taxi from Side, booked on-site\n\nAdvantages of private transfer\n\nMinimum 10 minutes faster: there are several official taxi services in Side, but there are often queues to get into a taxi, as the airport staff is distributing the passengers into cars or the tourists are choosing a car too long. Outside the airport you can find owner drivers, catching passengers, but it’s crucial to find the most trustworthy one — and this takes time.\n\nNo communication problems. If you do not speak a foreign language, it’ll be not easy to explain to a taxi driver where to go, how much you are ready to pay and that a child safety seat is obligatory.\n\nSum is known in advance. Every taxi service in Turkey operates according to its own tariff (start fee, mileage, idle time, etс.) Owner drivers charge their own price, judging by the tourist’s looks. The transfer costs as much as it was stated in a voucher at the time or pre-order.\n\nPayment in preferable currency. No need to exchange the currency into the local one, even if you didn’t pay the transfer in full online. Kiwitaxi drivers accept payments in the currency of the pre-order at the official exchange rate.\n\nDisadvantage of private transfer\n\nAbout 5-15% more expensive. If the destination is close to the airport, to catch a taxi on-site may be cheaper as Kiwitaxi operates on the single rate basis within the city area.\n\nTransfer compared to the bus, shuttle, subway or train\n\nAdvantages of private transfer\n\n1,5–2,5 times faster. Given the public transport waiting time and transport changes, it is at average 1,75 times longer to get from Side to the hotel within the city boundaries or to the transport hub.\n\nPeaceful and comfortable. Kiwitaxi driver will be waiting for you in the appointed place at Side and will help you with the luggage. During the trip you can always ask to pull up, stop by a cafe or a shop. If necessary, the driver can help you check into a hotel, acting as an interpreter at the reception - just ask him for it.\n\nFull service You will not get lost in directions in Side, as the driver will meet you and lead you to the car. He will bring you to the designated place, so you won’t have to get there on foot from the public transport stop.\n\nPayment in preferable currency. Similar to booking taxi on-site.\n\nDisadvantage of the private transfer"
