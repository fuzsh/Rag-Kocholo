        "text": "Watching the Donors Conference for the People of Turkey and Syria\n\nPolicy Paper\n\nThe earthquakes that occurred in Turkey on 6 February 2023 are considered the most devastating earthquakes in recent history. On the occasion of the donor conference for the victims of the Kahramanmaraş earthquakes on 20 March 2023, the policy paper by Onur Bahçecik sheds light on the international response to this catastrophe and in particular addresses the political-economic consequences.\n\nDual Pressures on Iran\n\nStudy\n\nThe present study by David Jalilvand examines in view of the pandemic, whether the population and, above all, marginalized groups are affected by the precarious medical care in Iran and whether the sanctions are possibly failing to achieve their goal.\n\n\"The oranges in Europe taste better\"\n\nAbout causes of escape, how to combat them and what's wrong with them.\n\nParadise lost? Developing solutions to Irans environmental crisis\n\nThe greatest threat facing the Islamic Republic of Iran today is not political, nor economic, but environmental. This report takes stock of the urgent environmental crisis, and assesses the capabilities of civil society and the Iranian authorities to develop and implement effective solutions.\n\nPerspectives Middle East & North Africa #10: Borders - Lines in the Sand or in the Mind?\n\nWhile the privileged few may cross legitimately by simply presenting their passport, for most, borders present difficult if not insurmountable hurdles. Furthermore there are plenty of other lines of division: social, ethnic, religious and ideological. Any border is a painful memory of the fact that it is not an individual’s choice to define which side he or she is on.\n\nPerspectives Middle East & North Africa #8: Corruption - Between discourse and reality\n\nThe fight against corruption in the Middle East and North Africa has gone through several ups and downs. Four years after the “Arab Spring”, when demands to eradicate corruption took center stage, we thought it is time to shed some light on the evolution of this issue in the MENA region.\n\nPerspectives Middle East & North Africa #7: Rumours\n\nRumours serve as a medium through which unfulfilled hopes or unspecific fears can be voiced. They bond and drive a wedge between people and population groups at the same time. An issue about the social function of rumours.\n\nPerspectives Middle East & North Africa #6: I do not want to be born a refugee\n\nMillions of Syrians have fled their homes, either inside the country itself or sometimes very far from home. The magazine highlights some key aspects of the Syrian refugee problem through those affected who are living this tragedy.\n\nPerspectives Middle East & North Africa #5: 20 Years Since Oslo - Palestinian Perspectives\n\nMore than twenty years have passed since the historic handshake between Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Israel’s Prime Minister Yitzchak Rabin in Washington D.C. The authors in this volume look at the Oslo years from various angles, including political, legal and economic aspects."
