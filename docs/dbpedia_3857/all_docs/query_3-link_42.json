        "text": "Learn to tap into your own natural healing abilities (quite literally)!\n\nWhat is Emotional Freedom Technique?\n\nEmotional Freedom Technique, or EFT, is a complementary alternative healing technique which entails lightly tapping on certain acupressure points within the 12 meridians throughout the body, releasing and clearing out emotional blocks.\n\nIn Chinese medicine, acupuncturists have identified 365 acupressure points (just like there are 365 days in a year!). And just like there are 12 months in a year, the human body contains 12 acupuncture energy meridians (paths through which life-force energy flows in the body).\n\nJust like acupuncture uses needles to open and stimulate acupressure points, EFT uses tapping which is enough pressure to release the ‚Äústuck‚Äù emotions!\n\nHistory of EFT\n\nEFT was started by Gary Craig in the 1990s, but it actually stems from acupuncturist Dr. Roger Callahan‚Äôs ‚ÄúThought Field Therapy‚Äù (TFT) which was originally developed in the 1980‚Äôs based on the acupressure points and meridians in traditional Chinese medicine.\n\nBoth EFT and TFT have been extensively researched in the last 20 years and have been proven to be a great success for improving depression, anxiety and much more! Being certified in EFT and TFT, and practicing both daily on myself and others, I can confidently agree that either of these tapping modalities (especially when practiced consistently) can do wonders for our mental & emotional wellbeing.\n\nEFT tapping benefits\n\nFirst and foremost, I love EFT because it‚Äôs‚Ä¶\n\nEasy to learn\n\nSimple to practice\n\nEmpowering (once you learn EFT, you can do this for yourself anytime, anywhere)\n\nSafe (no harmful side effects)\n\nNon-invasive\n\nNatural\n\nLow-cost (you‚Äôll save boatloads on psychiatric treatment copays, deductibles, and/or medications)\n\nEnvironmentally savvy (less pharmaceutical waste getting dumped into the ocean)\n\nHighly effective and evidence-based!\n\nEFT tapping for depression\n\nThere are now over 100 studies showing EFT is effective for depression! (1) Fifteen years of evidence-based research from 2000 to 2015 concluded EFT is ‚Äúhighly effective in reducing depressive symptoms in a variety of populations and settings‚Äù (2).\n\nEFT tapping for anxiety\n\nIn Turkey, a study done on nursing students stated ‚ÄúEFT is associated with the release of opioids, serotonin, and gamma-aminobutyric acid, lowering heart rate and decreasing anxiety levels‚Äù (3).\n\nIn the first-ever large scale EFT study which took place in 11 different clinics over a 5 year period, just THREE EFT sessions were shown to improve anxiety in 90% of study participants‚Ä¶ compared to 15 cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) treatment sessions in combination with medications which yielded improvement in only 63% of CBT participants (1).\n\nTo boot, complete relief from anxiety was reported in 76% of people who received EFT by the end of the study, compared to only 51% of people who received CBT reporting complete relief (1).\n\nThat‚Äôs a big deal in the mental health world if you ask me! üòâ (If you‚Äôre wondering why this information isn‚Äôt more readily available, it‚Äôs because it doesn‚Äôt benefit the ‚Äúbottom line‚Äù of the pharmaceutical industry. There‚Äôs definitely a time and a place for medicine, but it‚Äôs not always as necessary or helpful as we‚Äôre programmed to believe.)\n\nEFT tapping for other mental health conditions\n\nEmotional freedom technique tapping sessions can also be used effectively as part of the treatment protocol for conditions such as anger, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), phobias, addictions, phobias, and even physical pain (1).\n\nEFT tapping sessions\n\nDuring EFT 1:1 sessions (held in-person or over Zoom), certain tapping sequences are accompanied by customized statements and mantras which serve to bring up and then clear out the client‚Äôs particular mental/emotional states or blocks throughout the session.\n\nIn my experience, clients respond extremely quickly and can have major breakthroughs even in the first session! For this reason we can address multiple emotional blocks in just one hour.\n\nClients may then keep a private Zoom recording of our EFT sessions and practice often to amplify the results and clear out emotions as needed.\n\nIf this resonates and you‚Äôd like to learn more about how EFT can help you to heal emotionally, I invite you to book your Emotional Freedom Technique breakthrough session here!\n\nReferences:"
