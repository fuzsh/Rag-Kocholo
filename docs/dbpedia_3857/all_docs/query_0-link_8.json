        "text": "The Solarya Volcano-Plutonic Complex (NW Turkey): Petrography, Petrogenesis and Tectonic Implications\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nÃnal, Alp; KamacÄ±, Ãmer; Altunkaynak, Åafak\n\n2014-05-01\n\nThe post collisional magmatic activity produced several volcano-plutonic complexes in NW Anatolia (Turkey) during the late Oligocene- Middle Miocene. One of the major volcano-plutonic complexes, the Solarya volcano-plutonic complex is remarkable for its coeval and cogenetic plutonic (Solarya pluton), hypabysal and volcanic rocks of Early Miocene (24-21 Ma) age. Solarya pluton is an epizonal pluton which discordantly intruded into metamorphic and nonmetamorphic basement rocks of Triassic age. It is a N-S trending magmatic body covering an area of 220 km2,approximatelly 20 km in length and 10 km in width. Based on the field and petrographic studies, three main rock groups distinguished in Solarya pluton; K-feldspar megacrystalline granodiorite, microgranite-granodiorite and haplogranite. Porphyritic and graphic-granophyric textures are common in these three rock groups. Pluton contains magmatic enclaves and syn-plutonic dykes of dioritic composition. Hypabyssal rocks are represented by porphyritic microdiorite and porphyritic quartz-diorite. They form porphyry plugs, sheet inrusions and dykes around the pluton. Porphyrites have microcrystalline-cryptocrystalline groundmass displaying micrographic and granophyric textures. Petrographically similar to the hypabyssal rocks, volcanic rocks are formed from andesitic and dasitic lavas and pyroclastic rocks. Plutonic, hypabyssal and volcanic rocks of Solarya volcano-plutonic complex show similar major-trace element and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic compositions, indicating common magmatic evolution and multicomponent melt sources including mantle and crustal components. They are mainly metaluminous, medium to high-K calc alkaline rocks and display enrichment in LILE and depletion in Nb, Ta, P and Ti. They have initial 87Sr/86Sr values of 0.70701- 0.70818 and 143Nd/144Nd values of 0.51241-0.51250. These geochemical characteristics and isotopic signatures are considered to reflect the composition of the magmas derived from a\n\nTularaemia in Berlin - two independent cases in travellers returning from central Anatolia, Turkey, February 2011.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchubert, A; Splettstoesser, W; BÃ¤tzing-Feigenbaum, J\n\n2011-05-05\n\nTularaemia, though rare, has recently been increasingly reported in Germany. Most cases are indigenous infections. This report describes two epidemiologically independent infections with Francisella tularensis subspecies holarctica detected in Berlin in February 2011 that were acquired in central Anatolia, Turkey. In Turkey, there have been repeated tularaemia outbreaks since 2000 and the disease should therefore be considered as a differential diagnosis in travellers returning from that country.\n\nRole of the Western Anatolia Shear Zone (WASZ) in Neotectonics Evolution of the Western Anatolia Extended Terrain, Turkey\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCemen, I.; Gogus, O. H.; Hancer, M.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nThe Neotectonics period in western Anatolia Extended Terrain, Turkey (WAET) may have initiated in late Oligocene following the Eocene Alpine collision which produced the Izmir-Ankara suture zone. The Western Anatolia Shear Zone (WASZ) bounds the WAET to the east. The shear zone contains mostly normal faults in the vicinity of the Gulf of Gokova. However, its movement is mostly oblique slip from the vicinity of Tavas towards the Lake of Acigol where it makes a northward bend and possibly joins the Eskisehir fault zone to the north of the town of Afyon. The shear zone forms the southern and eastern margins of the Kale-Tavas, Denizli and Acigol basins. The shear zone is similar in its structural/tectonics setting to the Eastern California Shear zone (ECSZ) of the Basins and Ranges of North America Extended terrain which is also composed of many normal to oblique-slip faults and separates two extended terrains with different rates of extension. Western Anatolia experienced many devastating earthquakes within the last 2000 years. Many of the ancient Greek/Roman city states, including Ephesus, Troy, and Hierapolis were destroyed by large historical earthquakes. During the second half of the 20th century, the region experienced two major large earthquake giving normal fault focal mechanism solutions. They are the 1969, M=6.9 Alasehir and the 1970, M=7.1 Gediz earthquakes. These earthquakes had caused substantial damage and loss of life in the region. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the kinematics of the Cenozoic extensional tectonics and earthquake potential of the WASZ in the region, is very important, especially since the fault zone is very close to the major towns in eastern part of western Turkey, such as Mugla, Denizli, Sandikli, Dinar and Afyon.\n\nA new species of Dianthus (Caryophyllaceae) from Antalya, South Anatolia, Turkey.\n\nPubMed\n\nDeniz, Ä°smail GÃ¶khan; Aykurt, Candan; GenÃ§, Ä°lker; Aksoy, Ahmet\n\n2016-01-01\n\nDianthus multiflorus from GazipaÅa (Antalya), south Anatolia (Turkey), is described as a new annual species with verrucose calyx.

However not well linked with tectonics. The so-called \"Ankara MÃ©lange\" belt (AOM) and the basins on top are important elements in the understanding of the Ä°zmir-Ankara-Erzincan suture belt (Ä°AES) evolution in Anatolia (Turkey) and in the evolution of Tethys in minor Asia (Turkey). Some of the basins are directly situated on top of the tectonic slices of the accretionary prism (IAES). However, some are not tectonically well explained as in the case of Haymana basin. The southern continental fragments (eg. KÃ¼tahya-BolkardaÇ§ and KÄ±rÅehir blocks from Gondwana) are approaching to northern continents (Pontides of Lauriasia) where basins like Haymana, AlÃ§Ä±, KÄ±rÄ±kkale and Orhaniye extensional basins are evolved in between the closing margins of two continents. Haymana basin is an extensional basin developed under contractional regime on top of both northward subducting oceanic fragments and an approaching fragments of southern continents. Paleogene (end of Eocene) is the time where the Seas were retreated to S-SE Anatolia leaving a continental setting in Anatolia during Oligocene-Miocene. The slip data gathered from the faults cross-cutting the Paleogene Units and the fabric from Cretaceous mÃ©langes depicts a NNW-SSE to NNE-SSW compressional stress regime operated during post-Eocene-pre-Miocene period. Lately the slip surfaces were overprinted by post-Pliocene normal faulting. Key words: fault slip data, Paleogene, NNW-SSE compression, Anatolia.\n\nTwo-stage Uplift of Granite-Gneiss-Migmatite Complex (GGMC) of ÃataldaÇ§ Core Complex (Western Anatolia, Turkey): the role of detachment faults on uplift processes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKamaci, Omer; Altunkaynak, Safak\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThe most recently identified core complex of western Anatolia (Turkey), the ÃataldaÇ§ Core Complex (ÃCC) consists of a granite-gneiss-migmatite complex (GGMC) representing deep crustal rocks of NW Turkey and a shallow level granodioritic body (ÃG: ÃataldaÇ§ granodiorite). The GGMC is Latest Eocene-Early Oligocene and ÃG is Early Miocene in age, and both were exhumed in the footwall of the ÃataldaÇ§ Detachment Fault Zone (ÃDFZ) in the Early Miocene. On the basis of correlation of age data and the closure temperatures of zircon, monazite, muscovite, biotite and K-feldspar, the T-time history of GGMC reveals that GGMC has experienced at least two stages of cooling and uplift, from 33.8 to 30.1 Ma and 21.3 to 20.7 Ma. In stage I, from 33.8 to 30.1 Ma, the cooling rate of GGMC was relatively slow (35Â°C/my) however cooling rate increase dramatically to â¥500Â°C/my in stage II between 21.3 and 20.7 Ma. T-time history also indicate that GGMC was elevated to the final location in at least 8-13 My according to the monazite and zircon and mica ages obtained from the same rock. Rapid slab rollback at the Hellenic trench at ca. 23 Ma may have increased extension rates leading to the development of detachment faults (i.e. ÃDFZ), core complexes and associated syn-extensional granitoids in Western Anatolia and the Aegean extensional province.\n\nMay-June precipitation reconstruction of southwestern Anatolia, Turkey during the last 900 years from tree rings\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTouchan, Ramzi; Akkemik, Ãnal; Hughes, Malcolm K.; Erkan, Nesat\n\n2007-09-01\n\nA May-June precipitation reconstruction (AD 1097-2000) has been developed for southwestern Anatolia in Turkey, the longest reported to date in this region. The reconstruction was derived from a regional Juniperus excelsa chronology that was built from material sampled at four sites in the Antalya and Mersin Districts. The regional tree-ring chronology accounts for 51% of the variance of instrumentally observed May-June precipitation. The years AD 1518 to 1587 are the most humid period in the reconstruction, coinciding with a major shift in European climate. The driest 70-year period in the reconstruction is AD 1195 to 1264. The period AD 1591-1660 represents the third driest and was characterized by instability climatically, politically, and socially in Anatolia.\n\nPlate tectonics and biogeographical patterns of the Pseudophoxinus (Pisces: Cypriniformes) species complex of central Anatolia, Turkey.\n\nPubMed\n\nHrbek, Tomas; StÃ¶lting, Kai N; Bardakci, Fevzi; KÃ¼Ã§Ã¼k, Fahrettin; Wildekamp, Rudolf H; Meyer, Axel\n\n2004-07-01\n\nWe investigated the phylogenetic relationships of Pseudophoxinus (Cyprinidae: Leuciscinae) species from central Anatolia, Turkey to test the hypothesis of geographic speciation driven by early Pliocene orogenic events. We analyzed 1141 aligned base pairs of the complete cytochrome b mitochondrial gene. Phylogenetic relationships reconstructed by maximum likelihood, Bayesian likelihood, and maximum parsimony methods are identical, and generally well supported. Species and clades are restricted to geologically well-defined units, and are deeply divergent from each other. The basal diversification of central Anatolian Pseudophoxinus is estimated to have occurred approximately 15 million years ago. Our results are in agreement with a previous study of the Anatolian fish genus Aphanius that also shows a diversification pattern driven by the Pliocene orogenic events. The distribution of clades of Aphanius and Pseudophoxinus overlap, and areas of distribution comprise the same geological units. The geological history of Anatolia is likely to have had a major impact on the diversification history of many taxa occupying central Anatolia; many of these taxa are likely to be still unrecognized as distinct.

This study was conducted between January and August 2008 on a randomly selected sample of participants from semi-rural settlement areas of the Eskisehir province, Central Anatolia, Turkey. The MetS was diagnosed as the presence of 3, or more risk factors according to the National Cholesterol Education Program-Expert Panel Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) criteria. The MetS prevalence was standardized according to age, and logistic regression was used to determine the risk factors affecting prevalence. The study group composed of 2,766 people (40.4% male, 59.6% female). The corrected MetS prevalence according to age was 27.6%, with values of 19.4% in males, and 33.2% in females. The prevalence increased with increasing age in both genders. Groups engaged in heavy physical exercise, and smoking showed decreased odds of having MetS, while MetS risk was lower in men who consumed proper amounts of red meat, fruits, and vegetables. In the MetS group, central obesity risk was higher for women, whereas hypertriglyceridemia risk was higher for men. In the non-MetS group, hypertension, and central obesity risks were higher for women, whereas hypertriglyceridemia risk was higher for men. It was concluded that MetS is a major problem in the Eskisehir province, and it is imperative that changes in lifestyle be made within this population to reduce the risk factors for the condition.\n\nPost-Paleogene Deformation in central Anatolia, South of Ankara (Turkey)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRojay, Bora\n\n2014-05-01\n\nThe closure of the northern Neo-Tethys took place between Eurasia in the north and northern edge of Afro- Arabian plate in the south since the Early Cretaceous is documented in central Anatolia. It is mated by Cretaceous ophiolitic mÃ©langes thrusted over southwards on to the upper Cretaceous-Paleogene fore-arc and foreland sequences along the northern margins of Haymana and TuzgÃ¶lÃ¼ basins, respectively. Two main deformation episodes are recognized in the region. These include post-Cretaceous-pre Miocene compressional regime and Miocene to mid-Pliocene transcurrent regime dominated extensional deformation. The first regime is characterize by NW-SE directed compressional and contractional deformation dominated by south vergent, large wave length, asymmetric to overturned folds and associated thrust/reverse faults. Some of these reverse faults were reactivated as strike-slip faults with reverse components as evidenced by cross-cutting relationships and overprinting slickensides observed extensively in the field. Along these reactivated faults, echelon calcite veins, fault parallel meter thick silica walls with repeated phases of deformation are very common. Following the Miocene, the region is affected by a NNE-SSW to NE-SW directed extension, possibly resulted from the interaction of TuzgÃ¶lÃ¼ Fault with the northwards convex splays of dextral North Anatolian Fault extending into the region. As a conclusion, the Paleogene sequences with ophiolitic mÃ©langes are deformed under NNE-SSW directed compression related to the development of dextral strike slip tectonics during post-Paleogene-pre-Miocene period.

The high seismic activity is a result of the complex tectonic deformation of the Anatolian plate which has been dominated by the N-S extensional tectonic regime in the western edge. This extensional tectonic regime is partially maintained by a relative movement of the African-Arabian plates to north, average 2.5 cm per year. In western Turkey, relatively 3 major earthquakes (Mwâ¥6.0) were identified on the SultandaÄÄ± Fault zone (Afyon-AkÅehir Graben) between years of 2000-2002. First event occurred at the year of 2000 (Eber-Sultandagi Earthquake, Mw=6.0) , and both events were occurred at February 3, 2002 SultandaÄÄ± (Mw=6.5) and Cay-Sultandagi (Mw=6.0). In this study, mentioned local earthquake activity, have been investigated to understand their nature and relation of the regional seismic activity and tectonic deformation on the SultandaÄÄ± Fault Zone (Afyon-AkÅehir Graben) in western Anatolia. At first, we analyzed the distribution of mainshock and aftershocks of the two earthquakes which occurred in February 3, 2002 in the region. Fault mechanism solutions of the selected earthquakes and detailed stress regime analyses performed for the mainshock and aftershock sequences of two earthquakes. In regard with mentioned earthquakes, the identified surface ruptures have been investigated by detailed geological field study in the region. Also source mechanism solutions of the selected 17 regional earthquakes between years of 2000 and 2009 years in the region provided to understand the relation of the Sultandagi earthquakes sequences and regional seismic activity. Regional and local seismic investigations shows that, consecutive seismic activity is a result of the disturbance of stress balance in the region which has been triggered by sequentially occuring of earthquakes and triggering in short interval in years of 2000-2002. Also all seismic source studies approved that extensional deformation\n\nO, Sr and Nd isotopic constraints on Cenozoic granitoids of Northwestern Anatolia, Turkey: Enrichment by subduction zone fluids\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYÃ¼cel-ÃztÃ¼rk, YeÅim\n\n2016-05-01\n\nThe oxygen and strontium isotope compositions of Cenozoic granitoids cropping out in the Ä°zmir-Ankara-Erzincan suture zone help constrain the petrological evolution of magmatism in northwest Anatolia. The magmatism was mostly widespread between late Eocene (â¼37 Ma) and the middle Miocene (â¼14-15 Ma), and is represented by volcanic and plutonic rocks of orogenic affinity, of which Ezine, EÄrigÃ¶z, ÃataldaÄ and Kozak are the largest Tertiary granitic plutons exposed in northwest Anatolia. They vary from granite to granodiorite, and are subalkaline, belonging to the high-K calc-alkaline I-type granite series. All these characteristics, combined with major, trace element geochemical data as well as mineralogical and textural evidence, reveal that the Oligocene-Miocene granitoids of NW Anatolia are comparable with volcanic arc granites, formed in a transitional oceanic to continental collisional tectonic setting, from a hybrid source, having crustal and mantle components that underwent further interaction with the upper crust. These plutons have initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios of 0.7072-0.7094, and ÎµNd(t) values ranging from -3.48 to -1.20. These characteristics also indicate that a crustal component played an important role in the petrogenesis of NW Anatolian Oligocene-Miocene granitoids. The moderately evolved Ezine, EÄrigÃ¶z, ÃataldaÄ and Kozak granitoids, have Î´18O values that are consistent with those of normal I-type granites (6-10â°), but the Î´18O relationships among minerals of samples collected from the intrusive contacts which are closest to mineralized zones, indicate a major influence of hydrothermal processes under subsolidus conditions. The oxygen isotope systematics of the samples from these plutons result from the activity of high-Î´18O fluids (magmatic water), with major involvement of low-Î´18O fluids (meteoric water) evident, near the edge zone of these plutons. This is most evident in Î´18O quartz-feldspar pairs from these granitoids, which\n\nThe prevalence of BehÃ§et's disease in a city in Central Anatolia in Turkey.\n\nPubMed\n\nÃÃ¶lgeÃ§en, Emine; Ãzyurt, Kemal; FerahbaÅ, Ayten; Borlu, Murat; Kulluk, PÄ±nar; ÃztÃ¼rk, Ahmet; Ãner, AyÅe ÃztÃ¼rk; GÃ¼n, Ä°skender; AÅÃ§Ä±oÄlu, Ãzcan\n\n2015-03-01\n\nThe prevalence of BehÃ§et's disease (BD) is much higher in countries along the ancient Silk Route, extending from Japan to Mediterranean countries including Turkey, than in northern Europe and the USA. The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence of BD in Kayseri, a city in Central Anatolia in Turkey. This study investigated cross-sectional prevalences of BD in individuals aged >10Â years in Kayseri, Turkey, in two stages. The first stage aimed to identify individuals with recurrent oral ulcers (ROUs) through home visits, and the second stage aimed to further examine those with ROUs for the presence of other BD-related manifestations under hospital conditions. The study was conducted using the criteria defined by the International Study Group for BehÃ§et's Disease. The sample size was determined to be 4697 with an expected sampling error of 5.5 per 10,000, with a 95% confidence interval. A standard questionnaire was administered to a total of 5218 individuals. A history of ROU was recorded in 470 (9.0%) of the 5218 residents, and a previous diagnosis of BD was recorded in nine individuals. The prevalence rate of BD was estimated as 17 cases per 10,000 population in Kayseri, Turkey. The present study contributes towards estimations of prevalences of BD in Turkey and towards raising public awareness about the disease. It also supports previous studies that have reported the world's highest prevalences of BD in Turkey.

Few studies of the crustal structure of Anatolia have been performed, however, studies of the crustal structure of Eastern Anatolia showed that crustal thicknesses were thinner than previously thought. To further investigate the crustal structure in Central Anatolia, we present results from receiver function analysis using new data from broad-band instruments. The stations were equipped with 7 broadband three-component STS-2 and 13 short period three-component S-13 sensors. These stations operated for period of one and half months between the October and November, 2002, and yielded data for ~ 40 high quality receiver functions. Additionally, receiver functions were also computed using data from permanent stations MALT, ISP, and ANTO. We applied the hk-stacking technique of Zhu and Kanamori (2000) to receiver functions to obtain the crustal thickness and Vp/Vs ratios. Furthermore, we applied a waveform modeling technique to investigate mid-crustal discontinuties previously imaged in the region. Our results compare well with refraction-based crustal thicknesses in overlapped areas.\n\nMetamorphic belts of Anatolia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOberhÃ¤nsli, Roland; Prouteau, Amaury; Candan, Osman; Bousquet, Romain\n\n2015-04-01\n\nInvestigating metamorphic rocks from high-pressure/low-temperature (HP/LT) belts that formed during the closure of several oceanic branches, building up the present Anatolia continental micro-plate gives insight to the palaeogeography of the Neotethys Ocean in Anatolia. Two coherent HP/LT metamorphic belts, the TavÅanlÄ± Zone (distal Gondwana margin) and the Ãren-Afyon-BolkardaÄ Zone (proximal Gondwana margin), parallel their non-metamorphosed equivalent (the Tauride Carbonate Platform) from the Aegean coast in NW Anatolia to southern Central Anatolia. P-T conditions and timing of metamorphism in the Ãren-Afyon-BolkardaÄ Zone (>70?-65 Ma; 0.8-1.2 GPa/330-420Â°C) contrast those published for the overlying TavÅanlÄ± Zone (88-78 Ma; 2.4 GPa/500 Â°C). These belts trace the southern Neotethys suture connecting the Vardar suture in the Hellenides to the Inner Tauride suture along the southern border of the KirÅehir Complex in Central Anatolia. Eastwards, these belts are capped by the Oligo-Miocene Sivas Basin. Another HP/LT metamorphic belt, in the Alanya and Bitlis regions, outlines the southern flank of the Tauride Carbonate Platform. In the Alanya Nappes, south of the Taurides, eclogites and blueschists yielded metamorphic ages around 82-80 Ma (zircon U-Pb and phengite Ar-Ar data). The Alanya-Bitlis HP belt testifies an additional suture not comparable to the northerly TavÅanlÄ± and Ãren-Afyon belts, thus implying an additional oceanic branch of the Neotethys. The most likely eastern lateral continuation of this HP belt is the Bitlis Massif, in SE Turkey. There, eclogites (1.9-2.4 GPa/480-540Â°C) occur within calc-arenitic meta-sediments and in gneisses of the metamorphic (Barrovian-type) basement. Zircon U-Pb ages revealed 84.4-82.4 Ma for peak metamorphism. Carpholite-bearing HP/LT metasediments representing the stratigraphic cover of the Bitlis Massif underwent 0.8-1.2 GPa/340-400Â°C at 79-74 Ma (Ar-Ar on white mica). These conditions compares to the Tav\n\nHydrothermal fluids circulation and travertine deposition in an active tectonic setting: Insights from the Kamara geothermal area (western Anatolia, Turkey)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBrogi, Andrea; AlÃ§iÃ§ek, M.

Although such a certainty, their relationships are debated mainly addressing on the role of the tectonic activity in triggering and controlling fluids flow and travertine deposition. In this paper, we present the results of an integrated study carried out in a geothermal area located in western Anatolia (Turkey), nearby the well-known Pamukkale area (Denizli Basin). Our study focused on the relationships among hydrothermal fluids circulation, travertine deposition and tectonic activity, with particular emphasis on the role of faults in controlling fluids upwelling, thermal springs location and deposition of travertine masses. New field mapping and structural/kinematics analyses allowed us to recognize two main faults systems (NW- and NE-trending), framed in the Neogene-Quaternary extensional tectonic evolution of western Anatolia. A geo-radar (GPR) prospection was also provided in a key-area, permitting us to reconstruct a buried fault zone and its relationships with the development of a fissure-ridge travertine deposit (Kamara fissure-ridge). The integration among structural and geophysical studies, fluids inclusion, geochemical, isotopic data and 230 Th/238 U radiometric age determination on travertine deposits, depict the characteristics of the geothermal fluids and their pathway, up to the surface. Hydrological and seismological data have been also taken in account to investigate the relation between local seismicity and fluid upwelling. As a main conclusion we found strict relationships among tectonic activity, earthquakes occurrence, and variation of the physical/chemical features of the hydrothermal fluids, presently exploited at depth, or flowing out in thermal springs. In the same way, we underline the tectonic role in controlling the travertine deposition, making travertine (mainly banded travertine) a useful proxy to reconstruct the\n\nKaletepe Deresi 3 (Turkey): archaeological evidence for early human settlement in Central Anatolia.\n\nPubMed\n\nSlimak, Ludovic; Kuhn, Steven L; Roche, HÃ©lÃ¨ne; Mouralis, Damase; Buitenhuis, Hijlke; Balkan-Atli, Nur; Binder, Didier; KuzucuoÄlu, Catherine; Guillou, HervÃ©\n\n2008-01-01\n\nLocated in the Central Anatolian Volcanic Province, Kaletepe Deresi 3 was discovered in the summer of 2000 and has been under investigation since that time. Volcanic activity in the region generated a number of obsidian intrusions that have attracted humans to the area throughout prehistory. The stratigraphic sequence at Kaletepe Deresi 3, more than 7 m in depth, presents a series of archaeological horizons representing the Lower and Middle Paleolithic. The site contains the longest open-air Paleolithic sequence excavated in Turkey, as well as the first in situ Acheulean industry documented in Anatolia.

Kirk; Cosca, Michael\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThe widespread mafic volcanism, elevated crustal temperatures, and plateau-type topography in Central Anatolia, Turkey, could collectively be the result of lithospheric delamination, mantle upwelling, and tectonic escape in response to Arabian-Anatolian plate collision. We used the results from basalt geochemistry and a passive-source broadband seismic experiment obtained as part of an international collaborative effort (Continental Dynamics - Central Anatolia Tectonics) to investigate the crust-mantle structure and melting conditions associated with the Quaternary Hasandag Monogenic Cluster (HMC) south and west of Hasandag volcano. The HMC is unusually mafic, not only for Central Anatolia but globally, enabling meaningful comparisons between geochemical and seismic interpretations of mantle conditions. HMC basalts are characterized by orogenic signatures that could have originated (1) in mantle wedge that, after stagnating because of collision, was remobilized south and upward as a result of rollback of the African slab or, alternatively (2) by piecemeal foundering of residual mantle lithosphere into convecting upper mantle, producing small-scale convection and associated decompression melting. Melt equilibration conditions for the HMC are hot (TP Ë1335-1250Ë C, assuming 1-4 wt.% H2O) and shallow (P = 1.1 to 1.6 GPa), approaching those for MORB. Shear wave velocities are relatively constant at Ë4.1 km/s between the Moho and a depth of Ë45-50 km (Ë1.4 GPa; Fig. 6), below which Vs increases with increasing depth. We infer that a melt-perfused mantle lid could be locally present between 40 and 55 km. In contrast to Central Anatolia, estimated equilibration conditions for Western Anatolia and Eastern Anatolia (east of the Inner Tauride Suture) mantle melts are hotter (by â¥60Ë C) and deeper (mostly by 0.6-1.0 GPa). They also have chemical signatures that, unlike Central Anatolia, are similar to those of intraplate basalts. These differences are likely related\n\nMucocutaneous warts in Middle Anatolia, Turkey: clinical presentations and therapeutic approaches\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGÃ¶nÃ¼l, MÃ¼zeyyen; Iyidal, AyÅegÃ¼l YalÃ§Ä±nkaya; Ãakmak, Seray; KÄ±lÄ±Ã§, Arzu; Gul, Ulker; Doner, Pinar\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIntroduction Viral warts are common skin condition caused by the human papilloma virus. Aim To determine the clinical features of warts and therapeutic approaches to warts and compare them with the literature. Material and methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 362 consecutive patients presenting to a dermatology clinic in Ankara, Middle Anatolia, Turkey. Age, gender, anatomic localization, clinical types, number of warts, and medical therapy histories were recorded. Results In our study 139 (38.4%) children and 223 (61.6%) adults had warts. Warts were seen in 191 men, and 171 women. The mean age was 24.7 Â±13.5. In all groups the incidence and the number of warts were higher in men. Clinical types of warts were vulgar, anogenital, plantar, verruca plana, filiform, and mosaic. Thirty-six (9.9%) of 362 cases had more than one type. The locations of warts were as follows extremities (n = 233, 64.4%), anogenital (n = 86, 23.7%) and head and neck (n = 73, 20.2%). The incidence of anogenital warts was statistically higher in men than women (p < 0.05). Topical medical treatment was the first choice (n = 60, 57.1%). Conclusions In our study, the incidence and the number of warts were higher in men, which is different than in previous reports. The anogenital wart (AW) was ranked second in all types of warts. According to this finding, we can say that the frequency of AW has been increased in Turkey. To our knowledge recently there have been no studies investigating the clinical features of viral warts in all ages in the literature.

The Paleozoic metamorphic rocks of the Menderes Massif form the basement rocks in the area which are overlain by 760 m thick Izmir-flysch series consisting of metamorphic rocks, limestones and ultrabasic rocks tectonically. The Pliocene BahÃ§ecik formation which consists of an alternation of conglomerates, sandstones, claystones, lignite and limestones and shows a thickness of 300 m overlies the (Ä°zmir) flysch series discordantly. This is overlain by 430 m thick YenikÃ¶y formation composed of conglomerates, sandstones, claystones and clayey limestones discordantly. The Miocene volcanic rocks of CumaovasÄ± overlie the YenikÃ¶y formation concordantly which are overlain by alluvium and travertine deposits. Geothermal waters which are observed in the localities of Tuzla, CumalÄ±, DoÄanbey and KarakoÃ§ are associated with NE-SW trending faults in the area. The geothermal waters in the area are considered as Na-Cl or Na-Cl-HCO3 type waters. The geothermal waters of Seferihisar and environs are identified to be Na+K>Ca>Mg dominant cations and Cl>HCO3>SO4 dominant anions. According to the diagram of Na/100-K/100-âMg, a certainly part of the thermal waters can be considered as equilibrated thermal waters during some waters are of immature waters. According to the results of geochemical thermometers, the reservoir temperatures of thermal waters range from 150 to 240Â°C. The Î´2H values of thermal waters are between -13,3 to -31,9, while Î´18O values range from -2,55 to -5,70. The tritium contents of thermal waters are between 13 to 64Â±10 TU.\n\nStructural Evolution of central part of the Tuzgolu (Salt Lake) Basin, Central Anatolia, Turkey\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAda, M.; Cemen, I.; ÃaptuÄ, A.; Demirci, M.; Engin, C.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe Tuzgolu Basin in Central Anatolia, Turkey, covers low-relief areas located between the Pontide Mountains to the North and Tauride Mountains to the South. The basin started to form as a rift basin during the Late Maastrichtian. The main Tuzgolu-Aksaray fault zone on the eastern margin of the basin and the northwest trending Yeniceoba and Cihanbeyli fault zones on the western margin of the basin were probably developed during that time. The basin has also experienced westward extension in response to westward escape of the Anatolian plate since Late Miocene. Several geologic studies have been conducted in the Tuz GÃ¶lÃ¼ (Salt Lake) Basin and surrounding areas to determine structural and tectono-stratigraphic development of the basin. However, there are still many questions regarding the structural evolution of the basin. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the structural evolution of the central Tuzgolu Basin based on the structural interpretation of available 2-D seismic reflection profiles, well log analysis and construction of structural cross sections. The cross-sections will be based on depth converted seismic lines to determine structural geometry of the faults and folds. A preliminary Petrel project has been prepared using available seismic profiles. Our preliminary structural interpretations suggest that a well-developed rollover anticline was developed with respect to the westward extension in Central Anatolia. The rollover anticline is faulted in its crest area by both down-to-the west and down-to-the east normal faults. The geometry of the main boundary fault at depth still remains in question. We anticipate that this question will be resolved based on depth converted structural cross-sections and their restoration.\n\nUsing Facilities And Potential Of Geothermal Resources In The Canakkale Province - NW Turkey\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDeniz, Ozan; Acar Deniz, Zahide\n\n2016-04-01\n\nTurkey, due to its geological location, has a rich potential in point of geothermal resources. Ãanakkale province is located northwestern (NW) part of Turkey and it has important geothermal fields in terms of geothermal energy potential. Geothermal resources reach to the surface both effects of past volcanic activity and extensions of fault zones associated with complex tectonic systems in the region. The aim of this study is to summarize hydrogeochemical characteristics, using facilities and potential of hot springs and spas located in the Ãanakkale province. There are 13 geothermal fields in the region and the surface temperatures of hot springs are ranging between 28 centigrade degree and 175 centigrade degree. Hydrogeochemical compositions of thermal water display variable chemical compositions. Na, Ca, SO4, HCO3 and Cl are the dominant ions in these waters. Thermal waters of Tuzla and Kestanbol geothermal fields which is located the near coastal area can be noted NaCl type. Because these two geothermal waters have high TDS values, scaling problems are seen around the hot springs and pipelines. Geothermal waters in the province are meteoric origin according to oxygen-18, deuterium and tritium isotopes data. Long underground residence times of these waters and its temperatures have caused both more water - rock interaction and low tritium values. Geothermal energy is utilized in many areas in Turkey today. It is generally used for space heating, balneotherapy and electricity generation. Explorations of geothermal resources and investments in geothermal energy sector have risen rapidly in the recent years particularly in western Turkey. High-temperature geothermal fields are generally located in this region related to the Aegean Graben System and the North Anotalian Fault Zone. All geothermal power plants in Turkey are located in this region. Considering the Ãanakkale province, most geothermal fields are suitable for multipurpose usage but many of them have\n\nProkaryotic diversity in the extreme lakes of Turkey, SW Anatolia, Turkey\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDemirel, Cansu; GÃ¼l KaragÃ¼ler, Nevin; MenekÅe-KÄ±lÄ±Ã§, Meryem; AkÃ§er-Ãn, Sena; Haydar GÃ¼ltekin, A.; BalcÄ±, NurgÃ¼l\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThe Lake District, located in the SW Anatolia region of Turkey, hosts a number of lakes with unique water chemistry. Among them, Lake Acigol, Lake Salda and Lake Yarisli display extreme biogeochemical conditions. In terms of their water chemistry and diverse prokaryotic community, each lake sets a great example for microbially mediated reactions (e.g carbonate precipitation). Lake Acigol (average pH around 8.6) is known for hypersaline and alkaline water chemistry. Lake Salda (average pH around 9.1) is known for its hydromagnesite beaches, clayey-hydromagnesite shoreline and ancient-modern stromatolite formations as well as being a model for Mars. For the first time, Lake Yarisli having alkaline conditions with an average pH value of 9.5 is investigated for its geochemistry and geobiology during this study. Algal bloom and well developed cyanobacterial mats are visible on shallow waters along the Eastern shoreline of the lake. In scope of elucidating complex bio/geochemical reactions that regulate C, S and O cycles in the extreme conditions of these lakes, water, surface sediment and shallow core samples were collected. For the first time, prokaryotic diversity of Lake Acigol, Salda and Yarisli were determined by Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) during this study (Balci et al., 2013). Preliminary results revealed the total number of bacterial classes determined for Lake Acigol, Lake Salda and Lake Yarisli as 22, 19 and 19; respectively. Lake Acigol, Salda and Yarisli are mostly dominated by bacterial classes of Alphaproteobacteria (68.2%, 25.6% and 1.9%; respectively), Cyanobacteria (10.2%, 5.3% and 92.9%; respectively), Bacilli (9.6%, 23.7% and 0.45%; respectively), Gammaproteobacteria (6.1%, 39.6% and 4.3%; respectively) and Actinobacteria (2.7%, 1.8% and 0.06%; respectively). The total number of archaeal classes determined for Lake Acigol, Lake Salda and Lake Yarisli are 8, 7 and 6; respectively. Common most dominant archaeal classes of Lake Acigol, Lake Salda\n\n[Confirmation of West Nile virus seroreactivity in central nervous system infections of unknown etiology from Ankara Province, Central Anatolia, Turkey].\n\nPubMed\n\nErgÃ¼nay, Koray; Ãzkul, Aykut\n\n2011-04-01\n\nWest Nile virus (WNV) infections may trigger febrile conditions and/or neuroinvasive disease in a portion of the exposed individuals. Serosurveillance data from various regions of Turkey indicate WNV activity. The aim of this study was to confirm the antibody specificity of the serum samples via virus neutralization assay, previously reported to be reactive for WNV IgM. The samples originated from two individuals with the preliminary diagnosis of aseptic meningitis/encephalitis of unknown etiology in 2009 and had been classified as probable WNV infections. Cerebrospinal fluid and sera samples of these patients had been evaluated as negative for WNV RNA and IgG antibodies. Only one serum sample could be included in the neutralization assay due to the limited amounts in the current investigation. The sample was observed as positive in dilutions of 1/20 and 1/40, thus confirming the diagnosis of WNV-related central nervous system infection in a 62 year-old female patient from Ankara, Central Anatolia, Turkey.\n\nEffect of soil conditions on predicted ground motion: Case study from Western Anatolia, Turkey\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGok, Elcin; ChÃ¡vez-GarcÃ­a, Francisco J.; Polat, Orhan\n\n2014-04-01\n\nWe present a site effect study for the city of Izmir, Western Anatolia, Turkey. Local amplification was evaluated using state-of-practice tools. Ten earthquakes recorded at 16 sites were analysed using spectral ratios relative to a reference site, horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratios, and an inversion scheme of the Fourier amplitude spectra of the recorded S-waves. Seismic noise records were also used to estimate site effects. The different estimates are in good agreement among them, although a basic uncertainty of a factor of 2 seems difficult to decrease. We used our site effect estimates to predict ground motion in Izmir for a possible M6.5 earthquake close to the city using stochastic modelling. Site effects have a large impact on PSV (pseudospectral velocity), where local amplification increases amplitudes by almost a factor of 9 at 1 Hz relative to the firm ground condition. Our results allow identifying the neighbourhoods of Izmir where hazard mitigation measurements are a priority task and will also be useful for planning urban development.\n\nEarthquake Records of North Anatolian Fault from Sapanca Lake Sediments, NW Anatolia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYalamaz, Burak; Cagatay, NamÄ±k; Acar, Dursun; Demirbag, Emin; Gungor, Emin; Gungor, Nurdan; Gulen, Levent\n\n2014-05-01\n\nWe determined earthquake records in sediment cores of Sapanca Lake which is a pull-apart basin located along the North Anatolian Fault zone in NW Anatolia. The lake has a maximum depth of 55 m, and a surface area of 46.8 km2, measuring 16 km in E-W and 5 km in N-S directions. A systematic study of the sedimentological, physical and geochemical properties of three water-sediment interface cores, up to 75.7 cm long, located along depth transects ranging from 43 to 51.5 m water depths. The cores were analyzed using Geotek Multi Sensor Core Logger (MSCL) for physical properties, laser particle size analyzer for granulometry, TOC Analyzer for Total Organic Content (TOC) and Total Inorganic Carbon (TIC) analysis, Itrax-XRF Core Scanner for elemental analysis and digital X-RAY Radiography. The geochronology was determined using AMS radiocarbon and radionuclide methods. The Sapanca Lake earthquake records are characterized by mass flow units consisting of grey or dark grey coarse to fine sand and silty mud with sharp basal and transional upper boundaries. The units commonly show normal size grading with their basal parts showing high density, and high magnetic susceptibility and enrichment in one or more elements, such as Si, Ca, TÄ°, K, Rb, Zr and Fe, indicative of coarse detrial input. Based on radionuclide and radiocarbon analyses the mass flow units are correlated with 1999 Ä°zmit and DÃ¼zce earthquakes (Mw=7.4 and 7.2, respectively) , 1967 Mudurnu earthquake (Mw= 6,8), and 1957 Abant (Mw= 7.1) earthquake.

Asphaltite is also a solidified hydro carbon compound derived from petroleum [1]. According to the World Energy Council, Turkish National Committee (1998), the total reserve of the asphaltic substances that are found in south eastern Turkey is about 82 million tons, with Silopi and Sirnak reserves to get her comprising the major part of the Asphaltite deposits. Selenium and Nickel are very important elements both environmental and health. Selenium plays an important role in the formation of the enzyme antioxidant effect in the cell. The need for Selenium increases in situations such as pregnancy, menopause, grow than development, air pollution. Nickel is used for preventing iron-poor blood, increasing iron absorption, and treating weak bones. In this study, asphaltites were taken from Milli vein from Sirnak deposit in SE Anatolia of Turkey. A total of 6.500.000 tons of Asphaltite reserves have been identified as asphaltites in Milli (Sirnak). The sample preparation method was developed in Asphaltite by spectroanalytical techniques, wet acid digestion. MW-AD followed by ICP-OES were used for the determination of Selenium and Nickel in Asphaltite. Proximate analysis of Asphaltite fly ash samples was made. It also, Selenium and Nickel element analysis in Asphaltite were made.\n\n[Investigation of dengue virus and yellow fever virus seropositivities in blood donors from Central/Northern Anatolia, Turkey].\n\nPubMed\n\nErgÃ¼nay, Koray; Saygan, Mehmet B; AydoÄan, Sibel; Litzba, Nadine; Niedrig, Matthias; PÄ±nar, Ahmet; Us, DÃ¼rdal\n\n2010-07-01\n\nDengue virus (DENV) and yellow fever virus (YFV) are two of the globally prevalent vector-borne flaviviruses. Data on these viruses from Turkey is limited to a single study originating from the western, Aegean region of Turkey, where evidence for DENV exposure had been confirmed in residents and presence of hemagglutination inhibiting antibodies against YFV had been revealed. The aim of this study was to investigate the rates of seropositivity of DENV and YFV in blood donors from Central/Northern Anatolia, Turkey, for the demonstration of possible human exposure. Serum samples were collected by the Turkish Red Crescent Middle Anatolia Regional Blood Center from donation sites at Ankara, Konya, EskiÅehir and Zonguldak provinces and included in the study after informed consent. Ankara is the capital and second most-populated city in Turkey. All samples were previously evaluated for West Nile and tick-borne encephalitis virus antibodies and found to be negative. A total of 2435 and 1502 sera have been evaluated for IgG antibodies against DENV and YFV, respectively. Commercial enzymelinked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and indirect immunofluorescence tests (IIFTs) were applied (Euroimmun, Germany) for DENV/YFV IgG surveillance. DENV IgG reactive sera were further evaluated for IgM by ELISA and a commercial mosaic IIFT to determine DENV subtypes. IgM positive samples were also analyzed by a commercial NS1 antigen detection assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, France). YFV IgG reactive samples were evaluated by IIFT for IgM and via mosaic IIFT and antibody specificity were confirmed by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Anti-DENV IgGs were demonstrated in repeated assays in 0.9% (21/2435) of the sera. In two samples with borderline IgG results, presence of DENV IgM was detected, one of which was also borderline positive for DENV NS1 antigen. In 14.3% (3/21) of the IgG reactive sera, mosaic IIFT was evaluated as positive and displayed prominent reactivity for DENV-2 in\n\nEffect of the Syrian Civil War on Prevalence of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in Southeastern Anatolia, Turkey.\n\nPubMed\n\nInci, Rahime; Ozturk, Perihan; Mulayim, Mehmet Kamil; Ozyurt, Kemal; Alatas, Emine Tugba; Inci, Mehmet Fatih\n\n2015-07-20\n\nCutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a vector-mediated skin disease, characterized by chronic wounds on the skin and caused by macrophages in protozoan parasites. It is an endemic disease in the southern and southeastern Anatolia region and is still an important public health problem in Turkey. Because of the civil war in Syria, immigrants to this region in the last 3 years have begun to more frequently present with this disease. The aim of this study was to draw attention to the dramatic increase in new cases with CL after the beginning of the civil war in Syria. In this retrospective study, we evaluated demographic, epidemiological, and clinical features of 110 patients diagnosed with cutaneous leishmaniasis who were admitted to the Department of Dermatology at Kahramanmaras Sutcu Imam University Faculty of Medicine between January 2011 and June 2014. A total of 110 patients included in the study; 50 (45%) were males, and 60 (55%) were females. The age range of the study group was 1-78 years, and the infection was more prevalent in the 0-20 year age group. Of these patients, 76 (69%) were Syrian refugees living in tent camps and 34 (31%) were Turkish citizens. The majority of the cases were diagnosed between October and December. Immigrations to endemic regions of Turkey from neighbouring countries where CL incidence is higher may lead to large increases in case numbers. In order to decrease the risk of exposure, housing conditions of the refugees must be improved, routine health controls must be performed, effective measures must be set in place for vector control, and infected individuals must be diagnosed and treated to prevent spread of the infection.\n\nConcurrent occurrence of human and equine West Nile virus infections in Central Anatolia, Turkey: the first evidence for circulation of lineage 1 viruses.\n\nPubMed\n\nOzkul, Aykut; Ergunay, Koray; Koysuren, Aydan; Alkan, Feray; Arsava, Ethem M; Tezcan, Seda; Emekdas, Gurol; Hacioglu, Sabri; Turan, Mahur; Us, Durdal\n\n2013-07-01\n\nWest Nile fever is an important zoonotic infection caused by West Nile virus (WNV), a member of the Flaviviridae. Previous serological data from Turkey suggest widespread WNV circulation. This report includes cases of human and equine WNV infections occurring concurrently, and manifesting as central nervous system infections, in two neighboring provinces of Central Anatolia, Turkey. A partial phylogenetic analysis of the causative virus is given for the first time. The cases were reported in February (horses) and March (human). Symptoms of the disease were similar in the two species, characterized by neurological manifestations suggesting meningoencephalitis. Real-time/nested PCRs and commercial immunoassays and a plaque reduction neutralization assay were employed for the detection of viral RNA and specific antibodies, respectively. WNV RNAs were detected in buffy coat (horses) and cerebrospinal fluid (human) samples. Partial nucleotide sequences of the E-gene coding region revealed that the strains are closely related to viruses of lineage 1, clade 1a. Accompanying equine serosurveillance demonstrated WNV-specific antibodies in 31.6% of the samples. This is the first report of acute WNV infections caused by lineage 1 strains from Turkey, in concordance with previous reports from some European and North African countries.

The GAP Project has been considered as a regional development projects through years, but the dimensions of sustainability, protection of environment and participatory have been attached to the master of the project in recent years. When the GAP Project is completed, the Upper Mesopotomia, the centers of many civilisation, will re-again its importance as it had in the ancient times, and will be alive a center of civilisation. Moreover, when the problem of water shortage and water supplies in the world for the future is kept in mind, the importance of Southeastern Anatolia's water supplies will be doubled. For this reason, the GAP Project, developed by depending on water and natural resources of the region, will have an important place in the world. The aim of this study is to introduce the region with rich natural resources and the GAP Project. For this reason, firstly, the natural potential of the region will be introduced. Second, The GAP Project will be presented in detailes. In the third stage, the projects being processed for protecting the natural sources and environment will be analyzed. In the last stage, strategies and policies to develop and to protect the natural resources of the region in short, mid, and long terms will be proposed.\n\nAksu-Dinar Fault System: Its bearing on the evolution of the Isparta Angle (SW Turkey)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKaymakci, Nuretdin; Ãzacar, Arda; Langereis, Cornelis G.; Ãzkaptan, Murat; GÃ¼lyÃ¼z, Erhan; van Hinsbergen, Douwe J. J.; Uzel, Bora; McPhee, Peter; SÃ¶zbilir, Hasan\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThe Isparta Angle is a triangular structure in SW Turkey with NE-SW trending western and NW-SE trending eastern flanks. Aksu Fault is located within the core of this structure and have been taken-up large E-W shortening and sinistral translation since the Late Miocene. It is an inherited structure which emplaced Antalya nappes over the BeydaÇ§larÄ± Platform during the late Eocene to Late Miocene and was reactivated by the Pliocene as a high angle reverse fault to accommodate the counter-clockwise rotation of BeydaÇ§larÄ± and SW Anatolia. On the other hand, the Dinar Fault is a normal fault with slight sinistral component has been active since Pliocene. These two structures are collinear and delimit areas with clockwise and counter-clockwise rotations. The areas to the north and east of these structures rotated clockwise while southern and western areas are rotated counter-clockwise. We claim that the Dinar-Aksu Fault System facilitate rotational deformation in the region as a scissor like mechanism about a pivot point north of Burdur. This mechanism resulted in the normal motion along the Dinar and reverse motion along the Aksu faults with combined sinistral translation component on both structures. We claim that the driving force for the motion of these faults and counter-clockwise rotation of the SW Anatolia seems to be slab-pull forces exerted by the east dipping Antalya Slab, a relic of Tethys oceanic lithosphere.

Ã.; Åafak, Ã.; GÃ¶kÃ§eoÄlu, C.\n\n2012-08-01\n\nMudurnu-GÃ¶ynÃ¼k basin of the Sakarya Zone in NW Anatolia comprises ca. 1500 m thick Paleocene-Eocene terrestrial to shallow marine succession overlying the Late Cretaceous deeper marine progradational fore-arc sediments. Formed in a foreland setting in relation to southerly situated Ä°zmir-Ankara suture zone, this terrestrial succession (regionally known as KÄ±zÄ±lÃ§ay group) comprises a thin (<200 m) oil shale-bearing lacustrine section with very good cyclic patterns that potentially serves the quantification of stratigraphy and enlightening the origin of cyclicities of various hierarchy. Our detailed facies analysis on three correlative measured sections showed that mudstone, oil shale and thinner limestone alternations characterize the relatively deeper part of the Eocene lake with probable marine intervention, while thicker limestone, coal, marl and occasional oil shale alternations typify the southern relatively freshwater shoal areas. These facies are frequently organized as meter-scale symmetric to asymmetric transgressive-regressive cycles. Spectral analysis of the mudstone beds and the cycles within the lacustrine succession strongly indicates the occurrence of full bands of Milankovitch with the shortest precession cycle (19 ka) at ca. 2.30 m. Our observations further revealed quite rhythmic thin couplets with estimated durations of 365-730 yr that might represent abrupt climatic changes during deposition. On the other hand, longer duration (ca. 1 Ma) of shoaling and deepening trends in the studied sections were attributed basically to varying subsidence due to tectonic loading in the southerly suture zone. Lastly, regarding the distribution of depositional environments we propose that the oil shale exploration activities should be carried out within a 20 km wide E-W running belt while the southern limits of this belt is more prolific for coal resources.\n\nEastern Anatolia Observatory (DAG): Recent developments and a prospective observing site for robotic telescopes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYesilyaprak, C.; Yerli, S.

This is a deformed crustal-scale sinistral strike-slip fault zone crossing the Bornova flysch and extending along the NW-boundary of the Menderes Massif by accommodating the differential deformation between the Cycladic and Menderes core complexes within the Aegean extensional system. Here we discuss the volcanic activity in Yamanlar and YuntdaÄÄ± fields that is closely related to the extensional tectonics of the Ä°zmir-BalÄ±kesir Transfer Zone and in the same time with the episodic core complex denudation of the Menderes Massif. This study documents two composite volcanoes (Yamanlar and YuntdaÄÄ±), whose present vent area is strongly eroded and cut by a variety of strike-slip and normal fault systems, the transcurrent NW-SE being the dominant one. The erosional remnants of the vent areas, resembling a shallow crater intrusive complex, illustrate the presence of numerous dykes or variably sized neck-like intrusions and lava flows, typically associated with hydrothermal alteration processes (propylitic and argillic). Such vent areas were observed in both the examined volcanic fields, having ~ 6 km in diameter and being much more eroded toward the south, along the NW-SE fault system. Lava flows and lava domes are sometimes associated with proximal block and ash flow deposits. In the cone-building association part, besides lava flows and remnants of lava domes, rare block and ash and pumice-rich pyroclastic flow deposits, as well as a series of debris-flow deposits, have been observed. The rocks display a porphyritic texture and contain various proportions of plagioclase, clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, amphibole, rare biotite and corroded quartz. The examined rocks fall at the limit between calc-alkaline to alkaline field, and plot predominantly in high-K andesite and dacite fields and one is rhyolite.

A total of 405 putative fox feces were collected from central Anatolia (186 specimens in 59 locations) and from Thrace (219 specimens in 114 locations). All samples were examined by the flotation and sieving method for taeniid eggs, and positive and putative samples were further analyzed by multiplex PCR. In seven samples from three locations in central Anatolia (5.1%) and in one (0.9%) from Thrace, E . multilocularis DNA was amplified, and this result was confirmed with another PCR specific for E. multilocularis . In addition, Echinococcus granulosus s.l. was found in two (0.5%) of the samples. Although alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is known as a serious zoonosis in Turkey, this is the first field study detecting E. multilocularis in collected fecal samples documenting the environmental contamination with eggs of this zoonotic parasite.\n\nPrevalence of Fabry Disease in Familial Mediterranean Fever Patients from Central Anatolia of Turkey.\n\nPubMed\n\nHuzmeli, Can; Candan, Ferhan; Alaygut, Demet; Bagci, Gokhan; Akkaya, Lale; Bagci, Binnur; Sozmen, Eser YÄ±ldÄ±rÄ±m; Kurtulgan, Hande Kucuk; Kayatas, Mansur\n\n2016-08-01\n\nFabry disease (FD) is a progressive, X-linked inherited disorder of glycosphingolipid metabolism due to deficient or absent lysosomal alpha-galactosidase A (AGALA) activity. FD and familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) have typical clinical similarities, and both diseases may progress to end-stage renal diseases. In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of FD in patients with FMF from Central Anatolia of Turkey. The study group consisted of 177 FMF patients, followed up by the Adult and Pediatric Nephrology Clinic of Cumhuriyet University Hospital. Screening for AGALA activity was performed by the dry blood spot method. Mutation analysis for GLA gene was carried out for patients having an AGALA enzyme activity value lower than the normal reference value. Low AGALA activity was detected in 23 (13Â %) patients. Heterozygous GLA gene mutation c.[937G>T] p.[D313Y] was detected in one female patient (0.56Â %). The patient was a 53-year-old female with proteinuria and who had undergone left nephrectomy; her glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by scintigraphy was found to be 70Â ml/min. She had M694V mutation and no clinical manifestation of FD. In our study, the prevalence rate of FD was found as 0.56Â % in FMF patients. The similarities between the symptoms of FMF and FD might lead to a diagnostic dilemma in physicians at countries where FMF is observed frequently. Although the prevalence of FD is rare, physicians should keep in mind that FD has an ambiguous symptomology pattern of FMF.\n\nOstracoda (Crustacea) association and a new species (Dolerocypris anatolia nov. sp.) from the Pliocene-Pleistocene AfÅin-Elbistan (Kahraman MaraÅ) Coal Basin of Turkey\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTunoÇ§lu, Cemal; Besbelli, Berk; Ertekin, Ä°brahim Kadri\n\n2012-04-01\n\nThe AfÅin-Elbistan Coal Basin, which is one of the largest and most important Pliocene-Pleistocene lignite basins of Turkey, is located in Eastern Anatolia. The basin was formed between two normal faults having NE-SW direction and these faults controlled both the sedimentation and the subsidence. The coal horizon of over 50 meters in thickness indicates the balance between the sedimentation and subsidence rates, and was preserved during peat deposition. Coals were generated in this extensive and shallow freshwater lake and evolved from the Pliocene to Pleistocene. Typical faunal and floral assemblages of this ancient AfÅin-Elbistan freshwater lake are Ostracoda, Mollusca (Gastropoda and Pelecypoda), spore-pollen and Characeae (gyrogonites). Eleven Cypridoidea species were identified from the investigation area. Eight of them are already known (Candona neglecta Sars, Candona iliensis Mandelstam, Candona aff. candida (MÃ¼ller), Pseudocandona compressa (Koch), Cyclocypris ovum (Jurine), Ilyocypris gibba (Ramdohr), Cypris pubera MÃ¼ller, Heterocypris salina (Brady)), whereas three belong to open nomenclature â Candona sp. and Eucypris sp.; Dolerocypris anatolia nov. sp. is proposed as a new species. Dolerocypris Kaufmann is one of the largest genera among the freshwater Ostracoda. It has a very wide geographical distribution. Representatives of this genus are actively swimming species found in shallow zones of freshwater lakes and reported from small grassy water bodies with megascopic plants. Dolerocypris anatolia nov. sp. is recorded from core samples of the Pliocene-Pleistocene AfÅin-Elbistan Coal Basin for the first time.\n\nInfant Feeding Practices in Central Anatolia, Turkey\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nSanlier, Nevin; Unusan, Nurhan\n\n2009-01-01\n\nInfant feeding decisions are some of the most important choices parents make.

In this study, the relationship between the thermal structure and hot spring outcomes is investigated. The residual aeromagnetic and gravity anomalies of the Inner East Anatolia, surveyed by the Mineral Research and Exploration (MTA) of Turkey, show complexities. The magnetic data were analyzed to produce Curie point depth estimates. The depth of magnetic dipole was calculated by azimuthally averaged power spectrum method for the whole area. The Curie point depth (CPD) map covering the Inner East Anatolia has been produced. The Curie point depths of the region between Sivas and Malatya vary from 16.5 to 18.7 km. Values of heat flow were calculated according to continental geotherm from the model. The heat flow values vary between 89 and 99 mW m-2. Heat flow values are incorporated with surface heat flow values. Gravity anomalies were modeled by means of a three-dimensional method. The deepest part of the basin (12-14 km), determined from the 3D model, are located below the settlement of Hafik and to the south of Zara towns. Two-dimensional cross sections produced from the basin depths, Curie values and MOHO depths. Based on the analysis of magnetic, gravity anomalies, thermal structures and geology, it seems likely that the hot springs are not related to rising asthenosphere, in the regions of shallow CPDs (â¼16.5 km), and mostly hot springs are related to faulting systems in Inner East Anatolia.\n\nExtensional Tectonics of SW Anatolia In relation to Slab Edge Processes in the Eastern Mediterranean\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKaymakci, N.; Ãzacar, A.; Langereis, C. G.; Ozkaptan, M.; KoÃ§, A.; Uzel, B.; Gulyuz, E.; SÃ¶zbilir, H.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe tectonics of SW Anatolia is expressed in terms of emplacement of Lycian Nappes during the Eocene to Middle Miocene and synconvergent extension as part of the Aegean-West Anatolian extensional tectonic regime. Recent studies identified that there is a tear in the northwards subducting African Oceanic lithosphere along the Pliny-Strabo Trenches (PST). Such tears are coined as Subduction Transform-Edge Propagator (STEP) faults developed high angle to trenches. Hypothetically, the evolution of a STEP fault is somewhat similar to strike-slip fault zones and resultant asymmetric role-back of the subducting slab leads to differential block rotations and back arc type extension on the overriding plate. Recent studies claimed that the tear along the PST propagated NE on-land and developed Fethiye-Burdur Fault/Shear Zone (FBFZ) in SW Turkey. We have conducted a rigorous paleomagnetic study containing more than 3000 samples collected from 88 locations and 11700 fault slip data sets from 198 locations distributed evenly all over SW Anatolia spanning from Middle Miocene to Late Pliocene to test if FBFZ ever existed. The results show that there is slight (20Â°) counter-clockwise rotation distributed uniformly almost whole SW Anatolia and there is no change in the rotation senses and amounts on either side of the FBFZ implying no differential rotation within the zone. Additionally, constructed paleostress configurations, along the so-called FBFZ and within the 300 km diameter of the proposed fault zone, indicated that almost all the faults that are parallel to subparallel to the zone are almost pure normal faults similar to earthquake focal mechanisms suggesting active extension in the region. It is important to note that we have not encountered any significant strike-slip motion parallel to so-called \"FBFZ\" to support presence and transcurrent nature of it. On the contrary, the region is dominated by extensional deformation and strike-slip components are observed only on the\n\nCenozoic extensional tectonics of the Western Anatolia Extended Terrane, Turkey\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nÃemen, I.; Catlos, E. J.; Gogus, O.; Diniz, E.; Hancer, M.\n\n2008-07-01\n\nThe Western Anatolia Extended Terrane in Turkey is located on the eastern side of the Aegean Extended Terrane and contains one of the largest metamorphic core complexes in the world, the Menderes massif. It has experienced a series of continental collisions from the Late Cretaceous to the Eocene during the formation of the Izmir-Ankara-Erzincan suture zone. Based our field work and monazite ages, we suggest that the north-directed postcollisional Cenozoic extension in the region is the product of three consecutive stages, triggered by three different mechanisms. The first stage was initiated about 30 Ma ago, in the Oligocene by the Orogenic Collapse the thermally weakened continental crust along the north-dipping Southwest Anatolian shear zone. The shear zone was formed as an extensional simple-shear zone with listric geometry at depth and exhibits predominantly normal-slip along its southwestern end. But, it becomes a high-angle oblique-slip shear zone along its northeastern termination. Evidence for the presence of the shear zone includes (1) the dominant top to the north-northeast shear sense indicators throughout the Menderes massif, such as stretching lineations trending N10E to N30E; and (2) a series of Oligocene extensional basins located adjacent to the shear zone that contain only carbonate and ophiolitic rock fragments, but no high grade metamorphic rock fragments. During this stage, erosion and extensional unroofing brought high-grade metamorphic rocks of the Central Menderes massif to the surface by the early Miocene. The second stage of the extension was triggered by subduction roll-back and associated back-arc extension in the early Miocene and produced the north-dipping AlaÅehir and the south-dipping BÃ¼yÃ¼k Menderes detachments of the central Menderes massif and the north-dipping Simav detachment of the northern Menderes massif. The detachments control the Miocene sedimentation in the AlaÅehir, BÃ¼yÃ¼k Menderes, and Simav grabens, containing high\n\nTectono-stratigraphy of the Orhaniye Basin, Turkey: Implications for collision chronology and Paleogene biogeography of central Anatolia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLicht, A.; Coster, P.; OcakoÄlu, F.; Campbell, C.; MÃ©tais, G.; Mulch, A.; Taylor, M.; Kappelman, John; Beard, K. Christopher\n\n2017-08-01\n\nLocated along the Ä°zmir-Ankara-Erzincan Suture (IAES), the Maastrichtian - Paleogene Orhaniye Basin has yielded a highly enigmatic -yet poorly dated- Paleogene mammal fauna, the endemic character of which has suggested high faunal provincialism associated with paleogeographic isolation of the Anatolian landmass during the early Cenozoic. Despite its biogeographic significance, the tectono-stratigraphic history of the Orhaniye Basin has been poorly documented. Here, we combine sedimentary, magnetostratigraphic, and geochronological data to infer the chronology and depositional history of the Orhaniye Basin. We then assess how our new data and interpretations for the Orhaniye Basin impact (1) the timing and mechanisms of seaway closure along the IAES and (2) the biogeographic evolution of Anatolia. Our results show that the Orhaniye Basin initially developed as a forearc basin during the Maastrichtian, before shifting to a retroarc foreland basin setting sometime between the early Paleocene and 44 Ma. This chronology supports a two-step scenario for the assemblage of the central Anatolian landmass, with incipient collision during the Paleocene - Early Eocene and final seaway retreat along the IAES during the earliest Late Eocene after the last marine incursion into the foreland basin. Our dating for the Orhaniye mammal fauna (44-43 Ma) indicates the persistence of faunal endemism in northern Anatolia until at least the late Lutetian despite the advanced stage of IAES closure. The tectonic evolution of dispersal corridors linking northern Anatolia with adjacent parts of Eurasia was not directly associated with IAES closure and consecutive uplifts, but rather with the build-up of continental bridges on the margins of Anatolia, in the Alpine and Tibetan-Himalayan orogens.\n\nMass change calculations of hydrothermal alterations within the volcanogenic metasediments hosted Cu-Pb (-Zn) mineralization at Halilar area, NW Turkey\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKiran Yildirim, Demet; Abdelnasser, Amr; Doner, Zeynep; Kumral, Mustafa\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThe Halilar Cu-Pb (-Zn) mineralization that is formed in the volcanogenic metasediments of Bagcagiz Formation at Balikesir province, NW Turkey, represents locally vein-type deposit as well as restricted to fault gouge zone directed NE-SW along with the lower boundary of Bagcagiz Formation and Duztarla granitic intrusion in the study area. Furthermore, This granite is traversed by numerous mineralized sheeted vein systems, which locally transgress into the surrounding metasediments. Therefore, this mineralization closely associated with intense hydrothermal alteration within brecciation, and quartz stockwork veining. The ore mineral assemblage includes chalcopyrite, galena, and some sphalerite with covellite and goethite formed during three phases of mineralization (pre-ore, main ore, and supergene) within an abundant gangue of quartz and calcite. The geologic and field relationships, petrographic and mineralogical studies reveal two alteration zones occurred with the Cu-Pb (-Zn) mineralization along the contact between the Bagcagiz Formation and Duztarla granite; pervasive phyllic alteration (quartz, sericite, and pyrite), and selective propylitic alteration (albite, calcite, epidote, sericite and/or chlorite). This work, by using the mass balance calculations, reports the mass/volume changes (gain and loss) of the chemical components of the hydrothermal alteration zones associated with Halilar Cu-Pb (-Zn) mineralization at Balikesir area (Turkey). It revealed that the phyllic alteration has enrichments of Si, Fe, K, Ba, and LOI with depletion of Mg, Ca, and Na reflect sericitization of alkali feldspar and destruction of ferromagnesian minerals. This zone has high Cu and Pb with Zn contents represents the main mineralized zone. On the other hand, the propylitic zone is characterized by addition of Ca, Na, K, Ti, P, and Ba with LOI and Cu (lower content) referring to the replacement of plagioclase and ferromagnesian minerals by albite, calcite, epidote, and sericite\n\nLate Paleogene terrestrial fauna and paleoenvironments in Eastern Anatolia: New insights from the KaÄÄ±zman-Tuzluca Basin\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMÃ©tais, GrÃ©goire; Sen, Sevket; SÃ¶zeri, Koray; PeignÃ©, StÃ©phane; Varol, Baki\n\n2015-08-01\n\nIn Eastern Turkey, relatively little work has been undertaken to characterize the sedimentologic and stratigraphical context of the KaÄÄ±zman-Tuzluca Basin until now. Extending across the Turkey-Armenian border, this basin documents the syn- and post-collisional evolution of Eastern Anatolia, resulting from the closure of the Neotethyan Seaways and the final collision of the Afro-Arabian and Eurasian plates. From detailed sedimentological and paleontological studies, we propose an interpretation of the lithology and depositional environment of the Late Paleogene Alhan Formation located on the western bank of the Aras River. This sequence of terrestrial clastics rests directly and unconformably onto the ophiolitic mÃ©lange, and it documents several depositional sequences deposited in alluvial plain and lacustrine environments. At this stage, the age of the Alhan Formation can only be calibrated by fossil evidence. Several stratigraphic levels yielding fossil data along the section have been identified, but these poor assemblages of fauna and flora hamper extensive comparisons with roughly contemporaneous localities of Central and Southern Asia. Carnivorous and ruminant mammal remains are reported for the first time from the supposed Late Oligocene GÃ¼ngÃ¶rmez Formation. The identified fossil mammal taxa reveal biogeographic affinities between Central Anatolia and southern Asia, thus suggesting dispersal between these areas during the Oligocene or earlier. Further studies of the fossil assemblages from the KaÄÄ±zman-Tuzluca Basin and other basins of Eastern Anatolia and lesser Caucasus regions are needed to better constrain the paleobiogeographic models.\n\nAn annotated catalogue of the mayfly fauna of Turkey (Insecta, Ephemeroptera)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSalur, Ali; Darilmaz, Mustafa Cemal; Bauernfeind, Ernst\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAbstract The mayfly fauna of Turkey was reviewed including all hitherto known distribution records together with references and a few new records.

ÃCC is formed from an Eo-Oligocene granite-gneiss-migmatite complex (GGMC) and an Early Miocene I-type granodioritic body (ÃG: ÃataldaÇ§ granodiorite) which were exhumed as a dome-shaped core complex in the footwall of a ring-shaped low-angle detachment zone (The ÃataldaÇ§ Detachment Fault Zone; ÃDFZ) in the Early Miocene. New U-Pb zircon (LA-ICPMS) and monazite ages of GGMC yielded magmatic ages of 33.8 and 30.1 Ma (Latest Eocene-Early Oligocene). 40Ar/39Ar muscovite, biotite and K-feldspar from the GGMC yielded the deformation age span 21.38Â±0,05 Ma and 20.81Â±0.04 Ma, which is also the emplacement age (20.84Â±0.13 Ma and 21.6Â±0.04 Ma) of ÃG. ÃDFZ is responsible for mainly top-to-the-north sense kinematic processes. The microstructural features of quartz, feldspar and mica indicate that the ÃCC has undergone continuous deformations during its cooling, from submagmatic to cataclastic conditions. Five microstructural grades have been classified under ductile (DZ) and ductile-to-brittle shear zone (SZ), according to the estimated deformation temperature and intensity of the strain. Microcline twinning, marginally replacement myrmekite and flame-perthite are predominant features for feldspar while chessboard extinction, grain boundary migration and subgrain rotation recrystallization is common for quartz in the DZ which has a deformation temperature range of >600Â°C to 400Â°C. Grain size reduction is an important factor for the ductile to brittle shear zone (SZ). Feldspar is represented by bulging recrystallization (BLG), feldspar-fish and domino-type microfracture/microfaulting and quartz show more elongated structures such as ribbons with high aspect ratios. Mineral-fish (muscovite, biotite and feldspar) structures indicate a temperature\n\nMineralogy and sedimentology of the Miocene GÃ¶cenoluk borate deposit, KÄ±rka district, western Anatolia, Turkey\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGarcÃ­a-Veigas, Javier; HelvacÄ±, Cahit\n\n2013-05-01\n\nThe Miocene boratiferous district of KÄ±rka, in western Anatolia (Turkey), is the most important Na-borate (borax) resource in the world. Two separate deposits in the KÄ±rka district are located near the villages of SarÄ±kaya and GÃ¶cenoluk (EskiÅehir Province). Borax is intensively exploited in open-pit mines in the SarÄ±kaya deposit while only small quarries of colemanite are known in the GÃ¶cenoluk deposit. Recent exploratory drilling in the GÃ¶cenoluk area intersected a thick succession of dolostones, tuffs and three borate-bearing units (Lower, Intermediate and Upper Borate Units). In them, the most abundant borate mineral is ulexite (Ca-Na-borate) passing at depth to probertite. Borax (Na-borate) is only present in the Intermediate Borate Unit. Minor amounts of colemanite (Ca-borate) and hydroboracite (Ca-Mg-borate) occur at the base, and/or top, of each mineralized unit. Pyroclastic layers within the borate units show intense alteration by alkaline, boron-bearing waters and formation of diagenetic clay minerals (smectites), zeolites (analcime) and borosilicates (searlesite). The GÃ¶cenoluk succession is interpreted as a shallow, ephemeral, alkaline lake deposit in which carbonates formed as stromatolites and travertines. Borate precipitation in the GÃ¶cenoluk area took place interstitially within muddy and carbonate sediments in a lateral progression from marginal Ca-borates towards Na-Ca-borates and rarely to Na-borates in the center of the lake. Authigenic silicate mineral distribution shows parallel changes toward the center of the lake that reflect increasing pH gradient.\n\nSeismicity and Seismotectonic Properties of The SultandaÄÄ± Fault Zone (Afyonkarahisar-Konya): Western Anatolia,Turkey\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKalafat, D.; Gunes, Y.; Kekovali, K.; Kara, M.; Gorgun, E.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nn this study we investigated seismicity and source characteristics of the SultandaÄÄ± Fault Zone (SFZ). As known Western Anatolia is one of the most important seismically active region in Turkey. The relative movement of the African-Arabian plates, it causes the Anatolian Plate to movement to the west-Southwest direction 2.5 cm per year and this result provides N-S direction with extensional regime in the recent tectonic. In this study, especially with the assessment of seismic activity occurring in Afyon and around between 200-2002 years, we have been evaluated to date with seismic activity as well as fault mechanism solution. We analyzed recent seismicity and distribution of earthquakes in this region. In the last century, 3 important earthquakes occurred in the SultandaÄÄ± Fault zone (Afyon-AkÅehir Graben), this result shown it was seismic active and broken fault segments caused stress balance in the region and it caused to occur with short intervals of earthquakes in 2000 and 2002, triggering each other. The scope of this tudy, we installed new BB stations in the region and we have been done of the fault plane solutions for important earthquakes. The focal mechanisms clearly exhibit the activation of a NE-SW trending normal faulting system along the SFZ region. The results of stress analysis showed that the effective current tectonic evolution of normal faulting in this region.

Structural evidence from the Ivriz Detachment, southern central Turkey\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGÃ¼rer, Derya; Plunder, Alexis; Kirst, Frederik; Corfu, Fernando; Schmid, Stefan M.; van Hinsbergen, Douwe J. J.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nCentral Anatolia exposes previously buried and metamorphosed, continent-derived rocks - the KÄ±rÅehir and Afyon zones - now covering an area of â¼300 Ã 400 km. So far, the exhumation history of these rocks has been poorly constrained. We show for the first time that the major, >120 km long, top-NE 'Ivriz' Detachment controlled the exhumation of the HP/LT metamorphic Afyon Zone in southern Central Anatolia. We date its activity at between the latest Cretaceous and early Eocene times. Combined with previously documented isolated extensional detachments found in the KÄ±rÅehir Block, our results suggest that a major province governed by extensional exhumation was active throughout Central Anatolia between â¼80 and â¼48 Ma. Although similar in dimension to the Aegean extensional province to the east, the Central Anatolian extensional province is considerably older and was controlled by a different extension direction. From this, we infer that the African slab(s) that subducted below Anatolia must have rolled back relative to the Aegean slab since at least the latest Cretaceous, suggesting that these regions were underlain by a segmented slab. Whether or not these early segments already corresponded to the modern Aegean, Antalya, and Cyprus slab segments remains open for debate, but slab segmentation must have occurred much earlier than previously thought.\n\nDetermination of Bedrock Variations and S-wave Velocity Structure in the NW part of Turkey for Earthquake Hazard Mitigation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOzel, A.

K.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nTekirdag region (NW Turkey) is quite close to the North Anatolian Fault which is capable of producing a large earthquake. Therefore, earthquake hazard mitigation studies are important for the urban areas close to the major faults. From this point of view, integration of different geophysical methods has important role for theãstudy of seismic hazard problems including seismotectonic zoning. On the other hand, geological mapping and determining the subsurface structure, which is a key to assist management of new developedãareas, conversion of current urban areas or assessment of urban geological hazards can be performed by integrated geophysical methods. This study has been performed in the frame of a national project, which is a complimentary project of the cooperative project between Turkey and Japan (JICA&JST), named as \"Earthquake and Tsunami Disaster Mitigation in the Marmara Region and Disaster Education\". With this principal aim, this study is focused on Tekirdag and its surrounding region (NW of Turkey) where some uncertainties in subsurface knowledge (maps of bedrock depth, thickness of quaternary sediments, basin geometry and seismic velocity structure,) need to be resolved. Several geophysical methods (microgravity, magnetic and single station and array microtremor measurements) are applied and the results are evaluated to characterize lithological changes in the region. Array microtremor measurements with several radiuses are taken in 30 locations and 1D-velocity structures of S-waves are determined by the inversion of phase velocities of surface waves, and the results of 1D structures are verified by theoretical Rayleigh wave modelling. Following the array measurements, single-station microtremor measurements are implemented at 75 locations to determine the predominant frequency distribution. The predominant frequencies in the region range from 0.5 Hz to 8 Hz in study area. On the other hand, microgravity and magnetic measurements are performed on\n\nInvestigation of Echinococcus multilocularis in Environmental Definitive Host Feces in the Asian and the European Parts of Turkey\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGÃ¼rler, Ali TÃ¼may; Gori, Francesca; BÃ¶lÃ¼kbasÂ¸, Cenk Soner; Umur, Åinasi; AÃ§Ä±cÄ±, Mustafa; Deplazes, Peter\n\n2018-01-01\n\nA study was carried out to investigate the presence of Echinococcus multilocularis in red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in two regions of Turkeyâcentral Anatolia (in Asia Minor) and Thrace (in the European part of Turkey). A total of 405 putative fox feces were collected from central Anatolia (186 specimens in 59 locations) and from Thrace (219 specimens in 114 locations). All samples were examined by the flotation and sieving method for taeniid eggs, and positive and putative samples were further analyzed by multiplex PCR. In seven samples from three locations in central Anatolia (5.1%) and in one (0.9%) from Thrace, E. multilocularis DNA was amplified, and this result was confirmed with another PCR specific for E. multilocularis. In addition, Echinococcus granulosus s.l. was found in two (0.5%) of the samples. Although alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is known as a serious zoonosis in Turkey, this is the first field study detecting E. multilocularis in collected fecal samples documenting the environmental contamination with eggs of this zoonotic parasite.

Wouldn't you like to witness this magnificient event in the mystic ambiance of central Anatolia which offers its guests Turkish hospitality and a lot of hystorical examples of paganism, Christianity and Islam. Among the countries from which the eclipse will be visible , Turkey seems to be one of the most suitable countries in terms of its climate and observational facilities. Kandilli Observatory and the Earthquake Research Institute has arranged field work on the eclipse path to determine the suitable points for the observations. The shadow of the moon will be first seen from the Black Sea coast at 14:20 L.T. It will then pass through central Anatolia and will leave Turkey form south-east at 14:42 L.T. Official observational sites are given in the following table. These sites will have catering, toilet, and guidance facilities.

Nutrients, physical properties including moisture, ash, dry matter, protein, fatty oil and essential oil content, along with Al, Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Na, Ni, Pb, Zn and characteristics of fruit sizes and fatty acid compositions of both plants were determined from ripe fruits. The free fatty acid content was determined in the fruit oil, and the main fatty acids of sumac and terebinth were identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. They included oleic, linoleic, palmitic and stearic acids in a ra"
