        "text": "Some boxes like notifications that an article may be merged or split might not be something a passing user would want to know. Perhaps having those contained within a pre collapsed box would be better. Or maybe a generic notification that there are administrative (or something) things to be aware of and going to the article talk page gives more information.\n\n2600:6C4E:1200:1E85:B409:AC04:8255:CFA1 (talk)\n\nEvery reader is a potential editor, and if they don't know what might need fixing in an article, they can't do it. 331dot (talk)\n\nAlso, this would be in violation of MOS:COLLAPSE. Collapsed content can often be harder to access for readers on mobile devices and particularly on screen readers. Joseph2302 (talk)\n\nHello all. Myself and User:Ser Amantio di Nicolao have been adding 'Use ... English' maintenance templates (e.g. Template:Use British English) to articles that deserve them en masse utilising AutoWikiBrowser, however another admin has suggested that we gain consensus before continuing doing this. I believe the argument against was that it's [neither] necessary or desirable to place that tag on tens of thousands of articles (see this short discussion). A bot was suggested to carry out this purpose, however I believe that the nature of these tags, i.e. garnering context from the article itself, requires a human edit. Neither of us see anything undesirable about adding this maintenance template per se, however we both paused our efforts until some sort of discussion had been had. Any comments on this would be most welcome. Thank you and best wishes. SɱαɾƚყPαɳƚʂ22 (Ⓣⓐⓛⓚ)\n\nI would tend to agree that these edits are unnecessary, and making thousands of unnecessary edits is undesirable. Unless there has been some kind of editing history on a particular article that would suggest this template is needed, then it is probably better not to add it. PS, I note that it seems to be classified as a maintenance template, but it really is not a maintenance template because no maintenance is required on these articles. — Martin (MSGJ · talk)\n\nTo be frank, I think the problem is with the template. What purpose does the template serve? Perhaps the idea is so discrepancies like a {{Use British English}} article containing \"color\" (not \"colour\") are automatically identified, but I'm not convinced that this is worth the wikitext it takes up at the top of the page. There must be a better way to do this. I can't really fault the editors here for adding a tag to applicable articles, but I don't think their actions are useful. — Bilorv (talk)\n\nI see the value in having an explicit statement that a given variety of English is used on an article when it is not obvious which should be used (Seattle and Tony Blair are obvious, Acre isn't), especially if the article has had to be actively cleaned up from multiple varieties. I think bots can (or at least would have the capability to) standardise in some cases, e.g. adding or removing the spell=us parameter from {{convert}}. Thryduulf (talk)\n\nOver half the audience won’t care either way, as they are neither British nor American….. ;) —TheDJ (talk • contribs)\n\nIf only there were a way to make everyone happy. There could be a setting in your preferences asking what your preferred ENGVAR is and words like col(o|ou)r, defen(se|ce), etc. were templated to conform to your ENGVAR regardless of the topic's ENGVAR. Number templates could default to lakh and crore instead of thousands and millions for our Indian readers. To me, that is more useful than slapping {{Use British English}} on top of a page. –Fredddie™\n\nNot a bad idea, but only if it could be done via some widget or script in your browser, and not if it's visible in the Wikicode, which would pollute the code in a way making it harder to maintain, and likely would have other knock-on effects. Mathglot (talk)\n\nBecause of things like torch/flaming torch/flashlight, or truck/bogie, it's difficult to do an automated straight substitution without additional markup in the source text in some fashion. Variations like \"licence/license\" are tricky too, since the spelling depends on whether or not the word is a noun or verb. isaacl (talk)\n\nYears ago we had a system (date preferences) in which you could set the format in which dates would be shown in your preferences. It required that all dates be wikilinked in a specific pattern. It was deprecated because it was clumsy, and only worked if you were logged in. Remember, users who are not logged in (most of our readers) do not have preferences available. Donald Albury\n\nIf the only downside is that \"it doesn't work for IP users\", then I think that's not a major problem. IP users already miss out on all sorts of benefits, and it's by their own choice. If they are \"forced\" to view articles in whatever the default English is, I would say that is extremely minor inconvenience. Specifically: implementing Fred's idea would not make any IP user's viewing experience worse than it is now; it would only improve the experience of other users. I don't see a downside to this. Mathglot (talk)\n\nIt works perfectly on the Chinese Wikipedia, where you do not need to log in to switch between simplified and traditional Chinese (and a few sub-varieties). —Kusma (talk)\n\nI thought it was deprecated because of MOS:OL and, on the developer side, concerns over cache-splitting. Anomie⚔\n\nDisagree A number of articles have popped up on my Watchlist, with edit summaries saying, \"Use Ghanaian English\". Now, I'm not surprised that Ghana has its own variety of English, but honestly, that notice on the page does only one thing wrt my editing at the article: it discourages it, and waves me off, since I haven't a clue about Ghanian English, and even if it's pretty close to Commonwealth or some other English, as soon as I have it under my belt, then the next article that hits my list is going to say, \"Use Liberian English\", and now I'm going to have to start using that? I've got about all I can handle dealing with US, UK, OZ, NZ, Canadian, and Oxford English, and I'm willing to go out on a limb once in a while for a worthy article in Caribbean or maybe Nigerian English. But as for articles in Ghanaian English and Liberian English and Pitcairn English and all the rest, count me out; someone else can go edit those articles in that case; it's more effort than I'm willing to offer. Mathglot (talk) 01:54, 7 February 2023 (UTC) Clarifying: agreeing with the STOP sign from the admin; disagreeing with placing any more of these. Place the bot in reverse, and have it undo all the ones it did. Mathglot (talk)\n\nLol, I thought that was a joke but {{Use Ghanaian English}} is real and is used in 2402 pages, for example Accra added on 29 January 2023. That is beyond crazy. I would like the wikitext to tell me whether to use color or colour (or whether to revert an edit that changed that spelling), but adding stuff like Use Ghanaian English has no point beyond increasing one's edit count. Johnuniq (talk)\n\nNot a joke. Most of them have scrolled off my Watchlist but I found this recent one at Kwame Nkrumah. Worse, are these two recent examples:\n\nrev. 1136291731 at Accra, with the edit summary, \"Use Nigerian English\" (Accra is the capital of Ghana), and\n\nrev. 1136292968 at Cape Coast, with the edit summary, \"Use Nigerian English\" (Cape Coast is a major port in Ghana).\n\nThat's just carelessness. Can someone help me set up an AWB run, so I can place one Trout on Ser Amantio's Talk page for each incorrect edit summary, and a big, golden mega-trout for starting this without consensus? That could be eight thousand trouts, but it's healthy protein, and could help the global supply. Mathglot (talk)\n\nI've long wished that the people who have the idea that every country in the world needs to be flagged for its own variety of English would include in these templates' documentation an explanation as to how exactly those varieties actually do vary from American or Commonwealth English when written in an encyclopedic register. I see no need to care about varieties that differ only in slang, or in colloquial registers, or in spoken pronunciation (at least until \"SpeakGPT\" exists to make natural-sounding spoken versions of articles in an appropriate accent), or the like. Anomie⚔\n\nThe issue is that documenting all of the differences would be tedious and no one is interested in doing the work (true for documentation in general). Most of the time this probably isn't a big deal if someone puts \"color\" or \"lorry\" into an Australian article there are enough Australian editors that they will be converted to \"colour\" and \"truck\" with no documentation needed; there's probably also enough Kiwis around that instances fjord will be converted to fiord without us needing to document that peculiarity of NZ English anywhere. On the other hand I'd be surprised if we had even a handful of regular Ghanian editors so without documentation changes will happen only slowly.\n\nIt's also best to remember that some national varieties of English are tagged separately solely to be polite. There's no functional difference between British and Irish English when written in an encyclopedic register; Likewise for Indian and Pakistani English, but the shitstorm that would ensue from trying to replace all transclsuions of the Irish template with the British one, or the Pakistani one with the Indian one far outweighs any benefit. As a practical matter tools can be instructed to treat the two identically, and it's actually easier for new editors to manually tag correctly per TIES when tag names directly match country names anyway. 74.73.224.126 (talk)\n\nI'm not sure that even that isn't a solution in search of a problem. Surely it's better to have sourced content with Us and Zs in incongruous places than to not have the content at all? HJ Mitchell | Penny for your thoughts?\n\nAgree, in fact I suspect most pages are not fully MoS compliant, and in general MoS issues are pretty far down the priority list of editorial standards. 74.73.224.126 (talk)\n\nI like my articles to look pretty and be neatly formatted and consistent throughout. But most of all I like them to be informative. HJ Mitchell | Penny for your thoughts?\n\nDisagree, not seeing what the value of these templates is. The dmy and mdy templates actually have purpose, interacting with the citation templates. The documentation of Template:Use British English says that all it does is add a category, in which case all it does is duplicate the talkpage notices (themselves not always a great use of screen space). CMD (talk)\n\nPlaying Devil's advocate here a bit: there is a legit value, imho, in having some of them, some of the time: for cases where MOS:TIES doesn't apply but MOS:RETAIN does apply, it's useful to have had someone else go through the article history before me and figure out what the stable usage was at the beginning or has been up till now, so I don't have to figure it out for myself for every article. I wonder if those templates, in articles where there's consensus that they really do help, would work better in an WP:EDITNOTICE, than as a inline template in the article? We don't really need to know what version of English it is, unless we decide to edit it. Mathglot (talk)\n\nThere is some value some of the time, but that is already provided for by the talkpage templates (which are indeed sometimes put in edit notices). CMD (talk)\n\nI think these are mostly make-work edits and aren't helping editors. Unless a page has had a recurring issue that has since been resolved about dialects this isn't helping editors - and may actively discourage casual editors who should be most concerned with adding relevant verifiable content, not which spelling their prose used. Further, most any massive templating shouldn't be done except by a bot - it just annoys watchers and recent change patrollers. — xaosflux Talk\n\nDeciding on a variant of English to use, and harmonizing a whole article onto it, is good practice when you're trying to bring an article to GA or FA class, but I don't see the point of doing it en-masse. As a side note, while I have no interest in telling anyone what to do, I just don't understand why so much of Wikipedia has turned into menial busywork. Why is it that the vast majority of articles I come across are substantially unchanged from ~2010-2013, save from Wikignoming? Surely article expansion is more rewarding? DFlhb (talk)\n\nExactly. Ppl seem very busy 'standardizing' things to a level that is never achievable (for long) in a public editing model by thousands of (imperfect and untrained) people. It is better to accept certain imperfections and mistakes of the users. It is part of what makes it a wiki. —TheDJ (talk • contribs)\n\nDisagree, per Xaosflux. I can sympathise with the intent, but mass changes can very easily become disruptive and there's no pressing need that justifies it in this circumstance. XAM2175 (T)\n\nNo mass addition, although the templates can be useful on a case-by-case basis. Like Mathglot above, if I see \"Ghanaian English\" I would be quite reticent about touching the article. And FWIW, our Indian articles are generally dreadful, not just for lack of sourcing, but because of the abysmal strings of characters which I understand are supposed to pass for \"Indian English\". I think the weird capitalisations are mistakes, but they're so predominantly \"wrong\" (to my USian eyes), that I wonder if there's not actually a system. The grammar, meanwhile, just seems sloppy. Summary: templates are useful, added individually and selectively, but would be even more useful if, as above, there were some clue about what they mean. Stop adding these by bot. — JohnFromPinckney (talk / edits)\n\nWe have a long article on Indian English, which in most cases is like British English, but this is a second language to most users, and exists in several registers. Academic Indian prose is virtually the same as British, or intended to be so, but most of our Indian editors aren't academics, and lean towards the colourful Indian form of journalese, just as huge numbers of American editors do towards their local version. Johnbod (talk)\n\nNo mass addition. Whilst I did appreciate {{Use British English}} being added to 5-10 articles I started (as I usually add them myself), I don't see a general need to add them, particularly when it's not clear to the majority of people what the differences between some of these are. E.g. Despite being English, I'm not really sure what the differences between British, Indian, South African English would be (other than Indian articles might use lakh/crore). Joseph2302 (talk)\n\n@Joseph2302: a tiny point but I believe that you shouldn't use lakh/crore per MOS:COMMONALITY, the idea being (correct me if I'm wrong) that an Indian reader will still understand \"100 million\" but a non-Indian reader is unlikely to be familiar with \"10 crore\". — Bilorv (talk)\n\nNo mass addition, especially for the more specific variants. I agree with Xaosflux's comments about these are mostly make-work edits and aren't helping editors and may actively discourage casual editors who should be most concerned with adding relevant verifiable content, not which spelling their prose used. Among other things, some of these templates such as {{Use Trinidad and Tobago English}} strike me as not helpful - our article on Trinidadian and Tobagonian English seems to be describing it as essentially a dialect more than a standard variety. I don't think anyone would consider {{Use Southern American English}} to be useful, and several of these strike me as a similar level of over categorization. Hog Farm Talk\n\nOppose Far too nuanced a matter to use any mass addition method. --Jayron32\n\nInsufficient data How is the decision made as to which language template is added?? · · · Peter Southwood (talk):\n\nNo mass addition because as per Mathglot the templates run a risk of deterring editors who feel they can't write Pakistani English, so their use should be kept to an absolute minimum. They should only be used to relay the result of discussion where there has been disagreement and it's been resolved. Elemimele (talk)\n\nHi dear Wikipedians!\n\nI am a car fanatic and I have a request. Please can you make some car manufacturer logos available for use on different Wiki languages when creating articles:\n\nCadillac: Cadillac_(logo).svg\n\nChevrolet: Chevrolet_(logo).svg\n\nDonkervoort: Donkervoort_1.jpg\n\nLancia:\n\nLancia_logo_2022.png\n\nLand Rover:\n\nLandRover.svg\n\nSince these logos are the best logos for each of these companies and are with the highest quality and when an user of a different Wiki wants to create an article about these car manufacturers, which is missing on that Wiki and wants to use these logos, can't use them.\n\nThanks FLORIKRUJA (talk)\n\nFLORIKRUJA Non-free images cannot be used cross-wiki, but nothing is stopping you from uploading a local copy if the home wiki allows non-free media. Der Wohltemperierte Fuchs talk\n\nWhat you are proposing would be a violation of copyright laws. We are not about to leave ourselves open to lawsuits like that for cross-platform convenience. As Der Fuchs points out, different language Wikipedias have different rules about non-free media use in certain limited circumstances. --Orange Mike | Talk\n\nAlso, WP is not for advertising. YTKJ (talk)\n\nThe reason copyrighted media cannot be uploaded cross-wiki, is that their use is subject to local laws, not American law. For example, \"fair-use\" provisions don't exist in many countries. On the French Wikipedia, copyrighted logos can be used, but copyrighted screenshots are illegal with no exception (even low-resolution). There may be jurisdictions where the use of copyrighted logos is illegal too. That's why these files are local to each language-specific Wikipedia. DFlhb (talk)\n\nI think that’s just covered by fair use Dronebogus (talk)\n\nI wonder whether it is worth making a proposal for WikiProjects to make their assessments of list articles more specific? If one goes to the article \"List of pastries\", one can see it was rated \"List class\" by WikiProject Food and Drink. This tells us WHAT this article is, but does not tell us its quality. My proposal is to introduce the following ranking for Wikipedia lists:\n\nQ. Contains Questionable Entries Start class. Needs to be more comprehensive C. Reasonably comprehensive and accurate, but still requires more work B. A very good list A. Contains accurate information, covers a good range of entries and provides parameters for information that would not normally be accessible from categories or articles.\n\nI shall look forward to hearing thoughts on this proposal. YTKJ (talk)\n\nWP:MHA#SCALE has something like this already. The reason it's not more widely adopted is probably because other WikiProjects don't see the need and/or there's not enough interest. —pythoncoder (talk | contribs)\n\nI'd strongly support adopting the MILHIST List ratings wholesale (and frankly, that's more likely to obtain consensus than this proposal; I wish this had been brought up at WP:VPI first, to obtain consensus on which list-ratings to propose).\n\nMILHIST's approach just makes far more sense: lists and articles are both subject to the same flaws (sourcing, completeness, comprehensiveness, writing quality), so there's little reason to only have two assessment grades for lists. DFlhb (talk)\n\nI can second this proposal. Now that we are working on globalising ratings, we should definitely consider ways to standardise as many quality ratings as possible. —CX Zoom[he/him] (let's talk • {C•X})\n\nThank you User:pythoncoder. I see that there are some lists, such as List of songs recorded by Adele or List of works by Dorothy L. Sayers that have been give the distinction of being \"Featured Lists\". This is a step in the direction of what I am proposing, but I wondered whether other lists should also be ranked. This might help WikiProjects see which lists require more work. YTKJ (talk)\n\nEarlier this year, I opened up a discussion at the Idea Lab to create buttons that would automatically skip to the top or bottom of a page if you pressed them. It seemed that it should be made into a preference based on the discussion, and I think that this should now be made into a formal proposal, and that is to create a preference for skipping to the top/bottom buttons. Should this be made into a preference? ‍ ‍ Helloheart ‍ ‍\n\n@Helloheart we can't just \"create a preference\". We can make an opt-in gadget, but step one is writing it. Good news: you (or anyone) can start on that now as a userscript. Once it is ready, we can look in to making a test gadget run with it. — xaosflux Talk\n\nNote, there are several \"to top\" and \"to bottom\" scripts you can try already listed at Wikipedia:User scripts/List. — xaosflux Talk\n\nOk, so for me, there's a lot not to like about the new layout.\n\nBut someone else can start that eventual RfC : )\n\nI just want to focus on one very specific thing: the talk link being moved to a drop down.\n\nHiding the talk link is a very very bad idea.\n\nWe operate on the consensus model here.\n\nHiding the talk link just reinforces that edit-warring is the way to go.\n\nAnd no, I really don't care what some off-site discussion was - so I don't need to hear an WMF employee breezily tell me that a talk page link was determined to not be important on Wikipedia. I'm happy to engage in discussion, but don't blow us off by referring elsewhere as if this project does not matter please. (As an aside, and this goes far beyond this simple RfC - But just thought I'd mention that while I respect the WMF in general - I think it's very important - but I'm really not happy about how things seem to be being pushed through, with fewer and fewer discussions being allowed to be \"open\" for anyone to participate.)\n\nAnyway, if we weigh importance, I think it's easy to agree that the talk link is more important than the watchlist link. So if space really is the issue argued, then swap them. Or maybe combine \"alerts\" and \"notices\" to save space. Or whatever other ideas people may have.\n\nWhatever the case, un-hide the talk link. - jc37\n\nRfC Discussion\n\n@Jc37, I'm not sure what you mean. The talk page link is just below the page title. — Qwerfjkltalk\n\nI think they mean the link to their own user talk page, which is indeed now in a dropdown (unless you have new talk page messages, in which case it's more prominent like before). Matma Rex talk\n\n@Matma Rex, I see. But people still get the big yellow notification that they have messages, so I don't see the problem. — Qwerfjkltalk\n\nanything - anything that reduces the visibility and/or ease of accessing the talk page is a bad idea. We want people to discuss. We want people to respond to talk page concerns about their editing. Not to get frustrated because they can't find the link, and thus not engage. There are innumerable reasons that hiding the talk page link is really bad. Even just from the optics of suggesting that talk pages are uninportant. I understand that this may seem an innocuous change for some, but when I consider years - decades - worth of dispute resolution, among many other things, this just really really seems an incredibly bad idea.- jc37\n\n@Jc37, so your problem is that people might get talk page message, dismiss that notification, and then not know how to find their user talk page and respond? — Qwerfjkltalk\n\nOne, of several. Anything we can do to get people using talk pages, the better. We've repeatedly seen that initial talk page usage helps bridge the learning curve gap for people to turn into regular editors. It's part of why we encourage the community aspect of Wikipedia. Learning how to thread discussions on a talk page can lead to being confortable to add to lists, to add references, and just merely feeling comfortable to edit a paragraph on a page. These are called \"gateways\" for a reason. - jc37\n\nMost newcomers are using the Reply button, so they don't have to count colons any longer. The learning curve is essentially flat.\n\nThe Editing team, as a result of mw:Talk pages consultation 2019, considered ways to make talk pages more visible, but it's tricky, and I don't think that they got very far. You don't want the \"Talk\" tab at the top to be more prominent than the article tab. You also don't want it to be more prominent than the Edit button. So at best, it's in third place. In terms of your own User_talk: page specifically, I think that Growth's Newcomer homepage work has made some difference there. Whatamidoing (WMF) (talk)\n\nI appreciate all that. I do. But all I need do is look at the default signature for editors to see that Wikipedia sees the value of a talk page link. (And yes, I'm aware that mine isn't there - user pages are important too : )\n\nBut anyway, if it's in third place, then watchlists decidedly aren't. And while I may have done some looking around to find out the difference between notices and alerts, I doubt the average person would know, or care.\n\ntried and failed doesn't = push through anyway. I understand the idea of the perfect is the enemy of the good - Wikipedia is a work in progress after all. but something like this is different, we're being asked to swallow the watermelon whole, with no changebacks allwed due to fait accompli.\" what's done is done\" and all that.\n\nI'm not merely complaining to the air, I've actually proposed some suggestions and welcome others. (not adding \"support/oppose\" sections was intentional). So if you have any ideas for a way forward, I'd be happy to hear them. - jc37\n\nI don't think that I want to get in the middle of whether the talk page or the watchlist is the more important thing to show. I imagine that most editors want both.\n\nBut now I'm not sure that we're talking about the same thing. At the top of an article, volunteer-me sees these options:\n\nArticle – Talk – Read – Edit – Edit source – View history – Watchlist star – More menu – Twinkle menu\n\nThis is what I see in the new Vector 2022. Are you seeing something different? Are you not seeing the \"Talk\" item right next to \"Article\"? Whatamidoing (WMF) (talk)\n\n@Whatamidoing: I think Jc37 is referring to one's personal user talk page ( ), which is in the dropdown menu for , rather than a page's talk page ( ). —Tenryuu 🐲 ( 💬 • 📝 )\n\nYou also don't want it to be more prominent than the Edit button. Yes I do. Levivich (talk)\n\nI think that in the end, anything that improves or makes more efficient the talk page in a non-obnoxious manner should be implemented. In particular, I believe that the talk page is one of the biggest catalysts for recruiting new editors, and if they see a place where not only their voice matters but they can participate in a discussion with consequences they can see, I think we've done a good job at recruiting a new editor. Put another way, to know that the change you helped to support 10 years ago can still be found on the website is, for lack of a better term, a magical feeling. InvadingInvader (userpage, talk)\n\nVery few editors make their first edit on a talk page. Whatamidoing (WMF) (talk)\n\nLet editors have the option to unhide the Contributions link, too. Some1 (talk)\n\n@Some1 and @Anarchyte - see Wikipedia:Village_pump_(technical)#Customizing_button_shortcuts_in_top-right_menu_area? for a userscript an editor can use to add contributions to the page top. — xaosflux Talk\n\nThe userscript is better than nothing I guess, thanks xaosflux! Some1 (talk)\n\nSupport - adding the ability to choose which buttons appear outside of the user dropdown menu would be a drastic improvement. Anarchyte (talk)\n\nThis RFC is a bit misleading in the title, \"Talk\" in general is not in any menu, this is only about the link to someone's own usertalk page. This is also something that is skin-wide, so would really need to be changed upstream. I don't see this as severely breaking the consensus building model, as most consensus building discussions don't take place on personal user talks, but on article talks or project pages, both of which are already accessible. — xaosflux Talk\n\nThe title is: \"restore \"talk\" from drop down\" - that is exactly what this is about. the talk link in the drop down. Nothing there misleading at all. - jc37\n\nFWIW, started talking about maybe making a gadget for this (see Wikipedia:Village_pump_(technical)#Customizing_button_shortcuts_in_top-right_menu_area?).

Also support restoring a link to an editors contributions. BilledMammal (talk)\n\nAs someone who has been using Timeless, I can say that having the user links in a dropdown does not cause me any issue today, and it's second nature to click these links through a dropdown. (I'll move to Vector22 on desktop probably Soon, just have to get off my preferences butt, and mobile Whenever it actually supports mobile.) Oppose accordingly. \"Supports\" and \"opposes\" aren't really valuable here. Discussing why you want a link in X or Y position might be, but is still squarely in the realm of design, especially (as I'm sure they will) as they start turning to making the skin friendly(er) for mobile. It might be valuable to decide on what the most valuable links are in the dropdown, rather than having RFCs for this that and the other thing, and see if there can't be some thought put into displaying certain links at certain widths (perhaps as icons, though I know the group that hates the dropdown is probably a concentric set with the group that hates icons). In general though, this dropdown is provided for the set of people who already do have access to scripts, so they always have a workaround to what is/isn't displayed. Izno (talk)\n\nProposal: Apply extended-confirmed restriction and one revert restriction through general sanctions to all topics relating to gender identity, including transgender and non-binary gender\n\nThere are currently ARBCOM sanctions on topics related to gender and sexuality as described at WP:GENSEX. This allows uninvolved administrators to apply and enforce restrictions on related articles and editors in this topic area. Unfortunately, it seems that this is not sufficient to prevent widespread disruption in the topic area. Gender identity is highly contentious and causes significant disruption, and that's unlikely to change any time soon. Furthermore, this topic area is among those most capable of causing real world harm. For these reasons, I'm proposing the creation of community-authorized WP:ARBPIA-equivalent restrictions for this subject. This would entail:\n\nStandard contentious topics sanctions as previously established\n\nExtended confirmed restriction that disallows IP editors and new accounts to edit articles on these topics or participate in discussions on them outside of the \"Talk:\" namespace\n\nOne revert restriction that limits all editors to a single revert in 24 hours (unless it's to enforce the previous point or remove clear vandalism)\n\nIt would not replace or change the ARBCOM GENSEX sanction, but it would supplement it in this specific area with ECR and 1RR. To my understanding, this is the highest level of restriction in use under general sanctions, and it currently applies to Palestine–Israel, the Syrian Civil War and ISIL, and cryptocurrency. Before any RfC is created, I'm posting this proposal here to determine:\n\nWhether support for this exists\n\nIf so, at what scope; whether a more limited scope such as transgender BLPs, or more broadly into LGBT topics\n\nIf there are any stipulations or other considerations that would need to be addressed in a hypothetical RfC\n\nThat I didn't completely misinterpret how all of this works\n\nIf there is support for this proposal, then the next step would be to create an WP:AN RfC to formally authorize these sanctions. Thebiguglyalien (talk)\n\nWP:WikiProject LGBT studies has been notified of this discussion. Thebiguglyalien (talk)\n\nNote, saw this before the notification went out, though I am active in that WikiProject. I'm a pretty active editor across many GENSEX articles, if I'm not patrolling recent changes for any sort of vandalism or disruptive editing, you'll likely find me on a talk page somewhere hashing out content. I've some remarks on each of the three proposals:\n\nThis seems largely redundant. GENSEX is already a CTOP area through the past ArbCom cases and motions listed on WP:GENSEX.\n\nOn the surface this isn't a bad idea. As you've alluded to, it would prevent drive-by article space disruption by both IP editors and new accounts, which would certainly cut down on certain types of disruption like inserting deadnames or mass pronoun changes of BLPs, or spurious accusations based on typical anti-LGBT+ canards. However I'm not sure it would actually solve the current overall problems in the content area. From my perspective, one of the biggest problems is that we have a set of established behaviourally problematic editors in this content area, all of whom to my knowledge are extended confirmed, that this restriction would not directly affect.\n\nA blanket 1RR seems overly draconian to me. As a tool to prevent disruption, it has its uses on a targeted per-article basis, but as a blanket \"all articles are now subject to 1RR\". 1RR has by its nature a stabilising effect on articles sure, but that also has the effect of making rewrites, and major additions or removals significantly harder for all involved.\n\nIn terms of actually fixing what's currently broken in GENSEX, I don't think that this would have the desired effect. I'd also be concerned at the unintentional side effect of scaring off good faith new editors from this area. Maybe I'm wrong though, and I'd be interested to hear from editors in the other content areas you've identified that have these restrictions if they find that those restrictions have actually helped that content area, or if they've just moved the trouble spots elsewhere. Sideswipe9th (talk)\n\n@Thebiguglyalien, here's how I'm understanding your proposal.\n\nYou believe that 99.75% of all registered editors should be banned from editing or writing articles about trans people.\n\n99.75% of all registered editors should be banned from joining this discussion, or any discussion like it, because it's not in the Talk: namespace.\n\nIf a celebrity reveals a different gender identity today, then only the top 0.25% of editors should be allowed to make our articles comply with MOS:GENDERID. The other 99.75% of editors should be warned and blocked if they try to help out.\n\nEditors attending edit-a-thons (such as Art+Feminism) and students in organized classes (there are more 4000 students in more than 300 classes running right now) should be banned from editing anything even remotely related to gender. We should definitely cancel any groups that want to write about women's health or women's politics, because someone might have to decide whether to write \"the woman's uterus\" or \"the uterus\", and that's gender-related.\n\nAnd the justification for this is: People who have already achieved not only ECR, but Wikipedia:Unblockable status, can and do perpetuate gender-related disputes for years, while an IP can be blocked out of hand and pages can be protected to prevent them from editing entirely. Right? WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nThe OP has asserted that WP:GENSEX restrictions are inadequate to stop disruption, but there are no diffs or links to anything to back up that assertion. If we're going to supercede the existing ArbCom sanctions scheme, shouldn't we at least have evidence that the current sanctions are not working? --Jayron32\n\nI'd support adding WP:ARBECR to WP:GENSEX. ARBECR has helped in the WP:PIA and WP:APL and the community recently authorized it for WP:RUSUKR, WP:KURDS, and WP:ARBAA. GENSEX has the same problem with socking/drive-by/inexperienced editors as the other topic areas. For examples of current sanctions not working, just look at the two ANI threads in the GENSEX topic areas right now (which, in my view, have been disrupted by non-ECR editors, on both \"sides\" of the issue). I think the \"99.75%\" figure is a lark; most registered accounts never edit; we have 40 million registered accounts; half of them (20 million) never made any edits; only 2 million made 10 edits; only 450k made 100 edits; only 100k hit ECR. And yes, I think it's a good idea to not allow new editors to edit in our most-contentious contentious topics. I'm much less sure about 1RR being effective or necessary; I think I'd only be in favor of that upon a showing that there is so much edit-warring in this topic area that the usual 3RR isn't working. Levivich (talk)\n\nLooking at both discussions at ANI (One involving Newimpartial and one involving Tranarchist), and neither has significant disruption from anyone that wouldn't already qualify for ECR. Well over 90% (and possibly vanishingly close to 100%) of the text in those two ANI discussions, involve well experienced editors. I have spent 5+ minutes paging through them, and while I'm sure a small number of comments in those discussions may be from new or \"drive-by\" editors, I can't at first glance identify any obvious ones, the vast bulk of the text in those discussions is from very experienced Wikipedia editors. You're going to need better examples than that. If nothing else, your examples have served to show places where it isn't a problem; it's clear evidence against needing any ECR sanctions, since so little of those discussions is taken up with any such people. --Jayron32\n\n@Jayron32: OK, look here (whole page, top to bottom), perhaps a better example of significant timesink from multiple non-XCs. Levivich (talk)\n\nHere's a complete list of the edit counts for every person who's ever edited that talk page, in order by the number of edits made to that page (which, BTW, they would all still be allowed to do under this proposal):\n\n22K edits + 14 years\n\n350 edits + 6 years\n\n1300 edits + 1 year\n\n19K edits + 4 years\n\n7K edits + 15 years\n\n250 edits + 1.75 years\n\n(sock)\n\n31K + 5 years\n\n(IP) 1 edit\n\n300 edits + 2 years\n\n3800 edits, 7 years\n\n95K + 13 years\n\n5K edits + 1 year\n\nThat's 13 editors. Ignoring the sock, there are only three registered accounts and one IP that would be banned from editing, and all of them could reach extended-confirmed by spending a couple of hours doing some kind of trivial high-volume editing mindless, like removing dead links from ==External links== sections. Also, the IP and one registered account has made just one edit to the talk page, and another has made only three, so if your goal is to reduce the number of comments, I suggest that excluding the people who don't post much anyway is not going to make much difference. WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nThat's missing the forest for the trees. The edits by the non-XC editors on your list prompted the edits by the XC editors on your list, and wasted their time. There are 8 threads on that talk page:\n\nStarted by a sock with 14 edits who argues with several editors before getting blocked\n\ndifferent non-XC 1AM with poor understanding of sourcing\n\nsame\n\nsame\n\nproductive thread by XC editors\n\ndifferent non-XC with poor understanding of sourcing\n\nIP general complaint about bias\n\nThird non-XC with poor understanding of sourcing\n\nAll but one thread wasted editor time. It was a lot of time wasted. Levivich (talk)\n\nUnless I'm missing something, if ARBECR was applied to the GENSEX content area we'd still have to respond to those threads on article talk pages in some way. ARBECR would only prevent article space disruption, and to a lesser extent related discussions in the project namespace. Sideswipe9th (talk)\n\nYes, this is true. ARBECR would not actually prevent this particular type of disruption (unproductive talk page discussions). I'm just pointing to this as an example of disruption in the topic area by non-XC editors. But look at the article history and you see non-XC editors also having to be reverted there (even by you in some cases, lol), which seems like most of the last six months of edits to that page. I think they're wasting your time Sideswipe but I would take your word for it (and that of other regulars in the topic area) if you thought different. Levivich (talk)\n\nI've already put forward my thoughts on the initial proposal above. ARBECR is not a bad suggestion per say, we do get a lot of disruptive drive-by article space edits that need some sort of cleanup and this would put an instant stop to that. But for actually fixing what I see as broken in the GENSEX content area, I don't think it would actually address any of the root problems. Sideswipe9th (talk)\n\nYou're right, that it doesn't stop all, maybe not even most, disruption. But I see the success of ARBECR in, for example, the Holocaust topic area right now. This controversial high-profile paper comes out, it's all over Twitter and such, it should be bringing in a bunch of new editors and IPs POV-pushing from all angles, but it's not, because all those pages are ECP'd. So if you look, for example, here, here, or here, you still see editors arguing about stuff, maybe disruptively maybe not, but it's experienced editors. What you don't see is the non-XC wasting people's time on talk pages, even though the talk pages aren't ECP'd, but the articles are, and that makes the difference. I think ARBECR is noticeably reducing the amount of disruption there otherwise would be in that topic area right now. Compare with Seymour Hersh or Killing of Tyre Nichols--both high profile but not ECP'd--and you see a lot more disruption there. Levivich (talk)\n\nMaybe it's because I'm too tired right now, but it seems like you're saying that ECPing all of the mainspace pages in a contentious content area also has a measurable decrease in disruption in the related talk space? Is this something specific to the examples you've provided, or is it also reflected in other ARBECR areas? Sideswipe9th (talk)\n\nYeah you've got me right: mainspace ECP reduces talk page disruption. I've also seen it in WP:ARBPIA, like Israel. There you see the same thing as in the Holocaust articles: a long, often quite contentious, content dispute on the talk page amongst a number of experienced editors, but not really any disruption by non-XC editors. The article is protected, the talk page is not, and there has been a major escalation in violence in that conflict in the real world in the past month or two, and you'd expect this big influx of new editors, but it's just not there. Which lets the experience editors focus. To my eyes, when I look at Holocaust or Israel/Palestine talk pages, they look very different from gensex talk pages, it's a more focused and productive form of disruption :-D Levivich (talk)\n\nInteresting! In that case, I would be open to at least trailing it for 6 to 12 months to see what sort of effect it has. If it does result in the same lessening of disruption on talk pages as well as in articles, I wonder if perhaps it might bring some of the other behavioural problems from other long term editors into sharper focus. As if it does, then it would also indirectly help solve what I see to be one of the root problems in the content area.\n\nThere's a few procedural niggles that I and probably a few other editors would need some clarification on. Because GENSEX deals with identities, the delineation between when an article is or is not covered under it is a bit more fluid than other content areas. For example how do we handle BLPs where notable person John/Jane Doe comes out as trans or non-binary and changes their name? Sure I can now slap a GENSEX alert onto the talk page, but would I also be able to go to RFPP and say \"BLP subject, came out as trans, article now covered under GENSEX ARBECR\" and straightforwardly get the page protected? And how would we handle articles that contain or could contain GENSEX content, but where GENSEX isn't the primary topic? For example man, woman, pregnancy, vaginoplasty, phalloplasty. Sideswipe9th (talk)\n\nArticles that are in, or that enter, the topic area scope can be tagged. I don't think ECP is applied just as a matter of course, but if/when there is disruption, the RFPP request will get approved as a no-brainer, and often will be indef instead of temporary so you only have to ask once. For articles that aren't mostly in-scope but have some in-scope content, those I don't think usually get indef ECP'd, sometimes temporary ECP, but reverting a non-XC editor is a 3RRNO, so it's still very easy to enforce. Similarly, non-XCs can post \"constructive comments and make edit requests\" on article talk pages, but they can't vote in RFCs, RMs, AFD, RSN, BLPN or any other project discussion. It also stops non-XCs from creating new articles in scope (in theory, NPP catches it, but if not, it can be CSD'd). Levivich (talk)\n\nIn re \"I think the \"99.75%\" figure is a lark; most registered accounts never edit\" for @Levivich: If you want to count only registered editors who have successfully completed an edit (a number that is smaller than the number who tried), then extended-confirmed excludes about 99.2% of all registered editors. That still excludes a lot of editors. WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nThat's no more convincing than pointing out the pool of XC editors is over 64,000. There are lots of editors. Most are not extended confirmed. Even more are not autoconfirmed. Even more have never made an edit. That doesn't mean anything, and portraying it in terms of \"percentage of editors excluded\" is rhetoric, not logic. The logic is to exclude inexperienced editors; that fact that 99% of registered accounts are inexperienced is besides the point, since 87% of registered accounts don't currently edit anyway. We have like 50k active editors out of 40+ million accounts, so that's 87.5% (I think) of editors do not currently edit. It's just an example of \"lies, damned lies, and statistics.\" Levivich (talk)\n\nI have to agree with Levivich… the proposal is overkill, and would result in many editors (who are not editing disruptively) being restricted from contributing. I see no evidence that our current restrictions and cautions are not working. Therefor, I must Oppose. Blueboar (talk)\n\nYup, overkill. What is actually needed is broader enforcement of Wikipedia policies (e.g. WP:NPOV, WP:RS etc) in BLPs generally, and firmer action against those who use such articles as political battlegrounds. Picking out specific topics to police such content over misses the point - we shouldn't be allowing it to happen anywhere. At some point, I suspect Wikipedia will be obliged to implement restrictions on editing biographies of living persons generally, but until that happens, we should be enforcing existing policy consistently, which this proposal clearly won't do. AndyTheGrump (talk)\n\nEverything GENSEX-related reminds me of the hand-wringing that occurred around 2007 over intelligent design (which seemed to take over the entire 'pedia), and then a few years later, the hand-wringing that occurred over climate change, a content area brought well under control by the dedication of Femke and Co. The problematic editors make the headlines (ANI), but we have a bevy of very experienced editors holding down the fort. Editing in this area is no better and no worse than in any other areas. Deal with problematic editors as they come up; don't paint the entire topic area with too broad of a brush. No need to freak out because we happened to have two threads at once at ANI. SandyGeorgia (Talk)\n\nStatistics\n\nWithin articles covered by WP:WikiProject LGBT studies:\n\n68.7% of edits are by extended-confirmed editors\n\n5.3% of edits by extended-confirmed editors are reverted\n\n32.3% of edits by non-extended-confirmed editors are reverted\n\n78.3% of edits are by auto-confirmed editors\n\n7% of edits by auto-confirmed editors are reverted\n\n18.5% of edits by auto-confirmed but not extended-confirmed editors are reverted\n\n38.4% of edits by non-auto-confirmed editors are reverted.\n\nBilledMammal (talk)\n\nHow does that compare to BLPs, and to Wikipedia articles generally? AndyTheGrump (talk)\n\nTo compare it to BLP's I either need a template or category that marks them as those; unfortunately, I haven't been able to find one. If you know one then I can get those figures for you. For all Wikipedia articles, see this query. It hasn't returned yet, and note that it doesn't cover as long a period of time as the LGBT studies one in order to keep the run time reasonable. BilledMammal (talk)\n\nCategory:Living people?

Could I interest you in running that for articles that are tagged as specific CT topics, like maybe AP2? I'm curious how other CT topics look. Levivich (talk)\n\nI don't know a category that would allow me to determine AP2, but I've done:\n\nAfghanistan, Pakistan, and India\n\nKashmir\n\nKurds\n\nThe Troubles\n\nIf there are any others you want me to run, or category that would be suitable for AP2, I can run those as well. BilledMammal (talk)\n\nThanks! I guess talk pages for all CTs are in Category:Wikipedia pages about contentious topics, but I don't see categories for specific topics, which is too bad, the template could subcategorize by topic. Levivich (talk)\n\nI've run one for that category, but I wouldn't consider it a reliable baseline because that template isn't used consistently; it is more likely to be included on contentious articles within the topic than less contentious ones, and because of this the results will overestimate how contentious these topics as a whole are. BilledMammal (talk)\n\n(60% of Pakistan edits reverted??) Thanks for this. If I'm summarizing all of the above correctly:\n\nFor all articles on Wikipedia, edits by WP:XC editors (>500 edits) are reverted ~4% of the time, editors between WP:AUTOC and WP:XC (10-500 edits) 14%, non-AUTOC (<10 edits) 38%\n\nFor WP:BLPs, that breakdown is XC 4%, AUTOC-XC 15%, non-AUTOC 40%\n\nFor (some but not all) WP:CTs, XC 8%, AUTOC-XC 28%, non-AUTOC 59%\n\nFor Kashmir, Kurds, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India, XC 5-9%, AUTOC-XC 23-34%, non-AUTOC 40-57%\n\nFor WikiProject LGBT studies, XC 5%, AUTOC-XC 19%, non-AUTOC 38%\n\nDoes \"non-AUTOC\" include IP edits? Levivich (talk)\n\nOh, that was an error; 60% of edits are made by extended confirmed editors, 18% are reverted.\n\nnon-AUTOC includes IP edits, and your summary looks correct to me. BilledMammal (talk)\n\nBe careful or they're gonna ban us again Levivich (talk)\n\nAnd what dark magic are you using to conjure these statistics? Levivich (talk)\n\nQuarry; the query for the above is here. BilledMammal (talk)\n\nHello everyone, I have dealt with spams on newly created pages for a while. I believe they are in the likely patterns,\n\na new user registered\n\nshortly added spam links, email address and something like that on their user pages, user sandboxes or user talk pages.\n\nCould we add a filter for tagging them with specific edit summary? For example, new users adding links contain their own usernames or new users adding links on their subpages. It will be better for us to deal with spams. -Lemonaka‎\n\nWe already do this sort of stuff. Edit filter 80 is a spam throttle for adding the same link over and over, Edit filter 149 flags edits where the link matches the username. If you have a specific type of spamlink that a regex-based filter may catch that these aren't, Wikipedia:Edit filter/Requested is the place to go. --Jayron32\n\n@Jayron32 Hi, thanks. I have checked logs of 149 and found they are focused on article namespace, however, most spams are coming from user namespace and subpages of that. Could we expand this filter? Or shall I request on Wikipedia:Edit filter/Requested -Lemonaka‎\n\nOh, I found that, [[1]] -Lemonaka‎\n\nPer MASSCREATION and WP:SEMIAUTOMATED, I request permission to mass-create articles pertaining to villages and municipalities in Turkey, including templates and categories. After creating many articles, was advised to seek permission for such semi-automated creations. Discussion here here. Semsûrî (talk)\n\nArbitrary break\n\nI think you're in the wrong location. Per WP:MASSCREATION, the correct venue to request the right to mass-create articles in a semi-automated fashion is at WP:BFRA. --Jayron32\n\nIt is sort of a chicken/egg scenario. Yes, this will need a BRFA - but the BRFA will want to see that there is community support for the activity. That can occur beforehand (such as here), as part of the BRFA, or separately prior to the BRFA closing. The BRFA will primarily focus on the technical aspects, but will also be looking to see that there is consensus for the activity at all. If this is a completely inappropriate activity for a bot, the proposed operator could just stop now. 18:59, 28 February 2023 (UTC) — xaosflux Talk\n\nBased on the discussion on their talk page, I don't think they want to use a bot; they're using a boilerplate template to create new articles. Thus discussion at the village pump may be more appropriate. isaacl (talk)\n\nGotcha, so unless a bot-flagged account is going to be used to make \"likely good\" edits that are autopatrolled, etc - no BRFA will be involved. \"Mass-creation\" is certainly subjective, if it is going to flood recent changes - bot is the way, else may not be needed. — xaosflux Talk\n\nWP:MASSCREATE says Any large-scale automated or semi-automated content page creation task must be approved at Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval. (emphasis added) Maybe we should update that to say that non-bot semi-automated mass creation should be approved at VPR, if BAG doesn't want semi-auto to go to BRFA. Levivich (talk)\n\nThis! I'm not interested in a bot but to continue my boilerplate template if possible. Semsûrî (talk)\n\nSemsuri, can you expand a little bit about the proposed creations, like how many are you planning to make, based on what sources, and give a few examples of what they look like when done? I assume we're talking about articles like Altınbaşak, Üzümlü and Gökçe, Artuklu, in the same form, using the same sources?\n\nAlso, how is this related to your earlier effort to redirect existing village articles, if it's related at all? (I saw the discussion on your talk page.)\n\nI would support either redirecting villages to other articles (that can contain the information about villages), or creating new village stubs (if redirecting is not desirable), I'm just not sure what is the best way, and maybe it's redirecting some and having stand-alone pages for others. Levivich (talk)\n\nI can give a very specific estimate by counting the number of villages and towns in the provinces that I haven't gotten around to yet (I'm not planning on creating an article for every notable settlement in the country!).\n\nThe two primary sources that are recurring in all of the pages are TUIK and e-icisleri - the former gives me info on population history from 2007 to 2022 while the other gives me info on the administrative status of the entity and whether there are hamlets attached to the entity. Ofis, Kızıltepe is an example of an article with the bare minimum. In many cases, however, I have secondary references that allows me to expand the pages to various degrees as seen with these:\n\nBağlar, Şemdinli\n\nAyranlı, Şemdinli\n\nGelinkaya, Midyat\n\nHancıçiftliği, Erzincan\n\nThe issues with the articles that I redirected last year were plenty including lack of primary references that confirmed their status (some quarters in a town had their own article claiming to be villages), no coordinates, no population, and so on, so I just believed that the easiest thing to do was to redirect them (which was also very cathartic for me). Since then (and having in mind that I had plenty of secondary and reliable references in my library), I believed I could create better articles — even the stubs that I have created are of better quality than the ones we were used to.\n\nI'm going to do my calculations now. Semsûrî (talk)\n\nMy advice… take your time. Go slowly. Do say 5 articles… wait to see if there are any problems… if none, then do 10 and wait… If after a few iterations of this no one is stating a problem, you can ramp up the pace further. Blueboar (talk)\n\nYou didn't say much about the amount of content within the articles. The worst case scenario that is covered by your request would be a zillion content free stubs with just an \"it exists\" statement with one reference which supports \"it exists\" I took a look at 2 of your articles and they have a lot more content and sourcing than that. Looking at that and you saying SEMI-automated, you have real articles each with a few sources and a few sections and text covering a few areas and a moderate amount of time invested in each one. . If so, we're talking about a moderate amount of real articles, not a zillion geostubs. If so, perhaps you could describe that in a few sentences and then I think it would receive affirmation / support here. Sincerely North8000 (talk)\n\nWhat is the overall scope of your endeavor (e.g. 500 articles over 3 months)? — xaosflux Talk\n\n2,004 since 15 December. Semsûrî (talk)\n\nSo from my quick calculations, there are around 2.7K articles left. Semsûrî (talk)\n\nArticles created so far seem good. I'd suggest Blueboar's approach to start, but this is a good endeavour. DFlhb (talk)\n\nThe first three articles on that list have 5+ references and material derived from them, multiple sections and represent at least a moderate investment of time on each one. I support continuation of that (or even articles a bit skimpier) and thank you for your work. Sincerely, North8000 (talk)\n\nLooking at the table some of these are appropriate, but the majority appear to be the sort of stub that got Lugnuts into trouble (for example, 100. Yıl, Adıyaman). If Semsûrî limits themselves to the more expansive articles that would be fine, but the majority of the articles are not. BilledMammal (talk)\n\nI believe the Lugnuts problem involved mass-use of unreliable sources (as opposed to here, government sources), and violations of WP:GEOLAND; but the article you link above seems to suffer from neither problem. DFlhb (talk)\n\nI was referring to the broader Lugnuts problem, that resulted in him being topic banned from creating articles of less than 500 words; the articles listed above are the same sort that resulted in that sanction, and the rate of creation is very similar. I think you are referring to the narrower Lugnuts Turkish village problem, that resulted in him losing autopatrolled and having all the relevant articles deleted. BilledMammal (talk)\n\nAll of the articles will be expanded with info added to the template:historical populations as you can see at 100. Yıl, Adıyaman expanding these articles a bit. Semsûrî (talk)\n\nIn some ways that is better, but it makes other things worse; when an article consists of little but a table showing population growth by year it introduces WP:NOTDATABASE issues. What is needed is additional prose, giving information on the history, geography, economy, etc of the location. BilledMammal (talk)\n\nI don't disagree that additional prose would make the article better, but the addition of the population chart does not make anything worse, nor does it introduce \"WP:NOTDATABASE issues.\" That guideline is concerned with \"excessive listings of unexplained statistics\" that \"lack context or explanation can reduce readability\" and further suggests that \"statistics should be placed in tables to enhance readability, and articles with statistics should include explanatory text providing context.\" In the case of 100. Yil, the population statistics are not excessive and do not reduce readability. Moreover, they are placed in a table (as the guideline suggests), and the article includes explanatory text explaining that there has been a recent decline in population due to climate issues. This seems to be exactly what NOTDATABASE suggests. Cbl62 (talk)\n\nThe explanatory text providing context and rectifying the WP:NOTDATABASE issues was added after my comment. I would still prefer additional prose and a second source providing WP:SIGCOV, but considering the locations are currently covered by WP:GEOLAND I wouldn't object to Semsûrî's creations if they were all like the current status of 100. Yıl, Adıyaman. For the moment, they aren't, but I understand Semsûrî intends to bring them up to that status; once they do so for the current 2000 I would support the creation of the final 3000. BilledMammal (talk)\n\nYes, I've created a database for myself (User:Semsûrî/Turkeyplaces) where I can keep track on my work. There are many articles that are at the same level or more voluminous than 100. Yıl like Kayalık, Çukurca and Anadağ, Derecik but it would be great to have clear criterias so I don't have to guess whether I've reached a sufficient volume at each article. I'm planning on adding the historical population template to all of the articles and moreover expand the prose based on secondary references. Semsûrî (talk)\n\n@Semsûrî: Thanks for answering all these questions. If I understand correctly, for every article you have created (about 2000 so far) and plan to create (about another 2700), there is at least one secondary source (in addition to the databases TUIK and Icisleri). I understand that creation of the stubs with the database sources can be done semi-automatically (with a template), but expansion of those stubs with the secondary source cannot, that requires manual work, and so will take longer.\n\nAssuming I understand correctly, here is my question: can you create these articles so that when they are created, the secondary source is listed in a \"Further reading\" section (even if it hasn't yet been worked into the article as a source)? That way, every article created will have at least one secondary source in the Further reading. Is it possible/reasonable to do? Levivich (talk)\n\nSometimes a secondary reference is used in multiple articles where I change the prose + page in the citation template. So, at times a secondary reference is included in my boilerplate template. I see the point in adding a 'Further reading-section' if there are none utilized as sources and it shouldn't be an issue. Semsûrî (talk)\n\nWP:MASSCREATE says all mass-created articles (except those not required to meet WP:GNG) must cite at least one source which would plausibly contribute to GNG, so I think if you are including the secondary source in \"Further reading\" then that's good enough (even if the source isn't yet cited for prose). That way, anyone looking at the article knows the village has at least one GNG source (the one in Further reading), plus anyone else who wants to expand the article will have at least one source listed they can use to expand it, so I think it would encourage expansion. Levivich (talk)\n\nThe articles are covered by GEOLAND, and having checked a dozen or so I'm not seeing issues. They appear better than many such stub location articles. -- LCU ActivelyDisinterested ∆transmissions∆ °co-ords°\n\nSupport after the discussion above. It isn't a ridiculous amount (2k created, 2.7k to go, <5k total), it's not like 100k of villages in Turkey. Each article would be supported by at least one non-database source (included at least in Further reading, as I understand it), so it's not like an indiscriminate collection (not like every village in Turkey), and it's not just scraping a database and copy/pasting it to Wikipedia. Because of the secondary source, I think it's reasonable to believe the articles will be expanded (at least there exists one source that can be used for expansion, which is more than we can say about other mass-created articles from other users in the past). I don't think redirects would be a good alternative; I think it would make articles like Üzümlü District unwieldy if we merged every village (e.g. Altınbaşak, Üzümlü) into the district article. I'm generally more inclined to see the value in populated, legally-recognized place stubs than other types of stubs (obscure athletes). Finally, WP:SYSTEMICBIAS encourages me to support; we have articles about every abandoned train stop and dirt road in the US; because Wikipedia is so heavily Western, we don't have as many editors who are going to manually create articles about populated/legally-recognized villages in Turkey, as compared to editors who will write about places in the US, so I'm more inclined to say yeah, let's do some mass-creation of expandable stubs about non-Western notable topics to even out systemic bias. Levivich (talk)\n\nConditional Support I would strongly suggest asking a bot coder to include more information upon creation than just population. I would also support the deletion and recreation of ones I started over 10 years ago without much information. It would be much more beneficial for Wikipedia to have near start class articles on these villages than short stubs sitting around which nobody is working on. Much better to do this than redirect to districts as the proposer did in the past. I would oppose a proposal to mass create one or two line stubs like Gökçe, Artuklu. I generally don't like what bots do on Swedish and Cebuano wiki etc but I'm of the opinion that English Wikipedia would benefit massively for a bot to create missing populated settlements which are near start class upon creation and consistent. I did propose something back in 2008 in fact with Fritz. ♦ Dr. Blofeld\n\nI'm of the opinion that English Wikipedia would benefit massively for a bot to create missing populated settlements which are near start class upon creation and consistent In theory I would support this; I suspect it can be done well, and if it is the result would be both the creation of new articles and the improvement of existing articles. BilledMammal (talk)\n\nIn the case of Turkey, I would even include depopulated settlements due to the violent history of the Kurdish region. Kovankaya, Beytüşşebap is unpopulated but still notable enough to have its own article. Semsûrî (talk)\n\nCONDITIONAL support Conditional on them having the amount of content and sourcing in the first three of the 4 listed examples, or close to it. North8000 (talk)\n\nConditional support per North8000. I had many of these watchlisted and up until now, it looks like the vast majority have been based purely on lists and statistics like Saray, Nizip, Kilis, Sason and Kulaksız, Sason. Any further creations would ideally include in-depth secondary sources like Gelinkaya, Midyat, Ayranlı, Şemdinli and Bağlar, Şemdinli. Question for Semsûrî: As someone who doesn't read the language, could you explain the political status of these villages? Are they self-governing municipalities, census tracts or something else? I just want to make sure we don't make the same mistakes as past mass creators. –dlthewave ☎\n\nOn the village politically, I think Jongerden explains it best:\n\n\"The center-village model is best understood against an administrative background. Administration in Turkey is strong in centers, but weak in peripheries. The villages are formally headed by the village-chief (muhtar), who is supposed to implement the law in village affairs and act upon directives of the governor and district officer. In practice, the governor and district officer do not take much notice of village affairs (as long there is no urgent need), and the village headman does not take much notice of the law (so long as he is not forced to), particularly if village custom already provides an accepted alternative method of dealing with a problem\". The administrative status of the hamlets, which outnumber villages by almost a third, is unclear. In some occassions the muhtar of a neighboring village has authority over a hamlet, but at other times a formal administration is absent, and administration takes place through customary law.\n\nNot mentioned in the quote is that muhtars are locally elected by the village. Semsûrî (talk)\n\nQuote is from \"The Settlement Issue in Turkey and the Kurds\" by Joost Jongerden (page 292) Semsûrî (talk)\n\nI am writing to request the promotion of the WikiShootMe.js user script as a Gadget on Wikipedia.

Their C-class criteria are:\n\nThe article meets B1 or B2 as well as B3 and B4 and B5 of the B-Class criteria.\n\nI am proposing we adopt this for WP:ASSESS's C-class criteria. B6 would not be required for C-class; note that some projects don't use B6.\n\nRationale:\n\nThe current distinction between Start-class and C-class is somewhat subjective.\n\nThis provides much more objective criteria for C-class, which will make our ratings more consistent across articles.\n\nGrades provide \"gamification\" that incentivise article expansion, so the more precise they are, the more effective the incentive is.\n\nThese criteria provide clearer guidance for editors wishing to improve Start-class articles, who may be unsure of where to start.\n\nWhen one B-criteria is filled, the B-criteria are shown by default on Start-class articles, which this proposal would not affect.\n\nDFlhb (talk)\n\nI agree that the line between Start and C is blurry. But as someone who edits in topics that have some overlap with MILHIST, I've found that particular assessment system and the B-checklist tool to be more of a mild annoyance than anything. I suspect you could come up with an article that's only a few sentences long but would technically meet this set of C-class criteria. Thebiguglyalien (talk)\n\nWouldn't that fail B3? DFlhb (talk)\n\nYou don't need much content to make a lead and a section. Thebiguglyalien (talk)\n\nI see. I've noticed that even short MILHIST articles tend to be far better sourced than for other WikiProjects. Maybe that has at least a little to do with their criteria incentivising either completeness or sourcing, while our current criteria just incentivises completeness? Seems like a bad incentive. DFlhb (talk)\n\nI hate to ask this, but does anyone outside of MILHIST and I guess the 1.0 Editorial Team actually care about the non GA/FA article criteria? Sideswipe9th (talk)\n\nFrom my experience at talk pages, apparently NO, at least for C/Start class. —CX Zoom[he/him] (let's talk • {C•X})\n\nMILHIST very much cares about b-class, with the others being less significant. Hog Farm Talk\n\nVery much so. C class did not originate at MILHIST. It was brought in by other projects and adopted by MILHIST for conformity only after some debate. I argued against it; I did not think creating an additional class between Start and B was worthwhile, given that B is the minimum acceptable standard for any article. The outcome was not what the advocates expected. It resulted in the criteria for B class being hardened. Where once an article could have an unreferenced sentence or two and still be waved through as B class, now such articles were now graded C. Over time the role of C class has become that of identifying candidates for elevation to B class through a small amount of work. Currently MILHIST has about 20,000 articles rated B class and 60,000 as C class. Hawkeye7 (discuss)\n\nWP:MILHIST has some advantages because of long continuity among the project's ranks. Hawkeye7 has been among those leading the project for many, many years and the respect I feel for his experience, competence, dedication and long first-hand knowledge of Wikipedia's history has been earned. I'd rather not speak for other wikiprojects but C-class can be, as Hawkeye7 points out, a useful flag that moderate diligence has been exercised in review and that only comparatively small effort needs be made to get the work to B-class thresholds. The required effort to promote between start and B-class reviews is substantial. BusterD (talk)\n\nAt WP:HWY, this means that there are at least all the required sections (Route description, History, and Junction list]], but that they are not necessarily complete or fully sourced. WP:HWY/A. --Rschen7754\n\nI just thought of another potential benefit: with this change, all assessment grades will have clear, specific criteria (except of course Stub). It doesn't just clarify C; it also defines Start-class as any article that fails both B1 and B2, or fails any of B3, B4, B5. DFlhb (talk)\n\nShould I turn this into an RFC? Would be nice to get wider community participation ruling on this one way or another, before we switch to project-independent quality assessments. DFlhb (talk)\n\nOppose per WP:BURO. The proposal is incomprehensible jargon because even an experienced editor like myself has no idea what those various B numbers are. And, as Sideswipe9th says, what's the point of these fine distinctions? For example, I attend discussions at WP:ITN/C where article quality is an important consideration for every nomination. Project ratings get no respect there. I have suggested that they be used but most editors use their own assessment based upon the number of citations, the amount of prose and little else. Andrew🐉(talk)\n\nIMO, the key point for C-Class is content (B2). Format (B4) and supporting materials (B5) are really immaterial for C-Class. I am glad to pass an article for C-Class if it meets B2 but fails all of B4 and B5 and B6.--Lopullinen\n\nI'd be fine with defining C-class as either B1 or B2, and dropping the rest, to echo your and Andrew's comments (or dropping the B-jargon and saying \"citations\" and \"coverage\" or equivalents. DFlhb (talk)\n\nHi all! I'm planning to undertake a task that would involve creating a large number of redirects to point the ISO 3166-2 country subdivision codes to the relevant articles on that country's subdivisions. Unless an page with a title matching a country subdivision code already exists, this process would create a redirect at that title to point the relevant subdivision. Some of these already exist as redirects (e.g. the subdivision codes for Argentina), but that set of redirects is currently incomplete. I realize that I could probably do this manually without issue, but it would take quite a while. I would hope to eventually semi-automate the process of creating these, since creating 5000 redirects and adding tags can be tedious if done manually. For that reason, I am asking for consensus around whether this sort of redirect creation is looked upon favorably by the community before I go ahead with mass creation. — Red-tailed hawk (nest)\n\nCan you provide a few examples? Also, what practical problem would this solve? Sandstein\n\nSure! This would mean pointing things like UZ-NG to Namangan Region, ZM-05 to Northern Province, Zambia, et cetera. I think that this is a reasonable search term; I've had to type the codes into google to figure out what they've referred to when looking at datasets in the past. We have {{R from ISO 639 code}} for language codes, and the plan would be to do a similar thing for subdivision codes—so long as there isn't any conflict with existing redirects. — Red-tailed hawk (nest)\n\nWith respect to the problem it would solve, it would allow users to type in the ISO code in the search bar and then be taken to the article on the corresponding geographic entity. Users currently can't do this. — Red-tailed hawk (nest)\n\nPersonally, I prefer to defer to search engines to figure out the best destination for a search term, and not try to make every reasonable search term a redirect. I appreciate, though, that others have different views. isaacl (talk)\n\nI tend to use Wikipedia where possible since it's ad-free and respects users' privacy, hence I'm in favour of creating redirects such as these. Daß Wölf\n\nSure; I think it's better to improve Wikipedia's search capability, though, without requiring editors to create innumerable redirects. isaacl (talk)\n\nIf this does happen, make sure you create a new redirect template (Template:R from ISO 3166-2 code) and use it, along with other relevant redirect templates. Gonnym (talk)\n\nNote that User:PotatoBot (User:Anypodetos) created the ISO 639 redirects (Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval/PotatoBot 2) so this isn't a completely new idea. Gonnym (talk)\n\nI would be sure to make a redirect template and tracking category in the case that this gets approved, yes. — Red-tailed hawk (nest)\n\nLooks good to me. EpicPupper (talk)\n\nA very good idea in theory but beware of name clashes. For example, ISO 3166-2:AL tells us that AL-01 is Berat, Albania, but currently redirects to Alabama's 1st congressional district. Certes (talk)\n\nAs specified above, I wouldn't touch anything with a name clash during a mass creation. I agree that those are best handled manually. — Red-tailed hawk (nest)\n\nI think this is a good idea. It's a well-defined and limited set of redirects, all of which will be plausible search terms (pretty sure I've searched some myself). Where clashes exist, it may even be worth turning those clashes into disambiguation pages, although this will presumably be a manual process. Might be worth including some tracker for codes where the target page doesn't exist, or is itself a redirect, for manual follow up. CMD (talk)\n\nI support this. User:Red-tailed hawk, if you can provide a complete list, I can provide you with a list of the ones that clash with existing redirects, and the ones that clash with existing articles (if any). I agree with CMD that disambiguation pages would likely be appropriate for all clashes with redirects. BilledMammal (talk)\n\nI would be happy to. Do you know of any script that converts a Microsoft Excel document into a Wikitable? I'd be happy to post one here if I can get the formatting fixed. — Red-tailed hawk (nest)\n\nTry copying and pasting the cells into Visual Editor. Otherwise, see Wikipedia:Village pump (technical)/Archive 204 § Excel to Wikipedia tables for a couple of Toolforge tools that will convert tab-separated text into wikitext tables, so you can try copying and pasting the cells into those tools. isaacl (talk)\n\nI'm getting a terrible error when I try to copy-paste into VE. I'll take a look at those tools. Thank you for the pointers! — Red-tailed hawk (nest)\n\nSorry, I don't. However, I would suggest saving the excel document as a CSV file, opening it in notepad, and copying and pasting the contents - probably to another page. It won't be formatted, but that isn't important. BilledMammal (talk)\n\nLgtm. Thanks, Hawk. Levivich (talk)\n\nok so i think that vote \"options\" (idk what's it called in enwiki) such as Support, Oppose, Comment should have a little icon that represents the options. so like Support ; Oppose; Comment and Meh. tynjee\n\nHey -tynjee. There is a long-established consensus against templates for marking votes, in particular because they encourage voting over discussion. See Wikipedia:Voting templates. — The Earwig (talk)\n\nI will echo what The Earwig says in that there's been longstanding hesitation around making those templates. There already exists a {{comment}} template, and a {{meh}} template (though the current meh template is slightly different from what you're proposing). — Red-tailed hawk (nest)"
