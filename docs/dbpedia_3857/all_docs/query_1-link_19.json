We introduce you to pathbreaking new construction materials that are unrivaled in Turkey. You have to see, touch and feel in order to see the difference.\n\nIn the Steel-AAC houses designed by Metay; unrivaled AAC has been taken as major construction material and a steel structure is built around it, thanks to Metay’s engineering experience and know-how about this material. In this structure, earthquake safety has reached at highest possible level which regular reinforced concrete structure can’t reach in feasible conditions, with the help of the nature of steel and AAC.\n\nHealthy Living\n\nwith AAC\n\nThe houses which are wrapped around by 20 cm thick AAC in a way that won’t let any thermal bridge through walls, ceiling or floor. 1-meter crawlspace below the house prevents transfer of heat, humidity, water and insects from the ground. Attic below the roof also prevents heat transfer from sunlight with the help of naturally ventilated space above the first floor.\n\nEarthquake Safety\n\nwith Structural Steel\n\nSteel structures known to be advantageous against seismic forces because of its ductile nature has been upgraded by the introduction of AAC as a structural element, into an even safer version without the need of annoying bracing steel elements.\n\nPlease fill out the form and we will contact you to give further information about Metay Villas at Bahçecik"
