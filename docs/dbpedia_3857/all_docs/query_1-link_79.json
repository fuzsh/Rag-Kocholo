Therefore, people should have better options in choosing where and how to live. We are always looking for the better with devotion and creativity; and share with people as we find it.\n\nWe have been specialised on residence complexes over 40 years. This experience has been enhanced with our recent work on steel structures which is an essential component of industry construction. As a result, Steel-AAC house concept has been synthesized. We want to extend the residents content who are living in the houses we have been building individually for years."
