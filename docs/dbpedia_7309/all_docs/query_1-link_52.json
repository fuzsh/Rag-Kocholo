A year ago, WSU entered as the No. 2 seed for the fourth time since the tournament moved to St. Louis (2005, 2010, 2010, 2013).\n\n-WSU has never won the tournament since it moved to St. Louis, and holds two tournament titles, 1985 and 1987, when the tournament was on home courts.\n\n- When WSU won the tournament in 1985 it defeated SIU and Indiana State in Wichita before defeating Tulsa in the title game at Tulsa. In 1987, when WSU won again, it defeated Creighton and Illinois State before winning again in Tulsa's home floor in overtime.\n\n-WSU is 3-4 against Missouri State in the MVC Tournament, with MSU winning the first four meetings and WSU winning the last three in St. Louis.\n\n-WSU ended the regular season with a 68-45 win on Senior Day March 1 against Missouri State to finish the regular-season with an NCAA-record 31 wins.\n\n-WSU defeated Missouri State with a 19-point comeback to tie, then win, 72-69, in overtime in Springfield, Mo., in the first meeting of the home-and-home series. It was the closest margin of the season.\n\n-WSU earned the MVC Tournament top seed and its eighth regular-season Valley title with the win against Drake on Feb. 22, and cut down the South net following the game. It was WSU's second title in the last three seasons.\n\n-Cleanthony Early scored 18 points at Loyola to become the 42nd Shocker to reach 1,000 career points. He now has 1,051 and ranks 35th in WSU history.\n\n-Gregg Marshall is 14-4 against the Bears.\n\n-WSU was 17-0 at home in 2013-14. The Shockers have been undefeated at home in Charles Koch Arena (Levitt Arena) only two other times since the arena opened in 1955-56.\n\n-Wichita State is No. 1 nationally in road winning percentage over the past three-plus seasons (since 2010-11) with a 38-8 record.\n\n-WSU is riding its best start in history and its longest win-streak in history at 32 games. WSU is second in MVC history with the 32-game win streak.\n\n-The 32-straight wins broke the school win-streak record which was the 14-straight from game four to game 16 (Dec. 7-Jan. 21) in 1953-54.\n\n-Wichita State (32-0) is ranked No. 2 in the USA Today Coaches Poll and No. 2 in the AP Poll. It is the highest regular-season AP ranking for the Shockers since Dec. 29, 1981 when WSU was No. 2. WSU was No. 1 in the AP poll for one week in 1964.\n\nWSU 80, Evansville 58 ... Cleanthony Early and Ron Baker scored 17 points apiece and No. 2 Wichita State set a Missouri Valley tournament record with 11 blocked shots, staying perfect for the season with an 80-58 romp over Evansville in the quarterfinals Friday.\n\nD.J. Balentine had 31 points with seven 3-pointers for ninth-seeded Evansville (14-19), which lost twice by an average of 15 points to Wichita State (32-0) in the regular season.\n\nKadeem Coleby had six of the blocks for the Shockers, who are two victories shy of matching the NCAA record of 34 wins to start a season by UNLV in 1990-91. UNLV was perfect before losing in the NCAA semifinals to Duke that season.\n\nWorth Noting\n\n-WSU's 11 blocks against Evansville were a tournament record and rank tied for fifth in WSU history.\n\nSeason WSU Team Stat Rankings...\n\n-WSU's 2,416 team points ranks ninth all-time at WSU.\n\n-WSU's +15.7 scoring margin is currently best all-time.\n\n-WSU's 59.8 defensive scoring average is currently third-\n\nbest all-time.\n\n-WSU's 216 three's ranks tied for ninth currently.\n\n-WSU's 612 free throws made currently ranks third.\n\n-WSU's 224 steals ranks seventh currently.\n\n-WSU's 170 blocks currently ranks second.\n\nIndividual WSU Season Stat Rankings...\n\n-Ron Baker's 61 three-pointers ranks tied for 11th with Malcolm Armstead's 61 a year ago.\n\n-Cleanthony Early's 142 free throws ranks tied for eighth.\n\n-Kadeem Coleby's 41 blocks ranks 10th in a season.\n\n-Fred VanVleet's 169 assists ranks tied for third in a season.\n\n-Fred VanVleet's 63 steals ranks third in a season\n\nIndividual WSU Career Stat Rankings...\n\n-Tekele Cotton's 104 career steals ranks 10th.\n\n-Cleanthony Early's 1,051 points ranks 35th.\n\nWSU MVC Tournament History...

WSU also won the tournament in 1985 over Tulsa in Tulsa after defeating SIU and Indiana State in Wichita.\n\nT-Second in Wins..

SIU (17-0 start in 2003-04) and Drake (13-0 start in 2007-08) are the only two schools to start better than 9-0 in the league in the past 20 seasons.\n\nMore on the MVC Start...
