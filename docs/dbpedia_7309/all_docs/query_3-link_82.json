        "text": "Not their first year, no. According to Wiki & the Web archive, Hurtado & Diaz moved to train with Marie France & Patrice late 2011. I'm not sure who D&L coached in those early days, other than Spain's very own \"what if\" team, and the Danadians. I wouldn't be surprised if early Gadbois suffered from lack of technical aptitude in their skaters, vs. creativity and choreography. Marie France & Patrice weren't too boring until the very end of their career. (I still don't know how they made Somewhere In Time feel fresh...?)\n\nHurtado/Diaz's Free Dance in 2011/12 season (it was done by Camerlengo though)\n\nSara HURTADO / Adria DIAZ ESP Free Dance 2012 World Figure Skating Championships Nice\n\nSara HURTADO / Adria DIAZ ESP Free Dance 2012 World Figure Skating Championships Nice\n\nThe 2012/13 Free Dance\n\nISU ZAGREB 2013 -6/21- ICE DANCE FD - Sara HURTADO Adria DIAZ - 25.01.2013\n\nSegment score: 74.94 OVERALL Score: 124.26TUTTO in sezione ICE SKATING de La Riserva forum http://lariserva.forumcommunity.net\n\nFirst season of Fournier/Sorensen\n\nSo, with all the JGPs in the books, the outlines of the Final are interesting.\n\nLooking at average scores across two events, as well as highest scores (accounting for errors), there is a massive gap between the top two teams and the other four entrants. Mrazkova/Mrazek and Bashynska/Beaumont about ten points or more clear of everybody else, and the former's PBs have a not-insignificant gap versus the latter's too (though they second free dance score suggests that their PB of 105 may not be the norm for them).\n\nBut the race for bronze is really interesting, both because the other four teams' scores are all pretty close, and the teams with the highest RD scores are not the teams with the highest FD scores (Lim/Quan, especially, are weak in the RD but very strong in the FD).\n\nSo, with all the JGPs in the books, the outlines of the Final are interesting.\n\nLooking at average scores across two events, as well as highest scores (accounting for errors), there is a massive gap between the top two teams and the other four entrants.

They scored 3.59 points for the jumps at Czech Skate. If they'd got the element validated at Egna that would've pushed their FD score there to less than a point from their first FD.\n\nThe 1st JGP was before the ISU changed the choreo jump requirements, right? IAM & IAM-London have had a couple of teams now in Challengers with those elements invalidated since the change, IIRC. Seems like someone on their team is dropping the ball on this by not reviewing the choreo jumps for all of their teams. That's the sort of thing that could cost someone a medal...\n\nThe 1st JGP was before the ISU changed the choreo jump requirements, right?

That's the sort of thing that could cost someone a medal...\n\nI think the Mrazeks were the team that had the invalidated choreo jump here. Their previous JGP was 9/1-9/3. (I think the ISU updated their requirements 8/31). Some other teams have had the element invalidated at Challengers - McNamara/Spiridonov for sure. Definitely not just an IAM problem, it looks like a number of coaching teams missed the memo.\n\nThey got their choreo jumps invalidated in their FD at Egna though, so the score would be lower than their first JGP.

If they'd got the element validated at Egna that would've pushed their FD score there to less than a point from their first FD.\n\nThe panel at Ostrava did not keep up with the rule change, or decided to give the element a \"pass\". M&M's first assisted jump was definitely 1.5 rotations (only 1 rotation is allowed). The assisted jump was unchanged at Egna, but that panel enforced the rule change. It's still an underwhelming element, but their score would have been 3ish points higher had the element not been invalidated.\n\nI think we are in for two very interesting fights this season:\n\nthe fight for Canada's two spots for Worlds - FB/S and L/L are scoring quite similar, I do think L/L's scores are slightly inflated but they have been getting really good levels and showing a lot of improvement for the start of the season. FB/S are also getting good marks and seem to be sharp and ready. It definitely looks like both teams worked hard this summer and want to climb. With how G/P looked and scored last season, and with the rumors about their music choice being less than stellar, I have to admit I kind of wish it will be FB/S and L/L for worlds at this point (anything can change obviously, season barely started).\n\nThe fight for US bronze and 3rd spot for Worlds - I was sure that Green/Parsons were a lock and even a threat to H/B but with how unprepared they looked and with their material and packaging lacking, they are not a lock anymore. Still, I do think they are the most likely to get the spot, but we have them, C/P, W/C, P/B, and B/S fighting for bronze which is really exciting.\n\nI think we are in for two very interesting fights this season:\n\nthe fight for Canada's two spots for Worlds - FB/S and L/L are scoring quite similar, I do think L/L's scores are slightly inflated but they have been getting really good levels and showing a lot of improvement for the start of the season.

I think we’ll see big scores from G/P. Especially when we consider that L/L have never medalled internationally at the senior level until this season, but the number 3 US team last quad (being H/B) medalled internationally every season and made the GPF too. Skate Canada need to do everything to ensure all 3 of their top teams could easily place in the top 10 at worlds. They need that 3rd spot back for home worlds!\n\nThe panel at Ostrava did not keep up with the rule change, or decided to give the element a \"pass\".

It's still an underwhelming element, but their score would have been 3ish points higher had the element not been invalidated.\n\nI looked back at the \"Requirements for Technical Rules with ongoing validity, effective July 1st, 2022\" document. There are 3 versions: 19th April, 31th May and 31th August.\n\nLatest one (31th August) has latest changes highlighted in Red. The \"one rotation maximum\" is underlined but not highlighted in red. So I guess it may have been changed on 31th May document.\n\nSo if this is the case, some coaches, choreographers and some technical panels were sleeping. It shouldn't have passed in Ostrava either if the change dates back to 31th May."
