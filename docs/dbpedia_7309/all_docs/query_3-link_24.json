        "text": "USA Hockey Release\n\nCOLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. -- Former University of New Hampshire men's hockey player Steve Moses ('12) was one of 15 skaters to be named to the 2015 U.S. Men's National Team that will compete at the 2015 International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) Men's World Championship in May. USA Hockey made the announcement Tuesday.\n\nMoses will represent the United States as the team travels to Ostrava and Prague, Czech Republic from May 1-17. The team is set to play eight guaranteed games before quarterfinal competition begins on May 14. Among the 15 are 10 players who currently play in the National Hockey League (NHL), three from NCAA teams and two, including Moses, from the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL).\n\nThe former Wildcat recently signed a one-year contract with the NHL's Nashville Predators for the 2015-16 season. Moses set the Kontinental Hockey League goal-scoring record in 2014-15 by netting 36 goals in 60 games for Jokerit (Helskinki, Finland) during the club's inaugural season in the Russia-based league. The 2015 KHL All-Star also tied for seventh in points (36-21-57) to help Jokerit to a 40-win season. Moses also skated for Jokerit in the 2012-13 and 2013-14 seasons, when the team was part of the Finnish Elite League; he tallied 61 points (34g, 27a) in 97 games.\n\nMoses had a decorated career at UNH as he recorded 98 points on 47 goals and 51 assists in 148 games played. He scored 22 goals in 37 games as a senior in 2011-12 to rank No. 12 in the nation in goals per game. As a senior, Moses led the Wildcats in goals and tied for the lead in points with 35; his other stats included seven power-play goals, four game-winning goals and two shorthanded tallies. One year earlier, he ranked third on the squad in goals (14) and fifth in points (26)."
