        "text": "Following on from the recent post on trialists it was suggested that I look at youth players from various European countries, some would have only appeared on trial and others would have progressed to a contract. I have only included players I have seen play for Rangers, I would say we manage to identity about 50% of trialists. Therefore there are loads of other players to potentially fill in the gaps and of course there are the games I wasn’t at. Thanks to Gordy for helping me fill in a couple of blanks.\n\nAlbania – Albert Rachi – Although London born Albert was an Albania youth international and had just been released from Tottenham Hotspur. He featured in a friendly in July 2019 at the training ground against a very poor Huddersfield Town side in a game Rangers won 9-1.\n\nThere was loads of chatter on social media and message boards about this “highly rated” youngster. Rangers didn’t follow up their interest and Albert signed for Potton United of The Spartan South Midlands Premier Divison.\n\nAustria – Alex Hauser – It was claimed Rangers beat of a host of top clubs to capture the signature of the Austrian U18 Internationalist midfielder from FC Tirol in 2000. He was a regular in the youth league lineups in 2000/2001 season with the highlight being scoring a double against Hearts. Appearances were limited the following season I think he suffered from injury a bit.\n\nHe left Rangers at the end of that season and signed for SW Bergenz back in his homeland. Playing for eight different clubs he made close to 200 games in the Austrian Bundesliga and a similar number in the second tier. He captained FC Wacker Innsbruck on a regular basis during 2012/2013 season and he is now a youth coach at that club.\n\nBelgium – Jeroen Van Den Broeck – The most difficult paragraph to write as Jeroen passed away in November 2017 at the age of only 28. Jeroen joined Rangers from the youth setup of Belgian club KFC Verbroedering Geel in 2006.\n\nFor two seasons he made sporadic appearances at reserve and youth level. He never quite nailed down a regular spot in the youth team, he was a great lad and his father made the trip from Belgium for an amazing number of his games. On leaving Rangers he joined Dutch club AGOW Apeldoorn, this would be the peak of his football career, making four appearances in the Dutch second tier. He went on to play for six lower league Belgian clubs before his tragic death. RIP Jeroen.\n\nBosnia & Herzegovina – Stefan Stojicic – A winger from Borac Banja Luka academy who made an appearance in a Under 18 friendly against Morton in October 2018. It would appear he is still a youth player at that club.\n\nBulgaria – Dani Kiki – I am pretty sure we have had quite a few Bulgarian players on trial over the years, but have been unable to identify most of them. Midfielder Dani Kiki is one I was able to identify, from Lokomotiv Plovdiv, he came on as a sub in a reserve friendly in against Bradford City in July 2006.\n\nA game noted for the fact that Kris Boyd scored all the goals in a 6-0 win. Dani’s career seems to have peaked in the current season at the age of 32 with 13 appearances and one goal for Cherno More Varna in the Bulgarian top league.\n\nCyprus – Georgios Efrem – An entry that most Rangers fans will be familiar with, Georgios signed for Rangers on his release from Arsenal in 2007. Although he never made a first team appearance he was a regular in the successful youth side, culminating in the 2008 Youth Cup Final win over Celtic.\n\nHe also had a brief spell on loan at Dundee, scoring twice in eight appearances. He returned to Cyprus in 2009 joining Omonia where he stayed for five years before moving to APOEL. He has regularly featured in European competition and now has close to fifty caps for his country scoring five goals including one against Scotland.\n\nCzechia (Czech Republic) – Krystof Hampl – A recent recruit to the club he was signed from FK Pardubice last summer.\n\nI believe he came to Rangers attention when he played against them in the U17 Albim Cup and was included in the Rangers squad that traveled to Russia to compete in the Spartak Cup. Krystof had previously been on trial at Benfica and Machester United, he has had a stuttering start to his Rangers career due to injury.\n\nDenmark – Nicolaj Kohlert – There were a few options from Denmark but I chose Nicolaj Kohlert as he had a the highest profile. He arrived on trial from Liverpool in July 2011 and after a couple of uninspiring appearances against Stirling Albion and Huddersfield Town I was very surprised to hear Rangers had agreed to take on the final year of his Liverpool contract. Another master stroke from Sinky. He was a bit part player in the youth team and left Rangers in January 2012 with six months remaining on his contract, to sign for Silkeborg IF back in Denmark. He did reasonably well in his first couple of years making quite a few appearances in the Danish Superligaen, but as his career waned he had spells in Faroe Islands and Iceland before retiring in 2018 at Danish lower league club Brabrand IF.\n\nFaroe Islands – Ingi Hojsted – Back in July 2004 Arsenal youngster Ingi appeared in a Rangers shirt in a friendly at Ardrossan Winton Rovers.\n\nI know I was definitely at the game but can’t say I remember much about Ingi’s performance or the game in general. His Faroe Islands club was B36 Torshavn and that is where he spent his career apart from a six month spell at Birmingham City in 2006/2006. He gained six caps for his country.\n\nFinland – Jukka Santala – There are a few options from Finland and after a bit of thought I chose Jukka. He joined Rangers back in 2004 as a centre-back from HJK Helsinki but grabbed the headlines playing as a striker in a six month loan spell at Partick Thistle, scoring eleven goals.\n\nOn leaving Rangers in 2006 he joined Danish side FC Nordsjaelland then Mjallby AIF in Sweden before returning home to FC Haka. He went on to play for a further five clubs in Finland.\n\nFrance – Dany N’Guessan – France had perhaps the greatest number to pick from. I have gone for the graduate of the Auxerre academy who joined Rangers in 2004. He never quite made the first team but made his professional debut while on loan at Boston United.\n\nOn leaving Rangers he joined Lincoln City where he made the PFA League Two Team Of The Year in 2008/09 which earned him a move to Leicester City. He made over thirty appearances before a nomadic period at various English clubs, AEL in Greece and ending his career at IK Start in Norway.\n\nGermany – Lars Babich – Players from Germany are surprisingly rare and Lars Babich is the only one I can think of. The other unusual thing about goalkeeper Lars was that he was coming over from Germany at a young age, I think he was 14 the first time I saw him play. I remember briefly speaking to him and his dad outside Ibrox, having noticed his dad watching the game Lars played in that morning at the training ground. His career seems to have peaked as a youth player at Wuppertahler SV Under 19’s.\n\nHungary – Adam Dudas – Teenage ETO FC Gyor winger made an appearance in a Rangers shirt in a youth friendly against Queens Park. I believe he also trialed at Arsenal around the same time but ultimately returned to Gyor.\n\nHis highlight there would have been a Europa League Qualifying defeat against IFK Gothernburg where he played the full 90 minutes. He surpassed that in his loan spell at Spartak Moscow in 2007, featuring in their UEFA Cup group stage win over FC Zurich.\n\nIceland – Asgeir Sigurvinsson – I have gone back a bit in time for my choice of Icelandic player, there has been a few. One thing is certain, Asheir is the best player on this list and it just so happens I did a piece on him a few years ago.\n\nÁsgeir Sigurvinsson – One That Got Away\n\nIreland – Alan Smith – There has been a few academy trialists from Ireland in the last couple of years, including three in the same game recently. But goalkeeper Alan was a ground breaker when he signed for Rangers from Crumlin United in 2010.\n\nHe was the regular Under 19 keeper during 2011/12 season. On leaving Rangers he had a couple of years at Cork City but now appears to be out of the senior game.\n\nItaly – Daniele Fortunato – Another nation we have few to pick from, but in true Blue Peter fashion “here’s one I did earlier”. A piece on Daniele I put together in 2013.\n\nDaniele Fortunato\n\nLatvia – Arturs Vaiculis – A Surprising signing from St.Mirren for a £20,000 development fee. I don’t mean any disrespect to Arturs but another example of a Sinky failure.\n\nIn my opinion Arturs was never going to be any more than an academy player, so in effect we rented an Under 19 keeper for £10,000 a season. Cyprus was his destination on leaving Rangers playing for three clubs there, before finishing his career back in the Baltics with clubs in Latvia and Lithuania.\n\nMalta – Myles Beerman – A player that will be familiar to most Rangers fans, Myles first appearance in a Rangers jersey was at Ibrox, but was a youth friendly against Hibs. Myles who was on Manchester City’s books was one of three trialists along with Michael Kelly (Leicester City) and Euan McPherson (Queens Park), he impressed playing as a left winger.\n\nOn signing for Rangers he converted to full-back and broke into the first team, reaching double figures in appearances. He made a similar number of appearances in a loan spell at Queen of the South. Loan spells back in Malta followed before a permanent move to Hibernians FC (Malta) at the start of this season. It would appear that in all but one game he has either came off the bench or been an unused sub.\n\nNetherlands – Nacer Barazite – Like Germany there have been few trialists at Rangers from Holland, a bit of surprise considering the number of Dutch players we have had. At The Oval in Belfast in August 2010 Arsenal’s youngster Nacer Barazite turned out for Rangers against Glentoran with a view to a season long loan.\n\nFor whatever reason it didn’t happen and he spent the season at Vitesse Arnhem. Spells at Austria Vienna, AS Monaco and FC Utrecht followed. He then moved a bit further afield for his contracts playing in Turkey, UAE and now in Thailand with Buriram United.\n\nNorth Macedonia – Bajram Fetai – Although he represented Denmark at youth level he was born in Macedonia and ultimately played for his country of birth at full international level. Joined Rangers in 2004 from Boldklub 93, making one first team appearance against Dunfermline Athletic. The name Scott McDonald is synonymous with “Helicopter Sunday” but had things gone the other way it could have been Bajram Fetai.\n\nOn loan at Inverness Caley Thistle from Rangers the club omitted to insert a clause to prevent him playing against Rangers. On 5th March 2005 he was instrumental in setting up the highlanders late equaliser at Ibrox. He left Rangers for Silkeborg IF at the end of that season and his career was mainly in the Danish top league, apart from a two year spell at Denizlispor. He is currently an academy coach at FC Nordsjaelland. Barjam became a youtube sensation with controversial his goal celebration.\n\nBajram Fetai’s Goal Celebration\n\nNorway – Thomas Kind Bendiksen – A bit a qualified success but ultimately a disappointment. Signed from Harstad IL and wrongly reported as a £1,000,000 fee in some quarters, when in fact it was 1,000,000 Norwegian Krone, around £90,000. Missing almost two complete seasons through injury and returning to action impressed at the end of that season.\n\nFurther injury problems saw him given a six month contract in July 2011, a goal and an impressive display in a friendly against SV Hamburg saw him enter the first team picture. A contract extension was offered but declined and he moved back to Norway with Tromso IL in January 2012. After a few seasons in the Norwegian top division he is now playing third tier football with Tromsdalen UIL.\n\nPoland – Kamil Wiktorski – Joining Rangers after a successful trial period from the Zawisza Bydgoszcz academy in 2009.\n\nHe was a regular in the youth team for a couple of seasons without threatening to make the breakthrough. Since leaving Rangers he has played with eight different Polish clubs, predominately in the second division, his current club being Chojniczanka Chojnice.\n\nPortugal – Umaro Balde – Recent recruit from the Sporting Lisbon academy the holding midfielder has settledin well and established in the Under 18’s squad.\n\nIt is rumoured there is in clause in his release from Sporting that prevented him joining Benfica or Porto.\n\nRussia – Sergey Kundik – Sergey featured in my last post on trialists so its a simple cut and paste job for me.\n\nIn February 2013 Russian-Portuguese attacker Sergey Kundik arrived on trial, born in Russia he moved to Portugal at the age of 9 and had been in the youth setups of Porto, Boavista and Spartak Moscow before arriving on trial at Rangers. He featured in three youth friendlies aganist Hearts, St. Johnstone and Dunfermline Athletic. I am pretty sure these were the only games he played in despite what it says on Wikipedia. He then joined the youth academy at Braga before playing lower league in Portugal, Cyprus and Greece. He is currently with GAS Ialysos 1948 in the Greek third tier.\n\nSerbia – Nikola Vujadinovic – Some may remember him playing for Aberdeen in 2010/11 season on loan from Udinese, but his first foray into Scottish football was in a Rangers jersey as an 18 year old in a friendly at Selkirk in July 2004. He had just left the academy of Red Star Belgrade and with Rangers not following up any interest he started the season at Rad Belgrade.\n\nHe then played in Montenegro and back to Serbia before signing for CSKA Sofia. Udinese then secured his services from the Bulgarian club for a reported €1,000,000, but he never made a top team appearance. He then became a bit of a football nomad playing for clubs in Romania, Scotland, Austria, Spain, China and Poland before arriving at his current club NK Domzale in Slovenia. Could have been an entry for Montenegro who he has represented at U21 level.\n\nSlovakia – Dominik Martisiak – Another covered in the previous post. Slovakian youth international attacker Dominik Martisiak made an appearance in December 2015 against Dundee United. His club at the time was FK Senica who were willing to sell. Rangers didn’t follow up and has since moved Banik Ostrava in Czech Republic, still only 19 he is on loan at second tier club MFK Vitkovice.\n\nSpain – Borja Lazaro – The striker had previously been at Atletico Madrid’s academy and appeared as a trialist in youth friendly 3-3 draw with Sunderland in August 2007. He did enough over his trial period to win a contract and was at Rangers for that season, he played sporadically in the reserve team scoring a handful of goals.\n\nOn leaving Rangers he joined Sporting Gijon B, since then he has been at an incredible twelve clubs in Spain. Two highlights stand out, he played in both legs of the LaLiga Promotion Playoff Semi Finals for SD Huesca when they lost out to Getafe CF in June 2017. In September 2014 playing for CD Leganes in a LaLiga 2 game against RCD Mallorca he grabbed a hat-trick scoring all the goals in his side’s 3-1 win. He is currently with third tier side Algeciras CF who he joined in January.\n\nSweden – Max Olsson – The Swedish youth International grabbed a hat-trick for Rangers Under 16’s in a 7-2 win over Partick Thistle in February 2016. I have to say I thought I would see the Malmo academy player at Rangers training ground again, but it wasn’t to be.\n\nHe left Malmo two years later and had a spell at second tier club IFK Varnamo in 2018 but is now at third tier side IF Sylvia.\n\nSwitzerland – Kevin Mbabu – One of the “Newcastle Five” he never made a first team appearance but played in reserve games and featured in the 2015 Youth Cup Final. Never really impressed in his time at the club and in my opinion looked a bit overweight. He joined Newcastle United in 2013 from Servette FC for an undisclosed fee.\n\nHe left Newcastle for Young Boys initially on loan, it took him a couple of months to break into the starting eleven, but by the end of the season he was established and the move became permanent. His career then took off and he really became an established player culminating in a transfer to Vfl Wolfsburg in April 2019 for a reported €8,000,000. He has six caps for Switzerland.\n\nTurkey – Isa Bagci – Born in Sweden and signed from Swedish club BK Hacken Isa represented Turkey at Under 19 level. Showed enough as a trialist to prompt a transfer and a contract, he was a fairly regular in the youth team but seemed a bit temperamental and his confidence and attitude could be up and down.\n\nHe was transferred to Bursaspor in August 2009 for an Undisclosed fee. He played with a variety of clubs in Turkey and Scandanavia hitting his peak with almost thirty Swedish second tier games at Qviding FIF in 2011. Hasn’t been in senior football since leaving Vastra Frolunda IF in January 2017.\n\nWell just a snapshot in reserve/youth players from across the continent, there are a few countries I could have made a different choice and highlighted someone else. Some big countries not on this list, Croatia is a big surprise considering our recent links with players from that country. Also Greece, Slovenia and Ukraine, lots of former eastern block countries and of course Europe’s minnows, Andorra and Lichtenstein for example.\n\nI am sure a lot of these blanks could be filled in, as I said around 50% of the trialists I have watched remain unknown and there are lots of games I didn’t attend. I hope you have found this of some interest."
