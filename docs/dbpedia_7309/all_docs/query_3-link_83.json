        "text": "The midfielder is currenlty playing for Real Sociedad in Spain's premier division, La Liga.\n\nBefore signing for Real Sociedad, Silva played for Manchester City, where he was part of a squad which won Premier League titles in 2011/12, 2013/14, 2017/18 and 2018/19. Prior to that, he made a name for himself at Valencia.\n\nSilva is best known for his ability as a playmaker who orchestrates attacks and creates goals for team-mates. He has been deployed on the wing as well as in midfield throughout the course of his career.\n\nA diminutive player who thrives off his skill rather than brute strength, he has been credited by Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola for thriving in a league which traditionally has had a physical style of play.\n\nSilva has reportedly drawn some degree of interest from Real Madrid and Barcelona in the past.\n\nCareer at Manchester City\n\nSilva signed for Manchester City from Valencia in 2010 while the English club was in the process of building a team to compete for Premier League and UEFA Champions League titles.\n\nSigned on a four-year deal initially, Silva was part of a squad overhaul under new manager Roberto Mancini.\n\nHis first season on the City books - 2010/11 - was Mancini's first full campaign in charge of City. He played as a winger initially and then as a 'trequartista' - an attacking midfielder.\n\nSilva made a significant impact at Manchester City from the get-go and played an instrumental role in the Citizens finishing third in the Premier League. They also won the FA Cup in that season - a sign of things to come.\n\nIn 2011/12, City were deadlocked in a fierce fight for the title with city rivals Manchester United. The Red Devils had traditionally been Manchester's dominant team, but Mancini's men were threatening to knock them off their perch.\n\nSilva was instrumental in helping City pip United to the Premier League title -- the club's first in 44 years.\n\nHe delivered an assist for Edin Dzeko in the decisive game of the season - a 3-2 win over Queens Park Rangers which ensured that the title went to the Etihad Stadium.\n\nDavid Silva, Manchester City, 2020\n\nSilva finished top of the assists table with 15 to his name and made the PFA Team of the Year.\n\nManchester United claimed revenge by winning the title at a canter in 2012/13, but the balance of power shifted after Sir Alex Ferguson left the club.\n\nRoberto Mancini was replaced by Manuel Pellegrini at City in 2013 and he led them to the league title in 2013/14, with Silva racking up eight goals and 16 assists in all competitions despite injuries. City pipped Liverpool and Chelsea to the title.\n\nA minor drought followed for Manchester City as Chelsea beat them to the title in 2014/15 and Leicester City stunned them and other big guns to claim it in 2015/16. At the end of the 2015/16 season, Pellegrini was replaced by Guardiola.\n\nInitially, Guardiola struggled to adapt to life in England as City finished some way off the pace in the 2016/17 title race, which was won by Chelsea.\n\nHowever, in 2017/18, City picked up a record 100 Premier League points to obliterate the chasing pack. Once again, Silva was a Premier League champion.\n\nHe followed that up with another title in 2018/19 and was instrumental in both Premier League successes under Guardiola.\n\nUnfortunately for Silva, his last season at City saw the club miss out on the Premier League title as Liverpool won it by some distance, but he was honoured as his club announced plans for a statue of him at the Etihad Stadium.\n\nTransfer to Real Sociedad\n\nDavid Silva looked set to sign for Lazio after leaving City, but ultimately ended up moving to Real Sociedad.\n\nThis drew criticism from Lazio director Igli Tare, who said: \"I learn about David Silva's transfer to Real Sociedad. I have great respect for the player, but not for the man.\"\n\nDavid Silva, Real Sociedad, 2020\n\nSilva shone early in the 2020/21 season for Real Sociedad, guiding them to the top of the table, albeit still with plenty of games still to play.\n\nInternational career with Spain\n\nDavid Silva was part of the great Spain side which won the UEFA European Championship in 2008 and then defended it in 2012, with a 2010 FIFA World Cup triumph sandwiched in between.\n\nHe started five of Spain's six matches at Euro 2008 and scored the last goal in their 3-0 win over Russia.\n\nAt the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Silva was limited to a bit-part role despite having played a crucial part in their qualification campaign.\n\nDavid Silva, Spain, 2018 World Cup\n\nHe started the 1-0 group stage defeat to Switzerland and then next played in the 1-0 semi-final win over Germany.\n\nSilva started all six matches in Spain's Euro 2012 campaign. His two goals and three assists made him the overall most efficient player in the tournament and he was named in UEFA's Team of the Tournament.\n\nHe picked up the joint most assists out of all players in the tournament.\n\nSilva announced his international retirement following the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia with 35 goals in 125 caps for Spain.\n\nPersonal life\n\nSilva missed several games midway through the 2017/18 season following the premature birth of his son, Mateo, who ultimately turned out to be healthy.\n\nHe expressed gratitude towards City boss Guardiola for allowing him to take a substantial amount of time off to attend to this family emergency at the expense of time spent on the football field.\n\nSilva is reportedly in a long-term relationship with Yessica Suarez Gonzalez.\n\nThe midfielder tested positive for COVID-19 on 31 August 2020. However, he recovered and was training with his Real Sociedad team-mates within two weeks.\n\nNet worth\n\nSilva was worth a reported $46million as per the Sunday Times Rich List in 2017. In 2018, Silva was signed as a brand ambassador by Puma. He is reported to be one of the world's wealthiest footballers."
