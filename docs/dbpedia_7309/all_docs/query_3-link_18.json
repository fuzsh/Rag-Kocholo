In 2008 the IIHF ranked Extraliga third among the top 7 European teams for seeding purposes in the 2008-2009 Champions Hockey League season.[1] Many Extraliga players leave every year on transfers to the North American NHL and Eurasian KHL.\n\n[]\n\nThe name of the league is leased to a general sponsor and changes frequently.\n\n1999-2000 – Staropramen Extraliga\n\n2001-2002 – Český Telecom Extraliga\n\n2003-2006 – Tipsport Extraliga\n\n2007-2010 – O2 Extraliga\n\n2010-current – Tipsport Extraliga\n\nLeague format[]\n\n14 teams compete in the league, with the top 6 teams at the end of the regular season play qualifying for the playoffs to determine the league champion, known as the Česká pojišťovna play-off Tipsport extraligy. The teams that finish 7th through 10th play a play-in series (best-of-five) to determine who will join the top six into the playoff quarter-finals (best-of-seven). The four lowest ranked teams (11–14) after the regular season play in a play-out goup (12 games, all regular-season matches are counted into the ranking). The last-place team after the play-out group plays with the winner of the First League playoff series (best-of-seven), with the winner of that series being qualified to play in Extraliga the following season while the losing team plays in the First League.\n\nSince the 2006-07 season, 3 points have been awarded for a regulation win and 2 points for an overtime victory, while the defeated team in overtime gets 1 point. If necessary, penalty shots are used to decide games after overtime.\n\nFrom the 2006-07 season through the 2007-08 season there was only one assist credited for each goal instead of the standard two that other leagues credit. This rule change affected league statistics in a negative manner, and so the rule was changed back to the standard two assists starting in the 2008-09 season.\n\nDuring the 2011-12 season the association of Czech Extraliga managers attempted to close the league to prevent any relegations to or promoting from the second tier national league and also set a maximum salary cap similarly to the NHL system. [2] However, after some legal difficulties and strong opposition by the public the whole proposition was scratched.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe league was founded in 1993, after the separation of Czechoslovakia put an end to the Czechoslovak First Ice Hockey League. The first season was won by HC Olomouc, who won after defeating HC Pardubice 3 games to 1. HC Slavia Praha and HC Dadák Vsetín were promoted from the First League after beating HC Stadion Hradec Králové and HC Vajgar Jindřichův Hradec in the qualifying series. The 1993-94 season was the only season Vajgar ever participated in the Extraliga, while Hradec Králové would return to the league some twenty years later as Mountfield HK.\n\nThe 1994-95 season marked the beginning of the Vsetín dynasty. In its first year in the league, HC Dadák Vsetín finished first in the regular season and later won the playoffs, beating AC ZPS Zlín 3 to 1. Vsetín would go on to win the next four installments of the Extraliga, with the team usually finishing first in the regular season as well. No team ever even came close to matching the feat of dominance that was shown by Vsetín throughout the second half of the 1990s.\n\nIn the 1995–96 season, the league expanded from 12 to 14 teams. This was the final expansion made to the league and 14 teams have been playing in the league eversince.\n\nThe 1998–99 season would be the last for one of the league's most traditional participants, HC Dukla Jihlava. The team lost the qualification series against HC Znojemsti Orli. Dukla later appeared in the 2004–05 installment of the Czech Extraliga, putting up a non-impressive 6-0-5-40 record and were relegated that same season.\n\nIn the 1999–2000 season, HC Sparta Praha broke Vsetín's five year long winning streak, defeating them in the finals. This was the only time Vsetín was defeated in the finals, as they would get their revenge and beat Sparta in the finals a season later. The 2000-01 season was the last time Vsetín managed to advance to the finals, and the team began falling further down in the standings every season.\n\nSparta won their second title in the 2001–02 season. The title would stay in Prague the next season as well, however, this time Sparta's main rival, Slavia, won the title. The title would then be won by Hamé Zlín (2003–04 season) and HC Moeller Pardubice (2004-05 season) before one of the Prague teams captured it again.\n\nFor the first and only time, Sparta and Slavia would appear in the finals in the 2005–06 season. Sparta was the more successful team out of the pair, triumphing over Slavia 4 games to 2. Sparta would win the cup in the next season as well, this time defeating the 2004-05 champion Pardubice in 6 games.\n\nVsetín's run in the Extraliga would come to an end after the 2006–07 season. The Czech Ice Hockey Federation would revoke the club's extraliga license due to the team's enormous debt, forcing them to fold. As a result, no other teams were relegated that season and the First League champions, HC Slovan Ústečtí Lvi, were automatically promoted to the Extraliga. The 2007–08 season was the only season Slovan ever appeared in the Extraliga, as they were relegated back to the First League at the end of the season.\n\nSince the 2006–07 season, 3 points have been awarded for a regulation win and 2 points for an overtime victory, while the defeated team in overtime gets 1 point. If necessary, penalty shots are used to decide games after overtime. Also from the 2006–07 season through the 2007–08 season there was only one assist credited for each goal instead of the standard two that other leagues credit. This rule change affected league statistics in a negative manner, and so the rule was changed back to the standard two assists starting in the 2008–09 season.\n\nSlavia Prague would defeat HC Energie Karlovy Vary in the finals in the 2007–08 season. The same teams appeared in the finals a year later, this time with the opposite outcome. Pardubice then captured its second and third title in the 2009–10 and 2011–12 season, respectively. HC Oceláři Třinec won their first title in the 2010–11 season.\n\nThe first open-air hockey game since the 1960s took place during the 2010-11 season in Pardubice. The attendance for this game was record breaking, with 17 140 people in the crowd. The home team squared off against HC Kometa Brno, for whom this was the first season back in the Extraliga since 1995. Pardubice won this game 4-2.\n\nHC Mountfield České Budějovice was forced to sell its license after the 2012–13 season, due to an interesting dispute. At the end of the season, Extraliga announced that Radegast would be the new beer sponsor for the league. However, Mountfield had a naming rights agreement with Budweiser Budvar Brewery at the time, and would therefore be unable to sell any other kind of beer at their stadium. As a result of Extraliga and the club not being able to reach an agreement, the team sold its license to Hradec Králové, thus forming Mountfield HK.\n\nCurrent teams[]\n\nTeam City Arena Capacity Kometa Brno Brno Kajot Arena 7,200 Mountfield České Budějovice České Budějovice Budvar Arena 6,421 Piráti Chomutov Chomutov ČEZ Stadion Chomutov 5,050 Energie Karlovy Vary Karlovy Vary KV Arena 6,000 Rytíři Kladno Kladno Zimní Kladno Stadion 8,600 Bílí Tygři Liberec Liberec Tipsport Arena 7,500 Verva Litvínov Litvínov Ivan Hlinka Stadion 7,000 ČSOB Pojišťovna Pardubice Pardubice ČEZ Aréna (Pardubice) 10,194 HC Škoda Plzeň Plzeň ČEZ Aréna (Plzeň) 8,420 Slavia Praha Prague O2 Arena 17,360 Sparta Praha Prague Tipsport Arena 13,995 Oceláři Třinec Třinec Werk Arena 5,200 Vítkovice Steel Ostrava ČEZ Aréna (Ostrava) 9,551 PSG Zlín Zlín Zimní stadion Luďka Čajky 7,500\n\nPast champions[]\n\nby Year[]\n\nYear Winner 2nd place 3rd place 1994 HC Olomouc HC Pardubice Poldi SONP Kladno 1995 HC Dadák Vsetín AC ZPS Zlín HC České Budějovice 1996 HC Petra Vsetín HC Chemopetrol Litvínov HC Sparta Praha 1997 HC Petra Vsetín HC Vítkovice Steel HC Sparta Praha 1998 HC Slovnaft Vsetín HC Železárny Třinec HC Vítkovice Steel 1999 HC Slovnaft Vsetín HC ZPS Barum Zlín HC Železárny Třinec 2000 HC Sparta Praha HC Slovnaft Vsetín HC Keramika Plzen 2001 VHK Vsetín HC Sparta Praha HC Vítkovice Steel 2002 HC Sparta Praha HC Vítkovice Steel HC Hamé Zlín 2003 HC Slavia Praha HC Pardubice HC Sparta Praha 2004 HC Hamé Zlín HC Slavia Praha HC Sparta Praha 2005 HC Moeller Pardubice HC Hamé Zlín HC Bílí Tygři Liberec 2006 HC Sparta Praha HC Slavia Praha HC Znojmo 2007 HC Sparta Praha HC Moeller Pardubice HC Liberec 2008 HC Slavia Praha Energie Karlovy Vary HC Mountfield České Budějovice 2009 Energie Karlovy Vary HC Slavia Praha HC Sparta Praha 2010 HC Eaton Pardubice HC Vítkovice Steel HC Slavia Praha 2011 HC Oceláři Třinec HC Vítkovice Steel HC Eaton Pardubice 2012 HC ČSOB Pojišťovna Pardubice HC Kometa Brno HC Škoda Plzeň 2013 HC Škoda Plzeň PSG Zlín HC Slavia Praha 2014 PSG Zlín HC Kometa Brno HC Sparta Praha 2015 HC Verva Litvínov HC Oceláři Třinec HC Kometa Brno 2016 HC Bílí Tygři Liberec HC Sparta Praha HC Škoda Plzeň\n\nby Club[]\n\nClub Winners Runners-up Winning Years VHK Vsetín 6 1 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2001 HC Sparta Praha 4 2 2000, 2002, 2006, 2007 HC Pardubice 3 3 2005, 2010, 2012 HC Slavia Praha 2 3 2003, 2008 PSG Zlín 2 4 2004, 2014 HC Oceláři Třinec 1 2 2011 Energie Karlovy Vary 1 1 2009 HC Verva Litvínov 1 1 2015 HC Liberec 1 0 2016 HC Olomouc 1 0 1994 HC Škoda Plzeň 1 0 2013\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nCzech Extraliga official website\n\nHokej iDNES.cz\n\nEuropean Ice Hockey Leagues International leagues\n\nAlps Hockey League - Balkan Ice Hockey League - BeNe League - Kontinental Hockey League - MOL Liga\n\nNational leagues\n\nArmenia - Austria - Belarus - Belgium - Bosnia and Herzegovina - Bulgaria - Croatia - Czech Republic - Denmark - Estonia - Finland - France - Georgia - Germany - Greece - Hungary - Iceland - Italy - Kazakhstan - Latvia - Lithuania - Luxembourg - Macedonia - Netherlands - Norway - Poland - Romania - Serbia - Slovakia - Slovenia - Spain - Sweden - Switzerland - Turkey - Ukraine - United Kingdom\n\nDefunct leagues\n\nSoviet Union - Russia - Czechoslovakia - Yugoslavia - West Germany - East Germany - Ireland - Luxembourg - Malta - Portugal - Alpenliga - Interliga - Inter-National League - North Sea Cup - Panonian League - Eastern European - Balkan League - Baltic League - Carpathian League - Slohokej Liga"
