        "text": "Archives\n\nStrong group in Women’s high-class league\n\nThe Women’s European Champions League draw held this morning at Ostrava gathered top seed and main candidate for the title, Turkish Fenerbahce Sport Club will share super-strong Group A with 2011/12 finalists, TTC Berlin Eastside and SVS STROCK, while fou\n\nThe Women’s European Champions League draw held this morning at Ostrava gathered top seed and main candidate for the title, Turkish Fenerbahce Sport Club will share super-strong Group A with 2011/12 finalists, TTC Berlin Eastside and SVS STROCK, while fourth team in that group is newcomer from France, Metz TT.\n\nGroup B contains reigning champion Linz AG Froschberg, no. 3 seed, Polish KTS Zamek Tarnobrzeg, Russian Tyumen and 2012/13 WECL finalist Budaorsi 2i SC.\n\nThe new season, no doubt – best ever, starts in early September (6-9th) and the first matches are: Fenerbahce – STROCK, Berlin.– Metz, Froschberg – Tyumen and Tarnobrzeg – Budaorsi. After the sixth round (December 20th) two best clubs from each group are continuing to the semi finals.\n\nThe most interesting game of opening round should be one at Istanbul where the best Turkish club Fenerbahce expects two times Austrian champion SVS STROCK. On the home side: Viktoria PAVLOVICH – two times (2010, 2012) individual gold medalist of European Championships and current champion of Old Continent, Elisabeta SAMARA – two times quarter finalist of ECH, and HU Melek – the 2010 EC individual bronze medalist. The guests have also three very good players: Daniela DODEAN – two times ECH quarter finalist (2007, 2012), Petra LOVAS – the 2007 ECH quarter finalist, and Tetyana BILENKO – one of biggest surprises of recent 2013 LIEBHERR World Championships at Paris, where she play in Round of 16.\n\n“This Champions League will be thrilling from the very first match up to the end. I saw six clubs at the highest level, against three of them we have to compete in the first round”, stressed after the draw SVS STROCK`s manager Martin SOROS replaying on the question about Round 1: “The number four of Istanbul is placed in the world rankings before our number one. But it should not sound unusual when I say: Yes, we do have our chance. Or let’s say so. If Fenerbahce must fear a team most in the upcoming season, I’m definitively sure we are the one”.\n\nTitle-holder Linz, with same line-up as in winning year, opens new WECL chapter at home against Tyumen (Oxana FEDEEVA, Polina MIKHAILOVA, Ruta PASKAUSKIENE, Veronika PAVLOVICH). This clash provides two former individual European champions, Froschberg`s LIU Jia (2005) and Tyumen`s Ruta PASKAUSKIENE (2008).\n\nView here the group round draw\n\nAlex MILETIC, EWT, Alex MILETIC, EWT"
