        "text": "2011-12 WHL EASTERN CONFERENCE PREVIEW\n\nCalgary, AB – The Western Hockey League’s 46th season begins on Thursday, September 22nd, as fans gear up to cheer for their favorite team through another exciting winter of WHL hockey.\n\nThe Kootenay Ice are the defending WHL champions, having defeated the Portland Winterhawks in five games to capture the Ed Chynoweth Cup in May. Will Kootenay be able to fend off the competition and make another run for the championship? Or, will a different team emerge as the Eastern Conference’s elite?\n\nThis year, fans can enjoy watching some of the most exciting blue line prospects in the League, including Red Deer’s Matt Dumba, the reigning WHL Rookie of the Year, Moose Jaw’s smooth-skating Morgan Rielly, and Edmonton’s tower of strength Griffin Reinhart. All three could hear their names called very early in the 2012 NHL Entry Draft.\n\nWhich team will emerge as the Beasts of the East during the 2011-12 WHL regular season? Which players will stand out and rise to star status this season?\n\nHere’s a look at the WHL Eastern Conference:\n\nEast Division\n\nBrandon Wheat Kings\n\nGeneral Manager: Kelly McCrimmon\n\nHead Coach: Cory Clouston\n\n2011 pre-season: 1-3-0-0, 2pts\n\n2010-11 Record: 32-31-1-8, 73pts (3rd in East Div., 6th in Eastern Conf.) GF: 281 GA: 275\n\n2010-11 Power Play / Penalty Killing ranking: PP: 23.2% (3rd); PK: 74.9% (21st)\n\n2011 Playoffs: Lost in six games to Medicine Hat in first round\n\n2010-11 Top Scorers:\n\nMark Stone 71gp-37g-69a-106pts\n\nScott Glennie 70gp-35g-56a-91pts\n\nMatt MacKay 71gp-29g-51a-80pts\n\nUp Front: Mark Stone finished tied for third in WHL scoring last season as an 18-year-old. The Ottawa Senators prospect will be counted on to put up more big offensive totals for the Wheat Kings this season. 19-year-olds Michael Ferland and Brendan Walker both put up respectable numbers in secondary scoring roles last year for the Wheat Kings. Both will need to take on more of the offensive load this season after the Wheat Kings graduated three of their top four scorers from last season. Swiss rookie Alessio Bertaggia has shown some offensive skill through pre-season, and could be a contributor to the team’s attack this season.\n\nOn The Blue Line: The Wheat Kings can return six regulars on the blue line from last season, including impressive 17-year-old Ryan Pulock. The Grandview, MB, product quietly put up eight goals and 42 points as a 16-year-old, and will be a key component in the Wheaties’ defense corps this season. Also back is veteran Brodie Melnychuk and sophomores Eric Roy and Jordan Fransoo, who will all look to help the team reduce its goals-against and improve upon what was the 21st-ranked penalty killing unit last season. Rookie Ayrton Nikkel has impressed in pre-season play, and could add to the Wheat Kings’ defense corps this season.\n\nGoaltending: Corbin Boes and Liam Liston split time in the Wheat Kings’ net as rookies last season. Boes posted a 3.44 GAA in 33 starts last season while Liston earned 20 wins though his 41 starts. Both return to provide the Wheat Kings with a capable tandem in goal.\n\nPlayer to Watch: Ryan Pulock\n\nPulock enjoyed a tremendous season as a 16-year-old rookie last year, scoring eight goals and 42 points in 63 games. The Grandview, MB, native, who was a seventh-round bantam draft pick in 2009, led all Wheat Kings defensemen in scoring and also performed well for Team West at the 2011 World Under-17 Challenge. A good skater with excellent vision, a low panic level and strength at both ends of the ice, Pulock will be an important factor in any success the Wheat Kings enjoy this season.\n\nMoose Jaw Warriors\n\nDirector, Hockey Operations: Alan Millar\n\nHead Coach: Mike Stothers\n\n2011 pre-season: 6-1-0-0, 12pts\n\n2010-11 Record: 40-26-2-4, 86pts (2nd in East Div., 5th in Eastern Conf.) GF: 245 GA: 240\n\n2010-11 Power Play / Penalty Killing ranking: PP: 17.7% (16th); PK: 81.8% (8th)\n\n2011 Playoffs: Lost in six games to Kootenay in first round\n\n2010-11 Top Scorers:\n\nDylan Hood 71gp-33g-50a-83pts\n\nQuinton Howden 60gp-40g-39a-79pts\n\nSpencer Edwards 63gp-27g-39a-66pts\n\nUp Front: The Warriors could return three of their top five scorers from last season, including 19-year-old Quinton Howden. Howden scored 40 goals in just 60 games last season, and also starred for Team Canada at the 2011 World Junior Championships. If he doesn’t stick in the NHL with the Florida Panthers, expect Howden to be one of the WHL’s marquee players this season for the Warriors. St. Louis Blues prospect Cody Beach and Swiss rookie Eric Arnold should factor into the Warriors’ offensive attack while veteran Sebastian Svendsen will also provide plenty of scoring for what should be a strong Warriors offense.\n\nOn The Blue Line: The Warriors return up to six rearguards from last year’s team that boasted the fifth-best defensive record in the Eastern Conference. 20-year-old veteran Collin Bowman and 19-year-old Dylan McIlrath provide the Warriors with solid defensive play, size and toughness while Joel Edmundson, Dallas Ehrhardt and Kendall McFaull all stand at least 6’2” and add more defensive strength to what should be a very good Warriors’ blue line. 17-year-old Morgan Rielly, a possible high pick in next year’s NHL draft, will look to build on his solid rookie season last year. Rielly should be able to improve upon the six goals and 28 points he put up as a 16-year-old last season.\n\nGoaltending: The graduation of veteran Thomas Heemskerk will leave big shoes to fill in the Warriors net. 18-year-old Brandon Stone is back after posting a 4-5 record in 15 starts last season while 17-year-old rookie Spencer Tremblay looks to take a spot on the roster as well. The Warriors acquired 20-year-old Deven Dubyk from Medicine Hat during the pre-season.\n\nPlayer to Watch: Morgan Rielly\n\nOne of several blue-chip defensemen eligible for the 2011 NHL Entry Draft, Rielly looks to take on a key role on the Warriors’ blue line this season after a very good rookie season last year. The 17-year-old from Vancouver, B.C., possesses tremendous poise and patience with the puck, making him a strong presence on the power play. Rielly has also developed his defensive game to become a reliable presence in his own zone. Having dominated for Team Canada at the Memorial for Ivan Hlinka tournament in August, many expect Rielly to continue turning heads for the Warriors this season.\n\nPrince Albert Raiders\n\nGeneral Manager / Head Coach: Bruno Campese\n\n2011 pre-season: 3-1-0-0, 6pts\n\n2010-11 Record: 31-36-2-3, 67pts (4th in East Div., 8th in Eastern Conf.) GF: 247 GA: 283\n\n2010-11 Power Play / Penalty Killing ranking: PP: 18.8% (14th); PK: 79.0% (14th)\n\n2011 Playoffs: Lost in six games to Saskatoon in first round\n\n2010-11 Top Scorers:\n\nJonathan Parker 71gp-45g-41a-86pts\n\nMark McNeill 70gp-32g-49a-81pts\n\nJustin Maylan 66gp-21g-48a-69pts\n\nUp Front: The Raiders could return a powerful offensive group this season, with six of their top seven scorers from last season eligible to come back. 18-year-old Mark McNeill is coming off a 32-goal season as a sophomore, leading the Chicago Blackhawks to take him in the first round of the 2011 NHL draft. McNeill will surely be a big contributor for the Raiders this season. 20-year-olds Jonathan Parker, Brandon Herrod and Justin Maylan are all eligible to come back. With 45 goals last season, Parker could be one of the WHL’s top goal-scorers again this season. 18-year-old Todd Fiddler will look for a bigger offensive role this season after netting 23 goals as a rookie last year, while 17-year-old Mike Winther will be counted on to increase his production in his sophomore campaign.\n\nOn The Blue Line: Veteran Antoine Corbin heads up a group of six rearguards eligible to return to the club this season. Corbin, a 19-year-old, led the Raiders’ defense corps with eight goals and 29 points last season. Also back are 18-year-old Harrison Ruopp, who was drafted by Phoenix in the third round of the 2011 NHL draft, and sophomores Austin Bourhis, Mathew Berry-Lamontagna and Tyler Yaworski. With another year of experience under their belts, it will be up to the returning Raiders’ rearguards to help reduce the team’s goals-against from the 283 they allowed last season. Rookies Sawyer Lange and Josh Morrissey will look to break into the Raiders’ defense corps this season, too.\n\nGoaltending: 18-year-old Eric Williams returns to take the starting job with the Raiders. Williams appeared in 40 games for the team last season, posting 17 wins and a .898 save percentage, and has shown he is capable of taking the top netminding job. Joining Williams is fellow 18-year-old Cole Holowenko. Acquired from the Victoria Royals last season, Holowenko will look to push Williams for playing time.\n\nPlayer to Watch: Mike Winther\n\nThe Raiders’ first-round pick, sixth overall, in 2009, Winther potted nine goals as a 16-year-old rookie last season. A skilled offensive player with good attacking instincts, Winther also boasts a high energy level and strong work ethic. Although his offensive game is his strength, Winther has shown he can assume any role assigned to him. His physical and energetic play for Team Pacific at the 2011 World Under-17 Challenge showed his adaptability on the ice. Entering his NHL draft-eligible season, expect Winther to assume a larger role in the Raiders’ offensive plans in 2011-12.\n\nRegina Pats\n\nGeneral Manager: Chad Lang\n\nHead Coach: Pat Conacher\n\n2011 pre-season: 3-3-0-0, 6pts\n\n2010-11 Record: 23-39-7-3, 56pts (5th in East Div., 10th in Eastern Conf.) GF: 216 GA: 312\n\n2010-11 Power Play / Penalty Killing ranking: PP: 16.0% (18th); PK: 74.7% (22nd)\n\n2011 Playoffs: Did not qualify\n\n2010-11 Top Scorers:\n\nJordan Weal 72gp-43g-53a-96pts\n\nGarrett Mitchell 70gp-18g-34a-52pts\n\nBrandon Davidson 72gp-8g-43a-51pts\n\nUp Front: Jordan Weal will head up a Pats offense that is looking to improve upon what was the 17th-ranked attack in the WHL last season. The dynamic Weal, a Los Angeles Kings prospect, has put up 269 points over the last three seasons, and should find himself among the WHL’s leading scorers again this season. Veteran Lane Scheidl put up 30 points in 48 games after coming to the Pats in a trade last season, and will look for more production this season. Sophomore Chandler Stephenson and Czech rookie Dominik Volek will also be counted on to provide offense for the Pats. Talented rookies Jack Rodewald, who led the team with five pre-season goals, and Morgan Klimchuk could also add depth in the Pats’ offensive plans.\n\nOn The Blue Line: The Pats finished 22nd in the WHL in goals-against last year, having allowed 312 goals in 72 games. With potentially four rearguards returning from last year, plus the influx of some newcomers, the Pats will be aiming to reduce their goals-against considerably this season. Brandon Davidson led the Pats in scoring from the blue line with 51 points. The team hopes Davidson returns from pro camp, as he would be a key fixture on the blue line this season. Fellow 20-year-old Art Bidlevskii could also return, giving the team toughness and a physical presence. Sophomore Ricard Blidstrand and off-season acquisition Brandon Underwood add skill and puck-moving ability to the Pats’ back end.\n\nGoaltending: With veteran Damien Ketlo having been moved to Lethbridge, sophomore Matt Hewitt takes over as the Pats’ starting netminder. The 18-year-old from New Westminster, B.C., posted a 12-14-0-1 record in 32 appearances as a rookie last year, and has been very good in pre-season this year. 17-year-old rookies Teagan Sacher and Adam Beukeboom are battling for the back-up role.\n\nPlayer to Watch: Chandler Stephenson\n\nThe 5th overall pick from the 2009 WHL Bantam Draft, Stephenson enjoyed a solid season as a 16-year-old rookie for the Pats in 2010-11. The product of Saskatoon, SK, scored seven goals and 19 points in 60 games last year, and has been strong through the 2011 WHL pre-season. A skilled and speedy forward with an accurate and deceptive shot, Stephenson will look to take on a bigger role in the offensive plans for the Pats this season. Eligible for the 2012 NHL draft, expect Stephenson to step up his play and help get the Pats back into the playoffs.\n\nSaskatoon Blades\n\nGeneral Manager / Head Coach: Lorne Molleken\n\n2011 pre-season: 2-2-0-1, 5pts\n\n2010-11 Record: 56-13-1-2, 115pts (1st in East Div., 1st in Eastern Conf.) GF: 310 GA: 213\n\n2010-11 Power Play / Penalty Killing ranking: PP: 21.4% (8th); PK: 82.4% (6th)\n\n2011 Playoffs: Lost in four games to Kootenay in second round\n\n2010-11 Top Scorers:\n\nMarek Viedensky 63gp-36g-52a-88pts\n\nJosh Nicholls 71gp-34g-53a-87pts\n\nCurtis Hamilton 62gp-26g-56a-82pts\n\nUp Front: The Blades lose many of their veteran forwards who helped the team share the best offensive output in the WHL last year. Making up for the 115 goals scored by Marek Viedensky, Curtis Hamilton, Stefan Elliott and Brayden Schenn won’t be easy. Fortunately, the Blades return high-scoring forward Josh Nicholls and veteran Chris Collins, who will both be counted on to provide offense. 20-year-olds Jake Trask and Darian Dziurzynski are also eligible to return, which would add even more offensive depth. Sophomore Matej Stransky should be able to improve upon his 14 goals while Brent Benson will also be counted on to step up and take on a bigger role this season. Second-year forwards Ryan Olsen and Lukas Sutter also expect to play bigger roles this season.\n\nOn The Blue Line: The departure of veterans Stefan Elliott and Teigan Zahn opens the door for a new group of leaders on the Blades’ blue line. 18-year-old Duncan Siemens, a first-round pick by Colorado in the 2011 NHL Draft, is ready to assume a top role on the Blades’ blue line. The Sherwood Park, AB, product is an intimidating physical and defensive presence, and can also generate offense. Also returning are sophomore Darren Dietz and veterans Connor Cox and Dalton Thrower, who all possess good two-way abilities. 18-year-old Kyle Schmidt was acquired from Calgary during the pre-season to add defensive depth.\n\nGoaltending: The graduation of Steven Stanford leaves 20-year-old Adam Morrison as the likely candidate for the starting job this season. Morrison, a former Philadelphia Flyers draft pick, has 79 games of WHL experience under his belt, and has proven he can be relied upon in the Blades’ cage. 18-year-old Russian Andrey Makarov, who played in the QMJHL with Lewiston last season, has been impressive during pre-season. Makarov and Morrison give the Blades a solid duo in goal.\n\nPlayer to Watch: Matej Stransky\n\nHaving lost a few of their top offensive players from last season, the Blades will need some more contributions from their returnees. Stransky is a prime candidate to take on a bigger role in the Blades’ attack. The Ostrava, CZ, product is a big presence who is difficult to knock off the puck, and boasts strong puck skills and hockey sense. Drafted by Dallas in the sixth round of the 2011 NHL Entry Draft, Stransky should be able to improve on the 14 goals and 26 points he netted last season.\n\nSwift Current Broncos\n\nGeneral Manager / Head Coach: Mark Lamb\n\n2011 pre-season: 2-4-1-0, 5pts\n\n2010-11 Record: 26-44-0-2, 54pts (6th in East Div., 11th in Eastern Conf.) GF: 181 GA: 260\n\n2010-11 Power Play / Penalty Killing ranking: PP: 17.1% (17th); PK: 81.8% (T-8th)\n\n2011 Playoffs: Did not qualify\n\n2010-11 Top Scorers:\n\nJustin Dowling 63gp-20g-47a-67pts\n\nBrad Hoban 71gp-25g-26a-51pts\n\nTaylor Vause 62gp-18g-29a-47pts\n\nUp Front: The Broncos will be looking to increase their offensive output from the 181 goals they scored last season which ranked 20th in the WHL. Three of their top five scorers from last season are eligible to return, including Adam Lowry, who was a third-round pick of the Winnipeg Jets in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft. Lowry provides a big, physical presence and will look to better the 18 goals and 45 points he recorded last season. 20-year-olds Taylor Vause and Brad Hoban are also eligible to come back. Both will be counted on to provide scoring and leadership. 17-year-old rookie Coda Gordon impressed during pre-season play, and could add depth to the Broncos’ offense if he finds himself on the opening-night roster. 18-year-old Graham Black is another forward the Broncos hope can help out their offense.\n\nOn The Blue Line: Led by 18-year-old Reece Scarlett, the Broncos can return up to six rearguards from last season. Scarlett, a New Jersey Devils prospect, is the leading point-getter among the team’s returning blue liners, and will be counted on to play a much larger role this season. Czech defenseman Richard Nedomlel will also be looked upon to carry a heavy workload this season as the Broncos aim to shave down from the 260 goals they allowed last season. Veterans Dalton Reum, Jordan Evans, Graham Craig and Tanner Muth are also back, with only Craig and Evans boasting over 100 games of WHL experience. Rookies Dillon Heatherington, the team’s first-round pick in 2010, and Bobby Zinkan have shown they can play at the WHL level, and could push one of the returning vets for a full-time spot.\n\nGoaltending: The Broncos’ goaltending situation took a hit with the departure of Steffen Soberg, the team’s first-round pick from the 2011 CHL Import Draft. The loss of Soberg leaves sophomore Austin Smith and rookie Steven Myland as the go-to guys in net for the Broncos. Smith got into 11 games last season as a 17-year-old playing behind veteran Mark Friesen, and has been good in pre-season action. Myland was acquired from Kootenay in the Cody Eakin trade last year.\n\nPlayer to Watch: Adam Lowry\n\nThe Broncos will need offense this season, and Adam Lowry is a top candidate to fill a first-line role for the Club. Selected by the Winnipeg Jets in the third round of the 2011 NHL Draft, Lowry is a big, energetic power forward who plays physical, is defensively responsible, and can provide offense. The son of former Calgary Hitmen coach Dave Lowry, Adam Lowry should be able to improve on the 18 goals he scored last season while also continuing to play his high-energy, rambunctious style. If the Broncos are to make a push for the playoffs, Lowry will need to be a key factor.\n\nCentral Division\n\nCalgary Hitmen\n\nGeneral Manager: Kelly Kisio\n\nHead Coach: Mike Williamson\n\n2011 pre-season: 5-1-0-0, 10pts\n\n2010-11 Record: 20-47-3-2, 45pts (6th in Central Div., 12th in Eastern Conf.) GF: 171 GA: 271\n\n2010-11 Power Play / Penalty Killing ranking: PP: 15.8% (20th); PK: 79.9% (10th)\n\n2011 Playoffs: Did not qualify\n\n2010-11 Top Scorers:\n\nKris Foucault 65gp-25g-23a-48pts\n\nJustin Kirsch 66gp-25g-17a-42pts\n\nBrooks Macek 63gp-13g-28a-41pts\n\nUp Front: The lowest scoring team in the WHL last season, the Hitmen will have to generate much more offense this season if they are to get themselves back into the post-season. Fortunately, they return six of their top seven scorers from last season, and they will all be looking to rebound from a difficult 2010-11 season. 19-year-old Justin Kirsch is back after sharing the team lead with 25 goals last year. Also back is playmaker Brooks Macek, who has proven offensive skills in the WHL. Veterans Jimmy Bubnick and Cody Sylvester will be looking to bounce back from trying seasons last year, while off-season acquisition Brady Brassart will also greatly bolster the offense. If Swedish star Victor Rask ends up in Calgary, he will make a huge impact offensively for the Hitmen.\n\nOn The Blue Line: The Hitmen return six defensemen from last year’s roster, led by veteran Ben Wilson. The 20-year-old Calgarian will head up what is a younger but talented defense corps. 19-year-old Spencer Humphries and 18-year-olds Peter Kosterman, Jaynen Rissling and Alex Roach all bring plenty of size to the Hitmen blue line. 17-year-old Keaton Lubin should see more responsibility this season after getting into 36 games as a rookie last year. Although their penalty killing was strong last season, the Hitmen will need to improve their 20th-ranked power play if they are to move up the standings. More offense from their defense corps would be beneficial in improving the man advantage.\n\nGoaltending: The battle for the starting job in Calgary’s net is heated. Veterans Mike Snider and Brandon Glover split the majority of the workload last year. However, the Hitmen acquired 17-year-old Chris Driedger from Tri-Cities during the off-season to push the incumbents for a roster spot. Driedger showed great potential as Drew Owsley’s back-up last year.\n\nPlayer to Watch: Brady Brassart\n\nThe Hitmen were searching for offense after finishing 22nd in the WHL in goals-for last season. They found scoring help when they acquired 18-year-old Brady Brassart from Spokane during the off-season. A former second-round pick of the Chiefs in 2008, Brassart scored eight goals and 32 points for the Chiefs last season as a 17-year-old. Primarily a playmaker, Brassart is a good skater with strong offensive instincts. Already a strong puck distributor and hard worker, Brassart can also shoot the puck well, making him a dependable forward, overall.\n\nEdmonton Oil Kings\n\nGeneral Manager: Bob Green\n\nHead Coach: Derek Laxdal\n\n2011 pre-season: 2-3-0-0, 4pts\n\n2010-11 Record: 31-34-2-5, 69pts (4th in Central Div., 7th in Eastern Conf.) GF: 249 GA: 252\n\n2010-11 Power Play / Penalty Killing ranking: PP: 15.9% (19th); PK: 79.3% (T-11th)\n\n2011 Playoffs: Lost in four game to Red Deer in first round\n\n2010-11 Top Scorers:\n\nDylan Wruck 71gp-38g-40a-78pts\n\nMichael St. Croix 68gp-27g-48a-75pts\n\nJordan Hickmott 72gp-28g-38a-66pts\n\nUp Front: The Oil Kings made great strides last year, offensively, with the team setting a franchise record for goals in a season with 249. Most of the team’s top offensive stars will be back this season, meaning expectations are as high as they have been in the four-year history of the team. 18-year-olds Dylan Wruck and Michael St. Croix combined for 65 goals and 153 points last season. Both could find themselves among the WHL’s scoring leaders this season. Also back are Josh Lazowski, TJ Foster and Kristians Pelss, who are all capable of hitting the 20-goal mark. Look for talented rookie Curtis Lazar to make an impact offensively this season. The second overall pick from the 2010 WHL Bantam Draft, Lazar appeared in six regular-season games and four playoff contests as a 15-year-old last season.\n\nOn The Blue Line: The Oil Kings return a strong group of defensemen, led by the trio of Mark Pysyk, Keegan Lowe and Griffin Reinhart. Pysyk led the Oil Kings’ defense corps with 40 points last season, while Lowe boasted a team-best +33 rating. Reinhart was a dominant force as a 16-year-old last season, though he missed a large part of the season due to injury. Expect Reinhart to take on a big role at both ends of the rink for the Oil Kings this season. Towering Slovakian Martin Gernat should also make a big impact as a two-way presence this season. With a good blend of size, mobility and skill, the Oil Kings should be able to reduce their goals-against from the 252 they allowed last season.\n\nGoaltending: Both Laurent Brossoit and Jon Groenheyde return to the team, providing two solid options in goal for the Oil Kings. Groenheyde has 94 games of WHL experience under his belt, including 34 games with the Oil Kings last year after coming over from Kamloops. Brossoit, who was drafted by the Calgary Flames in 2011, posted a 13-12-2 record with two shutouts in 34 games for the Oil Kings last season, and has shown he can be a dependable starter. 16-year-old talent Tristan Jarry is also in the mix looking for a roster spot.\n\nPlayer to Watch: Griffin Reinhart\n\nOne of three Reinhart brothers playing in the WHL, Griffin Reinhart is considered one of the top defensive prospects in the WHL ahead of the 2012 NHL Entry Draft. At 6’4”, 202 lbs, Reinhart is an intimidating presence on the ice who can play a tough, physical game. Yet, as good as he is defensively, Reinhart is also an effortless skater and a great puck mover who can play on the power play and generate offense. After missing a large portion of his rookie season to injury, look for Reinhart to make a big impact on the Oil Kings’ blue line as a sophomore this year.\n\nKootenay Ice\n\nGeneral Manager: Jeff Chynoweth\n\nHead Coach: Kris Knoblauch\n\n2011 pre-season: 1-4-0-0, 2pts\n\n2010-11 Record: 46-21-1-4, 97pts (3rd in Central Div., 4th in Eastern Conf.) GF: 272 GA: 218\n\n2010-11 Power Play / Penalty Killing ranking: PP: 21.8% (T-6th); PK: 79.3% (T-11th)\n\n2011 Playoffs: 2011 WHL Champions (Defeated Portland in five games in WHL Championship series)\n\n2010-11 Top Scorers:\n\nCody Eakin 56gp-36g-47a-83pts\n\nMax Reinhart 71gp-34g-45a-79pts\n\nKevin King 68gp-33g-43a-76pts\n\nUp Front: Though many of the veteran forwards from last year’s championship team have moved on, the Ice return several players who are more than capable of putting up offensive numbers. Max Reinhart, the team’s leading returning scorer, will head up the attack, and could very well find himself among the top scorers in the WHL this season. Also returning are 20-year-olds Joe Antilla and Jesse Ismond. Antilla scored 21 goals last season while Ismond netted 49 points. Both could be key components of the Ice offense should they survive the overage cut-down. 19-year-olds Elgin Pearce and Drew Czerwonka are both capable of providing offense. 16-year-old Sam Reinhart, the younger brother of Max Reinhart, boasts excellent offensive skills and vision.\n\nOn The Blue Line: The Ice’s blue line will have a big hole with the departure of Brayden McNabb to the professional ranks. Replacing McNabb’s 72 points and his 30-minutes-per-game on the ice will be difficult. However, with the hopeful return of veteran James Martin, and with Joey Leach and Luke Paulsen returning, the Ice still boast a good blend of size, defensive acumen and offensive skill. Also back are John Niebrandt and Jagger Dirk, who both have the experience of last season’s championship run. 17-year-olds Mike Simpson and Jeff Hubic each saw a handful of games last season for Kootenay. Both will look to push for a roster spot this season.\n\nGoaltending: Nathan Lieuwen backstopped the Ice to the WHL championship last season, earning Playoff MVP honors in the process. Though eligible to move to the professional level, Lieuwen could come back to the Ice as a 20-year-old this season. Should Lieuwen move on, 18-year-old Brett Teskey and highly-touted 17-year-old Mackenzie Skapski will take the reins in the Ice’s goal. Teskey got into 18 games for the Ice as Lieuwen’s back-up last season, while Skapski was Kootenay’s third-round pick in the 2009 WHL Bantam Draft.\n\nPlayer to Watch: Max Reinhart\n\nKootenay’s fourth-round pick in the 2007 WHL Bantam Draft, Max Reinhart broke out as an 18-year-old last season, scoring 34 goals and 79 points in 71 games. He took his game to another level during the post-season, notching 15 goals and 27 points in just 19 games as the Ice captured the Ed Chynoweth Cup. Reinhart, a Calgary Flames prospect, boasts tremendous vision and hockey sense, enabling him to find openings and create plenty of scoring chances. A strong skater with a quick and accurate shot, Reinhart should be among the WHL’s top scorers by season’s end.\n\nLethbridge Hurricanes\n\nGeneral Manager / Head Coach: Rich Preston\n\n2011 pre-season: 1-4-0-1, 3pts\n\n2010-11 Record: 23-36-5-8, 59pts (5th in Central Div., 9th in Eastern Conf.) GF: 205 GA: 295\n\n2010-11 Power Play / Penalty Killing ranking: PP: 15.2% (21st); PK: 78.3% (T-17th)\n\n2011 Playoffs: Did not qualify\n\n2010-11 Top Scorers:\n\nCam Braes 71gp-31g-30a-61pts\n\nAustin Fyten 52gp-24g-30a-54pts\n\nMitch Maxwell 72gp-19g-33a-52pts\n\nUp Front: Veterans Cam Braes and Austin Fyten will be tasked with leading the Hurricanes’ offense again this season. 20-year-old Braes scored a career-best 31 goals last season, and will be counted on to put up similar or better numbers this season while providing valuable leadership. Fyten averaged over a point per game last season, and will be a key contributor again this season. 20-year-old Brody Sutter could also return to the ‘Canes. A big, physical forward, Sutter put up 42 points in 46 games for Lethbridge last season. Expect 17-year-old sophomore Russ Maxwell to take on a larger role in the offense this season. Maxwell put up a respectable nine goals and 24 points as a 16-year-old rookie last season. 18-year-old Phil Tot will also look for an expanded role this season.\n\nOn The Blue Line: The ‘Canes could welcome back five regulars from last year’s roster, including veterans Derek Ryckman, Landon Oslanski, Reid Jackson, Tyler Kizuik and Daniel Johnston. Oslanski boasts good offensive skills and will look to help the ‘Canes improve their power play from its 21st ranking last season. Ryckman, Kizuik, and 18-year-old Swedish rearguard Albin Blomqvist all boast good size and strength. Blomqvist is a solid defensive presence who will make life difficult for opposing forwards. He should help shore up the Hurricanes’ penalty killing unit.\n\nGoaltending: 19-year-old Brandon Anderson returns after getting into 59 games for the Hurricanes last season. A Washington Capitals prospect, Anderson has 101 WHL games of experience under his belt. The Hurricanes also acquired 20-year-old veteran Damien Ketlo from Regina during the pre-season. Ketlo also has plenty of WHL experience, making the battle for the starting job a competitive one. 17-year-old Tanner Kovacs got into one game for the ‘Canes last season, and is challenging for a spot on the roster this season.\n\nPlayer to Watch: Russell Maxwell\n\nOne of two sixth-round picks by the Hurricanes in the 2009 WHL Bantam Draft, Russell Maxwell turned in a strong rookie season as a 16-year-old last year. The Magrath, AB, product scored nine goals and 24 points in 69 games for the ‘Canes, and was named the team’s Rookie of the Year. A good skater with solid offensive skills, many in Lethbridge thought Maxwell turned in the best performance for the ‘Canes by a 16-year-old since Zach Boychuk. Though not the biggest player, Maxwell doesn’t shy away from physical play, and is always willing to stick up for his teammates. Look for Maxwell to take on a bigger chunk of the offensive load this season as the ‘Canes aim to get back into the post-season.\n\nMedicine Hat Tigers\n\nGeneral Manager: Brad McEwen\n\nHead Coach: Shaun Clouston\n\n2011 pre-season: 4-1-0-1, 9pts\n\n2010-11 Record: 46-18-4-4, 100pts (2nd in Central Div., 3rd in Eastern Conf.) GF: 265 GA: 196\n\n2010-11 Power Play / Penalty Killing ranking: PP: 21.2% (T-9th); PK: 81.9% (7th)\n\n2011 Playoffs: Lost in four games to Kootenay in Eastern Conference Championship series\n\n2010-11 Top Scorers:\n\nLinden Vey 69gp-46g-70a-116pts\n\nEmerson Etem 65gp-45g-35a-80pts\n\nWacey Hamilton 67gp-20g-53a-73pts\n\nUp Front: The departure of 2011 WHL scoring champion Linden Vey and veteran Wacey Hamilton leaves a big hole in the Tigers’ attack. Still, the Tigers should have 45-goal man Emerson Etem back to lead the offense. Also returning are Kellan Tochkin and Hunter Shinkaruk, who will both assume large offensive responsibilities. Shinkaruk turned heads with his play as a 16-year-old rookie last season, and should be able to better the 14 goals and 42 points he netted in 2010-11. Czech rookie Adam Rehak showed good offensive abilities during the pre-season, and will be counted on to provide some scoring, while 20-year-old Cole Grbavac and 18-year-olds Reid Petryk and Curtis Valk could also provide offensive depth.\n\nOn The Blue Line: The Tigers could see up to six defenseman return from last year’s team that owned the second-best goals-against in the Eastern Conference. 20-year-old Matt Konan, a veteran of 229 games in a Tigers jersey, is the elder statesman on the blue line, and is as dependable as they come in the defensive zone. 19-year-olds Alex Theriau and Scott MacKay and 18-year-olds Dylan Busenius and Patrik Parkkonen are also back, giving the Tigers solid defensive depth. Busenius could see a much bigger role on the offensive side with the graduation of Thomas Carr and Jace Coyle.\n\nGoaltending: Tyler Bunz returns for his fourth season with the Tigers. The 19-year-old Edmonton Oilers prospect enjoyed an excellent season last year, posting 35 wins, a 2.47 GAA and an impressive .919 save percentage. With Bunz in goal, the Tigers have the chance to win every night. Towering 17-year-old Dawson MacAuley will take on the back-up role with the departure of veteran Deven Dubyk. MacAuley, a second-round Bantam Draft pick in 2009 who stands 6’6”, impressed with a .911 save percentage during pre-season play.\n\nPlayer to Watch: Hunter Shinkaruk\n\nThe Tigers’ first round pick in the 2009 WHL Bantam Draft, Shinkaruk made a splash in the WHL as a 16-year-old rookie last season, potting 14 goals and 43 points with a +13 rating in 63 games. He also dominated for Team Pacific at the 2011 World Under-17 Hockey Challenge and was a key contributor for Canada’s Gold medal-winning Under-18 team at the Memorial for Ivan Hlinka tournament in August. An explosive and agile skater, Shinkaruk boasts elite level puck skills, excellent vision and hockey sense, and has a genuine passion for the game of hockey. Not eligible for the NHL Draft until 2013, Shinkaruk should take on a much bigger role for the Tigers this season as a sophomore.\n\nRed Deer Rebels\n\nGeneral Manager / Head Coach: Jesse Wallin\n\n2011 pre-season: 4-2-0-0, 8pts\n\n2010-11 Record: 48-16-4-4, 104pts (1st in Central Div., 2nd in Eastern Conf.) GF: 268 GA: 159\n\n2010-11 Power Play / Penalty Killing ranking: PP: 22.2% (5th); PK: 85.5% (2nd)\n\n2011 Playoffs: Lost in five games to Medicine Hat in second round\n\n2010-11 Top Scorers:\n\nRyan Nugent-Hopkins 69gp-31g-75a-106pts\n\nAndrej Kudrna 65gp-29g-53a-82pts\n\nByron Froese 73gp-43g-38a-81pts\n\nUp Front: The Rebels are praying that Ryan Nugent-Hopkins returns for his third season with the team. The 18-year-old from Burnaby, B.C., was selected first overall in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft by the Edmonton Oilers, and will be given every opportunity to stick with the NHL Club this season. Yet, having already seen the departure of their second and third-leading scorers, Byron Froese and Andrej Kudrna, having Nugent-Hopkins back would greatly ease the loss of Froese and Kudrna. Swedish winger John Persson will be tasked with improving on his 33 goals and 61 points from last year, while veteran forwards Adam Kambeitz, Turner Elson, Colten Mayor and Daulton Siwak should take on more responsibility as well.\n\nOn The Blue Line: Led by 19-year-old Alex Petrovic, the Rebels could return up to seven rearguards from last year’s team that allowed the fewest goals against in the WHL. Petrovic netted 57 points last season, and will be a leader in all areas for the Rebels’ defense corps. 17-year-old Mathew Dumba, the reigning WHL Rookie of the Year, has already made a name for himself in the WHL as an exciting, hard-hitting and offensively skilled blue liner. Expect Dumba to continue his progression this season. Veterans Aaron Borejko and Justin Weller, both 20 years old, could be back while sophomores Lucas Grayson, Matt Pufhal and Brad Deagle should be ready for more responsibility this season.\n\nGoaltending: Reigning WHL Goaltender and WHL Player of the Year Darcy Kuemper has moved on, leaving big shoes to fill in the Rebels’ cage. Czech rookie Patrik Bartosak looks to have the inside track on the starting job. The 18-year-old has impressed in pre-season with a 1.97 GAA and a .928 save percentage. 17-year-old Bolton Pouliot looks to take on the back-up role after starting the season with the Rebels as a 16-year-old last season.\n\nPlayer to Watch: Mathew Dumba\n\nRed Deer’s first-round pick in the 2009 WHL Bantam Draft, Dumba enjoyed a stellar season as a 16-year-old last year. The defenseman from Calgary, AB, scored 15 goals and 26 points to go with a +24 rating in 62 games for the Rebels, and earned WHL Rookie of the Year honors for his efforts. An excellent skater with a penchant for laying big hits and making dazzling offensive forays, Dumba regularly gets fans out of their seats with his exciting style of play. A possible top 10 pick in the 2012 NHL Entry draft, Dumba has made it a goal to be as dependable in his own zone as he is exciting in the offensive zone. Look for Dumba to be a key contributor in Red Deer as the Rebels aim for a long playoff run this year."
