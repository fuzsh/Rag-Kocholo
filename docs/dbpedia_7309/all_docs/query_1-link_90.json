        "text": "Here’s a thought exercise I’ve been mulling over the past few days, ever since this Stanley Cup final was finalized: If you handed your average hockey fan a blank sheet and asked them to write down the “most successful NHL franchises” over the past eight to 10 years, how many similarities would be on those lists?\n\nPittsburgh and Chicago won three Stanley Cups. They’d be there.\n\nMaybe Los Angeles, as even though they’ve fallen on hard times, they had a pretty good run with wins in 2012 and 2014. Washington gets in, given their title a year ago and competitiveness in the Ovechkin era.\n\nAnd probably Boston, too, given they’re always in contention and won a championship back in 2011.\n\nYou don’t often think of a team like St. Louis in this context, at least not recently. But we probably should.\n\nThis is a franchise that has missed the playoffs only once since 2011. They’ve made it to the second round four times, the third round twice and to the final this year – all in the last eight postseasons.\n\nThe Blues have won 365 regular-season games and averaged 104 points a season in that time frame, trailing only Pittsburgh. They’ve accomplished that primarily by being a defensive juggernaut in that span, allowing fewer goals and fewer shots than any other team.\n\nThat’s driven St. Louis to the NHL’s fourth-best goal differential (plus-231), behind only Boston, Pittsburgh and Washington – three teams that have won five of the league’s last 10 championships.\n\nHow the Blues have consistently become one of the NHL’s best regular-season teams hasn’t always drawn headlines. They’re not an offensive powerhouse, and their biggest point producer is Vladimir Tarasenko, who sits 33rd in points per game between 2011-12 and today.\n\nBeing in the Western Conference and in the same division as the Blackhawks, who have dominated in recent history, probably hasn’t allowed them to get their due as a national focal point, either in Canada or the U.S.\n\nIt doesn’t help that the story of St. Louis’ path to this final is one of plain ol’ unsexy consistency. Of continually making the playoffs and having some depth on the roster and being a sound defensive team. Of good management and good coaching, more than filling the night’s highlight reels.\n\nIf the Blues win this series, it’ll be the culmination of a lot of angst and frustration after so many kicks at the can that didn’t pay off.\n\nBut it should probably also help shift how we think about what it takes to win a championship in the modern NHL.\n\nAfter Pittsburgh, Chicago and LA stormed through the league, winning eight of nine Cups between 2009 and 2017, the thinking became that teams needed to tank in order to pick high in the draft and get a difference-making superstar.\n\nCrosby, Malkin, Kane, Toews and Doughty were obvious foundational pieces of those teams and they all came from the top of the draft.\n\nThe Blues? They haven’t picked higher than 20th going all the way back to Jaden Schwartz at 14th in 2010. Three of the past eight drafts, they haven’t had a first-rounder at all.\n\n(If you want to go back further, this is a franchise that has picked higher than 13th just twice in the last 30 years. Both times they took a defenceman, not a high-powered offensive star.)\n\nThat would seem to be the antithesis to success in the NHL’s current superstar youth movement era, but one of St. Louis’ strengths has been finding gems outside the top 10. Schwartz, Tarasenko and Robert Thomas were all mid-first rounders. They also uncovered Colton Parayko, Jordan Binnington and Joel Edmundson in the second and third rounds in 2011 and 2012, drafts that laid a strong defensive foundation that’s only now coming into its prime.\n\nIf you add in Vince Dunn and captain Alex Pietrangelo – the rare high pick on the roster – the majority of the Blues blue line is homegrown, drafted and developed in the organization.\n\nMix in savvy trades for players like Ryan O’Reilly and Brayden Schenn – their two highest minute forwards – and you have the elements for a competitive team year after year.\n\nThe lesson in that, perhaps, is that rather than tanking and building up from nothing, what matters more in this league is finding a way to sustain what success you can find over a long enough period of time. Find good players in the draft, wherever you’re picking. Pay them appropriately. And minimize the poor contract decisions as much as possible while managing your cap as well as you can.\n\nThat approach finally paid off for the Capitals last season, 14 years after drafting Ovechkin first overall, in part because they stuck with their talented base for more than a decade and found ways to complement them year after year.\n\nLook at a franchise like the Bruins – which has reworked the pieces around their existing core again and again since winning in 2011 – and you can see evidence of that patient approach paying off.\n\nThat kind of roster continuity is getting rare around the league, with free agency pushed younger and players aging out earlier. Between Pietrangelo, Alex Steen, Tarasenko, Schwartz and Jay Bouwmeester, St. Louis has five core players who have played at least 400 games in the organization since 2011-12 and are still on the roster. Boston, similarly, has a longstanding core group built around two defensemen (Zdeno Chara and Torey Krug) and three forwards (Patrice Bergeron, Brad Marchand and David Krejci) since their last Cup win.\n\nThese are not flash-in-the-pan foundations, in other words. It’s not boom or bust; go for it, then tear it down. And looking at their salary-cap structure, neither franchise in this year’s final looks as though they’ll need to take a step back in the years to come.\n\nIn fact, if St. Louis can move struggling netminder Jake Allen’s contract (or even buy it out), they’ll be poised to make a splash in free agency, adding to a roster that is already on the cusp of the franchise’s first championship. The vast majority of their best players are all still on the right side of 30, too.\n\nBig decisions are coming on Pietrangelo and Schenn in 2020, but a lot of this team’s core is locked in at reasonable rates.\n\nPart of what I think really helps the Blues’ cap situation is they don’t have to give contracts to a pile of high-powered offensive weapons. One of the grim realities behind NHL teams paying their stars for potential at such young ages is that those who pile up goals and points will be rewarded the most.\n\nThat’s something facing general managers in Tampa, Toronto and Winnipeg this summer, as three of the highest-scoring clubs in the NHL enter an offseason where some of their best young players need new contracts. And their agents can point around the league, at their client’s numbers and their comparables, and credibly demand astronomical raises.\n\nOn teams like St. Louis, where they win more so by keeping the chances against low and the puck out of their net, that’s less of a threat. Binnington will need a new deal that rewards him for his brilliant half season and playoffs, but it should be possible to keep this group together for another few attempts at a Cup, something the fan base has been dreaming of for nearly 50 years.\n\nIn a league as volatile and parity-filled as this, where all it takes is a hot goalie to extend or end your season, having all these chances at rolling the dice could be more important than anything.\n\nIt’s a key part of what has gotten the Blues this far.\n\n(Top photo: Keith Gillett/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)"
