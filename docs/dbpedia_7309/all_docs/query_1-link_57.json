        "text": "I'd love to do a bunch of bulletpoints about Jaroslav Halak finally getting some run support (welcome, Cardinals fans), Kevin Shattenkirk and Alex Pietrangelo becoming the most exciting first pair/second pair blueliners in the league and about how Jason Arnott and T.J. Oshie are both earning new contracts from the Blues with their play so far.\n\nInstead, here is my editor's article from tonight's Game Time paper. It's sure to annoy Blue Jackets fans (but, as one of them told me tonight, \"There's only like five of us\") but the point I tried to make was taken to heart by the Blues tonight, especially in the third period, when they could have blamed a tough schedule on the result and packed it in.\n\nHere you go:\n\nIt seems like every time Columbus appears on the schedule, I can't help but think about how much I pity the fans of that team and then I turn around and endlessly bash the Blue Jackets. Maybe tonight will be different. I'll try my best anyway.\n\nThe Columbus Blue Jackets are poo. They are an embarrassing franchise and there's no reason to think that they're figuring out how to become less poo-like. I'm sure that when young men who have worked their whole lives to get drafted are finally selected and it's the Blue Jackets who call their name they are immediately relieved and excited. But then, after they've hugged their mom and dad and the girlfriend they are soon to cheat on and then dump, as they are walking up to the podium they have the thought of, \"Hey, wait a minute. Did they say Blue Jackets? I'm going to be a Blue Jacket? Fuuuuuuuuck.\"\n\nSame goes for the players who get traded there, like Jeff Carter. He's a proven NHL talent. When he got traded to Columbus he had to be like, \"Damn. I can't believe I got traded. This is so weird. I have to pack this house up and find a new place and.... Hey, wait a minute. Did he say I'm going to the Blue Jackets? Fuuuuuuuuck.\"\n\nThe only guys who are happy to wind up in Columbus are guys who are worried that they are on their way out of the NHL. \"Hey, Columbus sucks, but I'll probably get to play there and it's airplanes and four-star hotels, not buses and the Days Inn in Bumfuck, Iowa.\" The case in point is former Blues tweener Nikita Nikitin. He was a pressbox regular in St. Louis due to the blueline depth here, but in Columbus he's a top-pairing guy. For him, the opportunity to play and look like a stud is more important than being on a loser team that is on the bullet train to Nowheresville.\n\nPoo ass poo team.\n\nColumbus is so bad and so clearly not going anywhere anytime soon that I actually feel bad for Rick Nash. He's still young at 27 and he's coming into what should his most productive three or four years and he is locked in on this terrible team. He has over 500 NHL points, owns the franchise offensive records in almost every category and will probably end up finishing his career there due to one of those long-term contracts unless he asks to be traded. That means he'll probably finish his NHL career without a championship and probably without any significant playoff numbers (career regular season games played: 624 / career playoff games played: 4). He'll end his career and be a guy who never gets Hall of Fame consideration and will instead be looked at as an immense talent that was wasted.\n\nNice job, Columbus."
