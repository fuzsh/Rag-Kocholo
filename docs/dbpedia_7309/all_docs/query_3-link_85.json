Richards will be joined behind the U.S. bench by assistant coaches Dan Byslma (Grand Haven, Mich.) and Greg Carvel (Canton, N.Y.).\n\nRichards, who is representing the United States in international competition for the third time, will be making his debut as head coach of the U.S. Men’s National Team.

His team was plagued by injuries for much of the 2014-15 season, however, finished the regular season with wins in 16 of its last 17 games. Prior to being named head coach on May 14, 2012, Richards was the interim head coach for 41 games during the 2011-12 season after holding the position of assistant coach for the first half of that year. He began his NHL head-coaching career in 2009-10 with the Minnesota Wild where he spent two seasons. Prior to joining the Wild, he was an assistant coach for the San Jose Sharks in 2008-09 and helped lead the club to the NHL’s best regular-season record.\n\nRichards coached in the American Hockey League from 2002-06, including as an assistant coach with the Milwaukee Admirals during the team’s 2004 Calder Cup championship. He returned to the Calder Cup Final in 2008 as head coach of the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins.\n\nAs a player, Richards enjoyed a 13-season professional career, including eight games in the NHL with the Hartford Whalers. As a collegian, Richards played four seasons (1985-89) at the University of Minnesota where he appeared in 167 games and contributed 30 goals and 158 points to become Minnesota’s all-time leading scorer among defensemen.
