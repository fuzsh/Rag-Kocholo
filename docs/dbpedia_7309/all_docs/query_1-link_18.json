        "text": "This is not to suggest St. Louis isn't a good hockey market. It is a dynamic one. Has been for years and years. They have sold out nine of their last 17 home games through Saturday, so fans get that the Blues are the real deal -- or at least appear to be the real deal.\n\nThe Blues possess one of the most active, vibrant alumni groups in the league. In fact, when it comes to winning a Cup, veteran defenseman Barret Jackman figures the alumni he runs into on a regular basis either at team functions or around the city might be more pumped about this team's prospects than the average fan. That kind of emotion, the yearning for a winner from former Blues, is not lost on Jackman, who is the team's elder statesman, having joined the team full time in 2002-03, after which he won rookie of the year honors.\n\nYes, there's a certain amount of pressure, a kind of burden that comes with carrying the torch for a legion of former Blues players who are waiting for a chance to celebrate the Cup win they couldn't deliver themselves, but it's also something that is being embraced by the current team, Jackman told ESPN.com.\n\n\"It would be really special to share that with them,\" said Jackman.\n\nAs for the fans, yes, the team feels their rising excitement too, with the playoffs just around the corner and a shot at what would be the team's second Presidents' Trophy.\n\n\"I think the fans are just waiting to explode in St. Louis,\" Jackman said. \"I'm sure it's been building for a long time.\"\n\nBob Plager has been with the team since the beginning, since that expansion season. He credits new owner Tom Stillman with pulling out all the stops to bring a winner to long-suffering Blues fans.\n\n\"This owner showed the city that they are committed to win and win now,\" Plager told ESPN.com.\n\nAs much as he'd love to be part of Stanley Cup festivities, Plager said it's the fans who have stuck with the team through the decades that deserve it most.\n\n\"Does this city deserve a Stanley Cup parade? So bad,\" he said. \"More than anything, I want to win and I want a Stanley Cup for our fans. Will they go crazy? This city will go crazy.\"\n\nHull, likewise, can only imagine the celebration that would accompany the end of the Blues' Cup drought.\n\n\"I can't even fathom it,\" he said. \"It would be absolute bedlam.\"\n\nArmstrong knows the numbers off by heart. Since Hitchcock took over for Davis Payne during the 2011-12 season, the Chicago Blackhawks lead the league with 277 points, the same number as the Pittsburgh Penguins. The Blues have 276, and Boston has 270.\n\n\"The only difference is that three of those teams have a Cup,\" Armstrong said.\n\nThe GM knows what goes into building a Cup winner. He was in Dallas as assistant GM and watched firsthand as GM Bob Gainey built a winner there in the late 1990s, culminating in a Cup win in 1999. He recalls working on a contract with veteran Guy Carbonneau and, at the time, it was possible to write in a playoff bonus.\n\n\"He said, 'I don't want that that, I want to win Cups,'\" Armstrong recalled. The implication was clear; if just making the playoffs is the goal, you'll never get to the end of the road.\n\nArmstrong also understands what it would mean for St. Louis to win a Cup. He recently attended Mike Modano's jersey retirement in Dallas and remains struck by the bonds from that 1999 Dallas Stars Cup-winning team. Blake Sloan and Hull, Brad Lukowich and Modano, \"have a bond that will always be there. And that bond can only be formed in one way in our sport,\" Armstrong said.\n\nAnd that's by winning a Cup.\n\n\"I think about that a lot,\" the GM said.\n\nAre they ready? The Blues knocked off San Jose in the first round in 2012 and many thought they were ready last season to take that big step. And when they took a two-game lead over the defending Cup champs from L.A. in the first round, it looked like they had arrived. But they learned a hard lesson in winning -- and losing -- when the Kings reeled off four straight victories, all by the slimmest of margins.\n\n\"We learned a hard lesson last year and had a long summer to think about it, and hopefully we'll be better going forward because of that,\" captain David Backes said in an interview.\n\nNot that the Blues didn't come up with the effort needed. That series might have been the hardest-hitting of the entire playoff season.\n\n\"I really felt for the players last year,\" Hitchcock, who won a Jack Adams Award as coach of the year in his first year in St. Louis, told ESPN.com. \"They poured so much into that series. But we weren't rewarded. That's the playoffs. That's just the way it is.\"\n\nThe Blues scored just six times in the four losses against the Kings, allowing just 10 goals. But the goaltending wasn't quite where it needed to be against a team such as the Kings, who have Jonathan Quick in goal, and so the Blues added former Vezina Trophy winner Miller at the deadline this season.\n\n\"It gives them presence,\" Pang explained. \"Gives them the ability to look at other teams' goalies in the eye and say, 'We've got a Vezina Trophy winner here.'\"\n\nGlenn Healy, another former NHL netminder who has established himself as a top analyst, agreed, saying the Blues might not have a game-breaker offensively like Western Conference game-breakers Ryan Getzlaf or Patrick Kane or Jonathan Toews, but they added the next best thing, an elite netminder. Healy cited Miller's play at the 2010 Olympics, when Miller was named MVP.\n\n\"You know he can play at a high level and at a high pace,\" Healy said.\n\nBeyond that, Healy said this is the time for the Blues to go for it. The salary cap is expected to continue to rise in the coming years and it's perhaps unrealistic for the Blues to spend to the cap, if the cap goes to $85 million or $90 million.\n\n\"This is the time to make the move,\" Healy told ESPN.com.\n\nLike all players, Backes is fueled by the Stanley Cup dream. He also understands that this hunger extends across the team's fan base, which has watched for decades as other cities have hosted parades, feted their champions.\n\n\"Since you've been three years old and started liking hockey, you've dreamed about winning the Cup and envisioned what it's like hold that thing or to kiss or to have your day with it or to be in a parade or whatever,\" he said. \"And you see other guys going through that and you want to have that experience for yourself and for your teammates. And then for a city that's supported this team for 47 years and hasn't gotten there yet, it'd be a nice treat. But it's a lot of work to be done. We've got 28 games potentially in playoffs where we've got to play solid hockey for that whole time. But we think we've got a great group assembled here that can take that task head-on.\""
