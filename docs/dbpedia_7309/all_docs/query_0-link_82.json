Some works will feature one instrument type i.e. 4 bass flutes, or 3 alto trombones, 5 contrabassoons etc, others will be a fanciful pairing and mix of instruments as suggested above. The music will be written in such a way as to offer both professionals and virtuosi as well as beginners and non-reading musicians compositions to realize. This long term project has been enabled initially by the Guggenheim Fellowship Program and will be published in a spiral-bound volume.\n\nENDANGERED SPECIES\n\n...is an ongoing solo project begun in 1988 (ELECTRIC RAGS) for Midi Keyboard Sampler and Laptop evolving into TRANSDADAEXPRESS, ENDANGERED SPECIES, and THE ALVIN CURRAN FAKEBOOK...this project makes me constantly update and assemble my vast sample library and create spontaneous music-performances with 1000's of selected samples from sounds of music, people, places, and things from all over the world - literally the world under my fingers!!! Updated versions reflect current configurations of sampled-sets that interest me...often leading to the creation of Sound Portraits of People, (John Cage, the art critic Achille Bonito Oliva, or Zurich street yodeler Alowys Bucher) or even live Double Portraits with other artists and friends such as Scanner and was planned with Luc Ferrari (Angelica Festival 05),....\n\nXXTRA LARGE\n\nMaritime Rites, Chicago, New Music America\n\nA music-theater project (installation) in specially chosen sites involving hundreds of musicians on land and on water - in a moving choreography of sound and celebration.
