        "text": "Czech striker David Strihavka agreed a four year contract with Norwich City on 5th July 2007, as long as Norwich and his club Banik Ostrava can agree a fee - it is believed that David has a get-out clause of £700,000. Strihavka trained with his new team mates at Colney for the first time on 9th July as club officials and the player's representative finalised his move from the Czech top flight outfit. This was completed on 11th July 2007.\n\nStrihavka has played for many sides in his native country, including Bohemians Prague, Sparta Prague, FK Jablonec, Chmel Blany and Banik Ostrava.\n\nHis career failed to get off the ground in the First Division and first made an impact in the Second Division with Bohemians Prague. This earned him a move to Sparta where he played in the 2004/05 Champions League with them against Lyon and Manchester United. He was the second highest scorer in the Czech Republic in 2006/7 with 13 goals.\n\nStrihavka was part of the Czech Republic Under-16s that took part in UEFA Under-16 Championship in Israel in 2000, in which they were defeated by Portugal. Two years later in 2002, Strihavka played in the UEFA Under-19 Championship and scored twice against Andorra. David had a trial with Watford in January 2007.\n\nHe made his debut for Norwich on the opening day on the 2007/8 season as a second-hal substitute for Dion Dublin in the 0-0 draw with Preston at Deepdale. His first goal came in the 1-0 win over Crystal Palace on 15th September 2007.\n\nDavid left Norwich on 11th January 2008 with his contract terminated by mutual consent. His last appearance for Norwich was for 11 minutes in the November 10th clash at Plymouth which City lost 3-0.\n\nUpon his departure, details of his contract were revealed. The 24-year-old Czech joined on an initial one-year contract with the option for a further three years if City wished to retain his services. That option applied to both fee and contract, with City paying £240,000 for the first year of the deal. A further sum in the region of £1.1m would have been payable this summer if City had chosen to exercise their option for a further three years.\n\nIt's disappointing that it hasn't worked out, but it's always a gamble when signing players from abroad - sometimes it pays off, sometimes it doesn't, said Glenn Roeder. David found it difficult to adjust while in England and we would like to wish him the best of luck in his future career.\"\n\nStrihavka added: I tried to play in the Championship - but with the unhappy start to the season and with the change in manager, I now need to re-start my career back in Prague. I would like to wish Norwich City and their wonderful fans best wishes for the future.\n\nHe was linked to both German second division side TSG 1899 Hoffenheim and Czech club Mlada Boleslav, but Slavia Prague secured his signature in January 2008. By the summer of 2008, he had signed for Banik Ostrava who will compete in the 2008/9 UEFA Cup\n\n\"Dave the Striker\" was linked in November 2008 with moves to Nottingham Forest or to German side VfL Bochum\n\nDave moved to Plzen in the summer of 2009 and scored for his new side on the opening day of the new season with a 3-2 win over Slovacko.\n\nIn January 2011, David signed for Dutch side Willem II Tilburg on loan.\n\nIn June 2011, he signed for Slovakian side MK ilina.

They will be the seventh club he has played for since leaving Carrow Road in January 2008. He left FK Pribram in May 2013. He had played 26 games, scoring twice.\n\nOn 29th August 2013, David transferred to Al-Ahed who play in the Lebanese Premier League. He was released by Al-Ahed on 1st January 2014. He joined Malaysian side Sarawak on trial in March 2014 along with Lebanese international Hassan Mohamad.\n\nIn 2014 he joined Slovak side FK Dukla Banská Bystrica.\n\nIn 2015, he moved to Lebanon to sign for Racing Beirut.but was reportedly out of contract by July 2015 when he played for and captained a Czech side of unemployed footballers in a tournament organised by Fifpro (former Chelsea midfielder Jiri Jarosik was a teammate in the Czech side),\n\nOn 12th September 2015, he joined Italian side US Folgore Caratese who play in Serie D.\n\nHe retired due to a brain tumour at the end of 2015 having played 10 games for Caralese.
