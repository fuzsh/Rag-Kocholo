        "text": "The 2016 World Cup of Hockey is seven and a half months away and the first names that will compete in Toronto from September, 17th to October, 1st were announced last Wednesday. Every nation (err..every Team) had to name 16 of the 23 players that would bring to the tournament, with at least two of them being goalies, and that meant that we would get to start the always entertaining game of projecting the names included, the major snubs and the potential surprises. To be clear, the subjects I consider “entertained” here are hockey nerds, hockey writers with columns to fill and people with too much time on their hands.\n\nAnyway, in advance of the announcements, I took a couple of hours off my busy schedule to speculate on every player that would appear on the rosters’ lists (and not the ones I believed should have been selected), and then proceeded to evaluate my performance. This article describes my choices and rationales, and tries to impart into the thought-process of the management teams that actually had to do the job. I also sprinkle in a few predictions about the players that will be added until June 1st, when complete rosters have to be delivered.\n\nA few months ago, I filed in a post about the construction of Team Europe’s roster (which you can read here and here ), so I plugged in some info from the analysis I did back then, and I am currently working on a detailed report on Team North America that will follow much of the same structure, thus refrained to share (or rehash) some ideas in this post regarding those two squads.\n\nMy main resource to speed up the process of compiling the potential preliminary rosters of every nation was this website , where you can sort out every NHL player that played in a season for nationality and position. It really saved up the time of scouring all NHL rosters, and I would also like to thank the European Teams for trying to restrict their players’ pool to the NHL. Especially Team Russia, who expediently announced the first 16 names would all be NHLers.\n\nThe article is naturally separated by each competing team, with each section starting with a resume of my mishaps, as OUT are players I wrongly named in my projection and IN are the ones who took their spot. I then transcribed my forecasted rosters and bolded the names I got right while expressing some ideas about every group (forwards, defenseman and goalies).\n\nAll the “real” preliminary rosters can be found here\n\nTeam Sweden\n\nOut: C Carl Soderberg, G Jhonas Enroth\n\nIN: D Niklas Kronwall (Detroit Red Wings), G Jacob Markstrom (Vancouver Canucks)\n\nForwards (9): Nicklas Backstrom (Washington Capitals), Daniel Sedin (Vancouver Canucks), Loui Eriksson (Boston Bruins), Alex Steen (St. Louis Blues), Henrik Sedin (Vancouver Canucks), Filip Forsberg (Nashville Predators), Gabriel Landeskog (Colorado Avalanche), Henrik Zetterberg (Detroit Red Wings), Carl Soderberg (Colorado Avalanche)\n\nSweden was the only team to name just eight forwards and they’re all pretty much unassailable, forming a formidable staple up front. I’m pretty confident Soderberg will be part of the final group of 13, with his versatility and experience playing both left wing and center, but the amount of great candidates for the other four spots is staggering.\n\nMarcus Kruger may be an ideal checking pivot to slot behind Henrik Sedin, Zetterberg and Backstrom, but Mika Zibanejad and Mikael Backlund are also in the run, while on the wings they can mix and match with the tenacity of Patric Hornqvist, the skill of Gustav Nyquist and Jakob Silfverberg or the speed of Carl Hagelin, Rickard Rackell and Andre Burakovsky.\n\nDefenseman (5): Erik Karlsson (Ottawa Senators), Oliver Ekman-Larsson (Arizona Coyotes), Victor Hedman, Anton Stralman (Tampa Bay Lightning), Niklas Hjalmarsson (Chicago Blackhawks)\n\nThe Tre Kronor’s blueline is once again absolutely stacked and I did hope they would leave two spots open for the wealth of options available. Niklas Kronwall’s decorated history with the national team proved too important, and moved out, for now, John Klingberg, who, for much of the first half of the NHL season, kept pace with Erik Karlsson in terms of offensive production. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the steady Anton Stralman was recognized, and should continue to be paired with Victor Hedman, a notable absence in Sochi 2014.\n\nIf Sweden makes the mistake of leaving Klingberg home, Johnny Oduya (Chicago Blackhawks) and Mattias Ekholm (Nashville Predators) should be the next in line, even if you can’t discount Alexander Edler, who, mind-bogglingly, was selected to cover for Karlsson on the top pair in 2014. Alas, let’s just hope the new coaching staff is smarter and joins the forces of Karlsson and Ekman-Larsson, creating a delightful, mouth-watering partnership.\n\nGoalies (2): Henrik Lundqvist (NY Rangers), Jhonas Enroth (LA Kings)\n\nIf some teams opted to name three goaltenders, Sweden probably would have liked to leave it to Lundqvist, their only NHL starter. Enroth was considered the best goalie at the 2013 World Championships the Swedes won, and I thought that would give him the edge, but Markstrom and his never-truly-realized immense potential were favoured. The third slot may be decided by a coin flip between Enroth, Eddie Lack (Carolina Hurricanes), Robin Lehner (Buffalo Sabres) and even Anders Nilsson (St. Louis Blues).\n\nTeam Finland\n\nOut: C Joonas Kempainnen, D Jyrki Jokipakka, D Sami Lepisto\n\nIN: C Teuvo Teravainen (Chicago Blackhawks), LW Lauri Korpikovski (Edmonton Oilers), D Esa Lindell (Dallas Stars)\n\nForwards (9): Mikko Koivu (Minnesota Wild), Jussi Jokinen, Aleksander Barkov (Florida Panthers), Valteri Filppula (Tampa Bay Lightning), Jori Lehtera (St. Louis Blues), Mikael Granlund (Minnesota Wild), Leo Komarov (Toronto Maple Leafs) , Joonas Donskoi (San Jose Sharks), Joonas Kemppainen (Boston Bruins)\n\nFinland never possesses the flashiest attack in senior competitions and that won’t change in the World Cup, since none of the first eight forwards above is a goal scorer. Donskoi is definitely the less known commodity but he’s had a fine debut season in the NHL and his selection was expected.\n\nLauri Korpikoski ‘s omission from my list was in favour of 27-year-old Kemppainen, part of last year’s World Championship squad before settling in Boston, while the below-expectations season put on by the talented Teuvo Teravainen convinced me he wouldn’t make the cut. Erik Haula, the third-year Minnesota Wild centre, is also a strong candidate to be a part of the final roster.\n\nDefenseman (5): Rasmus Ristolainen (Buffalo Sabres), Olli Maatta (Pittsburgh Penguins), Sami Vatanen (Anaheim Ducks), Jyrki Jokipakka (Calgary Flames), Sami Lepisto (Avtomobilist Yekaterinburg, KHL)\n\nA grand total of six Finnish defensemen have suited up for NHL teams in 2015-16, and only four have played more than 10 games. Thus, this screening process wasn’t exactly difficult, even if the youth of the group is a really big concern. Ristolainen (21 years-old), Maatta (21) and Vatanen (24) are all relatively inexperienced, even if the last two were already key components in Sochi 2014, so I searched a bit to bring up the name of Lepisto, a 31-year-old former NHLer with two Olympic bronze medals in his résumé. He’s no Kimmo Timonen, but his experience will definitely be appreciated.\n\nThe offensive-minded Esa Lindell, another 21-year-old, jumped in front of Jokipakka, who just a few days ago was his teammate on the Stars organization, despite only 4 NHL appearances against more than 90 amassed by the 24-year-old.\n\nGoalies (2): Pekka Rinne (Nashville Predators), Tuukka Rask (Boston Bruins)\n\nRinne and Rask are studs and will battle it out for the starting spot, with Boston’s mainstay having the edge. The Dallas Stars duo of Kari Lehtonen and Antti Niemi should extend their on-going confront to the national team, with the latter in advantage at this time.\n\nTeam Russia\n\nOut: D Alexei Emelin, D Fedor Tyutin, D Evgeni Medvedev\n\nIN: C Vladislav Namestnikov (Tampa Bay Lightning), D Dmitry Orlov (Washington Capitals), G Andrei Vasilevski (Tampa Bay Lightning)\n\nForwards (9): Alexander Ovechkin, Evgeni Kuznetsov (Washington Capitals), Artemi Panarin, Artem Anisimov (Chicago Blackhawks), Evgeni Malkin (Pittsburgh Penguins), Vladimir Tarasenko (St. Louis Blues), Pavel Datsyuk (Detroit Red Wings), Nikita Kucherov (Tampa Bay Lightning), Nikolai Kulemin (NY Islanders)\n\nSix of the top 25 point producers in the NHL are Russian forwards, and you just need to look at their names to confirm that they won’t lack firepower and copious amounts of offensive skill. The nine names picked up are non-brainers and Vladislav Namestnikov is a tenth no one disputes.\n\nRight now, the question is where two all-world talents like Ilya Kovalchuk and Alexander Radulov fit in, since someone has to backcheck and kill penalties on that group. Datsyuk, Kulemin and Anisimov won’t be enough, so I expect Alexander Burmistrov (Winnipeg Jets) to be one of the late picks, with Viktor Tikhonov (Arizona Coyotes) also expected to carve his spot. A final note for Russia’s depth down the middle, significantly improved with the emergence of Evgeny Kuznetsov, who joins Malkin, Datsyuk, and Anisimov.\n\nDefenseman (5): Andrei Markov (Montreal Canadiens), Alexei Emelin (Montreal Canadiens), Dmitri Kulikov (Florida Panthers), Fedor Tyutin (Columbus Blue Jackets), Evgeni Medvedev (Philadelphia Flyers)\n\nMarkov and Kulikov, who was left off the 2014 Olympic Games’ roster, were easy picks but Russia’s decision to ignore all the veteran blueliners caught me off guard. After all, the 31-year-old Tyutin participated in the last three Olympics, Medvedev is a regular fixture on their World Championships representations’, and Emelin’s physical style is pretty uncommon in the rest of their defensive options. No doubt the trio has seen his best years but I fully expect to see them on the final roster.\n\nDmitry Orlov (Capitals) has impressed with his offensive instincts this season for the Capitals and provides some much needed puck-moving ability to the group, thus the 24-year-old was always on the radar to be one of the seven rearguards on the list. Another player that has those types of qualities is Slava Voynov (SKA Saint Petersburg, KHL) but he’s persona non-grata for the NHL and NHLPA, hence the pressure to leave him at home is significant.\n\nGoalies (2): Semyon Varlamov (Colorado Avalanche), Sergei Bobrovsky (Columbus Blue Jackets)\n\nWith Anton Khudobin buried on Anaheim’s depth chart, there were only three regular NHL goalies to choose from, so I guess they just decided to put the subject behind their back for all. The inconsistent Varlamov and a Bobrosvky coming off a nightmarish season will square off for possession of Russia’s crease, with Andrei Vasilevsky on the lookout in case both falter.\n\nTeam Czech Republic\n\nOut: RW Jaromir Jagr, RW Radim Vrbata, RW Jiri Hudler, D Zbynek Michalek, D Marek Zidlicky\n\nIN: LW Tomas Hertl (San Jose Sharks), RW David Pastrnak (Boston Bruins), D Andrej Sustr (Tampa Bay Lightning), D Michal Kempny (Avangard Omsk, KHL), G Ondrej Pavelec (Winnipeg Jets)\n\nForwards (10) : David Krejci (Boston Bruins), Jakub Voracek (Philadelphia Flyers), Tomas Plekanec (Montreal Canadiens), Jaromir Jagr, Jiri Hudler (Florida Panthers), Martin Hanzal (Arizona Coyotes), Radim Vrbata (Vancouver Canucks), Ondrej Palat (Tampa Bay Lightning Lightning), Michael Frolik (Winnipeg Jets), Vladimir Sobotka (Avangard Omsk, KHL)\n\nDoing this prediction on a couple of hours was bound to lead to some blunders, and indicating Jagr is among those, as the 44-year-old and the team’s brass had already agreed to wait for the legend to decide on whether he wanted to represent his country one last (more?) time.\n\nVrbata and Hudler also fall in a similar category, as both were bizarre and glaring exclusions from the roster on the 2014 Olympics. Two years later, Vrbata is 34-years-old and going through a tough season in Vancouver, thus I can understand where they’re coming from. However, Hudler (32) is still productive, even if at a level significantly below his 2014-15 career season, and would have helped this team. Anyway, it’s not the first time the Czech take some strange decisions in terms of roster construction, and seems now clear that neither player is on their plans.\n\nNevertheless, looking at the entire group of 16, no player is older than 30, and going with the youthful exuberance and tremendous speed of Hertl and Pastrnak, two of the few exciting talents produced by the country recently, is definitely defendable. In the end, it won’t be the vital difference between failure and success.\n\nTo round out the forward group, the energetic Vladimir Sobotka is a great pickup, and I expect to see a couple more European-based players added later. Dmitri Jaskin, the 22-year-old St. Louis Blues forward, was the odd man out when I finished my preliminary group, but I believe he’ll also be part of the 23-man roster.\n\nDefenseman (4): Zbynek Michalek (Arizona Coyotes), Roman Polak (San Jose Sharks), Radko Gudas (Philadelphia Flyers), Marek Zidlicky (NY Islanders)\n\nMy mishaps predicting the Czech roster extended to the blueline, where the unassuming Andrej Sustr, a regular on last season’s Stanley Cup finalists, was left off my roster. Although, in my defence, I can note that the 25-year-old is a bottom-pairing guy for his team and never represented his country on senior international competitions before.\n\nThe absence of Michalek is truly surprising, as the 33-year-old is an extremely reliable defensive presence boasting a long history with the national team. Meanwhile, Zidlicky is another notable omission because, despite being 39-years-old, his powerplay prowess and passing ability aren’t approached by any other Czech rearguard.\n\nIn contrary, out of nowhere came Michal Kempny, a 25-year-old undrafted defenseman that plays on the left side… and that’s all we know about him. As for Polak and Gudas, they will use all means necessary to keep the opponents in check, so their adversaries definitely hope they’re not paired together.\n\nGoalies (2): Petr Mrazek (Detroit Red Wings), Michal Neuvirth (Philadelphia Flyers)\n\nJust like Russia, there were only three real options to consider here, so makes sense that Pavelec’s inclusion was already taken care off. Nevertheless, at least this time, he won’t be the starter on the tournament, with the Czech hopes’ resting on the shoulders of the much more trustworthy Petr Mrazek, a star in the making.\n\nTeam Europe\n\nOut: C Lars Eller, RW Marian Gaborik, RW Nino Niederreiter\n\nIN: C Leon Draisatl (Edmonton Oilers), LW Tomas Vanek (Minnesota Wild), RW Jannik Hansen (Vancouver Canucks)\n\nForwards (9): Anze Kopitar (LA Kings, SLO), Marian Gaborik (LA Kings, SVK), Tomas Tatar (Detroit Red Wings, SVK), Marian Hossa (Chicago Blackhawks, SVK), Mikkel Boedker (Colorado Avalanche, DEN), Lars Eller (Montreal Canadiens, DEN), Mats Zuccarello (NY Rangers, NOR), Frans Nielsen (NY Islanders, DEN), Nino Niederreiter (Minnesota Wild, SUI)\n\nThe big standout from the initial roster is Leon Draisatl, the 20-year-old Oilers centre who took full-advantage of Connor McDavid’s injury to go on an offensive tear and seal his status as an NHL-ready middleman. With only Kopitar engraved as a high-end star pivot for Team Europe, the German may jump from the outside looking in right towards the 2nd line, pushing down the likes of Lars Eller and Zemgus Girgensons, who may be in direct competition for a lower-line role. Meanwhile, instead of Niederreiter, who I pencilled on the fourth-line’s right-wing, Team Europe’s management surprised by nominating Jannik Hansen, whose merits I defended ferociously on the aforementioned post.\n\nVanek and Gaborik were the skilled veterans on the downswing I mulled before my ninth forward indication. While I believed the Slovak’s familiarity with Kopitar made him a near sure thing, his knee injury, compounded with the 34 birthdays, probably scared some and contributed to Vanek’s appointment.\n\nDefenseman (5): Zdeno Chara (Boston Bruins, SVK), Roman Josi (Nashville Predators, SUI), Andrej Sekera (Edmonton Oilers, SVK), Mark Streit (Philadelphia Flyers, SUI), Dennis Seidenberg (Boston Bruins, GER)\n\nI originally only had four defensemen on the preliminary roster, but ultimately believed that Seidenberg’s strong play as of late would erase any doubts that could exist. I was right, and now it’s up to Christian Ehrhoff to find his groove back and validate my original six. I overlooked Vancouver Canucks’ Yannick Weber before, but he’s on the race for the 6th/7th position with compatriot Luca Sbisa.\n\nGoalies (2): Frederik Andersen (Anaheim Ducks, DEN), Jaroslav Halak (NY Islanders, SVK)\n\nAndersen and Halak were absolute locks, but the terrible season of Calgary’s Jonas Hiller blew the door wide open for Thomas Greiss to step in, which will be a mere formality if he can maintain his lead amongst NHL goalies in Sv%.\n\nTeam North America\n\nOut: C Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, LW Boone Jenner\n\nIN: RW JT Miller (NY Rangers), G Matt Murray (Pittsburgh Penguins)\n\nForwards (10): Brandon Saad (Columbus Blue Jackets, USA), Connor McDavid (Edmonton Oilers, CAN), Nathan MacKinnon (Colorado Avalanche, CAN), Johnny Gaudreau (Calgary Flames, USA), Sean Monahan (Calgary Flames, CAN), Sean Couturier (Philadelphia Flyers, CAN), Boone Jenner (Columbus Blue Jackets, CAN), Ryan Nugent – Hopkins (Edmonton Oilers, CAN), Dylan Larkin (Detroit Red Wings, CAN), Jake Eichel (Buffalo Sabres, USA)\n\nI don’t want to spoil my incoming article, but I’m also still unsure where Ryan Nugent-Hopkins fits in the lineup for this team. However, Peter Chiarelli, the Oilers GM, co-picked the roster and it is still complicated to see him discard one of his guys. RNH is currently nursing an injury, which muffles the subject, but Edmonton’s media will create a uproar if the snub is repeated in June.\n\nLike Hansen on Team Europe, I’m a passionate supporter of Boone Jenner’s possible contributions to this squad, yet his name was forgotten this week in favour of JT Miller, who appeared on the radar with a breakthrough season for the Rangers but no one expected to see nominated so early. Although there was definitely a need for a right-winger with speed and decent size on the top nine, my preference went for a more polished offensive player.\n\nChiarelli and Stan Bowman cautioned for the necessity to watch closely the ups-and-downs experienced by rookie players, hence I was reluctant to include Eichel and Larkin on the initial roster, but, in the end, their pedigree and impeccable track record representing the USA at International tournaments pointed me in the right direction.\n\nDefenseman (4): Ryan Murray (Columbus Blue Jackets, CAN), Seth Jones (Columbus Blue Jackets, USA), Aaron Ekblad (Florida Panthers, CAN), Morgan Rielly (Toronto Maple Leafs, CAN)\n\nEkblad, Jones and Reilly comprise the trio of blueliners that will be asked to anchor the Young Guns’ defence, and Murray’s dependability, coupled with a flourishing chemistry with his Columbus’ partner, turned him into a favourite to land on the top 4. Nailing down the last three men will prove more difficult, but I’ll take my crack soon…\n\nGoalies (2): John Gibson (Anaheim Ducks, USA), Connor Hellebuyck (Winnipeg Jets, USA)\n\nTeam North America’s prospects on goal look way more promising now than last summer because all three men selected have exceled this season. Gibson was invited to the NHL All-Star game, and both Hellebuyck and Matt Murray got some games under their belt against the best in the World. The Jets goaltender string more than two dozen starts, and thus held the advantage to be the second name announced, but Murray’s first four presences were so impressive that no more scouting and evaluation was deemed necessary.\n\nTeam Canada\n\nOut: RW Corey Perry, LW Brad Marchand, D Alex Pietrangelo\n\nIN: C Tyler Seguin (Dallas Stars), D Marc-Edouard Vlasic (San Jose Sharks), G Corey Crawford (Chicago Blackhawks)\n\nForwards (10): Sidney Crosby (Pittsburgh Penguins), Jonathan Toews (Chicago Blackhawks), Steven Stamkos (Tampa Bay Lightning), Jamie Benn (Dallas Stars), Corey Perry, Ryan Getzlaf (Anaheim Ducks), Patrice Bergeron, Brad Marchand (Boston Bruins), John Tavares (NY Islanders), Jeff Carter (LA Kings)\n\nCanada’s embarrassment of riches up front produces enough headaches just to trim down the group to 13 forwards, so imagine trying to pick only nine. I saw Crosby, Toews, Benn and Bergeron as locks, and Stamkos and Tavares were right behind alongside Perry, whose duo with Getzlaf is seldom broken. With so many centres in the mix and Perry’s slow start on the rear-view, his absence is head-scratching, but should be corrected in June. Getzlaf’s high standard of play over almost a decade was taken into account, while Jeff Carter was a hunch I was reasonably comfortable with. The LA Kings forward performed strongly at the 2014 Olympics on a depth role, and his speed, versatility, two-way ability and experience have always been greatly appreciated by every Canadian management group.\n\nTyler Seguin was overlooked in 2014 and, despite his outstanding offensive array, I thought they would overthink his selection and leave the decision for later, much in the same way it will happen with Claude Giroux. As for Marchand, his evolution from pest to one of the elite left wingers in the game has been so surprising that I wagered things would just keep going his way “off the ice”. It wasn’t meant to be and he’ll have to keep his hot streak going, because I believe he’s in direct competition with Taylor Hall for a spot.\n\nDefenseman (4): Drew Doughty (LA Kings), Duncan Keith (Chicago Blackhawks), Shea Weber (Nashville Predators), Alex Pietrangelo (St. Louis Blues)\n\nDoughty, Keith and Weber were seen as untouchables on Canada’s defence entering the 2014 Olympics and their importance stands, even if Weber’s slow decline has been well documented and he may no longer be an NHL top pairing D. Pietrangelo carried Jay Bouwmeester, his St. Louis Blues’ partner, to Sochi, and I thought that gave him an inside path, but it seems that Vlasic’s steadfast style caught more admires there. The Shark being a left defenseman, which balances the group of four, was also important on this equation.\n\nRiskier options, like PK Subban, Kris Letang and Brent Burns, all righties, will have to wait a few months, while a third left-handed blueliner should be added, with Calgary’s duo of TJ Brodie and Mark Giordano in the mix.\n\nGoalies (2): Carey Price (Montreal Canadiens), Braden Holtby (Washington Capitals)\n\nThe lack of details regarding Price’s mysterious injury are concerning, but at the end of the day he’s still the best goaltender in the planet, and nothing indicates there’s a chance he won’t be fully prepared to play in September. Holtby is the odds-on Vezina front-runner and the best man to backup the Canadiens’ reigning MVP, while Corey Crawford forced his way into the conversation with a stellar campaign for the Stanley Cup Champions. Even if Roberto Luongo wills the Florida Panthers to an unlikely Championship run, it won’t matter, since the Blackhawks’ goaltender convinced Team Canada’s management that he’s as essential as the other two.\n\nTeam USA\n\nOut: C David Backes, C Brandon Dubinsky\n\nIN: LW Justin Abdelkader (Detroit Red Wings), C Derek Stepan (NY Rangers)\n\nForwards (9): Patrick Kane (Chicago Blackhawks), Joe Pavelski (San Jose Sharks), Blake Wheeler (Winnipeg Jets), Zach Parise (Minnesota Wild), Ryan Kesler (Anaheim Ducks), Max Pacioretty (Montreal Canadiens), David Backes (St. Louis Blues), Brandon Dubinsky (Columbus Blue Jackets), TJ Oshie (Washington Capitals)\n\nTeam USA’s attack also encompassed a few slam-dunks (Kane, Pavelski, Parise) and others almost no one would contemplate to leave out, namely Pacioretty, in spite of being in the middle of a frustrating season in Montreal, and Kesler, whose effectiveness has slipped slightly over the last couple of years. Wheeler, one of the NHL’s most underappreciated offensive dynamos, belongs in that group, and his rise as the second best American right-wing pressed Phil Kessel into a corner where his pure goal-scoring prowess may be left at home, a foolish cogitation not too long ago.\n\nBackes and Dubinsky are just the type of rugged, physical two-way players John Tortorella loves, but I have to disclose that their inclusion on my list had less to do with that, as I didn’t remembered who the coach was, and more with the USA’s usual fascination with that kind of players. Just remember Dustin Brown and Ryan Callahan’s presence in Sochi and the unexpected call up of Justin Abdelkader, whose experience complementing top players in Detroit was brought up as a basis for the selection.\n\nI was unsure about Oshie’s early inclusion until I realized the shootouts will be there once again, while Derek Stepan is a safe choice to provide some centre depth that can chip in regular offense, something the American’s don’t have in spades. To fill out the group, some tough decisions will be made on the wings, where, besides Kessel, stand out the candidacies of James Van Riemsdyk (who may not play another game this season), Bobby Ryan, Kyle Okposo and Chris Kreider.\n\nMeanwhile, Brandon Saad and Johnny Gaudreau would have been shoe-ins on this roster, but will have to settle for Team North America.\n\nDefenseman (4): Ryan Suter (Minnesota Wild), John Carlson (Washington Capitals), Ryan McDonagh (NY Rangers), Dustin Byfuglien (Winnipeg Jets)\n\nSuter, Carlson and McDonagh formed the backbone of the American defence in Sochi and their place was never in doubt. Byfuglien’s impact every time he steps over the boards is so remarkable at both ends of the ice, that he just bullied his way to a spot and no one bat an eye. He’s not yet someone Tortorella will fully trust to defend a lead late, but his cannon shot and strength cannot be ignored like happened in Sochi, when the USA could have used a catalyst of change during the showdown with Canada.\n\nThere’s also a balance between lefties and righties on this top four, and, if five blueliners were appointed, Justin Faulk (Carolina Hurricanes) was the next man up. I’m confident the veteran Paul Martin, still playing top-line minutes in San Jose, won’t be neglected, with the seventh spot turning into a bloodbath for a plethora of names, including Kevin Shattenkirk, Cam Fowler, Erik Johnson, Matt Niskanen, Jake Gardiner, Keith Yandle..\n\nGoalies (3): Cory Schneider (New Jersey Devils), Jonathan Quick (LA Kings), Ben Bishop (Tampa Bay Lightning)\n\nWith so many teams naming three goalies, at least it wasn’t the only one I thought would do it to buck the trend. Quick and Schneider, two goalies that interpret the position in entirely different ways, will continue to push the envelopes for their teams in hopes of securing the starting spot, while Bishop, despite being in the middle of a career-season, departs a step below. Quick, a third-string goalie in Vancouver 2010 and the leading man in Sochi 2014, may get the nod, but Schneider’s numbers are better across the board since he was elevated to top status in New Jersey.\n\nFinal Record: 105/128 ≈ 82%\n\nBeing a sports fan is not only about marvelling at watching the best do their thing. It’s not only about dreaming of reaching their level, trying to imitate them on the court, the rink, the field or a road that seems to never end. It’s also about experiencing the energy of the living organism that is a crowd during an on-going event: gasping, howling, heckling, suffering in anticipation of the worst and, yes, exploding in ecstasy at the sight of the incredible.\n\nTaking all of this in can become an addiction and quickly spun into the search for new sensations, different environments, fresh faces and impulses. Thus, in sport, just like in life, one way you can feed the addiction is to pack your things and travel, explore and discover other spaces and perspectives.\n\nJust to be clear, because the semantics on that paragraph seem to point to some life-altering trip, this is not what we’ll chronicle on this post. Just a slightly exaggerated preamble to indicate that the magic of traveling and the passion for sports go hand-in-hand perfectly, since there’s no better way of expanding your fandom than expressing it wherever your feet land.\n\nAnyway, recently I had the chance to spend eight days on the Czech Republic and manage to stay level-headed enough to be able to recount some things. The timing of the visit coupled with the scheduling of sporting events (blame football’s winter break) dictated that options were limited, so I only ended up attending a couple of ice hockey games. I visited Prague and the quaint university town of Olomouc, and in this article will expose my thoughts on what I saw, felt and perceived on their respective arenas.\n\nAdditionally, even if this isn’t a travel blog, I’ll take the chance to collect some personal remarks about extra-sports aspects of the places I got to know. These two sections will be clearly delimited, should one of them be outside of your interest.\n\nMy first stop was the capital of Central Europe’s hockey hotbed (sorry, Slovakia), so I’ll start there.\n\n*********\n\nHC Sparta Praha – PSG Zlín, Wednesday, 3rd February 2016\n\nThe Tipsport Czech Extraliga is the main ice hockey division in the Czech Republic and ranks fifth in average attendance amongst its European counterparts, after the Swiss, German, Russian (KHL) and Swedish leagues, with a bit over 5000 spectators per match. I took advantage of my stay in Prague to enjoy the battle between Sparta Praha, the home side that was close to clinching a playoff spot and cruising in second place on the league standings, and a Zlín squad desperate for points to approach the sixth and final postseason berth.\n\nStarting this season, the O2 Arena hosts the matches of Sparta’s ice hockey section, since their banner Tipsport Arena, located on the Holesovice district, is in need of significant renovations. Opened in 1962, the former home of Sparta, which hosted the Ice Hockey World Championships on four occasions and could accommodate 13,150 spectators, will be part of a complete makeover underway at Výstaviště, an extensive area with facilities used for concerts, exhibitions and other cultural and leisure activities. Some club services, like the main fan shop and youth team’s activities remain there, but all of the matches take place on Prague’s main venue, the O2 Arena, where more than 17,000 can appreciate the wonders of live hockey.\n\nOpened in 2004, this multi-purpose building is a modern infrastructure that can be reached easily from the Cêskomorávská metro station – on the yellow metro line(line B) – a half dozen stops from the city centre, and without surprise caters to the needs of its visitors, whatever type of spectacle they’re in for. The entrance occurs swiftly despite the presence of metal detectors, the concourses are spacious to accommodate thousands during intermissions, and there’s no shortage of bathrooms, which almost completely eliminates the nuisance of queues. Meanwhile, ample seating capacity at the concessions area was also not forgotten, a must due to the impressive multitude and diversity of food stalls, which supply almost every type of food you could be expected to find on an entertainment venue, including burgers, pizzas, hot dogs and Klobásas (a thick, spicy sausage served accompanied with slices of brown bread), tacos, baguettes, sandwiches, potato pancakes (a Czech favourite), chips…\n\nNevertheless, if the arena had all the comforts necessary, I was there to watch a hockey game and was presented with an entertaining affair between a home side dressed in the classic maroon and white colours and the visitors wearing a yellow and blue outfit. Sparta managed to take the lead on three separate occasions but every time Zlín came back to tie the match, wasting a golden chance to secure the two points late in regulation after a penalty was whistled to their opponents. Then, already in the overtime period (unfortunately, not 3 on 3), the tables turned and Zlín went down two men with a pair of penalties in quick succession, but Sparta couldn’t capitalize on the 5 on 3 despite a crowd standing in anticipation of the game winning goal. The match thus drifted into a deciding shootout, where Sparta scored twice to no response from the 2013-14 Czech Champions, setting the 4-3 final score line.\n\nAs for individual standouts, you couldn’t help but notice the reaction of the audience to the heroics of 25-year-old Miroslav Forman. Sparta’s home-grown C/RW scored the opening goal and also delivered on the shootout’s first attempt with a nice deke, deserving a farewell applause to the tune of a “Miro Formaaan“ call that, more than once, caught me humming for a similarly-named star player from my own football team. No idea if Forman also disappears in big games, though.\n\nMeanwhile, Forman’s goaltender, Tomáš Pöpperle, was also on the spot regularly and not for the best reasons, slowly getting back into position to confront the puck on the first two goals allowed, and always looking shaky managing rebounds. He also fumbled the puck behind the net on an opportunity that didn’t end up costing dearly by miracle. Pöpperle was a 5th round pick of the Columbus Blue Jackets in 2005 and played two NHL games back in 2006-07, but it’s fair to say that he was feeling the pressure provided by the recent acquisition of Danny Taylor, a 28-year-old Canadian goalie that was part of the LA Kings and Calgary Flames organizations and became one of only two non-Europeans on Sparta’s roster.\n\nActually, the great majority of the league’s lineups include only Czech and Slovak players, with “imports” being scarce, a different approach than seen in rival countries like Germany and Switzerland.\n\nStill, Sparta’s roster included a few players with NHL experience, brief in the cases of defenseman Michal Barinka, a former Blackhawks prospect, and Jaroslav Hlinka, who represented the Colorado Avalanche in 2007-08, and more pronounced for 39-year-old Jan Hlavac, who amassed 436 games for 6 NHL teams from 1999 to 2004 and during a second stint in 2007-08.\n\nAs one of the most heralded Czech teams, Sparta Praha has won six national Championships since 1987, when the nation’s league was instituted, and is looking to end a drought of eight seasons in 2015-16, thus their roster includes some interesting players that I wouldn’t be surprised to see moving overseas in the near future. I liked Juraj Mikos, a 27-year-old well-rounded Slovak blueliner that Toronto selected in the 5th round in 2007 and later played three years for the Toronto Marlies, but he’s unlikely to go back. So, I would put my chips on 23-year-old skilled centre Daniel Pribyl, a Montreal Canadiens 6th rounder in 2011 who is clocking at a point-per-game pace (38 in 38 games) in the Czech League, or 25-year-old Jan Buchtele, an undrafted left winger that looked strong on the boards and unafraid to drive to the net, having obtained over 15 goals in three consecutive seasons.\n\nBefore moving on, allow me a few words on the overall atmosphere around the ice. About 7500 spectators showed up to fill the lower bowl of the arena and the atmosphere was animated, with a markedly youthful crowd (Sparta has some type of campaign to deliver a bunch of free tickets for groups of students that apply their schools) providing a colourful vibe. This also extended to the enthusiastic group of organized home supporters, which were standing in close proximity to where I was seated and were relentless in their attempts to drown out the chants and reactions of around two hundred fans that made the trip from the Eastern Moravian town. No ill-advised incitements or provocations were thrown cross-rink and both groups confined themselves to backing up their teams, which made for an enjoyable experience throughout the game.\n\nAlthough the O2 Arena dominates the attentions, for hockey fans the attractions on the area don’t stop there, as the Harfa Shopping Center, located just to the right of the arena, hosts the Czech Hockey Hall of Fame. The space (entrance fee Adult: 140 CZK, ≈5.5€) presents an overview of the origins of the sport in the country, the national team’s main feats and trophies conquered – with evident focus on the Olympic Gold Medal earned in Nagano 1998 – plus the triumphs and contributions of the most successful clubs. It is also replete with memorabilia and multimedia records from the inducted members of the Hall of Fame, including esteemed NHL legends like Jaromír Jágr, Dominik Hašek, Peter Šťastný or Ivan Hlinka. If you have time, you may spend a couple of hours on the exhibition but I would say that most visitors are lured to the fun zone, where you can showcase your skills in shooting*, passing and stickhandling simulators or indulge on a game of air hockey.\n\nLeaving the exhibition, you can also check their small shop, with a decent chunk of NHL merchandise, namely club-themed hats, beanies, water bottles, pucks and a few jerseys, but the choice is a bit limited. So, if you’re after that, head to the centre of Prague and the JB Sport – Hokej Centrum shop (address: Dlážděná 1491/3, 110 00 Praha 1-Nové Město, http://www.jbsport.cz/ ) situated not far from Prague’s main train station. It is a 300m2 paradise for hockey fans in general, and NHL fans looking for jerseys, t-shirts, sweatshirts, hats, among others. And no, they did not sponsor this paragraph.\n\n*Well, if they could provide a right-handed stick fitted for a normal sized person so you can manage to wire the puck decently on the shooting gallery, it would be nice\n\n******\n\nTime for some random considerations regarding the city of Prague, in bullet form:\n\n– I won’t shock anyone by confirming that Prague is as picturesque, charming, full of history and (I suppose) romantic as advertised, but it’s still nice to understand that a stone-throw away from the hordes of visitors, you can find some peaceful alleyways and understated beauties. For instance, just drive off Karlova, the street that connects Staroměstské náměstí (Old Town Square) and Charles Bridge, to explore and get lost on the maize of lanes and crannies littered with restaurants, boutique shops and courtyards the bustle does not touch.\n\n– As you quickly get used when you travel, the most famous tourist attractions can be extremely underwhelming. In Prague, there’s no doubt this flag is waved proudly by the spectacle put in motion every hour at the Astronomical Clock. Literally hundreds – even in the peak of the Winter season – flock to stand in front of the medieval mechanism in order to watch a handful of small figures shake, clink and barely move for what amounts to 90 lost seconds. I mean, the clock is definitely a work of art but the “show” is so trite you just leave befuddled.\n\n– They’re pretty much conspicuous on Prague’s Old Tour but I still had to sneak in a mention of it. Do not miss the chance to taste the sweet Czech pastry by the name of Trdelník you’ll see getting roasted wrapped around sticks over a grill on street stands. This portion of rolled dough topped with cinnamon sugar is absolutely delicious, and so crispy its beehive shape fades perfectly as you eat. You can also have the inside coated with Nutella, jam or caramel to provide the perfect excuse to try it again and again.\n\n– The Old Town Hall Tower and the Žižkov Television Tower can be climbed to experience dramatic overviews of the city, but Prague isn’t short on much more budget-conscious options to observe great panoramas of different districts. The city is defined by several hills and reaching the top won’t cost a penny, with the rewards coming in troves. One example is Petřín Hill, a major recreational area which is adorned by several interesting buildings, including a lookout tower that resembles the Eiffel Tower in Paris. Meanwhile the Letná Park is an extensive green area ideal for a stroll, with his elevation providing great views of the historical area, just across the Vltava River. As for Vítkov Hill, home of the equestrian statue of legendary general Jan Žižka and the imposing National Monument, it is less visited but the view is equally impressive, especially towards the northern neighbourhoods of the city.\n\n– The Žižkov district (Prague 3) is a great option if you’re looking for affordable accommodation, with a wealth of mid-level hotels stationed on the quarter delimited in the north by Husitská/Koněvova street (on the foothill of Vitkov Hill) and in the south by Seifertova. The first road is served by several buses that put you on Florenc’s Metro Station (or even the city center (bus #207)) in five minutes, while Seifertova is connected by a plethora of trams that stop at the main train station and reach Wenceslas Square in less than a dozen of minutes. Additionally, Žižkov hosts a lively nightlife, with Bořivojova street, just off the Lipanská tram station, famous for the multitude of bars and restaurants. However, the atmosphere in the neighbourhood permanently feels calm and safe, even after dark.\n\n*****\n\nSandwiched between two shifts in Prague, I headed to the town of Olomouc, in the Moravia region. As before, first the match “report”:\n\nHC Olomouc – BK Mlada Boleslav, Sunday, 31st of January 2016\n\nMy first hockey game on Czech soil occurred on a rainy afternoon, confronting two teams in direct competition for the fifth position on the standings and trying, at the same time, to create some more breathing room above their desperate pursuers for the last playoff spot. The match was disputed at the Zimní (the Czech word for Winter) Stadion Olomouc, located just north of the city centre, on a zone where we can find a cluster with all the major sporting facilities in town, including a tennis centre, an aquatic centre, several football fields prepared for athletics and, more significantly, Sigma Olomouc’s football stadium, still proudly boasting the decorations left from the 2015 Under-21 UEFA European Championships.\n\nFor this hockey match, 4830 spectators congregated in the creaky arena, built in 1948, a number right in line with last year’s average of 4745, which not only means the stadium is constantly close to the full capacity of 5,500, but also that the extensive lines formed at the only two entrances should be an integral part of the game day experience. The number of seats is around 3800, and few spots were unoccupied, with the same ringing true on the standing section that saw the home club’s “ultras” sing along, jump in unison and proudly stretch their scarfs.\n\nNevertheless, at every intermission, the fans descended into the cramped hallway to mingle and pick up food or beer, which didn’t completely congest the area under the stands because a few opt to just head outside (and I’m pretty sure their re-entrance is in no way controlled). As for the menu available, you’ve surely intuited that it is way more restricted (beer, coffee, klobasa, mulled wine) than at the O2 Arena but, at least, I can attest that my portion of fries (or hranolky, as I hastily discovered after spending a good 45 seconds furiously pointing in an effort to make my order understandable to five pairs of bemused eyes) did the job.\n\nThe packed small venue, totally in favour of the hosts, looked engaged during the entire 60 minutes of a chippy, tight affair, and the mass did their part to encourage their players forward when the opportunity arose, functioning as an extra element and controlling the anxiety on the last minutes while the visitors pressed in search of the tying goal.\n\nThe game had started at lightning speed, with multiple chances for the hosts on the first two minutes, but never delivered on the promise of fireworks. Both teams worked hard to gain the opposing blue lines and keep the puck deep by getting an edge on board battles, but, to put it bluntly, skill didn’t abound. The ice was finally broken by Olomouc midway through the second period, with forward Dávid Buc taking advantage of a defensive lapse, which left him with too much space on the slot to bury a goal line pass past the Mlada Boleslav goaltender. The teams kept trading chances after the 1-0, with the posts entering the equation at times, but not even a frantic late charge from the visitors, which pumped 14 shots on the final period, resulted in more goals, as the home stopper, 26-year-old Tomáš Vošvrda, stood tall to lock two key points for HC Olomouc.\n\nThe 26-year-old Vošvrda was the most prominent man on the ice, pitching a 28-saves shutout and repeatedly denying the efforts of Mlada Boleslav’s first line, which is centred by 41-year-old David Výborný, a veteran who spent seven seasons (2000-08) on the NHL playing in a scoring role (317 points in 543 games) for the expansion Columbus Blue Jackets, and now devotes the heyday of his career to receiving orders from his father and team coach, 62-year-old Frantisek Výborný. Accompanying Výborný in every shift is another former NHLer, albeit one with a less decorated career, RW Jakub Klepis, who represented the Washington Capitals from 2005 to 2007.\n\nThe entire roster of Mlada Boleslav is comprised of Czech players, except for Slovenian Olympic defenseman Mitja Robar, and HC Olomouc’s is not much different, mixing in a few Slovaks on a group that features just one member that can claim to have savoured the best level of competition on the planet. Pavel Skrbek, a 37-year-old defender, was a 2nd round pick of the Pittsburgh Penguins in 1998 before playing a grand total of 12 games with Pittsburgh and Nashville.\n\n**********\n\nThe sixth largest city in the Czech Republic is a bit more than two hours away from Prague by train, is served with direct connections pretty much every hour and can easily function as a jumping point to the region of Moravia, which occupies the South-Eastern part of the country. Brno and Ostrava, the nation’s second and third biggest cities, are 1.5h/1h away should you be craving a more metropolitan feel, but if you’re looking for a town with a large, well-preserved historical centre that has yet to be discovered by most tourists, Olomouc beats the likes of Český Krumlov or the spa town of Karlovy Vary.\n\nAs you leave Olomouc’s train station, several trams connect to the city centre, where you’ll find a wealth of attractions, in a handful of minutes. The main one is the massive Holy Trinity Column looming on the Upper Square (Horní náměstí), a baroque monument that reaches 35m in height and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, but there’s also an Astronomical Clock adorning the Town Hall, which almost rivals the one in Prague in beauty and sees way smaller crowds at the hour mark (conversely, the spectacle doesn’t lag behind either).\n\nAlso popular among visitors is the tour of the plethora of fountains found around the city’s squares, depicting Roman Gods like Jupiter and Neptune, human motifs or mythical figures like Julius Caesar, the legendary founder of Olomouc. The town is distinctly ecclesiastic, with prominent religious buildings like Saint Wenceslas Cathedral or Saint Michael’s Church worth visiting if you’re into that kind of sightseeing.\n\nHowever, there’s another facet of Olomouc that features strongly on its daily life. The Palacký University (Univerzita Palackého v Olomouci, in Czech), the second oldest in the country after being established in the XVI century, brings hordes of outsiders to join the roughly 100,000 inhabitants, whereby during the school semesters one in four residents are students.\n\nThis means that the ambiance is distinctly juvenile and there’s a notable rate of the usual services directly targeted to students, including specific bars, cafes and restaurants. Unfortunately, my visit coincided with the examinations period and between-semesters down season, thus everything seemed to function at half-speed. Nevertheless, many of the different faculties, which are scattered around the urban area, occupy some of the most beautiful buildings on the historical centre, calling for a closer look inside, something facilitated when the fuss of a normal day is absent.\n\nOlomouc has a pleasant, compact city centre that is easily walked or cycled, with large parks on short distance and nature encircling the town, giving way to a Moravian countryside replete with castles, caves, swimming holes and natural reserves. My two days on the city weren’t enough to explore these options, but I definitely noticed that you can walk fifteen minutes from the main square in every direction and probably find yourself away from civilization.\n\nAnother gruelling cycling season is ahead of us (or already in full swing if you’re stationed on the other hemisphere), so it’s time to unpack what we can anticipate on the New Year. Since previewing every team in the World Tour in excruciating detail would be an incredibly hard task for the reader (yes, you, not me, I’m up for it), I decided to limit it to just a few teams I consider merit the recognition.\n\nThus, after a thoughtful process, I congregated them in the innocuous tagline of the “most fascinating teams” to watch in 2016. So, by now, you’re definitely asking what makes them “fascinating”? Well, the word can definitely lead to several interpretations, but my reasoning can be summarized on positive answers to these questions:\n\n– Is this team undergoing a radical change of approach in terms of goal setting for the new season?\n\n– Did the roster suffer a fair share of turnover, preferably with a few unexpected additions and subtractions that made experts scratch their heads in confusion and question whether it can all come up together in a successful mix?\n\n– Is the organization undergoing an identity crisis, with questions about the team’s future lingering because they’re long-time star(s) may be leaving soon and amassing wins is already difficult enough?\n\n– Have they added several sought-after names, even if relatively unexperienced at the top level, that make you yearn to follow their progress during the year?\n\nIf a WT team fits one or more of the criteria above, it was probably under consideration to appear on this article. But, entrances were at a premium, so I’m sorry if whom you were expecting didn’t make the cut.\n\nWithout further delay, read about the “Fascinating Four”, with an overview on why they were selected based on the past and the plausible future, their cyclists of interest, offseason moves, main race targets and talking points to take into account in 2016.\n\nTeam Giant – Alpecin\n\nSince the ascension to the top echelon of professional cycling in 2013, the German-registered team has been reliant on stage victories from their finishers. Harbouring the strongest sprinter in the entire peloton naturally pushes the entire squad towards taking full advantage of his talents, and Giant became wildly successful after developing the best lead out train in the World Tour, which boomed Marcel Kittel to several high-end wins.\n\nThe massive German amassed 13 of the team’s 41 triumphs during 2014 and made the best of the opportunities on the grandest stages, stretching his arms in celebration on a total of eight occasions distributed between the 2013 and 2014 editions of the Tour de France. However, last season was one to forget for the 27-year-old, who went down with an illness early on and never regained his best form throughout the year, missing out on a spot on the Tour roster. The relationship with the team deteriorated following that bold decision, and the common resolution to terminate it precociously ended up not being that surprising.\n\nCovering a loss like Kittel’s is nearly impossible, but Giant had to get used to it for much of 2015 and you couldn’t say the outcome left them in shatters. The team diversified its resources in order to claim other races, got some famous wins and promises more for 2016, aiming to build around two building blocks in John Degenkolb and Tom Dumoulin.\n\nThe 25-year-old sprinter can’t match his compatriot’s explosive speed, which partially explains his on-going search for a maiden Tour de France triumph, but he more than makes up for it as an elite classics’ rider, with his standout Milan – San Remo/Paris-Roubaix double in 2015 setting up the stage for many seasons to come. Degenkolb’s support system on his crowns’ defence will be headlined by Bert de Backer and Ramon Sinkeldam, winner of the Binche-Chimay-Binche, while Koen de Kort, Albert Timmers and Roy Curvers drive the well-oiled machine towards the finish line on flat terrain. Besides Kittel, Luka Mezgec, another powerful finisher, was also let go, which opens some opportunities for Nikias Arndt, a well-rounded fast man on the mould of Degenkolb, or Belgian Zico Waeytens, who at age 24 still has a bit of growth to do before becoming a reliable contributor.\n\nAs for Dumoulin, one of the World Tour’s breakout stars in 2015, the sky may be the limit for the talented Dutch. His physical attributes turn him into a contender on almost every type of race, from selective time trials or one-day races to week-long stage events, and the Vuelta showed that even a bonafide Grand Tour contender is blossoming in there way earlier than expected. The 25-year-old is entering his prime and the 2016 Giro d’Italia route seems tailor-made for Dumoulin’s ambitions, while leaving ample time to prepare for the Olympics, which will be his main focus on the year. However, should things kick off well at the Italian GT, he will be, once again, a lonely man amidst the wolves, as Giant’s roster doesn’t yet contain enough decent climbers to spread over different platforms.\n\nThus, the Dutch’s calendar places the general classification’s leadership role at the Tour de France and Vuelta squarely on the shoulders of Warren Barguil, who will be looking to break into the top 10 at his home GT for the first time. Expected to ride in close proximity with the French, the experienced Laurens Ten Dam is a vital acquisition to bolster Giant’s roster on the mountains and provide backup for Barguil, even if way more than a 35-year-old will be needed if the team’s GC ambitions continue to rise in the future. The 24-year-old French also showed some promise on a few bumpy one-day races (San Sebastian, Quebec, Il Lombardia) towards the end of 2015 and may look to meddle in again.\n\nAs for the rest of the squad, there’s no shortage of quality domestics, even if Simon Geschke stands out due to his Tour de France stage win last year, consequence of an audacious racing style that is good for more than the truly occasional success. The 23-year-old Lawson Craddock, one of Dumoulin’s main helping hands at the Vuelta, opted to move on to Cannondale before realizing his potential, but the Dutch-based team can take the hit since other diamonds in-a-rough were added to the fold, joining a program known to develop future mainstays.\n\nNorwegian Sindre Skjøstad Lunke, 22 years old, Denmark’s Søren Kragh Andersen, 21, and Sam Oomen, a 20-year-old Dutch, form a new batch of riders the organization hopes to nurture, with Oomen regarded as an extremely consistent GC prospect, and Andersen as a versatile cyclist that can target classics, time trials, selective finishes and breakaway sprints, therefore not far from the Dumoulin model.\n\nThere’s a lot to like on Giant-Alpecin’s prospects in 2016, with home-grown, top-notch talents still in evolution mixed with a base of savvy veterans and a few exciting youngsters that can grow in the shadows. This squad is an eclectic bunch that can approach almost every race with funded aspirations to make some noise, be protagonists and, at the same time, enjoy the freedom to risk big without dreading of falling short. Not many other World Tour teams figure to be able to boast the same.\n\nOrica GreenEDGE\n\nThe fifth WT season for the Australian outfit promises to be crucial on the swift transition the roster has experienced, as the organization scoops up an increased role on cycling’s landscape by spicing the roster with an international flavour and pointing towards new achievements.\n\nSince debuting on the top-echelon, Orica accumulated a wealth of triumphs every year with a squad geared for accruing stages decided at the line and almost unbeatable on team time trials, but the focus shifted when they were able to recruit a bevy of prospective GC contenders to work with.\n\nIn 2014, Colombian Johan Esteban Chavez and British twins Adam and Simon Yeats signed for the team and started the clock towards the moment Orica would hedge their bets on them. The 25-year-old Chávez already did a lot almost by himself at the Vuelta, taking two stages and the fifth overall position – by far the best GC result on the team’s existence -, and 2016 promises to be the time for the 23-year-old Yeats boys to seriously challenge for top ten finishes over three weeks. After all, it is the logical step after Adam shined at the Clasica San Sebastian (1st), Tour of Alberta (2nd) and GP of Montreal (2nd), and Simon hanged with the best on the Vuelta al Pais Vasco (5th), Tour de Romandie (6th) and Critérium du Dauphiné (5th). Thus, this season the Colombian climber will once again tackle the Vuelta-Giro combination hoping to reach the podium, while the twins will focus on creating havoc at the Tour de France and approach contention status for the young riders classification.\n\nAdam (L) and Simon Yates (R) will be looking for a premier role on this year’s edition of the Tour de France\n\nTo assist their spearheads on the multiple stage races disputed on European soil, the team snatched up some reinforcements, with 35-year-old Spanish veteran Rubén Plaza leading the way after an inspired season for Lampre saw him claim a couple of Grand Tour stages. His compatriot Amets Txurruka was also acquired to contribute experience, aggressiveness, tactical nous and some climbing punch, while Danish Christopher Juul-Jensen will assume a role of domestique similar to what he had at Tinkoff-Saxo, enjoying sporadic opportunities to try to capture something along the lines of his title at the Tour of Denmark.\n\nJuul-Jensen and Plaza are also accomplished time-triallists that can fill for the exits of the likes of Cameron Meyer, Brett Lancaster and Leigh Howard, long-time Orica affiliates. Meanwhile, Luka Mezgec, the 27-year-old Slovenian sprinter, was recruited to alternate with 21-year-old Caleb Ewan as the team’s go-to-guy on bunch finales, even if they may coincide on the Giro (and probably Vuelta lineup) as neither should be an option for the Tour.\n\nThe bright Australian youngster (11 wins as a neo-pro in 2015) someday will fight for sprints on the Grand Boucle, but for now the stage hunting will be reserved for Michael Matthews, who will look to pick up his first Tour triumph and conquer a maiden victory on a famous one-day race, such as the Milan-San Remo or one of the Ardennes Classics, after having barely missed out last year on a few occasions.\n\nMatthews’s consistency will be tested in 2016, but he’s also looking to shake off the emerging feud with compatriot Simon Gerrans, Orica’s leader since the team’s inception and a former Milan-San Remo and Liége-Bastogne-Liége winner. The 35-year-old had a 2015 season to forget, and saw Matthews rise up the charts to challenge for the team’s backing in selected races, generating questions about how the two stars will cohabit over the season. The first half should see them attack different targets, but if Gerrans achieves important results, Orica’s management will have a hard time leaving him off the Tour de France roster, where Matthews will have high expectations.\n\nMichael Albasini, another veteran, is also a puncher that regularly leaves his mark, especially in events held on his homeland, such as the Tour de Suisse or Tour of Romandie, while the cobbles races will be the main focus of Belgian Jens Keukelaire, who will try to build on the sixth position at last year’s Parix-Roubaix. Denmark’s Magnus Cort Nielsen, just 23-years-old, is another adaptable man the team is hoping to develop into a regular contender for sprints and one-day races.\n\nThe irreverent Simon Clarke was the most relevant exit on the offseason, leaving a trail of courageous riding that delivered a trio of GT stage successes’, but Orica GreeEdge’s steady work on the peloton will remain, with the main grinders on the roster returning for another season.\n\nOn this matter, Mathew Hayman (37-years-old) and Svein Tuft (38) tower over their teammates due to their road leadership and know-how, while, on the other side of the spectrum, the team added three Australian newbies in Robert Power (20), Jack Haig (22) and Alexander Edmondson (22). The first two claimed several noteworthy results in the most important under-23 events in Europe, namely on the general classification of the Tour de L’Avenir, whilst Edmondson established his credentials with the U-23 Tour de Flandres triumph last spring.\n\nCannondale Pro Cycling Team\n\nThe first season for the structure that resulted from the merger between Cannondale and Garmin-Sharp was one to forget, with the team picking up the first win as the end of March approached, and collecting a single triumph at the World Tour level, by David Formolo at the Giro d’Italia. The season total of 11 was embarrassing and it’s no surprise that the new Cannondale Pro Cycling Team oversaw the biggest roster turnover on the peloton.\n\nThe changes started right at the top of the heap, with two of the team’s lynchpins leaving. Daniel Martin’s gutsy riding led to prominent conquests at the Liège-Bastogne-Liège and Il Lombardia in years past, but the Irish was always marred by inconsistency, more times than not coming up close to superlative performances only to fall just short in dramatic fashion. 2015 was no different, with the 29-year-old crashing twice during the Ardennes Classics’ week, and finishing as the runner-up on three Grand Tour stages to ultimately come out empty-handed on the season.\n\nMartin will wear the jersey of another organization for the first time on his 9-year professional career, and Ryder Hejsedal will come close, ceasing a connection that lasted since 2007. The Canadian carried the team to its highest point, the Giro title in 2012, and still stokes something on the tank at age 35. The spirited effort on last year’s Italian GT was a clear demonstration, as Hesjedal fought to clinch the fifth overall position.\n\nHejsedal, Martin and Andrew Talansky tallied one combined win during 2015 (Talansky’s ITT National Championship), the entire team only 11 and, consequently, team director Jonathan Vaughters had to change the mix, replacing experience and slackness with a lot of hunger and youthful enthusiasm. However, the most surprising addiction is neither young nor fits the usual pattern of the squad’s acquisition, especially since the Garmin days, where it was always viewed as a hipster’s paradise.\n\nColombian Rigoberto Uran is an established, rather consistent Grand Tour contender that Cannondale can count on to climb and race the clock on time trials with the best. Moreover, a Giro route that suits his characteristics can prompt a serious podium challenge in 2016, with the Tour de France overall pursuit left for another veteran reinforcement. Pierre Rolland stepped out of the comfort zone to ride for a foreign team for the first time, and will be eyeing a fourth career top ten placement at home.\n\nThus, the dependable Uran and Rolland pretty much wash up the losses of Martin and Hejsedal, and lead the unit that will try to aim for mountain feats, which should also feature Portuguese André Cardoso and Australian recruit Simon Clarke, a wild card to throw into breakaways. Additionally, the squad hopes that Andrew Talansky can regain the form that put him on the lookout for a top five finish at a GT as recently as May 2014, when he triumphed on the Dauphiné, and a lot is also expected from two of his six countrymen on the roster. Joe Dombrowski impressed at the latest Tour of Utah (1st overall) and Tour of California (4th) and should translate his qualities into European soil, while Lawson Craddock was wrestled from Giant-Alpecin’s ranks following strong showings at the Tour de Pologne and Vuelta a Espana.\n\nDombrowski is 24-years-old and Craddock just 23, but they’re not even close to being the infants on the youngest roster in the WT peloton, which features just 5 riders above 30-years-old. That being said, the team has suffered in the past from the lack of a road captain and options continue to be scarce, with Matti Breschel, added to team up with Sebastian Langeveld on the tougher one-day classics, seemingly one of the better candidates to assume that burden.\n\nBut, getting back to what really drives this roster, the team’s brass will retain a close look on the evolution of talented 23-year-old Italian Davide Formolo, which besides the Giro also turned heads in Poland and Alberta, and compatriot Davide Villela, 10th on a star-studded Milano-Torino. The management group certainly hopes their development doesn’t flat line like happened to some teammates expected to deliver wins.\n\nA group that includes Tom-Jelte Slagter (26), that nonetheless conveyed some positive signs at Alberta and Quebec late last season, Moreno Moser (25), and Ramunas Navardauskas (27), the Lithuanian who should use the bronze medal obtained at the World Championships to jump up his performances and confidence on one-day races. Furthermore, Dylan Van Baarle (23), the out-of-nowhere winner of the 2014 Tour of Britain, passed through last season almost incognito, failing to capitalize on a sturdy frame that can be filled to pack a nice cobbles rider.\n\nAs for the new addictions, Vaughters mined some pearls from lower levels, especially on the North American circuit. There’s Canadian Michael Woods (29), a late-bloomer who featured in the top 10 of the Tour of Utah and Tour of Alberta, and neo-pro Toms Skujins (24), the Latvian-born winner of the Americas Tour after excelling at California, Alberta and the USA Pro Challenge, plus someone to keep an eye on in one-day events like the Tour de Flanders or Amstel Gold Race. To fill a clear need on the roster, Dutch sprinter Wouter Wippert was recruited after fighting tough and nails with Mark Cavendish and Peter Sagan at the Tour of California, while New Zealander Patrick Bevin (24) racked up podiums on off-grid races like the Tour of Taiwan and Tour of Korea.\n\nIn short, the Cannondale Pro Cycling Team is a society of Nations, with 16 countries represented on the 30-man group, and probably an unpredictable, diverse bunch like any other on the World Tour. Whether that is the receipt for unexpected successes all over the cycling world, or a discombobulated unit that will struggle to coalesce and find their stride, it’s anybody’s guess.\n\nTrek-Segafredo\n\nBack in 2011, when the Schleck brothers worked backstage to form the then named Leopard-Trek cycling team, the project seemed to have solid foundations. After all, Andy Schleck was a burgeoning Tour de France candidate, his brother Frank an extremely solid partner in crime on the mountains, and Fabian Cancellara was on top of his game and hoarding time trials and cobbles monuments for fun.\n\nSince then, however, despite joining forces with the Radioshack structure (former Discovery), things have continually gone downhill: the career of the younger Schleck span out of control due to injuries and ended prematurely, Frank’s decline hit swiftly when he approached the mid-30’s, and the Swiss saw his triumphs become less frequent due to bad luck, injuries and stiffer competition on the ITT events. Entering 2016, which his bound to be Cancellara’s last season, the team is at a crossroads, staring into the uncertainty about what type of formation they want to become, and which individuals will lead them moving forward.\n\nThe 2015 season was a difficult one for Trek, punctuated by wins few and far between, and with Spartacus, their inspirational leader, unable to deliver on his goals due to significant bad luck. Cancellara crashed badly at the E3 Harelbeke and couldn’t take part in the Tour de Flanders and Paris-Roubaix, competitions he has won 3 times each. After returning, he assumed the yellow jersey at the Tour de France on the second day, only to get caught on a massive collective fall one day later, being forced to dejectedly pull out.\n\nBauke Mollema assumed the team’s lead during the rest of the calendar’s top race and finished 7th overall, but not even the Dutch could fill the cavernous void left open during his debut season for Trek. Although he did his best by taking top honours at the Tour of Alberta and coming out 2nd in the general classification at the Tirreno-Adriatico. As for the rest of the team, a trio of stage wins at the Vuelta a Espana concealed some of the fragilities displayed throughout the season by a roster bereft of top-level talent, but including human capital to produce more.\n\nThe American-based team needed an injection of quality and added some interesting pieces in the offseason, starting with Rider Hejsedal, who despite being no young chicken showed last season that he can still contend for honourable GC positions. He will be the team’s captain at the Giro, guaranteeing that Trek will, at least, hold some presence on the overall contention, before supporting Bauke Mollema on the French Tour.\n\nBeyond the pair, Trek hopes other names on the roster can step up their game when the road leans in, with 27-year-old Julian Arredondo on the spot after being a complete non-factor last year, which followed a debut season brightened by a stage win and the mountains jersey at the 2014 Giro d’Italia. New recruit Peter Stetina also hopes to rejuvenate his career after an injury-riddled season for BMC, and both Frank Schleck (35) and Haimar Zubeldia (38) are back for another year, with the Luxembourger having shown at the Vuelta that the tank isn’t yet completely empty, and the Spaniard “just” two years removed from a top 10 finish at the Tour de France.\n\nFrank Schleck gave Trek a hard-fought triumph on stage 16 of the Vuelta a Espana\n\nThis isn’t exactly a sparkling unit but will have to suffice in the near future, as TJ Van Garderen, an American star they’ve coveted for years, has already decided to remain with BMC until 2017, and Vincenzo Nibali, whose contract with Astana will expire at the end of 2016, is, by now, nothing more than a pipe dream. However, a full on charm offensive for the 3-time GT Champion is already underway, as Trek secured an important sponsorship deal with Italian coffee giant Segafredo, and the country’s influence on the team has been steadily improving, the 2016 roster containing five Azzuri, the higher national count.\n\nAmongst those, 22-year-old Niccolo Bonifazio is a new face and an under-the-radar acquisition that can prove fruitful for the team in the long run. The former Lampre sprinter impressed in several World Tour races over 2015, including the Tour Down Under, the Tour of Pologne and the Milan-San Remo, where he was right up there with the favourites at the finish line. Bonifazio would probably have to defer to Sacha Modolo had he stayed on the Italian outfit, but at Trek he can expect to challenge fellow compatriot Giacomo Nizzolo for the sprint authority, as the 26-year-old is developing a reputation of always being in contention but never delivering the win, something the measly three triumphs over the last two seasons corroborate. Meanwhile, Fabio Felline will attack more selective finishes and one-day races, hoping to build on some eye-catching appearances at the Vuelta al Pais Vasco, Eneco Tour, Strade Bianchi or Critérium Internacional.\n\nAlso projected to deliver some triumphs are two Belgian speedsters. The 23-year-old Jasper Stuvyen carries some expectations regarding an evolution into a cobbles specialist capable of mustering explosive power compatible with stage wins like the one he got at the Vuelta. Meanwhile, the promising Edward Theuns – pried from TopSport-Vlandeeren after amassing a wealth of imposing results on several one-day races – isn’t as quick, but may become one of Belgium’s best hopes of regaining supremacy at the Tour de Flanders a bit down the road, with the chance to ride this season in support of Cancellara functioning as a crucial learning experience.\n\nAnother acquisition made by Trek that can pan out well is Kiel Reijnen, a 29-year-old American with a good track record on home soil, especially in mountainous races like the Tour of Utah and USA Pro Challenge, where he’s shown an ability to climb and finish on small groups.\n\nAs for the cyclists moving to other addresses, two losses in particular may prove costly. After several years of nurturing on the Trek organization, 23-year-old Bob Jungels was seduced by Etixx-Quick Step just as he was displaying signs of coming into his own, not only as a burgeoning time trial list but also as prospective general classification contestant, like happened at the Tour de Suisse (6th overall). As for Danny Van Poppel, which signed for Team Sky, reports indicate that the team wasn’t keen on offering him an extension, with the 22-year-old Dutch sprinter rising his profile later on the season after triumphs at the Vuelta (stage 12) and Tour of Wallonie, apparently in time to parlay the success into a deal with the British powerhouse.\n\nTrek-Segafredo seemed to take some positive steps heading into 2016, augmenting the number of riders that are capable of delivering wins at the highest level while providing more support for their leaders, but the roster is still far from impressive. With the post-Cancellara era on the horizon, what they’ll be able to achieve this season can influence greatly the decisions taken in the near future, and even put in peril the existence of the team.\n\nBonus pick:\n\nTeam Sky\n\nYou probably noticed that every formation analysed before is on the latter part of the World Tour club list ordered by budget. Thus, I didn’t want to let you go without touching on one of cycling’s giants, which happens to also be the richest cycling squad on the planet.\n\nSo, why do I believe Team Sky’s fortunes in 2016 are worth monitoring closely?\n\nThey’ll naturally go all-in for a fourth Tour de France overall title in five seasons, but the British outfit will also gun for other goals that have eluded them consecutively. In order to do that, they constructed a roster of unparalleled quality and depth that is fascinating to dissect.\n\nFront and centre is the quest for a success on the other two Grand Tours on the calendar, with the Giro roster already set to include two of the team’s glittering acquisitions. Mikel Landa, which took last season’s Giro by storm on his way to a breakthrough podium finale, left a tumultuous situation at Astana and fell on a perfect spot in Sky’s pecking order, where he’ ll benefit from a supporting cast that is the envy of GT contenders with many more races under their belts.\n\nThereby, the group will include Beñat Intxausti, a critical blow landed on rivals Movistar, fellow compatriot Mikel Nieve and maybe Nicholas Roche, which means they’ll enter the race with four riders that have managed to secure top ten finishes on the general classification of Grand Tours. Later, to attack the Vuelta, much of the same can be expected, with Landa, Intxausti and Nieve guaranteed and Sergio Henao and/or Leopold Konig also tipped to participate.\n\nIf you’ve been counting, that’s six top ten racers named on those lines, and the seventh is Christopher Froome, who will handpick the roster for the Tour. Richie Porte, his first lieutenant during the two Tour wins, will be wearing different colours in 2016, but Geraint Thomas, Wout Poels and even Peter Kennaugh are ready to climb the ladder and assume more of a load. Were they on a more modest formation, Thomas and Poels would be, by now, more accomplished performers, which speaks for the sheer depth of Sky’s roster.\n\nHowever, the team is also starving for a maiden triumph on one of cycling’s monuments, with the acquisition of 2014 World Champion Michal Kwiatkowski meant to address that. The Polish has shown flashes of brilliance on one-day races before, and both the Liège-Bastogne-Liège and Il Lombardia are right up his alley, with Colombian Sergio Henao and Norwegian Lars Petter Nordhaug as backup options. Meanwhile, on the cobbles, Geraint Thomas will be one of the main competitors for the Tour de Flanders and Paris-Roubaix, with Ian Stannard and Luke Rowe completing a British trio that seems to have amassed the necessary quantities of physical strength, know-how and smarts to outwit other candidates.\n\nI’ve already listed half of Sky’s roster and made it this far without a reference to the novel individual time trial World Champion, Belarus Vasyl Kiryenka, who may be so buried on the team’s chart that he’ll be handed limited opportunities to go full throttle in order to showcase his rainbow jersey.\n\nThe fact is, even with a calendar that stretches for ten months, such affluence of talent is bound to leave frustrated some gifted riders, obliged to work intensively for others without enjoying their own chance to shine. Take, for example, the case of 28-year-old Czech Leopold Konig, 7th in the 2014 Tour and 6th in the Giro last season, which will spend one of his prime years as the third or fourth option at the Grand Tours. Or Sergio Henao, whose versatility on one-day races and weeklong events has never been fully explored by Sky.\n\nOn the other hand, Ben Swift, Italian Elia Viviani, and Dutch newcomer Danny Van Poppel will receive ample leash to search for stage wins on bunch finales, even if the work won’t be cut out as the team lacks the structure to put them in perfect positions to succeed. Sky’s allergy to involve resources on the sprints mayhem drove Mark Cavendish out a few seasons ago, and doesn’t seem likely to change shortly, as the youngest faces on the roster are promising GC prospects in 21-year-old Brit Alex Peters, and Italian Gianni Moscon, who also dabbles in one-day classics.\n\nSir Dave Brailsford, the team’s architect, put in place a tremendous collection of talent and the expectations are as high as they can possibly be. Every move, every victory and every failure will be scrutinized, and capturing the Tour de France for the second consecutive time may already be considered insufficient if the rest of the results don’t follow suit. Thus, 2016 has to be considered an enthralling challenge for Team Sky.\n\nAnother year has gone, which means we can now snoop over a bin full of sports memories to cherish and remember. The turn of the calendar is as good a time as any other, so I decided to empty my brain and select what sports fans will take with them from 2015, including instances when athletes overcame their physical and mental limitations, superstars were born or regained some of the respect lost along the way, history books were re-written, or stunning upsets left fans agape.\n\nThe screening process was, obviously, enormously dictated by my own preferences (read more about it on the “About” page linked above), and the reader will disagree with a lot of my choices, but I tried to instil as much diversity as possible on the final list. I touched base on a variety of sports, even if, naturally, can’t recognize them all, and searched for a balance between individual and team-based achievements (or failures). An assortment of time frames was also pursued, with the action that enveloped the “moment” being reviewed ranging from a matter of few seconds, to entire matches or even week-long struggles.\n\nI wrote about the seven moments of 2015 that left a deeper mark on my memory and – I believe – in that of the many fans which follow the sports world on a daily basis. In addition, I later appointed five more which also stood out among the numerous monitored live throughout the year.\n\n(By the way, absent is any reference to the heroics of a racing horse on some posh trio of events held in the Spring, or a famous defensive play that occurred with forty something seconds to go on a Championship match that enjoys an unparalleled television audience)\n\nSo, without further delay, my breakdown of the main sports moments of the year in no particular order of appearance.\n\nUsain Bolt dodges Justin Gatlin’s challenge\n\nThere’s just no way around it. Every time Usain Bolt steps on the track for a major final, the World stops and waits to be amazed. However, before Beijing’s 2015 World Athletics Championships kicked off, the question marks surrounding the Jamaican were at an all-time high since Bolt was unable to surpass a really average (for his standards) 9.87 seconds showing obtained earlier in the year. He was definitely harassed, listening to the same type of discussion produced in 2011 and 2012, when his compatriot Yohan Blake posed a major threat, and rival Justin Gatlin, enjoying a third chance after two suspensions for doping, had been simply outstanding, putting together a 28 races unbeaten streak highlighted by a time of 9.74 seconds and several 9.8 postings.\n\nOn the Birds Nest, the American further increased is favouritism with a smashing triumph on his semi-final heat while Bolt had to cover ground on the end just to go through. However, with the stakes at the highest point, the pressure proved too much for Gatlin to handle. Bolt exited the blocks better than expected, and kept the rival in check throughout the race to narrowly defeat a stumbling Gatlin, crossing the finish line in 9.79 seconds. The winning margin was just 0.01 seconds, the tighter victory since Bolt broke through, and more than 0.2 ticks off his World Record (9.58).\n\nThe same stadium and city that 7 years ago saw the emergence of a myth wouldn’t see the start of his downfall like many expected, and some days later the 29-year-old doubled down, comfortably sweeping off the speed events with the titles on the 200-meters (with a “normal advantage” over Gatlin) and 4X100 relay. Bolt was ran over by a Segway-ridding cameraman as he was celebrating the double hectometre triumph but, just like during the competition, was able to walk away unscathed.\n\nWe’ll see if he can say the same after the Rio Olympics next year, where he’ll fight for a preposterous triple/double collection of gold medals, looking to cap off his legendary career with a third consecutive Olympic triumph on the 100m and 200m events.\n\nRobert Lewandowski nets five goals in nine minutes\n\nOk, this one is a bit of a cheat, since I wasn’t actually watching the act as it occurred, but following on twitter is close enough, right? A middle-of-the-week league tie, even if contested between the German Champions and the runner-up, can’t be considered appointment viewing, and there was a reason Bayern’s spearhead was on the bench to start the match. However, the half-time disadvantage for the hosts convinced Pep Guardiola that Lewandowski had to go in and the rest is history. Actually, four fresh entries on the Guinness World Records book were added after that night on the Allianz Arena.\n\nThe Polish striker needed just five minutes to tie the contest with an opportunistic tip after a superb assist by (former) teammate Dante, and off he was. Two minutes later, and just five touches on the ball in, a creeping shot from distance gave him a brace, and the hat-trick goal soon followed after he buried an attempt that initially found the post. By this time, social media was already exploding with an incredible achievement on a top-level competition, and no one really understood what was happening after the fourth strike in seven minutes!\n\nThe fifth, exactly 8:59 min after the ball first found the back of the net, came on a marvellous acrobatic volley from just inside the edge of the box, and became the cherry on top of a remarkable moment for the forward and the sport. Certainly, the type of performance for the ages football fans are lucky to watch once in a lifetime, and an impact substitution not even a master like Guardiola will be able to repeat. Eventually, his face on camera told it all.\n\nAs for the poor Wolfsburg side that was on the wrong side of the achievement, well…why did you sign Dante? (Sorry…but not really).\n\nRoberta Vinci shocks Serena Williams at the US Open\n\nMany, if not all, of the events on this list will linger on fans’ minds for a long time, but very few are in the running for the recognition as the greatest upset of all-time on its sport. This one happened because an “undistinguished” 32-year-old Italian decided “to play literally out of her mind” on the biggest stage and moment of them all, and thus spoil part of the legacy of one of the greatest figures in the history of tennis.\n\nSo many superlatives? Yes, it was that relevant, that unexpected and, so, so baffling. Serena Williams had already secured three quarters of a lifetime achievement, the calendar Grand Slam, adding her sixth Australian Open, third Roland Garros and sixth Wimbledon to stand on the verge of becoming the sixth human to manage something last seen in 1988. It seemed like a foregone conclusion that only Serena could stop Serena from lifting the trophy at the end of the fortnight on the Artur Ashe Stadium. Eventually, even the top players that could remotely hang on with her were on the other side of the draw (Muguruza, Kvitova, Azarenka, Halep) and dropping like flies.\n\nThe American was tested by Bethanie Mattek-Sands and her sister on the early rounds, but was never actually close to losing, and absolutely no one believed Roberta Vinci, the No 43 in the World, could go further than every other Grand Slam adversary in 2015. Serena breezed to take hold of the first set with a 6-2 score line and then the astonishing outcome took form. The crafty, experienced, yet Grand Slam semi-final debutant taking the 2nd set? No reason to panic, Serena had been there countless times before.\n\nVinci serving for the match? WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE? Can’t, won’t happen, right?\n\nThe crowd stood in disbelief as the Italian reached the 40-0 lead and the legend eyed the abyss. Serve, cross-court attack, half-volley…Veni, Vidi, Vinci. The unthinkable had materialized. The pressure weighted too much. A career dream was crushed on the finish line. Forever?\n\nVinci would lose the final to compatriot Flavia Pennetta the next day, on another emotional encounter, but the story was Serena’s choke. The 34-year-old undisputed Queen of women’s tennis came oh so close and blew it. She didn’t took the court again for a WTA match in 2015, and, even for someone like her, it’s tough to muster the strength to come back and push for the same feat again. If it happens, it would probably be as remarkable as whatever occurred in New York on that September evening.\n\nKatie Ledecky obliterates the competition at the Swimming World Championships\n\nAn American dominating an edition of Swimming World Championships is far from a unique circumstance. Michael Phelps took five gold medals from the 2009 meet in Rome and Ryan Lochte equalled the feat in Shanghai 2011, while Missy Franklin stepped it up a notch in Barcelona 2013, gathering six titles. Thus, Katie Ledecky’s performance in Kazan, Russia, last August might be a bit undervalued. Don’t be fooled though.\n\nNone of her compatriots had to swim as much as the 18-year-old freestyler on a frenetic week of competitions. No less than 6.2 km, 124 laps, and 63 minutes of racing as she navigated the heats, semi-finals, and finals of four individual events, including the gruelling 800m and 1500m, with the final of the last race, the longest on the calendar, preceding by just 20 minutes a close, highly-competitive 200m semi-final.\n\nThe Washington DC native kicked off her campaign with the triumph on the 400 meters, with a 3.89-seconds advantage never seen before, but was just getting started, showing clear signs of disappointment at the end after missing out on breaking the World Record. Lauren Boyle, the runner-up on the 1500m, touched the wall almost 15(!) seconds after Ledecky set her second World Record on consecutive days at the distance, and she also smashed the 800m mark by 3.61 seconds and her competitors to the tune of a 10-second gap. Because savouring triumphs on longer events is getting boring, Ledecky has added the 200 meters to her repertoire, and she was also successful despite all the miles on her body, gathering the speed to beat the last two world champions on the race. She, thereby, finished up a sweep of the 200, 400, 800 and 15000 meters free events, or the now called “Ledecky Slam”. Amid all this, anchoring the USA’s 4×200 meters relay win was just icing on the cake.\n\nThe four individual gold medals represent a unique feat for a female swimmer on the history of the World Championships, and only trail Phelps’ record of five in Montreal 2007. Back in 2012, Ledecky caught the World by surprise winning London’s 800m as a 15-year-old, and the youngest member of the entire US Olympic squad composed of more than 500 athletes. In 2016, she may well be the singular face of the entire Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games.\n\nCarly Lloyd erupts to take down Japan in 16 minutes\n\nWith no FIFA men’s international competition on the calendar in 2015, football’s brightest eyeballs shifted attention to the Women’s World Cup. Another stepping-stone tournament for the sport on the female side saw the USA and Japan clash for the third consecutive time in major competitions’ finals, four years after a dramatic World Cup final in Frankfurt, and three following Wembley’s Olympic decider. On the BC Place of Vancouver, the story ended up being way different from 2011, when the four goals were scored on the latter half of regulation and overtime, before the penalty shootout separated the parts.\n\nThis time, inside just 16-minutes, the heavily-supported Americans were well on their way to victory after mounting a four-goal blitz that stunned the reigning Champions. Carly Lloyd deflected in a low corner three minutes into the game, and one hundred seconds later found the ball inside the box to chip it past the Japanese goalkeeper for the second time. With the Nadeshiko dazed, Lauren Holiday took advantage of a terrible clear on the 14th minute to dash with an over the top, classy finish, while Lloyd completed the hat-trick with an astonishing strike from the halfway line that beat a reeling Kaihori. Things slowed down a bit after that, with the final result settled at 5-2 because a brave Japanese team never gave up on the match, but the day undoubtedly belonged to the Americans and to Lloyd.\n\nThe USA’s #10 midfielder propelled his side to a magnificent start, one rarely watched before at this level of competition, and completely decimated the opposition, leaving her mark on a major final like she had done in the 2008 and 2012 Olympics. Her inspired performance throughout the tournament merited the Golden Ball for best player of the tournament, and she will surely welcome another individual accolade in a few days, the FIFA Women’s Player of the Year award.\n\nFabio Aru and the improbable Tom Dumoulin go head-to-head at the Vuelta\n\nSelecting just a moment from a whole cycling season comprised of numerous races can be a monumental task. Others may answer with Alberto Contador’s epic recovery on the Mortirollo ascent during the Giro, Chris Froome’s irresistible (and much discussed) attack on the climb to La Pierre Saint Martin during the 10th stage of his second Tour de France triumph, or even Peter Sagan’s coup d’état, with the Slovak finally getting the best of an entire peloton to punch a signature victory on the World Championships.\n\nHowever, I believe no other battle symbolized what cycling racing is about like the up-and-down affair between Fabio Aru and Tom Dumoulin at the Vuelta, which culminated on the Dutch clinging to the dream until the last day, only to see it vanish through the fingers. The Giant-Alpecin rider was the talk of the first half of the competition alongside Colombian Esteban Chavez, with the pair alternating the ownership of the red jersey while in discussion of the plethora of stages culminating on steep terrain, but not many predicted the 25-year-old could keep up with the best as the difficulties accumulated. Not even after a superb victory over Froome at the end of stage nine.\n\nDumoulin would lose ground on a diabolic stage 11 at the Pyrenees, but his feverish fighting spirit provided for terrific moments of cycling as he almost strapped himself to the Vuelta GC contenders over the next few days on the mountains, managing to stay within striking distance while all his teammates lagged way behind unable to support him. Fabio Aru would command the race lead until Dumoulin shattered the opposition on the individual time trial at Burgos, turning the overall classification into a 3-second stranglehold between Dutch and Italian.\n\nDespite Astana’s push over the next two days, Dumoulin resisted stoically, even showing his muscles on the cobbled end at Ávila, before finally succumbing in dramatic fashion on stage 20, at the Puerto de la Moncuera, as Aru and friends were getting antsy and frustrated. The Maastricht-native, on his own, completely empty and defeated, sank further on the final kilometres to finish the Vuelta in sixth, but the fortitude and drive he displayed by leaving it all on the road against the odds impressed every observer. And were well worth of a reference here.\n\nStan Wawrinka ends Novak Djokovic’s Roland Garros bid\n\nA truly significant season for tennis saw two players end the year with three Grand Slam titles on their bags, and it could have been even more incredible had Novak Djokovic joined Serena Williams on the quest to complete the calendar Slam at the US Open. He couldn’t because the only stain on a brilliant 2015 season came in June, at the final of the only big tournament that still eludes the Serbian.\n\nThe 27-year-old entered the Court Phillipe Cartier still riding the wave of a drubbing over Rafael Nadal on the quarter-finals, only the second time (and first when healthy) that the King of Clay got beaten at Roland Garros, but also feeling the effects of a nervous five-setter against Andy Murray on the semi-finals. A match where the pressure of clinching the trophy that is missing on his curriculum started opening some cracks on the armour.\n\nStan Wawrinka came out ahead of Novakj Djokovic at Roland Garros\n\nLike happened to Roger Federer until 2009 – and to other tennis greats that never grasped success at the French Open – Djokovic may have shrunk with the tension and indomitable desire to win he had to cope with, but the final was much more than a favourite throwing out a golden opportunity. Stan Wawrinka had already backed up his candidacy to a second Grand Slam title with a straight sets victory over Federer, and was completely “in the zone” on that afternoon, unleashing his patented one-handed backhand with devastating precision left and right after “Nole” took the inaugural set.\n\nDjokovic had to settle for the finalist’s plaque and a deserved rising ovation from the crowd after a crushing defeat, but snapped out of it pretty quickly. Wimbledon and the US Open would later join his other nine titles amassed in 2015, and that loss to the Swiss was the only in 28 matches at Majors and one of just six during the best season of the Serbian’s career. The setback in Paris just fuelled his hunger for more, and he figures to come back in 2016 even more prepared to complete his own career Slam and equal Nadal and Federer, his contemporaries that figure on a shortlist of just seven names.\n\nAnd, on a quicker sequence, five more moments that just missed the main cut:\n\nLionel Messi gets back to marvelling the world\n\nFootball fans around the world blessed 2014-15 for the return of the best Lionel Messi. The Argentinian wizard used the motivation after a crushing World Cup Final defeat to power Barcelona to a second treble in four seasons, as the Blaugrana hoarded the Spanish League, the Spanish Cup and the Champions League. Messi’s brilliance was at its peak on two key moments.\n\nFirst, on a monumental goal against Bayern Munich on the 1st leg of the European Cup semi-final, turning Jerome Boateng into a bowling pin before chipping the ball beautifully over Manuel Neuer. A few weeks later, he embarrassed Athletic Bilbao’s defence on the Copa Del Rey decider with a preposterous slalom which started near the convergence of the sideline and center circle and ended with him slotting the ball home.\n\nThe Ski Flying World Record falls twice on a weekend\n\nHumanity’s enduring fascination with flying finds resonance on ski jumping and especially its more risky offshoot, ski flying, where athletes really push the limits of audacity. 2015 brought the first jump over the 250 meters barrier, as Peter Prevc flew exactly that in February, 14th, during a World Cup event held in Vikersund, Norway.\n\nThe Slovenian broke by 4 meters the mark set on the same venue, in 2011, by Norwegian Johan Remen Evensen, but his reign would be really short. To the delight of the home crowd, Norway’s Anders Fannemel soared 251.5 meters the following evening under perfect conditions and stole the record back. The next few years promise new heights, since Vikersund and the “rival” infrastructure in Planica, Slovenia, have suffered renovations and extensions, so expect more superlative images of sportsman gliding on air for what appears like an eternity. After all, the 300m may be just around the corner.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors complete a fairytale season with first NBA title in 40 years\n\nThe gang of Stephen Curry had shown flashes of domination in years past, but only after Steve Kerr took over the bench everything clicked into perfection. The Golden State Warriors won 67 games on the NBA Regular Season led by an unique sharpshooter enjoying an MVP-worthy performance, an incredible sidekick (or should I say Splash Brother?) in Klay Thompson, and Mr. Everything Draymond Green, and then weaved through the minefield that are the Western Conference playoffs to reach the NBA Finals.\n\nAgainst LeBron James’ Cleveland Cavaliers, the most exciting team in basketball conquered the ultimate prize in six fascinating games, undoubtedly benefitting from an opponent that was weakened by substantial injuries to star actors, and had to place too much of a burden on the planet’s best player over the last decade. Nevertheless, with or without the injury bug, no team lighted out arenas all over North America throughout the season like the Warriors, and the series may well be reminisced before long by the passing of the torch from James to Curry as the world’s finest player.\n\nJapan stuns South Africa at the Rugby World Cup\n\nEngland welcomed what can probably be considered the biggest sports competition of 2015, and beyond the hosts’ lacklustre performance, and New Zealand’s uncontested supremacy towards reclaiming the spot at the top of the mountain, there was time for a completely unexpected result. Rugby’s history places the sport amongst those where the minnows stand lower changes of humbling the giants, whereby Japan’s courage and faith belied the norm and they were deservedly rewarded for it.\n\nOn that afternoon at Brighton, the “Brave Blossoms” did justice to their name, deciding to press for the winning try as the final whistle approached instead of settling for a potential equalising kick. The Springboks had already sweated way beyond their expectations to conjure a narrow lead, were left to crawl in order to protect it, but they probably never realized a team with only one World Cup triumph could pull off the tournament’s greatest shock ever.\n\nThat is, obviously, until New Zealand-born Karne Hesketh finalised the 34-32 score in injury time, with what looke"
