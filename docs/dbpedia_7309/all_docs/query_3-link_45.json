        "text": "Introduction (Disclaimers)\n\nAnnexations and Occupations | Country Splits and Unifications | Moving Countries | Roving Clubs | Raving Latinatics (Super Silly Stuff)\n\n'host' index | 'guest' index\n\noverview of European 'double' champions\n\nAbout this document\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the course of history, many football clubs have competed in the league and/or cup structure of more than one country, whether due to annexation or occupation (including colonial rule), or because their country split or unified (or both). Some countries, in particular Poland, have had their borders moved by hundreds of kilometres in the twentieth century, with obvious consequences for the clubs in the areas involved. In addition, some clubs have opted to play across the border, in particular in the United Kingdom where the football associations do not actually correspond to independent states, but also elsewhere.\n\nThis file aims to highlight various aspects of such performances abroad, organised according to the aforementioned four types of moving across borders (or borders being moved):\n\n1. Annexations and Occupations\n\n2. Country Splits and Unifications\n\n3. Moving Countries\n\n4. Roving Clubs\n\nNote that these four categories are not entirely disjoint; in particular the distinction between the first two may be contentious in some cases (e.g. the Baltic countries, which for practical reasons are discussed together with all other Soviet republics in the second category); likewise between the first and the third, and one may debate the voluntarity of Derry City's choice to play in the Republic of Ireland rather than the section of the island that did not separate from the United Kingdom. The last category also includes a short section on currently Greek clubs that were founded in current Turkey; in this case it was not the borders moving but the clubs (or rather the Greek community on which they were based).\n\nAt the end of this introduction, two alternative indexes are given, one by 'host' country and one by 'guest' country.\n\nThe focus is on teams doing well across the border (winning leagues or cups, or reaching far in either) but examples of less successful clubs are given as well where it seemed justified (and the relevant information was available). Therefore, treatment of e.g. constituent republics of the former Soviet Union or Yugoslavia is not 'equal'; dominant regions (Russia and the Ukraine for the Soviet Union, Serbia and Croatia for Yugoslavia) obtain a less detailed presentation than the other regions.\n\nAn overview of European clubs winning championships in two different countries (according to customary definitions in world football) is given at the end.\n\nIn the results overviews throughout the document (the parts in pre-formatted text), 'foreign' winners of a competition (whether championship or cup) are given in bold face, runners-up in italics (with one exception from this convention, in the section on overseas clubs in the French cup).\n\nIn addition, the text sections have a number of clubs shown in bold face to stress their performances, according to the discretion of the author. The text sections also have non-English words shown in italics, as customary in English language texts.\n\nDisclaimers\n\nGiven the topic, some political background here and there is unavoidable; no offence is meant to any of the countries or ethnic groups involved though the subjective point of view of the author may shine through occasionally.\n\nIn all section and subsection headings, we refer to current and past names of countries (or regions which de facto (if not de iure) have or had independent football competitions, e.g. Northern Cyprus and Kosovo); this does of course not necessarily mean that the entire country or region was part of the football structure of another one but (apart from cases under the fourth category of 'roving clubs') at least some part nowadays within its borders. More precise information is given in the text. Also note the use of contemporary notions may be anachronistic in texts discussing historical situations.\n\nInclusion or non-inclusion of various cases may be debatable.\n\nFor instance, the one-season (1999/00) appearance of Gozo FC in the Maltese top division is not included, nor the unique semifinal appearance of SK Victoria Wanderers in the 2016/17 MFA Trophy competition, although the island of Gozo has its own FA and an independent league structure (in which Gozo FC never played but Victoria Wanderers do, albeit with only a couple of second level titles and one GFA cup win, in 2008/09, to show for it), as the fact that Gozo is an integral part of Malta has not been in doubt since 1800 (and football came to the islands much later), and its FA has never entertained any thought of independent membership of FIFA or UEFA (and would stand no chance of obtaining it).\n\nLikewise, there is no separate mention of e.g. the performances of the Canary Islands clubs Las Palmas and Tenerife in the Spanish football structure, nor of the Ceuta and Melilla sides (as these clubs have never played outside of Spain), but the single season of Atlético Tetuán in the Primera División is mentioned as the town is now in Morocco.\n\nAdditional information and factual corrections (whether on football, geography or history) are very much welcomed by the author; political comments will be ignored.\n\nIndex by 'Host' Country\n\nNB: 'guest' countries in alphabetical order between brackets.\n\nAlbania (Kosovo)\n\nArmenia (Azerbaijan)\n\nAustralia (Malaysia | New Zealand)\n\nAustria

and Occupations\n\nGermany | Hungary | Italy | Bulgaria | Croatia | Albania | Japan | South Africa | Morocco | Ethiopia | China | India | Indonesia | Israel | Jordan | Egypt | France | Portugal | Spain | Russia\n\nJust before and during World War II, several countries, in particular Germany and Hungary, increased their territory dramatically, forcing clubs from other countries to enter their competitions. Some of these enjoyed great success – in particular Rapid Wien and Nagyváradi AC (known in Romanian as CA Oradea) who won league titles in the invading country. Also, Korean clubs were successful in Japan just before the second World War. Apart from shortlived war-time occupations, this section also includes various cases of annexations lasting for decades and a few colonial curiosities. Note that the extension of the Soviet Union by the three Baltic republics as part of the Hitler-Stalin pact is discussed under the disintegration of the Soviet Union, and the special case of Karelia under border moves.\n\nGermany\n\nAustria | Belgium | Czech Republic | France | Luxembourg | Poland | Slovakia | Slovenia | Ukraine\n\nStarting with the 1938 Anschluß of Austria, clubs started entering the German championship and cup competitions from countries that had organised their own before. The other countries involved were the Czech Republic (first the Sudetenland, later also 'German' clubs (and army or air force selections) from the Protektorat Böhmen and Mähren, which also had its own league for the 'Czech' clubs), France (the Alsace and Lorraine regions, which had been German prior to World War I), Luxembourg and parts of Poland (including the area around Lwów which is now in the Ukraine; note that the regions which were part of the German Reich during the interbellum are discussed under 'moving borders').\n\nAustrian clubs in the German football structure 1938-1944\n\nAfter the 1938 Anschluß, the Austrian league was incorporated as Gauliga 17 (Ostmark) in the German football structure, which culminated in an annual, national championship playoff between the champions from the Gauligen. Only once did the Austrian representatives fail to reach the semifinals of the German championship, and even then (1944) the Austrian team lost to the eventual winners by the odd goal in five in the quarterfinals. Rapid won both the German championship and cup once, Vienna won one cup and reached the championship final, which Admira also managed once (suffering a record final defeat in the process); see also the overview of Austrian participations in the German Cup during the war.\n\nNote that the Austrian football structure itself remained largely independent of the German one, with at least two exceptions.\n\nFirst, the third tier Salzburger Kreisklasse comprised four (formerly) Austrian and seven Bavarian clubs in the 1938/39 season; among the Austrian clubs, 1.Salzburger SK 1919 finished runners-up behind FC Traunstein while 1.Oberndorfer SK 1920 were eighth and last; both SV Maxglan (from Salzburg) and DTB Bischofshofen withdrew during the season.\n\nSecondly, in the Vorarlberg/Bodensee region clubs from both sides of the current border played in one regional league (Bezirksklasse Bodensee-Vorarlberg, in which the German clubs VfB Friedsrichshafen, SV Weingarten, FC Wangen, FC Lindenberg, VfL Lindau, TSV Meckenbeuren, FV Ravensburg, FV Langenargen and TSG Friedrichshafen played against the Austrian clubs FC Lustenau, SV Feldkirch, TUS Dornbirn, FC Bregenz and FC Bludenz; FC Lustenau won this league in both 1938/39 and 1939/40 before finishing runners-up behind VfB Friedrichshafen in 1940/41).\n\nHowever, this situation had only partially to do with the Anschluß: already at the end of 1930, the Vorarlberger Fußballverband successfully requested the Süddeutscher Fußballverband to include the top clubs from the Ländle in the south German league structure, in order to enable these clubs to play more matches, and in both 1931/32 and 1932/33 four Vorarlberg clubs played in the second level Kreisliga Bodensee-Vorarlberg, which FC Lustenau won in both seasons, thus qualifying for the post-season Aufstiegsgruppe Süd-Bayern from which they failed to secure promotion to the Bezirksliga Süd-Bayern, one of the two top level leagues in Bavaria at the time, amid many others in Germany. Therefore, this is really a case of roving clubs and discussed in more detail there.\n\nIn addition, some Czech, Slovak and Slovenian clubs played in Austrian regional leagues during the war; see the relevant notes in the sections on Czech clubs in the German football structure, Slovak clubs in the German football structure and Slovenian clubs in the German football structure.\n\nChampionship (Deutsche Meisterschaft) 1939: finalists: Admira Wien (0-9 vs Schalke 04) 1940: semifinal: Rapid Wien (1-2 aet vs Dresdner SC; Rapid won playoff for 3rd place vs Waldhof Mannheim (4-4 aet, 5-2)) 1941: winners: Rapid Wien (4-3 vs Schalke 04) 1942: finalists: Vienna (0-2 vs Schalke 04) 1943: semifinal: Vienna (1-2 vs FV Saarbrücken; Vienna lost playoff for 3rd place vs Holstein Kiel (1-4)) 1944: quarterf.: Vienna (2-3 vs Dresdner SC) Cup (von-Tschammer-Pokal) 1938: winners: Rapid Wien (3-1 vs FSV Frankfurt) semifinal: Wiener Sport-Club (2-3 vs FSV Frankfurt) quarterf.: Vienna (1-3 vs 1.FC Nürnberg) Grazer SC (1-6 vs Wiener Sport-Club) 1/8 final: Admira Wien (0-6 vs Vienna) Austro-Fiat Wien (1-5 vs Rapid Wien) Austria Wien (2-3 vs Grazer SC) Wacker Wien (0-1 vs Wiener Sport-Club) NB: the German and Austrian teams had played separately until the quarterfinals, for which 4 teams from both areas qualified. 1939: semifinal: Rapid Wien (0-1 vs 1.FC Nürnberg) Wacker Wien (1-1 aet, 2-2 aet, 0-0 aet, lost on draw vs Waldhof Mannheim) 1940: semifinal: Rapid Wien (0-3 vs Dresdner SC) quarterf.: Wiener Sport-Club (1-2 vs Fortuna Düsseldorf) 1/8 final: Wacker Wien (1-5 vs Wiener Sport-Club) 1941: semifinal: Admira Wien (2-4 vs Dresdner SC) quarterf.: Austria Wien (1-4 vs Schalke 04) 1/16 fin.: Rapid Wien (3-5 vs Admira Wien) 1942: 1/16 fin.: Vienna (0-4 vs NSTG Falkenau) 1943: winners: Vienna (3-2 vs LSV Groß Hamburg)\n\nBelgian clubs in the German football structure 1940-1944\n\nThe eastern Belgian region around Eupen and Malmedy (where German is spoken) was annexed by Germany during the second World War. Nothing is known about participations by the existing local clubs (such as FC Eupen, founded 1920, and La Jeunesse d'Eupen, founded 1919 as Verein für Jugend und Volksspiele Eupen as a merger between two older clubs (FC Fortuna Eupen and Eupener Ballspielverein, both founded 1908) and renamed to the French version of their name in 1920) in the German league structure during the war.\n\nChampionship No data available. Cup No data available.\n\nCzech clubs in the German football structure 1938-1944\n\nThe Sudetenland was incorporated in the German Reich on Sep 29, 1938. From the 1940/41 season on, also clubs from the Protektorat Böhmen und Mähren, roughly corresponding to the remainder (apart from the Sudetenland) of the current Czech Republic, entered the German league structure. Note that nearly all clubs listed below were either army (Militär SV) or air force (LSV = Luftwaffen Sportverein) teams or artificial sports units (NSTG = Nationalsozialistische Turngemeinde) enforced by the nazis; only Warnsdorfer FK existed as a club prior to the German takeover (they were forcibly merged into NSTG Warnsdorf in 1939/40 and relegated from the top level of the Sportbereich 18 Sudetenland as reigning champions).\n\nMost of the clubs listed below played in a separate regional league for the Sudetenland, but some clubs based in the current Czech Republic entered regional leagues of current Austria during World War II: NSTG Budweis won the highest league of Oberösterreich (then called Oberdonauer 1. Klasse) in 1941/42; Militär SV Brünn reached the semifinals of the regional league of Niederösterreich (then known as Niederdonau) in the same season; and in 1943/44 and 1944/45, RSG Lundenburg played in the regional league of Niederdonau, finishing third in their first season; in 1944/45, their local rivals TuS Lundenburg also played in that league, as did SC Engerau from a suburb of Bratislava, now the capital of Slovakia; already in 1939/40, DTSV Znaim had played in the regional league of Niederdonau and DSK Brünn in 1941/42.\n\nNote that DFC Prag played in the German championship 1902/03.\n\nCity name correspondences: German Czech Brünn Brno Brüx Most Budweis České Budějovice Falkenau Sokolov Graslitz Kraslice Lundenburg Břeclav Olmütz Olomouc Prag Praha Warnsdorf Varnsdorf Witkowitz Vítkovice Znaim Znojmo Championship (Deutsche Meisterschaft) The following clubs from the current Czech Republic played in the Endrunde of the German championship. 1939: group st.: Warnsdorfer FK (4 0 0 4 5-16 0) 1940: group st.: NSTG Graslitz (4 0 1 3 7-22 1) 1941: group st.: NSTG Prag (4 0 1 3 3- 8 1) 1942: qual. rd.: LSV Olmütz (0-1 vs Vienna) 1943: prel. rd.: Militär SV Brünn (2-5 vs Vienna) 1944: qual. rd.: Militär SV Brünn (3-6 vs Vienna) qual. rd.: NSTG Brüx (0-8 vs 1.FC Nürnberg) Cup (von-Tschammer-Pokal) 1940: 1/16 fin.: NSTG Witkowitz (1-9 vs Wiener Sport-Club) 1942: 1/8 final: NSTG Falkenau (1-4 vs Blau-Weiß Berlin) 1943: 1/8 final: Militär SV Brünn (1-5 vs 1.FC Nürnberg) 1/16 fin.: NSTG Brüx (0-14 vs Vienna)\n\nFrench clubs in the German football structure 1940-1944\n\nDuring the war, Germany occupied the French regions Elsaß (Alsace) and Lothringen (Lorraine), which were under dispute between the two countries (or rather cultural entities, as Germany as a state is a more recent invention) for centuries (clubs from the areas played in (southern) Germany prior to the first World War). Alsatian clubs obtained their own Gauliga, while those from Lorraine (FV Metz, TSG Saargemünd and TSG Merlenbach) were included in the Westmark with teams from the Saar and Rheinland-Pfalz. FV Metz were runners-up in the Westmark each of the three seasons they played (1941/42, 1942/43 and 1943/44) but never qualified for the Endrunde. All clubs involved played before in the French league structure, though of course under different names, e.g. FV Metz as FC Metz, FC Mülhausen 93 as FC Mulhouse and SG SS Straßburg as SC Red Star de Strasbourg (not to be confused with their better known town rivals RC Strasbourg, who were known as Rasen SC Straßburg during German occupation). Apart from the clubs from Mülhausen and Straßburg mentioned below, also FK Mars Bischheim, FC Bischweiler, FC Hagenau, FC Hüningen, FC Kolmar, SpVgg Kolmar, SpVgg Dornach (Mülhausen), ASV Mülhausen, FC Stern Mülhausen, FC Sankt Ludwig, SC Schiltigheim, SV Schlettstadt, TuS Schweighausen, Rasen SC Straßburg, SV Straßburg, FV Walk, SV Wittelsheim and SV Wittenheim played one or more seasons in the Gauliga Elsaß.\n\nCity name correspondences: German French Bischweiler Bischwiller Hagenau Haguenau Hüningen Huningue Kolmar Colmar Merlenbach Merlebach Metz Metz Mülhausen Mulhouse Saargemünd Sarreguemines Sankt Ludwig Saint-Louis Schlettstadt Sélestat Schweighausen Schweighouse Straßburg Strasbourg Walk La Walck Championship (Deutsche Meisterschaft) The following clubs from current France played in the Endrunde of the German championship. 1941: group st.: FC Mülhausen 93 (6 0 1 5 9-28 1) 1942: quarterf.: SG SS Straßburg (0-6 vs Schalke 04) 1943: prel. rd.: FC Mülhausen 93 (1-5 vs FV Saarbrücken) 1944: 1/8 final: FC Mülhausen 93 (3-5 vs KSV FV/Altenkessel Saarbrücken) NB: FV Saarbrücken was the contemporary name of current 1.FC Saarbrücken; they entered into a 'war-time union' with Altenkessel in 1943/44. Cup (von-Tschammer-Pokal) 1941: 1/8 final: FV Metz (0-3 vs 1.SV Jena) 1/16 fin.: FC Mülhausen 93 (0-4 vs Stuttgarter Kickers) 1942: 1/8 final: SG SS Straßburg (1-15 vs 1860 München) 1/16 fin.: FC Mülhausen 93 (0-2 vs VfB Stuttgart) 1943: 1/16 fin.: FC Mülhausen 93 (1-4 vs VfR Mannheim)\n\nLuxembourg clubs in the German football structure 1940-1944\n\nFootball clubs from Luxembourg were incorporated in the Bezirksklasse Gruppe West within the Sportbereich Moselland. In the first season teams from the Grand Duchy entered, 1941/42, FV Stadt Düdelingen won this league and then triumphed in a playoff against the winners of the Bezirksklasse Gruppe Ost (Eintracht Kreuznach), earning entry to the qualifying round of the German championship. One year later, in 1942/43, FK Niederkorn won the same group but lost the final of the Moselland championship 4-5 on aggregate against TuS Neuendorf (after winning the first leg 3-0). In 1943/44, Schwarz-Weiß Esch were the winners of the western group and played the Moselland final, but after winning 4-1 at home they were destroyed 0-8 by TuS Neuendorf in the second leg in Koblenz.\n\nSo FV Stadt Düdelingen are the only club from current Luxembourg to have played in the Endrunde of the German championship; they also reached the cup quarterfinals once during the war.\n\nAll clubs involved played before in the Luxembourg league structure, though of course under different names, e.g. FV Stadt Düdelingen as Stade Dudelange, Schwarz-Weiß Esch as Jeunesse d'Esch and FK Niederkorn as Progrès Niedercorn. Other renamed Luxembourg clubs to play at the highest German league level during this time were Moselland Luxemburg (Spora Luxembourg), SV Düdelingen (US Dudelange) and Schwarz-Weiß Wasserbillig (Jeunesse Wasserbillig, who did not reach the highest level in their home country until 1958 but played in the 1943/44 Bezirksklasse Gruppe West of the Sportbereich Moselland).\n\nCity name correspondences: German French Luxembourgish Düdelingen Dudelange Diddeléng Esch Esch Esch Luxemburg Luxembourg Lëtzebuerg Niederkorn Niedercorn Nidderkuer Wasserbillig Wasserbillig Waasserbëlleg Championship (Deutsche Meisterschaft) 1942: qual. rd.: FV Stadt Düdelingen (0-2 vs Schalke 04) Cup (von-Tschammer-Pokal) 1942: quarterf.: FV Stadt Düdelingen (0-7 vs 1860 München) 1943: 1/16 fin.: FK Niederkorn (0-3 vs Spfr.

Likewise, clubs from Westpreußen (e.g. from Elbing/Elbląg), the Freistaat Danzig (an autonomous entity consisting of the harbour city Danzig/Gdańsk with its suburbs such as Neufahrwasser/Nowy Port) and Ostpreußen (with as major city Königsberg/Kaliningrad, nowadays part of Russia) entered the German football championship as a matter of course since the beginning of the twentieth century.\n\nThe relevant areas were incorporated as Warthegau (with as main cities Posen (which had belonged to Germany before the first World War but had fallen to Poland afterwards) and Litzmannstadt) and Generalgouvernement (with as main cities Krakau, Lemberg (currently Lviv in the Ukraine), Lublin, Radom and Warschau; all five served as the central city of a district league). Other cities known to have had teams playing in the district leagues forming the Gauliga Generalgouvernement include Biala-Podlaska, Cholm, Demblin, Luchow, Reichshof, Tschenstochau and Zamosch. The air force side based in Demblin reached the 1/8 finals of the 1942 cup.\n\nTwo clubs from currently Polish cities, Sian Peremyshl (San Przemyśl in Polish) and Lemko Sianik (Łemko Sanok) took part in a Galician league tournament together with several Ukrainian teams.\n\nNote that like in the Czech case, most clubs listed below were either army or air force units or German police teams (OrPo = Ordnungspolizei); DWM denoted Deutsche Waffen- und Munitionsfabriken.\n\nCity name correspondences: German Polish Biala-Podlaska Biała Podlaska Cholm Chełm Demblin Dęblin Krakau Kraków Litzmannstadt Łódź Luchow Luchów Górny Posen Poznań Reichshof Rzeszów Tschenstochau Częstochowa Warschau Warszawa Zamosch Zamość Championship (Deutsche Meisterschaft) 1941: qual. rd.: LSV Posen (2-2 vs Preußen Danzig, lost on draw) 1942: prel. rd.: OrPo Litzmannstadt (1-8 vs VfB Königsberg) qual. rd.: LSV Boelcke Krakau (2-5 vs Planitzer SC) 1943: 1/8 final: OrPo Warschau (1-5 vs VfB Königsberg) prel. rd.: BSG DWM Posen (1-3 vs OrPo Warschau) 1944: qual. rd.: LSV Mölders Krakau (1-4 vs VfB Königsberg) qual. rd.: BSG DWM Posen (0-7 vs STC Hirschberg) Cup (von-Tschammer-Pokal) 1942: 1/8 final: LSV Adler Demblin (1-4 vs TuS Lipine) 1943: 1/16 fin.: Praga Warschau (3-5 vs Militär SV Brünn) 1/16 fin.: BSG DWM Posen (0-4 vs VfB Königsberg)\n\nSlovak clubs in the German football structure 1940-1945\n\nIn 1944/45, SC Engerau played in the Gauklasse Süd of the regional league of Niederdonau, finishing fifth and last. In the northern section of the same regional league, two clubs from Lundenburg (now Břeclav in the Czech Republic) participated. Before the war, Engerau had been known as Ligeti SC, an ethnic Hungarian club founded in 1899 in the Bratislava suburb of Petržalka; as such they had twice entered the Czechoslovak amateur championship, in 1925 and 1931, as champions of the ethnic Hungarian federation in Slovakia, the Slovenska MLSz; the club was dissolved in 1945.\n\nCity name correspondences: German Slovak Hungarian Engerau Petržalka Ligetfalu (later Pozsonyligetfalu)\n\nSlovenian clubs in the German football structure 1940-1944\n\nIn the three seasons from 1941/42 to 1943/44, various clubs from current Slovenia played in the Gauliga Steiermark together with a number of clubs from current Austria. In the 1941/42 season, BSG Reichsbahn Marburg (probably identical to NK Železničar Maribor, founded 1927) finished second, while DSG Marburg were fifth and DSG Cilli sixth. In the 1942/43 season, when the league was split into a northern and a southern section, SV Rapid Marburg finished second in the southern section, just ahead of BSG Reichsbahn Marburg (third) and DSG Cilli (fourth). In the 1943/44 season, Trifail (most probably the same as NK Rudar Trbovlje, founded 1921) finished equal on points with winners BSG Rosental, who progressed to the Styrian final against northern group winners Reichsbahn SG Graz thanks to a better goal average. The two clubs from Maribor, SV Rapid and BSG Reichsbahn finished third and fourth in the southern group.\n\nIn addition, clubs from Aßling (Turn- und Sportgemeinschaft Aßling), Krainburg (SK Krainburg), Veldes and Cilli entered the Carinthian league structure during one or more war seasons.\n\nCity name correspondences: German Slovenian Aßling Jesenice Cilli Celje Krainburg Kranj Marburg Maribor Trifail Trbovlje Veldes Bled\n\nUkrainian clubs in the German football structure 1940-1944\n\nDuring World War II, the region around Lviv (Lemberg, Lwów), which had been Polish during the interbellum but became part of the Soviet Union after the war, was incorporated in the Generalgouvernement. Little is known about the regional championship of Galizien played between German army teams: in the 1942/43 season, Ostbahn SG Lemberg were leading the league around Christmas with 7 points from 4 matches, ahead of DTSG Lemberg and W.H.-Nachrichten (both 4 points from 3 matches), while in the 1943/44 season Ostbahn SG Lemberg won that league ahead of DTSG Lemberg and LSV Adler Lemberg, qualifying for the final round of the Gauliga Generalgouvernement, in which they finished fifth and last.\n\nIndependently of that, a West Ukrainian championship was apparently played on 3 occasions, with as champions Ukraina (Lviv) in 1942, Skala (Stryj) in 1943 and Vatra (Drohobych) in 1944. It is also reported that two clubs from currently Polish cities, Sian Peremyshl (San Przemyśl in Polish) and Lemko Sianik (Łemko Sanok) took part in an abandoned Galician league tournament in 1944, together with several Ukrainian teams; of these two, Sian Peremyshl had also entered the inaugural 1943 edition, and reached the final of a regional cup tournament in 1942, drawing 2-2 with Ukraina (Lviv) before losing the replay 2-4; possibly this refers to the West Ukrainian championship mentioned above.\n\nHungary\n\nCroatia | Romania | Serbia | Slovakia | Slovenia | Ukraine\n\nDuring the second World War, Hungary annexed a number of regions which had belonged to Hungary (as part of the Habsburg Empire) prior to the first World War.\n\nThe first team from outside the current borders of Hungary to enter the Hungarian first division was Kassai AC (from Košice/Kassa in Slovakia). Afterwards, various clubs from areas now in Romania or Serbia entered; these areas had large Hungarian minorities and most of the clubs involved presumably had a sizable quantity of ethnically Hungarian players. Most successful were the clubs from Transylvania: Nagyváradi AC (from Oradea/Nagyvárad, close to the Hungarian border) won the Hungarian championship 1943/44 (as the first team from outside Budapest to do so), 13 points clear of Ferencváros and Kolozsvári AC (from Cluj/Kolozsvár), who reached the cup final in the same season. Below all 'foreign' clubs to play in the first Hungarian league division are listed.\n\nCroatian clubs in the Hungarian football structure 1939-1944\n\nIn the 1941/42 season, Csáktornyai SC from the currently Croatian city of Čakovec played in the southern Trans-Danubian group (Dél-Dunántúl) of the third Hungarian league level (NB III), finishing 5th. No further records of their participation (or that of any other club from towns in current Croatia) in the Hungarian league structure during the second World War are available.\n\nDuring the interbellum the same club (known as Čakovečki ŠK) had entered the Slovenian regional league in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, winning it in 1937/38 but missing out on promotion to the Yugoslav top level.\n\nSee also the note on a club from the region in the Hungarian football structure during the Habsburg Empire.\n\nCity name correspondence: Hungarian Croatian Csáktornya Čakovec\n\nRomanian clubs in the Hungarian football structure 1939-1944\n\nNagyváradi AC (from Oradea/Nagyvárad, close to the Hungarian border) won the Hungarian championship 1943/44 (as the first team from outside Budapest to do so), 13 points clear of Ferencváros and Kolozsvári AC (from Cluj/Kolozsvár), who reached the cup final in the same season. Both clubs had been promoted in 1940/41, Kolozsvári AC as winners of the Erdély (Transylvania) group of the Hungarian second division, and Nagyváradi AC as its champions – NAC had not entered the second division but was recognised as the strongest club from Erdély.\n\nIn addition, we mention that Nagybányai SE played at the second Hungarian league level in all seasons from 1940/41 to 1943/44, with their best season being the last one when they were runners-up in the eastern group of the second division, missing out on promotion against Szentlőrinci AC; they had also been runners-up in the Mátyás group in 1942/43. A number of other Transylvanian clubs played one or more seasons at the second level of the Hungarian league structure during this period, including other clubs from Nagyvárad (Nagyváradi Törekvés, at the second level from 1940/41 to 1942/43) and Kolozsvár (Kolozsvári Bástya SE, at the second level between 1940/41 and 1943/44; Kolozsvári MÁV, at the second level from 1941/42 to 1943/44, finishing third in the Mátyás group in the first two of these seasons; and Kolozsvári EAC, playing at the second level in 1941/42 and 1943/44) as well as clubs from Szatmárnémeti (Szatmárnémeti SE, also known as Szatmári SE, at the second level in 1940/41 and 1941/42) and Marosvásárhely (Marosvásárhelyi SE from 1941/42 to 1943/44, finishing fourth in the Mátyás group in 1942/43; Székelyföldi MÁV, playing at the second level in 1942/43 and 1943/44, twice finishing fifth in their group; Marosvásárhelyi NMKTE, playing at the second level in 1942/43 and 1943/44; and Marosvásárhelyi Attila, who only played at the second level in 1943/44).\n\nCity name correspondences: Hungarian Romanian Kolozsvár Cluj (Cluj-Napoca) Marosvásárhely Târgu Mureș Nagybánya Baia Mare Nagyvárad Oradea Szatmárnémeti Satu Mare Championship (1st division) 1941/42 5.Nagyváradi AC 30 14 8 8 81-52 36 13.Kolozsvári AC 30 8 6 16 51-78 22 1942/43 2.Nagyváradi AC 30 19 4 7 85-49 42 10.Kolozsvári AC 30 11 4 15 60-70 26 1943/44 1.Nagyváradi AC 30 24 1 5 78-36 49 3.Kolozsvári AC 30 15 6 9 54-45 36 1944/45 2.Nagyváradi AC 3 2 1 0 6- 3 5 6.Kolozsvári AC 3 1 2 0 5- 3 4 NB: the 1944/45 season was abandoned after a few rounds and replaced by an (unofficial) Budapest competition in the fall of 1944. Cup 1944: finalists: Kolozsvári AC (2-2, 1-3 vs Ferencváros)\n\nNagyváradi AC (Nagyváradi Atlétikai Club) were founded in 1910. After Transylvania came to Romania (from the Hungarian part of the Habsburg Empire) after the first World War, they were renamed as CA Oradea (Clubul Atletic Oradea). Prior to World War II, the club played at the Romanian top level for six seasons (1932/33 to 1937/38), finishing runners-up in 1934/35. During the last two seasons before World War II, they were at the second level. After the war, the club was renamed Libertatea and joined the top flight in the 1946/47 season (the first official championship in Romania after the war); in 1948 the club was renamed IC Oradea, and as such won the Romanian championship 1948/49, making them one of the few clubs to have won league titles in two currently existing countries.\n\nHowever, the club itself no more exists. After another name change to Progresul (under which name they still finished third in 1951) the club were relegated in 1954; they bounced back after just one season at the second level (in which they reached the 1955 cup final, losing 3-6 aet vs CCA, the later Steaua București) and celebrated their new top flight status by winning the 1955/56 national cup (2-0 vs Energia Metalul Cîmpia Turzii). They were renamed CS Oradea before the 1957/58 season and relegated as such in 1958. After another name change, to CSM Crișana Oradea, they gained promotion back to the top flight in 1962, but were relegated after just one season, while local rivals Crișul (who later became FC Bihor Oradea) were promoted in that same 1962/63 season. Rather than playing at the second level again, Crișana were dissolved.\n\nKolozsvári AC (Kolozsvári Atlétikai Club) played as CA Cluj (Clubul Atletic Cluj) in the Romanian second division 1934/35 and 1935/36. They lost their second level status following the reduction of the division from six to two regional groups, and played at regional level until World War II. After their success within the Hungarian league structure during the war, they were included in the Romanian top flight 1946/47 under the name Ferar Cluj. As such, they finished 6th in 1946/47 and 9th in 1947/48 before merging into CFR Cluj (the local railway team), who had withdrawn from their second level group halfway through the 1947/48 season. The merger club was named CFR Cluj and took Ferar's place in the top flight but the identity of the railway club. This club won eight Romanian league championships as CFR Cluj-Napoca as well as four Romanian cups (all since the 2007/08 season).\n\nNote that another club from Cluj, Universitatea Cluj, moved to Sibiu in 1940, following the Vienna Dictate that transferred a sizable portion of Transylvania including Cluj and Oradea to Hungary. Having finished second in one of the four second level groups (behind Crișana Oradea) in 1939/40, the club entered the Romanian first level as Universitatea Sibiu in 1940/41. Under that name they reached the 1941/42 Romanian cup final (which they lost 1-7 to Rapid București; they had earlier lost the 1933/34 final to Ripensia Timișoara as Universitatea Cluj and later, after moving back to Cluj in 1945, played three more finals under different names again, losing the 1948/49 final as CSU Cluj to CSCA București (later Steaua) and finally winning the trophy in 1964/65 as Știința Cluj, beating Dinamo Pitești (later Argeș) in the final); half a century later, they lost the 2014/15 cup final (as Universitatea Cluj) to Steaua.\n\nSee also the notes on clubs from the region in the Hungarian football structure during the Habsburg Empire, such as Temesvári Kinizsi, who won regional championships in Hungary during the first World War and then claimed six consecutive national championships (as Chinezul Timișoara) in Romania from 1921/22 to 1926/27 after the region became Romanian.\n\nSerbian clubs in the Hungarian football structure 1939-1944\n\nCity name correspondences: Hungarian Serbian Apatin Apatin Bezdán Bezdan Kúla Kula Óbecse Bečej Szabadka Subotica Topolya Bačka Topola Újvidek Novi Sad Verbász Vrbas Zenta Senta Zombor Sombor Championship (1st division) 1941/42 13.Újvideki AC 30 10 5 15 47-86 25 1942/43 11.Újvideki AC 30 10 6 14 52-63 26 1943/44 6.Újvideki AC 30 12 7 11 68-58 31 1944/45 12.Újvideki AC 2 1 0 1 3- 9 2 NB: the 1944/45 season was abandoned after a few rounds and replaced by an (unofficial) Budapest competition in the fall of 1944.\n\nNovi Sad lies in the Vojvodina, an autonomous province in Serbia with a considerable Hungarian population (but also other ethnic minorities). Újvideki AC were founded in 1910; its home town Novi Sad/Újvidek came to Yugoslavia (from the Habsburg Empire) in 1918, and the club were renamed Novisadski AK; as such they reached the semifinals of the 1935/36 championship (played in knock-out format), which they lost 0-1 to Slavija Sarajevo. The club was dissolved in 1944. Apart from Újvideki AC, many clubs from smaller towns currently in Serbia played at the second or third Hungarian league level. These included Szabadkai VAK (at the second level from 1941/42 to 1943/44, finishing fourth in the Zrínyi group in 1942/43 and again in the southern group in 1943/44), Óbecsei Bocskai (at the second level in 1942/43 and 1943/44, finishing sixth in the Zrínyi group in 1942/43), Topolyai SE (at the second level in 1942/43 and 1943/44, finishing seventh in the Zrínyi group in 1942/43), Újverbászi CSE (from Verbász; at the second level from 1941/42 to 1943/44, their best finish ninth in the Zrínyi group in 1942/43), Zentai AK (at the second level from 1941/41 to 1943/44, their best finish ninth in the southern group in 1943/44), as well as Bezdáni SE and Szabadkai SC, both relegated after one season at the second level in 1941/42; in addition the following clubs played at the third level in the 1941/42 season: Apatini SE, Kúlai AFC, Bácska Szabadkai AC, Újvidéki Vasutas AK and Zombori SE.\n\nSee also the notes on clubs from the region in the Hungarian football structure during the Habsburg Empire.\n\nSlovak clubs in the Hungarian football structure 1939-1944\n\nCity name correspondences: Hungarian Slovak German Érsekújvár Nové Zámky Neuhäusl Kassa Košice Kaschau Losonc Lučenec Lizenz Losoncapátfalva Opatová (now part of Lučenec) Pozsóny Bratislava Preßburg Championship (1st division) 1939/40 13.Kassai AC 26 5 3 18 29-79 13\n\nKassai AC (Kassai Atlétikai Club) were founded in 1903; in the 1920s they played in the MLSz (Hungarian) championship in Slovakia (there were three separate federations in Slovakia alone, and more in Bohemia and Moravia), reaching the MLSz Slovak championship final in 1927 (lost 2-4 vs Rapid Bratislava) and 1928/29 (lost 1-2 to Ligeti SC, also from Bratislava).\n\nThey joined the eastern section of the Slovak-Lower Carpatian division in 1934/35, one of six second level leagues in Czechoslovakia at the time (the 1935/36 winners, Rusj Užhorod, from a town now in the Ukraine, managed promotion to the top level state league, Státní Liga). After twice finishing third and once second, KAC won this division in 1937/38, but finished sixth and last in the promotion tournament (from which two clubs qualified to the Státní Liga 1938/39).\n\nSlovak football separated at the end of 1938 and set up its own league in 1939, but this did not cover all of current Slovakia: no teams from Košice/Kassa (or other towns close to the Hungarian border such as Komárno/Komárom, Nové Zámky/Érsekújvár or Lučenec/Losonc) ever joined it, as Hungary annexed the area in 1938. After their relegation from the Hungarian top flight 1939/40, KAC reappeared as Kassai Rákóczi AC at the Hungarian second level from 1941/42 to 1943/44, finishing third in the Rákóczi group in 1942/43. Other clubs from current Slovakia to play at the Hungarian second level during the second World War were Losonci AFC (at the second level from 1941/42 to 1943/44, finishing runners-up in the northern group in the 1943/44 season), Érsekújvári SE (at the second level from 1941/42 to 1943/44, finishing third in the Széchenyi group in 1942/43), Losoncapátfalvai TSE (who were sixth in the Matra group in their only second level season 1941/42) and Kassai VSC, who finished eleventh in the Rákóczi group in their only second level season 1942/43, but may be a disguise for Železničiari Košice, a club founded in 1920 which finished third in the second level Východoslovenská župa of the Czechoslovak league structure in 1923 and later evolved into FK Lokomotíva Košice.\n\nKassai (Rákóczi) AC did not reappear after the war; the only Košice club to be included in the Czechoslovak top flight 1945/46 (and the first ever to reach that level) were newly founded ŠK Jednota Košice, and at the second level we only find ŠK Sparta Košice, who merged with Železničiari Košice at the end of that season; this merger club also 'swallowed' ŠK Jednota (meanwhile renamed Dynamo) in 1949 and eventually became FK Lokomotíva Košice. See the remarks on Kassai VSC in the previous paragraph.\n\nSee also the notes on clubs from the region in the Hungarian football structure during the Habsburg Empire.\n\nSlovenian clubs in the Hungarian football structure 1939-1944\n\nThe region of Prekmurje (Muravidék), with as main towns Lendava and Murska Sobota, was occupied by Hungary from 1941 to 1944 (and by Germany during the last year of the war). Nafta Lendava, a club founded 1903 as Lendvai Football Egyesület and the first football club founded in current Slovenia, played in a regional Hungarian league also involving clubs from Szombathely, finishing second in their group in 1942; this club played several years at the Slovenian top level, finishing last in the 2011/12 season after which they were dissolved (and a new club called Nafta 1903 Lendava was founded instead).\n\nIt is not known whether any club from Murska Sobota, whether related to later Slovenian top flight club and 1994/95 cup winners Mura (founded 1924, renamed Mura 05 in 2005, as which they won the Slovenian cup in 2019/20) or not, entered the Hungarian football structure. After World War II, the region became part of Yugoslavia.\n\nCity name correspondences: Hungarian Slovenian Lendva Lendava Muraszombat Murska Sobota\n\nUkrainian clubs in the Hungarian football structure 1939-1944\n\nDuring the second World War, Hungary also annexed Carpathian Ruthenia (Transcarpathia, Kárpátalja), which during the interbellum had belonged to the Slovak part of Czechoslovakia, and went to the Soviet Union (more precisely, the Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic) afterwards. From this region, two clubs from the main city Ungvár, namely Ungvári AC and SK Rusj Ungvár (also listed as Ungvári Rusznyi and in either form the Hungarian version of Rusj Užhorod) played at the second level of the Hungarian league structure. Ungvári AC won promotion to the top level in 1943/44, as winners of the northern group of the second division ahead of Salgótarjáni SE, but their debut season was abandoned after a few rounds in the fall of 1944, with UAC in last position after suffering three losses. The national championship was then replaced by an (unofficial) Budapest league.\n\nOther clubs from the town have played at the top level of the Czechoslovak (Rusj Užhorod) and Ukrainian (Zakarpattya Uzhhorod) league structures.\n\nTwo other towns from the region were represented at the second level in Hungary as well: Beregszászi FTC finished 15th from 16 clubs in the NB II Felvidéki csoport (a regional second division group) in 1939/40 and disappeared to the third Hungarian level for the seasons 1940/41 to 1942/43, while Munkácsi LSE finished twelfth in the northern group in their only second level season 1943/44. Both Beregszász and Munkács had clubs playing at the second level in Czechoslovakia before the second World War. In the first northern group of the third level NB III 1940/41 we also find clubs from other towns in the region: Aknaszlatinai BTE, Nagyszőllősi Beszkid and Várpalánkai Turul SE.\n\nSee also the notes on clubs from the region in the Hungarian football structure during the Habsburg Empire.\n\nCity name correspondences: Hungarian Ukrainian Slovak Russian Romanian Aknaszlatina Solotvyno Slatinské Doly Solotvina Ocna Slatina Beregszász Berehowe Berehovo Beregowo Bereg Munkács Mukacheve Mukačevo Mukachyovo Muncaci Nagyszőlős Vynohradiv Veľká Sevľuš Vinogradov Seleușu Mare Ungvár Uzhhorod Užhorod Uzhgorod Ujhorod Várpalánka Palanok (now part of Mukacheve) Championship (1st division) 1944/45 16.Ungvári AC 3 0 0 3 3-13 0 NB: the 1944/45 season was abandoned after a few rounds and replaced by an (unofficial) Budapest competition in the fall of 1944.\n\nItaly\n\nGreece\n\nGreek clubs in the Italian football structure\n\nItaly occupied a number of islands in the Aegean Sea during the Italo-Turkish War of 1912 (in which it also took possession of regions now in Libya). Usually summarised as the Dodecanese (\"Dodekánisa\") in spite of consisting of more than twelve larger islands, these remained under Italian rule during the interbellum before being ceded to Greece in 1947.\n\nThe largest and by far most populated of these islands is Rhodes (Ródos), where a first football club, Diagóras, had been founded in 1905, when the islands were still part of the Ottoman Empire. Diagóras was dissolved by the fascist authorities in 1929 (and not reconstituted until after the end of World War II) but a local league was formally part of the fourth level of the Italian league structure for at least two seasons: in 1935/36, when the league was won by SG Speranza based in Cremasco di Rodi (now known as Kremasti), and in 1936/37, when FERT (Fortitudo Eius Rodum Tenuit) from the town of Ródos itself won the league; another participant was Polisportiva Marechiaro. Later winners were GS Metropoli Rodi (1938/39) and Acadia Rodi (1939/40).\n\nOn the island of Kos, the second most important of the group, a football club called Meropís was established in 1924 by a local priest and an Italian military commander. It was renamed Antagóras in 1952.\n\nThere is no information on football activities on any of the other islands during this period. Note that the original name of the group referred to twelve islands enjoying a priviliged fiscal status within the Ottoman Empire: Astypálaia, Chálki, Ikaría, Kálymnos, Kárpathos, Kásos, Kastellórizo, Léros, Nísyros, Pátmos, Sými and Tílos; Kos and Rhodes, the two main islands in the region, were not included. During the Italian intermezzo, Ikaría was part of Greece while Kastellórizo (also known as Megísti) was controlled by France until 1921 (when the French handed it to Italy). Therefore, Kos and Rhodes were \"added\" to the group to complete the dozen. Later, the Italians renamed the territory they occupied Rodi e Dodecaneso, separating Rhodes from the other islands and adding Leipsoí in twelfth place. To confuse the issue further, nowadays Ikaría (which never was Italian) is usually not considered part of the group, but Agathonísi is.\n\nBulgaria\n\nGreece | Macedonia\n\nAfter entering World War II at the side of the axis, Bulgaria occupied parts of northern Greece and southern Yugoslavia. No league championship was organised in Bulgaria during the war, but several clubs from the occupied areas reached the latter stages of the knock-out style national championship or of the Tzar's Cup.\n\nGreek clubs in the Bulgarian football structure 1941-1943\n\nChampionship (knock-out style) 1943: 2nd round: Belomorets Kavala (2-1, 0-1, 1-2 vs Botev Plovdiv) NB: is is unknown whether this club (whose name translates to 'White Sea', referring to the Aegean) is related to the Kavala clubs (in particular AÉ Kaválas and Fílippoi Kaválas, which together with Iraklís Kavála merged into AÓ Kaválas in 1965) playing in the northern section of the Greek championship prior to 1940.\n\nMacedonian clubs in the Bulgarian football structure 1941-1943\n\nAll clubs below are from towns in the current state of (North) Macedonia, an area on which Bulgaria historically laid claims. Note that Macedonia also is the name for a large part of Northern Greece. Makedonija Skopje once reached the championship final and also the semifinal of the Tzar's Cup; they are one of the ancestors of current Vardar Skopje.\n\nChampionship (knock-out style) 1941: 1/6 final: Makedonija Skopje (2-1, 0-3 awarded vs Sportklub Plovdiv) 1942: finalists: Makedonija Skopje (0-2, 0-1 vs Levski Sofia) 1/6 final: Makedonija Bitola (0-1 vs Slavia Sofia) 1/6 final: ŽSK Skopje (0-3 vs ŽSK Sofia) 1/12 fin.: Vardar Skopje (1-4 vs Makedonija Bitola) 1/12 fin.: Goce Delcev Prilep (0-8 vs ŽSK Skopje) 1943: 2nd round: ŽSK Skopje (1-3, 1-2 vs Levski Plovdiv) 1st round: Makedonija Bitola (0-1, 0-2 vs ŽSK Skopje) Tzar's Cup 1941: semifinal: Makedonija Skopje (0-1 vs Napreduk Ruse) 1942: quarterf.: Makedonija Bitola (0-3 vs SK Plovdiv) 1st round: ŽSK Skopje (1-2 vs Makedonija Bitola) NB: Goce Delcev were founded 1941 and renamed Pobeda Prilep in 1950; as such they won the 2003/04 and 2006/07 Macedonian championships and the 2001/02 Macedonian cup, also losing the cup finals of 1999/00 and 2006/07; Makedonija Bitola are apparently not related to current Pelister; Makedonija Skopje merged 1947 with Pobeda Skopje into Vardar Skopje (see the section on Macedonian clubs in Yugoslavia); therefore, neither the Makedonija Skopje nor the Vardar Skopje teams above are related to the current clubs of those names, but the war-time Makedonija Skopje is part of the genealogical tree of current Vardar; it is unknown whether the railway club ŽSK (Željezničarski SK) Skopje is related to any current club.\n\nCroatia\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina | Serbia\n\nDuring the second World War, Germany, Hungary and Italy dismembered Yugoslavia, and created the 'independent' vassal state of Croatia, which also comprised current Bosnia-Herzegovina and some parts of current Serbia. During the war, football competitions were organised in this state, leading to the participation of many clubs based in Bosnia-Herzegovina and some from Zemun and Subotica. These are summarised below. See also the section on Yugoslavia.\n\nBosnian and Herzegovinan clubs in the Croatian football structure\n\nThe seasons 1940/41 and 1941 were played in a league format; the 1941 season was abandoned at the half-way stage. All later seasons had regional or city leagues from which clubs emerged to a knock-out tournament for the title (the 1943 season had a 4-team league as final stage). The most successful club from current Bosnia and Herzegovina was SAŠK Sarajevo, who reached the Croatian championship final in 1942.\n\nAmong the clubs listed here, SAŠK Sarajevo had previously played in the Yugoslav championship; they seem to have been dissolved after the war. Zrinjski Mostar won seven championships (and one cup) in Bosnia-Herzegovina since 2004/05, but it is unknown if and how this club are related to that of 1941. None of the mentioned clubs from Banja Luka appear to be related to either Borac Banja Luka or Krajišnik (dissolved 1945) who played in the Yugoslav championship. Likewise, Đerdelez Sarajevo appear unrelated to any later Sarajevo club that featured in Yugoslavia or independent Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Tomislav Zenica are not identical to Čelik Zenica.\n\nSAŠK Sarajevo 1940/41 7.SAŠK Sarajevo 18 5 3 10 17-44 13 1941 9.SAŠK Sarajevo 8 0 0 8 0-30 0 NB: season abandoned 1942: semifinal: SAŠK Sarajevo (1-2, 1-9 vs Concordia Zagreb) 1943: quarterf.: SAŠK Sarajevo (0-0, 0-3awd vs Concordia Zagreb) 1944: finalists: SAŠK Sarajevo (final vs HAŠK Zagreb not played) Zrinjski Mostar 1941 4.Zrinjski Mostar 8 4 1 3 16-19 9 NB: season abandoned Incomplete lists of Bosnian and Herzegovinan participants at group stage who did not reach the knock-out stage (unlike SAŠK Sarajevo): 1942: Zrinjski Mostar, Hrvoje Banja Luka, HBSK Banja Luka, Đerdelez Sarajevo 1943: Hrvoje Banja Luka, HBSK Banja Luka, Đerdelez Sarajevo, Tomislav Zenica 1944: HBSK Banja Luka, Zvonimir Banja Luka, Hrvoje Banja Luka, Hajduk Sarajevo, Đerdelez Sarajevo, Tomislav Zenica\n\nSerbian clubs in the Croatian football structure\n\nBačka Subotica (founded 1901 under the Hungarian name of Bacska Szabadkai Athletikai Club) were dissolved in 1945, after playing at the third league level in Hungary since 1941. In 1950, a new club called Bačka Subotica was formed out of a merger between a number of local clubs. Neither version of the club has won any honours in Serbia (or Yugoslavia). Nothing is known about the fate of the Zemun clubs after World War II (they did not play a significant role in Yugoslavia before the war, though a club called Sparta Zemun played in the 1938/39 league); presumably they were all dissolved. Naša krila Zemun (dissolved 1950) and Galenika/FK Zemun are not related.\n\nBačka Subotica 1940/41 10.Bačka Subotica 18 2 3 13 19-58 7 Victoria Zemun 1941 8.Victoria Zemun 8 2 1 5 12-33 5 1943: quarterf.: HSK Zemun (0-4, 2-1 vs HAŠK Zagreb) 1944: 2nd round: Građanski Zemun (0-2, 0-3awd vs Borovo) Incomplete lists of Serbian participants at group stage who did not reach the knock-out stage: 1942: Građanski Zemun, Victoria Zemun 1944: Dunav Zemun, Građanski Zemun, Liet Zemun, Hajduk Zemun\n\nAlbania\n\nKosovo\n\nDuring World War II, Italian troups occupied Albania and parts of Yugoslavia, including Kosovo. (The occupation started slightly before the war, in April 1939.) The Albanian FA organised three unofficial championships during this time (in 1939, 1940 and 1942); in the last of the three, three clubs from Kosovo entered.\n\nKosovar clubs in the Albanian football structure\n\nThe 1942 unofficial championship was organised in three regional zones; the three Kosovar participants (Peja, Prishtina and Prizreni, from the towns of Pejë, Prishtinë and Prizren respectively) played in the Zona e Veriut (northern zone) along with Shkodra from Shkodër. Prizreni won the zone (played as a single round robin) and qualified for the national semifinals along with runners-up Shkodra. They held favourites Tirana to a draw (after extra time) in their semifinal on June 26, 1942, but lost the replay the next day. Shkodra, the 1940 champions who had sensationally lost 1-3 away to Prizreni in the zonal stage, had meanwhile beaten Berati (from Berat, the winners of the southern zone) and played the final against Tirana on June 29; they drew 1-1 but refused to play extra time, and therefore Tirana were declared champions. Note that the teams were all denoted in the press by their town names, though they were commonly understood to be the leading club team (SK Tirana, Vllaznia Shkodër, Tomori Berat etcetera) from each town.\n\n(unofficial war-time) Championship Prizreni 1942 1.Prizreni 3 3 0 0 10- 2 6 [northern zone] 1942: semifinal: Prizreni (2-2 aet, 1-2 vs Tirana) Peja 1942 3.Peja 3 0 1 2 3- 5 1 [northern zone] Prishtina 1942 4.Prishtina 3 0 1 2 2- 9 1 [northern zone]\n\nJapan\n\nRussia | South Korea\n\nRussian clubs in the Japanese football structure 1905-1945\n\nJapan occupied the southern part of the Sakhalin island (known as Karafuto in Japanese) between 1905 and 1945; between 1918 and 1925 Japan also occupied the more northern region around Alexandrovsk-Sakhalinsky (Akō in Japanese), and it held all Kuril Islands (Chishima Islands) from Kunashir (main city Yuzhno-Kurilsk, Furukamappu in Japanese) to Paramushir (main city Severo-Kurilsk, Kashiwabara in Japanese) from 1875 to 1945 (Japan still claims the four southernmost Kuril islands, including Kunashir, but all are currently under Russian control). However, only on southern Sakhalin some minimal information on football activities during Japanese occupation is available. In 1921, first regional competitions in the southern part of Sakhalin were organised, in which teams from the cities of Toyohara (now Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk), Ōtomari (now Korsakov), Ochiai (now Dolinsk) and Maoka (now Kholmsk) participated, initiated by a publishing company. Starting from 1924 also youth competitions were organised. No data on winners are available.\n\nCurrently, Sakhalin has a regional championship at the fifth level of the Russian league pyramid, in which clubs from the above four cities as well as from southern Sakhalin cities such as Aniva (Rūtaka in Japanese), Makarov (Shirutoru in Japanese), Nevelsk (Honto in Japanese), Poronaysk (Shikuka in Japanese), Shakhtersk (Tōro in Japanese), Tomari (Tomarioru in Japanese) and Uglegorsk (Esutoru in Japanese) may enter.\n\nIn the 1992 and 1993 seasons, the region had a club playing at the second Russian level in Sakhalin Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, who played in the eastern zone (one of three regional divisions), and finished 13rd (out of 16) in 1992 and 10th (out of 16) in 1993 (a season in which they had relocated to Kholmsk). As a nationwide second division (Pervaya Liga) was established for the 1994 season, only the top-5 remained at the second level and Sakhalin missed out. After nearly two decades, Sakhalin Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk returned to the second level for the 2014/15 season only to suffer immediate relegation again.\n\nSouth Korean clubs in the Japanese football structure 1935-1936\n\nJapan occupied large parts on the Asian continent (in particular Manchuria and Korea) and many Pacific islands prior to and during World War II. Two Korean clubs reached the final of the main Japanese football competition, the Emperor's Cup, during Japanese occupation (1910-1945), one (Seoul Shukyu-dan – known as Kyungsung FC in Korea) winning it. Note that in this period Seoul was known as Keijō, Japanese being the official language, and the corresponding characters were pronounced Kyungsung (modern transcription Gyeongseong) in Korean. The 1935 Emperor's Cup winners from Seoul are not to be confused with the team from the Tokyo-based Keiō University which dominated Japanese football in the 1930s, winning 5 Emperor's Cups that decade, including the 1936 final against Poseung College, also from Seoul. Seoul Shukyu-dan also won two editions of the football tournament of the All Joseon Cup in Korea (in 1936, as Kyungsung FC, and in 1937 as Soeul FC); likewise Poseung College won that tournament once, in 1929.\n\nIn addition, Kyungsung FC or Seoul Shukyu-dan won the football tournament of the Meiji Shrine Games (an Japanese omnisports event held 14 times between 1924 and 1943) in 1935 by beating Keiō University BRB 2-1 in the final; in both 1939 and 1940 the Korean province selection of Ham Keung (now spelled Hamgy(e)ong) won the same tournament.\n\nEmperor's Cup 1935: winners: Seoul Shukyu-dan (2-0 vs Tokyo Bunri Daigaku) 1936: finalists: Poseung College (2-3 vs Keiō Gijuku Daigaku BRB) NB: Poseung College (also spelled Posung College or Bosung College) currently called Korea University and based in Seoul\n\nSouth Africa\n\nSee the section on splits and unifications for a discussion of the four bantustans who were nominally independent from South Africa during the last decade and a half of the apartheid regime.\n\nNamibian clubs in the South African football structure\n\nAfter World War I, the former German colony of Südwestafrika became a League of Nations mandate area entrusted to South Africa. After World War II, South Africa annexed the country, without international recognition. After a struggle of decades, the area gained independence as Namibia in 1990, a few years before the end of the apartheid regime in South Africa. During South African rule, various clubs from the region reached the national second division (in the all-white NFL), though never the top flight. In 1966, the first season in which the South West African league structure was integrated into the NFL, South West African champions SK Windhoek entered both the Castle Cup (in which they were eliminated 1-2 by Corinthians) and the promotion playoffs to the top level, but lost 0-9 to, again, Corinthians (who were promoted). After the 1974 season, Windhoek City merged with SK Windhoek into Sportklub Windhoek City; the merger club continued playing in the second division until the NFL was dissolved in 1977. Only a few second division league finishes of Windhoek clubs are known, see below. After 1966, Namibian clubs also entered the NFL Castle Cup, the main cup tournament at the time, usually to be eliminated in the first round (1/16 finals). Much earlier, Ramblers of Windhoek once won the Union Cup, played in the 1920s and organised by the South African Union of Sport (Unie Sport).\n\nOn at least two occasions, in 1977 and 1983, Namibia entered the South African Currie Cup for provincial selections; in 1977, they defeated Eastern Free State and drew with Western Transvaal.\n\nSouth West Africa also entered the amateur championship (Impala Cup) of South Africa, which was run on an inter-provincial basis, and won it in 1985, beating Northern Cape 2-0 in the final replay in Windhoek.\n\nThe city of Walvis Bay (founded as Walvisbaai between 1720 and 1725, and known as Walfischbucht in German) was part of the South African Cape Province between 1910 and 1911 and again between 1971 and 1977, when the area came under direct rule by the South African government. It was returned to independent Namibia in 1994, after the end of apartheid. A local club, Sparta United, entered the early rounds of the Castle Cup on various occasions.\n\nNFL - National Division II 1969 9.Windhoek Ramblers 18 5 1 12 19-70 11 1974 8.Windhoek City 24 9 5 10 44-46 23 NFL - Castle Cup 1966: 1/16 fin.: SK Windhoek (1-2 vs Corinthians) 1967: 1/16 fin.: Windhoek Ramblers (1-6 vs Berea Park) 1971: 1/16 fin.: Windhoek City (0-6 vs Durban City) 1972: 1/16 fin.: Windhoek City (0-3 vs Parthenon) 1973: 1/16 fin.: Windhoek City (1-1, 1-3 vs Germiston Callies) 1974: 1/16 fin.: Windhoek City (0-2 vs Germiston Callies) 1975: 1/16 fin.: SK Windhoek City (1-3 vs Berea Park) 1976: 1/16 fin.: SK Windhoek City (0-1 vs Hillbrow) 1977: 1/16 fin.: Sparta United (0-9 vs Troyeville) 1/16 fin.: Windhoek Ramblers (0-12 vs Lusitano)\n\nMorocco\n\nIfni | Western Sahara\n\nLike Ceuta and Melilla, which are still Spanish territories, Ifni (now in southwestern Morocco) was a coastal Spanish exclave during colonial times, and, unlike Tetuán, remained Spanish when Morocco gained independence. Between 1946 and 1958 it was ruled together with Western Sahara before becoming an overseas Spanish province on its own after a Moroccan invasion attempt. In 1969, following international pressure, Spain relinquished the area to Morocco.\n\nMorocco occupied Western Sahara shortly after Spain released the area into independence. Two clubs from the main city Laâyoune (El Ayoun) have played in the top division, though without much tangible success; however, JS de la Massira reached the semifinals of the national cup competition, the Coupe du Trône, on 4 separate occasions.\n\nIfni clubs in the Moroccan football structure\n\nWhen Ifni was relinquished to Morocco in 1969, 4 local football clubs existed: Balompédica CF, CD Africa, Atlético Español de Fútbol and CD Ifni. All were based in the capital town Sidi Ifni. It is unknown how these clubs performed within the Spanish football structure or whether regional championships were organised.\n\nTihad Sidi Ifni played at the third level in Morocco for several seasons (certainly between 2005 and 2008) and may have played at the second level previously, but never at the first. As Tihad is short for Ittihad, meaning Union, they may have been created as a merger of the old 'Spanish' clubs.\n\nWestern Saharan clubs in the Moroccan football structure\n\nCSE Laâyoune were the first club from the area to be promoted to the Moroccan top level league, in 1984, but they only lasted three seasons there (and the third only because of an extension of the top flight to 24 clubs, distributed over 2 groups).\n\nChampionship 1984/85 ?.CSE Laâyoune 1985/86 19.CSE Laâyoune 38 6 11 21 20-48 61 1986/87 11.CSE Laâyoune 22 2 6 14 28-49 32 [group A]\n\nIn 1995, the Auxiliary Forces team, based in Ben Slimane, who had finished ninth in the 1994/95 league championship, were moved to Laâyoune and renamed Jeunesse Sportive de la Massira; Massira is the name for the \"Green March\", staged on November 6, 1975 by about 300,000 (unarmed) Moroccans occupying areas of the former Spanish colony of Western Sahara rich in natural resources. The club occasionally managed a finish in the top half of the table but were relegated in 2012. They have enjoyed more (relative) success in the Coupe du Trône, having reached (and being eliminated at) the semifinal stage on 4 occasions.\n\nChampionship 1995/96 10.JS de la Massira 30 9 13 8 31-30 40 1996/97 4.JS de la Massira 30 14 9 7 43-30 51 1997/98 12.JS de la Massira 30 9 8 13 26-36 35 1998/99 9.JS de la Massira 30 10 6 14 26-43 36 1999/00 13.JS de la Massira 30 4 15 11 19-34 27 2000/01 14.JS de la Massira 30 6 12 12 27-33 30 2001/02 9.JS de la Massira 30 8 11 11 32-45 35 2002/03 8.JS de la Massira 30 7 13 10 25-32 34 2003/04 11.JS de la Massira 30 7 14 9 20-25 35 2004/05 5.JS de la Massira 30 9 12 9 26-25 39 2005/06 13.JS de la Massira 30 5 17 8 23-26 32 2006/07 8.JS de la Massira 30 8 13 9 21-21 37 2007/08 9.JS de la Massira 30 8 14 8 27-28 38 2008/09 12.JS de la Massira 30 8 10 12 31-41 34 2009/10 13.JS de la Massira 30 8 10 12 26-33 34 2010/11 11.JS de la Massira 30 8 10 12 24-35 34 2011/12 15.JS de la Massira 30 7 7 16 24-42 28 Cup 1997: semifinal: JS de la Massira (2-3 vs WAC Casablanca) 2000: 1/8 final: JS de la Massira (1-1 aet, 2-4 pen vs KAC Kénitra) 2001: semifinal: JS de la Massira (1-4 vs MAS Fès) 2002: 1/8 final: JS de la Massira (0-1 vs KAC Marrakech) 2003: quarterf.: JS de la Massira (2-3 aet vs Raja Casablanca) 2004: semifinal: JS de la Massira (0-1 vs FAR Rabat) 2005: semifinal: JS de la Massira (0-1 vs OC Khouribga) 2009: 1/8 final: JS de la Massira (0-0 aet, 4-5 pen vs OC Khouribga) 2011: 1/8 final: JS de la Massira (1-4 vs WAC Casablanca) 2016: 1/8 final: JS de la Massira (1-1, 0-0 vs RS Berkane)\n\nEthiopia\n\nEritrea became an autonomous state within Ethiopia in 1952, and remained so until 1962 when Addis Abeba revoked the autonomy and factually annexed the country, its only access to the Red Sea. After a lenghty war, Eritrea were granted independence in 1993.\n\nThe first season in which Eritrean clubs entered the Ethiopian football structure was 1953; it is not known for how long they continued to participate actively, but until the mid seventies they did so with considerably success, in particular in the late fifties and early seventies in the league, and in the eighties in the cup.\n\nEritrean clubs in the Ethiopian football structure\n\nWe only list Eritrean clubs winning the national championship or cup, as only limited data are available. Among the clubs listed, Red Sea (also known as Key Baher) won the championship of independent Eritrea 6 times since 1995. None of the others appear to have 'survived' independence; in any case none are mentioned in the (sparse) available data on football in independent Eritrea. Akale Guzay (1958 Ethiopian champions) was the former name of Embassoyra (1974 champions), and GS Asmara (1972 and 1973 champions of Ethiopia) were known as Hamassien (champions 1955 and 1957) before. As far as is known, all clubs mentioned are or were based in the Eritrean capital Asmara.\n\nNote that Hamassien/Asmara, Akale Guzay/Embassoyra and Tele SC all played in the 1946/47 Eritrean championship under Italian rule. Hamassien won the 1949 Coppa Torino in the colonial era. A club called Mar Rosso also existed at the time, and played for one season (apparently 1947/48) in the Eritrean championship under Italian rule, but finished last and were relegated; they reportedly were dissolved later and are therefore not directly related to the aforementioned Red Sea, Ethiopian cup winners of 1981 and 1983.\n\nWhen Ethiopia won the African Nations Cup at home in 1962, their team was dominated by players from Eritrea, including the brothers Luciano and Italo Vassalo, of mixed Italian-Eritrean parentage; to this day, Luciano remains the second highest goal scorer at African Nations Cup final tournaments for Ethiopia, with six goals between 1962 and 1968. As in the case of the 1976 European Championship of Czechoslovakia, won by a predominantly Slovak side, it is in fact unfair to credit this title to the nominal successor federation (it is the only African Nations Cup title Ethiopia ever won).\n\nChampionship 1948 1.Red Sea 1955 1.Hamassien 1957 1.Hamassien 1958 1.Akale Guzay 1959 1.Tele SC 1969 1.Tele SC 1970 1.Tele SC 1972 1.GS Asmara 1973 1.GS Asmara 1974 1.Embassoyra NB: in 1953, Hamassien lost the championship final 3-4 to Army (from Addis Abeba).

Prior to this, there were National Games (7 editions between 1910 and 1948, held on 10 occasions since) and Inter-Sectional Football Championships (7 editions between 1926 and 1933) but the island of Taiwan was never involved in any of those. Hongkong did participate in various National Games, as did selections of Chinese from Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand; see the section on border moves.\n\nTibetan teams in the Chinese football structure\n\nTibet, which had been de facto independent from 1913 to 1950, was annexed by China in 1951. Nothing is known about football in the region prior to the annexation. In recent years, two 'Tibet' club teams played at the third level of the Chinese league structure. In 2003, Beijing-based Tibet Xuequan did so; in 2004 Tibet Huitong Luhua, based in Baoding (Hebei province) entered. This club moved to Beijing for 2005, and reached the promotion playoffs. After their quarterfinal exit, the club bought the franchise of second level Dalian Changbo, relocated to Taiyuan (after first intending to play in Heilongjiang province – the completely opposite side of China seen from Tibet) and renamed it Shanxi Luhu. Before the 2007 season, the club was renamed Hohhot and relocated to the city of that name, the capital of Inner Mongolia. None of the cities mentioned is remotely close to Tibet – Taiyuan is about 2000 kilometres from Lhasa, as the bird flies, and the others are (much) further away. So the relationship of these two clubs with Tibet is probably comparable to that of Montevideo-based clubs Bristol, Dublin and Liverpool (all once top level clubs in Uruguay) with the corresponding cities in Britain and Ireland.\n\nMuch earlier, in 1965, a Tibet 'representative' team finished 5th (from 15) in one of the four Division Two groups, missing out on the second level championship playoffs. In the seventies, the Chinese football championship involved up to 45 teams, mostly provincial selections, army units or youth sides. Tibet participated on various occasions. These tournaments were played in four first stage groups, with the best teams playing off for the title and the others for the lower placings. In 1974, Tibet withdrew from the playoffs for 25th to 45th place which they were to enter; in 1976, the second stage was not played because of the upheavals following the death of Mao. In 1978, a 16-team top flight was installed, and Tibet entered Division 2, finishing 20th from 22. In 1979, they dropped 2 places and finished bottom of Division 2. Since then, no Tibet representation or club team has played above the third level, with the exception of the 1986 season when the second division had 33 teams and Tibet finished 5th in their 9-team first round group.\n\nChampionship Tibet (4 top level seasons) 1973 32.Tibet 17 1 0 16 9-53 2 [aggregate record] 1974 -.Tibet 9 0 0 9 5-29 0 [first stage] 1976 -.Tibet 9 1 4 4 9-17 6 [first stage] 1977 38.Tibet 15 1 5 9 18-33 7 [aggregate record] NB: no championship organised in 1975.\n\nIndia\n\nGoa | Sikkim\n\nSince obtaining independence from Britian, India's borders underwent several changes. The most spectacular was the separation from Pakistan (later split into Pakistan and Bangladesh; with Pakistan there is a long standing conflict on the Jammu and Kashmir region – teams from the part currently controlled by India occasionally enter Indian tournaments, but it is not known whether there ever were football competitions covering the entire region). There were also several additions: India annexed 'French India' (Karikal, Yanaon and Mahé) in 1956 and the Portuguese colonies of Goa, Diu and Damão in 1962, as well as Sikkim through a referendum in 1975.\n\nGoan teams in the Indian football structure\n\nFootball was reportedly introduced to Goa in 1883, but before Goa came to India in 1962, an official league had been going on for just a decade. The ten league championships played out between 1951/52 and 1960/61 were shared by CD Vasco da Gama (3 titles), AD Velha Goa (2 titles), CD Chinchinim, Independente de Margao, GD Polícia, CD Salgaocar and Sporting Clube de Goa (all 1 title); among those 7 clubs, Salgaocar (renamed Salgaocar SC) won 17 Goan leagues between 1962/63 and 2008, Vasco da Gama (renamed Vasco SC) 3 and Sporting Clube de Goa 1 (in 2006 – their first championship since 1952/53).\n\nMoreover, Goan clubs have played a dominant role since the introduction of a national football league in India in the 1996/97 season, seriously challenging Calcutta's long-time undisputed standing as the strongest football region in the country. Goan clubs claimed 9 (Salgaocar in 1998/99 and 2010/11, Dempo in 2004/05, 2006/07, 2007/08, 2009/10 and 2011/12 and Churchill Brothers in 2008/09 and 2012/13) of the 24 championships disputed up to and including the 2019/20 season, one more than Calcutta (nowadays officially called Kolkata – 5 for Mohun Bagan and 3 for their eternal rivals East Bengal), and showed much greater strength in depth: among the league runners-up, 8 were from Goa, which also accounted for 10 of the teams finishing third.\n\nGoa's strength in depth was particularly clear in the first few years after the turn of the millennium: in 2002/03 the tiny state, accounting for little more than 0.1 percent of the country's surface and population, provided 4 of the 12 league clubs (Calcutta 3) and all finished in the top-6; in 2003/04 Goa fielded 5 of the 12 top flight outfits (Calcutta 4) and all finished in the top-8; and in 2004/05 the former Portuguese colony accounted for half (6 out of 12) of the top division participants (Calcutta just 3), claiming the top two positions as well. Although all 6 Goan clubs finished in the top-10, a reduction of the league (from 12 to 10 participants) meant 2 Goan clubs were relegated, and as another 2 went down in 2005/06 (while Churchill Brothers went the opposite direction), 2006/07 had 'just' 3 Goan participants among the 10 top flight teams – equal to Calcutta's share. In fact, in each and every league season up to and including 2015/16 (when Goan participation had dropped to 2 clubs out of 9), Goa had the highest number of teams participating (sometimes equalled, but never bested, by Calcutta and/or Mumbai). In 2016/17, three Goan clubs (SC Goa, Salgaocar and promoted side Dempo) had qualified for the league, but they all withdrew out of displeasure with the roadmap for Indian football for the 2017/18 season; instead, Churchill Brothers were invited by the AIFF to enter the league, as the only Goan participants in the 2016/17 season.\n\nNote that the seasons 1996/97 and 1998/99 were played over two stages, with a 2-group first stage from which 8 clubs qualified for the championship playoff.\n\nGoa has also been represented in every season of the Indian Super League set up in 2014, with FC Goa reaching two finals and five semifinals in the ten seasons contested so far.\n\nChampionship Churchill Brothers SC (23 top level seasons) 1996/97 2.Churchill Brothers SC 19 10 6 3 27-16 36 [aggregate

until then independent Himalaya kingdom of Sikkim, bordering to its west on Nepal, to its north on China (more precisely, Tibet) and to its east on Bhutan, entered India as its 22nd state following a referendum in 1975 (after an earlier rejection by popular vote in 1947; after that, Sikkim had obtained a special 'protectorate' status). China did not recognise this move until 2003; in return India then recognised China's possession of Tibet. The capital of the state is Gangtok, also its largest town.\n\nCurrently the most important football tournament in the region is the invitational Sikkim Governor's Gold Cup, which draws participants from India, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal; the 2006 edition even included a team from Nigeria. Its inaugural edition in 1979 was won by local side GMC from Gangtok; since then, no local team has reached the final.\n\nPrior to 1975, the dominant teams in Sikkim had been Sikkim Guards and Kumar Sporting Club (which already won an unspecified tournament outside of Sikkim in 1948); in the early seventies, they were joined by 1/3rd Gorkha Rifles, an army team which had been moved to Sikkim. No information is available on domestic competitions in Sikkim in this era. Sikkim representative teams played in tournaments outside the area (e.g. in Darjeeling) as well, but also here details are lacking. The current Sikkim FA was formed in 1976; its predecessor was the Gangtok Football and Sporting Association.\n\nSince the inclusion of the state in India, Sikkim are irregular and unsuccessful entrants in the Santosh Trophy, a competition for state selections. This is (usually) played over two group stages followed by semifinals and final. In their best ever performance, in 2004, Sikkim reached the quarterfinal group stage (involving 12 teams divided in 4 groups of 3) after beating both Orissa and Pondicherry 4-3; they then lost both second stage matches heavily (1-5 to Manipur and 1-6 to Karnataka).\n\nIn the league pyramid, Sikkim club teams occasionally entered the second level (played in various regional groups followed by a final national stage in which promotion can be earned). United Sikkim FC were the first team from the region to reach the final stage, in 2010/11, and earned promotion to the top level I-League in 2011/12 only to be relegated again next season, finishing last. However, Sikkim's main claim to fame in football terms remains the fact that Baichung Bhutia, the best Indian player in the beginning of the 21st century, was born there; he is co-owner of United Sikkim and played for 20 minutes as a substitute in the match in which the club clinched promotion.\n\nChampionship United Sikkim FC (Gangtok) (1 top level season) 2012/13 14.United Sikkim 26 2 9 15 23-63 15 Championship (Division 2) Boys Athletic Club (Gangtok) 2001/02 5.Boys Athletic Club 3 0 0 3 1- 7 0 [group II] NB: result of last group match (presumably lost) unknown Denzong Boyz FC (Gangtok) 2009/10 7.Denzong Boyz 6 0 1 5 2-14 1 [group C] 2010/11 7.Denzong Boyz 6 0 2 4 8-21 2 [group B] United Sikkim FC (Gangtok) 2010/11 1.United Sikkim 6 4 1 1 15- 7 13 [group A] 5.United Sikkim 7 2 4 1 9- 9 10 [final stage] 2011/12 1.United Sikkim 6 4 1 1 18- 7 13 [group C] 1.United Sikkim 12 6 4 2 22-17 22 [final stage] 2013/14 4.United Sikkim 8 2 1 5 9-12 7 [final stage] Cup (Santosh Trophy) Sikkim (best ever performance only) 2004 -.Sikkim 4 2 0 2 10-14 6 [aggregate record]\n\nIndonesia\n\nEast Timor | Western New Guinea\n\nEast Timor clubs in the Indonesian football structure\n\nIndonesian invaded the former Portuguese colony East Timor in 1975, when Portugal had granted the area independence, and occupied it until 1999, the western world being rather more lenient with Soeharto than with Saddam Hussein when he invaded Kuwait under comparable pretexts a decade and a half later. On at least one occasion, a club from the capital Dili, Persedil, played at the second level (Divisi Satu) of the amateur championship, Perserikatan, in 1983, missing out on qualification for the quarterfinal stage (8 Besar) in their last group match in which they lost 1-3 to Persisam (Samarinda), when a draw would have been sufficient for qualification. They had earlier lost 1-4 to Persib (Bandung), who would eventually win promotion to the top level (Divisi Utama) together with three other clubs, and beaten PSSA (Asahan) 4-3. Another Dili club, called Summa FC, representing Bank Summa, then a major private bank in Indonesia, played two matches in Sleman (near Yogyakarta, central Java) against local side PSK Kalasan (to whom they lost 1-2) and Surabaya amateur team Suryanaga (who beat them 4-1) as part of the national stage of another amateur tournament in 1991/92, but the status of that competition is not clear.\n\nPerserikatan - Divisi Satu - Grup B 1983 3.Persedil (Dili) 3 1 0 2 6-10 2\n\nWestern New Guinean clubs in the Indonesian football structure\n\nWhen the Dutch East Indies became independent as Indonesia in 1949, the Netherlands kept the western part of New Guinea, which remained a Dutch colony until 1962. It was to obtain full independence by 1971, but following Indonesian mobilisation and pressure from the US administration under Kennedy, the Netherlands handed over the territory to UN administration in October 1962, which in turn handed the area to Indonesia in May 1963. A plebiscite was organised in 1969, which resulted in a 100% vote for continued Indonesian rule over the area (called Irian Jaya between 1973 and 2002, when it was renamed Papua), while the eastern half of the island (ruled by Australia at the time) is now independent as Papua New Guinea.\n\nDuring Dutch rule, football was only played at local level, in particular in and around the capital Hollandia, founded in 1910 and currently (since the centenary celebrations in 2010) officially called Port Numbay after temporary name changes to Sukarnopura (1963-1968) and Jayapura (1968-2010; this name is still widely used).\n\nHollandia was home to two football associations, both organising their own competitions, namely the V.H.O. (Voetbalbond Hollandia en Omstreken, founded in 1950), which initially was restricted to Europeans and their descendants, and the V.B.H. (Voetbal Bond Hollandia, founded in 1949), in which the local population had a place (in later years, Papua's also gained access to the V.H.O.). Occasionally matches between selections from Hollandia and Biak were organised. The V.H.O. league was won by W.I.K. in five consecutive seasons from 1956 to 1960 (no data are available on earlier seasons) and by E.D.O, founded in April 1950 and reportedly the oldest club in Hollandia, in 1961, while the V.B.H. champions were Ajapo in 1959 and S.V.C. in 1960.\n\nAt the end of the 1959 season, a playoff between the top-3 of both leagues was organised for the first time, with P.O.M.S. winning in 1959/60 and Spoetnik and H.V.C. sharing first place in 1961/62 (the 1960/61 edition was abandoned after one match due to internal problems in the V.B.H.).\n\nIn 1962, the two federations merged to organise a unified league, the E.D.H. (Ere Divisie Hollandia), but no data on that are available after September 1962.\n\nIn July 1959, the Voetbalbond Merauke started a qualifying competition between 14 clubs to decide 7 entrants in the inaugural eerste klasse. No further data are available. In addition, a federation existed in Fakfak (Voetbalbond Fakfak); as early as January 19th, 1935, a local club named Fakfak had played a team from Flores, a visiting ship, winning 4-1. However, no further details are known. In May 1936, the Doreh-voetbalclub was founded in Manokwari, then the centre of football activities on Dutch New Guinea, where 6 clubs played in the 1937/38 league organised by the local football federation, won by Leeuwenhart.\n\nIt is unknown whether any of the above clubs survived since the area became Indonesian; the current top club from the island, Persipura from Jayapura (colours: white-black), which claims foundation in 1950, are the product of the 1962 merger between the V.H.O. and the V.B.H.\n\nPersipura won the 2005 Indonesian championship, beating hosts Persija 3-2 after extra time in the final in Jakarta. Persipura also lost three consecutive Indonesian cup finals (for the Copa Dji Sam Soe): in 2006 to Arema from Malang, and in both 2007 and 2008/09 to Sriwijaya FC from Palembang. They claimed their second national title in Indonesia in 2008/09, their third in 2010/11 and their fourth in 2013 and their fifth (a record) in the newly established Torabika Soccer Championship in 2016; in 2014 they finished runners-up to Persib from Bandung. They also were runners-up in the amateur championship of 1980, losing the final 1-3 to Persiraja from Banda Aceh (capital of Aceh in Northern Sumatra) and won the last ever second level (Divisi Satu) championship of the Perserikatan in 1993 (the amateur and semiprofessional league structures merged in 1994), a championship they had won before in 1979.\n\nOther clubs from the area playing a role at the higher levels of the Indonesian league structure are Persiwa from Wamena (supposedly founded in 1925, which presumably refers to the foundation of a local federation under Dutch rule; they played at top level between 2006 and 2013, during which period they once finished runners-up (in 2008/09, behind Persipura) and once finished third (in 2012, behind Sriwijaya FC and Persipura)), Perseman from Manokwari (founded in 1950 and runners-up of the Perserikatan in 1986, losing the final 0-1 to Persib from Bandung; they last played at the top level in 2007), Persidafon from Dafonsoro (at the second level 2010), Persiram from Raja Ampat (who play at the top level since 2011/12), Persiss from Sorong (competitors at the second level from 1989 to 2002), Perseru from Serui (promoted to the second level in 2010 and to the top level for the 2014 season after finishing the second level as runners-up to Persebaya in 2013) and PSBS from Biak Numfor (at the second level since 2011/12).\n\nNote that Indonesia also assumed control over the Southern Moluccas (Maluku Selatan) against the declared will of the majority of the population (which migrated in great numbers to the Netherlands) shortly after gaining independence. However, little is known about a separate football structure for this group of islands prior to their annexation by Indonesia; a regional league was organised on Ambon during the colonial era, won by H.V.C. in 1933.\n\nPS Ambon reached the interzonal stage of the Indonesian championship 1957-59 (corresponding to being among the top 15 clubs of the tournament), the championship playoff of 1964 (in which they finished 7th among 9 clubs) and the interzonal stage in 1964/65 (corresponding to being among the top 10 clubs of the tournament). In 1954 they had lost the decisive final qualifying match to reach the 6-team championship playoff 0-2 to PSM from Makassar, who thus represented eastern Indonesia instead.\n\nThe P.O.M.S. club in Hollandia listed above presumably was founded by members from the Ambonese diaspora (already in the colonial era, Ambonese clubs existed throughout the Indonesian archipelago, such as V.O.P. in Medan, S.V.J.A. in Batavia and Mena Moeria in Soerabaja; when Batavia became Djakarta (now Jakarta), the local S.V.J.A. (Sport Vereniging Jong Ambon) were renamed P.O.M.S., a more or less straightforward translation of their name into Indonesian).\n\nIsrael\n\nIsrael occupied the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in 1967, following the Six-Day war. For the definition of Israel, Palestine and British Palestine in the context of this document, see the section on British Palestine.\n\nPalestinian clubs in the Israeli football structure since 1967\n\nVarious Arab clubs were set up in Israel in the 1950s and 1960s, in cities such as "
