Prior to joining Tampa Bay, he spent two seasons (2010-12) with the Norfolk Admirals of the American Hockey League (AHL), winning the Calder Cup and AHL Coach of the Year Award in 2011-12, and part of one season with the AHL’s Syracuse Crunch.

Tavares also registered an assist on the play, moving him into a tie for the tournament lead in assists with nine.\n\nErik Karlsson and Grundström would give Sweden a 3-2 lead after scoring twice in 4:07 in the third period before Marcus Johansson scored into an empty net.\n\n“The really tough loss was last night because we wanted to be playing for a gold medal today, but we also wanted to win our last game and bring home a bronze medal. Today stings but the semifinal stings a lot too,” Dubois said. “Every time you come [to the world championship], you meet unbelievable people. Some are new and some are players that you have met before, and I had an unbelievable time with this group. After a month together, it is tough to be so close to playing in the gold medal game but losing in a shootout.”\n\nJordan Binnington (Richmond Hill, ON/St. Louis, NHL) made 29 saves in the loss. A full game summary can be found at HockeyCanada.ca.\n\n“It was a little tough to get our game going today, but I thought we were rock solid in the second period. We could have handled our lead a little better and I feel like we backed off [Sweden] too much, and unfortunately we were not as good as we needed to be,” said head coach André Tourigny (Nicolet, QC/Utah, NHL). “Our players worked hard all tournament, and they were very committed to winning and fought for each other. I have so much respect for all the guys in our room for the sacrifice they made to play in this tournament, and I am really proud of our team.”\n\nFollowing the semifinals, Cozens, Brandon Tanev (Toronto, ON/Seattle, NHL) and Colton Parayko (St. Albert, AB/St. Louis, NHL) were named Team Canada’s three best players of the tournament.\n\nCanada finished the preliminary round in first place in Group A after wins over Great Britain, Denmark, Austria, Norway, Finland, Switzerland and Czechia. It booked a spot in the semifinals after a 6-3 win over Slovakia before falling to Switzerland 3-2 in a shootout.\n\nSince 1931, Canada has collected 28 gold medals at the IIHF World Championship, to go along with 16 silver and seven bronze.\n\nFor more information on Hockey Canada and Canada’s National Men’s Team, please visit HockeyCanada.ca, or follow along via social media on Facebook, X and Instagram.\n\nThe 2024 IIHF World Championship comes to a close Sunday as Canada’s National Men’s Team faces off against Sweden for the bronze medal at O2 Arena.\n\nLast Game\n\nCanada saw its quest for back-to-back gold medals halted Saturday in a 3-2 semifinal shootout loss to Switzerland. After the Swiss took a 2-0 first-period lead, the Canadians got goals from Brandon Tanev and John Tavares – with just over two minutes remaining – to force extra time, but came up one short in the shootout.\n\nThe Swedes had their perfect run come to an unceremonious end with a 7-3 semifinal loss to host Czechia. Joel Eriksson Ek led the offence with a goal and an assist for the Swedes, who had allowed just 10 goals across eight games prior to Saturday, and outshot the Czechs 40-23.\n\nLast Meeting\n\nAn epic comeback highlighted the quarterfinal clash between the Canadians and Swedes in 2022. Trailing 3-0 entering the third period, Canada got goals from Ryan Graves, Pierre-Luc Dubois and Mat Barzal – the last two 30 seconds apart within the final two minutes – before Drake Batherson ended it 43 seconds into overtime for a 4-3 win and a place in the semifinals.\n\nWhat to Watch\n\nAs this edition of Team Canada takes to the ice for the final time, it’s important to note once again the youth movement that answered the call of its country in Czechia. The Canadian roster averages 25 years old, tied with Norway and the United States for the youngest in the tournament. Half – 12 of 24 – were born in 2000 or later, and just five – Binnington, Oleksiak, Power, Tanev and Tavares – are in their 30s. And it’s a decorated group: 25 gold medals at IIHF competitions, including the Olympics, Men’s Worlds, World Juniors and U18 Men’s Worlds. Of those 25, 14 are from the World Juniors, and 11 are within the last five years. The future of Canadian hockey looks bright.\n\nThe ageless Erik Karlsson is at it again for the Swedes. The 33-year-old has posted 10 points (5-5—10) in nine games for Sweden, tying him for the team lead with Marcus Johansson (5-5—10) and Andre Burakovsky (4-6—10) and leaving him two points back of Swiss captain Roman Josi for the tournament scoring lead among blue-liners. Karlsson – wearing the ‘C’ for the Swedes – is playing his first IIHF World Championship since 2012. His international trophy case also includes an Olympic silver medal (2014), Men’s Worlds bronze (2010) and World Juniors silver (2009).\n\nA Look Back\n\nNo opponent has been a more frequent foe for Canada at the IIHF World Championship than Sweden; Sunday’s game will mark the 69th meeting between the longtime rivals, dating back to a scoreless tie in 1931.\n\nSince the medal round was reintroduced to IIHF tournaments in 1992, it’s the fifth time the Canadians and Swedes will meet for a medal, but just the second for bronze; at the 1992 Men’s Worlds, Brian Savage and Adam Graves scored third-period goals, but Canada dropped a 3-2 decision in Lillehammer, Norway.\n\nAll-time record: Canada leads 36-27-5 (3-3 in OT/SO) Canada goals: 242 Sweden goals: 191\n\nCanada’s National Men’s Team is set for a semifinal showdown with Switzerland on Saturday at the 2024 IIHF World Championship, two wins away from a 29th world title.\n\nLast Game\n\nCanada punched its ticket to the semis with a 6-3 quarterfinal win over Slovakia on Thursday. Nick Paul led the way with a goal and an assist, Dylan Guenther added one of each and the Canadians took a two-goal lead before the five-minute mark of the first period and never looked back.\n\nThe Swiss moved into the final four for the first time since they won silver in 2018 – and gained a measure of revenge in the process – by beating Germany 3-1 in their quarterfinal. Christoph Bertschy opened and closed the scoring for Switzerland, which lost at the same stage (by the same score) to the Germans a year ago.\n\nLast Meeting\n\nIt’s been six whole days since the Canadians and Swiss clashed at Men’s Worlds. In a preliminary-round meeting last Sunday, Canada got three power-play goals – two from Dylan Cozens and one from Paul – in a 3-2 victory, handing Switzerland its first loss while keeping its unbeaten record intact.\n\nWhat to Watch\n\nPaul is best known to Team Canada fans for his overtime winner in the gold medal game at the 2021 IIHF World Championship, giving Canada the unlikeliest of world titles, and he has picked up right where he left off in Riga. The Mississauga native has found chemistry between Jared McCann and Connor Bedard (with Dylan Guenther sliding in on the right side on occasion), recording six points (3-3—6) in eight games. Paul, who had a terrific year with Tampa Bay, setting career-highs in goals (24), assists (22) and points (46), is in search of a third gold medal in as many tries; he was also part of the National Junior Team that won World Juniors gold in Toronto in 2015, scoring a goal in the gold medal game win over Russia.\n\nA late addition to the Swiss lineup, Kevin Fiala has made a major impact. Since he was added two games in after his Los Angeles Kings were eliminated from the NHL playoffs, all Fiala has done is score six goals and add five assists, tying him for the team scoring lead with Nico Hischier (6-5—11) and Roman Josi (3-8—11). He scored in regulation and the shootout in his debut against Czechia, had two goals against Denmark, one against Canada and two more against Finland, leaving him two back of Dylan Cozens for the tournament goal-scoring lead. Fiala has been an integral piece of the tournament’s highest-scoring power play (Switzerland is 10-for-34, a 29.4% success rate), scoring three times with the man advantage\n\nA Look Back\n\nIt’s meeting No. 36 between the Canadians and Swiss, with Canada laying claim to 27 wins from the first 35 (with two ties).\n\nThe most recent medal-round matchup came in the quarterfinals of the 2019 tournament in Kosice, Slovakia. With an early exit less than a second away, Damon Severson tied the game with four-tenths remaining before Mark Stone gave Canada a dramatic 3-2 overtime win. It’s the second time the countries will meet in a semifinal; in 2018, Bo Horvat and Colton Parayko scored goals, but Canada dropped a 3-2 decision in Copenhagen, Denmark.\n\nAll-time record: Canada leads 27-6-2 (4-2 in OT/SO) Canada goals: 172 Switzerland goals: 56\n\nIt’s on to the playoff round for Canada’s National Men’s Team, which takes on Slovakia in the first quarterfinal Thursday at the 2024 IIHF World Championship in Prague.\n\nLast Game\n\nCanada closed a out a perfect preliminary round Tuesday with an absolute thriller against the host Czechs, getting a pair of goals from Dylan Cozens – including a shorthanded overtime winner – in a 4-3 victory. Dawson Mercer and Brandon Hagel had the other Canadian goals in a game that saw six goals scored in a span of 17 minutes of the third period.\n\nThe Slovaks wrapped up the round-robin portion of their schedule with a 6-1 loss to Sweden on Tuesday. Michal Ivan scored the lone goal, while Stanislav Skorvanek finished with 37 saves as Slovakia dropped its second in a row.\n\nLast Meeting\n\nCanada and Slovakia went all the way to Round 8 of a shootout a year ago in the prelims in Riga, before Jack Quinn scored and Samuel Montembeault turned aside Martin Chromiak to secure a 2-1 win for the Canadians. Jake Neighbours scored the lone goal in regulation for Canada, which peppered Samuel Hlavaj with 44 shots through 65 minutes but needed a Michael Carcone goal in Round 5 to stay alive before Quinn got the winner.\n\nWhat to Watch\n\nHow about John Tavares? The Canadian captain arrived in Czechia just as the tournament began and has slid seamlessly into the lineup. His eight points (1-7—8) are second-most among Canadian skaters, trailing only Dylan Cozens, his seven assists are one back of the tournament lead and – perhaps most impressively – he has absolutely dominated in the face-off circle, winning a whopping 76% of his draws (76 of 100), which puts him almost eight percentage points of second-place Brady Tkachuk of the U.S. (68.5%). Although it has been eight years since he donned the Maple Leaf, Tavares is one of the country’s most decorated representatives – he has won two World Juniors gold medals, an Olympic gold, a World Cup of Hockey and a Spengler Cup, posting 89 points (42-47—89) in 74 international games.\n\nThe kids have been alright for Slovakia so far. While it’s 33-year-old Libor Hudacek leading the team in scoring with nine points (5-4—9) in seven prelim games, he’s followed closely behind by 20-year-olds Juraj Slafkovsky (0-7—7) and Simon Nemec (1-5—6) and 24-year-old Martin Pospisil (3-4—7). Slafkovsky and Nemec are the future of Slovak hockey – they made history in 2022 when they went one-two to Montreal and New Jersey, respectively, in the NHL Draft, becoming the highest drafted players ever from Slovakia. Slafkovsky announced his arrival on the international stage two years ago in Finland, recording nine points in eight games as an 18-year-old, one month before the Canadiens took him No. 1.\n\nA Look Back\n\nCanada has won the last five meetings with Slovakia, dating back to 2014, and 13 of the 17 all-time meetings going back to 1996 when Slovakia returned to the Top Division after its split from Czechia.\n\nIncluded in those 17 are three quarterfinal meetings – Slovakia earned a 3-2 victory in 2002, Patrice Bergeron had a goal and an assist in a 4-1 Canadian win in 2006 and the Slovaks made a late comeback to get a 4-3 victory in 2012.\n\nAll-time record: Canada leads 13-2-2 (1-0 in OT/SO) Canada goals: 65 Slovakia goals: 40\n\nCanada’s National Men’s Team closes out the preliminary round Tuesday at the 2024 IIHF World Championship, taking on host Czechia with an opportunity to wrap up first place in Group A.\n\nLast Game\n\nCanada leaned on its power play to score a 3-2 win over Switzerland in a battle of unbeaten teams Sunday. Dylan Cozens scored twice with the man advantage and Nick Paul added the game-winner on the power play as the Canadians took over sole possession in the group and handed the Swiss their first loss.\n\nThe Czechs last saw the ice Saturday, easing past Great Britain 4-1 for their fourth win in five games. Lukas Sedlak scored twice and added an assist, and Roman Cervenka provided four helpers in front of a crowd of 17,413 at O 2 Arena.\n\nLast Meeting\n\nThe Canadians and Czechs met at this same stage a year ago, in the prelim finale in Riga. In that one, Tyler Myers broke open a tie game early in the third period as Canada earned a 3-1 victory. Peyton Krebs and Lawson Crouse opened and closed the scoring for the Canadians, who finished with a 44-17 advantage in shots on goal.\n\nWhat to Watch\n\nPut the Maple Leaf on his chest, and all Cozens does is score goals. His two against the Swiss on Sunday give him six in as many games in Prague, tying him for the tournament lead (with Oliver Kapanen and Brady Tkachuk). Add those six to the seven he scored in 2022 and the 23-year-old is knocking on the door of the top five goal-scorers in Team Canada history at Men’s Worlds (Steve Yzerman, Jason Spezza and Matt Duchene are tied in that spot with 18). And it’s not as if this has come out of nowhere; Cozens scored 31 goals a season ago for the Buffalo Sabres, and netted 10 (and 25 points) across 14 games at the 2020 and 2021 World Juniors.\n\nReinforcements have arrived for Czechia. Martin Necas was added to the roster Saturday after his Carolina Hurricanes were eliminated from the NHL playoffs, and David Pastrnak and Pavel Zacha of the Boston Bruins were added Monday. Pastrnak is the big name; he had 110 points (47-63—110) with the Bruins this season (after posting 113 last season) and immediately becomes the best and most dangerous player on the roster. He has been terrific wearing the colours of his country – Pastrnak has 29 points (13-16—29) in 28 career games at Men’s Worlds, and added 14 (3-11—14) at two World Juniors.\n\nA Look Back\n\nThe 26 meetings between the Canadians and Czechs (since 1993, following the dissolution of Czechoslovakia) have been split almost right down the middle – Canada holds a narrow 14-12 advantage.\n\nDespite the balanced head-to-head history, it has been all Canada over the last decade; it has won the last eight meetings. That list includes three semifinal matchups – Mike Smith posted a 23-save shutout in 2015, Mark Stone had a goal and an assist in 2019, and Cozens scored twice and added a helper in 2022.\n\nAll-time record: Canada leads 14-12 (1-1 in OT/SO) Canada goals: 81 Czechia goals: 74\n\nCanada’s National Men’s Team looks to keep the momentum going as it takes on Switzerland in a showdown for first place in Group A on Sunday at the 2024 IIHF World Championship.\n\nLast Game\n\nCanada shook off a very slow start against Finland on Saturday to earn a 5-3 victory. Dylan Cozens, Brandon Tanev, Owen Power, Brandon Hagel and Dawson Mercer supplied the offence for the Canadians, who trailed 2-0 and were outshot 12-0 in the first eight minutes before mounting their comeback and improving their record to 5-0.\n\nThe Swiss also made it five wins from as many games Saturday, getting three points apiece from Kevin Fiala (2-1—3) and Nico Hischier (1-2—3) in an 8-0 win over Denmark. Leonardo Genoni made 17 saves to earn the second-straight shutout for Switzerland, which is unbeaten through five games for the third year in a row.\n\nLast Meeting\n\nThe teams met a year ago in the prelims in Riga. Tyler Toffoli opened the scoring midway through the second period and Michael Carcone finished it in the dying minutes, but the Canadians were left on the wrong end of a 3-2 result, the 14th of what would end up being 15 consecutive preliminary-round wins for the Swiss across three tournaments.\n\nWhat to Watch\n\nKnown primarily for his defensive prowess, Power chipped in on offence against the Finns with a goal and two assists – his first National Men’s Team goal after going without at the 2021 Men’s Worlds and 2022 Olympics. The Mississauga native burst onto the international scene at that 2021 tournament in Riga (just a few weeks before he was the No. 1 pick by Buffalo in the NHL Draft ), becoming the youngest player to wear the Maple Leaf and playing an increasingly large role as Canada won an unlikely world title. His only Team Canada goals before Saturday? He became the first Canadian defenceman to score a hat trick at the World Juniors when he got three against Czechia on Boxing Day 2021.\n\nRoman Josi has been an absolute beast on the blue-line for Switzerland, posting a tournament-leading 10 points (3-7—10) in five games. The Swiss captain was at his best in the 6-5 thriller against Austria last Sunday, scoring twice and adding two assists, including the primary helper on Hischier’s game-winner in the final minute. Josi’s performance in Prague is simply an extension of the terrific season he put together for the Nashville Predators – he is a Norris Trophy finalist after putting up 85 points (23-62—85) while playing all 82 games and leading the Predators to a playoff spot. Josi is no stranger to Men’s Worlds; this is his seventh appearance, owning a pair of silver medals from 2013 and 2018.\n\nA Look Back\n\nIt’s meeting No. 35 between the Canadians and Swiss, with Canada laying claim to 26 wins from the first 34 (with two ties).\n\nThe most recent Canadian victory came in the quarterfinals of the 2019 tournament in Kosice, Slovakia. With an early exit less than a second away, Damon Severson tied the game with four-tenths remaining before Mark Stone gave Canada a dramatic 3-2 overtime win.\n\nAll-time record: Canada leads 26-6-2 (4-2 in OT/SO) Canada goals: 169 Switzerland goals: 54\n\nCanada’s National Men’s Team gets into the meat of its preliminary-round schedule Saturday, taking on Finland as it begins a three-games-in-four-days stretch against the three teams chasing the Canadians in Group A.\n\nLast Game\n\nCanada made it four wins from as many games Thursday, holding Norway to just six shots on goal – zero in the first two periods – in a 4-1 victory. Brandon Tanev, Andrew Mangiapane, Dylan Cozens and Jared McCann scored the goals, while Nico Daws needed to make just five saves in his first start of the tournament.\n\nThe Finns suffered a historic 3-2 loss to Austria in their last time out Thursday, allowing the game-winning goal to Benjamin Baumgartner with just 0.2 seconds remaining. Saku Mäenalainen and Oliver Kapanen scored first-period goals for Finland, which lost to the Austrians for the first time in 11 all-time meetings at Men’s Words.\n\nLast Meeting\n\nThe Canadians clashed with the host Finns in the quarterfinals a year ago. In front of a pro-Finland crowd of more than 11,000 at Nokia Arena in Tampere, Canada got goals from Jack Quinn, Sammy Blais and Michael Carcone to grab a 3-0 lead by the early minutes of the third period, and an empty-netter from captain Tyler Toffoli capped a 4-1 victory and sent the Canadians on their way to gold.\n\nWhat to Watch\n\nHe may only be 20 years old with just 26 games of NHL experience, but Olen Zellweger hasn’t looked out of place in Prague. The defenceman has the best points-per-60-minutes average in the entire tournament – he has recorded four assists while playing just over 30 minutes in total across four games (averaging 7:36 of ice time per game). The Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, native, who didn’t make his NHL debut with Anaheim until Jan. 23, is no stranger to putting up numbers – in his final two WHL seasons with Everett and Kamloops, he totalled 158 points (46-112—158) in 110 games and won the Bill Hunter Trophy as WHL defenceman of the year in both seasons.\n\nKapanen has been the offensive star for the Finns through their first four games, scoring a tournament-leading six goals (one more than Connor Bedard). He had a hat trick in a win over Great Britain, and added two against Norway before striking against Austria. Kapanen, the 20-year-old nephew of former NHLer Sami Kapanen and cousin of St. Louis Blues forward Kaspei Kapanen, is almost halfway to his total from the regular season – he scored 14 times in 51 games with KalPa Kuopio, although he did net seven in just 13 postseason games as KalPa reached the Liiga semifinals.\n\nA Look Back\n\nTo say the Canadians and Finns are familiar foes at Men’s Worlds would be a bit of an understatement. Only Sweden (68 GP) has been a more frequent opponent for Canada than Finland, with the teams set to meet for a 55th time in Prague.\n\nThe Canadians own victories in 38 of the first 54, including gold medal game matchups in 1994 (4-3 Canada in a shootout), 2007 (4-2 Canada), 2016 (2-0 Canada), 2019 (3-1 Finland), 2021 (3-2 Canada in overtime) and 2022 (4-3 Finland in overtime).\n\nAll-time record: Canada leads 38-14-2 (3-3 in OT/SO) Canada goals: 280 Finland goals: 122"
