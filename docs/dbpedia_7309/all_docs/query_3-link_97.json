        "text": "Luis Suarez is a Uruguayan footballer who plays for Nacional in the Primera Division.\n\nPreviously, he played for Groningen, AFC Ajax, Liverpool, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid. He is also one of the most important players in the Uruguay national team.\n\nSuarez is known for his work rate, speed and his unpredictability, which has brought his behaviour into question. During his stints at Ajax and Liverpool, controversial incidents were all too frequent.\n\nThere were three biting incidents, a high-profile racism case, and a transfer request to leave Liverpool for Arsenal within the space of a few short years. Not to mention Suarez's infamous handball in the quarter-finals of the 2010 FIFA World Cup against Ghana.\n\nNevertheless, Suarez will go down in history as one of the most successful footballers of his generation.\n\nSuarez and Barcelona\n\nSuarez joined Barcelona from Liverpool in 2014, after Uruguay had been eliminated from the FIFA World Cup, for a reported fee of €82.3million. Suarez was handed the number 9 shirt, but missed a portion of the season as he served a four-month suspension for biting Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup.\n\nDuring the 2014/15 season, he was a part of the famed 'MSN' attacking trio, with Lionel Messi and Neymar, which saw Barcelona wrap up their third treble in six years. They beat Juventus 3-1 in the final of the UEFA Champions League with Suarez scoring the second goal for Barca, putting them ahead after Alvaro Morata had cancelled out Ivan Rakitic's opener.\n\nSuarez scored 40 La Liga goals in the 2015/16 season to win the Pichichi Trophy (La Liga top scorer) and the European Golden Shoe.\n\nBarcelona won La Liga and the Copa del Rey in 2015/16, but rivals Real Madrid claimed the UEFA Champions League.\n\nIn 2016/17, Barcelona began the season well by winning the Supercopa de Espana. However, they lost the La Liga title race to Real Madrid, who also retained their Champions League title.\n\nThe 2017 departure of Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain saw the end of the MSN era. Barcelona won La Liga in 2017/18, as Suarez scored 25 league goals. However, they were humiliated by AS Roma in the quarter-finals of the Champions League.\n\nIn 2018/19, Barcelona once again won La Liga, but were knocked out of the Champions League in dramatic fashion. Suarez was lambasted for celebrating in Barca's 3-0 first leg win over Liverpool in the semi-finals, but the Reds came out on top as they won the second leg 4-0 and went on to lift the trophy.\n\nIn 2019/20, Barcelona lost the La Liga title race to Real Madrid and were hammered 8-2 in the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals by Bayern Munich.\n\nAmid reported financial turmoil at Barcelona, Suarez was forced out of the club and moved to Atletico Madrid. Suarez scored 195 goals in 283 games, in all competitions, for Barcelona.\n\nMoving to Atletico Madrid\n\nSuarez was signed by Atletico head coach Diego Simeone on a two-year deal in September 2020. He was united with another one of the game's famous combative strikers, former Chelsea man Diego Costa.\n\nThe move caused consternation at Barcelona, with Messi in particular said to be angry at the club's decision to make Suarez leave the club.\n\nHis first season at Atletico saw him remain as one of La Liga's top scorers, with his new club dominating the first half of the season in Spain's top tier with Suarez playing a big part in their success.\n\nHe scored 21 goals in 32 La Liga games in his first season, helping the club to their first title in seven years.\n\nSuarez scored 11 league goals the following season, as the club finished third in the league, and he left the Spanish side at the end of his two-year deal.\n\nHe rejoined his boyhood club Nacional on a free transfer in July 2022, and scored in his first league game back at the club.\n\nSuarez and Liverpool\n\nSuarez moved from AFC Ajax to Liverpool in January 2011 for £23million. Initially, the intention on the part of Liverpool was for Suarez to complement Fernando Torres. However, Torres joined Chelsea at the end of the transfer window and Liverpool subsequently signed Andy Carroll from Newcastle United.\n\nSuarez was banned for eight games during the 2011/12 season after the FA ruled that he had racially abused Manchester United's Patrice Evra. Suarez denied the allegation.\n\nSuarez was not a prolific goalscorer for Liverpool until the 2012/13 season, when he scored 23 Premier League goals. It could have been more had he not been banned for biting Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic late in the season. He was charged with violent conduct, fined and given a 10-match ban. This was his second public biting incident, after he bit Otman Bakkal on the shoulder while playing for Ajax.\n\nAt the start of the 2013/14 season, Suarez submitted a transfer request to leave for Arsenal, but was convinced to stay at Anfield. He went on to score 31 Premier League goals and win the Golden Boot. However, Liverpool narrowly lost the title to Manchester City.\n\nSuarez was banned for eight games during the 2011/12 season after the FA ruled that he had racially abused Manchester United's Patrice Evra. Suarez denied the allegation.\n\nAt the end of the season Suarez signed for Barcelona on a five-year deal.\n\nSuarez's international career with Uruguay\n\nSuarez rose to infamy for his handball that denied Asamoah Gyan a goal which would all but have sent Ghana to the semifinals of the 2010 World Cup. The Black Stars would have become Africa's first team to compete in the last four of a World Cup tournament.\n\nUruguay were beaten by the Netherlands in the semi-finals and Germany in the third place playoff, but they won the Copa America tournament the following year.\n\nSuarez bit Giorgio Chiellini during the 2014 World Cup while Uruguay were playing Italy. The referee did not spot the incident at the time, but he was ultimately banned from football for four months.\n\nSuarez was in Uruguay's Copa America Centenario squad in 2016, but injury limited his involvement in the tournament.\n\nHe played in the 2018 World Cup, the 2019 and 2021 Copa Americas, which ultimately all saw La Celeste go out at the quarter-final stages.\n\nSuarez scored four goals during Uruguay's successful qualification for the 2022 Qatar World Cup.\n\nPersonal life\n\nSuarez is married to Sofia, his childhood sweetheart. The pair have three children, Delfina, Benjamin and Lauti.\n\nSuarez had a net worth of around $70 Million in 2022."
