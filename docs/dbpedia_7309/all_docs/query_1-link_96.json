        "text": "It almost feels appropriate to call Thursday’s 4-0 loss to the St. Louis Blues a cautionary tale of not producing on home ice, but the time for cautionary tales is long gone. The Coyotes are in do-or-die mode now, and they simply can no longer afford their drops in both effort and play at Gila River Arena this season.\n\nThe Coyotes (10-14-3 home record) already owned the fewest home wins this season before their game against the Blues. And with the club mired in a crowded Western Conference playoff race, there is no longer room for error at home.\n\nSimply put, the Coyotes need to find a way to produce in Glendale if they hope to earn their first playoff berth since the 2011-12 season.\n\n“Obviously it’s not good enough,” Coyotes captain Oliver Ekman-Larsson said. “We’ve got to win our games at home and we haven’t been able to do that. It’s frustrating and especially around this time of year. Every game is so important right now and especially our homestands. It’s huge for us, so we’ve got to find a way to win the home games.”\n\nThe Coyotes have the fewest goals scored (70) and points earned (23) on home ice this season. Arizona’s 70 goals on home ice are 11 fewer than the next-worst team in the NHL. Even the Coyotes’ power play, which has struggled all season, has been worse at home (16.1 percent) than on the road (19.4 percent).\n\nAfter a hard-fought, 5-2 road win over the Vegas Golden Knights on Tuesday, the Coyotes came out inexplicably flat during the first period of Thursday’s game. Joel Edmundson and Vladimir Tarasenko scored in the opening frame to put the Coyotes in a hole in which they could not climb out.\n\n“Whether it’s as a team or as an individual, you’re looking for your strongest effort,” Coyotes head coach Rick Tocchet said of Thursday’s game. “Some guys worked hard, but I thought some guys were sluggish tonight. The first two goals were miscues we can’t have against this team.\n\n“To play St. Louis, you’ve got to be quicker to them on the puck and early on we were sluggish.”\n\nEdmundson scored first at 3:33 when he got behind his man (Coyotes defenseman Jakob Chychrun) and collected a sharp feed from Blues forward Jaden Schwartz to tuck behind Darcy Kuemper in net.\n\nEdmundson collected an assist on the second goal of the first period when the defenseman found some open ice and fired a puck on net. Alone in front, Tarasenko converted a nifty deflection to get the puck through Kuemper for a 2-0 lead.\n\nThe Blues, who entered the game on a seven-game win streak, made it 3-0 when Tarasenko scored his second of the night on the power play. He unloaded a wrist shot from the high slot that whizzed by Kuemper’s glove and into the netting. Robert Bortuzzo made it 4-0 at 12:03 of the third period.\n\nWhile it is undoubtedly difficult to accurately judge the Coyotes with so many injured players out of the lineup, it’s important to note that it has by and large been the same players playing both at home and on the road.\n\nSo why do the Coyotes have 10 more goals and nine more points in the standings on the road than they do at home this season?\n\n“It’s obviously different to play away games,” Ekman-Larsson said. “You don’t have the crowd with you, but you should just play the same way home and away. I feel like we haven’t been able to start the games at home the way we want them to go. It’s frustrating, but we’ve got to find a way.”\n\nDating back before the All-Star break, the Coyotes currently find themselves mired in a stretch of 10 consecutive games against teams currently in playoff position. Two of those games remain, and one will be played at home. In the other eight games, the Coyotes have a lackluster 2-5-1 record (1-2 at home).\n\nLooking ahead at the Coyotes’ schedule, a ridiculously long homestand stretching from Feb. 24 to March 9 should seem like a blessing. But the way things have been falling for the Coyotes at home, it may not be. With several teams jockeying for position in the wild-card race, the homestand is shaping up to be a make-or-break stretch for the Coyotes, who were four points off the playoff pace after Thursday's loss.\n\nStill, the Coyotes will need to find a way to take advantage of home ice if they hope to use that stretch to their advantage.\n\n“Well, look at our record,” Tocchet said when asked to evaluate his team’s performance on home ice this season. “We’re three or four games under .500 and three or four games above .500 on the road. It’s disappointing. I honestly don’t know why. We have played some good games here, but not enough.\n\n“If you want to make the playoffs, you’ve got to have a really good home record.”\n\nUp next\n\nMaple Leafs at Coyotes, Saturday, 5 p.m., Gila River Arena, FSAZ/KTAR-AM (620) — Scottsdale-raised Auston Matthews and the playoff-bound Maple Leafs (36-18-3) visit the Coyotes (25-27-5) for the first and only time this season.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nAlex Galchenyuk getting hot at the right time for the Arizona Coyotes\n\nDarcy Kuemper shines as Coyotes pull away from Golden Knights in third period\n\nJason Demers made his return to Coyotes practice, and players took notice\n\nRichard Morin covers the Coyotes and Diamondbacks for azcentral sports.

It’s do-or-die mode now, and the Coyotes need to start getting things done on home ice."
