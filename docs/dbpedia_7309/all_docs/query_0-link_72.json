        "text": "Vinyl is the only thing that's rising because I think it's the only thing that the real music lovers are attaching themselves to-because it's a tangible format that has lasted this long for a reason, because it still sounds the best, it still feels the best. There's an inherent romance to it. When you see the disc moving around, you feel connected, you got up and put the needle down, you feel connected. Just like in a movie theater when they turn the lights down and the movie comes up you feel reverential toward it. When it's digital and you can fast-forward and skip it with a mouse and click it off, you're not reverential toward the music. You're the one is control and you're pushing it around. You can imagine if you're in a movie theater and you could fast forward the movie, it would be a disaster. That's what vinyl is to music.\n\n... All the music lovers know it, all the musicians know it, we've all been saying that no one wants it to be invisible and digital. It's great to have a portable song that you can listen to in your car, that's great, but when it comes down to it, we want to be reverential toward the art form, and the music business is in a giant mess right now, because of technology. And that's the only reason. If the technology hadn't changed we wouldn't be in the mess we're in.\n\n... If you tell someone about a band, if they can't go on YouTube and listen to the band, they get disinterested and they'll move onto something else. You used to go travel around. I used to go really far, to another record store like 45 minutes away because they had the record that the other store didn't . You'd get up out of your seat and do something for real.\n\nThat's what this truck is about: it's about people coming here and experiencing something for real. There's a novelty aspect to it, but the best part of it is that people are coming here with their physical bodies and they're talking about music together and what bands they like and what records Third Man is putting out that they've got, and we have Third Man playing onstage. There's nothing going on here in the virtual world, this is all real. That's the thing about coming to a festival, people really want to experience music."
