        "text": "The St. Louis Blues have not had the best of luck against the Los Angeles Kings recently. While they did not need to in 2015-16, it might still do the Blues good to exercise those ghosts.\n\nThe St. Louis Blues have had a complicated recent past with the Los Angeles Kings. Since the decade changed, the Kings became a regular kryptonite for the Blues.\n\nMuch of it has to do with Jonathan Quick. For whatever reason, he has been a thorn in the side of the Blues for the last several years.\n\nQuick can be made to look foolish against any other team. However, when he suits up against the Blues, he seems to always bring his A game.\n\nThat was never more evident than the two playoff series played in 2012 and 2013. The Blues might as well have been shooting at a brick wall, it was so hard to beat Quick at those times.\n\nAdd to that, the Kings being good enough to win the Cup and make the conference finals in those years and it doesn’t add up for Blues’ success.\n\nThe Kings are not an incredibly old team, but like the Sharks, they are in win-now mode. Whether they can rebound from a first round loss last season will be up to them.\n\nKey Additions\n\nThe Los Angeles Kings were quite busy in the offseason. Whether they made themselves any better is the question.\n\nThe Kings added Teddy Purcell, Jeff Zatkoff and Tom Gilbert. If none of those names jump off the page at you, it’s because they aren’t exactly household names.\n\nPurcell actually started his career with the Kings. After appearing to be a little bit of a bust, he had some career years with the Tampa Bay Lightning.\n\nApr 14, 2016; Sunrise, FL, USA; Florida Panthers right wing Teddy Purcell (26) celebrates after his goal past New York Islanders goalie Thomas Greiss (1) in the first period on the first round of the 2016 Stanley Cup Playoffs at BB&T Center. Mandatory Credit: Robert Mayer-USA TODAY Sports\n\nIt was downhill from there though. He’s never been a bad player, by any means, but his production was very middle of the road, especially in Edmonton.\n\nZatkoff was brought in to give the Kings a few more options in net. Quick is obviously the starter, but whether Zatkoff is the defacto backup or battling with Peter Budaj is up to the Kings’ staff.\n\nZatkoff spent the last three years in Pittsburgh, but only saw a handful of games. He filled in very well as Matt Murray’s backup when Marc-Andre Fleury went out with injury.\n\nGilbert is little more than an aging defenseman the Kings are trying to use as a body to fill a gap. They have been searching for answers since losing some key blueliners over the last few seasons, but Gilbert is unlikely to be the one to fill that void.\n\nKey Losses\n\nJhonas Enroth is now with the Toronto Maple Leafs. When you have Quick in net, it’s not a huge loss to have backups leave. Still, the Kings have been bleeding backup goaltenders for what feels like years.\n\nIn addition to being backups, Martin Jones, Ben Scrivens and Jonathan Bernier have all been the goalies of the future the past four years. All are on different teams now. You wonder if the carousel of backups catches up to the team.\n\nAlso gone is Milan Lucic. After a few diminishing returns in Boston, Lucic seemed like he had found a home with the Kings.\n\nOct 8, 2016; Edmonton, Alberta, CAN; Edmonton Oilers forward Milan Lucic (27) and Vancouver Canucks forward Jannik Hansen (36) battle for a loose puck during the first period of a preseason hockey game at Rogers Place. Mandatory Credit: Perry Nelson-USA TODAY Sports\n\nHe fit their style. Their game needed him. It should have been a marriage.\n\nHowever, the term and dollars did not add up for the Kings. Now Lucic is in Edmonton, trying to be the veteran leader on a team of highly skilled, but very green players.\n\nKings Outlook\n\nThe Kings missed the playoffs in 2014-15, one season after winning it all. They lost in the first round last season.\n\nNone of that bodes well for another championship run in 2016-17. That doesn’t mean it cannot happen.\n\nblues\n\nBleedin' Blue 3wSt. Louis Blues' Brett Hull And The Game Nobody Knew About\n\nMore headlines around FanSided:\n\n4w - NHL Daily: Las Vegas Team Name, Johnny Gaudreau Contract9w - St. Louis Blues: Gearing Up For The World Cup of Hockey66w - Phoenix Copley Sent to Blues in TJ Oshie TradeMore News at Bleedin' Blue\n\nThe Kings still have a highly varied lineup with skill, skaters, scorer and role players. They have a decent mix of veterans and youth.\n\nThe problem for Los Angeles is they don’t have the room to add pieces. If there is something missing, they will have to give up a lot to get it.\n\nRight now, the Kings have a little over half a million in cap space. They are weighed down by some long contracts to aging players that will likely be hard to ditch.\n\nAdd to that a little turmoil and it’ll be an interesting year. Dustin Brown was stripped of his captaincy and was not hesitant to let people know his frustration.\n\nWhether Darryl Sutter can smooth all the wrinkles out in time for the playoffs will be a task.\n\nStill, on paper, the Kings are still one of the three best teams in the Pacific. It seems unlikely anyone in that division has made enough improvements to unseat them.\n\nThe Kings did have 95 points the year they missed though. So, stranger things could happen.\n\nBlues Games\n\nThe Blues have seen such a mixed bag with the Kings of late. The Kings dominated in the playoffs, sweeping the Blues the first year and winning 4-2 the next.\n\nThe regular season has been a bit better, but not much. The Blues won two of three last year, but had lost two of three two years in a row prior to that.\n\nAdd in just one regular season win between 2011-12 and 2012-13 and it has been a thin decade to this point.\n\nAll in all, the Blues still have the edge in the series. 110-82-22 is the overall split between the two.\n\nIt won’t be too long before these two battle it out again. The Kings come to town on Saturday, October 29.\n\nThe Blues begin a west coast swing with a game in LA on Thursday, January 12. St. Louis then goes back out west, starting with the Kings, on Monday, March 13.\n\nThe Blues typically don’t play well in Los Angeles. Their win last season was the first since 2011.\n\nTwo games out west isn’t the best of ideas, but it’s what the Blues have to deal with. Another 2-1 record this season would be a very good result.\n\nMore from Bleedin' Blue\n\nThis article originally appeared on"
