        "text": "Using the VUKOTA projection system of Hockey Prospectus, Insider takes the temperature of key players on every NHL team, continuing with St. Louis. For a detailed explanation of Prospectus' proprietary GVT value metric, read more here.\n\nSummer Skate -- St. Louis Blues\n\nThe St. Louis Blues began the 2010-11 season in first place, but before long they were devastated by injuries and found themselves once again on the outside looking in.\n\nThey finished the season on a strong note, thanks to a big offensive upgrade from acquiring Chris Stewart and Kevin Shattenkirk from the Colorado Avalanche, and they picked up some needed veteran depth in the offseason, adding Jason Arnott and Jamie Langenbrunner.\n\nIt's time for the Blues to finally realize their potential and make a long-overdue return appearance to the NHL playoffs.\n\nTrending up: RW Jamie Langenbrunner\n\nLast season: -0.4 GVT | VUKOTA projection: 1.7 GVT\n\nSince the lockout, Langenbrunner has averaged almost 20 goals and 55 points, topping out at 29 goals and 69 points and plus-25 in 2008-09.\n\nTwo years later, he managed just nine goals and 32 points, and he dropped to a career-worst minus-18. A change in role and scenery is just what Langenbrunner needs to reverse this trend and potentially end his great career on a high note.\n\nThe pressure is off in St. Louis, as the Olympic silver medalist and two-time Stanley Cup champion will be called on to provide only secondary scoring and veteran leadership for the tremendous young talent he'll be playing alongside.\n\nTrending down: C Andy McDonald\n\nLast season: 14.3 GVT | VUKOTA projection: 8.9 GVT\n\nInjuries have caught up to McDonald -- one of the few Blues older than 30 at the end of last season -- and this might be the season when he finally slows down.\n\nMcDonald is coming off a strong 20-goal, 50-point, plus-18 season despite playing just 58 games and averaging 20 minutes per game.\n\nBarring perfect health, McDonald, now 34, is unlikely to reach those levels again this season.\n\nName to know -- LW Evgeny Grachev\n\nAfter scoring 40 goals and 80 points in 60 OHL games in 2008-09 as an 18-year-old, Grachev's prospect stock skyrocketed, and he was the kind of player who had people wondering not whether he would play but just how good he would be.\n\nTwo underwhelming AHL seasons later, expectations have been reduced for Grachev, who requested a trade from the New York Rangers and was dealt to the Blues on the draft floor this past June.\n\nThere's still a fair amount to like with Grachev's game, though. He's a 6-foot-4, 222-pound forward who can skate at a fine level, is a hard worker and certainly projects, at the moment, to be a good third-line player.\n\nHe has some offensive upside, but it doesn't look as if that will be his game. Instead, he likely can be a big-body power winger who can play good defense and chip in some offense.\n\nGrachev likely has hit his ceiling, and he could play on St. Louis' bottom six this season.\n\nRob Vollman is one of the original authors of the Hockey Prospectus website and an author of the Hockey Prospectus 2010-11 annual. He writes regularly for ESPN Insider."
