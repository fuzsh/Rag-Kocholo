        "text": "HOME SWEET HOME – The Capitals host the St. Louis Blues on Wednesday at Capital One Arena. In their most recent game, the Capitals beat the Chicago Blackhawks on Monday, 4-3, in overtime. Wednesday night marks Washington’s second of six preseason games in total and the second of three home games. Since 2011-12, the Capitals are 16-5-4 at home in preseason games.\n\nGREAT 8 – Capitals captain Alex Ovechkin will make his preseason debut against St. Louis. Ovechkin is entering his 15th season with Washington this year. The franchise’s all-time leader in games played (1,084) enters the season with 658 career goals, and Ovechkin currently sits in 13th place on the NHL’s all-time list, 11 goals shy of passing Luc Robitaille (668) for 12th place all-time. Should Ovechkin record another 50 goals this season, which would mark his ninth 50-goal season in his career, Ovechkin will tie Mike Gartner (708) for the seventh most goals in NHL history and pass Robitaille (668), Teemu Selanne (684), Mario Lemieux (690), Steve Yzerman (692) and Mark Messier (694). Ovechkin became the 12th-fastest player in NHL history to reach the 650-goal mark last season and just the fourth\n\nplayer in NHL history to record at least 650 goals with the same team (Detroit’s Gordie Howe and Steve Yzerman, Pittsburgh’s Mario Lemieux).\n\nBETTER PANIK – Richard Panik, who signed a four year deal with the Capitals on July 1, will be making his preseason debut. Panik recorded 33 points (14g, 19a) in 75 games with the Arizona Coyotes last season, ranking sixth on the team in points. The Martin, Slovakia, native ranked first on Arizona in shot attempt percentage (50.96 percent), on-ice shot attempts per 60 minutes played (60.84), on-ice goals for (44) and goals for per 60 minutes of play (2.71) at five-on-five among Coyotes with at least 50 games played. Additionally, he ranked first in goals percentage relative to his teammates (0.99 percent) and second in shot attempt percentage relative to his teammates (2.80 percent). In 410 career games between the Tampa Bay Lightning, the Toronto Maple Leafs, the Chicago Blackhawks and Arizona, Panik has recorded 159 points (75g, 84a).\n\nRAD RADKO – Capitals defenseman Radko Gudas will make his preseason debut for Washington against St. Louis. Gudas, a native of Prague, Czech Republic, recorded 20 points (4g, 16a) in 77 games with the Flyers last season, his third career season with at least 20 points. Gudas’ 51.14 goals for percentage at five-onfive ranked first among Flyers defensemen and second overall on the team (Claude Giroux: 53.13) among players with at least 30 games played. Additionally, Gudas’ 202:06 total penalty kill minutes were the second most on Philadelphia. His career 51.88 shot attempt percentage (6,487 shot attempts for, 6,018 against) at five-on-five ranks 23rd in the NHL among active defensemen with at least 400 career games since 2012-13, his rookie year. Since 2012-13, Gudas ranks second among NHL defensemen in hits (1,484). In 416 career games between Philadelphia and the Tampa Bay Lightning, Gudas has collected 105 points (24g, 81a) and recorded 579 penalty minutes.\n\nIMPRESSIVE SHOWING – Capitals forward Aliaksei Protas, who was selected in the third round, 91st overall, in the 2019 NHL Draft, recorded three points (1g, 2a) in the Capitals’ 4-3 overtime win against the Chicago Blackhawks. Protas, a native of Vitebsk, Belarus, leads all rookies in the preseason in points. Protas registered 40 points (11g, 29a) in 61 games with Prince Albert in the WHL last season and an additional 22 points (12g, 10a) in 23 playoff games, helping the Raiders win the Ed Chynoweth Cup as the WHL Champions. He ranked seventh among WHL rookies in points. Protas also took part in the Capitals’ Prospect Showcase earlier this month in Antioch, Tenn., recording an assist in three games. He is the first player the Capitals have drafted from Belarus in franchise history.\n\nCZECH VITEK – Vitek Vanecek is expected to play against the Blues. Vanecek posted a record of 21-10-6 with a 2.62 goals against average and a .907 save percentage in 38 games with the Bears last season. The Capitals’ second round pick, 39th overall, in the 2014 NHL Draft, was named to the 2019 AHL All-Star Classic and was named the CCM/AHL Player of the Week for the period ending Oct. 21, 2018. He allowed two or fewer goals in 19 games last season. Additionally, Vanecek posted a 1-3 record with a 2.25 goals against average and a .935 save percentage in four playoff games. In 110 career games with the Bears, Vanecek has a 52-33-24 record with a 2.69 goals against average, a .903 save percentage and nine shutouts.\n\nSAMMY – Ilya Samsonov is expected to play against the Blues. Samsonov finished his first professional season last year in North America with a 20-14-2 record, a 2.70 goals against average and a .898 save percentage in 37 games with Hershey in the AHL. Samsonov tied for eighth in the AHL in shutouts (3) and won six consecutive games from Feb. 2 to Feb. 27, posting a 1.46 goals against average and a .947 save percentage in that span. Additionally, Samsonov appeared in five playoff games with Hershey, finishing with a 2-3-0 record, a 2.99 goals against average and a .897 save percentage.\n\nBLUES BEATERS – Alex Ovechkin has earned 30 points (17g, 13a) in 19 career regular season games against the Blues and has recorded a hat trick in two of his last seven games against St. Louis. In addition, Ovechkin has registered a multi-point game in 10 of his 19 career games against St. Louis. Nicklas Backstrom has earned 24 points (8g, 16a) in 18 career regular season games against the Blues and has tallied a point in 13 of his 18 games. In addition, he has tallied seven multipoint games in his last 14 games against St. Louis.\n\nHOME GROWN – In total, 15 players selected by Washington in the NHL draft are in the lineup for Washington on Monday, including 2018 second round draft pick Martin Fehervary. Fehervary registered seven points (1g, 6a) for HV-71 in the Swedish Hockey League in 45 games during the 2018-2019 season. Fehervary also captained Team Slovakia during the World Junior Championship, recording five points (1g, 4a) in five games. He was named a top three player on Slovakia during the tournament.
