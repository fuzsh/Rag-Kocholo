        "text": "The 2016 World Cup of Hockey is seven and a half months away and the first names that will compete in Toronto from September, 17th to October, 1st were announced last Wednesday. Every nation (err..every Team) had to name 16 of the 23 players that would bring to the tournament, with at least two of them being goalies, and that meant that we would get to start the always entertaining game of projecting the names included, the major snubs and the potential surprises. To be clear, the subjects I consider “entertained” here are hockey nerds, hockey writers with columns to fill and people with too much time on their hands.\n\nAnyway, in advance of the announcements, I took a couple of hours off my busy schedule to speculate on every player that would appear on the rosters’ lists (and not the ones I believed should have been selected), and then proceeded to evaluate my performance. This article describes my choices and rationales, and tries to impart into the thought-process of the management teams that actually had to do the job. I also sprinkle in a few predictions about the players that will be added until June 1st, when complete rosters have to be delivered.\n\nA few months ago, I filed in a post about the construction of Team Europe’s roster (which you can read here and here ), so I plugged in some info from the analysis I did back then, and I am currently working on a detailed report on Team North America that will follow much of the same structure, thus refrained to share (or rehash) some ideas in this post regarding those two squads.\n\nMy main resource to speed up the process of compiling the potential preliminary rosters of every nation was this website , where you can sort out every NHL player that played in a season for nationality and position. It really saved up the time of scouring all NHL rosters, and I would also like to thank the European Teams for trying to restrict their players’ pool to the NHL. Especially Team Russia, who expediently announced the first 16 names would all be NHLers.\n\nThe article is naturally separated by each competing team, with each section starting with a resume of my mishaps, as OUT are players I wrongly named in my projection and IN are the ones who took their spot. I then transcribed my forecasted rosters and bolded the names I got right while expressing some ideas about every group (forwards, defenseman and goalies).\n\nAll the “real” preliminary rosters can be found here\n\nTeam Sweden\n\nOut: C Carl Soderberg, G Jhonas Enroth\n\nIN: D Niklas Kronwall (Detroit Red Wings), G Jacob Markstrom (Vancouver Canucks)\n\nForwards (9): Nicklas Backstrom (Washington Capitals), Daniel Sedin (Vancouver Canucks), Loui Eriksson (Boston Bruins), Alex Steen (St. Louis Blues), Henrik Sedin (Vancouver Canucks), Filip Forsberg (Nashville Predators), Gabriel Landeskog (Colorado Avalanche), Henrik Zetterberg (Detroit Red Wings), Carl Soderberg (Colorado Avalanche)\n\nSweden was the only team to name just eight forwards and they’re all pretty much unassailable, forming a formidable staple up front. I’m pretty confident Soderberg will be part of the final group of 13, with his versatility and experience playing both left wing and center, but the amount of great candidates for the other four spots is staggering.\n\nMarcus Kruger may be an ideal checking pivot to slot behind Henrik Sedin, Zetterberg and Backstrom, but Mika Zibanejad and Mikael Backlund are also in the run, while on the wings they can mix and match with the tenacity of Patric Hornqvist, the skill of Gustav Nyquist and Jakob Silfverberg or the speed of Carl Hagelin, Rickard Rackell and Andre Burakovsky.\n\nDefenseman (5): Erik Karlsson (Ottawa Senators), Oliver Ekman-Larsson (Arizona Coyotes), Victor Hedman, Anton Stralman (Tampa Bay Lightning), Niklas Hjalmarsson (Chicago Blackhawks)\n\nThe Tre Kronor’s blueline is once again absolutely stacked and I did hope they would leave two spots open for the wealth of options available. Niklas Kronwall’s decorated history with the national team proved too important, and moved out, for now, John Klingberg, who, for much of the first half of the NHL season, kept pace with Erik Karlsson in terms of offensive production. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the steady Anton Stralman was recognized, and should continue to be paired with Victor Hedman, a notable absence in Sochi 2014.\n\nIf Sweden makes the mistake of leaving Klingberg home, Johnny Oduya (Chicago Blackhawks) and Mattias Ekholm (Nashville Predators) should be the next in line, even if you can’t discount Alexander Edler, who, mind-bogglingly, was selected to cover for Karlsson on the top pair in 2014. Alas, let’s just hope the new coaching staff is smarter and joins the forces of Karlsson and Ekman-Larsson, creating a delightful, mouth-watering partnership.\n\nGoalies (2): Henrik Lundqvist (NY Rangers), Jhonas Enroth (LA Kings)\n\nIf some teams opted to name three goaltenders, Sweden probably would have liked to leave it to Lundqvist, their only NHL starter. Enroth was considered the best goalie at the 2013 World Championships the Swedes won, and I thought that would give him the edge, but Markstrom and his never-truly-realized immense potential were favoured. The third slot may be decided by a coin flip between Enroth, Eddie Lack (Carolina Hurricanes), Robin Lehner (Buffalo Sabres) and even Anders Nilsson (St. Louis Blues).\n\nTeam Finland\n\nOut: C Joonas Kempainnen, D Jyrki Jokipakka, D Sami Lepisto\n\nIN: C Teuvo Teravainen (Chicago Blackhawks), LW Lauri Korpikovski (Edmonton Oilers), D Esa Lindell (Dallas Stars)\n\nForwards (9): Mikko Koivu (Minnesota Wild), Jussi Jokinen, Aleksander Barkov (Florida Panthers), Valteri Filppula (Tampa Bay Lightning), Jori Lehtera (St. Louis Blues), Mikael Granlund (Minnesota Wild), Leo Komarov (Toronto Maple Leafs) , Joonas Donskoi (San Jose Sharks), Joonas Kemppainen (Boston Bruins)\n\nFinland never possesses the flashiest attack in senior competitions and that won’t change in the World Cup, since none of the first eight forwards above is a goal scorer. Donskoi is definitely the less known commodity but he’s had a fine debut season in the NHL and his selection was expected.\n\nLauri Korpikoski ‘s omission from my list was in favour of 27-year-old Kemppainen, part of last year’s World Championship squad before settling in Boston, while the below-expectations season put on by the talented Teuvo Teravainen convinced me he wouldn’t make the cut. Erik Haula, the third-year Minnesota Wild centre, is also a strong candidate to be a part of the final roster.\n\nDefenseman (5): Rasmus Ristolainen (Buffalo Sabres), Olli Maatta (Pittsburgh Penguins), Sami Vatanen (Anaheim Ducks), Jyrki Jokipakka (Calgary Flames), Sami Lepisto (Avtomobilist Yekaterinburg, KHL)\n\nA grand total of six Finnish defensemen have suited up for NHL teams in 2015-16, and only four have played more than 10 games. Thus, this screening process wasn’t exactly difficult, even if the youth of the group is a really big concern. Ristolainen (21 years-old), Maatta (21) and Vatanen (24) are all relatively inexperienced, even if the last two were already key components in Sochi 2014, so I searched a bit to bring up the name of Lepisto, a 31-year-old former NHLer with two Olympic bronze medals in his résumé. He’s no Kimmo Timonen, but his experience will definitely be appreciated.\n\nThe offensive-minded Esa Lindell, another 21-year-old, jumped in front of Jokipakka, who just a few days ago was his teammate on the Stars organization, despite only 4 NHL appearances against more than 90 amassed by the 24-year-old.\n\nGoalies (2): Pekka Rinne (Nashville Predators), Tuukka Rask (Boston Bruins)\n\nRinne and Rask are studs and will battle it out for the starting spot, with Boston’s mainstay having the edge. The Dallas Stars duo of Kari Lehtonen and Antti Niemi should extend their on-going confront to the national team, with the latter in advantage at this time.\n\nTeam Russia\n\nOut: D Alexei Emelin, D Fedor Tyutin, D Evgeni Medvedev\n\nIN: C Vladislav Namestnikov (Tampa Bay Lightning), D Dmitry Orlov (Washington Capitals), G Andrei Vasilevski (Tampa Bay Lightning)\n\nForwards (9): Alexander Ovechkin, Evgeni Kuznetsov (Washington Capitals), Artemi Panarin, Artem Anisimov (Chicago Blackhawks), Evgeni Malkin (Pittsburgh Penguins), Vladimir Tarasenko (St. Louis Blues), Pavel Datsyuk (Detroit Red Wings), Nikita Kucherov (Tampa Bay Lightning), Nikolai Kulemin (NY Islanders)\n\nSix of the top 25 point producers in the NHL are Russian forwards, and you just need to look at their names to confirm that they won’t lack firepower and copious amounts of offensive skill. The nine names picked up are non-brainers and Vladislav Namestnikov is a tenth no one disputes.\n\nRight now, the question is where two all-world talents like Ilya Kovalchuk and Alexander Radulov fit in, since someone has to backcheck and kill penalties on that group. Datsyuk, Kulemin and Anisimov won’t be enough, so I expect Alexander Burmistrov (Winnipeg Jets) to be one of the late picks, with Viktor Tikhonov (Arizona Coyotes) also expected to carve his spot. A final note for Russia’s depth down the middle, significantly improved with the emergence of Evgeny Kuznetsov, who joins Malkin, Datsyuk, and Anisimov.\n\nDefenseman (5): Andrei Markov (Montreal Canadiens), Alexei Emelin (Montreal Canadiens), Dmitri Kulikov (Florida Panthers), Fedor Tyutin (Columbus Blue Jackets), Evgeni Medvedev (Philadelphia Flyers)\n\nMarkov and Kulikov, who was left off the 2014 Olympic Games’ roster, were easy picks but Russia’s decision to ignore all the veteran blueliners caught me off guard. After all, the 31-year-old Tyutin participated in the last three Olympics, Medvedev is a regular fixture on their World Championships representations’, and Emelin’s physical style is pretty uncommon in the rest of their defensive options. No doubt the trio has seen his best years but I fully expect to see them on the final roster.\n\nDmitry Orlov (Capitals) has impressed with his offensive instincts this season for the Capitals and provides some much needed puck-moving ability to the group, thus the 24-year-old was always on the radar to be one of the seven rearguards on the list. Another player that has those types of qualities is Slava Voynov (SKA Saint Petersburg, KHL) but he’s persona non-grata for the NHL and NHLPA, hence the pressure to leave him at home is significant.\n\nGoalies (2): Semyon Varlamov (Colorado Avalanche), Sergei Bobrovsky (Columbus Blue Jackets)\n\nWith Anton Khudobin buried on Anaheim’s depth chart, there were only three regular NHL goalies to choose from, so I guess they just decided to put the subject behind their back for all. The inconsistent Varlamov and a Bobrosvky coming off a nightmarish season will square off for possession of Russia’s crease, with Andrei Vasilevsky on the lookout in case both falter.\n\nTeam Czech Republic\n\nOut: RW Jaromir Jagr, RW Radim Vrbata, RW Jiri Hudler, D Zbynek Michalek, D Marek Zidlicky\n\nIN: LW Tomas Hertl (San Jose Sharks), RW David Pastrnak (Boston Bruins), D Andrej Sustr (Tampa Bay Lightning), D Michal Kempny (Avangard Omsk, KHL), G Ondrej Pavelec (Winnipeg Jets)\n\nForwards (10) : David Krejci (Boston Bruins), Jakub Voracek (Philadelphia Flyers), Tomas Plekanec (Montreal Canadiens), Jaromir Jagr, Jiri Hudler (Florida Panthers), Martin Hanzal (Arizona Coyotes), Radim Vrbata (Vancouver Canucks), Ondrej Palat (Tampa Bay Lightning Lightning), Michael Frolik (Winnipeg Jets), Vladimir Sobotka (Avangard Omsk, KHL)\n\nDoing this prediction on a couple of hours was bound to lead to some blunders, and indicating Jagr is among those, as the 44-year-old and the team’s brass had already agreed to wait for the legend to decide on whether he wanted to represent his country one last (more?) time.\n\nVrbata and Hudler also fall in a similar category, as both were bizarre and glaring exclusions from the roster on the 2014 Olympics. Two years later, Vrbata is 34-years-old and going through a tough season in Vancouver, thus I can understand where they’re coming from. However, Hudler (32) is still productive, even if at a level significantly below his 2014-15 career season, and would have helped this team. Anyway, it’s not the first time the Czech take some strange decisions in terms of roster construction, and seems now clear that neither player is on their plans.\n\nNevertheless, looking at the entire group of 16, no player is older than 30, and going with the youthful exuberance and tremendous speed of Hertl and Pastrnak, two of the few exciting talents produced by the country recently, is definitely defendable. In the end, it won’t be the vital difference between failure and success.\n\nTo round out the forward group, the energetic Vladimir Sobotka is a great pickup, and I expect to see a couple more European-based players added later. Dmitri Jaskin, the 22-year-old St. Louis Blues forward, was the odd man out when I finished my preliminary group, but I believe he’ll also be part of the 23-man roster.\n\nDefenseman (4): Zbynek Michalek (Arizona Coyotes), Roman Polak (San Jose Sharks), Radko Gudas (Philadelphia Flyers), Marek Zidlicky (NY Islanders)\n\nMy mishaps predicting the Czech roster extended to the blueline, where the unassuming Andrej Sustr, a regular on last season’s Stanley Cup finalists, was left off my roster. Although, in my defence, I can note that the 25-year-old is a bottom-pairing guy for his team and never represented his country on senior international competitions before.\n\nThe absence of Michalek is truly surprising, as the 33-year-old is an extremely reliable defensive presence boasting a long history with the national team. Meanwhile, Zidlicky is another notable omission because, despite being 39-years-old, his powerplay prowess and passing ability aren’t approached by any other Czech rearguard.\n\nIn contrary, out of nowhere came Michal Kempny, a 25-year-old undrafted defenseman that plays on the left side… and that’s all we know about him. As for Polak and Gudas, they will use all means necessary to keep the opponents in check, so their adversaries definitely hope they’re not paired together.\n\nGoalies (2): Petr Mrazek (Detroit Red Wings), Michal Neuvirth (Philadelphia Flyers)\n\nJust like Russia, there were only three real options to consider here, so makes sense that Pavelec’s inclusion was already taken care off. Nevertheless, at least this time, he won’t be the starter on the tournament, with the Czech hopes’ resting on the shoulders of the much more trustworthy Petr Mrazek, a star in the making.\n\nTeam Europe\n\nOut: C Lars Eller, RW Marian Gaborik, RW Nino Niederreiter\n\nIN: C Leon Draisatl (Edmonton Oilers), LW Tomas Vanek (Minnesota Wild), RW Jannik Hansen (Vancouver Canucks)\n\nForwards (9): Anze Kopitar (LA Kings, SLO), Marian Gaborik (LA Kings, SVK), Tomas Tatar (Detroit Red Wings, SVK), Marian Hossa (Chicago Blackhawks, SVK), Mikkel Boedker (Colorado Avalanche, DEN), Lars Eller (Montreal Canadiens, DEN), Mats Zuccarello (NY Rangers, NOR), Frans Nielsen (NY Islanders, DEN), Nino Niederreiter (Minnesota Wild, SUI)\n\nThe big standout from the initial roster is Leon Draisatl, the 20-year-old Oilers centre who took full-advantage of Connor McDavid’s injury to go on an offensive tear and seal his status as an NHL-ready middleman. With only Kopitar engraved as a high-end star pivot for Team Europe, the German may jump from the outside looking in right towards the 2nd line, pushing down the likes of Lars Eller and Zemgus Girgensons, who may be in direct competition for a lower-line role. Meanwhile, instead of Niederreiter, who I pencilled on the fourth-line’s right-wing, Team Europe’s management surprised by nominating Jannik Hansen, whose merits I defended ferociously on the aforementioned post.\n\nVanek and Gaborik were the skilled veterans on the downswing I mulled before my ninth forward indication. While I believed the Slovak’s familiarity with Kopitar made him a near sure thing, his knee injury, compounded with the 34 birthdays, probably scared some and contributed to Vanek’s appointment.\n\nDefenseman (5): Zdeno Chara (Boston Bruins, SVK), Roman Josi (Nashville Predators, SUI), Andrej Sekera (Edmonton Oilers, SVK), Mark Streit (Philadelphia Flyers, SUI), Dennis Seidenberg (Boston Bruins, GER)\n\nI originally only had four defensemen on the preliminary roster, but ultimately believed that Seidenberg’s strong play as of late would erase any doubts that could exist. I was right, and now it’s up to Christian Ehrhoff to find his groove back and validate my original six. I overlooked Vancouver Canucks’ Yannick Weber before, but he’s on the race for the 6th/7th position with compatriot Luca Sbisa.\n\nGoalies (2): Frederik Andersen (Anaheim Ducks, DEN), Jaroslav Halak (NY Islanders, SVK)\n\nAndersen and Halak were absolute locks, but the terrible season of Calgary’s Jonas Hiller blew the door wide open for Thomas Greiss to step in, which will be a mere formality if he can maintain his lead amongst NHL goalies in Sv%.\n\nTeam North America\n\nOut: C Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, LW Boone Jenner\n\nIN: RW JT Miller (NY Rangers), G Matt Murray (Pittsburgh Penguins)\n\nForwards (10): Brandon Saad (Columbus Blue Jackets, USA), Connor McDavid (Edmonton Oilers, CAN), Nathan MacKinnon (Colorado Avalanche, CAN), Johnny Gaudreau (Calgary Flames, USA), Sean Monahan (Calgary Flames, CAN), Sean Couturier (Philadelphia Flyers, CAN), Boone Jenner (Columbus Blue Jackets, CAN), Ryan Nugent – Hopkins (Edmonton Oilers, CAN), Dylan Larkin (Detroit Red Wings, CAN), Jake Eichel (Buffalo Sabres, USA)\n\nI don’t want to spoil my incoming article, but I’m also still unsure where Ryan Nugent-Hopkins fits in the lineup for this team. However, Peter Chiarelli, the Oilers GM, co-picked the roster and it is still complicated to see him discard one of his guys. RNH is currently nursing an injury, which muffles the subject, but Edmonton’s media will create a uproar if the snub is repeated in June.\n\nLike Hansen on Team Europe, I’m a passionate supporter of Boone Jenner’s possible contributions to this squad, yet his name was forgotten this week in favour of JT Miller, who appeared on the radar with a breakthrough season for the Rangers but no one expected to see nominated so early. Although there was definitely a need for a right-winger with speed and decent size on the top nine, my preference went for a more polished offensive player.\n\nChiarelli and Stan Bowman cautioned for the necessity to watch closely the ups-and-downs experienced by rookie players, hence I was reluctant to include Eichel and Larkin on the initial roster, but, in the end, their pedigree and impeccable track record representing the USA at International tournaments pointed me in the right direction.\n\nDefenseman (4): Ryan Murray (Columbus Blue Jackets, CAN), Seth Jones (Columbus Blue Jackets, USA), Aaron Ekblad (Florida Panthers, CAN), Morgan Rielly (Toronto Maple Leafs, CAN)\n\nEkblad, Jones and Reilly comprise the trio of blueliners that will be asked to anchor the Young Guns’ defence, and Murray’s dependability, coupled with a flourishing chemistry with his Columbus’ partner, turned him into a favourite to land on the top 4. Nailing down the last three men will prove more difficult, but I’ll take my crack soon…\n\nGoalies (2): John Gibson (Anaheim Ducks, USA), Connor Hellebuyck (Winnipeg Jets, USA)\n\nTeam North America’s prospects on goal look way more promising now than last summer because all three men selected have exceled this season. Gibson was invited to the NHL All-Star game, and both Hellebuyck and Matt Murray got some games under their belt against the best in the World. The Jets goaltender string more than two dozen starts, and thus held the advantage to be the second name announced, but Murray’s first four presences were so impressive that no more scouting and evaluation was deemed necessary.\n\nTeam Canada\n\nOut: RW Corey Perry, LW Brad Marchand, D Alex Pietrangelo\n\nIN: C Tyler Seguin (Dallas Stars), D Marc-Edouard Vlasic (San Jose Sharks), G Corey Crawford (Chicago Blackhawks)\n\nForwards (10): Sidney Crosby (Pittsburgh Penguins), Jonathan Toews (Chicago Blackhawks), Steven Stamkos (Tampa Bay Lightning), Jamie Benn (Dallas Stars), Corey Perry, Ryan Getzlaf (Anaheim Ducks), Patrice Bergeron, Brad Marchand (Boston Bruins), John Tavares (NY Islanders), Jeff Carter (LA Kings)\n\nCanada’s embarrassment of riches up front produces enough headaches just to trim down the group to 13 forwards, so imagine trying to pick only nine. I saw Crosby, Toews, Benn and Bergeron as locks, and Stamkos and Tavares were right behind alongside Perry, whose duo with Getzlaf is seldom broken. With so many centres in the mix and Perry’s slow start on the rear-view, his absence is head-scratching, but should be corrected in June. Getzlaf’s high standard of play over almost a decade was taken into account, while Jeff Carter was a hunch I was reasonably comfortable with. The LA Kings forward performed strongly at the 2014 Olympics on a depth role, and his speed, versatility, two-way ability and experience have always been greatly appreciated by every Canadian management group.\n\nTyler Seguin was overlooked in 2014 and, despite his outstanding offensive array, I thought they would overthink his selection and leave the decision for later, much in the same way it will happen with Claude Giroux. As for Marchand, his evolution from pest to one of the elite left wingers in the game has been so surprising that I wagered things would just keep going his way “off the ice”. It wasn’t meant to be and he’ll have to keep his hot streak going, because I believe he’s in direct competition with Taylor Hall for a spot.\n\nDefenseman (4): Drew Doughty (LA Kings), Duncan Keith (Chicago Blackhawks), Shea Weber (Nashville Predators), Alex Pietrangelo (St. Louis Blues)\n\nDoughty, Keith and Weber were seen as untouchables on Canada’s defence entering the 2014 Olympics and their importance stands, even if Weber’s slow decline has been well documented and he may no longer be an NHL top pairing D. Pietrangelo carried Jay Bouwmeester, his St. Louis Blues’ partner, to Sochi, and I thought that gave him an inside path, but it seems that Vlasic’s steadfast style caught more admires there. The Shark being a left defenseman, which balances the group of four, was also important on this equation.\n\nRiskier options, like PK Subban, Kris Letang and Brent Burns, all righties, will have to wait a few months, while a third left-handed blueliner should be added, with Calgary’s duo of TJ Brodie and Mark Giordano in the mix.\n\nGoalies (2): Carey Price (Montreal Canadiens), Braden Holtby (Washington Capitals)\n\nThe lack of details regarding Price’s mysterious injury are concerning, but at the end of the day he’s still the best goaltender in the planet, and nothing indicates there’s a chance he won’t be fully prepared to play in September. Holtby is the odds-on Vezina front-runner and the best man to backup the Canadiens’ reigning MVP, while Corey Crawford forced his way into the conversation with a stellar campaign for the Stanley Cup Champions. Even if Roberto Luongo wills the Florida Panthers to an unlikely Championship run, it won’t matter, since the Blackhawks’ goaltender convinced Team Canada’s management that he’s as essential as the other two.\n\nTeam USA\n\nOut: C David Backes, C Brandon Dubinsky\n\nIN: LW Justin Abdelkader (Detroit Red Wings), C Derek Stepan (NY Rangers)\n\nForwards (9): Patrick Kane (Chicago Blackhawks), Joe Pavelski (San Jose Sharks), Blake Wheeler (Winnipeg Jets), Zach Parise (Minnesota Wild), Ryan Kesler (Anaheim Ducks), Max Pacioretty (Montreal Canadiens), David Backes (St. Louis Blues), Brandon Dubinsky (Columbus Blue Jackets), TJ Oshie (Washington Capitals)\n\nTeam USA’s attack also encompassed a few slam-dunks (Kane, Pavelski, Parise) and others almost no one would contemplate to leave out, namely Pacioretty, in spite of being in the middle of a frustrating season in Montreal, and Kesler, whose effectiveness has slipped slightly over the last couple of years. Wheeler, one of the NHL’s most underappreciated offensive dynamos, belongs in that group, and his rise as the second best American right-wing pressed Phil Kessel into a corner where his pure goal-scoring prowess may be left at home, a foolish cogitation not too long ago.\n\nBackes and Dubinsky are just the type of rugged, physical two-way players John Tortorella loves, but I have to disclose that their inclusion on my list had less to do with that, as I didn’t remembered who the coach was, and more with the USA’s usual fascination with that kind of players. Just remember Dustin Brown and Ryan Callahan’s presence in Sochi and the unexpected call up of Justin Abdelkader, whose experience complementing top players in Detroit was brought up as a basis for the selection.\n\nI was unsure about Oshie’s early inclusion until I realized the shootouts will be there once again, while Derek Stepan is a safe choice to provide some centre depth that can chip in regular offense, something the American’s don’t have in spades. To fill out the group, some tough decisions will be made on the wings, where, besides Kessel, stand out the candidacies of James Van Riemsdyk (who may not play another game this season), Bobby Ryan, Kyle Okposo and Chris Kreider.\n\nMeanwhile, Brandon Saad and Johnny Gaudreau would have been shoe-ins on this roster, but will have to settle for Team North America.\n\nDefenseman (4): Ryan Suter (Minnesota Wild), John Carlson (Washington Capitals), Ryan McDonagh (NY Rangers), Dustin Byfuglien (Winnipeg Jets)\n\nSuter, Carlson and McDonagh formed the backbone of the American defence in Sochi and their place was never in doubt. Byfuglien’s impact every time he steps over the boards is so remarkable at both ends of the ice, that he just bullied his way to a spot and no one bat an eye. He’s not yet someone Tortorella will fully trust to defend a lead late, but his cannon shot and strength cannot be ignored like happened in Sochi, when the USA could have used a catalyst of change during the showdown with Canada.\n\nThere’s also a balance between lefties and righties on this top four, and, if five blueliners were appointed, Justin Faulk (Carolina Hurricanes) was the next man up. I’m confident the veteran Paul Martin, still playing top-line minutes in San Jose, won’t be neglected, with the seventh spot turning into a bloodbath for a plethora of names, including Kevin Shattenkirk, Cam Fowler, Erik Johnson, Matt Niskanen, Jake Gardiner, Keith Yandle..\n\nGoalies (3): Cory Schneider (New Jersey Devils), Jonathan Quick (LA Kings), Ben Bishop (Tampa Bay Lightning)\n\nWith so many teams naming three goalies, at least it wasn’t the only one I thought would do it to buck the trend. Quick and Schneider, two goalies that interpret the position in entirely different ways, will continue to push the envelopes for their teams in hopes of securing the starting spot, while Bishop, despite being in the middle of a career-season, departs a step below. Quick, a third-string goalie in Vancouver 2010 and the leading man in Sochi 2014, may get the nod, but Schneider’s numbers are better across the board since he was elevated to top status in New Jersey.\n\nFinal Record: 105/128 ≈ 82%\n\nBeing a sports fan is not only about marvelling at watching the best do their thing. It’s not only about dreaming of reaching their level, trying to imitate them on the court, the rink, the field or a road that seems to never end. It’s also about experiencing the energy of the living organism that is a crowd during an on-going event: gasping, howling, heckling, suffering in anticipation of the worst and, yes, exploding in ecstasy at the sight of the incredible.\n\nTaking all of this in can become an addiction and quickly spun into the search for new sensations, different environments, fresh faces and impulses. Thus, in sport, just like in life, one way you can feed the addiction is to pack your things and travel, explore and discover other spaces and perspectives.\n\nJust to be clear, because the semantics on that paragraph seem to point to some life-altering trip, this is not what we’ll chronicle on this post. Just a slightly exaggerated preamble to indicate that the magic of traveling and the passion for sports go hand-in-hand perfectly, since there’s no better way of expanding your fandom than expressing it wherever your feet land.\n\nAnyway, recently I had the chance to spend eight days on the Czech Republic and manage to stay level-headed enough to be able to recount some things. The timing of the visit coupled with the scheduling of sporting events (blame football’s winter break) dictated that options were limited, so I only ended up attending a couple of ice hockey games. I visited Prague and the quaint university town of Olomouc, and in this article will expose my thoughts on what I saw, felt and perceived on their respective arenas.\n\nAdditionally, even if this isn’t a travel blog, I’ll take the chance to collect some personal remarks about extra-sports aspects of the places I got to know. These two sections will be clearly delimited, should one of them be outside of your interest.\n\nMy first stop was the capital of Central Europe’s hockey hotbed (sorry, Slovakia), so I’ll start there.\n\n*********\n\nHC Sparta Praha – PSG Zlín, Wednesday, 3rd February 2016\n\nThe Tipsport Czech Extraliga is the main ice hockey division in the Czech Republic and ranks fifth in average attendance amongst its European counterparts, after the Swiss, German, Russian (KHL) and Swedish leagues, with a bit over 5000 spectators per match. I took advantage of my stay in Prague to enjoy the battle between Sparta Praha, the home side that was close to clinching a playoff spot and cruising in second place on the league standings, and a Zlín squad desperate for points to approach the sixth and final postseason berth.\n\nStarting this season, the O2 Arena hosts the matches of Sparta’s ice hockey section, since their banner Tipsport Arena, located on the Holesovice district, is in need of significant renovations. Opened in 1962, the former home of Sparta, which hosted the Ice Hockey World Championships on four occasions and could accommodate 13,150 spectators, will be part of a complete makeover underway at Výstaviště, an extensive area with facilities used for concerts, exhibitions and other cultural and leisure activities. Some club services, like the main fan shop and youth team’s activities remain there, but all of the matches take place on Prague’s main venue, the O2 Arena, where more than 17,000 can appreciate the wonders of live hockey.\n\nOpened in 2004, this multi-purpose building is a modern infrastructure that can be reached easily from the Cêskomorávská metro station – on the yellow metro line(line B) – a half dozen stops from the city centre, and without surprise caters to the needs of its visitors, whatever type of spectacle they’re in for. The entrance occurs swiftly despite the presence of metal detectors, the concourses are spacious to accommodate thousands during intermissions, and there’s no shortage of bathrooms, which almost completely eliminates the nuisance of queues. Meanwhile, ample seating capacity at the concessions area was also not forgotten, a must due to the impressive multitude and diversity of food stalls, which supply almost every type of food you could be expected to find on an entertainment venue, including burgers, pizzas, hot dogs and Klobásas (a thick, spicy sausage served accompanied with slices of brown bread), tacos, baguettes, sandwiches, potato pancakes (a Czech favourite), chips…\n\nNevertheless, if the arena had all the comforts necessary, I was there to watch a hockey game and was presented with an entertaining affair between a home side dressed in the classic maroon and white colours and the visitors wearing a yellow and blue outfit. Sparta managed to take the lead on three separate occasions but every time Zlín came back to tie the match, wasting a golden chance to secure the two points late in regulation after a penalty was whistled to their opponents. Then, already in the overtime period (unfortunately, not 3 on 3), the tables turned and Zlín went down two men with a pair of penalties in quick succession, but Sparta couldn’t capitalize on the 5 on 3 despite a crowd standing in anticipation of the game winning goal. The match thus drifted into a deciding shootout, where Sparta scored twice to no response from the 2013-14 Czech Champions, setting the 4-3 final score line.\n\nAs for individual standouts, you couldn’t help but notice the reaction of the audience to the heroics of 25-year-old Miroslav Forman. Sparta’s home-grown C/RW scored the opening goal and also delivered on the shootout’s first attempt with a nice deke, deserving a farewell applause to the tune of a “Miro Formaaan“ call that, more than once, caught me humming for a similarly-named star player from my own football team. No idea if Forman also disappears in big games, though.\n\nMeanwhile, Forman’s goaltender, Tomáš Pöpperle, was also on the spot regularly and not for the best reasons, slowly getting back into position to confront the puck on the first two goals allowed, and always looking shaky managing rebounds. He also fumbled the puck behind the net on an opportunity that didn’t end up costing dearly by miracle. Pöpperle was a 5th round pick of the Columbus Blue Jackets in 2005 and played two NHL games back in 2006-07, but it’s fair to say that he was feeling the pressure provided by the recent acquisition of Danny Taylor, a 28-year-old Canadian goalie that was part of the LA Kings and Calgary Flames organizations and became one of only two non-Europeans on Sparta’s roster.\n\nActually, the great majority of the league’s lineups include only Czech and Slovak players, with “imports” being scarce, a different approach than seen in rival countries like Germany and Switzerland.\n\nStill, Sparta’s roster included a few players with NHL experience, brief in the cases of defenseman Michal Barinka, a former Blackhawks prospect, and Jaroslav Hlinka, who represented the Colorado Avalanche in 2007-08, and more pronounced for 39-year-old Jan Hlavac, who amassed 436 games for 6 NHL teams from 1999 to 2004 and during a second stint in 2007-08.\n\nAs one of the most heralded Czech teams, Sparta Praha has won six national Championships since 1987, when the nation’s league was instituted, and is looking to end a drought of eight seasons in 2015-16, thus their roster includes some interesting players that I wouldn’t be surprised to see moving overseas in the near future. I liked Juraj Mikos, a 27-year-old well-rounded Slovak blueliner that Toronto selected in the 5th round in 2007 and later played three years for the Toronto Marlies, but he’s unlikely to go back. So, I would put my chips on 23-year-old skilled centre Daniel Pribyl, a Montreal Canadiens 6th rounder in 2011 who is clocking at a point-per-game pace (38 in 38 games) in the Czech League, or 25-year-old Jan Buchtele, an undrafted left winger that looked strong on the boards and unafraid to drive to the net, having obtained over 15 goals in three consecutive seasons.\n\nBefore moving on, allow me a few words on the overall atmosphere around the ice. About 7500 spectators showed up to fill the lower bowl of the arena and the atmosphere was animated, with a markedly youthful crowd (Sparta has some type of campaign to deliver a bunch of free tickets for groups of students that apply their schools) providing a colourful vibe. This also extended to the enthusiastic group of organized home supporters, which were standing in close proximity to where I was seated and were relentless in their attempts to drown out the chants and reactions of around two hundred fans that made the trip from the Eastern Moravian town. No ill-advised incitements or provocations were thrown cross-rink and both groups confined themselves to backing up their teams, which made for an enjoyable experience throughout the game.\n\nAlthough the O2 Arena dominates the attentions, for hockey fans the attractions on the area don’t stop there, as the Harfa Shopping Center, located just to the right of the arena, hosts the Czech Hockey Hall of Fame. The space (entrance fee Adult: 140 CZK, ≈5.5€) presents an overview of the origins of the sport in the country, the national team’s main feats and trophies conquered – with evident focus on the Olympic Gold Medal earned in Nagano 1998 – plus the triumphs and contributions of the most successful clubs. It is also replete with memorabilia and multimedia records from the inducted members of the Hall of Fame, including esteemed NHL legends like Jaromír Jágr, Dominik Hašek, Peter Šťastný or Ivan Hlinka. If you have time, you may spend a couple of hours on the exhibition but I would say that most visitors are lured to the fun zone, where you can showcase your skills in shooting*, passing and stickhandling simulators or indulge on a game of air hockey.\n\nLeaving the exhibition, you can also check their small shop, with a decent chunk of NHL merchandise, namely club-themed hats, beanies, water bottles, pucks and a few jerseys, but the choice is a bit limited. So, if you’re after that, head to the centre of Prague and the JB Sport – Hokej Centrum shop (address: Dlážděná 1491/3, 110 00 Praha 1-Nové Město, http://www.jbsport.cz/ ) situated not far from Prague’s main train station. It is a 300m2 paradise for hockey fans in general, and NHL fans looking for jerseys, t-shirts, sweatshirts, hats, among others. And no, they did not sponsor this paragraph.\n\n*Well, if they could provide a right-handed stick fitted for a normal sized person so you can manage to wire the puck decently on the shooting gallery, it would be nice\n\n******\n\nTime for some random considerations regarding the city of Prague, in bullet form:\n\n– I won’t shock anyone by confirming that Prague is as picturesque, charming, full of history and (I suppose) romantic as advertised, but it’s still nice to understand that a stone-throw away from the hordes of visitors, you can find some peaceful alleyways and understated beauties. For instance, just drive off Karlova, the street that connects Staroměstské náměstí (Old Town Square) and Charles Bridge, to explore and get lost on the maize of lanes and crannies littered with restaurants, boutique shops and courtyards the bustle does not touch.\n\n– As you quickly get used when you travel, the most famous tourist attractions can be extremely underwhelming. In Prague, there’s no doubt this flag is waved proudly by the spectacle put in motion every hour at the Astronomical Clock. Literally hundreds – even in the peak of the Winter season – flock to stand in front of the medieval mechanism in order to watch a handful of small figures shake, clink and barely move for what amounts to 90 lost seconds. I mean, the clock is definitely a work of art but the “show” is so trite you just leave befuddled.\n\n– They’re pretty much conspicuous on Prague’s Old Tour but I still had to sneak in a mention of it. Do not miss the chance to taste the sweet Czech pastry by the name of Trdelník you’ll see getting roasted wrapped around sticks over a grill on street stands. This portion of rolled dough topped with cinnamon sugar is absolutely delicious, and so crispy its beehive shape fades perfectly as you eat. You can also have the inside coated with Nutella, jam or caramel to provide the perfect excuse to try it again and again.\n\n– The Old Town Hall Tower and the Žižkov Television Tower can be climbed to experience dramatic overviews of the city, but Prague isn’t short on much more budget-conscious options to observe great panoramas of different districts. The city is defined by several hills and reaching the top won’t cost a penny, with the rewards coming in troves. One example is Petřín Hill, a major recreational area which is adorned by several interesting buildings, including a lookout tower that resembles the Eiffel Tower in Paris. Meanwhile the Letná Park is an extensive green area ideal for a stroll, with his elevation providing great views of the historical area, just across the Vltava River. As for Vítkov Hill, home of the equestrian statue of legendary general Jan Žižka and the imposing National Monument, it is less visited but the view is equally impressive, especially towards the northern neighbourhoods of the city.\n\n– The Žižkov district (Prague 3) is a great option if you’re looking for affordable accommodation, with a wealth of mid-level hotels stationed on the quarter delimited in the north by Husitská/Koněvova street (on the foothill of Vitkov Hill) and in the south by Seifertova. The first road is served by several buses that put you on Florenc’s Metro Station (or even the city center (bus #207)) in five minutes, while Seifertova is connected by a plethora of trams that stop at the main train station and reach Wenceslas Square in less than a dozen of minutes. Additionally, Žižkov hosts a lively nightlife, with Bořivojova street, just off the Lipanská tram station, famous for the multitude of bars and restaurants. However, the atmosphere in the neighbourhood permanently feels calm and safe, even after dark.\n\n*****\n\nSandwiched between two shifts in Prague, I headed to the town of Olomouc, in the Moravia region. As before, first the match “report”:\n\nHC Olomouc – BK Mlada Boleslav, Sunday, 31st of January 2016\n\nMy first hockey game on Czech soil occurred on a rainy afternoon, confronting two teams in direct competition for the fifth position on the standings and trying, at the same time, to create some more breathing room above their desperate pursuers for the last playoff spot. The match was disputed at the Zimní (the Czech word for Winter) Stadion Olomouc, located just north of the city centre, on a zone where we can find a cluster with all the major sporting facilities in town, including a tennis centre, an aquatic centre, several football fields prepared for athletics and, more significantly, Sigma Olomouc’s football stadium, still proudly boasting the decorations left from the 2015 Under-21 UEFA European Championships.\n\nFor this hockey match, 4830 spectators congregated in the creaky arena, built in 1948, a number right in line with last year’s average of 4745, which not only means the stadium is constantly close to the full capacity of 5,500, but also that the extensive lines formed at the only two entrances should be an integral part of the game day experience. The number of seats is around 3800, and few spots were unoccupied, with the same ringing true on the standing section that saw the home club’s “ultras” sing along, jump in unison and proudly stretch their scarfs.\n\nNevertheless, at every intermission, the fans descended into the cramped hallway to mingle and pick up food or beer, which didn’t completely congest the area under the stands because a few opt to just head outside (and I’m pretty sure their re-entrance is in no way controlled). As for the menu available, you’ve surely intuited that it is way more restricted (beer, coffee, klobasa, mulled wine) than at the O2 Arena but, at least, I can attest that my portion of fries (or hranolky, as I hastily discovered after spending a good 45 seconds furiously pointing in an effort to make my order understandable to five pairs of bemused eyes) did the job.\n\nThe packed small venue, totally in favour of the hosts, looked engaged during the entire 60 minutes of a chippy, tight affair, and the mass did their part to encourage their players forward when the opportunity arose, functioning as an extra element and controlling the anxiety on the last minutes while the visitors pressed in search of the tying goal.\n\nThe game had started at lightning speed, with multiple chances for the hosts on the first two minutes, but never delivered on the promise of fireworks. Both teams worked hard to gain the opposing blue lines and keep the puck deep by getting an edge on board battles, but, to put it bluntly, skill didn’t abound. The ice was finally broken by Olomouc midway through the second period, with forward Dávid Buc taking advantage of a defensive lapse, which left him with too much space on the slot to bury a goal line pass past the Mlada Boleslav goaltender. The teams kept trading chances after the 1-0, with the posts entering the equation at times, but not even a frantic late charge from the visitors, which pumped 14 shots on the final period, resulted in more goals, as the home stopper, 26-year-old Tomáš Vošvrda, stood tall to lock two key points for HC Olomouc.\n\nThe 26-year-old Vošvrda was the most prominent man on the ice, pitching a 28-saves shutout and repeatedly denying the efforts of Mlada Boleslav’s first line, which is centred by 41-year-old David Výborný, a veteran who spent seven seasons (2000-08) on the NHL playing in a scoring role (317 points in 543 games) for the expansion Columbus Blue Jackets, and now devotes the heyday of his career to receiving orders from his father and team coach, 62-year-old Frantisek Výborný. Accompanying Výborný in every shift is another former NHLer, albeit one with a less decorated career, RW Jakub Klepis, who represented the Washington Capitals from 2005 to 2007.\n\nThe entire roster of Mlada Boleslav is comprised of Czech players, except for Slovenian Olympic defenseman Mitja Robar, and HC Olomouc’s is not much different, mixing in a few Slovaks on a group that features just one member that can claim to have savoured the best level of competition on the planet. Pavel Skrbek, a 37-year-old defender, was a 2nd round pick of the Pittsburgh Penguins in 1998 before playing a grand total of 12 games with Pittsburgh and Nashville.\n\n**********\n\nThe sixth largest city in the Czech Republic is a bit more than two hours away from Prague by train, is served with direct connections pretty much every hour and can easily function as a jumping point to the region of Moravia, which occupies the South-Eastern part of the country. Brno and Ostrava, the nation’s second and third biggest cities, are 1.5h/1h away should you be craving a more metropolitan feel, but if you’re looking for a town with a large, well-preserved historical centre that has yet to be discovered by most tourists, Olomouc beats the likes of Český Krumlov or the spa town of Karlovy Vary.\n\nAs you leave Olomouc’s train station, several trams connect to the city centre, where you’ll find a wealth of attractions, in a handful of minutes. The main one is the massive Holy Trinity Column looming on the Upper Square (Horní náměstí), a baroque monument that reaches 35m in height and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, but there’s also an Astronomical Clock adorning the Town Hall, which almost rivals the one in Prague in beauty and sees way smaller crowds at the hour mark (conversely, the spectacle doesn’t lag behind either).\n\nAlso popular among visitors is the tour of the plethora of fountains found around the city’s squares, depicting Roman Gods like Jupiter and Neptune, human motifs or mythical figures like Julius Caesar, the legendary founder of Olomouc. The town is distinctly ecclesiastic, with prominent religious buildings like Saint Wenceslas Cathedral or Saint Michael’s Church worth visiting if you’re into that kind of sightseeing.\n\nHowever, there’s another facet of Olomouc that features strongly on its daily life. The Palacký University (Univerzita Palackého v Olomouci, in Czech), the second oldest in the country after being established in the XVI century, brings hordes of outsiders to join the roughly 100,000 inhabitants, whereby during the school semesters one in four residents are students.\n\nThis means that the ambiance is distinctly juvenile and there’s a notable rate of the usual services directly targeted to students, including specific bars, cafes and restaurants. Unfortunately, my visit coincided with the examinations period and between-semesters down season, thus everything seemed to function at half-speed. Nevertheless, many of the different faculties, which are scattered around the urban area, occupy some of the most beautiful buildings on the historical centre, calling for a closer look inside, something facilitated when the fuss of a normal day is absent.\n\nOlomouc has a pleasant, compact city centre that is easily walked or cycled, with large parks on short distance and nature encircling the town, giving way to a Moravian countryside replete with castles, caves, swimming holes and natural reserves. My two days on the city weren’t enough to explore these options, but I definitely noticed that you can walk fifteen minutes from the main square in every direction and probably find yourself away from civilization.\n\nAnother year has gone, which means we can now snoop over a bin full of sports memories to cherish and remember. The turn of the calendar is as good a time as any other, so I decided to empty my brain and select what sports fans will take with them from 2015, including instances when athletes overcame their physical and mental limitations, superstars were born or regained some of the respect lost along the way, history books were re-written, or stunning upsets left fans agape.\n\nThe screening process was, obviously, enormously dictated by my own preferences (read more about it on the “About” page linked above), and the reader will disagree with a lot of my choices, but I tried to instil as much diversity as possible on the final list. I touched base on a variety of sports, even if, naturally, can’t recognize them all, and searched for a balance between individual and team-based achievements (or failures). An assortment of time frames was also pursued, with the action that enveloped the “moment” being reviewed ranging from a matter of few seconds, to entire matches or even week-long struggles.\n\nI wrote about the seven moments of 2015 that left a deeper mark on my memory and – I believe – in that of the many fans which follow the sports world on a daily basis. In addition, I later appointed five more which also stood out among the numerous monitored live throughout the year.\n\n(By the way, absent is any reference to the heroics of a racing horse on some posh trio of events held in the Spring, or a famous defensive play that occurred with forty something seconds to go on a Championship match that enjoys an unparalleled television audience)\n\nSo, without further delay, my breakdown of the main sports moments of the year in no particular order of appearance.\n\nUsain Bolt dodges Justin Gatlin’s challenge\n\nThere’s just no way around it. Every time Usain Bolt steps on the track for a major final, the World stops and waits to be amazed. However, before Beijing’s 2015 World Athletics Championships kicked off, the question marks surrounding the Jamaican were at an all-time high since Bolt was unable to surpass a really average (for his standards) 9.87 seconds showing obtained earlier in the year. He was definitely harassed, listening to the same type of discussion produced in 2011 and 2012, when his compatriot Yohan Blake posed a major threat, and rival Justin Gatlin, enjoying a third chance after two suspensions for doping, had been simply outstanding, putting together a 28 races unbeaten streak highlighted by a time of 9.74 seconds and several 9.8 postings.\n\nOn the Birds Nest, the American further increased is favouritism with a smashing triumph on his semi-final heat while Bolt had to cover ground on the end just to go through. However, with the stakes at the highest point, the pressure proved too much for Gatlin to handle. Bolt exited the blocks better than expected, and kept the rival in check throughout the race to narrowly defeat a stumbling Gatlin, crossing the finish line in 9.79 seconds. The winning margin was just 0.01 seconds, the tighter victory since Bolt broke through, and more than 0.2 ticks off his World Record (9.58).\n\nThe same stadium and city that 7 years ago saw the emergence of a myth wouldn’t see the start of his downfall like many expected, and some days later the 29-year-old doubled down, comfortably sweeping off the speed events with the titles on the 200-meters (with a “normal advantage” over Gatlin) and 4X100 relay. Bolt was ran over by a Segway-ridding cameraman as he was celebrating the double hectometre triumph but, just like during the competition, was able to walk away unscathed.\n\nWe’ll see if he can say the same after the Rio Olympics next year, where he’ll fight for a preposterous triple/double collection of gold medals, looking to cap off his legendary career with a third consecutive Olympic triumph on the 100m and 200m events.\n\nRobert Lewandowski nets five goals in nine minutes\n\nOk, this one is a bit of a cheat, since I wasn’t actually watching the act as it occurred, but following on twitter is close enough, right? A middle-of-the-week league tie, even if contested between the German Champions and the runner-up, can’t be considered appointment viewing, and there was a reason Bayern’s spearhead was on the bench to start the match. However, the half-time disadvantage for the hosts convinced Pep Guardiola that Lewandowski had to go in and the rest is history. Actually, four fresh entries on the Guinness World Records book were added after that night on the Allianz Arena.\n\nThe Polish striker needed just five minutes to tie the contest with an opportunistic tip after a superb assist by (former) teammate Dante, and off he was. Two minutes later, and just five touches on the ball in, a creeping shot from distance gave him a brace, and the hat-trick goal soon followed after he buried an attempt that initially found the post. By this time, social media was already exploding with an incredible achievement on a top-level competition, and no one really understood what was happening after the fourth strike in seven minutes!\n\nThe fifth, exactly 8:59 min after the ball first found the back of the net, came on a marvellous acrobatic volley from just inside the edge of the box, and became the cherry on top of a remarkable moment for the forward and the sport. Certainly, the type of performance for the ages football fans are lucky to watch once in a lifetime, and an impact substitution not even a master like Guardiola will be able to repeat. Eventually, his face on camera told it all.\n\nAs for the poor Wolfsburg side that was on the wrong side of the achievement, well…why did you sign Dante? (Sorry…but not really).\n\nRoberta Vinci shocks Serena Williams at the US Open\n\nMany, if not all, of the events on this list will linger on fans’ minds for a long time, but very few are in the running for the recognition as the greatest upset of all-time on its sport. This one happened because an “undistinguished” 32-year-old Italian decided “to play literally out of her mind” on the biggest stage and moment of them all, and thus spoil part of the legacy of one of the greatest figures in the history of tennis.\n\nSo many superlatives? Yes, it was that relevant, that unexpected and, so, so baffling. Serena Williams had already secured three quarters of a lifetime achievement, the calendar Grand Slam, adding her sixth Australian Open, third Roland Garros and sixth Wimbledon to stand on the verge of becoming the sixth human to manage something last seen in 1988. It seemed like a foregone conclusion that only Serena could stop Serena from lifting the trophy at the end of the fortnight on the Artur Ashe Stadium. Eventually, even the top players that could remotely hang on with her were on the other side of the draw (Muguruza, Kvitova, Azarenka, Halep) and dropping like flies.\n\nThe American was tested by Bethanie Mattek-Sands and her sister on the early rounds, but was never actually close to losing, and absolutely no one believed Roberta Vinci, the No 43 in the World, could go further than every other Grand Slam adversary in 2015. Serena breezed to take hold of the first set with a 6-2 score line and then the astonishing outcome took form. The crafty, experienced, yet Grand Slam semi-final debutant taking the 2nd set? No reason to panic, Serena had been there countless times before.\n\nVinci serving for the match? WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE? Can’t, won’t happen, right?\n\nThe crowd stood in disbelief as the Italian reached the 40-0 lead and the legend eyed the abyss. Serve, cross-court attack, half-volley…Veni, Vidi, Vinci. The unthinkable had materialized. The pressure weighted too much. A career dream was crushed on the finish line. Forever?\n\nVinci would lose the final to compatriot Flavia Pennetta the next day, on another emotional encounter, but the story was Serena’s choke. The 34-year-old undisputed Queen of women’s tennis came oh so close and blew it. She didn’t took the court again for a WTA match in 2015, and, even for someone like her, it’s tough to muster the strength to come back and push for the same feat again. If it happens, it would probably be as remarkable as whatever occurred in New York on that September evening.\n\nKatie Ledecky obliterates the competition at the Swimming World Championships\n\nAn American dominating an edition of Swimming World Championships is far from a unique circumstance. Michael Phelps took five gold medals from the 2009 meet in Rome and Ryan Lochte equalled the feat in Shanghai 2011, while Missy Franklin stepped it up a notch in Barcelona 2013, gathering six titles. Thus, Katie Ledecky’s performance in Kazan, Russia, last August might be a bit undervalued. Don’t be fooled though.\n\nNone of her compatriots had to swim as much as the 18-year-old freestyler on a frenetic week of competitions. No less than 6.2 km, 124 laps, and 63 minutes of racing as she navigated the heats, semi-finals, and finals of four individual events, including the gruelling 800m and 1500m, with the final of the last race, the longest on the calendar, preceding by just 20 minutes a close, highly-competitive 200m semi-final.\n\nThe Washington DC native kicked off her campaign with the triumph on the 400 meters, with a 3.89-seconds advantage never seen before, but was just getting started, showing clear signs of disappointment at the end after missing out on breaking the World Record. Lauren Boyle, the runner-up on the 1500m, touched the wall almost 15(!) seconds after Ledecky set her second World Record on consecutive days at the distance, and she also smashed the 800m mark by 3.61 seconds and her competitors to the tune of a 10-second gap. Because savouring triumphs on longer events is getting boring, Ledecky has added the 200 meters to her repertoire, and she was also successful despite all the miles on her body, gathering the speed to beat the last two world champions on the race. She, thereby, finished up a sweep of the 200, 400, 800 and 15000 meters free events, or the now called “Ledecky Slam”. Amid all this, anchoring the USA’s 4×200 meters relay win was just icing on the cake.\n\nThe four individual gold medals represent a unique feat for a female swimmer on the history of the World Championships, and only trail Phelps’ record of five in Montreal 2007. Back in 2012, Ledecky caught the World by surprise winning London’s 800m as a 15-year-old, and the youngest member of the entire US Olympic squad composed of more than 500 athletes. In 2016, she may well be the singular face of the entire Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games.\n\nCarly Lloyd erupts to take down Japan in 16 minutes\n\nWith no FIFA men’s international competition on the calendar in 2015, football’s brightest eyeballs shifted attention to the Women’s World Cup. Another stepping-stone tournament for the sport on the female side saw the USA and Japan clash for the third consecutive time in major competitions’ finals, four years after a dramatic World Cup final in Frankfurt, and three following Wembley’s Olympic decider. On the BC Place of Vancouver, the story ended up being way different from 2011, when the four goals were scored on the latter half of regulation and overtime, before the penalty shootout separated the parts.\n\nThis time, inside just 16-minutes, the heavily-supported Americans were well on their way to victory after mounting a four-goal blitz that stunned the reigning Champions. Carly Lloyd deflected in a low corner three minutes into the game, and one hundred seconds later found the ball inside the box to chip it past the Japanese goalkeeper for the second time. With the Nadeshiko dazed, Lauren Holiday took advantage of a terrible clear on the 14th minute to dash with an over the top, classy finish, while Lloyd completed the hat-trick with an astonishing strike from the halfway line that beat a reeling Kaihori. Things slowed down a bit after that, with the final result settled at 5-2 because a brave Japanese team never gave up on the match, but the day undoubtedly belonged to the Americans and to Lloyd.\n\nThe USA’s #10 midfielder propelled his side to a magnificent start, one rarely watched before at this level of competition, and completely decimated the opposition, leaving her mark on a major final like she had done in the 2008 and 2012 Olympics. Her inspired performance throughout the tournament merited the Golden Ball for best player of the tournament, and she will surely welcome another individual accolade in a few days, the FIFA Women’s Player of the Year award.\n\nFabio Aru and the improbable Tom Dumoulin go head-to-head at the Vuelta\n\nSelecting just a moment from a whole cycling season comprised of numerous races can be a monumental task. Others may answer with Alberto Contador’s epic recovery on the Mortirollo ascent during the Giro, Chris Froome’s irresistible (and much discussed) attack on the climb to La Pierre Saint Martin during the 10th stage of his second Tour de France triumph, or even Peter Sagan’s coup d’état, with the Slovak finally getting the best of an entire peloton to punch a signature victory on the World Championships.\n\nHowever, I believe no other battle symbolized what cycling racing is about like the up-and-down affair between Fabio Aru and Tom Dumoulin at the Vuelta, which culminated on the Dutch clinging to the dream until the last day, only to see it vanish through the fingers. The Giant-Alpecin rider was the talk of the first half of the competition alongside Colombian Esteban Chavez, with the pair alternating the ownership of the red jersey while in discussion of the plethora of stages culminating on steep terrain, but not many predicted the 25-year-old could keep up with the best as the difficulties accumulated. Not even after a superb victory over Froome at the end of stage nine.\n\nDumoulin would lose ground on a diabolic stage 11 at the Pyrenees, but his feverish fighting spirit provided for terrific moments of cycling as he almost strapped himself to the Vuelta GC contenders over the next few days on the mountains, managing to stay within striking distance while all his teammates lagged way behind unable to support him. Fabio Aru would command the race lead until Dumoulin shattered the opposition on the individual time trial at Burgos, turning the overall classification into a 3-second stranglehold between Dutch and Italian.\n\nDespite Astana’s push over the next two days, Dumoulin resisted stoically, even showing his muscles on the cobbled end at Ávila, before finally succumbing in dramatic fashion on stage 20, at the Puerto de la Moncuera, as Aru and friends were getting antsy and frustrated. The Maastricht-native, on his own, completely empty and defeated, sank further on the final kilometres to finish the Vuelta in sixth, but the fortitude and drive he displayed by leaving it all on the road against the odds impressed every observer. And were well worth of a reference here.\n\nStan Wawrinka ends Novak Djokovic’s Roland Garros bid\n\nA truly significant season for tennis saw two players end the year with three Grand Slam titles on their bags, and it could have been even more incredible had Novak Djokovic joined Serena Williams on the quest to complete the calendar Slam at the US Open. He couldn’t because the only stain on a brilliant 2015 season came in June, at the final of the only big tournament that still eludes the Serbian.\n\nThe 27-year-old entered the Court Phillipe Cartier still riding the wave of a drubbing over Rafael Nadal on the quarter-finals, only the second time (and first when healthy) that the King of Clay got beaten at Roland Garros, but also feeling the effects of a nervous five-setter against Andy Murray on the semi-finals. A match where the pressure of clinching the trophy that is missing on his curriculum started opening some cracks on the armour.\n\nStan Wawrinka came out ahead of Novakj Djokovic at Roland Garros\n\nLike happened to Roger Federer until 2009 – and to other tennis greats that never grasped success at the French Open – Djokovic may have shrunk with the tension and indomitable desire to win he had to cope with, but the final was much more than a favourite throwing out a golden opportunity. Stan Wawrinka had already backed up his candidacy to a second Grand Slam title with a straight sets victory over Federer, and was completely “in the zone” on that afternoon, unleashing his patented one-handed backhand with devastating precision left and right after “Nole” took the inaugural set.\n\nDjokovic had to settle for the finalist’s plaque and a deserved rising ovation from the crowd after a crushing defeat, but snapped out of it pretty quickly. Wimbledon and the US Open would later join his other nine titles amassed in 2015, and that loss to the Swiss was the only in 28 matches at Majors and one of just six during the best season of the Serbian’s career. The setback in Paris just fuelled his hunger for more, and he figures to come back in 2016 even more prepared to complete his own career Slam and equal Nadal and Federer, his contemporaries that figure on a shortlist of just seven names.\n\nAnd, on a quicker sequence, five more moments that just missed the main cut:\n\nLionel Messi gets back to marvelling the world\n\nFootball fans around the world blessed 2014-15 for the return of the best Lionel Messi. The Argentinian wizard used the motivation after a crushing World Cup Final defeat to power Barcelona to a second treble in four seasons, as the Blaugrana hoarded the Spanish League, the Spanish Cup and the Champions League. Messi’s brilliance was at its peak on two key moments.\n\nFirst, on a monumental goal against Bayern Munich on the 1st leg of the European Cup semi-final, turning Jerome Boateng into a bowling pin before chipping the ball beautifully over Manuel Neuer. A few weeks later, he embarrassed Athletic Bilbao’s defence on the Copa Del Rey decider with a preposterous slalom which started near the convergence of the sideline and center circle and ended with him slotting the ball home.\n\nThe Ski Flying World Record falls twice on a weekend\n\nHumanity’s enduring fascination with flying finds resonance on ski jumping and especially its more risky offshoot, ski flying, where athletes really push the limits of audacity. 2015 brought the first jump over the 250 meters barrier, as Peter Prevc flew exactly that in February, 14th, during a World Cup event held in Vikersund, Norway.\n\nThe Slovenian broke by 4 meters the mark set on the same venue, in 2011, by Norwegian Johan Remen Evensen, but his reign would be really short. To the delight of the home crowd, Norway’s Anders Fannemel soared 251.5 meters the following evening under perfect conditions and stole the record back. The next few years promise new heights, since Vikersund and the “rival” infrastructure in Planica, Slovenia, have suffered renovations and extensions, so expect more superlative images of sportsman gliding on air for what appears like an eternity. After all, the 300m may be just around the corner.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors complete a fairytale season with first NBA title in 40 years\n\nThe gang of Stephen Curry had shown flashes of domination in years past, but only after Steve Kerr took over the bench everything clicked into perfection. The Golden State Warriors won 67 games on the NBA Regular Season led by an unique sharpshooter enjoying an MVP-worthy performance, an incredible sidekick (or should I say Splash Brother?) in Klay Thompson, and Mr. Everything Draymond Green, and then weaved through the minefield that are the Western Conference playoffs to reach the NBA Finals.\n\nAgainst LeBron James’ Cleveland Cavaliers, the most exciting team in basketball conquered the ultimate prize in six fascinating games, undoubtedly benefitting from an opponent that was weakened by substantial injuries to star actors, and had to place too much of a burden on the planet’s best player over the last decade. Nevertheless, with or without the injury bug, no team lighted out arenas all over North America throughout the season like the Warriors, and the series may well be reminisced before long by the passing of the torch from James to Curry as the world’s finest player.\n\nJapan stuns South Africa at the Rugby World Cup\n\nEngland welcomed what can probably be considered the biggest sports competition of 2015, and beyond the hosts’ lacklustre performance, and New Zealand’s uncontested supremacy towards reclaiming the spot at the top of the mountain, there was time for a completely unexpected result. Rugby’s history places the sport amongst those where the minnows stand lower changes of humbling the giants, whereby Japan’s courage and faith belied the norm and they were deservedly rewarded for it.\n\nOn that afternoon at Brighton, the “Brave Blossoms” did justice to their name, deciding to press for the winning try as the final whistle approached instead of settling for a potential equalising kick. The Springboks had already sweated way beyond their expectations to conjure a narrow lead, were left to crawl in order to protect it, but they probably never realized a team with only one World Cup triumph could pull off the tournament’s greatest shock ever.\n\nThat is, obviously, until New Zealand-born Karne Hesketh finalised the 34-32 score in injury time, with what looked like a bunch of folks helping launch him forward so the ball could touch South Africa’s area. It was goosebumps-inducing stuff. In 2019, at home, can Japan do an encore, please?\n\nJamie Benn clinches NHL’s Art Ross Trophy at the buzzer\n\nYou really thought I would go away without a hockey reference? At the end of 2014, I had two moments lined up for the “would be” review list of the year, but this season was leaner in worthwhile memories. The Chicago Blackhawks collecting a third Stanley Cup in six seasons was kind of boring (for neutral fans), and the playoffs lacked striking scenes, even if the Hawks and Ducks on the West, and the Rangers and Caps on the East, weren’t far from the level of excitement provided by that Hawks-LA Kings matchup of a year ago.\n\nThus, my choice was the theatrical and improbable late charge that delivered Dallas Stars’ captain Jamie Benn his scoring title. With his team out of the playoff race, he put up 15 points in the last 6 games to leap John Tavares on the 82th and final contest, grabbing 4 points, including an assist with just 8.5 seconds remaining, to reach 87 on the season. On a game with no implications table-wise, the buzz, voltage and elation on the American Airline Center, as time ticked away and the team pushed for the tally that Cody Eakin ultimately delivered, made for a stunning sports instant that few won’t relish.\n\n***********\n\nAnd that’s all I have for you from 2015. Thanks for reading, and let’s hope for even better in 2016!\n\nThe World Cup of Hockey will return in September of 2016 (17th to 1st October), with a tournament held in Toronto, and the NHL’s footprint made for some puzzling decisions regarding the format. None was more discussed than the idea of ditching the invitation for two teams to join the six hockey powerhouses (Canada, USA, Russia, Sweden, Finland and the Czech Republic) and, instead, congregate two makeshift rosters to complete the field of eight required to fulfill the two preliminary groups of four.\n\nOne of those will be an under-23 (on October 1st of 2016) team composed of the best North American youngsters playing in the League, and the other a mix of Europe’s talents born outside of the four nations previous referenced. Even if the effort to showcase more NHL talent is understandable, the outcry from countries like Slovakia (usually included on hockey’s seven traditional hotbeds) and Switzerland (that has seen the sport develop immensely both at the club and national team level) was immense and players were candid demonstrating their dissatisfaction. The final roster will likely be made up of players from Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland, Austria, Norway, Denmark, Germany, Latvia, Belarus, and maybe even France, and that creates problems for a group that has to come together in a month, build chemistry, integrate a melting pot of personalities and embrace the moniker of underdog. Plus, it’s still up in the air how to solve some simple elements of a group that congregates to compete against other nations, such as the flag and crest they’ll fight under, or the anthem heard after a triumph. In short words, the identity behind what can be considered a collection of misfits.\n\nThe man responsible for selecting Team Europe is former NHLer and Slovakia’s captain Miroslav Satan, while the coach will be Ralph Krueger, who coached the Edmonton Oilers in 2013-14, but has mostly been successful in Europe, leading Switzerland in 12 World Championships (1998-2009) and three Olympics (2002, 2006 and 2010). The 23-man roster may include three goalies and, predictably, thirteen forwards and seven defensemen, whereas the first 16 members have to be names until March 1st, and the entire squad announced no later than June 1st.\n\nThis article aims to predict the members of Team Europe’s roster and take a wild guess on the composition of the forward lines and defensive pairings we should expect entering the tournament and the encounter with the USA on opening day. I only included NHL-based players since the event is a joint effort by the NHL and the NHLPA, and it is on the best interest of these organizations that the number of NHL players be maximized. Plus, I don’t have enough knowledge about the players that ply their trade on the European Leagues to stack their merits against the NHL competition.\n\nTo forecast the composition of the different lines, I tried to follow some simple guidelines that should be important for a group that will have a short window to gel and gain cohesiveness. Familiarity at the club level or in previous competitions for their nations, complementarity of styles (as subjective as the prediction of chemistry can be), and the need to balance the talent across the lineup were taken into account, with an effort to arrange four forward lines that can guarantee a solid two-way game and provide an offensive push. The NHL game today is about rolling four lines effectively and Team Europe will have to follow the same pattern, since it won’t be able to match the offensive fireworks we can expect from some of their opponents.\n\nOn the backend, the need for a consistent top four configures a feature of top-level teams and that was also a concern evaluating a prospective Team Europe’s lineup. I also took a look at the goaltenders and, for every position, appointed some reserve players that missed the cut and would be on verge of making the roster should the injury bug strike.\n\nForwards\n\nThomas Vanek (Minnesota, AUT) – Anze Kopitar (LA Kings, SLO) – Marian Gaborik (LA Kings, SVK)\n\nOn paper, a really potent top line…if we were in 2010.\n\nTeam Europe’s top center is probably the reason this team exists in the first place. Anze Kopitar’s Slovenia qualified for the 2014 Olympic tournament but that’s far from a regular participation and, thus, the Kings star is removed from competing with the best players in the world at the International stage. For this roster he’s a key player, the prototypical first line pivot that can matchup against any other sent to the ice, and the only complete scoring presence up the middle they can trust to put points on the scoreboard.\n\nThe 28-year-old has had, at least, 60 points in every NHL season but he covers many more fundamental facets of the game, being a strong penalty killer with a history of offensive prowess (9 SHG), a solid faceoff man (53.3% wins since 2011), and an elite two-way forward, expressed on a Selke nomination in 2014.\n\nOn the right side of Kopitar, the natural fit is his regular running mate in Los Angeles, Slovakian Marian Gaborik. At the age of 33, the winger has lost some of his trademark speed, and is already very far from the dynamic scorer that shined in Minnesota and New York, with his offensive production and shot rates tumbling over the last few seasons. Still, the three-time 40-goal scorer has shown that he can regain some of his magic in short spurts, like in the 2014 Stanley Cup playoffs he led with 14 goals, and his talent can be a difference-maker for Team Europe.\n\nGaborik has flanked the top line at international competitions with one famous compatriot filling the other side but, this time, I believe that it’s for the best if Marian Hossa shores up the second line. Thus, another veteran NHL forward, Austria’s Thomas Vanek strides in. The 31-year-old is another player that is already over the hill and he certainly won’t improve the foot speed of this line, but his contributes can be valuable. His large frame and soft hands bring memories of more than 300 NHL goals, including ten-consecutive 20-goal seasons, and a lot of success with the man advantage, where he has accumulated approximately one-third of his offensive numbers.\n\nStill, I wouldn’t be surprised if, by next fall, he is way below on the depth chart and maybe even out of the regular rotation.\n\nTomas Tatar (Detroit, SVK) – Zemgus Girgensons (Buffalo, LAT) – Marian Hossa (Chicago, SVK)\n\nA couple of Slovak wingers with an eleven-year difference headline the second line.\n\n24-year-old Tomas Tatar is just starting to come into his own at the NHL level and his 29 goals last year were flashes of a player that the Detroit Red Wings envision as a perennial 30-goal scorer moving forward. He’s probably Slovakia’s best hope to lead the transition after the likes of Gaborik, Chara and Marian Hossa retire, and the Red Wings would be thrilled if he comes remotely close to the career put on by his countryman.\n\nHowever, for now, Tatar should benefit from another competition sharing the ice with the 37-year-old winger. Marian Hossa will probably say goodbye to international audiences very soon, but not without gracing the ice once again as one of the most accomplished players of his generation. A clutch performer, with 144 points amassed during the playoffs, 25 points in 15 games over three Olympic Games, and close to 500 NHL goals, Hossa’s numbers represent a brilliant and somewhat underappreciated career of an elite two-way presence that still displays the wheels to hang on with youngsters like Tatar.\n\nBetween the pair, Team Europe could ice the highest drafted Latvian player ever, Buffalo’s Zemgus Girgensons, a bonafide NHL All-Star, as evidenced last year. Ok…not really but, at least, Team Europe would certainly have the support of the rabid Latvian fans.\n\nJokes aside, the 21-year-old center is big (6’2, 203 pounds), physical and can generate offense flashing some power moves and using a wicked wrist shot. His development hasn’t been helped by the Sabres putrid roster over the last few seasons, but he could use the World Cup to improve his profile. Girgensons is also an effective two-way force and thus, slotting him with Hossa and Tatar, may give Team Europe a highly effective all-around line.\n\nMikkel Boedker (Arizona, DEN)–Lars Eller (Montreal, DEN) – Mats Zuccarello (NY Rangers, NOR)\n\nAnother line built on a pair of countryman that have performed together at previous international competitions.\n\nTeam Europe’s strength down the middle is suspect but you could do worse than the 26-year-old Danish on your third line. The versatile center can play on a checking line, like he’s usually deployed in Montreal, but he can also step up to a more prominent scoring role or move to the wing, taking a page out of Michel Therrien’s decision to start him this season on Alex Galchenyuk’s left side. Furthermore, Eller is a consistent two-way presence but to produce offense he will need to be flanked by skilled wingers, and that’s exactly what we’re looking at.\n\nOn the left, fellow Danish Mikkel Boedker is an underrated player that doesn’t get the recognition he deserves as one of the few flamboyant offensive talents the Arizona Coyotes have carried recently. The 25-year-old, who collected a career-high 51 points in 2013-14, is extremely fast, boasts some size and he’s especially dangerous on the PP, with his creativity and ability to play the point. A RW on the junior leagues, Boedker can easily shift to the left to make room for another crafty winger, New York Rangers’ Mats Zuccarello.\n\nThe 28-year-old Norwegian “hobbit” is way past the early concerns about his lack of size and strength, having become a go-to scorer for his team, which felt his absence deeply at last year’s Stanley Cup playoffs. Zuccarello had 59 points in 2013-14, and uses his left shot to manufacture offense from the right side of the ice, excelling with his vision and passing aptitude, attributes that should click well with his line mates, especially if Boedker finally realizes that he needs to shoot more and explore his great release.\n\nJannik Hansen (Vancouver, DEN) – Frans Nielsen (NY Islanders, DEN) – Nino Niederreiter (Minnesota, SUI)\n\nFrans Nielsen would probably fit nicely on a line with his compatriots, but with the amount of depth other teams can throw on the ice, it’s important for Team Europe to present an experienced pivot on the fourth line. The 31-year-old is another recognizable two-way force and, even more than Eller, a player that, earlier in his career, was expected to put points on the board for a starved NY Islanders’ squad. The team’s improvement shuffled Nielsen down the lineup and he’s adjust to the role seamlessly, ghosting the oppositions’ best players and chipping in offensively. After all, he’s shown that he can score regularly, as occurred in 2013-14 when he posted 25G and 58 points.\n\nThe Danish is also a shorthanded threat, with 13 goals amassed in those situations over his NHL stay, and he may well form a fearsome pair in that situation with another Denmark-born forward. Vancouver Canucks’ Jannik Hansen may be a surprise inclusion on this roster, but the 8-year veteran has made a career as a PK specialist and shutdown forward for the 2011 Stanley Cup finalists, and his tremendous speed is an asset on the forecheck. Hansen is smart and versatile, can play either wing, and has also been called up to contribute on every line for the Canucks, including stints with the Sedin twins.\n\nTo provide an offensive pop to this line, the right side could use a big, skilled winger with a shooting mentality, and those are Nino Niederreiter’s main predicates. The highest-drafted Swiss player (5th, 2010) endured two frustrating seasons for the NY Islanders right after being selected, but the 2013 trade to Minnesota did wonders for his development. He learned how to use effectively his 6’2’’ frame, got consistent minutes with talented teammates, and flourished into the goal-scoring winger he was supposed to be, potting 24 goals in 2014-15. Just 23 years-old, he may be a wild card on this team, capable of climbing the ladder as the tournament progresses.\n\nTo round out the 13-men forward unit, I have two candidates:\n\nMikhail Grabovski (NY Islanders, BLR) / Nikolaj Ehlers (Winnipeg, DEN)\n\nCommon sense dictates that the center spot is essential, and entering the tournament with just four options for the position, since none of the proposed wingers has experience playing there, could prove problematic. Thus, the extra middleman may be a dependable veteran that could suit any role, and 31-year-old Mikhail Grabovski fits the mould, having accumulated experience since joining the Montreal Canadiens in 2008. A creative center that has been able to post offensive numbers despite limited attacking roles, the Belarussian has also acquired some experience on the left side for the New York Islanders.\n\nHowever, just because I’m having a hard time leaving him outside, and it’s more than probable one of the 13 man listed above misses the tournament, the last player to make this roster should be a kid with the type of game-breaking talent Team Europe doesn’t have in spades.\n\n19-year-old Nikolaj Ehlers has a lot to learn, but he’ll reach the World Cup with an NHL season under his belt after developing on the shadow of other scorers in Winnipeg, and his tantalising talent is just too exciting to leave out. An explosive skater with silky hands and the ability to play either side, Ehlers seems tailor-made to slot as a youngster destined to force Krueger’s hand into regular duty. Hell, I wouldn’t be surprised to see him operating Kopitar’s wing on the first day of the tournament…\n\nReserves\n\nUnfortunately, the time when teams were allowed to carry a “taxi squad” is gone, but injuries always happen, so let’s get a sense of some possible reserves for Team Europe.\n\nShould a middleman go down, Germany’s Leon Draisatl should slip in. The rangy playmaker has often been compared to Anze Kopitar but, right now, he’s just too much of an unknown quantity at the NHL level to pencil in without any doubt. However, his raw offensive skills are way above any other pivot on the team except for the Slovenian. Another German, Arizona’s Tobias Rieder, is also on the radar, with the winger cracking a top-six role for the Coyotes. Marko Dano, the Blackhawks’ much-heralded prospect, has the versatility to play center or wing, and could add speed and skill, while France’s Antoine Roussel is a valid option if the management staff decides the roster could use a pest with a crash-and-bang approach. Austria’s Michael Grabner has speed to burn and is an ace penalty killer, but injuries have hampered his ability to match the 34 goals reached as a rookie in 2010-11. However, in 2014, he tied for the Olympic tournament lead with 5 goals, so don’t discount him just yet.\n\nGroup overview:\n\nTeam Europe’s most famous forwards (Hossa, Vanek, Gaborik) have already seen their best days, which means some of the secondary elements, like Tatar, Boedker, Zuccarello and Niederreiter, will have to shine in order for this team to be competitive. On the positive side, there’s no shortage of defensively responsible players on the offensive mix, including down the middle of the ice. This group won’t be an offensive juggernaut but they have the means to slow down the heavyweights.\n\n(Continues on the next post)\n\nOne month has passed since the Chicago Blackhawks lifted the Stanley Cup for the third time in six seasons and, during that time, the landscape of the league suffered important transformations, with two of the most talked-about prospects in a number of years finding their new homes, several unrestricted free agents changing addresses, and a few huge trades shipping elite players out of their misery.\n\nThis article started as a draft day impression’s notebook and grew up into a list of takeaways/thoughts/recollections about an NHL offseason that will now inevitably slow down into the dog days of summer. As such, pretty much every team in the league is cited, with a couple relegated to the end. As I projected to do this on a bullet-points structure, I ended up deciding to numerate them just so I could…well, find a title for the article.\n\nTo facilitate the search through all this, I highlighted the name of the team mainly featured in every part. Here we go:\n\n1. The Buffalo Sabres and GM Tim Murray had an absolutely terrific draft weekend. They knew they were getting their hands on Jack Eichel, the best consolation prize since Evgeni Malkin and a sure-fire franchise center, but adding a player of Ryan O’Reilly’s calibre was a major coup. The 24-year-old has already six seasons of NHL experience and he’s just what they needed to insulate Eichel during his first season, slotting as a second line center in the future: a solid faceoff man (53.4% in 2014-15) used to be deployed in defensive situations, a top penalty killer, and a two-way force with some scoring touch (28 goals in 2013-14). About to become a UFA in 2016, O’Reilly inked a massive 7 years/52.5M deal a few days later with the Sabres, a cap hit that surprised most fans but which won’t look that high when names like Anze Kopitar and Steven Stamkos agree to new extensions. The 2009 2nd round pick has proven capable of handling first line assignments during his time with the Avs and that will be his job for now, even if in the future he may need to move to the wing. Also, with that value hanging over his head and an expanded leadership role, maybe he’ll get more respect from Selke voters that sometimes undervalued his importance.\n\nWith Zemgus Girgensons and 2014 2nd overall pick Sam Reinhart primed to stick with the big club this time, the Sabres are set up the middle for a long time, and may even contemplate the idea of parting with Reinhart if they can acquire a stud young defenseman. Girgensons has the talent to be an answer on that third line slot and I’m not sold on Reinhart becoming a major scorer on the NHL with his lack of a distinctive skill. He’s a finesse, playmaking center with good vision, passing and poise but lacks dynamic skating skills and may struggle to adjust to the higher tempo of the NHL.\n\nThe price for O’Reilly was steep (31st overall pick, forwards Mikhail Grigorenko and JT Compher and D Nikita Zadorov) and the inclusion of the hulking Russian defenseman hurts, but the team has Rasmus Ristolainen to help cover the void and Jake McCabe, a 2nd round pick in 2012, ready to step on the line-up.\n\nEarlier in draft day, Murray also got a new starting goalie, the talented 24-year-old Robin Lehner, who never took advantage of the chances to claim Ottawa’s net. The Swede, barring another acquisition for the net, will have ample opportunities on the Sabres and must pan out to merit the 21st pick sent back to the Sens for him and veteran David Legwand.\n\n2. Joe Sakic and Patrick Roy finally ceded on keeping the clearly disgruntled O’Reilly and managed to secure an interesting haul. Getting a young top-four D in return was crucial and Zadorov has every tool to fill that need on the near future, possessing size, skating, a strong shot and some bite. Grigorenko had his development completely mismanaged by the Sabres, but the Avs are banking on nurturing a player that was considered a top 5 talent entering the 2012 draft, while Compher may someday amount to an energetic third liner that can add some scoring. Flipping the 31st pick to SJ for the 39th and getting back the 2nd rounder next season was also a smart move by the Colorado Avalanche, although signing Carl Soderberg to a 5 years/23.75M deal doesn’t seem like the best idea for a 29-year-old center with a defined offensive edge that is destined for nothing more than a third line role.\n\nWinger Blake Comeau joined in at the start of free agency, agreeing to a 3-year-deal that improves the team depth on the offense, but the team’s other addiction was more controversial. Francois Beauchemin will help a sub-par backline but 3-years and 13.5M are way too rich for a declining 35-year-old defenseman, even more because they’ll need to extend Nathan MacKinnon, Tyson Barrie and Zadorov in the summer of 2016.\n\nWith the 10th overall pick the Avs selected Mikko Rantanen, a Finnish winger that shined at this year’s World Juniors and already has almost two complete seasons under his belt playing against professional players. As a big, supremely skilled right winger, Rantanen will provide balance to a talented and young forward group that will continue to lead the Avalanche going forward, joining, in short term, either Matt Duchene or Nathan MacKinnon on the team’s top two lines.\n\n3. With Brendan Shanahan at the top and Mike Babcock on the bench, a new era of accountability and intelligence choices seems to have arrived for the Toronto Maple Leafs, and the draft was a perfect example of that. Indeed, Kyle Dubas, the Leafs assistant GM in office, gave a lesson of asset management to the previous occupants of the GM position. After selecting the super-skilled but undersized Mitch Marner with the fourth pick, an hometown boy no less, Dubas traded down twice at the end of the first round to add more picks and prospects to the organization. First, the #24 was sent to Philadelphia for the #29 and a supplementary 2nd round pick (#61), and then he flipped #29 for the 34th and 68th picks. With these three assets, Dubas proceeded to stock his pipeline with skilled players, with D Travis Dermott and FW Jeremy Bracco, who beat Patrick Kane’s US NTDP assist record during the season, deserving approving reviews from draft experts.\n\nWith chief amateur scout Mark Hunter driving the bus, the Leafs kept picking up speed and skill through the latter rounds, a welcome difference from the years of searching and valuing “pugnacity, testosterone, truculence and belligerence” above all. To cap it, the Leafs also added 23-year-old defenseman Martin Marincin, a former 2nd round pick that lost space on the Edmonton Oilers system but has already played in 85 NHL games. Marincin is a lanky, mobile blueliner that can add more snarl to his game, but possesses some offensive skills that the Leafs can develop into a middle-pair performer. His promise is certainly worth of a fourth round pick plus a low-level prospect like Brad Ross, a relic of the past after being selected in the 2nd round in 2010 for his hard-nosed style and agitating qualities.\n\n4. The chaotic situation at the draft floor wasn’t ideal to offload the top-earning players on the Leafs roster but, a few days later, the Leafs brass pulled the gun on the biggest blockbuster of the summer, flipping Phil Kessel for more assets. Thus, the mercurial goal scorer was sent to the Pittsburgh Penguins for the talented 19-year-old Kasperi Kapanen, a character, stay-at-home promising defenseman in Scott Harrington, a first and third round picks plus some throw-ins from both sides, comprising a return that failed to impress Toronto’s avid press. However, with the Leafs clearly in rebuild and intent on clearing money from the books, Kessel’s steep cap hit, and lack of other interested suitors, Dubas and Shanahan had to settle for a deal with a Penguins team desperate to add a star player. Retaining 15% of his salary might be a better option than absorbing Rob Scuderi’s contract until 2017, and giving back a 2nd round pick was not in the plans, but the most important thing was achieved: shaking the losing core that sunk the ship throughout the second half of last season.\n\nAfter solving this situation, Toronto was back to promoting indisputably smart decisions, filling out his roster with several cheap, undervalued, short-term contracts that can be used to acquire more assets down the line, including PA Parenteau for 1.5M, Mark Arcobello for 1.1M and Daniel Winnik for 5.5M over two years. Shawn Matthias at 2.3M, though, was the best of the lot, with the 27-year-old versatile forward primed to build on a great second half of 2014-15 by playing top-six minutes. RFA Nazem Kadri signed a one-year, “show-me” deal and will have ample opportunities to prove himself now that Tyler Bozak’s buddy is not around anymore, while starting goalie Jonathan Bernier has yet to agree to terms with the team.\n\n5. With the addition of a stud blueliner like Noah Hanifin with the fifth pick, the Carolina Hurricanes now have three former top 12 picks in the draft on their defensive cupboard, joining offensive-minded Ryan Murphy and Hayden Fleury, last year’s seventh pick. Ron Francis seems to be building the foundation of his team from the backend, slotting pieces around 23-year-old Justin Faulk, an established all-star calibre rearguard.\n\nHowever, to buy time for their jewel’s development, Francis managed to improve his defence for now by trading for James Wisniewski, the Ducks’ pricy trade deadline acquisition that saw the entire playoffs from the press box but will have ample opportunities to regain his mojo in Carolina, probably running the first powerplay unit. Moving Anton Khudobin for Wisniewski to make space for Eddie Lack is a lateral move on the net in terms of quality, although the Swede makes less than half in relation to the Russian netminder, always an important factor on a budget team. The former Canucks’ goaltender has one more year before becoming a UFA, mirroring the situation of veteran Cam Ward, and the Canes will closely follow his performance to determine if he can be an important part of their team going forward.\n\n6. Going into July 1, the Canes announced the buyout of the mercurial Alex Semin, which never justified the 35 M/5-year deal signed before the 2013-14 season. The operation will cut 2.3M from their cap space for the next six years but the move was justified by the Russian’s inability to feed on a productive first season with the team (44 pts in 44 games in 2012-13, 61 pts in 122 games since then). The talented Semin has undoubtedly one of the most lethal releases in the league but with his profile on the downswing again, he’ll have to settle for one year, mid-level (probably on the 3-4M range, maybe even less) offers to continue his career in the NHL. A gamble some NHL teams looking for a top-six winger will make and one that could pay off on the right situation.\n\n7. Another GM that left Florida with a building block for his defensive core was Philadelphia’s Ron Hextall, who saw Ivan Provorov, for a lot of observers the most complete defenseman on the draft, fall to their lap. An all-around, mobile, physical defenseman, the Russian may well become the decade-long franchise blueliner the team has coveted and it’s not out of reach that he sticks with the Flyers in 2014-15. Hextall moved quicky to sign Provorov to an entry-level deal, and he could bring size, agility and some offensive flair to a defence that lacks those qualities.\n\nAfter Provorov, the Flyers collected a few more pieces for their future, starting by trading up on the latter part of the first round to select Travis Konecny, a skilled, energetic, yet undersized winger, and picking up a pair of athletic, promising goaltending prospects in Sweden’s Felix Sandstrom and Slovakia’s Felix Tomek. In the latter rounds, they kept getting away from the usual Flyers mentality, going with speed and skill instead of grit and physicality, showing that most NHL organizations are learning from mistakes and understanding the evolution of the game.\n\n8. Hextall and the Flyers brass had a good couple of days at the draft but the GM had more up his sleeve when he finalized a trade to get rid of the slow, expensive Nicklas Grossmann, sent to the Coyotes in return for center Sam Gagner, who, in spite of never fully blossoming on the league, can certainly help an offense that relied too heavily on their top guns. Along with Grossmann, Hextall dumped Chris Pronger’s contract to Arizona, opening some wiggle room to orchestrate more moves. The Flyers’ legend will continue to make everything in his power to offload the contracts of Vinny Lecavalier and R.J Umberger, but can take solace on the way he completely pickpocketed Boston’s Don Sweeney, prying a 3rd round pick for agitator Zac Rinaldo. And with Michael Neuvirth as the new backup to Steve Mason, the Flyers put on one of the team’s best goaltending tandems in quite some time.\n\n9. The rookie Boston Bruins’ GM was the talk of draft day and his summer just keeps delivering. Pressed against the salary cap, Sweeney traded tw"
