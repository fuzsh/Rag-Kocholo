        "text": "2011-12 WHL EASTERN DIVISION PREVIEW\n\nRegina Pats\n\nGeneral Manager: Chad Lang\n\nHead Coach: Pat Conacher\n\n2011 pre-season: 3-3-0-0, 6pts\n\n2010-11 Record: 23-39-7-3, 56pts (5th in East Div., 10th in Eastern Conf.) GF: 216 GA: 312\n\n2010-11 Power Play / Penalty Killing ranking: PP: 16.0% (18th); PK: 74.7% (22nd)\n\n2011 Playoffs: Did not qualify\n\n2010-11 Top Scorers:\n\nJordan Weal 72gp-43g-53a-96pts\n\nGarrett Mitchell 70gp-18g-34a-52pts\n\nBrandon Davidson 72gp-8g-43a-51pts\n\nUp Front: Jordan Weal will head up a Pats offense that is looking to improve upon what was the 17th-ranked attack in the WHL last season. The dynamic Weal, a Los Angeles Kings prospect, has put up 269 points over the last three seasons, and should find himself among the WHL’s leading scorers again this season. Veteran Lane Scheidl put up 30 points in 48 games after coming to the Pats in a trade last season, and will look for more production this season. Sophomore Chandler Stephenson and Czech rookie Dominik Volek will also be counted on to provide offense for the Pats. Talented rookies Jack Rodewald, who led the team with five pre-season goals, and Morgan Klimchuk could also add depth in the Pats’ offensive plans.\n\nOn The Blue Line: The Pats finished 22nd in the WHL in goals-against last year, having allowed 312 goals in 72 games. With potentially four rearguards returning from last year, plus the influx of some newcomers, the Pats will be aiming to reduce their goals-against considerably this season. Brandon Davidson led the Pats in scoring from the blue line with 51 points. The team hopes Davidson returns from pro camp, as he would be a key fixture on the blue line this season. Fellow 20-year-old Art Bidlevskii could also return, giving the team toughness and a physical presence. Sophomore Ricard Blidstrand and off-season acquisition Brandon Underwood add skill and puck-moving ability to the Pats’ back end.\n\nGoaltending: With veteran Damien Ketlo having been moved to Lethbridge, sophomore Matt Hewitt takes over as the Pats’ starting netminder. The 18-year-old from New Westminster, B.C., posted a 12-14-0-1 record in 32 appearances as a rookie last year, and has been very good in pre-season this year. 17-year-old rookies Teagan Sacher and Adam Beukeboom are battling for the back-up role.\n\nPlayer to Watch: Chandler Stephenson\n\nThe 5th overall pick from the 2009 WHL Bantam Draft, Stephenson enjoyed a solid season as a 16-year-old rookie for the Pats in 2010-11. The product of Saskatoon, SK, scored seven goals and 19 points in 60 games last year, and has been strong through the 2011 WHL pre-season. A skilled and speedy forward with an accurate and deceptive shot, Stephenson will look to take on a bigger role in the offensive plans for the Pats this season. Eligible for the 2012 NHL draft, expect Stephenson to step up his play and help get the Pats back into the playoffs.\n\nBrandon Wheat Kings\n\nGeneral Manager: Kelly McCrimmon\n\nHead Coach: Cory Clouston\n\n2011 pre-season: 1-3-0-0, 2pts\n\n2010-11 Record: 32-31-1-8, 73pts (3rd in East Div., 6th in Eastern Conf.) GF: 281 GA: 275\n\n2010-11 Power Play / Penalty Killing ranking: PP: 23.2% (3rd); PK: 74.9% (21st)\n\n2011 Playoffs: Lost in six games to Medicine Hat in first round\n\n2010-11 Top Scorers:\n\nMark Stone 71gp-37g-69a-106pts\n\nScott Glennie 70gp-35g-56a-91pts\n\nMatt MacKay 71gp-29g-51a-80pts\n\nUp Front: Mark Stone finished tied for third in WHL scoring last season as an 18-year-old. The Ottawa Senators prospect will be counted on to put up more big offensive totals for the Wheat Kings this season. 19-year-olds Michael Ferland and Brendan Walker both put up respectable numbers in secondary scoring roles last year for the Wheat Kings. Both will need to take on more of the offensive load this season after the Wheat Kings graduated three of their top four scorers from last season. Swiss rookie Alessio Bertaggia has shown some offensive skill through pre-season, and could be a contributor to the team’s attack this season.\n\nOn The Blue Line: The Wheat Kings can return six regulars on the blue line from last season, including impressive 17-year-old Ryan Pulock. The Grandview, MB, product quietly put up eight goals and 42 points as a 16-year-old, and will be a key component in the Wheaties’ defense corps this season. Also back is veteran Brodie Melnychuk and sophomores Eric Roy and Jordan Fransoo, who will all look to help the team reduce its goals-against and improve upon what was the 21st-ranked penalty killing unit last season. Rookie Ayrton Nikkel has impressed in pre-season play, and could add to the Wheat Kings’ defense corps this season.\n\nGoaltending: Corbin Boes and Liam Liston split time in the Wheat Kings’ net as rookies last season. Boes posted a 3.44 GAA in 33 starts last season while Liston earned 20 wins though his 41 starts. Both return to provide the Wheat Kings with a capable tandem in goal.\n\nPlayer to Watch: Ryan Pulock\n\nPulock enjoyed a tremendous season as a 16-year-old rookie last year, scoring eight goals and 42 points in 63 games. The Grandview, MB, native, who was a seventh-round bantam draft pick in 2009, led all Wheat Kings defensemen in scoring and also performed well for Team West at the 2011 World Under-17 Challenge. A good skater with excellent vision, a low panic level and strength at both ends of the ice, Pulock will be an important factor in any success the Wheat Kings enjoy this season.\n\nMoose Jaw Warriors\n\nDirector, Hockey Operations: Alan Millar\n\nHead Coach: Mike Stothers\n\n2011 pre-season: 6-1-0-0, 12pts\n\n2010-11 Record: 40-26-2-4, 86pts (2nd in East Div., 5th in Eastern Conf.) GF: 245 GA: 240\n\n2010-11 Power Play / Penalty Killing ranking: PP: 17.7% (16th); PK: 81.8% (8th)\n\n2011 Playoffs: Lost in six games to Kootenay in first round\n\n2010-11 Top Scorers:\n\nDylan Hood 71gp-33g-50a-83pts\n\nQuinton Howden 60gp-40g-39a-79pts\n\nSpencer Edwards 63gp-27g-39a-66pts\n\nUp Front: The Warriors could return three of their top five scorers from last season, including 19-year-old Quinton Howden. Howden scored 40 goals in just 60 games last season, and also starred for Team Canada at the 2011 World Junior Championships. If he doesn’t stick in the NHL with the Florida Panthers, expect Howden to be one of the WHL’s marquee players this season for the Warriors. St. Louis Blues prospect Cody Beach and Swiss rookie Eric Arnold should factor into the Warriors’ offensive attack while veteran Sebastian Svendsen will also provide plenty of scoring for what should be a strong Warriors offense.\n\nOn The Blue Line: The Warriors return up to six rearguards from last year’s team that boasted the fifth-best defensive record in the Eastern Conference. 20-year-old veteran Collin Bowman and 19-year-old Dylan McIlrath provide the Warriors with solid defensive play, size and toughness while Joel Edmundson, Dallas Ehrhardt and Kendall McFaull all stand at least 6’2” and add more defensive strength to what should be a very good Warriors’ blue line. 17-year-old Morgan Rielly, a possible high pick in next year’s NHL draft, will look to build on his solid rookie season last year. Rielly should be able to improve upon the six goals and 28 points he put up as a 16-year-old last season.\n\nGoaltending: The graduation of veteran Thomas Heemskerk will leave big shoes to fill in the Warriors net. 18-year-old Brandon Stone is back after posting a 4-5 record in 15 starts last season while 17-year-old rookie Spencer Tremblay looks to take a spot on the roster as well. The Warriors acquired 20-year-old Deven Dubyk from Medicine Hat during the pre-season.\n\nPlayer to Watch: Morgan Rielly\n\nOne of several blue-chip defensemen eligible for the 2011 NHL Entry Draft, Rielly looks to take on a key role on the Warriors’ blue line this season after a very good rookie season last year. The 17-year-old from Vancouver, B.C., possesses tremendous poise and patience with the puck, making him a strong presence on the power play. Rielly has also developed his defensive game to become a reliable presence in his own zone. Having dominated for Team Canada at the Memorial for Ivan Hlinka tournament in August, many expect Rielly to continue turning heads for the Warriors this season.\n\nPrince Albert Raiders\n\nGeneral Manager / Head Coach: Bruno Campese\n\n2011 pre-season: 3-1-0-0, 6pts\n\n2010-11 Record: 31-36-2-3, 67pts (4th in East Div., 8th in Eastern Conf.) GF: 247 GA: 283\n\n2010-11 Power Play / Penalty Killing ranking: PP: 18.8% (14th); PK: 79.0% (14th)\n\n2011 Playoffs: Lost in six games to Saskatoon in first round\n\n2010-11 Top Scorers:\n\nJonathan Parker 71gp-45g-41a-86pts\n\nMark McNeill 70gp-32g-49a-81pts\n\nJustin Maylan 66gp-21g-48a-69pts\n\nUp Front: The Raiders could return a powerful offensive group this season, with six of their top seven scorers from last season eligible to come back. 18-year-old Mark McNeill is coming off a 32-goal season as a sophomore, leading the Chicago Blackhawks to take him in the first round of the 2011 NHL draft. McNeill will surely be a big contributor for the Raiders this season. 20-year-olds Jonathan Parker, Brandon Herrod and Justin Maylan are all eligible to come back. With 45 goals last season, Parker could be one of the WHL’s top goal-scorers again this season. 18-year-old Todd Fiddler will look for a bigger offensive role this season after netting 23 goals as a rookie last year, while 17-year-old Mike Winther will be counted on to increase his production in his sophomore campaign.\n\nOn The Blue Line: Veteran Antoine Corbin heads up a group of six rearguards eligible to return to the club this season. Corbin, a 19-year-old, led the Raiders’ defense corps with eight goals and 29 points last season. Also back are 18-year-old Harrison Ruopp, who was drafted by Phoenix in the third round of the 2011 NHL draft, and sophomores Austin Bourhis, Mathew Berry-Lamontagna and Tyler Yaworski. With another year of experience under their belts, it will be up to the returning Raiders’ rearguards to help reduce the team’s goals-against from the 283 they allowed last season. Rookies Sawyer Lange and Josh Morrissey will look to break into the Raiders’ defense corps this season, too.\n\nGoaltending: 18-year-old Eric Williams returns to take the starting job with the Raiders. Williams appeared in 40 games for the team last season, posting 17 wins and a .898 save percentage, and has shown he is capable of taking the top netminding job. Joining Williams is fellow 18-year-old Cole Holowenko. Acquired from the Victoria Royals last season, Holowenko will look to push Williams for playing time.\n\nPlayer to Watch: Mike Winther\n\nThe Raiders’ first-round pick, sixth overall, in 2009, Winther potted nine goals as a 16-year-old rookie last season. A skilled offensive player with good attacking instincts, Winther also boasts a high energy level and strong work ethic. Although his offensive game is his strength, Winther has shown he can assume any role assigned to him. His physical and energetic play for Team Pacific at the 2011 World Under-17 Challenge showed his adaptability on the ice. Entering his NHL draft-eligible season, expect Winther to assume a larger role in the Raiders’ offensive plans in 2011-12.\n\nSaskatoon Blades\n\nGeneral Manager / Head Coach: Lorne Molleken\n\n2011 pre-season: 2-2-0-1, 5pts\n\n2010-11 Record: 56-13-1-2, 115pts (1st in East Div., 1st in Eastern Conf.) GF: 310 GA: 213\n\n2010-11 Power Play / Penalty Killing ranking: PP: 21.4% (8th); PK: 82.4% (6th)\n\n2011 Playoffs: Lost in four games to Kootenay in second round\n\n2010-11 Top Scorers:\n\nMarek Viedensky 63gp-36g-52a-88pts\n\nJosh Nicholls 71gp-34g-53a-87pts\n\nCurtis Hamilton 62gp-26g-56a-82pts\n\nUp Front: The Blades lose many of their veteran forwards who helped the team share the best offensive output in the WHL last year. Making up for the 115 goals scored by Marek Viedensky, Curtis Hamilton, Stefan Elliott and Brayden Schenn won’t be easy. Fortunately, the Blades return high-scoring forward Josh Nicholls and veteran Chris Collins, who will both be counted on to provide offense. 20-year-olds Jake Trask and Darian Dziurzynski are also eligible to return, which would add even more offensive depth. Sophomore Matej Stransky should be able to improve upon his 14 goals while Brent Benson will also be counted on to step up and take on a bigger role this season. Second-year forwards Ryan Olsen and Lukas Sutter also expect to play bigger roles this season.\n\nOn The Blue Line: The departure of veterans Stefan Elliott and Teigan Zahn opens the door for a new group of leaders on the Blades’ blue line. 18-year-old Duncan Siemens, a first-round pick by Colorado in the 2011 NHL Draft, is ready to assume a top role on the Blades’ blue line. The Sherwood Park, AB, product is an intimidating physical and defensive presence, and can also generate offense. Also returning are sophomore Darren Dietz and veterans Connor Cox and Dalton Thrower, who all possess good two-way abilities. 18-year-old Kyle Schmidt was acquired from Calgary during the pre-season to add defensive depth.\n\nGoaltending: The graduation of Steven Stanford leaves 20-year-old Adam Morrison as the likely candidate for the starting job this season. Morrison, a former Philadelphia Flyers draft pick, has 79 games of WHL experience under his belt, and has proven he can be relied upon in the Blades’ cage. 18-year-old Russian Andrey Makarov, who played in the QMJHL with Lewiston last season, has been impressive during pre-season. Makarov and Morrison give the Blades a solid duo in goal.\n\nPlayer to Watch: Matej Stransky\n\nHaving lost a few of their top offensive players from last season, the Blades will need some more contributions from their returnees. Stransky is a prime candidate to take on a bigger role in the Blades’ attack. The Ostrava, CZ, product is a big presence who is difficult to knock off the puck, and boasts strong puck skills and hockey sense. Drafted by Dallas in the sixth round of the 2011 NHL Entry Draft, Stransky should be able to improve on the 14 goals and 26 points he netted last season.\n\nSwift Current Broncos\n\nGeneral Manager / Head Coach: Mark Lamb\n\n2011 pre-season: 2-4-1-0, 5pts\n\n2010-11 Record: 26-44-0-2, 54pts (6th in East Div., 11th in Eastern Conf.) GF: 181 GA: 260\n\n2010-11 Power Play / Penalty Killing ranking: PP: 17.1% (17th); PK: 81.8% (T-8th)\n\n2011 Playoffs: Did not qualify\n\n2010-11 Top Scorers:\n\nJustin Dowling 63gp-20g-47a-67pts\n\nBrad Hoban 71gp-25g-26a-51pts\n\nTaylor Vause 62gp-18g-29a-47pts\n\nUp Front: The Broncos will be looking to increase their offensive output from the 181 goals they scored last season which ranked 20th in the WHL. Three of their top five scorers from last season are eligible to return, including Adam Lowry, who was a third-round pick of the Winnipeg Jets in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft. Lowry provides a big, physical presence and will look to better the 18 goals and 45 points he recorded last season. 20-year-olds Taylor Vause and Brad Hoban are also eligible to come back. Both will be counted on to provide scoring and leadership. 17-year-old rookie Coda Gordon impressed during pre-season play, and could add depth to the Broncos’ offense if he finds himself on the opening-night roster. 18-year-old Graham Black is another forward the Broncos hope can help out their offense.\n\nOn The Blue Line: Led by 18-year-old Reece Scarlett, the Broncos can return up to six rearguards from last season. Scarlett, a New Jersey Devils prospect, is the leading point-getter among the team’s returning blue liners, and will be counted on to play a much larger role this season. Czech defenseman Richard Nedomlel will also be looked upon to carry a heavy workload this season as the Broncos aim to shave down from the 260 goals they allowed last season. Veterans Dalton Reum, Jordan Evans, Graham Craig and Tanner Muth are also back, with only Craig and Evans boasting over 100 games of WHL experience. Rookies Dillon Heatherington, the team’s first-round pick in 2010, and Bobby Zinkan have shown they can play at the WHL level, and could push one of the returning vets for a full-time spot.\n\nGoaltending: The Broncos’ goaltending situation took a hit with the departure of Steffen Soberg, the team’s first-round pick from the 2011 CHL Import Draft. The loss of Soberg leaves sophomore Austin Smith and rookie Steven Myland as the go-to guys in net for the Broncos. Smith got into 11 games last season as a 17-year-old playing behind veteran Mark Friesen, and has been good in pre-season action. Myland was acquired from Kootenay in the Cody Eakin trade last year."
