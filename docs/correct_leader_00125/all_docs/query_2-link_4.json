The unique , dynamic and innovative mace design comprises three main components.\n\nwhich are :\n\nThe head : known as the torch ,\n\nThe body : known as the chalice ( batil ) ,\n\nThe haft : known as the column.\n\nThe torch-shaped head symbolizes the University role as a purveyor of knowledge. The engraved syahadah and the five-sided surfaces symbolize Islamization and the National Commandments ( Rukunegara ). Each of the five-sided surfaces is engraved with the following motifs :\n\nCrest of the government of Malaysia ,\n\nCrest of the state of Johor ,\n\nCrest of Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia ,\n\nThe national flower ,\n\nThe Parliament.\n\nThe body , known as the chalice symbolizes the fountain of knowledge. It is surrounded by carvings of floating clouds symbolizing tranquility in the acquisition of knowledge. The University crest on each side portrays the main function of the University in pursuing knowledge.\n\nThe column signifies authority which is the foundation of the development of knowledge. Stalks of paddy portray self-esteem. The end part of the haft is supported by a time capsule portraying the transition of time , in line with the development of science and technology as the core and pillar of the University establishment."
