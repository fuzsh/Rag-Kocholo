        "text": "The new, hurriedly formed country faced many political problems, including a period of Indonesian military opposition that ended in 1966, sporadic communist insurgency in Sarawak, periodic disenchantment in East Malaysia over federal policies and the domination of Peninsular Malaysia, and the secession of Singapore from the federation (at Malaysia’s urging) in 1965. The latter event resulted from increasing friction between the mostly Malay federal leaders and the mostly Chinese state leaders, especially Singapore’s independent-minded chief minister, Lee Kuan Yew, who disagreed on national goals. Under Lee’s autocratic direction and unconventional economic policies, Singapore became a highly prosperous but tightly controlled country, and relations with Malaysia gradually improved. Both countries became founding members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 1967.\n\nThe secession of Singapore allowed UMNO to exercise more influence over federal policies, even if it did not end political uncertainties. Communal tensions on the peninsula following a heated election generated riots and a countrywide state of emergency in 1969–70. Many non-Malays resented the government’s attempts to build national unity and identity through such measures as increasing the use of the Malay language in education and public life. The Chinese were particularly worried by government policies aimed at distributing more wealth to Malays. For instance, the New Economic Policy, launched in 1971 and renewed as the New Development Policy in 1991, was designed to increase significantly the wealth and economic potential of the bumiputra (Malays and other indigenous peoples)—especially the Malays. It included affirmative-action policies for bumiputra citizens in education and in employment in the civil service. A growing Islamic movement also fueled tensions in the country and wrought divisions within the Malay community itself. Beginning in the late 1970s, this Islamic fundamentalist revival, or dakwah movement, increasingly attracted the support of young Malays who felt alienated by what they perceived as the growth of a Westernized, materialistic society. Finally, although rural development policies reduced poverty rates, large pockets of urban and especially rural poverty persisted, with many regional and ethnic inequities in the distribution of wealth. Radical critics of the government (including communists, socialists, Islamic militants, and progressive intellectuals) were politically marginalized and sometimes detained.\n\nFor Sarawak and Sabah, politics within Malaysia proved to be a turbulent experience. The decision to join the federation was made in haste, and many people continued to resent the loss of their autonomy, especially their loss of control over growing petroleum revenues. Political crises occurred periodically in Sarawak, although it was governed after 1970 by a Malay-dominated, profederal but multiethnic coalition that represented a triumph of peninsular alliance-style politics. By the mid-1980s, however, some Iban leaders had challenged the coalition for being too accommodating to wealthy Malay and Chinese interests. The government encouraged the assimilation of Sarawak society to that of the peninsula and dramatically increased the exploitation of timber resources, often at the expense of interior peoples. Sabah politics also were contentious, with ongoing tensions between Muslim and non-Muslim groups. Between 1967 and 1975 Chief Minister Tun Mustapha ruled the state rigidly, absorbing or repressing opponents, promoting Islam, and challenging federal policies. The multiethnic coalition that replaced Mustapha continued to preside over rapid economic growth spurred by the exploitation of Sabah’s bountiful natural resources. Tensions resurfaced in the mid-1980s, however, when a Christian Kadazan-led party swept into power and followed policies opposed by federal leaders. Although peninsular sociopolitical patterns increasingly influenced Sabah and Sarawak, the states remained unique within the Malaysian system.\n\nDespite these difficulties, the country as a whole maintained its quasi-democratic parliamentary political system, including regular elections and moderate political diversity but also some restrictions on civil liberties, such as a ban on public discussion of issues deemed “sensitive.” Tunku Abdul Rahman was succeeded as prime minister by Tun Haji Abdul Razak bin Hussein in 1970. Upon Abdul Razak’s death in 1976, another UMNO leader, Datuk (later Tun) Hussein Onn, replaced him. In 1981 Tun Hussein Onn, owing to ill health, relinquished his positions as president of UMNO and as Malaysian prime minister, allowing Mahathir bin Mohamad to become the fourth prime minister and the first nonaristocrat to hold that office.\n\nMahathir’s 22-year tenure as prime minister was marked by an authoritarian style and economic success. His assertive manner and controversial policies generated a major split within UMNO: in 1986 Deputy Prime Minister Musa Hitam resigned, citing irreconcilable differences, and the following year Mahathir only narrowly survived a challenge to his role as UMNO president (and thus as prime minister). A subsequent challenge to Mahathir’s victory led the courts to declare UMNO illegal because it had failed to register properly. Mahathir was able to outmaneuver his opponents, however, by dissolving UMNO and forming a new Malay party, UMNO Baru (New UMNO; Baru was subsequently dropped in 1997 and the original name restored). Mahathir’s opponents countered by forming Semangat ’46 (Spirit of ’46), which claimed to embody the ideals of the original UMNO (established in 1946) and attempted to unite the disparate opposition groups against the ruling BN coalition headed by UMNO."
