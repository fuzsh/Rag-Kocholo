        "text": "The Faculty of Civil Engineering and Built Environment (FKAAB), formerly known as Faculty of Civil and Environmental Engineering (FKAAS), was established on May 1, 2004 as a result of the merging of two departments, i.e. the Department of Civil Engineering (Faculty of Engineering) and the Department of Construction and Environmental Engineering Technology (Faculty of Engineering Technology). The Department of Civil Engineering dates back to September 13, 1993 when Pusat Latihan Staf Politeknik (PLSP) was set up, while the Department of Construction and Environmental Engineering Technology was established on September 30, 2000 when Institut Teknologi Tun Hussein Onn (ITTHO) was upgraded to Kolej Universiti Teknologi Tun Hussein Onn (KUiTTHO).\n\nFKAAB offers academic programmes to students at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. These programmes are specifically designed towards the achievement of the faculty's vision and mission. Boasting a pool of academicians and researchers with doctorates from all across the globe, including United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Germany, Sweden, New Zealand, Japan and Hong Kong, FKAAB is a prime mover in conducting innovative and sustainable research in accordance with the needs of the nation. With its top quality education and prowess in research and development, FKAAB strives to become a driving force in producing human capital, and a main center of reference in civil engineering and built environment.\n\nThe Faculty of Electrical and Electronic Engineering or also known as FKEE, was established on the 1st of May 2004, from the merger of two previous faculties in Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, namely Faculty of Engineering and Faculty of Engineering Technology.\n\nIn FKEE, we believe on a high quality degree to fulfil the industrial needs. Therefore, our academic programmes are specifically designed to adhere to the stringent requirements by the Malaysian Qualifications Agency (MQA), Engineering Accreditation Council (EAC) and Board of Engineers Malaysia (BEM). The students can choose to specialise in various electrical and electronic engineering fields such as computer engineering, communication, mechatronics, microelectronics, medical electronics and electrical power.\n\nIn FKEE, the students are encouraged and nurtured to be competitive, dynamic, creative and highly ethical. These positive attributes are constantly instilled in them during the teaching & learning; and also in the extracurricular activities organised by the faculty from time to time. These efforts have made the FKEE graduates to be on par with other well-recognised higher learning institutions in Malaysia and highly sought after by the prospective employers.\n\nFaculty of Engineering Technology (FTK) University Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM) is currently operating in Pagoh Education Hub, Johor. Pagoh Education Hub is known to be the largest public education hub area in Malaysia.\n\nThe aim of the Faculty is to conduct academic engineering technology programmes which include foundational theory and emphasize on applications of the theory. Currently, FTK is offering several academic programmes at bachelor level. The engineering technology programmes are structured to be more practical biased than the conventional science-based engineering degree programme elsewhere. The career prospect of engineering technologist covers a broad spectrum in engineering field from product development, manufacturing, construction, improvement to optimisation of its operational functions.\n\nTo implement more practical biased curriculum, students are exposed to practical-based training throughout the 4-year programme with weightage of 60% practical and 40% theory. Practical will be conducted in the form of laboratory works, workshops and industrial training. In addition, FTK students are nurtured to be dynamic, creative and ethical by instilling soft skills throughout the teaching and learning process. Students will be guided by qualified and experienced academicians that are experts and professional in their respective fields. At the end of the programme, students are\n\nexpected to be dynamically competent to fulfil the ever-growing needs and requirements from both community and industries."
