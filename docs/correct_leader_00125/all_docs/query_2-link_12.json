        "text": "Tun Hussein Onn, Malaysia’s third Prime Minister led the country from 1976-1981. Hussein Onn shed tears both on resuming the premier’s office after the demise of Tun Abdul Razak and before leaving the helm for Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad. While officially, Hussein left for Mahathir citing ill health as his reason, it was later alleged that Mahathir backstabbed Hussein Onn and used his jedi powers to force the latter out.\n\nWhile we all know that UMNO was founded by Hussein Onn’s father, Dato’ Seri OnnJaafar and how OnnJaafar, Tunku Abdul Rahman, Tun Abdul Razak and Hussein Onn collectively increased the strengths of UMNO, we forget than Hussein Onn himself opposed Mahathir’s UMNO Baru from the outside. When Hussein Onn was asked why isn’t he a member of UMNO Baru and continuously opposed Mahathir, he replied by saying, “Firstly we are denied membership in UMNO Baru. Secondly, even if we were to be accorded membership, we disagree with its constitution and style of leadership. Thus we have no choice but to stay out and oppose UMNO Baru.”\n\nHussein Onn on numerous occasions also expressed despair and heartache to disunity that Mahathir brew. He once said, “We all want unity. But what is happening now is the worsening of disunity. We want to compromise. We want to reconcile. We want to forget all the differences. We want to return to the right path. But as you all know, all efforts towards unity have failed. Those in power don't pay much attention to our suggestions. They have turned a deaf ear to our advice. We can all see how anyone who advises or disagrees with those in power will be condemned, suspended or sacked from their position. All efforts from within have failed. That is why we now have to act from outside, as Independents.”\n\nMalaysia’s most loved Prince, Tunku Abdul Rahman walked hand-in-hand with Hussein Onnto oppose Mahathir. While Mahathir only recognizes contributions from the Malays for independence, the man who actually brought independence to Malaya spoke differently. Tunku openly criticised Mahathir for being power crazy.\n\n“We should be wary of the greedy man who wants to grab everything in this country to satisfy his lust for power. He says it is for the Malays, but in actual fact it is for himself. We must bear in mind that the Malays had never lived in affluence and never had a place in the administration of this country. When this country achieved Independence, we gained power with the cooperation of other communities. We were able to rule our own country. We should therefore, never be arrogant and break our promise to our friends in the other communities who had helped us to achieve independence,” uttered Tunku.\n\nBack then, Tunku kept pleading with the people to reject Mahathir. He constantly reminded, “All power is in the hands of the people, provided the people use the power wisely. Solidarity can only be achieved through UMNO, the original UMNO, not UMNO Baru, which is D Mahathir's UMNO.”\n\nPortraying the image of a fragile old man, Mahathir quivers and says he is a nobody today and he can only voice his concern against Datuk Seri Najib as a normal citizen of this country. If memory serves him right, he should be getting flashbacks of what he did to Tunku and Hussein Onn on every occasion Najib snubs him.\n\nMahathir is certainly getting back what he gave others before him. As they say, the globe is round. You are treated the exact same way you treat others.\n\nIf you want love, give love; If you want honesty, give honesty; If you want respect, give respect. You get in return, what you give!"
