        "text": "JOHOR BAHRU: Mr Onn Hafiz Ghazi was sworn in as Johor’s chief minister on Tuesday (Mar 15) afternoon.\n\nThe 43-year-old is the southern state’s 19th chief minister, taking over from Mr Hasni Mohammad, who is Benut assemblyman.\n\nMr Onn Hafiz, who is married with four children, will lead the next state government after the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition cruised to victory in the Johor polls last Saturday.\n\nHere are five things to know about Mr Onn Hafiz:\n\nMr Onn Hafiz is the great-grandson of Mr Onn Jaafar, the founding father of UMNO.\n\nThe late Mr Onn, who was a journalist, was credited with unifying a divided Malay community in the face of British rule to form UMNO in May 1946.\n\nMr Onn Hafiz is also the grandson of Malaysia’s third prime minister Hussein Onn, a respected politician who was referred to as the country’s “Father of Unity”.\n\nThe chief minister is also nephew to Malaysia’s current Senior Minister and UMNO vice president Hishammuddin Hussein.\n\nWhen Mr Onn Hafiz was first fielded as an UMNO candidate in the 2018 general election, he was quoted by the New Straits Times as saying: “I hope to do my level best to serve the people, as did the late Datuk Onn, the late Tun Hussein, and Datuk Hishammuddin.”\n\n“I hope to continue their legacy in serving the people,” he said.\n\nHis great-great-grandfather Jaafar Muhammad, father of Mr Onn, was Johor’s first chief minister.\n\nMr Onn Hafiz is also the deputy chief of UMNO’s Simpang Renggam division in Johor.\n\nIn December 2020, Mr Onn Hafiz confirmed that 13 hotels had been forced to shut in the state due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nUnder his leadership, Tourism Johor launched various initiatives to boost domestic tourism.\n\nAmong them was the issuance of 15,000 vouchers worth RM100 (US$23.75) each to domestic tourists to encourage them to engage in tourism activities in Johor.\n\nIn November 2021, Mr Onn Hafiz said hotel occupancy rates in Johor Bahru and Muar have increased by up to 80 per cent since interstate travel resumed after Malaysia loosened COVID-19 restrictions.\n\n3. From accountant to two-term state assemblyman\n\nPrior to being a state lawmaker, Mr Onn Hafiz was a professional accountant.\n\nHe graduated with an accountancy degree from the University of Hertfordshire in the United Kingdom. He previously attended Royal Military College in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nHe worked at PriceWaterhouseCoopers and was director at steel firm Chin Well Holdings.\n\nHe joined politics in 2006 and was first fielded as an UMNO candidate in 2018 for the state seat of Layang Layang.\n\nIn the election where UMNO sustained major losses and lost control of the Johor state government for the first time in six decades, Mr Onn Hafiz narrowly won his seat by just 364 votes over his nearest challenger Mr Murugan Muthu Samy of Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR).\n\nInstead of defending his seat in Layang Layang against PKR candidate Mr Maszlee Malik, who was touted as a possible chief minister candidate for the Pakatan Harapan coalition, Mr Onn Hafiz was next fielded in Machap.\n\nIn last Saturday's polls, he won the Machap seat comfortably, garnering 11,029 votes while his nearest challenger Mr Azlisham Azahar from Perikatan Nasional won 4,486 votes.\n\nOver the last year, the Southern Volunteers was mobilised by Johor Crown Prince Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim to help in COVID-19 vaccination efforts.\n\nThe group was tasked to help Johoreans register for vaccines and volunteer at immunisation centres.\n\nThe crown prince also mobilised the Southern Volunteers for flood relief efforts when areas like Segamat and Tangkak were affected in December 2021.\n\nMr Onn Hafiz led the mobilisation efforts, coordinating the Southern Volunteers with district offices and other government agencies.\n\nHe was also pictured on the ground overseeing humanitarian work by the Southern Volunteers."
