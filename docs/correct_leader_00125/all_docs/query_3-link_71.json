        "text": "FTUI once again welcomed a visit from a university in Malaysia. On March 5, 2024, Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM) paid a visit to FTUI. The visit took place in the Smart Meeting Room, Dean’s Building, FTUI. The purpose of UTHM’s presence was to discuss collaboration in academic and research areas between the universities.\n\nThe discussion began with a welcome address from Prof. Dr. Ir. Yanuar, M.Eng., M.Sc., Vice Dean of Education, Student Affairs, and Research at FTUI. Subsequently, the activity continued with introductions from both universities, considering that this visit from UTHM marked their first encounter.\n\nDuring this engagement, FTUI offered collaboration in the form of student exchange mobility and short-term programs. Meanwhile, UTHM proposed academic programs (undergraduate and graduate dual degree programs); mobility (inbound-outbound and staff exchange); teaching (teaching teams, joint workshops/seminars, and joint certifications); research (joint publications, joint grants, joint supervision, joint panel-course work programs, and joint conferences/competitions); joint supervision; and international excellence inspection. Despite many proposed collaborative opportunities, FTUI and UTHM couldn’t proceed with further cooperation as there was no general Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) yet.\n\nAside from UTHM, FTUI had previously established collaborations with three other universities in Malaysia: Universiti Teknologi Petronas (dual bachelor’s degrees), Universiti Malaya (international examiners), and Universiti Teknologi MARA (research collaboration and matching funds).\n\nDean of FTUI, Prof. Dr. Ir. Heri Hermansyah, ST., M.Eng., IPU., said, “We are delighted to continue expanding our network and collaborating with other universities abroad. Hopefully, an MOU between FTUI and UTHM can be established soon so that we can collaborate further.”\n\nThe cooperative visit was attended by a delegation from FTUI, including Prof. Yanuar; Dr.-Ing. Ir. Dalhar Susanto as Manager of Cooperation, Ventures, and Alumni; Prof. Ir. Mahmud Sudibandriyo, M.Sc., Ph.D., as Vice Dean of Resources, Ventures, and General Administration; Fadhilah Muslim, S.T., M.Sc., Ph.D., DIC., as Head of FTUI International Office; Kristanti Dewi Paramita, S.Ars., M.A., Ph.D., as Secretary of the Architecture Department; and Dr. Eng. Arief Udhiarto, S.T., M.T., as Head of the Electrical Engineering Department.\n\nThe UTHM delegation consisted of Prof. Dato’ Ir. Ts. Dr. Ruzairi bin Abdul Rahim as Vice Chancellor; Prof. Dr. Shahruddin bin Mahzan Mohd Zin as Deputy Vice Chancellor for Academic & International; Prof. Ir. Ts. Dr. Mohd Haziman bin Wan Ibrahim as Dean, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Built Environment; Assc. Prof. Ts. Dr. Asmarashid bin Ponniran as Dean, Faculty of Electrical and Electronic Engineering; Assoc. Prof. Ts. Dr. Sasitharan A/L Nagapan as Head of the Promotion and International Marketing Department and International Office; and Mr. Mohamad Reeza bin Abd Patah as Special Officer to the Vice-Chancellor.\n\n***"
