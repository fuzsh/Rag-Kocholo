Debate is a huge part of my life, and it has given me so much: life-long relationships, confidence in myself, a love for learning, and so on. Van Gogh’s words serve as a reminder not only for me to seek fulfilment in whatever I do; they remind me if there is someone else out there who might share the same love for something as I do, I have a duty to make sure they have an opportunity for it.\n\nShireen Ali Fahed Qassem Abu Nejra\n\nBachelor of Science (Honours) Biomedicine\n\n\"Philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it.\"\n\nThis is a powerful quote by Karl Marx. It reminds me that we have a responsibility not just to interpret the world, but to actively work towards changing it for the better.\n\nI would never want any other kid out there experiencing the lack of exposure or know-how in reaching their full potential. Ergo; I have pledged to support other under privileged, underserved, and underrepresented students out there.\n\nChow Shenn Kuan\n\nBachelor of Science (Hons) Business Studies\n\n“Life’s most persistent and urgent question is, what are you doing for others?”\n\nThis quote by Martin Luther King resonates strongly because the ability to help one another and bring about a positive impact is important to me.\n\nCommunity service has helped me develop a sense of social responsibility. In other words, to build the \"heart\" of giving back. Giving back to the community adds purpose to my life and often makes me feel good about myself.\n\nShamalan Rajesvaran\n\nBachelor of Information Systems (Honours) (Data Analytics)\n\nStudents FAQ\n\nStudy as an\n\nInternational Student\n\nat Sunway University\n\nView More\n\nSustainability\n\nSunway University is dedicated to championing sustainability efforts within and around the campus by instilling sustainable practices into the various aspects of the university experience such as ensuring high standards in sustainability research, sustainable work practices and sustainable consumption.\n\nNew Programme Announcement\n\n100% Online Master of Education\n\nElevate excellence in the new era of education\n\nRead More About it Here\n\nEvents"
