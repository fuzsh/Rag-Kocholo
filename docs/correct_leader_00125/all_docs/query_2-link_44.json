        "text": "The PLOS ONE Editorial Board is powered by thousands of academic experts from all over the world. Our board comprises working scientists who are established principal investigators/group leaders with extensive publication records.\n\nAcademic Editors oversee the peer review process for the journal, including evaluating submissions, selecting reviewers and assessing their comments, and making editorial decisions. Together with fellow Editorial Board Members and internal staff, Academic Editors uphold journal policies and ethics standards and work to promote the PLOS ONE mission to provide free public access to scientific research.\n\nEditorial board members affiliated with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization or any other government agency are serving in a personal capacity. The views expressed are their own and do not necessarily represent the views of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the United States Government.\n\nInterested in serving on the Editorial Board?\n\nPLOS welcomes volunteers to the Editorial Board who support our mission, values, and commitment to providing a high-quality experience for our authors.
