        "text": "Exploring Learnersâ Mental Health Profile: A study in Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLee, M. F.; Lai, C. S.\n\n2017-08-01\n\nMental health issue was a serious matter that was often neglected by people. This article will describe a study of the mental health profile among the learners of Malaysia Technical University (MTU) that focus on Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM). A survey using DASS-21 inventory and self-developed questionnaire was used for this study to investigate learnersâ mental health level in three elements and factors contribute towards mental health. A total number of 450 students from seven faculties in UTHM was strata randomly selected as sampel for this study. The relationships between factors of mental health and the elements of mental health was identified. Collected data was analysed using percentage, mean score, standard deviation and multiple linear regression. Findings showed that majority of students possess normal level but the percentage of severe and extremely severe level was increasing. The main factor highly significantly correlate to all the mental health elements was self-evaluation. Hence, it is highly recommended that mental health issue needs great attention and remedial action from higher learning institution, non-governmental organizations, parents, students themselves and other concerned bodies.\n\nBaseline for food waste generation - A case study in Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia cafeterias\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAlias, A. R.; Mokhlis, N. A. Mohd; Zainun, N. Y.\n\n2017-11-01\n\nIncreasing population and economy status have contributed to the increasing volume of solid wastes produced in Malaysia and it creates problems on the existing solid waste management system. Ineffective waste management system was one of the issues that often discussed. The purpose of this study was to suggest the best method for managing food waste in Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM) cafeterias. The scope of the study was to identify the type and quantity of waste generated in each cafeteria. The study area was carried out at six cafeteria in UTHM including residential college cafeteria which are Tun Dr. Ismail (TDI), Tun Fatimah (TF) and Tun Syed Nasir (TSN), G3âs cafeteria, Arked, and Dr. Munieâs cafeteria located at the Faculty of Civil and Environmental Engineering (FKAAS). In this study, food waste was quantified in unit of kilogram (kg). Results of the study showed that total food waste in selected UTHMâs cafeterias was 6197.5 kg for two months. Food waste generated in G3âs cafeteria was the highest value with 1823.5 kg among another cafeteria. This is due to strategic location for students and staff to take meals, the variety of food sold and reasonable price were major factors of generating food waste. Meanwhile, the Dr. Munie's Cafeteria located in FKAAS recorded the least total production of food waste as staffs and students take their meals at others cafeterias. Through literature review, there are list of methods on waste management were identified and composting method was suggested for food waste management in UTHM since the waste was produce in very large quantity.\n\nLevel of Bus Performance Based On the Relationship Between Distance and Travel Time of Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM Bus Services\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPrasetijo Joewono\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFull Text Available UTHM bus service is an important transport mode for most students at Universiti Tun Hussein Onn because it such primary public vehicle to support students movements around the campus, within and outside student apartments. This service is often associated with the quality of service in terms of time, stops and comforts. Therefore, this following study is focused on investigation on several UTHM bas routes which was based on bas operations such as distance and travel time/travel distance that would determine the level of service provided. Primary data were collected mainly to obtain information relate to speed, bas position, time movement/circulations of bus and time headway. These were obtained by installing GPS-Slute Gear i-trail along bus travels. In addition, additional data were collected by exploring previous studies regarding to the bus services such as Highway Capacity Manual (HCM 2010. The approach used was based on assessment of progress used to determine the level of quest service and such obstacle frequently occurs with results on bus delays, volume of unequal that can be overcome according to the assessments that have been provided.\n\nWoman Friendly Mosque, Features and Facilities: A Case Study on Masjid Sultan Ibrahim, Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSuratkon, A.; Salam, N. N. Abd; Rahmat, M. H.; Arhan, A. S. Mohd; Wahab, I. Abd; Ghaffar, S. A.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nMosque has gone through a long and complex development throughout the Muslimâs history which involved the interrelation between its functions and its design. During the process, many aspects of its design were reconfigured including the female facilities in the mosque. In Malaysia, there is a progressive movement to transform the roles and functions of the mosque from exclusive place for prayers and seclusion to a community center. Nevertheless, there are still a numbers of muslim women voices their frustration towards the facilities provided to them in the mosque. Indirectly, this has discourage participation of women in the mosque. The objective of this paper is to investigate the opinions and needs of muslim women in a mosque and to propose appropriate features and facilities for a female-friendly mosque. The study explored through a field observation and a set of questionnaires, which involves a case study of Masjid Sultan Ibrahim in Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia. The field observation was carried out to analyze its current conditions, facilities, design and features. On the other hand, a set of questionnaire was distributed to the women visitors who were mainly students and staffs as to get their insight on this issue. From the field observation and the survey distributed, it was clearly seen that the facilities provided for the female users were still not up to the standard of a âwomen-friendly mosqueâ. Some proposals were provided to improve on the current condition and to be taken into consideration by future designers in designing a mosque.\n\nThermal characteristics of a residential house in a new township in Johor Bahru\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLee, Y. Y.; Lee, Y. H.; Mohammad, S.; Shek, P. N.; Ma, C. K.\n\n2017-11-01\n\nAs one of the densest population occurred in Johor Bahru, development of a new township become necessary in order to cater this growth. Rapid urbanization is a factor of degradation of environmental quality which may increase surrounded temperature through urban heat island (UHI) phenomena. Therefore, this paper is investigating thermal comfort for a new township, Bandar Dato Onn in Johor Bahru, in order to understand the thermal characteristics of a new township and for further mitigation of UHI phenomena. Surface temperature, ambient temperature and relative humidity have been collected from a terrace house of Bandar Dato Onn. Thermal characteristics with the features of time lag and decrement factors were discussed based on the collected data. The time lag of 5 to 8 hours and the decrement factors of 0.02 to 0.06 were recorded during a five-day measurement. It was concluded that human thermal comfort may not be achieved as the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system needed for bedroom and living room. Passive energy design is suggested to be included in the house in order to have human thermal comfort while reducing the electricity consumption towards sustainable future.\n\nJohor Parkview Mall\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nIrfansyah, Haffidz\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe Mall is a must-have every major city.

It was stumbled upon in the Leiden cryogenic laboratory of Heike Kamerlingh Onnes in a moment of serendipity. Three years before, the liquefaction of helium on the other hand had been the culmination of a long battle with nature. It was a meticulously prepared operation, ``big science'' in its first appearance. Until recently, careless notebook entries by Kamerlingh Onnes and his terrible handwriting had hindered a complete view to the road to superconductivity. Even a date of the fascinating discovery was lacking. How did the discovery fit into the Leiden research program? What about the research effort Kamerlingh Onnes had to put in to be sure he had found superconductivity rather than a short-circuit? What about superfluidity? Once the right interpretation of the notebooks is clear, the real story can be told.\n\nDefeating Saddam Hussein's Strategy\n\nNational Research Council Canada - National Science Library\n\nMillen, Raymond A\n\n2003-01-01\n\nShould war break out between Iraq and the United States, Saddam Hussein will likely adopt a strategy designed to undermine the prestige of the United States and turn the Arab World against the West...\n\nSaddam Hussein et la dÃ©bÃ¢cle triomphante. Les ressources insoupÃ§onnÃ©es de Umm al-MaâÃ¢rik\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPeter Harling\n\n2007-07-01\n\nFull Text Available Les performances du rÃ©gime irakien tout au long de la crise de 1991 ont suscitÃ© deux types de lectures opposÃ©es. Pour le sens commun, il sâagissait dâune dÃ©faite incontestable. Pourtant, Saddam Hussein, de son cÃ´tÃ©, lâa qualifiÃ©e de Â«Â MÃ¨re des BataillesÂ Â» (Umm al-MaâÃ¢rik et de triomphe absolu. Une telle exagÃ©ration est plus que le simple produit de lâimagination dâun despote. Il le pensait en effet si bien quâil a, en 2003, Ã©laborÃ© sa stratÃ©gie de dÃ©fense sur le modÃ¨le de 1991. Plus significativement, la rÃ©ponse du rÃ©gime aux dÃ©fis quâil avait lui-mÃªme fabriquÃ©s en envahissant le Koweit suggÃ¨re que la crise de 1991 Ã©tait elle-mÃªme la voie de sortie dâune crise plus structurelle Ã laquelle Saddam Hussein aurait eu toutes les chances de succomber. Cet article explore plusieurs aspects mÃ©connus de ce moment historique. PremiÃ¨rement, il relie les Ã©vÃ¨nements de 1991 Ã la banqueroute Ã©conomique, institutionnelle et symbolique du rÃ©gime. DeuxiÃ¨mement, il attire lâattention sur sa rÃ©ponse complexe Ã la situation.

Noor; Bakhiah, Baharim N.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nSungai Johor estuary is a vital water body in the south of Johor and greatly affects the water quality in the Johor Straits. In the development of the hydrodynamic and water quality models for Sungai Johor estuary, the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC) model was selected. In this application, the EFDC hydrodynamic model was configured to simulate time varying surface elevation, velocity, salinity, and water temperature. The EFDC water quality model was configured to simulate dissolved oxygen (DO), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), phosphate (PO4), and Chlorophyll a. The hydrodynamic and water quality model calibration was performed utilizing a set of site specific data acquired in January 2008. The simulated water temperature, salinity and DO showed good and fairly good agreement with observations. The calculated correlation coefficients between computed and observed temperature and salinity were lower compared with the water level. Sensitivity analysis was performed on hydrodynamic and water quality models input parameters to quantify their impact on modeling results such as water surface elevation, salinity and dissolved oxygen concentration. It is anticipated and recommended that the development of this model be continued to synthesize additional field data into the modeling process.\n\nEffects of Leadership Styles in Technical and Vocational Students, UTHM\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRazak, Nur Afifah Binti Abdul; Hamidon, Nur Izeanty Binti\n\n2015-01-01\n\nEffective leadership helps our nation through times become a developed country.

Westernisation argument is flawed because during the period under consideration, Johor was not yet fully under the control of the West. The archival records show that Johorâs transformation was self-initiated to promote the welfare of the people. The reforms Abu Bakar brought about in Johor affected more the Malay culture than Islamic rules and practices. Even then these reforms not simply modernised but elevated the position of certain aspects of Malay culture.

Melayu Gelang Patah, Johor Bahru, Johor) and a rural (Felda Simpang Waha, Kota Tinggi, Johor) habitats in Malaysia. Larval surveys were conducted once in every two months at each habitat over a period of 11 months from August 2000 until June 2001. There was a significant difference between the three study sites in terms of potential breeding sites inspected (psuburban (29.35)>urban habitat (16.97). Both breeding sites and potential breeding sites were the nominator and the total number of containers inspected as the denominator in the formula of PCI, thus the latter could be a potential indicator to initiate anti-dengue campaign at the community level to rid off potential Aedes breeding sites. The three most common potential breeding sites of Aedes species were similar for urban and suburban habitats (flower pots, pails and bowls respectively). However, flower pots, vases and tyres were the three most common potential breeding sites for the rural habitat. Another finding in this study was that various types of larval habitats were found indoors and outdoors for both species.\n\nHeadship Rate for Population Projection in Johor Bahru\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nRawan Nurfilzah Mohamad; Zainun Noor Yasmin; Alias Ahmad Rizal; Ibrahim Izzah Sofea\n\n2017-01-01\n\nHeadship rate method is used to forecast population for housing demand.

A number of Sunni scholars, while confirming Yazid's role in the Karbala incident, for this reason and for other reasons considered him to be cursed or excommunicated. But, another group, for defending the idea of âCaliphateâs legitimacyâ, exonerated Yazid and accused Ibn Ziyad instead. This seeks to elucidate Yazid's responsibility in the occurrence of the Karbala incident. For this purpose, it first examines the reasons for those who call for the exoneration of Yazid, and then considers reasons for direct role of Yazid in the martyrdom of Imam Hussein (AS and the occurrence of the disaster of Karbala. The results of this research indicated that Yazid threatened and ultimately killed Imam Hussein (AS with his intentions, and that his regret was secondary and dishonest.\n\nThrough measurement to knowledge the selected papers of Heike Kamerlingh onnes 1853â1926\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nGoudaroulis, Yorgos\n\n1991-01-01\n\n\"Tile; D'apC:Tile; l.

The recent creation of the Iskandar Malaysia, an economic strategy which aims to be a global player as potential destination for high-value investments, has certainly added social, environmental and economic stress to its urban citizens. This paper intends to develop urban livability indicators for Metropolitan Johor anchored on the changing urban complexion in the face of climate change, economic, governance, social and cultural dynamics, among others. The urban livability conundrum of Metro Johor illustrates that indicators are imperative, especially policy-based indicators, which would aid to scale-up the desired progress according to urban livability metrics. The study involves iterative 3-rounds of Delphi blind survey with Likert scaleâs degree of agreement, and finally assigning weightings to each sub-indicator. Thus, with the expert-stakeholders involvement, constituting broad-sectoral community representation, a robust and appropriate urban livability index for Metro Johor was generated - a comprehensive framework yet prospective benchmark in appropriating timely policy decisions that would redound to the benefit of urban citizens ensuring a livable Metropolitan Johor.\n\nShort-term variability of Johor River discharge based on wavelet analysis\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAhmad, N.; Kamaruddin, S.

The developer applied to the Department of Environment (DOE) Johor in July 2008 for approval of the environmental impact assessment (EIA) report for the overall Medini development. A conditional approval of the EIA report was granted by the DOE subject to some conditions, one of which stipulated that sewage effluent from the centralized sewage treatment plant (STP) is not permitted to be discharged into Sungai Pendas. A suitable location for the discharge of sewage into the Selat Johor is to be identified, based on a hydraulic and water quality modelling investigation. This modelling investigation aims to assess the impact of the discharge of treated sewage effluent on the marine water quality and on aquatic life in the Selat Johor. The supplementary EIA report was submitted to the DOE. Approval was granted in December 2011 for the construction of the marine sewage outfall and its operations. This paper presents the sampling and simulation results for key hydraulic and environmental parameters suitable for sustaining acceptable faecal coliform criteria in Selat Johor. Simulation models used include WASP7 developed by USEPA and AQUASEA developed by Vatnaskil Consulting Engineers.\n\nLow prevalence of Dirofilaria immitis in dogs in Johor Bahru, Malaysia as a reflection of vector availability?\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNg, K L; Lee, E L; Sani, R A\n\n2012-03-01\n\nThis study was conducted to investigate the low prevalence of Dirofilaria immitis in dogs in Johor Bahru as reported by veterinary practitioners, using wet blood mount, Knott's Concentration Test and two heartworm antigen test kits (IDEXX Canine SNAPÂ® 4Dx and RapiGENÂ®). This study also compared the two test kits used and determined the microfilaria species. Blood were collected from 100 owned dogs and 50 stray dogs in Johor Bahru via cephalic venipuncture. A thick blood smear was done and examined for samples that were positive for microfilaria species identification. The overall prevalence of D. immitis in dogs in Johor Bahru was 1.33% (2/150) and the microfilaria identified was D. immitis. The prevalence of heartworm in owned and stray dogs in this study was 1% and 2% respectively. With only one false negative result from RapiGENÂ® test kit, comparing the sensitivity between the two test kits could not be achieved. The low prevalence of D. immitis found in this study confirmed anecdotal evidence that prevalence of dirofilariasis is indeed low in Johor Bahru. Additionally, we speculate that dirofilariasis in dogs might be considered as an indicator of vector availability.\n\nAnalisis Pemanfaatan Kredit Usaha Rakyat (KUR) Bagi Pengembangan Usaha Kecil Menengah (UKM) di Kecamatan Medan Johor\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nDalimunthe, Mhd Hidayat\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis study entitled \"Utilization Analysis Business Credit (KUR) For the Development of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in the district of Medan Johor\".

The TL-moments with different trimming values are used to estimate the parameter of the selected distributions namely: Three-parameter lognormal (LN3) and Pearson Type III (P3) distribution. The main objective of this study is to derive the TL-moments ( t 1,0), t 1 = 1,2,3,4 methods for LN3 and P3 distributions. The performance of TL-moments ( t 1,0), t 1 = 1,2,3,4 was compared with L-moments through Monte Carlo simulation and streamflow data over a station in Johor, Malaysia. The absolute error is used to test the influence of TL-moments methods on estimated probability distribution functions. From the cases in this study, the results show that TL-moments with four trimmed smallest values from the conceptual sample (TL-moments [4, 0]) of LN3 distribution was the most appropriate in most of the stations of the annual maximum streamflow series in Johor, Malaysia.\n\nSelection of Possible Candidate Area for Nuclear Power Plant in Johor, Malaysia\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nNor Afifah Basri; Ahmad Termizi Ramli\n\n2012-01-01\n\nNuclear power is considered as one of the best option for future energy development in Malaysia.

Many rivers have been polluted because of the rapid growth in industrialization to support the country's growing population and economy. Domestic and industrial sewage, agricultural wastes have polluted the rivers and will affect the water quality. Based on the Malaysia Environment Quality Report 2007, the Department of Environment (DOE) has described that one of the major pollutants is Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD). Data from DOE in 2004, based on BOD, 18 river basins were classified polluted, 37 river basins were slightly polluted and 65 river basins were in clean condition. In this paper, two models are fitted the data of rivers in Johor state namely Streeter-Phelps model and nonlinear regression (NLR) model. The BOD concentration data for the two rivers in Johor state from year 1981 to year 1990 is analyzed. To estimate the parameters for the Streeter-Phelps model and NLR model, this study focuses on the weighted least squares and Gauss-Newton method respectively. Based on the value of Mean Square Error, NLR model is a better model compared to Streeter-Phelps model.\n\nRetorika Barack Hussein Obama Dan Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono Dalam Menanggapi Isu Isis Di Dunia\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLivia\n\n2015-07-01\n\nFull Text Available This research discuss about the rhetoric performed by Barack Hussein Obama as President of the United States and Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono as President of the Republic of Indonesia in delivering feedback over the ISIS issue that circulating around the world.

To determine the pattern of childhood glomerulonephritis in Johor, Malaysia from a histopathological perspective and the various indications used for renal biopsy in children. Retrospective study was done of all renal biopsies from children under 16 years of age, received in Sultanah Aminah Hospital, Johor between 1994 and 2001. The histopathological findings were reviewed to determine the pattern of biopsy-proven glomerulonephritis. The indications for biopsy, mode of therapy given after biopsy and the clinical outcome were studied. 122 adequate biopsies were received, 9 children had repeat biopsies. Of the 113 biopsies, minimal change disease formed the most common histopathological diagnosis (40.7%) while lupus nephritis formed the most common secondary glomerulonephritis (23.0%). The main indications for biopsy were nephrotic syndrome (50.8%), lupus nephritis (25.4%) and renal impairment (13.1%). The mode of therapy was changed in 59.8% of the children. Of 106 patients followed-up, 84 children were found to have normal renal function in remission or on treatment. 4 patients developed chronic renal impairment and 16 reached end stage renal disease. Five of the 16 children with end stage disease had since died while 11 were on renal replacement therapy. Another 2 patients died of other complications. The pattern of childhood GN in our study tended to reflect the more severe renal parenchymal diseases in children and those requiring more aggressive treatment. This was because of our criteria of selection (indication) for renal biopsy. Renal biopsy where performed appropriately in selected children may not only be a useful investigative tool for histological diagnosis and prognosis but may help clinicians plan the optimal therapy for these children.\n\nPatients with end stage renal disease: a registry at Sultanah Aminah Hospital, Johor Bahru, Malaysia.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLiu, W J; Hooi, L S\n\n2007-08-01\n\nThe epidemiology of new patients presenting to Sultanah Aminah Hospital Johor Bahru (HSAJB) with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in 2003 and 2004 was analysed. Patients with ESRD were prospectively registered in the renal replacement therapy (RRT) database in the nephrology unit. The incidence of ESRD and the RRT provision rate in the district of Johor Bahru were calculated according to gender and race. There were 306 new patients in 2003 and 299 in 2004. Diabetic nephropathy contributed 56.8% new patients in 2003 and 57.9% in 2004. The mean age was 50.8 + 15.1 years in 2003 and 51.3 + 14.2 years in 2004. Males accounted for 53.3% in 2003 and 47.8% in 2004. Haemodialysis was the commonest form of RRT (60.5% in 2003, 69.9% in 2004), followed by continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (30.1% in 2003, 19.4% in 2004) and renal transplantation (5.5% in 2003, 2.3% in 2004). Ninety-one percent of patients in 2003 and 90% in 2004 were alive at the end of the year they presented. The incidence of ESRD in the district of Johor Bahru was estimated as 136 per million population (p.m.p.) in 2003 and 151 p.m.p. in 2004. In the two year period the incidence of ESRD was higher among females (154 p.m.p.) than males (134 p.m.p.). Malays (194 p.m.p.) had higher ESRD incidence compared to Chinese (126 p.m.p.) and Indians (134 p.m.p.). RRT provision in Johor Bahru (92.7%) did not differ significantly with gender or race.

However, it is unclear whether this was due to difference in habitat complexity or water quality parameters.? To test this, larval fish were collected by using a bongo net equipped with a flow meter by subsurface horizontal towing from different habitats in Johor Strait between October 2007 and September 2008.? Various physico-chemical parameters were measured and then examined for any relationship to fish larvae diversity and abundance. Among the 24 families identified from the sites, seven families (Blenniidae, Clupeidae, Mullidae, Nemipteridae, Syngnathidae, Terapontidae and Uranoscopeidae) were significantly correlated with the tested waters quality parameters.? Salinity showed a positive and negative significant correlation with Clupeidae (p Johor Strait, Malaysia. This likely indicates that habitat structure was more important in determining larval abundance (highest in the seagrass habitat) as compared to water quality at the tested sites. This study emphasizes the need to conserve seagrass beds as important nursery grounds for various fish larvae to ensure adequate recruitment and ultimately sustainable fisheries management. ?\n\nAwareness and willingness among the residents in Johor Bahru City Council and Johor Bahru Tengah Municipal Council of Iskandar Malaysia-Im (Wpi@Sjer towards recycling\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMohd Halim Nora Farina\n\n2018-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Solid waste is increasingly becoming an important urban challenge as a result from population growth and also the development of economy and culture which has improved the standard of living and the lifestyle of the people. If left unchecked, solid waste could lead to severe environmental degradation. In order to reduce the environmental impact of waste disposal, recycling has been introduced. About twenty percent of our solid waste can be recyclable, rather than disposing it through landfills or incinerators. Residential area is the best place to practice recycling because most of the waste is generated there every day. This research focus on the awareness level and the recycling knowledge among the residents in Johor Bahru City council and Johor Bahru Tengah Municipal Council of Iskandar Malaysia. A total of 500 residents were surveyed and the questionnaires were focused on the waste management and also the recycling knowledge. The results discovered that more than 50% of the residentsâ state that they practicing recycle and they also aware of the environmental and economic benefits from recycling. As a conclusion, the residents are prepared for recycling if the recycling amenities are available and easy to reach by them.\n\nStochastic generation of hourly rainstorm events in Johor\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nNojumuddin, Nur Syereena; Yusof, Fadhilah; Yusop, Zulkifli\n\n2015-01-01\n\nEngineers and researchers in water-related studies are often faced with the problem of having insufficient and long rainfall record. Practical and effective methods must be developed to generate unavailable data from limited available data. Therefore, this paper presents a Monte-Carlo based stochastic hourly rainfall generation model to complement the unavailable data. The Monte Carlo simulation used in this study is based on the best fit of storm characteristics. Hence, by using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Anderson Darling goodness-of-fit test, lognormal appeared to be the best rainfall distribution. Therefore, the Monte Carlo simulation based on lognormal distribution was used in the study. The proposed model was verified by comparing the statistical moments of rainstorm characteristics from the combination of the observed rainstorm events under 10 years and simulated rainstorm events under 30 years of rainfall records with those under the entire 40 years of observed rainfall data based on the hourly rainfall data at the station J1 in Johor over the period of 1972â2011. The absolute percentage error of the duration-depth, duration-inter-event time and depth-inter-event time will be used as the accuracy test.

Like the other Malaysian cities, Johor Bahru is mostly dependent on private vehicles such as motor cars and motor cycles. The ridership on public transport especially public bus is getting lower over the years. In this situation the sustainability in transportation and land use cannot be ensured. This paper aims to assess the public transport facility in Taman Ungku Tun Aminah in Johor Bahru which is very old and traditional residential area with some major extent of commercial and educational land uses. The actual scenario of public transport service and underlying problems that impeded the residents to use public bus service is observed in this paper. The possible options for the improvement of the bus service and turning it into an effective short and medium length inter town travel media are also discussed as well. Both the primary and secondary information are collected for the purpose of study. Various descriptive statistical data analysis are done in order to get the expected outcome from the collected data. According to this study only 26.7% of the respondents use public bus for their daily travel. The opinion of the respondents is taken for the underlying causes of their reluctance on using public bus service and also the effective measures for the enhancement of this service to the users like them. Finally some recommendations and strategic actions and policy frameworks are also suggested in this paper.\n\nCointegration analysis for rice production in the states of Perlis and Johor, Malaysia\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nShitan, Mahendran; Ng, Yung Lerd; Karmokar, Provash Kumar\n\n2015-02-01\n\nRice is ranked the third most important crop in Malaysia after rubber and palm oil in terms of production. Unlike the industrial crops, although its contribution to Malaysia's economy is minimal, it plays a pivotal role in the country's food security as rice is consumed by almost everyone in Malaysia. Rice production is influenced by factors such as geographical location, temperature, rainfall, soil fertility, farming practices, etc. and hence the productivity of rice may differ in different state. In this study, our particular interest is to investigate the interrelationship between the rice production of Perlis and Johor. Data collected from Department of Agriculture, Government of Malaysia are tested for unit roots by Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) unit root test while Engle-Granger (EG) procedure is used in the cointegration analysis. Our study shows that cointegrating relationship exists among the rice production in both states. The speed of adjustment coefficient of the error correction model (ECM) of Perlis is 0.611 indicating that approximately 61.1% of any deviation from the long-run path is corrected within a year by the production of rice in Johor.\n\nPrevalence and predictors of erectile dysfunction in adult male outpatient clinic attendees in Johor, Malaysia.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNordin, Rusli Bin; Soni, Trived; Kaur, Amrina; Loh, Kean Por; Miranda, Shashi\n\n2018-05-18\n\nErectile dysfunction (ED) is a serious burden globally that affects men as well as their partners. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and predictors of ED among male outpatient clinic attendees in Johor, Malaysia. A cross-sectional study of Malaysian men aged 18 and older attending two major outpatient clinics in Johor Bahru and Segamat between 1 January and 31 March 2016 was undertaken. Subjects were chosen via simple random sampling and a sample size of 400 was recruited. The study instrument was a survey form that consisted of three sections: sociodemographic and comorbid profile, validated English and Malay version of the 15-item International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-15) and 21-item Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). The overall prevalence of self-reported ED was 81.5%. The prevalence of ED according to severity was as follows: mild (17%), mild to moderate (23.8%), moderate (11.3%), and severe (29.5%). Multivariate analysis showed that ED was associated with increasing age (odds ratio [OR] 4.023, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.633-9.913), Indians as compared to Malays (OR 3.252, 95% CI 1.280-8.262), secondary as compared to tertiary education (OR 2.171, 95% CI 1.203-3.919), single as compared to married status (OR 6.119, 95% CI 2.542-14.734), and stress (OR 4.259, 95% CI 1.793-10.114). There is significant prevalence and severity of ED among adult male outpatient clinic attendees in Johor. Increasing age, Indian ethnicity, lower educational level, being single, and stress were significant predictors of ED.\n\nMelioidosis: the Johor Bahru experience.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPagalavan, L\n\n2005-12-01\n\nA 5 year retrospective review of cases of melioidosis was carried out in Sultanah Aminah Hospital, Johor Bahru. There were 44 new cases of melioidosis which was proven by either blood or pus culture growing Burkholderia pseudomallei from the period between January 1999 and December 2003. Of these, 38 (86.4%) were males compared to only 6 (13.6%) females. Thirty-one (70.5%) were Malays, 7 (15.9%) were Chinese, 5 (11.4%) were Indians and 1 (2.2%) was a Sarawakian. The peak age group was between 50 and 59 years (31.8%). Out of these 44 new cases, only 32 medical records could be retrieved and analysed. Twenty-four out of 32 patients (75%) analysed had diabetes mellitus, 4 had chronic or end stage renal failure (CRF/ESRF) and only 1 had Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).

This paper presents an evaluation of two methods of population forecasting for housing demand. These methods are Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA and Double Exponential Smoothing (DES. Both of the methods are principally adopting univariate time series analysis which uses past and present data for forecasting. Secondary data obtained from Department of Statistics, Malaysia was used to forecast population for housing demand in Johor. Forecasting processes had generated 14 models to each of the methods and these models where evaluated using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE. It was found that 14 of Double Exponential Smoothing models and also 14 of ARIMA models had resulted to 1.674% and 5.524% of average MAPE values respectively. Hence, the Double Exponential Smoothing method outperformed the ARIMA method by reducing 4.00 % in forecasting model population for Johor state. These findings help researchers and government agency in selecting appropriate forecasting model for housing demand.\n\nA survey of the body image of mastectomies women referring to Imam Khomeini and Imam Hussein hospitals in Tehran, Iran\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nEsmaili Roghayeh; Saiidi Jila; Majd Hamid; Esmaieli Mehrdad\n\n2010-01-01\n\nBackground: Breast cancer treatment may have severe effects on women body image. As a routine care, mastectomy may enhance the risks for anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, and fear of social relationships among women. An awareness of body image changes following mastectomy may promote adaptation among women. Aim: The present study has sought to determine body image levels following mastectomy among females referring to clinics at Imam Khomeini and Imam Hussein Hospitals in Tehran, Iran.

Cross-sectional study. A review of all patients aged over 18 years and with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes for >1 year. The National Diabetic Registry was used as the database for attendees at public health clinics in Johor Bahru between January and December 2013. A required sample of 660 was calculated, and a random sampling method was applied to acquire patient information across the 13 public health clinics in Johor Bahru. All relevant information (e.g. HbA1c, type of treatment and other parameters for glycaemic control) were abstracted from the registry. Sixty-eight percent of 706 patients had HbA1c >6.5%, and mean HbA1c was 7.8%. Younger patients (72.3%) had poorer glycaemic control than older patients (63.0%), and most patients with poor glycaemic control were obese (79.2%). Approximately 31.7% of patients did not achieve the target blood pressure 5 years), body mass index (obese), type of treatment (diet therapy vs combination therapy) and abnormal lipid profile were significantly associated with increased odds of HbA1C >6.5%. More than half (68%) of the patients with diabetes had HbA1c >6.5%. This highlights the importance of providing organized care to manage patients with diabetes in the primary care setting, such as weight reduction programmes, proper prescribing treatment, and age- and gender-specific groups to ensure good glycaemic control.
