        "text": "KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 1 — Lessons from past icons such as the late Tun Hussein Onn helped shape the nation and remain relevant in the modern day, said Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein.\n\nSpeaking at the handover of the Tun Hussein Onn Memorial to the National Archives today, the defence minister said his late father taught him the virtues of honesty, integrity, and commitment.\n\n“These are the foundations of all my aspirations and even those involving the National Transformation 2050 (TN50); these are important lessons to live by that I have learnt from him,” he said.\n\n“I still miss him but I hope to keep his legacy alive; in a trouble-filled world, I’m proud to say even the King of Saudi Arabia, King Salman, acknowledges Malaysia as a reflection of Islam’s true face and moderation,” he added.\n\nHe added that the late Hussein would have approved of Malaysia’s current state and achievements, saying he did not think his father would change anything if he were still alive today.\n\nHishammuddin, who is also special affairs minister, thanked those responsible for the memorial, saying it was a fitting estament to the late prime minister’s contributions to the nation.\n\nThe late Hussein was Malaysia’s third prime minister, governing from 1976 to 1981.\n\nThe memorial is a showcase of the late Hussein’s legacy, collating his works and information about him.\n\nThe 60,500-sq-ft building was built in two years at a cost of RM39 million."
