        "text": "What is Open Access?\n\nOpen Access is an initiative that aims to make scientific research freely available to all. To date our community has made over 100 million downloads. It’s based on principles of collaboration, unobstructed discovery, and, most importantly, scientific progression. As PhD students, we found it difficult to access the research we needed, so we decided to create a new Open Access publisher that levels the playing field for scientists across the world. How? By making research easy to access, and puts the academic needs of the researchers before the business interests of publishers.\n\nOur Authors and Editors\n\nWe are a community of more than 103,000 authors and editors from 3,291 institutions spanning 160 countries, including Nobel Prize winners and some of the world’s most-cited researchers. Publishing on IntechOpen allows authors to earn citations and find new collaborators, meaning more people see your work not only from your own field of study, but from other related fields too.\n\nContent Alerts\n\nBrief introduction to this section that descibes Open Access especially from an IntechOpen perspective\n\nHow it Works Manage preferences\n\nContact\n\nWant to get in touch? Contact our London head office or media team here\n\nCareers\n\nOur team is growing all the time, so we’re always on the lookout for smart people who want to help us reshape the world of scientific publishing.\n\nShahiron Shahidan\n\nTs.

Therefore, this book is intended to serve as a source of information for problems related to bridge engineering including sustainable bridge development, traditional approaches and recent advances in highway bridge traffic loading, aesthetic analysis issues in designing a new bridge, applications of various methods for the dissipation of seismic energy for bridges, new technologies of bridge design as well as structural identification of bridges using non-destructive experimental measurement tests.\n\nGo to the book"
