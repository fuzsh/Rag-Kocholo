        "text": "<strong>Tun</strong> <strong>Hussein</strong> <strong>Onn</strong>: A <strong>Most</strong> <strong>Personal</strong> <strong>Appreciation</strong> I t is a trade secret that in newspaper offices, the obituaries of important personalities are written well before their demise. The all‐important deadline necessitates such a cold and clinical approach. But while such an obituary has its function, it is the tribute from the heart that will always be remembered. And the very personal appreciation that pulls at the heartstrings can only be written by those close to the man himself. Such was the situation former <strong>ISIS</strong> Chairman and CEO Tan Sri Dr Noordin Sopiee found himself in when he wrote this tribute for <strong>Tun</strong>. It was published in The New Straits Times on June I, the day when <strong>Tun</strong> was finally laid to rest. The article was reproduced in <strong>ISIS</strong> Focus Issue No. 64, July 1990. The following is an edited version. I WRITE this article in the quiet of midnight in a secluded San Francisco hotel on the day <strong>Tun</strong> <strong>Hussein</strong> <strong>Onn</strong> passed away (in a hospital in San Francisco) – reflecting on what this man of <strong>Malaysia</strong> had been to his family, to his friends ... and to the country that he so dearly loved and so earnestly tried to serve. It might seem out of place to say it of a statesman, but the <strong>Tun</strong> was probably above all a family man. He was devoted to his home, to his wife Toh Puan Suhaila with whom he shared a rich and full 42 years and to his four daughters and two sons. That bond of love was deeply moving as the family crowded around his death bed in the last critical hours of his life. And each time a member of the family spoke to the <strong>Tun</strong> through his unconscious state, his graph beeped back to life, as if he heard — and wanted to reply. But he could not. In the end, a series of post operation complications took their toll and the <strong>Tun</strong> could fight no more. He went away peacefully — in serenity ‐‐ with the trace of a smile on his face, the slightly upturned lips that his friends knew only too well. The last few hours of the <strong>Tun</strong> bring back to me my first recollections of those days when the <strong>Tun</strong> was a law student in London and his wife was a (From Left) Noordin Sopiee and <strong>Tun</strong> <strong>Hussein</strong> <strong>Onn</strong> radiant, vivacious young woman, sometimes appreciative of a young boy's help in pushing the pram. I remember most vividly a particular Friday in August 1973 when I received a phone call from <strong>Tun</strong> Razak's office asking me to write a quick article 'introducing' the man Razak had decided would be his deputy. 'We're going to appoint him Deputy Prime Minister in three days' time, on Monday. The people hardly know him. `But it's ok, I was told, though I was hardly assured.’ 'We have arranged for you to meet him for dinner tomorrow'. 6 <strong>ISIS</strong> FOCUS NO. 3/2012"
