Online, countless polls have asked Malaysians to \"virtually\" vote for their candidate of choice. But with the palace ruling out a snap election due to COVID-19, it is up to King Sultan Abdullah Ri'ayatuddin to choose a premier he believes can command a majority in the lower house, according to the constitution."
