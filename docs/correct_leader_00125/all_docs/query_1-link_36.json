        "text": "MAJECA and JAMECA were officially launched at a Joint Conference on November 14, 1977 in Kuala Lumpur. Prior to this Joint Conference, two senior representatives of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (JCCI) visited Kuala Lumpur upon the instructions of Dr. Shigeo Nagano, who was then the President of JCCI and Chairman of the Prime Minister’s Council on Foreign Economic Co-operation. The two emissaries met the Director-General of the Economic Planning Unit (EPU), Prime Minister’s Department and discussed the need to promote a closer economic relationship between the private sectors of Malaysia and Japan. The Japanese Ambassador was also actively involved in the exercise.\n\nThe Japanese representatives returned to Tokyo with an agreement in principle that closer economic relations between Malaysia and Japan could be promoted by bringing together the private sectors of both countries through an economic forum. This forum would provide a vehicle for forging close and harmonious economic relationships between the two countries and thus translate into practice what the two Governments have been striving to achieve in their bilateral relations.\n\nThe meeting in Kuala Lumpur between Tan Sri Thong Yaw Hong, the Director-General of EPU, and the two Japanese emissaries paved the way for one of the agreements reached between Mr T. Fukuda, Prime Minister of Japan and Tun Hussein Onn, Prime Minister of Malaysia during the former’s official visit to Malaysia in August 1977. Prior to this official visit, Tun Hussein Onn was briefed by the Director-General of EPU of the visit by the two JCCI officials and of the agreement in principle to set up a private sector forum for the purpose of fostering friendship and promoting close and harmonious economic relations between the two countries. Tun Hussein Onn gave his full support and official blessing to the idea and instructed that the forum should be led by Y.M. Raja Tan Sri Mohar bin Raja Badiozaman, Special Economic Adviser to the Prime Minister.\n\nFollowing the official agreement reached between the two Prime Ministers, the Director-General of EPU convened a meeting of a Task Force chaired by Y.M. Raja Tan Sri Mohar. Other members of the Task Force were representatives of the Malay, Chinese and Indian Chambers of Commerce, the Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers, Perbadanan Nasional Berhad (PERNAS), Petroliam Nasional Berhad (PETRONAS), Malaysian Oil Palm Growers’ Council (MOPGC), the Federal Land Development Authority (FELDA) and the Malaysian International Shipping Corporation Berhad (MISC).\n\nAmongst other matters, the Task Force agreed to the formation of the Malaysia-Japan Economic Association (MAJECA) with its counterpart known as Japan-Malaysia Economic Association (JAMECA), the adoption of MAJECA’s constitution and the appointment of MAJECA’s constitution and the appointment of a Protem Committee.\n\nThe inaugural meeting of MAJECA was held on November 8, 1977 at which the first Executive Committee (EXCO) of the Association was elected. The first EXCO comprised the following:\n\nPresident: Raja Tan Sri Mohar bin Raja Badiozaman\n\nVice President: Raja Khalid bin Raja Harun\n\nHonorary Treasurer: Dato’ Wong Tok Chai\n\nHonorary Secretary: Wan Yusoff Wan Ismail\n\nOrdinary EXCO Members:\n\nMr Geh Ik Cheong\n\nMr Alexander Y.L. Lee\n\nMr Mohd Ramli bin Kushairi\n\nAdviser: Tan Sri Thong Yaw Hong\n\nOn the JAMECA side the first office-bearers and staff were as follows:\n\nPresident : Dr Shigeo Nagano\n\nVice President:\n\nMr Bompei Otsuki\n\nMr Sohei Nakayama\n\nMr Eishiro Saito\n\nSecretary General: Mr Satoshi Sasaki\n\nAdviser: Mr Toshio Doko\n\nExecutive Secretary and Staff:\n\nMr Takaaki Taki\n\nMr Sakamoto\n\nBack to top\n\nMAJECA-JAMECA\n\nMemorandum of Understanding\n\n1.
