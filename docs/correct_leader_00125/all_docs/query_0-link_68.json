        "text": "This paper gives an overview on the development and current practices of building maintenance in Malaysia. The literature review focused on building maintenance and its related concepts including the current practice of building maintenance carried out by institutions of higher education. Maintenance practises for buildings in Malaysia started in the year 1971. However, it became more active in the year 2007 when the government insisted on maintenance management as a new culture for the nation. Findings show that several improvements have been made in few areas including better condition of the government buildings and the better understanding of the practice among the maintenance staff as well as the stakeholders. However, findings from the study on institutions of higher learning show that universities in Malaysia are still managing their facilities in the traditional ways viz-a-viz the corrective, reactive and condition based approach. Among the several problems that were identified, the absence of IT based maintenance management systems seems to be the major factor hindering the development of maintenance culture in institutions of higher learning in Malaysia\n\nWorldwide, the investment in building maintenance is huge as it represents almost 50% of the total turnover of construction activities. Building maintenance is also categorised as the commonest function listed in facilities management activities. This pilot study explores the current practice of building maintenance management in higher education institutions in Malaysia. Information gathered from semi-structured interviews focuses on different areas of building maintenance practices. The main issue is to identify the user-requirements. The areas of study are to cover the objectives of maintenance departments, maintenance reporting processes, maintenance verification processes and other associated tasks. In addition, this study also looks into the contributions of Information Technology (IT) facilities to maintenance practices. Based on the findings, there will be differences in the maintenance practices among the four universities; empirically, of the 57 elements studied only 30% were similar. Some strengths and weaknesses in the maintenance practices were identified and ways in which IT facilities could help to improve the situation. In the future it is envisioned that good building maintenance practices would be the norm in Malaysia to maximise the benefits that users could expect from their buildings and facilities.\n\n\"Maintenance management is an essential aspect in determining the performance and quality of properties such as office buildings. The fundamental issues related to techniques and approaches concerned are generally taken lightly by the practitioners which lead to inefficiency of maintenance management practice in the market today. The paper aims to determine the current standard and performance of maintenance management system by applying the study to high-rise private office buildings. These objectives are to be achieved by evaluating and analysing perceptions of the end users from five (5) high-rise office buildings in Klang Valley by using a mixed method combination of both quantitative and qualitative methods. Research findings signify that the performance of high-rise office buildings are generally rated as average by the end users and results from interviews with the maintenance managers denote the detailed systems applied. There is a positive relationship between the maintenance management systems and performance of maintenance management. This paper provides an important research which uncovered the scenario in the industry and the key perceptions by the building end users. This research is anticipated to be significantly beneficial and can be further used as a piece of information specifying on high rise private office buildings.\""
