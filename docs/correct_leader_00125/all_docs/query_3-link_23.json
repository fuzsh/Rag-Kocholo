        "text": "Universiti of Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM), formally known as Kolej Universiti Teknologi Tun Hussein (KUiTTHO), is a Malaysian higher learning institute, which traces its origins back to 1993 when it was the Polytechnic Staff Training Center. Due to its significant role and contribution in producing qualified polytechnic lecturers and also due to the government’s high level of trust towards the capability of the organization, the training centre was officially awarded the status as a public university in 2000. Thus, the role of the university is not only to fulfill the demands for academic lecturers and teaching instructors of the institutions such as polytechnics, community colleges, and technical schools, under the technical education department of the Ministry of Education in Malaysia, but also to the other public and private technical institutions and training centers. Apart from that, the primary aim of UTHM is to produce graduates, which will fulfill the demand for highly qualified professionals and technocrats in the field of engineering and technology. The university conducts post-graduate, bachelor and diploma level courses in civil, mechanical, electrical engineering and Technical and Vocational Education with specializations in 34 different areas.\n\nFaculty of Technical and Vocational Education (FPTV) is one of the eight faculties in the UTHM and is primarily focusing on TVET teacher training (TT) and education. FPTV is the professional faculty with niche in TT-TVET. The faculty offers a range of quality academically balanced and practical-oriented programmes to meet the changing needs of the teaching and training sectors of the economy.
