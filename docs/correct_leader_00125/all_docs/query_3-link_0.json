In 1946 he joined his politician father Onn Bin Jaafar in forming the United Malays National Organization (UMNO) to further Malay interests in the struggle for independence, but he quit when his father’s multiracial policies were rejected by the party. Hussein studied at Lincoln’s Inn in London, and, after he was called to the bar (1960), he returned to Malaysia to practice law. He rejoined UMNO (1968), was elected to Parliament (1969), and was appointed education minister (1970) and deputy prime minister (1973).\n\nAs prime minister, beginning in 1976, Hussein presided over a generally peaceful coalition with Chinese and Indian parties, despite ongoing racial tensions and trouble with communist insurgents. He also strongly opposed the immigration of Vietnamese refugees to Malaysia, strengthened Malaysia’s role in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and worked to bring Brunei into ASEAN. When heart problems forced him to resign in 1981 he named Datuk Seri Mahathir bin Mohamad as his successor, but in 1988 he supported a rival group’s challenge to Mahathir.\n\nThis article was most recently revised and updated by Encyclopaedia Britannica."
