        "text": "FTUI again received visits from universities in Malaysia. On March 5, 2024, Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM) paid a visit to FTUI. This visit was held in the Smart Meeting Room, FTUI Dean Building. The purpose of UTHM’s presence is to discuss collaboration in academics and research between universities.\n\nThe discussion activity began with remarks from Prof. Dr. Ir. Yanuar, M.Eng., M.Sc. as Vice Dean of Education, Student Affairs, and Research FTUI. Furthermore, this activity was continued with the introduction of the two universities considering that UTHM’s visit was the first time.\n\nIn this activity, FTUI offers cooperation in the form of student exchange mobility and short programs. Meanwhile, UTHM offers academic programs (undergraduate and postgraduate double degree programs); mobility (inbound-outbound and staff exchange); teaching (teaching teams, joint workshops/seminars, and joint certifications); research (joint publications, joint grants, joint supervision, joint panel-course work programs, and joint conferences/competitions); joint supervision; and international excellence checkers. Although many collaboration offers have been submitted, FTUI and UTHM have not been able to cooperate further because there is no general Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).\n\nIn addition to UTHM, FTUI has collaborated first with three universities in Malaysia, namely Universiti Teknologi Petronas (double bachelor’s degree), Universiti Malaya (international examiner), and Universiti Teknologi MARA (research collaboration and matching fund).\n\nDean of FTUI, Prof. Dr. Ir. Heri Hermansyah, ST., M.Eng., IPU., said “We are happy to continue to add networks and collaborate with other universities abroad. Hopefully the MOU between FTUI and UTHM can be made soon so that we can immediately collaborate further.”\n\nThis cooperation visit was attended by delegates from FTUI, namely Prof. Yanuar; Dr.-Ing. Ir. Dalhar Susanto as Manager of Cooperation, Venture, and Alumni; Prof. Ir. Mahmud Sudibandriyo, M.Sc., Ph.D. as Vice Dean for Resources, Ventures, and General Administration; Fadhilah Muslim, S.T., M.Sc., Ph.D., DIC. as Head of FTUI International Office; Kristanti Dewi Paramita, S.Ars., M.A., Ph.D. as Secretary of the Department of Architecture; and Dr. Eng. Arief Udhiarto, S.T., M.T. as Head of the Department of Electrical Engineering.\n\nThe delegation from UTHM consisted of Prof. Dato’ Ir. Ts. Dr. Ruzairi bin Abdul Rahim as Vice Chancellor; Prof. Dr. Shahruddin bin Mahzan Mohd Zin as Deputy Vice Chancellor for Academic &; International; Prof. Ir. Ts. Dr. Mohd Haziman bin Wan Ibrahim as Dean, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Built Environment; Assc. Prof. Ts. Dr. Asmarashid bin Ponniran as Dean, Faculty of Electrical and Electronic Engineering; Assoc. Prof. Ts. Dr. Sasitharan A/L Nagapan as Head of Department, Promotion and International Marketing and International Office; and Mr. Mohamad Reeza bin Abd Patah as Special Officer to the Vice-Chancellor.\n\n***"
