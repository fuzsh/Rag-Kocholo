        "text": "Last week we were lucky enough to participate in the Boulder Technology Summit, coordinated by the Non-Profit Cultivation Center and the United Way. The Tech Summit is a resource for non-profits where technology experts come, share, teach and trouble shoot.\n\nNot surprisingly, we presented on presenting. We discussed the basic dos and don’ts of using visual aids, taught our 20-minute template (a fast and easy way to brand your slides quickly), and trained up our class on using presentation software to create branded documents and marketing pieces. We also took a quick look at Prezi and when it makes more sense than traditional slides – and when it doesn’t!\n\nCheck out the full deck:\n\n**SlideShare doesn’t want to maintain our hyperlinks to supplementary content, like the Prezi, so if you’d like a working copy of your own, please feel free to email me!**\n\nPart of our mission at SlideRabbit is to bring high-quality design to every industry at affordable cost levels. We love and support the non-profit community with lower rates and fixed fee projects. Through our work in this sector, we’ve had the occasion to work with some fantastic organizations around the country. We were so pleased to be able to share our expertise in a hands-on workshop and hope to offer more training in the future. If you’d be interested in presentation-focused webinars, please let us know in the comments or by direct email!\n\nNon-profit or not, contact us today and let’s chat about how we can help you bring your presentations to the next level!\n\nWith sight dominating our senses, it is no surprise that colors have come to hold so much meaning and importance in our culture. Consciously and unconsciously, we use color to signify our feelings: a red rose for our love, a yellow one for a good friend. With colors so closely tied to emotion, and emotion so effectively increasing memory retention, it follows that colors are instrumental to powerful and memorable communication.\n\nWhen selecting a main color for a presentation template, take into account the emotions that the content should produce. Is the material meant to excite the audience, rile them up to a new product that changes the game? Use a bright warm color (red, orange, yellow) to capture the energy of your message. If the material is about a trustworthy medical or financial service, use blues to convey reliability and fortitude. For more ideas on the right colors for your content, check out this awesome infographic from The Logo Company on how brand colors speak to our emotions:\n\nSource: http://thelogocompany.net/blog/infographics/psychology-color-logo-design/\n\nWhether the starting point is a predetermined brand color or a color selected to do some emoting, the next step to building a palette involves color theory. There are several different methods used to combine colors from the color wheel to produce a pleasing look & feel. Here’s a look at the basic color wheel:\n\nDifferent color combination methods, or harmonies, produce a different feel. Here’s a look at some common harmonies:\n\nComplementary & Split Complementary palettes are vibrant and striking. Complementary colors are across the color wheel from each other and provide high contrast.\n\nAnalogous palettes are pleasing to the eye and feel comfortable because they often occur in the natural world, like a sunset of pinks, reds and oranges. Analogous colors are next to each other on the color wheel.\n\nMonochromatic palettes are built by selecting different saturations of the same color. They feel simple and elegant, but lack contrast.\n\nTriadic, Tetradic & Square palettes use simple geometric shapes (triangle, rectangle & square, respectively) superimposed over the color wheel to determine color harmony. These palettes offer rich contrast.\n\nFor quick help selecting the right colors, use an online tool like Adobe Kuler.\n\nThe easiest harmony to execute well is the Split Complementary palette, which is both pleasing to look at and easy to work with. This palette has three main colors, one of which should be dominant. The other two will be used as secondary and tertiary accent colors. Just as we borrowed from photography’s Rule of Thirds for compositional balance, borrow the 60-30-10 Rule from interior design to maintain color balance in the design. Sixty percent of the color on a given slide will be the dominant color – use it for big shapes and common themes. The secondary color should make up about thirty percent of the color, while the tertiary color is used only for small accents to grab attention.\n\nWhether website, marketing collateral or presentation, a good color palette begins to tell the story immediately and subliminally. Evoking emotion through color increases the effectiveness and memorability of the content. Selecting the right color palette for the message and the content is vital to communicating to the audience on both an intellectual and emotional level.\n\nBe sure to connect with us on Twitter or Facebook. Let’s be friends!\n\nThe phrase “Death by PowerPoint” calls to mind endless, text filled slides marching forward as a suit with a clicker drones on to a room full of bored coworkers. I truly believe that, while presentations like this may still take place, this scene is largely a collective memory. The majority of presenters have grasped that cognitive limits demand simple and straightforward information.\n\nThe corporate world is coming to understand that “professional” doesn’t need to mean boring. Text-driven communications are less likely to be retained, if they are read at all. While presentations become simpler and more visual, so must other forms of corporate communications.\n\nEnter Nancy Duarte’s Slidedocs. This ebook discusses the benefits of moving all corporate communications in a more visually compelling direction using presentation software.\n\nWait! You might be thinking, You just said NOT to put a bunch of text on your slides! Correct. While these types of corporate communications might be produced in slide format, they are not intended for the projector. Rather, presentation software serves as an accessible, familiar resource for the everyday employee, empowering even those without a design skillset to begin to communicate more visually.\n\nA case study summary, for example, might typically be produced in MS Word. Word is notoriously cranky about including visual elements and gives only the most basic options for creating them. Once a diagram or image is placed, editing the text near it will cause a headache of formatting issues.\n\nA case study produced in PowerPoint, however, allows the creator much greater control over the layout and display of information, as well as a wealth of options for creating simple informational diagrams like charts, graphs and tables.\n\nUsing presentation software for non-traditional purposes can not only improve the quality of communication, but save costs and time on every day business items. Here at SlideRabbit, we produce all of our external business documents in PowerPoint, including proposals, invoices, terms agreements and the like. This may not be surprising, as we’re a presentation design boutique, but consider that we also have access to the tools typically used to create text-heavy layouts like InDesign and Word.\n\nPresentation software is more accessible to the typical employee than InDesign, which is most often reserved for dedicated print designers. It is more adept at handling the combination of words, images and branding than Word. The templating tools in presentation softwares make the production of standard documents by many employees across the company easily attainable.\n\nWhile some presenters still stubbornly stuff slides with bullets, sub-bullets and sub-sub-bullets, an increasing number understand why projecting a text filled slide actually hurts the presentation. As we, as a society, begin to communicate more visually, our corporate communications are following suit. Presentation software is uniquely suited to creating visual documents and it likely already resides on your computer.\n\nCome hear me present on Pushing PowerPoint Beyond the Slides at the Boulder Tech Summit!\n\nAfter a hugely successful 2013 and start to 2014, we’ve decided that the time has come to look for the right person to join our team! We’re excited to expand and continue to improve our speed and services for our present and future clients.\n\nWe’re looking for a talented designer with a keen eye for branding. This person should be excited about the challenges of pushing presentation software beyond the typical applications and creating high-quality pieces for a range of clientele.\n\nPrefer to work in PJs? That’s A-OK for us as 95% of our work is done remotely. We’re especially interested in finding a new teammate near Boulder, CO or Chicago, IL but candidates from all over the U.S. are welcome to apply.\n\nSince we’re growing, and not yet quite grown, this is a contract to hire position. Get in on the ground floor and grow with us!\n\nDiscover more about the new opportunity here!\n\n…And don’t forget to share with the talented designers in your life.\n\nLast post, we looked at Facebook’s investment in culturally-geared visual communication: a “secret” internal department charged with creating visually powerful cultural propaganda pieces. But will we see visual communication reach beyond internal messaging into the dry and conservative world of public-facing corporate communication?\n\nVia a good friend of mine in the advertising industry, I came across this shining example of where we can only hope that we are headed:\n\nThis is Warby Parker’s 2013 Annual Report which takes corporate storytelling to new heights. Instead of the usual packet of mind-numbingly dense pages of text and numbers, Warby Parker chose to release a more human and relatable look back at 2013. The interactive calendar format contains anecdotal stories of corporate events, company milestones, fun cultural facts illustrated with informational design and, most importantly, lots and lots of imagery.\n\nThis unique piece invites the public inside, giving us an intimate view of Warby Parker and its doings uncommon in the corporate world. Perhaps it’s an extension of the trend towards open and interactive communication that social media has fostered. Or perhaps it’s the continuation of the infographic trend: incorporating informational design into interest-peaking marketing pieces. Perhaps a little of both. Either way, we can hope to see more of these visually interesting and intimate pieces from the traditionally closed ranks of large companies. We’re all for it!\n\nHead over to SlideRabbit.com to learn more about our informational design services.\n\nHigh on our wish list is increased use of visual communication in the corporate sphere, both in internal and external messaging. We’ve previously discussed the engagement, persuasion and information retention benefits of visual communication, but even some of the more tech forward companies are woefully behind in harnessing the power of visual communication.\n\nJust roll on over to Google’s Our Culture page to see what we mean. Sure, there are some photos of Googlers at work or in their home cities, OK. So we see you are global and there are real humans in your offices, just like any other international company. But what makes you tick? What is your collective passion? Who ARE you, Google?\n\nTaking a different, more exciting approach is our other internet overlord, Facebook. Facebook quietly houses an old-school propaganda department that designs and produces culture-focused posters, banners and pamphlets. The pieces produced by the Analog Research Lab are geared toward employees and communicate the Facebook culture and vision with lots of imagery and very few words. We recently got our hands on an internal piece produced by the lab.\n\nHere are some images from the booklet:\n\nOf course, we’re comparing internal to external messaging here, but based on recent Google leaks, it seems that their internal communication is also falling short in the visual arena.\n\nWhether the idea of internal propaganda gives you the heebie-jeebies or not, Facebook’s use of visual communication is inspiring. We hope more companies follow suit in both their internal communications and their external positioning.\n\nCheck out our Corporate Communications page for some suggestions on incorporating visuals into your corporate messaging.\n\nNow that 2014 has dawned, many of us have recommitted to the standard annual resolutions. Perhaps, like so many others, one of your resolutions is to save money in 2014. Design budgets may feel like an indulgence, but don’t cut them out completely. Good informational design makes the presented data and arguments easier to understand and retain, so instead of foregoing it, make a few small changes to make your design dollars work harder.\n\n(If you get Bigger Law Firm Magazine, you saw our recent litigation-specific article, 5 Tips for Successful, Budget-Friendly Trial Demonstratives. If you don’t, click here for a free download of their December Super Issue to check it out!)\n\n1. Finalize Content\n\nIt is a common misconception that edits are largely quick fixes and speedy adjustments; the lion share of unnecessary hours in a typical project is generated by edits. When a design team begins to develop content layout, we first look at everything that needs to be on the slide. A timeline, for example, might be designed one way when it has 3 event markers and quite another when it has 10. By handing the design team only partially final content, you’re essentially asking them to design twice; once for the draft data and then again for the edits, which in some cases necessitate a complete re-concepting of the slide. Though looking at a mock up of draft data can be helpful to your process, if you’re looking to cut out some of the expense, waiting until your content is final is a great place to start.\n\n2. Avoid Unnecessary Illustrations\n\nAnother common hour-packed request is an illustration of an abstract idea or metaphorical theme (we’ve discussed this before). While it’s tempting to supply your audience with a clever illustration of a traffic jam to represent clogged bandwidth or a cartoon sleuth to mark a clue-gathering activity, illustrations like these are often time consuming for the design team. Instead, consider using a high quality photo or some simple iconography to illustrate your point.\n\n3. Collect Source Files\n\nContent for one presentation can come from a variety of sources. When gathering content, make sure those in charge are supplying source files for items within their content blocks. For instance, when incorporating preexisting graphs or diagrams into a presentation, the source files (an Excel with the data, an Illustrator file with original art work, etc.), can save hours of work for your design team. Without these underlying files, your team will need to first remake the item in an editable format. Don’t pay to recreate the wheel.\n\nAs the new year gets underway, many of us recommit to using our money wisely. Great design doesn’t have to break the bank – help your design team come in under budget by making just a few small changes to your work flow; finalize your content, avoid unnecessary illustrations and supply the team with source files to the content within the deck. Remember, you’re paying a design team to help make your ideas and arguments more understandable, so whittle away the “extras” and let your team focus on great informational design of your core data and arguments.\n\nContact us to be pleasantly surprised by how much design bang you can get for your buck."
