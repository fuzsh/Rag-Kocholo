        "text": "You’ve probably got deadlines to hit and want a fast turnaround. That’s why we make getting started as simple as putting a meeting in our calendar. We’ll meet over Teams to understand what you want to achieve, and discuss the best next steps for your project. Easy.\n\nWe’ll show you examples of our previous work that’s relevant to your project, and we’ll introduce the team, including your dedicated Google Slides or PowerPoint presentation designers.\n\nFrom there, we’ll send you a proposal, explaining our costs and all the details, before you make any decisions.\n\nWant to find out more? Get in touch.\n\nWell, that depends. How long will your presentation last? Do you want help with the story, as well as design and animation? How complex – or simple – do you need it to be?\n\nHowever you want the final deliverable to be, we’ll always try to work within your schedule.\n\nFinal delivery can be from as little as 24 hours for simple projects to a few weeks for a more in-depth presentation.\n\nOur specialist presentation designers have years of experience in a huge range of presentation software. We tend to use PowerPoint, Google Slides, Prezi, or Keynote the most, but it really depends on the objectives your company needs to achieve and the platform you’re most comfortable using.\n\nMeanwhile, our presentation designers are masters in the Adobe Suite, flexing their creative muscles in software including Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, XD, and After Effects before we deliver the final file in a format that your team can easily access, use, and edit.\n\nWith this expansive skillset, we can offer the whole package: jaw-dropping presentations that don’t look like presentations, alongside professional supporting assets, such as digital brochures, bespoke video, print documents, and infographics. We’re a full-service presentation design agency.\n\nCheck out our full list of services to find out more.\n\nThe best presentations follow strong themes that are consistent throughout the narrative, design and animation. In most cases, we’d recommend starting your project with a discovery workshop, where we unpick your brand story, your key messaging, as well as get to know your audience and their challenges. This not only help us to create a powerful narrative for your brand, but also allows us to step back and look at the big picture, making sure we recommend the right deliverable, software, and supporting assets to help you reach your goals.\n\nIf you have existing content that you’d like us to use as a starting point, that’s great. But if you’d like us to start from scratch, we can create a complete presentation with the findings from the workshop alone.\n\nAnd, of course, if you’re happy with your company story, we can leave you to it and jump straight to design and experiential development.\n\nTake a look at what we can do for you, whether you provide content, or we create it.\n\nOh yes. Creating personalised presentations, not only in narrative, but in visual style, is totally the right way to make a lasting impression. And it doesn’t have to be difficult.\n\nWe can create composite logo placeholders within your template, so you can simply drop in the logo of your prospective client next to your own and voilà.\n\nOr we could go one step further, and create a design style based on integrating your brand colours with your prospects’ colours. Each time you present, you’d just need to find the colour value of their main brand colour, change the relevant elements within the template, and it will automatically apply to all those slides. Don’t worry, our presentation experts will walk you through it.\n\nAnd of course, we’d love to help each time you confirm a new pitch, and our expert presentation designers will transform your presentation to bring together your brand and theirs. Don’t ask your audience to try and imagine your partnership.\n\nGo one step further, and show them how your product would look with their branding, through image and video mock-ups, bespoke for each prospect.\n\nGraphic design isn’t all about how pretty something is. There’s a methodology and theory to it as well.\n\nOver the last ten years, our specialist presentation designers have honed our presentation services and our design process to get them as close to an exact science as, we believe, is possible.\n\nOur expert PowerPoint design process goes a little something like this:\n\n1. Immersion\n\nWe take the time to deep dive into your brand guidelines, your previous company marketing collateral, your website, or just stuff you’ve seen that you like. Heck, even show us stuff you’ve seen that you didn’t like. It all helps.\n\nOur specialist presentation designers burrow deep into anything you send us, getting to know you before they even get a chance to say hello.\n\n2. Conversation\n\nWe’ve devised a thorough set of briefing questions, designed to get your opinions on how far we can push your brand, what you like, what you don’t like, how you need your company presentation to function, and what you want your audience to feel when they see it. We can even show mood boards at this stage, if you’re the visual type.\n\n3. Initial look and feel\n\nWe’ll take just a small handful of your slides, and apply your brand-new design style to them, giving you the chance to review and make revisions. We just want to make sure you love it, before we go full steam ahead. We can even create multiple design routes at this stage, to give you some options. After all, you might not know what you like until you see it.\n\n4. Roll out\n\nOnce you’re happy with the look and feel, we’ll roll it out across your unique slides within your presentation. At this stage, we’re still working in Adobe XD or Photoshop, and you’ll get another chance to review and give feedback, before we start building your bells-and-whistles professional presentation in PowerPoint."
