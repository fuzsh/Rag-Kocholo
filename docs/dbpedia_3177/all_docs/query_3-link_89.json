        "text": "Hiring a freelancer to help with an assignment can be a significant commitment. You need to be sure when you hire presentation designers that they can do quality work on time and within your budget.\n\nYou should hire a top-notch freelancer, but doing so is not always as easy as it seems. Using multiple platforms or websites means you must learn how to hire presentation designers in different formats. You can save yourself time and energy by using a single site, such as Toptal, to discover word-class talent.\n\nPresentation designers are an expanding sector in the field of graphic design. The growth in the presentation design industry shows that hiring a qualified individual is worth the investment.\n\nExperts expect the entire global graphic design market for the years between 2022 and 2032 could reach over $80 billion. The compound annual growth rate in graphic design has been 3.4%, but analysts foresee the growth accelerating to 5.2%.\n\nReports also discern a notable shortage of skilled professionals in the field. This lack of expertise means the expected growth is likely lower than what is possible. Companies that want to hire presentation designers have to move quickly and make reasonable offers to secure capable professionals.\n\nAnother challenge to hiring freelance presentation designers is in finding someone who keeps pace with the principles of design and innovations in graphical presentations. Virtual reality is an effective presentation and design tool, but newer technologies, such as augmented reality, 3D printing, 4D, and artificial intelligence, are becoming valuable skills.\n\nThis guide can help you overcome the challenges of hiring presentation designers by showing you what they do, when you should hire them, why freelancers are a good choice, and what skills do they need to have.\n\nWhat Does a Presentation Designer Do?\n\nPresentation designers help professionals accomplish their goals by producing an attractive mix of words, images, ideas, and stories into a deck of slides that persuade an intended audience to take some action. Toptal-vetted expert Micah Bowers explains that these experts offer “a practical approach to designing results-oriented presentations.”\n\nWhat does a presentation designer do to help businesses grow? Since businesses invest in tools and team members with the hope of a significant return on investment, Micah states that results-driven talent empower clients “with opportunities to change minds and win business.”\n\nYour presentation designer uses graphic design to formulate a motivating visual layout and traditional storytelling and educational techniques to reach minds and hearts. However, a designer also takes advantage of new trends that present ideas in fresh ways.\n\nAs you hire presentation designers, you will discover the best ones have varying levels of experience with programming languages and coding. Entry-level designers may not know much coding at all, while specialists with more experience pick up knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ajax. These skills can help a designer communicate with developers and understand the capability of a technology to render an idea.\n\nAll presentation designers have experience with some form of media. PowerPoint is a traditional option, but Microsoft also offers Sway. Your designers typically know multiple software solutions to fit the needs of an organization, including Prezi, Google Slides, Keynote, and Canva. Others prefer to work in the Adobe Creative Suite of programs that use powerful tools, such as Photoshop, InDesign, and Illustrator.\n\nA presentation designer often understands something about marketing and psychology. The person selects fonts, colors, images, and videos according to what is most appealing and can trigger a response in an audience.\n\nYour company should hire presentation designers to communicate complex and abstract ideas in a way that is easily digestible for a desired audience. Designers understand which types of color scheme or visualizations, such as charts, graphs, infographics, and scatter plots, will help the audience capture the point of a slide and presentation.\n\nDesigners can also isolate and correct issues with the layout or images. They can determine the ideal presentation length and deliver an excellent product on time.\n\nThe heart of business success is effective communication, internally and externally. Presentation designers are often vital to a company’s success.\n\nWhy Should Someone Hire Dedicated Presentation Designers?\n\nBusiness opportunities are more plentiful than ever, which means you have more competition. Excellent products are not enough to sway customers, job candidates, and colleagues, so hire presentation designers to improve the odds of succeeding with your hard work.\n\nDiscerning individuals expect good design, and the work takes sufficient time. That may not be time that you have free, so efficiency is another answer to why hire a professional presentation design talent.\n\nYour designers offer more flexibility and variety because you will not simply recycle the same templates over and again. Presentation designers for hire can offer you multiple options to choose from so that you do not have to settle.\n\nThey also let you expand your creativity with effective designs you can tailor to your audience for greater engagement.\n\nShould You Hire a Freelance Presentation Designer?\n\nYour business can choose between full-time, part-time, or freelance workers when you are ready to hire presentation designers. Remote freelancers are usually the most cost-effective option.\n\nWith an independent contractor, you secure high-quality talent without the cost or commitment of an employee. Industry turnover and tech layoffs mean that excellent workers are available for businesses to hire a presentation designer.\n\nThe Skills To Look For When Hiring a Presentation Designer\n\nYour ideal presentation designer might find you, so you should post an opening for someone with the relevant skills on your website and available job sites. If you want the quickest way to expert talent, create an account with a site such as Toptal to discover vetted designers at the upper echelon of skill levels.\n\nThe right candidate will have a balance of technical skills and soft skills. Your presentation designer needs to be an expert communicator and have the willingness to learn more about your company and field.\n\nA spirit of teamwork is also necessary. You must hire presentation designers who can collaborate with the team to achieve the overarching goal. Additionally, look for a freelancer with self-motivation, since the person will work with limited supervision.\n\nYou will pay more for a highly skilled presentation designer, but a junior-level person may fill your need. Entry-level designers will not yet have experience in all of the common design software and will need more directions to complete an assignment.\n\nA mid-level individual is fluent in the presentation design process and may know a little about coding. Expert level freelancers understand the entire toolkit and likely have a team under them.\n\nIf you seek to hire presentation designers with top skills, they also have expertise in marketing or sales psychology that directs how they create presentations.\n\nDesigners must have the following skills:\n\nAbility to collaborate with internal and external stakeholders for impactful presentations\n\nDetailed knowledge of common presentation programs\n\nFamiliarity with Adobe Creative Suite programs\n\nExperience in meeting deadlines under pressure and multitasking\n\nA portfolio demonstrating design and aesthetics capabilities\n\nIsolate the necessary skills that a presentation designer will need to fit with your team and use those as an outline for selecting the best candidate.\n\nA Presentation Designers Salary Guide\n\nFull-time presentation designers have an average salary of $72,000. Thus, companies that hire a mid-level talent can expect to pay approximately $35 an hour. Top presentation designers can fetch over $50 an hour.\n\nTips for Writing a Presentation Designer Job Description\n\nTo hire presentation designers, start your job description with the specific job title and include key phrases that presentation designers will search for. Mention the level of experience necessary to complete the assignment. Move into a summary that offers an overview of your organization and what the position requires.\n\nProvide a list of bullet points that express the main responsibilities. Highlight the tasks and expectations that are unique to your company. A breakdown of day-to-day assignments and activities also helps.\n\nCreate a concise list of any other qualifications and skills. Then conclude with the salary range and benefits.\n\nHow To Find Freelance Presentation Designers for Hire\n\nYou can find dozens of sites to hire presentation designers.
