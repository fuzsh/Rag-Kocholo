        "text": "Presentation software is computer software used to present information in a concise and professional format. These programs were designed especially to support course contents with visual elements. Presentations can be designed as slide shows that run on a computer and are projected with a video projector, as overhead transparencies or as 35mm slides.\n\nPresentation software normally consists of an editor to insert and format text, a method for inserting and manipulating images, and a slide-show system to display the contents.\n\nPresentation programs can supplement or replace older visual aid technology, such as handouts, flip charts and posters. Moreover, they offer a wide array of options for incorporating text, graphics, movies and other objects in the presentations. Slides can be displayed on-screen in sequence or can be printed.\n\nRelevance for translation\n\nThis course covers basic and more complex skills that translators should master when using an application like PowerPoint or when translating PowerPointpresentations. It is important for translators to know how to change the structure of a presentation, edit master slides, format headers and footers when translating in case the original format is lost. Also it is essential to know how to track changes and add comments and questions to the slides for reviewers or clients.\n\nTranslators should also know how to use different characters, find and replace text and edit text in placeholders and autoshapes when translating. There are also language functions which are important for translators, such as the use of the spell-check function and the AutoCorrect option. It is equally important to know how to handle text in charts and text boxes (content must also be translated) and edit the data in charts if necessary.\n\nTranslators should also know how to save a presentation in an earlier or in a newer PowerPoint format in case they have to deal with different versions of PowerPoint. Finally, when choosing a translation memory tool, translators should know what type of presentation software files the tool supports and if its interface for translating presentations is user-friendly.\n\nFor further general and specific information on PowerPoint's functions, go to:\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/powerpoint\n\nNext"
