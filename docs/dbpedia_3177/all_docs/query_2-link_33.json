        "text": "Graphics and images can make your presentation more visually appealing, memorable, and persuasive. They can also help you explain complex concepts, illustrate data, and highlight key points. However, you don’t need to be a graphic designer or a photographer to create stunning graphics and images. There are many online tools that can help you design, edit, and enhance your visuals with ease. Some examples are Canva, Pixlr, and Unsplash. These tools offer a variety of templates, features, and resources to help you create graphics and images that suit your presentation’s purpose, theme, and style.\n\nFor my experience, in football or my other work, I use some of the basic tools for presentations. The most important thing for a presentation is to use language that everyone understands. When you work in retail you should focus yourself on results, numbers, but allways giving credits to the good results and a little to the bad results\n\nFor an impressive presentation, using advanced graphic and image tools is key. Tools like Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator are ideal for creating custom graphics and editing images with a professional touch. Canva is another user-friendly option for high-quality designs with templates and stock images. For data visualization, consider tools like Tableau or Adobe Spark to create engaging and informative charts or infographics. These tools can help in visually communicating your message more effectively, making your presentation not only informative but also visually appealing. Remember, well-designed visuals can significantly enhance the impact of your presentation.\n\nI would use Canva, Abode Express which offers a vast array of templates and an easy-to-use interface. However, I recommend using Adobe Express, because It also integrates with other Adobe products like Photoshop and Illustrator that allows the user to create a professional presentation. In need of more advanced Graphic i recommend Adobe Spark, because it uses AI to suggest design layouts that are based on your content. You can also explore a plataform known for its dynamic and non-linear presentation style called Prezi. In Addition you should consider Visme, Slido and also consider to use stock image, vectors like: Adobe Stoke(paid), FreePik(free), Shutterstock(paid) Pixabay(free). That way your presentation will be 100% personalized.\n\nI would say that before we start going into the details like images, graphics, etc. (which I agree are incredibly important), one of the key steps to think through is the actual storyline. At the end of the day, the presentation is a story that is being told to an audience. Determining a few key points such as what does the audience need to know, do, how they should feel, etc. is important. The message and what is being said should be nailed down first. Then, the images, graphics, structure of the presentation will support that message. Some of the best presentations that use a deck have images and very little words. But the message always comes through\n\nOnce you have your graphics and images ready, you need to arrange them on your slides in a way that is clear, consistent, and attractive. You also need to choose the right fonts, colors, backgrounds, and transitions to create a coherent and captivating presentation. There are many presentation design tools that can help you with this task, such as PowerPoint, Google Slides, and Prezi. These tools allow you to customize your slides, add animations and effects, and use themes and layouts to create a professional-looking presentation. They also have features that can help you rehearse, record, and share your presentation online.\n\nTo add to the benefits of these tools, we can get the templates online on sites like Slideago.com related to our topics which brings the attention of the audience to the minor designs and details in the theme which keeps them engaged overall. Such templates can be edited as per our subject and style by the mentioned tools like Google slides or PowerPoint with having the ability to share the access for the team to edit together.\n\nFor an impressive presentation, utilize powerful design tools like Microsoft PowerPoint, Google Slides, or Apple Keynote. These platforms offer a wide range of templates, animations, and design features that can make your presentation visually appealing and professional. Adobe InDesign can be used for more complex layouts and design elements. Prezi is another innovative tool for creating dynamic, non-linear presentations with zooming effects. It's important to choose a tool that aligns with your design skills and the presentation's requirements. A well-designed presentation using these tools can effectively communicate your message and leave a lasting impression on your boss.\n\nThe final step in creating a presentation that impresses your boss is delivering it with confidence, clarity, and enthusiasm. You need to use the right tools to support your speech, engage your audience, and handle any questions or feedback. There are many presentation delivery tools that can help you with this aspect, such as Zoom, Slideshare, and Mentimeter. These tools enable you to present your slides remotely, upload and embed your presentation on websites or social media, and interact with your audience through polls, quizzes, and comments. They also have features that can help you monitor your time, control your slides, and record your presentation.\n\nFor effective presentation delivery, consider tools like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or Google Meet for remote presentations, offering features like screen sharing and interactive elements. For in-person presentations, tools like a laser pointer, clicker for slide control, and high-quality projectors enhance the delivery. Additionally, using speaker notes and practice mode in PowerPoint or Keynote can help you rehearse and refine your timing. For audience engagement, tools like Slido or Mentimeter allow real-time polls and Q&A sessions. These tools aid in delivering a smooth, interactive presentation that can captivate your audience and impress your boss.\n\nStart with you are who you are and not Michael Jordan - your solution must be effective, not breath taking. And now: who is your target audience and how are you going to present (pace to face? over Zoom? upload to a website?) Why? because if it is face to face you can write less words and put more pictures, and icons. If you are uploading a presentation to a website, it must be self explanatory, hence more words (and slides?) are needed. If it is face to face then you can read the body language (and spontaneously skip the boring parts), if it is over zoom you might not see the audience, so maybe more pauses and asking for feedback might be needed. And as to which software? the one that you are most comfortable with.\n\nFirstly, there’s no presentation that should be made to impress your boss or anyone for that matter, presentation is a tool which should be used for storytelling in the most simple yet creative way. While you are at it, make sure that you are extremely clear in terms of ‘What’ is it that you would want to drive on every slide. Secondly, it should flow with ease, meaning each of your slide has to be connected to the previous one as a part of your ‘Story’. Last but the most critical one, the presentation should have your unique essence to it, ask yourself ‘Is this how I want it to be?’ and only when the answer is Yes, you should go ahead with it, with the additional confidence. P.S: Less is more, be very crisp & less texty.\n\nUnderstand your boss first and how they like to consume useful information. Don’t over index on form and ignore the function. Busy presentations are just a frustrating. A picture is indeed worth 1000 words so infographics that tell the story are effective and powerful. Focus on the structure and the points you want to convey then decide what’s the most intuitive way to convey each point.\n\n=> The best 'tool' you have is how you frame and deliver your message with confidence and clarity. That's what will truly make an impression: 1- Define the main goal of your presentation. What action or decision do you want your boss to make after listening to you? 2-Personal connection: Reflect on why you're the one delivering this message. What unique perspective or expertise do you bring to the table? 3- Clarity in Content: Identify the key points you need to communicate and prepare to articulate them clearly and compellingly. 4- Impactful opening and closing: Plan a strong start and finish to anchor your presentation's main objective.\n\nI started in my position January 1st, without any professional experience. I had worked at some minor places such as grocery stores and restaurants. But this, it was the real deal, a professional start. I am hired to be the AI specialist for this company, as I had immersed myself deeply into this realm, out of pure interests. But here's the thing, the plan for me was to give AI trainings and workshops. There I was, 19 years old, giving a 2.5 hour-long presentation. I was nervous, but confident. The lesson here is: be confident. It will be fine, just manifest that you're capable. Practice the delivery of the presentation, even more than the contents. Don't just read out from your mind. Show you're knowledgeability."
