        "text": "My first proper encounter with Microsoft PowerPoint was in the late nineties. After my preferred Adobe Persuasion went defunct (ok, I was an Adobe employee then!), leaving me with no real alternative. It formed the start of a 25-year love-hate relationship with the now-standard virtual slideshow application. I grew fascinated with how effective communicators were leveraging the visual features to get their point across elegantly. On the other end of the spectrum, I also experienced countless presenters struggling with busy slides, flawed narratives, and presentation skills issues.\n\nPowerPoint is about enabling form over substance. It simplifies how we consume data and turns meetings into shows. Eventually, this relegates true collaboration and critical thinking to the sidelines. PowerPoint’s death has been announced many times over these past years. Yet, it’s still here, a reliable default office tool to share information, and its direct competitors have a hard time breaking through."
