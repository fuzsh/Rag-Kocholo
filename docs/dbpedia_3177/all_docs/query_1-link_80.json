        "text": "Winners and Giveaways\n\nThe winners of the last ezine issue's Amazing Skies sweepstakes are Catherine Plunkett (USA), Fasha Hasmad (Malaysia), Jan Yoder (USA) and Jon Spain (UK) - congratulations to all of you.\n\nTommy Powell of Neuxpower is offering four copies of their NXPowerLite compression software for PowerPoint presentations. All you need to do is fill in this form to enter the sweepstakes. Mention \"NXPowerLite\" in the Comments field. The sweepstakes ends on February 10th, 2005.\n\nHere are some new articles and happenings:\n\nPpted just announced the new Grunge & Geometry collection of PowerPoint templates. The entire set is a steal!\n\nNothing can shake up the world of PowerPoint like a good release of Apple Keynote. Michael J. Miller of PC Magazine says: \"This more competitive software from Apple might finally get Microsoft to overhaul PowerPoint\".\n\nRead more in this other blog post. Make sure that you leave your comments on both the blog posts. I'll love to hear what you all think.\n\nPowerCONVERTER XP\n\nPresentationPro created one of the first PowerPoint to Flash based online rich media tools in 2001. The product was released around the same time as PowerPoint 2002 (XP) and did not include support for all the new transitions and animations that the new PowerPoint version introduced.\n\nSince then, PresentationPro released a new updated version called PowerCONVERTER XP for users of PowerPoint 2002 and 2003. The older PowerCONVERTER product is still available for users of PowerPoint 97 and 2000.\n\nPowerCONVERTER XP is priced at US$599. That's not a bargain but it's priced almost the same as other similar tools. Just before I released this ezine, Gary White of PresentationPRO announced a promotion rate of $399.\n\nRead the full PowerCONVERTER XP review here.\n\nPhotoshop for PowerPoint?\n\nProfessional presentation designers who use Microsoft PowerPoint day in and out use one other application more than all other applications combined, and no marks for guessing that the application is Adobe Photoshop.\n\nHere are some things to consider:\n\nThere is a Photoshop plug-in from Ars Media that allows you to export your compositions with layers and transparency intact to a PowerPoint presentation.\n\nThere is a PowerPoint add-in from pptXTREME that enables you to import Photoshop compositions inside PowerPoint, with layers and transparency intact.\n\nMany designers who create PowerPoint presentations use Adobe Photoshop as well.\n\nBoth PowerPoint and Photoshop are cross-platform products.\n\nAdobe discontinued its Persuasion presentation program and none of Microsoft's imaging applications can be yet considered anything close to professional.\n\nSometimes, PowerPoint seems to get along with those PNGs exported from Photoshop even better than Internet Explorer.\n\nFills & Lines - Part V\n\nPart I of this series can be found within issue 48 of the PowerPoint Ezine.\n\nPart II of this series can be found within issue 49 of the PowerPoint Ezine.\n\nPart III of this series can be found within issue 50 of the PowerPoint Ezine.\n\nPart IV of this series can be found within issue 51 of the PowerPoint Ezine.\n\nPowerPoint’s Lines\n\nPowerPoint provides an amazing diversity of options in creating and editing lines. Look at these samples.\n\nUnlike fills, line styles don’t require a closed area like a rectangle, circle or a background, they can be used in shapes that do not close like lines, drawings and arrows.\n\nTo apply or edit a line style:\n\nSelect the element (shape, drawing, line, etc.)\n\nChoose a color for the line from the Line Color menu on the Drawing toolbar.\n\nChoose a Line style from the Line Style menu on the Drawing toolbar. Choose More Lines if you want to tweak beyond the presets available.\n\nChoose a dash style from the Dash Style menu on the Drawing toolbar if required.\n\nChoose an arrow style from Arrow Style menu on the Drawing toolbar if required. You can choose the More Arrows option if you want larger or smaller arrowheads.\n\nPatterned Lines\n\nPatterned lines allow you to create lines with the same patterns used within the Pattern Fills options. Patterned lines look good only if you use lines with at least 10 point thickness and are ideally suited for creating quick frames for inserted pictures in PowerPoint.\n\nThis is the concluding part of this series.\n\nEnd Note\n\nMore PowerPoint related info on the PowerPoint Blog and PowerPoint Notes. And PowerPoint templates for all of you.\n\nUntil next time - have a nice day. And keep the feedback coming."
