        "text": "Are you ready to make visual presentations?\n\nI’m so happy to hear that!\n\nIf I had to sum up the cause of #DeathByPowerpoint in a few words it would be: Too much text, too few good visuals.\n\nIf you’re an academic, scientists, or educator who wants to make better presentations, then you need to use good visuals in your presentations.\n\nUsing great visuals is one of the easiest and most effective ways to get your audience to:\n\npay attention\n\nunderstand\n\nremember, and\n\nuse the information you share.\n\nGiant walls of text do not help you achieve any of those goals.\n\nHi! I’m Dr. Echo Rivera and I help academics, scientists, and educators create engaging presentations.\n\nAlthough this post is exclusively about visuals, it’s important that you reduce the amount of text you have on your slides, so you have room for great visuals.\n\nBut you probably know that presentations need visuals, right? That’s why you’re here, reading this post.\n\nSo here’s something you might not know: It’s not just about having any visual in your slides—you need to have good visuals.\n\nA bad visual doesn’t achieve those goals, either.\n\nLet’s talk more about the difference between good vs. bad visuals, and then I’ll share ideas for 7 types of visuals you can use in your presentations.\n\nGood visuals vs. bad visuals—what is the difference?\n\nA good visual is one that makes it more likely for you to achieve those above goals.\n\nWhat goals, you ask? Getting your audience to pay attention, understand, remember, and use your information.\n\nA bad visual is one that makes it less likely for you to achieve those goals.\n\nSounds easy enough, right?\n\nLet’s talk specifics.\n\nVisuals DON’T make an impact when they are:\n\nToo small\n\nDistorted\n\nFormatted or cropped improperly\n\nDistracting\n\nForgettable (aka “meh”)\n\nA mismatch with the slide content\n\nEvoking the wrong emotion\n\nI’m guessing you’re nodding your head in agreement. All of those things sound like they would hurt your chances of making an impact, right?\n\nWell, most academics, scientists, and educators are using visuals that don’t make an impact. That includes me, several years ago.\n\nChances are high that you are, too, and you don’t even realize it.\n\nMost people think I’m talking about things like cheesy stock photos.\n\nAnd, they’re not wrong—those are bad visuals.\n\nBut during my presentation workshops, professionals are always shocked at the examples I provide of “bad” visuals.\n\nMany participants share that some of their favorite visuals are on my list of visuals to avoid.\n\nExamples of bad visuals:\n\nPowerPoint SmartArt\n\nWord clouds\n\nSlide template designs\n\nMost modern forms of vector/digital clip art\n\nBubble people\n\nHumans coming together to form shapes\n\nDisembodied hands shaking\n\nCheesy stock photos\n\nDid you see something on the list that you use?\n\nDon’t feel embarrassed. I’ve used every single one of those visuals in my presentations before.\n\nHow were we supposed to know what visuals to use in our presentations? It’s not like we get trained on this in grad school!\n\nPlus, until 2014 or so we had one of two options:\n\nPay a lot of money for cheesy stock photos of white people, or\n\nUse Office clip art and PowerPoint SmartArt.\n\nSo, I’m not making fun of you (it’s not my style). I just want to make sure you’re able to go through your presentations and delete the bad visuals you have in there.\n\nI’ll focus on one as an example: word clouds.\n\nI remember when I first saw word clouds. I thought they were the coolest things ever. I used them every chance I could.\n\nUntil I realized they were just a way to cram even more text into my slides.\n\nTake a look at this slide with a word cloud:\n\nSlide templates are never the solution. They will never help you end #DeathByPowerpoint, and one of the first things to do when you’re ready to make better presentations is to stop using them.\n\nAnd PowerPoint SmartArt is a type of template—you shouldn’t use those either. I’ve written an entire blog post (with before and after makeovers) about why PowerPoint’s SmartArt is not a good visual.\n\nIt’s really important to consider all of the elements on your slides and only keep the ones that help achieve our key goal (getting our audience to pay attention, understand, remember, and use the information we share).\n\nOk. Enough about bad visuals, let’s talk about good ones!\n\nVisuals DO make an impact when they are:\n\nBig enough\n\nFormatted properly\n\nMemorable\n\nA match with the slide content\n\nEvoking the right emotion\n\nNow that you have an idea of good vs. bad visuals, let’s talk about 7 types of visuals you can use in your presentation.\n\n1. Use stock photos for your presentation slides\n\nWhen I’m giving a presentation training workshop, I ask people what types of visuals they should avoid, and a lot of them say “stock photos!”\n\nI see where they’re coming from. The term \"stock photo” has become synonymous with “cheesy stock photo of white people smiling at the camera.”\n\nThat’s because, until 2014 or so, that’s what stock photos were.\n\nBut things have changed. A lot.\n\nAnd for the better.\n\nSo erase everything you thought you knew about stock photos and let’s start from scratch.\n\nAll “stock photo” means is that it’s a photograph taken by someone else, so others could use it for something.\n\nThat’s it. That’s all it means.\n\nAnd stock photos are the #1 type of visual you should use in your educational presentation.\n\nAs of 2021, is actually pretty easy to find stock photos that are:\n\nFree\n\nHigh quality\n\nMemorable in a good way (i.e., not cheesy or forgettable)\n\nHere are four examples of how I’ve used stock photos to create engaging presentation slides.\n\nThese are actual slides I’ve used for either educational presentations, doing before/after makeovers, or when sharing evaluation data results.\n\nTip: Royalty free does NOT mean free to use\n\nI've noticed that a lot of people incorrectly use the terms \"royalty free\" as interchangeable with \"cost free.\"\n\nRoyalty free means you don't have to pay the creator each time you use it or make money from it, but you usually still have to pay for the initial license.\n\nCost free or free to use means you never had to pay for it, but there may be other license requirements, like giving credit (attribution) every time you use it.\n\nTip: Copyright still applies to you even when you use photos for non-profit, educational purposes\n\nA lot of researchers, academics, and scientists think that just because they're using photos for education (i.e., non-profit use), they're exempt from copyright laws.\n\nOr, they know the law applies to them but think copyrighted pictures are considered under “fair use.”\n\nBig NOPE.\n\nTip: Stop using Google Images to find stock photos\n\nMost people are still using Google Images to find stock photos, so I need to talk about that for a second.\n\nUsing Google Images is actually one of the slowest, least efficient ways to find stock photos for your presentations.\n\nIt’s also the most risky in terms of copyright violations.\n\nI describe a faster and safer way to find visuals and to create what I call a Visual Database.\n\nIf you feel like it takes you forever to find visuals and/or add them to your presentations, then make sure you read that blog post next.\n\n2. Use icons for your presentation slides\n\nIcons are one the easiest and fastest ways to add visuals to your slides. They’re a great place to start if your slides are mostly text.\n\nYou can find icons at flaticon.com, but I just use PowerPoint’s built-in icons.\n\nThere are tons of them, and they all meet the modern standards for good icons. That’s important because if you aren’t careful, your icons will start to look like clip art.\n\nYou want clean, simple, and modern icons—that’s exactly what the built-in icons in PowerPoint are.\n\nI use them to accompany large numbers or single percentages. This isn’t real data here, just a mock up I made for a blog post about how to visualize this type of data.\n\nOne reason I love PowerPoint icons so much is because it’s easy to do some “icon hacking” and make them even better. The visuals you see above are a combination of PowerPoint icons.\n\nIf you have not tried using PowerPoint icons, then I strongly encourage you to start using them in your next presentation.\n\n3. Use your own photos for presentation slides\n\nI see a lot of people using stock photos, so you probably already knew about them.\n\nOne thing I rarely see is presenter's own photos, and that's a huge missed opportunity.\n\nSome of the best photos I use are ones I took myself.\n\nAnd, no, I'm not an expert photographer and many of my photos would not look good on a slide. But, when I do take a gem, I try to use it in my slides.\n\nOne of my favorite examples is this pic I snapped of my two dogs -- Biscuit (left) and Sage (right) -- that I used to explain inter-rater reliability to a group of practitioners.\n\nMYTH: I can’t do this because I suck at drawing\n\nGood!\n\nYour audience doesn’t want to see an elaborate masterpiece on the slide, anyway.\n\nThe scrappier the drawing, the better.\n\nMYTH: I can’t do this because I’m not “a creative”\n\nFirst of all, you are absolutely creative.\n\nSecond, not that it matters because it doesn’t take any creativity to draw a square or a stick figure saying something.\n\nFinally, being able to take your text-heavy slides and create your own visuals for it is a skill that you can develop with training, support, and practice.\n\nMYTH: I can’t do this because it’s unprofessional\n\nYeah? Says who?\n\nBecause in my experience, audiences LOVE when the presenter uses their own drawings.\n\nI mean, yeah, don’t do this for your job talk. But other than that, go for it.\n\nLook. This whole myth of \"being professional\" seriously gets in the way of my peaceful protest against #DeathByPowerpoint.\n\nHand drawings are more likely to catch the attention of your audience than a great stock photo or any other type of visual.\n\nThey’re also fantastic at helping your audience understand and remember the material.\n\nI'm still waiting for a legitimate argument that being ineffective and boring at presenting is somehow professional.\n\nMYTH: I can’t do this because I don’t have professional software or can’t afford Adobe Illustrator!\n\nGood news: You can draw directly in PowerPoint!\n\nAlso: We don’t use Adobe Illustrator.\n\nWe use the MUCH more affordable (and easier to use) app called Affinity Designer (bonus: members of my course get a discount on it, too).\n\nExample drawings and illustrations\n\nSometimes, it's impossible to find a visual that works for your slide.\n\nWhen it's an important point you want to make, or when you want to connect/resonate with your audience, then your own doodles can come to the rescue.\n\nHere is a very simple set of 2 slides. I was making the point that watching presentations—even if they’re really great presentations—does not effectively teach you how to create effective presentations.\n\nI drew a couple stick figures, then added speech bubbles.\n\n5. Use emotion-focused Gifs on your presentation slides\n\nGifs are a great way to add some fun and surprise in your presentation. Use a gif when you want to evoke an emotion from your audience.\n\nFor example, use gifs when you want your audience to laugh out loud.\n\nMaybe you know you’re going to tell them something they don’t want to hear. Something that might be hard and will conflict with what they’ve heard before.\n\nYou can use a funny gif to both lighten the mood while also letting them know you understand them.\n\nWhat you would do is state the information upfront, and then maybe you use a gif like this (below) to say something like “I know! I know what you’re thinking. This conflicts with what you’ve heard before. Hear me out.”\n\nIf you can get them to laugh (while showing them you understand them), they’ll be more likely to hear your difficult message.\n\nUse gifs when you want the audience to understand how YOU feel (or felt).\n\nFor example, maybe you hypothesized that X would happen, but Y happened instead. Or, maybe you designed your study one way but then something happened where you needed to change the design.\n\nOr, maybe this isn’t your study, but instead you’re teaching students about research others have done.\n\nGive your audience a visual clue about whether that is:\n\nAmazing news!\n\nFine.\n\nNot great, but also not the end of the world.\n\nA complete and utter disaster that made you (them) want to burn it all down.\n\nThere are gifs for all of the above.\n\nNot only will using gifs for this purpose humanize the information you’re sharing, it will be memorable. If you can ignite your audience’s emotions while sharing educational information, they are much more likely to remember it later on.\n\nUse gifs when you want to let the audience know you understand how they feel right now (or give them a cue about how they should feel about the information you just shared).\n\nFor example, a lot of people are worried that visual presentations are “unprofessional” or they will be called unprofessional for having a lot of visuals.\n\nSo, to debunk that idea, I go into detail (with examples) of what a “professional” presentation would be, then. After going through all the detail and showing the audience terrible slides, I end with this gif:\n\nI had absolutely no idea what this meme meant and, even after looking it up, didn’t quite understand how to use it properly.\n\nI was missing something, I didn’t get it.\n\nAnd I loved the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) movies! But, I missed a handful as they were coming out, including the movie that meme is from.\n\nIt wasn’t until COVID-19 hit and we decided to watch all of the movies, that I finally saw this scene and understood the meme.\n\nSo, go ahead and still use a meme. Just do your best to make sure it:\n\nisn’t too outdated\n\ndoesn’t require background knowledge*\n\n*if that background knowledge isn’t the point of your presentation and if you won’t be explaining it in another way\n\n7. Use videos on your presentation slides\n\nFinally, you can use videos in your presentations.\n\nYou can show:\n\nVideos found online (YouTube, Vimeo, Tik Tok, etc)\n\nRegular video files\n\nI don’t show videos from the internet during my presentation, and I strongly encourage clients to avoid this when possible.\n\nWhen you plan on watching a video from the internet during your presentation, you’re:\n\nSlowing down the momentum of your presentation\n\nAssuming the internet connection will be stable enough to show the video\n\nAssuming there will be internet at all\n\nSure, you could download the video from YouTube and embed it into your slides…but that’s actually kind of rude to do. When you do that, the YouTube creator does not get those views, and views are really important to YouTube creators.\n\nIf you need people to watch a YouTube video (or some other video found online), consider having them watch it from home before or after your presentation.\n\nSo how do I use videos?\n\nI create my own and then embed them into the presentation.\n\nI do this a lot when I want to include a quick step by step tutorial in my presentation. I do it in a lot of my YouTube videos, and I do it during live presentation workshops.\n\nWhat I do is I’ll create a short screencast video ahead of time and add that video into PowerPoint.\n\nThen, during the presentation, I’ll narrate as the video plays.\n\nThis allows me to:\n\nKeep up the momentum of my presentation\n\nEnsure I don’t forget an important step\n\nAvoid the risk of running into a glitch while doing it live\n\nContinue using PowerPoint’s live subtitles features, even when showing how to use another program"
