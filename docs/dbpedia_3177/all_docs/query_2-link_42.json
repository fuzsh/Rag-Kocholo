        "text": "PowerPoint was one of the first tools to offer easy-to-use, customizable templates—a major plus for non-designers. But design-wise, PowerPoint isn’t the most engaging platform or presentation software. Your business presentations will lack the impact you desire, leading to monotonous presentations few enjoy seeing. No one wishes to see your next slide—they already know it has three bullet points.\n\nTo create a powerful, dynamic presentation, you need software with rich media capabilities. And when you use presentation software with features other than just adding images and text, you increase your chances of holding your audience’s attention throughout your entire speech. The challenge is that higher-quality presentations don’t equal more ROI unless you know how to use the software.\n\nThe following are 14 presentation software alternatives to PowerPoint. All but one are easy to learn and provide distinct features to solve various needs, making each the best presentation tool for a specific purpose.\n\nTry Vyond for Free\n\n14 Presentation Software Essential For Any Team\n\n1. Prezi Present: Best for non-linear presentations\n\nDesign library: 200+ templates for several industries and needs.\n\nShareability: You can send revocable share links to team members or friends for feedback. You can add collaborators with an email associated with a Prezi account to co-create a presentation.\n\nCost: The price varies depending on the number of projects you want to create and the functionalities you require. There is a free plan, a Plus plan for $15/month, and a Premium one for $19/month.\n\nCompatibility: Prezi’s desktop app with offline access works on Windows and Mac. You can also use the Prezi Viewer app to view, present, and share (but not edit) presentations on your IOS or Android devices.\n\nPrezi lets you create a non-linear story, meaning you don’t have to go from slide A to B to C. Instead, you can jump straight into the section that interests your audience the most and avoid boring them with other data.\n\nPrezi’s interactive presentations continuously prompt viewers to keep watching. For example, you can first share a bird’s-eye view of what the presentation will cover as an introduction. Then, you can zoom in to specific topics to further teach your audience about a problem, new product, or idea.\n\n2. Vyond: Best for engaging animation-based presentations\n\nDesign library: 182 fully customizable templates. They’re not your typical static slide templates. Instead, they’re story-driven templates you can use to create engaging presentations.\n\nShareability: Teams can work on the same project simultaneously. You can also work together asynchronously by uploading assets, custom templates, and characters into each project.\n\nCost: The basic plan starts at $25 a month on an annual plan. For $83.25 a month, you can access Vyond’s entire suite of tools, export formats (GIF vs. MP4), resolutions, and animation styles.\n\nCompatibility: Vyond is a browser-based software you can access via Windows and Mac.\n\nAccording to Kaltura, 98% of enterprise professionals think videos are better and faster at training employees. You can use Vyond to create engaging animated video presentations in a format proven to increase learning retention. Its animated elements will help persuade viewers to watch what you present instead of the latest celebrity news.\n\n3. Zoho Show: Best for teams that don’t care about fancy design\n\nDesign library: 59 free templates built for businesses across industries.\n\nShareability: You can collaborate in real-time with teammates, tag them to notify them of a change you just made, and comment on areas that need some context.\n\nCost: Free.\n\nCompatibility: Zoho Show works on all Android and Mac devices, from laptops to phones to TVs.\n\nZoho Show is presentation software that uses an uncluttered interface so you can focus on organizing your ideas.

However, you can customize the color of the video player, the thumbnail, and your video’s page with your logo.\n\nShareability: Anyone with a link to your video can see it. Since recordings happen in real-time, there’s no way to collaborate unless a teammate sits next to you.\n\nCost: Free for teams with basic needs, like recording and sharing videos. Starting at $300 a year, you’ll be able to track how viewers interact with your videos and book meetings straight from them.\n\nCompatibility: You can record Soapbox videos from Windows and Mac. Anyone with a smartphone or PC can watch them.\n\nSoapbox is a presentation software you can access from your browser. You can use it to record yourself, your computer screen, or both.\n\nIt takes just two clicks to record, making Soapbox ideal to create product or content videos in bulk. For example, you can organize your background, write a list of topics on a piece of paper, and then record videos for many departments, such as sales, HR, and marketing.\n\nUnlike other tools, you won’t have to create slides or charts. You can hit record and cover the topic from your seat.\n\n6.

It integrates with iOS apps and devices to create presentations faster. For example, you can add colors and comments to presentations using your iPad’s Apple Pencil.\n\nThe ability to turn Keynote files into PowerPoint presentations allows Mac lovers to cooperate with teammates on the platform each one likes the most. Its similarity with PowerPoint and Google Slides also allows for a simple transition between presentation apps.\n\n9. SlideDog: Best for those indecisive about which software to use\n\nDesign library: SlideDog doesn’t offer a template or design library.\n\nShareability: The audience can see SlideDog slides, ask questions, share feedback, and answer polls directly from their device.
