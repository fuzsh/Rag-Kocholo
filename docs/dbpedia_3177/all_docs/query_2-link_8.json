        "text": "I have some old Files .PPF (thats what is after the File ) they are a Sort of powerpoint file for teaching , but included with the Files in same folder is a Text file that talks about Adobe Persuasion Player .\n\nanyway I have Googled this but cannot find anything related to how to open these Files ..\n\nI have Office 2008 for mac and it tries to open with powerpoint But that does not Work .\n\nDoes anyone Know how to open or Convert these file or what program I can get to open these files.\n\nI have several teaching notes on different topics all using this system so would be Useful to open them again ..\n\nthanks for help\n\nAdobe Persuasion was a presentation program like PowerPoint many years ago. Persuasion Player was a read-only version of the program that was available for free to play back slideshows created in the full version of Persuasion.\n\nPersuasion and Persuasion Player were Classic apps, and won't run under Leopard.\n\nIf you can find a copy of either Persuasion or Persuasion Player, you could run it under Mac OS 9, or in Classic mode under Tiger or earlier. If you can find a copy of the Windows version of Persuasion or Persuasion Player, you could probably still run that under XP on a PC. The problem is finding a copy, since the program has not been sold or updated for over ten years.\n\nHi\n\nYes I sort of found out that it was older software , as I have had it since 2002 ,\n\notherwise is there some software out there that I could use to convert it into another format to use on Mac or even windows ( i have Vista on Bootcamp )\n\nas it is really useful teaching tool and I a about to start teaching that subject again ..\n\nThanks mark\n\nHi there,\n\nI have a suggestion for this kind of situation, you can use, Crossover an application which enabling you to run M$ Windows application under MacOS.\n\nSo what I'm doing is, I run Adobe® Persuasion® Player 3.0 Windows version using Crossover on my Leopard. and it is working nicely."
