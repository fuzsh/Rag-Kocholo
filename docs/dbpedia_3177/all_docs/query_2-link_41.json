A few years after inception Lumen5 is now a stronger software with more features to support their original idea.\n\nLumen5 is a cloud-based video presentation software.\n\nThe Interface\n\nThe Lumen5 interface is simple and easy to grasp. There are two very similar interfaces, one that has a content tab for when you upload a blog post or long text and the interface to use with templates. The only difference is the content tab.\n\nText layouts have limited customizations for placement and animation. All animations are automatic but can be personalized to some extent.\n\nVideo proportions can be changed into all social media sizes easily and all the content rearranges itself automatically. There are no undo-redo controls.\n\nAvailable Templates\n\nThe Lumen5 software offers a number of templates to start with. There aren’t a ton of options, but enough to get you started. Every template has various size versions so the complete template gallery looks bigger than it really is.\n\nAvailable Visuals\n\nThe visuals available in Lumen5 consist of stock images and video clips. Depending on your subscription level, you can access up to 330M stock photos from Getty and Shutterstock.\n\nYou can upload images, video and audio from the desktop or straight from your phone.\n\nData Visualization\n\nThere are no data visualization capabilities in Lumen5.\n\nBranding\n\nAll paid plans have branding options like fonts, music and a branded outro.\n\nAudio Capabilities\n\nThere are many music audio clips available in the software and you can upload your own audio clips too. Users can also add their own voiceover to their presentation.\n\nLength Limit\n\nLumen5 videos cannot be any longer than 10 minutes, regardless of your plan.\n\nVideo Output\n\nAll videos are downloaded as MP4, in horizontal, vertical or square formats. They can be embedded or shared to Facebook.\n\nThe quality of the video depends on your subscription plan.\n\nPricing\n\nApart from their free plan, Lumen5 has four paid plans. Pricing is as follows:\n\nBasic: $19/month\n\nStarter: $59/month\n\nProfessional: $149\n\nEnterprise: Upon request\n\nWho is Lumen5 For\n\nLumen5 is perfect for content creators that want to create videos from their blog posts. Also for those who post a lot of content on Facebook, the integration is quite seamless.\n\nThis video presentation software is also for people who don’t want to be fussing with too many tools and want things done fast.\n\n3 Biteable\n\nBiteable markets their video creation software as a marketing video maker. Nevertheless, the horizontal format on Biteable also works well as a video presentation.\n\nBiteable is a cloud-based video presentation software.\n\nThe Interface\n\nUsing the Biteable 3.0 editor is easy and straightforward. The tools for editing fonts are simple with the ability to change the font, size and color. The animation of the text is done per slide so you can’t animate one piece of text one way and another in a different way.\n\nThe video editor is separated into text, footage and music tracks. You can edit the footage by trimming.\n\nThere are no undo and redo controls.\n\nAvailable Templates\n\nBiteable offers hundreds of pre-designed video templates to start with. Additionally, from inside the editor, you can access a library of video slides. We’re big fans of the claymation explainer animated slides.\n\nAvailable Visuals\n\nThe image and footage library has thousands of ready to use photos and clips. Most are from Unsplash—the same photo library you already get access to with Visme.\n\nData Visualization\n\nThere are no data visualization tools available in Biteable.\n\nBranding\n\nEasily add a watermark, upload fonts and use hex codes for colors. However, there isn’t a set Brand Kit.\n\nAudio Capabilities\n\nThe Biteable software offers stock audio and you can upload your own.\n\nLength Limit\n\nBiteable has a maximum video length limit of 10 minutes.\n\nVideo Output\n\nVideos can be shared online or downloaded as Mp4 HD and full HD. Both are available on paid plans.\n\nPricing\n\nThe free plan only lets you create videos. In order to download, you’ll have to upgrade to one of the plans. Their pricing is as follows:\n\nPro: $49/month\n\nTeams: $99/month\n\nWho is Biteable For\n\nBiteable is for content creators that work mostly with social media.\n\n4 Animaker\n\nThe Animaker video presentation software has lots of tools and resources to make complex videos of any type. Choose between animated videos and live-action videos.\n\nThe video editing controls are more elaborate than on other programs and the character animation options are extensive.\n\nThe Interface\n\nAnimaker has two interface options, a full and a lite version. The full version has all the tools on hand to create scenes, animated character options, frame editing and more.\n\nThe lite version is a simplified editor window for users who don’t need to have all the tools available at all times. Switching from one to the other is easy.\n\nThere are no undo-redo options.\n\nAvailable Templates\n\nAnimaker has millions of templates in both animation and live-action formats. Before starting a video creation, select from the template sizes.\n\nOnce inside the editor, all the other templates in the same size are also available through the magic box tab.\n\nAvailable Visuals\n\nThere are millions of images and video clips, shapes, icons, designed text layouts, plus animated video clips, customizable characters and animated scene effects.\n\nData Visualization\n\nThere are no data visualization tools available.\n\nBranding\n\nThe software has a simple brand kit in the user dashboard. Animaker brand kits include an animated character, and an intro/outro set. Assets are available in the editor.\n\nAudio Capabilities\n\nVideos can have music or voice-overs recorded with the user’s computer microphone. The media library has many audio files to choose from, organized by category and style. Audio files can also be uploaded.\n\nLength Limit\n\nFree plans can create videos up to 2 minutes in length.

What Is a Video Presentation?\n\nA video presentation is a dynamic and engaging method of delivering information to an audience. It involves using moving visuals and sound to explain concepts, promote ideas or convey messages.\n\nUnlike traditional text-based presentations, it uses graphics, animations, voiceover, music and video clips to create an interactive and engaging experience.\n\nQ. How Do You Make a Presentation Video?\n\nMaking a video presentation involves several steps. Initially, you should clearly define your topic and objectives, then create a storyboard or script detailing what you plan to say and show. Use this as a guide when filming or recording the video.\n\nChoose a reliable video editing software from the list we provided in this article. These tools will help combine your visuals, add audio or voiceover, include transition effects and arrange the video clips in a logical sequence.\n\nRemember to review thoroughly and edit where necessary. Once you're satisfied with your video presentation, export it into an appropriate format that suits your distribution channel.\n\nQ. Why Make a Video Presentation?\n\nVideo presentations are especially effective for capturing and retaining the audience's attention. They make complex topics more digestible by breaking information into chunks, accompanied by appropriate visuals.\n\nAlso, you can access them remotely, reaching a wider, potentially global audience. Video presentations can effectively communicate emotions, making your message more persuasive and impactful.\n\nQ. What Should Be Included in a Video Presentation?\n\nA successful video presentation should always be thoughtful, engaging and impactful. Here are some of the critical components of a good video presentation:\n\nClear Objective: Outline your core message from the start. It sets the course of your entire presentation.\n\nEngaging Script: Craft a script that's clear, concise and appealing to your audience.\n\nRelevant Visuals: Use relatable images, graphics or videos to support your message and help your content attract viewers.\n\nQuality Audio: Ensure your audio (voiceover, dialogue, or music) is clear. Poor-quality audio can ruin the viewing experience.\n\nSmooth Transitions: Connections between segments or slides should be logical and seamless to avoid disrupting the flow.\n\nCall to Action: Include a call to action to guide your audience to their next step, like visiting your site, attending an event or buying a product.\n\nCreate Your Own Video Presentation With Visme’s Video Presentation Software\n\nAs you can see, there are many options to help you create a video presentation.
