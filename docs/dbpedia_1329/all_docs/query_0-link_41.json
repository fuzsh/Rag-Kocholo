        "text": "Composed in 1850, Robert Schumann's cello concerto in A minor Op. 129 is nowadays considered as one of the masterpieces of the instrument's repertoire, but the piece took a long time to achieve this prestige among critics and performers. It was composed in a span of two weeks, but only published after four years and first performed only in 1860, four years after the composer's death. It is the first cello concerto by a major composer since Joseph Haydn, but it is also very innovative for the genre, not only because of its continuous form (without breaks between movements) but also for the composers option to deviate from the typical bravura concert pieces, establishing the lyrical character of the instrument that would be explored by future composers. In order to contest the common sense that Schumann's late works are faulty because of the composer's mental illness, previous works by other composers and by Schumann himself will be pointed as possible sources of inspiration for the concerto as a proof that the composer's experimentations were intentional and not a result of a weak mind condition. This research is based on works that portrait the trajectory of Schumann as a composer (especially his last years in Düsseldorf), analysis of the relationship between the concerto and previous works, discussions about the impact that this cello concerto had in the history of the genre, as well as recordings and scores of the piece.\n\nThe reception during his life of Robert Schumann’s early piano music is a rare case of rejection, both by critics and public, as well as by friends and family. Regardless of his numerous professional contacts, and continuous efforts to spread his music, Schumann was systematically marginalized during his first years as a composer. This paper makes a review of such reception, relying on documents that testify to the difficulties he encountered trying to establish his piano music as part of the standard repertoire.\n\nThis paper aims at examining and defining the role and function of contrapuntal techniques and polyphonic episodes in the overall form and structure of the musical compositions under consideration. By applying a combined method of contrapuntal and formal analysis, one is able to examine how diverse principles of polyphonic thematic development are chosen. The research shows that Schumann's employment of polyphonic techniques had undergone considerable change from free inspired imitations and contrapuntal voices emerging from within the musical flux and enhancing its developmental character in his piano compositions of the 1830s to more thoroughly designed polyphonic techniques and practices invoked to play a structuring role more closely related to both formal procedure and tonal plan.\n\nThis paper proposes a new approach to the performance of Schumann's music, in particular to his song cycle Dichterliebe op. 48. Starting from the many productive instabilities and inconsistencies that characterize the compositional approach in Dichterliebe, I ask under which conditions we could think a performance practice that embraces these inconsistencies instead of stabilizing them into a finished performance. To do so, I propose the appropriation from music performance of the philosophical notion of \"the problem\" as formulated by Gilles Deleuze, connecting it with the \"pre-individual\" in Gilbert Simondon and the notion of \"outside,\" mostly in the acceptation of Maurice Blanchot and Michel Foucault. A critique is enacted of what I suggest calling the traditional \"image of musical thought.\" From this critique can emerge a performance practice that moves away from the \"problem of performance,\" regarded in its traditional form as a representative practice oriented towards recognition, and that embraces instead the \"performance of the problem,\" where the problematic dimension of Schumann is enhanced and further dynamized."
