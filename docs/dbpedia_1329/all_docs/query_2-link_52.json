        "text": "I had feared the worst. \"Murray Perahia is not one of those pianists who offers the interviewer a mid-afternoon Scotch, or even tea,\" a previous interlocutor had complained. Perahia has a reputation for austerity, haughtiness even, and my spirits sank further when, as I rang the doorbell of his house in Ealing, west London, I could hear him practising the Schumann piano concerto, which he is about to play in Amsterdam and London. This man from Porlock was surely guaranteed a frosty reception.\n\nBut, no, Perahia smiled weakly as he answered the door, ushered me into a room filled with records, CDs, paintings and all the stuff accumulated in this dark, warm, lived-in house over the past 30 years, and made me - or at least got his Spanish housekeeper to make me - a large cup of tea. Perhaps, now 61 but still looking curiously boyish, he is mellowing.\n\nHe is deeply serious and a little unworldly - he hadn't heard about the opening of the two new concert halls at Kings Place, London N1 - but he has a willing laugh. How many concerts does he play in a year? \"I never count.\" Laughs. Why hasn't he recorded all the Beethoven sonatas? \"They're difficult.\" Laughs. He is perfectly at ease, balancing his tea precariously on an expensive-looking yellow cushion, happy to dismiss Lang Lang's suggestion that pianists over 60 can't hack it. \"I haven't slowed down yet. Maybe it will come.\" He doesn't sound as though he thinks it will. In any case, age brings compensations. \"I understand much more than I did when I was 40.\"\n\nAs long as he holds together physically, he will never retire. \"I'll always play,\" he says. In the 1990s, he had to take three long breaks because of a recurrent thumb problem. Did he fear for his career? \"That wasn't the preoccupying thing, because I don't think in career terms,\" he says. \"The preoccupying thing was that I might never play again. Playing is more important than speaking to me.\"\n\nDuring those enforced breaks, he did some conducting, and he still occasionally conducts or directs from the piano - he is principal guest conductor of the Academy of St Martin in the Fields - but he has no desire to switch roles. \"I'm not a conductor. I love to play the piano. I love the instrument. I think it has a series of secrets that we have to find out from it.\"\n\nA key figure in helping him unlock them was Vladimir Horowitz, with whom Perahia worked in his late 30s. \"His was a totally different kind of music-making from mine,\" he says, \"but I admired him very much. He was very concerned with the public and how an audience would respond to something. We all are to some extent, but he played his showpieces for the public. He was a gigantic pianist. He played for me the night before he died.\"\n\nPerahia had a charmed beginning to what he prefers not to think of as a career. He saw himself primarily as a chamber musician until he won the Leeds piano competition in 1972. That victory launched his solo career, but he also made a point of working alongside the very greatest artists - collaborating with Benjamin Britten at Aldeburgh, and accompanying Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Janet Baker in recitals. To hear the recording of Schubert's Fantasia he made with his friend and kindred spirit Radu Lupu at Aldeburgh in 1984 is to get close to the heart of his music-making: intense, lyrical, entirely without affectation, transcendent.\n\nA New Yorker by birth, he came to live in the UK in 1975, attracted by the vivacity of musical life here - \"Tippett was writing a new opera every year, Britten was writing, and the BBC covered everything, so it was very exciting\" - and has been here ever since (though a gentle New York twang persists), bringing up two sons in this unshowy suburban house. You sense he is no longer quite so captivated by the wider musical scene: he cultivates his own art and says he prefers to listen to musicians of previous generations. \"I listen to Casals, Furtw√§ngler, Edwin Fischer, Cortot. The sound quality is so elevated, their playing is beyond the materialistic, there's no technique involved - it's just speaking, it's such natural music-making. We have difficulties with natural music-making.\"\n\nThe separation of classical and popular music has, he believes, undermined that naturalness. \"In the early part of the last century, you had the popular music, like Gershwin and Cole Porter, but they were also really good classical composers, and the classical composers, even up until Schoenberg, were writing dance music, popular music. This has stopped: classical music is in its sphere and popular music is in its sphere, and therefore the popular rhythms don't infect classical music. We've gotten elitist in a way, and that's dangerous.\"\n\nSchoenberg occurs several times in our conversation. He marks a dividing line for Perahia, who performs nothing later than Pierrot Lunaire, which was premiered in 1912. \"I play pretty much everything until Schoenberg, but I don't play atonal music because I don't understand it. Atonal music tries to get its organicism from intellectual concepts. This is serious music. It tries to be comprehensive, in fact. Every note is taken care of, all relationships are judged, and there's a unity in some way, but it's hard for a tonal person to understand it. It measures music completely differently, and you have to have another education for it, which I never properly got.\"\n\nOrganicism is a key word in Perahia's musical lexicon. He is a devotee of the early 20th-century Austrian music theorist Heinrich Schenker, who believed the emotional meaning of a piece could be unlocked by close study of its form. Perahia makes several valiant attempts to explain Schenkerian thinking to me. \"I'm drawn to [his ideas of] structure because this is what music is about to me - these subconscious elements, things that we're not really aware of when we're listening on the surface. But there is a pattern underneath, and you can see it more clearly if you study it. It's the same with life. We're taken by the surface events, but a really experienced psychoanalyst will see something deeper than just the surface events, and that's what Schenker tries to do in music.\"\n\nPerahia is at his most animated when he is talking about Schenker. My questions - about whether classical music is in decline, whether record companies are selling out, how careers are constructed - don't interest him. What does is understanding the pieces he is attempting to communicate. It is purism, yet not of the oppressive, self-conscious sort. He just wants to know what these great and difficult pieces - the only pieces he will play in public, leaving lesser works for his own private amusement - mean. \"How do Beethoven and Mozart create a world within a single piece? That's what fascinates me.\n\n\"I don't think the structure and logic is intellectual,\" he says, reverting to Schenker. \"I think it's an emotional thing. We've gotten to something that I think is quite important. I like complicated emotions. The simple 'I love you' doesn't appeal to me. 'What do you love?' It's involved with your past, and love and hate are not so dissimilar. Things are very complicated, and when music is also complicated but has a real emotional message through all of this complication, that's when I'm really happiest.\"\n\nAnd he does look happy, radiantly so, until I revert to dull questions about his thumb and his concert schedule. Then he starts to dry up, and I have a sense that he would quite like to go back to the Schumann, to search for the sublime."
