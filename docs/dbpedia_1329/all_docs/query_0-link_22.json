        "text": "Mr. Squiers to Mr. Uhl.\n\nSir: In accordance with your verbal instructions, I beg to hand you a report on the working of the treaty of February 22, 1868, between the United States and the North German Confederation. Naturalization treaties were made with other German States at about the same time. All cases coming under any of the various treaties are included.\n\nFor your convenience I have drawn the report in a tabulated form showing: (1) Name; (2) age at emigration; (3) date of emigration; (4) date of naturalization; (5) date of return to Germany; (6) date of intervention; (7) ground for intervention; (8) result of intervention.\n\nIn further tables I have consolidated the data collected under each of the above heads.\n\n[Page 212]\n\nYou will find a total of 447 cases presented between the 23d of April, 1868, and the 7th of April, 1897, a period of nearly twenty-nine years. Of these, 48 were Alsace-Lorraine and 88 Schleswig-Holstein cases. (Inclosures Nos. 1 and 2.)\n\nThe age at emigration is significant. Under the German law the names of all those who have passed their seventeenth year are placed on the military list, where they remain until the twenty-eighth year is passed. Of the 447 cases, 316 emigrated between the ages of 16 and 22. (Inclosure 3.)\n\nThe length of residence in the United States before naturalization, and in many cases the almost immediate return thereafter to Germany, is also very significant. Two hundred and five cases out of 375 whose records are known were naturalized within six years after emigration, while 212 out of 381 returned to their native country within two years after naturalization. (Inclosure 4.)\n\nOf the 447 cases presented, 325 were decided favorably. Many expulsion cases were decided unfavorably, and especially those expelled from Schleswig-Holstein. In cases 5, 6, 7, 15, and 319 I have been unable to find any reply to note of intervention. (Inclosures 5 and 6.)\n\nMany of the dates are missing. In cases of arrest or of compulsory service the certificate of naturalization was generally taken up by the authorities and, when the case was finally decided, returned direct. For this reason the details were not recorded.\n\nI have, etc.,"
