        "text": "Chun‐Myung Kim chose a formidable program for her debut in Carnegie Recital Hall on Friday night and met its challenge with remarkable authority and insight. The Korean pianist, who now lives here, has been a pupil of Sascha Gorodnitzki at the Juilliard School, where she earned her master's degree. Now she works with Arminda Canteros.\n\nMiss Kim's program included Beethoven's Sonata in E (Op. 109), Schumann's Humoresque (Op. 20), Chopin's Polonaise‐Fantasy and Frokofiev's Sonata No. 6 The pianist's concern through out these works was structure and style, and she captured the elusive fantasy of Schumann's long, episodic piece as completely as she did the boldly contrasting moods of the Beethoven sonata. Prokofiev's bitter, clangorous sonata, written in 1939, had an extraordinary percussive strength, whereas the Chopin work was filled with resilient ebb and flow.\n\nThe intensity of Miss Kim's playing led her into attacks and passagework that was too emphatic at times. Her efforts to bring out structural ideas became louder than they needed to be. Yet her digging into the music and into the keys of the piano was preferable to playing that is ingratiating but glib. She looks at a score in her own way and translates her ideas into performances that are gripping. She will undoubtedly be heard from again.\n\nRAYMOND ERICSON\n\nPaulina Drake obviously loves the piano, and she plays it with obvious spirit and technical command. At her New York debut Thursday night at Alice Tully Hall, one was perhaps too persistently made aware of how excitingly she could get around the keyboard. But applause did not seem to he the motivation behind the Hong Kong ‐ born pianist's style. All business and always impatient to get hack to her instrument, she actually cut short the applause several times.\n\nA slim, delicate‐looking woman, Miss Drake played such, a virtuoso‐swallowing piece as Rachmaninoff's Variations on a Theme of Chopin (Op. 22) with unflagging endurance and authority. (The theme is the Prelude in C minor.) She has the fingers for Rachmaninoff and a driving intensity that kept momentum from faltering. In Robert Muczynski's Suite (Op. 13), a Prokofievian work, the pianist also let loose fireworks, and even in Webern's Kleelike Variations (Op. 27) she found an unusual kind of clipped, breathless impetuosity.\n\nThat Miss Drake's style is not all flash and thunder, however was suggested by Schubert's Sonata in A (Op. 120), where a genuine lyric impulse made the performance attractive in spite of occasional forcing of tone and melodic line Chopin's Ballade No. 4 in F minor,\n\nMiss Drake Shows Spirit at Keyboard while somewhat overly concerned with technical dash at the expense of poetry, was the work of a fine young pianist and musician. An oddity—and a welcome one, in view of its rarity, if nothing else—was Chopin's Variations on a Theme from Herold's “Ludovic.” Miss Drake could not make it sound like top‐drawer Chopin —or like Chopin from any drawer—but she gave it her fluent best.\n\nDONAL HENAHAN\n\nThe best parts of Lawrence Schubert's debut recital yesterday afternoon at Town Hall came when he was playing the simplest, softest music on his program—works like Chopin's Nocturnes in F sharp (Op. 15, No. 2) and E flat Op. 9, No. 2) or Liszt's “Consolation” No. 3 in D flat.\n\nThere were positive and negative reasons for Mr. Schubert's success here. The positive was that he has a lovely feeling for lyrical simplicity. Unlike so many of the soulless pounders among the young pianists, he knows how to caress a phrase and to make musical points below mezzo forte.\n\nBut the negative reason was that he didn't sound so effective when the music grew louder and more complex. He got through such pieces decently enough, to be sure. But at spots where allstops‐out rhetoric was in order. Mr. Schubert seemed to hold back, and particularly knotty passages found him struggling a bit just to get all the notes in.\n\nHis interesting, cohesive program was devoted entirely to Chopin and Liszt, and ranged from familiar staples to less common pieces like Chopin's Introduction and Rondo (Op. 16) and “Allegro de Concert” (Op. 46) and Liszt's Mazurka Brillante and Polonaise No 2.\n\nJOHN ROCKWELL\n\nSoon‐Hee Lee devoted her Carnegie Recital Hall concert yesterday afternoon to a brief but interesting survey of French songs from Rameau to Poulenc. Miss Lee's light soprano is in many respects particularly well‐suited to this repertory. Its bright metallic timbre, tight vibrato and appealing fragility brought out much of the music's melodic clarity and inimitable Gallic charm.\n\nIf the actual sound of Miss Lee's voice seemed wholly appropriate to French song, her interpretive approach was rather less convincing. The subtle relationship between the text and the shape of the musical phrase was frequently smoothed over in a manner that tended to generalize each song's individual character.\n\nEven so, Miss Lee's unaffected yet carefully polished vocalism was a decidedly positive quality, and the program itself provided plenty of variety. In addition to Rameau and Poulenc, the list. of composers included Fauré Ravel, Chausson. Berlioz and Liszt. Dal Uk Lee was the accomplished accompanist.\n\nPETER G.
