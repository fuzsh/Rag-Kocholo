        "text": "Patricia J. Schumann, age 93, of Riceville, Iowa, died on Sunday, July 7, 2024 at Wildwood Grove Assisted Living in LeRoy, MN.\n\nPatricia was born in Cherokee County, Iowa on December 17, 1930 to Sylvester and Clara (Wilberding) Clark. She grew up on a farm with her older sister Mary and her younger siblings, Kay and Jack. After high school, she attended Buena Vista College and received her teaching certificate. She married Virgil Schumann on September 30, 1950 in Cherokee, Iowa. The young couple settled on a homestead north of Riceville in 1952, where they raised 7 children: Bill, Chuck, Bobbi, Nancy, Jane, Jon, and Rita.\n\nAfter Virgilâ€™s death on December 4, 1985, she returned to Buena Vista College to renew her teaching certificate. She continued her career as a first grade teacher in Riceville for 8 years, retiring in 1997. She took great joy in being a teacher and kept close to her heart the many students she taught.\n\nAs a young woman, she enjoyed riding horse and even competed in barrel racing. In school, she was active with badminton and played French horn. Pat was known for her love of birds, especially hummingbirds, and she enjoyed gardening and playing cards with friends. In retirement, her travels brought her from Alaska to Hawaii and from Machu Picchu to Ireland. Throughout her life, she was devout in her Catholic faith.\n\nPat remained on her family farm until 2019. She lived the last years of her life at Wildwood Grove Memory Care in LeRoy, Minnesota. She died peacefully on Sunday afternoon, July 7. She was 93.\n\nShe is preceded in death by her parents Sylvester and Clara, her husband Virgil, her brother Jack Clark, her sister Mary Rhode, and five brothers-in-law; Curt Hamilton, Daniel Rhode, Frank Hase, Duane Schumann, and Mose Schumann. She will be remembered fondly by her sister Kay Hase, her sisters-in-law; Lorna Clark, Geneva Hamilton, Mary Schumann and Donna Schumann, her children Bill (Lucy) Schumann, Chuck (Linda) Schumann, Bobbi Luke, Nancy (Kevin) McDougall, Jane Schumann, Jon Schumann, and Rita (Richard) Linkenmeyer, as well as 24 grandchildren and 30 great-grandchildren.\n\nA Funeral Mass will be held at 11:00 a.m. on Friday, July 12, 2024, at Immaculate Conception Catholic Church in Riceville, Iowa with Fr. Telesphore Dusabe officiating. Patricia will be laid to rest at St. Patrick's Cemetery LeRoy, MN at a later date. Visitation will be held from 5:00 to 7:00 p.m. on Thursday, July 11, at Hindt-Hudek Funeral Home in Riceville, and will continue for one hour prior to the service on Friday at the church."
