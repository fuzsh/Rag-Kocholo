He also enjoyed fishing, growing flowers, carpentry, building trains, and spending time with his family. Phillip was a “jack of all trades, but master of none”, always there to help anyone who needed it. He also just enjoyed staying home and Deb’s cooking.\n\nIn keeping with his wishes, no services will be held.\n\nOnline condolences to the family may be sent via the Palmer Funeral Homes website at www.palmerfuneralhomes.com"
