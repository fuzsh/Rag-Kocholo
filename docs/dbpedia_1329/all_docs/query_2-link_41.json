Just one page with the words “WARNING: WATCH OUT FOR THOUGHTMILLS!” written in bold would be sufficient.\n\nGame changer!\n\nYeah, that’d do it.\n\nIt would save us all a lot of time, effort, and heartache if they just warned us about thoughtmills on the way into the game.\n\nBut hardly anybody ever talks about thoughtmills.\n\nAs it turns out, understanding what thoughtmills are and how they work is literally the key to hacking the game of Life. If you’ve ever felt like your life isn’t working out how you planned or like the odds are stacked against you or that life just isn’t fair, then the chances are that you’ve fallen victim to a thoughtmill without even realising it."
