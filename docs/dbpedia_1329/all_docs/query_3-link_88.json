        "text": "Embracing the transformational power of great art has long been the essence of SummerFest, the La Jolla Music Society’s 35-year-old chamber-music celebration.\n\nNow, SummerFest is set to embrace the power of music anew at the same time that the coronavirus pandemic has dramatically transformed the annual event itself.\n\nHow dramatically? Let us count the ways.\n\nThe 2020 edition of SummerFest has been reconfigured three times since being announced in March as a marathon event spanning 22 days and 18 concerts. It was postponed for a year in May, then revived in June as a “reimagined” six-concert festival that opens Friday at the La Jolla Music Society’s year-old, $82 million Conrad Prebys Performing Arts Center.\n\nThis year’s slimmed-down SummerFest will feature seven musicians, including cello star Alisa Weilerstein and pianist Inon Barnatan — now in his second year as the festival’s music director — rather than the several dozen performers who were originally announced.\n\nMoreover, on Aug. 5, the resurgent pandemic forced SummerFest to shelve its ambitious plans to host a reduced-capacity, socially distanced audience of 130 in The Conrad’s 513-seat Baker-Baum Concert Hall.\n\n“We held out to the last possible moment to see if anything changed that would have allowed us to have a live audience,” Barnatan said. “Because we are devoted to them and our artists, and we want to be one of the leaders in bringing the whole music community back together.”\n\nThe six 2020 SummerFest concerts will be livestreamed, with only the musicians and production crew present. In addition to Barnatan and Weilerstein, the performers include violinists James Ehnes and Tessa Lark, cellist Clive Greensmith, violinist/violist Yura Lee and contrabassist Michael Thurber.\n\nNo more than six of the seven musicians will perform on stage at the same time. Each concert will last about an hour, with no intermission, a format well-suited for an online audience. The festival will conclude, offline, with a sold-out Aug. 30 gala at the Lodge at Torrey Pines, where the performers will be on the lawn as attendees listen and watch from their hotel room balconies.\n\n“We are small and nimble enough to change quickly,” Barnatan said. “It is much harder for a symphony orchestra to pivot like we can. At every point, we are trying to balance out what we can do and want to do. We want to do the type of special experiences that will be as good as any concert at any time and any place.\n\n“And we want to do it safely. … We have to make music the way we know music needs to be made, and not compromise, and this approach for SummerFest allows us to do\n\nthis.”\n\nSocially distancing a must\n\nA day before arriving for the first rehearsal this week, each of the musicians will be tested for COVID-19 at a nearby Sorrento Valley laboratory that will provide results within 24 hours.\n\nThe musicians will have their temperatures checked each time before being admitted to The Conrad. They will be seated six feet apart on stage, have separate dressing rooms and be required to wear masks, except during the livestreamed concerts, for which six-concert passes and individual-performance tickets are available.\n\nEven without a live audience, The Conrad will have multiple hand-sanitizing stations throughout the venue, including backstage. SummerFest has retained a veteran infectious disease specialist, Dr. Gonzalo Ballon Landa, to help ensure all health protocols are in place.\n\nThe musicians, who are traveling from as far as New York and Portland, will be housed only in residences of SummerFest patrons who have separate guest quarters that are apart from their homes. That’s a key consideration, given the older demographic of many of those patrons.\n\nThe entirely masked production crew will adhere to the same health guidelines as the musicians. The cameras will be remotely operated by veteran Lincoln Center Chamber Music Society livestreamed concerts director Tristan Cook. He will work from The Conrad’s basement control room with a skeleton crew.\n\n“The Baker-Baum is the perfect size for chamber music,” said Cook, a former viola player who serves as the Filmmaker-in-Residence at Colorado’s Bravo! Vail Music Festival. “The bulk of my directing work is done in advance when I read the scores for each composition and mark them up with camera directions. I have the background of being able to read music and think visually about music.”\n\nCook will be using one stationary camera and four PTZ — short for Pan Tilt Zoom — robotic cameras in the Baker-Baum. His goal is to capture the first all-online edition of SummerFest with studio-caliber quality.\n\n“The livestream was always planned, whether we had a live audience or not, because we couldn’t accommodate everybody who wanted to be there in person,” Barnatan noted.\n\n“So there’s no change to the concerts, but we won’t be able to have a paying audience in the hall. None of the artistic goals have changed — we’re still producing the best possible festival we can. And I’m not even saying the best possible festival we can ‘due to circumstances.’ Because I would want to play these concerts with these people, regardless.\n\n“The goal is not to compromise. We have the ability to change, pivot and consider the situation. But we never compromise on the quality of music-making and the quality of music people can get, whether at home or in our concert hall. It always has to be the best.”\n\nBarnatan’s unwavering passion for music and fastidious attention to detail is shared by La Jolla Music Society Artistic Director Leah Rosenthal, who curates the nonprofit arts organization’s fall, winter and spring programming.\n\nRosenthal has worked closely with Barnatan and her staff through each iteration of this year’s SummerFest. She has also played a key role in helping shape the impending festival’s free online offerings, which this year include three open rehearsals, two concert-prelude webinars, two musical encounters and one artist talk.\n\n“We’ll be bringing the sense and feeling of SummerFest from past editions, even though all of it will be virtual,” Rosenthal said.\n\n“We’re keeping all the ancillary activities, for which the audience would normally be on site, which is a really important way for us to add another layer for people.”\n\nA welcome anomaly\n\nThe surge of the coronavirus pandemic earlier this year prompted the postponement or cancellation of countless concerts and festivals, of all musical styles, across the nation and around the world.\n\nA handful of other summer classical-music festivals in the U.S. moved forward with an all-livestreamed format, including the Aspen Music Festival in Colorado and Tanglewood in Massachusetts. Both of those opted to mix new live concerts, sans audience, with archival audio and video performances from previous editions.\n\nBut not SummerFest, even though it has ample archival recordings from which to draw.\n\nStarting in 2001, SummerFest began airing for a number of years on National Public Radio’s “Performance Today.” In 2008, the festival began producing its own digitally recorded radio shows. They were nationally distributed through Chicago’s WFMT Radio Network and hosted by top TV sportscaster Dick Enberg, a devoted chamber-music fan and La Jolla resident, who died in 2017.\n\n“Our livestreamed concerts will all be new and live,” Rosenthal said. “And all the musicians will be here on stage.”\n\nAll, that is, except at Friday’s opening-night performance of Charles Ives’ intensely contemplative “The Unanswered Question,” which was composed in 1908 for a string ensemble, a woodwind quartet and a solo trumpet.\n\nIn an admirable display of artistic solidarity, Barnatan and Rosenthal have arranged for the performance of “The Unanswered Question” to be an expansive one. It will team the musicians on stage with recently videotaped parts by the more than two dozen musicians whose SummerFest performances were canceled because of the pandemic.\n\n“We’re putting together a performance that will, in some ways, be an homage to the musicians not able to be here playing with the musicians who are here,” Barnatan said.\n\n“It is also a way we are trying to bring awareness to ‘La Jolla Music Society Cares,’ which is raising money for the musicians we couldn’t have play here this summer, because a lot of musicians are hurting.”\n\nThat’s not the only step being taken to help, Rosenthal stressed.\n\n“We’ve also advanced 25 percent of the artists fees to the musicians who will join us at next year’s SummerFest,” she said.\n\n“So, if we are successful with our ‘Cares’ campaign, those musicians who can’t be here now will receive even more compensation. It’s a wonderful way to give back, because we are all in this and all struggling together. The pandemic has fundamentally changed the music industry and connected artists, agents, managers and concert presenters like never before.”\n\nNew opportunities, via Aspen\n\nBarnatan and SummerFest cellist Weilerstein are longtime friends and collaborators. On July 26, the two performed a duo concert for the Aspen Music Festival that was livestreamed from the stage of the Baker-Baum.\n\n“That was a real advantage to have a trial run for SummerFest like that,” Barnatan said.\n\n“The Aspen event was so poignant and moving,” Weilerstein agreed. “Getting on stage with Inon and making amazing music with him again — after not having done it for so long, it was a reminder that this is really what I love to do most.”\n\nThe Aspen livestream concert also provided tangible benefits beyond the music-making, as Rosenthal pointed out.\n\n“It enabled us to find our comfort level and see that it worked,” she said. “Because we’ve seen other festivals this summer that had some real challenges. We’ve already done four SummerFest livestreaming tests, but it was great to actually go live with Aspen and see that it looks and sounds as good as we wanted.\n\n“And we did learn certain things we would want to do better or change. That happens organically with anything you do. The other great thing about doing the Aspen livestream is we got to present to an audience that is not necessarily the SummerFest audience. We’ve had an amazing response about what a great concert hall we have.”\n\nThat response is already creating new opportunities.\n\nAs a result of their Aspen collaboration, Rosenthal and Barnatan have been contacted by several music organizations and producers interested in doing livestreamed concerts and recordings at the Baker-Baum.\n\nOn Aug. 23, Barnatan and violinist James Ehnes will do a livestreamed duo performance from the concert hall for Dreamstage, an online concert company. Celebrity Series of Boston has also been in contact with Rosenthal and Barnatan, who earlier this month recorded his latest solo piano album in the Baker-Baum. His album’s producer, Adam Abeshouse, oversaw the session — via the internet — from New York.\n\n“The Baker-Baum’s acoustics and Steinway piano are about as perfect as you’d want for a recording,” Barnatan said. “So this album session was a golden opportunity to use the hall in every way it can be used.”\n\nWith the all-online 2020 edition of SummerFest, the Baker-Baum will be showcased for online viewers far and wide. All that will be missing is a live audience, although — based on his recent livestreamed Aspen Music Festival duo concert with Weilerstein from La Jolla — Barnatan is quick to make a distinction.\n\n“The July concert Alisa and I did was the first time I’ve played with anybody else on stage since March,” he said, “and I really enjoyed the feeling of playing a live concert. I was even surprised that it felt as thrilling to me, and as important, as playing a live concert for an audience.\n\n“I felt like, ‘I am playing for people, even though the people are not in the hall.’ And whenever there is another colleague on stage, another musician, you do have an audience. You are playing for each other.”\n\nSummerFest 2020\n\nWhen: Friday through Aug. 29; all concerts are at 7 p.m. except for the Aug. 23 performance at 3 p.m.\n\nWhere: Livestreamed concerts will air on the La Jolla Music Society YouTube channel\n\nTickets: $90 (six-concert package); $200 (six-concert Stream Plus package, $110 of which is tax deductible); single-concert livestream tickets, priced at $15, will be available on a “day of” basis for each performance.\n\nOnline: ljms.org/subscribe/sf20-streaming\n\nSummerFest concert schedule\n\n7 p.m. Friday: Tessa Lark, Yura Lee, Clive Greensmith and Alisa Weilerstein perform Ives’ The Unanswered Question and Schubert’s String Quintet in C Major, D.956.\n\n7 p.m. Saturday: Inon Barnatan, Tessa Lark and Clive Greensmith perform Beethoven’s Symphony No. 2 in D Major, Op. 36 (arranged for piano trio), and Rachmaninoff’s Symphonic Dances, Op. 45 (arranged for solo piano by Inon Barnatan).\n\n3 p.m. Aug. 23: Yura Lee, Alisa Weilerstein and Inon Barnatan perform Beethoven’s Cello Sonata No. 3 in A Major, Op. 69 and Mendelssohn’s Piano Trio No. 1 in D Minor, Op. 49.\n\n7 p.m. Aug. 26: James Ehnes, Tessa Lark, Yura Lee, Clive Greensmith and Inon Barnatan perform Fauré’s Violin Sonata No. 1, Op. 13 and Schumann’s Piano Quartet in E-Flat Major, Op. 47.\n\n7 p.m. Aug. 28: Tessa Lark, Yura Lee, Clive Greensmith, James Ehnes Alisa Weilerstein, and Inon Barnatan perform Mozart’s Violin Sonata No. 21 in E Minor, K. 304, Kodály’s Sonata for Solo Cello, Op. 8 and Suk’s Piano Quartet in A Minor, Op. 1.\n\n7 p.m. Aug. 29: Michael Thurber, Tessa Lark, Clive Greensmith, Yura Lee, James Ehnes, Alisa Weilerstein, and Inon Barnatan perform J.S.
