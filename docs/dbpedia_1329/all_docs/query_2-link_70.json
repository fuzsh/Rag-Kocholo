        "text": "Werner Schumann, a London-based Film Director, Development Executive, writer, and comedian, boasts a rich artistic heritage. With both Italian and German roots, he is a descendant of the famed composer Robert Schumann. This legacy of creativity fuels Schumann's work as he directs, produces, writes, and performs. Schumann honed his craft through studies in photography, screenwriting, editing, and film production. He began his career in Brazil, directing experimental short films, performing comedic sketches, and taking on leading roles in film and TV series alongside his brother. He directed, wrote, and produced the short film Pioneers of Cinema (1995), which won the Golden Tatu for \"Best Fiction\" at the XXI International Bahia Film Festival. Schumann also directed, wrote, and produced the feature films Sun in the Mist (2007, Prime Video), which won the TVE Award at the San Sebastián Film Festival; O Coro (2010, Prime Video), which premiered at the prestigious Mar del Plata Film Festival and won the \"Best Director\" Award at the 21st Ibero-American Cine Ceará Film Festival in Brazil. Additionally, he directed and co-produced the feature film Absolution - A Hitman Story (2015), distributed in several countries (Netflix, Prime Video, Apple TV, Vudu-Fandango, DVD, Blu-ray, etc.). In 2022, he directed, wrote, and produced the drama-comedy The Year of the Soul (Prime Video) and the international drama-thriller The Widow's Moon, set to premiere in the USA in 2024. Schumann is a member of Directors UK, the professional association for British film and television directors, and was a founding board member of the Directors Charitable Foundation in London. He also attended the Cannes Producers Network."
