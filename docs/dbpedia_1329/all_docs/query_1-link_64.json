        "text": "At the end of October 1854, Clara Schumann travelled to Weimar with a pressed red rose stowed in her belongings. It had come into her possession at some point while visiting her hometown of Leipzig, where she had given two warmly received concerts at the Gewandhaus. These concerts initiated an intense period of concertizing for Schumann, who had only just given birth to her eighth and last child, Felix, and seen her husband, Robert, committed to the asylum at Endenich. By the time she reconnected with Johannes Brahms on 7 November in Hamburg, she had already given concerts in Weimar and Frankfurt am Main, and had found a couple of days to visit her children in Düsseldorf. The rose she carried with her, together with a number of other flowers from her travels, has been preserved thanks to Brahms's gift of a Blumenbuch (‘flower book’) during that stay in Hamburg. This thoughtful gift was a nod to her habit of holding onto flowers for her husband, as well as a medium for Brahms and Clara Schumann to hint at unspoken feelings for one anotherFootnote 2. As she continued to tour around German and other European cities, she filled this book with flowers from concerts, local gardens, friends (especially Brahms) and her children. The collection concludes, touchingly, with laurel leaves laid on Robert's grave on the day of his funeral, and the dedication of the collection to his memory. He would never see the Blumenbuch für Robert.\n\nIt is hard to resist the sentimental allure of these flowers. Each appears as a precious relic of a lost, personal memory. They have become unique testaments to the special place that flowers had in her life, as well as tangible reminders of Schumann's feminine otherness in the androcentric German canon. Cuttings like the red rose from Leipzig (Fig. 1), with its still-sharp thorns and vibrant red colour that bleeds onto the surrounding paper, seem to bristle with meaning that still speaks to us today. Redolent of romantic love and sexual desire, the red rose evokes an inexhaustible network of cultural, literary and religious associations: from innocence, virginity and youth to sexual desire, death, loss and rebirth.Footnote 3 This rose is at once a token of love saved for her husband institutionalized in Endenich, a tender reminder of her childhood in Leipzig and lost innocence, a memento mori for herself and husband, and a tribute to the temporary beauty of nature. Indeed, the more we ask of this flower, the more mutable and fugitive its potential messages become.\n\nIn the introduction to the modern facsimile of the Blumenbuch für Robert, editors Gerd Nauhaus and Ingrid Bodsch link Schumann's flower book to a larger tradition of Stammbücher popular in the nineteenth century. These albums of friendship (liber amicorum), passed between close friends, were often kept by women, who filled them with painted or pressed flowers.Footnote 4 Such albums were just one of the myriad ways that women in the nineteenth century encountered flowers in their lives, especially in the world of books. A new genre of commercial literature, collectively termed ‘sentimental flower books’, entered the book market, offering their presumed readership the specific codes needed to understand a so-called Blumensprache or ‘language of flowers’. Such books were marketed to an audience of women whose bodies and sexuality were commonly represented by flowers during this period. As Beverley Seaton has noted, these floral representations played on familiar stereotypes of women, such as their ‘smallness of stature, fragility of mind and body, and impermanence of beauty’.Footnote 5 Nineteenth-century women would have witnessed a similar conflation of floral and female representations in contemporary literature. The famous blue flower of Novalis's Heinrich von Ofterdingen, the ‘Ur-symbol’ of the early Romantics, is one of numerous examples, symbolizing inspiration, the source of poesy and eternal longing.Footnote 6 The face of the blue flower that first appears to Heinrich in the dream that opens the novel later becomes the face of his beloved, Mathilde. Women were thus caught in a perpetual representational exchange, in which flowers represented women, and women represented flowers.\n\nGiven how deeply engrained flowers and floral representations were in nineteenth-century European culture, it is perhaps no surprise that Clara Schumann's own interest in flowers extended beyond her flower books. Around a third of her song settings and choral pieces involve some reference to flowers. In some cases, flowers simply form part of the typical natural landscape of Romantic tropes, alongside trees, mountains, birds, meadows and streams. Yet in many, the flower is the principal addressee of the song, as in ‘Das Veilchen’, ‘Was weinst du, Blümlein’, ‘An einem lichten Morgen’ and ‘Die stille Lotosblume’, perhaps her most well-loved song. All stage some form of encounter with a flower where both poetic speaker and flower are implicitly or explicitly gendered. In this article, I explore how Clara Schumann navigates the floral texts of these four lieder vis-à-vis the cultural, literary and botanical associations with flowers in the nineteenth century as well as the personal flowers of the Blumenbuch für Robert. At the same time, I consider how her encounters with flowers differed from her male counterparts.\n\nThe study of floral poetics in Romantic music is not without precedent.Footnote 7 In a 2012 article, Holly Watkins explored how Robert Schumann's Blumenstück (Op. 19) engages both sentimental and Romantic floral poetics.Footnote 8 This distinction also runs along gendered lines, with the sentimental flower books being the female counterparts to male-authored Romantic literature. Yet Watkins observes a difference in how each discourse understands floral symbols, comparing the one-to-one allegoric meanings offered by sentimental flower books to the transcendent symbolism of the flower in the literature of Novalis and E.T.A. Hoffmann. For the media theorist Friedrich A. Kittler, the flower in early-Romantic literature encapsulated what he identified as the ‘originary discourse’ of the period: the a priori source of poetic inspiration for the male artist around 1800. This source is comprised of a symbolic nexus of Nature/Woman/Love – as demonstrated by Novalis's blue flower as the beloved Mathilde – which poets ‘translate’ into literature.Footnote 9 Watkins extends Kittler's discourse analysis to the floral symbolism of sentimental flower books, arguing that these books position real women, as the presumed speakers and interpreters of the language of flowers, as Woman(/Nature/Love). That is, within the Romantic paradigm identified by Kittler, sentimental flower books interpellate women as manifestations of Woman/Nature/Love.Footnote 10\n\nIn contrast to Watkins, who espouses an understandable bias for the ineffable Romantic symbolism of flowers, I seek to approach the flowers of Clara Schumann's lieder in a way that reflects how she may have encountered flower symbolism as a middle-class nineteenth-century woman. This does not mean that I indulge in the easy allegories of sentimental literature, which Watkins chastises as ‘the Biedermeier counterpart to Romanticism's more rarefied floral symbolism’.Footnote 11 Rather, I connect the flowers in her lieder to a network of necessarily overlapping discourses, media and historical contexts, reflecting how deeply entwined flowers were in the lives of women like Clara Schumann. In this study flowers emerge as radically mutable symbols that tactfully switch between ineffability and specificity, confounding the classical relationship of signifier to signified.Footnote 12 As the red rose of the Blumenbuch für Robert shows, flowers can paradoxically allude to legible, definitive meanings while also being open to boundless interpretation.\n\nContemporary books such as Elizabeth Kent's anonymously published Flora Domestica, or The Portable Flower Garden (1823) encapsulate how different ways of understanding flowers collide in a woman-authored work. This horticultural handbook included extensive passages of English poetry alongside instructions on how to care for each flower listed. Kent often chose poetry that simply mentions the flower in question. Her entry for sunflowers, for example, includes references to sunflowers in passages of James Thomson, Thomas Moore, John Clare, Charles Maturin and William Drummond, though with little exegesis beyond matching the flower's physical properties to its representation in poetry.Footnote 13 Many European sentimental flower books such as Charlotte de Latour's hugely popular and influential Le Langage des Fleurs (first published in 1819) similarly included passages of poetry that matched the supposed meaning of each flower.Footnote 14\n\nThroughout the following discussions of ‘Die stille Lotosblume’ (Op. 13, No. 6), ‘An einem lichten Morgen’ (Op. 23, No. 2), ‘Was weinst du, Blümlein’ (Op. 23, No. 1) and ‘Das Veilchen’, I take a self-consciously ‘naïve’ approach to their floral representations.Footnote 15 This means that in place of a suspicious theorization of the ecological symbology of the music and poetry of these songs, I instead examine how the flowers act, form relationships, withhold feelings and communicate with the poetic speaker.Footnote 16 This allows me to place flowers centre stage, and to explore their extroversive network of gendered, botanical, sentimental and poetic associations. It is at this level, I suggest, that Clara Schumann interacts with her flowers, weaving their distinctive mutability into her compositional style. I will show that through her piano accompaniments especially, she is able to reify their desires, protect their stubborn silences and contextualize their speech in relation to the poetic speaker.\n\nSpeakers and Authors\n\nMy final case study, ‘Das Veilchen’, also features the major–minor juxtapositions that have come to typify Schumann's engagement with the mutability of flowers. Like ‘Was weinst du, Blümlein’, this song begins in an easy, volkstümlich style and without an introduction. We immediately learn that this innocent little violet stands in the meadow unnoticed and with a bowed head. On the word unbekannt, the harmony gently turns from F major to F minor, adding a tinge of pity to the otherwise cheerful introduction of the violet, and foreshadowing its encounter with the beloved shepherdess. Schumann embraces the minor mode completely in the setting of the second stanza, as the poet reveals the inner thoughts of the violet who longs to be noticed by the shepherdess. Turning back to F major for the final stanza, there is one last momentary twist to F minor, as the shepherdess fails to see the poor violet. This time the minor twist reminds us that the violet's longing to be noticed, to be more than unbekannt, is hopeless. Yet the violet still rejoices because it is at least through her foot that it perishes."
