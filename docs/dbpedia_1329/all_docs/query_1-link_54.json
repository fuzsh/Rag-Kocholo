Peter & Paul Cemetery, Belle Plaine, MN\n\nApril 13, 1904\n\nAl had his clothing caught at sawmill on shaft on the planer but was close to the ground and could brace himself from being whirled around. His clothing was torn from him, and he was tightly squeezed. No bones broken. (page 36)\n\nNovember 23, 1904\n\nAl had a piece of wood 3 1/2 inches long in his nose for six weeks without knowing it. He had been troubled for some weeks with a stiff neck and sore nose. while Dr. Bohland was examining him, he discovered a sore at the side of the nose and drew out this 3 1/2 inch piece of wood about as thick as a pencil and square in shape. It left a cavity which reached almost back to his spinal column. Over six weeks ago a sliver struck him with great force in the nose . He pulled out what he thought to be all of it, and by applications of cold water, stopped the bleeding. He began to have a painfully stiff neck but never thought of putting the two occurrences together. (page 36)\n\nMarch 8, 1905\n\nAl Schuman into new residence. Demolished April, 1955. Block 89. (page 263)\n\nAl ran a threshing rig here for many years. All my growing up years I heard the words Buffalo-Pitts, Aultman-Taylor, and the Minneapolis-brands of threshing machines. quite a few houses in town were built by him. He also ran a sawmill on block 88. I mention a number of accidents pertaining to Al. It must be remembered that at this time machinery was unguarded.\n\nWhat good times we had in this house--my second home. Mrs. Schumann had a great fund of old stories (Katherine Kartes). when I took a writing course at the University, I realized that they were folk tales and likely very old. One concerned a group of people around a table playing cards. The hour grew late. someone made a challenge and \"I dare you.\" go to the cemetery at midnight, pull up a wooden cross, bring it here, take it back. This was done. when the time grew long and the man did not return, the group investigated and found him dead over the grave. At the time he attempted to put the cross back he also stuck it into the bottom of his long overcoat. when he made the attempt to straighten up, he realized that something clutched. he died of a heart attack. This very same story appeared in the \"Readers Digest.\" Another story she told was an incident in \"Faust\" where the devil builds a bridge as fast as the man can walk. Mrs. Schumann never heard of \"Faust.\" Also she saw \"the light\" may times below the bridge. As I say with this dear family i spent many happy hours of youth. I could cite a whole page of \"I remembers.\" My debt of gratitude is great.\n\nKATHERINE KARTES:\n\n1929 Mr. & Mrs. Al Schumann lived in Belle Plaine, MN\n\nKatherine Kartes was a nurse and would visit Aunt Mayme in South St. Paul.\n\nBurial: Sts.
