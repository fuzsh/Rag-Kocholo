        "text": "I’ve listened to the dirge-like second movement of Robert Schumann’s piano quintet in E-flat major — specifically, as played by the Beaux Arts Trio in their 1976 recording — so many times that it has become ingrained, like a route that I could walk in my sleep. When I imagine the first movement’s yearning theme, I can’t help but hear Bernard Greenhouse’s distinctive tone.\n\nLast Friday’s performance of that piece by the Escher String Quartet, joined by pianist Jon Nakamatsu, at the First Congregational Church in Wellfleet had echoes of that recording. (It’s fitting, as Greenhouse lived in Wellfleet, and used to perform with the Cape Cod Chamber Music Festival.) The piece was perfect for closing the program, considering the past year and a half. It is full of raw emotion, pent-up energy, and release.\n\nThe Cape Cod Chamber Music Festival was virtual last summer. At Friday’s concert, there was a collective sense of joy to be back to live music. People chattered excitedly beforehand. A few stragglers clapped between movements — concert etiquette, like any other social skill, gets rusty from disuse.\n\nBut there was also a sense of melancholy, perhaps brought on by the Delta variant. I attended the second of two reduced-capacity performances at 5 and 7:30 p.m., figuring the musicians would be fully warmed up. Compared to past festivals, the pews felt empty; the applause was perhaps slightly less uproarious, but still appreciative.\n\nThe program opened with Samuel Coleridge-Taylor’s quintet in F-sharp minor for clarinet and strings. For this piece, the Escher was joined by clarinetist Jon Manasse. Coleridge-Taylor was a turn-of-the-20th-century Afro-English composer influenced by “big R” Romantic composers such as Brahms, Dvořák, and Grieg, as well as by African American music.\n\nIn the allegro energico first movement, Manasse’s tone was like warm caramel. This was offset by the plump, juicy pizzicato of cellist Brook Speltz. The larghetto affettuoso second movement seemed to start spontaneously, with the high strings (violinist Adam Barnett-Hart, violinist Brendan Speltz, and violist Pierre Lapointe) entering like a ray of light. The melody — first in the clarinet, later in the cello — is undeniably comforting. The whole piece has a cinematic quality — this movement especially so.\n\nThe slippery scherzo third movement was also expertly played — some dynamic contrasts actually made me jump. The allegro agitato fourth movement’s toe-tapping theme begins in the clarinet and is spun out by the frenzied other instruments. The tension builds to an abrupt silence (the classical equivalent of a beat drop). When the musicians re-enter, the sound is hesitant and dissonant, but not for long. Their accelerando comes to an absolutely nutso ending, bows flying in the air.\n\nIndeed, this piece really excels in the endings of movements: the first movement ends with a plucky exclamation; the second with a sigh; the third with a joking shrug; the fourth with fireworks.\n\nThe Schumann piano quintet that followed in the second half, however, was the highlight of the program. The allegro brilliante first movement has a lot of “hurry up and wait.” Pianist Nakamatsu expertly stretches and compresses time like saltwater taffy. When cellist Speltz gets the theme, which begins with a fifth leap, he resists the temptation for schmaltz. His slides are understated.\n\nIn the marcia second movement, the somber initial theme is passed around like a glass of whiskey at a funeral. When it reached violist Lapointe, his sound was perfectly gravelly — evoking a shovel hacking at the hard earth. The secondary theme was played so beautifully as to draw tears.\n\nThere was a small mishap at the beginning of the scherzo third movement. Nakamatsu started playing, but violinists Barnett-Hart and Speltz weren’t ready. The look of panic on their faces lasted mere seconds; they recovered quickly. The finale was played with a great deal of foot stomping and masculine energy. The movement culminates in a fugue — in the final bars, one could actually hear the wood of cellist Speltz’s bow hitting the strings like punctuation.\n\nThe Chamber Music Festival continues this Thursday and Friday in Eastham and Wellfleet (see box, this page).\n\nPreview: Major Key\n\nThe event: “A Woman’s Perspective” with Imani Winds, part of the Cape Cod Chamber Music Festival\n\nThe time: Friday, Aug. 13 at 5 and 7:30 p.m.; there is also a free family concert at the Salt Pond Visitor’s Center in Eastham on Thursday, Aug. 12, 5 p.m.\n\nThe place: First Congregational Church, 200 Main St., Wellfleet\n\nThe cost: $40 adults, $15 students\n\nCould this be a new age for chamber music? With small ensembles and limited audiences, chamber music certainly seems more Covid-friendly than, say, Mahler’s “Symphony of a Thousand.” But what are the logistics of performing chamber music right now, and how are Cape ensembles adapting?\n\nBattle of the Instruments\n\nGreek mythology tells of a musical contest between the god Apollo, who played the lyre, and the satyr Marsyas, who played the pipes. Apollo won because of a few party tricks: unlike his hairy opponent, he could play upside down, even while singing — he didn’t need his mouth to play.\n\nThis story captured the Renaissance imagination, especially the idea of a division between elegant string instruments and lowly wind instruments. And it has some added relevance today. When it comes to Covid, not all instruments are equal. Studies show that singing and playing wind instruments may expel more of the virus. These musicians also cannot perform while wearing a mask.\n\nThat is why Gov. Baker’s current guidelines, which allow outdoor performances only, require singers and wind players to maintain more distance during a concert than string players and other instrumentalists. Singers and wind players must stay 10 feet apart and 25 feet from the audience, while everyone else must clear only the standard six-foot separation.\n\nBreathing Together\n\nMatthew Scinto, conductor of the Cape Cod Chamber Orchestra, says that higher expenses preclude live outdoor performances for his ensemble. Between finding an outdoor venue with enough cover — wooden string instruments do not like the rain — and hiring a sound engineer for amplification, it’s simply not feasible.\n\nRight now, “If you do a chamber music concert, it’s going to be virtual,” Scinto says. And that is indeed what his group is planning for late September. A reduced ensemble of about 10 string players will rehearse on Cape Cod and shoot a concert at Yarmouth’s New Church.\n\nScinto emphasizes that “an orchestra is not a string quartet.” You can’t round up four orchestral players and expect them to mesh perfectly, since chamber music requires hours of rehearsal and getting to know each other closely. This is “subtle stuff for most listeners.”\n\nOne challenge Scinto foresees is how the musicians will play with masks. “Such an important part of string playing is breathing together,” he says.\n\nMusical Communication\n\nCraig Combs, artistic director of Chamber Music for the Outer Cape, which is based at the Pilgrim Monument and Provincetown Museum, is similarly planning a live-stream concert for Aug. 20.\n\nIt will consist of works by Fauré, Copland, and William Grant Still played by violinist Jeffrey Thurston; theater pieces performed by singer Halcyon Hurst; and Beethoven’s “Moonlight” Sonata, performed by Combs on piano.\n\nCombs says he hesitated to include a singer, as they “expel the virus more efficiently.” But all the instrumentalists will wear masks, and the singer will be positioned to face the double doors leading outside. Even so, “It’s quite difficult right now to rehearse,” he says.\n\nWhile a live-stream concert scratches a certain itch, it is not the same as an in-person performance. “In chamber music there is communication,” Combs says. “And when you have an audience, it is so much more interesting. You get feedback. You hear someone take a breath during a particularly beautiful passage. Normally, we are not very far from the audience, maybe five feet. They are right there with us — they are hearing us breathe.”\n\nAnother Provincetown series offering chamber music is Great Music on Sundays @5, which traditionally had its spring-to-fall season at the Unitarian Universalist Meeting House. On Aug. 16 and 30, the series will present live-stream concerts of baroque music performed by Greg Gettel on trumpet, soprano Elise Groves, Frederick Jodry on clavier, and Eric Maul on flute.\n\nA Question of Intimacy\n\nThe Cape Cod Chamber Music Festival, which brings world-class musicians to Wellfleet and around the Cape every August, announced they would be going virtual back in May.\n\nArtistic directors Jon Manasse and Jon Nakamatsu will narrate three hour-long programs of archived performances from the festival. These will be released on the first three Tuesdays of August. There will also be a video event with memories, anecdotes, and musical clips by artists who have graced their stage.\n\nOriginally, there was going to be a live recording session with musicians in New York City, but travel restrictions have made it unfeasible for the time being. Nakamatsu, who is from California, would have to quarantine for two weeks.\n\n“The basic tenet of chamber music is that it is intimate,” says Manasse. Though this can be construed as a positive, with fewer people, there is also an element of closeness that is currently unachievable.\n\n“If you’re reviewing concerts now, and they only allow 10 people in the audience, you can write ‘to a sold-out crowd,’ or ‘a packed hall,’ ” Manasse jokes.\n\nManasse, who’s a clarinetist, says he played in a socially distant concert in Colorado in June, separated from his colleagues by plexiglass. “The string players were wearing masks, and we realized that there is so much subtle nuance to facial gestures,” he says. “Just the littlest thing can communicate direction, color, feeling, ensemble.”\n\nNakamatsu agrees that communication in chamber music is subtle and mysterious, and he wonders how it will be affected by the pandemic. “When your artistic sense is so compatible and so attuned to each other, that goes beyond the mechanics of it,” he says. “It’s an aesthetic, almost spiritual thing.”"
