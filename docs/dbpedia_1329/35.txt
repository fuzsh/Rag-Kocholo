Robert Schumann

Robert Schumann was born on 8 June 1810 in Zwickau, Saxony. His qualities as a composer are known to most of us. Not so well known is his discovery of the manuscript of Schubert's 'Great' C major symphony in Vienna in 1839, which he passed on to Mendelssohn. His slow decline from mental instability ended an extraordinarily sad life on 29 July 1856 at Endenich, near Bonn.
