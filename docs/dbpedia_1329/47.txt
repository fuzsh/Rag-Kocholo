TRABUCO CANYON – Trabuco Canyon resident Alan Schumann was sound asleep when his home on Trabuco Oaks Drive shook at 11 p.m. Tuesday night.

What Schumann and his wife, Angelina, believed was an earthquake turned out to be the violent crash of a tree hitting their roof.

“My wife was still up, looking on the Internet for earthquake news,” Schumann said. But there was none to be found.

Schumann’s son, Rigel, 9, slept through the noise and shaking, but daughter Rhea, 7, woke up startled by the disturbance.

The family did not discover the tree on their roof until this morning around 6:30 a.m., Schumann said, after Angelina saw chips of paint on the kitchen floor that had flaked off the ceiling from the heavy fall of the tree.

A tree removal crew used chain saws from 8:30 to 11:30 a.m. Wednesday to hack the tree into pieces and remove it from the Schumann’s 900-square-foot cabin roof.

Schumann said he believes the tree had soaked up so much water from the rain that it became too heavy and crashed onto the family’s roof, about 5 feet from where the tree once stood.

Schumann said the family will wait until after the storms pass to call a contractor to check the structural stability of the home.
