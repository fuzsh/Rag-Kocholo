Clara Schumann (born Sept. 13, 1819, Leipzig, Saxony [Germany]â€”died May 20, 1896, Frankfurt am Main, Ger.) was a German pianist, composer, and wife of composer Robert Schumann.

Encouraged by her father, she studied piano from the age of five and by 1835 had established a reputation throughout Europe as a child prodigy. In 1838 she was honoured by the Austrian court and also was elected to the prestigious Society of the Friends of Music (Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde) in Vienna.

Despite strong objections from her father, she married Schumann in 1840, and they had eight children between 1841 and 1854. Though family responsibilities curtailed her career, she taught at the Leipzig Conservatory, composed, and toured frequently.
