Dunant-Passy Nobel Prize

Bezeichnung

Henry Dunant, as founder of the International Red Cross and initiator of the first Geneva Convention, was awarded the first Nobel Peace Prize in 1901 together with the French pacifist Frédéric Passy. Albert Nobel had specified in his will that the prize should be awarded to "the personality or community that has contributed most or best to the rapprochement of peoples, to the abolition or reduction of standing armies, to the gathering and propagation of progress for peace". While Passy advocated the abolition of armies, Dunant exposed the horrors of war in his book "Un Souvenir de Solférino" (1862), in which he outlined his idea of creating the Red Cross as a neutral body dedicated to improving conditions for prisoners of war and the impartial care of the wounded on the battlefield. Following Henry Dunant's receipt of the award, the International Committee of the Red Cross also received the distinction in 1917, 1944 and 1963.
