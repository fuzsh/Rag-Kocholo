        "text": "By Francesca Merlo\n\nNarges Mohammadi has been awarded the 131st Nobel Peace Prize for her unwavering fight against the oppression of women in Iran and her dedication to human rights and freedom. Currently imprisoned in Tehran, she was announced as the 2023 Peace Prize laureate by the Norwegian Nobel Committee, composed of five members chosen by the Norwegian parliament.\n\nNarges Mohammadi\n\nMohammadi, an engineer and writer, has endured personal sacrifices due to her activism, including separation from her family. She has actively opposed the death penalty, given Iran's high execution rates. Despite her multiple arrests, she continues to advocate for human rights and has focused on combating torture and sexual violence against political prisoners, particularly women.\n\nHer activism\n\nCurrently held in Tehran's Evin Prison for \"spreading anti-state propaganda,\" Mohammadi's prolonged detention has been solely due to her human rights advocacy, according to Amnesty International. She has endured torture, mistreatment, and denial of prescribed medications for respiratory issues.\n\nIn Iran, her activism has inspired civil disobedience, particularly during periods of heightened tension. After the death of Mahsa Jina Amini, who was killed by morality police for not wearing the hijab correctly, widespread protests erupted with the slogan \"woman, life, freedom.\" These protests have led to hundreds of deaths, thousands of injuries, and over 20,000 arrests.\n\nOther imprisoned winners\n\nIn addition to Narges Mohammadi, other Nobel laureates who were imprisoned at the time of their award include Carl von Ossietzky and Liu Xiaobo. Von Ossietzky, a pacifist and journalist, was imprisoned in a concentration camp after opposing German rearmament in 1933. Liu Xiaobo, a human rights activist, spent much of his life in prison in China for advocating democratic reform. Both faced significant challenges and, in Liu Xiaobo's case, a tragic end to their lives."
