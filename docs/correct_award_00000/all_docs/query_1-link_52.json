He required water rights and took his plea directly to Emperor Napoleon III. Undeterred by the fact that Napoleon was in the field directing French Armies, Dunant made his way to Napoleon’s headquarters near Solferino, Italy. He witnessed one of the bloodiest battles of the nineteenth century. As a result, he published in 1862 a small book Un Souvenir de Solférino [A Memory of Solferino], destined to make him famous.\n\nThe book depicted the fighting itself but also the aftermath and the difficulties of caring for the wounded. It also detailed a plan. The nations of the world should form relief societies to provide care for the wartime wounded; with a governing board composed of the nation’s leading figures. Dunant, pouring his money and time into the cause, travelled over most of Europe obtaining promises from governments to send representatives. On August 22, 1864, 12 nations signed an international treaty, commonly known as the Geneva Convention, agreeing to guarantee neutrality to sanitary personnel, to expedite supplies for their use, and to adopt a special identifying emblem – a red cross on a field of white. \n\nFrom 1875-95, Dunant lived in solitude, facing financial ruin and social exile from his failed scheme. He later received accolades for his contributions but spent the remaining years in a hospice. Despite his challenging later years, Dunant's legacy endures through the Red Cross, a testament to his pioneering spirit and unwavering commitment to the advancement of humanity.\".",
