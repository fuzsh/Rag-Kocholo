        "text": "Ordinary women\n\nAfter1975, the Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to 16 women and 35 men. That is approximately 30 % women. This shift reflects not only changes in society, with women gaining political and economic access, but also a change in the kind of peace building efforts that have been emphasized by the Norwegian Nobel Committee.\n\nThe prize for 1976 is a good example: Not only where two women awarded this year, but it was also one of the first times the Nobel Peace Prizes was given to “ordinary people”, ie. someone without a long experience in peace movements, political or organizational life.\n\nBetty Williams was a housewife in Belfast. A day in August 1976 something happened in her neighbourhood. A car came rushing down the street, inside the car was a man who belonged to the IRA. He was being followed by armed men. A gunshot was heard, and the car continued with the badly injured driver hanging over the wheel. The car hit a mother and her three children. The mother survived, but the three children died. One of the neighbours who rushed to the scene was Betty Williams. Mairead Corrigan was the children’s aunt. Together, the two women built up a grassroots movement with the aim to end violence between Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland. They arranged marches and peace meetings and encouraged peace groups to be formed all over Northern Ireland.\n\nWomen’s participation\n\nIn 2011, the number of female Peace Prize laureates jumped from 12 to 15 in just one year. The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Leymah Gbowee and Tawakkol Karman for their non-violent struggle for the safety of women and for women’s rights to full participation in peace-building work. “We cannot achieve democracy and lasting peace in the world unless women obtain the same opportunities as men to influence developments at all levels of society”, the Norwegian Nobel Committee said in the announcement.\n\nSocial worker Leymah Gbowee led the Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace. Thousands of women from different religious and ethnic backgrounds gathered for daily demonstrations against President Charles Taylor. The women wore simple, white T-shirts as a symbol of peace. They did not relent even when Taylor banned the demonstrations and warned them against criticising the government. In this way, they helped push through the peace talks that lead to the signing of a peace deal in August 2003. Charles Taylor was forced into exile.\n\nAfter the peace agreement was signed, Gbowee’s network worked towards encouraging greater voter turnout by Liberian women. They offered, among other things, to babysit children and mind women’s stalls in the market square while they went to register to vote. A simple thing that made it possible for more women to participate in the election in 2005. After this election, Liberia gained Africa’s first democratically elected female president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.\n\nWith the Nobel Peace Prize being rewarded to Malala Yousafzai in 2014, the focus was not so much on her being a woman, rather on her being a child. She was only 17 when she received the prize, the youngest Nobel laureate ever. With Malala, girls all over the world got a new kind of role model. She was an ordinary schoolgirl, and she proved to the whole world that if you believe in something, and if you are willing to stand up for it, you can make a difference.\n\nThree days after the announcement of the Nobel Peace Prize to Narges Mohammadi, the prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel was awarded in Stockholm, to the Harvard Professor Claudia Golding. She has studied the role of women in the labour market through 200 years and investigated the gender gap in earnings. Her research show that the bulk of the earnings difference is not related to differences in education and occupational choices but is found between men and women in the same occupation and is closely related to childbirth.\n\n“Understanding women’s role in the labour is important for society. Thanks to Claudia Goldin’s groundbreaking research we now know much more about the underlying factors and which barriers may need to be addressed in the future,” the announcement said.\n\nThe 2023 awards to Narges Mohammadi and Claudia Goldin are not just making the gender statistics of the Nobel Prizes look better, they also emphasize that societies cannot be economical sustainable, just and peaceful without equal rights – and equal participation - for all. In the words of the Norwegian Nobel Committee:\n\n“Only by embracing equal rights for all can the world achieve the fraternity between nations that Alfred Nobel sought to promote.”"
