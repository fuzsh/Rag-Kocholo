        "text": "New Delhi: Every year, World Red Cross and Red Crescent Day is celebrated on May 8 which is also the birth anniversary of Jean-Henry Dunant. Born on May 8, 1828, Dunant established the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and was the first recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. Dunant’s life was full of contradictions and struggles, and there was even a time when he was almost forgotten and was living alone in poverty. Despite his tumultuous life, Dunant’s humanitarian efforts have ensured his lasting legacy and the Red Cross movement that he co-founded has proved to be one of the leading lights in the field of benevolent compassion for the human race.\n\nA religious childhood\n\nHenry Dunant was born to a religious family in Geneva, and it had a profound impact on him. Since childhood, Dunant was engaged quite seriously in religious activities and for a while in full-time work as a representative of the Young Men’s Christian Association, travelling in France, Belgium, and Holland. After completing school education, Dunant worked for a Geneva bank.\n\nIn 1853, he went to the Swiss colony in Algeria, Setif, where he started the construction of a wheat mill. But he failed to get the land concession needed for its operation. He next went to Tunisia and then returned to Geneva, and decided to directly petition Emperor Napoleon III to get the required business document.\n\nA change in conscience\n\nAt that time, Napoleon III was personally directing the French armies who, with the Italians, were striving to drive the Austrians out of Italy. Dunant went directly to Napoleon’s headquarters near Solferino, a north Italian town, only to witness one of the bloodiest battles fought in the 19th century. It changed his conscience and in 1862, he published a small book titled ‘Un Souvenir de Solférino’ (A Memory of Solferino]), which subsequently fetched him fame.\n\nYet, the struggle continued\n\nHe co-founded the International Committee for Relief to the Wounded, which is now known as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and he was also its secretary. His humanitarian efforts made him famous all over Europe, but his monetary situation was in a dire state. In 1867, he officially became bankrupt.\n\nHe quit as the secretary of the International Committee. Surprisingly, on September 8, 1867, the Committee accepted his resignation both as secretary and a member. Dunant went to Paris where he slept on public benches. As fate would have it, during that time, Empress Eugenie called him to take his advice on increasing the jurisdiction of the Geneva Convention to naval warfare. Dunant became an honorary member of the national Red Cross societies of Austria, Sweden, Spain, Holland and Prussia. But that did not alleviate his financial problems.\n\nDunant was extremely active during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. He comforted the wounded soldiers in Paris and suggested those injured can wear a badge so that the identification of the dead becomes easier. Later, he travelled to London, where he tried to arrange a diplomatic conference on the problems related to the prisoners of war. The proposal was encouraged by the Tsar but met with opposition from England.\n\nThe extreme poverty\n\nDespite his humanitarian works, poverty refused to leave Dunant, who travelled on foot in Alsace, Germany and Italy, and lived on the charity of a few friends. But then, luck finally smiled upon him.\n\nIn 1887, Dunant reached Heiden, a Swiss village and there, he became ill. He stayed in the local hospice, and in 1895, a journalist, Georg Baumberger found him there. Dunant became the subject of his article which soon became widely read. Sympathetic people from several parts of the globe reached out to Dunant and he once again became famous. In 1901, he was honoured with the first Nobel Peace Prize along with Frederic Passy, a French economist and pacifist.\n\nDespite receiving renewed fame, Dunant stayed in the same room in the village and spent the rest of his life there. He passed away on October 30, 1910. There was no funeral ceremony and no mourners, and as per his wishes, he was carried to his grave."
