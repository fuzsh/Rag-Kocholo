        "text": "Henry Dunant and the Origins of the Red Cross\n\nIn 1859, Swiss businessman Henry Dunant was traveling in northern Italy when he witnessed the aftermath of a bloody battle between Franco-Sardinian and Austrian forces near the small village of Solferino.\n\nThe fighting had left some 40,000 troops dead, wounded or missing, and both the armies, as well as the residents of the region, were ill-equipped to deal with the situation.\n\nBy 1862, Dunant published a book, A Memory of Solferino, in which he advocated for the establishment of national relief organizations made up of trained volunteers who could offer assistance to war-wounded soldiers, whichever side of the fighting they were on. The following year, Dunant was part of a Swiss-based committee that put together a plan for national relief associations.\n\nThe group, which eventually became known as the International Committee of the Red Cross, adopted the symbol of a red cross on a white background, an inverse of the Swiss flag, as a way to identify medical workers on the battlefield. (In the 1870s, the Ottoman Empire began using a red crescent as its emblem, in place of a red cross; many Islamic countries continue the practice today.)\n\nIn late 1863, the first national society was started in the German state of Württemberg.\n\nAnd in 1864, 12 countries signed the original Geneva Convention, which called for the humane treatment of sick and wounded soldiers, regardless of nationality, and the civilians who came to their aid.\n\nDunant experienced financial setbacks that forced him to declare bankruptcy in 1867, and he resigned from the Red Cross.\n\nHowever, in 1901, he received the first-ever Nobel Peace Prize; his citation for the award stated: “Without you, the Red Cross, the supreme humanitarian achievement of the nineteenth century would probably have never been undertaken.”\n\nREAD MORE: 6 Things You May Not Know About the Nobel Prizes\n\nClara Barton Brings the Red Cross to the US\n\nAfter the U.S. Civil War broke out in 1861, Clara Barton, a former teacher then working in the U.S. Patent Office in Washington, D.C., voluntarily began delivering food and supplies to Union soldiers on the front lines.\n\nAt the end of the war, Barton, who’d earned the nickname “Angel of the Battlefield,” received permission from President Abraham Lincoln to operate the Missing Soldiers Office, to help locate missing troops for their families and friends.\n\nOver the course of several years, Barton and her small staff received more than 63,000 letters asking for help and were able to track down some 22,000 men.\n\nIn the late 1860s, Barton, a Massachusetts native, traveled to Europe to recuperate from years of tireless work during the war, and while there she learned about the Red Cross movement.\n\nUpon her return to the U.S., she launched a years-long campaign to get the U.S. to ratify the Geneva Convention of 1864; it did so in 1882, a year after Barton founded the American Red Cross.\n\nUnder Barton’s leadership, the Red Cross focused on helping victims of peacetime disasters, including the 1889 Johnstown Flood in Pennsylvania, which killed more than 2,000 people, and the 1893 hurricane in South Carolina’s Sea Islands that left some 30,000 people homeless, most of them African American.\n\nIn 1898, the American Red Cross aided the U.S. military for the first time when it provided medical care to soldiers in the Spanish-American War.\n\nBarton resigned as head of the Red Cross in 1904, when she was 83.\n\nHistory of the American Red Cross\n\nIn the early 20th century, the American Red Cross expanded its efforts to include such public programs as first aid training and water safety.\n\nDuring World War I, the organization experienced significant growth, going from some 100 local chapters in 1914 to more than 3,800 chapters four years later. The Red Cross recruited 20,000 nurses for military service and provided support for U.S. and Allied troops as well as civilian refugees.\n\nIn World War II, the organization’s efforts included recruiting more than 104,000 nurses for the armed forces and sending more than 300,000 tons of supplies abroad. In 1941, the Red Cross started a national blood donation program to collect blood for U.S. armed forces; by 1945, the service had collected more than 13 million pints of blood.\n\nIn 1948, the American Red Cross launched the nation’s first blood program for civilians. In 2017, the program provided approximately 40 percent of America’s blood and blood products.\n\nThe Red Cross supported U.S. service members and their families during the Korean War, the Vietnam War and conflicts in the Middle East, as well as providing aid to victims of disasters, including Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the 2010 earthquake in Haiti and Hurricane Sandy in 2012.\n\nREAD MORE: 7 Red Cross Facts\n\nSources"
