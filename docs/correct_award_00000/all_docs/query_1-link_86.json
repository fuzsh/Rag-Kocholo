He shared the award with Frédéric Passy. \n\nDunant's life is a study in contrasts. He was born into a wealthy home but died in a hospice; in middle age he juxtaposed great fame with total obscurity, and success in business with bankruptcy; in old age he was virtually exiled from the Genevan society of which he had once been an ornament and died in a lonely room, leaving a bitter testament. His passionate humanitarianism was the one constant in his life, and the Red Cross his living monument.\n\nRead more about him by clicking the link in our bio. \n\nPhoto: @thenobelinstitute\n\n#NobelPrize #NobelPeacePrize\".",
