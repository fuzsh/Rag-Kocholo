        "text": "Geneva, 1852\n\nDriven by intense faith, Henry Dunant founds the Christian Youth Union of Geneva with his friends. Looking beyond rifts present between the Churches, he dedicates himself to inspiring commitment and respect for others in his young contemporaries.\n\nSolferino, 1859\n\nFollowing business engagements in Algeria, he experiences a chance encounter with the horrors of war. He draws together support and assistance after the battle of Solferino. Tutti fratelli- we are all brothers -in the face of suffering, he repeats, after the women of Castiglione.\n\nGeneva, 1863\n\nA captured soldier, an enemy at your mercy must be respected regardless of his nationality, religion, skin color, or creed. This is one of the cornerstones of the Red Cross that Henry Dunant founds, thanks to the international committee.\n\nParis, 1867\n\nDeep in misery himself, Henry Dunant attempts to promote a Universal International Library so that cultures from around the world might learn to appreciate one another instead of being jealous of one another. Thirty years later, he takes a deep interest in Esperanto, a common means of communication helping to bring people closer together.\n\nLondon-Plymouth, 1872\n\nIn London, he outlines the protection of war prisoners. Before the Social Science Congress of Plymouth, he presents his views on international arbitration.\n\nZurich-Brussels, 1890-1900\n\nIn his own way a feminist ahead of his time, he attempts to launch a Green Cross which would be for fallen women the equivalent of what the Red Cross is for injured soldiers.\n\nHeiden, 1892-1910\n\nIn the isolation of his hospital room, he struggles endlessly for the underprivileged and against excess in profit, for peace and against the taking up of arms."
