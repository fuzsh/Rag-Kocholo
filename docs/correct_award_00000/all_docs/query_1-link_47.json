        "text": "Born 1828 in Geneva (Switzerland) into a well-situated family, Henry Dunant became an unsuccessful businessman and – led by his affection for the situation of the needy – the founder of several organizations, amongst the most important is the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Dunant started working at a bank in 1849. After working for a Swiss mill company in Sétif/Algeria, he founded his own mill company in Algeria in 1858 (Société financière et industrielle des Moulins des Mons-Djémila). In 1867, the liquidation of his company ends in a scandal and he is forced to leave the ICRC. Impoverished, he lived in Heiden (Switzerland) until a journalist rediscovered him in 1895. Afterwards he received several awards and in 1901 the first ever Nobel Peace Prize together with Frédéric Passey. He died in 1910 in Heiden."
