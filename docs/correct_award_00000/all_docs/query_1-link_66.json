        "text": "The United Nations and its leader, Kofi Annan, today won the Nobel Peace Prize for \"their work for a better organised and more peaceful world\".\n\nThe Norwegian Nobel committee said that the United Nations and Mr Annan would share the $943,000 (Â£650,000) prize.\n\nIt praised the UN for being at the forefront of efforts to achieve peace and security in the world.\n\nMr Annan was praised for \"bringing new life to the organisation\".\n\nThe committee's secretary, Geir Lundestad, said of the winners: \"They would have been relevant candidates no matter what but the recent events make them more relevant.\"\n\nMr Annan was born in 1938 in Ghana. He became UN secretary-general in 1997. He has been praised for his character, moral leadership, his efforts to stop civil wars in Africa and elsewhere and his efforts to combat Aids.\n\nHe was the head of UN peacekeeping operations when the United States lobbied against Boutros Boutros-Ghali of Egypt winning a second term.\n\nIn an unprecedented vote of confidence, Mr Annan was unanimously re-elected to a second five-year term by the 189 UN member states in June this year, six months before his first term expires in December.\n\nIt is the first time that the UN as a whole has won the prize, although agencies and people connected to it have often won the award in previous years.\n\nLast year's winner was the president of South Korea, Kim Dae-jung. He was praised for his drive for reconciliation with North Korea.\n\nThe committee selected this year's winner on September 28, more than two weeks after the attacks on New York and Washington.\n\nThe Nobel prizes were created by the Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel in his will and are presented on the anniversary of his death in 1896.\n\nThe first Nobel Peace Prize, in 1901, went to Jean Henry Dunant, the Swiss founder of the Red Cross."
