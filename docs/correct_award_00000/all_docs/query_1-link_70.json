        "text": "Despairing for his future, Makur was close to giving up, until one day he was given a prosthetic leg, and with it a new lease of life. Makur now devotes his life to helping others who have been injured in the war to walk again.\n\nMakur works at an International Committee of the Red Cross centre in South Sudan. The ICRC have received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1917, 1944 and 1963.\n\nICRC\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross was awarded the 1963 Nobel Peace Prize for promoting the principles of the Geneva Convention and cooperation with the UN. The first Geneva Convention, from 1864, gave protection to sick and wounded soldiers in land-based warfare. In 1906 the Convention was expanded to include naval warfare. In response to the events of WWI, the revised Geneva Convention of 1929 also included the protection of prisoners of war. After the close of WWII, the Geneva Convention of 1949 was adopted, encompassing protection of civilians held by the enemy in wartime."
