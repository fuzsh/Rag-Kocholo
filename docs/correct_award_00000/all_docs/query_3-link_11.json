The Red Cross has since saved countless lives and relieved human suffering around the world. The Geneva Convention established that those treating war wounded, wearing a red cross, would not be attacked. With this Convention, Dunant began the creation of international humanitarian law to reduce the suffering caused by war. Despite Dunant’s vital contributions, he has been largely forgotten. This article briefly tells the story of this dedicated humanitarian leader and of his great achievements.",
