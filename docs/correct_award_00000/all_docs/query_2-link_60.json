        "text": "Washington, DC – Congresswoman Claudia Tenney (NY-24) today nominated former President Donald Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize for his groundbreaking efforts to foster peace and cooperation between Israel, Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan, and the United Arab Emirates through the Abraham Accords.\n\nIn 2020, President Trump negotiated the normalization agreements between Israel, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, and Sudan, which were signed in December 2020 and January 2021. Trump also worked diligently to lay the groundwork for a future normalization agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia. The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded for the peace agreement between Israel and Egypt in 1978 and for the Oslo Accords in 1994. Yet, the Abraham Accords, achieved by President Trump, continue to go unrecognized by the Nobel Peace Prize Committee. Today, Tenney nominated former President Donald Trump to recognize his efforts in achieving these historic normalization agreements.\n\n“Donald Trump was instrumental in facilitating the first new peace agreements in the Middle East in almost 30 years,” said Congresswoman Tenney. “For decades, bureaucrats, foreign policy “professionals,” and international organizations insisted that additional Middle East peace agreements were impossible without a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. President Trump proved that to be false. The valiant efforts by President Trump in creating the Abraham Accords were unprecedented and continue to go unrecognized by the Nobel Peace Prize Committee, underscoring the need for his nomination today. Now more than ever, when Joe Biden’s weak leadership on the international stage is threatening our country’s safety and security, we must recognize Trump for his strong leadership and his efforts to achieve world peace. I am honored to nominate former President Donald Trump today and am eager for him to receive the recognition he deserves.”\n\n###"
