        "text": "Each term, all our school community, children and adults, are placed in 4 different teams, and given the opportunity to learn together across the school (or in this year’s case bubbles!), earning STAR tokens for showing our TMS rules. Mr Bagley has been doing a bit of research over the Christmas break about the Nobel Peace Prizes and has found 4 people we need to learn about for their amazing contribution and dedication for ‘doing the right thing’. Thank you Mr Bagley for your choice – here is a little bit of information to get your started!\n\nRed Team – Henry Dunant\n\nHenry Dunant was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1901. He was a Swiss business man who had a keen interest in helping soldiers in the wartime. He was the cofounder of The Red Cross, which is a charity which promotes friendship, kindness, co-operation and lasting peace, while giving help to others regardless of gender, nationality, religious beliefs, race … or the which side of the battlefield. Around the world, whenever a humanitarian crisis occurs, the Red Cross is always one of the first organisations on the scene.\n\nGreen Team – Mother Theresa\n\nMother Teresa was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 for her work to overcome poverty and distress. She was born in 1910 in Skopje (now North Macedonia) and was a missionary and Roman Catholic nun. She lived in India for most of her life. Mother Theresa founded different charities which supported people with leprosy, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis (TB), as well as supporting soup kitchen, orphanages and schools.\n\nShe is recognised as a Saint by the Catholic church as Saint Theresa of Calcutta.\n\nYellow – Malala Yousafzai\n\nMalala is a Pakistani Activist fighting for the rights of all children t have education, especially girls. She is the youngest Nobel Peace Winner at the age of 17. She grew up in a place where the Pakistani Taliban had banned girls from attending school. when she was 12, she wrote a blog about her life under the Taliban and this rose awareness across the world. In 2012, there was an assassination attempt when on a bus returning from school with 2 other girls. She was shot in the head but after an amazing recovery, she was a prominent activist for the right to education.\n\nBlue – Kofi Annan\n\nKofi Annan, born in Ghana in 1938, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2001, when he was working for the United Nations (UN). The prize was for his work to create a “better organised and more peaceful world”. He was well known for reforming the Human Rights system, fighting for a fairer, better life. He played a central role in the creation of the Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria, the adoption of the UN’s first ever anti-terrorism strategy and supported the UN to protect people from war crimes against humanity.\n\nI wonder who will win the Prize in 2021. Here are some of the favourites:\n\nThe World Health Organisation\n\nJacinda Adern\n\nGreta Thurnberg\n\nMichelle Obama\n\nBlack Lives Matter\n\nJoe Biden\n\nMoon Jae-in"
