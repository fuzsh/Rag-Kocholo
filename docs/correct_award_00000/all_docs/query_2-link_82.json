        "text": "The Nobel Peace Prize is one of the five Nobel Prizes created by the Swedish industrialist, inventor and armaments manufacturer, Alfred Nobel. Since 1901, it has been awarded annually in December to those who have “done the most, or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses“.\n\nIn accordance with Alfred Nobel’s will, the recipient is selected by the Norwegian Nobel Committee, a five-member committee appointed by the Parliament of Norway. Nobel died in 1896, and no one really knows why he chose peace as a prize category. As a chemical engineer, the categories for chemistry and physics were obvious choices.\n\nThe reasoning behind the peace prize is less clear, but an adjacent explanation might come from his friendship with Bertha von Suttner, a peace activist and later recipient of the prize, who must have discussed the issue of the fact that his inventions were widely used in war. Dynamite and ballistite were both used violently during his lifetime.\n\nGuess who never won the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nDue to its political nature, the Nobel Peace Prize has always been the subject of controversies. In 2006, the former director of the Nobel Institute, Geir Lundestad, said the greatest omission in the prize’s history was never awarding the peace prize to the Indian political activist, Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nAccording to Lundestad, Gandhi was shortlisted five times (twice before World War II, then in 1946, 1947 and 1948), but the committee’s Euro-centric viewpoint and its failure to appreciate the struggle for freedom in colonies kept Gandhi from receiving the award.​"
