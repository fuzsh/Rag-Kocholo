        "text": "In support of the UCIHL’s mandate of providing high level instruction in the field of humanitarian law, the Fondation Prix Henry Dunant is offering an annual prize to a particularly outstanding academic work of a UCIHL student.\n\nThe Fondation’s aim in awarding this prize is to bring attention to the role of those who, like Henry Dunant, the founder of the Red Cross movement, embody a spiritual commitment in fighting for human dignity with their research, ideas, and their gift for communication.\n\nThe prize 2006 was awarded to Ms. Wibke Timmermann, a German national first of her promotion. The author critically analyzes the status of the different speech acts related to hate propaganda in international law, that is, hate speech, direct and public incitement, instigation, and war propaganda.\n\nThe selection committee was particularly impressed by the link made by the author between the law and hate speech. The potential impact of such an academic work on international events is not to be underestimated. At the same time, her work advances the ideals of Henry Dunant."
