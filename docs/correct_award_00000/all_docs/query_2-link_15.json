        "text": "The three Presidents who have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize all have family ties to the state of Georgia.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt was awarded the 1906 Nobel Peace Prize for mediating the Russo-Japanese War, reached a Gentleman's Agreement on immigration with Japan, and sent the Great White Fleet on a goodwill tour of the world. His mother, Mittie Bulloch , was born in Hartford, Connecticut but was raised in Savannah, Georgia and then moved to Roswell, Georgia when she was five.\n\nWoodrow Wilson was awarded the 1919 Nobel Peace Prize for his work to bring peace to all nations but died without seeing the Leagues of Nations happen. Wilson was born in Staunton, Virginia but spent the formative years of his childhood in Augusta, years that would affect him for the rest of his life. While living in Augusta Wilson experienced the hardships of the Civil War and Reconstruction."
