        "text": "Henry Dunant\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize 1901\n\nNobel co-recipient: Frédéric Passy\n\nRole: Founder of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Geneva, Originator Geneva Convention (Convention de Genève)\n\nNobel Prize Cash and Philanthropy\n\nJean Henry Dunant, though poor, donated his Nobel Prize money to charity. Hans Daae, a military physician, managed to get the money deposited in a bank in Norway. Thus Dunant’s creditors could not claim the money. When Dunant was alive the money remained untouched in the bank. He lived frugally in a Swiss nursing home.\n\nDunant’s will bequeathed one half of the money to the Norwegian Red Cross and the Norwegian Women’s Public Health Association. The will bequeathed the other half of the money to charities in Switzerland.\n\nDaae was also responsible for Dunant being awarded the Noble Prize."
