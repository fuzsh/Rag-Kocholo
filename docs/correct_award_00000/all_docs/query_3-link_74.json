        "text": "HONOLULU, HI: 11/20/2020 – The American Red Cross of Hawaii announces a new giving society, the Henri Dunant Society, founded by Dr John Henry Felix, PhD, who serves as its Honorary Chair. Felix and the Henri Dunant Society invite new members with a $10,000 annual donation to the Hawaii Red Cross; donations support the organization’s humanitarian relief efforts.\n\n“We’re grateful for the lifetime legacy of service of John Henry Felix to promote and strengthen the efforts of the Red Cross,” says Diane Peters-Nguyen, CEO of the American Red Cross Pacific Islands Region. “He was the first American and only one of two to be awarded the Henri Dunant Award in recognition of his efforts in the international humanitarian realm.”\n\nThe society’s namesake, Henri Dunant, is a co-founder of the Red Cross. After witnessing a bloody battle in Solferino, Italy in 1859, Dunant organized locals to aid injured soldiers. His call for a relief organization helped establish the Red Cross and pointed the way to the future Geneva Conventions. In 1901, he received the first Nobel Peace Prize for his work.\n\nToday, there are 186 Red Cross and Red Crescent National Societies reaching 150 million people each year – the world’s largest volunteer-based organization.\n\nJohn Henry Felix began his work with the Red Cross in Hawaii as a 3rd grader and has remained actively involved for over 80 years. He has traveled to help refugees from Mozambique to Vietnam, established Red Cross programs throughout the Pacific and was the first American to be awarded the highest honor of the International Red Cross – the Henri Dunant Medal. It is exhausting work, but John Henry says that keeping the goal of aiding those in need keeps him going. “It is gratifying work and I want to encourage others, particularly young leaders in our community to become engaged and make a difference.”\n\nLocally, John Henry has spearheaded water safety programs, supported Services to the Armed Forces and played a major role in securing the Hawaii Red Cross Diamond Head Headquarters. He joined the Hawaii Board of Directors in 1955 and remains on as a leadership volunteer as Chairman Emeritus on the Board. His legacy as a volunteer has not slowed down over time. “There’s so much to do and so little time to do it,” John Henry says. “So, why stop?”\n\nThe Red Cross is a non-profit humanitarian organization which provides assistance to meet the immediate emergency needs of those affected by disasters. All Red Cross assistance to disaster victims is free. The Red Cross is not a government agency; it depends on public contributions to help others. Your gift supports the lifesaving mission of the American Red Cross in your community, across the country and around the world. To send a contribution, mail your check to:\n\nAmerican Red Cross of Hawaii\n\n4155 Diamond Head Road\n\nHonolulu, HI 96816\n\nMake a secure online donation at redcross.org/hawaii or call: (808) 739-8109"
