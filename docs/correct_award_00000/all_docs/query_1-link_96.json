        "text": "This Day In Weather History is a daily podcast by Chris Mei from The Weather Network, featuring stories about people, communities and events and how weather impacted them.\n\n--\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) was founded by Henry Dunant on Feb. 17, 1863, in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nDunant started the humanitarian organization after travelling to Italy and seeing the overwhelming aftermath of the Battle of Solferino. A lot occurred between those two events, but ultimately he founded the Red Cross, which currently operates in 192 countries.\n\nThroughout its history, the Red Cross has earned three Nobel Prizes.\n\nOn Dec. 10, 1917, the Red Cross received its first Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nThe organization won this honour after three years of it not being awarded, as there were no candidates deemed worthy during the First World War.\n\nIn 1917, professor Louis Renault, a past Nobel Prize winner, laureate, and the government of Switzerland, nominated the ICRC for establishing the Prisoner-of-War Agency.\n\nThe Prisoner-of-War Agency supported soldiers who were captured by enemy forces. They also provided communication opportunities between the soldiers and their families. By 1917, the agency supported more than 800,000 soldiers.\n\nThe ICRC also won a Nobel Prize in 1944 and 1963.\n\nBecause the Red Cross operates in almost all countries, the organization is present during international emergencies and disasters, providing support to local communities.\n\nRed Cross relief efforts in Honduras, taken in November 2020.Courtesy: Storyful\n\nThe Canadian Red Cross has certainly been present during emergencies and evacuations.\n\nOne of the most notable, and the most expensive, Canadian disaster was the 2016 Fort McMurray, Alta. wildfire. The fire burned 590,000 hectares, caused more than 70,000 people to evacuate their homes, destroyed 2,400 houses and buildings, and cost $9.9 billion.\n\nCourtesy: Wikipedia\n\nThe Canadian Red Cross led the aid for the evacuees in association with the government other charitable organizations.\n\nTo hear more about the Red Cross and its first Nobel Peace Prize, listen to today's episode of \"This Day In Weather History.\"\n\nSubscribe to 'This Day in Weather History': Apple Podcasts | Amazon Alexa | Google Assistant | Spotify | Google Podcasts | iHeartRadio | Overcast'\n\nThumbnail courtesy: Red Cross"
