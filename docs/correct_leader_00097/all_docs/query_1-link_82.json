        "text": "On May 9, the Rule of Law Digital Center Madrid of the World Law Foundation hosted the Presentation of the book «Venezuela: Politics & Environment» by Antonio Ledezma, politician and former Mayor of Caracas currently in exile. The work portrays the country’s rich environment and resources and proposes a plan for a future that, in Ledezma’s words, will be «headed by Edmundo González Urrutia, with whom it will be possible for us to turn the page».\n\nThe event was attended by Felipe González, former Prime Minister of Spain, Felipe Calderón, former President of Mexico, Diego Arria, former Secretary General of the UN Security Council, Humberto Calderón Berti, former President of Venezuelan oil giant PDVSA, and David Malavé, Founder of Kalathos Libros.\n\nGabriel Fernández, International Advisor of the World Law Foundation and Representative of the World Jurist Association to the UN Vienna, opened the event emphasizing that Ledezma’s work is an invitation for all to implement their knowledge to advance in current society; which, in his words, “is funded in three fundamental pillars: the rule of law, information technologies and the power of human capital».\n\nFor his part, former Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, who accounts for a long history of pro-democracy activism in connection with Venezuela, analyzed its current political situation: «Venezuela [preparing to hold elections next July] is at long awaited historic moment. The degree of destruction has been extensive. Venezuela needs freedom, needs democracy, needs rights». Adding that, «when it comes to voting, international aid is needed, so that votes are counted correctly”. Gonzalez also claimed that, although “many of those who have fled the country will not have the opportunity to vote, Maduro’s defeat is ripe». In this sense, Humberto Calderón Berti recalled that «the country has reacted. What is happening means awareness of the greatest majority of the population, who are betting on a change. And change is just around the corner»."
