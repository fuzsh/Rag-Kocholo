        "text": "The ‘Willy Brandt – Politikerleben’ exhibition at the Willy Brandt Foundation's old headquarters near the Brandenburg Gate culminated in a display of the Order of Service of the West German chancellor's state funeral on 17 October 1992, a photograph of Brandt's casket and a radio broadcast of a farewell speech delivered at the memorial.Footnote 3 Only one person was present in all three exhibition memorabilia – Felipe González, the former president of Spain. The only non-German listed in the Order of Service, González was seen in the photograph standing next to Brandt's casket as he delivered his farewell speech in Spanish – the broadcast included a voice-over in German – at the first state funeral held at the Reichstag in a reunified Berlin.\n\nDespite the public spotlight on González at Brandt's funeral and in the foundation's curatorial display, which clearly highlights their bond, there are no academic texts that explore the connection between the two politicians. Published in 2018, Willy Brandt and International Relations: Europe, the USA and Latin America is a most welcome contribution to scholarship on Brandt and the only book in English to address his politics as an elder statesman between 1974 and 1992.Footnote 4 However, with only a few passing references to González, it offers little on their relationship. Even Hélène Miard-Delacroix's recent biography (published in both French and English), Willy Brandt: Life of a Statesman, mentions González only twice: when the two men met formally for the first time in Portugal in 1974 and later when Brandt asked González to deliver his eulogy in 1992.Footnote 5 There is no discussion of what occurred between the two dates, though much must have passed between the two men to establish a relationship such that Brandt would ask González to deliver the eulogy at his state funeral. This is also the case with biographies of Brandt in German, even though Hans-Joachim Noack calls González Brandt's ‘politische[r] Ziehsohn’ – his political adopted son.Footnote 6\n\nA review of the scholarship on political parties reveals a similar picture. Despite his lifelong interest in Spain and democratisation in the Iberian Peninsula, Brandt is mentioned only once in a recent study on Southern European socialism in the 1970s.Footnote 7 Earlier important works on the support the Friedrich Ebert Foundation (Friedrich Ebert Stiftung; FES) offered the Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party (Partido Socialista Obrero Español; PSOE) during Spain's transition from dictatorship to democracy also fail to explore the personal and intellectual link between González and Brandt.Footnote 8 Works on socialist transnational networks at a European level, whether of a more structured or intellectual kind, have little to say about the subject.Footnote 9\n\nHowever, political advisors to both men have often remarked that Brandt and González shared an almost ‘father–son’ relationship. Indeed, in a recent interview, Luis Yáñez-Barnuevo (the PSOE's international secretary from 1974 to 1979) observed that ‘they were like father and son’.Footnote 10 Such remarks reveal that Brandt and González shared a strong emotional bond which is in itself a subject worthy of academic exploration and one that historical research has yet to catch up with. Yet were there political-intellectual underpinnings to their affective rapport as well?\n\nIn his memoir, Pierre Mauroy, the first socialist French prime minister under President François Mitterrand, described González as Brandt's ‘spiritual son’ in a political context, implying that their bond contained an important intellectual element.Footnote 11 This description is particularly revealing because Brandt served as president of the Socialist International (SI) for two decades, and Mauroy assumed the role a month before Brandt's death. Mauroy thus acknowledged that, although he was Brandt's institutional successor, the continuity of Brandt's intellectual project lay with González. Indeed, Walter Haubrich, the Frankfurter Allgemeine's Spanish correspondent from the late 1960s and for over three decades, called theirs a ‘political father–son relationship’.Footnote 12\n\nThis article unpacks the term fils spirituel used by Mauroy to refer to the bond between Brandt and González. The research is based on memoirs; interviews with senior policy makers, including González himself and former US Secretary of State George Shultz; archival material from the FES and the Willy Brandt Archive in Bonn; new or underexplored material from the Felipe González Foundation in Madrid, the Pablo Iglesias Foundation in Alcalá de Henares, the Mário Soares Foundation in Lisbon, the Bruno Kreisky Foundation in Vienna and the Swedish Labour Movement's Archive in Stockholm; and exclusive additional private papers and CIA reports."
