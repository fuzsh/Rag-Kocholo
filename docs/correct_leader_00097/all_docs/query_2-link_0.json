        "text": "Felipe González Márquez (born March 5, 1942, Sevilla, Spain) is a Spanish lawyer and Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party (Partido Socialista Obrero Español; PSOE) politician who was prime minister of Spain from 1982 to 1996. During his four terms in office, he consolidated Spain’s fledgling democracy, oversaw continued economic growth, and brought Spain into the European Economic Community (EEC; succeeded by the European Union).\n\nThe son of a livestock handler, González was the only one of five children to attend college. He studied first to be a civil engineer at the University of Sevilla before transferring to its law faculty. He also later studied the law at the Catholic University of Leuven (Louvain) in Belgium. While still a student, he became involved in the socialist movement, joining the outlawed PSOE in 1964. He started a law practice in Sevilla, specializing in the defense of workers’ rights, and in 1965 moved to Madrid, where he served as a member of the party’s provincial council. By 1974 he had risen to become secretary-general of the party. As leader, González was responsible for removing Marxism from the party’s program.\n\nMore From Britannica\n\nSpain: The administration of Felipe González, 1982–96\n\nGonzález broadened his party’s popular appeal and electoral base so that in the 1977 general elections the now-legalized PSOE emerged as the second largest political party in the Cortes, the Spanish parliament. González’s moderate stance and his youthful, attractive public image helped his party to a sweeping victory in the 1982 general elections; he became, at age 40, Europe’s youngest head of government.\n\nAs prime minister, González froze Spain’s participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization but supported his country’s entry into the EEC in 1986. His pragmatic domestic policies were aimed at reducing inflation, modernizing the economy through free-market policies, furthering Spain’s economic integration within western Europe by means of the EEC, and transferring significant powers to Spain’s regional governments. His government expanded health care benefits and extended educational opportunities to Spaniards of all classes. González broke with the remnants of Spain’s authoritarian past by expanding freedom of the press and ensuring the independent functioning of the judiciary.\n\nThe PSOE was reelected in 1986 and 1989, but with diminishing majorities. An economic boom sparked by Spain’s entry into the EEC gave way in 1990 to successive years of slow growth and an unemployment level that had reached more than 20 percent by 1993. In elections that year the PSOE failed to capture a majority of seats in the Cortes, but González was able to form a minority government by means of a parliamentary alliance with the main Catalonian nationalist party. González retained much of his popularity with the voters, and the economy began to recover in 1994, but Spain’s unemployment remained the highest of any country in the European Union."
