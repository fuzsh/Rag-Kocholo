        "text": "It was around one year ago that Tijjani Reijnders arrived at AC Milan from AZ Alkmaar, and it would be fair to say his first season was a success.\n\nHaving come from the Netherlands, Reijnders quickly established himself as a starter in the Milan midfield, one which needed to be rebuilt after the departure of Sandro Tonali to Newcastle. What quickly followed was a fixed spot in the national team, too.\n\nHe ranked among the top 10 players in Serie A for chances created from open play, passes completed in the final third of the pitch and through-balls, showing that he is an all-action midfielder for Milan."
