        "text": "González’s time in office was also defined by significant reforms such as the installation of free public education, making a university education more accessible to all, and the establishment of a wide-ranging social security system that included universal healthcare. He also carried out a major industrial refurbishment plan as well as an army overhaul.\n\nIn 2007, the Minister’s Council named him plenipotentiary Extraordinary Ambassador for the celebration of the bicentenary of America’s Independence. He was also named president of the Group for Reflection on the Future of Europe, known as the Think Tank Committee of the Wise, which was dissolved in 2010. González is also a member of the Orientation European Committee, “Our Europe”; the International Council of the Shimon Peres Center for Peace; the InterAction Council; the Club of Madrid; and the Montevideo Circle."
