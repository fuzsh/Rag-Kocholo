        "text": "On 24 March 2022, the Natolin Academy of Migration virtually hosted a high-level lecture by Mr Felipe GONZÁLEZ MORALES, United Nations Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants.\n\nMr Felipe GONZÁLEZ MORALES presented the nexus between migration and human rights. The mandate of the Special Rapporteur covers all countries and was created to examine ways and means to overcome the obstacles existing to the complete and adequate protection of the human rights of all migrants at all stages of migration, as well as to elaborate recommendations on strengthening the promotion, protection, and implementation of the human rights of all migrants. Drawing from his office’s reports, he also talked about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on migration. After the presentation, the rapporteur took questions from students. The meeting’s goal was for the students to learn about primary challenges associated with the rights of migrants and see how the United Nations and its bodies deal with issues related to migration and human rights.\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nFelipe González Morales was appointed by the Human Rights Council in June 2017 as the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants. He is a Professor of International Law at the Diego Portales University, in Santiago, Chile, where he is also the Director of a Master in International Human Rights Law. He was a Commissioner and the Rapporteur on Migrants between 2008 and 2015 at the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, where he was President between 2010-2011.\n\nProfessor González has taught International Human Rights Law since 2003 at several postgraduate programs at the University Carlos III in Madrid, as well as in several other universities in Spain. Since 2001, he has been teaching at the American University Human Rights Academy in Washington, D.C. He is the founder and was the first Director of the Center for Human Rights at the Diego Portales University. He is also the founder and was the first Director of a Latin American Network of Human Rights Legal Clinics.\n\nProfessor González holds a Doctorate and a Master in Advanced Human Rights from University Carlos III and an LL.M. in International Legal Studies from American University."
