        "text": "Jorge Felipe-Gonzalez is an assistant professor in the Department of History at the University of Texas in San Antonio. With a diverse academic background, he obtained his B.A. in History from the University of Havana in Cuba and served as an assistant professor in the Department of History there before relocating to the United States in 2013. In 2019, he successfully earned his Ph.D. in History from Michigan State University.\n\nAs a fellow at the Hutchins Center, Dr. Felipe-Gonzalez will work on \"The Slave-Trading Mafia: Transatlantic Networks and the Foundation of the Cuban-based Slave Trade.\" This extensive research project and forthcoming book draw upon a decade of investigation utilizing multinational archival sources from Cuba, the U.S., Spain, The United Kingdom, and Sierra Leone. The book delves into the complex dynamics of Cuba's emergence and expansion as a prominent transatlantic slave-trading colony during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. \"The Slave-Trading Mafia\" uncovers the significant influx of American slave traders to Cuba following the abolition of the slave trade in 1808. Dr. Felipe-Gonzalez presents meticulous archival evidence to demonstrate the pivotal role of this relocation in the establishment and expansion of Cuba's transatlantic slave-trading industry, as well as its connections with Western Africa. The book, with its comprehensive Atlantic scope, also explores the establishment of Cuban-financed slave trading stations in Africa and their far-reaching socio-political impact on African polity, particularly in southern Sierra Leone.\n\nHe actively participates in initiatives such as the Transatlantic and Intra-American Slave Trade Databases and the People of the Transatlantic Slave Trade (PAST) projects. As the co-director, alongside Dr. Marial Iglesias Utset, of the Hutchins Center's research project titled \"Cuba, the United States, and the Atlantic Slave Trade,\" his collaborative efforts have been instrumental in advancing international research and securing grant funding."
