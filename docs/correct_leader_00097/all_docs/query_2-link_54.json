        "text": "Over the last year of Public Defenseless, Hunter spent a lot of time speaking with Chief Public Defenders from commissions and state-wide offices around the country. This top down view of Public Defense is extremely valuable and will be something that you hear more of on the show, but Hunter also realized he neglected to get the voices of line public defenders on the show. Over the course of the year, more episodes with line public defenders, like the one today, will be coming your way!\n\nToday, Hunter spoke with Felipe Gonzalez, a felony public defender in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. His story, like many line defenders around the country is impossible to tell without discussing crippling caseloads, staffing shortages, and prosecutors who religiously advocate for no bail for most accused of a crime. Yet despite this, Felipe is able to rely on the tight knit office community to weather the storms inherent in the work. We hope you enjoy the first of many conversations with the line defenders who serve as the back bone of public defense around the country!\n\nGuest:\n\nFelipe Gonzalez, Felony Public Defender, Anne Arundel County Maryland\n\nResources:\n\nAnne Arundel County PD Office\n\nhttps://www.opd.state.md.us/anne-arundel\n\nContact Hunter Parnell:\n\nhwparnell@publicdefenseless.com\n\nInstagram\n\n@PublicDefenselessPodcast\n\nTwitter\n\n@PDefenselessPod"
