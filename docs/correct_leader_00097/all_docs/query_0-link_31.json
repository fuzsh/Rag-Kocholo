        "text": "Just over a month previously, more than seventy per cent of the electorate went to the polls, a higher turnout than in previous years and votes were concentrated on the two main parties: the PSOE and the Spanish conservative Partido Popular (PP).\n\nMinority parties which previously had seats in the government made big losses.\n\nThe PSOE's strongest support was in Andalucía, where the party had traditionally had a stronghold (the PSOE lost control to the PP for the first time in Spain's democracy in 2018).\n\nIn the province of Malaga the socialist party won 97 of its 100 local councils with the PP beating them only in Torremolinos, and Júzcar, while the left-wing Izquierda Unida won Arriate.\n\nOne of the biggest losers of the 1993 election was Jesús Gil and his party of the same name, who swept to power in Marbella's local elections just two years earlier. The GIL party, which had candidates in every province in Andalucía, won only one tenth of the votes.\n\nFelipe González, who was first elected as prime minister in 1982 with a landslide victory when he promised to \"change the face of Spain\", said that he understood the message from the electorate that it was time to ring the changes again.\n\nHe continued as prime minister until May 1996, when his party narrowly lost the general elections to the PP.\n\nAmong his achievements in 14 years of being prime minister, Felipe González oversaw the implementation of the welfare state, a complete reform of the Spanish armed forces, Spain's entry into the European Economic Community (now European Union) and universal access to education and health."
