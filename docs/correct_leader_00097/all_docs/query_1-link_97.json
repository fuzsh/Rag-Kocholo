        "text": "A reporter at Arizona's most-watched television news station says Gilbert police illegally seized his cellphone and threatened to access its contents by \"brute force\" after he was unlawfully arrested while covering the death of a Chandler police officer in April.\n\nIn a 28-page motion filed Thursday in Gilbert Municipal Court, attorneys representing journalist León Felipe González Cortés of Univision Arizona, based in Phoenix, say police also violated his First Amendment rights as a reporter and derisively referred to him as \"compadre\" in reference to his Latino heritage.\n\nPolice have held the phone for more than a month, and attorneys for the town and the police department have \"gone silent\" and refused to discuss returning it, the complaint states.\n\nAccording to the motion, officers told González, who was wearing a Univision shirt and accompanied by a photojournalist from the station, that he was on the wrong side of a police line established to secure the crime scene. He was arrested on charges of trespassing and hindering a police investigation.\n\nUnivision Arizona President and General Manager Joe Donnarumma said González was unjustly arrested while doing his constitutionally protected job.\n\n\"Freedom of the press is a cornerstone of our democracy, as are the tools, technologies and constitutionally protected newsgathering activities that our journalists employ every day across the country to keep our audiences informed,\" Donnarumma said in a statement to The Arizona Republic.\n\n\"Univision stands with and supports Leon Felipe González Cortés' calls for the State of Arizona and the Gilbert Police Department to immediately return his cellular phone, a mobile journalism tool which was seized on baseless and unreasonable grounds.\n\n\"It’s unacceptable that the Gilbert Police Department is unlawfully violating Mr. González Cortés’s constitutional rights as a journalist. The Police Department’s violation of his constitutional rights diminishes the rights of us all.\"\n\nGilbert police Chief Michael Soelberg and Town Attorney Chris Payne did not immediately respond to requests for comment from The Republic.\n\nOn Friday, town spokeswoman Jennifer Harrison sent a statement saying that González was arrested \"after he intentionally walked inside a clearly-marked crime scene during the criminal investigation\" of the Chandler officer's death, which also involved serious injuries to a Gilbert police officer.\n\nShe added that González \"by his own admission, captured digital photographs and/or video footage from inside the scene,\" and that his phone \"was seized as evidence at the time of his arrest, as the Police Department had probable cause to believe that the phone contained evidence of his criminal conduct.\"\n\nShe said the town believes the seizure is supported by federal law and \"is confident that when the actual facts come to light, the Gilbert Police Department will be exonerated from the allegations levied by the attorneys for Mr. González Cortés.\"\n\nShe said the town would have no further comment \"in order to protect the rights of Mr. González Cortés and the integrity of the prosecution.\"\n\nGonzález was arrested April 30, a day after Officer Chris Farrar and a Gilbert police officer were struck by a stolen vehicle driven by a wanted felon. Farrar died, and the other officer was critically injured before the suspect was shot and taken into custody.\n\nThe complaint states that Gilbert police Sgt. John Gillis and Officer Marianne Robb \"admitted they knew Mr. González Cortés was a journalist engaged in newsgathering.\"\n\nIt also states that: \"At one point Sergeant Gillis derisively used the word 'compadre' when speaking with Mr. González Cortés about the newsgathering work he and the Univision photographer were doing at the scene.\"\n\nThe complaint states that Robb seized González's cellphone, which contains both personal information and protected journalistic work product unrelated to the April 29 crimes.\n\nThat information is protected by the federal Privacy Protection Act of 1980 as well as the Arizona Constitution, the Arizona Shield Law and the Arizona Media Subpoena Law, the complaint states.\n\nRelated reading: Scottsdale restaurant owner admits taking Republic reporter's phones in robbery\n\nDavid Cuillier, a professor at the University of Arizona School of Journalism and a nationally recognized expert on press freedom issues, said the seizure of a reporter's cellphone is unacceptable.\n\n\"Police have a right to protect the integrity of a crime scene, but confiscating and breaking into a journalist’s cellphone crosses the line,\" he said.\n\nCuillier, a national past president of the Society of Professional Journalists who has testified on First Amendment issues before Congress, said that this year alone some 50 journalists nationwide have been arrested or detained by police, and many of them have had notes or cameras seized.\n\n\"In most cases, the police departments end up apologizing when they realize what they did was wrong,\" he said. \"We can be a better nation than that, and I hope in this case the Gilbert Police Department takes the high road and hands the phone back, intact and unpilfered. Whether or not a court forces them to do so, it’s the right thing to do.\"\n\nChris Kline, CEO and president of the Arizona Broadcasters Association, said the arrest and seizure were concerning.\n\n\"The Arizona Broadcasters Association adamantly supports the critical role played by reporters in covering the news and keeping our communities informed,\" Kline said. \"We are concerned by the allegations against the Univision crew, support the rights of our local press, and call upon the leadership at Gilbert police to closely review the incident.\"\n\nAccording to the complaint, Gilbert police did not obtain a warrant to seize the phone or examine its contents.\n\nThe complaint states that González's attorneys have made numerous attempts to have the phone returned, but that Gillis responded by saying he believes the phone contains photos that may incriminate González.\n\nGillis also \"warned that he would be surprised if González Cortés ever gets his phone back, since there may be photos ... that may be used as evidence in the separate investigation and prosecution of the suspect involved in the April 29 event.\"\n\nAccording to the complaint, a subsequent discussion with attorneys for the town and the Police Department resulted in a threat from police attorney Zachary Altman to get a warrant or \"to use 'brute force'\" to search the phone without a password.\n\nThe complaint alleges that the attorneys have \"gone silent\" and refused to respond to communications from González Cortés' attorneys.\n\nInstead, police leveled an additional charge of trespassing against González Cortés nearly a month after his arrest, despite the fact that the property owner where the trespassing allegedly occurred declined to prosecute.\n\nAccording to the complaint, police failed to establish probable cause for arresting González Cortés and violated his constitutional rights by seizing his phone.\n\nIt also states that the claim that the phone may contain evidence of the initial crime is far-fetched because police had ample time to take photos of their own when the suspect was arrested.\n\nJohn D'Anna is a reporter on The Arizona Republic/azcentral.com storytelling team.
