After several decades of continuous global poverty reduction, a period of significant crises and shocks resulted in three years of lost progress between 2020-2022. Low-income countries, which saw poverty increase during this period, have not yet recovered. In 2022, a total of 712 million people globally were living in extreme poverty, an increase of 23 million people compared to 2019.\n\nPoverty & Shared Prosperity 2022: Correcting Course\n\nThe world is unlikely to meet the goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030 absent history-defying rates of economic growth over the remainder of this decade, according to the latest Poverty and Shared Prosperity report."
