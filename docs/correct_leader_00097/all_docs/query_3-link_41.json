The main focus of the visit was on labour migration from Bangladesh, a country of origin for many migrant workers, in over 160 countries.\n\nThe Special Rapporteur noted the significant work made by the authorities of Bangladesh to adopt legislative and policy measures to regulate labour migration. However, he highlighted his concerns regarding gaps relating to recruitment practices, support and assistance for migrants in countries of destination, particularly where serious human rights violations had been reported and where stronger cooperation was required for the protection of migrant workers.\n\nThe Special Rapporteur highlights areas of concern and the various human rights abuses faced by migrant workers, with particular reference to women, who comprise around 10 per cent of Bangladeshi migrant workers abroad. He also highlights the need to enhance data collection on migrant workers and strengthen support for returning migrants. He provided observations on the situation of Rohingya in camps in Cox’s Bazar District and other parts of Bangladesh, noting his concerns relating to their lack of legal status and the protracted humanitarian situation that they currently face.\n\nAnnex\n\nReport of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, Felipe González Morales, on his visit to Bangladesh\n\nI. Introduction\n\nAt the invitation of the Government of Bangladesh, the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, Felipe González Morales, conducted an official visit to the country from 20 to 31 January 2023. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government for its valuable cooperation throughout the preparation and the conduct of his visit. He is particularly grateful to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for leading the coordination in preparing the visit as well as to the United Nations country team for its support and assistance.\n\nThe Special Rapporteur held meetings in Dhaka with government representatives and staff, including from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Expatriates’ Welfare and Overseas Employment, the Bangladesh Overseas Employment and Services Limited, the Wage Earners’ Welfare Board, the Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training, the Ministry of Social Welfare, the Ministry of Education’s Technical and Madrasah Education Division, the National Human Rights Commission, the National Legal Aid Office, civil society organizations, trade unions and recruitment agencies, the Director-General of the Coast Guard and migrants, including returning migrant workers. The Special Rapporteur also met with representatives from various United Nations agencies, including those in the United Nations Network on Migration, and representatives of the diplomatic corps and development partners.\n\nIn Cox’s Bazar, he met with a representative of the Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commission and representatives of the United Nations country team and the Anti-Trafficking Working Group. He also met with Rohingyas in the refugee camps located in Ukhiya.\n\nThe Special Rapporteur wishes to sincerely thank all stakeholders who took the time to meet and share information with him. He is particularly grateful for the excellent support provided by the United Nations country team throughout the visit and by the government representatives in Dhaka and Cox’s Bazar.\n\nThe Special Rapporteur conducted his visit after official missions were carried out by his peers, including the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons especially women and children, and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights in the context of climate change. In-depth analyses on issues related to trafficking and climate change in Bangladesh were made by those mandate holders, and reference will be made to those issues in the present report."
