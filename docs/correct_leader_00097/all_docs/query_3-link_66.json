This study evaluates the neurocognitive benefits of bovine milk fat globule membrane supplementation in formula, comparing it to standard formula and assessing its noninferiority to breast milk. Data were sourced from studies published between January 2000 and March 2024 from PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Embase. Eight randomized controlled trials involving 1352 healthy term neonates, infants, and children up to 2 years old were included. Bovine milk fat globule membrane supplementation was significantly associated with improved cognitive development (mean difference: 3.29, 95% CI: 1.65 to 4.93, p < 0.001) and demonstrated minimal heterogeneity (I2 = 0%, p = 0.564). It showed significant improvement in executive function but not in language, motor, or social-emotional development. In non-inferiority analysis, there was no significant difference compared to breast milk regarding cognitive development. These findings support bovine milk fat globule membrane as a valuable addition to infant formula for cognitive benefits.

Here, we aimed to examine this association and dose–response relationship among U.S. adults who participated in a NHANES (2003–2018). The intake of whole grain was collected and calculated from two rounds of 24 h dietary recall. Obesity was categorized based on body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC). Weighted multivariable logistic regression models were used to calculate the odds of obesity according to whole-grain intake, and the dose–response relationship was modeled by restricted cubic spline regression. Among the 27,862 participants, 38.3% had general obesity, while 58.3% had abdominal obesity. After multivariate adjustment of potential confounders, the participants in the highest quintile of whole-grain intake had a lower prevalence of general obesity (OR 0.79; 95% CI 0.72–0.88) and abdominal obesity (OR 0.80; 95% CI 0.73–0.89) compared with those in the lowest category. Spline regression showed an inversely linear dose–response association between whole-grain intake and the prevalence of general obesity and abdominal obesity. In conclusion, a higher whole-grain intake was associated with lower odds of obesity, both general and abdominal. Our findings highlight the importance of increasing the whole-grain intake to prevent and manage obesity.

Hepatic carcinogenesis is highly stimulated by chronic inflammation, defined as fibrosis deposition, and an aberrant imbalance between liver necrosis and nodular regeneration. In this context, the gut–liver axis and gut microbiota have demonstrated a critical role in the pathogenesis of HCC, as dysbiosis and altered intestinal permeability promote bacterial translocation, leading to chronic liver inflammation and tumorigenesis through several pathways. A few data exist on the role of the gut microbiota or bacteria resident in the biliary tract in the pathogenesis of CCA, and some microbial metabolites, such as choline and bile acids, seem to show an association. In this review, we analyze the impact of the gut microbiota and its metabolites on HCC and CCA development and the role of gut dysbiosis as a biomarker of hepatobiliary cancer risk and of response during anti-tumor therapy. We also discuss the future application of gut microbiota in hepatobiliary cancer management.

This study used the data from China Nutrition and Health Survey (CNHS) from 2015 to 2017 to estimate the prevalence of inadequate dietary micronutrient intake (including vitamin A, vitamin B1, vitamin B2, vitamin C, cCalcium, iron and sodium) in Chinese adults and further determine the differences in micronutrient intake by gender, age and BMI. A total of 61,768 subjects were included in this study, of which 33,262 (54%) were female. The intake of energy and all macronutrients decreased with age, and the intake was higher in men than in women. Inadequate energy intake occurs in adults of all ages. In terms of nutrient intake, women had a higher rate of insufficient carbohydrate intake than men in all age groups. Inadequate protein intake was more common in women aged 18–49 years (60.9%) than in men. Compared with women, men had a higher rate of vitamin B2 intake. Insufficient vitamin B3 intake was more common in women aged 18–49 years (35.6%), men aged 65–79 years (39.7%) and men aged 80 years and above (47.9%). In all age groups, insufficient vitamin C intake is higher in women than in men—up to 85.8 percent in women aged 80 years old and above. Compared with men in the same age group, insufficient intake of calcium and iron is more obvious in women. Women have significantly higher rates of inadequate intake of calcium, iron and sodium than men. In the analysis of correlations between BMI or demographic data and micronutrient intakes, the likelihood of micronutrient intakes being insufficient was higher in the central and western regions in all age groups compared to the eastern regions. The risk of insufficient micronutrient intake was higher in obese men and women aged 18–49 years and 50–64 years. Underweight and overweight women in the 65–79 age group were more likely to have inadequate micronutrient intake. Obese women over 80 years of age were less likely to have inadequate micronutrient intake. No significant difference was found between urban and rural areas for each age group.

The phenolic compound profile showed that nobiletin was the main flavonoid found in the extracts and digests of Clemenule pomace and extract, while isosinensetin/sinensetin/tangeretin were the ones in the Ortanique samples. The digests of Clemenule and Ortanique extracts showed Folin reaction values of 9.74 and 9.20 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g of sample, ABTS values of 83.2 and 91.7 µmol Trolox equivalents (TE)/g of sample, and ORAC-FL values of 142.8 and 891.6 µmol TE/g of sample, respectively. Extracts (50–500 µg/mL) inhibited intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation in CCD-18Co cells under physiological and oxidative-induced conditions. Clemenule and Ortanique extract digests showed IC50 values of 13.50 and 11.07 mg/mL for α-glucosidase, 28.79 and 69.64 mg/mL for α-amylase, and 16.50 and 12.77 mg/mL for AGEs, and 2.259 ± 0.267 and 0.713 ± 0.065 mg/mL for pancreatic lipase inhibition, respectively. Ortanique extract (250–1000 µg/mL) inhibited the production of nitric oxide in RAW264.7 macrophages under inflammation-induced conditions, and intracellular ROS formation. In conclusion, altogether, the results supported the potential of mandarin extracts to be used as health promoters by reducing the risk of non-communicable chronic diseases.

Treatment in vitro with MH at concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 5.0% (w/v) led to significant dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells, but anti-proliferative effects of MH were less pronounced in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Effects of MH were also tested on non-malignant human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) at 2.5% w/v, and it was found that MH reduced the proliferation of MCF-7 cells but not that of HMECs. Notably, the antitumor activity of MH was in the range of that exerted by treatment of MCF-7 cells with the antiestrogen tamoxifen. Further, MH treatment stimulated apoptosis of MCF-7 cells in vitro, with most cells exhibiting acute and significant levels of apoptosis that correlated with PARP activation. Additionally, the effects of MH induced the activation of AMPK and inhibition of AKT/mTOR downstream signaling. Treatment of MCF7 cells with increased concentrations of MH induced AMPK phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner that was accompanied by inhibition of phosphorylation of AKT and mTOR downstream effector protein S6. In addition, MH reduced phosphorylated STAT3 levels in vitro, which may correlate with MH and AMPK-mediated anti-inflammatory properties. Further, in vivo, MH administered alone significantly inhibited the growth of established MCF-7 tumors in nude mice by 84%, resulting in an observable reduction in tumor volume. Our findings highlight the need for further research into the use of natural compounds, such as MH, for antitumor efficacy and potential chemoprevention and investigation of molecular pathways underlying these actions.

Emerging evidence suggests a close relationship between cholesterol metabolism and gut microbiota. Recently, we demonstrated that the short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) propionate (PA) reduces serum cholesterol levels through an immunomodulatory mechanism. Here, we investigated the effects of oral PA supplementation on the human serum metabolome and analyzed changes in the serum metabolome in relation to the cholesterol-lowering properties of PA. (2) Methods: The serum metabolome of patients supplemented with either placebo or propionate orally for 8 weeks was assessed using a combination of flow injection analysis-tandem (FIA-MS/MS) as well as liquid chromatography (LC-MS/MS) and mass spectrometry using a targeted metabolomics kit (MxP®Quant 500 kit: BIOCRATES Life Sciences AG, Innsbruck, Austria). A total of 431 metabolites were employed for further investigation in this study. (3) Results: We observed a significant increase in distinct bile acids (GCDCA: fold change = 1.41, DCA: fold change = 1.39, GUDCA: fold change = 1.51) following PA supplementation over the study period, with the secondary bile acid DCA displaying a significant negative correlation with the serum cholesterol levels. (4) Conclusions: Oral supplementation with PA modulates the serum metabolome with a particular impact on the circulatory bile acid profile. Since cholesterol and bile acid metabolism are interconnected, the elevation of the secondary bile acid DCA may contribute to the cholesterol-lowering effect of PA.

This study examined the relationship between dietary selenium intake and T2D risk among middle-aged and older Chinese adults. Dietary selenium intake was assessed through three 24 h recalls, using data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey. To investigate the relationship and the potential dose–response pattern between selenium intake and the likelihood of developing T2D, we employed both the restricted cubic spline analysis and the Cox proportional hazards model as our analytical tools. A cohort of 5970 participants aged ≥ 50 years was followed for an average of 5.44 years. The results revealed a V-shaped correlation between selenium intake and T2D risk, with the lowest risk observed at approximately 45 µg/day. Below this level, the risk decreased with an increasing selenium intake, while the risk increased between 45 and 100 µg/day. No significant association was found beyond 100 µg/day. These findings suggest that both low and high selenium consumption may increase T2D risk, highlighting the importance of maintaining a balanced selenium intake for T2D prevention.

The pathogenesis is multifactorial and includes deposition of amyloid-β in the central nervous system, presence of intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles and a decreased amount of synapses. It remains uncertain what causes the progression of the disease. Nowadays, it is suggested that the brain is connected to the gastrointestinal tract, especially the enteric nervous system and gut microbiome. Studies have found a positive association between AD and gastrointestinal diseases such as periodontitis, Helicobacter pylori infection, inflammatory bowel disease and microbiome disorders. H. pylori and its metabolites can enter the CNS via the oropharyngeal olfactory pathway and may predispose to the onset and progression of AD. Periodontitis may cause systemic inflammation of low severity with high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neutrophils. Moreover, lipopolysaccharide from oral bacteria accompanies beta-amyloid in plaques that form in the brain. Increased intestinal permeability in IBS leads to neuronal inflammation from transference. Chronic inflammation may lead to beta-amyloid plaque formation in the intestinal tract that spreads to the brain via the vagus nerve. The microbiome plays an important role in many bodily functions, such as nutrient absorption and vitamin production, but it is also an important factor in the development of many diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease. Both the quantity and diversity of the microbiome change significantly in patients with AD and even in people in the preclinical stage of the disease, when symptoms are not yet present. The microbiome influences the functioning of the central nervous system through, among other things, the microbiota–gut–brain axis. Given the involvement of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of AD, antibiotic therapy, probiotics and prebiotics, and faecal transplantation are being considered as possible therapeutic options.

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the current status and influencing factors of dietary literacy in Chinese college undergraduates and explore whether a nutritional lecture could improve their dietary literacy. Methods: This study included two parts: a cross-sectional study (n = 1026) conducted by a dietary literacy questionnaire, and a randomized controlled trail (RCT) that enrolled 99 college undergraduates who were randomized to a control group or a nutritional lecture group. Data from the questionnaire and 72 h food records were obtained on day 0, day 3 and day 100 before and after intervention. Results: This cross-sectional study showed that the mean scores of dietary KAP were respectively 100.0 (33.3), 59.1 (13.6) and 71.7 (11.7), with an excellent rate of 36.6%, 1.9% and 3.4%. Female upper-grade undergraduates and those with medicine-related majors illustrated higher dietary knowledge scores (p < 0.001). Dietary attitude rather than dietary knowledge had a significant impact on dietary practice (p < 0.001). This finding was in line with the results in the RCT study. Compared with the control group, dietary knowledge was significantly improved in the nutritional lecture group on both day 3 (p = 0.002) and day 100 (p = 0.023) after intervention. However, dietary behavior was improved only on day 3 post nutritional lecture (p = 0.029) but decreased to the original level 100 days later (p < 0.001). Conclusions: This study discovered the unsatisfying status and discrepancy between dietary literacy among college undergraduates of different sex, majors and college years. Dietary attitude instead of dietary knowledge was discovered as a determining role in dietary practice. One nutritional lecture could improve undergraduates’ dietary literacy but the effect was not long-lasting. Further studies with more reinforced and durable interventions are warranted.

S-equol, a soy isoflavone-derived molecule, is known to reduce osteoporosis in estrogen-deficient mice, but its role in OA remains unknown. This study aimed to explore the effect of S-equol on different degrees of menopausal OA in female Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats induced by estrogen deficiency caused by bilateral ovariectomy (OVX) combined with intra-articular injection of mono-iodoacetate (MIA). Knee joint histopathological change; serum biomarkers of bone turnover, including N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP), C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-I) and N-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (NTX-I); the cartilage degradation biomarkers hyaluronic acid (HA) and N-terminal propeptide of type II procollagen (PIINP); and the matrix-degrading enzymes matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-1, MMP-3 and MMP-13, as well as the oxidative stress-inducing molecules nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), were assessed for evaluation of OA progression after S-equol supplementation for 8 weeks. The results showed that OVX without or with MIA injection induced various severity levels of menopausal OA by increasing pathological damage, oxidative stress, and cartilage matrix degradation to various degrees. Moreover, S-equol supplementation could significantly reduce these increased biomarkers in different severity levels of OA. This indicates that S-equol can lessen menopausal OA progression by reducing oxidative stress and the matrix-degrading enzymes involved in cartilage degradation.

GLUT1 and GLUT3, highly expressed isoforms in the blood–brain barrier and neuronal membranes, respectively, are associated with multiple neurodevelopmental disorders including epilepsy, dyslexia, ADHD, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Dietary therapies, such as the ketogenic diet, are widely accepted treatments for patients with the GLUT1 deficiency syndrome, while ameliorating certain symptoms associated with GLUT3 deficiency in animal models. A ketogenic diet, high-fat diet, and calorie/energy restriction during prenatal and postnatal stages can also alter the placental and brain GLUTs expression with long-term consequences on neurobehavior. This review focuses primarily on the role of diet/energy perturbations upon GLUT isoform-mediated emergence of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders.

Sons of women with low vitamin D during gestation were found to be characterized by increased activity of the reproductive axis and faster postnatal growth of genital organs. The current study assesses for the first time the course of minipuberty in female descendants of women with a vitamin D deficit. The study population included three matched groups of infant girls: children born to women with vitamin D deficiency (25OHD concentration below 50 nmol/L), offspring of women with vitamin D insufficiency (25OHD concentration between 50 and 75 nmol/L), and daughters of healthy females (25OHD concentration between 75 and 150 nmol/L). Salivary concentrations of estradiol, progesterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone and androgens, as well as urine concentrations of FSH and LH, were assayed during the first 18 months of life (once a month in the first 6 months, bimonthly between months 6 and 12, and then every three months). At each visit, beyond hormone measurements, the investigators assessed the size of reproductive organs: ovaries, uterus and breasts. In daughters of mothers with vitamin D deficiency, concentrations of FSH, LH and estradiol were higher and detectable for a longer period of time, while ovarian volume, uterine length and breast diameter were greater than in the remaining groups. Children born to women with vitamin D insufficiency were characterized by higher FSH levels than daughters of healthy females, though the detection period was the same, and both groups differed in breast diameter. These findings suggest that low vitamin D status during gestation leads to more pronounced and longer-lasting activation of the reproductive axis, and is associated with increased dimensions of sexual organs, the magnitude of which depends on the degree of vitamin D deficit.

This retrospective cohort study aimed to assess the dose-dependent association between skipping breakfast and smoking initiation in university students. This study included 17,493 male and 8880 female students aged 18−22 years at a national university in Japan. The association between breakfast frequency (eating every day and skipping occasionally, often, and usually) and smoking initiation was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for clinically relevant factors. Smoking initiation was observed in 2027 (11.6%) male and 197 (2.2%) female students over the median observational period of 3.0 and 3.1 years. Skipping breakfast was significantly associated with smoking initiation in a dose-dependent fashion in male students (the adjusted hazard ratios [95% confidence interval] of eating breakfast every day and skipping occasionally, often, and usually: 1.00 [reference], 1.30 [1.15, 1.46], 1.47 [1.21, 1.79], and 1.77 [1.40, 2.25], respectively). Female students skipping breakfast occasionally and often were more vulnerable to smoking initiation than those who ate breakfast every day (1.00 [reference], 1.86 [1.24, 2.78], 2.97 [1.66, 5.32], and 1.76 [0.55, 5.64], respectively). Breakfast frequency may be useful to identify university students at risk of smoking initiation who need improvement in their health literacy.

LF supplementation (currently bovine) supports the immune system and helps maintain iron homeostasis in adults. No recombinant human lactoferrin (rhLF) is available for commercial food use. To determine the extent to which rhLF (Effera™) produced by Komagataella phaffii digests similarly to hmLF, a validated in vitro digestion protocol was carried out. Bovine LF (bLF) was used as an additional control, as it is approved for use in various food categories. This study compared the extent of intact protein retention and the profile of peptides released in hmLF, bLF and rhLF (each with low and high iron saturation) across simulated adult gastric and intestinal digestion using gel electrophoresis, ELISA and LC-MS. Intact LF retention across digestion was similar across LF types, but the highest iron-saturated hmLF had greater retention in the simulated gastric fluid than all other sample types. Peptides identified in digested hmLF samples strongly correlated with digested rhLF samples (0.86 < r < 0.92 in the gastric phase and 0.63 < r < 0.70 in the intestinal phase), whereas digested bLF samples were significantly different. These findings support the potential for rhLF as a food ingredient for human consumption.

Bovine colostrum contains key components such as immunoglobulins, oligosaccharides, lactoferrin and lysozyme. It is a special supplement source due to its natural, high bioavailability and high concentrations of growth factors. Growth factors are critical to many physiological functions, and considering its presence in the colostrum, further research must be conducted on its safe application in many bodily disorders. Growth factors contribute to wound healing, muscle and bone development, and supporting growth in children. Additionally, the molecular mechanisms have been explored, highlighting the growth factors roles in cell proliferation, tissue regeneration, and the regulation of immune responses. These findings are crucial for understanding the potential health effects of bovine colostrum, ensuring its safe use, and forming a basis for future clinical applications. This review article examines the growth factors concentration in bovine colostrum, their benefits, clinical studies, and molecular mechanisms.

To compare low-fat and lower carbohydrate diets, we designed The Preventing Overweight by Novel Dietary Strategies (POUNDS) Lost study. This is a 2 × 2 factorial study with diets of 20% or 40% fat and 15% or 25% protein with a graded carbohydrate intake of 35, 45, 55 and 65%. Weight loss, overall, was modest at nearly 6% with all four diets, and no significant dietary difference. The variability in weight loss in each diet group was significant, ranging from greater than 20% to a small weight gain. Studies of genetic variations in relation to weight loss showed that the diet that was selected could significantly affect weight loss, emphasizing that there is no ideal diet and more than one diet can be used to treat obesity. Weight loss was also influenced by the level of baseline triiodothyronine or thyroxine, and baseline carbohydrate and insulin resistance. Achieving a stable Health Eating Food Diversity Index, eating more protein, eating more fiber, engaging in more physical activity, sleeping better and eating less ultra-processed foods were beneficial strategies for weight loss in this trial. Although there is no “ideal diet”, both the DASH diet and the Mediterranean diet have clinical trials showing their significant benefit for cardiovascular risk factors. Finally, the lesson of the “Last Chance Diet”, which recommended a diet with protein from gelatin, proved that some diets could be hazardous.

Exploring the molecular mechanisms and interactions involved in the vascular protective effects of PE is beneficial for the development of further strategies to protect aging blood vessels. For this review, the content was obtained from scientific databases such as PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Google Scholar up to July 2024, using the search terms “Plant extracts”, “oxidative stress”, “vascular aging”, “endothelial dysfunction”, “ROS”, and “inflammation”. This review highlighted the effects of PE in protecting aging blood vessels. Through pathways such as scavenging reactive oxygen species, activating antioxidant signaling pathways, enhancing respiratory chain complex activity, inhibiting mitochondrial-reactive oxygen species generation, improving nitric oxide bioavailability, downregulating the secretion of inflammatory factors, and activating sirtuins 1 and Nrf2 signaling pathways, it can improve vascular structural and functional changes caused by age-related oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation due to aging, thereby reducing the incidence of age-related cardiovascular diseases.
