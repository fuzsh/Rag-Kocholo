        "text": "The Institute of Public Goods and Policies (IPP) is one of the three institutes of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) in the area of social sciences. IPP research focuses on the comparative analysis and understanding of the nature of public goods, the design and implementation of public policies, and the interaction of both, seeking to contribute to the advancement of our knowledge about the relation between society, markets and the State. The IPP integrates six research groups: i) Environmental Economics; ii) Rural Geography; iii) Citizens, Institutions and Policy; iv) Social Policies and Welfare State; v) SPRI–Systems and Policies for Research and Innovation; and vi) Scientometrics. The IPP carries out and supports interdisciplinary research on topics falling within the remit of these six groups. In addition to basic research, IPP members carry through applied research and policy advice for different national and international organizations and bodies, including OCDE, the EP, the European Commission and the World Bank. IPP has 22 permanent staff members from the fields of political science, economics, sociology and science and technology.\n\nGisela Hernández graduated in International Relations at the Complutense University of Madrid and holds a Master in European Studies in San Pablo CEU University.
