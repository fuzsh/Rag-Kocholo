        "text": "Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has called a snap general election for 28 April, after Catalan nationalist MPs withdrew support for the Socialist government's budget.\n\nIt is just eight months since Mr Sánchez took office, heading a minority government reliant on Catalan support.\n\nOpinion polls suggest that no single party would win a clear majority. But conservatives and the far-right Vox party are expected to do well.\n\nThe Catalan crisis is still simmering.\n\nCatalan separatist MPs rejected Mr Sánchez's budget bill after the government refused to discuss the region's right to self-determination.\n\nDivisions were highlighted on Tuesday, when 12 Catalan separatist leaders and activists went on trial accused of rebellion and sedition over their unrecognised independence referendum in 2017.\n\nThe Socialists (PSOE) have 84 seats in the 350-seat lower house (Congress of Deputies), and their main allies, anti-austerity Podemos, have 67. But the biggest party is the conservative opposition Popular Party (PP), with 134.\n\nIn his announcement, Mr Sánchez complained that the right-wing parties - the PP and Ciudadanos - had blocked numerous bills in parliament, including important measures to reduce inequality.\n\nIs this snap election unusual for Spain?\n\nYes. Since the return of Spanish democracy, with the death of fascist dictator Francisco Franco in 1975, it is only the second time that a government's budget bill has been defeated in parliament.\n\nThe previous occasion was in 1995, when the Socialists under Felipe González were forced to call an election.\n\nTurbulence and shifting alliances\n\nBy the BBC's Guy Hedgecoe in Madrid\n\nWhile the end of Pedro Sánchez's tenure looked inevitable, following his parliamentary budget defeat, this adds further uncertainty to a fragmented Spanish political landscape.\n\nHis PSOE is leading many polls and could win this election, but might find it hard to form a majority and govern.\n\nThe leftist Podemos, the PSOE's natural ally, is riven by infighting and struggling in polls.\n\nWith the Catalonia issue likely to dominate the upcoming campaign, the hardline pro-unity stance of parties on the right - the PP and Ciudadanos - could see them benefit. If the numbers add up, they could try to form a majority, possibly with the support of far-right Vox, which has enjoyed a surge in polls, due mainly to its uncompromising policy on Catalan independence.\n\nEuropean Parliament snubs Catalan ex-leader\n\nAmid tensions over the trial of his associates, the exiled former Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont has seen an event he was due to address at the European Parliament cancelled on security grounds.\n\nSeveral Spanish politicians had objected to the presence of Mr Puigdemont, who has fled Spain where he is wanted for alleged crimes linked to Catalonia's failed bid for independence in 2017.\n\nHe had been invited by a group including a Flemish nationalist MEP to speak about the trial."
