The advent of democracy brought opportunities but also challenges for the war disabled of the Spanish Civil War. Though it would never be enough to compensate them for the suffering endured, those wounded while fighting on the Republican side in the conflict were able to gain recognition of their veteran status after decades of hardship. Meanwhile, the war disabled of the Francoist side experienced a parallel process of transition, which saw the privileged status they had enjoyed under the regime unpicked by the Socialist governments of Felipe González. This process was intrinsically linked both to Spain’s political transition, and the slightly later military transition which sought to ‘modernise’ the Spanish armed forces. This paper will consider the experiences of the Francoist war disabled during this moment of reckoning, and will reflect upon the long-term legacies of the dictatorship on former military personnel living with disabilities in the present day.\n\n16 November 2022 (16.00-17.30)\n\nPatricio Simonetto (UCL), A Body of One’s Own: Trans Embodiment Technologies and Knowledge Production in Argentina\n\nAbstract\n\nUnlike other countries where gender affirmation surgery access was restricted but still allowed under certain conditions, Argentina has prohibited any treatment that affected reproductive organs since 1967. Different legal codes have penalised people dressed as the “opposite sex” since the 1930s. This criminalisation has threatened trans people’s right to existence and made gender affirmation practices clandestine, expensive and dangerous. This presentation analyses how male and female trans people challenged state restrictions by producing knowledge and homemade technologies to affirm their gender. He explores the history of a vast repertoire of medical and social practices, such as self-injected hormones or liquid industrial silicone. The presentation also explores how people have experimented with their bodies, performing them in living laboratories to affirm their gender beyond legal and medical control, and how this pushed them to precarious conditions. Finally, it addresses how activists have formulated an alternative body discourse that challenges the biotechnological promise of an alleged “correct body” as an undeniable trans future.\n\n23 November 2022 (16.00-17.30)\n\nGeoff Goodwin (POLIS), Work in Progress seminar (CHIA members only)\n\nLand Reform and Water Politics in the Ecuadorian Andes: Spatial and Temporal Dimensions of Socioenvironmental Change\n\nLand reform went well beyond changing land use, tenure and distribution in Ecuador. Among other things, the reform, which took place between 1964 and 1994, set in motion a series of changes which transformed water relations and politics in the country. This was especially true in the Andes where the gradual dissolution of the traditional hacienda complex created more room for rural communities to organize around water. Managing drinking and irrigation water through a diverse range of collective relations and practices, the eclectic organisations that emerged through this historical process took greater control of water supplies and services at the local level and mobilized to transform laws and constitutions at the national level. This paper traces this process in the Ecuadorian Andes, analysing the interactions between land and water politics at multiple scales and reflecting on the spatial and temporal dimensions of socioenvironmental change.\n\n7 December 2022 (16.00-17.30)\n\nNick Sharman (Independent), Britain’s Informal Empire in Spain\n\nAbstract\n\nThe explosive growth of the British Empire in the nineteenth century saw much of the developing world falling under direct or indirect British economic and political control. Nick Sharman argues that Britain’s need for markets for its expanding industries and for control over its trade routes meant that Spain came within its informal imperial reach for over a century. From its military support for the Liberal Monarchy in the 1830s to the naval blockades of the Iberian Peninsula in the two World Wars, Britain intervened with force whenever diplomatic influence failed. Economically, Spain’s mineral supplies were essential for Britain’s engineering, chemical and munitions industries right up to the 1940s. Strategically, the defence of the Gibraltar naval base was fundamental to the security of its imperial trade routes in the Mediterranean and Atlantic. On the Spanish side, the effect of these pressures was to fuel the long and bitter conflict between protectionism and free trade, a chronic source of the country’s political instability. In the twentieth century, they were an important influence on the development of the Franco regime’s autarkic economic nationalism.\n\nInternational Workshop\n\nFriday 27 January 2023\n\nFamily and Marriage in Twentieth-Century Spain: Gender politics, subjectivities and memory\n\nRegistration\n\n9 March 2023\n\n17.00-18.30, Room 3.11 Michael Sadler Building\n\nRaanan Rein (Tel Aviv University), ‘Fighting for Social Justice on Both Sides of the Mediterranean: Jewish Female Volunteers from Palestine in the Spanish Civil War’, hosted by CHIA, the Instituto Cervantes and the School of History\n\nAbstract\n\nThe Spanish Civil War resonated across the world, including the Jewish Yishuv in Palestine. Despite widespread solidarity with the Spanish Republic, a near consensus existed among virtually all Zionist sectors against the enlistment of young volunteers to the International Brigades. Still, between 150 and 200 volunteers left Palestine for Spain, most of them members of the Palestine Communist Party (PCP). Fourteen of them were women.\n\nThis talk focuses on the life trajectories of several of these female volunteers in order to illustrate their motivations to join the International Brigades but also highlight international women’s participation in the Spanish war and its limits. Based on recently discovered documents, it seems that at the current stage of the historiography of international volunteers in the Spanish Civil War, it is mostly documents held in private hands, rather than the already researched public archives, that can help us shed a new light on the experiences of foreign participants in the Spanish fratricide.\n\nDr. Raanan Rein is the Elías Sourasky Professor of Latin American and Spanish History at Tel Aviv University. He is the author of numerous books, including The Franco-Perón Alliance: Relations between Spain and Argentina and In the Shadow of the Holocaust and the Inquisition: Israel's Relations with Francoist Spain; and co-editor of Spain 1936: Year Zero and Spain and the Mediterranean since 1898. In 2016 he was awarded the title of Comendador in Spain's Order of Civil Merit, granted by King Felipe VI.\n\n13 March 2023\n\n17.30, Grant Room, School of History\n\nBook presentation: James Yeoman, Print Culture and the Formation of the Anarchist Movement in Spain, 1890-1915 (AK Press, 2022)\n\nIn this session, we will hear from James Yeoman, the author of Print Culture and the Formation of the Anarchist Movement in Spain, who will be discussing his work with current School of History PhD student Josh Newmark.

In the event, Peter Anderson will share ideas in a conversation with the Hispanist and journalist from The Guardian Giles Tremlett and the editor of the Academic History section of Oxford University Press, Cathryn Steele.\n\nMedia revelations that during and shortly after the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939 the Franco regime removed tens of thousands of children from political opponents and placed them in care homes or with families loyal to the regime where they were educated to despise their parents’ beliefs sparked vigorous debate in Spain. To understand these ‘lost children of Francoism’, Peter Anderson’s new book examines the rise from the nineteenth century of ideas of the ‘dangerous parent’ and the growing power of the state to remove children. It explores the removal of children before and during the early Franco regime and asks who lost children, how, and why. The book also links removal practices in Spain to other countries such as Australia, Canada, and the United States, all of which face uncomfortable questions about their mass child-removal policies: Spanish practices help us understand these cases too.\n\nView more details about the event and book your ticket via Eventbrite.\n\nSemester 2\n\nWednesday 9 February 2022, 16.00-17.30 (online via Teams)\n\nDanielle Terrazas Williams (University of Leeds), will present some reflections on her forthcoming book The Capital of Free Women: Race, Legitimacy, and Liberty in Colonial Mexico in a Research in Progress seminar.\n\nWednesday 23 February 2022, 16.00-17.30 (online via Teams)\n\nEline Van Ommen (University of Leeds), Research in Progress seminar.\n\nWednesday 16 March 2022, 16.00-17.30 (online via Teams)\n\nAngel Smith (University of Leeds), Research in Progress seminar, \"Cultural Imperialism and the Orientalisation of Spain, 1800-1850\".\n\nWednesday 11 May 2022, 17.00-18.30 (online via Teams)\n\nDavid Brydan (King's College London), Annual Lecture, \"What can Franco's Spain teach us about the history of internationalism?\".\n\nProfessor Peter Anderson will chair our Annual Lecture.\n\n20 June 2022\n\nAnarchism in the Iberian Peninsula (a hybrid symposium at the University of Leeds organised by Joshua Newmark and Sophie Turbutt).\n\nFurther details of these events will be circulated in due course.
