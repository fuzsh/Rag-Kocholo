        "text": "Why did you decide to do a master in legaltech?\n\nAfter the LL.M., I realized that Latin American firms have a traditional way of thinking and doing things. Unfortunately, this is not just true of the legal sector, but throughout most industries.\n\nI began to look for a way to change the firmâs organization and interaction with its client base. I knew I had to rely on technology and out-of-the-box thinking, but I did not know where or how to begin.\n\nThe first step towards legaltech was my participation in one of the IE Venture Daysâpitching a document automation platformâand then as a speaker at a legal hackers conference hosted by TÃ©cnico de Monterrey in Mexico. This paved the way towards becoming a more tech-driven lawyer as opposed to a traditional corporate lawyer, ultimately driving me back to IE and the Master in Legal Tech.\n\nHow has the master helped you after you finished it?\n\nThe masterâs puts into perspective the different aspects of legaltech. Perhaps more importantly, it teaches how to differentiate between whatâs considered mere hype and whatâs actually game-changing. The fact is weâre still a few years, or even decades, away from a fully autonomous profession. But if we reach that reality, it will be one in which technology and humans work together in an unprecedented way. This masterâs prepares us for such a reality.\n\nThe program provided the skills needed to implement digital transformation within my law firm, adding value to the way we render our services. Furthermore, it led the way for the firm to become part of a full-service, tech-oriented, fast-growing international law firm.\n\nHow were the on-campus experiences in Madrid, Tel Aviv and Silicon Valley? Which was your favorite one? Why?\n\nI had a particular longing for Madrid, having lived there for a whole year. Going back for a few weeks made the experience even more enjoyable for me. That made it my favorite. Madrid was more academic, and being back in a classroom and having various tasks is quite thrilling and exhausting at the same time. It took me back to the most demanding days of my previous LL.M.! Madrid teaches those who are not accustomed to IE Law Schoolâs method the ability to cope with multiple tasks at the same time, which can be challenging but rewarding.\n\nSilicon Valley puts into perspective the reality of the tech worldâin my opinion, a mix of hype and state-of-the-art innovation. The visits to various key players and tech giants are mind-opening.\n\nThe classes and visits to Tel Aviv are very insightful. Israel, also known as the âStartup Nationâ, is a growing hub for legaltech. I would highlight the network opportunities, especially the one with Law Geex, a key player in the industry who have landed their contract review automation platform successfully in the United States.\n\nCould you tell us your experience of doing the challenges during the master?\n\nChallenges are the practical side of what is being taught. For example, there was one challenge in which they asked us to build a chatbot using IBM Watson. The online sessions leading up to the challenge were useful and insightful enough to build a decent chatbot. Every challenge allowed us to experiment with different types of technology firsthand.\n\nHow was the experience of doing a master with this format? Online and on campus?\n\nOnline sessions work flawlessly. There were, however, times when work got in the way of the online sessions, and I had to go back to the recorded session later.\n\nThe on-campus experience was fantastic. You get to be there in person with leading professionals in the legaltech world, as well as your classmates who are exceptional individuals and professionals with diverse backgrounds. This is where one gets the most out of the masterâs.\n\nHow was your experience at IE?\n\nExtraordinary! IEâs teaching methodology pursues and approaches both soft and hard skills. The connections made with your peers are strong, forming bonds of friendship and potential business partners. It makes the whole experience worthwhile and remarkable.\n\nWhat is the best thing you took away from your time at IE Law School?\n\nNetwork, knowledge and skills to cope with an ever-demanding profession that will sooner rather than later be disrupted. I believe that my career path has changed quite drastically, and the program left me on the right track to embracing an ever-changing landscape."
