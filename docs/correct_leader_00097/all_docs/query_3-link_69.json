        "text": "All stories start in a specific time and place; that’s how literature explains the complexity of the world. The crisis affects me directly; many of my Spanish friends are currently experiencing its full devastating force. They feel that the future is full of uncertainty and watch in astonishment as life in a normal European country becomes more out of joint by the day, swept along in the mad two-horse race between the centre-right People’s Party (PP) and centre-left Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party (PSOE), neither of which is capable of giving the slightest account of what went wrong in the past, what is going wrong today and — worst of all — what could go even more wrong in the future.\n\nThe role of a government is to create a narrative for a society, with all its contradictions and problems, but Spain does not have — and never has had — such a story. This is because, since the death of Franco and the start of the transition to democracy (1), Spain’s political class has established intellectual laziness as a defining feature. A viable model for running the country has never been devised. When you reread parliamentary statements or electoral campaign speeches, you look in vain for the slightest vision for Spanish society.\n\nThe only statesman who ever attempted such a narrative was Manuel Azaña, the last president of the republic before Franco’s coup d’état. There has never been another, because Spain’s great shortcoming stems from the absence of an enlightened middle class, which in turn is the result of a lack of statesmen."
