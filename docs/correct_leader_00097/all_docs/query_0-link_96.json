The programme's long-term guidelines and concrete proposals will feed into the deliberations of the group of \"wise men\" chaired by Felipe González.\n\nThe presentations by Mr González and Mr Sepi will be followed by a debate involving the EESC's group presidents, as well as Professor Stefan C. Collignon (Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies of Pisa, Italy), Maria Jepsen (European Trade Union Institute) and stakeholders.\n\nFelipe González, who led his country into the EU in 1986, has been put in charge of the \"Reflection Group horizon 2020-2030\" by EU leaders. The group's goal is to put forward proposals on the EU's long-term priorities; its final report will be ready by June 2010 at the latest."
