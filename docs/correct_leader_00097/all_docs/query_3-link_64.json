        "text": "ADOLFO SUÁREZ\n\nAdolfo Suárez was one of the key figures in the Spanish Transition. Born in 1932 in Cebreros (Ávila), he had a degree in law. He was civilian governor of Segovia, general director of RTVE and general secretary minister of The Movement (the only party there was during Franco’s regime) in the first government formed after the death of dictator Francisco Franco. Ever since he was invested president in 1976, until he resigned in 1981, he transformed Franco’s regime into a parliamentary democracy with several legal reforms. As leader of the Unión de Centro Democrático (UCD) he won the legislative elections in 1977 and 1979. During his tenure political parties were legalized, the constitution was approved and the so called Pactos de la Moncloa were reached.\n\nHis government was affected by a severe economic depression, the ETA terrorism and the ordination of the emerging autonomies’ state.\n\nFurthermore, he was a witness of the disintegration of UCD due to internal struggles among different tendencies, factors that caused his resign as president on January 29th 1981\n\nIn the time he was in Moncloa he overcame a couple motions of no confidence and faced two coup attempts, “Operación Galaxia” and the assault to the congress on February 23rd the same day he was going to transfer the position to Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo. After his exit of the government he founded a new party, the Centro Democrático y Social, but continuous elective failures made him retire from politics in 1991. Adolfo Suárez died on march 23rd 2014.\n\nCOUP RESPONSABLES\n\nALFONSO ARMADA Y COMYN (1920-2013)\n\nDivision General of the Ejército de Tierra, he was the man the conspirators had designed to become president. His part in the coup were known when he was dismissed and arrested, five days after the coup attempt. Sentenced 30 years of imprisonment and his military rank was taken away for the coup attempt he was reprieved due to his health issues on December 24th 1988 after six years of imprisonment.\n\nJAIME MILANS DEL BOSCH (1915-1997)\n\nGeneral Captain of the 3rd Military District, he was one of the main heads of the coup attempt when he imposed the state of exception in Valencia and deploying the tanks in the streets the night of the 23-F. In june of 1982, he was sentenced by the Supreme Council of Military Justice to thirty years and loss of his employment for military rebellion. Freed in July the 1st 1990, Milans del Bosch died on july 26th 1997 and was buried in the crypt of the Alcázar of Toledo, for he was a defender of the place during the Civil War.\n\nANTONIO TEJERO MOLINA\n\nBorn in 1932. lieutenant colonel of the Guardia Civil, he broke in the Congress of Deputies on February 23rd 1981 and leading a group of his men he kept the government and deputies kidnapped for 18 hours. Sentenced to 30 years of imprisonment for a crime of military rebellion, he was the last of the accused to leave prison where he remained for fifteen years and nine months, most of it in the castle of Figueras (Gerona), where he was the only intern. He is currently retired.\n\nTHE CONGRESS OF DEPUTIES AFTER THE GENERAL ELECTIONS OF MARCH 1979\n\nGeneral elections celebrated in Spain on march 1st 1979 were won by president Adolfo Suárez and his party, the Unión de Centro Democrático (UCD) who obtained 168 representatives. The next political party with parliamentary representatives was the Partido Socialista Obrero Español (PSOE), led by Felipe González, who received 121 representatives. The results were almost the same than two years before. Regardless of that, Adolfo Suárez and UCD were not able of keeping a stable government. The damage to the government of president Adolfo Suárez was caused by the multiple terrorist attacks of the secessionist Basque organization ETA, the end of the consensus among the parties with the beginning of hard opposition by the PSOE and the rise of the nationalists to the Basque and Catalonian governments, the conspiracies of the far right wing military circles, and ultimately the internal disintegration of the governing UCD.\n\nIn the image the deputies stand from their seats and look at the door where lieutenant colonel of the Guardia Civil Antonio Tejero, gun in hand, has just broken in the Hemicycle during the second voting to invest Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo as president.\n\nGUARDIA CIVIL\n\nThe Spanish Guardia Civil, popularly known as Benemérita, is a military security corps that is part of the Fuerzas y Cuerpos de Seguridad del Estado.\n\nOlive green mulch and a black tricorne are symbols of this armed institution created in 1944 that has more than 80.000 men. Their functions include border watching and road monitoring as well as the fight against drug trafficking and terrorism, or nature protection among others. They have a double dependency, on one hand to the Ministerio de Interior when it comes to retributions, postings, means and services and by the other hand to the Ministerio of Defensa, when it comes to promotions and military missions. Most of the 30 military processed for the coup attempt were from this corps.\n\nMANUEL GUTIERREZ MELLADO (1912-1995)\n\nSpanish military and politician, he was vice-president and lieutenant general of the army on February 23rd 1981. He faced lieutenant colonel Antonio Tejero who shook him, while several machine gun burst hit the dome of the hemicycle. President Adolfo Suárez went in his rescue. Promoted to honorific captain general, he was one of the key figures in the Spanish transition to democracy, which he led a major role in it ever since September 1976 when he was named vice-president for Defence affairs. He died in a traffic accident on December the 15th 1995 when he was 83 years old.\n\nSANTIAGO CARRILLO SOLARES (1915-2012)\n\nHistorical leader of the Partido Comunista de España (PCE) he was a key figure of the opposition to Franco’s regime and of the transition in Spain.

After Franco’s victory in 1939 he left Spain and in 1960 he was designated general secretary of the communist.\n\nAfter a 38 years exile, he returned to Spain after general Franco’s death and took part in the democratization of the country. With the legalization of the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) he was elected deputy in 1977. He was one of the three politicians, with Adolfo Suárez and Manuel Gutiérrez Mellado, who remained in his seat when colonel Tejero assaulted the Congress on February the 23rd 1981.

Agencia EFE spread immediately among their subscribers exclusively the photographs made by photographers Manuel Pérez Barriopedro and Manuel Hernandez de León of lieutenant colonel Tejero inside the Hemicycle.\n\nTANKS IN THE STREETS OF VALENCIA\n\nShortly after lieutenant colonel Antonio Tejero, leading a group of civil guards, took the Congress of Deputies on February 23rd 1981, general captain of the 3rd military district, that encompassed Valencia, Murcia and Cuenca, Jaime Milans del Bosch, ordered the exception state in all the area under his command and deployed the Motor Division “Maestrazgo” with 1.800 men, dozens of tanks and vehicles in the streets of Valencia, Military forces spread from the docks to downtown so that night the city was occupied by military with armored and other vehicles from the nearby bases of Bétera and Paterna.
