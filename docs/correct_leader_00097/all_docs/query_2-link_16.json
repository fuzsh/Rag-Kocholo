        "text": "History\n\nSpain’s oldest political party, the PSOE was founded in 1879 by Pablo Iglesias, a Madrid typesetter and union organizer. Iglesias was also the founder in 1888 of the party’s affiliated trade union confederation, the General Union of Workers (Unión General de Trabajadores; UGT). The party grew slowly at first, partly because the UGT had to compete with the anarchist trade union confederation in organizing the working class. It was also hampered by its rigid Marxist ideology, its fierce anticlericalism, the small size of the Spanish working class, and the political strength of other left-wing competitors. The PSOE elected its first parliamentarian in 1910, but the party was further weakened by a split in 1921 that produced the Communist Party of Spain. By the time the Spanish Republic was proclaimed in 1931, however, the PSOE had become the country’s largest political party, despite schisms between reformist social democrats and revolutionary socialists. The PSOE participated in coalition governments during the years 1931–36 and was among the principal supporters of the Republic during the Spanish Civil War (1936–39), with the head of the UGT, Francisco Largo Caballero, serving as prime minister of Republican Spain during 1936–37. The PSOE was banned following the victory of the Francisco Franco-led Nationalist forces and the fall of the Republic in 1938.\n\nThe PSOE lacked the organization and unity to survive during most of Franco’s long dictatorship (1936–75), during which the party had little presence inside Spain. In the mid-1950s a new generation of post-Civil War Spaniards revived the party, and in 1974 the young Sevillian Felipe González and his supporters managed to wrest control from the older generation of leaders who were still bickering in exile. Subsequently the charismatic González was able to rapidly increase the party’s membership.\n\nThe PSOE was legalized in 1977, and in that year’s elections—the first held since the return of democracy—the party captured nearly 30 percent of the vote, establishing it as the second largest party in Spain and the official opposition. As a result, the PSOE played a crucial role in drafting Spain’s new democratic constitution in 1978 and in campaigning for its ratification by the electorate.\n\nConvinced that the PSOE’s radical socialist platform had contributed to its failure to win the elections of 1977 and 1979, González favoured major ideological and organizational changes. After delegates to the national party conference refused to endorse his change of course in May 1979, González resigned as party leader only to regain control of the party at an emergency party congress in September. Later he secured overwhelming approval for his policy and structural changes, which weakened extremist elements and purged much of the Marxist verbiage from the party’s platform.\n\nWith a centrist platform and a unified and unchallenged leadership, the PSOE swept the 1982 elections, winning a large majority in the Cortes (Spanish legislature) and becoming the first single party to win a governing majority. As prime minister, González led the PSOE to victory in the next three elections. The PSOE enacted numerous reforms during its tenure in power from 1982 to 1996. It professionalized and tamed the armed forces and made important contributions to the consolidation of Spanish democracy. It negotiated Spain’s entry into the European Economic Community (later succeeded by the European Union) and, despite the party’s traditional rejection of participation, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization military alliance. The PSOE also restructured the country’s economy to make it more competitive, consolidated the process of regional devolution, reduced the influence of the Roman Catholic Church in education, and implemented a wide range of social reforms."
