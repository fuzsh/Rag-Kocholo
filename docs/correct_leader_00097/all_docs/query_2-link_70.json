After graduating, he spent two years working at the Department of Economics as a Research Associate and Lecturer. In the Fall of 2012, Felipe started his Ph.D in Economics at UC Berkeley. His fields of examination were Development and Labor Economics. During his time at Berkeley, Felipe has worked as a research and teaching assistant for Professors Edward Miguel and Solomon Hsiang.\n\nResearch: Felipe is a Ph.D. student in Economics at UC Berkeley. His research focuses on the historical and political factors that undermine development. In particular, he studies the consequences associated with the existence of links between the political and the private world. Methodologically, his research has led to collections of novel data from historical records, utilization of large climate and administrative datasets, and the implementation of spatial and network analysis.\n\nFields of interest: Development Economics, Political Economy, Economic History, Labor Economics\n\nPersonal page here"
