        "text": "Question for written answer E-002842/2023\n\nto the Commission\n\nRule 138\n\nDiana Riba i Giner (Verts/ALE)\n\nThe former Spanish Prime Minister, Felipe González, called on the current Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, not to give in to the ‘blackmail’ of ‘minorities in the process of extinction’[1], in reference to the current negotiations between the Catalan pro-independence parties and the Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party. Such statements – while more telling of the speaker’s inclination than of reality – undoubtedly incite hatred towards the Catalan community and towards legitimate and democratic political beliefs and opinions that currently hold a parliamentary majority in Catalonia.\n\nI would therefore like to ask:\n\n1.Does the Commission believe that such statements are at odds with Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union?\n\n2.In view of the possible future extension of Article 83 TFEU to include hate speech and hate crime, does the Commission consider that expressions of this kind should be criminalised at European level?\n\nSubmitted: 27.9.2023"
