        "text": "Bakery Biz, July-August, 2021\n\nFor the financial year ended March 31, 2021, Britannia Industries’ consolidated sales were at Rs 12,883.04 crore, up 12.6 per cent\n\nBritannia Industries has reported that the pandemic has brought about a significant shift in consumer preference including the growth of online business channels, which are likely to strengthen and present new opportunities for the food business in the future. The company sees opportunities for growth through the launch of innovative products at different price points and expansion in rural markets.\n\nAccording to Britannia, it foresees opportunities to scale up its dairy business by leveraging product innovation and accelerating the growth of value-added products into the segment. The company is going for expansion of distribution for the dairy portfolio, growth of e-commerce and digital subscription platforms and culinary experimentation at home with categories like cheese due to the lockdown.\n\nIn the cake segment, quoted Britannia’s annual report, “immediate strategic priorities are to strengthen and scale up innovation, renovate and make the base cake segment more premium and in new-to-market formats with affordable prices. These measures are intended to attain segment leadership by understanding consumer preferences and meeting their expectations.” While talking about bread, Britannia said it has continued to grow and strengthen its leadership in the Health Segment with superior and differentiated products like ‘atta’ pizza, multigrain and cheese garlic bread, etc.\n\nThe category is evolving rapidly due to the entry of new players and market consolidation, it added. “With the entry of significant competitors and signs of consolidation in this space, your company has renewed its focus on further diversification of portfolio, strengthening manufacturing capability, expansion into new markets and e-commerce as well as Brand building through the launch of refreshed packaging and relevant products,” the report quoted.\n\nWhile talking about the biscuit segment, Britannia said India continues to provide significant opportunities for growth as the per capita consumption is much lower than that of developed countries.\n\n“High levels of household penetration (above 90 per cent) augurs well for an increase in consumption. There is potential to spur consumption growth through innovative, healthy and premium products,” the annual report quoted. For the financial year ended March 31, 2021, Britannia Industries’ consolidated sales were at Rs 12,883.04 crore, up 12.6 per cent as against Rs 11,443.99 crore in the previous year.\n\nIn the international business, Britannia’s strategy is to achieve growth and market share by increasing its presence among the Indian diaspora, develop new products to recruit local ethnic clusters and establish local operations in fast-growing emerging markets like contract manufacturing, acquisitions, joint ventures, etc. “The Export markets in Americas, Asia and Africa that were developed in previous years shows promising growth potential and the company is focused on mainstream channel expansion and opening more white space markets, in these geographies,” quoted the report.\n\nBRITANIA LAUNCHES MY STARTUP SEASON 3.0\n\nBritannia Marie Gold’s My Startup campaign version 3 is now broadened to help homemakers leverage the Internet to grow their businesses. This follows a survey by Britannia and Momspresso which indicated that 77 per cent of homemakers who desire to set up their own ventures, consider technology as an enabler. The last day for online submissions is November 05.\n\nQuoting the highlights of the Indian Homemakers’ Entrepreneurship Report 2021, Britannia too stated that 62 per cent of homemakers have dreams and aspirations to start a business of their own. The primary drivers for these homemakers who aspire to set up their own business desire to be financially independent which is 60 per cent and the ability to contribute financially to the family which is 53 per cent.\n\nTo support these aspirations, participants will be able to access a set of digital skilling resources from Google. These digital resources are available in six languages – Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Bengali and English, according to Britannia.\n\nBritannia’s move to become ‘total foods company’ is garnering momentum as it is eying new categories such as breakfast.\n\nBiscuit maker Britannia Industries Ltd is planning to launch croissant in packets during the second half of this year, said Gunjan Shah, vice president (sales) of the Kolkata-headquartered company.\n\nCroissant—a French crescent-shaped roll made of sweet yeast dough that is usually consumed as a breakfast item worldwide— will mark Britannia’s formal entry into the breakfast market that the company has been eyeing for a long time. Britannia also sells cakes, breads, rusks and a few value-added dairy products. In India, croissants are mainly sold at restaurants and bakeries.\n\n“Last year, we formed a joint venture with Greek company Chipita SA for producing and selling croissants. A factory is being set up currently,” Shah said.\n\nThe joint venture entity—Britchip Foods Ltd may also look at launching a few other products, according to Britannia’s fillings with BSE . Britannia holds 60 per cent in Britchip Foods while Chipita has the remaining equity. After the 10-year lock-in, Britannia will have the right of first refusal if Chipita intends to sell its stake.\n\nBritannia, which has been working on turning itself into a ‘total foods company’, is also eyeing new categories, Shah said. Earlier this month, Britannia managing director Varun Berry had said that the company aimed to launch about 50 new products by March 2020 as part of its plans to expand presence in bakery, non-bakery and microsnacking categories, a news agency reported.\n\n“The focus on valueadded dairy will continue,” Shah said. India’s dairy market has always been a difficult space for most companies, including the multinationals. Last month, Danone SA of France formally shut down its dairy business in India after three failed attempts to penetrate the market, a business newspaper reported.\n\nFor rural markets, Britannia is taking a hub-and spoke model where 8,000 distributors are being appointed to service villages with more than 5,000 population\n\nBritannia is fast catching up with rival Parle in terms of distribution reach in a bid to outsmart the biggest bakery product player in the volume play.\n\n“We are available in 4.5 million outlets out of 7.6 million outlets which has helped us to narrow the gap with the company which is available most, our biggest competitor. The gap is now down to 1.2 million, against 1.6 million about six years back,” Britannia managing director Varun Berry has claimed before analyst without naming its bigger rival. Efforts by dna to get response from privately held Parle for comments on the statement made by the Britannia MD didn’t fructify.\n\nChauhan family owned Parle which claims to be India’s largest manufacturer of biscuits and confectionary, and Britannia, controlled by the Wadias, have been locked in a fight for supremacy over the bakery and the biscuit industry.\n\nWhile Britannia, with a market share of 28 per cent in value terms in April 2015, edged past Parle, having a share a tad lower at 27.5 per cent, thanks to a premiumisation strategy, Parle still commands a much bigger share in volume terms through greater reach.\n\nBakery and biscuits reaches out to 7.6 million outlets. Out of this Britannia was getting to just about 10 per cent directly till about three years back.\n\n“We have almost doubled this and we are now getting to 1.3 million outlets directly, which gives us the ability to execute merchandising and displays through our sales force,” he said.\n\n“The management remains focussed to grow brands and expand its distribution channels,” KR Choksey said in a research note.\n\nIn fact, improvement in distribution is seen by Britannia as the single biggest factor behind a constant double-digit volume growth in all the four quarters of fiscal 2016 against just 2 per cent in fiscal 2014. While more villages are being penetrated helping the company achieve 30 per cent growth in rural markets, Britannia still remains weak in the Hindi heartland.\n\n“We still have some way to grow and would now start focusing on smaller villages. We were weak in hindi speaking states but have made good progress, where in Gujarat we have grown 26 per cent. In UP we have grown at 9 per cent and this market would be our focus this year,” Berry said.\n\nFor rural markets, Britannia is taking a hub-and-spoke model whereby 8,000 distributors are being appointed to service villages which are more than 5,000 population.\n\nCost pressure is building up on Britannia, which might raise its product prices by about 5 per cent.\n\n“Material prices have started to trend upwards with all four commodities forming bulk of our consumption like flour, sugar, RPO (refined palm oil)and crude oil that goes into energy for baking. They are going into a stage where it needs some pricing action. About 5 per cent inflation is what we expect and we need to take pricing action to get numbers which will help us to mitigate that inflation,” Berry said.\n\nIs in contrast to the fourth quarter when Britannia reduced prices on the back of soft commodity prices. “Since volume grew by 10 per cent (in Q4FY16) while revenue grew by 8 per cent, we had passed on some of the benign change in commodity prices to consumers,” he said."
