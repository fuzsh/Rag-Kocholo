        "text": "Good evening, everybody. Really sorry for this. I think we got delayed because of some technical reasons. These are very, very tough times, and we are dispersed all across in different locations. So it's just been very difficult for the central team to coordinate this. So extremely sorry for starting late. Having said that, let's get to Page 3. So if you were to look at the full year results, we've grown revenue by 13%. We've grown profits by 39%, with an overall profit percentage of 17.9%, and we've grown market share for the eighth year and running. We continue to focus on the 5 strategic plans that we talk about: distribution, marketing, innovation, the cost focus that we have on our P&L, adjacent businesses and sustainability. I'll take you through these in that order. So first of all, our planks continue to do quite well. So if you notice that rural distribution, which was down March of 2020, has again come back from 21,300 in February 2020 to 23,500 in March 2021. Similarly, our direct fees, which had dropped from 21 lakhs outlets to almost 15 lakhs is back to now 23.7 lakhs outlets. Our focus state agenda continues with our focus states growing 25% more than the rest of the country and e-com business continues to grow very, very aggressively, which is very important in times like this. Next slide is on our marketing campaigns. Some of you must have seen the new Jim Jam campaign that we've launched. It's doing quite well. We've also got Milk Bikis Tamil Nadu campaign, which is, again, doing quite well for us. I'll come to the rest of India Milk Bikis in a bit. We advertised Marie Gold, we've advertised 50-50 and we've also done a new campaign on NutriChoice Digestive. We've done a number of brand activations as well. We've done a Bourbon, Pure Magic Deuce. We've done a Little Hearts, NutriChoice, which was an e-commerce activation, and then NutriChoice cream cracker in West Bengal and Assam and we did a Tiger Crunch with Sonu Sood.Now coming to the Milk Bikis agenda as far as rest of India is concerned. So Milk Bikis has become a very, very important brand for us across the country. Still about a couple of years back, it was a large brand, but it was a regional brand. We were predominantly a Tamil Nadu and a Kerala-based brand with a little bit of presence in other states, but now we've decided to take this aggressively across the country. We've launched a 100% Atta product, and the proposition is Doodh Roti ki Shakti. The point really is that this needs to be a product which takes on from not just milk but also take some from glucose because from a product standpoint, it's a much better product than any of the glucose products which are available in the market. While we have a 26% share in the Milk category, which is INR 105 crores a month or INR 1,260 crores per annum, but we only got a 4% share of milk plus glucose put together and that's where the potential lies. So we are looking at making this a large brand in the Hindi belt and in the other states out of the south agenda that we have currently. We've got a very credible endorser for this in Pankaj Tripathi. I don't know if you've seen this advertising, but it's a very hard hitting ad. And you will -- if you haven't seen it, you'll see a lot more of it as we go forward. We've done a very large visibility drive on this. We've got 14 lakh square feet of visibility across, with 45,000 units to be deployed all across the country. So we are looking at this becoming a very large agenda for us as we go forward. We've got a very solid brand, and we think that we can make a big difference with this. The other campaigns that we did on adjacent bakery and dairy, the Rusk campaign is doing extremely well, and that's showing up even in the resurgence that Rusk is seeing as of now. Wafer, we launched INR 10 campaign, which is doing quite well. And WINKIN’ COW, which is on-the-go product, but has seen some very, very good results in Q4, is the highest growth from a volume standpoint as well as from a distribution standpoint that we've seen in the WINKIN’ COW brand. Next page is Page #9, where we talk about the efficiency. So we continue to sustain the COVID efficiency. So if you look at factory productivity, pre-COVID to post COVID, which is current productivity, we are 8% better. Wastages, we are 20% better than what our pre-COVID levels were. So our wastage is down 20%. Our dispatches from factory directly to distributors are up 50%, which saves us a transshipment and hence, brings the efficiencies to the system. Our depot space, we reduced by 10%, and we are managing very, very well and that's because we've got direct dispatches, so we can afford to save some depot space. We've created a very large digital platform for the future. So we went live with S/4 HANA, our dealer management platform, as well as our vendor management platform. So S/4 HANA basically is going to give us huge efficiencies in material resource planning. We've also got WMS working, which will give us efficiencies from our warehouse management costs as well as from a profitability analysis standpoint, S/4 HANA gives a lot of runway to what we can do with data. The plant maintenance system as well as the project management system, all this will be provided through S/4 HANA, which is absolutely cutting edge ERP. Arteria is the dealer management system that we have, which is going to give us real-time data. It's also going to -- be an integrated system from a scheme management or discount management standpoint. It's also going to be very efficient from claims settlements with distributors and the pricing and promotion controls that we want really strong within the system. So I think it's a state-of-the-art system, which is giving us very good results as we speak in this month. From a vendor management system, again, we want to get more efficiencies. We want the right sourcing, we want digital contracts, we want a catalog buying kind of approach to whatever we buy and, finally, life a cycle management, which the vendor management system is going to provide, which will help us cater to the 500-plus vendors that we have in the system. The next is about the ESG agenda. The journey began 7 or 8 years ago but now we are doing it in a very, very structured way. So if you look at the chart on Page 11, the resources part is what the environment that we are catering to. So we're talking about resource efficiencies, which is water, fuel, energy and bringing in more renewable energy. Food waste, we are looking at reducing defectives, making more -- making up-lines more efficient, not having expired products and reducing factory wastage as well. From a supply chain perspective, our farmer extension programs, sustainable sourcing and from a packaging standpoint, making sure that we reduce plastic and whatever plastic we are putting in the environment, we recycle that, so that we are effectively 0 as far as plastic is concerned. .From a social agenda, it's about the human resources and social responsibility. So there, from a health, safety and well-being of our people as well as people connected with us, employee engagement, diversity and inclusion. I must say that there is a lot more work to be done from a diversity standpoint, but we are working on it very, very actively and then community nutrition work that we do through the Britannia Nutrition Foundation, et cetera, that's going quite well. We also want to make sure that from an economic standpoint, we add a wing to this ESG agenda so that's the total foods company, the global total foods company that we want to be. And finally, from a governance standpoint, we would like to make sure that we are best in the business. So a very nice framework has been created, and this will be integrated into our companies and managers' performance as well and we will publish our first sustainability report in June of 2021. The next slide is on the Britannia Nutrition Foundation. There's a lot of work happening in various states, including Bihar, MP, Uttarakhand, Gujarat and Karnataka, which covers 75,000 direct beneficiaries of this foundation. We are very proud of it, and we want to make sure that in trying times like this, we accelerate this and provide the facilities to many more people. The next one is on -- our being awarded amongst India's best employers second year in a row. We're very proud of that. This is something that we've aspired for. We did it last year, but we replicated the same this year as well. We want to make sure that we continue with this. The next slide, Ritesh, are you there?\n\nSure, Varun. So our employee engagement and employee support agenda is covered under Britannia care philosophy. So we have looked at following initiatives during the year. As the year started, there was a lot of confusion anxiety, and we launched a continuous feedback system, which is a AI track bot, which covered about 2,000-plus of our employees and the key concern that was talked about was physical and mental stress that our employees are going through as well as there was a lot of fear and anxiety in their mind. And it was important to provide them the holistic wellness as well as a sense of belonging and community so that their fear and anxiety can subside and they also get support, especially on the mental stress side. So we looked at a holistic wellness program, which was looking at all the 4 aspects of wellness, which is physical, emotional, social and financial. For physical, we started with providing medical support, Medical Concierge Desk were created. The doctors were made available 24/7. There was also nutritionist provided as well as physical activities were limited. So we started with the digital physical fitness Friday. We provided employees on how to remain fit even when they were in the lockdown. Most importantly, I think what employees were looking at this point of time was the emotional, the mental stress that they were going through, the anxiety that they were going through. So we started Pan India Counselling services, and we also launched 2 training programs around emotional resilience, where we also involved ex-Army guys to talk about how they dealt with similar tough situations and how they were resilient in those situations, which was quite inspiring for the employees. And we also appointed expert connect doctor calls, doctors talking about what to expect and also dispelling some of the myths that they might have, which helped calm down their nerves. We do run a volunteering program, which Varun talked about as part of the inner segment and we continued that even in this year, combining it with virtual as well as a lot of distribution that was required for the migrant labor during the year. So we organized programs like health challenge to address malnutrition. We participated in that as part of a global program that was being run. We also took employee contribution drive, where we tried making small stuff for -- in partnership with NGOs. But most importantly, we made sure to provide biscuits and hot meals. So we cooked hot meals around our factories and provided in the [ killa ] location if it was possible and it was a to the authorities and health migrant labor with the hot meals as well as we supplied food and the [ kits ]. So that's what we did at around holistic wellness, taking care of complete wellness. For building sense of belonging in community, we had digital connects that were organized. There were town halls with leaders. Interventions were not limited just to the employees, but this situation also provided us to connect with the family members. We also focused on children because lot of children were looking at being engaged and parents wanted support on that. So we were able to organize some of those programs as well. So those are some of the initiatives which were taken to bring in the sense of community and belonging. The other actions, which were taken were we had, by and large, in our offices, continued on work-from-home mode, with some flexibility. So our offices were open for some time and whichever function our people needed to work, they could come in at their convenience. We also created cross-functional self-help group at each of the regions, which could help employees in tough times like we are going through currently and where these groups are actually helping employees with whether it is birth, whether it is medicine, whether it is oxygen and, obviously, providing comfort that, yes, there are set of individuals on behalf of company who are working at this point of time to support them. The leaves that people could utilize last year were carried forward, and we also created a BCP plan in our Bangalore office by getting alternate offices. We were more focused on offices for specific functions, manufacturing and sales, where we have the largest of our workforce. We made sure that a proper COVID protocol was developed and BCP was developed, so that we take utmost care on hygiene standards to ensure that our employees are not infected by COVID. So our proper health screening was done, touch-free attendance was launched, COVID sanitization were held with the employees, temperature monitoring was introduced. The transport was provided with 1/3 occupancy and a proper quarantine policy was done. And in a case where if any of our employee was infected with COVID, the proper tracing of primary contacts and making all of them isolation and in quarantine for 14 days work is strictly follow. Even on travel, we followed all the state regulations, which were there. Similarly for sales, we have done similar things wherever possible, which is managing even work from home whenever there has been Even today, we have taken the decision to work from home even in sales because of the surge that we see currently and we are doing -- we had done it last year also. We have done this year also. We have extended insurance to our third-party employees are going up to, to ensure that if they need any of the insurance help, we are there to provide them with that support. As of now, as we move forward and we are all facing the wave 2 currently, we are pushing for vaccination of all our employees, and we have managed to cover 76% to 80% of our eligible employees, which is 45 plus and we are getting up to ensure vaccination for employees below 45 years of age starting from 1st May. Company, obviously, is going to cover for cost of vaccinations for all employees as well as third-party employees, again, going up to the distributor sales plan. And yes, we are trying to target to cover all our employees to vaccinations in May. So these are testing times and things are changing every day, and we are quickly able to modify our responses to meet with the challenges. Back to you, Varun.\n\nYes. No, these are very, very tough times, guys. And it's been very, very tough, I think, not just for us, but for most businesses but we are trying to cope with this in the best way possible and keep our employees save from conditions that exist. Okay. Moving on to Page 16, which gives the revenues. So revenue growth for the quarter has been 8%, and it's trailed off from what it was in the first 3 quarters but it's -- the volume growth is at 8% as well. So the time has come to us to look at how we're going to take this back to a double-digit growth as far as volumes are concerned and revenues are concerned. Now moving on to the next slide, which is about cost efficiency programs. Last year, we had a big incentive coming our way because there was -- between the VAT and GST, there was some confusion. So there were some extra incentives that we got for '19/'20, so we had a onetime gain but for the last 3, 4 years, we are at about 4.6, 4.7 what we used to do in '13, '14. So that's what we've done. So we are on plan as far as cost efficiency programs are. Commodities, it's been fairly stable as far as flour and sugar is concerned. We've seen a huge inflation as far as edible oil is concerned. And on milk, while versus last year, same quarter, it's not an inflationary trend, but versus the last 3 quarters, it's inflationary on milk. So -- which takes us to the final slide on profitability. So we've got a profitability of 17.9% for the full year. For Q4, it's 14.9%, which is -- and I'm talking about the operating profit -- consolidated operating profit, which is better than last year, but it's below what we had for the first 3 quarters of this year. The reason for that, one is the inflation. From Q3 to Q4, there is approximately INR 100 crore inflation. Second is the normalization of our advertising and sales promotion budgets. We had some savings as far as that was concerned because we didn't have enough stock in the first half of the year. Now the inflation is leading us to a situation, where we would have about 3% inflation -- material inflation, which is basically coming from edible oil, dairy packaging material and as well as the price increases which have happened in fuel, which is diesel. So there's a 3% inflation that we are seeing, and that's something that we have to mitigate as we go forward. That's all for me, but just one more thing. The fact is that with a 17.9% profit margin, we keep doing a benchmarking versus other food companies in India and worldwide and it seems that we are in the above 90th percentile of profitability. We are amongst the most profitable food companies. And the interesting thing is that we are the most -- we are amongst the most profitable food companies in the world by operating in categories predominantly, which is low gross margin category compared to any other food category. So I think it's something to be really proud of and I think this team has done a fantastic job in taking us to this level. So that's it from me. Happy to answer any questions that you may have."
