The company has been unable to come up with new biscuit brands for past few years and hence this has been made the top priority of the company now. Mr. Varun Berry said in an interview that Britannia will launch new products and packaging across its portfolio but the cutting edge and disruptive aspects would be on the premium side.\n\nBritannia launched #BonTheOriginal campaign for marking the 60th year of Britannia Bourbon biscuits. #BonTheOriginal went online with a website inviting fans to be a part of bon 6 – the unboxing of #BonTheOriginal on 6th February 2015.
