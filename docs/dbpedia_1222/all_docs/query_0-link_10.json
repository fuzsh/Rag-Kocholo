Ltd.\n\nMilo Australia & New Zealand\n\nComplan and Cadbury Bournvita\n\nIts top Dairy competitors are:\n\nNestlé India\n\nThe National Dairy Development Board\n\nAmul\n\nBritannia - Challenges Faced\n\nA businessman from Kerala, Rajan Pillai secured control of the group in the late 1980s, becoming known in India as the 'Biscuit Raja'. In 1993, the Wadia Group acquired a stake in Associated Biscuits International (ABIL), and became an equal partner with Groupe Danone in Britannia Industries Limited. It was referred to as India's most dramatic corporate sagas, Pillai ceded control to Wadia and Danone after a bitter boardroom struggle, then fled his Singapore base to India in 1995 after accusations of defrauding Britannia, and died the same year in Tihar Jail.\n\nBiscuit major Britannia Industries, the star amongst the Indian FMCG pack of late, says generating consumer demand remains the biggest challenge in the new year. FMCG companies in general reported lacklustre results in recent quarters. But the biscuit maker's numbers beat expectations, with the Bengaluru-based company's profit margins at a record high in the last two quarters.\n\nIn a separate dispute from the shareholder matters, the company alleged in 2006 that Danone had violated its intellectual property rights in the Tiger brand by registering and using Tiger in several countries (in Indonesia in 1998, and later in Malaysia, Singapore, Pakistan and Egypt) without its consent. Whilst it was initially reported in December 2006 that agreement had been reached, it was reported in September 2007 that a solution remained elusive. In the meantime since Danone's biscuit business has been taken over by Kraft, the Tiger brand of biscuits in Malaysia was renamed Kraft Tiger Biscuits in September 2008.\n\nBritannia is also facing the challenge of rising employee attrition after the recent change of guard.\n\nBritannia - Future Plans\n\n\"CCD Dairy Bread is an instance. We are looking for more such acquisitions in India covering a larger domain. But in the international market we will look at acquisitions in our core areas of biscuits and bakery,\" - Vinita Bali, managing director of Britannia.\n\nThe maker of Good Day and Tiger Biscuits now plans to invest ₹700 crore over the next two years to set up greenfield facilities and scale up capacities of core products and another ₹300 crore for new launches including dairy, taking total investment to over ₹1,000 crore, said Varun Berry Managing Director, Britannia.\n\nBritannia Industries said it will invest ₹700 crore to open more factories as demand for packaged food, including biscuits, has exceeded production capacity with rural markets outpacing urban sales.\n\nBritannia - FAQs\n\nIs Britannia a FMCG company?\n\nYes, Britannia is a FMCG company and one of the favourite and oldest brands in India.\n\nHow many products are in Britannia?\n\nBritannia's product portfolio includes Biscuits, Bread, Cakes, Rusk, and Dairy products including Cheese, Beverages, Milk and Yoghurt.
