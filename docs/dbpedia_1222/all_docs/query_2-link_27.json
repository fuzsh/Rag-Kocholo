        "text": "Good morning, everybody. Welcome to the Britannia Analyst Call. So let me just jump into the presentation, if you get to Page 3 that gives a quick overview on the -- what the GDP growths have been. So if you look at it, the green bar signals the real growth and the red one is -- which shows the inflation. So you will notice that inflation is down. And in this quarter, it's at 7.8 -- 8%, out of which the inflation number is only at 0.2%. So things are coming back to normal, as you'll notice that full year '21, '22 and '22, '23 were at a very high number, as far as inflation was concerned. Moving on to the next slide. This gives an idea of where we play in and what is the total market that we are playing in. So if you look at the categories that Britannia plays in, it's about INR 1 lakh crores, and the 5-year CAGR for this category has been 11%. If you look at the total branded F&B category, that is at INR 9 lakh crores with a 5-year CAGR of 12%. The total F&B is at INR 40 lakh crores, which has got a 5-year CAGR of 11%. And then if you look at the GDP, which is at INR 235 trillion -- it's difficult to calculate lakhs and crores but -- which has got a 5-year CAGR of 9%. So the numbers are looking pretty good. If you look at the right-hand side, you will see that the -- if you look at the average F&B consumption occasions per day, that have gone up. If you look at the 2010 number, it was at 3.9; and that has gone up to 5.1 in 2023. And the biscuit consumption occasions during the year, they used to be at 303 in 2018; and those have gone up to 370 in 2023, so overall looking good. If you look at the next slide, which is a very interesting slide. Basically what's happening is that we are getting to a situation of nuclear families, so size of the family is reducing. The number of women who are participating in the workforce is going up. And as a result of that, there is a need for packaged food and convenience; and that's why the growth that we are seeing, as far as branded F&B is concerned. And obviously this is coupled with the fact that the per capita income is also growing pretty well in the country. Moving on to the next slide. This gives a breakup between the urban and rural, and you will notice that there is more urbanization happening. Urban as a percentage or as a contribution to the overall economy has been growing. It's gone up. Let's say if you were to take -- in the last 2 or 3 years, it's gone up pretty substantially. And so that's good for us because we have predominantly been urban distributed, a stronger urban company. However, for us the growths in the last, let's say, 10 years have been much faster in rural because we've been gaining more distribution and making our presence felt in more villages and smaller towns. So our -- if you look at the bars on the right. Our market share currently is also more urban centric. Our market share is heavier in -- is 1.3x what it is in rural, in urban. And similarly, our numeric distribution is also 1.2x what it is in rural, so for us, the slowdown in rural is something that we can counter with our distribution growths, which will continue. And urban growth is obviously helping us because that's our area of strength. There are more details on this, but I will leave that for you to read through. Moving on to the next slide. This gives the growth potential for categories other than biscuits. So if you look at biscuits, we have a penetration in households of about 94%. So biscuits, bread and rusk has pretty high penetration ranging from 82% to 94%, so there it's going to be a consumption-led growth that we are looking at. And the reason for the same is that, one, as far as biscuits is concerned, per capita consumption in India is only about 2 kilos. And if you were to factor in the number of consumption occasions, which has gone up from 303 to 370 per annum, the number of biscuits that are consumed is just about 1 biscuit per occasion. And that can definitely go up, so it's going to be a consumption-led growth here. And if you were to look at it by categories. While there are categories like glucose, [ Marie ] and some of our cookies which have got reasonably high penetration between 40% to 60%, there are lots of categories where the penetration -- where we have less than 20% penetration in households, so there is a big opportunity for us to grow penetration in those categories and drive consumption thereby of biscuits. There are other categories, like cake, dairy, drinks, wafers, cheese, croissant, where you'll notice that the penetration into households is very, very low. And there we will be looking at a penetration-led growth. Croissant is an absolutely fledgling category where we have to drive penetration into households. So that's how we look at the potential for the future. The next slide is just about we are in a good position with a good portfolio to leverage all of these opportunities and to continue to enhance our capabilities as we move forward. Now just a quick capsule on what's happened in the last 10 years. So if you look at the last 10 years, our distribution has gone up 4x. This is on Page 9, by the way. Our direct reach has gone up 4x. Our rural distributors are up 7x from what they used to be in 2013. We have 4 brands in the INR 1,000 crore-plus category, and these 4 brands contribute INR 9,700 crores to our total turnover. Innovation has contributed 10% of our revenues. Categories and geographies that we've entered into, we've gone into 4 new categories and 4 new geographies outside of India. And we've had 2 very solid partnerships, joint ventures that we've gotten into. One was for croissants, which was with Chipita. And second was just this year with Bel for cheese. So pretty good progress there. Next slide. If you look at our own manufacturing, we are now at about 65% own manufacturing. We have set up 11 new plants in the last 10 years. And we have a mega food park in Ranjangaon, where our total investment is going to be INR 1,500 crores-plus, with very handsome incentives from the Maharashtra government. Cost efficiencies has been a very strong pillar for our profit growth. We've had more than INR 2,000 crores of cost reduction during this period, and that continues to be a pillar for us even in the future. Digital. We have spoken about it in the past. We've gotten into SAP HANA, S/4HANA, which is giving us great dividends. We are rapidly evolving as a digital marketing company. We are leveraging digital to flourish in e-commerce as well. We are leveraging all of the digitization that we've done internally to make sure that we have all the data for us to take very intelligent decisions. And we have a transformation across functions to drive efficiencies with this information. On the sustainability front, we are amongst the top 30 India's most sustainable companies. We've had 100% plastic neutrality. And we are now pretty -- doing quite well even on the international circuit, as far as the Dow Jones index -- sustainability index is concerned. From a people standpoint, we've been rated as a top 15 best employers 4 years in a row. We've been awarded best organization for women in 2023. Our gender diversity from -- in our factories has gone up from 28% to 45%. And we have a -- very agile and resilient teams to navigate through the turbulence that we've seen from an inflation front and from a global scenario, right? So moving on to the next slide. This is what we achieved last year. That was our turnover, a CAGR of 10%. Our operating margins are pretty healthy at 16.3%, which have even gone up further this quarter. And our CAGR on profitability stands at 25%. Our long-term value creation has been pretty good, with a CAGR of 32%. Next slide. This is just something that we feel that it's very basic, but I think it can give us very good dividends. We worked on fill rates. We were at a reasonable rate on fill rates on modern trade and e-commerce, but we've moved up pretty rapidly. We've gained, almost from 75% to 90%, as far as fill rates is concerned; and this will hold us in very good stead as we move forward. We are relooking at our route to market now with a portfolio which is very solid. We are looking at how do we make sure that we leverage our portfolio even better. And coupled with data analytics and artificial intelligence, we are looking at making sure that we become cutting-edge, as far as this is concerned. Now moving on to the performance update for the quarter, Page 14. Our revenues have been flattish. If you look at a 12-month growth number, we've grown only 1%, but our 24-month growth is at 23%. Operating profits have grown on a 12-month growth rate at 21%, a very healthy 58% on a 24-month growth path. Our shares: We had sort of got stagnated a bit for the last quarter, but we have seen a very good exit rate because we've made some corrections which were required from a pricing standpoint to stay competitive in the market. And that's looking good as well. Now getting back to our strategic pillars which we've spoken about every quarter: distribution and marketing, innovation, adjacent categories, cost efficiencies and sustainability. I will cover each one of these in a slide. So as far as distribution is concerned, our direct distribution has gone up. In March 2019, we were at 2.1 million or 21 lakh outlets covered directly. This has gone up to 27.3 lakh in September of 2023. Our total distribution has gone up from 54 lakhs to 66 lakhs, but as you'll notice, bulk of this growth has come from direct distribution. And indirect has stayed at about the same number. Our focused states' growths have been continuously pretty good. These are the last 4 year numbers. You will notice that these have slowed down this year, but that is a result of the whole rural scenario becoming a little slower than what it used to be. However, these growth rates are still healthy. And we are hopeful that, as we move through to the next quarter and onwards, these will come back to double-digit growths as well. Moving to the next slide. We've stepped up our investments, as far as brands is concerned. These are all the brands that we've really supported: Good Day, 50 50, Milk Bikis, NutriChoice, Jim Jam. Jim Jam is doing extremely well. We've also launched Jim Jam Pops, which is adding onto the Jim Jam franchise. And Bourbon, which has been renovated and is doing extremely well in the marketplace. Similarly, on the adjacent categories, there's been quite a bit of activity on cake, rusk as well as on cheese. We've also done some consumer promotions to make sure that we remain competitive and continue to gain share, which we've done continuously for the last 10 years. Innovation. I spoke about Jim Jam Pops, which is doing extremely well, very exciting product and very well appreciated by consumers. 50 50 Golmaal, which is again a very intriguing and interesting product, doing extremely well. We've also launched makhana in 3 flavors. We've launched the portions, which is the triangular portions, the laughing -- under the Laughing Cow brand name; and cheese sachets, which are INR 10 sachets. And all of these innovations are running towards annualized number of about INR 200 crores. Moving on to the next slide. Adjacencies have been on strong footing. Surely, there is more work to be done there. There is competition coming in, in all of these categories, which is good in a way because, when you have more than one player, it always creates more demand. So on cake, we've had some very interesting innovations. Rusk, we've not done as well on the top line, but I think we've rationalized. We've got our recipes up there now. Bread continues its profitable growth trajectory. Cheese has been a double-digit growth contributed by base and all the differentiated formats. Our cheese plant is commercialized for making cheddar cheese, processed cheese; will start by the end of this year, this financial year. And we've already started to supply our whey powder, in addition to the SMP and SCM and -- which is being consumed by our biscuit business. Middle East and Africa is growing double digits with improved margins. Egypt continues to perform well. We've set up an operation in Kenya, which is having its teething troubles, but things are looking like we have a good future there as well. Nepal is a spectacular growth story and continues to be a good -- on a good trajectory both from a bottom line as well as a top line standpoint. Our cost efficiency programs. We've spoken about these. These are the structured programs that we drive. It's about making sure that we have truck utilization which is at the highest level, distance traveled to be reduced, market damages to be reduced -- renewable energy, fuel consumption and the line throughput and efficiencies. And these cost efficiency programs have gone from 1x to 7x in '23, '24. The next slide is about our factories. In this quarter, we've commercialized Bihar. This is our second factory in Bihar, and we have 3 product lines in the first phase. We've also recently added UP, which was commercialized in the previous quarter; and Tamil Nadu, which are operating at desired efficiencies. And we are looking at adding some more lines to our Ranjangaon factory, which is really our flagship factory which is delivering 15% of our total capacity requirement. The next slide is on ESG. As you're aware, we have 4 strategic pillars, as far as ESG is concerned. And these are growth, governance resource and people. Under these 4 pillars, we have 8 levers which are basically around social responsibility, global total foods company, our responsibility towards the country and the people, packaging, supply chain, food waste, resource efficiency and people. And under this, we have 26 programs which we continue to drive very meticulously. And the numbers that you see on this chart give you some of the achievements that we've had under these 26 programs that we run, so I will not drain this chart. It's there for you to go through it and read it, but all I can say is we've made great progress on the ESG front as well. The next slide is about the Britannia Nutrition Foundation and what it does. So just to remind you: Britannia Nutrition Foundation operates in 8 states, with 450 villages which are covered, 500-plus schools, 650-plus Anganwadis. And there are approximately 220,000 beneficiaries out of this program. In this quarter, we've launched a My Plate, My Nutrition initiative, which is along with the government initiative of -- the Poshan Maah as it's called, which is nutrition month. We've had concept champions who are propagating this. These are executed through change agents around the community that we work in. And these are augmented by creating 20,000-plus nutrition gardens in all of these states and the Anganwadis and the villages that we operate in, and this has been a pretty exciting program that our people have been running. Now getting to costs, if you look at commodity. Flour, which is a pretty large component of what we use, is -- has been -- there has been inflation, as far as flour is concerned. Palm oil has been deflationary, and that is giving us some benefits. Sugar has been flattish, slightly inflationary, while packaging is positive. However, if you were to look at the world scenario, I think it's important that we watch out for commodities as we go forward because things could escalate. And hence, we are being very, very vigilant on making sure that we keep these costs under control. Moving on to the next slide. So what are we going to do? And what are the key strategies for us as we go forward? We will continue to invest behind brands and innovation. Cost efficiencies will continue to be a very important pillar for us. We will make sure that we take measured pricing corrections wherever necessary if the commodity situation remains positive. As I said, we are closely monitoring the stock-price situation of commodities with the strife that we are seeing in the Middle East and Russia. And we will remain vigilant, as far as this is concerned. Getting to the financial results. Our top line growths, as I said, healthy for 24 months, low for a 12-month growth number which is 1%; sequentially up from where we were in Q1. So we've achieved INR 4,370 crores in this quarter as our revenue. Next slide, profit. This is looking pretty healthy. Our operating profit has grown by 21% to INR 801 crores, which is 18.3%. And if you look at it on a 24-month growth basis, it's at 58%. Next slide, which gives our 12-month as well as 24-month growths; net sales, as I've already spoken about; profit, operating profit, already spoken about; PBT and PAT at 21% and 19% and on a 24-month growth at 53%. If you look at our ratios, they are looking pretty positive.\n\nSo it's, I would say, good results. I would still make sure that I focus and the team focuses on getting our top line to grow much faster. And I'm confident as we go through the balance of the quarters this year, and therefore, we will see growths coming back. So that's all I have for you. Let's open this for questions, please."
