Biscuits – Good Day, Marie Gold, Milk Bikis, 50-50, Jim Jam, etc.\n\n2. Dairy – Britannia Cheese slice, Britannia WINKIN Cow thick shakes, Britannia Come Alive Paneer, etc.\n\n3. Snacking – Britannia Treat Croissant, Britannia Time Pass Chips, Britannia Treat Cream Wafer, etc.\n\n4. Cakes – Britannia Muffils cakes, Britannia Cake Roll YO!, Britannia Cake Tiffin fun, etc.\n\n5. Rusk – Toastea\n\n6. Bread – Sandwich White bread, Fruit bread, 100% Whole Wheat Sandwich bread, etc.\n\nUnder Varun Berry’s leadership, Britannia has consolidated its position in the core biscuits segment, while its non-biscuits execution has been sub-par. Over the last decade, despite multiple initiatives, the company has yet to be able to diversify from Biscuits. Share of non-biscuits hovers at 22-25%. Further to its aspiration to become a ‘Total Foods Company,’ Britannia aims “to move from the side of the plate to the middle”. Post Covid-19, the share of biscuits has seen expansion.\n\nThe company will focus on clocking equal revenue contributions from its biscuits and non-biscuits segments for the next decade (per an interaction between Britannia Management & CNBC – TV18). It has set a target of expanding non-biscuits’ contribution to ~35% in the next three years, to 40-45% in five years, and to ~50% in the coming ten years, with expected growth acceleration in the non-biscuits segment.\n\nFor the growth of their other business segment, Britannia took some significant steps, like\n\nEntering into a joint venture with an international company like Chipita S.A. to boost the croissants segment\n\nPartnering with BEL to boost Dairy products like cheese.\n\nBritannia is also spending money on innovation and new product launches, including a new variety of cakes and dairy products.\n\nBritannia Industries Fundamental Analysis\n\nRevenue and Profitability\n\nThe Company reported consolidated revenue from operations at INR 16,301 Cr in FY23, up 15.3% Y-o-Y compared to INR 14,136 Cr in FY22.\n\nIt reported consolidated profit after tax (PAT) of INR 2,316 Cr for FY23, a 53% rise Y-o-Y.\n\nOperating margins have stayed in the 16%-17% range for the last five years except for FY21, when it reached 19%, driven by higher home consumption of packaged food during the pandemic.\n\nReturn on Capital Employed\n\nBritannia Industries has been able to post consistent ROCE numbers on the back of its market leadership and ability to pass on price hikes to customers.\n\nThe company delivered 28% ROCE in FY23 against 23.2% in FY22. The company saw margins improving significantly in Q3 and Q4 of FY23, which led to higher PAT and return ratios.\n\nBritannia Industries Share Price History\n\nBritannia Industries is a stock that hasn’t disappointed investors. The company continues to deliver exceptional performance yearly, reflecting Britannia’s share performance. Britannia has delivered a 10-year CAGR of 31% from INR 280 on 25th June 2013 to currently trading at INR 3,438 per share on 25h June 2023.\n\nThe stock price was around INR 63 per share in 1999 (accounting for stock splits and bonus shares), and since then, the company has multiplied investor wealth by a whopping 54x times. The business has built strong moats around its brands, distribution, and marketing, which may be challenging to beat.\n\nBritannia Industries Share Price Target Growth Potential\n\nBiscuits market share continues to rise:\n\nAs seen in the chart below, Britannia Industries has consistently increased its market share and the gap between the largest and the 2nd largest player. It is well-positioned to continue its leadership march in the Biscuits category. Britannia follows a price-straddle approach, which hooks a consumer to the portfolio. This is unlike peer Parle — a strong mass-end player — which has yet to see success in the premium portfolio. On the other hand, ITC is looking to scale its business at the premium end with focused interventions.\n\nAdjacencies provide new levers of growth:\n\nThe company has been charting its business diversification for a long time, albeit dragging its feet on the execution front (non-biscuits share remains at 22-25% of sales). Factors such as robust opportunity in core biscuits, Britannia’s limited domain knowledge in adjacencies, and negative margin mix have hurt its diversification agenda. Britannia is looking to secure partnerships with domain experts, like its tie-up in the croissants/cheese space. Management aspires to achieve 35% revenue from non-biscuits in three years, expanding it to 40% in five years and 50% in ten.\n\nHeightened capex plan till FY25\n\nThe company plans a capex of INR 500-600 crore in FY2024 towards investment in enhancing dairy capacity, a new facility in Bihar, and investments in an existing facility in Ranjangaon. Capex will moderate from FY26 onwards.\n\nKey risks:\n\nKey risks include:\n\nSustained inflation in key wheat flour\n\nA surge in competitive intensity (spike at the premium end),\n\nCompany’s inability to execute in adjacencies, and\n\nSustained rural slowdown\n\n*Disclaimer Note: The securities quoted, if any, are for illustration only and are not recommendatory.
