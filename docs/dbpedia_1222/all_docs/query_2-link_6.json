        "text": "Quick look: #Britannia Industries Faces Tough Times in Business Britannia Industries Q4FY24 Update! Britannia Industries' #Q4FY24results fell below expectations but were in line with projections, with moderate revenue growth of 3% YoY. However, challenges persisted due to subdued demand in rural areas and intense competition impacting volume growth. Despite gross margin improvements, increased advertising expenses and other costs led to a decline in the #EBITDA margin. Favorable weather conditions could lead to higher demand for products, especially in rural regions, which could help to increase sales for Britannia Industries. Knowing how to manage non-core brands better could create new opportunities for diversification and increase company revenue. A normal monsoon season and enhanced performance in non-primary brands would help to improve the stock’s growth. Additionally, using better marketing strategies and managing costs efficiently can reduce the impact of competition and improve overall profitability. #stockmarket #stockstowatch #tradeinsights #marketupdate #thebusinesscorridor Read here: https://lnkd.in/gXAd8BT2\n\nAn average set of numbers from Britannia. Sales grew 8% YOY Margins improved to 17% from 14% last year Net profit grew 35% YOY This significant jump in margins and profitability of the company is on account of sharp reductions in the cost of raw materials. Prices of Palm Oil and Corrugated Boxes have declined by 21% and 25% from last year and this has helped in margins and PAT improvement for the company. Britannia has doubled its rural distribution in the last 5 years. But the interesting point is in the last two years the growth in distribution reach is just 10% which means incrementally the reach expansion is slowing down for them. Their newly focused segment Dairy, is performing well and posted high-double-digit growth in the quarter. They have also launched \"Britannia The Laughing Cow” Cheese this quarter in this category. Overall an average performance, as in the absence of a healthy top-line growth you can only grow the bottom line up to a certain limit with the help of cost control and reduction in raw material prices.\n\nANALYSIS OF FMCG FOOD PROCESSING COMPANIES Q3 RESULTS PART 2 13.
