        "text": "Britannia Industries Ltd. is an Indian Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) company, previously recognized as “Britannia Biscuit Company Limited.” It originated during the pre-independence period in Calcutta, founded by a British entrepreneur in the year 1892. The company is currently owned by the Wadia group, headed by Nusli Wadia, an Indian billionaire businessman.\n\nIn the course of World War II, the British Indian government necessitated a consistent provision of biscuits to cater to the requirements of British soldiers. Hence, the company was established. As of today, Britannia Industries manufactures and sells biscuits all over the world. Being a public limited company, Britannia Industries shares have been listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) since 1998. Additionally, it is a part of the market benchmark index Nifty 50.\n\nIn today’s blog, let’s find out whether to invest in a century-old biscuit company. Britannia Industries shares have given more than a 1000% return in the last 10 years. Is it still worth investing in Britannia shares? Here is a complete fundamental analysis of Britannia Industries’ share.\n\nCompany Overview\n\nBritannia Industries Ltd stands as one of India’s oldest food product companies and holds a significant position in the country’s biscuit industry. While the majority of its revenue is generated from the biscuits segment, the company has expanded its presence into various other sectors, such as bread, dairy products, cakes, snacks, milkshakes, croissants, wafers, and rusks. Some of its prominent brands include Good Day, Marie Gold, Tiger, Nutri Choice, Milk Bikis, and others. Operating with a total of 23 factories (19 national and 4 international), Britannia also exports its products to over 79 countries spanning the Middle East, North America, Europe, Africa, and Southeast Asia.\n\nHere is the revenue mix of the company as of FY 23:\n\nAs you see, 77% of the revenue comes from the biscuits segment, while the rest comes from bread, dairy products, cakes, etc. Also, geographically, 95% of revenue comes from India and the remaining 5% is from other countries globally.\n\nSectoral Outlook – FMCG Sector\n\nThe overall size of the Food & Beverages market in India is estimated at USD 800 billion. Within this, the packaged food market constitutes USD 100 billion, with the branded packaged market accounting for USD 40 billion. This indicates significant potential for expansion. Presently, India lags behind China in the packaged food industry by 4.2 times and other Southeast Asian nations, such as the Philippines, by 3.3 times, highlighting substantial room for growth in this sector.\n\nThe shift from an unorganized to an organized segment within the industry is expected to persist in India in the upcoming years. Changing consumer preferences and a growing inclination towards adopting branded products in small towns and villages contribute to the expansion of Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) companies.\n\nFinancial Highlights\n\nAnalyzing financial statements such as income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements helps investors assess the company’s ability to generate returns, manage debt, and sustain growth, enabling informed and prudent investment choices.\n\nIncome statement of Britannia Industries Ltd.\n\nThe income statement, commonly known as the profit and loss statement, gives you an understanding of its financial performance, such as its sales growth, profitability, etc.\n\nAt StockEdge, we have organized the income statement in a way that will help you analyze it with ease rather than going through the conventional way of downloading the documents from the stock exchanges, which could be time-consuming and tiresome to many.\n\nIn the above image, you can see the annual income statement of Britannia Industries. Every detail is in front of your eyes, starting from the top-line sales figures to the bottom-line Net profit of the company.\n\nSales Growth\n\nAlthough there was a 15% year-on-year increase in sales during the fiscal year 2023, the initial half of fiscal year 2024 recorded net sales of ₹8,444 crore, reflecting a 4% year-on-year growth with no change in volume. The positive performance of the international business was overshadowed by a slowdown in rural areas and increased competition from local players in the domestic market, affecting the overall growth.\n\nEBITDA Growth\n\nIn H1 FY24, EBITDA was ₹1,561 cr, a growth of 29% YoY due to its cost efficiency programs across all functions so as to remain the lowest cost operators in its categories. Nevertheless, there is a simultaneous effort to boost advertising and sales promotion initiatives, aiming to support its brands and foster innovation within the business.\n\nPAT Growth\n\nIn the initial half of fiscal year 2024, the Profit After Tax (PAT) amounted to ₹1,040 crore, demonstrating a 12% year-on-year growth. This growth was facilitated by an enhanced operating profit and increased other income. However, the overall growth was somewhat affected by elevated depreciation and interest costs.\n\nBalance Sheet of Britannia Industries Ltd.\n\nThe balance sheet follows the accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Equity. It provides a company’s financial position, stability, and overall health.\n\nIn the above image, you can see the balance sheet of Britannia Industries Ltd. It provides an overview of the financial position as on date. What are the assets and liabilities of the company? Liabilities of a company can be both short term and long term.\n\nAs of 30th September 2023, total debt stood at ₹2,761 cr v/s total debt of ₹2,981 cr as of 31st March 2023. Post the COVID era, the company’s overall debt went up, but compared to its total assets, the liabilities are reasonable.\n\nCash Flow Statement of Britannia Industries Ltd.\n\nA cash flow statement provides a summary of how a company generates and uses cash over a specific period of time. It has three different sections:\n\nOperating cash flow statement\n\nFinancing cash flow statement\n\nInvesting cash flow statement\n\nOut of these the most important one being the cash flow from operations as it provides you with an understanding of how the company generated cash from its core business operations. A positive cash flow from operation signifies that the company has generated higher cash revenue than its expenditure.\n\nIn FY 2023, the Cash Flow from Operations (CFO) amounted to ₹2,526 crore, a significant increase from ₹1,300 crore in FY22. This improvement was driven by enhanced operating profit and adjustments in working capital.\n\nCash Flow from Investments (CFI) experienced an outflow of ₹1,517 crore, attributable to the acquisition of current investments, inter-corporate deposits (ICDs) extended to group companies, and the procurement of property, plant & equipment.\n\nOn the other hand, Cash Flow from Financing (CFF) showed a lower outflow compared to the previous year, as the company secured long-term debt amounting to ₹1,010 crore.\n\nRatio Analysis of Britannia Industries Share\n\nRatio analysis of a company involves evaluating a company’s financial performance by examining certain ratios which are derived from its financial statements. It makes easy comparing the financial performance to its industry benchmarks or competitors.\n\nRatio has different classifications like profitability ratios, solvency ratios, return ratios and more as you can see in the image below, you can analyze all such ratios directly from StockEdge.\n\nHere are the return ratios of the Britannia Industries share, starting with the two most important ratios which are ROE and ROCE.\n\nWhat is ROE and ROCE?\n\nROE is a profitability ratio that measures the company’s ability to generate net income as a percentage of shareholders’ equity, whereas ROCE assesses the efficiency of a company in utilizing its total capital, including both equity and debt.\n\nReturn on Equity (ROE)\n\nIn FY 2023, the Return on Equity (ROE) reached 76.04%, primarily driven by substantial profit growth. This increase in profit was supported by an exceptional gain of ₹376 crore.\n\nReturn on Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nThe robust ROCE of 55.50% in FY23 signifies the efficiency with which the company utilized its capital to generate operating profits. This improvement reflects the company’s effective management of its resources and a positive impact on overall financial performance.\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio (D/E Ratio)\n\nIn FY 2023, the company’s debt-to-equity ratio was approximately 0.84x. This ratio indicates that the company had a moderate level of financial leverage. A debt-to-equity ratio of less than 1 is generally considered favorable as it suggests a lower financial risk and indicates a more conservative capital structure.\n\nPrice to Equity Ratio\n\nAs of the latest data, Britannia Industries is trading at a Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) Price-to-Earnings (PE) multiple of 49.45x. The elevated PE multiple is likely a result of Britannia’s strong brand recall and its leadership position in the domestic market.\n\nThe PE multiple reflects the market’s confidence in Britannia’s growth prospects and its ability to capitalize on opportunities in the evolving market conditions.\n\nManagement Quality & Shareholding Pattern\n\nThe leadership is directing efforts towards implementing localized strategies, consistently innovating products through renovation, introducing new items, and revamping existing ones. Additionally, there is a focus on expanding into related product categories alongside a concerted effort to enhance direct distribution channels and strengthen the company’s presence in rural areas. Management expects the rural segment to improve to 35% of total revenue in the next few months.\n\nComing to the shareholding pattern of Britannia Industries share, you can check it from the StockEdge App itself.\n\nThe promoter shareholding continues to remain at 50.55%.

Notably, the unwavering promoter’s stake emphasizes a consistent and resolute dedication to the company’s growth and performance.\n\nFuture Outlook of Britannia Industries Share\n\nThe company maintains its commitment to four key strategic pillars: distribution and marketing, cost leadership, innovation, and sustainability.
