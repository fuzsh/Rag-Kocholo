Consequently, the CEO initiated a policy to foster the development and expansion of social products. However, upon assessment, identified challenges emerged, including a decline in profits, a constrained marketing strategy, and the emergence of potential competitors. In response, proposed solutions encompassed cost-saving measures, collaboration with the government or outsourcing, enhanced brand management, and a focus on improving product quality.\n\nINTRODUCTION OF BRITANNIA\n\n• With a century-long legacy, Britannia stands as one of India's premier food companies, boasting an annual revenue exceeding Rs. 9000 Crore.\n\n• Britannia's diverse product range is widely accessible, spanning nearly 5 million retail outlets across the country and reaching over 50% of Indian households.\n\n• The inception of Britannia Industries dates back to 1892 when a group of British entrepreneurs invested Rs. 295 in its establishment.\n\n• In 1918, C.H. Holmes, an English businessman in Kolkata, joined as a partner, leading to the launch of Britannia Biscuit Company Limited (BBCo).\n\n• The heightened demand for biscuits during World War II prompted a name change in 1979 to the current \"Britannia Industries Limited.\"\n\n• By 1982, Peek Ferens' parent company had been acquired by the American firm Nabisco Brands, Inc., solidifying its status as a significant foreign shareholder.\n\nBRITANNIA – ABOUT AND HOW IT WORKS?\n\nBritannia Industries Limited specializes in the production of a diverse range of food products, including Biscuits, Bread, Cakes, Rusk, and Dairy items such as Cheese, Beverages, Milk, and Yoghurt. The company operates within the Foods segment, encompassing bakery and dairy offerings.\n\nWithin the cakes category, Britannia offers a variety of products, including Bar Cakes, Veg Cakes, Chunk Cake, Nut & Raisin Romance, and Monfils. Premium Bake falls under the rusk category.\n\nIn the biscuits segment, the company features well-known brands such as Good Day, Crackers, Nutri Choice, Marie Gold, Tiger, Milk Bikes, Jim Jam + Treat, Bourbon, Little Hearts, Pure Magic, and Nice Time. The bread category includes options like Whole Wheat Breads, White Sandwich Breads, and Bread Assortment.\n\nBritannia Industries exports its products globally, reaching markets in Gulf Cooperation Council Countries (GCC), African Countries, and American Countries. Notable subsidiaries of the company include Manna Foods Private Limited and International Bakery Products Limited.\n\nBRITANNIA – LOGO AND ITS MEANING\n\nhttps://static.startuptalky.com/2021/06/Britannia-Logo-StartupTalky.jpg\n\nLOGO OF BRITANNIA INDUSTRIES LTD\n\nAccording to a representative from Britannia, the company's fresh emblem represents a shift towards becoming the Total Foods Company. This involves an extended range of products, encompassing both health-conscious and indulgent options. The wings of a bird symbolize the freedom to choose when and where one can savor their food.\n\nBRITANNIA FOUNDER AND HISTORY\n\nFounded in 1892 with an initial investment of ?295 by a group of British businessmen, Britannia Industries began its biscuit manufacturing operations in a small house in central Kolkata. On March 21, 1918, the company officially became a public limited company.\n\nIn 1921, Britannia achieved a milestone by being the first company east of the Suez Canal to utilize imported gas ovens. The business prospered, earning a reputation for quality and value. Notably, during World War II, the government entrusted Britannia to supply substantial quantities of 'service biscuits' to the armed forces.\n\nIn 1924, a new factory was established in Mumbai, marking the year when the company became a subsidiary of Peek Frean & Company Limited UK, a prominent biscuit manufacturing company. Britannia further strengthened its position by expanding factories in Calcutta and Mumbai.\n\nBy 1952, the Kolkata factory relocated to Tara Tola Road in the suburbs, with the installation of automatic plants in both Calcutta and Mumbai during the same year.\n\nIn 1954, Britannia introduced high-quality sliced and wrapped bread in India, pioneering this development. The first manufacturing of this bread took place in Delhi, showcasing the company's commitment to innovation and diversification.\n\nIn 1965, a new bakery for bread production was established in Delhi.\n\nIn 1975, Britannia Biscuit Company took over biscuit distribution from Parry's.\n\nThe introduction of Britannia bread in Calcutta and Chennai occurred in 1976.\n\nIn 1978, the company conducted a public issue, resulting in Indian shareholding surpassing 60%.\n\nSubsequently, in 1979, Britannia Biscuit Company Limited rebranded itself as Britannia Industries Limited.\n\nFast forward to the present status in 2023, Britannia stands as one of India's longest-standing companies and is now a part of the Wadia Group led by Nussle Wadia. In the fiscal year 2022, Britannia achieved a revenue of ?13,731.05 crore.\n\nBRITANNIA – MISSION\n\nBritannia's mission is to enhance the financial well-being of its members and customers by meeting their changing requirements in borrowing, investment, and housing.\n\nBRITANNIA PRODUCTS\n\nhttps://static.startuptalky.com/2021/06/Britannia-Industry-Products-StartupTalky.jpg\n\nBAKERY PRODUCTS:\n\nBritannia generates 95% of its yearly revenue from biscuits, utilizing factories with an annual capacity of 433,000 tones. Notable brand names in Britannia's biscuit lineup encompass Vita Marie Gold, Tiger Biscuits, Nutri Choice, Good Day, 50-50, Treat, Pure Magic, Milk Bikis, Bourbon, Nice Time, and Little Hearts, among others.\n\nIn 2006, the mass-market brand Tiger achieved sales totaling $150.75 million, which included exports to the U.S. and Australia. This constituted 20% of Britannia's total revenues for that particular year.\n\nDAIRY PRODUCTS:\n\nDairy products make up nearly 5% of Britannia's overall revenue. The company not only sells dairy products to the public but also engages in business-to-business trading of dairy commodities. The dairy portfolio experienced a growth of 47% in the fiscal year 2000-01 and a subsequent increase of 30% in the fiscal year 2001-02. As previously stated, Britannia is involved in the production and sale of both bakery and dairy items.\n\nAs previously mentioned, Britannia both produces and markets BAKERY and DAIRY PRODUCTS, including:\n\nBread and Buns: Britannia bread, Atta Kulcha bread, Britannia Pav, Britannia sweet bun, Britannia fruit bun\n\nBiscuits: Good day, Britannia Crackers 50-50, Jim Jam, Milk Bikis, Tiger, Marie Gold, Little Hearts, Bourbon, Nutri Choice\n\nCakes: Britannia Gobbles, Britannia Muffins, Tiffin Fun\n\nDairy: Cheese, Milk, Butter, Ghee, Yoghurt\n\nTARGATE AUDIENCE OF BRITANNIA\n\nBritannia's target audience is broad and inclusive, not confined to a specific age or income bracket. The brand caters to a diverse consumer base, employing products like Little Hearts and Tiffin cakes to attract children, Nutri Choice for those with health-conscious preferences, and Marie Gold to meet the needs of the older generation.\n\nHow Does Britannia Make Money?\n\nWhile Britannia's primary goal is to offer nutritional food items to a wide audience, the company generates revenue through various means:\n\nThe sale of its bakery and dairy products is a significant source of revenue.\n\nBiscuit products contribute to 95% of the total sales.\n\nDairy products account for 5% of the overall sales.\n\nBritannia has entered into a joint venture with the Greek company Chi pita S.A to manufacture and market ready-to-eat croissants in India. Additionally, the company is actively working on expanding its market presence abroad, with a particular focus on Africa and South Asia.\n\nBRITANNIA - BUSINESS MODEL\n\nThe company operates in two primary business segments: bakery products and dairy products. Approximately 95% of its revenue is generated from the biscuits segment, while the non-biscuits category (dairy) and the international market contribute around 5% to the total sales.\n\nIn terms of the dairy business, it accounts for nearly 5% of the company's revenue, with Britannia dairy products reaching directly to 100,000 outlets. Britannia Bread, the leading brand in the organized bread market, boasts an annual turnover exceeding 1 lac tons in volume and Rs. 450 crores in value. The business spans 13 factories and 4 franchisees, distributing close to 1 million loaves daily across more than 100 cities and towns in India.\n\nBritannia, as a brand, is committed to providing people with delicious and nutritious food.
