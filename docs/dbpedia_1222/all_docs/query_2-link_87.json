        "text": "April 10, New Delhi: Britannia, the largest bakery foods company and pioneer of sliced bread in India,has launched Millet Bread that contains zero added maida. Packed with the goodness of Ragi, Jowar, Bajra and Oats, it has fibre and minerals that provide consumers a convenient way to include millet based options into their meals.\n\nWith the launch, Britannia becomes the first company in the organized segment to bring Millet Bread into the FMCG market in India. This initiative is aligned with The Central Government’s initiative to promote millets and provide Indians with a nutrient-rich diet. This is in line with the ‘Year of Millets’ declared by the WHO.\n\nIn the year 1954, Britannia became the first brand to bring sliced bread to the dining tables of India. As the pioneer in sliced breads, Britannia wanted to disrupt the market and introduce Millet Bread in order to provide its consumers with a choice based on their current needs and preferences. Even though India is the largest producer of millets in the world, it still faces problems of unbalanced diets and micronutrient deficiency. The Britannia Millet Bread was introduced with an aim to play a part in solving these issues that are still prominent.\n\nCommenting on the launch, Mr. Rajneet Kohli, Chief Executive Officer of Britannia Industries Limited, said, ‘’As the pioneers in the sliced bread category in India, we’ve always been committed to bringing the latest innovations to our consumers. Bread is a staple diet that is consumed daily across millions of households and served in restaurants and even on flights. With the growing need for guilt free snacking, there are rising conversations about choosing foods with millet grains for their benefits. Our aim is to offer an apt solution for our consumers in a category that is highly popular and a staple for several Indian consumers.’’\n\nMr. Yudhishter Shringi, Chief Business Officer Adjacency Business at Britannia Industries Limited, said, ‘’The United Nations has designated 2023 as the ‘International Year of Millets’, giving us the perfect opportunity to bring something new for every Indian that desires to inculcate millet based snacking options in their diet and to create awareness of the benefits of millets. As disruptors in the segment, Britannia believes in introducing products that are relevant to consumer requirements and changing lifestyles. Our brown, 100% whole wheat, and multigrain breads are already immensely popular in the atta-based range. With this foresight, we are taking our portfolio to the next level with the introduction of Millet Bread with zero added maida. Britannia has always thought ahead of time and produced innovative products that have been loved by millions across the country.”\n\nThe all-new Britannia Millet Bread packs are available on Blinkit in Delhi NCR and will soon be available across general and modern trade stores across the nation.\n\nAbout Britannia Industries\n\nAbout Britannia Industries Ltd.
