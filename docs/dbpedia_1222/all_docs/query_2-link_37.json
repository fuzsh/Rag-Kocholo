The slowdown was influenced by price reductions and reduced packaged food consumption. Rural growth outpaced urban areas, but both saw softer consumption. Large companies maintained better performance than smaller players.\n\nIndian consumer goods companies have operated in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Nepal for years, generally facing little impact from local instability. Marico's stock dipped nearly 6% due to its substantial earnings from Bangladesh, where its subsidiary accounts for a significant portion of its overseas revenue. Other FMCG companies saw lesser impacts.\n\nIndian consumer goods companies have paused their operations in Bangladesh following violent protests that led Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to flee. Major companies like Coca-Cola and Marico are prioritizing employee safety and suspending sales until normalcy returns. These operations in Bangladesh provide a small but crucial part of their revenue.\n\nPolitical unrest in Bangladesh caused shares of Saffola edible oil producer Marico to drop over 4%, as the company generates 11-12% of its revenue from the country. Several other companies with operations in Bangladesh, including Pearl Global Industries, Emami, Bayer Corp, GCPL, Britannia, Vikas Lifecare, Dabur, Asian Paints, Pidilite, Jubilant Foodworks, and Bajaj Auto, could also be affected by the ongoing turmoil.\n\nBritannia, Parle, Mondelez, and Dabur consider increasing prices by 4-10% due to rising costs of key ingredients like flour, cocoa, and sugar. This follows several quarters of price reductions meant to boost demand. Companies aimed to ensure volume growth while facing food inflation and fluctuating commodity prices, predicting a gradual price increase.\n\nBritannia Industries Announcement under Regulation 30 (LODR)-Analyst / Investor Meet - Outcome\n\n| Announcement\n\nPursuant to Regulation 30 read with Clause 15 of Para A of Part A of Schedule III of the SEBI Listing Regulations, 2015, please find enclosed the copy of Analysts Call Presentation pertaining to the Unaudited Consolidated and Standalone Financial Results of the Company for the Quarter ended 30th June, 2024.\n\nGlenmark Life Sciences, Hindustan Unilever, and Lux Industries saw their shares rise as Nifty and Sensex dropped over 3% on Monday. Glenmark soared 6.3%, Lux Industries increased 5.5%, and other stocks like Marico and Britannia posted gains. Market volatility persists amid global economic concerns and geopolitical tensions.\n\nTrading on Monday saw Tata Motors and ONGC shares fall by 5%, causing the Nifty 50 index to drop by 3%. Shares of Hindalco, Mahindra & Mahindra, and Tata Steel also declined. Britannia, Sun Pharma, and a few other stocks managed gains. The market was influenced by global economic concerns and potential US recession indicators.\n\nThe past week saw domestic markets close marginally lower amid volatility. Key highlights included SBI's 0.9% rise in Q1 net profit, Titan’s slight profit decrease, and Divi's Labs' 21% profit growth. Airtel, ONGC, and Marico were noted for upcoming Q1 results, while Infosys had significant regulatory updates.\n\nThe Street will react to major earnings reports from SBI, Divi’s Laboratories, Titan, and Britannia when markets resume trading on Monday. Additionally, 922 BSE-listed companies will announce April-June earnings, including Bharti Airtel and Tata Power. Indian markets will take cues from US market closures and GIFT Nifty futures.\n\nBritannia Industries Announcement under Regulation 30 (LODR)-Newspaper Publication\n\n| Announcement\n\nPursuant to Regulation 30 and 47 of the SEBI Listing Regulations, 2015, please find enclosed e-copies of the Newspaper Advertisement published today i.e., 3rd August, 2024 in \"Financial Express\" (English - All Editions) and in \"Sangbad Pratidin\" (Bengali - Kolkata edition) for the Unaudited Standalone and Consolidated Financial Results of the Company for the Quarter ended 30th June, 2024\n\nBHEL, Eicher Motors, Bharti Airtel, and NTPC were among companies gearing up for attention due to upcoming record dates for dividends, bonus issues, and stock splits.
