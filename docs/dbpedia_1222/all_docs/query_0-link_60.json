Britannia chief executive officer Vinita Bali expanded via email on the company’s perception overseas. Edited excerpts:\n\nOn overseas presence: Several of our bakery and dairy brands are available in approximately 30 countries.\n\nOn image building outside India: We support our brands selectively, depending on the market and this consists of in-market and some media support.\n\nOn key challenges in building a brand abroad: Establishing the relevance and differentiation of your brands in markets with an abundance of choice.\n\nOn customer perceptions: In our experience, consumers around the world buy brands and not companies or the way they are structured.\n\nOn stereotyping related to quality: To compete effectively, quality and its consistent delivery, is a given.\n\nOn sector status, identity: Being global is the way companies look at the world and their business. Consumers look for brands that satisfy their needs and are different, better and special.\n\nOn striking a balance between home, abroad: Each business is distinct - with its own portfolio and P&L.\n\nOn overseas opportunities: Growth opportunities are what we seek and some of our key markets are in the Middle East, South East Asia, Africa, Australia and North America."
