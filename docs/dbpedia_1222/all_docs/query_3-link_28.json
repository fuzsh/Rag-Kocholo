Evidence from the deeply buried geology shows that the region originally formed as a group of oceanic volcanic islands in the southern hemisphere, which later became part of the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana. Continental drift propelled the region steadily northwards. At various times during this journey East Anglia has been covered by deep and shallow seas, tropical forests, river deltas, arid deserts, sand seas, arctic tundra and continental-scale ice sheets. The region is particularly famed for its Quaternary geology which forms one of the most important long-term archives of Quaternary environmental change and early human occupation in northern Europe.\n\nThe first edition of the Regional Guide was published in 1937, with the fourth and most recent edition, compiled by C P Chatwin, published in 1961. A revision of the East Anglia Regional Guide has been long overdue because fundamental changes have occurred in our understanding of geology, including plate tectonics and climate change, which are of critical importance to the geological story of East Anglia. These paradigm shifts in geological thinking have driven the rewriting of this guide, which highlights the importance of the region from both purely scientific and applied geological research perspectives.\n\nWhilst retaining the methodical aspects of previous editions, the style of the new edition is a narrative of East Anglia’s geological journey through profound environmental upheavals and how they have acted to shape the modern physical landscape. It sets out how these events can be interpreted in the broader perspective of global geological processes and environmental change. Two chapters provide stand-alone overviews of the bedrock and Quaternary geology and provide a contextual framework for more detailed accounts of the geology provided within other chapters. A further chapter explores both modern and historical links between geology and humans – issues such as geodiversity, water and mineral resources, coastline management, geohazards, building stones and energy.\n\nThe book thus offers a comprehensive account of the geology of East Anglia and how it has been shaped by global processes. It should prove informative to a wide range of users including those with a general interest, students and professional scientists, planners and engineers.\n\nJohn N Ludden, PhD Executive Director.

To this day, the region continues to be at the forefront of geology with research focusing on records of environmental change spanning the late Mesozoic and Cenozoic, as well as in important aspects of applied geology.\n\nSince the publication of the previous East Anglia Regional Guide in 1961, there have been fundamental advancements in the science of geology and its wider application. Many of these new concepts manifest themselves within the geology of East Anglia, both in terms of how the geology of the region is described but, perhaps more significantly, the broader context and significance of the geology and how it interacts with human interests. We now understand that much of the concealed and surface bedrock geology of the region relates to the formation and subsequent break-up of the Pangaea supercontinent during the Late Palaeozoic and Mesozoic, the opening of the North Sea Basin and the relative emergence of the British landmass. The resulting geology includes several major rock types that are important aquifers and provides mineral resources at both regional and national scales.\n\nModern scientific appraisal points to the Quaternary Period as being significantly less benign than previously imagined. Rather, it is one of the most dynamic and complex periods of recent earth history characterised by numerous global-scale changes in climate that have acted to drive extensive and cyclical changes in palaeogeography and geological processes. The landscape of Britain has proven to be highly sensitive to Quaternary climate change due principally to its proximity to polar and low latitude weather systems and our maritime geographical position relative to northern Europe. East Anglia possesses a sedimentary archive of environmental change that spans, albeit discontinuously, much of the Quaternary. It is widely acknowledged as one of the most important long-term records of its type in northern Europe, contributing significantly to our understanding of the nature of past climates and environments, early human evolution, and the sensitivity of the landscape to climate change, sea-level change and neotectonics.\n\nWithin this new Regional Guide we provide a broad perspective of the geology of East Anglia, encompassing the counties of Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridgeshire and parts of Lincolnshire and Bedfordshire. The principal aim of the guide is to provide an overview of the geological framework of the region, its earth history context and relevance to the activities and interests of society. With this scope in mind, the guide has been written for the informed reader and whilst some scientific terminology is employed, we attempt to explain it in an accessible manner. The guide has been subdivided into two main parts, the first describes the bedrock evolution of the region, with chapters devoted to the concealed geology, Jurassic, Early Cretaceous, Late Cretaceous and Palaeogene. Part two focuses on different aspects of the Late Pliocene to Holocene geology of East Anglia, and therefore is dominated by the Quaternary Period. Both sections are preceded by overview chapters that show how the regional geology can be understood in a broader framework of tectonic, climatic and palaeogeographical processes. For more detailed information on specific localities and topics, readers are directed to the ‘sheet memoirs’ and other descriptive texts that accompany the published 1:50 000 geological maps; and the scientific literature that is detailed within the Bibliography at the back of the guide.\n\nThroughout the Regional Guide, chronostratigraphical ages are used in accordance with the geological timescale of the International Commission on Stratigraphy (Gradstein, F M, Ogg, J G, Schmitz M, D, and Ogg G, M, (editors). 2012. The Geologic Time Scale 2012. Elsevier B V). By convention, epochs are typically subdivided into Early, Mid and Late, except for the UK Quaternary, where the terms Early, Middle and Late are more commonly used by workers and this nomenclature is adopted here.\n\nLandscape and geology\n\nThe low-lying flat expanses of the Fenland bordering The Wash, drained by the rivers Great Ouse and Nene, give way eastwards to higher, gently undulating terrain, cut by easterly draining rivers such as the Stour, Gipping, Deben and Alde in the south, and Waveney, Yare, Wensum and Bure in the north (Figure 1). This topographical contrast is reflective of the bedrock geology, with soft-weathering clays beneath the Fenland passing eastwards into more resistant sandstones and limestones, including the Chalk (Figure 2).\n\nThe geological succession of the East Anglia region is shown in (Figure 3) and (Figure 4), and a simplified map showing the distributions of the bedrock units is given in Figure 2. The succession at rockhead comprises Mesozoic and Cenozoic units, ranging from Mid Jurassic to Neogene in age. The Mesozoic succession largely forms parallel bands in an arcuate outcrop trending south-west to north-east in the south of the region to north–south in the north. Strata dips are typically to the south-east and south (Figure 2). In contrast, Cenozoic deposits in the south-east of the region cross the Chalk in a roughly west-south-west to east-north-east orientation; their pattern relates to the broadly east–west orientation of the London Basin further south, into which the Cenozoic succession thickens progressively eastwards into the North Sea area. Most natural exposures of the bedrock geology occur in the western part of the region, or in cliffs along the coast; elsewhere an extensive cover of Quaternary deposits masks the underlying geology.\n\nThe geological foundations of East Anglia are ancient ‘basement’ rocks of late Neoproterozoic and Palaeozoic age, cut by deep-seated thrust faults and uplifted during Mid Devonian earth movements. They form a rigid structural block that subsequently became persistently dominated by terrestrial and shallow marine environments in the Mesozoic and Cenozoic. In recent decades our knowledge of these rocks has been greatly enhanced by information from deep boreholes and regional gravity and aeromagnetic data. These data show that later Palaeozoic and early Mesozoic (pre-Jurassic) successions are generally thin and sporadically developed in the subsurface, and largely influenced by the lateral encroachment of contemporaneous deposition occurring in the adjacent southern North Sea Basin.\n\nPersistent periods of higher relative sea level during the later Mesozoic created the extensive areas of Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks that dominate the bedrock geology of East Anglia. Thick, soft-weathering Mid and Late Jurassic mudstones form the wide embayment around The Wash, and predominantly underlie the low-lying Fenland in the north-east of the region. These clays are an important resource for brickmaking around Peterborough, and have also contributed outstanding specimens of Jurassic marine reptiles to museum collections.\n\nEarly Cretaceous rocks form thin outcrops running south from The Wash (Figure 2), and although superbly exposed in the multicoloured cliffs at Hunstanton, knowledge of their character elsewhere in the region mainly comes from boreholes and temporary exposures. East Anglia is one of the few parts of the UK where marine conditions persisted across the Jurassic–Cretaceous boundary, and the region has figured prominently in studies of this key interval. Across East Anglia, as elsewhere in the wider Anglo–Paris Basin/North Sea, the Late Cretaceous is synonymous with the Chalk Group. Despite being the most extensive geological unit at rockhead, in East Anglia the Chalk is widely covered by Quaternary strata, so that with the exception of south-east Cambridgeshire, it does not generally form typical downland landscapes. The western margin of the Chalk forms a reasonably well-defined escarpment south of The Wash and also near Newmarket and Cambridge, but is much less well defined in the vicinity of Methwold and Mildenhall, where the Chalk is cut through by the rivers Lark and Little Ouse, and the trend of the Chalk swings round from south-south-east to south-west. Evidence from regional gravity data suggests that this marked change in the structural trend of the Chalk may result from later movement of a fault in much older rocks at depth. In the past, the area where Chalk is at crop was covered by many small pits used for the extraction of agricultural lime for soil improvement, and palaeontological data from these as well as modern quarries and the ancient flint workings at Grimes Graves, has allowed understanding of the age distribution of the Chalk beneath the Quaternary cover.\n\nThe understanding of the stratigraphy of Jurassic and Cretaceous units has advanced greatly since the previous edition of this Regional Guide. Partly this is a consequence of civil engineering feasibility studies and works within the region, such as the Wash Water Storage and Ely–Ouse Water Transfer schemes; a pilot study of oil shale occurrences in the Kimmeridge Clay; and investigations at Mundford, in the 1960s, as a potential site for a large proton accelerator. All of these projects have involved the drilling of boreholes to investigate the detailed geological succession. As a result of these initiatives, detailed stratigraphical schemes have been developed for the Ampthill Clay, Kimmeridge Clay and Gault formations. At Mundford, geophysical logs and core from boreholes have allowed more-detailed understanding of variation in the physical character of the Chalk, and drilling of the BGS Trunch Borehole has allowed parts of the Norfolk succession to be related to the Chalk of Lincolnshire and Yorkshire.\n\nThe mixed clays and sandstones that form the youngest part of the bedrock succession, belonging to the Palaeogene and Neogene, are mainly found in the south-eastern part of the region, and in the subsurface northwards into Norfolk; their original extent was probably greater, but was subsequently reduced by erosion. Palaeogene deposits represent deposition in a plexus of nonmarine, nearshore and offshore-marine settings, and part of the succession preserves evidence of voluminous igneous activity associated with the opening of the North Atlantic. In places, weathering of the Palaeogene succession has reduced it to a covering of blocks of hard, silica-cemented sandstones (sarsens) scattered over the present-day land surface.\n\nNeogene strata are represented by the two basal formations of the Crag Group. The Crag Group collectively records shallow-marine and coastal sedimentation within the western margins of the North Sea Basin (known locally as the Crag Basin). Deposition occurred during the Pliocene, Early Pleistocene and early Middle Pleistocene prior to the creation of the Straits of Dover; thus the British landmass was joined to mainland Europe at this time.\n\nThe Coralline Crag Formation is of early Pliocene age and forms a narrow outcrop between Aldeburgh and Orford on the Suffolk coast and extends offshore to the north-east for several kilometres. Although originally named for its abundant ‘coral’ fauna, the Coralline Crag actually comprises bryozoan-rich calcareous sandstones deposited within a shallow marine environment. Deposition of the overlying Red Crag Formation spans the boundary between the Neogene and Quaternary periods and is of Late Pliocene to earliest Pleistocene age. The Red Crag Formation is composed of cross-bedded sands and mud drapes that record the migration of offshore tidal sand banks, it crops out within the south-east of the Regional Guide area. Overlying shallow-marine and coastal deposits of the Norwich Crag and Wroxham Crag formations were deposited during the Early Pleistocene and early Middle Pleistocene and these crop out and occur buried at depth through eastern Suffolk and Norfolk. The age of the boundary between the two formations is not known with any certainty but it is widely acknowledged that several major unconformities of generally unknown duration occur throughout the sequence. Vertical and lateral facies associations and the existence of distinctive emergent surfaces demonstrate that fluctuations in sea level occurred on numerous occasions during the deposition of the Crag Group. It highlights the sensitive position of eastern East Anglia during the Pliocene to early Middle Pleistocene interval, with even small changes in sea level resulting in significant changes in geography and the position of the coastline. This is highlighted by the complex interdigitation of shallow-marine (Crag Group) sediments and terrestrial deposits that relate to the large preglacial river systems (see below) that drained central and eastern England.\n\nFluviatile sediments, composed largely of sands and gravels, belong to the Britannia Catchments Group and include two major stratigraphical subdivisions within the Regional Guide area. These correspond to the ancestral Thames (Kesgrave Catchment Subgroup) and Bytham (Bytham Catchments Subgroup) river systems. Sand and gravel deposits form distinctive terrace staircases situated on the flanks of these former river valleys and indicate that uplift occurred in central England during the Early and early Middle Pleistocene.\n\nVariations in the lithology of these fluvial deposits and their marine equivalents reflect temporal changes in catchment extent and the processes operating within the catchments themselves; all occurred against a backdrop of progressive climatic change. It was against this backdrop of massive climatic instability that early humans first occupied the landscape of East Anglia. Archaeological evidence from East Anglia demonstrates that the first human occupation of northern Europe may have occurred as long as 800 000 years ago with humans living in a range of climates that at times were much cooler and warmer than the present day.\n\nThe most extensive glaciation to affect Britain during the Quaternary occurred at the beginning of the late Middle Pleistocene, about 450 000 years ago, and is known as the Anglian Glaciation. During its maximum extent, ice covered over two-thirds of the British Isles and resulted in the widespread modification of the preglacial landscape of East Anglia.\n\nLobes of British Ice Sheet extended across the region from the Pennines to the north-west and the North Sea to the north. However, the precise age of these deposits remains debated and the possibility remains that elements of the ‘Anglian’ sequence of the region could relate to either older or younger glaciations. This glacial advance saw the Chalk escarpment that forms the western bedrock spine of the region lowered, causing it to migrate eastwards and the Fen and Wash basins to be eroded. Upon deglaciation, a new postglacial drainage network developed in East Anglia focused upon the Fen Basin with the establishment of river systems such as the Nene, the Ouse and the Cam with the northward flowing streams established over the relict till sheet. Early humans were not always present in East Anglia following the Anglian Glaciation. Partly, this is because the formation of the Straits of Dover was initiated during the Anglian Glaciation, and during subsequent periods of high global sea level, Britain and East Anglia became isolated from continental Europe restricting the migration of early humans.\n\nIn the last Devensian cold stage, evidence from many of the Fenland river systems shows that the landscape of western and northern East Anglia was a cold and barren place.\n\nDuring the Late Devensian, glacier ice extended southwards into the Southern North Sea Basin, reaching the margins of The Wash and the north-west Norfolk coast, and deposited sediments that form part of the North Sea Coast Glacigenic Subgroup. To the south of this ice limit, East Anglia was arctic tundra with the widespread development of periglacial features and deposition of windblown cover sand. Humans were absent from the region for much of this Late Devensian cold interval but returned as climate improved during the Late Glacial with Britain finally becoming an island about 8000 years ago as sea levels rose rapidly during the current Holocene Interglacial.\n\nWhilst sea-level change and climatic amelioration underpin the geology of the Early Holocene, the past 6000 years have been increasingly dominated by human interaction with the landscape and underlying geology — from woodland clearance to expanding agriculture and the drainage of the Fen, urbanisation, resource extraction and coastal management.\n\nToday, East Anglia is one of the fastest growing regions of the UK, and it is certain that management of its geological resources will continue to play an important part in its future development.\n\nChapter 1 Bedrock geology of East Anglia: national and global context\n\nM A Woods\n\nThe subdued topography of East Anglia, and overwhelming influence of Quaternary deposits on the character of the landscape, belies the fact that the region has a much more ancient geological history. This history tells the geological story of how and when East Anglia was formed, and progressively shaped, during cycles of rock deposition and major tectonic events. Study of the region continues to provide evidence of the wider story of global change that shaped the geological evolution of the British Isles. Figure 5 summarises the key events in the pre-Quaternary geological history of East Anglia.\n\nNeoproterozoic to Silurian: basement evolution\n\nEast Anglia, in common with the broad area of England extending to the Solway Firth, is underlain by deformed Precambrian and Early Palaeozoic rocks, forming the concealed Caledonide basement (Figure 6). During the late Precambrian, the basement of England and much of Wales, including East Anglia, formed part of the microcontinental Avalonian Terrane, the western part of which occurs in eastern North America and the eastern part underlies the Low Countries and north-west Germany. Geochemical evidence reveals that the Precambrian plutonic and volcanic rocks that form the terrane are recycled fragments of juvenile crust* and evolved continental crust, and probably include fragments of juvenile oceanic island arcs or plateaux developed during the amalgamation of a supercontinent at about 1.0 Ga. By about 660 Ma, the Avalonian Terrane had accreted onto the margin of the ancient continent of Gondwana, with extensive coeval phases of continental arc magmatism* between 640 and 550 Ma; volcaniclastic* rocks from this episode crop out in the Charnwood Forest area of Leicestershire. A transition to a stable continental platform occurred by approximately 540 Ma, whereupon marginal terranes, including Avalonia, began to break off Gondwana as the Iapetus Ocean opened between Laurentia and Gondwana.\n\nThe Iapetus Ocean was probably at least 5000 km wide at its maximum extent, and separated regions that currently include England and most of Wales from the palaeocontinent of Laurentia, which included Scotland (Figure 7a). Little is known about the Iapetus Ocean in relation to East Anglia prior to the Ordovician, although it seems likely that the region bordered a narrow arm of this ocean, known as the Tornquist Ocean. Deep marine sandstones, siltstones and fossiliferous mudstones of Tremadoc (485.4 to 477.7 Ma) and Llanvirn (467.3 to 485.4 Ma) ages occur in the Wyboston and Huntingdon boreholes, and data from deep boreholes and airborne geophysical surveys suggests the widespread occurrence of Ordovician igneous rocks at depth beneath East Anglia (Figure 8). These rocks, and deep thrust faults such as the Glinton Thrust, are thought to reflect convergence of the Avalonian and Baltica terranes, and subduction of the ocean crust that separated them.\n\nSilurian strata are commonly encountered in deep boreholes across the region (Figure 6). The Silurian rocks suggest the presence of an oxygenated, storm-influenced, sand- and mud-dominated outer shelf in the south-west of the region, marginal to a platform area further to the south-west, with more mud-rich sediments deposited in less-well-oxygenated conditions to the north-east (Figure 9a). The closure of the Iapetus Ocean, and concomitant deformation and uplift of the intervening sedimentary succession largely occurred before the end of the Silurian, and was once thought to be responsible for the Acadian Orogeny, deemed to be the cause of the deformation and weak metamorphism recorded in the Silurian rocks. However, evidence now indicates that the Acadian deformation is Early Devonian in age and some 20 million years later than the closure of Iapetus. Acadian deformation is undoubtedly present in the buried Early Palaeozoic rocks in East Anglia, but the clear distinction between Acadian and earlier, possibly Late Ordovician structures developed on the large scale, is problematical. Earlier-formed thrusts are likely to have been reactivated, and evidence has recently emerged for some of these structures influencing the pattern of much later Mesozoic sedimentation.\n\nLate Palaeozoic: emergence of the London– Brabant High\n\nDuring the Devonian, East Anglia, in common with much of the rest of the UK appears to have been dominated by largely arid terrestrial environments, probably including deltas, alluvial plains and upland landscapes (Figure 9b). Marine conditions were largely restricted to southern England, and in the Late Devonian a shoreline appears to have cut along the southern fringes of East Anglia, with a borehole at Wyboston showing evidence of large plant fragments associated with a sparse fauna of marine microfossils. The Devonian marks the start of a long and persistent phase of nearshore and terrestrial environmental conditions across East Anglia. Whilst the fringes of the region were periodically inundated by marine conditions, it was not until the mid Cretaceous that marine sedimentation became re-established across the whole region.\n\nBy the beginning of the Carboniferous, continental drift had moved the British Isles into an equatorial location, on the northern edge of a marine corridor between the two large continental masses of Laurentia (to the north) and Gondwana (to the south) (Figure 7b).\n\nTropical carbonate reefs, sandstone-dominated deltas and lushly vegetated alluvial plains (coal swamps) were the dominant geological themes for most of the British Isles at this time, with crustal extension creating shallow blocks and deeper basins, and the waxing and waning of high latitude ice sheets driving rapid oscillations of sea level. Little of this directly affected East Anglia, which for most of this period formed part of the London–Brabant High (also known as ‘St George’s Land’), extending from the near continent across central England and on into Wales (Figure 9c, d). However, a phase of early Carboniferous crustal extension influenced the development of the southern North Sea Basin on the margins of East Anglia, and reactivation of the thrusts forming part of the East Anglian basement may also have occurred.\n\nIn the early Carboniferous, marine conditions probably occurred just south of the London area, and Carboniferous strata preserved in boreholes at Cambridge and Gayton suggest a location close to the southern margin of the London–Brabant landmass. In the later part of the early Carboniferous, shallow-marine conditions may have extended northwards across Suffolk; contemporaneous deposits at depth in north-east Norfolk include shallow shelf limestones, but if similar deposits existed across Suffolk then they were removed by later erosion. Fluvial-deltaic and lacustrine sandstones, siltstones and mudstones are typical of the later part of the Carboniferous, and are locally present in boreholes in north-east Norfolk.\n\nProgressive convergence of Laurentia and Gondwana during the Carboniferous largely eliminated marine conditions from much of the British Isles, and the East Anglian region now formed a rigid block ahead of an advancing mountain-building front. This period of earth movement, the Variscan Orogeny, brought Laurentia and Gondwana together, creating the supercontinent of Pangaea. The northern edge of thrusting associated with Variscan uplift, the ‘Variscan Front’, runs just to the south of the East Anglian region, but regions further north were affected by broader deformation. Reactivation of older structures is likely to have occurred, probably including basement thrusts beneath East Anglia.\n\nThe palaeogeography of the British Isles was radically altered by the Variscan Orogeny and the formation of Pangaea. In the Permian the whole region lay deep within the Pangaean supercontinent. This vast continent spanned the Equator and extended to high northern and southern latitudes (Figure 7c). Britain occupied a position at low latitudes in the northern hemipshere, within an arid climate belt in the path of easterly trade winds. East Anglia is inferred to have largely been covered by a slightly elevated rock desert, with patches of sand and gravel and some areas occupied by sand dunes (Figure 9e), just a small part of a vast desert area that was probably comparable in its scale to the modern-day Sahara. In the early Permian, northerly directed fluvial palaeocurrents carried sandy conglomerates (Rotligendes Group) from eroding uplands to the south, across north Norfolk into the low-lying North Sea Basin. By the late Permian this basin was occupied by the largely land-locked ‘Zechstein Sea’, perhaps up to 200–300 m deep at its maximum development. The shoreline, bordered by arid salt flats ‘sabkhas’, largely skirted around north Norfolk, but encroached into the north-east part. Cycles of evaporation and marine flooding produced the alternating carbonate–evaporite succession of the Zechstein Group. Subsidence across this part of East Anglia and the adjacent East Midlands Shelf was probably largely controlled by thermal relaxation of the lithosphere underlying the Southern North Sea, following an early Permian phase of crustal extension in this region.\n\nMesozoic: flooding of the London– Brabant High\n\nThe Triassic, represented by subsurface occurrences of pebble beds, sandstones, siltstones and mudstones (Figure 6), saw a continuation of the largely arid terrestrial environments that dominated East Anglia and the wider British Isles during the Permian. Near Lakenheath and Soham, where the undifferentiated succession rests unconformably on Palaeozoic rocks, deposition probably occurred by flash floods, in ephemeral streams and playa lakes. A thin covering of these rocks was thought to occur quite widely across the East Anglian region, but some of these occurrences might actually represent Late Devonian or Carboniferous strata.\n\nA greater nearshore and marine influence is suggested for deposition of the Bacton and Haisborough groups (broadly equivalent to the onshore Sherwood Sandstone and Mercia Mudstone groups), which overlie Carboniferous strata in boreholes in north-east Norfolk.\n\nBritain still formed part of Pangaea, but now at a slightly more northerly latitude (15 to 20°) with a monsoonal climate. Tectonically, crustal stresses were beginning to develop that would eventually cause the break-up of Pangaea, the formation of new ocean basins, and the progressive return of marine conditions to the East Anglia region. This process began with a marine transgression, emanating from the south-west, in the Late Triassic. By Rhaetian times this had covered much of central and south-west England, the Southern North Sea, and the fringes of East Anglia. Along the northern and western shores of the London–Brabant High, which still dominated the heart of East Anglia, thin successions of limestones and sandy limestones represent marginal facies of the Penarth Group, heralding the widespread development of marine conditions in the Jurassic.\n\nBy the Early Jurassic, a combination of sea-level rise and regional subsidence, related to crustal extension associated with the opening of the Atlantic Ocean, turned Britain into a cluster of islands surrounded by shallow seas. Elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide levels meant that global climate was much warmer than the present day, so despite being only some 10° south of our current latitude, the region enjoyed subtropical conditions. One of the largest islands in this archipelago was the London–Brabant High, extending across much of East Anglia and southwards to the London area and Kent (Figure 9f). Through the Jurassic the extent of this land area waxed and waned in response to the interplay of sea-level change and tectonic uplift or subsidence. The region became progressively more marine influenced through the Early Jurassic; fluctuated between terrestrially and marine-dominated in the Mid Jurassic (Figure 10a); became progressively more marine in the Late Jurassic (Figure 7d, 10b); and finally terrestrially dominated in the latest Jurassic. Consequently the development of Jurassic rocks across the region is very variable; in some cases it is likely that the original extent of geological units has been reduced as a consequence of intra-Jurassic and later Early Cretaceous erosion events. This dynamic marine environment is reflected in the variety of rock types deposited during the Jurassic. There were largely deep-water marine mudstones and clays (Charmouth Mudstone, Whitby Mudstone, Oxford Clay, West Walton, Ampthill Clay and Kimmeridge Clay formations); nearshore, marginal marine and freshwater deposits (Northampton Sand, Grantham, Rutland and Blisworth Clay formations); and high-energy, shallow-marine limestones (Lincolnshire Limestone, Blisworth Limestone, and Cornbrash formations) (Figure 6). Some of these rock types show cyclic features that may be related to regular climatic fluctuations resulting from regular oscillations in the Earth’s orbital parameters (Milankovitch Cycles). In some cases short-lived periods of environmental change gave rise to distinctive rock types, such as the sand-rich Dyrham Formation related to a brief fall in sea level, or the Marlstone Rock and Kellaways Clay, formed during periods of sea-floor anoxia.\n\nIn the Mid Jurassic the East Anglia region was influenced by the development of a major upwarp caused by thermal doming associated with volcanic activity in the North Sea Basin (Figure 10a). This doming was probably developed in response to crustal stretching caused by Atlantic rifting, and at times the related regional uplift experienced across East Anglia and adjacent regions acted to mitigate the effects of sea-level rise and promote the development of freshwater and lacustrine conditions. In contrast, Late Jurassic lithospheric extension beneath the North Sea appears to have accelerated subsidence rates across the East Midlands Shelf and adjacent areas during the Kimmeridgian, and this is reflected in the extensive coverage and thickness of the Kimmeridge Clay Formation in the north-west of the East Anglia region.\n\nBy the close of the Jurassic, the sea had retreated from much of the British Isles, and the island landmass that had dominated East Anglia for much of the Jurassic now adjoined low-lying river plains to the south and west (Figure 10c). Sediments spanning the boundary between the Jurassic and Cretaceous are rarely preserved in Britain, but the northern fringes of East Anglia are an exception with a succession of ammonite-bearing sandstones (Sandringham Sand Formation), with phosphate horizons recording periodic breaks in sedimentation. Here marine conditions persisted for much of the Early Cretaceous, with the deposition of the Dersingham, Roach and Carstone formations (Figure 6), although the continuity of the succession is broken by erosion events, particularly between the Roach and Carstone. Overall, the story of the Cretaceous is mainly one of progressive global sea-level rise, driven by exceptionally high rates of ocean spreading that influenced mid-ocean-ridge systems and displaced ocean volumes onto adjacent landmasses. Initially a marine corridor extended around the western and southern margins of East Anglia, depositing sandstones (Woburn Sand Formation) that provide evidence of a seaway swept by powerful currents, and towards the end of the Early Cretaceous (Late Albian) the bulk of the region was covered with marine mudstones of the Gault Formation, with coeval limestones of the Hunstanton Formation forming across a shallow-water shoal covering north-west Norfolk (Figure 10d). In the Late Cretaceous, sea levels rose to exceptionally high levels, perhaps 200–300 m above their present values, and East Anglia together with much of north-west Europe was blanketed in fine-grained deposits of Chalk (Figure 6). The tiny nannoplankton that form the Chalk thrived in an exceptionally warm global climate, a consequence of high levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide resulting from mid-Cretaceous volcanic activity. Tectonic influences are generally minor through the Cretaceous, although there is evidence that thrust faults in the Palaeozoic basement continued to respond to changes in the regional stress field and across parts of East Anglia there appears to be a connection between Cretaceous movement of these structures and the style of Chalk sedimentation.\n\nCenozoic: development of the London Basin\n\nBetween the end of the Cretaceous and the deposition of the oldest post-Cretaceous rocks preserved in East Anglia, there is a time gap represented by an erosion surface. This erosion event was triggered by a combination of sea-level fall and regional uplift, conventionally interpreted as a prolonged event spanning the latest Cretaceous and Early Palaeogene, but perhaps actually representing a briefer period within the Mid Paleocene. Although the locus of Cenozoic sedimentation appears to be to the south of the region, towards the London Basin, the original extent of deposition is uncertain, and may have been much greater across East Anglia and adjacent areas of eastern England; the region may have been contiguous with the wider North Sea Basin, with the preserved depositional pattern of Cenozoic rocks a product of later folding.\n\nThe oldest Palaeogene sediments in East Anglia, the Ormesby Clay, are deep-water clays, containing ash layers that correlate with the earliest pyroclastic activity in the British Palaeogene Igneous Province. South of a positive relief area in the south of the region, the Ipswich–Felixstowe High, there was a rapid transition into shallower water conditions with the sand-dominated deposition of the Thanet Sand Formation. Later marine transgression (Upnor Formation) and regression (Reading Formation and laterally equivalent Woolwich Formation) is typical of the eustatically* and tectonically influenced cycles in the Palaeogene succession, with environments ranging from shallow-marine shelf to coastal plain. These cycles were driven by patterns of sea-level change and pulses of tectonic uplift and subsidence. Volcanic ash layers in the sediments relate to volcanic activity associated with contemporaneous rifting in the North Atlantic, rifting that in turn is likely to have affected the subsidence pattern in the North Sea Basin and adjacent areas. In the Early Eocene (Figure 10e), more fully developed marine conditions led to the deposition of the Harwich and London Clay formations. The Harwich Formation contains ash beds reflecting a very explosive episode of volcanic activity in the area to the north and north-west of Scotland (Greenland–Faroes vicinity). The London Clay contains fossil evidence, such as crocodiles, fossil seeds and fruits, of a very warm climate — part of a global pattern of warm Eocene climate conditions known as the Eocene Thermal Maximum. This was preceded by a short-lived period of extreme temporary climate warming known as the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum, which may have been triggered by the release of greenhouse gases from volcanic or deep-ocean sources.\n\nThere is no record of Oligocene or Miocene deposits in East Anglia, and the whole of the East Anglian region is inferred to have come under the influence of terrestrial environments at this time. Sea levels fell in the Early Oligocene, perhaps by 70 m, as global climate dramatically cooled and ice sheets became established across eastern Antarctica. In the Miocene, much of southern Britain was influenced by compressive crustal stresses caused by the Alpine Orogeny resulting from the developing collision of Africa with Eurasia, although early phases of uplift probably began in the Eocene. The effects of these were to cause regional uplift and folding across southern Britain — the synclinal structure of the London Basin formed at this time, with its northern edge crossing the southern part of the East Anglia region. Marine conditions were re-established widely across East Anglia in the Pliocene, continuous with the Southern North Sea, and perhaps intermittently connected to the Atlantic based on affinities of the sandy, bioclastic sediments deposited in East Anglia (Coralline Crag) and Western Approaches at this time.\n\nChapter 2 Concealed geology\n\nN J P Smith and C W Thomas\n\nEast Anglia is perhaps most renowned for its Mesozoic and Cenozoic geology (Figure 11). However, buried at depth beneath these strata is a complex and thick sequence of rocks that records not only the birth and early geological history of what we now call East Anglia, but also provides important clues to the region’s subsequent geological and tectonic evolution. These concealed rocks range in age from the Early Palaeozoic through to the early part of the Mesozoic Era (541 to 201 Ma), however, much older basement rocks of lateNeoproterozoic age also probably occur but have yet to be reached by deep boreholes. In parts of southern Britain, direct geological evidence from this part of the stratigraphical column is limited and this is especially the case beneath East Anglia where these rocks typically occur at over 200 m depth. Our understanding of this important part of the East Anglian geological record is therefore based upon deep borehole records, seismic reflection data and airborne survey data (gravity and aeromagnetic data) and on comparison with adjacent areas where rocks of this age crop out. Within this chapter, the current knowledge and interpretation of the concealed bedrock geology beneath East Anglia are outlined.\n\nPrecambrian and Early Palaeozoic\n\nPrecambrian rocks\n\nDuring the late Neoproterozoic (about 730 to 541 Ma), the palaeogeography was dominated by a supercontinent, Gondwana, which was situated broadly over the South Pole (Chapter 1; Figure 12a). Located adjacent to the western margin of Gondwana were several microcontinents or terranes* including Laurentia, Siberia, Baltica and Avalonia which today fringe several of the continents bordering the North Atlantic region. Terms such as ‘microcontinent’ and ‘terrane’ do by their very nature conjure images of terrestrial landmasses. However within a tectonic context, they relate to buoyant fragments of crustal material which could form a part of a terrestrial landmass, but could equally form part of the floor of a marine basin. Rocks from these terranes are composed largely of calc-alkaline volcanic (e.g. andesite, dacite) and plutonic (e.g. diorite) igneous rocks that are interpreted to have formed as subduction-related volcanic arcs on or adjacent to the Gondwana continental margin (Figure 12b). Their geochemistry is typically rich in calcium-bearing ferromagnesian minerals (e.g. hornblende, augite) and feldspar which are associated with sedimentary rocks that were laid down contemporaneously within arc-related basins and then recycled magmatically via subduction and melting.\n\nMuch of England and Wales, including East Anglia, formed part of the Avalonia microcontinent (Avalonian Terrane) during the late Neoproterozoic. Published studies from elsewhere suggest that the origins of the Avalonian Terrane date back to at least 1.0 Ga, being formed by the amalgamation of recycled fragments of continental crust, oceanic crust and oceanic island arcs. One such crustal fragment is the Midlands Microcraton (or Platform) which underlies the English Midlands extending westwards into south Wales where it is bounded by the Welsh Borderland Fault Zone and to the south by the Variscan Orogenic Front. Outcrops of Avalonian rocks in England occur within the Charnwood Forest area of Leicestershire, near Nuneaton in Warwickshire, and within the Welsh Borders and Malvern Hills. Beneath East Anglia, no basement rocks of comparable age have yet been identified within deep boreholes but are believed to exist at depth due to their presence within adjacent wells located in the Southern North Sea (Well 53/16-1), Glinton and Orton in Cambridgeshire, and Oxendon Hall in Northamptonshire (Figure 13). These wells recovered felsic* ash-flow tuffs* with textures characteristic of ignimbrites* and have uranium-lead (U-Pb) radiometric ages of about 612 and 616 Ma. In the Mountsorrel area of Leicestershire, late Neoproterozoic basement rocks have also been inferred and appear to have been emplaced towards a linear belt of granodiorite intrusions that occur within the hanging wall of the younger Glinton Thrust.\n\nEarly Palaeozoic rocks\n\nDuring the Early Palaeozoic (541 to 419 Ma), the Avalonian Terrane drifted into more midlatitudinal positions within the southern hemisphere. This continental drift reflects the successive opening and closure of several ocean basins (e.g. the Iapetus and Tornquist oceans) and accompanying phases of volcanic arc activity, continental collision and uplift (orogeny) (Chapter 1). Central to our understanding of the palaeogeography and timing of major phases of tectonic plate rearrangement during the Early Palaeozoic are the preserved faunal assemblages. For example, throughout much of the Cambrian and Mid Ordovician, the isolation of the Avalonian Terrane by extensive deep ocean basins is indicated by the development of distinctive endemic faunas. By contrast, at other times, faunal assemblages from the Avalonian Terrane share characteristics with adjacent drowned continental margins and indicate episodes of ocean closure.\n\nRocks of inferred Cambrian age (Figure 3) have been recorded within a number of wells in the north of the region including around Wisbech and Spalding (Figure 13). They include gently metamorphosed sandstone (quartzite) and finer-grained mudstone (phyllite) that probably represent continental shelf to deeper marine facies. Rocks of Early Ordovician Tremadoc age (485.4 to 477.7 Ma) locally exceed several hundred metres thickness beneath the northern part of the Fen Basin (Figure 13, 14) and have been examined in detail within the Wyboston Borehole in Bedfordshire. They comprise moderately steeply dipping (15 to 40°) deep-marine black sandstone, siltstone and fossiliferous mudstone. The similarity of Avalonian and Gondwanan marine faunas from rocks of this age suggests the close proximity of the two terranes at this time (Figure 15a). In particular, the deep-water sandstone, which is believed to be a turbidite deposit, indicates the proximity of Avalonia to either a continental margin or volcanic island-arc complex.\n\nMid Ordovician rocks of Llanvirn age (467.3 to 458.4 Ma) have been identified onshore within the Huntingdon and Great Paxton boreholes and within offshore well 47/29A-1 located in The Wash (Figure 13). Marine faunas record a time when the Avalonian Terrane still formed part of a deep-marine basin but was isolated from large continental masses (Figure 15b). The Huntingdon Borehole contains a thick sequence of fossiliferous and bioturbated* siltstone and mudstone. Superimposed upon these sediments are small-scale faults and minor folding which probably relate to submarine gravity slumps and slides.\n\nDeeper-water slope facies are preserved within the Great Paxton Borehole. They include a locally overturned sequence of interbedded sandstone and fossiliferous (graptolites and trilobites) and bioturbated mudstone. Borehole and seismic data show that the sandstone exhibits graded bedding and well-developed channel structures, interpreted as being formed by turbidity currents. By contrast, beds that contain preserved faunas and bioturbation indicate episodes of well-oxygenated sea-bed conditions between turbidity events.\n\nLate Ordovician rocks, correlated with the Caradoc (458.4 to 450 Ma), have been proven within the North Creake Borehole situated to the south-east of Burnham Market (Figure 13). Here, the borehole penetrated recrystallised ash-flow tuff dated by U-Pb dating to 449 ± 13 Ma and is of similar age to other Caradocian calc-alkaline arc rocks recorded in boreholes across the East Midlands, Lincolnshire and northern England. Faunal assemblages from Late Ordovician rocks elsewhere in Wales indicate the close proximity of the Avalonian Terrane to Baltica signifying the closing of the Tornquist Ocean (Figure 15c).\n\nThe existence of Silurian strata from beneath the southern and eastern part of East Anglia is well documented in boreholes where they unconformably overlie older rocks (Figure 13, 14). This unconformity is believed to relate to uplift and erosion that occurred during and immediately after the closure of the Tornquist Ocean when the terranes of Avalonian and Baltica accreted (Figure 15d). Faunal evidence also indicates a close association with Laurentian faunas during the Mid Silurian and this signals the closing of the Iapetus Ocean between Baltica–Avalonia and Laurentia (Chapter 1). The Silurian basin beneath East Anglia probably deepened eastwards from a shallow margin located adjacent to the Midlands Microcraton. Key boreholes, including those at Saxthorpe, East Ruston, Weeley, Stowlangtoft, Sutton, Clare, Lakenheath and Soham, display a range of mudstone, sandstone and siltstone deposited in shelf environments. The precise ages of the strata remain somewhat tentative, however, biostratigraphical evidence indicates strata ranging in age from the Llandovery (443.8 to 433.4 Ma), Ludlow (427.4 to 423.6 Ma) and Pridoli (423.6 to 419.2 Ma).\n\nThe sedimentology of Silurian strata from these boreholes provides a valuable insight into the spatial and temporal distribution of shallow marine facies. They offer further constraint to the palaeogeography and environments of deposition. Four lithofacies have been recorded and these include (a) laminated mudstone facies deposited in a deep-water, anoxic environment devoid of benthic life; (b) graded mudstone facies produced by waning turbidity or storm currents, associated with variable water depths and oxygenation levels; (c) graded and hummocky cross-stratified sandstone units formed by turbidity and storm-driven currents; (d) ungraded fine sandstone deposited by high-energy (plane-bed) flows associated with turbidity currents. Collectively, these facies associations record basin infilling and shallowing through time and a progression from anoxic outer-shelf conditions (Llandovery and Wenlock) to more oxygenated conditions (Ludlow) and storm-dominated shelf environments during the Pridoli.\n\nPrecambrian and Early Palaeozoic deep structure\n\nThe Neoproterozoic rocks described within the previous section were formed during the closure of several ancient ocean basins and the accretion of successive oceanic island arcs and continents onto the Gondwana margin. The Avalonian Terrane was subsequently separated from Gondwana during the Early Palaeozoic by rifting and accreted firstly to Baltica, and then with Baltica to Laurentia. These tectonic events produced a complex concealed and still poorly understood geological structure which appears to have been partly reactivated during subsequent phases of tectonism and exerted a major control upon later styles and patterns of sedimentation. Within this section of the chapter we examine key components of the deep structure beneath East Anglia focusing largely upon observations and inferences that can be made from the airbourne aeromagnetic (Figure 16), gravity (Figure 17) and deep seismic datasets.\n\nThe aeromagnetic dataset (Figure 16) reveals a distinctive rectilinear pattern of anomalies (Anomalies A to F) that trend roughly north-west to south-east (Anomalies C to F) and a subordinate set trending west-north-west to east-south-east (e.g. Anomalies A, B). The dominant trend in the data is a continuation of the Furness–north Norfolk Magnetic Anomaly (FINMA) which extends from the Lake District, southwards through northern and eastern England, into north Norfolk and reflects a belt of more magnetic crust located at depth.\n\nBeneath East Anglia, this signal is interpreted as indicating the presence of linear belts of suprasubduction volcanic and igneous rocks that accumulated on and within the Precambrian and Early Palaeozoic basement. Deep boreholes that penetrate these anomalies have been drilled at Rempstone, Leicestershire (Anomaly C) and North Creake 1, north Norfolk (Anomaly D) (Figure 16). The first borehole at Rempstone proved the existence of granodiorite plutons that appear to be part of an intrusive complex that extend from Mountsorrel in Leicestershire eastwards to Huntingdon near Cambridge. Meanwhile the North Creake Borehole records a second belt of intrusive calc-alkaline igneous rocks of Caradoc (Late Ordovician) age that continue into southern Lincolnshire. Regional gravity data (Figure 17) also shows a similar arrangement of high density (green) anomalies which are probably controlled by faults that link with larger north-west- to south-east-trending structures. The age and precise origin of these features are speculative. However, the persistent structural trend which can be traced from East Anglia to northern England, coupled with evidence for Early Palaeozoic movement along some of these structures, suggests that they may be of Precambrian age with subsequent reactivation during the Acadian Orogeny. Lower-density basement rocks are also indicated by the blue areas within the airbourne gravity data\n\n(Figure 17) and could indicate the presence of plutonic igneous rocks beneath areas such as north Norfolk, The Wash and south-east Lincolnshire. An alternative explanation for the gravity low around Saxthorpe is the presence of lower-density sedimentary rocks in a small basin of post-Caradoc age. Overall, the gravity and magnetic data, combined with evidence from some deep boreholes, indicates that volcanic and plutonic igneous arc rocks of calc-alkaline composition, and where dated, of Caradoc age (about 458.4 to 450 Ma), occupy a significant volume within mid-crustal levels beneath East Anglia. These rocks are interpreted as having resulted from the subduction of oceanic crust beneath East Anglia as Avalonia and Baltica converged in the Late Ordovician, generating the heat to drive magmatism*.\n\nSeismic reflection data also offer clues to the deep structure within the rocks beneath East Anglia. Of particular significance is the existence of a south-west-dipping seismic reflector* imaged beneath the Dowsing–South Hewett Fault Zone located offshore within the Southern North Sea (Figure 18). This reflector has been interpreted to be the locus of the subduction zone that gave rise to the Ordovician igneous rocks described within the previous paragraph. Other thrusts have also been imaged at mid-crustal depths within the up-thrown block (hanging wall) of this presumed thrust and dip towards the north-east (Figure 18). These structures, which include the Glinton Thrust, are most likely to be back thrusts generated above the subduction zone, and partly displaced marginal Precambrian and Early Palaeozoic successions back onto the Avalonian margin.\n\nLate Palaeozoic\n\nDevonian rocks\n\nThe onset of the Devonian Period (Figure 5), marking the beginning of the Late Palaeozoic, coincides with the final closure of the Iapetus Ocean and the relatively gentle collision (called ‘soft docking’) of Baltica with Laurentia (Figure 15e). This resulted in a period of uplift and emergence known as the Acadian Orogeny, with largely continental conditions prevailing across much of southern Britain (Chapter 1). The rocks beneath East Anglia almost certainly bear this orogenic imprint, although no direct evidence has yet been found. Elsewhere in Britain, deformation and magmatism related to the Acadian Orogeny occurred between about 400 and 390 Ma, resulting in the development of extensive folding, cleavage and low-grade metamorphism of rocks in basins fringing the Midland Microcraton. An arc in the deformation around the apex of the relatively undeformed Midlands Microcraton suggested that this relatively buoyant and rigid crust forming the core of the Avalonian crust in central England, possibly acted as a tectonic indenter much like the Cenozoic collision of India into southern Eurasia to form the Himalayan mountains.\n\nThere are no known Early Devonian rocks beneath East Anglia although it is possible that they could be preserved locally in structural depressions. It is widely believed that most of the Early Devonian succession was probably eroded as a result of uplift and subaerial weathering. This is marked in the geological record by a distinctive unconformity commonly referred to as the Acadian Unconformity (Figure 13). Younger Devonian strata, of Mid and Late Devonian age, have been observed within the Soham and Wyboston boreholes and were probably deposited in postorogenic extensional basins or by northward transgression of the Rheic Ocean located to the south of the region at this time (Figure 14). A total of 114 m of fossiliferous terrestrial and marine Late Devonian rocks were recovered from the Wyboston Borehole and includes mudstones, grading upwards into siltstones, sandstones, conglomerates and mudstones. This thickness of strata is tentatively considered to have been deposited within an extensional basin which may equate to the gravity low at Little Chilsill, near Cambridge. This can be traced eastwards underneath the Fen Basin where it narrows, possibly as far west as Northampton and south-eastwards beneath Saffron Walden.\n\nCarboniferous rocks\n\nThroughout the Late Devonian and Carboniferous (Figure 5) periods, East Anglia formed part of the London–Brabant High, a ridge of elevated topography located along the eastern margins of the Laurentia continental landmass (Figure 15f). Laurentia straddled the equator at this time although southern Laurentia and what is now East Anglia was still situated in the southern hemisphere (Chapter 1). Britain was subjected to extensive rifting during this time interval with subduction to the south within the Rheic Ocean leading to the development of a series of backarc basins along the margins of the Midlands Microcraton. Rifting produced the distinctive ‘block and basin’ structure that is characteristic of the Carboniferous in Britain although the orientation of these blocks and basins appears to have been influenced by Late Precambrian and Early Palaeozoic structures. Within the region, sedimentation during the Carboniferous was largely restricted to the area now situated offshore from East Anglia, with the southern North Sea Basin forming an east-south-east extension of the Pennine Basin of northern England.\n\nDeep boreholes situated along the north Norfolk coast have confirmed the presence of Carboniferous strata of Tournaisian to Visean age (358.9 to 330.9 Ma) age. The East Ruston Borehole in eastern Norfolk, for example, yields a 114 m-thick sequence of Carboniferous Limestone Supergroup. It includes beds of limestone, dolomite, dolomitic limestone and shale which were deposited in shallow marine and episodically emergent conditions under a tropical climate. The Carboniferous Limestone Supergroup is, however, absent in the Sibsey Borehole situated to the north-west of The Wash, but thickens south-westwards so may be present to the south and west of Hunstanton. No Namurian age (330.9 to 316 Ma) strata have been recorded beneath East Anglia but they have been identified within offshore well 47/29A-1 situated within The Wash, where seismic reflection data shows that they, and the overlying Westphalian (A–C) units, thicken markedly offshore. Onshore boreholes along the north Norfolk coast, including the Somerton 1 Borehole, prove younger Westphalian rocks — probably equivalent to the Warwickshire Group — resting unconformably upon the older Carboniferous Limestone Supergroup deposits. The absence of older Westphalian and Namurian strata below this unconformity is comparable to the Symon Unconformity in the West Midlands–Welsh Borderland. This unconformity formed as the eroded margins of the London–Brabant High became buried during late Carboniferous thermal subsidence. It is also interesting to note that although of generally subdued topography, the shape of the East Anglia coastline, projecting into the North Sea, probably reflects closely the former northern margin of the London–Brabant High during the Carboniferous. To the south of this landmass lower Carboniferous sediments conformably overlie Devonian strata around Cambridge, but no late Carboniferous strata have been found hereabouts or within the foreland basins to the south.\n\nThe late Carboniferous and earliest Permian interval coincides with the final reamalgamation of the continental masses of Gondwana with Laurentia to form a new supercontinent called Pangaea. This continental collision produced an episode of uplift and mountain building referred to as the Variscan Orogeny, and evidence for this event can be seen extensively in rocks across modern-day North America and Europe. The main Variscan Front, which separates the main zone of mountain building (i.e. the fold belt) from the foreland area situated to the north, runs approximately east–west through South Wales, southern England and then north-west Europe. East Anglia lay in the foreland area located to the north of the Variscan Front. Crustal shortening caused uplift and folding of the Carboniferous basins along pre-existing fault structures — a process known as basin inversion. Uplift and folding was accompanied by widespread erosion which generated the Variscan Unconformity at the base of the Permian (Figure 19).\n\nPermian rocks\n\nDuring the Permian (Figure 5), the London–Brabant High continued to dominate the palaeotopography and East Anglia, with contiguous areas to the east and west, is interpreted to have been subaerially exposed land — probably a desert. No early Permian strata occur beneath East Anglia, and later Permian strata are mainly restricted to the area beneath the Fen Basin (Figure 14) and north-east Norfolk, extending offshore into the southern North Sea (Figure 19). The succession forms the western margins of the Permo-Triassic Southern North Sea (Southern Permian) Basin, associated with the rifting of the North Atlantic and continental fragmentation.\n\nEarly Mesozoic\n\nTriassic rocks\n\nThroughout the Triassic (Figure 5), most of East Anglia remained emergent (Chapter 1), though low-lying, forming part of the supercontinent of Pangaea. Sedimentation was restricted to the north-west of the region and neighbouring East Midlands overlapping southwards and onlapping the London–Brabant High. The Sherwood Sandstone Group is restricted to the northern part of the region but is well documented from the North and South Creake boreholes. The sedimentology of the deposit is highly variable in character with a basal sandstone unit — the Hewett Sandstone Member, overlain by clean sandstones, commonly interbedded with mudstone. Some boreholes, such as the East Ruston Borehole, show successions of thick mudstone units sandwiched between units of sandstone that are likely to correlate to the lower part of the Sherwood Sandstone Group. In contrast, other boreholes such as Hunstanton 1, proved the presence of a thick sandstone beneath the clean sandstones interbedded with mudstones, and only a thin mudstone unit overlying conglomeratic sandstone at the base. The thickness reaches 185 m at the coast and the isopachs follow approximately the smooth trend of the north Norfolk coast, before cutting obliquely across the east coast.\n\nIsopachs for the overlying Mercia Mudstone Group–Penarth Group reveal an east-south-east trend in the east, and a probable west-south-west trend in the west, progressively overlapping the Sherwood Sandstone Group southwards (Figure 19). Triassic strata are absent from the Lexham and Warboys boreholes limiting the southerly margin of Triassic subcrop, and numerous boreholes to the south also lack Triassic strata. Several boreholes located in a zone stretching from Ellingham in the north-east to Wyboston in the south-west, prove sandy and conglomeratic red beds beneath the Lias Group (Figure 14). These strata have generally been interpreted as Triassic when logged (assuming downhole conformity). However, an alternative interpretation is that these strata could be Late Devonian or early Carboniferous in age, although no palaeontological evidence is available to verify this possibility. Current evidence suggests an area centred between Lexham and Warboys, where Mercia Mudstone Group strata are absent.\n\nFollowing an earlier Mesozoic phase of extensional faulting that affected basin development in the Southern North Sea and Weald, East Anglia and adjacent regions experienced regional subsidence in response to thermal relaxation of the underlying crust.\n\nA change from an east–west strike in Permian and Triassic strata to a north-east–south-west strike in later Jurassic strata suggests the presence of a disconformity at the base of the Early Jurassic Lias Group (Figure 14). The following chapters give further details of the Lias Group stratigraphy (Chapter 3) and the younger bedrock successions that can be seen at outcrop within the region (Chapters 4 to 6).\n\nChapter 3 Jurassic: shallow seas and archipelagos\n\nA J M Barron\n\nGeological and palaeo-geographical setting\n\nThe break-up of the Pangaea supercontinent that commenced in the Triassic period continued into the Jurassic, and in north-west Europe formed a number of rifted basins, foreshadowing the opening of the North Atlantic. The development of these basins, coupled with global sea-level rise that began at the end of Triassic times led to the progressive extension of marine conditions across the British Isles, where generally shallow seas surrounded an archipelago of land areas with varying relief. This pattern persisted throughout the Jurassic Period (201.3 to 145.0 Ma). Moderate changes in sea level and elevation or subsidence in platform areas led to rapid fluctuations in coastlines and changes in depositional environments. One of the profound influences on these was the plume-related thermal doming centred in the North Sea, the flanks of which extended across much of Britain. Doming commenced during the Toarcian and although the centre continued to rise until the Callovian, differential subsidence of its flanks began during the early uplift stages (Aalenian) and its interaction with changing sea levels is widely seen in the patterns of deposition throughout the Mid Jurassic and into the Late Jurassic (Figure 20). During this time the British Isles lay between 30 and 40 degrees north of the equator and experienced a subtropical climate that was warm and humid with high levels of carbon dioxide and rainfall, leading to intense weathering and run-off in the emergent areas.\n\nEarly Jurassic (Lias Group)\n\nEast Anglia lay across the northern margin of the stable and long-lived London–Brabant High, which extended into Belgium. Its western part, the London Platform, was emergent for much of the period, having a dominant effect on sedimentation patterns. Much of the region south-east of a line from Cambridge to Thetford and Norwich remained emergent during the Jurassic, with no deposits of this age recorded in deep boreholes. In contrast, the adjacent East Midlands Shelf to the north-west, located on the distal southern flank of the North Sea Dome, underwent rather moderate but generally continuous subsidence, receiving terrigenous input from the surrounding land areas. Consequently the Jurassic succession across all but the extreme north-west of the region shows evidence of condensed deposition, sedimentation in nearshore environments and erosion of strata at many levels (Figure 20).\n\nWithin the East Anglia region, the Lias Group is present at rockhead only in a small area of north Bedfordshire, elsewhere being concealed beneath younger bedrock, and it attains its maximum thickness of about 250 m in the extreme north-west (Figure 21).Further north-west, beyond the East Anglia region, accumulation of the Lias Group on the East Midlands Shelf began in latest Triassic (Rhaetian) times, when the fossiliferous marine mudstone and limestone strata of the coeval Blue Lias and Scunthorpe Mudstone formations were deposited (Figure 20; 21). At this time East Anglia was largely emergent, but marine conditions later extended south-eastwards into the region, where the earliest Jurassic strata are Sinemurian (Figure 20). These oldest beds are progressively overstepped by younger Lias Group beds to the south-east, and there are many minor non-sequences within the succession. Coupled with subsequent erosion in late Toarcian times, this overstep has resulted in a pattern of south-east thinning in all the component formations of the group.\n\nThe oldest Lias Group strata seen in boreholes comprise grey variably calcareous mudstone with thin fine-grained and bioclastic limestone beds at several levels, totalling a maximum of about 200 m thick in the north-west. These are attributed to the Charmouth Mudstone Formation, as are the 40 and 50 m of grey fossiliferous mudstone and siltstone of Pliensbachian (Figure 20) age proved in the Soham, Lakenheath and Severals House boreholes near Ely. The 100 m or more of grey mudstone proved in north-east Norfolk is not confidently attributed, but most likely belongs to the Charmouth Mudstone and Whitby Mudstone formations. A minor marine regression in mid to late Pliensbachian times led to the accumulation of variably ferruginous, bioturbated micaceous siltstone with subordinate mudstone beds. This is termed the Dyrham Formation and attains a thickness of 5 m in Bedfordshire and near King’s Lynn. It probably passes northwards into mudstone in the extreme north-west of the region and its persistence east is uncertain, although it may be present in the subsurface near Downham Market. Continued shallowing and the establishment of anoxic conditions on the marine shelf, and intense weathering on land, resulted in the deposition of a condensed succession of ferru-ooidal* ironstone up to 3 m thick in the Tydd St Mary Borehole, comprising the Marlstone Rock Formation. It ranges from Pliensbachian to possibly earliest Toarcian in age, at which time global sea-level rise caused resumption of fully marine deposition of the Whitby Mudstone Formation. This is the oldest formation at rockhead in the region, seen near Podington [SP 93 63]. Basal fish- and ammonite-bearing mudstone and limestone beds are followed by a thick succession of poorly fossiliferous grey mudstone. Deposition was interrupted by late Toarcian uplift related to the North Sea thermal doming, which resulted in deep erosion of the Whitby Mudstone succession, such that an original thickness in East Anglia in excess of 60 m was reduced to 20 m or less.\n\nMid Jurassic (Inferior Oolite And Great Oolite Groups)\n\nIn early Aalenian times (Figure 20), a shallow north–south channel was established across the East Midlands Shelf, affecting the western margin of the region. Minor fluctuations in relative sea level through Aalenian, Bajocian and Bathonian (Figure 20) times resulted here in considerable changes in coastline position and environments. These ranged from freshwater through paralic* to shallow marine, and this depositional area received run-off from land areas to the north-west and south-east. Deep weathering on land generated dissolved iron compounds which were precipitated in shallow marine conditions that extended into the extreme west of our region, producing the sandy ferruginous ooidal limestone and mudstone of the Northampton Sand Formation (Inferior Oolite Group; Figure 22). The formation is a marginal facies of the ooidal ironstone beds of the East Midlands, displaying rootlet traces but lacking shells. The Northampton Sand occurs at outcrop near Farndish [SP 92 63] and at depth around Peterborough and Spalding, and reaches 5 m in thickness.\n\nMarine regression in the late Aalenian resulted in coastal, deltaic and nonmarine environments in which pale to dark grey and purplish sand and silt and black clay of the Grantham Formation (formerly the ‘Lower Estuarine Series’) was deposited over a slightly more extensive area. Some beds are well laminated, others unbedded, and slump and load structures are also seen. Up to about 5 m of strata are preserved in the region. The Grantham Formation is overlapped eastward by the Bajocian Lincolnshire Limestone Formation — the youngest unit of the Inferior Oolite Group — deposited in an expanded marine shelf on which carbonate grains including ooids, bioclasts*, peloids* and lime mud accumulated, along with lesser amounts of silicate grains. This was a high-energy environment, and erosion of the substrate, at least at first, reworked quartz sand from the Grantham Formation. Continuing strong current and tidal activity influenced the limestone facies and caused intraformational erosional breaks. Lower and Upper Lincolnshire Limestone members are recognised at outcrop in the East Midlands, separated by one of these breaks, and respectively characterised by predominance of calcilutite, peloidal packstone* and wackestone*, and cross-bedded bioclastic ooidal grainstone* lithologies. The Lincolnshire Limestone thins east from about 15 m at Peterborough, disappearing south of The Wash, but the relative extents of the members are unknown. It is absent in Bedfordshire.\n\nIn the latest Bajocian, despite global sea-level rise, doming-related uplift centred in the North Sea led to erosion of the surface of the Lincolnshire Limestone and formation of hollows holding freshwater lakes up to 1 km across in which dark grey mud and paler silt and sand with root traces accumulated. This is the Stamford Member, the lowest unit of the Rutland Formation (formerly ‘Upper Estuarine Series’), at the base of the Great Oolite Group. The member is about 4 to 6 m thick around Peterborough and in Bedfordshire, with an uncertain eastward extension at depth into Norfolk and Cambridgeshire, where it may be represented by 11 m of lignitic siltstone and sandstone in the Soham Borehole. Subsidence of the\n\nEast Midlands Shelf in Early Bathonian times was generally at a greater rate than eustatic sea-level fall and the overlying strata that form the remainder of the Great Oolite Group are intercalated shallow marine, brackish and nonmarine facies with many minor or local non-sequences. Nonetheless, deposition of the Great Oolite succession is inferred to have extended much further to the south-east across the London Platform than the Inferior Oolite.\n\nThe Great Oolite forms most of the stratal thickness contoured in Figure 22, although it is not well known from boreholes and the relative extents of the formations are very uncertain. Its outcrop is restricted to the valley of the Great Ouse in north Bedfordshire, where it attains its maximum thickness of over 30 m, and the Peterborough area, where it reaches about 21 m in the Crowland 1 Borehole.\n\nThe upper part of the Rutland Formation is characterised by a series of sedimentary rhythms each consisting, where complete, of a marine to brackish shelly mudstone and sandstone unit. It passes up into barren delta-top channel mudstone, overlain by greenish grey mudstone with plant debris and root traces, interpreted as a saltmarsh deposit. This ideal sequence may be truncated by erosion, or may include calcareous and shelly beds signifying transient marine incursions, including a shelly limestone unit, the Wellingborough Limestone Member, seen in Bedfordshire. From over 12 m thick near Bedford and about 10 m thick around Spalding and Peterborough, the Rutland Formation, including the Stamford Member, continues eastwards and is about 8 m thick at Tydd St Mary and 12.3 m at Soham.\n\nErosion of the upper surface of the Rutland Formation was followed by widespread establishment of sheltered fully marine conditions across the East Midlands Shelf in the Mid Bathonian. This is marked by a sharp upward facies change to the Blisworth Limestone Formation, comprising well-bedded peloidal packstone and wackestone with calcareous mudstone beds. In the west, the formation is 14 m thick around Bedford, 3 m thick at Peterborough, and reaches as far east as Tydd St Mary, where it is 2.1 m thick. It may extend into the Wells-next-the-Sea area, but is inferred to fail south-eastwards, probably passing into nearshore facies. In its marine lithologies, the formation has a prolifi but low diversity bivalve–brachiopod fauna including Praeexogyra hebridica (Forbes) (Plate 1i) and Kallirhynchia, indicating moderate current activity. The significant proportion of silicate silt and sand suggests proximity to land.\n\nA relative sea-level fall in Late Bathonian times reduced circulation on the East Midlands Shelf and led to deposition of the dark grey and brown mudstone beds of the Blisworth Clay Formation. Restricted marine shelly faunas occur in the lowest beds of the formation, and the presence of ferruginous nodule beds, rootlets and the bivalve Corbula at higher levels indicates very shallow water, possibly a brackish lagoon or saltmarsh. Marine influence increases south-westwards, with the shelly limestone facies around Bedford being more typical of the Forest Marble Formation of the Cotswolds. The Blisworth Clay is about 4 m thick around Peterborough, thinning eastwards to less than 2 m near King’s Lynn.\n\nA major marine transgression in the latest Bathonian established a shallow, fully marine carbonate shelf environment from Yorkshire to Dorset, across which the Cornbrash Formation was deposited. Lime sand accumulated, consisting mainly of bioclasts (shell and skeletal fragments) with common peloids, forming a stabilised substrate but subject to pervasive bioturbation. Fossils include an abundant infauna* and epifauna* of bivalves, gastropods, echinoids and rhynchonellid and terebratulid brachiopods, the last displaying vertical changes in assemblage that are useful for biozonation*. Periodic minor fluctuations in sea level, some due to local subsidence, led to formation of disconformities, which may be marked by thin lime mudstone layers and intraformational pebbles in the overlying limestone bed. One of the regressions is widespread and coincides with the Bathonian–Callovian stage boundary at about 166.1 Ma. This boundary separates distinctive brachiopod and ammonite faunas in the Cornbrash, and there is a tendency for beds of flaggy sandy limestone to be generally restricted to the upper part, allowing Lower and Upper Cornbrash members to be recognised (Figure 20). Although these subdivisions are not ubiquitous, nor easily distinguished except in exposures or where the fauna permits, both have been recognised around Peterborough where the Cornbrash forms wide plateau outcrops. Further east at depth, the Lower Cornbrash is impersistent. Despite the included hiatuses, the Cornbrash is remarkably constant in thickness throughout the English Midlands (2 to 4 m; locally less than 1 m), and this pattern is seen in East Anglia, where it is inferred to have had the greatest original extent of the Great Oolite formations.\n\nMid To Late Jurassic (Ancholme Group)\n\nThrough Callovian, Oxfordian, Kimmeridgian and into early Tithonian times (about 166 to 150 Ma), marine sedimentation continued across a deepening and widening East Midlands Shelf, albeit with a number of significant interruptions, and the coastline of the London Platform landmass retreated further south-east than at any time previously during the Jurassic (Figure 23). The mudstone-dominated succession deposited throughout this period is termed the Ancholme Group (Figure 20), and reaches 250 m in thickness (Figure 23). It is at rockhead throughout the western third of the region, almost entirely beneath Quaternary glacial, fluvial or marine deposits. Its five component formations are generally very fossiliferous, and include ammonites which are sufficiently numerous and rapidly evolving to permit subdivision of the chronostratigraphical stages into zones, and at some levels, subzones.\n\nIn the Early Callovian, the carbonate shelf of the Cornbrash was occluded by deposition of mud under anoxic bottom conditions. Above a thin transitional shell-rich unit, the overlying dark grey, bituminous, laminated silty mudstone beds belong to the Kellaways Clay Member, forming the lower part of the Kellaways Formation (Figure 24). The member contains few benthic fossils, and the moderately common ammonites, which indicate the Herveyi Zone, are generally preserved in pyrite. This mineral is also finely disseminated through the rock and concentrated in the fillings of burrows that are common at some levels. Phosphatic and ferruginous nodules are also present, and the member becomes increasingly silty and sandy upwards — a result of basinward redistribution of older coastal deposits. It passes up into the Kellaways Sand Member, characterised by fine-grained sandstone and sandy siltstone, interbedded with silty mudstone. The sandstone beds are generally poorly indurated, but locally they may be cemented into calcareous sandstone nodules or ‘doggers’. Common belemnites and ammonites confirm the open marine environment, and a more prolific and diverse fauna of gastropods and bivalves (notably Gryphaea dilobotes Duff; Plate 1e), and intense bioturbation at some levels, indicate improved bottom circulation. Fragments of wood are also common, suggesting proximity to land. The Kellaways Formation crops out along the flanks of the Great Ouse and Nene river valleys, is at rockhead beneath Quaternary deposits through Peterborough and Bedford, and is commonly exposed in sumps and trenches in the floors of the nearby Oxford Clay brick pits. Ranges of thicknesses given separately for the Kellaways Clay and Kellaways Sand members are misleading due to the difficulties of placing the boundary consistently in borehole logs; modal thicknesses for the members in the Peterborough area are 2.5 m and 3.0 m respectively. The formation as a whole is 5 to 7 m thick in the west (Spalding to Bedford), thinning east to 3 to 5.5 m at King’s Lynn, and about 1 m at Ely. The location and nature of its south-eastward pinch-out is uncertain, and it is possible that the formation may extend furthest of all the Ancholme Group units.\n\nThe top of the Kellaways Formation is taken at the top of the highest bed of sandstone or sandy mudstone and is sharp and conformable. It is overlain by the Oxford Clay Formation (Figure 24), which forms an outcrop or subcrop about 20 km wide across the west of the region. The formation is dominated by grey silicate mudstone deposited in moderately deep marine conditions. In the west it ranges from 63 to more than 70 m thick around Spalding and Peterborough, and a similar thickness occurs at Bedford (65 to 70 m), with a slight thinning (to about 60 m) between these sites possibly reflecting a closer proximity to the London Platform. The influence of this structural feature is inferred south-eastwards at depth, where the Oxford Clay reduces to about 40 m thick in eastern Cambridgeshire and western Norfolk, and detailed logs of boreholes at Soham and Tydd St Mary indicate a condensed succession. The formation is very fossiliferous throughout, the invertebrate fauna including bivalves, gastropods, brachiopods, belemnites, worm tubes, solitary corals and ammonites (Plate 1a to h). Based on a combination of lithological and faunal characteristics, a threefold subdivision of the formation is recognised, comprising the Peterborough, Stewartby, and Weymouth members (formerly the Lower, Middle and Upper Oxford Clay, respectively).\n\nThe Peterborough Member is dark brownish grey fissile organic-rich mudstone with dense spreads of compressed ammonites beautifully preserved in iridescent aragonite as ‘plasters’ on bedding planes, alternating with pale to mid grey blocky and finely bioturbated mudstone. Units of bioturbated mudstone increase in proportion upwards, with the lithologies arranged in rhythmic successions that commonly include a shell bed at the top in which the bivalve and ammonite fossils are typically uncrushed and pyritised. The distinctive worm tube Genicularia vertebralis (J de C Sowerby) (Plate 1g) ranges from near the base of the member up to the lower beds of the Stewartby Member, and together with the robust belemnite guards, are found in soils covering the weathered outcrop. The upper boundary of the member is defined somewhat arbitrarily at the top of the highest bed of organic-rich mudstone. Based on this, its thickness is 23 m at Bedford, 16.6 m at Peterborough, 13.9 m near King’s Lynn, and 17.9 m at Soham, with a general eastward-thinning trend. Organic-rich mudstones in the Peterborough Member reflect the primary preservation of organic material under anoxic sea-bed conditions, and its later conversion into a mixture of organic compounds (generally referred to as kerogen) through the process of burial diagenesis*. The presence of these units has greatly favoured the Peterborough Member for brickmaking using the ‘Fletton’ process, developed at the brickworks at Old Fletton, south of Peterborough (see Chapter 14). Over the last 100 years, practically the full thickness of the member has been worked for brick clay around the city in over a dozen large opencast pits, generally 15 to 20 m deep (Figure 23) which are designated its type locality, and in another ten similar pits at Stewartby, in the Marston Vale of Bedfordshire. At least two levels in the member show the development of more calcareous beds: a persistent bed of ammonitiferous septarian* limestone nodules about 0.5 m above the base usually forms the working floor of the pits.\n\nAbout 10 m above this, a thin but more continuous muddy limestone with an overlying highly fossiliferous mudstone bed forms the persistent marker of the Acutistriatum–Comptoni Bed (Figure 24). The advancing quarry faces have provided unrivalled access to the unweathered mudstone and its rich fauna. This encouraged much careful and diligent collecting, notably by Roland Brinkmann, who at Peterborough in the 1920s undertook an exceptionally detailed study of the faunal succession of the ammonite genus Kosmoceras (Callomon, 1968). As well as the invertebrates, the Peterborough brick pits are famous for their fossils of large marine vertebrates (Figure 25).\n\nThe lower part of the overlying Stewartby Member is exposed in the brick pits at Whittlesey, east of Peterborough, and the uppermost beds at Stewartby, its type section, but the unit’s outcrop is otherwise largely concealed by superficial deposits. The pale to mid grey silty mudstone beds of the member are moderately calcareous, nonbituminous and much less fossiliferous than the Peterborough Member. On their own they are unsuited for Fletton brickmaking unless mixed with the organic-rich mudstone. At Bedford the member is 22 m thick; its thickness is 20.6 m east of Peterborough, 22.9 m near King’s Lynn, and 9.1 m at Soham. The fauna-bearing horizons include beds of intact and robust Gryphaea valves (Plate 1d) preserved in calcite, which survive in the soil; units rich in the fragile bivalve Bositra buchii (Roemer) (Plate 1h); and a few beds with uncrushed pyritised ammonites, amongst which kosmoceratids dominate (Callomon, 1968). There are scattered bivalves and belemnites throughout. The fauna and facies indicate an environment with generally improved bottom-water circulation. The lower part of the member is rather monotonous lithologically, but higher up some beds are sufficiently calcareous to be regarded as muddy limestone. The uppermost of these, the Lamberti Limestone, is very shelly, with pyrite-coated bivalves, gastropods and ammonites including the zonal indicator Quenstedtoceras lamberti (Plate 1c) after which it is named. The top of this limestone marks the top of the Stewartby Member and the Callovian–Oxfordian stage boundary, and hence the top of the Mid Jurassic epoch (see Figure 20).\n\nLithologically the Weymouth Member bears a strong resemblance to the Stewartby Member. The bulk of it is composed of pale grey, blocky-weathering, calcareous mudstone with a shelly fauna preserved in pyrite and calcite. However, subordinate interbedded darker carbonaceous mudstone beds resting on the burrowed tops of the pale mudstone units indicate renewed rhythmicity. The fauna is sparser and ammonites are now dominated by cardioceratids. The member is very poorly exposed in the region, although it was temporarily fully exposed at Millbrook, Bedfordshire, where it proved to be 21.3 m thick. The upper 25 m were formerly seen in the face of the disused Warboys brick pit [TL 308 818], near Ramsey. Together with data from the nearby BGS Warboys Borehole a total thickness for the Weymouth Member of about 30 m can be inferred here. General eastward thinning is caused by condensed sedimentation and widespread erosion of the upper beds beneath an Early to Mid Oxfordian disconformity developed in response to marine regression. The member is 26 m thick east of Peterborough, 19.6 m thick near King’s Lynn and 14.5 m thick at Soham.\n\nThrough most of the Oxfordian (see Figure 20) in southern England and Yorkshire, medium- to coarse-grained siliciclastic and carbonate sedimentation took place in shallow to very shallow marine conditions, depositing the Corallian Group. However, in eastern England basin inversion re-established somewhat deeper water adjacent to land on the London Platform, and here silicate and carbonate mud and silt accumulated to form the West Walton Formation (Figure 24). The beds are arranged in cycles of darker grey carbonaceous silty mudstone and paler grey calcareous mudstone with burrowed horizons indicating sedimentation pauses. Layers of muddy fine-grained limestone concretions have developed at some levels and are more numerous in the more proximal southern part of the region. Following research into the bedrock for a proposed Wash Water Storage Scheme, the succession in the type section West Walton Highway Borehole [TF 4913 1316] was divided into sixteen beds on the basis of lithology and fauna, and a number of these have proved to be widely identifiable, as far away as Bedfordshire. The fossil content is similar to that of the Weymouth Member, dominated by cardioceratid ammonites, bivalves, serpulids and foraminifera and a variety of other invertebrates and trace fossils, with plant debris abundant in some beds. The more resistant calcitic shells of the bivalves Lopha, Nanogyra and Gryphaea dilatata (Plate 1b) may be found in the soil on the formation’s outcrop, although across most of the region it is largely concealed beneath Quaternary deposits. The formation thins south-eastwards across the region, from about 10 to 15 m in the Fenland, to less than 10 m in southern Cambridgeshire. Here successions typically of alternating silty limestone and calcareous mudstone with an abundant bivalve fauna are fairly widely developed, occupying all or part of the interval, and are interpreted as nearshore, probably back-reef facies. Variability of the faunal assemblage (in places including serpulids and coral debris) and early uncertainty about the stratigraphical level and lateral continuity of units, led to several local names being applied to variants of the interbedded limestone and mudstone succession, including St Ives Rock and Gamlingay Rock. More recently most of these have been incorporated into the Elsworth Rock Member, which overlies dark grey mudstone with nodular limestone of the Lower Elsworth Member. An unusual development of over 13 m of coralliferous limestone and shelly lime-mudstone at Upware, 15 km north-east of Cambridge, underlies a low ridge 5 km long and up to 1.5 km wide. There, the Dimmock’s Cote Marl Member and Upware Limestone Member are distinguished above the Lower Elsworth Member (Figure 24). The succession is interpreted as forming on a carbonate ramp building northwards, with conditions permitting the development at times of ooid shoals and coral reefs, in both very shallow and deeper water, with colonisation by a rich fauna that, as well as various corals, includes ammonites, echinoids, crinoids, sponges, annelids, rare brachiopods, and a great diversity of bivalves. The preserved area may be similar to the original extent.\n\nGradual deepening of the sea and south-eastward retreat of the coastline in the late Mid Oxfordian (about 160 Ma) led to the deposition of the Ampthill Clay Formation (Figure 24). Its base is marked by a change up into mudstone that is darker grey, less silty and calcareous and richer in ammonite fossils than the West Walton Formation. The boundary is generally conformable although at Upware higher beds of the Ampthill Clay lap onto the flanks of the mound of the Upware Limestone Member. Across most of the west of the region the formation is consistently between 50 and 55 m thick, showing slight thinning to the south-east and significant reduction in the Ely–Cambridge area (20 to 30 m) due mainly to attenuation in the upper part. Its persistence at depth is uncertain; it extends into north-west Norfolk but is overstepped by Early Cretaceous strata south-eastwards. The Ampthill Clay is absent beneath the Cretaceous Woburn Sands Formation at outcrop in parts of Bedfordshire, although it was formerly well exposed in the nearby Ampthill railway cutting that forms its type section, with 12.6 m later proved in the BGS Ampthill Borehole [TL 0244 3804].\n\nStudy of boreholes for The Wash Water Storage Scheme enabled the Ampthill Clay succession to be subdivided into forty-two beds. On the basis of gross lithology the study grouped these into a lower part of alternating slightly silty dark grey mudstone and pale grey calcareous mudstone and a middle part of smooth-textured mudstone. The upper part is characterised by calcareous and silty mudstone beds with several erosion surfaces capped by oyster encrustations and overlain by mudstone with phosphatic pebbles. Disseminated pyrite and layers of cementstone nodules are present as are rare thin beds of bituminous mudstone and of muddy ironstone. The fossil fauna content is exclusively marine with common ammonites dominated by perisphinctid and cardioceratid forms. Bivalves and foraminifera are also abundant, although their low diversity at some levels implies periodically restricted water circulation, and plant fragments, echinoderms, crustaceans and gastropods are also recorded. The soil on the outcrop is heavy grey-"
