Look around and you‘ll find companies of Cold drinks, Wafer chips, Juice, restaurant chains to be among biggest ones. Italian pasta and pizza is now consumed in almost all countries, so are the burgers and sandwiches. Sugar free products, cornflakes, oats, ketchups etc. are among most demanded consumer goods. Currently only 2 % of India‘s vegetable and fruits production is processed. In comparison USA and China processes their 90% and 40% produce. Other developing countries, such as Thailand, Philippines, and Brazil are processing as high as 30, 78 and 70% of their produce. India‘s food processing sector ranks fifth in the world in exports, production and consumption. Importance of this sector is significant and it deserves a priority treatment by government. Accordingly sector has been made part of ambitious ‗Make in India‘ initiative. Food processing is also significantly impacted by multiple external factors, including economic trends, climate change, and demographic shifts, emerging power markets, new trade partnerships and world population growth predictions. Today‘s food supply chain is more globalised, longer and far more complex than ever before. With growing imports and exports, processed foods are dependent on longer supply chains which pose a great challenge to assuring food safety.\n\n2. 2 1.2 INDIAN SCENARIO Introduction The Indian food industry is poised for huge growth, increasing its contribution to world food trade every year. In India, the food sector has emerged as a high- growth and high-profit sector due to its immense potential for value addition, particularly within the food processing industry. Accounting for about 32 per cent of the country‘s total food market, The Government of India has been instrumental in the growth and development of the food processing industry. The government through the Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) is making all efforts to encourage investments in the business. It has approved proposals for joint ventures (JV), foreign collaborations, industrial licenses, and 100 per cent export oriented units. Market Size The Indian food and grocery market is the world‘s sixth largest, with retail contributing 70 per cent of the sales. The Indian food processing industry accounts for 32 per cent of the country‘s total food market, one of the largest industries in India and is ranked fifth in terms of production, consumption, export and expected growth. It contributes around 8.80 and 8.39 per cent of Gross Value Added (GVA) in Manufacturing and Agriculture respectively, 13 per cent of India‘s exports and six per cent of total industrial investment. The Indian gourmet food market is currently valued at US$ 1.3 billion and is growing at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 20 per cent. India's organic food market is expected to increase by three times by 2020. The online food ordering business in India is in its nascent stage, but witnessing exponential growth. With online food delivery players like FoodPanda, Zomato, TinyOwl and Swiggy building scale through partnerships, the organized food business has a huge potential and a promising future. The online food delivery industry grew at 150 per cent year-on-year with an estimated Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) of US$ 300 million in 2016.\n\n3. 3 Going forward, the adoption of food safety and quality assurance mechanisms such as Total Quality Management (TQM) including ISO 9000, ISO 22000, Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP), Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and Good Hygienic Practices (GHP) by the food processing industry offers several Investments According to the data provided by the Department of Industrial Policies and Promotion (DIPP), the food processing sector in India has received around US$ 7.54 billion worth of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) during the period April 2000- March 2017. The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) estimates that the food processing sectors have the potential to attract as much as US$ 33 billion of investment over the next 10 years and also to generate employment of nine million person-days. Road Ahead Benefits. It would enable adherence to stringent quality and hygiene norms and thereby protect consumer health, prepare the industry to face global competition, enhance product acceptance by overseas buyers and keep the industry technologically abreast of international best practices. 1.3 KEY PLAYERS IN THE INDUSTRY Nestle Nestlé India manufactures products of truly international quality under internationally famous brand names such as Nescafé, Maggi, Milkybar, Kit Kat, Bar-One, Milkmaid and Nestea; and in recent years the company has also introduced products of daily consumption and use such as Nestlé Milk, Nestlé Slim Milk, Nestlé Dahi and Nestlé Jeera Raita.\n\n4. 4 Parle Agro Parle became popular with the release of its products such as Frooti and Parle-G. Parle Agro, today, is a Rs 2,200 Crore (US$ 364.93 million) organisation. They are known as much for their diversification into the foods sector as for their leadership the beverages sector. Parle operates under four business verticals: Beverages (fruit drinks, nectars, sparkling drinks and carbonated soft drink), Packaged Drinking Water, Foods, and pet preforms. Each of these verticals operates as independent entities. In the recent past, Parle has aggressively grown their infrastructure to 76 manufacturing facilities, both in India and overseas, and has developed a widespread network of 3,500 distributors that cater to more than 600,000 outlets in the country. It also has a strong presence in about 44 countries. Amul Amul is an Indian dairy cooperative, based at Anand in the state of Gujarat. Founded in 1946, the brand is today managed by the Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd (GCMMF) which is jointly owned by about 3 million milk producers in the state. Amul the co-operative was formed as a response to the exploitation of marginal milk producers by agents and traders of the existing dairy in the state. The co- operative has gone from strength to strength, on the back of inspired leadership of Tribhuvandas Patel, the founder Chairman and the Dr Verghese Kurien, who was entrusted the task of running the dairy from 1950.

Compliance is of utmost importance. Globally, the fast food brands have to comply with these requirements. There are regulations related to wages, hygiene and food quality that need to be complied with. The minimum wage standards can differ from country to country. In countries where wage rates are high, the labor costs are high. Apart from it, packaging regulations have also changed. Governments can also press the fast food chains to include healthier items on their menus. These are the most important political factors that affect the fast food industry. After all, it is the attitude of the governments towards the businesses that affects their performance. (Economic): The recession influenced the fast food industry to some extent. However, since it passed, spending per consumer has increased. Most of the restaurants have included cheaper options in their menus and improved customer service. Customer service is an important area as brands struggled during the recession to retain customers. A number of changes including increased health consciousness affected fast food sales. Delicious food was insufficient to attract the customers. So, brands supplemented it with increased convenience and low costs to encourage customers. Overall, economic factors are a very important influence on the fast food industry. The industry has showed excellent ability to adapt in the face of the changing trends. To better adjust to recession and low economic activity, brands included low priced items. They added to the variety of products on the menu. However, the size of individual spending on fast food has always depended on the economic conditions in specific markets. In US alone, more than 200,000\n\n6. 6 restaurants feed more than 50 million people daily. With economic activity surging globally, the spending on fast food could increase further in future. (Social): Health and lifestyle trends also influence the fast food industry. Health awareness has affected the entire food industry. It includes not just fast food, but snacks and beverages and all other foods. People now think before they eat. Consumers‘ changed attitude pressed the restaurant brands to include low calorie options. The social perception of health has changed vastly. Media has played its own important role in creating this perception. The fast food industry has faced heavy criticism for targeting young children. Moreover, the attack on junk food led to people adopting low calorie foods. Such changing social trends impact the sales of the entire industry. The industry was held liable for the increasing childhood obesity. As a result, it had to adopt measures like showing the nutritional content on the label and reduce calories in the items. Cultural factors might also play an important role since some cultures do not encourage the consumption of fast food. Still, most cultures have adopted it with changes to suit the local preference. (Technological): Technological factors have been an important influence on the fast food industry. This sector does not depend only on the attractiveness of its menu and the food quality. Customer service and convenience are also major factors affecting sales. Technological factors have already brought huge changes to the way brands have served and engaged their customers. They also affect marketing and advertising of the brands. Social media and online ordering have changed the style of customer service. Social media channels became the most important venue for engaging customers. The use of digital displays and kiosks affected ordering and the costs of labor. Technology overall has proved to be something indispensable. It has\n\n7. 7 helped brands serve customers through innovative channels and in innovative ways. Fast food brands have become innovative in other areas too. They engage their customers on social media and collect feedback through several channels. Competition in the industry is heavy. This is also a reason that technology has become important for fast food brands.\n\n8. 8 CHAPTER 2 COMPANY PROFILE 2.1 Background, History, Products and Markets Britannia Industries Limited is an Indian food-products corporation based in Bangalore, India.

Britannia has been around 120 years in the industry 2. Britannia is one of India‘s most trusted brand with strong brand recall 3. Wide range of bakery products like biscuits, rusks, cakes and dairy products like milk, butter, cheese, etc. 4. Strong distribution network ensuring proper availability of the products even in the remotest of areas 5. Britannia has a major share in biscuits industry 6. Marketing and advertising efficiency 7. Innovative products for health conscious people like oats and porridge, Britannia Nutri Choice biscuits for diabetes patients, Vita Marie Gold, etc. 8. Strong presence in rural markets 9. Products for all food and snacks segments is a big boon for Britannia\n\n15. 15 WEAKNESS 1. Lower market share for Britannia in dairy segment 2. Similar products produced by many companies means high brand switching 3. Over dependency on the biscuit business: Britannia‘s 75% revenue comes from biscuit business. Although they are market leader in the same but over dependency on the same may affect their long term existence in the business. OPPORTUNITIES 1 .Increase in purchasing power of people in India 2.Increase its share in the dairy industry 3.Product line extension can benefit Britannia as the company has loyal customers 4. Expansion in other countries THREATS 1.Lower price offering competitors can affect Britannia's market share 2.Local dairies and bakeries can cause business losses 3.Inflation can cause fall in sales and revenue 4.Rise in cost of raw materials\n\n16. 16 CHAPTER 3 ORGANIZATION DESIGN 3.1 Organization Chart Chart: 3.1 Source: www.unsoyfood.com 3.2 CRITICAL REVIEW OF THE ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE The advantages of this type of structure are the following:  It provides more focus and flexibility on each division's core competency.\n\n17. 17  It allows the divisions to focus on producing specialized products while also using knowledge gained from related divisions.  It allows for more coordination than the functional structure.  Decision-making authority pushed to lower levels of the organization enables faster, customized decisions. 3.3 McKinsey’s 7S Model In McKinsey model, the seven areas of organization are divided into the ‗soft‘ and ‗hard‘ areas. Strategy, structure and systems are hard elements that are much easier to identify and manage when compared to soft elements. On the other hand, soft areas, although harder to manage, are the foundation of the organization and are more likely to create the sustained competitive advantage. The Hard S’s: Strategy: The direction and scope of Britannia company over the long run. Structure: Britannia‘s departments, reporting lines, areas of expertise and responsibility and how they inter-relate to each other. Systems are the processes and procedures of the Britannia company, which reveal business‘ daily activities and how decisions are made. Systems are the area of the firm that determines how business is done and it should be the main focus for managers during organizational change. The Soft S’s: Skills are the abilities that Britannia‘s employees perform very well. They also include capabilities and competences. During organizational change, the question often arises of what skills the company will really need to reinforce its new strategy or new structure.\n\n18. 18 Staff element is concerned with what type and how many employees Britannia needs and how they will be recruited, trained, motivated and rewarded. Style represents the way the company is managed by top-level managers, how they interact, what actions do they take and their symbolic value. In other words, it is the management style of company‘s leaders. Shared Values are the norms and standards that guide employee behavior and company actions and thus, are the foundation of the Britannia company.\n\n19. 19 CHAPTER 4 BUSINESS MODEL OF BRITANNIA 4.1 Business Model Overview The decision to focus on direct distribution came soon after Varun Berry took over as the company‘s managing director in March 2014. At that time, Britannia used to serve only 6.5 lakh retail outlets directly. In comparison, Fritolay — a brand marketed by PepsiCo where Berry spent Britannia Industries Ltd is adapting the ―leanest possible‖ distribution model to directly ―tailor-serve retail outlets‖ across the country in less than a day as part of its plan to multiply sales and expand retail reach, said a senior executive. Currently, the process takes between one and three weeks. In the new distribution model, the Kolkata-headquartered biscuit maker plans to operate with a ―zero-day inventory‖ by ―reducing distance between its distribution centres and retail stores‖ that the company reaches directly. ―Direct distribution results in much better offtake of brands. We have seen two to three times higher brand offtake (sales) after we started serving a particular retail outlet directly,‖ said Gunjan Shah, vice president (sales), Britannia Industries. The aim, he added, is to go as deep possible ensuring it makes ―commercial sense‖. But how far can Britannia go? ―In some areas, we can go up to the level of a store that sells Britannia products worth Rs1,000 at least,‖ said Shah. That‘s just 100 packets of biscuits priced Rs10 each—Britannia‘s largest selling pack size in non-metro markets. almost two decades — had a direct reach of 1.1 million outlets despite being one- fourth of Britannia‘s size. ―From now on, every year we will add 2-3 lakh outlets to our direct network,‖ Shah said. At present, the company directly reaches to 1.7 million retails stores of\n\n20. 20 the 4.8 million outlets where Britannia products are sold. There are about 11 million retail outlets in India, of which around 8 million sell biscuits. In the new direct distribution model, the entire supply chain is controlled by Britannia. Every day, around 20,000 people who are on Britannia‘s direct payroll, visit retail stores, analyse local demands, suggest required tweaks in product placements based on the company‘s in-house analytics and take orders on their mobile phones through an app. The orders are then delivered directly by Britannia from the nearest distribution centre within a day. Traditionally, Britannia stocks products at its distribution centres. Products first go to its exclusive wholesale dealers, then distributors and direct retailers. The entire process takes anything from one week to three weeks, depending on the distance between the retail outlet and the factory. Britannia wants to reduce this to less than a day. While the focus on direct distribution was initiated in 2014 and increased reach, the new form of direct distribution is fairly new. In the last couple of years, Britannia tested the model for commercial viability in different pockets across 10 cities, starting with Mumbai. ―The new system is mapped real-time. It also reduces operational cost for dealers and distributors as they would not need to stock products,‖ added Shah. At present, Britannia has more than 800 vendors, 70 factories, 50 depots, 300 stock-keeping units and 3500 wholesalers. ―The role of dealers and distributors is changing first. We need them for local knowledge, logistics and credit collection. Plus, they would take our products to geographies where Britannia can‘t reach direct in a commercially viable manner. This would further expand reach,‖ added Shah. Britannia is not alone in implementing the new distribution model. Kolkata-based cigarette-to-biscuit maker ITC Ltd, which reaches about 2 million retail stores directly, has been working on a similar ‗factory-to-retail in a day‘ model for the last\n\n21. 21 few years, Mint reported on 10 June 2015. Britannia‘s rival Parle Products, the maker of Parle G biscuits, has the largest retail reach. According to a McKinsey and Co. report on the future of retail supply chains, companies can reduce costs by about 20% at the distribution centre level, while optimal deployment of inventory can reduce working capital by about 10%. To move to a ―zero-day inventory‖ operational model, Britannia has been increasing its distribution centres aiming to reduce distance between them and retail outlets. ―We now have around 14,000 distribution points, 4 times higher than what it was in 2013,‖ he added. ―Britannia has been in revamp mode for the past couple of years backed by change in distribution strategy. The focus on direct distribution is the right thing that the company has done. It would help accelerate revenue, increase market share, and improve cost efficiency in the long term. But direct distribution would not make commercial sense in remote areas,‖ said Sachin Bobade, an analyst with Dolat Capital Market. For Rs 8,684-crore Britannia Industries, the theme is ―pretty clear‖: ―Reduce distance to the market‖, Berry told investors in the company‘s last earnings call on 14 February 4.2 MARKETING FUNCTION  Defining and managing your brand. This involves defining who you are, what you stand for, what you say about yourself, what you do and how your company acts. This, in turn, defines the experience you want your customers and partners to have when they interact with you.  Conducting campaign management for marketing initiatives. Marketing proactively identifies the products and services to focus on over the course of your sales cycle, and then produces materials and communications that get the word out.\n\n22. 22  Producing marketing and promotional materials. Your marketing department should create the materials that describe and promote your core products and/or services. They should be kept up-to-date as those products and services evolve.  Creating content providing search engine optimization for your website. Your website is often the first (and possibly the only) place people go for information about you. Your marketing department will be responsible for keeping Web content current, while also working to ensure your site comes up quickly when someone searches for your type of business.  Monitoring and managing social media. Marketing should contribute to, manage and maintain your social media pages. It should also manage accounts and carefully watch what‘s being posted about you online.  Producing internal communications. Your employees need to understand your company, its values, its goals and its priorities. Marketing is often responsible for employee communications through a newsletter and/or intranet.  Serving as media liaison. When your company is cited in the media, a member of the marketing department often acts as spokesperson for your company, or guides executives in how to respond to media queries.  Conducting customer and market research. Research helps you define target markets and opportunities and helps you understand how your products and services are perceived.  Overseeing outside vendors and agencies. Marketing is typically responsible for selecting and managing the agencies and vendors who produce marketing materials and or/provide marketing support. These may include ad agencies, print vendors, PR agencies or specialists, Web providers, etc. 4.3 OPERATIONS AND QUALITY FUNCTIOS 1. Finance Finance plays a chief role in operations management. It is essential to ensure that the organization‘s finance has been utilized properly to carry out major functions such as the creation of goods or services so that the customer‘s needs could be satisfied.\n\n23. 23 2. Operation organizing, directing and controlling all the activities of an organisation which helps in converting the raw materials and human efforts into valuable goods and services for satisfying customer. This function in operation management is mainly concerned with planning, needs. 3. Strategy Strategy in operation management refers to planning tactics that could help them to optimise the resources and have a competitive edge over others. Business strategies imply to supply chain configuration, sales, capacity to hold money, optimum utilisation of human resources and many more. production of the final product and then their selling to the customers which will satisfy their needs and wants. 4. Design of the product Incorporating innovative technologies play a crucial role in the selling of a product. Thus it is the duty of operations manager to ensure that the product is designed catering to the market trends and needs of the customers. The modern- day customers are more concerned about the quality of the product than its quantity. So, the operation managers focus on producing top-notch quality products. 5. Forecasting Forecasting refers to the process of making an estimation regarding certain events that might occur in the future. In operation management, forecasting refers to the estimation of customer‘s demand so that production can be done accordingly. Through this, the manager gets to know what to produce, when to produce and how to produce in accordance with the customer‘s needs.\n\n24. 24 6. Supply Chain Configuration The main motive of Supply Chain Configuration is to ensure effective management, monitoring and controlling of all the main activities that are held in a firm. The supply chain configuration starts from the supply of the raw materials and continues till the 7. Managing the Quality Quality management plays an imperative role in selling a product. The operation managers allocate the task of quality management to a team and then supervise their task. The managers identify project defects and rectify them to ensure quality. For this, certain systems are used that measure and maintain the quality of the product. 4.4 FINANCE FUNCTIONS 1. Bookkeeping and Payables/Receivables Bookkeeping is the most basic financial activity in a company. Before a business owner ever considers hiring a CFO, they bring in a bookkeeper, who tracks all of the transactions in the organization, covering both sales and expenses. As the organization grows, they might hire more specialized payables and receivables clerks, to take over functions such as corresponding with vendors and suppliers, above and beyond recording transactions. 2. Financial Reporting and Control Financial Reporting and Control is the function that takes raw accounting entries and transforms them into usable and comparable financial statements. Requiring far more judgment than the bookkeeper‘s role, this function involves everything from ruling on how to implement accounting principles to designing financial processes of the organization, selecting accounting systems, liaising with\n\n25. 25 external auditors, and ensuring that there are no gaps or oversights in existing processes. 3. Tax and Compliance Running a business involves paying tax, and paying tax means doing a lot of calculations and filling out a lot of forms. Often using the financial statements as a basis, along with various other configurations of the information produced by Bookkeeping and Payables/Receivables, the Tax and Compliance function will make sure all of the government forms and filings are sent complete and on-time to the taxman. A strong Tax and Compliance function will go one step beyond simple compliance, and will find ways to minimize tax, so as to maximize the company‘s net income. 4. Strategic Planning and Financial Planning & Analysis This function, ―FP&A‖ for short, is the true bridge between the Past and the Future. FP&A regularly creates strategic and financial plans that forecast what financial results (sales and expenses) will look like in future periods. Then, they compare actual results—prepared with the assistance of the Financial Reporting and Control function—to determine areas where the business can improve. With this ―variance analysis‖ complete, they can then prepare more accurate forecasts for the future. A strong FP&A function will not only generate annual forecasts but will be able to update them even over the course of a day or two, and to run many scenarios that examine the effects of, say, losing a big customer or an economic contraction. 5. Treasury & Working Capital Management The key role of Treasury is to make sure that the company doesn‘t run out of cash. This means, among other things, forecasting the upcoming working capital (receivables, payables and inventory) needs of the company, investing surplus\n\n26. 26 cash in short-term instruments to generate modest interest income, and managing currency risk. 6. Capital Budgeting Capital Budgeting is the function responsible for selecting between the various uses of capital, or capital projects. After all, most organizations will have money available to invest in the business, with the hopes of either growing sales or reducing expenses. But the opportunities for spending typically exceed the amount available to spend, so Capital Budgeting develops business cases to evaluate and identify the most effective projects. A strong Capital Budgeting function will not only forecast project benefits, but will also track these benefits over time to determine whether the use of capital was as effective as originally anticipated. 7. Risk Management Risk Management is a function that is rapidly developing after the financial scandals of the early 2000s (Enron, WorldCom, the Great Recession and Lehman/Bear Stearns collapse, etc.). In the financial services industry, the function is particularly central as most institutions run with a high amount of debt (leverage), though leaders in other industries are also bulking up this function. Risk Management takes a hard look at some of the key risks faced by the company—currency, interest rate, market, operational, legal, etc.—and tries to quantify the possible impacts so that they can be mitigated as much as possible. If FP&A looks at the base case scenario for the company‘s financial results, Risk Management takes a wrecking ball to it. 8. Corporate Development & Corporate Strategy Corporate Development and Corporate Strategy can be widely defined, but it is the area of Finance most heavily populated by former investment bankers and management consultants. As such, common tasks that fall to this function include sourcing and analyzing mergers & acquisitions deals, raising debt and equity\n\n27. 27 financing, making capital structure decisions and providing insight into high level strategic decisions such as entering a new market. 4.5 HUMAN RESOURCE FUNCTION Hiring and Recruiting One of the primary functions of the human resources department is to oversee hiring and recruiting within an organization. The department actively recruits, screens, interviews and hires qualified candidates for open positions. The department administers skills assessment and personality tests to match candidates with the right job within the company. The human resources department also develops employee handbooks that explain company policies and procedures to new hires. Training and Development The human resources department handles the training and development of staff within an organization. It creates training programs and conducts training for new hires and existing employees. The human resources department also works in conjunction with department managers and supervisors to determine the training needs of employees. They are also responsible for contracts with training providers and monitoring training budgets. Handling Compensation The human resources department is responsible for various aspects of employee compensation. The department typically handles employee payroll and ensures employees are paid accurately and on time, with the correct deductions made. Human resources departments also manage compensation programs that include pensions and other fringe benefits offered by the employer.\n\n28. 28 Employee Benefits The human resources department manages all aspects of employee benefits, including health and dental insurance, long-term care or disability programs as well as employee assistance and wellness programs. The department keeps track of employee absences and job-protected leave, such as family medical leave. Human resources department representatives ensure employees receive the proper disclosures regarding benefit eligibility or if benefits are no longer available because of a layoff or termination. Employee Relations The human resources department handles employee relations matters within an organization. Employee relations involves employee participation in different aspects of organizational activities. The department maintains the relationship between employees and management by promoting communication and fairness within the company. The department also handles disputes between employees and management, as well as disputes between the company and labor unions or employee rights organizations. Legal Responsibilities The human resources department is responsible for interpreting and enforcing employment and labor laws such as equal employment opportunity, fair labor standards, benefits and wages, and work hour requirements. The department also investigates harassment and discrimination complaints and ensures company officials remain compliant with United States Department of Labor regulations.\n\n29. 29 CHAPTER 5 FINDINGS AND SUGGESTIONS 5.1 FINDINGS: HR  The company is running in a systematic and organized manner.  Majority of the factory laborers are women but other employees are mostly men.  Workers health and safety are given prime importance.  The employees are satisfied with the working environment and working hours.
