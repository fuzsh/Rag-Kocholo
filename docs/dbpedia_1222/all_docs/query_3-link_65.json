It is di- vided into two parts: (1) an analysis of the objectives, tactics, and capabilities of the party; and (2) a compilation of the specific. \"assets\" of the party drawn up on the basis of an exhaustive check- list provided by the Central Intelligence Agency. The first part of the paper focuses on the actual current major objectives of the party; the specific tactics employed to carry them out; and the capability of the party to achieve its objectives assessed in the light of both past and present performance. The second section of the paper is designed to supplement the evaluative portion of the paper by both itemizing the organizational potential and material assets of the party and, at the same time, providing an index to areas of Communist activity where information is inadequate, unreliable, or absent. The data presented in the sec- tion on \"Assets\" should not be treated as definitive; they are rather the best available to the Department at the present time.

OBJECTIVES The Communists in Burma are at present pursuing a two-pronged, \\and not completely consistent, policy. The illegal Communist under- ground) is continuing the insurrection which began in 1948, and seems at present to be concentrating on maintaining and consolidating its control over \"base areas,' while training and strengthening guerrilla units for future action. Efforts are also being made to develop effective alliances with other insurgent groups such as the White Band element of the People's Volunteer Organization and tha Karen National Defense Organization. At the same time, the above-ground, Communist-dominated Burma Workers and Peasants Party (B`JYPP), which is recognized by the govern- ment as a legal opposition group, seems most concerned with its own internal organization and with programs designed to develop popular support for the Party. The BWPP is agitating for an end to insurgency through formation of a coalition government including opposition elements. Communist efforts to recruit support within the Overseas Chinese Community are spearheaded by the China Democratic League (CDL). Vithin the framework of these general objectives, the Communist parties seek a number of immediate goals. Domestically, current efforts are concentrated on: 1, combating the growth of anti-Communist sentiment among the over- seas Chinese; 2. penetrating Buddhist organizations; 3. increasing the membership of \"mass organizations,\" which have thus far been relatively small in Burma; and 4. undermining the political position of the government and the Socialist Party which is its dominant element. Internationally, the chief immediate goal is to prevent a shift in official Burmese foreign policy toward the West and the US in particular. . References in this section to insurgent activity refer principally to action by the Burma Communist Party (BCP). Other Communist underground groups include: (1) the Communist Party (Burma) -- CP(B) -- which is a relatively small splinter group, and (2) a band of China-trained guerrillas under leadership of the Kachin renegade Naw Seng, which does not appear to be in contact with the BCP. SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4 There is, to some extent, a conflict between the policy of preparation for eventual overthrow'of the government and \"legal\" efforts to establish a broad popular base and to create pressures leading to a coalition government. The GUB is unlikely to be respon- sive to demands for a coalition as long as armed insurrection continues to threaten the political and economic stability of the nation, despite its apparent acquiescence in a rather artificial distinction between BCP insurgency and BWPP legal action. At the present time, overall Communist strategy seems to favor the \"legal\" efforts of the UWPP. II. TACTICS Current tactics include attempts to establish collaborative arrangements with other political groups and attempts to win direct following, for the party or its fronts, from diverse elements within the Burman and minority populations. The strength of the Communist appeal rests in the coincidence of certain aspects of current Communist policy with general Burmese fears and aspirations -- neutralist, anti- colonialist, and \"peace\" sentiments. The basically Marxist orientation of most present-day Burmese leaders, and the lingering sense of attach- ment to the homeland among the Chinese community also favor Communist efforts. Special appeals are.directed to identifiable groups within the population -- particularly youth and students and, most recently, the Buddhist leaders. There are some reports that Communist propagandists, perhaps aided by Chinese specialists, are attempting to subvert the minority peoples along the Sino-Burma border. The BWPP's small delegation in the Chamber of Deputies is important primarily as a focal point for expression of what are basically extra-parliamentary political pressures. Popular organiza- tions controlled by the BVPP or its labor wing, the Burma Trade Union Congress, are utilized to create the impression of popular demand for policies favored by the Party. In addition to opposing the specific actions or presumed intentions of the Government, political pressures. have been used in an attempt to destroy public confidence in the competence of the present Government. In planning its program, the E PP seems to be responsive to direction from the Chinese Embassy, through which it apparently receives some financial support. At the same time, guerrilla activity is continuing among under- ground groups. Although the BCP forces have increasingly been broken up into small. groups by Government military pressure, marauding bands still render large areas of the country insecure. Present insurgent military operations seem designed primarily to secure supplies and manpower, and to keep government forces off balance. SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4 SECRET .. SECURITY INFORMATION The BCP is capable of continuing its present level of guerrilla- type insurgency, thereby preventing the consolidation of government control over all Burma and retarding economic recovery and development. The BiVPP appears to have sufficient leadership, and an adequately dis- ciplined organization, to continue its agitational and penetration tactics, designed to maintain political pressure on the government and retard its slowly emerging trend toward a closer relationship with the West. The prospects for future Communist action will be determined largely by developments outside Burma, particularly decisions concerning broader Asian strategy. In the event of direct invasion or a greatly magnified program of direct aid to insurgent groups, the stability of the GUB would be seriously threatened. The Government might, in the absence of immediate and effective help from the West, seek accommoda- tion with Asian Communism, and it is relatively certain that the prestige and power of local Communist elements would be rapidly magnified. In the absence of external intervention, however, the Government will probably continue to make progress in its efforts to suppress the insurgents and may, as larger areas of the' country are secured, be emboldened to take more restrictive measures against \"legal\" Communist elements. In that event, the BNPP, which now appears to be the chief instrument of international Communist policy in Burma, might find its access to propaganda outlets circumscribed and its ability to manipulate front groups curtailed before its present organizational efforts have born fruit. In the absence of actual or imminently threatened invasion, or of unforeseen internal economic disorders, it seems unlikely that the parliamentary position of the BWPP will improve significantly or that its mass base will grow materially. The capacity of Burmese Communist groups to support Soviet policy will, therefore, depend directly on Soviet (or Chinese) action. The 1948 insurrection by the BCP has thus far failed in its primary aim of overthrowing the government and, balanced against an improving government position, its future is even less promising. Were it not for the ever-present threat that the Burmese future will be over- whelmed by events beyond its borders, it might be predicted that the Communist conspiracy would continue to wither, although at an agonizingly slow rate.

NUMERICAL STRENGTH An assessment of Communist strength in Burma must include both the illegal insurgent movement and above-ground Communist elements. Available data are insufficient to permit a definitive statement of total numerical strength. The Burma Communist Party (BCP) is the most important element of the underground movement. Its membership is estimated to be about 5,000. A small splinter group, the Communist Party (Burma) -- CP(B) -- was estimated in 1951 to have about 300 members and candi- dates. The CP(B) split from the BCP in 1946 as a result of personal differences within the Communist leadership. The two groups, however, reportedly concluded an agreement for at least limited military cooperation in August 1952. The principal above-ground group now appears to be the Burma Workers and Peasants Party (BVPP), which was formed in December 1950 by a group of dissident Socialists.. The party membership is unknown, but it has become increasingly well disciplined and energetic, taking effective leadership of Communist-dominated \"front groups.\" The most significant of the latter are: (1) the Burma Trade Union Congress (BTUC) with a present estimated membership of about 2,000; (2) the All- Burma Peasants Organization (ABPO), which claims a membership of 100,000, probably with considerable exaggeration; (3) the World Peace Congress (Burma) with a small but vocal membership; and (4) the People's Youth Organization (PYO), which was founded only in December 1952 but which has considerable potential importance. Communist organizations within the Overseas Chinese community are dominated by the China Democratio League (CDL), the nearest equivalent of a Chinese Communist Party. The League's membership is unknown. Although the membership of Communist organizations therefore seems relatively small, the number of individuals who are subject to Communist influence and pressure is probably significantly higher, partly because of widespread receptivity in Burma to a number of aspects of current Communist propaganda efforts. The number who are \"strongly influenced\" by Communist elements should probably include most of the membership of the non-Communist Trade Union Congress (Burma), and the membership of the People's Peace Front (PPF) and Mahabama parties, which collaborate with the BXPP. The Chinese population as a whole remains vulnerable to Communist pressure, but since 1950 vigorous efforts by non-Communist Chinese elements have probably reduced the number who are strongly influenced. Rural populations are exposed to Communist propaganda and organizational effort for short periods in the course of guerrilla operations. Although no adequate figures are SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION - 5 - available, it seems likely that 5 percent of the total Burmese population may be controlled or strongly influenced by Communist elements. Geographically, Communist strength is heavily concentrated in Rangoon and the southern towns of Burma (the BWPP and CDL groups) and in insurgent pockets in central and northern Burma (BCP). The main sources of Burmese Communist recruits appear to have been students and youth, intellectuals, and peasants; urban labor has thus far been less significant. Among the resident Chinese, the leadership is predominantly middle class in origin; laboring classes provide the bulk of membership; and a number of businessmen appear to be passive sympathizers. Comparatively little is known concerning the quality and reliability of the Communist membership or of its leaders. Although the guerrilla groups undoubtedly include some elements whose principal motivation is organized banditry, the leadership appears to possess firm political resolve and to be in effective control of its following. The surrender rate among insurgent groups has remained relatively low despite mounting government military pressure. Most of the leadership has belonged to Marxist, if not Communist, organizations for a period of five to ten years. The above-ground BWPP has recently been reorganized and \"puri- fied\" in a move which has apparently strengthened its internal homogeneity and removed elements of doubtful reliability. Although it is probable that the total membership has declined somewhat since mid-1951, it seems likely that the strength and dependability of the party has increased, and that it will continue to exercise effective leadership of above-ground pro-Communist groups. The leadership of the China Democratic League is relatively more experienced and many of its important leaders have been trained in China. The membership of the League inoreased\"markedly between 1946 and 1950; in the last two years, however, its total strength has remained relatively stable and may have declined somewhat. II. ELECTORAL STRENGTH Since the underground Communist parties are outlawed, Communist voting power is reflected only in the votes received by candidates of the B41PP and the parties which support it -- chiefly the People's Peace Front and the Mahabama. The parliamentary strength of these groups in the Chamber of Deputies elected in 1951, related to the representation of other parties, is as follows, Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION 6 - Party Number of seats BiIPP 9 PPF 3 Mahabama 1 Other opposition groups 27 The Government Coalition# including the Socialist Party 196 The moat recent test of Communist electoral strength occurred in the Rangoon municipal. elections of February 20, 1952. The three opposition parties listed above ran joint candidates, under the banner of the Triple Alliance. The coalition won only one seat out of 35, in contrast with a representation of 15 seats for comparable parties in the Council elected in 1949. However, these figures do not reflect BXPP strength adequately, for Triple Alliance candidates are reported to have received almost half the total vote given to candidates of the governing coalition (the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League). Nevertheless, the drastic decline in Council seats is significant because of the predominant role of Rangoon in national life. Although the B1RPP and its affiliated groups are currently agitating for a coalition government including the Communists, there is no evidence of specific planning for future. elections. III. MILITARY STRENGTH AND ORGANIZATION FOR VIOLENT ACTION The Communist insurrection in Burma, coupled with Karen insurgency and the depredations of non-political bandit gangs, has effectively and seriously retarded Burmese recovery from wartime devastation. It is a continuing, though somewhat diminishing? threat to the integrity of the state. The insurgency is exploited by above- ground Communist elements in their attacks on the government. Of the various insurgent elements, the Burma Communist Party (BCP) has been and remains the most significant. The party controls as many as 8,000 guerrillas, which are now organized in small bands. There have been no recent report of concentrations of more than 300 in a single group. The BCP is reported to have succeeded recently in establishing a coalition with two other underground elements: (1) the Communist Party (Burma), with an estimated strength of 1,000; and (2) some elements of the White Band People's Volunteer Organization -- total PVO strength is estimated at 3,000, but the effective strength of collaborating groups is unknown. A potentially important group, which is now apparently independent of the BCP, is a force of Kachin-Burman-Chinese guerrillas, estimated at 1,500, under the SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION - 7 - leadership of the renegade Naw geng. Naw Seng's two battalions have been trained in China, and may represent the beat disciplined and most thoroughly indoctrinated insurgent group. All insurgent groups appear to be currently concentrating on strengthening their control of limited, relatively inaccessible \"base areas.\" BCP groups have been pushed back within the past year by government military operations; their current strength is located chiefly in central Burma south of Mandalay, in northern Burma, and in the western region stretching toward the Chin Hills. CP(B) groups are located primarily in the Irrawaddy delta and westward toward the Arakan. Naw Seng's force is reported to be in the Bhamo area in northern Burma. No significant military operations have been undertaken recently by-the insurgent groups except the BCP, and these have been confined to hit-and-run raids against government outposts, attacks on trans- portation and communications lines, and harassment of villages which are inadequately protected. Troops not so engaged are concerned primarily with protecting Communist-held areas from government forces, but in case of attack, the Communists prefer to withdraw rather than fight as long as it is possible to remove supplies and equipment. Little has been learned concerning the administrative apparatus established by BCP groups in areas which they control. Although the party claims to govern local areas -- appointing officials, directing education, and controlling marketing -- it is doubtful whether any permanent administrative apparatus has been established.. Above- ground Communist groups are primarily responsible for propaganda activity, but the BCP has undoubtedly carried on some propaganda work in connection with local recruiting efforts. The degree of popular support which Communist guerrillas have received seems to be a function of the military force which they can apply in any area. For the most part, the rural population appears to be passive, reacting to preponderant military pressure and aiding guerrillas only when coercion is present or threatened. The guerrilla groups live off the country, and no central supply organization is known to exist. Even though the several groups are relatively independent, there is some intercommunication (including radio), and Communist intelligence concerning government operations appears to have been generally good. The BCP leadership has made persistent efforts to secure effective working arrangements with other insurgent groups. In August 1952, an agreement was reportedly reached with representatives Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION - s - of the Communist Party (Burma) and some White Band elements of the People's Volunteer Organization, providing for collaboration and demarcation of respective areas of activity. Because of past personal antagonisms among leaders of the various groups, the realization of a working arrangement would appear to reflect desperation born of declining strength, or perhaps a BCP effort to qualify for more extensive Chinese assistance by providing evidence of effective leader- ship of all guerrilla elements. External assistance (from China) to the Communist guerrillas has. thus far been sporadic and at a relatively low level. Some BCP cadres are reported to have received training in Yunnan. Naw Seng's guerrilla units have been trained in China, and may pose a more significant long-term threat to the government by establishing a protected base area in a remote region of northern Burma. There are no reliable reports of significant amounts of arms being furnished to Burmese guerrillas from China. In its efforts to suppress the Communist insurgency, the Burma Government has been handicapped by the necessity of simultaneously containing Chinese Nationalist troops in eastern Burma, attempting to subdue Karen rebels, and suppressing'Moslem dissidents in the Arakan. Total government strength of about 60,000, including the Union Military Police, is heavily taxed by its varied responsibilities, and the forces available for anti-Communist efforts fluctuates from time to time, in accordance with demands created by the actions of other dissident groups. Key posts are manned; mobile reserves are maintained at central locations; and from time to time offensive actions are taken against isolated pockets of resistance. In the absence of stepped-up external assistance, the future capabilities of the Communist insurgents are not likely to improve. Although the guerrilla forces have been able to maintain their strength for some time, no significant expansion has taken place. It is not clear whether manpower or arms shortages represent the chief limitation. On balance, the government position has improved within the past year; perhaps the most significant development has been the increasing fragmentation of guerrilla forces and the restoration of agricultural production in some areas of the Irrawaddy delta which have been cleared on insurgents. In addition to weakening the resource base of the Communists, this development will, in the long run, contribute to the strength and stability of the government. So far as is known, the above-ground BWPP has organized no paramilitary units, and has no plans for participation in violent action. In order to keep its present legal status, the party must at least preserve the appearance of being no more than an opposition political party.

GOVERNMENT POLICY TOWARD COMMUNISM Present government policy draws a somewhat artificial distinction between political pressure and insurgency which, in turn, has led to the development of the two arms of the Communist movement in Burma. The insurrectionary Communist parties -- BCP and CP(B) -- have been outlawed by the Government, and exist only as underground movements. The BWPP, however, is a legal, political party, has a small parlia- mentary representation (9 seats out of 232) and is relatively unob- structed in its manipulation of front groups. (Exception: the government has occasionally denied passports to proposed delegates to international Communist meetings.) Because of official reluctance to prevent distribution of literature which is not openly seditious, Communist propagandists havesecured important outlets for dissemination of printed propa- ganda, taking advantage of an existing market for any literature which is interpreted as shedding light on \"experiments in socialism.\" Recently, however the Home Minister issued a strong warning to publicists who spread false information, advocate armed uprising, or undermine the security of the state. Within the Chinese community, the CDL and other Communist fronts have been permitted considerable political freedom of action in Burma, owing to the Burma Government's neutralist foreignpolicy, its desire not to antagonize Communist China, and to the fact that Peiping has not encouraged the Burma Chinese to indulge in overt agitation against the Burma Government. Nevertheless, Chinese Communist political activity is limited by the Burmese constitutional provisions that only Burmese nationals may vote and by the exclusion of a large proportion of the Chinese from Burmese citizenship. During 1951-52, the increasingly vitriolic anti-Western tone of local Chinese Communist propaganda, which the Burma government deemed injurious to Burma's neutral position, and the affiliation of pro- Communist Chinese with Burmese extreme leftist opposition elements, led to the government's tacit encouragement of anti-Communist elements in the Chinese community. It is expected that the government will continue its present policy of sharply scrutinizing, though not severely restricting, local Chinese Communist political activities, and of tacitly encouraging the anti-Communist Chinese. There is. relatively little organized labor in Burma; total union membership is probably less than 70,000. The Socialist- controlled Trade Union Congress (Burma) -- TUC(B) -- split in Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION December 1950 when the BWPP,wah organized; the dissident union leaders formed the Burma Trade Union Congress (BTUC), which is now Communist- controlled. The most important affiliates of the BTUC are the All-Burma Ministerial Services Union (ABMSU), which is small but vital because its members staff government offices, and the Chauk Oilfields Workers Front. Total BTUC membership was estimated in mid-1952 at less than 2,000. The percentage of Communists to non-Communists within the BTUC unions is unknown; the leadership is Communist, however, and .appears to be in effective control. In addition to the BTUC, there are at least a dozen Chinese labor unions, most of them small and concentrated in Rangoon; all except the Carpenters Union are Communist-controlled. The Most important are those which deal with food marketing and handling,. the Teachers Union, and the Stevedores Union. Apart from Communist-controlled unions, there is probably some surviving Communist influence in most of the unions affiliated with the Socialist-led TUC(B). Since the 1950 split, the struggle for control between BTUC and TUC(B) leaders has been particularly strong in the Inland Water Transport Workers Union and its five subsidiary groups. Although the leadership now supports the'TUC'(B), Communist influence may still be prevalent in some locals. The Communist-controlled BTUC has been affiliated with the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) since July 1951. The status of the TUC(B) in relation to WFTU is at present unclear. Prior to the 1950 split which led to formation of the BTUC, the parent organization had been affiliated.: A 1951 May Day resolution expressed interest in continued membership, but TUC(B) leaders have since stated that the group is not presently affiliated. It is certain that the TUC(B) has not been active in WFTU affairs. VI. CONQUNIST INFLUENCE IN SOCIAL, CULTURAL, A T ONS The most active Communist front organizations are in the fields of youth and student activities, international \"friendship\" societies and the Communist \"peace movement,\" and among the Overseas Chinese. The following groups merit special mention: 1. Youth: There are two underground youth organizations, the Communist Youth League and the Democratic Peopls's Youth League, which are probably small but under effective BCP. control. The B4i'PP sponsored no distinct youth organization until December 1952, when the People's SECRET - SECURITY.INFORMATION Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION Youth Organization (PYO) was founded. Although at present, in the formative stage, the PYO may become the focal point for Communist activity among youth and students. The only non-Communist youth organization, the Burma Youth League, is non-political and relatively insignificant. 2. Students: The All-Burma Students Federation (ABSF) and the All-Rangoon Students Union are believed to be Communist-controlled. The ABSF is probably affiliated with the International Union of Students. The only competing organization is the Rangoon University Students Union (RUSU) which has experienced a continual struggle for control between Communist and non-Communist elements. The most recent elections for union officers reflect some persisting. Communist influence. 3. The World Peace Council: The Burma Branch of the World Peace Council -- WFC(B) -- Is probably one of the most significant \"front\" groups although its active membership is believed to be relatively small. Branches of the parent organization have been established in a number of towns, and the group may be the most effective instrument for dissemination of Communist propaganda outside of Rangoon. The Council is controlled by the BWPP; its Secretary General, Ba Nyein, is a member of the BoIPP.Executive Committee and is considered the party's \"leading thinker.\" 4. Chinese Organizations: A number of organizations within the Overseas Chinese commun are ommunist-controlled or at least pro- Peiping. Next to the China Democratic League, the most important Chinese group is the Chamber of Commerce. Its leadership is pre- dominantly pro-Peiping, although control is being vigorously contested by anti-Communist elements within the Chamber. The Hui-an Young Men's Association, the Chinese Youth Society, and the Chinese Students Union attempt to spread Communist influence among youth and students; the first two are outstanding among all Chinese youth organizations. Of the several regional Chinese societies, the Fukienese Association is the only one which is considered to be Communist-dominated. Other Communist-controlled Chinese organizations include: the Chinese Women's Association, the Women's Welfare Workers Society, the Burma Chinese Relief Association, and the Burma Chinese Cultural Union. 5. Women: The All-Burma Women's Freedom League, formed by the BWPP in January 1951, is the most active of three legal women's organizations in Burma. A smaller group, the All-Burma Women's Union, is controlled by the BCP and has been underground since 1947. 6. Friendship Societies: The Sino-Burmese Friendship Society.. and the Burma-Soviet Cultural Association are small but significant SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION groups, because membership is drawn largely from educated and therefore relatively influential classes. The former is now composed exclusively of Burmese, and is devoted to promoting interest in China and preserving \"traditional ties of friendship.\" The latter was formed with tacit approval of the Soviet Embassy in Rangoon, but appears to be operated by Burmese, including some non-Communists, who are. interested in Soviet culture. 7. Minorities= Apart from the numerous Chinese organizations, the principal m nority groups controlled by Communists or Communist- sympathizers are the All-Burma Indian Youth League and the All-Burma Indian Congress. Communist penetration of the Indian minority has been largely limited to laborers, some of whom are also represented in Communist-dominated unions. Organizational efforts appear to be directed at present toward enlarging Communist-controlled units within important organizations and securing mass support for the propaganda appeals of above-ground Communist groups. Most politically conscious Burmese support some policies which are currently advocated by local communists: eg., resolution of the problem posed by the Chinese Nationalist troops in Burma, some aspects of the \"peace\" campaign, and anti-colonialism. It has not been possible to determine the extent to which advocacy of such programs by non-Communist Burmese represents oonsoious support of particular Communist policies. Quite clearly, however, Communist influence extends beyond those organizations which are controlled. or strongly influenced by Communists.

COMMUNIST INFILTRATION INTO GOVERNMENT Direct Communist infiltration of the Burma Government appears to have been slight. So far as is known, no Communists are represented in policy-making bodies or in top levels of the military and police organ- izations. Although there are probably some Communists or Communist- sympathizers on the staffs of the several government departments, there is no evidence that they have had a direct impact on policies and pro- grams of the government. Nevertheless, it may be well to point out that, indirectly at least, Communist \"influence\" is present within the government'at almost all levels. The most important Communist asset is the strength of Com- munist China; fear of antagonizing the powerful neighbor to the north has been directly responsible for the government's rigid verbal adherence to a neutral foreign policy. Secondly, most government officials subscribe to Marxist views in fields such as economic organization, and their background has stimulated an interest in \"socialist experiments\" in other parts of the world. Many are known to read Soviet and Chinese. literature. This indirect influence is stronger with some individuals than others. The present Minister of Land Nationalization, Thakin Tin, for example, holds extreme leftist views on nationalization and collectivization, although he is not known to be a Communist. In general, there is far more interest in the Chinese \"experiment\" than in the Soviet Union, and it is doubtful whether such interest is attributable, at the top levels of government, to direct Communist infiltration.. VIII. COMMU IST INFLUENCE ON PUBLIC OPINION FORMATION Just as there is some indirect Communist influence at official levels, so interest in China and to a limited degree a curiosity about the USSR have opened the way to. some Communist influence on the public opinion-forming process. This is attributable as such to the predispo- sitions-of non-Communist Burmese as to direct efforts by Communist elements. There is some Communist influence in educational circles, partic- ularlythe Chinese schools and in higher Burmese educational: institutions. Of the more than 200 Chinese schools in Burma, a majority appear to be using Peiping-approved textbooks, although there has been some recession .in Communist penetration since 1950. There is also continuing Communist penetration of student groups at Rangoon University . Penetration of Buddhist, circles has thus far been slight, although efforts to secure Buddhist support for international Communist \"causes\" SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4 are currently being intensified, apparently with some success. The government has shown genuine concern over these developments, and is endeavoring to counteract Communist influence by stimulating Buddhist revival programs, denying passports to Buddhist priests recruited for international Communist conferences, etc. The Communist press is relatively small, but non-Communist publications, on their own initiative, support some current Communist propaganda themes (most notably, the \"menace\" of Chinese Nationalist troops in eastern Burma, and evidences of \"colonialism\" in all parts of the world.) The Soviet Embassy in Rangoon has recently secured an outlet for Chinese and Russian films, by renting the King Theater on a monthly basis. During 1951 over 100 Chinese films were exhibited in Rangoon, and although the contents are not known, it seems safe to assume that many contained Communist propaganda themes. No noteworthy infiltration of right-wing political organizations and parties has come to light. Among left-wing, non-Communist politi- cal groups, there has been considerable indirect influence; some ele- ments of Communist dogma (anti-colonialism, collectivism) have wide appeal in most political circles in.Burma, due to historical experience and Marxist training of most national leaders. Direct Communist in- fluence, however, appears to be declining. There is an increasing tendency, particularly at the top levels, to distinguish between cur rent Soviet behavior and the theoretical Marxist formulations to which many Burmese leaders still adhere. Collaboration with Communist elements by some Karen leaders and Dr. Ba Maw's Mahabama party appears to be based on expediency, rather than on ideological-compatibility.

Printing Establishments The following information is incomplete, but probably covers the most important local sources of Communist publications, excluding newspapers: 1. Kyaw Linn Booksellers and Publishers, /180, 51st Street, Rangoon -- Kyaw Linn has translated and printed books on China and the USSR, in addition to distributing literature reportedly sup- plied through Soviet and Chinese Embassy channels in Delhi. Kyaw Linn reportedly has been aided by the Rangoon Chinese Embassy with an initial capital investment. The firm manages at least four bookstalls on Bogyoke Street. The US Embassy has estimated that sales at each average more than 1,000 books per week. 2. Myint Swe Publishing House, Rangoon -- This firm is reported to have translated and published some of the works of Mao Tse-tung. It is not a prosperous concern. 3. Central Publishing House, Bogyoke Market, Rangoon -- This firm publishes and sells Burmese translations of popular Communist literature. Do Imported Publications The following periodicals have been available, at various times, at the People's Literature House, 546 Merchant Street, Rangoon: 1.

Bi-Monthly Soviet Woman In addition, pamphlet literature seems to be distributed in fairly large quantities. E. Publications of Soviet-Satellite Diplomatic Establishments Viet Minh representatives in Rangoon publish a weekly bulletin entitled \"Vietnam Information.\" Its total circulation is unknown. Distribution to many parts of the world is handled in Rangoon. The Chinese Embassy apparently subsidizes one or more papers in Rangoon, but is not known to publish any periodicals itself. Local radio broadcasting is a government monopoly, and no direct Communist influence has been discernible. There is no known Communist broadcasting activity in Burma, except 'possibly for some radio communi- cation among guerrilla units. The military network, if it exists, is probably used primarily for operational liaison and not for public propaganda activity. There is a limited audience for both Soviet and Chinese broad- casts. Soviet broadcasting appears to be confined to daily trans- missions in English directed to Southeast Asia, plus the Soviet Chinese-language service which can perhaps be heard in Burma. The audience for Chinese Communist broadcasts is probably limited to the Chinese community. Approximately 30 hours per week on international beams can be picked up in Burma. Although no figures are available, the number of radio receivers is sufficiently low so that radio is a much less significant medium for external propaganda than publications and personal contact.

It is doubtful whether the dues-paying membership of Communist organiza- tions, particularly in the labor unions, is very large, and direct receipts of this kind can be only a minor element in total party finances. The underground guerrilla groups appear to be heavily de- pendent on local requisitioning and foraging in the areas of current military operations. Above-ground Communist groups are known to receive contributions from businessmen and other groups which are vulnerable to persuasion or pressure. The China Democratic League, in particular, probably derives part of its financial support from merchants engaged in trade with China. It is not known, however, whether any of these firms exist primarily for purposes of financing Communist activity. Leaders of the Burma Workers and Peasants Party apparently re- ceive some financial assistance through the Chinese Embassy in Rangoon. The money spent on local rallies (where, frequently, no collections are taken) suggests outside financial help. In addition, supplies of Chinese Communist publications are a direct contribution to local Communist propaganda activity. It is not known whether the Soviet Embassy has contributed directly to local party finances. In general, the financial condition of the Burmese Communists appears to be poor, with the exception of activities connected with the increasingly virulent propaganda campaign. The guerrilla groups have been able to sustain their present level of activity, but do not appear to have financial resources adequate to attract wider support or to procure additional arms. Chinese Communist elements, by virtue of their ability to exact donations from local businessmen, are in much better financial condi- tion than the Burmese groups.

Communist China The first Chinese Communist Ambassador to Burma presented his credentials in September 1950. By August 1952, the Embassy staff was reported to. include 15 principal officers and 26 other members. Many of these individuals are described as \"active outside,\" implying that considerable efforts are made to keep in contact with local Chinese organizations of various types. Supplies of printed propaganda are apparently funneled through the Embassy for distribution throughout the Chinese community, utilizing schools, commercial, labor, and cul- tural organizations as outlets and as centers for displays. It is probable that propaganda activity, in the broadest sense, is an impor- tant responsibility of most members of the Embassy staff. The Sino-Burmese Friendship Society also functions with support from the Chinese Embassy. Its membership (total unknown but apparently relatively small) includes non-Communists interested in cultural re- lations with China as well as pro-Communist elements. The Soviet Embassy was established in Rangoon in April 1951, with an original staff of eight. In late 1951, the total staff was reported to number 31, including housekeeping and administrative personnel. The Embassy has a Press Attache, and it seems probable that other staff members are engaged in essentially propaganda and contact work, since the size of the Embassy is greater than regular Embassy activities would justify. The Burma-Soviet Cultural Association, headed by a respected member of the Rangoon University faculty, was founded early in 1952. The Soviet Embassy appears to have left the initiative primarily to Burmese intellectuals interested in the USSR, with quiet encouragement for the society's activities. The first open meeting was attended by about 200 persons, but active membership is not known. Co European Satellites A Czechoslovak Consulate General was opened July 10, 1952, but no information on its staff is available. A Hungarian trade delegation is reported to be in Rangoon, but its size also is unknown. The activities of both the Czech Consul General and the Hungarian trade delegation members, although ostensibly directed toward increasing trade, probably include activities which should be labeled as propaganda.

COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS Although no international Communist organizations maintain permanent bureaus or offices in Burma, the activities of some of these groups have been an important part of the total Communist propaganda effort in Burma. Local propaganda organs play up Burmese participation in international conferences both before and after Burmese delegations Delegations have been sent to the following recent . one abroad have g conferences: Meeting World Youth Festival - Berlin Moscow Economic Conference Asian and Pacific Peace Conference - Peiping International Cultural Conference - Moscow WFTU General Council - Berlin World Peace Council - Vienna Date Size of Delegation Aug. 1951 5 April 1952 7 Sept. 1952 26 Oct. 1952 10 Nov. 1952 3 Dec. 1952 20 Although the delegations have usually included Communists, they have not been composed exclusively of known party members. Burmese participation in the work of international \"front\" organizations seems to have been largely limited to-attendance at these conferences. Although no reliable data*are available, it seems un- likely that financial contributions have been received from Burmese groups. On the contrary, the international organizations appear to. subsidize the participation of. Burmese groups, at least to the extent of underwriting expenses while travelers are in orbit countries.

International Party Channels All Communist elements in Burma emphasize the country's ties to China, because of a general Burmese sense of nearness to China and an interest in Chinese developments. Outwardly, therefore, the closest international links appear to be with Communist China. Ties with the Indian Communist Party have not been close, although one finds occasional references to liaison with representatives of the East Bengal Communist Party. There is ample, although circumstantial, evidence that above- ground Communist elements follow international Communist directives concerning propaganda drives, although local implementation of specific campaigns is frequently tardy. Under the'direction of local \"front\" groups, the world-wide \"signature campaigns\" are carried on in Burma, and particular propaganda themes related to Far Eastern affairs are generally carried in local organs. It is not known, however, whether the Chinese or the Soviet Embassy is the original source of directives to local groups. Although there are frequent reports of directives from Chinese or Soviet officials concerning party strategy in Burma, it is impossible to determine whether specific moves, particularly with reference to guerrilla activity, are the direct result of Chinese or Soviet direction. Since early in 1952, there seems to have been a shift in emphasis, from direct military action to above-ground agitation for a \"united front\" government and an end to insurgency. It is not clear whether the mili- tary weakness of the insurgent groups is responsible for the shift, or whether it was made in response to a directive concerning general Asian Communist strategy. 1. International courier system. The Chinese Embassy in Rangoon is known to have a regular courier service, and it is probable that the Soviet Embassy provides similar facilities. In addition, commercial channels are readily available within the Chinese community. There are reports that crew members of ships calling at Rangoon serve as contacts with both Chinese and-Soviet Embassies, but details are unavailable. There is also direct overland communication with China, but it is not possible to state whether these routes are more important than sea con- tacts. Available evidence suggests, without definite proof, that the above-ground BWPP has direct access to the Chinese Embassy in Rangoon, and that the underground BCP maintains overland contact with China. SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION It is probable that arrangements for guerrilla training in China are made by direct liaison with Chinese officials in Yunnan. 2. Domestic communications. The nature of current Communist operations reduces the need for close integration among the several elements. Above-ground activities are concentrated in Rangoon and in major towns, and personal travel is limited only by deficiencies in local transportation. Underground activity is apparently linked by courier and radio facilities between guerrilla areas, but details are unavailable. Radio equipment is frequently moved to avoid capture, and the location of present installations is unknown.

It is di- vided into two parts: (1) an analysis of the objectives, tactics, and capabilities of the party;.and (2) a compilation of the specific \"assets\" of the party drawn up on the basis of an exhaustive check- list provided by the Central Intelligence Agency. The first part of the paper focuses on the actual current major objectives of the party; the specific tactics employed to carry them out; and the capability of the party to achieve its objectives assessed in the light of both past and present performance. The second section of the paper is designed to supplement the evaluative portion of the paper by both itemizing the organizational potential and material assets of the party and, at the same time, providing an index to areas of Communist activity where information is inadequate, unreliable, or absent. The data presented in the sec- tion on \"Assets\" should not be treated as definitive; they are rather the best available to the Department at the present time.

Within the area which they have conquered, the Communist objective is to improve their control over popu- lation and resources in order to maximize their total military effort. Within the areas controlled by the legitimate Governments of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, the Communist objectives area 1. To subvert the loyalty of the population. 2. To improve the party's covert organization. II. TACTICS Communism's objectives in Indochina are furthered by the Soviet and satellite-recognized \"Democratic Republic of Vietnam,\" its Chinese-supported and equipped army, its administrative and control organizations (police, secret and security services, propaganda organizations, administrative. cadres), and by its popular front movement, the \"Lien Viet\" or \"National Unity Front.\" The entire insurrectionary structure is held together and controlled by the Laodong (Communist) Party. It is the Laodong.Party which, in the final resort, operates the complex mechanism of war, propaganda, and compul- sion which appears to the people of Vietnam and to the outside world as the \"Viet Minh\" movement. And the Laodong Party, in turn, is managed by a group of highly trained and thoroughly experienced revolutionary leaders. The Communist Party in Indochina uses.both military tactics and political warfare tactics to further its over-all objectives. Its military tactics are designed: (1) to inflict maximum disrup- tion and destruction on enemy forces and enemy war potential in the rear zones, with the minimum expenditure of Viet Minh forces; (2) to infiltrate, occupy, and consolidate territory with a view to securing a continuing reservoir of potential manpower recruitment for the army and to finding the necessary economic mans (mainly food) to support intensification of the war. These tactics have been highly successful. For over six years the Viet Minh has inflicted heavy casualties on the Franoo-Vietnamese forces, while paralyzing Indochinese. economic life and preventing the country's recovery. The Viet Minh is now strongly established in North and Northwest Tonkin, in the lightly industrialized and food-producing regions SECRET - SECURITY IN+CRMATION A ---A C- ')fl171 t11lon Id_PnPRAPnn9RARfltl(1Rflt1(18fltlfl'I-4 Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION of North Central Vietnam, and in the coastal plains of South Central Vietnam. Most of China's long common boundary with Indochina is now in Viet Minh hands, permitting continued Chinese Communist assistance to the Viet Minh armed forces. Communist political warfare tactics are designed: (1) to ex- tend Communist influence among all social and economic groups in the populations of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos; and (2) to consolidate Communist control over conquered areas and populations.. Communist propaganda attempts to exploit sentiment \"for independ- ence\" and \"against French colonialism.\" To some extent, but only within carefully-drawn limits, the attempt to make the Viet Minh effort appear one of genuine national resistance to a foreign colonizing power con- tinues to displace certain other considerations in Communist tactics. Thus, Catholics in the Viet Minh zones have not.been persecuted,. nor, until very recently, attacked ideologically, so that the pretense of continued Catholic support for the \"war of resistance\" could be main- tained. Similarly, although agrarian reform has been strongly stressed,. landlords have been dispossessed only where it was essential to secure fuller cooperation on the part of the landless peasantry. Orthodox Communist doctrine has generally taken second place to \"anti-imperialist\" themes in Viet Minh propaganda. However, whenever the priority needs of intensifying the armed struggle have demanded that themes of \"national unity\" and nationalistic propaganda be soft-pedalled, this has been done, particularly since 1951. Efforts to consolidate Communist control over areas and popula- tions already under Communist influence center upon the peasantry. Basic Viet Minh policies and the major part of its propaganda output are calculated to increase the peasantry's contribution to the military effort. Both within and outside the zones under direct Viet Minh control, the Communists rely heavily upon conspiratorial methods and upon a large and widespread system of terror and compulsion. Such a system has been essential not only in providing the necessary vehicle for Communist control of the vast masses of people (some 12 million) and the variegated leader- ship which the Viet Minh movement has brought under its banners,. but also in order to gather the necessary intelligence for military operations and political warfare.

CAPABILITIES If Franco-Vietnamese military strength in Indochina does not increase, the Viet Minh may become strong enough within the next few years to be able, without identifiable Chinese Communist interven- tion, to break the current stalemate. While the Viet Minh's military capabilities are at present limited by its exclusion from the more . productive regions of Vietnam, this might be overcome by significantly increased Chinese Communist materiel and technical assistance and by conquest of further territory. At the same time, although the regime continues to be based largely on compulsion and terror and to depend mainly for the achievement of its objectives upon increasingly harsh exploitation of a war-weary peasantry, the Viet Minh's administrative and control capabilities seem adequate to counteract any growth of discontent among the populations and armies under its control. The Viet Minh's popular hold on substantial portions of the populations outside its own zones, based partly on military prestige, partly on continued nationalist appeal, and partly on a widespread mechanism of compulsion and terror, is likely to be increased or decreased in. proportion to the military power and ideological dynamism which the free world, and above all the free states of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos may be able to bring to bear against it. SECRET - SECURITY INFCRMATICIK Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4 SECRET - SECURITY I'ORMATION Communist Party membership, following and strength are heavily concentrated in the areas of Indochina controlled by the \"Democratic Republic of Vietnam.\" In the \"DRY\", the official Communist party, the LAO DONG (Workers) Party,has a membership variously estimated at be- een 56,000 and 715,000. Although reliable data on the number of people under Communist Party discipline is lacking, the all-enoompassing coverage of the constituent organizations of the Communist-controlled National Unity Front (LIEN VIET), suggests that a majority of the 12.7 million inhabitants of the \"DRY\" may be oonsidered under effective Communist control. In the areas under the control of the Associated States govern- ments of Vietnam$ Cambodia, and Laos, the Communist party is proscribed. However, there are obviously Communists in all of these areas, due to the ease With which the non-Communist regions can be infiltrated. In Vietnam particularly, but also in Cambodia and Laos, a number of clandestine Viet Minh or Chinese-Communist-controlled organizations are believed to be operating. How many of the 9.9 million population of free Vietnam are under Communist discipline cannot be estimated. Clandestine Communist opera- tions are, however, relatively successful. In part, this is due to a widespread Communist system of compulsion; on the other hand, the Viet Minh cause continues to exert considerable national appeal in the free zones of Vietnam. It is possible that a substantial portion of the Vietnamese population and of the 800,000 Chinese in Vietnam are sympathetic to the objectives of the Viet Minh and therefore susceptible to Communist influence. In Cambodia, it is unlikely that more than 10 percent of the population of 3 million (including the Chinese) are strongly influenced by Communism. However, some 5000-10,000 Viet Minh guerrillas, mainly concentrated in the Southern provinces, are reported fighting in units of about company size against Franoo-K aer forces. In early 1952, the Chinese Communist regime claimed the loyalty of 60 percent of the 300,000 Chinese in Cambodia. While this claim is undoubtedly exaggerated, a sub- stantial percentage of the Chinese in Cambodia are believed to be under Communist influence. In Laos, the number of people under Communist influence is believed to be extremely small - perhaps one percent of the one million population. SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION The number of Viet Minh guerrillas in Laos is estimated at about 5,000. Communist strength is believed heaviest in the DRV-oontrolled provinces of North Tonkin and North Central Annam; less numerous in \"DRV\" areas in Central Annam and Cochinohina. Communist influence in free Vietnam is probably strongest in the urban areas of Saigon-Cholon, Hanoi, and Haiphong. In Cambodia, Viet Minh influence is strongest in the southern provinces where guerrilla units are concentrated. Chinese Communist influence in Cambodia is strongest in Phnom..Penh where the Chinese population is heavily concentrated. In Laws, Communist influence is strongest in the Bolovens Plateau region where the Viet Minh guerrillas are mainly based. Communist Party membership in Indochina is believed to be composed principally of professionals and government employees. In the \"DRV\", industrial workers probably constitute an additional important membership group, Communist leadership in Indochina is believed to be well-educated (Western Europe, China and the USSR), thoroughly experienced, completely dedicated, and competent to fulfill not only its present responsibilities but those it would inherit as a consequence of total victory in Indochina. The average age of the sixteen current top-level Communist leaders is 47. Many top leaders have been active since 1930. II. ELECTORAL STRENGTH On January 6, 1946, the Viet Minh Government held elections for a \"Vietnam National Assembly\" in an effort to legitimize its rule. In addition to the polling in-areas of North and Central Vietnam under DRV control, clandestine votes were taken in parts of South Vietnam. There is considerable doubt as to the extent to which these elections re- flected the popular will; an implausibly large vote was claimed for a country where the parliamentary system is all but unknown. Among the 300-odd members of the \"elected Assembly,\" the Viet Minh (then ostensibly a coalition of left-wing and nationalist parties under Communist domina- tion) emerged as the largest party with 80 delegates. The 90 independents probably also included a significant number of Communists and another group of 15 Communists was elected under the label of the \"Marxist Party.\" No further elections have been held in the Communist-held areas of Indochina. Elections have, however, taken place in Laos and Cambodia and are now about to take place in free Vietnam, although, of course, without Communist participation. SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION III. MILITARY STRENGTH AND ORGANIZATION FOR VIOLENT ACTION A. Total Strength and Character of Communist Forces The Viet Minh disposes of a total armed strength of about 315,000 men, distributed as follows, Regular Army, 130,000 Regional Forces, 15,000 People's Militia, 110,0000 The Regular Army is a well-trained, well-equipped, highly mobile, modern fighting force capable of waging effective positional warfare against France-Vietnamese forces. The Regional Forces are less well equipped and generally recruited regionally for static support of the Regular Army. The People's Militia is locally recruited for village defense and small-scale guerrilla action. Be Security of Controlled Areas The Viet Minh armed forces of 315,000 men, which are employed both for the defense and security of controlled areas and for offensive opera- tions based on these areas, are distributed within the \"DRV\"-controlled areas as follows, 174,000 men in Tonkin; 80,000 men in Central Vietnam; 46,000 in South Vietnam; 10,000 in Cambodia; and 5,000 in Laos. The population in Communist-controlled areas has generally been stable and tightly-controlled. Disturbances and riots have, however, occasionally been reported, particularly in the strongly Catholic Vinh and Thanh Hoa regions of North Central Vietnam. Civil administration in \"DRV\"-oontrolled zones is in the hands of administrative cadres directly responsible to the \"DRV\" Ministry of Interior. It is logical to suppose, although no information is available on the subject, that the Viet Minh armed forces have at least temporary control of civil administration in regions only recently conquered. This control is presumably exercised by political and administrative cadres of the Army. C. Military Support Organizations \"DRV\" supply, cgmmunioations, and intelligence organizations are highly developed units operating at all levels of the military administra- tion. Their authority is derived from Directorates attached to the General Staff of the army. Information concerning the strength of the various support organizations is not available although these organiza- tions may be assumed to be quite large. Their networks are known to embrace all of Vietnam, including Franco-Vietnamese areas. Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4 In view of the fact that North Vietnam is not only the theater of the most active military operations but also the seat of the \"DRV\" govern- ment, supply, communications, and liaison functions are presumably con- oentrated in that area. Intelligence activities are probably concentrated in urban centers (chiefly Hanoi and Saigon) as strongly as in strategic military areas. Available reports indicate that \"DRV\" support organizations have achieved a high degree of efficiency. D. External Military Support Reports from a variety of sources, in most cases neither evaluated nor confirmed, suggest that while certain supplies may originate else- where in the Soviet bloc, Communist China is the main source of military support to the Viet Minh. The following types of supplies have been reported:l 1. Arms and ammunitions Mountain guns; anti-aircraft guns; light machine guns; heavy mac ine guns; field guns; howitzers; mortars; rifles, including Browning automatic rifles; pistols; rocket launchers; spare parts; ammunition; TNT and other explosives; fuzes; detonators; projectiles; grenades and grenade throwers; and land mines, 2. Commissary: a. Food: Rice; maize; dried sweet potatoes; cereals; and soy beans, flour. be Clothin : Uniforms; cotton material; army blankets; cloth shoes; rubber shoes; steel helmets. 3. Transportation and communication equipment: Trucks; tires; spare parts; gasoline; oil; kerosene; radio sets and field transmitters, . 4. Others Medical and clinical supplies; X-ray metal testing equip- ment; baTanoes; electric meters; electric drills; files; abrasives; saw Reports often include quantity figures, frequently between. 400 and 800 tons per month. Overlapping of the time periods covered and non-comparable quantity designations (e.g. rounds, cases, or tons of. ammunition), however, make it impossible to arrive.at meaningful totals. Moreover, in a few oases where cross-checking of reported totals has been possible, resultant discrepancies have cast further doubt upon the validity of the figures reported.

E. Military Operations Military operations in Indochina since 1946 have been conducted in virtually all areas of the peninsula, but have.been principally concentra- ted in North Vietnam (Tonkin). There, Communist forces have been, fighting a savage battle for over six years for control of the crucial rice- producing Red River Delta (in which the key cities of Hanoi and Haiphong are located). At present about 174,000 Communist troops are pitted against an estimated 185,000 Franco-Vietnamese forces in the Tonkin region. The principal tactic of the Communist forces has been to harrass the Franco-Vietnamese Army by guerrilla warfare inside the Delta and by massive attacks against isolated French posts and cities outside the Delta.. A turning point in the battle for Tonkin was reached in the fall of 1950, when Viet Minh forces, in quick succession. seized all French posts along-the China border (Langson, Caobang, Laokay), excepting only Monoay in the extreme eastern coastal sector. In the fall of 1952, Communist forces expelled the French from all of Northwest Tonkin, ex- cept Laiohau and Nasan. At this moment, therefore, the Communist forces hold most of Tonkin outside of the key Delta region. The latter, how- ever, in which the vast bulk of Franco-Vietnamese forces is now concen- trated, has been heavily infiltrated by Viet Minh forces and is besieged at its periphery by some five Viet Minh divisions. In Central Vietnam, an estimated 75,000 Franco-Vietnamese forces hold the narrow coastal plain from Faifo to Dong Hoi against some 80,000 Communists who are in control of the remainder of the area. In South Vietnam, an estimated 162,000 Franco-Vietnamese forces control most of the region. but conduct frequent and difficult operations against some 46,000 Viet Minh guerrillas, concentrated principally in the unhealthy and almost impenetrable swamps of the Plaine des Jonas. In Laos and Cambodia, Communist military operations are aprawn limited to small- scale harrassment by guerrilla forces. F. Popular Attitudes. Toward the War The peasantry of Indochina has.borne the main brunt of the long war. The peasantry serves as a reservoir of manpower for the armies involved, performs the coolie duties of supply, engages in sabotage and informer Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4 operations at the order of one side or the other, constructs public works, and -- over and above all this -- produces the food for its own subsistence and that of the non-productive hundreds of thousands in the armies. By this time, the peasantry clearly abhors the war and anxiously hopes for its and. General passivity toward either side in the conflict may in fact be said to characterize the sentiments of the vast majority of Indochina's civilian population. However, passivity is less noticeable, and the effects of political warfare and propaganda by either side are more marked, among city dwellers. The nationalist pretentious of the Viet Minh, rather than Communism itself, continue to hold much appeal for Indochina's urban population, whether inside the Viet Minh zones or in areas of Franco-Vietnamese control. G. Current Strategic and Tactical Objectives of the Communist Insurrection Current strategic and tactical objectives of the Communist insurrection are military and political consolidation over newly-won territories in northwest Tonkin, and intensified penetration by Viet Minh regular forces into the Franco-Vietnamese-held Tonkin Delta area, The \"DRV\" probably will intensify guerrilla warfare in the plateaux region of Central Vietnam as well as in Cambodia and South Vietnam and may also attempt a limited military penetration into Laos. In Central Vietnam, the Communist forces will probably continue to maintain strong pressure against the Franco-Vietnamese forces along the coast. H. Relations of Communist to Non-Communist Insurrectionary Organizations 1. Vietnam. In June 1952 Colonel Trinh Minh The, former Chief of Staff o? _t\" e warmed forces of the autonomous politico-religious Caodaist movement, took to the bush with 2,500 men in South Vietnam to set up \"the National Resistance Front,\" a \"third force\" opposed to both the Viet Minh and the French. Since the spring of 1952, when the French launched military operations against this group, Colonel The has not been heard from and his current whereabouts are unknown. There is no evidence that Colonel The has collaborated with the Viet Minh. 2. Cambodia. In March 1952, Son Ngoc Thanh, a leading Cambodian nationalist, organized a dissident nationalist movement. At first, the activities of this group seen to have been limited to propaganda attacks against the French and Cambodian King. In recent months, broadcasts of Son Ngoo Thanh have been increasingly favorable to the Viet Minh, but the present relationship between these two movements is not clear. 3. Cambodian and Laotian Issaraks. The Cambodian and Laotian Issaraks, under the leadership respectively of Son Ngoo Minh and Prince SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4 Souphanouvong, have been formally allied with the Viet Minh movement since March 1951 when the \"United National Front of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos\" was established. In the past, military efforts of the Issaraks have been for the most part limited to sporadic guerrilla warfare, banditry, and arms smuggling across the Thai border. A closer degree of cooperation seems to have been achieved during the past year between the Viet Minh and the Cambodian and Laotian Issaraks. From 5,000 to 10,000 Viet Minh are reportedly with the Cambodian Issaraks and 5,000 with the Laotian Issaraks. In October and November, 1952, a Laotian delegate accompanied the Viet Minh delegation to the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference in Peiping. In December delegates from both \"Free Cambodia\" and \"Free Laos\". participated in the World Peace Conference in Vienna. I. Capabilities for Expansion and Action in the Near Future Despite the relatively low level of military industrial production within \"DRV\" areas and a reportedly increasing food shortage, the \"DRV\" could probably expand the present scope of its military activities to a limited extent without significantly increased support from Communist China or from other Orbit countries. If, as seems likely, the Issaraks receive greater material assistance and technical advice from the Viet Minh, they would be able to expand their numbers and extend their operations. A. Repressive Capabilities of the Associated States and France French and Associated States policy toward Communism in Indochina is the military destruction of the Viet Minh armed forces and complete eradication of Communist activities and influence throughout the peninsula. No Communist parties, groupings, or organizations are allowed to exist or operate in the Associated States of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. The overt circulation of Communist publications in Franco-Vietnamese controlled areas is prohibited and the possibility of Communist-oriented material appearing in the controlled press is negligible due to tight censorship exercised by both the French and the Associated States. Severe repressive measures are taken against any individuals, groups, or organiza- tions believed operating under Communist. instructions or for Communist SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION purposes. Such repressive measures are expected to continue until -hostilities in Indochina have ceased and internal political stability is assured. They are carried out by civilian security services of France and the Associated States, and insofar as the security of components of the French Union Armed Forces is concerned, by the military intelligence and counter-intelligence services of these forces. At present, the scope and effectiveness of repressive action of which the French and Associated States civilian and military security agencies are capable in Indochina cannot be rated better than fair. By contrast, Communist subversive operations are believed to be, on the whole, vary effective. Possibly the greatest asset of Communist under- ground and subversive organizations of all types lies in the generally apathetic attitude of the Vietnamese population as a whole toward the conflict which is raging in its territory. B. Extent and Effectiveness of Communist Subversive Operations Communist subversive operations in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos fall into two major categories: those carried out by Viet Minh subversive teams and underground networks, and those carried out by clandestine Chinese Communist organizations.. Viet Minh organizations operating in the French and Associated States-controlled zones of Indochina are for the most part responsible directly to the central \"DRV\" government, or its regional representatives. They perform three general types of assigned taskas propaganda; litical, economic, and counter-intelligence;l and 'terrorism and sabotage.# The propaganda function is carried out by teams responsible to the Information Services of the central \"DRV\" government. The total number or size of such teams is unknown,S but their effectiveness seems to have been considerable. Espionage activities are carried out by organizations and units of unknown size believed to be attached to the regional Cong An (Public Security Service) of the Viet Minh, which is the latter's rnal security organization. Espionage agents reportedly are assigned specialized tasks, the most important of which is the infiltration of French and Associated States intelligence and security services. Terrorism and sabotage within the free zones is performed by the Dich Van which in- cludes Death Volunteer Brigades, apparently assigned to opera.e in specific regions. The effectiveness of the,Dich Van is reportedly great; it has seriously disrupted. highway and rail~traff o, damaged industrial and Military espionage is oarr ell out by intelligence organizations responsible to the Directorate for Military Intelligence of the \"DRV\" Armed Forces General Staff. 2. Certain types of sabotage activities are carried out by organized guerrilla and commando units of the Armed Forces. 5. In 1951, ten such Information teams were reported to be operating in South Vietnam. SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION military installations, and organized numerous terroristic acts in major urban centers, the most important of which was the assassination of a number of highly prominent French and Vietnamese civil and military personalities. One of the most successful activities of Viet Minh sub- versive organizations has been the extortion of money from prominent French and Chinese as well as from Vietnamese business firms. Many of these firms regularly pay large sums of \"protection money\" to Viet Minh agents in order to avoid bombing of their premises. The \"DRV\" benefits considerably by the intelligence activities carried out by Chinese Communist underground organizations in the non. Communist zones. Since 1949, the Communist-direoted \"Association for the Liberation of Overseas Chinese in Indochina\" has organized various clandestine student, wen's and workers' organizations in Saigon-Cholon where approximately 80 percent of the total overseas Chinese population of some 800,000 is concentrated. During 1952, the creation of a clandestine \"United Action Committee of Democratic Sino-Vietnamese\" was reported, also in Saigon-Cholon. In North Vietnam, the \"Society of New Chinese Democrats of Hanoi and Haiphong\" reportedly intensified intelligence activities during 1952. The size of these organizations is unknown although it is believed they have been fairly successful in gaining the sympathy of certain of the Chinese population, particularly among students and workers. Specific underground activities which have been reported include extortions of money for the protection of relatives in China, the circula- tion of Communist tracts and publications believed to be for the most part procured in Hong gong, and the placement or pro-Communist instructors in Chinese schools. In Cambodia, the Chinese Communist Party, whose head- quarters reportedly is located in Phnom-Penh, claims the sympathy of 60 percent of the 300,000 overseas Chinese in that country. No information is available concerning its activities or effectiveness. V. COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN LABOR In \"DRV\" controlled areas, all workers in key industries are con- trolled by Communist elements, although the number of Party members in specific enterprises is unknown. In the Associated States of Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, the number of Communists in key industries, if any, is unknown. In \"DRV\" areas of Vietnam, the General Confederation of Labor, which is controlled by the communist Party, claimed \"300,000 members\" in 1952. The Confederation is composed of numerous affiliated trade unions organized at provincial levels throughout Vietnam. It has been reported that although not all of its directors are Party members, those exercising any real authority are. The Confederation has been affiliated with the World Federation of Trade Unions (wFTU) since the former's organization in 1946'and has been represented at VPFTU Conferences since 1948. In addition to the General Confederation of Labor, the Viet Minh reportedly organized a Trade Union Council in 1950 to embrace \"intellectuals and civil servants.\" SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION - 13 - No further information is available concerning this Council. In the free areas of Vietnam, labor organizations were prohibited until the promulgation of the Labor Code on November 16, 1952. The principal Vietnamese labor union, which until last November operated as an association, is the Christian Confederation Vietnamienne du Travail Chretien, reported to have 5,000 members. num er of civil servants in both the French and Vietnamese administrations, belong to Force Ouvriere which has its headquarters in France. Although pro sions of Me ew Labor Code in Vietnam do not extend to the overseas Chinese population, Chinese labor groups have for some time been loosely associated in a Federation of Chinese Mutual Aid Societies. The 19 organizations comprising this Federation claim an aggregate membership of some 11,000. No information is available on Communist infiltration of, or in- fluence in, these labor unions in Franco-Vietnamese areas of Vietnam. However, the Chinese organizations are the most likely to have been infiltrated or influenced by Communists, VI. COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN SOCIAL, CULTURAL, AND PROFESSIONAL O G IZ TIONS In both the free and the Communist zones, the Lien Viet (National Unity) Front has developed an extensive and intricate netwozk of front organizations to enlist the support of the peasants and special interest groups for the \"resistance against French aggression.' The leaders of the front organizations are believed to be mostly well-indoctrinated and capable party cadres, many of whom work in more than one organization. What appear to be the most important front organizations are listed belows 1. The Union of Vietnamese Youth claims a membership of 2,500,000 and has been affiliated with the World Federation of Democratic Youth since 1947. 2. The Union of Vietnamese Students and Pupils has been affiliated with the International Students Union since 1948. 3. The Union of Vietnamese Women claimed 3,000,000 members as of 1950. It has been affiliated with the Woman's Inter- national Democratic Federation since 1945. 4. The Catholic Association for National Salvation. 5. The Association of Vietnamese Journalists has been affiliated with the World Federation of Journalists since 1950. 6. The Vietnam World Peace Committee is affiliated with the World Peace Council. SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION - 14 - 7. The Vietnamese Peasants Association for National Salvation. 8. The Sino-Vietnamese friendship Association. 9. The Soviet-Vietnamese Friendship Association? In addition to Viet Minh front organizations, the Chinese Communist Party has organized various youth, workers', women's and cultural under- ground front organizations. These organizations are believed to be strongest in the Saigon-Cholon area of South Vietnam and in the Phnom- Penh region of Cambodia, where the majority of the overseas Chinese residents in Vietnam and Cambodia are located. Many, if not all, of the \"Lien Viet front groups have effective underground organizations within -We areas under Franoo-Vietnamese con- trol. Little information is available concerning non-Communist social, cultural, or professional organizations which may have been infiltrated by Communists. VII. COMMUNIST INFILTRATION INTO GOVERNMENT Such infiltration is unquestionably a serious problem for the anti-Communist goverimmentsof the Associated States. Although policy- making bodies of these states are believed to be to a large extent free from subversive Communist personnel and influences, the same can probably not be said with regard to the Armed Services, police and security services, and administrative cadres of the States. Communist subversion is believed to have reached particularly serious proportions within Vietnam's National Army. The Army Officer's Training School at Dalat has been reported strongly infiltrated by Communist elements, and certain Vietnamese troop companies in action in North Vietnam have proved of marked unreliability. The Vietnamese, and even French, security services in North Vietnam are also believed penetrated to some extent by Communist elements. No reports of Communist penetration of government agencies and services in Cambodia and Laos have been received, although it is likely that a limited degree of infiltration may be considered to have occurred. VIII. COMMUNIST INFLUENCE ON PUBLIC OPINION FORMATION In the \"DRV\"-controlled zones of Vietnam, leaders of public pro- paganda organizations are usually Party cadres. Communist propaganda has undoubtedly reached nearly the entire population in these zones, chiefly through the effective organization of mass front organizations and compulsory study groups at provincial and village levels. SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4 SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION In free Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, no known Communists are in a position to influence public opinion. There are probably a considerable number of concealed Viet Minh sympathizers or agents, however, in schools, journalistic, and literary groups. The prohibition of Communist publica- tions, tight press censorship,and the extremely limited number of radio sets among the population in Franco-Vietnamese controlled areas have tended to insulate the population from Communist publications and broad- casts. Nevertheless, it is likely that Communist influence has been spread fairly successfully through clandestine operations and through direct contact of many individuals with underground Viet Minh agents. IX. COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF NON-COMMUNIST POLITICIE S The most important non-Communist nationalist organizations and parties in Indochina are the Dai Viet Party, the Cao Dai politico- religious group, the Vietnam a ona iat Party (VN9DD). and the Catholics in Vietnam, and the Democratic Party in Cambodia. Although information is generally lacking on their membership, these parties and groups are thought to embrace several hundred thousand members. The extent of Communist influence in these organizations is unknown, but is not be- lieved to be large due to the strongly anti-Communist, although clearly pro-nationalist, sentiments of most of their leadership. Branches of the above-mentioned organizations are still in some instances allowed to operate in \"DRV\"-controlled zones, where the Catholics and some Caodaiats, for example, maintain social organizations. However, the Communists have undoubtedly strongly infiltrated these branches and probably control them completely. The same would be true for nominally non-Communist parties and organizations existing only in the \"DRV$G Zones, such as the Vietnam Democratic Party and the Socialist Party, which the Communists continue to tolerate in order to bolster their nationalist pretensions. A. Newspapers and Periodicals Listed below are the newspapers and periodicals known to have been published by the Viet Minh in 1951 or 1952. Where known, the frequency of publication and the principal area of circulation are in- dicated. These publications are also clandestinely distributed in Franco-Vietnamese-controlled areas by Viet Minh underground organize. tions.

Radio The \"DRV\" controls the following broadcasting stations which have regularly scheduled programs beamed to Indochina and to Southeast Asiat 1. Voice of Vietnam is regarded as the official government station. It is reportedly located in the Vinh area. News is broadcast daily to Indochina and Southeast Asia in French, English, Tonkinese, Thai, Mandarin, and Cantonese. 2. Voice of South Vietnam has tentatively been located north o gon, roe caste three programs daily of news and commentary in Cochinohinese and one in Mandarin. 3. Voice of Nambo is reputedly located in the Mekong Delta area. carries four programs of news and commentary daily, one each in Cochinchinese, French, Cantonese, and Cambodian. In Cambodia, the Voice of Issarak Cambodia is operated by the Issarak leader Son Ngoc Minh. One-half hour of news and comment is broadcast daily in Cambodian. Radio Moscow broadcasts one hour daily in Tonkinese and occasionally in Coo no nese. Radio Peking broadcasts one hour daily in Tonkinese, and twice daily for 5 to 35 minutes in Thai. Reception of the Thai language program is reported to be poor. Considering the small number of radio receiving sets in the Associated States, it is likely that Communist radio broadcasts reach only a very limited audience and achieve only limited propaganda effects outside the Communist zones. Within these zones, however, they are used as an extremely important,and probably effective, means of disseminating propaganda and official orders to the population. XI. FINANCIAL CONDITION The \"DRV\" authorities collect both direct and indirect taxes, many of them in kind, impose \"duties\" on goods entering Conmumist zones from the Franco-Vietnamese zones, and exact \"voluntary\"donations through various \"emulation campaigns.\" The amount of revenue thus collected is unknown, as is the size of any subsidies from international Communist organizations, donations or credits by Soviet or Satellite governments, or dues from party-controlled labor unions and fronts. Nor is any information available on the amount of revenue collected through extortion of Vietnamese, French, and Chinese business firms in the non-Communist zones. XII. SOVIET SATELLITE OFFICIAL ASSETS There are no Soviet bloc diplomatic establishments, trade, or cultural missions in free Vietnam, Cambodia, or Laos. SECRET - SECURITY INFORMATION Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP86B00269R000800080001-4 - 18 - Although the USSR, Communist China, and other satellite countries have recognized the \"DRV\", they have not established diplomatic missions there. However, Communist China has sent various temporary military and economic missions to the Viet Minh. During 1952 a 50-man Chinese cultural mission was reportedly sent to Thai Nguyen in North Vietnam for the purpose of establishing political liaison with the \"DRV\" govern- ment, and an economic mission is said to have been-not up also in North Vietnam to study economic resources. Current estimates place the number of more or less permanent Chinese Communist personnel-- technicians, instructors, military and political advisors -- with the Viet Minh at approximately 5,000. All Chinese Communist Missions are surrounded by seoreoy. It is believed that contact between Chinese personnel and natives is held to a minimum. A Sino-Vietnamese Friendship Association and a Soviet-Vietnam Friendship Association were organised inside the \"DRV\" in early 1950. Both organizations are associated with the \"Lien Viet Front\" and have established branches throughout \"DRV\"-oontrolled areas of Vietnam. These organizations are reported to have clandestine branches in the free areas, particularly in the Saigon-Cholon district. Propaganda committees areireported to have been established at the branch levels of both Associations. In addition to carrying out regular propaganda activities, these associations are responsible for sponsoring celebrations of major Chinese Communist and Soviet holidays. The Sino-Vietnamese Friendship Association has published a journal, China-Vietnam, since May 1950. XIII. COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS While it is not known to what extent, if any, the Viet Minh move- ment may have been aided materially by international Communist organiza- tions, it has been granted a significant extent of moral support by such organizations through invitations to participate, often in a glorified role, in Communist international conferences. In the past two years, delegates from the \"DRV\" and in two instances from \"Free Cambodia\" and \"Free Laos\" have attended the following international Communist meetingss Meeting Date Size of representation from Indochina Vienna Peace Congress December 1952 11 (including 2 from Cambodia and 1 from Laos) Asian and Pacific Peace October- 14 (including 2 Conference, Peiping November 1952 from Laos) Approved"
