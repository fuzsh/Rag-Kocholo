        "text": "Today, I attended Indus Food at the Greater Noida Expo center, and it is impressively vast, spanning across 8 halls. The sheer size explains why it spans over 3 days. Covering the entire Food Expo in a single day would be a challenging feat, given its comprehensive representation of technology (processing, packaging, supply chain, etc.) and the numerous stalls from food companies. Witnessing the multitude of companies present and the bustling crowd at the expo was truly remarkable. It highlights the resurgence of food as a central focus and the notable innovation and localization taking place in the food industry. We are seeking a transformative revolution in the realm of food, driven by the Indian consumer's desire for increased variety, experimentation and freshness. Another intriguing aspect was the presence of liquor companies that set up stalls, allowing attendees to sample their offerings just like any other food company. Undoubtedly, this became a highlight for many participants, and it was a novel experience for me as well! ü•Ç Any founders in the food segment - Indus Expo is worth a visit and see learn and experience the essence of Food habits and Innovation already in motion. #food\n\nIn #India, mithais‚Äîsweet confections‚Äîhold a cherished place in #culinary culture, akin to an extra passenger fitting into a full car.
