        "text": "Today, I attended Indus Food at the Greater Noida Expo center, and it is impressively vast, spanning across 8 halls. The sheer size explains why it spans over 3 days. Covering the entire Food Expo in a single day would be a challenging feat, given its comprehensive representation of technology (processing, packaging, supply chain, etc.) and the numerous stalls from food companies. Witnessing the multitude of companies present and the bustling crowd at the expo was truly remarkable. It highlights the resurgence of food as a central focus and the notable innovation and localization taking place in the food industry. We are seeking a transformative revolution in the realm of food, driven by the Indian consumer's desire for increased variety, experimentation and freshness. Another intriguing aspect was the presence of liquor companies that set up stalls, allowing attendees to sample their offerings just like any other food company. Undoubtedly, this became a highlight for many participants, and it was a novel experience for me as well! 🥂 Any founders in the food segment - Indus Expo is worth a visit and see learn and experience the essence of Food habits and Innovation already in motion. #food\n\nIn #India, mithais—sweet confections—hold a cherished place in #culinary culture, akin to an extra passenger fitting into a full car. These sweets are not just desserts but symbols of #celebration and tradition, accompanying every meal. Despite a growing #trend towards health-conscious eating, mithais continue to thrive, evolving with the times. Today, the Indian chocolate #market is witnessing a sweet revolution. Traditional mithais are getting a #modern makeover through fusion creations and functional #innovations. Fusion mithais, like gulab jamun waffles or jalebi-filled pastries, showcase the versatility of #Indian sweets, bridging culinary cultures. On the other hand, functional mithais, sweetened with jaggery or enriched with superfoods, offer guilt-free indulgence. Personalization and #sustainability are driving forces behind mithais in the modern age. Customizable mithais cater to individual #preferences, while sustainable practices, such as #biodegradable packaging and natural food colors, align with environmental consciousness. These changes reflect a growing #demand for personalized, eco-friendly products. In the fast-paced 2020s, mithais have adapted to offer #convenience without compromising tradition. Advancements in #food #technology have led to longer shelf lives for mithais, reducing food waste. Moreover, single-serving sizes and impulse-buying options make mithais accessible on-the-go, fitting into modern lifestyles. Despite these innovations, the core of mithais remains unchanged—quality. Consumers today #value the excellence of ingredients, ensuring that the authentic #taste of India's sweet heritage is preserved. As mithais evolve to meet the demands of the modern era, they continue to be a #sweet reminder of timeless joys and traditions. “The fusion of traditional flavors with modern twists and the focus on health and sustainability are key trends shaping the market. This is sign of future growth in the market as the mithais' timeless appeal with their adaptability in a changing world.\" Sachin Salunkhe Chairman, Eumsig Foodworks Pvt.

Their commitment to value for money, savory food, and high hygiene standards made MTR the hottest spot in the city. After facing challenges, including the emergency that led to the inception of MTR Foods, the brand pivoted to offer packaged foods, which became an instant hit. Over the years, MTR Foods continued to innovate, expand its product line, and penetrate new markets, both domestically and internationally. The brand's success can be attributed to its unwavering obsession with quality, hygiene, and convenience, as well as its focus on innovation and finding product relevance amidst constantly evolving consumer needs. This remarkable journey from a small restaurant to a multi-crore brand is a testament to the enduring legacy of MTR Foods. Today, the brand offers 145 products, 400 SKUs, and over 3,000 unique recipes, spanning six verticals Some key highlights of MTR Foods include: · Masala and Spices: Leading the portfolio with 50% market share · Sweets (Mixes + RTE): Accounting for 17% of the total business · Breakfast + Chilled: Contributing 14% to the brand's revenue · Badam Milk (Canned + Mix): Making up 7% of the portfolio · Ready-to-Eat: Representing 8% of the product range · Other Categories: Accounting for 4% of the offerings In a recent move, Orkla ASA consolidated its three business units in India – MTR, Eastern, and International Business (IB) – into a single entity named Orkla India. The Eastern business is expected to contribute approximately 45% of the total business, while MTR is expected to contribute around 37%, and international businesses for around 18% MTR Foods has also set up separate facilities for sweets and chilled businesses, with an investment of ₹10 crore each.
