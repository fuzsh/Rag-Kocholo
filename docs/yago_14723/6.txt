Mozart is a 1955 Austrian drama film directed by Karl Hartl and starring Oskar Werner, Johanna Matz and Gertrud KÃ¼ckelmann.[1] It is also known by the alternative title The Life and Loves of Mozart. It was entered into the 1956 Cannes Film Festival.[2] The plot explores the mental state of Mozart during production of his final opera The Magic Flute. Werner's portrayal of Mozart was unusual for the time in playing him as a cheerful and easygoing young man, reflecting the postwar optimism of the newly restored Austrian Republic.[3]

The film's sets were designed by the art directors Werner Schlichting and Wolf Witzemann.
