        "text": "German postcard by Film-Foto-Verlag, nr. A 3756/1, 1941-1944. Photo: Star-Foto Atelier/Tobis.\n\nRene Deltgen (1909-1979) was a theatre and film actor from Luxembourg, who spent most of his career in Germany. As the unscrupulous adventurer or charming lover he became a popular star in action and adventure films of the Third Reich. During his long career he appeared in more than 70 films.\n\nRenatus Heinrich Deltgen was born in Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg; in 1909. From 1927 he attended the Schauspielschule Koln (the acting school in Cologne) and here he learned to speak the German language accentless. From 1929 on he got regular engagements at the city theaters in Cologne and Frankfurt a.M., and the actor Eugen Klopfer brought him to Berlin where he soon became a popular actor in classical productions among others at the Volksbuhne. Deltgen made his film debut with Das Madchen Johanna/Joan the Maid (1935, Gustav Ucicky). His attractrive appearance and his intensive performance soon led to hero roles in action and adventure films like Kautschuk/The Green Hell (1938, Arthur Maria Rabenalt). In her study Nazi cinema as enchantment: the politics of entertainment in the Third Reich (2004), Mary-Elizabeth O’Brien writes that: “Kautschuk tells the story of how the British broke the Brazilian monopoly on natural rubber (caoutchouk) and contains many hallmarks of German adventure films of the late 1930’s. (…) Kautschuk was marketed as a sensational and historically accurate portrayal of one man’s heroical battle to win natural resources for his country.” By the time Deltgen starred in Kautschuk with Gustav Diessl, he had already become a star as the ‘vigorous daredevil’, a maverick who went after whatever he wanted and teetered on the edge of death. He played a spy who met his heroic death with a smile in Port Arthur (1936, Nicolas Farkas) with AdolphWohlbruck (aka Anton Walbrook), and Achtung Feind hort mit!/Beware! The Enemy Is Listening! (1940, Arthur Maria Rabbenalt), he played a fortune hunter in Kongo-Express/ Congo Express (1939, Eduard von Borsody) and Brand im Ozean/Fire on the Ocean (1939, Gunther Rittau), and a courageous soldier in Urlaub auf Ehrenwort/Furlough on Word of Honor (1937, Karl Ritter) and Fronttheater (1942, Arthur Maria Rabbenalt). Deltgen’s roles called for a combination of strength, daring and self-sacrifice, which made a highly sumpathetic and representative hero of the Cinema of the Third Reich.\n\nRene Deltgen was a popular star of the Third Reich and he enjoyed official support. At the ceremonies surrounding Hitler’s fiftieth birthday in 1939, the fuhrer honoured Deltgen with the title of Staatsschauspieler (National Actor). Besides his action roles he could play other characters now and then. In the crime drama Die drei Codonas/The Three Codonas (1940, Arthur Maria Rabenalt) he was an artist who was broken by his conflicts, in Das grosse Spiel/The Big Game (1942, Robert A. Stemmle) he played a soccer player and in Wen die Gotter lieben/The Mozart Story (1942, Karl Hartl) he impersonated Ludwig van Beethoven with Hans Holt starring as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. After the war Rene Deltgen first had to earn his living as a chef de cuisine and as a horse trainer at a circus for the time being. When he teamed up with actor Karl John for a cabaret show he could work on stage again and he performed for the allied troops. Engagements at at the Stadttheater in Constance in 1946 and the Stadtischen Buhnen in Cologne in 1947 followed before he was offered a film role again in 1949. He played the inwardly torn actor Stefan Gorgas in Nachtwache/Keepers of the Night (1949, Harald Braun) starring Luise Ullrich and Hans Nielsen. Nachtwache was the winner of the Golden Palm Award at the Cannes Film Festival. This part was soon followed by the melodrama Tromba/Tromba, the Tiger Man (1949, Helmut Weiss) with Angelika Hauff, in which he played a circus tiger trainer, who utilizes hypnotism to keep his beasts in line, and this works so well that he also begins mesmerizing women to do his bidding.\n\nRene Deltgen played many successful film parts during the 1950’s. He appeared as the Soviet secret agent officer Kazanow opposite Ivan Desny in Weg ohne Umkehr/No Way Back (1953, Victor Vicas, Beate von Molo), which won the Bundesfilmpreis 1953 and a Golden Globe Award as best Foreign Film. He also appeared as Furst Ramigani in Fritz Lang’s double films Der Tiger von Eschnapur/The Tiger of Eschnapur (1959) and Das indische Grabmal/The Indian Tomb (1959). In these films he played once more the earlier cliche role of a brutal, cynical go-getter. Among his other films were Das letzte Rezept/Desires (1952, Rolf Hansen), Unter den tausend Laternen/Under Thousand Lanterns (1952, Erich Engel) with Michel Auclair, Der letzte Sommer/The Last Summer (1954, Harald Braun) starring Hardy Kruger, and the drama Hotel Adlon (1955, Josef von Baky). During the 1960’s he also worked often for television and he became a"
