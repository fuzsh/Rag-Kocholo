        "text": "Reminiscing in Bergman on Bergman:\n\n'I remember how, afterwards, when they saw the film, the head office told me it had all been a dreadful miscalculation. The film wasn't funny. It was stylised. It was too lame, and too long. They'd also tumbled to the fact that it was in period costume, and just then costume films weren't doing any box-office.'\n\nIn Cannes 1956, Smiles of a Summer Night was awarded Prix de l'Humour Poétique. Bergman himself did not know that the film was represented at the festival:\n\n'I was sitting in the shithouse reading the papers. And then I read: Swedish film gets prize at Cannes, Swedish film causes sensation, or something of that sort. What the devil film can that be, I wondered. When I saw it was Smiles of a Summer Night I couldn't believe my eyes.'\n\nIn 1973, Smiles of a Summer Night was reworked into a Broadway musical called A Little Night Music, with lyrics by Hugh Wheeler and music by Stephen Sondheim. It premiered in New York in February 1973 and later played at a number of Swedish venues. In 1977, the musical was made into a film in Austria (!), directed by Harold Prince and starring Elizabeth Taylor as Desirée Armfeldt (Eva Dahlbeck's character). More meritorious is A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy from 1982, Woody Allen's rework of Smiles of a Summer Night.\n\nThe first of Bergman's films to bring the director international success, due to its exposure at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival, was inspired by Marivaux’s comedies and Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream, and it inspired, in turn, both Stephen Sondheim’s musical A Little Night Music (1973) and Woody Allen’s A Midsummer Night’s Sex Comedy (1982). It is far from being the only allusion to the Swedish master in Allen’s work. The American director referred to Bergman as \"probably the greatest film artist since the invention of the motion picture camera (Chaplin, 1988) and admired “this combination of intellectual artist and film technician”. (Time, 2007) Allen subsequently worked with two of Bergman’s collaborators – Sven Nykvist on four films (Another woman, 1987; Crimes and Misdemeanors, 1989; New York Stories, 1989; Celebrity, 1998), and Max von Sydow, who played the part of the tormented artist in Hannah and Her Sisters (1986), as an implied reference to his roles in The Magician and Hour of the Wolf.\n\nIn a nod to Sawdust and Tinsel (1953), the character played by Woody Allen in Hannah and Her Sisters (1986) wants to commit suicide at the end, but due to perspiration, the gun slips and the ball hits a mirror instead of him. As in Bergman’s film, an insistent ticking is heard during the whole scene.\n\n© Charlotte Renaud\n\n[The \"Legacy\" section is written and compiled by Charlotte Renaud. Look here for heirs to other Bergman films.]\n\nFredrik: Desirée, how I longed for you.\n\nFredrik: One's debut is always a miserable farce. Fortunately, women don't take it half as serious as we do. Or mankind would die out.\n\nHenrik: You joke about everything.\n\nFredrik: You will to, when you see your own folly, and the triviality of your illusions.\n\nDesirée: Fredrik, you old goat, you bastard, you long-nosed camel. You're looking unusually human.\n\nFredrik: Thanks for the compliment.\n\nDesirée: Is your large pectoral aching? The heart, as mortals call it.\n\nFredrik: That's not why I came here.\n\nDesirée: No, it was always your noblest parts that brought you to Desirée.\n\nFredrik: How could a woman ever love a man, can you tell me that?\n\nDesirée: A woman's view is seldom aesthetic. And you can always turn the light out.\n\nDesirée: Were you going to marry me?\n\nFredrik: Maybe I wasn't just then.\n\nDesirée: See. Besides, your valiantly amused yourself with scores of other women.\n\nFredrik: But you were the headquarters.\n\nDesirée: How long will you stay?\n\nCarl-Magnus: I have 20 hours' permission. Three hours to come here, nine with you, five with my wife, and three back. That makes 20 hours. Would you mind if I change into my dressing-gown?\n\nCarl-Magnus: I also see my nightshirt has proved useful. It fits you well, I hope. Not too small, not too large.\n\nFredrik: Very well, thank you. Not too small and not to large.\n\nCarl-Magnus: I can tolerate my wife's infidelity, but if anyone touches my mistress, I become a tiger!\n\nCharlotte: So, my dear Carl-Magnus, you consider all women seducible?\n\nCarl-Magnus: Absolutely. Age, class, conditions or looks are of no consequence.\n\nDesirée: Even married women?\n\nCarl-Magnus: Not least the married.\n\nDesirée's mother: In that case, your main ally is not your own assets, but the married woman's marital ennui.\n\nHenrik: Oh Lord. If your world is full of sin, I want sin. Let the birds build nest in my hair. Take my wretched virtue from me. I can't stand it any longer."
