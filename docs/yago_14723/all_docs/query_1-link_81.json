        "text": "Mozart's opera The Magic Flute (or Die Zauberflöte in the original German) was premiered in Vienna, just two months before the composer's premature death in 1791. The German libretto was written by Emanuel Schikaneder, the theatre's director and the very first actor to step into the role of Papageno.\n\nThose unfamiliar with the opera as a whole should at least recognise its most-famous aria: in Act II, the Queen of the Night boasts dizzying vocal heights of repeated high Fs that demonstrate the character's intimidating presence.\n\nThe Magic Flute is a Singspiel, meaning it consists of both music and spoken dialogue, though the latter is often omitted in audio recordings. Of the recordings that exist, and there are many to consider, there are several that stand out as consistent fan favourites. From the mid-20th century, traditional recordings by conductors such as Otto Klemperer (EMI, 1964), Ferenc Fricsay (Deutsche Grammophon, 1955) and Karl Böhm (Deutsche Grammophon, 1964) are blessed with evergreen popularity. Similarly, recordings from the 1990s by William Christie (Erato, 1990), Arnold Östman (L'Oiseau Lyre, 1993) and John Eliot Gardiner (Archiv, 1996) have many Magic Flute enthusiasts reaching for them time and time again.\n\nWhile each of these older recordings have their merits and remain in demand for good reasons, the list below details the best of the latest recordings, all produced in the 21st century.\n\nWhat is the plot of Mozart's opera The Magic Flute?\n\nWhen Prince Tamino is rescued from a monster by three ladies, he is given a picture of Pamina, daughter of the Queen of Night, and instantly falls head over heels for her. Unfortunately, the lady of Tamino's affection is held captive by a sorcerer named Sarastro with his henchman Monostatos. Armed with the eponymous magic flute and a reluctant companion, the bird-catcher Papageno, Tamino sets off on a rescue mission but soon learns that not everything is as it seems... What follows is several trials to prove Tamino's worth and to reach a happy ending.\n\nThe best recordings of Mozart's opera The Magic Flute\n\nRoyal Opera House (2008)\n\nWill Hartmann, Dorothea Röschmann , Diana Damrau, Franz-Josef Selig, Simon Keenlyside, Ailish Tynan, Adrian Thompson, Thomas Allen; Royal Opera House/Sir Colin Davis, dir. David McVicar Opus Arte DVD: OA0885D, Blu-ray: OABD7002D (2003)\n\nThe highlight of this filmed production is the performance by Simon Keenlyside as Papageno. Critic Max Loppert writes: 'Simon Keenlyside’s Papageno offers none of the vaudeville high jinks traditionally associated with the role: he brings to its comedy a Pierrot lunaire-like poetry, precisely achieved down to the smallest detail. This Papageno arouses both delight and poignant emotions, and his singing is wonderfully strong and true in style.'\n\nAlso noteworthy is Diana Damrau's 'sharply intelligent' interpretation of the Queen of the Night.

In no other recording I know are you so aware of the originality of Mozart’s scoring, whether in the austere, hieratic colouring (trombones and basset-horns to the fore) of the music for Sarastro and the priests at the start of Act II, the manic glitter of Monostatos’s aria or the ethereal, other-worldly sonorities in the music for the Three Boys.'

For this is a total experience, perfectly tailored for private listening. René Jacobs thinks of it as a Hörspiel: it’s a play to be heard – and I don’t know a recorded Zauberflöte more thrillingly alive with fantasy, profoundly musical imagination, real magic, and real fun too.'

Simon McBurney Opus Arte DVD: OA 1122D; Blu-ray: OABD 7133D (2014)\n\n'Freshness of vision, emotional openness, genuine ensemble theatricality, a robustly physical sense of adventure humorous and serious (but never portentous) by turns, and an underlying directorial trust in Mozart’s music: these qualities stay with me most strongly after two viewings of this DVD, among the most rewarding experiences of the opera I’ve had in nearly five decades of Magic Flute encounters.'

But she never relies merely on technical virtuosity. Dessay brings a hard, imperious edge to the Queen of the Night’s arias – with a real glint of venom in ‘Der Hölle Rache’'.
