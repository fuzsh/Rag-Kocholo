To this end, he allies himself with the theater director Emanuel Schikaneder to compose an opera for his Freihaustheater, The Magic Flute. The opera is intended to be a homage to the ideals of the Freemasons. While Mozart’s wife Constanze was on a cure, Mozart worked on the opera with Schikaneder. The young singer of Pamina, Annie Gottlieb, has long admired Mozart. During rehearsals, Mozart falls in love with her too. But shortly before the premiere of the opera, an impresario appears who wants to engage Annie for an international tour. Annie’s father wants her to take the opportunity. Mozart also understands what an opportunity the tour is for the young singer and sends her on the journey against her will. But Annie hesitates. Shortly before leaving, after a conversation with Mozart’s doctor, Annie realizes how badly Mozart’s health is already affected and that she will never see him again if she should join this year-long tour. Annie stays and thus also opposes her father’s will, who then rejects her.\n\nMozart, already marked by his illness, and Annie experience a brief period of happiness that comes to an end with Mozart’s sudden death.\n\n(Visited 452 times, 1 visits today)"
