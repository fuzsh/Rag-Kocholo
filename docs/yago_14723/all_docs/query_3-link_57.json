They master the challenge of Penderecki's piece for 48 strings magnificently, but in the Wolfsschlucht scene they show that Weber's score already provides enough opportunity for effective moments of tension.\"\n\nPress review: FUCKING ÅMÅL (State Opera Hamburg)\n\nPress review: Lachesis (Landestheater Linz)\n\nFour opera world premieres in the 2021/22 season\n\nI am very happy and proud to conduct four opera world premieres this season.
