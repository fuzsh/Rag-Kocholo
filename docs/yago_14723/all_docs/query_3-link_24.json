        "text": "Music has rarely been the subject of analysis in environmental art forms, from film to post-apocalyptic fiction. This article seeks to fill that gap and shows how music functions between word and image, using three case studies: The Crossroads Project, a lecture-performance series on climate crisis; Trinity, a short documentary video on the history of nuclear testing; and Lidia Yuknavitch's The Book of Joan, a dystopian novel with music at its core. In all three examples, music does not work as atmospheric background but rather as an active mediator in its own right. Entering the spaces between text or spoken word and image with unexpected material presence, it can help to open the audience toward greater urgency or inquiry about climate disruption; it can accumulate intensity as viewers watch and hear data on nuclear testing; it can even incite violence within a narrative, both thematically and in the text itself, as Sybille Krämer has noted in her work on performativity. Though activist art can easily become baldly manipulative, music can \" expose \" its hearers (to use Stacy Alaimo's and Jean-Luc Nancy's term) to planetary threats in a way that fosters critical, not just sentimental or fearful, response.\n\n‘The Ethics of Realism may be too tame a title for the rambunctious scholarship this book contains. Lúcia Nagib has a sharp eye for what, through her lens, become stupefying motifs and moments within films that she just as sharply cuts out of the vast herd of movies. You can sense her pleasure at relaying to us the cinematic power she has found in cast-off ‘failures’ like I am Cuba or that she resuscitates in films we thought we knew , such as The400 Blows. Ultimately tying these to historical struggles of filmmakers and the societies they worked within, she does in fact make good on her title. This is a truly high-minded argument for cinema as the conscience of the past century. The films Nagib illuminates made and kept promises to the world they came from. This book honours the importance, not just the beauty of cinematic art.’ Dudley Andrew ‘Lúcia Nagib’s book World Cinema and the Ethics of Realism injects new vitality and energy into some important but familiar debates in film theory. In the first instance, her surprising selection of films challenges existing concepts of world cinema. More radically, however, these films have a unifying aesthetic out of which Nagib’s own approach to realism comes into focus. These are films that privilege rawness and physicality, that place extreme demands on performers and producers, and inescapably work with the reality of event as well as the recording function of the medium itself. Nagib’s grounding for the aesthetic of realism is based on an ethical commitment to the living, temporal, spatial and dramatic exchange between the camera as mechanism and the extreme event it is filming. Nagib has successfully turned the theoretical kaleidoscope, reconfiguring the crucial concept of realism, its significance for film theory, into new, exciting, sometimes shocking, patterns of thought and perception.’ Laura Mulvey World Cinema and the Ethics of Realism is a highly original study. Traditional views of cinematic realism usually draw on the so-called classical cinema and its allegiance to narrative mimesis, but Nagib challenges this, drawing instead on the filmmaker’s commitment to truth and to the film medium’s material bond with the real. Starting from the premise that world cinema’s creative peaks are governed by an ethics of realism, Nagib conducts comparative case studies picked from world new waves, such as the Japanese New Wave, the French nouvelle vague, the Cinema Novo, the New German Cinema, the Russo-Cuban Revolutionary Cinema, the Portuguese self-performing auteur and the Inuit Indigenous Cinema. In all cases, making films is making history, entailing change in the real life of casts and crews, and therefore producing, rather than reproducing, reality. Drawing upon Badiou and Rancière, World Cinema and the Ethics of Realism revisits and reformulates several fundamental concepts in film studies, such as illusionism, identification, apparatus, alienation effects, presentation and representation. Its groundbreaking scholarship takes film theory in a bold new direction.\n\nAntonin Artaud’s concept of a theater of cruelty and his scarce writings on cinema have profoundly infl uenced fi lm scholarship, especially in view of the large number of contemporary European fi lms that employ images of extreme violence and utilize an aesthetics of visual unpleasure. But is the politics of the Artaudian aesthetic to be reduced to the reproduction of gory images of revolting violence? This article explores the politics of Artaudian cinema by going back to Artaud’s writings on the medium and comparing them to Brecht’s writings on fi lm. The focus of this article is twofold: the fi rst part goes back to Artaud’s writings and investigates the politics of the cinema of cruelty, while the second uses as case studies Jonas Mekas’s The Brig (1964) and Costas Zapas’s The Rebellion of Red Maria (2011). The fi rst fi lm is a screen adaptation of a performance renowned for reconciling the theater of cruelty with a political context, while the second is a contemporary paradigm of a fi lm that draws on the Artaudian and Brechtian traditions with a view to responding to the political concerns of the present."
