        "text": "Götz Spielmann retrospective at the Örökmozgó Film Museum\n\nBudapest, October 22nd 2009 – To coincide with Austria’s forthcoming national holiday, the Örökmozgó Film Museum in Budapest will devote two weeks to Austrian film-making.\n\nOn 16 October 2009, the Austrian film weeks, organised by the Austrian Cultural Forum in Budapest in cooperation with the Hungarian National Film Archives, were opened with the award-winning film Revanche by Götz Spielmann, which received an Oscar nomination this year. The director himself was present. In the subsequent discussion with the curator of the film cycle, Enikö Löwensohn, he explained the background and technical details of the film. The synchronous translation into Hungarian heightened the audience’s interest in the film and encouraged their participation in the subsequent discussion with the director.\n\nIn addition to earlier films by Götz Spielmann, such as The Neighbour (1992), Antares (2004) and Erwin and Julia (1990), the Austrian film week will also show films by other directors, such as Stefan Ruzowitzky’s The One-Seventh Farmers and The Counterfeiters, Karl Hartl’s Mozart (1955), Michael Haneke’s Caché and Hubert Sauper’s Darwin’s Nightmare. The film week will end on 27 October."
