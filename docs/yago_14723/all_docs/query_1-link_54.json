        "text": "Wagner College Theatre continues its golden jubilee season with Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler’s Tony Award-winning masterwork, “A Little Night Music,” with performances Oct. 11-14 in the Main Hall auditorium. Performances are Thursday through Saturday at 8 p.m., with matinees Saturday and Sunday at 2 p.m.\n\n“A Little Night Music,” which features a score by Stephen Sondheim and book by Hugh Wheeler, is directed by Tony winner and WCT professor Michele Pawk, choreographed by Carissa Bellando ’05 with music direction by Lauri Young (WCT’s “Nine”).\n\nNot Mozart’s “Eine kleine Nachtmusik,” but Ingmar Bergman’s 1955 film, “Smiles of a Summer Night,” served as the inspiration for “A Little Night Music.” Full of witty and heartbreakingly moving moments of adoration, regret and desire, “A Little Night Music” is a musical celebration of love among mismatched lovers in turn-of-the-20th-century Sweden. “A Little Night Music” features “Send in the Clowns,” Sondheim’s most popular song.\n\nA Sondheim veteran, Michele Pawk directed Wagner’s 2014 production of “Merrily We Roll Along,” and she was featured as Gussie in the first New York revival of “Merrily.” Pawk has been featured in regional productions of “Bounce” (Nellie), “Company” (Joanne), “A Little Night Music” (Countess Charlotte Malcolm), and “Into the Woods” (the Witch).\n\nThe Wagner College Theatre production boasts a cast of 17 and features theater performance majors Isabelle Miller as Desiree Armfeldt, Zach Norris as Fredrik Egerman, Rebecca Marlowe as Fredrika Armfeldt, Emily Moreno as Madame Armfeldt, Harper Levy as Anne Egerman, Zack Blanchette as Henrik Egerman, Bailey Claffey as Countess Charlotte Malcolm, John Drinkwater as Count Carl-Magnus Malcolm, Gabby Baker as Petra, Bill Wetherbee as Frid, Sammy Quinn as Marla, Sydney Chow as Osa, Gary Lumpkin as Bertrand, Albert Nelthropp as Mr. Lindquist, Dana Kluczyk as Mrs. Nordstrom, Francesca Litterio as Mrs. Anderson, Jonah Hale as Mr. Erlanson and Ruth Kupperberg as Mrs. Segstrom.\n\nThe design team includes Brian T. Sharron (sets), Vicki Neal and Katie Wakeman (lights), Alan Michael Smith (costumes), Richard Kroth (sound), Cat Lawless (hair and makeup), Madilyn Joseph (props), Becca Barrett ’16 (dialect coach) and Justin Flores (assistant choreographer). Emily Taylor is production stage manager.\n\nWhen “A Little Night Music” opened on Feb. 25, 1973, at Broadway’s Shubert Theatre, producer/director Harold Prince scored a triumph. New York Times critic Clive Barnes exclaimed, “Good God! An adult musical!” Glynis Johns, Len Cariou, Victoria Mallory, Hermione Gingold, Patricia Elliott and Laurence Guittard starred. Winner of six 1973 Tony Awards, including Best Musical, it ran 601 performances and toured the country with Jean Simmons and Margaret Hamilton.\n\nWCT Season Subscription prices range from $91 to $114, which includes all four 2018-19 Main Stage musicals: “A Little Night Music,” “Working,” “My One and Only” and “The Pirates of Penzance.”\n\nSingle tickets ($18-$32) are on sale now for “A Little Night Music,” with price ranges for children, senior and adult tickets. Wagner College students attend free with current ID.\n\nFor more information, call the WCT box office at 718-390-3259 or email boxoffice@wagner.edu.\n\nThe box office is located on the ground floor of Main Hall.\n\nBox office hours are weekdays, 12 to 4 p.m."
