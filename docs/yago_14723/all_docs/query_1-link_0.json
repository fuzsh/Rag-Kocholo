It was entered into the 1956 Cannes Film Festival.[2] The plot explores the mental state of Mozart during production of his final opera The Magic Flute. Werner's portrayal of Mozart was unusual for the time in playing him as a cheerful and easygoing young man, reflecting the postwar optimism of the newly restored Austrian Republic.[3]\n\nThe film's sets were designed by the art directors Werner Schlichting and Wolf Witzemann.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nOskar Werner as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\n\nJohanna Matz as Annie Gottlieb\n\nErich Kunz as Emanuel Schikaneder\n\nGertrud Kückelmann as Constanze Mozart\n\nNadja Tiller as Louise Weber Lange\n\nAnnie Rosar as Frau Weber\n\nHugo Gottschlich as Don Primus\n\nAngelika Hauff as Suzi Gerl\n\nAlbin Skoda as Antonio Salieri, village composer\n\nRaoul Aslan as Rosenberg, Hofkämmerer\n\nWalter Regelsberger as Süßmayer, Mazart's Famulus\n\nElfie Weissenböck as Josefa Hofer - Queen of the Night\n\nAlma Seidler as Gottlieb's mother\n\nUlrich Bettac as Gottlieb's father\n\nLeopold Rudolf as an unknown person, orderer of the Requiem\n\nHelli Servi as Lina, Mozart's servant\n\nRaoul Retzer as Gerl, Sarasto's actor\n\nElisabeth Terval as Eleonore Gottlieb\n\nEgon von Jordan as Bondini, ital.
