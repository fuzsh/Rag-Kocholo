        "text": "In this time of uncertainty, fear, and isolation, but also courage and light, the Dvořák American Heritage Association (DAHA) has launched a new program called From DAHA With Love. As other organizations have reached out to their audiences and members, we are pleased to provide you with some of our favorite musical moments. Some of these are from concerts sponsored by our organization, others are suggested by members and our extended DAHA family, and still others are newly created for this program. We broadcast this music on weekdays at 10AM, and each program features a short clip, usually less than 10 minutes.\n\nYou can enjoy this music here on our website, on our FaceBook page or on our YouTube Channel.\n\nPrepared with the support of the Bohemian Benevolent & Literary Association and the Czech Center New York.\n\nFinal Week!!\n\nFor the last six months we have been posting some of our favorite musical selections, from past DAHA events, recordings by members of DAHA, and a range of curated videos. It has been an honor to share these with you. Our Fall season is beginning and we will end our series this week with a homage to Halloween by attending to Dvořák’s darker side, or darker uses of his music. We hope you enjoy it and that you will attend virtually our events this year.\n\nMonday, August 17th\n\nThe twentieth week of From DAHA With Love is dedicated to the spirit, the beauty, and the music of Moravia:\n\nMartinů, Songs on Two Pages, “The Moravian Girl”\n\nPřiletěl ptáček z cizí krajiny, A little bird flew in from a foreign land,\n\ndonesl psaní, v něm pozdravení. Bringing a message with greetings.\n\nBych se podíval do země české, I should take a look at this Czech land,\n\nže jsou tam taky děvčátka hezké. Because there are also pretty girls there.\n\nZůstanu radši v jihlavském kraji, I would rather stay in the Jihlava region\n\nnajdu si děvče hezké z Moravy. And find a pretty Moravian girl.\n\nMoravka chodi přímo jak svíce, A Moravian girl walks straight like a candle.\n\nkaždá má k chlapcům upřímně srdce. Each one loves her swain with a pure heart.\n\nFriday, July 3rd\n\nDuke Ellington, “Black” from Black, Brown and Beige\n\nThis version was recorded in March of 1965 and only was released in 1985.When the great Czech novelist Josef Škvorecký was writing his novel Dvořák in Love he became convinced that the immortal Ellington had been influenced by the “New World” Symphony. And certainly, considering that Dvořák’s student Will Marion Cook was one of Ellington’s great influences, perhaps it is not too much of a stretch to consider Ellington one of the Czech composer’s musical offspring. We honor Ellington in light of current events and also acknowledge Ellington’s deep and enduring relationship with our own Maurice Peress.\n\nRead more and listen: The Music Plays On - Ellington Black, Brown and Beige\n\nTuesday, June 23rd\n\nBloudění v rytmu (Wandering in Rhythm) Jiří Traxler singer, Inka Zemánková\n\nI asked the noted scholar of Czech music, Prof. Brian Locke to select some music for us. These are his comments:\n\nI chose Jiří Traxler's 1941 song Bloudění v rytmu (Wandering in Rhythm) for several reasons. Traxler (1912-2011) was one of the most important Czech swing-era composers in the 1940s, who led a fascinating life in turbulent times. As one of the most educated musicians in the popular music community of Prague, he was often called upon to assist others with harmonization, arrangement, lyrics, and translation. His main contract was with the publishing company of R. A. Dvorský, which stayed afloat even during the Nazi occupation--though at some risk, especially after Heydrich and the closure of dance halls. Two of his other close colleagues are also featured in the recording of Bloudění v rytmu: the iconic vocalist Inka Zemánková (1915-2000) and the orchestra led by Karel Vlach (1911-1986): along with Traxler, these three represented the \"hot\" sound prefered by Czech youth in the occupation. For these listeners--among them, the youthful Josef Škvorecký, entranced and empowered by this song in particular--Bloudění served as a generational anthem.\n\nAs with roughly a quarter of his song output, Traxler co-wrote his own lyrics for Bloudění v rytmu (with Dvorský's staff lyricist Karel Kozel). I translate it as follows:\n\nI only have one desire,\n\nI’ll give my life for it,\n\nI wander in the rhythm of the melody\n\nthat I love so much.\n\nAnd therefore all day\n\nI only sing and dance.\n\nI wander in the rhythm of the melody,\n\neverything seems to me like a dream.\n\nMy heart beats in syncopation,\n\nso I must dance on.\n\nMy body and soul\n\nthe rhythm of swing has taken, just like the devil.\n\nTuesday, June 2nd\n\nErik Entwistle, Six Variations on a theme by Vita Kaprálová\n\nFrom the composer: “Kaprálová was 14 years old when she wrote a charming, untitled miniature in 1929. In the style of a lullaby, the piece is so tantalizingly brief that I wanted to expand upon it with a set of variations, which I composed in 2018 as a tribute to Kaprálová’s extraordinary talent. The variations at times echo the impressionistic style of Kaprálová’s miniature, while also referencing other musical styles that could have been heard during the time of the composer’s youth.”\n\nTuesday, May 12th\n\nDvořák, Nocturne in B Major for Strings\n\nA very special little work by Antonín Dvořák, far removed in style and mood from his familiar Slavonic Dances and 'New World' Symphony, is his Nocturne for String Orchestra in B major—a work that caresses us with its heavenly calm in this troubled and stressful time. This music goes back to the period when Dvořák was a humble orchestra member totally unknown as a composer, as part of a string quartet whose score he apparently later destroyed, salvaging however this one section, adding an introduction and conclusion to form a separate piece, this exquisite gem.\n\nFriday, May 8th\n\nZdeněk Fibich, Quintet for Piano, Clarinet, Horn, Violin and Cello in D Major, Scherzo\n\nFibich’s quintet is a genuinely original work. The Scherzo is more like a large rondo, or one could call it a scherzo with two exquisite Trios. In the first trio, the horn takes over, the second is one of the prettiest things in Czech music, or anywhere for that matter. A delicate “Roma-inflected” furiant vies with sections recalling Mahler’s Symphony #1, written at almost the same time.\n\nFriday, May 1st\n\nJanacek, “Intimate Letters” Momenta, Mov’t 3\n\nOne of the most exciting movements in one of the most exciting string quartets ever written. In a letter to his lover Kamila, to whom the quartet is dedicated he said that this movement “will be very cheerful and then dissolve into a dream that resembles a painting of you.\" He also referred to a place in the movement \"where the earth moved\" and we can hear the powerful erotic passion in the very middle of the movement as the upper strings, playing together, go \"outside the frame.\"\n\nThursday, April 30th\n\nViktor Kalabis, Spring Whistles for wind quintet\n\nFor the premiere of this wind octet (2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 French horns, 2 bassoons), which took place on March 15, 1980 at the Prague Rudolfinum, the composer wrote a short poetic introduction:\n\n„The sound of wind instruments perfectly corresponds to my spring inspirations, which have been steadily accompanying me for several years. Spring whistles awaken nature from the lethargy of winter, they awaken a person's faith in life. They wake up the branches of trees and shrubs, raise the sun above the horizon, raise the lark above the field and throw the silver rays of the sun into a small stream in the solitude of Kunějov. If a person hears their whistle, he too will quicken his step and his heart will be filled with a warm feeling of joy, an echo of youth. “\n\nTuesday, April 28th\n\nPiano Trio 333, by Aleš Březina, Guarneri Trio, Prague\n\nThe piano is a small orchestra, and in conjunction with the chamber orchestra offers an inexhaustible number of sound possibilities. That is why I gladly and gratefully accepted Karel Košárek's commission to write a composition for this ensemble for the Musica Holešov Festival. I replaced the classic three-movement form of the concerto with a four-movement form, in which each movement is named after one season. The final movement - Winter - ends with a coda that references the material of the first movement. This creates an architectonic arc for my composition, which I named after the most typical feature of my favorite season, Falling Leaves. The performers are Karel Košárek (piano), PKF_Prague Philharmonia and Gaetano d’Espinosa (conductor).\n\nThursday, April 23rd\n\nToday’s two selections are by Czechoslovak composer Bohuslav Martinů (1890-1959), comments by Jack Meadow.\n\nMartinu “Breakfast of the Virgin Mary,” from Four Songs of the Virgin\n\nThe first selection is “Maps,” the third tableau from Martinů’s mechanical ballet “without characters,” The Marvelous Flight (Le Raid merveilleux). This ballet, one of Martinů’s numerous efforts in the genre, was completed in September of 1927 but not performed until 1994. The title liberally refers to the mysterious and tragic May 8, 1927 attempt by French aviators Nungesser (pilot) and Coli (navigator) to fly from Paris to New York. “Maps,” a string-heavy tableau, begins in a “learned” contrapuntal manner and soars to rarefied spaces.\n\nMartinu, “The Amazing Flight”\n\nThe second selection is “Our Lady’s Breakfast” (“Snídaní Panny Marie”), the third song from Martinů’s Four Songs about Mary for mixed (SATB) chorus. Martinů completed these Czech-language a cappella choruses in Paris in the winter of 1934, and the pieces premiered in Prague in 1935. “Our Lady’s Breakfast” is an at times ludicrous tale of the Virgin Mary and her newborn son searching for food, encountering strangers, and waiting for the sun to come out. The words of “Our Lady’s Breakfast,” as is the case for the collection’s three remaining songs, are taken from František Sušil’s massive collection of Moravian folk poetry. These choral pieces will sound like nothing you have ever heard before, and Martinů, who noted in an unpublished essay that he composed the Four Songs in “my own way,” would have concurred.\n\nFriday, April 17th\n\nMartinů, Who is the Most Powerful in the World\n\nThe ballet Who is the Most Powerful in the World is the breakthrough moment in the stage works of Bohuslav Martinů. In it the composer finally left the dark sounding worlds of late romanticism and the shimmering sounds of impressionism and wrote a piece free from all the complications of earlier styles and influenced partly by jazz. This piece which Martinů called \"a ballet about mice\" is very funny and is an easy listening work that immediately caught the attention of the audience. The basic idea of the libretto, written by a composer (based on an old fairy tale known in many European and Asian countries) expresses the belief that the most powerful person in the world is not the one who think himself the strongest (or permanently tweets it). Ultimately, the strongest are those who seem weakest--when they work together. And these are the chipper little mice in this case. In this respect, the ballet is perhaps even more topical today than it was when it was created in 1920's.\n\nThursday, April 16th\n\nMoravian Folk Song and variants “Široký potoček”, Broln Ensemble\n\nMichael Beckerman DAHA, Fugue for Koto on Široký potoček\n\nMichael Beckerman DAHA, The Little Brook is Wide\n\nThese pieces are dedicated to all those separated from their loved ones during this moment. The first clip is the wonderful Moravian song “Široký potoček” (The Wide Brooklet) followed by a fugue for koto on the opening of the song. This is followed by a short composition that combines this tune with the famous “The Water is Wide,” as a fantasy of diminutions and augmentations for marimba and clarinet."
