Your film is commercial bombast,” he said, “devoid of fact…. You have denigrated a great Russian hero.” “Great heroes are the stuff of myth and legend, not facts.” Ken Russell in discussion with his Soviet guide at the Tchaikovsky Museum Altered States: The Autobiography of Ken Russell\n\nFilmmaker Ken Russell identified the critical issue during his heated exchange about filmed biographies at Tchaikovsky’s home in Klin. Fact may be plain, dry and mundane, whereas legend is alluring and inspiring. How can these ingredients be blended into a dramatic presentation that remains essentially true to the life of the person it portrays? At what point does it cross the line and become distortion? Ever since Socrates attended a performance of Aristophenes’ play The Clouds in ancient Athens and stood in the audience to show how he was di›erent from the character of Socrates as portrayed on the stage, the question of dramatic authenticity has been discussed and debated. The Great Composers Portrayed on Film, ¡9¡3 through 2003 is the first in-depth attempt to study feature film portrayals of the life and times of the major figures of classical music. It will not only analyze the e›ectiveness and quality of the motion pic-\n\ntures, but also study how accurately they depict the man and his music. The book will also separate myth from reality, a remarkably di‡cult task given the complexities of human nature, history and culture. In the case of Mozart, for example, most of the screen depictions are based on myth. For Beethoven, a number of key documents, including the Heiligenstadt Testament, the “immortal beloved” letter and his conversation books, have provided the basis for most of the films, and in the case of the letter, a mystery to be solved. On the other hand, film depictions of Franz Schubert are based on operettas that are largely fantasy. Richard Wagner, it has been said, practically transformed himself into a myth during his lifetime. Conversely, in the case of Dmitri Shostakovich, his character was transformed into a myth by the Soviet state during his lifetime, and his authentic personality and convictions came to light only after his death, in part\n\n1\n\n2\n\nPreface\n\nThe authentic Shostakovich (left) with Ben Kingsley’s screen portrayal in Testimony.\n\nthrough motion pictures such as Testimony and Rothschild’s Violin. In any case, this book will try to penetrate the veil between reality and myth. Motion pictures, however, not only inform but also entertain. A completely accurate film, such as Mozart: A Childhood Chronicle, can be a failure because it is static and tedious, while a fanciful and totally misleading picture such as Voices from a Locked Room, or even a bad one such as Magic Fire, can be delightfully entertaining. The Great Composers Portrayed on Film, ¡9¡3 through 2003 is intended to be a useful resource not only for educators and students, but also for the general public, for film lovers and music lovers alike. Readers will find it packed with useful information, anecdotes, film criticism and analysis. Biographical films (or biopics as they are frequently called) were among the earliest films at the very beginnings of cinema. The first screen depiction of a composer was quick-change artist Leopoldo Fregoli’s ¡898 short titled Maestri di Musica, in which he impersonated Giuseppe Verdi and others. The first legitimate fea-\n\nture length composer biopic is The Life of Richard Wagner (¡9¡3), and the latest film to be included is Eroica (2002), a BBC telefilm about Beethoven. For purposes of this study, I am concentrating on feature films (although I have included every silent film portrayal of composers due to their rarity and historical interest). I have interpreted “feature films” quite broadly, however, including works as short as 52 minutes in order to include the brief films produced by David Devine known as the “Composers Specials Series.” Foreign films are included as well in this study. I have also interpreted the term “classical composers” as widely as possible, including any composer who intended his works to be performed in a concert hall or opera house stage, including Scott Joplin and Sigmund Romberg. Perhaps the only composer I considered who failed to make the cut was Stephen Foster, who basically limited himself to writing popular songs. A final qualification was that the film had to be a dramatization. Biographical films can fall into several di›erent categories. First there is the traditional biopic,\n\nPreface\n\nsuch as The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan or Song Without End about Franz Liszt. Then there are docudramas, productions which blend dramatization with elements of the straight documentary, such as Battle for Music, To Live I Must Die or A Good Dissonance Like a Man. Faux biographies are films with scripts that are totally fictionalized, such as the ¡937 MGM version of The Great Waltz or La Valse de Paris. Most of the films I researched for the book could be classified as traditional, but often with a moderate degree of fictionalization. Besides biopics, there are a number of di›erent genres considered in which composers appear, including historical pictures (Suez), adventure (Song of Scheherazade), romance (Moonlight Sonata), musicals (Moulin Rouge), fantasies (Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure), comedies (Adventures of Picasso), children’s films (Beethoven Lives Upstairs) and even horror (Phantom of the Opera). Straightforward documentaries are included in a special listing at the end of each chapter. Using this criteria, sixty-four composers are covered in sixty-two entries (since Robert and Clara Schumann, as well as Johann Strauss, Sr., and Johann Strauss, Jr., father and son, share their chapters). It may be surprising that some well-known composers, such as Carl Maria von Weber, Ottorino Respighi, Alexander Scriabin and Bela Bartok are absent, but no films could be identified that included them. A number of other major figures such as Felix Mendelssohn, Maurice Ravel and Sergei Rachmanino› appear only in passing cameos in chapters about other composers. It is puzzling why certain composers have been overlooked in feature films. On the other hand, a few lesser-known composers, such as Arnold Bax, Marin Marais and Bohuslav Martinu, wind up with their own chapters. The best-known composers are not always the ones who are selected to appear in films. In the ultimate irony, the\n\n3\n\nonly composer portrayal to win an Academy Award for best actor was F. Murray Abraham in the role of Antonio Salieri, a truly second-rate composer. The layout of the book is simple. The entries are arranged alphabetically by the composer’s last name. Each may cover from one to thirty one films. These titles are arranged in chronological order at the start of each entry, together with the names of the actor playing the composer. After a brief profile of each composer, the films are analyzed in terms of importance, style, factual accuracy and overall approach. In some cases the film may be a full-fledged biopic. In others, the composer may make only a fleeting appearance. Some films will appear in several di›erent entries. For example, Song Without End, the Liszt biopic, is also covered under Chopin and Wagner, with each composer’s appearance highlighted in the appropriate entry. The films are judged for overall quality, appropriate use of the composer’s music and entertainment value. The success of each actor’s interpretation of the composer is also considered. As far as possible, all films were viewed by the author. In cases where the films were lost or simply unobtainable for viewing (as in the case of many foreign productions), secondary sources, such as critical reviews, were consulted. After the critiques, production credits are listed, including production company, cast, film composer and performers, writer, cinematographer, editor, producer and director, running time and original language if other than English. After the credits, a section titled “Noted Documentaries” is featured, which includes titles and running times of these works. These documentaries can be of any length, and a short commentary on them is included. If no documentaries can be identified for any composer, then this section is omitted. Two appendices complete the book. Appendix A examines films about fictitious composers.\n\n4\n\nPreface\n\nCelebrated composer Erich Wolfgang Korngold (right) coaches Alan Badel to appear as a credible conductor for his performance as Wagner in Magic Fire.\n\nNine films are presented in which the leading character is a classical composer. The manner in which these characters are presented, occasionally mad, sometimes obsessed, but usually driven by a mysterious inner force that compels them to write music, can be meaningful. Like a distorted mirror image, these e›orts o›er additional insight into composer films as a whole. Appendix B looks at a variety of composer portrayals in miniseries and regular series television. Among the various directors who made composer films, two individuals are particularly prominent — Ken Russell and Tony Palmer. Both are British filmmakers who have a passionate love of music. They have produced operas on stage and made\n\ntraditional documentaries as well as feature films about composers. Since their work is essential to this book, a brief outline of their accomplishments would be useful. Ken Russell was born in Southampton, England, in ¡927. After serving in the merchant navy and the RAF, he worked as a ballet dancer, an actor and still photographer before launching his career as a filmmaker with the BBC in late ¡950s. His first composer project was a ¡96¡ documentary about Serge Prokofiev, titled Portrait of a Soviet Composer. The following year he completed a fifty-minute documentary about Sir Edward Elgar, which proved so popular that it launched his work into feature films. His first big-budget film was Billion Dollar Brain, a spy\n\nPreface\n\nthriller in the Harry Palmer spy film series starring Michael Caine. In subsequent years, he made additional documentaries for television about artists, dancers and composers, including Bela Bartok, Georges Delerue and Ralph Vaughn Williams. He also started making composer biopics, such as Song of Summer (¡968), his feature-length telefilm about Frederick Delius, which became an international sensation. Russell became famous for his flamboyance, creative imagination and audacious imagery, traits that particularly characterized his theatrical film work. Among his major features are Women in Love (¡969), The Devils (¡97¡), Savage Messiah (¡972), Tommy (¡975), Valentino (¡977), Altered States (¡980), Gothic (¡987) and Lair of the White Worm (¡988). His composer feature films include The Music Lovers (¡970), Mahler (¡974), Lisztomania (¡975) and later telefilms about Anton Bruckner and Sir Arnold Bax. His most recent project was a second film about Elgar titled Portrait of a Composer on a Bicycle (2002), with narration by Russell and featuring the music from the Enigma Variations. Tony Palmer has over a hundred films to his credit, and he largely specializes in music documentaries. After graduating from Cambridge, Palmer joined the BBC, serving as an apprentice to Ken Russell on his documentary Isadora Duncan in ¡966. He soon began making his own films, starting with The Art of Conducting with Sir Georg Solti. Palmer also worked as a music critic for The Observer, as a columnist for The Spectator and as an author of eight books, including All You Need Is Love, a history of American popular music which was also the basis of a seventeen-part television series. Palmer’s work has been recognized with over forty major international prizes, including ten medals at the New York Film and Television Festival. His topics of his documentaries have included actors (Peter Sellers and Richard Burton),\n\n5\n\nmusicians (Maria Callas, Yehudi Menuhin and Renée Fleming) and celebrities (Liberace and Hugh He›ner). His composer profiles of Benjamin Britten, William Walton and Sergei Rachmanino› are renowned. Although many of his documentaries are outside the scope of this volume due to their less than feature length or nondramatized approach, they are highly recommended and worthwhile for readers to track down and watch whenever possible. Some of his other films about classical composers are Dvorak in Love (¡988), Hindemith — A Pilgrim’s Progress (¡989) and Symphony of Sorrowful Songs (¡993) about the Third Symphony by the contemporary Polish master Henryk Górecki. Many of Palmer’s works fall under the criteria for inclusion in the chapters on Berlioz, Brahms, Chopin, Handel, Puccini, Purcell, Shostakovich and Wagner. In fact, some of the best work reviewed in this book is by Tony Palmer. Hopefully, the caliber of his work and that of Ken Russell will inspire future filmmakers, particularly when they attempt screen portrayals of the great composers. Before concluding, a word about the spelling of composer names and titles. My very first position was as Music Librarian at the Paterson (New Jersey) Public Library, where I catalogued recordings for a consortium of fifty libraries. We adapted the ANSCR system which standardized composers’ names and their works. In some cases, the titles are those in the original foreign language, while at other times the English translation is favored. The system was based on the popular preference by the top three music guides to determine the most popular usage. I have retained this system for Great Composers on Screen, so among Puccini operas, for example, you will find Il Tabarro instead of The Cloak, but Girl of the Golden West instead of La Fanciulla del West. The house lights have started to dim, and the overture is about to begin.\n\nIsaac Albéniz Screen depictions\n\npassed through New York, Cuba and South America before his parents could track him down. As an adult, Albéniz retained his love of travel. Both films are reported to be fairly accurate in their portrayals. Serenata Española, however, was better distributed, and it was even marketed in the United States in a subtitled version that was titled Spanish Serenade.\n\n• Pedro López Lagar in Albéniz (¡947) • Antonio Vico in Serenata Española (¡947)\n\nIsaac Albéniz (¡860–¡909) was the first nationalist Spanish composer to win international recognition. A pupil of Franz Liszt, he toured the world as a virtuoso. His best-known compositions are for solo piano, such as Iberia, Catalonia, Rapsodia Cubana, Goyescas and his Serenata Española. He also composed operas, including Pepita Jiménez and Merlin, which was originally intended to be the first part of an operatic trilogy about King Arthur. His final composition, Navarra, was left unfinished at the time of his death and was completed by another famous Spanish composer, Enrique Granados (¡867–¡9¡6). Interestingly, two major productions were based on the life of Albéniz in ¡947, one in Argentina and the other in Spain. Based on critical reviews, the Argentinean film Albéniz is the better. In fact, it won the equivalent of the Academy Award in Argentina as the best film made in the country in ¡947. Both films are fairly accurate, concentrating on Albéniz the wanderer. In real life, Albéniz was a prodigy like Mozart, who started giving concerts at the age of four. As he grew older, Albéniz rebelled, frequently running away. When he was thirteen, he took o› and\n\nProduction Credits Albéniz (¡947) Argentina Sono Films Cast : Pedro López Lagar, Sabina Olmos, Marisa Regules, Pedro Aleandro, Amadeo Novoa, Mercedes Diaz, Eduardo Otero, Lilian Valmar, Adolfo Linvel, Pastora Soler, Eugenio Nigro, Berta Ortegosa, Vincente Climent and José Maria Gutiérrez.

Critics assert that he anticipated the future direction, if not the style, that music would take for the next fifty years. Ironically, his own work fell out of favor during this period but was revived largely through the e›orts of Mendelssohn and his contemporaries. Since then, Bach’s reputation as one of the greatest composers has never been challenged. Bach saw himself as totally dedicated to the service of God, and his sacred works, including over three hundred church cantatas, together with his Mass in B minor, his Passion according to St. Matthew and his Christmas Oratorio, are at the heart of his creative output. His works for the organ form another prominent component of his music. His Toccata and Fugue in D Minor, his Passacaglia and Fugue in C Minor, his “Little” Fugue in G Minor, his chorale preludes and his Orgelbüchlein (Little Organ Book) are considered to be the finest works ever written for the instrument. Other major com-\n\npositions include his six Brandenburg Concertos, four orchestral suites, numerous concertos for harpsichord, piano or violin, with the Concerto in D Minor for Two Violins being the crowning jewel. Bach’s solo keyboard music, such as his Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue, The Goldberg Variations and The Art of the Fugue are treasured by music lovers. Bach had numerous o›spring from his two marriages, and four of his sons became well-known composers: Wilhelm Friedemann Bach (¡7¡0–¡784), Carl Philipp Emanuel (C. P. E.) Bach (¡7¡4– ¡788), Johann Christoph Friedrich Bach (¡732–¡795) and Johann Christian Bach (¡735–¡782). American composer and humorist Peter Schickele invented the character P. D. Q. Bach as a parody, being the last and least talented of Bach’s children. With numerous recordings, concerts and compositions, including operas such as The Stoned Guest, Schickele’s caricature has proven to be enormously popular and durable, as well as being a most unusual tribute to the historic Johann Sebastian Bach. Although one of the greatest composers, Bach was considered too bland a figure to be featured in many motion pictures. A genuinely devout man, he traveled little and concentrated his activities on his family, his music and the duties of his various court and church positions. His first depiction is in a ¡932 German film about Barberina, a dancer at the court of Frederick the Great, King of Prussia, at Sans Souci, his palace in Potsdam. Titled Die Tänzerin von Sans Souci, the film stars Lil Dagover, the heroine of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (¡9¡9) and Dr. Mabuse the Gambler (¡922). Bach appears briefly, portraying his May ¡747 visit to King Frederick II. Dr. Phillip\n\nGerman poster art for Friedemann Bach with Gustav Gründgens.\n\n10\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach\n\nManning, not a professional actor, was reportedly hired because of his resemblance to the elder Bach. In real life, Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach held a position at Frederick’s court. Bach improvised a fugue for the king, who was himself an amateur flautist and composer of many works including over a hundred flute sonatas and four flute concertos that are given an occasional performance. Frederick composed a theme for Bach, who later wrote Das Musicalisches Opfer (A Musical O›ering) based on it. Friedemann Bach, a somewhat controversial film, was produced in ¡94¡ by the Nazi film industry, one of a series of biographical films on figures from German history such as scientist Robert Koch (¡939), writer Friederich Schiller (¡940) and sculptor Andreas Schlütter (¡942). By implication, these figures usually represent traditional German values embodied in Hitler’s regime. At least that was the subtle propaganda message intended by the Nazi overseeers of the film industry, as a balance to the blatantly anti–Semitic films such as Jew Süss (¡940). Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, however, fails to fit the pattern since he is portrayed as an utter failure. Therefore, it is Johann Sebastian Bach himself who represents the German ideal, but the film chooses not to focus on him since his religious nature is not an image with which the Nazis were comfortable. Another Nazi taint in the script is the malicious depiction of gypsies, seen as a corrupting influence upon German virtues. Eugen Klopfer plays Johann Sebastian Bach, who appears in several scenes early in the film. Klopfer is excellent in the role, strong willed, shrewd but compassionate, and his makeup and costume are first rate, making him the perfect screen image of the composer. In fact, the elder Bach is the first figure seen in the story, which seems to open in ¡747 or ¡748. Bach is playing the harpsichord, accompanied by two of his sons on adjoining keyboards, conducting a class for his music stu-\n\ndents. Wilhelm Friedemann Bach is played by the superb actor Gustav Gründgens, familiar as the notorious head of the underworld in Fritz Lang’s M (¡93¡) and as Maximilien Robespierre in Danton (¡93¡), the first film banned by the Nazis when they came to power. He is simply known as Friedemann throughout the script. When Friedemann enters the music room, his father instantly gestures him to assume his place at the harpsichord. After completing the piece, Friedemann announces that he has resigned his position as church organist in Halle. The historical fact, however, is that Wilhelm Friedemann Bach was music director and organist in Halle from ¡747 to ¡764, not resigning until fourteen years after his father’s death. Bach tells his son that he is worried about him and his inconsistencies, saying that he is worried about his inability to stick with any position. He advises that a professional musician has to learn to work with patrons, boards and committees. Of course, Bach had his own battles with patrons and committees earlier in his own career. The next scene is dinner with the composer’s large family gathered together for the meal. A royal courier from Dresden interrupts the repast. The King of Saxony has requested that Bach travel to the court for a series of concerts. Bach declines and instead sends Friedemann as his surrogate. Again, this development makes no sense historically. Friedemann is portrayed as a stranger in Dresden, when he actually served as organist and music director at St. Sophia in the city for thirteen years, from ¡733 to ¡746. At the court, Friedemann wins a music contest with the composer Louis Marchand. The king praises him but warns him not to be a musical revolutionary but to stick with the style of his father. Friedemann is then persuaded by the leading ballerina to compose a whimsical ballet about nymphs, which is a great success, but it is criticized by some musicians as too frivo-\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach\n\nlous a work to be written by a son of Bach. He has a love a›air with the ballerina but believes his true love to be Antonia, one of his aristocratic students, and he promises her that in the future he will compose only works worthy of a Bach. This entire episode is pure fiction. In fact, the Marchand contest was with Johann Sebastian Bach, not Friedemann, and it occurred about thirty years earlier in ¡7¡7. In the next and final scene with Johann Sebastian Bach, Carl Philipp Emanuel is helping his father transcribe a musical score. He asks why his father always prefers Friedemann and why he himself is never recommended for a post. Bach replies that Friedemann has an unsettled nature and needs his support more, whereas C. P. E. has a stable nature and will always be able to find his own way. He then tells C. P. E. that he will be recommended to the court of Frederick the Great in Prussia. Bach then complains that his vision seems to be failing and he is having di‡culty completing his manuscript for The Art of the Fugue. He stands up and says, “I’m o› to give lessons at St. Thomas Church. I do not need my eyes there, only my ears, and they are still sound.” There are again inaccuracies in this scene. For example, C. P. E. Bach was appointed Kapellmeister for the Prussian court ten years earlier, in ¡740. Friedemann Bach, at the time of his father’s death in ¡750, held only two posts and appeared to be quite settled in his career. Bach did have failing eyesight during the last two years of his life, and in fact he was treated by the same doctor who cared for Handel and his loss of vision. Bach’s death is presented in a beautiful cinematic sequence. A hymn (Come, Sweet Death) is sung as the camera passes over the darkened music room, focusing on a manuscript with black ribbons on the harpsichord, then fading to a portrait of Bach draped in black and finally ending with a shot of the composer’s grave. It is\n\n11\n\nthe most elegant and touching scene in the production, occurring exactly at the midpoint of the film. The remainder involves the decline of Friedemann, who is unable to procure another position due to his reputation as a musical iconoclast. He applies for a position as an organist at a church in Brunswick but is rejected because his composition at his audition is considered too advanced and strange. He is given a second audition and is accepted. However, he is forced to withdraw in disgrace when it is learned that he substituted one of his father’s compositions as his own. After this failure, his true love, Antonia, marries a wealthy nobleman but continues to try to help him. Friedemann comes to resent her obvious pity. Instead, he takes up with a roving band of gypsies. He forges musical manuscripts which he passes o› as authentic works of Johann Sebastian Bach to music dealers. He gets into a fight with a wealthy music collector who insults his father, calling him a “dusty old wig.” Friedemann is stabbed and mortally wounded, and his brother C. P. E is summoned to his bedside. As a last request, Friedemann asks his brother to play their father’s music on the harpsichord. He passes away peacefully as the film fades to black without any end credits. Friedemann appears to be middle aged in his deathbed scene, another distortion since the composer was seventy-four when he died in ¡784. The circumstances of Friedemann’s last years are basically true; he became somewhat of a vagabond before settling in Berlin. He earned money by occasional concerts, and he was still regarded as one of the finest keyboard artists in Germany. Many of his problems were due to alcoholism, but he did leave a wife and daughter when he died (not, however, stabbed in a fight). By shortening Friedemann’s life by twenty years, the screenplay basically eliminated his stable career before the age of fifty-five,\n\n12\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach\n\nmaking him appear to be a complete failure. In fact, Friedemann would have been a failure as a composer if he had continued to try and compose in the baroque style of his father. Musical tastes had changed, and Bach’s other musical o›spring, Johann Christian and Carl Philipp Emanuel, had changed with the fashion to reflect the “style galant” of the late eighteenth century. If anything, Wilhelm Friedemann Bach was more advanced and occasionally experimental, foreshadowing the Romantic era with his intensely personal style. His shortcoming was that he was inconsistent, retreating to a more conventional manner, making his work seem capricious. The film provides a fine opportunity to hear many examples of his music, which can be impressive. The musical selections of Johann Sebastian Bach are also well chosen, but these familiar selections seem somewhat reserved and too dry in performance. Perhaps that was deliberate so as not to overwhelm the listener in comparison to the works of his son. Vladimir Gardin is credited with playing the role of “Composer Bach” in an o›beat Soviet musical comedy titled Anton Ivanovich Gets Mad. Gardin was one of the pioneers of Russian cinema, an influential director and the founder in ¡9¡9 of the first state cinema school. During the ¡940s, Gardin abandoned directing and concentrated on playing character roles in feature films. The credits, however, do not make it clear if the character is meant to represent Johann Sebastian Bach, one of his sons or even another composer with the same name. For the sake of completeness, however, I decided to include this wartime entry, which reportedly was a very popular film. Dimitri Kabelevsky, the noted Soviet composer, provided the music for the film’s soundtrack. Chronik der Anna Magdalena Bach (¡968) is a rather threadbare film, described by critics as largely a series of concert ex-\n\ncerpts concentrating on Bach conducting and playing various ensembles, while an o›-camera voice reads letters and journals of Anna Magdalena Bach, the composer’s second wife, whom the widowed Bach married in ¡72¡. His first wife, Maria Barbara Bach, was the composer’s cousin. She died while Johann was called away to a spa in Carlsbad by his patron Prince Leopold. Maria Barbara was the mother of Wilhelm Friedemann and Carl Philipp Emanuel. Anna Magdalena Wilcken, daughter of the trumpeter in Bach’s court orchestra, was a singer and harpsichord player and is credited as being a nearly perfect wife to Johann Sebastian. She was the mother of Johann Christoph Friedrich and Johann Christian Bach. Many of the passages in her journals deal with the tragic illnesses of her children (Bach fathered over twenty children between his two wives), and many of the Bach children did not survive their childhood years. In the film, Johann Sebastian Bach is played by a musician, Gustav Leonhardt, well known as a specialist in baroque music. Another famous performer and Baroque specialist, Nikolaus Harnoncourt, plays the role of Prince Leopold. He also serves as conductor for much of the music heard in the film. The quality of the performances were praised by reviewers, but they questioned the static nature of the film which has been described as stagnant and repetitious. At least the information covered in the script is completely accurate, as it was derived from primary sources. The Cantor of St. Thomas’s is a British telefilm covering Bach’s years in his most famous position at the prestigious church in Leipzig, which he held from ¡722 until his death in ¡750. Reportedly, the film had only one showing, which was met with mixed notices, the main complaint being that the picture was tedious and poorly scripted. Most critics, however, highly praised Brian Cox’s performance as the\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach\n\ncomposer. Ironically, Cox’s very next role was as Hannibal Lector in the first screen portrayal of the serial killer in Manhunter (¡986). Johann Sebastian Bach appeared as window dressing, a sight gag for the comedy Bill and Ted’s Bogus Journey. Set in the future, the plot depicts a golden age for humanity due to the improbable e›orts of a pair of twentieth-century rock musicians, Bill and Ted. A malcontent from the future plans to undo the golden age by sending two robots back in time to eliminate Bill and Ted (the same plot device as The Terminator series). Bach appears in the very beginning, at a history class in the future. Bach arrives in a phone-booth time machine with Thomas A. Edison and other guest speakers from the past. Before he can begin his lecture, the villain appears with his two robots, takes the class hostage, and steals the time machine. Robert Noble, splendidly attired, makes a good appearance as Bach, but unfortunately the script gives him nothing to do, and he doesn’t utter a single line in the film. Bach’s Fight for Freedom, part of the highly regarded “Composers’ Specials Series,” is more substantial and fairly interesting, for both older children and adults. The setting is ¡7¡7, a critical year in Bach’s career, when he served as organist for Duke Wilhelm Ernst of Weimar. Frustrated in his attempts to be appointed Kapellmeister at the court, Bach was o›ered the Kapellmeister position at the court of Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Cöthen. Duke Wilhelm, however, didn’t want to release Bach from his employ and actually imprisoned the composer for three weeks. Bach’s Fight for Freedom dramatizes this incident, as seen through the eyes of Frederick, the twelve-year-old apprentice assigned to Bach when he requests an assistant. Ted Dykstra is refreshing as a dynamic Bach in his early thirties, enthusiastic about composing his own music and resentful of the stifling atmosphere of Duke Wilhelm’s\n\n13\n\ncourt at Weimar. He is continually told by the Kapellmeister to avoid composition and concentrate merely on performing the old, traditional hymns preferred by the duke in his chapel. Frederick quickly bonds with Bach, whose philosophy he admires more than that of his own father, Joseph, the duke’s valet, who wishes his son to follow in his footsteps. Frederick accompanies Bach when he sneaks away from the court to perform at a recital for Ernst August, the duke’s nephew, who is engaged to marry the sister of Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Cöthen. The duke is furious when he learns that Bach went to play at this event without his permission. Their relationship deteriorates further when he learns that Leopold has o›ered Bach a position. At home, Frederick continues to argue with his father, who always defends the duke no matter how unjust his behavior. When Bach is confined to his chambers, Joseph brings him his meals. He accuses Bach of trying to steal his son’s a›ection and tears apart the score that Bach was composing. “Now where’s your music?” he says in triumph. “You destroyed paper, that’s all,” Bach replies as he plays his new composition on the harpsichord. Bach then taps his head to show where his music is. The composer tells Joseph, “I could no more take your son than you could take my music.” Deeply moved, Joseph has a new respect for Bach, as well as for his own son, with whom he becomes reconciled. Later Joseph and his son confront the duke in an attempt to intercede on the composer’s behalf. Duke Wilhelm decides to release Bach, who takes his family and moves to Cöthen to assume his new position. There are many unforgettable moments in this teleplay. Bach’s recital for Prince Leopold is remarkable, a lively and sweeping reading that brings the Baroque style vividly to life. Young Frederick’s visit to the Bach home is quite memorable, with actress Tanya Posival quite good in the role of\n\n14\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach\n\nMaria Barbara Bach. Friedemann and C. P. E. Bach are also depicted in this lively scene as children. The success of this film is principally due to Dykstra, whose performance as a passionate Bach is a tremendous contrast to the “dusty old wig” portrayed in other films.\n\nProduction Credits Die Tänzerin von Sans Souci (¡932) AKA Barberina Aafa Film Cast: Lil Dagover, Otto Gebühr as Frederick the Great, Tosa Valetti, Hans Stüwe, Bernhard Goetzke, Hans Junkerrmann, Hans Mierendor›, Phillip Manning and Leo Monosson.

Noted actor Brian Blessed appears as Bach in several biographical sketches. Even more impressive is The Stations of Bach, a feature-length documentary hosted by violinist James Buswell, who visits many locations connected with the composer and\n\n15\n\nalso includes comments by Bach experts such as Christian Wol› and Paula Sutter Fichtner. The musical selections are very well selected and well performed. Hossick’s series on the great composers provides concise overviews of their lives and careers. Although principally intended for older children, adults will also find the series interesting and informative. The BBC Great Composers series, narrated by Kenneth Branagh, is a more adult approach, occasionally dry, but brimming with detail and first-rate musical examples. Cellist Yo-Yo Ma made a series of films called Inspired by Bach including performances of Bach’s six Suites for Unaccompanied Cello, filled with fascinating visual images. The final entry, Six Gestures, is one of the best episodes. Actor Tom McCampus is also featured as Bach in the production. Jon Kimura Parker is not only a virtuoso pianist, but also a first-rate musicologist whose witty and urbane presentations about the great composers are unique treasures. Twelve titles from his series aired on the Bravo cable network between ¡999 and 2002, and many of them have also been released on video.\n\nArnold Bax Screen depictions • Ken Russell in The Secret Life of Sir Arnold Bax (¡992)\n\nArnold Bax (¡883–¡953) is unique among modern composers since he never held a musical post or ever appeared in public in a performing capacity. Upon his graduation from the Royal Academy of Music in London in ¡905, Bax devoted himself entirely to composition. He carved out\n\na niche for himself for his composition with a Celtic influence. Extremely prolific, Bax is best known for his twenty-two symphonic poems, including In the Fairy Hills, November Woods, Tintagel and The Garden of Fand. In addition he composed seven symphonies, a large body of songs, choral works, solo piano pieces and chamber music. The only film to portray Sir Arnold Bax is a relatively conventional biopic by Ken Russell. An occasional actor, Ken Russell decided to play the role of Bax himself,\n\n16\n\nLudwig van Beethoven\n\nsince he was sixty-five years old and the film depicted the composer at the age of sixty-five. This is the only major part Russell ever played in his own films. The picture also marked the last screen appearance by Glenda Jackson, who shortly after making the film won a seat in Parliament and devoted herself to politics full time. Kenneth Colley appears in the picture as fellow composer John Ireland. The Secret Life of Sir Arnold Bax depicts the composer at a crossroads, having felt he lost his public. He revives his career in part by writing incidental music for films, composing the score for David Lean’s production of Oliver Twist (¡948) with Alec Guinness, Robert\n\nNewton and Anthony Newley. One of the film’s highlights shows the composer sneaking into the movie theater to listen to his music during the end credits.\n\nProduction Credits The Secret Life of Sir Arnold Bax (¡992) Dreamgrange cast: Ken Russell, Glenda Jackson, Hetty Baynes, Alan Arthur, Maurice Bush, Melissa Docker, Maureen Murray and Kenneth Colley as John Ireland.

Undoubtedly he transformed the music world to a greater degree than any other composer. He was also a tragic figure, becoming deaf while at the height of his powers at the beginning of the nineteenth century. He composed major works in almost all musical\n\nLudwig van Beethoven\n\nforms which have become the apex of each genre : nine symphonies, sixteen string quartets, thirty-two piano sonatas, ten violin sonatas, five cello sonatas and eight concertos (five for piano, one for oboe, one for violin and a triple concerto for piano, violin and cello). His output also contains many additional chamber pieces (including the Archduke Trio), piano works (such as the Diabelli Variations), choral works (the Missa Solemnis, cantatas and the oratorio Christ on the Mount of Olives), ballet (The Creatures of Prometheus), incidental music (such as Goethe’s Egmont), a large number of marches, minuets and concert overtures, as well as an immense number of songs. Finally, as if to show that even the greatest composers have o› days, he also penned a number of clunkers such as his tawdry battle symphony Wellington’s Victory, the cantata The Glorious Moment and the dreadful Germania! for bass soloist, chorus and orchestra. Feature films including Beethoven generally fall into two categories: cameos, usually in films about Napoleon Bonaparte or composers such as Schubert, Mozart or Rossini, and regular biopics. The later productions seem to focus principally on the identity of Beethoven’s “immortal beloved” and his battle with deafness. A few cover his tempestuous guardianship of his nephew Karl. Almost all open with the composer’s death, and then tell their story in one or more flashbacks. His struggle to gain recognition for his music, the paramount attribute of most composer films, is a comparatively minor feature in these e›orts. His music is portrayed as assertive, fresh and dynamic, and easily recognized by listeners as the work of a genius. Beethoven’s personality is also depicted as larger than life, and in a sense he became an archetype for the figure of the “heroic artist” in the age of Romanticism. It has even been suggested that major literary characters of the Romantic movement, such as Heathcli› in\n\n17\n\nEmily Brontë’s Wuthering Heights, were patterned to an extent after Beethoven. Since the concept of “tragic love” is a characteristic feature of the archetype, both writers and filmmakers are naturally drawn to the identity of Beethoven’s unknown love. After his death, a letter was found in a secret drawer of his desk. The ardent letter, addressed to his “immortal beloved,” is quite passionate and intense. But since the letter was in Beethoven’s possession, it is also likely that it was never sent. For years, Beethoven scholars have debated to whom this letter was written. Numerous candidates have been proposed by music historians drawing from the many women of Beethoven’s acquaintance, including four countesses, Giulietta Guiccardi, Therese Brunswick, Josephine Deym and Marie Erdody. Other names proposed include Amlie Sebald, Therese Malfatti, Dorothea von Ertmann, Magdalena Willmann, Betina von Arnim and Antonie Brentano (the leading contender in recent speculation). The most popular theory proposes that the letter was written in ¡8¡2. In any case, the controversy over this letter and the identity of the “immortal beloved” has come to overshadow many of the other events of the composer’s life. Another document written by Beethoven in ¡802 also had a great impact on how the composer is portrayed. This is the “Heiligenstadt Testament,” a letter addressed to his brothers, in which the composer describes the agony of his increasing deafness. Some have interpreted this as a suicide note, but it was also never sent. Simply expressing his deepest thoughts had a therapeutic e›ect for the troubled composer. The biopics have a tendency to concentrate on the identical group of musical selections: the second movement of the Eighth Piano Sonata “Pathétique,” the opening movement of the Fourteenth Piano Sonata “Moonlight,” the opening movement of the Fifth Symphony, the storm passage\n\n18\n\nLudwig van Beethoven\n\nfrom the Sixth Symphony “Pastoral” and the second movement of the Seventh Symphony. The “Ode to Joy” melody from the Ninth Symphony “Choral” manages to make an appearance as well, but seldom the same passage. Oddly enough, there is less consistent reliance on the Third Symphony “Eroica.” The earliest of the cameo films is Lützows Wilde Verwegene Jagd by filmmaker Richard Oswald, a film giant who has yet to receive his proper due. This is a silent drama set in Vienna in ¡8¡3 after Napoleon’s retreat from Russia. Poet Theodore Koerner leaves his love, actress Toni Adamberger, to fight with the Lützow battalion against the French. Desperate, Toni seeks him out and finds him dying on the battlefield. This film includes cameos of various historical figures, including Beethoven, Goethe and Napoleon. Beethoven makes an appearance in two other films featuring Napoleon. The first is Sascha Guitry’s elaborate but awkward ¡955 biopic Napoleon. Erich von Stroheim plays Beethoven in one of the last roles of his career. He is present in only one scene, entertaining the Austrian court in ¡8¡0. The camera focuses on him full face as he plays the Appassionata Sonata. Princess MarieLouise has a temper tantrum regarding the gift of a small portrait of Napoleon. She is then informed that a marriage contract has been drawn, and she will become empress of France. Calming down, she looks again at the portrait, this time with fascination. Observing this, Beethoven starts to improvise on themes from the last movement of his Eroica Symphony. In most prints, the scene fades out except for the sound of Beethoven’s playing which continues as the camera switches to a scene of Napoleon traveling in a coach. In the original script and other prints, however, a diplomat approaches Beethoven and questions if the composer originally dedicated this piece to Napoleon. “Ah yes,” he replied, “But then\n\nI crossed out his name. I wrote Eroica — Symphony for a Great Man. Like that, we can guess that it’s for him. It’s best that way.” Even though Napoleon’s name was removed from the dedication, this interpretation suggests that Beethoven remained sympathetic to the French emperor. In fact, after Napoleon’s death in ¡82¡, Beethoven said that the “Funeral March” from his Eroica Symphony had foreshadowed this event. Stroheim does not look very well in his short scene, and it is no more than a perfunctory appearance. Beethoven and Napoleon are both in the sophomoric but amusing time-travel comedy Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure. Unfortunately, the writers miss an opportunity by not having them interact. Bill and Ted are two teenage nerds who are contacted by scientists from the future who seek to help them pass their high school history course. They are given a time machine that looks like a phone booth. Bill and Ted decide to abduct famous characters from history for their “show and tell” history class project. They gather together a diverse group including Socrates, Abraham Lincoln, Genghis Khan, Billy the Kid, Sigmund Freud, Napoleon and Beethoven. The numerous jokes are neither subtle nor clever, and there are few, if any, genuine historical insights tossed into the mix. Beethoven’s deafness, for example, is totally ignored. Bill and Ted whisk him away from a salon recital in Kassel, Germany, in ¡8¡0, just after he finishes playing Für Elise on the piano. In modern times, Beethoven is taken to a shopping mall, where he learns about rock and other contemporary styles while sight reading sheet music on two electric organs simultaneously. When Beethoven is presented to the high school class, Ted says the composer’s favorite musical selections are Mozart’s Requiem, Handel’s Messiah and the songs of Bon Jovi. Cli›ord David brings zest but little perception to his shallow impersonation of the composer.\n\nLudwig van Beethoven\n\nThere are three Schubert biopics in which Beethoven is depicted. Das Dreimäderlhaus is actually a German operetta. Beethoven appears in three scenes, the first one actually opening the picture as Beethoven appears as the soloist at a concert performing his Fifth Piano Concerto “Emperor.” Ewald Balser, star of the biopic Eroica, is excellent in this cameo. Physically, he makes an impressive Beethoven. Balser has no lines but his facial expressions as the camera pans in on him subtly suggest his di‡culty in hearing his own playing. In the second scene, Balser portrays the composer on one of his traditional walks. In his head, he is composing the Egmont Overture and completely oblivious to those around him. In the third scene, he is conducting a rehearsal of Fidelio. He closes his eyes, lost in the music, unaware that the orchestra has broken down and stopped playing. He suddenly opens his eyes and notices that the orchestra members are staring at him in disbelief. He muttered that his conducting career has come to an end, as everyone in the rehearsal realizes that he is now totally deaf. He hands the baton over to the concertmaster, leaving the opera house. As he proceeds down the street, he has a look of both sorrow and resignation. In Melody Master, veteran character actor Albert Basserman plays an eccentric and rather mercurial Beethoven. Ilona Massey, as Anna, a Hungarian girl in love with Schubert, visits Beethoven’s apartment with the manuscript of a Schubert symphony. She finds his door ajar and a pot bubbling away on his stove. She removes it from the heat, and, as she turns, bumps into Beethoven, who says, “An unwatched pot always boils.” Basserman’s Beethoven is playful, continually teasing Massey. Using an ear trumpet, he continually prompts her to speak up, then when she shouts, he sputters, “I’m not deaf, you know.” After some banter, she presents\n\n19\n\nhim with the musical manuscript. Beethoven at first declines to look at it. Massey speaks resentfully to him while his back is turned, and he mutters (more to the film audience than to her), “Lucky for you I am deaf.” He then pages through the music score, and the soundtrack plays the opening of Schubert’s Unfinished Symphony. When he concludes his examination, Beethoven demands the third movement. “That’s all there is,” she replies. “He must finish it!” Beethoven declares that the composer is a genius and asks, “Why hasn’t he come himself to see me?” After Beethoven learns that the shy young man is unaware that he has seen the manuscript, he forbids Massey to let him know that he has seen it until the work is finished. Then he wants to surprise him personally and shake his hand in congratulation. Massey joyfully kisses Beethoven, thanking him for his appraisal. Serenade, a French film released in Paris about a month before the downfall of France in World War II, contains a brief Beethoven cameo by Auguste Bovério. Naturally, this film disappeared in the chaos that followed, and when the Vichy regime was created, the film was banned. In real life, Beethoven was aware of Schubert’s music, according to notations in his conversation book. He and Schubert did meet, and the younger man reportedly visited Beethoven during his last illness. Schubert was also a torchbearer at Beethoven’s funeral. In regard to Mozart, Beethoven is included in Wen die Götter Lieben, an Austrian film made during the Nazi era. The production itself seemed untainted by Nazi ideology. After the war, most of the footage was recut under the title The Mozart Story and dubbed for English-speaking audiences. New scenes were added featuring Haydn and Salieri to provide a spoken bridge between the various scenes of the original film. The Beethoven sequence, featuring René Deltgen, appears intact in\n\n20\n\nLudwig van Beethoven\n\nboth films, except dubbed into English for The Mozart Story. Beethoven appears unexpectedly at Mozart’s door, and the weary composer agrees to meet him. He asks Beethoven to play one of his compositions at the piano, and Beethoven plays a short mélange of themes from works composed many years later, such as the Moonlight Sonata. Mozart is very impressed and compliments Beethoven on his bold new approach. He warns him, however, that he will have to fight to get his music accepted. The scene is interesting, although it has several flaws. René Deltgen appears far too mature to play Beethoven here, since the composer was only seventeen years old when he met Mozart in ¡787. In real life, Mozart actually agreed to give Beethoven lessons and predicted that one day his pupil would “astound the world.” However, Beethoven’s mother fell seriously ill shortly thereafter, and Beethoven returned to his home in Germany. By the time he reappeared in Vienna, Mozart had died. The ¡99¡ anthology film Not Mozart also includes a Beethoven portrayal in the third of the six parts, titled Letters, Riddles and Writs. The setting is the celestial Composer’s Hall of Fame, as the busts of Beethoven and Haydn come to life and wonder why there has been a delay in Mozart’s induction into the Hall of the Immortals. The two composers share their reminiscences of Mozart and his music, and in a vision they visit the composer on his deathbed. Beethoven laments how hard Mozart had to struggle to earn his living, and Haydn replied that only Beethoven alone would be able to make the aristocracy pay a composer what he is worth. At the conclusion, Mozart’s bust joins Beethoven and Haydn in their place of honor in the afterlife. Finally, Beethoven is portrayed in two Rossini films. One of them, Rossini! Rossini! was intended for a major release in America, but the production met numer-\n\nous delays and finally fell between the cracks in terms of distribution. It was finally released only sporadically in several European markets. A video release had been promised but has not yet appeared. The other film was one of the last releases by the Italian film industry before the fall of Mussolini in ¡943. Il Duce was later rescued and propped up in a puppet state in northern Italy by the Nazis. In any case, Rossini was apolitical and was a rather well-done e›ort. The Beethoven segment is five minutes long, and in fact it is the finest cameo of them all. Set in ¡822, Rossini is escorted to Beethoven’s dark and gloomy apartment during a stormy night. The second movement from Beethoven’s Seventh Symphony is used as background music for the sequence. The cinematography is magnificent, shot entirely in shadows and half-light. Memo Benassi plays a somber, pensive, almost mystical figure. His chambers are dimly lit by a few candles and cluttered with manuscripts. A black cat is shown slinking away in the darkness as his housekeeper pours the composer a cup of tea. He waves her away, then rises to warmly shake Rossini’s hand, expressing his pleasure with his opera, The Barber of Seville, as the finest example of comic opera. Rossini asks if he knows his serious works, such as the operas Moses or Otello. Rossini reverently expresses his admiration to Beethoven, but the elderly composer points to his ear, signaling that he does not understand him. Rossini’s companion goes to Beethoven’s bookshelves and locates the scores of the two operas. He hands them to Beethoven. “Yes, I have read them, but you are better with mirthful music. Your every harmony is an expression of joy.” Beethoven suggests that he does not understand tragedy. As Rossini leaves, he tells Beethoven that he is a genius. His companion writes down his words for the composer. In reply, Beethoven sighs that he is an unhappy man. With this poignant line,\n\nLudwig van Beethoven\n\nthe camera shifts to the windows as the rain pours down and the scene slowly fades out. Turning to Beethoven biopics, the first actor to play Beethoven on screen was Fritz Kortner, a noted Viennese playwright, director and character actor who starred in a number of biographical dramas such as Dreyfus (¡930) and Danton (¡93¡). He also wrote the screenplay for his first American film, an alternate history drama, The Strange Death of Adolf Hitler (¡943). The Martyr of His Heart was his third screen appearance. The film, produced by Sascha, the leading Austrian film studio, debuted in August, ¡9¡6, and it is arranged in five acts, or “movements,” each portraying Beethoven at a di›erent point in his life, starting in Bonn in ¡790 up to his death in ¡827. Franz Joseph Haydn and Franz Schubert appear in cameos in the film as well. Events are fictionalized somewhat as the film focuses on the character of Baron Trautenfels as the villain of the story, continually attempting to thwart Beethoven. The baron manages to interfere in the composer’s love a›airs, including Anna, the daughter of an innkeeper, Countess Giulietta Guiccardi and Countess Therese Brunswick. Later Baron Trautenfels causes trouble by taking advantage of Beethoven’s nephew, Karl. The young man incurs heavy gambling debts to the baron, who drives him to attempt suicide. Filmographies occasionally list Kortner as starring in a film simply titled Beethoven in ¡927; however, no additional information seems to be available about this film, and it is probably a revival or reworking of The Martyr of His Heart. Once considered lost, a copy of The Martyr of His Heart was eventually located in Brazil, and the picture was reconstructed and revived in ¡996 with a soundtrack designed by Lynne Straub. The brilliant and innovative French filmmaker, Abel Gance, decided to make a film about Beethoven in the ¡930s. An ear-\n\n21\n\nlier Gance film, La Dixième Symphonie (¡9¡8) was a melodrama about a composer, Fred Ryce, who was obsessed with writing one symphony more than his idol, Beethoven. Un Grand Amour de Beethoven is a fascinating film with some magnificent moments, but it is also an uneven work with a number of awkward sequences. It becomes almost humorous at times, whenever Beethoven faces a crisis, to hear the opening notes of the Fifth Symphony blaze forth on the soundtrack. This is not really a biographical portrait of the composer, but a series of impressionistic vignettes, some based on historical events but others completely imaginary. At times, the picture dissolves into a montage of briefly seen images such as fragments of a musical score or scenery. The opening scene illustrates this. Beethoven is passing in the street, when he hears a commotion coming from a ground floor apartment. He peeks in and sees a mother lamenting her daughter who has just died in her bed. Beethoven enters the apartment, takes o› his coat and hat and sits at the piano. He plays the second movement of his Eighth Piano Sonata “Pathétique.” The mother stops crying, and images of her daughter, alive, appear on screen. These are her memories, inspired by Beethoven’s music. When the movement is finished, Beethoven quietly puts his coat back on and leaves, while the mother thanks him for his kind gesture. The only flaw in the scene is that the soundtrack switches to an orchestral arrangement of the music rather than leaving it as a piano solo, which would have been more e›ective. Harry Baur, sensational as Jean Valjean in Les Miserables (¡934) and as the mad monk in Rasputin (¡938), seems miscast in the opening scenes of the film, being too old and unconvincing to portray Beethoven at the age of thirty. He grows into the part, however, as Beethoven enters\n\n22\n\nLudwig van Beethoven\n\nmiddle age. Baur later provides a few unexpected surprises in his performance as well, such as when he sings a fragment of a Beethoven song quite movingly. As the title indicates, Beethoven’s frustrations in love form the core of the largely fictitious screenplay. The superficial Countess Giulietta Guiccardi is portrayed as Beethoven’s “immortal beloved,” whereas Countess Therese Brunswick is seen as being genuinely devoted to the composer, who instead pines for the mercurial Giulietta. One of the film’s finest moments occurs early in the film, in which Giulietta visits Beethoven for a piano lesson. She asks the composer to improvise on the piano while she breaks the news that she is ending their engagement. On the spot, Beethoven composes the opening movement of the Moonlight Sonata (which in fact is dedicated to the historical Giulietta Guiccardi). Baur is excellent, managing to hide his crushed feelings from Giulietta but not from the film audience. Beethoven’s increasing deafness is also well presented in the story. Gance makes innovative use of sound to contrast Beethoven’s reduced hearing with the normal hearing of those around him. Another highlight of the film is when Beethoven moves to a creaky, abandoned mill, reminiscent of the setting of the climax of Frankenstein (¡93¡). There, Beethoven writes out the Heiligenstadt Testament, expressing his despair over his loss of his hearing. Later, during a thunderstorm, his hearing is temporarily restored, and he apparently composes his Sixth Symphony “Pastoral” in appreciation. In fact, Beethoven was working on his Second Symphony at the time of the Heiligenstadt Testament; however, in terms of the combination of the visuals and the music, the scene is unparalleled, foreshadowing not only Fantasia (¡940) but also the concept of music videos. Beethoven comes to terms with his condition, but he undertakes a curious re-\n\nvenge on Giulietta, locking himself in the loft of the cathedral during her marriage ceremony and performing a dirge on the organ instead of a wedding march. Later, Beethoven announces his engagement to the faithful Therese but keeps putting o› the wedding date, and years pass. Just before the marriage, the fickle Giulietta leaves her husband and visits Beethoven, hoping to reignite their romance. Her ploy works at first, and Beethoven is overjoyed. He writes the “immortal beloved” letter to give to Giulietta. Therese, however, discovers the letter, and sheepishly Beethoven pretends he has written it for her. Therese takes the letter, and when she encounters Giulietta, she triumphantly shows it to her rival to demonstrate how much Beethoven loves her. Reading the letter, Giulietta is shattered and decides not to pursue Beethoven. At the end, the composer cancels his wedding to Therese. So deftly Gance transforms the “immortal beloved” letter into a tragic farce, with only Beethoven knowing to whom the letter was actually composed. Beethoven encounters Giulietta on two later occasions. In ¡8¡3, he runs into her and her young daughter at his publisher’s. The composer is now totally deaf, and he is unable to respond to her comments. He merely introduces Giulietta to his nephew Karl, who is about the same age as her own daughter. The screenplay then jumps to ¡827. Beethoven is dying, largely abandoned by Karl, who is presented as a wastrel. Giulietta, herself now destitute, lives near Beethoven’s lodgings and takes up an a›air with Karl, so she can hear news about Beethoven. When she learns the composer is dying, she stands outside his quarters in a blizzard and shrieks, “Ludwig!” The dying composer somehow senses she is there and seems to respond. He screams as a clap of thunder peals. The composer’s last moments are intercut with a concert of his Fifth Symphony. When he\n\nLudwig van Beethoven\n\nmutters in bed, “The comedy is over. Applaud,” it is followed by a shot of an ovation at the concert hall. Gance’s merging of sound and image is remarkable during the last sequence, including snatches on the soundtrack of the Fifth Symphony, the Egmont Overture and a song arrangement of the opening movement of the Moonlight Sonata. After Beethoven dies, his eyes are forced closed, and a close-up of his face fills the screen as the “Ode to Joy” from the Ninth Symphony accompanies the abbreviated end credits. In spite of the film’s obvious power and moments of genius, Un Grand Amour de Beethoven is ultimately weakened by the focus on Giulietta. The interpretation becomes a prism which distorts rather than o›ers insights into the life and times of Beethoven. The ¡949 Austrian film Eroica had limited distribution after its initial release, which is unfortunate because many reviews acclaimed Ewald Balser’s interpretation of Beethoven, particularly in his scenes with Oscar Werner, appearing in one of his earliest films as the nephew Karl. Judging by the e›ectiveness of Balser’s cameo in Das Dreimäderlhaus, he undoubtedly had a powerful conception of Beethoven in Eroica. The principal elements of the film concentrated on the composer’s battle with deafness and his increasing isolation. The ¡976 East German film, Beethoven—Tage aus einem Leben, received little distribution outside the Iron Curtain countries except for Finland. Donatas Banionis, who played Beethoven, was one of the most popular actors from Lithuania during this period, principally in Russian films. The Magnificent Rebel, one of the most unusual Disney projects, is more sophisticated than his usual productions, but it also contains a certain amount of hokum that prevents the film from being genuinely first rate. The Magnificent Rebel was released theatrically in Europe but debuted\n\n23\n\nas a two-part episode on Walt Disney Presents on American television. Briefly, the plot follows Beethoven from ¡792 through ¡824, concentrating on his failed romance with Giulietta Guiccardi, his struggle to compose his music, his battle with deafness and his eventual acceptance of his condition. Beethoven is played excellently by Carl Bohm, who had recently played Schubert in Das Dreimäderlhaus. Bohm is the son of conductor Karl Bohm, one of the leading conductors of the twentieth century. So Bohm is completely convincing during scenes in which he conducts or plays the piano. Being a younger actor at the time this film was made, Bohm is completely successful in portraying Beethoven at age twenty-two in the opening scenes. Then, with superb makeup, he is aged quite e›ectively for the composer’s middle and later years. The script ignores the “immortal beloved” episode and eliminates nephew Karl entirely. It is uneven, however, and scrambles facts indiscriminately. For example, the very first minute of the picture contains a number of errors. The year is given as ¡792, and Beethoven tells another passenger in his coach that he is making his first visit to Vienna. This is incorrect, because Beethoven was in Vienna in ¡787, when he was briefly a pupil of Mozart. Then the narrator claims that France is looking to Napoleon for leadership. Again, this is false, since Napoleon was an unknown o‡cer in ¡792 who didn’t distinguish himself until the siege of Toulon in December, ¡793. Other errors abound. While taking a walk in the country, Beethoven sits down under a tree and starts to jot down some music using a modern pen, a clear anachronism. However, the film is scrupulous about using pianos of the proper era and organs that require pumping. Beethoven is depicted as actively hostile to the aristocracy, which is somewhat misleading. The composer readily accepted\n\n24\n\nLudwig van Beethoven\n\ntheir patronage, but he demanded that he be treated as an equal, if not a superior, due to his status as an artist. Beethoven’s deafness is first noticed at the debut of his Fifth Piano Concerto “Emperor,” which was composed in ¡809, almost ten years after his hearing problems first arose. Then Beethoven is depicted as being unable to conduct the debut of Fidelio due to his deafness, yet in ¡806, the composer successfully performed as a conductor in leading the revised version of the opera, which initially debuted one year earlier. Even more confusing, the film substitutes the Fifth Symphony for the successful ¡800 concert at which Beethoven debuted his First Symphony. Toward the end of his career, Beethoven is depicted as composing his hymn “Der Ehre Gottes in der Natur” (“The Worship of God in Nature”), while walking with a young blind boy who helps him accept his disability (one of the artificial and corny scenes). However this composition was actually written many years earlier, in ¡803. In spite of these numerous inaccuracies, The Magnificent Rebel has many unforgettable moments, as well as exceptional cinematography, fine acting by all the players, wonderful art direction and excellent musical excerpts, such as when Beethoven improvises the opening of the Fifth Symphony on the piano when his landlord knocks at his door or when he and Giulietta play his Turkish March from The Ruins of Athens arranged for piano, four hands. The two concert sequences are simply breathtaking and are the highlights of the film. The first is the concert performance of the Fifth Symphony, brilliantly filmed and edited, and includes a generous portion of the symphony. For example, the opening few minutes of the symphony are heard complete. The camera then cuts away to Giulietta and her father passing by in a carriage. Forbidden by her father to attend, Giulietta stares longingly at the con-\n\ncert hall as a fragment of the second movement is heard. When the camera returns to the hall, the bridge passage leading from the third to the fourth movement is played. The last movement is heavily edited, but it is intelligently cut. The concert scene lasts almost a full eight minutes, a remarkable length in a feature film. The Magnificent Rebel concludes with a fairly accurate recreation of the premiere of the Ninth Symphony on May 7, ¡824. One notable error, however, is the depiction of Prince Carl Lichnowsky as sponsoring the concert. Lichnowsky, one of Beethoven’s most dedicated patrons, died in ¡8¡4. The length of this scene is also eight minutes, but the editing of the music is less skillful. The first three movements of the piece are ignored, making it seem that the symphony opens with the fourth movement. As described by eyewitnesses of the actual concert, Beethoven stands to the right of the conductor, score in hand, following the music. Although stone deaf at this point, the composer was able nevertheless to feel the vibrations of the massed instruments, particularly the percussion. Bohm manages to convey this with his facial expressions and gestures. The entire sequence is very poignant, especially when Beethoven is turned to witness and acknowledge the enthusiastic reaction of the audience. The debut of the Ninth Symphony is repeated in the remaining Beethoven features, but none more accurately or impressively than in The Magnificent Rebel. Beethoven’s Nephew is a rather bleak film, concentrating as it does on the composer’s obsessive relationship with his nephew Karl, when he served as his guardian beginning in ¡8¡5. Except for a brief flashback to that year, most of the picture focuses on the last five years of the composer’s life, when after years of litigation with Johanna, the boy’s mother, Beethoven’s custody is confirmed. Although\n\nLudwig van Beethoven\n\nbased on a novel, most of the events in the film are fairly close to the historical record. The principal flaw is that events are too often telescoped together, so that it appears that Karl’s suicide attempt occurs a few days after the premiere of the Ninth Symphony in May ¡824, when in actuality it occurred over two years later in July ¡826. The film suggests that Karl brought on his uncle’s death after he caught a chill in a December carriage trip to Vienna. The film portrays Beethoven as dying immediately afterward. The actual record is somewhat di›erent. Beethoven recovered from his chill but then had a relapse somewhat later which brought on jaundice and dropsy, and most historians blame Beethoven’s death on cirrhosis of the liver. Despite the actual cause of the composer’s death, it is clear that he was an oppressive guardian to Karl, sometimes brutally strict, at other times doting and sentimental. Any child raised under these circumstances from the age of nine would undoubtedly be scarred for life. Karl felt persecuted by his uncle, and after the suicide attempt, Beethoven aged dramatically as he realized how he had failed in his relationship with his nephew. Wolfgang Reichmann is admirable and convincing as the dark, driven and most unpleasant Beethoven. He instinctively knows how to control the nuances of his performance, particularly when to relent and show the composer’s softer side. When Uncle Ludwig catches Karl fornicating with the maid while visiting Countess Erdody, his anger passes quickly. He doesn’t carry on raging and bellowing but confesses to Karl that he was just like him at his age when he picked up the venereal infection that resulted in his deafness. Karl, played with appropriate hardness by Dietmar Prinz, looks at his uncle with rare compassion after this admission. Many viewers might find Beethoven’s Nephew di‡cult to watch, since Reichmann’s Bee-\n\n25\n\nthoven and Prinz’s Karl are both rather unlikable. Nathalie Baye, Karl’s actress girlfriend Lenore, is the only character to show true humanity. When Beethoven comes to appeal to her to give up Karl, she is greatly moved by his plea, especially when he tells her that Karl means far more to him than even his music. She writes a note in the composer’s book, but the message is never shared with the audience. Instead, she quietly leaves, acceding to Beethoven’s request. There are a few irritating flaws in the production. Beethoven’s deafness is not well portrayed. At this point in his life, Beethoven was stone deaf, but in the film it seems to vary. At times, Reichmann responds to comments made behind his back. At other times, he seems unable to lip read when someone is speaking slowly and directly at him. The premiere of the Ninth Symphony is poorly staged. The film has Beethoven himself starting to conduct the first movement, but the orchestra breaks down after a few measures. The composer is then guided to a chair as a substitute conductor leads the work. The cinematography is rather haphazard. The chorus is present, for example, but they are never shown while they are singing. There are numerous piano excerpts throughout the film that are well handled. The soundtrack relies principally on the third movement of the Ninth Symphony as background music, but oddly enough the film credits fail to identify any performers of the music. Beethoven’s Nephew may not be every filmgoer’s cup of tea, since it is unrelenting in its grim and dour interpretation, but it is superbly directed by Paul Morrissey, who sees the work more as a metaphor of the human condition than a composer film. Beethoven Lives Upstairs is a delightful fictional treatment based on a children’s book about Christoph, a young Viennese\n\n26\n\nLudwig van Beethoven\n\nboy whose father, a doctor, has recently died, forcing his mother to take in tenants. Her brother-in-law arranges for a single boarder to occupy a suite of rooms, the composer Beethoven. Since in real life, Beethoven lived in over seventy di›erent apartments during a thirty-year period, the concept of using this as the setting of a story is an excellent one. When Beethoven moves in, Christoph’s mother is patient, kind and tolerant, but her son is enraged by the intruder, who bullies the servants, scrawls musical notation on the walls and behaves like a wild man. Slowly, they begin a friendship, as Christoph learns about Beethoven’s deafness and the reasons behind his strange antics. They go for long walks together and share their innermost thoughts. Soon Christoph becomes the composer’s “gatekeeper,” protecting him from unwanted intruders as he finishes work on his Ninth Symphony. Finally, the symphony is in the early stages of preparation, and rehearsals for the soloists are held in Beethoven’s chambers. At the conclusion, Christoph and his mother are given tickets by Beethoven to be his guests at the debut of the Ninth Symphony. Although filmed and conceived as a children’s story, the presentation is sophisticated enough to interest an adult audience as well. The film has a number of special moments, such as when Beethoven asks Christoph’s mother to play the piano for him. She meekly plays Für Elise, and when the composer asks who wrote it, she points to him, saying, “You did.” He then collapses in laughter, muttering, “Beethoven, you old donkey!” In another touching scene, Christoph gives the composer an ear trumpet that was designed by his late father to demonstrate that not all doctors are quacks, as Beethoven had commented earlier. Beethoven’s deafness and various methods of communication are more realistically and accurately portrayed in Bee-\n\nthoven Lives Upstairs than in any other film. In a way, this short film serves as an ideal counterpoint to the outrageous and revolting Beethoven in the previous film by Paul Morrissey. Nephew Karl, however, is neither seen nor referred to in this treatment. Neil Munro plays the composer in colorful broad strokes, somewhat tonguein-cheek, but nevertheless credible. He is first seen naked from the waist up, tossing water from a basin onto his head. (This almost seems a recurring motif as most of the Beethoven films contain a similar scene.) The musical excepts are excellent, although the concert at the film’s conclusion betrays the limited budget available for the production. The film wrongly depicts Beethoven as conducting the premiere of the Ninth Symphony. Beethoven Lives Upstairs proved to be a popular success, and director David Devine developed an entire series of children’s films based on the style and approach of this film. Immortal Beloved is a highly entertaining mixture of fact, fiction and outlandish supposition. At its heart is a startling theory about the identity of Beethoven’s “immortal beloved,” but one that enjoys little support from most scholars. This innovative project adapts Orson Welles’ Citizen Kane (¡94¡) as its structural model. The film opens with Beethoven’s death, just as Citizen Kane opens with Charles Foster Kane’s death. Instead of the mystery of “Rosebud,” the film depicts Anton Schindler, Beethoven’s secretary, discovering the “immortal beloved” letter and dedicating himself to learning her identity so that she can become the composer’s legal heir instead of his brother Johann or nephew Karl. Schindler learns that many years earlier, the immortal beloved had agreed to elope with the composer. They planned to meet at the Swann Hotel in Carlsbad, but Beethoven was late due to a carriage mishap. By the time he arrived, the immortal beloved had left, breaking\n\nLudwig van Beethoven\n\n27\n\nGary Oldman authentically captures Beethoven’s intense style as a performer in Immortal Beloved.\n\ntheir agreement. Schindler uncovers the signature of the immortal beloved from the records of the hotel, but the name is illegible. Still, he believes he can use this signature to match the handwriting of the composer’s mysterious and elusive lover. Schindler sets out to question the various possibilities, such as Giulietta Guiccardi and Marie Erdody, who recall their involvement with Beethoven, with lengthy flashbacks of the composer as seen through their eyes. This parallels the reporter in Citizen Kane, hunting up and interviewing personages from Kane’s past, who reveal their sometimes di›ering viewpoints in flashbacks. When Countess Erdody questions Schindler (largely about Beethoven’s relationship with his nephew), Schindler’s private memories are also depicted. Unlike the Kane reporter, Schindler is eventually successful in his endeavors. He discovers that the immortal beloved is Johanna, his brother’s wife and the mother\n\nof Karl. In addition, the screenplay proposes, as biographer Robert Schau›er once implied in his study Beethoven: The Man Who Freed Music, that Karl was actually Beethoven’s son, not the son of his brother Caspar. Since in real life, Beethoven had an intense loathing of Johanna, this conclusion is a bit far fetched, but it provides an intriguing, if fantastic, story. The film then proclaims that Beethoven’s deafness was the result of childhood beatings at the hands of his father. The child-abuse theory had been proposed previously, but the evidence supporting this theory is inconclusive. In any case, the conjecture opens up a new line of thought to explain the composer’s explosive personality. Immortal Beloved is a quality production on all counts. The acting is uniformly good, particularly Gary Oldman as the composer and Jeroen Krabbé as Schindler. Oldman’s charisma really lifts the film to a higher plain, although his\n\nLosing his hearing, Beethoven (Gary Oldman) can only listen to his playing by placing his ear on the piano.\n\nLudwig van Beethoven\n\nmakeup is too exaggerated in the later scenes, in which he looks as if he were in his late eighties. The deathbed meeting with Johanna is handled splendidly (providing a di›erent interpretation to the words “Must it be?” and “It must be!” that were written in the score of Beethoven’s last work, his String Quartet, op. ¡35). When Beethoven died, he was only fifty-seven. The cinematography has sweep and style. One brilliant sequence shows Beethoven’s memories while standing before the orchestra and chorus during the finale of the Ninth Symphony. Leo Faulkner plays Beethoven as a youth, as he runs away from his abusive father to float in a lake at night. As the camera pans back, the lake reflects the stars in the sky, making the youth appear as if he is floating in the heavens. This image is extremely impressive, accompanied by the triumphant choral passage from the “Ode to Joy.” There are a number of other equally memorable moments: Beethoven playing the piano with his ear pressed against the instrument so he can hear it, or Beethoven smashing up the hotel room after he learns the immortal beloved had abandoned him. This also parallels Citizen Kane when the tycoon smashes up the bedroom after his wife leaves him. At the very close of the film, Schindler discovers that Johanna missed her assignation with Beethoven because she assumed he was not going to appear. She overlooked the composer’s letter when it arrived because it was tucked under a tray of food that was sent to her room. She never read it, but Beethoven assumed she had. When he arrives late, he feels betrayed. Each mistakenly believed that they had been abandoned by the other. That is why Beethoven appeared so hostile to Johanna when she married his brother Caspar. There are many interesting and remarkable scenes in the film, such as when Beethoven visits Caspar and Johanna to re-\n\n29\n\ntrieve a lost manuscript and finds his brother dying of consumption. Karl is presented as far more likable than in Beethoven’s Nephew. His main fear is that his uncle doesn’t realize, due to his deafness, that he is not really a pianist of concert caliber. Karl asks Schindler to intercede for him with his uncle to plead that he lacks the talent. The musical segments are excellent as well, with Sir Georg Solti serving as music adviser and conductor for the selections. Among the highlights, the entire first movement (and most of the second) of the Pathétique Sonata is heard, although mingled with voiceover narration. The soundtrack also includes generous portions of the Missa Solemnis and the Fifth Piano Concerto “Emperor.” The last two movements of the concerto play over the final scenes of the film (when Schindler presents Johanna with the “immortal beloved” letter and she reads it for the first time) and through the end credits. The most recent Beethoven film is a telefilm by the BBC titled Eroica. The setting is one day in the life of Beethoven in June ¡804, during which his Third Symphony “Eroica” received its first performance at the palace of Prince Lobkowitz in Vienna. At the time this was written, the film had not yet been broadcast, but a print had been theatrically previewed and well received except for the cinematography, which had been initially described as somewhat dreary and poorly lit. The script and performances, however, were highly praised. The credits listed here are therefore tentative. In closing, it is interesting to note that two other major actors, Conrad Veidt and Sir Anthony Hopkins, were signed to play the role of Beethoven. Abel Gance at one point planned to include a Beethoven scene in his silent Napoleon (¡927), but eventually he limited his scope in this film to Napoleon up to his first campaign in Italy in ¡797. Sir Anthony Hopkins was scheduled to star as the composer\n\n30\n\nLudwig van Beethoven\n\nin a Ken Russell production, The Beethoven Secret, in ¡980, but financing fell through one week before this production was scheduled to begin. Jodi Foster, Glenda Jackson and Charlotte Rampling were also slated to appear in the film.\n\nProduction Credits The Martyr of His Heart (¡9¡8) Sascha Film Cast: Fritz Kortner, Else Heller and Nelly Hochwald.
