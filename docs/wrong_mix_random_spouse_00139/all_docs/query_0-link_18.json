        "text": "The audio version of Britney Spears's memoir \"The Woman in Me\", narrated by actress Michelle Williams, is earning positive review. The Oscar-nominated actress plays various roles as she brings her voice down to a whisper, uses it for emphasis or even adopts different affectations when playing the singer and her family members, Justin Timberlake, Mariah Carey and more.\n\nListeners of the audio version will feel the author (Britney Spears)'s pain when Williams reads about the Louisiana native coping with her father's alcoholism during her childhood or problems in her relationship with Timberlake.\n\nOne of the audio version that is going viral across social media is when Michelle Williams imitates Britney's former boyfriend Justin Timberlake when he \"tried too hard to fit in\" with Black artists such as Ginuwine.\n\nAt one point, Williams makes her voice sassy when referring to Spears's estranged younger sister, Jamie Lynn Spears, as \"a total b****.\"\n\nWilliams also briefly portrays Mariah Carey, as Spears recalls taking a photo with the singer, who's gone on to become one of her supporters.\n\nSimilar Topic: Oscar-nominated Actress Michelle Williams Narrates Audiobook of Britney Spears' Memoir 'The Woman in Me'\n\nHere is a statement from the executive director of the nonprofit Audio Publishers Association, on Michelle Williams being a good match for Spears' book:\n\n​\n\n\"She understands how to inhabit and play different characters. And when you are reading the book and you are reading all of the parts, you have to be able to play those different characters, have an emotional connection to those different characters and be able to — frankly, it's kind of an amazing thing — slide from one character into the next instantaneously.\"\n\n\"It's really very recent that celebrities have been narrating their own audiobooks... and it's not everyone's skillset. It is hard to read an audio book. It's physically taxing. It's emotionally taxing, especially if it's your own story and you're dealing with some trauma. So having someone else read it who can be a little personally removed and a good performer could actually be a better listening experience.\"\n\nBritney Spears' voice could only be heard in a short introduction of the audio version. She explained that \"Reliving everything that you're about to hear has been exciting, heart-wrenching and emotional, to say the least.\" This is the reason Spears did not voice her entire memoir.\n\nThe Recording Academy, the organization that presents the Grammys, confirms that Williams is eligible for the category of Best Audio Book, Narration & Storytelling Recording at the 67th annual Grammy Awards in 2025. A win would put her on the path to securing an EGOT, since she already has an Emmy, and the other trophies aren't out of the question. Michelle Williams has received one nomination for a Tony and five nods for an Oscar.\n\nSource: Yahoo\n\nPop star Britney Spears writes in her memoir titled The Woman in Me that in her relationship with Justin Timberlake, she became pregnant. Spears later wrote that she underwent the procedure of abortion because Timberlake was not ready to become a father.\n\nSpears and Timberlake started dating in their late teens until early 20s (1999-2002).\n\nSimilar Topic: Oscar-nominated Actress Michelle Williams Narrates Audiobook of Britney Spears' Memoir 'The Woman in Me'\n\nHere is a statement from Britney Spears in her memoir: The pregnancy \"was a surprise, but for me, it wasn't a tragedy. I loved Justin so much. I always expected us to have a family together one day. This would just be much earlier than I'd anticipated.\"\n\nThe memoir revealed Timberlake's feeling about her pregnancy. Spears wrote: \"He said we weren't ready to have a baby in our lives, that we were way too young.\"\n\nSpears then revealed that if it was up to her alone, she would've never gotten an abortion. And yet Justin was so sure that he didn't want to be a father. She then describe the experience as one of the most agonizing things I have ever experienced in my life.\"\n\nBritney Spears' Memoir \"The Woman in Me\" will be available next Tuesday (October 24th).\n\nSource: EW"
