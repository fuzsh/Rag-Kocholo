        "text": "If you were expecting to see Jamie Lynn Spears appearing on your screens tonight at 9pm on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here then you're going to be severely disappointed because the actress and singer has officially left the Australian jungle on medical grounds.\n\nIn their official statement, they said, 'Jamie Lynn Spears has left I‚Äôm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here! on medical grounds. She‚Äôs been a fantastic campmate who has triumphed at trials and bonded well with her fellow celebrities.'\n\nI'm A Celeb hosts Ant and Dec confirmed the news on Wednesday night's episode with Ant telling viewers, 'We‚Äôve got some breaking news for you, Jamie Lynn Spears has left the camp on medical grounds.\n\nDec then added, 'The good news is, Jamie Lynn is doing fine and she goes away with our best wishes.'\n\nDespite not opening up about the reason for her departure, Jamie Lynn Spears has now revealed that she will be taking some time to recover with her family.\n\nShe took to Instagram to write, 'I can‚Äôt wait to share with y‚Äôall everything about this once in a lifetime experience, but I don‚Äôt even know where to start when trying to describe what an incredibly special time and place I had with some of the absolute best humans I have ever met and consider family now.\n\n'THANK YALL for welcoming me into your living rooms night after night, and for supporting me through all the highs and lows. I‚Äôm am so grateful for this show, and all of the wonderful people apart of it! I will be taking some time to recover, and spend time with my family, but looking forward to sharing all about my journey on @imacelebrity with everyone! LOVE YALLLL ü§çü§ç'\n\nJamie Lynn Spears is the second star to leave I'm A Celeb 2023 early for medical reasons, following Grace Dent's exit earlier this week.\n\nDuring her week in the I‚Äôm A Celebrity‚Ä¶ Get Me Out Of Here jungle, mum-of-two Jamie Lynn has been visibly struggling being away from her children - as well as being particularly open about how challenging she's finding the ITV show.\n\nDuring one particularly tough moment which saw her campmates fail to win her luxury item - a picture of her children - she shared how she was close to leaving the show. ‚ÄòI quit, I don‚Äôt wanna do it,' she said in the camp hut confessional. 'I do not wanna be there. I went to tell them [the producers] this is not fair. I quit. I don‚Äôt wanna do it, I don‚Äôt wanna be here, that‚Äôs so unfair that was torture. F**k this.‚Äô\n\nViewers expected to see her make an early departure in scenes last week, especially after tabloid rumours circulated that Jamie Lynn was likely to only stay in the jungle for as long as is contractually required to receive the fee for appearing on the show.\n\nAs is now a well-known fact with viewers, contestants on I'm A Celeb don't get paid for their stint in the jungle until they've completed three days - meaning that Jamie Lynn's will still pocket her fee."
