        "text": "Singer and actress Jamie Lynn Spears is now adding best-selling author to her resumé!\n\nShe took to Instagram on Thursday to share the happy news with her fans.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nJamie Lynn Spears Thanks Her Fans For Their Support\n\n“I can’t believe I’m officially a NATIONAL BEST SELLING AUTHOR!” she wrote. “I have no words except how grateful I am that I was able share my story with y’all.”\n\nShe added, “This has been one of the most challenging and vulnerable things I have ever done and I just honestly can’t thank y’all enough for the support and kindness.”\n\nMany fans stood behind her and applauded her recent triumph.\n\n“Yassss mama!” one fan wrote. “It's not easy being vulnerable & sharing your truth not knowing how it will be received...but you did it! So inspiring! You're helping more than you know.”\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nHowever, many fans have been critical of her new book. Older sister Britney Spears has accused her of fabricating events for the sake of selling books. In one lengthy public Twitter message, Britney asked her little sister to “please please stop with these crazy lies for the Hollywood books.”\n\nJamie Lynn responded to her sister through her Instagram stories, writing, “Nobody trashes your name more than someone who’s afraid you’ll tell people the truth.”\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nBut What Do The Fans Think?\n\nAt the time of this writing, Jamie Lynn’s memoir “Things I Should Have Said: Family, Fame, and Figuring It Out” has 286 ratings on Amazon. It has an overall rating of 2.6 out of 5 stars. 31% of those ratings are 5-star reviews, while 51% are 1-star reviews. The rest fall somewhere in between two and four stars.\n\nMany of the top reviews are one-star reviews left on the day the book was released.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n“I read this book and a lot of the things that were stated are lies,” one user wrote. “She mentioned things about Britney Spears, Sam Lufti and her old costar Alexi which all publicly called Jaime Lynn a liar. Also, Jaime Lynn stated this book is not about Britney, however she mentions Britney 230 times for clout. I do not recommend this book at all.”\n\n“This book is the story about a corrupt family and how they stayed silent witnessing abuse, exploitation and human trafficking all because of greed,” another user wrote. “Wouldn’t recommend buying or reading this book.”\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n“More of a tell-all than a memoir,” another added. “While we can’t know the facts behind the scenes, her account of events feels disingenuous and dramatized with a skew towards the author’s moral infallibility. All of the stories are intended to present Jamie Lynn as a bullied martyr, but they end up falling flat when, every time, everyone in the world is at fault but her.”\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nOkay, But What Do The Positive Reviews Say?\n\nOne 5-star review read, “I think the book was great and loved learning about her childhood and what she experienced growing up. Easy read and enjoyable.”\n\nAnother 5-star review said that Jamie Lynn was “honoring her voice & story.”\n\n“As a Britney fan it was nice to learn more about her family and her sister,” one user wrote. “Her sister has her own perspective and she has a right to her own story, her own voice, her own side. I think it was brave to share about her childhood and her background because we all can get a bigger picture of her family dynamics.”\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n“The story of Jamie Lynn’s pregnancy, toxic relationship, experience as a songwriter in Nashville, and then her commitment to her now husband, is inspiring,” they continued. “The story of her daughter’s accident brought me to tears. I am happy for her that she found stability, healing, and faith from that miracle and I’m thankful that she was bold enough to share her story with the world. I can’t imagine what it must be like to grow up in the Spears family but she’s a strong individual she has turned out to be. She’s a survivor.”\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n“Really enjoyed this book,” another wrote. “I’ve always been a fan of Britney, however I do not believe Jamie Lynn is to blame for Britney's troubles and feel she is entitled as much as anyone else to share her life experiences. It is so obvious from this book that she has also been through a difficult time. I hope she and her sister both find peace and can become close again.”"
