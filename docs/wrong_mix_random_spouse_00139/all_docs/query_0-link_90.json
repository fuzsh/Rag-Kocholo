        "text": "The Girls\n\nA little girl lives below me and cries\n\nevery day. I thought she must be sick,\n\nor they beat her. My daughter used\n\nto cry like that when I put her to bed,\n\nand I was sure the neighbors would call\n\nthe cops. This was back when people\n\nin the building across from us regularly shot\n\nat each other, set fires, little boys yelled,\n\n“Hey Honkey!” at us when we walked\n\nto the playground. The little crying girl’s\n\nolder sister played with my daughter\n\nfor hours one Saturday. My daughter\n\nbrought the littlest girl to my bathroom,\n\nbleeding. She never speaks around me,\n\nbut she smiled when my daughter put on\n\nthe princess bandage and gathered snacks\n\nso they could watch a movie in the girls’\n\napartment. I kept my door, my windows,\n\nopen, kept going out into the hall to listen.\n\nThey treated her like a queen. The older girl\n\ngave my daughter a pretty box with beads\n\nand a little doll in it and a note that said, “You\n\nwill be apriciated.” Their father opens\n\nthe door when he sees me coming to the building.\n\nA lot of the neighbors do. Nights, he’ll sit\n\non the stoop, smoking, unless\n\nthe ICE agents are making raids.\n\n.\n\nDreamcatcher\n\nHer hair is a tangled field of sweet straw\n\nknocked crooked in heavy winds, catching\n\nany light that stumbles nearby. Maybe this\n\nis why she radiates heat, when I’m trying\n\nto nap, sick, on the couch and she perches high\n\non my side watching screaming cartoons. Dazzled\n\nstrangers stop us on sidewalks to remind us\n\nin case we’ve forgotten: life isn’t always gray. It’s not.\n\nBees follow us to get at the pollen they can smell\n\ntrapped in the mess. I thump them away\n\nwhen they get too close and scare her. If I had time,\n\nI’d learn to collect their honey, walk her through\n\nthe sweetest fields, open a boutique to pay\n\nfor college. But I can barely remember to stop smiling\n\nlong enough to thank the policeman for the speeding\n\nticket most mornings. Brushes are an enemy to her,\n\nthe confining toil of hair ties lead to tears. Stickers lost\n\nare found. Twigs. Fuzz. All of it down the drain after\n\nthe bath water has straightened her locks. It won’t last.\n\n.\n\nVenus\n\nA girl once told me the moon wasn’t the moon\n\nwhen it’s visible during the day; it’s Venus.\n\nI believed her because I wanted it to be love.\n\nI’m always mistaking the movements\n\nof the planets for something meaningful. Things\n\nare always falling, and if they’re fast or far\n\nenough, they look like fire. The problem\n\nis when you try to catch them and find\n\nthere’s nothing but ashes left, littering\n\nthe ground, melting everyone’s soles. That girl\n\nwas fire, and all I could do was make\n\na wish as she fell. They never come true.\n\nShe taught me that, also.\n\nArtist Statement: A friend once said we’re writers because we’re damaged in such a way that this is how we communicate best. This is definitely true for me. Writing is how I process my thoughts and feelings about things and try to figure out how to live in the world. Lately, much of my time is consumed by my daughter. This is a very good thing. It helps me get out of my head. So, I’ve been writing about parenting a lot. It’s a good way to catalog our experiences and to examine them for insight. A couple of these poems are from a manuscript I’m working on about my daughter and my experiences parenting. A lot of the poems in that manuscript were written during some pretty bleak times, but I think there’s hope in them."
