        "text": "Jamie Lynn Spears, the younger sister of pop superstar Britney Spears, has left I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here!\n\nThe singer and actress became the second celebrity to exit the ITV show this week, after restaurant critic Grace Dent bowed out on Monday.\n\nSpears’ last appearance on the show was on Wednesday night’s instalment of the programme.\n\nWhy did Jamie Lynn Spears quit ‘I’m a Celeb’?\n\nJamie Lynn Spears left show on medical grounds, a spokesperson for the show announced yesterday.\n\nA statement read: “Jamie Lynn Spears has left I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! on medical grounds.\n\n“She’s been a fantastic campmate, who has triumphed at trials and bonded well with her fellow celebrities.”\n\nAt the start of last night’s episode, Anthony McPartlin told viewers: “We’ve got some breaking news for you: Jamie Lynn Spears has left the camp on medical grounds.”\n\nHis co-host, Declan Donnelly, added: “The good news is, Jamie Lynn is doing fine and she goes away with our best wishes.”\n\nLater on in the show, This Morning host Josie Gibson announced to the jungle campmates that the 32-year-old had left.\n\nSpears became the second celebrity to leave the jungle on medical grounds this year after restaurant critic Grace Dent bowed out earlier this week.\n\nThe American star had cried during Tuesday’s show and then told fellow campmates: “I feel a little better, maybe. I just need to cry and let it out.”\n\nAlso on the show, the Zoey 101 star had spoken about her relationship with her sister and revealed the pair had a “very complicated upbringing”, which led to them having issues with each other.\n\nWhat happened last night?\n\nOn Wednesday’s episode, soap star Nick Pickard and former UKIP leader Nigel Farage were the latest campmates tasked with facing a bushtucker trial.\n\nWhen they arrived at the clearing, it was revealed that the duo would be facing a challenge called In Too Deep.\n\nThe pair were required to free stars trapped at the bottom of two giant water tanks by releasing the spanners on the side of the tank.\n\nThe campmates had 11 minutes to retrieve 11 stars and ended the challenge with a total of six.\n\nFarage decided to pass on a number of the tasks, which involved him holding his breath underwater, before he finally announced: “I’m a celebrity, get me out of here.”\n\nAlso on the show, Farage asked internet personality Nella Rose if he had upset her, to which she said: “I just feel like you were very dismissive about cultural appropriation yesterday.”\n\nShe then said: “I don’t have an issue with you.\n\n“Like I said to you a couple of days ago, you are always going to have your opinions and I’m always going to have my opinions and we can agree to disagree, but let’s just not be the best of buds.\n\n“Because clearly we’re just from two different sides of the world and you’ll never understand my issues and struggles.”\n\nOn Tuesday’s episode, Rose said she was “disappointed” with the GB News host, following a conversation where Farage said cultural appropriation was “can’t win territory”.\n\nI’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here! continues on ITV1 and ITVX."
