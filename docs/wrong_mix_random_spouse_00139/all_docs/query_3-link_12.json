She guest starred as herself in the episode The Mansion Family. Her song \"Oops!... I Did It Again” is featured in Dude, Where's My Ranch?.\n\nBiography[]\n\nBritney Spears was one of three children born to Lynne and James Spears. A child actor from a young age, she appeared in commercials and on Star Search. When she was 11 she became a member of the Mickey Mouse Club. Spears went on to become an international pop star, with hits such as: \"Oops I Did It Again\", \"Baby One More Time”, “3\", “Circus\", \"Hold it Against Me”, and many others. She also has a a star on The Hollywood Walk of Fame and has an MTV Vanguard award which only has been given to a few music legends such as Madonna and Michael Jackson. Britney Spears is the older sister of Jamie Lynn Spears and the little sister of Brian Spears.\n\nPersonal Life[]\n\nSpears dated fellow Mouseketeer Justin Timberlake for 2 years, until they broke up in 2002. She has been married two times, first to her friend Jason Alexander in Vegas, which led to a divorce 55 hours later. In July 2004, she was engaged to Kevin Federline, with whom she had two children: Sean Preston (born September 14, 2005) and Jayden James (born September 12, 2006). She filed for divorce from Kevin in November 2006. The two got into a custody battle, which eventually led to Spears temporarily losing custody of her sons the following year, but she eventually regained visitation rights, and she now has joint custody. She was also in a relationship with her ex-manager, Jason Trawick until they broke off their engagement.\n\nShe infamously had a public breakdown in 2007 (which included shaving her head in public and being checked into rehab), but the following year she made a huge comeback in her career and personal life.\n\nShe currently performs at her Las Vegas Residency \"Britney: Piece of Me\", which has been highly successful and will go on until December 2017.\n\nAlbums[]\n\nBaby One More Time (1999)\n\nOops...I Did It Again (2000)\n\nBritney (2001)\n\nIn the Zone (2003)\n\nGreatest Hits: My Prerogative (2004)\n\nBlackout (2007)\n\nCircus (2008)\n\nBritney: The Singles Collection (2009)\n\nFemme Fatale (2011)\n\nBritney Jean (2013)\n\nGlory (2016)\n\nAppearances[]\n\nEpisode – \"The Mansion Family\"\n\n[]\n\nBritney Spears at Wikipedia"
