        "text": "We can’t help but wonder what is going on in the head of Britney Spears’ ambitious boyfriend Sam Asghari while all this family drama is escalating. Britney seems infuriated with her entire family and continues to trade snipes with her sister online. She says she plans to sue the pants off her father for mishandling her conservatorship and also threatened to sue her sister if she talks about Britney while being interviewed about the book she wrote (that Britney hates.) Britney has distanced herself from her entire family- Sam is the only one left. Is he ENCOURAGING Britney to call out family members? (to have her all to himself, perhaps) Or is he terrified by her extreme and angry behavior? Does HE want to be in charge of her unpredictable life? Time will tell…\n\nPhoto: Instagram\n\nPhoto Credit: Pacific Coast News\n\nDo you recognize this young mother? It’s Britney Spears’ little sister Jamie Lynn. Back in 2007 she was adorable and starring on Nickelodeon’s “Zoey 101″ – her future seemed boundless. But the not-so-smart sixteen year old got pregnant that year and ended up moving back to Mississippi with her teenage boyfriend. They split up and now she is not only a single mom, but seems older than her 20 years….\n\nTeenagers Jamie Lynn Spears and her baby-daddy Casey Aldridge will be parents in a matter of months, and they have no choice but to prepare. Jamie doesn’t drive, and Casey’s been driving a flatbed pickup truck that won’t work once the baby arrives. There’s no place to put a car-seat. So the young couple has been vehicle shopping in Kentwood, Louisiana. They decided to purchase a fully loaded Chrysler Town & Country mini-van for Casey. It’s not exactly his dream car, but it’s just what the doctor ordered.\n\nJamie Lynn Spears has been in love with her hometown boyfriend Casey Aldridge for three years but he was never faithful to her. Apparently ladies man Casey is considered quite a catch in Kentwood, La. despite the fact that he’s a construction worker. He’s tall, good looking, and personable and was popular in high school. Although he enjoyed the fame that dating Jamie Lynn brought him – he was a serial cheater and Jamie knew it. According to the National Enquirer he confessed to Jamie last Spring that he got another girlfriend pregnant but she had a miscarriage. And he’s STILL seeing a college freshman. Could the pregnancy be a desperate attempt to hold on to Casey? He IS willing to marry her, but everyone is telling Jamie NOT to marry him.\n\nPhoto: WENN\n\nYikes! This is what Britney looked like the day the news about her sister Jamie Lynn’s pregnancy hit the news. We wonder if it was news to her too – she seemed to have a hard time conjuring up a “response” to the revelation. On the other hand, if Jamie’s three or four months along like we suspect, and expecting a Spring baby, you’d think Britney would have heard about it.\n\nWe’re still reeling from the news that Britney Spears’ 16 year old sister Jamie Lynn has admitted she’s pregnant. It’s like the movie Juno has come to life without the intelligent characters and clever dialog. At least Juno was smart enough to do the right thing and continue her education. We seriously doubt that Jamie will do anything right. Before this happened, Jamie had a bright future – she was cute and fresh-faced and had her own series on Nickelodean, Zoey 101. Certainly her show is history, and most likely the pregnancy pounds and pimples will diminish her youthful beauty.\n\nJamie-Lynn Spears , pretender to the pop princess throne formerly occupied by her sister Britney, is only fifteen but she’s got a steady boyfriend. He’s a small town guy from her hometown of Kentwood, Louisiana, and they supposedly met in church. Jamie, currently starring on Nickelodean’s Zoey 101, is careful not to flaunt him at red carpet events, but privately they are a hot couple. Jamie and her cute mystery man had box seats at the Mariah Carey concert at the Kodak theater. An audience member told me “They were both dressed in white and looked really happy. He had his arm around her and she had her head on her shoulder.” It’s definitely a romance -can anybody out there tell me this incredibly lucky boyfriend’s name?"
