        "text": "Britney Spears has poured cold water on rumours of another album, insisting: “I will never return to the music industry.”\n\nThe singer has not released an album since 2016’s Glory. But after her 13-year conservatorship ended in 2021, she did return to the music scene with 2022’s Hold Me Closer, a duet with Sir Elton John. And fans have been hoping that she might be heading back into the recording studio for a full album.\n\nHowever, Spears has now made it clear that the speculation is unfounded.\n\nWhat did Spears say about the music industry?\n\nPosting on Instagram, she told her fans: “Just so we’re clear most of the news is trash!!!\n\n“They keep saying I’m turning to random people to do a new album… I will never return to the music industry!!! When I write, I write for fun or I write for other people!!!\n\n“For those of you who have read my book, there’s loads that you don’t know about me… I’ve written over 20 songs for other people the past two years!!! I’m a ghostwriter and I honestly enjoy it that way!!!”\n\nWe have a look at what else the star has been up to, and what might be next.\n\nSongwriting\n\nSpears said in her post that she likes to write, and she has penned various tracks for other people. One of the best known is probably Whiplash, for US superstar Selena Gomez. Spears was a co-writer on the song, which was on Gomez’s 2011 album When The Sun Goes Down.\n\nShe was also a writer on Follow Me, from her sister Jamie Lynn Spears’s hit TV show Zoey 101. Jamie Lynn released a re-imagined version of the track in 2020, and told Entertainment Tonight at the time: \"The Zoey theme song was something me and my sister were a part of creating, and you know, I was like 12, I was nervous to go in the studio.\n\n\"Of course, [my] big sis is like, 'Get in here and do it!' She cheered me on and she was a big part of that song in the original version.\"\n\nBest-selling book\n\nLast year, Spears released her memoir The Woman In Me, in which she opened about her relationship with Justin Timberlake, having an abortion and her conservatorship. She also talked about her rise to fame and her sometimes troubled relationship with her family.\n\nThe book was unveiled in October after weeks of rumours about its contents, and it quickly became the fastest-selling celebrity memoir ever. “It’s happening!!!” the Toxic star wrote on Instagram. “My book is the highest selling celebrity memoir in history and it’s only day 1!!!\"\n\n“Thank you to the fans who have been so supportive!!!\" she added. \"Love you all!!!”\n\nMovie or series based on book?\n\nAfter Spears’ book shifted a million copies in its first week, rumours of a movie adaptation started swirling. In late October, Deadline reported that the buyers were “circling” The Woman In Me, with bids “coming in already”.\n\nIt’s thought that the book could be turned into either a TV series, documentary or movie.\n\nWill she continue to work in showbiz?\n\nWhen Spears’ conservatorship ended she made it clear that she was just happy to get back to a more regular life. In social media posts after the guardianship was lifted, she revealed it was little things like driving and enjoying a glass of wine that she was embracing.\n\n“I’m just grateful for each day and being able to have the keys to my car and being able to be independent and feel like a woman,” she said on Instagram. “Owning an ATM card, seeing cash for the first time, being able to buy candles. It’s the little things for us women but it makes a huge difference and I’m grateful for that.”\n\nRead more: Britney Spears\n\nThe five biggest revelations in Britney Spears' book The Woman in Me\n\nAfter Britney: Justin Timberlake’s 11-year marriage, new movie and what he’s up to now?"
