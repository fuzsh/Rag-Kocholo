        "text": "The Nicest Surprise of New Release Tuesday is Jamie Lynn Spears - The Journey EP, This is a Must-Listen - It's Totally Not What You Think\n\nYes, it's Britney's younger sister. No, she is not a teenager anymore, she's twenty-three. Yes, she has spent way too much time in the tabloids and gossip columns. No, she has not been in the public eye for the last five years while she raised her daughter, Maddie.\n\nYes, she has a new career as a singer-songwriter. No, it sounds nothing like Britney, Miley, or Katy. Jamie Lynn Spears is a country singer and songwriter and quite good indeed. Listen to \"How Could I Want More\".\n\nJamie Lynn Spears -The Journey\n\n\"How Could I Want More\" is the first single, released late last year. Jamie Lynn wrote it with Nashville songwriter Rivers Rutherford. Jamie Lynn, in her official bio says that \"experiences with Rivers and other Nashville writers, including Chris Tompkins, Liz Rose, Lisa Carver and Luke Laird, made for a master class in songwriting. Jamie Lynn learned about how to bring her stories to life through music and became a part of a community that helped her figure out the kind of artist she wanted to be\" (see the full bio below).\n\n\"How Could I Want More\" is included in the five song EP, The Journey, due Tuesday. The EP starts off with \"Shotgun Wedding\", a rockin' little tune that would not sound out of place on a Dixie Chicks record. Considering Jamie Lynn's well publicized history which plays like a quintessential country song, this may be a case of art imitating life imitating art. In any case, Jamie Lynn is clearly having a great deal of fun, mining her own past for a great country song.\n\nThe other three songs are winners, too. Credit producer Corey Crowder for the simple arrangements and quality sound. The Journey is a solid first effort.\n\nJamie Lynn Spears' Official Bio:\n\nAt 23 years-old Jamie Lynn Spears is already a seasoned entertainment veteran. After five years focused on raising her daughter, Maddie, the Kentwood, LA native is back in the spotlight with a sound and style that truly captures her Southern roots.\n\nHer official music debut comes in the form of country ballad “How Could I Want More.” The intensely personal lyrics mixed with a simple song production portrays Jamie Lynn as wise beyond her 23 years.\n\n“How Could I Want More” was written by Spears along with Nashville songwriter Rivers Rutherford, who has also collaborated with Tim McGraw, Brad Paisley, and Montgomery Gentry.\n\nJamie Lynn’s experiences with Rivers and other Nashville writers, including Chris Tompkins, Liz Rose, Lisa Carver and Luke Laird, made for a master class in songwriting. Jamie Lynn learned about how to bring her stories to life through music and became a part of a community that helped her figure out the kind of artist she wanted to be. The experiences paid off - Jamie Lynn now has over 100 songs in her catalog.\n\nHer first single already has critical acclaim and cultural heat. It was named a Taste of Country Critic’s Pick and her journey has been covered by such outlets as E!, Entertainment Tonight, BuzzFeed, MTV, CMT and more!\n\nA full album is imminent and Jamie Lynn credits her producer, Corey Crowder, for helping her define her sound. “He is a huge influence, and mainly responsible for making my music sound like “me”- he really just got me,” says Spears. “It took me years to figure out my sound, and to have confidence in knowing what I wanted.”\n\nChoosing “How Could I Want More” as her first single was not an easy decision, but she feels that it is the right one because of the help and support of her team.\n\n“Keeping it honest is something that will always fall on me. I need to make choices I believe in, so I don't lose that relationship with my fans - they are the ones I want to stay connected to through my music.” says Spears\n\nJamie Lynn began her entertainment career with a small part in Crossroads, portraying the fictionalized younger version of real-life sister Britney Spears’ character. Jamie Lynn then found a home in television; appearing on Nickelodeon’s All That and most notably starring as the title character of Zoey 101, for which she won the Nickelodeon Kid’s Choice Award for “Best Actress” in 2006.\n\nPhotos courtesy of Jamie Lynn Spears\n\nJamie Lynn Spears' Website\n\nJamie Lynn Spears' Facebook\n\nJamie Lynn Spears' Twitter\n\nRemembering the Main Point, 1964 - 1981\n\nWXPN Most Memorable Musical Moment #5 Begining in 1964, The Main Point in Bryn Mawr provided the Philadelphia area with one of its most enjoyable venues for live music. Although it started as a folk based coffeehouse, all styles of music were presented over the years. Financial problems continually plagued the Main Point, and in spite of frequent benefit shows by artists who loved the place as much as the audience, the club finally closed in 1981. The following brief history is contained in an obituary of Jeanette O. Campbell, one of the founders and owners of the Main Point who died on October 22, 2006, written by Philadelphia Inquirer Staff Writer Sally A. Downey as reprinted on the Save Ardmore Coalition website. Jeanette Orndoff Campbell, 89, former owner of the Main Point, a music hall in Bryn Mawr where young talents including Bruce Springsteen, Jackson Browne, Bonnie Raitt and James Taylor were introduced to local audiences, died of complications from hip surgery Oct. 22 at Stap\n\nCream and Blind Faith at the Spectrum, Philadelphia, 1968 & 1969\n\nWXPN Most Memorable Musical Moment #3 (L-R) Jack Bruce, Ginger Baker, & Eric Clapton I could not have foreseen it at the time, but looking back on a concert going history now entering it's fifth decade, my first three concerts were absolutely formative in the development of the music obsession that has driven life as we know it from that point forward. Attending a rock concert pre drivers license was no small feat, that I even got to these shows is the first indication that I knew I was onto something even if I couldn't quite explain it. I've already detailed my first concert (The Beatles at JFK Stadium) in my MMMM#1 . My second and third concerts took place at the Spectrum in Philadelphia, they were less than a year apart, and due to the fact that concerts never end at the time predicted, these concert experiences both ended with a very angry driver stuck waiting in the car outside the venue until the last encore had finished. I shot both concerts with the same starter\n\nAnd We Danced - Filming the Hooters Video, 7/27/85\n\nWXPN Most Memorable Musical Moment #4 \"And We Danced\" (picture sleeve above) was released in 1985 as the second single from the album, Nervous Night , the Hooters' major label debut for Columbia Records. Here's the video. The call went out to the Hooters' mailing list the last week of July 1985 that an audience with cars would be needed on the coming Saturday for a video shoot. Participants would report to the Exton Drive-In by late morning and be prepared to stay all day until after dark. This stage set, early in the day, was a warm-up for the crowd and probably a dry run for the production team for the night-time performance to be filmed later. The banner backdrop does not appear in the video. Some of the antique and custom cars that were on hand for the shoot. The production crew prepares the ticket booth for its shot. This is the film crew shooting the acoustic intro part of the song. The acoustic intro was shot twice, first with t"
