        "text": "October 2021 – Jamie Lynn Spears announces her memoir\n\nJamie Lynn announced that she would be releasing a book, Things I Should Have Said, which is met with criticism from Britney.\n\nIt was claimed that the book was initially called I Must Confess, which was a reference to Britney’s hit Baby One More Time, however Jamie Lynn later refuted this claim, alleging that the book had no official title at this stage.\n\nNovember 12, 2021 – Britney Spears is freed from her conservatorship\n\nAfter Britney’s father, Jamie Spears, was removed as conservator in September, the entire conservatorship rule was removed in November, meaning Britney was a free woman with control over her personal and financial decisions for the first time in over 13 years.\n\nJanuary 3, 2022 – Britney appears to unfollow Jamie Lynn on social media\n\nBritney appeared to unfollow her sister at the start of the year, with the Toxic star currently following less than 50 people on the platform.\n\nJanuary 12, 2022 – Jamie Lynn appears on Good Morning America\n\nJamie Lynn appeared on Good Morning America to discuss her book as well as the apparent rift with Britney.\n\nSpeaking about their relationship, Jamie Lynn revealed: ‘The love is still there, 100 percent. I love my sister. I’ve only ever loved and supported her and done what’s right by her.\n\n‘And she knows that, so I don’t know why we’re in this position right now.’\n\nJamie Lynn also claimed that she did try to help Britney get the resources she needed during her conservatorship and was happy when it was removed last year.\n\nShe explained: ‘I’ve always been my sister’s biggest supporter, so when she needed help I set up ways to do so.\n\n‘I went out of my way to make sure that she had the contacts she needed to possibly go ahead and end this conservatorship and just end this all for our family. If it’s going to cause this much discord, why continue it?\n\n‘It wasn’t about agreeing [or disagreeing] with the conservatorship. Everyone has a voice and it should be heard, so if she wanted to talk to other people, then I did, I set that up.’\n\nJanuary 14, 2022 – Britney hits back at claims Jamie Lynn makes in memoir about a knife\n\nBritney called her sister out by name on social media after Jamie Lynn claimed in her book that Britney once pulled out a knife and locked the two in a room.\n\nDenying the account, Britney wrote: ‘Jamie Lynn… congrats babe! You’ve stooped to a whole new level of LOW … I’ve never been around you ever with a knife or would I ever even think to do such!!!\n\n‘The only knife I ever saw you with at home was cutting the biggest pieces of squash I ever saw in my life and it was way too big for me to cut.\n\n‘So please please stop with these crazy lies for the Hollywood books!!! NOW and only NOW I do know only a scum person would make up such things about someone….\n\n‘I’m actually very confused about you making that up because it’s honestly not like you at all!!!! Around the kids???? Jamie Lynn, seriously??? Come on !!! Congrats on introducing your older sister the concept of getting LOW … LOWER … LOWEST … because you win on that one, babe!!!!’\n\nJanuary 16, 2022 – Britney issues open letter to Jamie Lynn, saying she still loves her\n\nBritney appeared to have softened just days later, writing: ‘Jamie Lynn… I don’t think your book is about me at all… I said some harsh things because you obviously hurt me by the things you are making up about me!!’\n\nShe later continued: ‘All I know is I love you unconditionally!!! So go ahead and say whatever you want… it’s so tacky for a family to fight publicly like this!!! You say you love me… yet your loyalty is still with the people that hurt me the most!!!\n\n‘I think the thing that saddens me the most is that when this all happened to me and when I called you from that place… you would take days to respond!!! I never got to talk to you!!! You would just text me days later and I was so scared.\n\n‘I needed you… my family, my blood and your support more than anything!!! You guys did absolutely nothing UNTIL a year ago!!!’\n\nShe added: ‘I don’t care anymore!!! Say whatever you want to say just know I do know your real heart more than anyone!!! It’s your life and you deserve a beautiful life!!!!\n\n‘I wish I would be able to do what you’re doing and do interviews!!! I’m scared of all of it… I admire you for being strong… just know I love you and I think you know that already more than anything!’\n\nJanuary 17, 2022 – Jamie Lynn makes a podcast appearance and appears to show text from Britney to clear her name\n\nJamie Lynn appeared in a teaser for her interview on the Call Her Daddy podcast, in which she is seen pulling up a text message from Britney in an attempt to clear her name.\n\nShe is seen asking for her phone before casting her eyes across the screen, responging: ’She says to me,’ but the contents of the alleged message have yet to be revealed as the screen goes black. The rest of the podcast is yet to be shared.\n\nJanuary 18, 2022 – Britney says she should have ‘slapped’ Jamie Lunn and their mother\n\nSpeaking in response to comments Jamie Lynn made about Britney’s split from Justin Timberlake in her recent interviews, Britney had some harsh words back.\n\nShe wrote on Instagram: ‘I flew home to Jamie Lynn on the couch watching her tv shows right after Justin and I broke up… I was a ghost there!!!!!\n\n‘I had worked my whole life and I didn’t know how to be served by Mamma … Sit there and get served the chocolate milkshakes with the perfectly crushed ice with the secret chunky sugar meanwhile Jamie Lynn is 12, she indulges with the TV for hours then goes to lay out on a raft at the pool … I’m in shock because this was never my life!!!!\n\n‘Justin’s family was all I knew for many years … Things were different now and Jamie Lynn had a new Nickelodeon show… All I remember saying was “DAMN !!! How the hell does a 12 year old land a Nickelodeon show????” ….. HMMMMMMMM …. Well I never got my iced chocolate drink!!!\n\n‘I mean yeah … I’m grown up right??? But then maybe I might need a little support … It was a People Magazine cover … The people show up and as Jamie Lynn says, I was scared!!!! F**k yeah!!!\n\n‘My Mamma was on pain medication and could barely hold a conversation in the house because her and my dad split and she was more messed up than anything!!!! I remember her sitting on the floor in a conversation and she never got up…\n\n‘And I’m sorry Jamie Lynn, I wasn’t strong enough to do what should have been done … slapped you and Mamma right across your f**king faces!!!!!’"
