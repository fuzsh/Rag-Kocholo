        "text": "BRITNEY Spears isn't the only star in her family — her sister Jamie Lynn is an actress, author and singer.\n\nBut does Britney get along with her younger sibling, who's about to embark on an adventure in the I'm A Celebrity jungle?\n\nDo Britney and Jamie Lynn Spears get along?\n\nBritney and Jamie Lynn have an up-and-down relationship to say the least.\n\nA source told E! News in June 2021 they are \"very close\" and claimed Jamie Lynn is \"very protective of Britney and has always been fiercely loyal.\"\n\nThe insider also said they've \"always been close and able to laugh together\" and said Britney \"trusts Jamie Lynn and can talk to her about anything.\"\n\nHowever, while speaking to the court in 2021 Britney claimed her \"whole family did nothing\" to help her during her conservatorship.\n\nIn an Instagram post, Britney called out her sister for singing remixes to her songs at the 2017 Radio Disney Music Awards.\n\nThe post read: “I don’t like that my sister showed up at an awards show and performed MY SONGS to remixes !!!!!”\n\nBritney has also hit out at her younger sibling for writing a tell-all book about her life with the singer — while she was in court fighting for her freedom.\n\nThe controversy occurred in October 2021 when Jamie Lynn announced that she was writing a memoir, released on January 18, 2022, that was previously titled I Must Confess.\n\nThe title was changed to Things I Should Have Said after receiving criticism for using the lyrics from Britney's 1998 single, Baby One More Time.\n\nPrior to releasing the book it seemed like Britney and Jamie were back on track as Britney posted: \"It was nice to visit my sister on set last week !!! I’ve missed you guys so much !!!\"\n\nBut the pop superstar opened up about their troubled relationship in her own recent memoir — released in October 2023 — The Woman In Me.\n\nIt seems their difficult relationship started at a young age, as Britney wrote: “It was clear that girl ruled the roost.\n\n\"Meanwhile, it was like I was a ghost child. I can remember walking into the room and feeling like no one even saw me. Jamie Lynn only saw the TV.”\n\nShe later added that she was certain her family was trying \"to kill her\".\n\nAnd in October 2023 Britney branded Jamie Lynn a \"total b****\" after not helping her during her conservatorship.\n\nWhat has Jamie Lynn said about her sister's conservatorship?\n\nJamie Lynn was very quiet about her sister's conservatorship battle and on June 23, 2021, as the court case continued, she disabled all comments from her social media.\n\nSome of Britney's fans hit out at Jamie Lynn for not speaking up for her sister, but the younger sibling remained on the sidelines and didn't get involved.\n\nThe BBC News reported in August 2020 Jamie Lynn \"asked for control of money stored in a trust fund set up for Britney's children\" after becoming a trustee of Britney's estate in 2018.\n\nBut Jamie Lynn hit back on Instagram after showing her support for her big sister in May 2019.\n\nWhen one social media user suggested she was worried about \"losing [her] allowance,\" Jamie Lynn responded, \"I have NEVER been paid a dime from my sister, that is HER hard-earned money, and I am NOT entitled to a cent of it.\"\n\nTo the delight of many fans, in September 2021 Britney's father Jamie was removed as her conservator.\n\nWhat is the age difference between Britney and Jamie Lynn?\n\nThe sisters are just under ten years apart.\n\nJamie Lynn, 32, was born on April 4, 1991, while Britney, 41, was born on December 2, 1981.\n\nLike big sister Britney, Jamie Lynn was also a child star and starred in the Nickelodeon show Zoe 101."
