        "text": "#10: Casey Wilson vs. Tim Allen\n\nSanta Claus is often heralded as the epitome of jolliness. However, the same cannot be said for the actor assuming his iconic role in Disney’s “The Santa Clauses,” according to guest star Casey Wilson. The “SNL” alum didn’t mince words on her “B**** Sesh” podcast, painting a vivid picture of a tense environment on set. Wilson recounted how everyone seemed to tip-toe around their star, describing it as “the truly single worst experience” she’s ever had with a colleague. She divulged how the actor acted all high and mighty, ignoring others, and how he’d simply announce he was leaving, drop his cape on the floor, and exit. Sounds like someone’s earned their spot on Santa’s naughty list!\n\n#9: Alexa Nikolas vs. Jamie Lynn Spears\n\nNikolas played Nicole Bristow in the first two seasons of “Zoey 101” alongside Jamie Lynn Spears. Years later, Spears claimed in her memoir that Nikolas had spread hurtful rumors about her back then. However, this prompted Nikolas to fire back, describing a set plagued by a “mean girl” vibe led by Spears herself. Some viewers even think they can spot evidence of tension in some episodes. Despite this conflict, adults on the show seemed to side with Spears rather than addressing the issue directly. She mentioned that Spears has since apologized, which she accepted. She also received apologies from Britney Spears, both privately and publicly, for defending her sister without having the full story.\n\n#8: Rebel Wilson vs. Sacha Baron Cohen\n\nIn her autobiography “Rebel Rising,” the actress shared a troubling experience she had with a male co-star. When his team allegedly tried to silence her, she decided to speak out. She described the incident as taking place on the set of “The Brothers Grimsby,” where she worked with Sacha Baron Cohen. According to her, Baron Cohen made her feel uncomfortable and fearful, pushing her to do things that crossed her personal boundaries. She also mentioned that at the time, she tried to cope by laughing it off. Baron Cohen's representatives strongly denied her account, calling it “demonstrably false.” However, as of writing, this story will likely continue to develop.\n\n#7: Nicollette Sheridan vs. Teri Hatcher\n\nSusan and Edie's relationship on “Desperate Housewives” was often fraught with tension. Turns out things weren’t much better when the cameras stopped rolling, either. During the show's eight seasons, there were rumors of drama behind the scenes, especially involving Teri Hatcher and her co-stars. While nothing was ever officially confirmed, the grapevine was ripe with hints that Hatcher might have been at the center of some on-set clashes. It was even said that she was left out of the cast's gifts for the crew during the series finale. One person, however, who didn’t hold back was Nicollette Sheridan. Reportedly, she told show creator Marc Cherry that Hatcher “was the meanest woman in the world.”\n\n#6: Rose McGowan vs. Alyssa Milano\n\nThe behind-the-scenes troubles with this series have hinted that the set wasn’t exactly a “Charmed” place to be. The tension came to a head in 2020 during a highly publicized clash between Milano and McGowan over politics. McGowan didn’t hold back, calling out her former co-star for fostering a “Toxic AF” atmosphere on set. And it wasn’t just McGowan who seemingly felt the strain. She had joined the cast in season four after Shannen Doherty’s departure, allegedly due to issues with Milano. Anyway, McGowan criticized Milano’s behavior, accusing her of essentially throwing tantrums and making work downright unbearable. While Milano has acknowledged the unhealthy work environment, she’s mostly opted not to point fingers.\n\n#5: Lucy Liu vs. Bill Murray\n\nApparently, while filming “Charlie’s Angels,” changes were made to a scene that Bill Murray, who played Bosley, was unaware of until rehearsals. Unfortunately, Murray didn’t take to this too well and, for some reason, aimed his frustration at Liu. She described his language as “inexcusable and unacceptable” but refused to let his disrespect slide. This was still early in her career whereas Murray was already a well-established actor and comedian. Still, that didn’t stop her from standing her ground. According to Drew Barrymore, others on set backed Liu and made it clear that such behavior would not be tolerated. Murray was notably absent from the sequels, though it’s unclear if there’s any connection.\n\n#4: The cast of “Suicide Squad” vs. Jared Leto\n\nLeto’s castmates quickly learned that if they received any gifts from the actor, they should probably just return to sender unopened. Leto, fully immersing himself in his role as The Joker, took method acting to new heights by sending some rather unsettling presents. Despite his insistence that it was all part of the act, not everyone seemingly found it so amusing. Viola Davis said that although she was spared any live rodents, adult toys, or any other undesirable gifts, she still felt uneasy and itching for the pepper spray or her husband (an ex-football player). Will Smith also seemed somewhat uncomfortable with Leto’s commitment to the role.\n\n#3: Samantha Marie Ware vs. Lea Michele\n\nIn “Glee,” Michele plays a self-serving diva who happily tramples over almost anyone to get what she wants. If the accounts of some of her fellow “Glee” cast are anything to judge by, that may have involved less acting than we thought. While not the first to call Michele out, Ware’s tweet in response to Michele’s Black Lives Matter post gained widespread attention. She accused the actress of making her time on the show a “living hell” and making her “question a career in Hollywood.” Other cast members soon shared their experiences or silently supported others by liking posts. Dabier Snell, who had a role in one episode, also criticized Michele for her mean girl behavior.\n\n#2: Multiple People vs. Chevy Chase\n\nThis OG “SNL” cast member has quite the reputation for being abrasive, rude, and downright offensive. It didn’t take long for him to clash with his “SNL” co-stars. Will Ferrell even dubbed him “the worst host,” highlighting his backstage misconduct, particularly towards a female writer. Pete Davidson also had some choice words for him that we can’t repeat here. Despite his infamy, he was cast as Pierce Hawthorne in “Community” but eventually got axed after some racist remarks aimed at Donald Glover. Glover has hinted that Chase’s behavior was consistently unpleasant. When asked about his reputation, Chase showed zero regret.\n\nBefore we unveil our top pick, here are a few dishonorable mentions.\n\nSophia Loren vs. Marlon Brando\n\nThe Actress Said She “Pulverized Him with [Her] Eyes” After Her “Put His Hands on [Her],” He Never Dared Again\n\nKim Cattrall vs. Sarah Jessica Parker\n\nCattrall Says the Pair Were “Never Friends” & Has Called Out Her “Sex and the City” Co-star Several Times. Parker Has Denied Any Feud\n\nJanet Hubert vs. Will Smith\n\nSmith Has Admitted That He “Made the Set Very Difficult” at Times for His OG “Fresh Prince” Aunt Viv\n\nTyrese Gibson vs. James Franco\n\nFranco Reportedly Took His Method Acting Too Far, Causing His “Annapolis” Co-star to Resent Him\n\nDebbie Reynolds vs. Gene Kelly\n\nThe Actress Called Kelly a “Cruel Taskmaster” & Pinpointed a Moment Where He Overstepped During a Kissing Scene.\n\n#1: Meryl Streep vs. Dustin Hoffman\n\nStreep and Hoffman starred in “Kramer vs. Kramer,” a movie about the emotional struggles of divorce. Prompted by Streep, writer-director Robert Benton made some late adjustments to her character, much to Hoffman’s irritation. He was going through his own divorce at the time, so playing such an intense role might not have been the best idea for him. In 2018, Streep talked to the New York Times about how Hoffman tried to stir up her emotions by talking about her late boyfriend, John Cazale. She also mentioned a time when he went way too far, which you can actually see in the movie. Streep voiced relief that such behavior is increasingly unacceptable in the industry.\n\nHave you heard any whispers about other celebs who deserve a place on this list? Let us know in the comments."
