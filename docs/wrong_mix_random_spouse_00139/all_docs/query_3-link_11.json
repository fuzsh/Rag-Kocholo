        "text": "Britney Spears has shared a sweet tribute to the women who have inspired her over the years, and Sarah Jessica Parker was moved to be one of them.\n\nThe singer, 39, took to Twitter and Instagram to share the list, writing: ‘These are the women that have truly inspired my life!!!!\n\n‘Being away from family & my boyfriend while quarantining was really hard for me but the good thing about social media is we can connect in a different way!!! These cool ladies always add a spark to my day!!!!’\n\nAmong them were Sharon Stone, Natalie Portman, Sarah, her sister Jamie Lynn Spears, Miley and Noah Cyrus and yoga teacher Tawny Janae.\n\nSJP was humbled to be included, replying to Britney: ‘Thank you dear @britneyspears.\n\n‘I think you know how I feel about you. For a long time. Sending all my best and touched that you included me to be companion. X, SJ’.\n\nIt comes after Britney left fans confused by posting about the colour ‘red’ on her Instagram account without any further explanation.\n\nFans had wondered whether they cryptic message held any clues about Britney’s conservatorship, which the Free Britney movement is fighting to get her freed from.\n\nThe Toxic star has been under conservatorship since 2008 and this week her lawyers have filed to have her father, Jamie Spears, removed from his role overseeing her financial and personal affairs.\n\nJamie had been in control of both her financial and personal decisions since 2008, stepping down from the latter in 2019 due to health reasons.\n\nCare professional Jodi Montgomery had replaced him on a temporary basis, but her lawyer has filed a petition to make the role permanent as well as asking Jamie to resign from overseeing Britney’s personal life.\n\nThe papers, obtained by PA, also reserve the right for Britney to eventually request an end to the conservatorship, adding: ‘Petitioner expressly reserves the right to petition for termination of this conservatorship under Probate Code section 1861.\n\n‘Nothing in the within petition shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of that right.’\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Britney Spears’ lawyer files suit to stop father controlling finances and personal life"
