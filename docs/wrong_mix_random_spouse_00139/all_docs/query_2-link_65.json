        "text": "I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here! premiered over the weekend. If you’re not familiar, it’s the British reality show where celebrity contestants become the “King” or “Queen” of the jungle. Among the contestants is Britney Spears’ younger sister, Jamie Lynn Spears. Jamie Lynn already quit Special Forces: World’s Toughest Test after just two days back in January. While on the show, she broke down in tears as she admitted she struggles with self-esteem “all the time.” She said she feels like she doesn’t “really have anything” for herself. Then, in September, she appeared on Dancing With the Stars but ended up getting eliminated during the second week of competition.\n\nIn one of the show’s teaser videos released last week, Jamie Lynn, 32, introduced herself to viewers by stating that she’s “best known” for her acting and singing career. “I have been doing it since I could basically walk,” she added. In the comments section, fans expressed how bizarre Jamie Lynn’s claims were. “Love how she doesn’t say she’s best known for being ‘Britney Spears’ sister,’” wrote one person. Another person commented, “Isn’t she famous for being Britney Spears sister and spending all her money.” Meanwhile, a third person wrote: “I think you will find you’re best known for being Britneys sister hunni [laughing emoji].”\n\nJamie Lynn’s Career and Musical Background\n\nThe mother of two made her acting debut at the age of 10 when she played the younger version of Britney in the movie Crossroads, in which Britney starred as the main character. She then landed a starring role in Nickelodeon’s television series Zoey 101.\n\nDuring Sunday’s premiere, Jamie Lynn was asked about her musical background by her campmate Josie Gibson. According to Buzzfeed, she awkwardly made sure not to mention her pop princess sister’s name. “Who got you into music, then?” Josie asked. Jamie Lynn replied, “Um, I’ve always kinda been into music, you know what I mean?” Josie followed up and said, “You’re a very musical family, ain’t you?” Jamie Lynn just responded, “My mom played the piano a lot.” She then diverted the conversation altogether. The show’s hosts, Ant McPartlin and Dec Donnelly, mocked the fact that Jamie Lynn didn’t mention Britney at all.\n\nHowever, some people speculated online that Jamie Lynn is contractually obligated not to mention Britney. She was previously sent a cease and desist letter from Britney’s lawyer when she released a memoir last year and made several public appearances discussing their relationship.\n\nBritney Spears: Her 10 Greatest Songs, From The '90s To Now\n\nBritney Spears has produced some of the most iconic pop songs in history.
