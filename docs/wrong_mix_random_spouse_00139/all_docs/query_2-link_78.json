        "text": "Britney Spears doesn’t appear to be in perfect harmony with her younger sister.\n\nThe “Toxic” singer unfollowed her sibling, Jamie Lynn Spears, on Instagram, according to Elle magazine.\n\nIt’s unclear when the elder Spears stopped following the younger one.\n\nJamie Lynn, 30, shared her support for Britney, 40, in June amid the pop star’s efforts to end a court-ordered conservatorship.\n\nThe following month, Britney shared an Instagram post condemning those who didn’t do enough to support her during the saga, which some people speculated to include her sister.\n\nThe conservatorship was officially lifted in November.\n\nJamie Lynn, who starred on the Nickelodeon series “Zoey 101,” is set to release a memoir titled “Things I Should Have Said” this month. Last summer, the book’s publisher said “premature information” about the memoir was “erroneously released online to book retail sites.”\n\nThe statement came amid rumors that the book would be titled “I Must Confess,” which is a lyric in her sister’s song “...Baby One More Time,” according to Entertainment Tonight.\n\n“We deeply regret that incorrect and incomplete information about her book has appeared in the public space, particularly at this sensitive time for Jamie Lynn and her family,” Worthy Publishing said in a tweet in July.\n\nBritney, who follows 46 accounts on Instagram, has not publicly addressed the latest development regarding her sister. Jamie Lynn is still following Britney."
