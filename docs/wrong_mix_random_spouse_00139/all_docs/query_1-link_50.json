        "text": "Freed from her conservatorship, Spears landed a huge deal for a tell-all memoir.\n\nIn one of the biggest book deals of all time, Britney Spears reportedly landed a $15 million advance to write her memoir for Simon & Schuster, the first major sign of her earnings potential since her 13-year conservatorship was terminated in November 2021.\n\nThe New York Post first reported the deal, which was then picked up by news outlets across the country.\n\nThe $15 million Spears reportedly will receive is equal to 25% of her $60 million net worth, as estimated by Forbes in February 2021. (Representatives of Spears and Simon & Schuster have not responded to requests for comment.)\n\nSpears first hinted at a memoir on Instagram in January, when she posted a picture of a typewriter with the caption “Shall I start from THE BEGINNING???” The deal comes on the heels of criticism Spears hurled through social media, also in January, at her younger sister Jamie Lynn Spears’ memoir, Things I Should Have Said. \"Please stop with these crazy lies for the Hollywood books,” Spears pleaded in a lengthy Twitter post. Soon after, Britney’s attorney Mathew Rosengart served Jamie Lynn a cease-and-desist letter, warning her not to make any derogatory comments about Britney during her promotional campaign.\n\nIn the world of publishing, Spears’ $15 million advance would be one of the largest deals for a single title in history, per figures published by The Guardian. Among pop culture peers, it would be bigger than book deals for Bruce Springsteen, who got $10 million in 2016; Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards, who got $8 million in 2010; and comedian Amy Schumer, who got $9 million in 2015.\n\nSpears’ deal is also greater than U.K. prime minister Margaret Thatcher and Pope John Paul II, who received $11.3 million and $8.5 million, respectively, for their memoirs. Hillary Clinton received $8 million in 2014 for Hard Choices, her reflections on her time as Secretary of State, while her husband, President Bill Clinton, received $15 million in 2004 for My Life.\n\nIn 2017, Barack and Michelle Obama landed a massive advance for a multi-book deal worth a reported $65 million, the only known deal larger than Spears’ or President Clinton’s. The big gamble by Random House appears to have paid off. The first volume of the President Obama’s memoirs, A Promised Land, was the bestselling book of 2020, having sold more than 2.5 million copies that year. (It sold around another million since, which puts him in line with sales of memoirs by Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.) But he doesn’t have bragging rights in the Obama household—the former First Lady’s memoir, Becoming, has sold more than 8 million copies to date. Advances are generally calculated based on how many copies a publisher expects to sell, and larger deals, like the Obamas and Spears’, indicate how much interest a title is assumed to generate.\n\nRead ‘em And Reap\n\nThe biggest nonfiction book deals of all time.\n\nMichelle and Barack Obama ($65 million, multi-book deal)\n\nBritney Spears and Bill Clinton (tied, $15 million)\n\nHillary Clinton ($14 million)\n\nMargaret Thatcher ($11 million)\n\nBruce Springsteen ($10 million)\n\nsource: The Guardian, Vox\n\nIt’s a big change from the Spears’ financial situation over the past 13 years, during which time her father, Jamie Spears, controlled her finances through a conservatorship and pocketed 1.75% of her Las Vegas residency’s gross revenue. Spears spent millions paying for legal fees for both herself and her father as she fought the arrangement. Annual child support payments of $500,000 to ex-husband Kevin Federline chipped away her fortune too.\n\nWhether or not Spears’ memoir can produce sales like Michelle Obama’s, the new book deal represents her first major step to showing those who controlled her finances (and all other aspects of her life) that the pop star still has serious earning power. For years, Spears has generated little income. She has had no product endorsements since 2015 and no new records since 2016. She has not toured since 2018 and she called off her second Las Vegas residency in 2019. Although Forbes estimated that Spears earned over $30 million for eight of the last 20 years, about 25% of her gross income has gone to agents, managers and lawyers, and another 40% or more to local and federal taxes.\n\nThe memoir deal could be the beginning of a financial renaissance for all things Britney. “I imagine before the book comes out, Netflix and her publisher will be calling her to turn it into a TV show or movie or limited series for another large, if not the same amount,” says Vanessa Roman, an entertainment attorney specializing in finance at Akin Gump. “I don’t know who isn’t going to buy that book.”"
