        "text": "Jamie Lynn Spears sat down for an exclusive interview with ABC News correspondent Juju Chang to promote her memoir Things I Should Have Said, due out Jan. 18.\n\nThe interview aired both on Good Morning America and Nightline, and the conversation touched on her strained relationship with Britney Spears, her older sister, as well as their father's past alcoholism.\n\nRelated to Britney, Jamie Lynn insisted that she was \"happy\" when Britney's 13-year conservatorship was terminated in November and that she had previously gone \"out of my way to make sure she had the contacts she needed to possibly go ahead and end this conservatorship and just end this all for our family.\"\n\n\"I did take steps to help,\" the 30-year-old actress, author and singer said. \"But how many times can I take the steps withoutâ€”she has to walk through the door.\"\n\nBritney, 40, spoke out in response today (Jan. 13):\n\nAs Chang relayed, somewhere in Things I Should Have Said, Jamie Lynn describes Britney's behavior in the past has been \"erratic, paranoid, spiraling.\"\n\nIn response to that, the Grammy winner wrote: \"Anyways, the 2 things that did bother me that my sister said was how my behavior was out of control. She was never around me much 15 years ago at that time .... so why are they even talking about that unless she wants to sell a book at my expense??? REALLY???\"\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Chang asked Jamie Lynn about her 2017 Radio Disney Music Awards tribute performance where she covered Britney's songs as remixes. Last July, Britney called out her younger sister for doing so on Instagram.\n\n\"Honestly, it was somewhat confusing to me about that, and I actually have spoke to her about that,\" Jamie Lynn told Chang. \"I was doing a tribute to honor my sister and all of the amazing things that she's done. ... I've cleared up [with Britney] with the fact that I don't think she's personally upset with me about that. Truthfully, I don't know why that bothers her.\"\n\nWell, Britney clarified in her lengthy Twitter note exactly why it bothered her:\n\n\"I know it may sound like a silly thing to most people but I wrote a lot of my songs and my sister was the baby. She never had to work for anything. Everything was always given to her !!!! If you were me, you might understand asking for 13 years for remixes to go into a small venue show and on tours !!!! 13 years later they assign me as the MOTHER OF ALL ... heart of gold ... Britney sitting there seeing a 15 minute performance of everything I have ever wanted.... But see, I always was the bigger person.\n\n\"They all got to DO IT and PLAY ME and I always sat there and took it. But see, now it's a joke ... the last thing I would ever do is ask for what was just given to her !!! So yes, they did ruin my dreams. I do remember asking my sister why she did that when she knew I was waiting to change my show and her only words were 'Well it wasn't my idea'... Hope your book does well, Jamie Lynn !!!!\"\n\nBritney doubled down and wrote again, \"My family ruined my dreams 100 billion percent\" and \"my family loves to pull me down and hurt me always so I am disgusted with them.\"\n\nWith Chang, Jamie Lynn choked up when talking about her love for Britney. \"I have only ever loved and supported her and done what's right by her, and she knows that, so I don't know why we're in this position right now,\" she said.\n\nWatch the interview below."
