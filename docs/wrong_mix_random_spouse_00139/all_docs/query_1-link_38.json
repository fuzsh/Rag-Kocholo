        "text": "Celebrity books are a very common thing these days and have been for a long time, and Britney Spears is the latest global star to put pen to paper.\n\nSpears found herself in the dark for many years and her fans were left wondering what was actually going on in her life, and they should get to find out now that her book, 'The Woman in Me' has been released to the public.\n\nAs is always asked when a star releases a book, many wonder whether she really wrote this book herself or if there was help.\n\nAs it turns out, author and journalist Sam Lansky was brought in as a ghostwriter for Spears as she tries to tell her side of the story. He has profiled the likes of Adele and Maradonna whilst working for Time Magazine, so he is certainly experienced.\n\nThe publishing world went into a frenzy over this highly anticipated memoir, with several houses vying for the rights.\n\nIn the end, Gallery Books, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, emerged as the lucky winner.\n\nJennifer Bergstrom, the senior vice president and publisher at Gallery Books, expressed her excitement: \"We couldn't be more proud to help her share her story at last.\"\n\nBritney wrote her memoirs for $15 million"
