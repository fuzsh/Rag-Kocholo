        "text": "Country singer/songwriter Jana Kramer debuts at No. 92 on the Billboard Hot 100 (dated Oct. 31) with her single “I Got the Boy.” Especially notable about the song is one of its co-writers: Jamie Lynn Spears.\n\nWhile she’s Britney Spears‘ younger sister, Jamie Lynn is also an artist in her own right and makes her first entry in any capacity on the Hot 100.\n\nThe track, which Spears wrote with Connie Harrington and Tim Nichols (and which rises 20-18 on Hot Country Songs), is a rueful country ballad about a young lost love since matured, and with another. “I got the class ring, she got the diamond and wedding band/ I got the boy, she got the man,” Kramer laments in the chorus.\n\n‘Down’ Is Up: Luke Bryan Dominates Country Charts; Toby Keith and Jana Kramer Debut\n\nNot that Kramer is living the lyrics. Having noted that the song reminds her of her high school sweetheart, “He’s married and has two kids, and now I’m married and I have a baby on the way,” she says. “We’re in such better places.” The song is from Kramer’s sophomore set, thirty one, which enters Top Country Albums at No. 3 and the Billboard 200 at No. 10, both new highs. Her self-titled 2012 debut LP reached Nos. 5 and 19, respectively.\n\nJamie Lynn Spears Exclusive Q&A: ‘There Is No Rivalry’ With Britney\n\nWith Kramer’s hit, Spears, 24, scores her latest chart success. She broke through in 2013, as an artist, with “How Could I Want More,” which she also co-wrote. The track rose to No. 29 on Hot Country Songs and parent EP The Journey reached No. 24 on Top Country Albums. At the time, Spears spoke to Billboard about both her sister and her own career path. Calling Britney a “pop icon,” she said there is “no rivalry” between them. “You have to remember that we are 10 years apart, so I always saw her as a second mom. We have fun like only sisters can, but we don’t have that young sibling rivalry.\n\n“She was one of the first people to call and tell me how proud she was of the success of [‘More’], so charts won’t come between me and her. Never will!”\n\nThe younger, Nashville-based Spears, whose career first blossomed starring in Nickelodeon’s Zoey 101 (2005-08), also noted that while Britney has blazed trails in pop, country was a natural route for her own music career. “I think people forget that I grew up in Louisiana, and that my father is as Southern as they come,” she laughed. “Country music was a big part of me and my dad’s relationship, and still is.”"
