        "text": "Jamie Lynn Spears has touched down in Australia for I’m A Celebrity…Get Me Out of Here! , after being absolutely savaged by fans over claims that she is ‘best known for being an actress and singer’.\n\nThis week the line-up for the upcoming season of the reality series was announced, with famous faces including This Morning’s Josie Gibson, JLS’ Marvin Humes, former politician Nigel Farage and Made in Chelsea’s Sam Thompson set to enter the jungle in a few days time.\n\nJoining them is Jamie Lynn, who starred in the Nickelodeon teen series Zoey 101, and is also well-known for being the younger sister of pop star Britney Spears.\n\nHowever, in a promo video for I’m A Celebrity, Jamie Lynn’s omission of one of her claims to fame has left many people scratching their heads.\n\nThe 32-year-old mum-of two, as well as the other campmates, was filmed sharing the details of what they are ‘best known for’, but her answer seemed to rile some people up.\n\nIn the clip, the campmates all introduced themselves, with Jamie Lynn saying: ‘I’m best known for being an actress and a singer.\n\n‘I have been doing it since I could basically walk.’\n\nBut while she is well-known for these things, and also starred in the Netflix series Sweet Magnolias in more recent times, some have said they know her best simply for her famous sibling.\n\n‘Jamie Lynn might as well have said “I’m best known for being Britney Spears’ sister,’ one person commented on social media.\n\n‘Jamie Lynn is best known for her big sister, not her acting and singing,’ someone else wrote.\n\nAnother added: ‘Jamie Lynn Spears…best known for being and actress and singer Lols. Lots of lols. You do you girl.’\n\nOthers were even more scathing, referencing her recent appearances on other reality shows.\n\n‘Hang on, so Britney’s sister failed Dancing with the Stars and we snapped her up for this…excellent,’ one person shared.\n\nExplaining why she decided to go into the jungle, Jamie Lynn said there was ‘literally every misconception you can have on a person about me so I don’t take any of it seriously’.\n\n‘But I do think going on I’m A Celebrity will be a nice way for people to see the real me.\n\n‘This is an opportunity to be myself and do something really cool and have some awesome experiences in the meantime,’ she added.\n\nShe also admitted to being ‘scared of everything’ and was ‘dreading’ any trial she might be facing.\n\n‘I haven’t looked at any of them and thought, “Oh cool, I could do that one”.’\n\nWhile Jamie Lynn’s signing may not be as controversial as the former UKIP leader’s, Britney fans have been expressing their disgust given the pop star’s strained relationship with her younger sister.\n\nMeanwhile, the Toxic singer shared a very cryptic message minutes after the news broke of Jamie Lynn’s reality TV stint, sharing an Ernest Hemingway quote which read: ‘All things truly wicked start from innocence.’\n\nTalking about I’m A Celebrity, Jamie Lynn continued: ‘I think my best quality is the fact that it takes a lot to hurt my feelings.\n\n‘Unless you are my children or my immediate family, nothing is going to hurt me.’\n\nShe added: ‘When they approached me, the first thing I had to do was talk it over with my family and my kids to make sure they were OK about me being gone for this amount of time.\n\n‘Once I got the all-clear from everybody, I was like, “Yeah, let’s go.”‘\n\nIn recent years, Jamie Lynn has made headlines for her fallout with her older sister, who recently released her tell-all memoir that detailed her years-long conservatorship which was controlled by their father.\n\nBritney wrote about her strained relationship with Jamie Lynn in her memoir, The Woman In Me, sharing: ‘My sister and I should have found comfort in each other, but unfortunately that hasn’t been the case.\n\n‘As I was fighting the conservatorship and receiving a lot of press attention, she was writing a book capitalising on it.\n\n‘She rushed out salacious stories about me, many of them hurtful and outrageous. I was really let down.’\n\nBut Britney also said she ‘loved’ her sister and wished her ‘the absolute best’.\n\nI’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! 2023 starts on November 19 on ITV1 and ITVX.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Britney Spears appears to make sly dig as sister Jamie Lynn joins I’m A Celebrity\n\nMORE : I’m A Celebrity camp invaded by venomous snakes after startling number of sightings"
