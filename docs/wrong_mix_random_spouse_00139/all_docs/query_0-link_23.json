I mean, look at these sparks:\n\nIMHO, they were made for each other. But it's fine, Jamie Lynn. It's fine. I'm fine. I'M FINE.\n\nEven though I'll always ship my favorite couple from Pacific Coast Academy, I'm still really happy for the new addition to the Spears/Watson clan!\n\nShare This Article"
