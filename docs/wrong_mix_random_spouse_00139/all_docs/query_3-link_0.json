        "text": "\"I’ve never taken anything from her,\" said Jamie Lynn. \"I’ve been the one person in her life who’s always said, 'I just want to be your sister.'\"\n\nJamie Lynn and Britney Spears may have their ups and downs, but a trip into the Australian Outback changes everything.\n\nDuring the latest episode of I’m a Celebrity…Get Me Out of Here, the Zoey 101 alum told fellow competitor, Radio DJ Sam Thompson, that her big sister Britney was concerned about her decision to compete in the jungle-set reality show.\n\n\"I can imagine she'd be worried about me out here. I think she’s probably checking in on me heavily,\" Jamie Lynn said. \"I do think she’s probably like, ‘Why would she do that?’ She asked me that before I came here, she was like, ‘You’re really going to do it?’ I was like, ‘I’m going to go to Australia and check it out.’”\n\nLaughing, she added, \"Me crying, she’d probably be like, ‘Ya’ll get her out of there, right now!’”\n\nJamie Lynn went on to call Britney a “good big sister,” reflecting on the complicated nature of their relationship.\n\n\"I love her,” she said. “Me and her throw down. The world’s seen that. I’ve learned to stop talking about it publicly, but you know what, families fight. Listen, we just do it better than most.”\n\nWhen Thompson mentioned his own sibling relationships, adding that \"everyone’s got stuff they argue about all the time,\" Jamie Lynn replied, \"Me and her both have had a very complicated upbringing.\"\n\nShe continued, \"We’ve had very complicated circumstances and we both had to deal with them in different ways. Sometimes we took it out on each other when perhaps we shouldn’t have... I’ve been the one person in her life — and she can say this — I’ve never taken anything from her, you know? I’ve been the one person in her life who’s always said, ‘I just want to be your sister.'\"\n\nAfter a public falling out over Britney’s conservatorship battle, the siblings have seemingly mended their relationship — but that didn’t stop the pop star from delving into the darker times in her memoir, The Woman In Me. Spears recounted how the legal saga (which concluded with the conservatorship's termination in November 2021) caused a rift between her and various family members. She also went further back, detailing how she was mistreated throughout the 13-year conservatorship.\n\n“My little sister — well, when I tell you she was a total bitch, I'm not exaggerating,\" Spears wrote in one section. In a later chapter, she recalled being locked in a rehab facility for months and reaching out to Jamie Lynn for help.\n\n\"I also texted my sister when I was in that place and asked her to get me out,\" she wrote. \"'Stop fighting it,' she texted back. 'There's nothing you can do about it, so stop fighting it.' Along with the rest of them, she kept acting like I was a threat in some way. This will sound crazy, but I'll say it again because it's the truth: I thought they were going to try to kill me.\"\n\nThe “Gimme More” singer said she struggled to understand Jamie Lynn close relationship to their father throughout her conservatorship. \"I felt like she should have taken my side,\" she wrote.\n\nDespite the complicated history, Britney concluded that she still wishes \"the absolute best\" for Jamie Lynn and her family. Spears has also publicly reconnected with her sister, sharing on Instagram that she visited her on the set of Zoey 102 earlier this year.\n\nSign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\nRelated content:\n\nJamie Lynn Spears reprises her iconic role in Zoey 102 first-look photos\n\nBritney Spears learned about the #FreeBritney movement from a nurse while she was in rehab\n\nBritney Spears shuts down a potential biopic: 'Dude I'm not dead'"
