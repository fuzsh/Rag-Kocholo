        "text": "The star, 32, claimed she was best known for her work on screen rather than being known as Britney's sister.\n\nLizzie Edmonds @ lizzieedmo14 November 2023\n\nFans of I’m A Celebrity were left baffled after Jamie Lynn Spears introduced herself as an “actress and singer.”\n\nThe 32-year-old is set to enter the jungle on Sunday night along with nine other famous faces including Nigel Farage and Josie Gibson.\n\nIn her introduction video, released by ITV this week, the star claims she is “best known” for being in the performing arts. But many pointed out online that, in reality, she is best-known for being the sister of pop megastar Britney Spears.\n\nIn the video, Spears says: “I'm best known for being an actress and a singer.\n\n“I have been doing it since I could basically walk.”\n\nWhile she played Zoey Brooks in Nickelodeon's Zoey 101 and, of course, Noreen Fitzgibbons in Netflix's Sweet Magnolias, fans of the show did not hold back from voicing their opinions.\n\nOne wrote: “Be serious Jamie Lynn, you are best known for being Britney Spears's sister.”\n\nAnother added: “Jamie Lynn spears ahaha a singer??? Give me a break.”\n\nOne fan wrote: \"Jamie-Lynn Spears having the brass neck to say she’s best known as an actress and singer I don’t f***ing think so darling!!!!!\"\n\nIn a pre-show interview, Spears - who recently appeared on Dancing with the Stars, said she will challenge misconceptions about herself and “show the real me” when she enters the jungle.\n\nShe said: “There is literally every misconception you can have on a person about me, so I don’t take any of it seriously.\n\n“But I do think going on I’m A Celebrity will be a nice way for people to see the real me.\n\n“This is an opportunity to be myself and do something really cool and have some awesome experiences in the meantime.”\n\nSpears added: “I think my best quality is the fact that it takes a lot to hurt my feelings.\n\n“Unless you are my children or my immediate family, nothing is going to hurt me. I can take a lot of shit and it doesn’t get me down, so I really think it’s a good quality to have in a place where a lot of stuff is thrown at you!”\n\nRead More\n\nWomen’s Aid condemns Celebrity Big Brother’s decision to include Gary Goldsmith\n\nGambon's wife inherits £1.5m fortune while lover is snubbed\n\nTory peer apologises to University Challenge student after antisemitism claims\n\nSponsored\n\nCelebrate Art of London’s collaborations with women artists\n\nThe actress, who revealed that she is afraid of snakes and rats, said: “Everything I have seen I have been afraid of. Absolutely every one of these trials I am dreading.\n\nI’m A Celebrity…Get Me Out Of Here!\n\n“I haven’t looked at any of them and thought, ‘Oh cool, I could do that one’.\n\n“This is going to be terrifying.”\n\nBefore Spears joined the programme, she said she had to get the go-ahead from her family members.\n\n“When they (the show) approached me, the first thing I had to do was talk it over with my family and my kids to make sure they were OK about me being gone for this amount of time,” she said.\n\n“Once I got the all-clear from everybody, I was like, ‘Yeah, let’s go’.\n\n“I think it is so far out of my comfort zone and this year with SAG (the actors’ union) being on strike, I have said ‘yes’ to a lot of unscripted projects.\n\n“I am really enjoying throwing myself into these experiences.”\n\nI’m A Celebrity … Get Me Out Of Here! starts on Monday November 19 at 9pm on ITV1 and ITVX.\n\nThank you for registering\n\nPlease refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in\n\nMORE ABOUT"
