        "text": "Meet the Connected Arts Networks (CAN) Teacher Participants\n\nCongratulations to the newly selected Connected Arts Networks (CAN) Teacher Participants! After a nationwide call for arts educators, 484 talented teachers have been selected to represent theatre, music, dance, visual, and media arts in virtual Professional Learning Communities (PLCs). United by CAN’s vision, they embark on a groundbreaking journey: to advance arts education through a sustainable model of professional learning that will elevate arts education in schools around the country.\n\nThe dedication, expertise, and collaborative spirit of newly selected CAN participants combined with their commitment to creating inclusive and equitable classrooms promises to enrich the lives of countless students. These educators stand poised to reshape the landscape of arts education, leaving a lasting impact on the young people they guide. We look forward to our work together!\n\nRead the CAN Teacher Participant Selection Press Release here.\n\nProgram activities for this project are fully funded through the U.S. Department of Education’s Assistance for Arts Education Program for a total of five years.\n\nCAN Program Map:\n\nView the schools and districts that are currently participating in CAN across the nation, color-coded by art form.\n\nTeacher Participants:"
