Check our list of almost 1600 scanned author signatures. Scroll down to the author's name and click to see one or more scans of his or her autograph.\n\nPlease note that while we have reason to be confident that these are genuine signatures by virtue of their sources, they have not undergone any expert examination or verification. Accordingly, TomFolio does not guarantee their authenticity, nor can a comparison of a signature with these examples exclude the possibility of an autopen, a printed facsimile or a reasonably capable forgery.\n\nOrganized, alphabetically, by last name.\n\nA | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z |"
