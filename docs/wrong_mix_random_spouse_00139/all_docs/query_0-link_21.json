        "text": "JAMIE Lynn Spears has slammed big sister Britney and accused her of lying after the singer called her out for comments made in a recent interview.\n\nDuring an interview on Good Morning America to promote her new memoir, Jamie Lynn, 30, opened up about her decision to write about particular moments with her famous sibling.\n\nBut Britney, 40, accused Jamie Lynn of using her name to sell copies of the book.\n\nHitting back in a new statement, Jamie Lynn wrote: \"Last thing I want to be doing is this, but here we are...\n\n\"It's hard to see these posts, as I know the world also feels. I just wish her well. Brit, I am always here.\n\n\"Quite frankly, the things being said are absolutely not the truth, and I have to clarify that, because now it's getting harder for me to rationalise to my oldest daughter why our family continues to get death threats, as a result of their aunt's vague and accusatory posts.\n\n\"I hate to burst my sister's bubble, but my book is not about her. I can't help that I was born a Spears too, and that some of my experiences involve my sister.\n\n\"I've worked hard since before I was even a teenager, and I've built a career in spite of just being someone's little sister.\"\n\nIn her book, Things I Should've Said, Jamie Lynn claims Britney once, feeling scared, took her into a room with a knife and locked the door.\n\nWhen asked why she chose to write about that moment, Jamie Lynn responded: \"It’s important to remember that I was a kid in that moment. I was scared. That was an experience I had.\n\n\"But I also was fearful to, like, really say anything because I didn’t want to upset anybody or anything. But I also was so upset that she didn’t feel safe.\"\n\nBut Britney later slammed Jamie Lynn in a long note posted on Twitter.\n\nShe raged: \"The two things that did bother me that my sister said was how my behaviour was out of control.\n\n\"She was never around me much 15 years ago at that time… so why are they even talking about that unless she wants to sell a book at my expense ??? REALLY ???\"\n\nBritney, who has spoken in the past about not being allowed to perform remixes to her songs during her Las Vegas residency, also hit out at her sister for doing just that at the Radio Disney Music Awards in 2017.\n\nAfter Britney received the Icon award, Jamie Lynn performed a 15-minute remixed medley of Britney's hits.\n\nIn her latest post, Britney added: \"Then where the lady mentioned why did she accuse you of doing remixes to her songs.\n\n\"I know it may sound like a silly thing to most people but I wrote a lot of my songs and my sister was the baby. She never had to work for anything, Everything was always given to her.\""
