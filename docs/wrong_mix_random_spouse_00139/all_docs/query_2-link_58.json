        "text": "All hail Queen Brit üëë üôå\n\nBritney Spears is one of the most famous pop stars of all time, since the iconic singer burst onto the music scene back in the 90s. From legendary hits such as '...Baby One More Time' and 'Oops!...I Did It Again', to her iconic collab with Elton John, 'Hold Me Closer' in 2022, Britney has certainly proved to be a true pop legend!\n\nThe singer has had an incredibly successful career, from chart-topping songs, albums and sell-out tours to some pretty impressive TV cameos and, of course, a glorious array of perfumes. With the release of her memoir The Woman In Me, and her throwback photos with Taylor Swift, what better time to get to know Britney Spears a little bit better...\n\nHere's everything you need to know about Britney Spears:\n\nHow old is Britney Spears?\n\nBritney Spears was born on 2nd December 1981, meaning she's now 42-years-old!\n\nWhich of her songs are the most popular?\n\nWe think it's safe to say that pretty much every Britney song has been INCREDIBLY popular over the years. But let's take a look through the Top 5 best-selling singles by Britney Spears...\n\n1. '...Baby One More Time', 1999\n\nIt's no surprise that Britney's biggest hit - her debut single - is her most popular song ever. Selling over 100 million copies worldwide, it also reached the Number 1 spot around the globe spending 23 weeks in the charts in total.\n\nNot surprisingly, the record is now certified 3√ó Platinum in the UK.\n\n2. 'Scream & Shout' - Will.I.Am, 2012\n\nThis controversial song hit the headlines after N-Dubz singer Tulisa Contostavlos claimed she'd written it. Either way, it has sold millions of records and was Britney's first hit as a featured artist, spending two weeks at Number 1 and 35 weeks in the charts overall.\n\n3. 'Oops!... I Did It Again', 2000\n\nPerhaps the secret to Britney's success is having a well-placed ellipsis in a song title... This song was Britney's third Number 1, spending a week at Number 1 and a total of 14 weeks in the charts.\n\n4. 'Sometimes', 1999\n\nYou may not recognise Britney's second-ever single - if you're anything less than a die-hard fan - but 'Sometimes' was peak 90s bubblegum pop. Quickly selling 453,000 copies, the song went on to spend 16 weeks in the charts, peaking at Number 3.\n\n5. 'Womanizer', 2008\n\nNot exactly her most thought-provoking lyrics, but 'Womanizer' sold millions of copies and spent a massive 30 weeks in the charts, peaking at Number 3. Just a year after its release, 'Womanizer' was listed at Number 39 in the best selling digital songs of all time.\n\nBritney's book The Woman In Me\n\nIn February 2022 it was revealed that Britney had landed a 'record-breaking' book deal for a tell-all memoir, after being the subject of a humungous bidding war.\n\nPage Six reported that publisher Simon & Schuster beat competitors, and managed to secure the deal for Britney's highly anticipated memoir, for an alleged $15m (¬£11m), in a deal that is: \"one of the biggest of all time, behind the Obamas\".\n\nThe book details Britney's legendary rise to fame, as well as her relationship with her family and her experience living under a conservatorship - which ended in November 2021 - for over a decade. Britney's conservatorship became particularly high profile between 2020 and 2021, sparking the Free Britney movement.\n\nBritney's book The Woman In Me was released in October 2023. The book has now become a New York Times bestseller.\n\nBritney's perfumes\n\nBritney Spears has no less than SEVEN perfumes on sale in the UK, but if we're being technical, she's produced over 30 in total. Her original fragrance, Curious, was released with Elizabeth Arden in 2004 and broke the company's first-week gross for a perfume.\n\nMore recently, Brit has released scents such as Rainbow Fantasy (2019), Glitter Fantasy (2020), Fantasy Intense (2021), Electric Fantasy (2021), Blissful Fantasy (2022) and Naked Fantasy (2022).\n\nWhat is Britney's net worth?\n\nAccording to Celebritynetworth.com Britney's net worth is thought to be around $70 million, however other sources state it to be nearer $60 million.\n\nWho is Britney Spears' sister?\n\nBritney Spears' sister is Jamie Lynn Spears.

Sharing the news on Instagram, Britney wrote: 'It is with our deepest sadness we have to announce that we have lost our miracle baby early in the pregnancy.\n\n'This is a devastating time for any parent. Perhaps we should have waited to announce until we were further along however we were overly excited to share the good news.

S--- happens. Asking for privacy seems ridiculous so I will ask for everyone including media to be kind and thoughtful.' (sic)\n\nThe pair met on the set of her November 2016 music video for 'Slumber Party'. Britney confirmed their relationship with an Instagram photo in January 2017 and Sam told Men's Health: \"After the video came out, nobody knew we were dating.

Vogue magazine posted three photos from the wedding, one of Britney and Sam, another of Britney's Versace dress, and a third of the stunning venue.\n\nBritney Spears' conservatorship\n\nBritney Spears was placed in a conservatorship back in 2008, which had her father acting as main her main conservator, and saw him controlling her life and financial decisions for 13 years.\n\nAfter various documentaries, and the launch of the Free Britney movement, the public became more aware of Britney's situation and desire to re-gain control of her own life decisions.\n\nIn September 2021, after months of court proceedings, her father Jamie had his power removed - being replaced by a certified public accountant nominated by Britney herself.\n\nA hearing, which took place on 12th November 2021, finally saw a judge terminate the conservatorship altogether.
