How can she say this is \"her story\" when she either brings Britney or the conservatorship up on every page?\n\nAnd what makes it worse is they didn't have to steal the good sis's money. I don't know Britney personally but she seems like she loves her family, and I'm sure if they needed money all they had to do was ask for it and she would have given it to them. Jamie Lynn is just a shameful opportunist.\n\nLOL\n\nThat picture ðŸ‘€\n\n\"I canâ€™t believe Iâ€™m officially a NATIONAL BEST SELLING AUTHOR! I have no words except how grateful I am that I was able share my story with yâ€™all.\"\n\nThe book, which debuted January 18th, sits at #1,362 in Books on Amazon.\n\nEven Jesus doesn't like you.\n\nit's already down to #19 on christian inspirational, #27 in entertainer bios, and #10 on tv people bios, while valerie bertinelli's book is still #2. I'm gonna laugh if someone went on a shopping spree to briefly bump her to the top, where fucking stassi is now reigning.\n\nGood for Valerie; she's a decent person who as far as I know never hurt anyone and just stays in her lane coaching children who are bakers with Duff and cooking on her show.\n\nshe's so sweet when the kids panic <3\n\nI wonder if she has a cross next time to her best seller's note. Crosses denote when the author, publisher, whoever buys a bunch of the books themselves for signings, meet n greets, etc and use that to get them on the best sellers list. It just happened with Hannah Brown.\n\n(no subject) - ah0000 Expand\n\nUm.... lol\n\nShe has fans?\n\nHer husband, father, and child.\n\n\"Child\". Haha. She has two kids, but the idea of only one being her fan is hilarious."
