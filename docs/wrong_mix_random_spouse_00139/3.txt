However, many fans have been critical of her new book. Older sister Britney Spears has accused her of fabricating events for the sake of selling books. In one lengthy public Twitter message, Britney asked her little sister to “please please stop with these crazy lies for the Hollywood books.”

Jamie Lynn responded to her sister through her Instagram stories, writing, “Nobody trashes your name more than someone who’s afraid you’ll tell people the truth.”

“I read this book and a lot of the things that were stated are lies,” one user wrote. “She mentioned things about Britney Spears, Sam Lufti and her old costar Alexi which all publicly called Jaime Lynn a liar. Also, Jaime Lynn stated this book is not about Britney, however she mentions Britney 230 times for clout. I do not recommend this book at all.”

“This book is the story about a corrupt family and how they stayed silent witnessing abuse, exploitation and human trafficking all because of greed,” another user wrote. “Wouldn’t recommend buying or reading this book.”

“More of a tell-all than a memoir,” another added. “While we can’t know the facts behind the scenes, her account of events feels disingenuous and dramatized with a skew towards the author’s moral infallibility. All of the stories are intended to present Jamie Lynn as a bullied martyr, but they end up falling flat when, every time, everyone in the world is at fault but her.”

Okay, But What Do The Positive Reviews Say?

One 5-star review read, “I think the book was great and loved learning about her childhood and what she experienced growing up. Easy read and enjoyable.”

Another 5-star review said that Jamie Lynn was “honoring her voice & story.”

“As a Britney fan it was nice to learn more about her family and her sister,” one user wrote. “Her sister has her own perspective and she has a right to her own story, her own voice, her own side. I think it was brave to share about her childhood and her background because we all can get a bigger picture of her family dynamics.”

“The story of Jamie Lynn’s pregnancy, toxic relationship, experience as a songwriter in Nashville, and then her commitment to her now husband, is inspiring,” they continued. “The story of her daughter’s accident brought me to tears. I am happy for her that she found stability, healing, and faith from that miracle and I’m thankful that she was bold enough to share her story with the world. I can’t imagine what it must be like to grow up in the Spears family but she’s a strong individual she has turned out to be. She’s a survivor.”

“Really enjoyed this book,” another wrote. “I’ve always been a fan of Britney, however I do not believe Jamie Lynn is to blame for Britney's troubles and feel she is entitled as much as anyone else to share her life experiences. It is so obvious from this book that she has also been through a difficult time. I hope she and her sister both find peace and can become close again.”
