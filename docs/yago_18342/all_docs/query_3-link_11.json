        "text": "APPEAL\n\nFaiz Mustapha with N. M. Saheed, for defendant-appellant.\n\nH. L. de Silva, P.C. with K. Kanag-Iswaran and S. Mahenthiran for plaintiff-respondent.\n\nCur. adv. vult\n\nMarch 29, 1985.\n\nSIVA SELLIAH, J.\n\nThis is an appeal by the defendant-appellant from the judgment of: the learned District Judge of Jaffna dated 13:12:71 in case No. D.C. Jaffna L-3362 ordering that the plaintiff be restored to the possession of the premises from which he was ejected on 28.7.68 in execution of the decree in case No. 3268 L and awarding costs to the plaintiff.\n\nThe facts material for the determination of this appeal are as follows :\n\nThe defendant (Abdul Cader) sued one Mrs. Sinniahpillai for arrears of rent, damages and ejectment in case No, 3268 L on 5.5.68:: On consent motion P14C in which defendant (hereinafter referred to as Abdul Cader) waived arrears of rent and damages and Mrs. Sinniahpillai consented to judgment in ejectment, decree was entered accordingly. Thereafter Abdul Cader took out writ and ;.the plaintiff (hereinafter referred to as Nagaratnam) was ejected on 28.7 68. Nagaratnam thereafter filed the necessary papers for restoration of possession and the matter was duly inquired into culminating in the judgment dated 13.12.71 ordering that Nagaratnam be restored to possession. Nagaratnam has contended that although prior to 1967\n\n3\n\nhe was carrying on business in the premises as Manager, and the business was registered in his own name from 1964 (P1) the tenant of the premises was Mrs. Sinniahpillai. Nevertheless after May 1961 Mrs. Sinniahpillai ceased to be interested in the business and was resident in Colombo -and as from 1967 by P2-P5 and P13 he (Nagaratnam) paid all arrears and rents to Abdul Cader's brother Careem Hadjiar who was a co-owner of the property and obtained tenancy from him (Careem Hadjiar) ; and that P 13, and P2-P5 show that as from October 1967 Nagaratnam in fact possessed the premises in his own right at the relevant time at which he was ejected as tenant of Careem Hadjiar and could thus not be evicted from the premises as he came within the ambit of section 328 of the Civil Procedure Code. Abdul Cader on the other hand contended that Nagaratnam was an agent of Mrs. Sinniahpillai and did not come within the scope of section 328 of the Civil Procedure Code and therefore was properly ejected. The learned District Judge. has very carefully considered the rival contentions, the facts and the law applicable and concluded that the plaintiff came within the scope of section 328 and has held that Abdul Cader has chosen-a short cut to eject Nagaratnam from the premises, that at the time the action against Abdul Cadet's tenant was filed Nagaratnam was ;already in occupation as tenant of another co-owner and that Nagaratnam was forcibly ejected in spite of his protests and ordered restoration of possession. -\n\nIt now becomes necessary to examine the provisions of section 328 of the Civil Procedure Code (Chapter 101) which states as follows\n\n\"328. (1) If any person other than the judgment-debtor is dispossessed of any property in execution of a decree, and such person disputes the right of the decree-holder to dispossess him of such property under the decree, on the ground that the property was bona fide in his possession on his own account or on account of some person other than the judgment-debtor, and that it was not comprised in the decree, or that, if it was comprised in the decree, he was not a party to the action in which the decree was passed, he may apply to the court by petition stating his grounds of dispute.\n\n(2) If after examining the applicant ........ the court shall proceed to: investigate the matter in dispute...........\n\nIn hearing an application under the section the court shall confine itself to the grounds of dispute above specified.\n\n4\n\nIt is manifest from a consideration of these provisions, that Nagaratnam had to establish that the property was.. bona fide in his possession on his own account or on account of some person other than the judgment-debtor and that he was not a- party to the action in which the decree was passed. The. defendant-appellant has alleged in his petition of appeal that the plaintiff-respondent was the agent of his tenant Mrs. Sinniahpillai, that he was a trespasser and that he thus could be ejected on the decree.\n\nIt is relevant at this stage to mention that Abdul Cader had filed action in D.C. Jaffna L/1602 in 1962 against the tenant Mrs. Sinniahpillai on the ground of arrears of rent and of judgment which was however- set aside in appeal by the Supreme Court by P10 on 4.6.67. Thereafter Abdul Cader filed action against he tenant Mrs. Sinniahpillai and Nagaratnam in case No. L 3255 on 27.4:68 for ejectment on the ground of arrears and subletting but chose not to pursue the said action which was' abated only on 11. 1.69. He also filed action L 3268 a few days after the institution of action L 3255 on 5.5.68 against the tenant Mrs. Sinniahpillai only and obtained a consent decree on 14.7.68 which the plaintiff-respondent alleged was a collusive decree by virtue of which Nagaratnam was ejected. It has also transpired that from 1961-1967 the tenant was not in occupation and it was Nagaratnam who carried on the business in the said premises and indeed conducted the appeal in L 1602.. During this period no rents were paid and Abdul Cader was fully aware of the-fact that Nagaratnam was in occupation and carried on business there Nagaratnam has also admitted that prior to 1967 the tenant was Mrs. Sinniahpillai. Nagaratnam sensing danger had offered to become the tenant of Abdul Cader who however wanted key money in Rs. 7,500 and was prosecuted but acquitted in the Magistrate's Court , negotiations by Nagaratnam to secure tenancy from Abdul Cader failed. It is evident that the tenant Mrs. Sinniahpillai had not paid rent from May 1961 nor been in occupation as she was resident. in Colombo. Nagaratnam thereafter offered the rents due for the premises to Abdul Cadet's brother Careem Hadjiar who was a co-owner of the premises and paid him..."
