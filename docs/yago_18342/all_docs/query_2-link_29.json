        "text": "“The United States Government issued a statement affirming their support for the Sri Lankan government, welcoming their victories and saying, “[t]he United States does not advocate that the Government of Sri Lanka negotiate with the LTTE, a group designated by America as a Foreign Terrorist Organization since 1997.” It is reported that this was the American signal to Sri Lanka to move forward with the complete annihilation of the LTTE.\n\nA leaked US embassy cable says the ban marks the final end of the already moribund peace process launched by the UNP-led government in 2002.”\n\nThe Tamil National Alliance writes to Obama and Clinton. Extracts of their letter below:\n\n“It is our submission that the Sri Lankan State prosecutes the current war in the manner outlined above in the pursuit of a given ideological position – the assertion of a Sinhala Buddhist supremacy throughout the whole of Sri Lanka, and that in order to achieve that objective a process of Genocide of the Tamil people is in progress…. Consequently, we would like to urge that the policy of the United States of America towards the resolution of the Tamil National Question reflects the existence of two distinct Nations of People inhabiting Sri Lanka and where these two nations are encouraged to associate with one another by pooling their sovereignties to form the State.”\n\nAn eyewitness told Human Rights Watch, shelling occured at around 11:45 a.m. on January 22. He told HRW, “There was heavy shelling, especially where people gathered-near the hospital and where the UN distributed food. People were running around, crying. There was no shelter. Some were trying to hide under trees, like animals… We could hear where the shelling was coming from. It was coming from the other side of the A35 road [from the area where government forces were located]”.\n\nDr T Varatharajah, one of the few remaining doctors left, tells TamilNet,\n\n“It is shocking that artillery attack has been stepped up on the area announced as attack-free zone by the Sri Lankan military. The casualties today would have been much lower, had the promise been kept or there was no promise at all”.\n\nMore civilians were killed overnight, as at least 12 shells landed in vicinity of the United Nations hub. Children were among the victims, killed and injured as shrapnel ripped through makeshift shelters that were set up close to the United Nations base.\n\nShelling continued throughout the day. Despite the shelling, thousands of civilians queued up to receive food rations. People lay on the ground as they heard the incoming fire approaching. Five shells landed in close proximity to the food queues, reportedly killing 20 people and injuring many others.\n\nBetween five and 13 people were killed and 27 injured, as shells hit Udayaarkaadu hospital. One of the dead is a nurse who was treating patients at the hospital.\n\nLiberation Tigers of Tamileelam (LTTE) Political Head B. Nadesan says the Sri Lankan military is commiting a war crime by targetting the No Fire Zone. He adds “We come to know that the civilians who have fled the war zone and got into the hands of the military are put to untold humiliation and suffering”. “There is no mechanism to guarantee the human dignity of civilians who are caught in the hands of the Sri Lanakn military. The phenomenon is nothing new, but a historical legacy of ages in this island,” Nadesan said.\n\n“There can be little doubt that if immediate steps are not taken to stop the shelling, and emergency medical supplies and medical personnel not sent into the affected areas, there would be many more hundred civilian deaths as a result of lack of treatment,” says the Tamil National Alliance.\n\n“Under these dire circumstances the TNA calls upon the international community to use all its influence with the Sri Lankan State to bring an immediate end to the massacre of these Tamil civilians. The TNA further appeals that the international community intervenes to secure immediate medical supplies and medical personnel to be sent to treat the affected civilians. The TNA reiterates that these steps must be taken within the next 24 hours if the civilian death toll is not to increase to several more hundreds.”\n\nBetween 26th January and 4th February PTK hospital comes under repeated attack. The OISL says “witnesses described multiple rounds falling sequentially on the hospital within a very short period of time, indicating the possible use of MBRLs by SLA… The hospital was overcrowded and many patients were on the floor due to a lack of beds, as well as in hallways and outside, on the ground. Witnesses told investigators that as shells fell, people ran to take cover, including several patients who ran towards bunkers located outside the hospital, carrying their intravenous drips with them.”.\n\n“We have been very clear that any individual who wishes to leave the combat zone has an individual right to move anywhere. We have not imposed any restriction on individuals. But, we will not be organising any ‘organised exodus’ against the collective will of the people who have sought refuge away from a genocidal military,” says Liberation Tigers of Tamileelam (LTTE) Political Head B. Nadesan. “We are urging responsible top officials of the UN and other international agencies to immediately visit the ‘safety zone’ and to obtain the views of the civilians and make independent assessment of the needs and concerns of the civilians.”\n\n“This liberation war between the Tamil Tigers for self determination and the Sri Lankan Government has been going on for well over 27 years and has resulted in the deaths of hundreds and thousands of civilians from both sides of the conflict and much destruction in the country,” says South Africa’s ANC. “The ANC urges all parties in the conflict, both the LTTE and the Sri lankan Government to call a halt, immediately institute a ceasefire and allow humanitarian aid to be brought to civilians caught in the conflict who are in dire need of assistance. The ANC calls on all political players to immediately return to the negotiating table and resume a peaceful process of finding a lasting political solution to the conflict.”\n\nSri Lankan government said that it was committed to adhering to the zero civilian casualty policy. That same day the security forces stepped up their assault on Puthukkudiyirippu (PTK). PTK hospital was shelled repeatedly on 1 Feb, striking various facilities including a ward with women and children and a church. ICRC staff were present during the attacks and issued a press statement that day stating that the hospital had been shelled and it had over 500 patients, with more injured patients arriving. A press statement issued the following day stated that at least nine people had been killed and 20 injurd by shelling on 1 Feb.\n\nThree attacks. First attack: 1 person injured by shrapnel inside the hospital. Second attack: 1 shell hit the hospital, 1 killed and 4 injured. Third attack: 1 shell hit the woman and children ward (no casualty info).\n\nIn an interview, Gotabaya Rajapaksa said:\n\nIf they [reports] are referring to the [PTK] hospital, now there shouldn’t be a hospital or anything because we withdrew that. We got all the patients to Vavuniya, out of there. So nothing should exist beyond the No Fire Zone … No hospital should operate in the area, nothing should operate. That is why we clearly gave these No Fire Zones… For the LTTE …to crush the terrorists, there is nothing called unproportionate.\n\nDenmark’s Foreign Minister, Per Stig Møller releases the following statement:\n\n“It is imperative that both sides respect international humanitarian laws. The Tamil Tigers (LTTE) should not block the civilians from fleeing the conflict zone. At the same time Sri Lanka government should ensure that the civilians coming from the war zone be treated with respect,” the report further said.\n\n“Both Sri Lanka government and Tamil Tigers are responsible to safeguard the civilians. Denmark has repeatedly stressed that it is necessary to find a political solution to achieve lasting peace and this is the message that we continue to pass.”\n\nIntense attack on PTK hospital in the morning, killing more patients. Around 300 patients and 18 ICRC staff fled PTK hospital and went to Putumattalan along with the remaining UN national staff and dependants.\n\nAfter evacuating PTK hospital on 4th Feb, the government medial staff and the ICRC estabished a makeshift facility at the Putumattalan school, which consisted of four classroom buildings and two temporary shelters. The UN national staff and dependants set up near the school. Both organisations provided the government and the military with the GPS coordinated for their locations.\n\nText message: “PTK hosp being vacated, heavy shelling for about 16 hours we are in trenches.”\n\nA leaked US embassy cable states: “Ambassador noted disturbing unconfirmed reports that civilians from the north had disappeared during the transfer from the hospital in Vavuniya to the camps in Vavuniya, while several young women were found in the hospital morgue shot between the eyes. Such reports underline the need for international monitoring of the registration and transfer process. Since Vavuniya has the largest number of paramilitary groups operating anywhere in Sri Lanka, it is very important to ensure a continuous UNHCR or other UN presence in the camps to ensure the safety of IDPs in the camps.”\n\nAbout 150 protesters demonstrated outside the office of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Colombo, throwing stones at the building. It comes after reports that the organisation had placed an order for 35,000 body bags. “There is no need for 35,000 body bags or for that matter 3,500,” Keheliya Rambukwella, a government spokesman said, shortly after the attack on the ICRC office. “They may cancel the order tomorrow. But first they want to create a fear psychosis in the eyes of the international community,” he said.\n\n26-year-old diaspora Murugathasan Varnakulasingham self immolated in front of the United Nations building in Geneva. Before he doused himself in petrol and set himself alight in the Place des Nations in Geneva, Mr Varnakulasingham wrote a five-page letter.\n\nIt read: “We Tamils, displaced and all over the world, loudly raised our problems and asked for help before [the] international community in your own language for three decades.\n\n“But nothing happened… So I decided to sacrifice my life… The flames over my body will be a torch to guide you through the liberation path.”\n\nThe ICRC evacuated Monday more than 400 seriously wounded civilians in Sri Lanka Army (SLA) artillery barrage from Puthumaaththa’lan in Mullaiththeevu district. This is the third batch of transport through sea of seriously wounded civilians who have been waiting for further treatment at higher hospitals, according to the local staff of the ICRC. The ICRC services in Vanni are carried out by its local staff as the organisation was forced to withdraw its foreign staff from Vanni as Government of Sri Lanka did not provide necessary security guarantees for foreign nationals of the ICRC.\n\nUNICEF issues a statement expressing grave concern for the safety of children in conflict areas, stating that “we have clear indications that the LTTE has intensified forcible recruitment of civilians and that children as young as 14 years old are now being targeted.” Scores of injured children have been evacuated in the past week,” said UNICEF’s Duamelle. “Children are victims of this conflict by being killed, injured, recruited, displaced, separated and denied their every day needs due to the fighting.” The main injuries to children have been burns, fractures, shrapnel and bullet wounds. UNICEF reiterates the call it has made time and again to Government and the LTTE – civilians, especially children, must be given every protection from the fighting.\n\nAn artillery barrage into the No Fire Zone killed at least 108 civilians and causing injuries to more than 200. At 2:00 a.m. the army reportedly fired more than 200 shells, signalling the beginning of more than 10 hours of continuous shelling. The US State Department reports thirty entire families were amongst those killed. Witnesses reported that during the night, at least two patients in Putumattalan hospital were killed when an artillery shell landed near the surgical ward, and six members of a family were killed when a shell landed on their shelter, on the edge of the hospital boundary.\n\n“The international countries say that the Tigers should lay down their weapons and come to talks but the position of our government is that there is no need to talk to them once they give up their arms,” said Sri Lanka’s Prime Minister Ratnasiri Wickramasinghe. “The truth is that some are asking us to stop the war in their own interests but there is no need for our government to act so as to fulfill their selfish motives,” he said.\n\nA bipartisan group of seven senior U.S. Senators wrote to the Foreign Secretary Hilary Clinton calling for an immedia ceasefire. The statement reads; “The situation in Sri Lanka is unacceptable and must be remedied as quickly as possible. We commend your recent statement with UK Foreign Minister David Milliband that called on the government and the LTTE to adhere to a ceasefire, allow access to humanitarian agencies, and resume political discussions to bring the long-standing ethnic conflict to an end. An enduring peace can be achieved only through a political solution that treats the Tamil minority as equal citizens under the law. Without such an agreement, the violence will only continue.”\n\nUN High Commissioner for Human Rights issued a statement expressing her concern for the civilians. She stated: “Certain actions being undertaken by the Sri Lankan military and by the LTTE may constitute violations of international human rights and humanitarian law […] We need to know more about what is going on, but we know enough to be sure that the situation is absolutely desperate. The world today is ever sensitive about such acts that could amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity”. She called for a cease fire to allow for evacuation and urged the government to grant full access to UN and other independent agencies to allow an accurate assessment of the human rights and humanitarian conditions in the conflict zone. She said 2,800 civilians have been killed since Jan 20. TamilNet reports that Jaffna MP, Kajendran, criticised the High Commissioner stating: “Calling for the evacuation of civilians and making them to end up in the hands of their killers, is taking side with one of the parties to the conflict and amounts to another one of the war crimes, perhaps the most serious one of them when comes from a world body of human rights”.\n\nIn a report entitled “Undue Deaths due to Non-Availability of Essential Drugs at Mullaittivu” it was found that “most hospital deaths could have been prevented if basic infrastructure facilities and essential medicines were made available… We have been supplied with no antibiotics, no anaesthetics and not even a single bottle of IV fluid, leaving us in a desperate situation of not bein able to provide even lifessaving emergency surgery”. The Regional Directors of Health Services of Mullaithivu and Killinochchi reported that “… less than 5 percent of the combined quota of drugs and dressings that are meant for the last quarter of last year and for the first quarter of this year have been sent to us, so far.\n\nEyewitnesses in Valayanmadam reported seeing a government aircraft kill 20 people who had gathered to eat breakfast. A second aircraft arrived at 6:45 a.m. The source and his family hid in a bunker when a bomb dropped on them. The witness’s two-year-old son received burns and an eye injury and his four-year old son received injuries to the head and arm. His brother was killed along with the brother’s wife and four children, aged nine, seven, and four-years-old, and 1.5 months. Altogether six people were killed and more than 60 injured. That area was attacked\n\nabout eight times that day.\n\nThe US State Department says, “according to an organization, IDPs who escaped the NFZ said that the SLA broadcast an announcement over speakers instructing residents to come across the lagoon into the government-controlled area immediately, as the SLA was going to advance into the NFZ. Soon afterwards, the government forces fired a large shell into the midst of these IDPs, causing heavy casualties.”\n\nHeavy shelling is reeported in the NFZ. A source contacted the BBC and said that the intensity of shell fire had increased in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe US releases a statement saying,\n\n“Both sides must immediately return to a humanitarian pause and both must respect the right of free movement of those civilian men, women and children trapped by the fighting… A durable and lasting peace will only be achieved through a political solution that addresses the legitimate aspirations of all Sri Lankan communities… We urge the Sri Lankan government to employ diplomacy to permit a peaceful outcome of this conflict. We call on the Sri Lankan government to put forward a proposal now to engage Tamils who do not espouse violence or terrorism, and to develop power sharing arrangements so that lasting peace and reconciliation can be achieved.”\n\nThe TNA tells India,\n\n“the fact that the Sri Lankan State and its Armed forces despite the widest possible international outcry that the safety of Tamil Civlians is paramount, have not been deterred even to the slightest degree, in the pursuit of their military attacks in Tamil Civilian populated areas, without any regard whatever, for the safety of Tamil Civilians is indicative of the deep hostility that the Sri Lankan State and its Armed forces bear towards the Tamil people. The Sri Lankan State’s actions establish beyond a shadow of doubt, that the real intention of the Sri Lankan State is the progressive extermination of the Tamil people”.\n\nThe Sri Lankan immigration officer’s eyes narrowed as she swiped my passport at the international airport in Colombo last week. “Come this way,” she said, leading me into a side room, where a colleague typed my details into a computer.\n\nA message flashed up on his screen: “DO NOT ALLOW TO ENTER THE COUNTRY.” With that, my passport was confiscated, I was escorted to a detention room, locked up for the night, and deported the next day. I can’t say that I was surprised, though it was my first deportation in 12 years of reporting from China, the former Soviet Union and South Asia.\n\n“I told him (Mr Nambiar) that we cannot extend our decision to restrict offensive military operations because there was no result during the previous halt in the fighting,” the Sri Lankan defence secretary, Gotabhaya Rajapakse, said in an interview with the BBC. Though he denied firing in the No Fire Zone, he added, “However, if the rebel leader, Prabhakaran, is seen then we will take him out, even if it is inside the safe zone”. “But we will take all measures to avoid civilian casualties,” he said.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary David Miliband says,\n\nI remain gravely concerned at the continuing conflict in northern Sri Lanka that threatens many thousands of civilian lives. The British Government maintains its calls for an immediate ceasefire in Sri Lanka and for civilians to be allowed to leave the conflict area….\n\nProtests and demonstrations around the world have highlighted the tragic loss of life of innocent civilians in Sri Lanka. Further loss of life will only compound that tragedy. The Tamil community are a community we value and they make an important contribution to British society. They have seen friends and relatives perish, and their loved ones are still at grave risk from the fighting. We have heard their voice and will keep listening. We are committed to do all we can to bring this terrible conflict to an end.\n\nDr T Satyamurthy, director of health services in Kilinochchi, said there were several hundred injured and dozens of dead there and at another, nearby hospital.\n\nHe also said his staff had told him that they had seen “many dead bodies” by the edge of a road in the area.\n\nICRC country chief Paul Castella told the BBC that government doctors working in the area were “really worn out”.\n\n“These people are working for months now without any break, they work day and night. And medical supplies are lacking,” he added.\n\nIn a statement released today the LTTE says,\n\nThe LTTE would like reiterate its commitment to a ceasefire without any preconditions, as urged by the US and other members of the international community. The LTTE is also ready for a meaningful negotiation on all issues related to humanitarian access, security, movement and welfare of the Tamil civilian population.\n\nThe LTTE urges the Sri Lankan government to stop its military actions, including shelling and bombing civilian areas and accept the call of the United States and other members of the International community for a ceasefire, which we believe will create a conducive atmosphere for talks on all relevant issues.\n\nThe LTTE issues the following statement.\n\nYesterday, 20.04.2009, over 1000 civilians were killed and near 2300 civilians were injured. And today, a situation of bloodbath is prevailing.\n\nLTTE request the ICRC to provide medical supplies and evacuate by ship the 2000 people injured and facing imminent danger. Immediate food is required as several are faced with starvation. The LTTE has provided coordinates for the ICRC ships to land at a new port as Puthumathalan is now under Sri Lankan military occupation.\n\nThese are serious war crimes and the Sri Lankan government and the head of the armed forces are direct responsible for this carnage.\n\nPrompted by the intensity of the conflict and “mass casualties among civilians”, the ICRC issued a press release calling on both parties to take “exceptional precautionary measures to minimize further bloodshed” in NFZ 2. It called on the LTTE to keep its fighters and military resources “well away from places where civilians are concentrated and allow civilians who want to leave the area to do so safely.” It also called on the Government to “ensure that the methods and means of warfare they employ make it possible to clearly distinguish at all times between civilians and civilian objects on the one hand, and military objectives on the other. In this situation we are particularly concerned about the impact on civilians of using weapons such as artillery.\n\nIndian Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee said “The Indian government is very unhappy at the continued killing of innocent Tamil civilians in Sri Lanka”.\n\n“These killings must stop. The Sri Lankan government has a responsibility to protect its own citizens and the LTTE must stop its barbaric attempt to hold civilians hostage.”\n\n“There is no military solution to this ongoing humanitarian crisis, and all concerned should recognise this fact.\n\n“The only lasting solution will come from political efforts to address the real concerns of the Tamil people, giving them lives of dignity within the Sri Lankan mainstream,” the foreign minister said.\n\nIn Washington, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told Congress: “This is such a terrible humanitarian tragedy. And we have been pressing the Sri Lankan government for a halt in the fighting so that we could secure a safe passage for as many of the trapped civilians as possible.\n\n“I think that the Sri Lankan government knows that the entire world is very disappointed, that in its efforts to end what it sees as 25 years of conflict, it is causing such untold suffering.”\n\n“We have made it clear that, as soon as there is some lull in the fighting or an end to the fighting, that there has to be not only massive humanitarian aid, but a political resolution.”\n\n“There seems to be very little openness on the part of the Tamil Tiger leadership to cease their efforts so that we could try to get in and help the people.”\n\nThe United States is already “beginning intensive post-conflict planning,” she said.\n\nThe OISL says “according to witnesses, the church and its compound were then packed with over 1,000 IDPs seeking shelter. A humanitarian worker described the aftermath of the attacks: “it was a terrible sight: There were body parts blown everywhere. I even saw hands hanging on the trees. I saw human body parts all over the vehicles.”\n\nSeveral witnesses again described bombs exploding overhead into “bomblets” before impacting on the ground during these incidents. One witness who was injured in the shelling said he could hear “a launch noise, the sound of the explosion and then as many as 40 or 50 smaller explosions which occur over a wide area”.\n\nRev. Fr. Vasanthaseelan, 35, has his left leg amputated.\n\nThe OISL reports “after intense SLA shelling, including immediately around Putumatallan Hospital, when thousands of civilians attempted to leave the LTTE-controlled area… the LTTE threatened them and fired shots into the air to scare them”.\n\n“Later that same night… According to witness testimony, people were very desperate to flee the fighting and began walking towards the Nandi Kaddal lagoon, some carrying their friends or relatives who were unable to walk due to injuries or exhaustion. The LTTE did not attempt to stop them this time, and some cadres even helped them. Unconfirmed reports suggest that some of those trying to cross may have been killed by the SLA shooting, because at the time there was no counter fire from behind where the LTTE military was located.”\n\nIn a statement, the United States says it “is deeply concerned about the plight of innocent civilians caught up in the conflict between the government of Sri Lanka and the Tamil Tigers, and the mounting death toll”.\n\n“We call on both sides to stop fighting immediately and allow civilians to safely leave the combat zone,” it said.\n\nThe US Embassy in Colombo notes that the last shipment of medicine into the NFZ took place on April 8 and there was a critical shortage of needed supplies.\n\nA separate Tamil Eelam is the only solution that will permanently put an end to the problems of the Tamil people in the island of Sri Lanka, said Tamil Nadu former Chief Minister and principal Leader of the Opposition, Jayalalitha Jayaram at an election rally in Salem city.\n\nIn a powerful, moving speech, on Saturday April 25, she resolved to fight to attain independent Eelam.\n\n“I met Art of Living founder Sri Sri Ravishankar who has just returned from the war-zone in the Vanni. He gave me CDs and photographs of the atrocities. My heart boils when I looked at it,” the AIADMK leader said.\n\nGordon Weiss, the UN spokesman in Sri Lanka, says “children as young as 12,” are being forced to fight for the LTTE. He adds that a 16-year-old child of a UN staff member was amongst those listed. The LTTE’s Nadesan denies the charge, stating “A large number of teenagers and children were killed in the deliberate shelling, bombing and firing by the Sri Lankan forces in Vanni in the last few months”. “The North Eastern Secretariat on Human Rights (NESoHR) is working on compiling documentary evidence on the massacre of children and all other war crimes and human rights abuses committed by the Colombo government during the war and this will be brought to light at the right time,” he added.\n\nThe UN deputy spokeswoman Marie Okabe said the humanitarian situation “continues to be critical, civilian casualties have been tragically high and their suffering horrendous”.\n\nSeveral civilians were killed and more than 200, wounded in Sri Lanka Army (SLA) shelling and gunfire, have been admitted at Mu’l’li-vaaykkaal hospital in the early hours of Monday as the SLA opened fire from its positions attempting to advance further into the densely populated so-called safety zone (No Fire Zone) from 3:30 a.m. Monday. Heavy exchange of gunfire continued and civilians were forced to stay inside the bunkers as rounds were whizzing over them. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) bombers carried out two sorties of air raids in the morning, according to latest reports from Vanni. The aggression by the SLA comes a few hours after Sri Lanka rejected LTTE announced unilateral ceasefire.\n\nLawrance Christy, the planning director of Tamils Rehabilitation Organisation (TRO) writes this urgent appeal from inside the No Fire Zone. “An Open Letter to the Members of the Security Council, the United Nations and the International Community: You are our only hope… Based on their previous experiences over the past three months TRO officials in the ‘safe zone’ have predicted that if the expected offensive goes forward there will be more than 10,000 casualties as the area is densely populated and there is no cover from bombs, shells, and bullets.”\n\nIn a separate account that day he adds, “I am writing this crying. A lump of grief has chocked my throat. This is because of the feeling that we are abandoned by the International Community. “\n\nThe UN Security Council hosts another informal meeting on Sri Lanka. No one objects to Sri Lanka receiving a $1.6 billion USD loan from the IMF. British Ambassador John Sawers said punishing Sri Lanka did not belong on the Security Council agenda.\n\n“We’re not in the job of penalising the government of Sri Lanka,” Sawers said. “We want to help the government of Sri Lanka to address this problem. I just wish that the government … was more open to the offers of help that have been extended to it.” “Despite the government of Sri Lanka’s promise to suspend combat operations, most accounts indicate that shelling into the conflict zone continues,” said U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice. “Very credible reports also indicate that the Tamil Tigers are using civilians as human shields, and have, in some cases, shot at civilians trying to leave the conflict area.”\n\nThen British and French foreign ministers David Miliband and Bernard Kouchner wrote in The Times on the 30th of April 2009, after a visit to the island where they met with Mahinda Rajapaksa.\n\n“The gravity of the situation means that the international community has a duty to respond and to do all that we can to halt the suffering.\n\nAs members of the UN Security Council we do not shy away from the responsibility of sovereign governments and the international community to protect civilians. Hillary Clinton, the US Secretary of State, has joined us in describing the failure to protect civilians in Sri Lanka as truly shocking. Yesterday we took our plea direct to the Sri Lankan Government. In its moment of triumph it must show the humanity and self-interest to find a way to win the peace.”\n\nGotabaya Rajapaksa says his meeting with David Miliband and French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchener was a “waste of time”. He adds “In Mr Miliband’s constituency there are many Tamils and they want to save the LTTE leadership, not civilians. It’s a joke. We have proved we can save these civilians by rescuing 200,000. So why so many foreign ministers in this indecent hurry?… We’re just wasting our time with these dignitaries and VIPs coming to this country over and over again because of your internal problem to satisfy their [Tamil] diaspora”.\n\nThe Sri Lankan government admitted that it had bombed the ‘No Fire Zone’ where it had instructed Tamil civilians to seek shelter.\n\nConfronted with leaked satellite footage of the region, which showed extensive crater marks from Sri Lankan military shelling, Sri Lankan Foreign Secretary Palitha Kohona made the admission in an interview with Al Jazeera despite earlier government denials.\n\nHowever, Sri Lanka’s president Mahinda Rajapaksa contradicted his foreign secretary by continuing to categorically deny that the military had attacked civilian areas with heavy weapons.\n\n“If you are not willing to accept the fact that we are not using heavy weapons, I really can’t help it,” he said. “We are not using heavy weapons. When we say no, it means no. If we say we are doing something, we do it. We do exactly what we say, without confusion.”\n\nThe only remaining hospital in Mullivaikkal was attacked twice by the Sri Lankan military on the morning of the 2nd of May 2009, with at least 64 people killed and a further 87 injured. A US State Department report quoted a local source as stating the hospital was shelled twice, once at 9 a.m. and again at 10.30 a.m. The main outpatient department was hit as well as a bunker in the immediate vicinity to the hospital. Human Rights Watch later reported these attacks, noting that the second attack also resulted in dozens of casualties.\n\nThe OHCHR Investigation on Sri Lanka quoted a witness describing the scene:\n\n“There were many bodies everywhere and I could still smell the smoke from the shells hanging in the air. The smell of blood and the screaming from the injured was overwhelming. There were many women and children dead.”\n\nThe OHCHR Investigation on Sri Lanka (OISL) found that,\n\n“Witness testimonies and other documentation refer to many dying of starvation, exhaustion or lack of medical care in addition to those killed by shelling and shooting”.\n\n“It remains to be investigated how many people – particularly the most vulnerable such as the elderly and children – died as a result of lack of access to food and medical care.”\n\nThe OISL went on to state,\n\n“A senior United Nations official said they were amongst the worst cases of malnutrition he had ever seen”.\n\nDozens of people are reported to have died from starvation in the preceding weeks, particularly the elderly.\n\nThe US State Department says that,\n\nAn organization’s sources expressed their belief that the GSL was deliberately preventing delivery of medicine to the NFZ and reported that ―over the last week, at least 20 people have died due to starvation and lack of medication\n\nDeaths are occurring not just inside the No Fire Zone, but also at detention centres in Vavuniya, where on May 4th, ten elderly persons reportedly died.\n\nMore cluster bombs hit No Fire Zone\n\nThe Sri Lankan army launches cluster bombs inside the No Fire Zone, one of several such attacks in the last few months.\n\nIn the UN’s OISL report, witnesses “described the objects exploding in mid-air and releasing many smaller objects in the air before impacting the ground”.\n\n“Cluster munitions release bomblets over a wide area above a target that explode on impact. However, indirect fire munitions may also be configured to explode into fragments overhead. OISL believes that given the persistent nature of the allegations of cluster munitions, further investigation needs to be carried out to determine whether or not they were used.”\n\nThe LTTE released a letter from its Political Head Quarters, stating that it “reiterates its full commitment and support to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)”.\n\n“We also wish to reiterate our organisation’s total commitment to the safety and security of the members of the ICRC in carrying out its humanitarian work and its other mandated activities,” it added. “Please take this letter as the necessary security guarantees from the LTTE for performing the work of the ICRC.”\n\nMeanwhile the ICRC said that “heavy fighting is taking place near the medical assembly point at Mullavaikkal, which puts the lives of patients, medical workers and ICRC staff at great risk.”\n\n495 Tamils were evacuated from the final conflict zone by boat to Trincomalee and Pulmoddai.\n\nJacques de Maio, the ICRC head of operations for South Asia, in Geneva said, “not all the wounded could be evacuated today, and it is of the utmost importance that more evacuations take place over the coming days”.\n\n“The food and medical supplies that have been delivered remain insufficient to cover the basic needs of the people there.”\n\nThe US State Department reported said that “local sources in the NFZ reported that a supply ship had arrived but was forced by the GSL to return to Trincomalee with its cargo of food and medicine still on board. The sources reported that the SLN had refused to allow them to offload the cargo, and then began firing on the beach.”\n\n“An organization reported that shipments of food and medicine to the NFZ were grossly insufficient over the prior month and that the GSL reportedly delayed or denied timely shipment of life-saving medicines as well as chlorine tablets. A source in the NFZ reported that patients were brought to the hospital for fainting attacks attributed to their lack of food.”\n\n“Mothers were crying at the hospital and asking for milk powder. They had not eaten and were unable to feed their children, but the hospital did not have milk powder in stock.”\n\nThe Sri Lankan military stepped up its barrage of the No Fire Zone with heavy shelling reported, including with cluster munitions.\n\nThe US State Department quotes a HRW source in the NFZ who “witnessed an SLA drone conduct reconnaissance above the Valayanmadam hospital”.\n\n“Shortly thereafter the hospital was attacked, killing four or five people including a doctor and wounding more than 30. Several sources informed HRW that each time a hospital was established in a new location, GPS coordinates of the facility were transmitted to the Sri Lankan government to ensure that the facility would be protected from military attack. Witnesses said that on several occasions, attacks occurred on the day after the coordinates had been transmitted.”\n\nA group of independent United Nations experts today called on the Human Rights Council to urgently set up an international inquiry to address the “critical” situation in Sri Lanka.\n\n“There is good reason to believe that thousands of civilians have been killed in the past three months alone, and yet the Sri Lankan Government has yet to account for the casualties, or to provide access to the war zone for journalists and humanitarian monitors of any type”, said Philip Alston, the UN expert on summary executions.\n\nThe Sri Lankan military launched a barrage of heavy weapon fire in to the No Fire Zone as the last ICRC-chartered ferry that visits the conflict area leaves.\n\n“Fighting also made it impossible for the ferry to approach the shore on the previous day, 8 May,” said an ICRC press release.\n\n“The plight of the people remaining in the combat area is desperate, ” said ICRC’s head of delegation in Sri Lanka, Paul Castella.\n\n“We need unimpeded access to them in order to save lives. “\n\nAs many as 2,000 civilians were reportedly killed in a barrage of artillery fire by the Sri Lankan military throughout the day, reports TamilNet.\n\n“Dead bodies are found in bunkers and inside the tarpaulin tents,” TamilNet added. Rescue workers counted at least 1,200 bodies with fears that many more had been undiscovered.\n\nThe US State Department quoted a local source in the NFZ as reporting that “a congested civilian area was under heavy shell attack with many houses and vehicles burning”.\n\n“Many civilians’ temporary tarpaulin houses were struck by shells, and many hundreds of civilians were killed.”\n\n“A local source for an organization also reported heavy shelling with an estimated 1,000 killed and another estimated 1,000 injured. Embassy Colombo also reported that heavy shelling occurred in the NFZ, killing at least 300 civilians.”\n\n“More bodies were on the beaches and along road sides. The source said that heavy arms appeared to have been fired from government-controlled territory into a mainly civilian area under LTTE… The death toll is thought to be closer to 1,000; many of those killed would have been buried in the bunkers where they were slain, and many of the gravely wounded never made it to the hospital for treatment.”\n\nA leaked US embassy cable notes,\n\nThe Embassy has credible information that the Sri Lankan Air Force conducted an air strike south of the civilian safe zone yesterday afternoon, May 10…it violates President Rajapaksa’s April 27 commitment to cease all use of heavy weapons and aerial bombing.\n\nThe LTTE released a statement stating,\n\n“At this very moment (Sunday, May 10 2009), the Sri Lankan Government has unleashed its ferocious military aggression against the hapless Tamil civilians living in the so-called “Safe Zone” in Vanni, Sri Lanka. More than 2,000 innocent civilians have been killed in the last 24 hours. The wholesale bombardment by Sri Lankan planes and shelling on a densely populated, non combatant civilian safe zone is state terrorism and a war crime.”\n\n“The international community and UN have an obligation to protect the Tamil people facing genocidal aggression directed in a manner against all international humanitarian laws. It is clear that the Sri Lankan Government has prevented all aid agencies and humanitarian organisations from visiting the conflict zone. The Tamil people are dismayed that the United Nations and the International Community have failed in their obligations to protect the endangered civilians.”\n\n“Every passing day is resulting in the loss of countless number of civilian lives and alienation of the entire Tamil community.”\n\nIt’s not often that the most powerful man in the country rings you.\n\nI’d spoken amicably to defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa 45 minutes earlier about getting some better access to Sri Lanka’s 25-year war. But this time he was calling me, and seemed to have remembered something.\n\n“Who is this? You rang me earlier? Is this Channel 4? You have been accusing my soldiers of raping civilians? Your visa is cancelled, you will be deported. You can report what you like about this country, but from your own country, not from here.”\n\nI’m missing out my interjections, but that’s pretty much how you get deported in Sri Lanka. – Channel-4’s Nick Paton Walsh\n\nIndia’s Congress president Sonia Gandhi, is in Tamil Nadu where she says,\n\n“Our government had done everything possible to bring an end to the hostilities and it was due to our resolute efforts that Sri Lanka announced conclusion of combat operations and people moved to safer places”.\n\n“Our ultimate goal, as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had said and as has been the stand of the Congress in the last 30 years, is to secure for the Tamils equals rights and status within the framework of the 1987 Indo-Sri Lanka accord.”\n\nCatholic Priest Father Francis Joseph writes to the Pope from inside the No Fire Zone, calling on the Church to break its silence on the massacre of Tamils. The father, who was later detained by Sri Lankan security forces after passing through a military checkpoint in May 2009, has not been seen since. Extracts of his letter are below.\n\nLast night’s toll of the dead is 3318 and of the injured more than 4000. It was a barrage of artillery, mortar, multi-barrel shelling and cluster bombs…\n\nThe cries and woes of agony of babies and children, the women and the elderly fill the air that was polluted by poisonous and unhealthy gases…\n\nI deem it my duty to point my finger at the Church for its silence while some of the countries like USA, UK, France and some of the European Union countries and others, even the UN have voiced their dismay at the way the Sri Lankan Government is conducting a war to annihilate the Tamils…\n\nLet it be known that under the guise of eradicating terrorism, the Sri Lankan Government is waging the war to annihilate the Tamil nation. It is a genocidal war.\n\nThe UN spokesman at the time Gordon Weiss said the shelling over the weekend had caused a “bloodbath”, stating,\n\n“The U.N. has consistently warned against the bloodbath scenario as we’ve watched the steady increase in civilian deaths over the last few months… The large-scale killing of civilians over the weekend, including the deaths of more than 100 children, shows that that bloodbath has become a reality.”\n\nMeanwhile Sri Lanka’s Foreign Secretary, Palitha Kohona, said the government took “serious offence” at the remarks by Mr Weiss and had lodged a formal protest. “It is not the role of the UN office to say anything in public to embarrass the host government,” Mr Kohona said.\n\nThe then LTTE head of international relations Selvarasa Pathmanathan released a statement saying,\n\n“The recent developments in Vanni are very disturbing because they express so vividly a deliberate intention on the part of Sri Lanka and its partners in this war to subject an entire human community to life-endangering conditions of utmost cruelty.”\n\n“We are convinced that this pattern of conduct is a holocaust-in-the making and appeal to the governments of the world and to international public opinion to prevail upon the Sri Lankan Government so as to prevent these current genocidal tendencies from culminating in a collective tragedy.”\n\nSteve Crawshaw of Human Rights Watch commented,\n\n“If the Security Council stays silent on this issue any longer, it will be a failure of historic proportions… It is already late, but lives can still be saved”.\n\nA leaked US embassy cable highlights notes of the meeting, hosted by the UK and French Foreign Ministers with like-minded Security Council members. The UN Secretary-General and Council members discussed Sri Lanka during their monthly lunch, it adds.\n\n“The Foreign Ministers of the UK, France, Austria and Costa Rica, as well as the U.S. and Mexico all strongly supported SC action, with Russian FM Lavrov on the defensive. Lavrov said the situation in Sri Lanka is a humanitarian disaster, but not a threat to peace and security. He said other fora in the UN were better suited to address this issue. He added that there were plenty of similar instances when the Security Council did not act. China said that the Security Council’s informal meetings on Sri Lanka had made a difference.\n\nAmbassador Rice disagreed, and said the meetings had not yet made a difference; displaced persons were not receiving help, and the shelling continued despite government assurances to the contrary. On the margins of the meeting, the French said they intend to bring Sri Lanka to the Security Council this week, and would push for a product.”\n\nThen British Foreign Minister David Miliband said he was “appalled by the reports that have come out of Sri Lanka over the weekend of mass civilian casualties”, at a press conference at the Untied Nations in New York.\n\n“No-one can be in any doubt that this is an issue that deserves the international community’s attention,” he added, saying that “Our message is a simple one which is that the killing must stop”.\n\nHowever, Mr Miliband claimed that there were only “up to 50,000” people trapped in the final conflict zone. Later estimates revealed the actual number to be as many as three times that.\n\nHe went on to state,\n\n“As you know, the issue [Sri Lanka] has not yet been allowed onto the formal UN Security Council agenda. That’s why we will be having a range of meetings either side of today’s formal meeting on the Middle East.”\n\n“I believe very very strongly that the civilian situation in the North East of Sri Lanka merits the attention of the United Nations at all levels.”\n\nThe Tamil National Alliance held a press conference stating more than 3,000 civilians had been killed in the last 3 days alone and warned of further massacre.\n\nAll the TNA MPs in the country, with the exemption of one trapped inside the conflict zone, were present. TNA leader R Sampanthan said “there is genocide taking place in Vanni; the entire international community is being silent; we don’t want just statements of condemnations and pledges without any action; the killings of civilians must immediately be stopped; this is our urgent request”.\n\n“Latest reports emanating from the war zone and IDP camps indicate that the bodies, psyche and spirit of the innocent Tamils in Sri Lanka have been shattered. In the name of war on terror, the Sri Lankan government and its military are engaged in genocide.”\n\n“We urgently call upon the International Community, the United Nations and World Leaders to assert their moral right to get actively involved in Sri Lankan Tamil conflict, even without leave from the Security Council, if it is the only way to stop the dire suffering of the Tamil People. Every passing day is resulting in the loss of countless number of civilian lives and alienation of the entire Tamil community. We seek your urgent and immediate intervention, not based on territorial or geo-political ambitions, but based on basic human values.”\n\nMore than 100 civilians, including children, medical staff, a voluntary doctor and an Red Cross worker, were killed in Sri Lankan artillery attack that targeted a makeshift hospital for the second time in 24 hours. See more from TamilNet here.\n\nThe ICRC confirmed that one its employees, identified as Sivakurunathan Majuran, was killed alongside his mother in the shelling. The organisation confirmed the hospital had been “hit by shell fire for a third time”.\n\nIn another incident of shelling, at least 39 female patients were also killed at a counselling aid centre for mentally ill women located in the final conflict zone.\n\nCharge pressed Government officials to permit UN\n\naccess to the conflict zone as soon as possible, and to facilitate a\n\nvisit this month by UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon. At least\n\n1,200 civilians escaped on May 14, and perhaps thousands of others are following, according to military sources. The ICRC has not been able to offload food from or evacuate patients to boats waiting offshore from the conflict zone since May 9 despite daily attempts to seek security assurances as boats wait offshore. Both the LTTE and the Government noted appreciation for President Obama’s May 13 public statement on Sri Lanka. President Rajapaksa established a Task Force to attend to IDP returns, rehabilitation, and development of the North within the next year.\n\nThe OISL says the LTTE gave orders on this day to ensure civilians fleeing the conflict zone would not be stopped.\n\n“From 14 May, tens of thousands civilians heeded the calls of SLA soldiers with megaphones and slowly walked along the A35 road lined with SLA positions towards the Vadduvakal bridge, which was one of the main crossing points. Most surviving LTTE fighters had discarded their uniforms, laid down weapons and other military equipment and donned civilian dress. Along with other LTTE political cadres, they walked amongst the crowds with their families.”\n\nAn ICRC ship approached, but had to turn back “due to the intensity of the fighting” reports the UN Panel of Experts report on Sri Lanka.\n\n“Unless an external humanitarian intervention is carried out without delay, it would be difficult to avert an inhuman catastrophe,” said a volunteer doctor. “The ICRC has abandoned its missions, there is no food, no proper access to potable water to tens of thousands of civilians who are forced to stay under the bunkers, surrounded by dead bodies and wounded civilians who are dying without medical help.”\n\nAs Tamil civilians attempted to surrender to the oncoming Sri Lankan military, many were slaughtered.\n\nThe US State department quoted an organization’s local sources as reporting,\n\n“that they attempted to escape the NFZ with a large group of children, coming out with white flags. The SLA started shooting at them and told them to go back to their bunkers.”\n\n“The sources reportedly saw soldiers throw grenades into two bunkers, and saw tanks going over bunkers and destroying everything inside.”\n\nAll government doctors and senior health officials have crossed Sri Lankan military lines.\n\nThe US State Department reports,\n\n“… in the final weeks of the conflict, doctors in the Mullivaikkal hospital had to operate with butchers’ knives and watered-down anesthetics due to the shortage of medical supplies.”\n\n“With replacement blood running out, staff filtered what they could from the patients through a cloth before feeding it back into their veins.”\n\nTamilNet reports that between 2,000 and 3,000 bodies litter the remaining No Fire Zone. The doctors were detained and interrogated for several months by the Sri Lankan military.\n\nOver 3,000 people have been killed over the last 24 hours, with another 25,000 critically injured.\n\nThe Commander of the LTTE’s Sea Tigers Colonel Soosai sends out a message to journalists from Mullivaikkal. As he speaks, artillery shells can be heard landing in the background. “The last hours are happening, the last hours are happening… a lot of people are dying, heavy fighting is going on. A lot of people are dying… in all areas, corpses are heaping up… the people are not being allowed to leave”.\n\nThe LTTE’s then head of International Diplomatic Relations issued a statement. Extracts below.\n\n“Despite our plea to the world to save the thousands of people in Vanni from the clutches of death, the silence of the international community has only encouraged the Sri Lankan military to execute the war to its bitter end. In the past 24 hours, over 3000 civilians lie dead on the streets while another 25,000 are critically injured with no medical attention. To save the lives of our people is the need of the hour.”\n\nSri Lanka’s Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapksa announced publicly on May 17 that there were no civilians remaining in the conflict zone.\n\nHowever, a leaked US embassy cable reveals the Americans were told by current TNPF leader Gajen Ponnambalam and the Bishop of Mannar that a reported “tens of thousands” remain trapped.\n\nAccording to the cable,\n\n“The Bishop of Mannar… estimated that there were 60,000 to 75,000 civilian left in the zone.”\n\n“Ponnambalam estimated that there could still be as many as 100,000 civilians.”\n\nBasil Rajapaksa is informed by a TNA parliamentarian in touch with the LTTE that there are 3,000 cadres (including the political wing) and 22,000 civilians who wanted to surrender as soon as possible.\n\nA leaked US Embassy cable says,\n\nAmbassador spoke to Gothabaya Rajapaksa on the morning of May 17 to urge him to allow the ICRC into the conflict zone to mediate a surrender.\n\nRajapaksa commented, “We’re beyond that now”.\n\nThe Sri Lankan military overruns the last remaining ‘No Fire Zone’.\n\nTamilNet receives a final phone call before it loses all communication with its correspondents in the field.\n\nA US State Department report says there are “accounts from witnesses in the NFZ of SLA soldiers throwing grenades into several civilian bunkers”.\n\n“Some civilians also reported seeing an army truck running over injured people lying on the road. Later in the day, the SLA brought in earth-moving equipment to bury the bodies that had been lying outside for two days or more. Civilians reported seeing among the corpses injured people who were asking for help, and believed that the SLA did not always attempt to separate the injured and the dying from those who had died.”\n\nThe OISL says,\n\n“Multiple witnesses described scenes of devastation, with hundreds of bodies of people killed by shelling scattered across areas within the NFZs. Entire families had been killed as bombs landed in bunkers they were sheltering in. Witnesses talked of having to leave dead family members behind as they were further displaced by the shelling. Many witnesses were profoundly traumatized by their experiences and memories of the shelling and the devastation they witnessed.”\n\nHundreds of other LTTE cadres, their families and other Tamils civilians who surrendered to the Sri Lankan military were executed. Others have been forcibly disappeared.\n\nThe ITJP released the names of at least 293 people who were seen surrendering to the Sri Lankan military and have seen been disappeared. Among those is Father Joseph, who was last seen boarding a Sri Lankan military bus with several LTTE cadres whose surrender he had facilitated.\n\nOISL concludes that there are reasonable grounds to believe that LTTE senior political wing leaders Balasingham Nadesan and Seevaratnam Puleedevan as well as Nadesan’s wife Vineetha Nadesan may have been executed by the security forces sometime after 06:00 on 18 May.”\n\nAmongst the other emblematic cases are those of LTTE leader Colonel Ramesh who was filmed in Sri Lankan custody, being interrogated by soldiers. Later photographs show he was shot dead. Balachandran Prabhakaran, the 12-year-old son of the LTTE leader Veluppillai Prabhakaran, was also photographed in military custody and then shot dead, as well as Tamil TV presenter Isaipriya.\n\nThe UN Panel of Experts found,\n\n“Rape and sexual violence against Tamil women during the final stages of the armed conflict and, in its aftermath, are greatly under-reported… Nonetheless, there are many indirect accounts reported by women of sexual violence and rape by members of Government forces and their Tamil-surrogate forces, during and in the aftermath of the final phases of the armed conflict.”\n\n“Many photos and video footage, in particular the footage provided by Channel 4, depict dead female cadre. In these, women are repeatedly shown naked or with underwear withdrawn to expose breasts and genitalia. The Channel 4 images, with accompanying commentary in Sinhala by SLA soldiers, raise a strong inference that rape or sexual violence may have occurred, either prior to or after execution.”\n\nThe OISL says it is “concerned by serious allegations that SLA may have destroyed evidence after the end of the conflict, including by digging up and burning bodies that had been buried in the conflict zone”. “In addition to those who died in hospitals, multiple witness testimonies recount burying civilian family members or seeing others bury individuals killed in the shelling before they hurriedly fled. There has been no systematic recording of the exhumation of graves since the war. Extensive forensic anthropological expertise will be required to examine those bodies that were buried and may be exhumed as part of investigations. “"
