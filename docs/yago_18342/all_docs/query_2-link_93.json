        "text": "an enlightening experiance for Tamils of the eelam school of thought.\n\nDRAVIDIAN SETTLEMENTS IN CEYLON AND THE\n\nBEGINNINGS OF THE KINGDOM OF JAFFNA\n\nExcerpts from Karthigesu Indrapala’s Phd thesis, University of London\n\n1965. Karthigesu Indrapala was the former professor of history at the\n\nUniversity of Ceylon, Jaffna campus.\n\nUntil the ninth century, with the exception of the megalithic remains of\n\nPomparippu and the possible exception of those of Katiraveli, there is no\n\ndefinite evidence regarding any Dravidian settlement in the island. (page\n\n51)\n\nNo definite evidence regarding any significant Tamil settlement in the\n\nBatticaloa district of the Eastern Province, which is now a predominantly\n\nTamil area, or in other parts of Southern Ceylon has so far come to\n\nlight. It is possible that there were some Tamil settlers in the\n\nBatticaloa district for, from the thirteenth century onwards, we get\n\narchaeological, epigraphic and literary evidence pointing to Tamil\n\nsettlements in the area. (page 233)\n\nIt may be recollected that several writers on the history of Jaffna,\n\nbasing their studies on the traditional legends found in the late Tamil\n\nchronicles, have put forward certain theories claiming the establishment\n\nof Tamil settlements in Jaffna in the period of the Anuradhapura rulers.\n\nThese theories are not accepted by serious students of history as they\n\nare not based on trustworthy data. Many of these have been convincingly\n\ndismissed by scholars in recent years. It is therefore, not our intention\n\nto analyse these theories and take serious notice of writings which at\n\nbest could be described as popular. (page 266)\n\nJaffna peninsula does not help us to know anything about the identity of\n\nthe people who lived there in the pre-christian centuries. The Pali\n\nchronicle informs us that the port of Jambukola (Camputturai), on the\n\neastern coast of the peninsula, was the main port of embakation to\n\nTamralipti in Eastern India from at least the time of Devanampiya Tissa (\n\n250-210 B.C.). The two embassies from the island to the court of Asoka\n\nembarked on their vayage from Jambukola. Sangamitta arrived with the\n\nBo-sapling at this port. The Samudda-panna-sala, commemorating the\n\narrival of the Bo sapling, and the Jambukola Vihara were built there by\n\nDevanampiya Tissa. These facts only reveal that the northern most part of\n\nthe island was under the suzerainty of the Anuradhapura king in the third\n\ncentury B.C. and that Buddhism had begun to spread by that time in that\n\npart of the island as in the other parts. But it is in the second century\n\nAD that we get some evidence regarding the people living there. The\n\nlanguage of the gold plate inscription from Vallipuram, the earliest\n\nepigraphic record discovered in the Jaffna peninsula, is the early form\n\nof Sinhalese, in which inscriptions of the time in other parts of the\n\nisland were written. This may suggest that the Sinhalese were settled in\n\nthe Jaffna peninsula, or in some parts at least, in the secound century\n\nA.D. There were perhaps Tamil traders in the port of Jambukola but there\n\nis no evidence that points to Tamil settlements in the peninsula. (page\n\n268)\n\nThe gold plate from Vallipuram reveals that there were buddhists in that\n\npart of the peninsula in the second century A.D. At the site of this\n\ninscription the foundations of a buddhist vihara were uncovered. These\n\nfoundations are in the premises of a modern Visnu temple. There is little\n\ndoubt that the Visnu temple was the original Buddhist monument converted\n\nin to a Vaisnava establishment at a later date when Tamils settled in the\n\narea. Such conversion of Buddhist establishments into Saiva and Vaisnava\n\ntemples seems to have been a common phenomenon in the peninsula after it\n\nwas settled by Dravidians. In the premises of another Visnu temple at\n\nMoolai were discovered some ‘vestiges of ancient remains of walls’ and a\n\nbroken sedent Buddha image. Again in a Saiva temple at mahiyapitti a\n\nBuddha image was found under a stone step in the temple tank. A\n\nlime-stone Buddha image and the remains of an ancient dagaba were\n\nunearthed at Nilavarai, in Navakiri. Among the debris were two sculptured\n\nfragments of shaped coral stones with a stone railing design. According\n\nto D.T.Devendra, who conducted the excavation at this site, the dagaba\n\ncan be dated at least to the tenth century A.D. Near these ruins are the\n\nfoundations of an ancient building and in the middle of these is a modern\n\nSiva temple.It has been conjectured, and rightly so, that the old\n\nfoundations are those of the vihara attached to the ancient dagaba.\n\nBuddha images have also been discovered in Uduvil, Kantarodai andJaffna\n\ntown. Kantarodai has yielded very important Buddhist finds which prove\n\nthe existance of an important Buddhist establishment in the region in\n\nearly times. Such artifacts as the glazed tiles and the circular discs\n\ndiscovered here have helped to connect the finds with those of\n\nAnuradhapura. The Sinhala Nampota, dated in its present form to the\n\nfourteenth or fifteenth century, preserves the names of some of the\n\nplaces of Buddhist worship in the Jaffna peninsula.Kantaradai is\n\nmentioned among these places. The others are Nagakovila (Nakarkovil),\n\nTelipola (Tellippalai), Mallagama (Mallakam), Minuvangomu Viharaya\n\n(Vimankamam), Tannidivayina(Tana-tivu or Kayts), Nagadivayina (Nakativu\n\nor Nayinativu), Puvangudivayina (Punkutu-tivu) and Karadivayina\n\n(Karaitivu). Of the Buddhist establishments in these places only the\n\nvihara and Dagaba at Nakativu has survived to this day. It is justifiable\n\nto assume that the Nampota list dates back to a time when the Buddhist\n\nestablishments of these places were well known centres of worship. This\n\nwas probably before the thirteenth century, for after this date the\n\npeople of the Jaffna peninsula were mainly Saivas. The foregoing evidence\n\npoints to the inevitable conclusion that in the Anuradhapura period, and\n\npossibly till about the twelfth century, there were Buddhists in the\n\njaffna peninsula.Although it may appear reasonable to presume that these\n\nbuddhists were Sinhalese like those in other parts of the island, some\n\nhave tried to argue that they were Tamils. While it is true that there\n\nwere Tamil Buddhists in South India and Ceylon before the twelfth century\n\nand possibly even later, there is evidence to show that the Buddhists who\n\noccupied the Jaffna peninsula in the Anuradhapura period were Sinhalese.\n\nWe refer to the toponymic evidence which unmistakably points to the\n\npresence of Sinhala settlers in the peninsula before Tamils settled\n\nthere. In an area of only about nine hundred square miles covered by this\n\npeninsula, there occur over a thousand Sinhalese place names which have\n\nsurvived in a Tamil garb. (page 270-273)\n\nThe Yalppana-vaipava-malai, the Tamil chronicle of Jaffna, confirms this\n\nwhen it states that there were Sinhalese people in Jaffna at the time of\n\nthe first tamil colonisation of the area. Secondly, the survival of\n\nSinhalese elements in the local nomenclature indicates a slow and\n\npeaceful penetration of Tamils in the area rather than violent\n\noccupation. This is in contrast with the evidence of the place names of\n\nthe North Central Province, where Sinhalese names have been largely\n\nreplaced by tamil names. The large percentage of Sinhalese element and\n\nthe occurrance of Sinhala and Tamil compounds in the place names of\n\nJaffna point to a long survival of the Sinhala population and an intimate\n\nintercourse between them and the Tamils. This is also, borne out by the\n\nretention of some territorial names, like Valikamam ( Sinh. Valigama) and\n\nMaracci (Maracci-rata), which points to the retention of the old\n\nterritorial devisions and tell strongly against wholesale extermination\n\nor displacement of the Sinhalese population.. (page 276)\n\nThe earliest evidence regarding the presence of Tamils in the Jaffna\n\npeninsula is possibly the Tamil inscription of Parakrama bahu I\n\n(1153-1186) from Nainativu. We have seen earlier that till about the\n\nninth century our evidence points to minor settlements of Tamils in such\n\nimportant ports as Mahatittha (Mannar) and Gakanna (Trincomalee) as well\n\nas in Anuradhapura, where there was a considerable number of mercenary\n\nsoldiers. In the ninth and tenth centuries some villages in Rajarattha\n\nseem to have accomodated Tamil settlers but these were by no means\n\nnumerous.It seems unlikely that there were many Tamil settlers in the\n\nJaffna peninsula or in any part of the island other than the major ports\n\nand the capital city before the tenth century. As we stated earlier,\n\nthere were perhaps some Tamil traders in the ports of Jambukola and\n\nUratota, in the Jaffna peninsula. But we have no evidence on this point..\n\n(page 282)\n\nThe Sanskrit inscription from Trincomalee, discovered among the ruins of\n\nthe Konesvaram temple, refers to a personage named Cadaganga who went to\n\nCeylon in 1223. Paranavitana has identified this person with Kulakkottan.\n\nThe inscription is fragmentary and is engraved on a part of a stone door\n\njamb. Among thedecipherable words is the name Gokarna, the ancient name\n\nof Trincomalee and the root from which the name of the temple is derived\n\n(Gokarnesvara). (page 331)\n\nIn the Tamil Vanni districts only a few Dravidian style saiva temples of\n\nthe thirteenth century have been found, Among these the temples at\n\nTirukkovil, Kpuralla, and nallatanni-irakkam and the Saiva remains at\n\nUruttirapuram and Kuruntanur are notable. These certainly indicate the\n\nexistance of Tamil settlements in those places in the thirteenth century.\n\nBut monumental remains of a different type attest to the destruction\n\nwrought by the invaders and the conversion of Buddhist institutions into\n\nplaces of saiva worship, effected by the new settlers, thus confirming\n\nthe statements in the Sinhala sources. The manny scattered ruins of\n\nBuddhist monasteries and temples all over the vanni region preserve the\n\nmemory of the Sinhalese Buddhist settlements that once covered these\n\nparts. Several of the pilimages (image houses) attached to the\n\nmonasteries in places like Kovilkadu, Malikai, Omantai,\n\nKanakarayan-kulam, Iracentiran-kulam, Cinnappuvaracankulam and Madukanda\n\nwere converted into Saiva temples, often dedicated to Ganesa. Buddha\n\nimages or inscribed slabs from the Buddhist structures were used to\n\nmakethe Ganesa statues.(J.P.Lewis, Manual of the Vanni Districts, pp\n\n.297, 303-306, 311) A number of small Saiva shrines have been found in\n\nassociation with Buddhist remains. The destruction of several of the\n\nBuddhist edifices and the conversion of pilimages into Saiva temples may\n\nhave begun at the time of Magha. In the North Central Province, too , we\n\nfind evidence of such activities. On Minneriya Road, close to\n\nPolonnaruwa, were discovered a few Saiva edifices which were built of\n\nmaterials from Buddhist structures. A door jamb from one of the Saiva\n\nshrines there was found to bear part of an inscription of Parakramabahu\n\nI. A broken pillar shaft with Sinhalese wrting of the tenth century was\n\nrecovered from the enclosing wall of another shrine. In one of the Visnu\n\ntemples of Polonnaruwa, fragments of Nissanka malla’s stone inscriptions\n\nwere found. In the same place, two fragments of a broken pillar with\n\nSinhalese writing of about the tenth century served as steps to one of\n\nthe Vaisnava shrines. A pillar in the mandapa of Siva Devale No.5 at\n\nPolonnaruwa was discovered with a Sinhala inscription of the eleventh\n\ncentury on it. In Siva Devale No.7 a square stone asana with an\n\ninscription of Nissanka malla was used as a base for a linga. Another of\n\nthe Saiva shrines unearthed at Polonnaruwa yielded a pillar with a\n\nSinhalese inscription of Jayabahu I. These examples leave us in no doubt\n\nthat materials from Buddhist structures were used in the building of\n\nSaiva and Vaisnava temples. The date of most inscriptions found on the\n\npillars and slabs is the twelfth century. The date of the construction of\n\nthese Saiva and Vaisnava shrines is certainly later than that. (page\n\n361-364)\n\nThe invasion of Magha with the help of Kerela and Tamil merceneries was\n\nfar more violent than the earlier invasions. Its chief importance lies in\n\nthe fact that it led to the permanent dislodgement of Sinhalese power\n\nfrom northern Ceylon, the confiscation by Tamils and Keralas of lands\n\nandproperties belonging to the Sinhalese and the consequent migration of\n\nthe official class and many of the common people to the south western\n\nregions. (page 395-396)\n\nUmberto Gui (nm...@dial.pipex.com) wrote:\n\nA SHORT HISTORY OF THE TAMIL EELAM LIBERATION\n\nSTRUGGLE\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nSri Lanka formerly called Ceylon in English and known in Tamil\n\nas ILANKAI or EELAM is an island situated at the southern extremity\n\nof the Indian subcontinent, separated from it at its narrowest\n\npoint by only 22 miles of sea called Palk Strait. It lies between\n\nsix and ten degrees north of the Equator, and on the longitude of\n\n79 to 81 degrees east. Its area is 25,332 square miles comprising\n\nSri Lanka 18,042 and Tamil Eelam 7,290 sq miles. The total\n\npopulation is 17,103,000, according to latest population\n\nstatistics (1991), consisting of 12,656,000 Sinhalese, 3,113,000\n\nTamils, Muslims (mostly Tamil speaking) 1,214,000 and others\n\n120,000.\n\nTHE EARLY TAMILS\n\nThe Tamils are an ancient people with a history dating back to\n\natleast 2,500 years. The Tamil language, the lingua franco of the\n\nTamils, is one of the five oldest living languages of the world.\n\nThe Tamil classical literature, popularly called the Sangam\n\n(Academy) literature (1st -4th Century AD) is a collection of poems\n\nof lasting quality and artistic merit. They reflect faithfully the\n\nhigh level of civilization and literary attainments of the ancient\n\nTamils.\n\nTHE EARLY SINHALESE\n\nThe Sinhala people trace their origins in the island to the\n\narrival of Prince Vijaya from Bengal in India, about 2500 years\n\nago. The Mahavamsa, a Sinhala chronicle written by a Buddhist\n\nBhikku by the name of Mahanama, (6th Century AD) records that\n\nPrince Vijaya arrived on the island on the same day that the Buddha\n\nattained enlightenment.\n\nWHO CAME FIRST\n\nAlthough attempts are made to trace the history of Ceylon\n\nbefore the arrival of Vijaya (about 500 BC), who is credited as the\n\nfounder of the present Sinhalese race, there is sufficient\n\nhistorical and archaeological evidence to prove the existence of a\n\nhigh level of civilization before him. The proto history of Ceylon\n\ncould be traced back to atleast 5000 years to the period of Raman\n\nof the epic Ramayanam. Raman (the same Raman about whose temple\n\nthere is violent dispute between the Hindus and Muslims in Uttar\n\nPradesh India at present) who was an Aryan king from north India\n\nfought against the Tamil Yaksha king of Ilankai (Ceylon) Ravanan\n\nwho had abducted Rama's wife Seethai. Jawaharlal Nehru in his book\n\nGlimpses of World History describes the war between Raman and\n\nRavanan as a war between the Aryans and Dravidians.\n\nTherefore, the oft-repeated question as to who came first, the\n\nTamils or the Sinhalese, is a controversial subject emotively\n\ndebated by both the parties, but the following observation by the\n\neminent Sinhala historian and Cambridge scholar, Paul Peiris\n\nrepresent an influential and common sese point of view:\n\n\" ... it stands to reason that a country which was only thirty\n\nmiles from India and which would have been seen by Indian fisherman\n\nevery morning as they sailed out to catch their fish, would have\n\nbeen occupied as soon as the continent was peopled by men who\n\nunderstood how to sail ..... Long before the arrival of Prince\n\nVijaya, there were in Sri Lanka five recognised isvarams of Siva\n\nwhich claimed and received adoration of all India. These were\n\nTiruketeeswaram near Mahatitha; Munneeswaram dominating Salawatta\n\nand the pearl fishery; Tondeswaram near Mantota; Tirkoneswaram\n\nnear the great bay of Kottiyar and Nakuleswaram near\n\nKankesanthurai. Their situation close to these ports cannot be the\n\nresult of accident or caprice and was probably determined by the\n\nconcourse of a wealthy mercantile population whose religious wants\n\ncalled for attention ....\" (Paul E. Pieris: Nagadipa and Buddhist\n\nRemains in Jaffna: Journal of Royal Asiatic Society, Ceylon Branch\n\nVol.28)\n\nEARLY POLITICAL HISTORY\n\nThe early political history of the people of South India and\n\nSri Lanka, before the advent of the European powers, is largely a\n\nchronicle of the rise and fall of individdual kingdoms. South India\n\nwas ruled mostly by the three great Kings Cholas, Seras an\n\nPandiyas. Sometimes they faught against the invaders and some times\n\nthey warred against each other. In addition to these three great\n\nkings there were also petty kings who ruled over large tracts of\n\nland, nominally independant, but paying tribute to one or more of\n\nthe three Kings. Among the three kings the Cholas were easily the\n\nmost powereful and the only naval power in India. The army of Raja\n\nRaja the Great (984-1014) invaded Ceylon, made Rajarata a part of\n\nthe Chola empire, and founded Polonnaruwa as the capital city.\n\nRarajah's sone Rajendra (1014 - 1044) further extended the\n\nChola empire, so that in the 11th century the mighty Cholas ruledd\n\nover Ceylon, Kampuchea, Malaya and greater part of Indonesia.\n\nThe society was fuedal in structure and alnd was the most\n\ndominat means of production. The Sangam literature provides\n\nevidence of the lucrative two-way trade these kingdoms had with far\n\naway Roman and Greek empires.\n\nINDEPENANCE IN 1948\n\nSri Lanka attained its independence from British colonial\n\nrule in February 04,1948. The first parliamentary elections were\n\nheld in 1947 under the Soulbury constitution. The total members of\n\nparliament was 96 with an additional 6 appointed members\n\nrepresenting minority communities. Mr.D.S.Senanayake, the leader of\n\nthe United National Party (formerly Ceylon National Congress),\n\nformed the government. He became the first Prime Minister of an\n\nindependent Ceylon.\n\nTHE KINGDOMS\n\nCeylon had been ruled by both Tamil and Sinhalese kings, the\n\nTamil Kingdom comprising the north and eastern parts and the\n\nSinhalese Kingdom(s) the western & southern parts of Ceylon. There\n\nwere brief periods when the whole of Ceylon came under a single\n\nruler. Otherwise, there existed two or more Kingdoms and the\n\nTamil Kingdom always one of them. The Tamil Kingdom, later came to\n\nbe called the Jaffna Kingdom existed as a separate polity for\n\ncenturies. The first war between a Tamil King who ruled\n\nAnuradhapura and a Sinhalese king from the south was fought in the\n\n2nd century BC.\n\nIn 1505 when the Portuguese landed in Ceylon there was not one\n\nbut three Kingdoms, the Jaffna Kingdom in the north & east, the\n\nKotte Kingdom in the west and Kandyan Kingdom in the centre.\n\nThe Jaffna Kingdom was captured by the Portuguese when the king\n\nof Jaffna was defeated in June,1619. He was captured and taken by\n\nthe Portuguese to Goa where he was hanged. The Portuguese ruled\n\nJaffna Kingdom from 1619 to 1658. The Dutch who captured the\n\nKingdom from the Portuguese ruled till 1795 and the British till\n\nFebruary 03,1948.\n\nThe Jaffna Kingdom was ruled as a separate polity both by the\n\nPortuguese and the Dutch. The boundaries of the Jaffna Kingdom was\n\nkept intact. The customary laws of the Tamils (Thesavalamai) was\n\nused along with Roman-Dutch law. It was in 1933 the British King\n\nWilliam IV under a charter following the recommendations of the\n\nColebrook Commission amalgamated north and east with the rest of\n\nCeylon for administrative convenience.\n\nThe two nations, the Tamil and Sinhalese, existed separately\n\nin well defined territory could be seen from the following minute\n\nby the British Governor Cleghorn -\n\n\"Two different nations, from a very ancient period have\n\ndivided between them in possession of the Island(Ceylon). First the\n\nCinhalese, in habiting the interior of the country in its southern\n\nand western parts from the river Wallouve to that of Chilow, and\n\nsecondly the Malabars (Tamils_ who possess the northern and eastern\n\ndistricts. These two nations differ entirely in their religions,\n\nlanguage and culture ...\"(emphasis ours).\n\nDEMAND FOR BALANCED REPRESENTATION\n\nBefore independence although the Tamils did not demand the\n\nrestoration of the National status ante, they did demand balanced\n\nrepresentation. This demand came to be known as 50-50 envisaged\n\nallocating 50% of the parliamentary seats to the Sinhalese and the\n\nbalance 50% to the Tamils, Muslims, Burgers and other minority\n\ngroups. This was rejected by the Soulbury Commission, but they did\n\nincorporate Section 29 (2) (b) and (c) which curtailed the\n\nlegislative power of Parliament to \"make laws for the peace, order\n\nand good government of the island\". This Section provided that no\n\nsuch law shall impose any disabilities, or confer any advantages,\n\non members of any one community only.\n\nTAMILS LOSE CITIZENSHIP AND FRANCHISE\n\nBefore the ink could dry on the new constitution the Ceylon\n\nparliament passed the Ceylon Citizenship Act No.18 of 1948 which\n\ndeprived a million Tamils of Indian origin their citizenship.\n\nThis was followed up with the Ceylon (Parliamentary Elections)\n\nAmendment Act No.48 of 1949 which deprived the Tamils of their\n\nfranchise as well. This category of Tamils who had 7 seats in the\n\nParliament and held balance of power in a further 20-30 electorates\n\nfailed to elect even a single member in the elections to the\n\nparliament held in 1953.\n\nTHE RISE OF SINHALA-BUDDHIST NATIONALISM\n\nThe deprivation of citizenship of a million Tamils was the\n\nresult of actions of a Sinhala -Buddhist majority which regarded\n\nthe island as the exclusive home of Sinhala Buddism and the Tamils\n\nas invaders from Tamil Nadu in South India.\n\n\" The history of Sri Lanka is the history of the Sinhalese\n\nrace ... The Sinhalese people were entrusted 2500 years ago, with\n\na great and nobel charge, the preservation .... of Buddhism .. in\n\n1956 will occur the unique three fold event - the completion of\n\n2500 years of Ceylon's history, of the tie of the Sinhalese and\n\nBuddhism ... The birth of the Sinhalese race would thus seem to\n\ngave been not a mere chance, not an accidental occurrence, but a\n\npredetermined event of high import and purpose. The nation semed\n\ndesigned, as it were, from its rise, primarily to carry aloft for\n\nfifty centuries the torch that was lit by the grear World-Mentor\n\n(the Buddha) twenty five centuries ago.. \" (The revolt in the\n\nTemple, by D.C VIjayawardena, 1953).\n\nThis is just one example of what has become the battle cry of\n\nthe Sinhala-Buddhists sole and exclusive claim to the whole of\n\nCeylon. Before him the great Buddhist revivalist Anagarika\n\nDharmapala (1864-1931), whose earlier name was Don David\n\nHewavitarne took the name of Anagarika (in Pali meaning \"the\n\nhomeless one\") and Dharmapala ( meaning \"the guardian of the\n\ndoctrine\") in his book History of an Ancient Civilization (1902)\n\nwrote:\n\nEthnologically, the Sinhalese are a unique race, inasmuch as\n\nthey can boast that they have no slave blood in them, and were\n\nnever conququered by either the paga Tamils or European vanadals\n\nwho for three centuries devastated the land, destroyed ancient\n\ntemples, burnt valuable libraries, and nearly annihilated the\n\nhistoric race .... This bright, bueautiful island was made into a\n\nparadise by the Aryan Sinhalese before its destruction was brought\n\nabout by the barbaric vandals .... For the students of ethnology\n\nthe Sinhalese stand as the representatives of Aryan civilization\n\n...\n\nThis potent mixture of legend and superstition, passe off as\n\nhistorical fact, was nurtured, refined and exploited by successive\n\nSinhalese political leaders who sought to perpetuate their rule\n\nover the Tamils.\n\nTHE SINHALA ONLY ACT OF 1956\n\nAs predicted with remarkable foresight by S.J.V.Celvanayagm in\n\nParliament during the debate on Citizenship Bill ( 1948) the next\n\nblow was dealt to the Tamils when the Sri Lanka Freedom Party\n\nGovernment of Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranayake enacted Sinhala\n\nOnly as the Official Language in June 1956. The enactment of this\n\nAct, quite contrary to the hitherto official policy of recognising\n\nboth Sinhalese and Tamil as Official languages, made Tamils second\n\nclass citizens in their country of birth overnight.\n\nIt was undoubtedly a betrayal of the two language policy of\n\nconsidering both Tamil and Sinhalese as official languages.\n\nPolitically it was a master stroke by the majority Sinhalese to\n\ndeprive jobs in the government and state corporations. The Tamils\n\nwere humiliated to a degree that left generations of Tamils to\n\nfeel socially as outcasts and politically second class citizens.\n\nPhillip Gunawardene, a Minister in Bandareanayake's government\n\nand a vocivorous champion of Sinhal Only told Parliament:\n\n\"We are completeting by this (Sinhala Only) Bill an important\n\nphase in our national struggle. The restoration of the Sinhala\n\nlanguage to the position it occupied before the occupation of this\n\ncountry by foreign powers, marks an important stage in the history\n\nof the development of this island\" (Hansard, 14th June 1956)\n\nThe peaceful Satyragraha by the Tamils to protest against the\n\nSinhala Only language policy at Galle Face Green overlooking the\n\nParliament in Colombo was broken up by Sinhalese hoodlums. This was\n\nfollowed by Island wide riots in which hundreds of Tamils lost\n\ntheir lives and property worth millions destroyed. The 1956 riots\n\nwas the beginning of a series of racially motivated Tamil pogroms\n\nby Sinhalese covertly encouraged by successive governments and\n\novertly supported by the security forces. These pogroms with\n\nincreased ferocity and venom were repeated in 1958, 1961, 1977,\n\n1979, 1981 and 1983.\n\nIn July 1957 Mr.S.W.R.D.Bandaranayake signed a pact with\n\nMr.S.J.V.Chelvanayagam, popularly called the Bandaranayake-\n\nChelvanayagam pact, of the Tamil Federal Party giving a measure of\n\nregional autonomy in spheres of land, language, education, etc. But\n\nthe pact was torn apart by Mr.Bandaranayake under pressure from\n\nSinhalese-Buddhist chauvinists. Foremost among them was no other\n\nthan Mr.J.R.Jayawardena of the United National Party who undertook\n\na march to Kandy in protest. A similar Pact signed by\n\nMr.Chelvanayagam with Mr.Dudley Senanayake in 1965 too met the same\n\nfate.\n\nA non-violent Satyragraha campaign launched by the Tamil\n\nFederal party in the northern eastern provinces which paralysed\n\ncivil administration was ruthlessly broken-up using the army. This\n\narmy is dominated by the Sinhalese (99%) and continued to be used\n\nas an instrument of state terrorism to this very day. The entire\n\nsecurity forces now number over 100,000 and heavily armed with\n\nmodern military hardware, fighter bombers, helicopter gun-\n\nships,tanks, armoured vehicles, naval patrol boats etc. The\n\ngovernment of Sri Lanka is currently spending upto 20% of the\n\nstate budget to maintain it.\n\nIn 1970 the government of Mrs.Srimawo Bandaranayake (widow of\n\nMr.S.W.R.D.Bandaranayake) rubbed salt into wounds by introducing\n\nthe notorious \"Standardisation\" of education. This discriminate\n\npolicy required higher marks from Tamil students for University\n\nadmissions vis-a-vis the Sinhalese students. The combination of\n\nSinhala Only and Standardization in education acted as a lethal\n\ndose of racism on the polity. These discriminatory laws first\n\nsqueezed and then shut Tamils from employment opportunities in\n\ngovernment and Tamil students from University admissions. These\n\nracial acts coupled with state terrorism, as we shall see later,\n\nculminated in the demand for the restoration of the Tamil state\n\nwhich existed prior to the conquest of Ceylon by the colonial\n\npowers. The struggle initially was by peaceful means and when that\n\nfailed then transformed itself into an armed national liberation\n\nwar. The most vicious form of genocidal oppression calculated to\n\ndestroy the national identity of the Tamils as a separate and\n\ndistinct nation was the state aided massive colonization of\n\ntraditional homelands by Sinhalese settlers. These planned\n\ncolonization ever since independence had swallowed more than 3000\n\nsquare miles of Tamil Eelam. An entire district has been created\n\ninto a Sinhalese majority district and additional two electoral\n\ndistricts carved out to return Sinhalese to parliament.\n\nIn 1972 a new republican constitution was adopted which\n\nremoved even the meagre safeguards [(Section 29 (2) (b) & (c)]\n\ncontained in the Soulbury constitution. This infamous constitution,\n\nironically authored by a Troskite (4th International) Minister in\n\nMrs.Bandaranyake cabinet created the conditions for the political\n\nalienation of the Tamils and a deep wedge between the two nations.\n\nThe constitution incorporated the Sinhala Only Act as part of the\n\nconstitution and enthroned Buddhism as the foremost religion to be\n\nfostered by the state. Amendments moved by the Tamil Federal Party\n\nto the draft constitution demanding a federal constitution and\n\nparity of status for Tamil along with Sinhalese were defeated by\n\nthe government. In protest the Federal Party withdrew from further\n\ndeliberations of the Constituent Assembly and boycotted same. As a\n\nmark of protest Mr.Chelvanayagam resigned his seat in Parliament\n\nand challenged the government to hold an election to test the\n\nacceptability of the new constitution. He simultaneously sought a\n\nmandate from the Tamil people mandate for the restoration of the\n\ndefunct Tamil state. No elections were held till January, 1975 and\n\nMr.Chelvanayagam won the by-election against a government supported\n\ncandidate with a huge margin of 16,000 votes.\n\nIn 1975 confronted with the steadily mounting national\n\noppression, frustrated with the failure of the democratic\n\npolitical struggles, the Tamil national parties converged into a\n\nsingle movement (The Tamil Liberation Front). It resolved to fight\n\nfor political independence on the nation's right to self-\n\ndetermination.\n\nIn 1976 the Tamil United Front at its first convention held in\n\nVaddukkoddai resolved to restore and reconstitute the state of\n\nEelam. The resolution read -\n\n\"The First National Convention of the Tamil Liberation Front,\n\nmeeting at Pannakam (Vaddukkoddai Constituency) on the 14th of\n\nMay,1976, hereby declares that the Tamils of Ceylon,by virtue of\n\ntheir great language, their religions, their separate culture and\n\nheritage, their history of independent existence as a separate\n\nstate over a distinct territory for several centuries till they\n\nwere conquered by the armed might of European invaders and above\n\nall by their will to exist as a separate entity ruling themselves\n\nin their own territory, are a nation distinct and apart from their\n\nthe Sinhalese and their constitution announces to the world that\n\nthe Republican Constitution of 1972 has made the Tamils a slave\n\nnation ruled by the new colonial masters, the Sinhalese, who are\n\nusing the power they have wrongly usurped to deprive the Tamil\n\nnation of its territory, language, citizenship, economic life,\n\nopportunities of employment and education and thereby destroying\n\nall the attributes of nationhood of the Tamil people.\n\nAnd therefore, while taking note of the reservations\n\n......plantation workers, the majority of whom live and work\n\noutside the Northern and Eastern areas.\n\nThis convention resolves that the restoration and\n\nreconstitution of the Free, Sovereign, Secular, Socialist State of\n\nTamil Eelam based on the right of self-determination inherent in\n\nevery nation has become inevitable in order to safeguard the very\n\nexistence of the Tamil nation in this country\".\n\nIn the elections held in 1977 the Tamil United Liberation\n\nFront (renamed in 1976) in their manifesto, after describing the\n\nstructure of the Eelam state, its citizenship, its official\n\nlanguage, the abolition of the caste system, its economic policy,\n\netc. and how the liberation would be achieve, the manifesto stated-\n\n-\n\n\"The Tamil nation must take the decision to establish its\n\nsovereignty in its homeland on the basis of its right to self-\n\ndetermination. The only way to announce this decision to the\n\nSinhalese government and to the world is to vote for the Tamil\n\nUnited Liberation Front. The Tamil speaking representatives who get\n\nelected through these votes, while being members of the National\n\nState Assembly of Ceylon, will also form themselves into the\n\nNational Assembly of Tamil Eelam and establish the independence of\n\nTamil Eelam by bringing the constitution into operation either by\n\npeaceful means or by direct action or struggle\"\n\nIn the elections that followed the TULF received an\n\noverwhelming mandate having won 18 seats out of 24 contested. By\n\nfortuitous circumstances the TULF also emerged as the official\n\nopposition in Parliament. Unfortunately this was also the undoing\n\nof the TULF since Mr.Amirthalingam, the leader of the TULF, came to\n\nbe more delighted in his new role as the Leader of the Opposition\n\nthan leader of a movement committed to win liberation through\n\npeaceful means, direct action or struggle. Mr.Amirthalingam started\n\ntalking about an alterative to the Eelam demand and eventually\n\nsettled down for District Development Councils. This experiment\n\nfailed in the face of a chauvinistic and intransigent cabinet. In\n\nany case the Tamils felt that the DDC was a sop and the Tamil\n\nleadership have been taken yet again for a ride by crafty\n\nSinhalese politicians, specially Mr.J.R.Jayawardena, Prime Minister\n\nand later President of Sri Lanka.\n\nIn 1978 yet another Constitution was enacted which tightened\n\nthe enslavement of the Tamils further. The TULF like in 1972 walked\n\nout of the constitution assembly and took no part in its\n\ndeliberations.\n\nIn 1979 the Sri Lankan government enacted the notorious\n\nPrevention of Terrorism Act to cope with the growing militancy,\n\nnotably of the Liberation Tigers. This act and the subsequent crack\n\ndown by the army of Tamil youths made the situation worse and\n\nconfirmed the fears of the Tamils that the Sinhalese government was\n\nhell bent to exterminate them. The racial riots of 1977 and 1979\n\npoured oil on already burning fire.\n\nFrom 1979, because of the Sinhalese army occupation of Jaffna\n\nand the state terrorism let loose on the people, hostility began to\n\ngrow and the emotional division between the Sinhalese and the\n\nTamils became more acute. A group of highly organised young Tamil\n\nmilitants, first calling themselves the New Tamil Tigers and later\n\nThe Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1976 emerged to confront\n\nthe government terrorism by bearing arms.\n\nIn July, 1983 the Tamil Tigers ambushed a convey of Sinhalese\n\narmy in the north and killed 13 Sinhalese soldiers. This ignited\n\nanother Tamil Pogrom surpassing all the previous ones in its\n\nintensity and destruction of life and property. A panicked\n\ngovernment of Mr.Jayawardena at the growing militancy of the Tamils\n\nand the cry for separation sought to defuse the situation by the\n\n6th amendment to the Constitution by compelling all office holders,\n\nincluding Members of Parliament, to take an oath of allegiance to\n\nthe unitary constitution. Unable to comply with this forced\n\nallegiance the TULF boycotted the parliament and later lost their\n\nseats. With the forced political exile and eventual marginalization\n\nof the moderate leadership of the Tamils by the constitutional\n\namendment, the Tamil militant groups, notably the Tigers gained\n\nascendancy. Today LTTE is the undisputed and authentic leaders of\n\nthe Tamil people in the vanguard of the national liberation war.\n\nThe many battles and the recent fighting at Elephant Pass\n\nwhich assumed all the hallmarks of a conventional war between the\n\nTamil Tigers and Sinhalese army had established the fact that there\n\nare not only two separate nations but two separate armies as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbimanyu singam | O see ye not yon narrow road,\n\nCarleton University | So thick beset wi'thorns and briers,\n\nBio-Biotechnology | That is the path of Righteousness,\n\nEmail add.: asi...@chat.carleton.ca | Though after it but few inquires.\n\nForgive, but never forget- Ben Gurion| - Thomas the Rhymer.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUmberto Gui (nm...@dial.pipex.com) wrote:\n\n> Abimanyu singam wrote:\n\n> >\n\n> > Umberto Gui (nm...@dial.pipex.com) wrote:\n\n> >\n\n> > A SHORT HISTORY OF THE TAMIL EELAM LIBERATION\n\n> >\n\nSTRUGGLE\n\n1. AGONY OF THE TAMIL NATION\n\nGenocide as generally defined has two aspects. One aspect\n\nrefers to the gradual and systematic destruction and dismemberment\n\nof the basic foundations of a nation of a people, their language,\n\nculture, their history, their economic existence and their\n\ngeographical entity. The other refers to the actual physical\n\nextermination of a national community. The tamil Nation of the\n\nIsland has been subjected to this dual form of genocide since the\n\nIndependence of Sri Lanka in 1948.\n\nA calculated multi-pronged genocidal operation was unleashed\n\nagainst our people by successive Sinhala chauvinistic regimes to\n\nup-root and undermine the national identity of our people. This\n\ngenocidal thrust attacked simultaneously on the structural\n\nfoundations of the Tamil Nation, on the language, culture, economic\n\nlife and geography the cumulative effects of which threatened the\n\nvery survival of our people.\n\nOvershadowing the cultural and economic destabilization of the\n\nTamil Nation were the vicious and violent forms of genocidal\n\npractices aimed at the physical extermination of our people. State\n\norganised riots, which erupted periodically and assumed as a\n\nconsistent phenomenon during the present regime, have the\n\ndeliberate intent in the physical liquidation of the tamil people.\n\nThousands of our people have perished in this mad orgies of\n\nviolence. The July holocaust of 1983 peaked this pattern of\n\ngenocidal mass killings. Since this unprecedented upheaval of\n\nviolence the genocide of tamils assumed a new dimension of which\n\nthe armed forces and the commando police directly and openly\n\ninvolved in mass murders. The killings became a very calculated\n\nmilitary strategy of collective punishment, or rather collective\n\nmass reprisals, a notorious strategy inducted by the Israeli\n\nintelligent, the Mossad, aimed to contain the armed resistance\n\ncampaign of the Tamil guerrillas. Unable to contain, the\n\nescalating guerrilla war, superbly organised and executed by the\n\nTamil Tigers, the demoralized army turned their vengeance on the\n\ninnocent civilians unleashing a campaign of terrorisation to break\n\nthe will of our people and force them to betray the freedom\n\nfighters. The armed forces adopted savage methods to mass\n\nextermination unheard of in contemporary times.\n\nPeople are burnt alive, buried alive, blasted alive. People are\n\ngunned down in cold blood in the market place, in their homes, on\n\ntheir farms, on the roads, on the sea, anywhere the armed forces\n\nchoose to slaughter them. Innocent young men are rounded up,\n\nforced to dig their own graves and buried alive at gun point.\n\nSchool children are mowed in their classrooms, villagers are\n\nrounded up, locked in buildings and blasted with explosives. Young\n\nwomen are brutally raped and murdered. The manner in which the\n\nTamils are physically exterminated is so cruel, callous and brutal\n\nthat has shocked and enraged the conditions of the world. Three of\n\nthe 1985 massacres.\n\nthat occurred at kurikadduvan, valvettiturai and Ariyalai are\n\nenlisted here:\n\nMASSACRES ON THE FERRY:\n\nOn the 15th May 1985, Sri Lankan Navy personnel attacked a ferry\n\ncarrying tamil passengers from Delft to kurikadduvan and massacred\n\nabout 46 people. It was savage and ruthless massacre. The Navy men\n\nused axes, swords, knives and crowbars and hacked to death all\n\npassengers including all women and children.\n\nVALVETITURAI MASSACRE:\n\nOn the 9th of May 1985, went on a rampage committing arson,\n\nlooting, rape and mass murder in the coastal village of\n\nvalvettiturai in Northern Sri Lanka. About 50 tamil civilians\n\nincluding children and women were rounded up and forcefully locked\n\ninto the village library. Army men then planted high explosives\n\naround the building and blasted the people dead. About 25 people\n\nwere rounded up in the streets and were gunned down in cold blood.\n\nIn this blood thirsty rampage more than 90 people were murdered.\n\nARIYALAI MASSACRE:\n\nOn the 29th April 1985, the Army personnel attached to Navatkuli\n\ncamp entered the village of Ariyalai about 3 kilometres from Jaffna\n\ncity and rampaged the whole village. In this mad frenzy of\n\nmilitary terror, about 60 people including women and children were\n\nsenselessly slaughtered. Hundreds of houses were set ablaze.\n\nAND THESE MASSACRES CONTINUES.....\n\n2. --------\n\n=========================================================================\n\nThe details of the school children who have been killed by aerial bombing\n\non the Nagarkoil Central School in the Jaffna Peninsula by the Sri Lankan\n\nAir Force Pucara bomber planes on 22-09-1995.\n\n=========================================================================\n\n21 of the 25 children died have been identified.\n\nName age\n\n----------------------- ---\n\n1.

I was the only survivor of that\n\n185 civilians taken there. We were stabbed with sharp knives\n\nincluding a one and a half year old child, children and women.\n\nHe also testified that \" On the above said day at around five\n\nthirty in the evening Army men both in civil and military clothing\n\ncame and told that the officer in charge of the Camp wanted us to\n\ncome to the camp for enquiry and so they took us.\"\n\nCHILDREN AND WOMEN BARBARICALLY MURDERED:\n\n\" Elderly, Women, children and even babies were taken to the\n\nSaththrukkondan Bois town Army camp. After that four of us were\n\ntaken to the back side of the camp and blindfolded and our mouth\n\nwas stuffed with a cloth as well. Later they laid us on a wood\n\nbrick and suddenly they started stabbing us with sharp knives. I\n\nlaid there as if I was dead. I head voices of agony and pain I\n\ncan't even describe, all around me.\n\nAfter every thing was all over I slowly opened my eyes and saw\n\nbutchered bodies all around me. I then crawled my way through the\n\ndead bodies and hide myself among small shrubs. It was around three\n\nclock in the morning at that time. After exiting from that hell I\n\ncame to the village and I was admitted to the hospital for\n\ntreatment. The army was at this point in time was in search of me\n\nafter having heard of my escape. I was handed over to the Rev.\n\nMiller for protection by the Batticaloa Peace Committee. I lost my\n\nwhole family in this incident. I am the only survivor.\"\n\nNIGHT FILLED WITH SHOUTS AND CRIES:\n\nDuring the testimony Kanthiah Sivakkolunthu (37) said that:\n\n\" I am the principal at the Kathaiyakkan thivu school. On that\n\nday at around 11 in the morning a man wearing a red half sleeved T-\n\nshirt was going in a bicycle. He was new to the village and had a\n\nknife on the handle of the cycle. I immediately sensed that\n\nsomething was wrong and took my wife and children in a cycle to the\n\nSaththurukkondan colony. At that time, I saw Armed personnel both\n\nin civil and military clothing taking many civilians including\n\nwomen, children and elderly. We stayed the day at the\n\nSaththurukkondan colony. The army camp was situated a thousand\n\nmeters from my house. I heard cries of distress, shouts for help of\n\nwomen and children trough out the night. We also heard gun shots\n\nbeing fired and also saw a huge fire as well.\n\nNext day morning I went to my uncle's house. I couldn't see my\n\nuncle, aunt, nephew, niece or any of the children. All I saw was\n\nsome splattered small shoes of the children. In this massacre one\n\nand a half year old SUBOSHINI, three year old THULASI, seven years\n\nold SULOCHANA were lost. I heard that all of them were taken to the\n\nArmy camp and were butchered. Even the bodies have been burnt. Some\n\nkids who had gone near the camp later for rearing the cattle have\n\nsaid that they had seen many skulls and bones.\"\n\nDuring the hearings, a Vairamuththu Ariyavadivel (22)\n\ntestified as follows:\n\n\" On that day I had taken shelter in the jungle fearing the\n\nmilitary. Since I thought that the Army won't harm children I had\n\nleft my siblings, SOTHIVADIVEL (7), SHARMILA (9) at our house. They\n\nare also missing since the day of the massacre.I heard a lot of\n\ncries for help and mercy and a lot of shots being fired all through\n\nout the night on that day.\n\nSTRANDED ALONE HAVING LOST MY WHOLE FAMILY:\n\n\" My two son-in-laws were killed by the army only two months\n\nbefore the Saththurukkondan massacre. After that in the\n\nSaththurukkondan massacre I lost my wife, three daughters and\n\nseven grand children including a one year old one. I lost my whole\n\nfamily, eleven members all together to the army.\"\n\nThis was the tearful and emotional testimony given by\n\nGanapathippillai Arunachalam aged 73.\n\nRETURNED AS WE COULD NOT HEAR THOSE CRIES OF OUR LOVED ONES:\n\nDuring his testimony Retired Electricity Foreman\n\nAUGUSTINEPILLAI PHILIPPILLAI (73) said:\n\n\"'Our grandson, Vijayakumar (8) was staying with us and had\n\ngone to play outside on that day. As he was missing for some time\n\nwe went in search of him and we saw many people being taken by the\n\nArmy and among them was my grandson. Sensing the situation me and\n\nmy wife hid ourselves.\"\n\nAt this point the judge asked \"How many were taken by the Army?\"\n\nWitness: Among the crowd, 19 of my own close relatives were there.\n\nAfter coming to know those who were taken had not returned I along\n\nwith my wife went near the camp searching them. It was around seven\n\nin the evening. We heard the women crying, pleading for mercy and\n\nchildren shouting and crying in distress and pain. We could not\n\nhear those voices after that and so we came back.\" Judge: Did\n\nthe International committee of Red Cross went and saw what\n\nhappened?\n\nWitness: They were not allowed to see. Later the Bishop talked to\n\nthe Brigadier and went there with the members of the Citizen's\n\ncommittee, Sebamalai Geevaratnam and Singarasa to see what\n\nhappened. Sivarasa later told that he saw his wife's slippers and\n\nthat of many children's and babies'.\n\nDuring the testimony another witness Kanthasamy Nagaratnam\n\n(39) said:\n\n\" 16 of my family members were taken on that day to the camp\n\nby the Army. On that day when the Army came, only women and\n\nchildren were mostly at home. The men had taken refuge in the\n\nforest. At around 5.30 Army took all those who were at home. After\n\nsome time a lot of voices of distress and pain were heard from the\n\nArmy camp.\n\nE.Vairamuththu (62) while testifying said that:\n\n\" My wife told me that if the Army came they will only take\n\nthe men therefore you hide your self. I will stay in the house,\n\nthey won't take women. But I lost my wife who had saved me as they\n\nhad taken her to the camp. After the Army left I went near the camp\n\nin search of her but I only heard people crying.\"\n\nWhile testifying about the Saththurukkondan massacre Rasaiyah\n\nRatnaiya (45) of Panichchaiyadi said:\n\n\"On the day of the massacre about 60 Army personnel came at\n\naround 5.30 armed with guns and butcher knives. I took refuge in\n\na small palmarah plant. The Army then took my mother, father and\n\nthree children. I was thinking that they would be released after\n\ninterrogation but even after eight they were not and so I went in\n\nsearch of them near the camp. I heard a lot of people crying in\n\npain and agony that I got scared and returned home.\n\nBRIGADIER REFUSES TO SPEAK ABOUT THE INCIDENT\n\nIn the continued enquiry Batticaloa's Peace committee\n\nPresident and retired Government Agent S. Arunagirinathan testified\n\nas follows:\n\n\"After coming to know of this incident we recorded the\n\ntestimony of the sole survivor KANDASAMY KRISHNAKUMAR. We still\n\nhave the audio recording. Later we brought this atrocity to the\n\nattention of the Batticaloa Brigadier SENAVIRATNA. But he refused\n\neven to see us. Rest of the higher ranking Army officers also\n\nrefused to talk to us about this incident.\n\nNO ONE WAS ARRESTED:\n\nDuring his testimony the then Officer-in-Charge of the camp,\n\nCaptain. Gamini Varnakula Sooriya said \"On that day no search or\n\narrest was conducted by us\". He also reiterated that none of his\n\nmen even ventured out of the camp on the day of the massacre.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.

From AARTS\n\nMessage from the Actiongroup for Tamil Refugees in Sweden.\n\n\"Colombo is safe\"\n\nOne of the main arguments by the Swedish Utlaenningsnaemnden, that is the\n\nfinal court of appeal, to deport Ilattamilar from Sweden to Colombo, is\n\nthat Colombo allegedly is safe for those Tamilar who 1. have stated that\n\nthey are persecuted by the LTTE, or who 2. have not been able to proof\n\ntheir statement convincingly that they are persecuted by the Lankan\n\nGovernment. (In some applications for asylum, we find a combination of both\n\nthese statements).\n\nThe truth is that Colombo is not safe for Ilattamilar, whoever the\n\npersecutor is, even for those Tamilar who have not pinpointed any\n\npersecutor. The mere belonging to the Ilattamilar community is enough to\n\nbe rounded up, taken in, to be tortured, to disappear and to be recovered\n\nas lifeless body in a lake. The latest reports from August 1995 tell us\n\nthat 26 mutilated corpses, identified as those of Tamilar, were found\n\nfloating in the lakes of Colombo, in Balgoda Lake and Diyavanna Oya,\n\ndissolving corpses of young Tamilar, having once felt the nearness of\n\nmothers, fathers, sisters and brothers, having been harassed, abducted,\n\ntortured, their sexual organs mutilated, drowned, starved to death, beaten\n\nto death, and eyes and kidneys removed by bloodthirsty demons, known as\n\n\"army\" and \"police commandos.\" For them, the President herself is the\n\nsuperior commander, in areas controlled by her, actually close to the\n\nPresidential House in Colombo, where the killers, identified as members of\n\nthe Special Task Force(STF), a kind of elite group within the army and the\n\npolice, have their headquarters. There was not one killer, but more than\n\n20, forming a \"special\" task force to kill Tamilar. It is not possible to\n\nblame anti-LTTE Tamilar for having killed their brothers. The STF has to\n\nface accusations for murder. Nobody suspects the President, of course, to\n\nhave given orders to kill these Ilattamilar. We can notice, however, that\n\nshe has failed to control and survey her own STF.\n\nHere is not the right time and place to examine the degree of her\n\nresponsibility, but it is indeed time to make known to the world that no\n\nIlattamilar is safe in Colombo, that it is inhuman to send Ilattamilar\n\nback to Colombo against their will. The mere belonging to the Ilattamilar\n\ncommunity is a potential danger. Ilattamilar face annihilation, and not\n\nonly that, they face a terrible death by slow torture. Eyes and kidneys\n\nwere taken from bodies, probably with the intention to sell them to an eye\n\nand kidney bank. There is not only lust, there is also money in killing\n\nIlattamilar .\n\nWe have tried for years to tell Swedish authorities that Colombo is not\n\nsafe, but they listen not to us. Now they have to face the result of their\n\narrogance, that they have sent Tamilar into the hands of the STF. Our\n\nSwedish authorities listen to the Lankan Government, and above all, to a\n\nGovernmental Human Rights Organisation in the USA that produces copies of\n\nLankan Government statements under the cover of independent research. Mr.\n\nJohan Fischerstroem, judge, the Swedish highest responsible for all\n\ndeportations at the court of final appeal, treats its documents \"as his\n\nBible\"(his own words). He has made a pile of copies, and he distributes\n\nthese documents to visiting applicants trying to silence their questions\n\nand opposition. Having this fundamentalist approach to the documents of a\n\nUS governmental organisation, that echoes the nature of diplomatic\n\nrelations between the US Government and Sri Lanka, he neglects what Asia\n\nWatch and Amnesty International has to say. This year, he has rejected most\n\nappeals from Ilattamilar. When cornered, having been criticised for using\n\npartial propaganda sources, he usually seeks refuge to additional SECRET\n\nsources that nobody, except for him and his circle, is allowed to check.\n\nSo, each confrontation with him ends in his victory, because he can always\n\nescape criticism by pointing at his SECRET sources. Ilattamilar can\n\nseriously doubt the quality of his work. A group, including myself, will\n\nmake a quality test of his decisions and publish its evaluation of\n\n=46ischerstroem's work.\n\nThe urgent question is how many dead bodies must be found in the lakes of\n\nColombo before Johan Fischerstroem changes his views about Colombo being\n\nsafe for Ilattamilar ?\n\nPlease ask him this question and tell him what you know about Ilattamilar\n\nbeing allegedly safe in Colombo. Many applying Ilattamilar are now full of\n\nfear, standing shivering in a selection queue, waiting for his decision,\n\nthat may be fatal.\n\nMr Johan Fischerstroem\n\nUtlaenningsnaemnden\n\nBox 45102\n\n10430 Stockholm\n\nSweden\n\nPhone 46 8 7284600(exchange)\n\n=46ax 46 8 30 15 39\n\n(no e-mail)\n\n6. Subject: Tamil Civilians Strangled\n\nCOLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Police commandoes strangled 21 Tamil\n\ncivilians in their office in the capital and dumped the mutilated\n\nbodies in lakes over the last three months, officials said\n\nWednesday.\n\n``They were taken in on suspicion of being rebels, but no\n\ninvestigation had been done to confirm their guilt,'' police Chief\n\nWickremasinghe Rajaguru told a news conference.\n\nInstead, the victims, who ranged in age from 30 to 40, were\n\ntaken to the Special Task Force headquarters in the capital, and\n\nheld for five or six days before they were killed, he said.\n\nThe victims were Tamils abducted from cheap hotels or while\n\ntravelling in the capital, Colombo, he said.\n\nPolice have detained thousands of minority Tamils in Colombo,\n\nthe capital, since Tamil rebels broke a three-month cease-fire and\n\nresumed their 12-year-old civil war. Most of the Tamils arrested\n\nhave been released after their identities were established.\n\nThe Tamil guerrillas are fighting for a homeland in the north\n\nand east, claiming widespread discrimination by the majority\n\nSinhalese. More than 36,000 people have been killed.\n\nHuman rights activists have repeatedly expressed concern over\n\nthe disappearance of minority Tamils while in police custody,\n\nexecutions without trial and arbitrary arrests.\n\nTen police commandoes, a soldier and seven civilians have been\n\narrested in the stranglings of the Tamils.\n\n``The victims were thrown into an unused toilet with plastic\n\nhandcuffs around their necks, which strangled them to death,'' said\n\nT.V. Sumanasekera, head of the police criminal investigation\n\ndepartment.\n\nPolice are trying to establish the motive for the crime, but\n\nruled out personal gain since in one case, a victim's jewelry was\n\nreturned to family members\n\n--------------\n\n7.

On 9 July the Sri Lankan armed forces launched a large-scale\n\nmilitary offensive against the positions of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil\n\nEelam (LTTE) north of the city of Jaffna. The operation, involving intensive\n\nartillery shelling\n\nand air strikes, immediately forced tens of thousands of civilians to leave\n\nthe\n\narea. Many of the displaced sought shelter in churches and tenples, including\n\nseveral hundred people who took refuge in the Church of St. Peter and Paul in\n\nNavaly.\n\nAccording to eye-witness accounts, this church and several adjacent buildings\n\nwere hit by further air force strikes at 4.30 p.m the same day. During the\n\nattack\n\n65 people were killed and 150 wounded, including women and children. That\n\nevening and into the night Sri Lanka Red Cross staff evacuated most of the\n\nwounded by ambulance to the Jaffna Teaching Hospital. Delegates of the\n\nInternational Committee\n\nof the Red Cross (ICRC) present the next morning at the scene of the attack\n\nnoted\n\nthe widespread damage and measured the extent of the tragedy: many of the\n\nbodies had not yet been removed from the rubble.\n\nDeeply concerned by the series of the violent acts that have claimed innocent\n\ncivilians, the ICRC calls on the parties involved to respect civilian lives,\n\nproperty and places of refuge.
