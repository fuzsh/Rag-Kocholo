The Main Building of the College, an impressive pieces of architecture, was constructed in the year 1911. This magnificent building remains a thriving focal point of the Law College.[2]\n\nLaw education[edit]\n\nIn order to practice law in Sri Lanka, a lawyer must be admitted and enrolled as an Attorney-at-Law of the Supreme Court. To receive admission to the bar, a law student must complete law exams held by the Sri Lanka Law College.\n\nThe course of study for law students at Sri Lanka Law College does not grant any degree or certification, but, at completion of studies, examination and a period of apprenticeship, qualifies individuals for admission to the profession. Graduates holding LLB degrees from the University of Colombo, the Open University of Sri Lanka or any other university will be required to complete several examinations and the period of apprenticeship to become an Attorney-at-Law by receiving admission to the bar.\n\nThe SLLC carries out several post-attorney courses including an LLM from the University of Wales and post-attorney diplomas in intellectual property law and international trade law.\n\nSince the late 1980s admission has been from a very competitive entrance exam due to the high number of applicants.

In 1970, the rules were further amended to give the student community greater control over their own affairs. Since that time another amendment was made creating the posts of Social and Welfare Secretary and that of editorial assistant. However, this amendment has not been put down in writing, and has been carried out by convention.In 1991, the union amended its rules further to create the posts of Education Secretary and Assistant Education Secretary in order to protect and safeguard the educational necessities of the student community. The rules were also translated into Sinhala by the Law Students' Union of 1989 and 1991. In 1995 the rules were amended which resulted changing the name to the Law Student's Union of Sri Lanka.
