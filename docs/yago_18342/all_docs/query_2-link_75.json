        "text": "Unsustainable and illegal wildlife trade is a well-known conservation issue, but there are still large gaps in our understanding of how trade chains operate for the majority of over-exploited wildlife products. In particular, the large-scale global plant trade is under-reported and under-researched, and this is even more pronounced when the trade takes place within a country’s borders. A clear example is the trade in orchids, all species of which are listed by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Although countries such as Viet Nam are known hotspots for the large-scale collection of wild orchids for the international horticultural trade, little is known about how plants move from the wild to the end-consumer, what role is played by domestic markets and the sustainability of this trade. We use a mixed-methods approach to determine the structure of trade chains for orchids in key trading areas of Northern Viet Nam, and use a the...\n\nWorldwide, thousands of orchid species are harvested from the wild. Widespread legal and illegal unsustainable trade has contributed to the decline of many species. However, there is also evidence of long-term, sustainable wild harvest of some orchid species that contribute to local livelihoods and cultural traditions. There is a clear need to help guide harvesters and resource managers towards sustainability. However, there is currently no appropriate framework to guide local harvest decisions, which is especially problematic given huge data limitations, variations in on-the-ground capacity to monitor and manage resources, and considering that the potential for sustainable harvest is context-specific. We reviewed the literature on orchid harvest, ecology and demography; assessed information on the life history of 27 harvested species; and drew on our experience with diverse orchid taxa to identify characteristics expected to influence harvest sustainability. We identified 23 characteristics within four themes: abundance and distribution; species traits related to growth and reproduction; local management practices; and demand. We selected 12 characteristics for which information was available for many species and observable in the field, and used an iterative process to develop a decision-making dichotomous key. The key identifies if and how the harvest of a given population at a given time can be conducted more sustainably, offering sets of considerations that harvesters and managers can use and adapt to local contexts. Critical research gaps include techniques for partial plant harvest and for augmentation; and investigation into the traits and protocols that have permitted long-term persistence and that can increase current sustainability.\n\nIn developing countries, the sustainable management of non-timber forest products (NTFP) is promoted as a means to generate benefits in indigenous communities, alleviate poverty, and guarantee forest conservation. However, it is largely unknown whether this practice meets local economic needs. In Mexico, orchids are one of the most widely traded NTFP in local markets, but studies generally only provide lists of the species for sale. We obtained data for orchid richness and abundance from 56 sellers in a Mexican local market over one year. We related sellers’ economic status to certain socioeconomic variables and determined possible relationships be- tween orchid prices and abundance. Thirty-seven orchid species were recorded; an estimated 18,740 units were offered for sale, most of them harvested in surrounding forests. The greatest abundance of orchids for sale was recorded in October–December, whereas the greatest richness was found in March–April. The ages of the sellers ranged from 14–70 years, 78.5% were women, 50% had either no formal schooling or did not finish elementary school, and 54% spoke an indigenous language. The orchid trade was not the sellers’ main economic activity: to supplement their incomes they traded either agricultural products or other NTFP. Age and speaking an indigenous language were correlated positively with seller poverty and negatively with income obtained in a single sale day. Orchid price had a low, negative relationship with abundance in the market. Mexican law punishes the illegal wildlife trade, but this practice is allowed (at least) at the local level because orchid extraction and trade is a traditional use and custom in the local indigenous community.\n\nIn developing countries, the sustainable management of non-timber forest products (NTFP) is promoted as a means to generate benefits in indigenous communities, alleviate poverty, and guarantee forest conservation.

Plants that are not transported in accordance with CITES requirements may be either denied entry, and sometimes abandoned, or subject to seizure by enforcement officials in importing coun- tries. Instead of being destroyed, abandoned or con- fiscated plants may be returned to the range countries or sent to CITES Rescue Centers, which are public museums or botanical gardens in member countries where the plants are cared for and cultivated."
