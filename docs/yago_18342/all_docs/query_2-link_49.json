In a quarter of a century, significant progress in tuberous sclerosis complex has been made. Two responsible genes, TSC1 and TSC2, which encode hamartin and tuberin, respectively, were discovered in the 1990s, and their functions were elucidated in the 2000s. Hamartin-Tuberin complex is involved in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-protein kinaseÂ B-mammalian target of rapamycin signal transduction pathway, and suppresses mammalian target of rapamycin complexÂ 1 activity, which is a center for various functions. Constitutive activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complexÂ 1 causes variable manifestations in tuberous sclerosis complex. Recently, genetic tests were launched to diagnose tuberous sclerosis complex, and mammalian target of rapamycin complexÂ 1 inhibitors are being used to treat tuberous sclerosis complex patients. As a result of these advances, new diagnostic criteria have been established and an indispensable new treatment method; that is, \"a cross-sectional medical examination system,\" a system to involve many experts for tuberous sclerosis complex diagnosis and treatments, was also created. Simultaneously, the frequency of genetic tests and advances in diagnostic technology have resulted in new views on symptoms. The numbers of tuberous sclerosis complex patients without neural symptoms are increasing, and for these patients, renal manifestations and pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis have become important manifestations. New concepts of tuberous sclerosis complex-associated neuropsychiatric disorders or perivascular epithelioid cell tumors are being created. The present review contains a summary of recent advances, significant manifestations and therapy in tuberous sclerosis complex.

However, bipolar or psychotic features associated with tuberous sclerosis have been rarely reported. This report first presents a tuberous sclerosis patient, resembling a schizoaffective disorder of bipolar type. A patient with known tuberous sclerosis displayed mood fluctuation and psychotic features. Her symptoms did not remit along with several psychiatric medications. After hospitalization, the patient responded well with lamotrigine and aripiprazole without exacerbation. As demonstrated in this case, tuberous sclerosis may also encompass bipolar affective or psychotic features. We would like to point out the necessity to consider bipolarity in evaluating and treating tuberous sclerosis.\n\nTuberous sclerosis complex surveillance and management: recommendations of the 2012 International Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Consensus Conference.\n\nPubMed\n\nKrueger, Darcy A; Northrup, Hope\n\n2013-10-01\n\nTuberous sclerosis complex is a genetic disorder affecting every organ system, but disease manifestations vary significantly among affected individuals. The diverse and varied presentations and progression can be life-threatening with significant impact on cost and quality of life. Current surveillance and management practices are highly variable among region and country, reflective of the fact that last consensus recommendations occurred in 1998 and an updated, comprehensive standard is lacking that incorporates the latest scientific evidence and current best clinical practices. The 2012 International Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Consensus Group, comprising 79 specialists from 14 countries, was organized into 12 separate subcommittees, each led by a clinician with advanced expertise in tuberous sclerosis complex and the relevant medical subspecialty. Each subcommittee focused on a specific disease area with important clinical management implications and was charged with formulating key clinical questions to address within its focus area, reviewing relevant literature, evaluating the strength of data, and providing a recommendation accordingly. The updated consensus recommendations for clinical surveillance and management in tuberous sclerosis complex are summarized here. The recommendations are relevant to the entire lifespan of the patient, from infancy to adulthood, including both individuals where the diagnosis is newly made as well as individuals where the diagnosis already is established. The 2012 International Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Consensus Recommendations provide an evidence-based, standardized approach for optimal clinical care provided for individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex.

Despite this frequency and severity, there are no large population-based cohort studies. Here we present baseline and follow-up data of the international TuberOus SClerosis registry to increase disease Awareness (TOSCA) with an aim to provide detailed clinical characteristics of renal angiomyolipoma among patients with TSC. Patients of any age with a documented clinic visit for TSC within 12 months or who were newly diagnosed with TSC before participation in the registry were eligible. Data specific to renal angiomyolipoma included physical tumour characteristics (multiple, bilateral, lesion size and growing lesions), clinical signs and symptoms, and management. The effects of age, gender and genotype on the prevalence of renal angiomyolipoma were also evaluated. Renal angiomyolipoma was reported in 51.8% of patients at baseline, with higher frequency in female patients (57.8% versus 42.2%). The median age at diagnosis was 12 years. Prevalence of angiomyolipoma was higher in patients with TSC2 compared with TSC1 mutations (59.2% versus 33.3%, Pâ<â0.01). Of the 1031 patients with angiomyolipoma at baseline, multiple lesions were reported in 88.4% and bilateral in 83.9% of patients, while the size of angiomyolipoma was >3Â cm in 34.3% of patients. Most patients were asymptomatic (82%). Frequently reported angiomyolipoma-related symptoms included bleeding, pain, elevated blood pressure and impaired renal function. Embolization and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors were the two most common treatment modalities. The TOSCA registry highlights the burden of renal angiomyolipoma in patients with TSC and shows that renal manifestations are initially asymptomatic and are influenced by gender and genotype.

Nonetheless, the neurodevelopmental phenotype of these patients is not often detailed. The authors describe 3 individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex who share common characteristics that can help to identify a distinct profile of autism spectrum disorder. These findings include typical cognitive development, expressive and pragmatic language deficits, and anxiety. The authors also describe features specific to tuberous sclerosis complex that require consideration before diagnosing an autism spectrum disorder. Identifying distinct profiles of autism spectrum disorder in tuberous sclerosis complex can help optimize treatment across the life span.

TSC brain lesions (cortical tubers) contain dysmorphic neurons, brightly eosinophilic giant cells and white matter alterations in various proportions. However, a histological classification system has not been established for tubers. Therefore, the aim of this study was to define distinct histological patterns within tubers based on semi-automated histological quantification and to find clinically significant correlations. In total, we studied 28 cortical tubers and seven samples of perituberal cortex from 28 TSC patients who had undergone epilepsy surgery. We assessed mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activation, the numbers of giant cells, dysmorphic neurons, neurons, and oligodendrocytes, and calcification, gliosis, angiogenesis, inflammation, and myelin content. Three distinct histological profiles emerged based on the proportion of calcifications, dysmorphic neurons and giant cells designated types A, B, and C. In the latter two types we were able to subsequently associate them with specific features on presurgical MRI. Therefore, these histopathological patterns provide consistent criteria for improved definition of the clinico-pathological features of cortical tubers identified by MRI and provide a basis for further exploration of the functional and molecular features of cortical tubers in TSC.\n\nNovel Histopathological Patterns in Cortical Tubers of Epilepsy Surgery Patients with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHulshof, Hanna M.; Scholl, Theresa; Iyer, Anand M.; Anink, Jasper J.; van den Ouweland, Ans M.

Cortical tubers are the most common pathological changes in TSC and they are directly related to the disease's main clinical manifestations: seizures, mental retardation, and autistic behaviour. The aim of this study is to establish a correlation between tuber size and the severity of clinical features in TSC. We performed a retrospective study of the clinical and imaging findings from 45 TSC patients (22 females and 23 males) and compared the clinical features with the location, size, and number of the cortical tubers in each patient. Four patients had voluminous tubers located in 1 or both cerebral hemispheres. All of these patients had intractable seizures and severe mental retardation; 3 of these cases also presented with autistic behaviour, despite tubers having been resected in all 4 patients. Thirteen patients had tubers of large-to-average size, and all patients in this group showed intractable seizures and mental retardation. Nine patients who had experienced infantile spasms during the first year of life presented autistic behaviour. Multiple tubers of small to average size were found in 28 patients. In general, this group had seizures that responded well to antiepileptic drugs and a low prevalence of autism. In 3 patients who all presented good seizure control and normal intelligence, single cortical/subcortical tubers were located in the frontal or occipital lobes. Of the total of 45 patients, 13 had cerebellar as well as cerebral tubers; these were generally present in cases with more severe clinical features. Although large tubers are less common than small to medium-sized ones, they are much more likely to be accompanied by severe clinical symptoms (seizures, mental retardation and autistic behaviour), even when the smaller tubers are quite numerous.

However, the neurobiologic basis of autistic disorder in tuberous sclerosis complex is still unknown. We studied two cohorts of children followed up since 1986 until 2003, one cohort with tuberous sclerosis complex and another cohort with autistic disorder, to determine the incidence of autistic disorder in tuberous sclerosis complex and the incidence of tuberous sclerosis complex in autistic disorder respectively. We established a Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Registry in 1985 at the University of Hong Kong. In 2004, 44 index cases (the male to female ratio was 0.75:1) were registered. Three had a positive family history of tuberous sclerosis complex. Thus, the total number of tuberous sclerosis complex cases was 47. We adopted the diagnostic criteria of tuberous sclerosis complex for case ascertainment. The period prevalence rate of tuberous sclerosis complex for children and adolescents aged < 20 years is 3.5 per 10,000 (on Hong Kong island, excluding the eastern region with 125,100 aged < 20 years in 2003). Of 44 cases with tuberous sclerosis complex, 7 had autistic disorder. Thus, the incidence of autistic disorder in tuberous sclerosis complex is 16%. During the 17-year period (1986-2003), we collected a database of 753 children (668 boys and 84 girls; male to female ratio 8:1) with autistic disorder and pervasive developmental disorders. For all children with autistic disorder or pervasive developmental disorders, we routinely examined for any features of tuberous sclerosis complex by looking for neurocutaneous markers such as depigmented spots, which appear in 50% of children with tuberous sclerosis complex by the age of 2 years.

They are often asymptomatic with spontaneus regresion but can cause heart failure, arrhythmias, and obstruction. There have also been a few isolated reports of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome occurring in association with tuberous sclerosis and the great majority has been detected in patients with concomitant rhabdomyomas. We report a 12-day-old infant girl with tuberous sclerosis who presented with intraparietal and intracavitary rhabdomyomas with a Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW). She represents one of the few published cases of WPW syndrome and tuberous sclerosis and particularly interesting because of intramural rhabdomyomas regression with persistent intracavitary rhabdomyomas after two years of followup.

Individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex also have a range of behavioral, psychiatric, intellectual, academic, neuropsychologic, and psychosocial difficulties. These may represent the greatest burden of the disease. Around 90% of individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex will have some of these difficulties during their lifetime, yet only about 20% ever receive evaluation and treatment. The Neuropsychiatry Panel at the 2012 Tuberous Sclerosis Complex International Consensus Conference expressed concern about the significant âtreatment gapâ and about confusion regarding terminology relating to the biopsychosocial difficulties associated with tuberous sclerosis complex. METHODS The Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Neuropsychiatry Panel coined the term TANDâtuberous sclerosis complex-associated neuropsychiatric disordersâto bring together these multidimensional manifestations of the disorder, and recommended annual screening for TAND. In addition, the Panel agreed to develop a TAND Checklist as a guide for screening. RESULTS Here, we present an outline of the conceptualization of TAND, rationale for the structure of the TAND Checklist, and include the full US English version of the TAND Checklist. CONCLUSION We hope that the unified term TAND and the TAND Checklist will raise awareness of the importance of tuberous sclerosis complex-associated neuropsychiatric disorders and of the major burden of disease associated with it, provide a shared language and a simple tool to describe and evaluate the different levels of TAND, alert clinical teams and families or individuals of the importance of screening, assessment, and treatment of TAND, and provide a shared framework for future studies of tuberous sclerosis complex-associated neuropsychiatric disorders.

Postganglionic sudomotor function was assessed using the Silastic imprint test in nine patients with tuberous sclerosis complex who have at least one hypomelanotic macule greater than 2 cm in diameter. Sweating was induced by iontophoresis with 0.5% pilocarpine nitrate and sweat droplets were counted under a microscope using a 1 x 1 cm grid. Silastic imprint testing of an analogous skin area contralateral to the hypomelanotic macule was measured as a control. Sweat volume quantitation using sweat collectors was performed in five of the subjects. The sweat volume collected from the hypomelanotic macule was reduced compared to the control skin in four of the five subjects. Sweat droplet counts from the hypomelanotic macule were significantly reduced in only one of nine subjects. These data suggest that, although there is no difference in the number of functioning sweat glands in most hypomelanotic macules, the sweat glands produce less sweat (ie, decreased sweat volume) than in normal skin. We hypothesize that focal abnormalities of sympathetic innervation might be responsible for the hypomelanotic macules of tuberous sclerosis complex.\n\nFrequent falls and confusion: recurrent hypoglycemia in a patient with tuberous sclerosis complex.\n\nPubMed\n\nComninos, Alexander N; Yang, Lisa; Abbara, Ali; Dhillo, Waljit S; Bassett, J H Duncan; Todd, Jeannie F\n\n2018-05-01\n\nRecurrent hypoglycemia is common, but its presentation is often insidious resulting in delays in diagnosis and significant morbidity.

Caregiver knowledge in the South African population has not previously been reported. A prospective study of the parents of 21 children with tuberous sclerosis complex was undertaken. Median parental age was 38 (interquartile range 34.5-45) years. Parents were randomly allocated to receive written information about the condition, or to receive verbal counseling already established in clinic. A significant difference (P = .001) was observed in the change in the mean knowledge scores for the parent group that received written information (34.2 at baseline, 51.7 at the second visit. This impact was higher in parents with an education level of at least grade 8 (P = .003).

This retrospective chart review was performed to assess the economic burden of tuberous sclerosis complex with neurologic manifestations. Demographic and resource utilization data were collected for 95 patients for up to 5 years after tuberous sclerosis complex diagnosis. Mean age at diagnosis was 3.1 years, with complex partial and infantile spasms as the most common seizure types. In the first 5 years post-diagnosis, 83.2% required hospitalization, 30.5% underwent surgery, and the majority of patients (90.5%) underwent â¥3 testing procedures. In 79 patients with a full 5 years of data, hospitalizations, intensive care unit stays, diagnostic testing, and rehabilitation services decreased over the 5-year period. Resource utilization is cost-intensive in children with tuberous sclerosis complex and associated seizures during the first few years following diagnosis. Improving seizure control and reducing health care costs in this population remain unmet needs.\n\nAltered Astrocyte-Neuron Interactions and Epileptogenesis in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Disorder\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2015-06-01\n\nTsc1-deficient astrocytes on neuronal morphology and neuronal activity associated with seizures . 2.

Cortical tubers may disrupt several brain networks that control different types of attention. Frontal lobe dysfunction due to seizures or epileptiform electroencephalographic discharges may perturb the development of brain systems that underpin attentional and hyperactive functions during a critical early stage of brain maturation. Comorbidity of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with mental retardation and autism spectrum disorders is frequent in children with tuberous sclerosis. Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may also reflect a direct effect of the abnormal genetic program. Treatment of children with tuberous sclerosis complex with combined symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and epilepsy may represent a challenge for clinicians, because antiepileptic therapy and drugs used to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may aggravate the clinical picture of each other.\n\nDetermining Changes in Neural Circuits in Tuberous Sclerosis\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2012-05-01\n\nmutant mice.

Eight children (mean ageâÂ±âstandard deviation: 8.5âÂ±â5.5 years) with an established diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis complex and 8 age-matched controls were studied. The imaging protocol consisted of T1-weighted high-resolution 3-D spoiled gradient-echo sequence and a spin-echo, echo-planar diffusion-weighted sequence. Differences in the diffusion indices were evaluated using tract-based spatial statistics. Tract-based spatial statistics showed increased axial diffusivity in the children with tuberous sclerosis complex in the superior and anterior corona radiata, the superior longitudinal fascicle, the inferior fronto-occipital fascicle, the uncinate fascicle and the anterior thalamic radiation. No significant differences were observed in fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity and radial diffusivity between patients and control subjects. No difference was found in the diffusion indices between the baseline and follow-up examination in the patient group.

The classic clinical triad consists of angiofibromas, epilepsy, and developmental delay. Dermatologic disorder is one of the main characteristics. Angiofibromas, a common form of presentation, causes significant cosmetic and medical problems. The current treatment for skin lesions is laser therapy. The carbon dioxide (CO2) laser has been used satisfactorily in treating these lesions, but several studies have demonstrated a high percentage of recurrences. Erbium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (YAG) laser treatment has been used to resurface skin abnormalities in patients with dermatologic conditions. The dye laser as an alternative uses the principles of selective photothermolysis and is very effective in treating the vascular component of tuberous sclerosis. The use of all these lasers to treat skin lesions in patients affected by tuberous sclerosis has never been described in the literature. A retrospective study, conducted from 2007 to May 2013, investigated 13 patients who had tuberous sclerosis treated with an erbium:YAG/CO2/dye laser combination. All the patients showed great improvement of their skin lesions. The results were evident immediately after the first treatment. No patient experienced complications or recurrence. The combined use of the erbium:YAG/Dye/CO2 laser is a safe and effective treatment for skin lesions in patients affected by tuberous sclerosis.

The daughter presented with partial seizures at the age of 8 months. Computed tomography showed uncalcified periventricular nodules which on magnetic resonance imaging were ovoid, almost contiguous, of grey matter density, and did not enhance with gadolinium. Brain imaging of her asymptomatic mother was similar. Absence of severe mental retardation, extracranial hamartomas, and depigmented patches distinguishes familial bilateral periventricular nodular heterotopia (FNH) from tuberous sclerosis. FNH is probably inherited as an X linked dominant with lethality in males.

Case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nHernÃ¡ndez Pardines, F; NÃºÃ±ez MÃ¡rquez, S; FernÃ¡ndez Montalvo, L; Serra VerdÃº, M C; JuÃ¡rez MarroquÃ­, A\n\n2018-03-01\n\nTuberous sclerosis is a rare multisystemic disease with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. There are few documented cases in the literature of retinal hamartomas (astrocytomas) with aggressive progression in the context of this disease. A report is presented on a case of a 31 year-old male with unknown history of ophthalmic or systemic conditions, who referred to a history of 6 months of blurred vision in his right eye. This was caused by a unilateral retinal hamartoma due to an undiagnosed tuberous sclerosis. Multidisciplinary management, with the cooperation of Internal Medicine and the Oncology Department, is needed in these cases, as well as genetic counselling for affected patients. Complications are directly related to increased tumour size. Treatment does not seem to have any influence on the natural history of the disease.

We reevaluated whether increased uptake of Î±-[(11) C]methyl-l-tryptophan (AMT) in cerebral tubers is associated with tuber epileptogenicity. We included 12 patients (six male, 4-53Â years old) with TSC and refractory seizures who were evaluated for epilepsy surgery in our center, including video-electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging (FLAIR MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) with Î±-[(11) C]methyl-l-tryptophan (AMT-PET). Nine of these 12 patients also underwent intracerebral EEG recording. AMT uptake in each tuber was visually evaluated on PET coregistered with MRI. An AMT uptake index based on lesional/healthy cortex ratio was also calculated. Sensitivity and specificity values of AMT-PET in the detection of epileptogenic lesions were obtained, using the available electroclinical and neuroimaging evidence as the gold standard for epileptogenicity. A total of 126 tubers were identified. Two of 12 patients demonstrated a tuber with clearly increased AMT uptake, one of whom also showed a subtle increased AMT uptake in another contralateral tuber. Four other patients showed only subtle increased AMT uptake. The only two tubers with clearly increased AMT uptake proved to be epileptogenic based on intracerebral EEG data, whereas none of the tubers associated with subtle increased AMT uptake were involved at ictal onset. In a per-patient approach, this yielded a sensitivity of clearly increased AMT uptake in detecting tuber epileptogenicity of 17% (2/12 patients), whereas the per-lesion sensitivity and specificity were 12% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3-34%) and 100% (95% CI: 97-100%), respectively. AMT-PET is a specific neuroimaging technique in the identification of epileptogenic tubers in TSC.

Brain MRIs of 110 TSC patients (mean age 11.5Â years; age range 0.5-38Â years; 52 female; 26 TSC1, 68 TSC2, 8 without mutation identified in TSC1 or TSC2, 8 not tested) were retrospectively evaluated. Signal and morphological abnormalities consistent with olfactory bulb hypo/aplasia or with olfactory bulb hamartomas were recorded. Cortical tuber number was visually assessed and a neurological severity score was obtained. Patients with and without rhinencephalon abnormalities were compared using appropriate parametric and non-parametric tests. Eight of110 (7.2%) TSC patients presented rhinencephalon MRI changes encompassing olfactory bulb bilateral aplasia (2/110), bilateral hypoplasia (2/110), unilateral hypoplasia (1/110), unilateral hamartoma (2/110), and bilateral hamartomas (1/110); olfactory bulb hypo/aplasia always displayed ipsilateral olfactory sulcus hypoplasia, while no TSC patient harboring rhinencephalon hamartomas had concomitant forebrain sulcation abnormalities. None of the patients showed overt olfactory deficits or hypogonadism, though young age and poor compliance hampered a proper evaluation in most cases. TSC patients with rhinencephalon changes had more cortical tubers (47âÂ±â29.1 vs 26.2âÂ±â19.6; pâ=â0.006) but did not differ for clinical severity (pâ=â0.45) compared to the other patients of the sample. Olfactory bulb and/or forebrain changes are not rare among TSC subjects. Future studies investigating clinical consequences in older subjects (anosmia, gonadic development etc.) will define whether rhinencephalon changes are simply an imaging feature among the constellation of TSC-related brain changes or a feature to be searched for possible implications in the management of TSC subjects.\n\nA Case of Tuberous Sclerosis Without Multiorgan Involvement.\n\nPubMed\n\nFalsafi, Parisa; Taghavi-Zenouz, Ali; Khorshidi-Khiyavi, Reza; Nezami, Nariman; Estiar, Mehrdad Asghari\n\n2015-02-24\n\nTuberous sclerosis or Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a relatively rare autosomal dominant and progressive neurocutaneous disorder involves multiple organs mainly brain, heart, kidney, lung, liver, skin and eye. The diagnosis is typically made clinically. Here, we are reporting a case of TSC presented mainly with dermatologic findings and only neurologic manifestations on MRI. A 15-year-old female with intellectual disability is followed up at neurology clinic for history of seizure. Intelligence evaluation showed that she has intellectual disability. She had wart like lesions distributed in form of butterfly over the face especially involving nose. She did not have any sign and symptom of heart, kidney, lung, bone and eye involvement. Also, her laboratory tests were normal. Despite the physical examination showed absolutely intact neurologic examination, but brain MRI and CT scan revealed several cortical and subcortical tubers, and subependymal glial nodules; no evidence of giant cell astrocytomas and aneurysm. Hypesignal foci are seen at subcortical white matter on long TR images. Fibers are involved. In this case, there is no evidence of giant cell astrocytomas and aneurysm. It seems that TSC could be the prevalent disorder and referring intellectual disability patients in birth with normal organs could be diagnosed as TSC. Therefore, there is necessary need to design genetic natal and post natal tests for diagnosis of TSC cases. Also, there is pivotal that similar cases must be reported; perhaps TSC is more prevalent than to be considered.\n\nCerebellar lesions in tuberous sclerosis complex: neurobehavioral and neuroimaging correlates.\n\nPubMed\n\nEluvathingal, Thomas J; Behen, Michael E; Chugani, Harry T; Janisse, James; Bernardi, Bruno; Chakraborty, Pulak; Juhasz, Csaba; Muzik, Otto; Chugani, Diane C\n\n2006-10-01\n\nWe assessed the structural and functional imaging features of cerebellar lesions and their neurobehavioral correlates in a large cohort of patients with tuberous sclerosis complex. A consecutive series of 78 patients with tuberous sclerosis complex underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) studies with [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and alpha-[(11)C]methyl-l-tryptophan (AMT) as part of their evaluation for epilepsy surgery. Neurobehavioral assessment included the Gilliam Autism Rating Scales (GARS) and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS). Twenty-one patients (27%) had cerebellar lesions (10 boys; mean age 9 +/- 8 years; 9 had right-sided, 10 had left-sided, and 2 had bilateral cerebellar lesions). The lesions showed decreased glucose metabolism (0.79 +/- 0.10) and increased (1.04 +/- 0.10) AMT uptake compared with the normal (nonlesional) cerebellar cortex. Comparisons between patients with (n = 20) and without (n = 57) a cerebellar lesion on neurobehavioral functioning, controlling for the number and location of cortical tubers, revealed that the cerebellar lesion group had higher overall autistic symptomatology. Within-group analyses of the cerebellar lesion group revealed that children with right-sided cerebellar lesions had higher social isolation and communicative and developmental disturbance compared with children with left-sided cerebellar lesions. The side of the cerebellar lesion was not related to adaptive behavior functioning. These findings provide additional empiric support for a role of the cerebellum in autistic symptomatology. Further investigation of the potential role of the right cerebellum in autism, particularly with regard to the dentatothalamofrontal circuit, is warranted.\n\nTopical Rapamycin Therapy to Alleviate Cutaneous Manifestations of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2015-05-01\n\nAD Award Number: W81XWH-11-1-0240 Title: Topical Rapamycin Therapy to Alleviate Cutaneous Manifestations of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Principal...1Sep2011 - 28Feb2015 4.

It is characterized by the development of benign proliferations in many organs, which result in different clinical manifestations. It is associated with the mutation of two genes: TSC1 (hamartin) and TSC2 (tuberin), with the change in the functionality of the complex target of rapamycin (mTOR). MTOR activation signal has been recently described in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and its inhibition could be beneficial in patients with lupus nephritis. We report the case of a patient who began with clinical manifestations of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) 30 years after the onset of SLE with severe renal disease (tipe IV nephritis) who improved after treatment with iv pulses of cyclophosphamide. We found only two similar cases in the literature, and hence considered the coexistence of these two entities of great interest.

We assessed whether magnetic source imaging (MSI) and coregistration of (18)fluorodeoxyglucose PET (FDG-PET) with MRI could improve the identification of the epileptogenic regions noninvasively in children with TSC. In addition to standard presurgical evaluation, 28 children with intractable epilepsy from TSC referred from 2000 to 2007 had MSI and FDG-PET/MRI coregistration without extraoperative intracranial EEG. Based on the concordance of test results, 18 patients with TSC (64%) underwent surgical resection, with the final resection zone confirmed by intraoperative electrocorticography. Twelve patients are seizure free postoperatively (67%), with an average follow-up of 4.1 years. Younger age at surgery and shorter seizure duration were associated with postoperative seizure freedom. Conversely, older age and longer seizure duration were linked with continued seizures postoperatively or prevented surgery because of nonlateralizing or bilateral independent epileptogenic zones. Complete removal of presurgery MSI dipole clusters correlated with postoperative seizure freedom. Magnetic source imaging and (18)fluorodeoxyglucose PET/MRI coregistration noninvasively localized the epileptogenic zones in many children with intractable epilepsy from tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), with 67% seizure free postoperatively. Seizure freedom after surgery correlated with younger age and shorter seizure duration. These findings support the concept that early epilepsy surgery is associated with seizure freedom in children with TSC and intractable epilepsy.\n\nRapamycin and rapalogs for tuberous sclerosis complex.\n\nPubMed\n\nSasongko, Teguh H; Ismail, Nur Farrah Dila; Zabidi-Hussin, Zamh\n\n2016-07-13\n\nPrevious studies have shown potential benefits of rapamycin or rapalogs for treating people with tuberous sclerosis complex. Although everolimus (a rapalog) is currently approved by the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) and the EMA (European Medicines Agency) for tuberous sclerosis complex-associated renal angiomyolipoma and subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, applications for other manifestations of tuberous sclerosis complex have not yet been established. A systematic review is necessary to establish the clinical value of rapamycin or rapalogs for various manifestations in tuberous sclerosis complex. To determine the effectiveness of rapamycin or rapalogs in people with tuberous sclerosis complex for decreasing tumour size and other manifestations and to assess the safety of rapamycin or rapalogs in relation to their adverse effects. Relevant studies were identified by authors from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, and clinicaltrials.gov. Relevant resources were also searched by the authors, such as conference proceedings and abstract books of conferences, from e.g. the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex International Research Conferences, other tuberous sclerosis complex-related conferences and the Human Genome Meeting.

We searched our tuberous sclerosis registry, established in 1985 (N = 44), and performed an analysis of children who had MRIs of the brain performed (n = 22). A neuroradiologist blinded to the clinical findings scored the MRIs according to the total number and site of the tubers. The following factors were analyzed: age, sex, presence of autism (n = 7), presence (n = 19) and severity of mental retardation (mild [n = 12], moderate to severe [n = 7]), presence of epilepsy (n = 21) or infantile spasm (n = 8), and age at onset of seizures less than 1 year (n = 10). There was no significant relationship between the number and site of tubers and the following factors: sex, autism, mental retardation, degree of mental retardation, epilepsy, history of infantile spasm, or age at onset of seizures less than 1 year. Only the presence of cortical tubers in the parietal regions had a significant relationship with the history of infantile spasm (P = .012). Using multiple regression analysis of all of the risk factors, only age is related to the number of tubers in the MRI (P = .047), and a history of infantile spasm is related to the presence of tubers in the parietal (P = .009) and occipital (P = .031) lobes. The associated comorbidities in tuberous sclerosis complex might be explained by more complex underlying genetic or pathologic issues rather than purely by the site of the cortical tubers. We suggest that a developmental approach, by analyzing the age at the appearance of tubers in both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases with the development of other neuropsychiatric comorbidities, should be undertaken to assess the causal relationship.\n\n[Clinical and genetic study patients with tuberous sclerosis complex].\n\nPubMed\n\nRubilar, Carla; LÃ³pez, Francisca; Troncoso, MÃ³nica; Barrios, AndrÃ©s; Herrera, Luisa\n\n2017-02-01\n\nTuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a multisystem autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in the tumor suppressor genes TSC1 or TSC2. To characterize clinically and genetically patients diagnosed with TSC. Descriptive study of clinical records of 42 patients from a pediatric neuropsychiatry department diagnosed with TSC and genetic study in 21 of them. The exon 15 of TSC1 gene and exons 33, 36 and 37 of TSC2 gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. The relationship between the mutations found with the severity and clinical course were analyzed. In 61.9% of the patients the symptoms began before 6 months of age. The initial most frequent manifestations of TSC were new onset of seizures (73.8%) and the detection of cardiac rhabdomyomas (16.6%). During the evolution of the disease all patients had neurological involvement; 92.9% had epilepsy.

The genetic difference and the severity of epilepsy are the two main factors, but their weight in the occurrence of MR is still unclear. Two hundred twenty-three patients with tuberous sclerosis who received intelligence assessment, genetic mutation analysis, and the epilepsy severity assessment were included in our study. Genotype-neurocognitive phenotype correlations and epilepsy-neurocognitive phenotype correlations were analyzed by binary logistic regression analysis. No statistical significant result was found on genotype-neurocognitive phenotype correlations, which contrasted the previous report. The prevalence of MR was 50.0% for the patients with tuberous sclerosis complex-1 (TSC1) mutation, 54.5% for TSC2 (p=0.561), 54.7% for patients with protein-truncating (PT) and 50.0% for patients with nontruncating (NT) (p=0.791), and 54.3% for patients with family history and 53.7% for patients without family history (p=0.748). Statistical significant results were found on epilepsy-neurocognitive phenotype correlations, both on E-chess score (p=0.01) and the occurrence of infantile spasms (p=0.014), which was consistent to the previous study. For children with tuberous sclerosis, instead of genetic factors, epilepsy may play the main role for the presence of mental retardation. Patients with mental retardation tend to have earlier seizure attack, take more AEDs, have more seizure types, and have higher seizure frequency. Among the four cognitive functions in Denver II, social ability and language ability are more vulnerable to be influenced than fine and gross motor ability. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Methods Four young children each developed an enlarging retinal neoplasm that eventually necessitated enucleation of the affected eye. The systemic findings, clinical course, and histopathologic findings were reviewed. Results Each patient had a progressively enlarging retinal mass associated with a total exudative retinal detachment and neovascular glaucoma. Enucleation was necessary in each case because the affected eye became blind and painful. The mean patient age at enucleation was 7 years, and the median age was 3 years. At the time of enucleation the tumors ranged from 10 to 20 mm in basal diameter and from 10 to 25 mm in thickness. Histopathologic studies of each eye revealed a giant cell astrocytoma that had produced a total exudative retinal detachment. The tumor cells showed positive immunoreactivity to neuron-specific enolase and glial fibrillary acidic protein. The retinal neoplasms in these cases were identical histopathologically to the subependymal giant cell astrocytoma that typifies TSC in the brain. One tumor filled the entire eye and perforated the globe. Although the lesions simulated retinoblastoma clinically, each patient had ocular and systemic findings of TSC, supporting the diagnosis of astrocytic hamartoma. Conclusions Although retinal astrocytic lesions of TSC generally are stationary, they can sometimes grow relentlessly and cause severe ocular complications. Patients with retinal astrocytic hamartomas should have serial ophthalmic evaluations because of this possibility.

Objective Our goal was to document the oral findings in 58 adult patients with TSC. Results Forty patients (69%) had oral fibromas, appearing mostly on the attached or interdental gingiva. Other oral sites included buccal and labial mucosa, the superior labial frenulum, palate, and tongue. Fifty-six patients (97 %) had multiple dental enamel pits. Limitations This case series comprised predominantly adult females with TSC and lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Conclusions Oral fibromas in TSC are mostly, but not exclusively, gingival. Dental pits are present in nearly all patients. The multiple oral papules in TSC may appear similar to those observed in Cowden syndrome, Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, and rarely in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1.

Other findings included syndactyly, typical facies, dental abnormalities, dermatoglyphic hypoplasia, epidermal ridge sweat pore count slightly below normal, and keratosis pilaris. Clinical studies and genetic analysis excluded the diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis in our patient. We conclude that she has ectodermal dysplasia associated with mental retardation. This association has been described previously; it suggests the possible interrelationship of a community of ectodermal dysplasia syndromes with a distinctive structural hair abnormality (pili torti et canaliculi), variable midfacial malformations, limb defects, and other features such as mental retardation. The similarity of our patient to that described by Whiting et al. and Abramovits-Ackerman et al. suggests the autonomy of this syndrome.\n\nLong-term neurological outcome in children with early-onset epilepsy associated with tuberous sclerosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nCusmai, Raffaella; Moavero, Romina; Bombardieri, Roberta; Vigevano, Federico; Curatolo, Paolo\n\n2011-12-01\n\nIn tuberous sclerosis complex, early seizure onset is associated with high risk of intractable epilepsy and cognitive/behavioral impairment. We retrospectively evaluated the long-term outcome of 44 infants presenting with seizures in the first 12 months who received vigabatrin, and were followed up for at least 3.5 years. At the final evaluation 55% of patients were still having seizures, 80% had intellectual disability, and 30% had autism. Sixty-five percent of children who had been treated earlier with vigabatrin after seizure onset achieved seizure freedom, compared with 24% of subjects who received vigabatrin treatment later (P<0.01). Intellectual disability was present in 61% of the children treated early (group A) and in 100% of the children treated later (group B). Nine percent of group A and 52% of group B had autism (Pâ0.001). A shorter gap between seizure onset and start of treatment could reduce the risk of epileptic encephalopathy, minimizing the deleterious effect of seizures, but is not able to completely reverse the tuberous sclerosis complex-associated cognitive impairment.

The organs that are most commonly affected are the brain, skin, kidneys, eyes, heart and lungs. Of all the children with this disease, 85% present neurological manifestations that, due to their severity, are the main cause of morbidity and mortality. The most significant neurological manifestations are epilepsy, autism spectrum disorders and mental retardation. It has been shown that in tuberous sclerosis complex the genes TSC1 and TSC2 alter the mTOR enzyme cascade, which sets off inhibition of this pathway. The possibility of resorting to treatments applied at the origin, thus inhibiting this pathway, is currently being evaluated.\n\nCross-sectional Imaging Review of Tuberous Sclerosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nKrishnan, Anant; Kaza, Ravi K; Vummidi, Dharshan R\n\n2016-05-01\n\nTuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a multisystem, genetic disorder characterized by development of hamartomas in the brain, abdomen, and thorax. It results from a mutation in one of 2 tumor suppressor genes that activates the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway.

Skin and dental lesions are common in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and are a frequent concern for patients. Recognition of these lesions is imperative for early diagnosis, given the treatment advances that may improve patient outcomes. To detail recommendations for the diagnosis, surveillance, and management of skin and dental lesions in TSC. The TSC Dermatology and Dentistry Subcommittee, 1 of 12 subcommittees, reviewed the relevant literature from 1997 to 2012. A consensus on skin and dental issues was achieved within the Dermatology and Dentistry Subcommittee before recommendations were presented, discussed, and agreed on in a group meeting of all subcommittees from June 14 to 15, 2012. Skin and dental findings comprise 4 of 11 major features and 3 of 6 minor features in the diagnostic criteria. A definite diagnosis of TSC is defined as the presence of at least 2 major features or 1 major and 2 or more minor features; in addition, a pathological mutation in TSC1 or TSC2 is diagnostic. Skin and oral examinations should be performed annually and every 3 to 6 months, respectively. Intervention may be indicated for TSC skin or oral lesions that are bleeding, symptomatic, disfiguring, or negatively affecting function. Options presented include surgical excision, laser(s), or use of a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor.\n\nClinical Characteristics of Connective Tissue Nevi in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex With Special Emphasis on Shagreen Patches.\n\nPubMed\n\nBongiorno, Michelle A; Nathan, Neera; Oyerinde, Oyetewa; Wang, Ji-An; Lee, Chyi-Chia Richard; Brown, G Thomas; Moss, Joel; Darling, Thomas N\n\n2017-07-01\n\nPatients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) frequently develop collagenous connective tissue nevi. The prototypical lesion is a large shagreen patch located on the lower back, but some patients only manifest small collagenomas or have lesions elsewhere on the body. The ability to recognize these variable presentations can be important for the diagnosis of TSC. To describe the clinical characteristics of connective tissue nevi on the trunk and extremities of patients with tuberous sclerosis complex. A retrospective analysis of patient medical records and skin photography was performed; 104 adult patients with TSC were enrolled in an observational cohort study that was enriched for those with pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and was therefore composed mostly of women (99 women, 5 men). All patients included were examined at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, from 1998 to 2013. Connective tissue nevi were categorized per anatomic location and size. Lesions less than 1 cm in diameter were termed collagenomas. Shagreen patches were characterized as small (1 to <4 cm), medium (4 to <8 cm), and large (â¥8 cm). Frequency, anatomic location, size, and histological appearance of connective tissue nevi in patients with TSC. Overall, 58 of 104 patients (median [range] age, 42 [19-70] years) with TSC (56%) had at least 1 connective tissue nevus on the trunk or thighs; of these, 28 of 58 patients (48%) had a solitary lesion, and 30 of 58 patients (52%) had 2 or more lesions. Overall, 120 lesions from 55 patients were classified by size; 46 lesions (38%) were collagenomas; 39 lesions (32%) were small shagreen patches; 21 lesions (18%), medium shagreen patches; and 14 lesions (12%), large shagreen patches. The distribution of lesions was 9% (nâ=â11), upper back; 29% (nâ=â35), middle back; 51% (nâ=â61), lower back; and 11% (nâ=â13), other locations.

The mechanisms by which tuberin regulates fibrosis in kidney angiomyolipomas (AMLs) of tuberous sclerosis patients are not fully known. Method In the present study, we investigated the potential role of tuberin/mTOR pathway in the regulation of cell fibrosis in AML cells and kidney tumor tissue from tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) patients. Results AML cells treated with rapamycin shows a significant decrease in mRNA and protein expression as well as in promoter transcriptional activity of alpha-smooth muscle actin (Î±-SMA) compared to untreated cells. In addition, cells treated with rapamycin significantly decreased the protein expression of the transcription factor YY1. Rapamycin treatment also results in the redistribution of YY1 from the nucleus to cytoplasm in AML cells. Moreover, cells treated with rapamycin resulted in a significant reduce of binding of YY1 to the Î±SMA promoter element in nuclear extracts of AML cells. Kidney angiomyolipoma tissues from TSC patients showed lower levels of tuberin and higher levels of phospho-p70S6K that resulted in higher levels of mRNA and protein of Î±SMA expression compared to control kidney tissues. In addition, most of the Î±-SMA staining was identified in the smooth muscle cells of AML tissues. YY1 was also significantly increased in tumor tissue of AMLs compared to control kidney tissue suggesting that YY1 plays a major role in the regulation of Î±SMA. Conclusions These data comprise the first report to provide one mechanism whereby rapamycin might inhibit the cell fibrosis in kidney tumor of TSC patients.

Such tumours are of interest primarily because of the distinctive morphology of their cell population and their immunoreactivity with melanocytic and myoid markers. There is a strong association between perivascular epithelioid cell neoplasms and tuberous sclerosis complex. Perivascular epithelioid cell neoplasms very rarely occur in the upper aero-digestive tract. To date only three cases of nasal perivascular epithelioid cell neoplasms have been reported in the literature. The present report refers to a 22-year old woman, without any stigmata of tuberous sclerosis complex, with early onset of a polypoid nasal mass with pathological and immunohistochemical features entirely compatible with those of a perivascular epithelioid cell neoplasm.\n\nClinical management of tuberous sclerosis complex over the lifetime of a patient.\n\nPubMed\n\nFrost, Michael; Hulbert, John\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder characterized by nonmalignant tumors (hamartomas) that can occur in various organ systems, including the brain, kidneys, lungs, skin, eyes, and heart. Clinical manifestations of TSC can occur at any age, thereby making the diagnosis difficult. No typical disease presentation is known, and the clinical presentation usually differs between pediatric and adult patients. Furthermore, variable penetrance of the genetic mutation causes a range of disease severity from very mild to severe, and affected individuals can go undetected for years because many of the clinical manifestations of TSC lack specificity. Once a diagnosis is made, TSC management strategies should be tailored to address the symptoms and risks most relevant to the age of the patient. Improved understanding of the genetic basis of TSC and of the central issue of mTOR overactivation has led to use of pharmacotherapies such as the mTOR inhibitors everolimus and sirolimus in the treatment of TSC disease. In Phase II and III studies, everolimus has demonstrated efficacy and safety in the treatment of both brain (subependymal giant cell astrocytoma) and renal (angiomyolipoma) manifestations associated with TSC. It is important to bear in mind that TSC is a lifelong condition, and for those diagnosed as children, a continuum of care will be needed as they transition from pediatric to adult health services. Clearly identifying the likely differences among diagnosis, monitoring, and management of pediatric and adult patients with TSC is an important step in enabling efficiencies to be maximized without compromising the care provided to patients.\n\nClinical management of tuberous sclerosis complex over the lifetime of a patient\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFrost, Michael; Hulbert, John\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder characterized by nonmalignant tumors (hamartomas) that can occur in various organ systems, including the brain, kidneys, lungs, skin, eyes, and heart.

The cardinal features of TSC are skin lesions, convulsive seizures, and mental retardation. We report a sporadically occurring case of definite TSC in a young female who presented with oral and cutaneous manifestations without mental retardation or history of convulsive seizures, which to the best of our knowledge has not been reported so far.\n\nEarly neurodevelopmental screening in tuberous sclerosis complex: a potential window of opportunity.\n\nPubMed\n\nGipson, Tanjala T; Gerner, Gwendolyn; Srivastava, Siddharth; Poretti, Andrea; Vaurio, Rebecca; Hartman, Adam; Johnston, Michael V\n\n2014-09-01\n\nInfants born with tuberous sclerosis complex, a genetic condition resulting from a mutation in TSC1 or TSC2, are at increased risk for intellectual disability and/or autism. Features of epilepsy, neuropathology, genetics, as well as timing and type of mechanism-based medications have been proposed as risk factors. Neurodevelopmental outcomes have been reported among these studies; however, few include data about the individuals' early neurodevelopmental profile, a factor that may contribute significantly to these outcomes. Further, there is no clinical standard for the neurodevelopmental assessment of these infants. The paucity of data regarding the natural history of neurodevelopment in infants with tuberous sclerosis complex and the lack of a gold standard for neurodevelopmental evaluation present a significant challenge for clinicians and researchers. During the first year of life, we tracked the onset of infantile spasms, the type and timing of antiepileptic treatments, and the associated response of two age-matched infants with tuberous sclerosis complex. We also employed Capute Scales as a part of a structured neurodevelopmental evaluation to characterize and compare their neurodevelopmental profiles. Infant 1 developed infantile spasms with confirmed hypsarrhythmia at 4 months of age. Treatment with vigabatrin was initiated within 24 hours with near immediate cessation of seizures and no further seizures to date. Expressive language delay was detected at 12 months and treated with speech and/or language therapy. Infant 2 developed complex partial seizures at 1 month. Treatment included levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, and the ketogenic diet. Vigabatrin was initiated on detection of hypsarrhythmia after 4 months. Intractable epilepsy persists to date. Global developmental delay was evident by 8 months and treated with physical, occupational, and speech and/or language therapy. Many risk factors have been associated with intellectual disability and/or autism in\n\nPotential for treatment of severe autism in tuberous sclerosis complex\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGipson, Tanjala T; Gerner, Gwendolyn; Wilson, Mary Ann; Blue, Mary E; Johnston, Michael V\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved two mechanism-based treatments for tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-everolimus and vigabatrin. However, these treatments have not been systematically studied in individuals with TSC and severe autism. The aim of this review is to identify the clinical features of severe autism in TSC, applicable preclinical models, and potential barriers that may warrant strategic planning in the design phase of clinical trial development. A comprehensive search strategy was formed and searched across PubMed, Embase and SCOPUS from their inception to 2/21/12, 3/16/12, and 3/12/12 respectively. After the final search date, relevant, updated articles were selected from PubMed abstracts generated electronically and emailed daily from PubMed. The references of selected articles were searched, and relevant articles were selected. A search of clinicaltrials.gov was completed using the search term âTSCâ and âtuberous sclerosis complexâ. Autism has been reported in as many as 60% of individuals with TSC; however, review of the literature revealed few data to support clear classification of the severity of autism in TSC. Variability was identified in the diagnostic approach, assessment of cognition, and functional outcome among the reviewed studies and case reports. Objective outcome measures were not used in many early studies; however, diffusion tensor imaging of white matter, neurophysiologic variability in infantile spasms, and cortical tuber subcategories were examined in recent studies and may be useful for objective classification of TSC in future studies. Mechanism-based treatments for TSC are currently available. However, this literature review revealed two potential barriers to successful design and implementation of clinical trials in individuals with severe autism-an unclear definition of the population and lack of validated outcome measures.

There are two genes that cause this condition: TSC1 and TSC2. Our goal was to clinically characterize patients with TS followed up in the Pediatric Neurology Clinic of a tertiary hospital during the last 10 years, and correlate the genotype with the severity of neurological manifestations and imaging studies. Retrospective analysis of patients with TS, including review of medical records and available MRI imaging. We studied 35 cases with a median age at diagnosis of ten months. Seizures were the first manifestation in 91.4% of cases, with a predominance of epileptic spasms. Over 50% had cognitive impairment and 49% behavioral disorders. A genetic study was performed on 24 children, and TSC2 mutations identified in 58.3% of them. Of the 11 cases of refractory epilepsy, six had the TSC2 gene mutation. In the group of eight patients with moderate/severe cognitive deficits, five had TSC2 mutations. We reviewed 26 MRI scans, in which it was observed that 76.9% had diffuse involvement of cerebral lobes, which reflects a greater burden of injury. Of the patients who had an MRI scan performed and had TSC2 mutations, all had a high tuber load, and5 of them had refractory epilepsy. In our sample we observe a high percentage of mutations in the TSC2 gene. This mutation carries a worse neurological prognosis, with drug-resistant epilepsy and a more severe cognitive impairment.

TSC is associated with autism, intellectual disability and severe epilepsy. Cortical tubers are believed to represent the neuropathological substrates of these disabling manifestations in TSC. In the presented study we used high-throughput RNA sequencing in combination with systems-based computational approaches to investigate the complexity of the TSC molecular network. Overall we detected 438 differentially expressed genes and 991 differentially expressed small non-coding RNAs in cortical tubers compared to autopsy control brain tissue. We observed increased expression of genes associated with inflammatory, innate and adaptive immune responses. In contrast, we observed a down-regulation of genes associated with neurogenesis and glutamate receptor signaling. MicroRNAs represented the largest class of over-expressed small non-coding RNA species in tubers. In particular, our analysis revealed that the miR-34 family (including miR-34a, miR-34b and miR-34c) was significantly over-expressed. Functional studies demonstrated the ability of miR-34b to modulate neurite outgrowth in mouse primary hippocampal neuronal cultures.

TSC1 or TSC2 encoded proteins modulate cell function via the mTOR signaling cascade and serve as keystones in regulating cell growth and proliferation. AIM. To review the etiopathogenic mechanisms and the natural course of the association of autism and epilepsy in TSC. Both the clinical and the neuroimaging findings of TSC, including early onset epilepsy and the localization of cortical tubers in the temporal lobes, and the molecular understanding of the mTOR signaling pathway, not only involved in cell growth, but also in synaptogenesis, synaptic plasticity and neuronal functioning, have suggested a multimodal origin of autism in these patients. A greater understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying autism in TSC could help in devising targeted and potentially more effective treatment strategies.

TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (TAND) occur in the majority of those with TSC, and they have a significant impact on patients and their families, given the everyday impact of TAND on education, employment, family and social life. The potential benefits of better treatment for TAND therefore include reduction in health care demands and wider benefits for patients and their carers. We have planned a single-centre, two-arm, individually randomised, phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of everolimus versus placebo in the treatment of neurocognitive problems in patients with tuberous sclerosis. Everolimus is a licensed medicine in this patient group, but for a different target of effect. The present trial is a proof-of-principle study developed to provide effect size estimates which may be used to inform the design of subsequent trials. Forty-eight patients aged 16-60 years with tuberous sclerosis who have an IQ >60 and a significant deficit (at least -2 SD) in one or more primary outcome measures will be randomly allocated in a ratio of 2:1 to receive everolimus or placebo, respectively.
