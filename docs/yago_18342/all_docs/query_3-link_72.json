        "text": "Bhavani left us on the 15th of June last year and her passing away left a huge void not just among her family but among her numerous friends. So much so that even today no gathering seems complete without her presence; beautifully dressed and impeccably groomed, a lady and a woman of substance to her fingertips.\n\nBhavani was born to the Shanmugam family on the 5th of September 1934, and was the older of two girls in the family. Her father was a Barrister and Municipal Commissioner of Galle. After her early education here, she went on to graduate from Queen Mary’s College, India.\n\nShe was married to Justice Siva Selliah and had three children, a son Siva and two daughters, Selvi and Sivakami.\n\nAs a mother, she was the embodiment of love, affection and support until the very end. She was a pillar of strength and encouragement to her family and displayed selflessness in all her interactions throughout her life. She was a role model to her children and her large circle of friends, who were of all ages. Bhavani had the knack of establishing ties with different people of varying interests and ages and could converse on any subject. She was well informed, knowledgeable and a mine of information, be it local politics and business or\n\ninternational affairs.\n\nI count myself privileged to have known and associated with Bhavani and even today find myself wanting to live up to her high standards. Sincerity was essential to Bhavani as were principles and standards in life. She had no time for idle chatter or gossip and to be considered her friend was a compliment indeed."
