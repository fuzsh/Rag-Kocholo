        "text": "Full paper submissions are invited for the 2018 International Conference on Multidisciplinary Research to be held in Mauritius from 22nd to 23rd June 2018. This is an exceptional platform for researchers, academics, students, innovators, scientists and industry practitioners to discuss current research which is shaping a new world society. This conference will be a good platform to share research, innovations and best-practices where constructive feedback and engagement with domain experts is expected. Many topics of the multi-disciplinary nature as a response to everyday challenges faced in both developing and developed world contexts will be discussed. We encourage submissions of cross-disciplinary nature cutting across many disciplines/subject-areas. We encourage any submissions that present novel ideas, works-in-progress or any concepts that you think can benefit from inputs from experts. Students and/or emerging researchers are encouraged to participate."
