(The TNT gained notoriety in 1975 following its assassination of Tamil mayor of Jaffna Alfred Duraiyappah. However, it was struck a fatal blow in 1976, after its leader was arrested.) From its founding, the LTTE has sought to develop the image of an elite, professional and dedicated fighting force. This image was designed initially as much to distinguish the LTTE from other, better-established Tamil separatist groups as to intimidate its principal set of opponents: the Sri Lankan government and the countryâ€™s ethnic Sinhalese majority.\n\nA key moment in the development of the LTTE was the widespread ethnic riots that convulsed Sri Lanka in July 1983. The riots were sparked by an LTTE land mine ambush that killed 13 SLAF soldiers in Jaffna, and led to widespread attacks against Tamils. Thousands of Tamils who had shunned violence before were now drawn to LTTE after these incidents.\n\nDuring its opening period of operations, the organizationâ€™s tactic of choice was assassination. The LTTEâ€™s targeting efforts were directed principally against rival Tamils and Tamil and Sinhalese government officials and security forces. Later, as an almost logical extension of these calculated political killings, suicide bombing became the LTTE signature mode of attack.\n\nOver the years, LTTE suicide attacks have been carried out to support two distinctly different campaigns: a rural campaign (primarily against SLAF elements) and an urban campaign (against critical national infrastructure and VIPs.) Since many of the latter actions take place in and around Colombo and at times have caused significant numbers of collateral casualties, LTTE attacks against non-military targets are never (or rarely) claimed. The Tigers continue to insist that â€œit is not the policy of the LTTE to attack civilian targetsâ€For instance, it has never taken credit for the suicide truck bombing of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in January 1996, or the 1994 assasination of presidential candidate Gamini Dissanayake, which resulted in 54 killed and 72 injured.\n\nTIMELINE\n\nPRE-CIVIL WAR PHASE\n\n1975 - Liberation Tamil Tigers of Eelam (LTTE) founded as a successor to Tamil New Tigers (TNT). The TNT was started in 1972, soon after the promulgation of the Republican Constitution.\n\nThe LTTE initially carried out a campaign of violence against the state, particularly targeting policemen and also moderate Tamil politicians who attempted a dialogue with the government. Their first major operation was the assassination of the mayor of Jaffna, Alfred Duraiappah in 1975. In fact, the modus operandi of the early war was based on assassinations. The assassination in 1977 of a Tamil Member of Parliament, M. Canagaratnam, was carried out personally by Vellupillai Prabhakaran, the leader of the LTTE. Initially, the LTTE operated in cooperation with other Tamil militant groups which shared their same objectives\n\nCIVIL WAR STARTS\n\n1983 - In July 1983, the LTTE launched a deadly attack on the military in the north of the country, killing 13 soldiers. The government retaliated with riots in Colombo, the capital, and elsewhere. Between 400 and 3,000 Tamils were estimated to have been killed, and many more fled Sinhalese-majority areas. Large number of government forces are deployed in the north and east.This is usually considered the beginning of the civil war.\n\nThe LTTE womenâ€™s unit, Vituthalai Pulikal Makalir Munani (Women's Front of the Liberation Tigers), was formed in 1983, and women began combat training in 1985.\n\nThe first recruitment of child soldiers into LTTE also begins after the ethnic riots of July 1983. At this stage, LTTE chief Prabhakaran selected Basheer Kaka, an LTTE leader from the harbour city of Trincomalee, to establish a training base in the State of Pondicherry in India for recruits under 16. Initially, the child soldiers - affectionately referred to as 'Tiger cubs' - received non-military training, mostly primary education and physical exercise. By early 1984, the nucleus of the LTTE 'Baby Brigade' or 'Bakuts', was formed.\n\n1984 - The Sea Tigers, LTTEâ€™s navy, were officially founded in 1984. In the first years its primary task was smuggling personnel and equipment between the LTTE's bases in Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka, in particular Jaffna. As the Sea Tiger cadres gained experience it took on offensive operations against the Sri Lankan Navy.\n\n1985 - Talks to find a political solution to the conflict fail and conflict intensifies.\n\n1986 - In 1986, the LTTE broke from the ENLF and launched an armed attack on members and training camps of TELO, which at the time was the largest Tamil militant group in Sri Lanka.\n\nOver the next few months, virtually the entire TELO leadership and several hundred volunteers were hunted down, and the group ceased to be a potent force. A few months later, the LTTE attacked training camps of the EPRLF, forcing it to withdraw entirely from the Jaffna peninsula.\n\nThe LTTE then demanded that all remaining Tamil insurgents join the LTTE. With the major groups including the TELO and EPRLF eliminated, the remaining Tamil insurgent groups, numbering around 20, were then absorbed into the LTTE. This made Jaffna an LTTE dominated city. The effect of the attacks was that the LTTE consolidated the position as the main military group fighting for the cause of Tamil Eelam, with no credible rivals.\n\nIPKF (Indian Peacekeeping Force) PERIOD:\n\n1987\n\nIn 1987 the LTTE established the notorious Black Tigers, a unit of the LTTE responsible for conducting suicide attacks against political, economic and military targets, and launched its first suicide attack against a Sri Lanka Army camp, killing 40 soldiers. Since then they have carried out over 170 suicide attacks, more than any other organization in the world, and the suicide attack has become a trademark of the LTTE, and a characteristic of the civil war.\n\nIn 1987, government troops pushed the LTTE fighters to the northern city of Jaffna. In April 1987, the conflict exploded with ferocity, as both the government forces and the LTTE fighters engaged each other in a series of bloody operations.\n\nThe Sri Lankan military launched an offensive, called â€œOperation Liberationâ€ or â€œVadamarachchi Operationâ€, during May-June 1987, to regain the territory in Jaffna peninsula from the LTTE's control. This offensive marked the Sri Lankan military's first ever conventional warfare in Sri Lankan soil since independence. The military offensive was successful and the LTTE leader Prabhakaran and the Sea Tiger leader Soosai narrowly escaped from advancing troops at Valvettithurai.\n\nCampaign details:\n\nOn May 26, the army moved out of Thondamanaru accompanied by heavy aerial bombing and shelling, particularly in Valvettithurai. There was also military activity, bombing and shelling near the Jaffna Fort. By the 28th, Udupiddy and Valvettithurai had been recaptured. A column of soldiers took Nelliady and advanced northwards to Pt. Pedro. Another group of soldiers advanced eastwards towards Pt. Pedro by moving in three lines. The LTTE was not given the time to regroup or to put up fresh land mine barriers. The LTTE made a quick withdrawal abandoning its vehicles and a large quantity of arms.\n\nThis was a historic operation for many reasons. It marked many firsts for the security forces. Operation Liberation was the milestone which marked the first time the Sri Lankan security forces were engaged in conventional warfare. For the first time, the three arms of the army, infantry, support and logistics were organised into two battalions which were commanded by Brigadier Kobbekaduwa and Colonel Wimalarathne. The operation also marked the advent of electronic warfare and the helicopter gunships of the Air force were also effectively used for the first time.\n\nAbout 8000 troops from the Gemunu Watch and Gajaba Regiments were involved in the recapture of Vadamarachchi. The L.T.T.E. Colonel Wimalarathne would later admit they did not know at the time how close they were to capturing LTTE Leader Prabhakaran in his native Valvettithurai. Due to some delays in sealing the area, Prabhakaran along with current Sea Tiger Leader Soosai were able to make a daring escape from advancing troops. Two days after the operation began, General Officer Commanding, Joint Operations Command, General Cyril Ranatunga called a halt to the offensives and doled out rice, sugar and dhal to the people of the peninsula, who had been displaced by the fighting and had taken shelter in schools and other public buildings. By June 1, 1987 the whole Vadamarachchi sector was under the control of the Sri Lankan security forces.\n\nFaced with growing anger amongst its own Tamils, and a flood of refugees, India intervened directly in the conflict for the first time by initially airdropping food parcels into Jaffna to aid the Tigers while they were under siege by the SLA.\n\nJul - After subsequent negotiations, India and Sri Lanka entered into an agreement whereby Sri Lanka agreed to a federal structure, which would grant limited autonomy to the Tamils in the northeast, and the Tamil militant groups would all lay down their arms. India was to send a peacekeeping force, named the IPKF to Sri Lanka to enforce the disarmament.\n\nOct - LTTE reneges on the accord and begins three years of battles with the IPKF that kill more than 1,000 Indian troops.\n\nA deliberate policy of recruiting women and children into LTTE cadres was initiated after the signing of the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) Accord in 1987, when the LTTE decided to take on the Indian Peace Keeping Force sent to the Island nation as part of the agreement. This was to offset a severe shortage of manpower, because of ever increasing casualties and the escalation of the conflict.\n\nAs tensions grew, the LTTE declared a policy of \"non-cooperation\" with the IPKF on October 5th , and went on to kill an estimated 167 people over the next 24 hours. LTTE cadres killed 42 people in an ambush on a train near Batticaloa, shot dead over 40 Sinhalese civilians in their homes in the city, killed 29 in an ambush on a bus near Lahugala and murdered 35 fisherman in Eravur. By the end of the week, over 5000 Sinhalese civilians fled their homes and took refuge in Temples and army camps.\n\nThe result was that the LTTE now found itself engaged in military conflict with the Indian Army, and launched their first attack on an Indian army rations truck on October 8, killing five Indian para-commandos who were on board by strapping burning tires around their necks. The Indian Army launched number of assaults on the LTTE, including a month-long campaign dubbed Operation Pawan to win control of the Jaffna peninsula from the LTTE.\n\nCampaign details: Initially the Indians intended to surprise the LTTE leadership which was believed to be operating from the Jaffna University premises. The plan was to drop commandos into the university premises to take out the LTTE leadership while infantry columns would move out from Palaly and link with the commandos in the city. The initial heliborne assault involved a company from the 10th Para battalion. However the LTTE had prior knowledge of this assault since they were listening into the Indian communications. When commandos landed in a soccer field they were immediately pinned down by heavy machine gunfire. Two helicopters were damaged and six commandos killed instantly. A second wave of choppers containing a platoon from the 13 Sikh Light Infantry came under more intense fire, making further reinforcements impossible: all but one of the Sikhs perished. Their battalion commander, Lt. Col. Dalbir Singh, personally led a column of T-72 tanks the next morning to relieve his beleaguered men.\n\nAfter the failure of the commando assault, the infantry brigades slowly fought their way into Jaffna City over the next 16 days. Because of heavy LTTE resistance, two more brigades were rushed to Jaffna before the end of the battle.\n\nBy the end of November, Jaffna was completely in IPKF hands.\n\n1988\n\nDec - Ranasinghe Premadasa is elected president after promising to send Indian troops home and begin talks with LTTE.\n\n1990\n\nThe Indian intervention was also unpopular amongst the Sinhalese majority, and the IPKF became bogged down in the fighting with the Tamil Tigers for over 2 years, experiencing heavy losses. Following Gandhiâ€™s defeat in Indian parliamentary elections in December 1989, the new prime MinisterV. P. Singh ordered the withdrawal of the IPKF.\n\nThe last members of the IPKF, which was estimated to have numbered over 50,000 at its peak, left the country in 1990 upon request of the Sri Lankan government. A shaky peace initially held between the government and the LTTE, and peace talks progressed towards providing devolution for Tamils in the north and east of the country.\n\nThe LTTEâ€™s child soldiers saw their first recorded major action on November 22, 1990 in an attack on the Mankulam army camp. Nearly a third of the Sri Lankan troops were killed and the camp was vacated by troops after two days of clashes.\n\nEELAM WAR II PHASE\n\nEelam War II is the name given to the second phase of armed conflict between Sri Lankan military and the LTTE. This phase started after the failure of peace talks between the Premadasa government and the LTTE and was initiated by the LTTE who massacred almost 600 Tamil and Muslim police personnel after they were ordered by the Premadasa government to surrender to the LTTE.\n\n1990\n\nJun - Talks fail as LTTE overruns police stations in east. The truce was broken on June 10, 1990.\n\nFearing defeat in the scheduled elections for the North Eastern Provincial Council, the LTTE pulled out of the talks, carrying out a series of attacks beginning on June 11, 1990, which left an estimated 450 people dead within the first week\n\nOct - The LTTE in October expelled all the 28,000 Muslims residing in Jaffna.\n\n1991\n\nMay - Suspected female Tiger suicide bomber kills Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. Support for the LTTE in India dropped considerably after the assassination by an LTTE woman suicide bomber, Thenmuli Rajaratnam.\n\nJuly- First battle of Elephant Pass. The largest battle of the war was in July 1991, when the army's Elephant Pass (Alimankada) base, which controlled access to the Yapanaya (Jaffna) peninsula, was surrounded by 5,000 LTTE troops. More than 2,000 died on both sides in the month-long siege, before 10,000 government troops arrived to relieve the base.\n\nDetails of battle: On July 10, 1991, the LTTE launched a massive attack at Elephant Pass. The battle for Elephant Pass was the most violent and bloody confrontation that ever took place between the LTTE and the Sri Lankan Army. The LTTE had previously surrounded the base and blocked off routs north and south so no reinforcements could come in. Also at the beginning of July the LTTE moved anti-aircraft guns close to the base so no helicopters can bring in supplies. Thus the 800 troops stationed in the base were trapped. The assault came from the south. On the first day the LTTE captured a few bunkers held by Sri Lankan troops. The LTTE used in the attack steel plated earth moving vehicles and tractors. They fired hundreds of motor rounds on the positions of the armed forces. By the next day the second-in-command of the base was killed in a mortar attack.\n\nHelicopters were not able to land at the base because of heavy enemy fire. Eventually, the Rest House camp in the southern sector of the base, fell into the hands of the LTTE. Sustaining heavy losses, the Sri Lankan troops fell back to the rear positions. Fierce fighting continued for four days before a rescue force was sent. A huge force of 10,000 soldiers was sent. An amphibious landing was conducted at Vettilaikerni, which was just 12 kilometers east of the base. However, so much resistance was encountered from the Tigers that it took them 18 days to reach the Elephant Pass base.\n\nWith the heavy losses in men and material, the troops finally reached the Elephant Pass base, on the evening of August 3. The fighting continued until August 9, when finally the LTTE made a tactical withdrawal. The LTTE suffered 573 Tigers killed according to Tamil sources, but according to SLA sources over 1,000 of them were killed. The Army had 202 dead according to government sources, but according to LTTE sources over 400 were killed. Estimates in later years put the number of dead on both sides to be 2,000 killed. The president called the battle the 'Mother of all Battles', and the LTTE was defeated. However 8 and a half years later the base will be attacked again and that time the Tigers will overrun and take the base\n\nApart from the battle of the Fort, it was the longest single battle ever fought between the combatants, which lasted for nearly 31 days.\n\nChild soldiers saw their second major action during the attack on the strategic Elephant Pass Military Complex on July 10, 1991. The Tigers suffered heavy casualties in this attack. An estimated 550 LTTE cadres, including children, were killed in these clashes.\n\nLearning from its failures during the July 1991 operations, the LTTE changed the composition of its attacking groups. It put the child cadres together with elite Black Tigers cadres and scored astonishing results, one in 1993 and another in 1996â€“â€“two army/navy complexes were overrun and an estimated US $ 100 million-worth arms and ammunition were seized by the Tigers. In the 1996 amphibious attack on the military complex in Mullaithivu, child soldiers shot dead some 300 troops after they were disarmed.\n\n1992\n\nFeb - Another series of government offensives failed to capture Jaffna.\n\nAug - Lt. General Denzil Kobbekaduwa together with Major General Vijaya Wimalaratne and Rear Admiral Mohan Jayamaha died on August 8, 1992 at Araly (Aeraella) point Jaffna due to a LTTE land mine blast, which affected the morale of the military badly.\n\n1993\n\nMay - The LTTE scored a major victory when one of their suicide bombers killed Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe Premadasa in May 1993.\n\n1994\n\nThe fighting was briefly halted in 1994 following the election of Chandrika Kumaratunga as President of Sri Lanka and the onset of peace talks\n\n1995\n\nJan - Government of President Chandrika Kumaratunga and rebels agree to stop fighting and talk.\n\nEELAM WAR III PHASE\n\nEelam War III is the name given to the third phase of armed conflict between Sri Lankan military and the LTTE. After the period of 100 days cease-fire the hostilities broke out on the 19th of April 1995.\n\nApr - Truce ends following the sinking two Sri Lanka Navy boats in April 1995 by the LTTE.\n\nOct â€“ The Sri Lankan military launches Operation Riviresa (Operation Sun rays).\n\nThis was a combined military operation launched by the Sri Lankan Military in Jaffna. Starting on the 17 October 1995 the primary objective of the operation was the capture of the town of Jaffna and rest of the Jaffna peninsula from LTTE terrorists.\n\nOperation details:\n\nRiviresa, the largest military operation at the time, would make military history as the first time in Sri Lanka that divisional level formations were used in a campaign. Three divisions moved out of the Palaly base and advanced through two routes to Jaffna. Deputy Minister of Defence, Anuruddha Ratwatte was in the midst of the action, with the three divisions reaching Jaffna in 50 days.\n\nThe SLA launched a two directional attack that headed directly to the town of Jaffna capturing key crossroads along the way. The LTTE had prepared for the attack in advance by mining all roads int the peninsula and by creating defences in depth with additional cadres from the eastern province. On the 22nd of November 1995, Valikamam was cut off from Vadamarachchi and Tenamarachchi areas. However an intense battle had to be fought to evict the remaining cadres from the Jaffna town.\n\nThe LTTE would however deny the military the full joy of victory by ordering a total evacuation of the civilian population. Though unnoticed by the local and foreign media at that time, this exodus would be recorded as one of the largest civilian displacements in 24 hours ever recorded in recent times. Some 500,000 people left the peninsula on the LTTEâ€™s orders that day in October. The Tigers wanted the Sri Lankan forces to occupy a Jaffna without its people.\n\n1996\n\nJan - Tiger suicide bombers blow up central bank building. More than 100 killed and about 1,400 hurt.\n\nJuly- LTTE rebels seized SLAF military base at Mullativu during a week of intense fighting.\n\nBattle details: The Liberation Tigers launched their assault at 1.30am on the 18 July, 1996. Mr. Velupillai Pirabakaran had been personally involved in the planning and coordination of the operation code named 'Unceasing Waves'. As the LTTE commanders had expected, Sri Lankan relief forces immediately rushed to assist from Vettilaikerni and Trincomalee, the nearby naval bases. They met stiff resistance from Sea Tiger units.\n\nAfter 8 hours of heavy fighting, the Tiger forces reached the centre of the camp, after overrunning forward defense lines and clusters of mini-camps. The Tiger units then concentrated on attacking the artillery sites and armories. These were captured within an hour of intense fighting.\n\nThe attack was paused short of the very heart of the base, which was the operational head quarters of the 6th Battalion, Wijebahu Regiment. The LTTE commanders leading the attack were ordered to regroup their forces and to await nightfall before storming the central camp.\n\nIn the meantime, the Sri Lankans dispatched a few hundred troops in a rescue operation code named 'Thrivida Pahara'. The troops were airlifted into Alampil, an area close to the Mullaitivu base. This effectively forced the Tiger forces to fight on two fronts.\n\nThe Tiger units launched a holding attack on the relief force and concentrated on the central camp. In the evening of July 18, the entire camp fell to the Tiger forces. At the same time, the Sri Lankan relief force was surrounded by Tiger Special Forces units.\n\nThe Sri Lankans continued to attempt to land more troops to bolster their relief force commandos. Fresh troops were airlifted by helicopter into Alampil. On the evening of 19 July, a Sri Lankan naval craft, the 'Ranaviru' which arrived to establish a supply line, was attacked by Sea Tigers off the Mullaitivu coast. The vessel was sunk along with it's entire 40-man crew.\n\nOn 20 July, an Mi-17 type helicopter was severely damaged by Tiger fire. The Sri Lankan's relief mission ground to a standstill. The Sri Lankan military command changed their strategy, launching an all out air assault, using Israeli made Kfir and Argentinean Puccara aircraft.\n\nWhile these aircraft bombed the surrounding area, the Sri Lankan navy's Israeli made Dvora fast attack craft attempted to establish a supply line to the relief force. After meeting heavy resistance from Sea Tiger units and Tiger anti-aircraft troops, the Sri Lankans were forced to call off their attempts, after landing only a few more troops.\n\nEven though the LTTE managed to prevent the enemy from landing more troops on 22 and 23 July, the Sri Lankan military brought in a more troops by sea on 25 July. When these relief units realised the intensity of Tiger resistance and the severity of the situation on the ground, they linked up with the original relief force and withdrew. This concluded the battle.\n\nDuring this successful engagement, the LTTE lost 332 fighters whilst the Sri Lankan army lost at least 1200 troops including some senior officers. The Sri Lankans also lost 100 troops from the relief force. The entire armoury of the Mullaitivu camp, including 120mm artillery was captured intact.\n\nIn the 1996 amphibious attack on the military complex in Mullaithivu, child soldiers shot dead some 300 troops after they were disarmed.\n\n1997\n\nOct - United States declares LTTE a terrorist group. LTTE bombs World Trade Centre in Colombo, killing 15.\n\n1998\n\nJan - Sri Lanka outlaws the LTTE after suicide attack on country's holiest Buddhist shrine, the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy.\n\nNov - The Voice of Tigers (VoT) radio said in its night broadcast today that aircraft of the Air Tigers sprinkled flowers on the LTTE's Heroes' memorials in the Vanni this evening during the Maaveerar day ceremonies. (Note: This might just have been propaganda, but is also seen as first confirmation of Air Tigers display of air operations (if true))\n\nThe radio did not specify the number of aircraft which flew today or whether they were helicopters or fixed wing planes.\n\nThe announcement comes after weeks of speculation that the Liberation Tigers had established an air wing, following press reports that unidentified aircraft had been spotted in the Vanni.\n\nDespite denials by the Sri Lankan Deputy Defence Minister that the reports were untrue, defence analysts said there was credible evidence that the Tigers were in possession of at least one aircraft.\n\n1999\n\nDec - Kumaratunga survives LTTE suicide bomb attack, loses one eye, spurring a sympathy vote analysts say helped her win re-election.\n\n2000\n\nApril â€“ Second battle of Elephant Pass\n\nDetails of battle: On April 22, 2000 the LTTE attacked the twin complexes of Iyakachchi and Elephant Pass, pounding the government positions. As it happened, the LTTE made the EPS takeover simple and straight. Rather than flush out the camp by employing its earlier tactics of deploying suicide-cadres on the camp boundaries, followed by an intense attack, the Tigers got EPS without even gettin g close to its boundaries. For the Army made a pull-out to \"save its troops for a later attack.\"\n\nThe Mullaitivu model of overrunning an Army camp has clearly become passe. Indicating both a change in tactics and, at a larger level, a change in the very nature of the armed conflict, the Tigers lay siege on military positions north of the EPS. Supply lines were cut off and a slow choking of the base was in prospect when the northern road link from Iyakachchi to government-held Jaffna was cut away. An alternative supply route was opened, but military sources said that could at best be temporary.\n\nIn terms of the nature of the warfare, the situation has changed significantly since the early 1990s with the weapons that lead to a stand-off turning to be crucial. Once an army position came within the LTTE's artillery range, the situation turned problematic. As the security forces exceed the rebels in sheer numbers, the losses are also significantly higher on the government side for every successful strike by the Tigers.\n\nLTTE's special forces and commando units stormed into the Iyakkachchi military base in the early hours of the morning in a multi-prolonged assault and overran the well-fortified camp after several hours of intense fighting. LTTE commandos who penetrated the central base destroyed several artillery pieces, tanks, armored vehicles and ammunition dumps. With the fall of Yakachchi and with the collapse of the command structure of its defending troops, the LTTE combat units moved swiftly and stormed into Elephant Pass from different directions. By late in the evening the military was in full retreat from the camps toward the city of Jaffna to fortify their positions.\n\nThe LTTE captured: three long-range 152MM artillery pieces, two 122MM artillery pieces, twelve 120MM heavy mortars, one 25MM canon, several 50 caliber machine guns, hundreds of rocket propelled grenades and thousands of automatic rifles. The Tigers also captured several armored vehicles, tanks, military trucks, bulldozers and high-tech communication systems. The battle of Elephant Pass will be remembered as the bigest military debacle in the history of the Sri Lankan military. In the end 204 soldiers and 150 rebels had been killed. Another 357 soldiers were wounded.\n\nThe fighting continued until mid-May for the controlle of the Jaffna peninsula and by May 9, the deputy defence minister reported that 358 soldiers were killed, 2,368 wounded and 349 missing since the battle for Elephant Pass started April 22. The LTTE forces were stopped just 45 kilometers east of Jaffna.\n\nOn September 3, 2000 the army mounted a counter-offensive to try and retake some of the LTTE-held territory east of the city of Jaffna, but after advancing a few kilometers they were beaten back by the Tigers. In all 114 soldiers and 200 Tamil rebels had been killed in the Army offensive.\n\nMay - Norway's special envoy for peace, Erik Solheim, begins talks with Sri Lankan leaders.\n\n2001\n\nHopes for peace gained ground as the LTTE declared a unilateral ceasefire in December 2000, but they canceled it on April 24, 2001 and launched another offensive against the government.\n\nJuly - LTTE carried out a devastating suicide attack on Bandaranaike International Airport, destroying eight of the air force's planes (2 IAI Kfirs, 1 Mil-17, 1 Mil-24, 3 K-8 trainers, 1 MiG-27) and four Sri Lankan Airlines planes (2 Airbus A330s, 1 A340 and 1 A320), dampening the economy and causing tourism, a vital foreign exchange earner for the government, to plummet.\n\nDetails of attack:\n\nA suicide squad of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) staged an audacious attack on Sri Lanka's Bandaranaike international airport and the adjoining air force base at Katunayake on 24 July 2001. In three waves, a highly trained and heavily armed 14-man squad penetrated the 800-acre high security complex and destroyed or damaged 26 commercial and military aircraft. The attack is the biggest terrorist operation so far launched by the LTTE and the most destructive terrorist attack in the history of aviation. The suicide dimension - 14 members targeting 26 aircraft - made the operation cost effective.\n\nThe approach\n\nThe suicide squad escorted by an LTTE intelligence team arrived in a Mitsubishi Rosa at a playground near the target location on the eve of the attack. Usually LTTE intelligence teams living in the south of the country provide suicide members with security, board, lodging, transport, communication and intelligence support to accomplish the mission. Although the suicide squad and the intelligence team were young Tamils, they clapped hands to Sinhala music to deceive the locals that they were Sinhalese. After joining the suicide squad for a final meal, the intelligence team returned to its safe house with the intention of continuing its intelligence gathering and other support operations. However, the recovery of a balaclava and night vision devices suggest that either the intelligence team escorted the suicide squad into the complex or was inside the complex providing updated intelligence until the suicide squad was launched.\n\nAfter changing from civilian clothing to military uniform, the suicide squad entered the international airport and the adjoining air force base through a path situated at a rear entrance to the playground, which was used by air force personnel going on leave. The suicide squad then passed by a sewage farm, the base HQ, base commander's residence, officers' mess and the married officers' quarters. After entry, two civilians intending to report the suspicious gathering of the youths, met two airmen on a regular perimeter patrol who came and examined three bags left behind by the suicide squad. After examining the bags containing uniforms, food and clothing the airmen surmised that they must have been left behind by tourists.\n\nAfter cutting a hole in the chain link fence controlling access to the Vulnerable Area (V-area), the squad entered the parking zone and hangers. To reach the fixed-wing aircraft and the helicopter squadron located in opposite directions, the suicide squad split into two groups and began to move along a storm water drain. The journey, especially the entry into the V-area, was facilitated by a routine nationwide power cut that began at 9.45 pm to reduce electricity consumption.\n\nThe attack\n\nAt 3.50 am, the two suicide groups emerged out of the storm water drain. Standing 700m apart on the air force side of the runway, the two groups fired at both the military aircraft parked on the apron as well as into the hangers housing additional aircraft. They used six light anti-tank weapons, three rocket-propelled grenade launchers (RPGs) and one 40mm grenade launcher, as well as nine T-56 assault rifles and three general-purpose machine guns (GPMGs). Although the suicide squad failed to penetrate the hangers, the attack destroyed eight aircraft on the apron and damaged two in the hangers. Other than firing into the hangers with the GPMGs, the squad fired the stand-off weapons on to the top of the hangers. After an hour of fierce combat, three airmen and eight suicide squad members were dead.\n\nAs the resistance against the attack mounted from the airbase, the surviving six-member suicide squad crossed the runaway into the international airport. After challenging six airmen guarding the runway, they fired at an oil tank first with GPMG rounds and, once it started to leak, with a 40mm grenade launcher. The blaze destroyed a nearby A-330 Airbus. Of the six suicide members, two members seeking to destroy aircraft of Sri Lankan Airlines were killed by a team of airmen. After a lone suicide bomber placed an explosive charge on an A-330, the explosion ripped off its two wings from the fuselage and the aircraft caught fire. Thereafter, he joined the other three bombers approaching the terminal building. While one suicide bomber exploded inside the departure cargo, the remaining three climbed the air-conditioned duct entering the duty free complex. One climbed on to the roof of the terminal building and fired an RPG on to an A-340 and destroyed it: two others died in the chiller room. At all stages of the operation, they demonstrated intimate familiarity of the airport layout and structure.\n\nAfter five hours of fierce fighting, 26 aircraft had been destroyed or damaged, including two Airbus-320s and one Airbus-340 that were damaged by friendly fire. Six airmen were killed and eight wounded, while one commando was killed by friendly fire and four soldiers were wounded. No tourists were injured. Three Sri Lankan civilians including one TV journalist and one Russian engineer were injured.\n\n2001 CEASEFIRE PHASE\n\nIn 2001 following the September 11th attacks on the United States and the subsequent launch of the War on Terror, the LTTE unexpectedly dropped its demand for a separate state, which had never been accepted by the government or the island's Sinhalese majority. Instead, they stated that a form of regional autonomy would meet their demands. The Sri Lankan government had previously invited Norway to mediate in the dispute, yet until then, they were unsuccessful in halting the fighting between the sides.\n\n2002 PEACE PROCESS PHASE\n\n2002\n\nFeb - Government and LTTE sign Norwegian-brokered ceasefire, laying groundwork for direct peace talks. The two sides formalized a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on February 22, 2002 and signed a permanent ceasefire agreement (CFA).\n\nAs part of the agreement, Norway and the other Nordic countries agreed to jointly monitor the ceasefire through the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission. While the agreement largely held, the LTTE carried out numerous killings of members of rival Tamil groups, including over 100 members of the EPDP,hundreds of SL military intelligent members and other civilians, drawing criticism from the government and international monitors.\n\nFollowing the signing of the ceasefire agreement, commercial air flights to Jaffna began and the LTTE opened the key A9 highway, which linked government controlled area in the south with Jaffna and ran through LTTE territory, allowing civilian traffic through the Vanni region for the first time in many years, but only after paying a tax to the LTTE. Many foreign countries also offered substantial financial support if peace was achieved and optimism grew that an end to the decades long conflict was in sight.\n\nDec - Tigers give up demand for a separate state and agree to work with government towards devolution of power. During the talks, both sides agreed to the principle of a federal solution and the Tigers dropped their long standing demand for separate state. This was a key compromise from the LTTE, which had always insisted on an independent Tamil state and it also represented a compromise from the government, which had seldom agreed to more than minimal devolution. Both sides also exchanged prisoners of war for first time.\n\n2003\n\nApr - Tigers pull out after six rounds of talks, saying not enough being done to rebuild war-hit Tamil areas.\n\nThere was also political uncertainly in south of the country, after President Kumaratunga suspended the government of the Prime Minister Wickremasinghe in 2004, accusing him of being too soft on the LTTE. Yet throughout all this, no significant military engagements took place.\n\n2004\n\nMar - There was a major fracturing between the northern and eastern wings of the LTTE. Colonel Karuna, the Eastern commander of the LTTE and one of Prabakaran's trusted lieutenants, pulled 5,000 eastern troops out of the LTTE, claiming insufficient resources and power were being given to Tamils of the eastern part of the island.\n\nThe split in the LTTE in 2004 marked a turning point in the region, and in the LTTEâ€™s history. With its Batticaloa-Ampara â€˜commanderâ€™ â€˜Colonelâ€™ Karuna forming his own military front, the Tamil National Front (TNF), and later a political party, the Tamileela Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal (TMVP), the outfit lost its supremacy in the East.\n\nThe Karuna Faction, as it has now been dubbed, continues to maintain a stronghold in the southeast of Sri Lanka with a force estimated to number a few hundred. With rumored government support, they continue to regularly skirmish with the LTTE.\n\nDec - Indian Ocean tsunami kills at least 35,000 people in Sri Lanka, affecting both Tamil and Sinhalese areas.\n\n2005\n\nAug - Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar, an ethnic Tamil who opposed a separate state for the minority, is assassinated at his home (Aug. 12) by suspected LTTE snipers.\n\nHis assassination led to the marginalization of the LTTE from the international community, and is thought to be the instant when the LTTE lost much of its sympathy in the eyes of foreign nations.\n\nNov - Former Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapakse elected president after Tigers boycott polls. The LTTE ordered a boycott of the elections amongst Tamil voters in the East and North of Sri Lanka, and forcibly prevented votes from going to polling booths. Mahinda Rajapakse eventually won the election by a narrow majority, helped by the LTTE boycott, as most Tamils were expected to vote for Wickramasinghe.\n\nDec â€“ In the 2005 Presidential Elections race, outgoing President Kumaratunga's successor Mahinda Rajapaksa campaigned on a platform of being tougher on the LTTE while Prime Minister Wickramasinghe vowed to restart the stalled peace talks. The LTTE action was condemned by the United States, who stated that it was an \"interference in the democratic process (and) a significant portion of Sri Lanka's people were unable to express their views\".\n\nDays after Rajapakse's election victory, a new round of violence erupted. Beginning in December 2005, Tiger rebels launch first major attack since the truce, killing at least 12 Sri Lankan navy sailors. A series of attacks followed. The LTTE resumed attacks against government troops, carrying out a number of roadside bombings which killed around 150 government troops. Mine attacks by suspected Tigers kill 39 soldiers\n\nDetails of attack on Sri Lankan navy boat: A fishing boat crammed with explosives rammed one of two patrol vessels as they left the port of Trincomalee.\n\n2006\n\nJan - Violence escalates in the north and east, raising fears of a return to civil war.\n\nFeb - Tigers and government agree to respect 2002 ceasefire, with officials from both sides meeting in Switzerland for peace talks.\n\nApr â€“ A second round of peace talks is postponed as the two sides argue over transport and security. Major upsurge in violence. Government launches air strikes against Tamil targets after suicide bomber injures army chief and kills nine civilians in Colombo.\n\nAn LTTE Black Tiger suicide bomber attempted to assassinate the commander of the Sri Lanka Army, Lieutenant General Sarath Fonseka in April 2006. Lt. Gen. Fonseka and twenty-seven others were injured, while ten people were killed in the attack.\n\nThe army responds by attacking rebel bases. For the first time since the 2001 ceasefire, the Sri Lanka Air Force carried out aerial assaults on rebel positions in the north-eastern part of the island nation in retaliation for the attack.\n\nMay â€“ Sea Tigers attack a naval convoy using suicide boats to ram and sink a navy patrol craft, killing at least 17 sailors. Five Tigers ships are destroyed in the battle, killing 50 rebels in the worst military confrontation since the truce. The government response with air strikes on rebel positions.\n\nDetails of battle: It all began when a naval flotilla escorting the personnel - carrier ship to KKS from Trincomalee came under heavy attack by a sea tigers unit. The sea battle resulted in the destruction of two â€œDvorasâ€ and the deaths of at least twenty - one persons from both the Navy and tigers.\n\nThe MV â€œPearl cruise IIâ€ is a merchant vessel now used by the navy to transport men and materials by sea. The ship had started off from Trincomalee at dawn with 710 security personnel on board. These included a number of army and air force personnel in addition to navy sailors.\n\nThe bulk of the men were security personnel returning from home to duty. Most of them were in civilian dress and were unarmed. The â€œpearl cruise II â€ was provided security by six Fast attack craft and one gun boat.\n\nThe naval flotilla was in Northern waters off the coast of Vadamaratchy East when a fleet of eighteen Sea tiger and black sea tiger boats started out from the Chundikkulam - Challai sea tiger base. They approached the naval convoy from the rear.\n\nThe sea tiger boats were equipped with 20 mm, 23 mm and .50 calibre guns. They also had powerful outboard motors affixed to the boats. This enabled them to move really fast. It is estimated that they were sailing at 30 - 35 knots top speed.\n\nTwo FAC ships and the gunboat were sailing ahead of the personnel carrier. Four â€œDvorasâ€ were following behind. The three vessels in front had gone too far ahead when the tigers struck .\n\nThe four Dvoras reportedly sped up and offered resistance to the LTTE. All four were modelled on Israeli proto-types and assembled in Colombo dockyards The vessels were P- 418, P - 420. P- 421, and P - 497 respectively.They were commanded by Lt Cmdr Edirisinghe (P - 418), Lt Cndr Wijewardene (P- 420), Lt. Walgampaya (P - 421 ) and Lt. Rathnatilleke (P - 497 ) respectively.\n\nThe â€œPearl Cruise IIâ€ remained virtually isolated when the sea skirmish began. P - 418 and P - 420 were in the vanguard and bore the brunt of marine combat against the sea tigers.\n\nThe sea battle ensued at a point about 30 nautical miles to the South - East of Point Pedro. The time was around 4. 30 to 4.35 pm.\n\nThere were two Scandinavian ceasefire monitors accompanying the convoy. One was Ilkka Happlina the head of Trincomalee SLMM division who was on the â€œPearl Cruise IIâ€. The other was Jaffna SLMM division deputy head Lars Bleymann who was on the P - 421 Dvora. Both vessels were flying the SLMM flag to indicate that monitors were aboard.\n\nMeanwhile some sea tiger boats tried to surround the lone personnel carrier vessel at mid sea. Though the tigers could have destroyed and sunk the ship the objective seemed to be that of seizing the vessel with its crew and passengers.A stand - off at sea was on.\n\nThe fact that the ship had a ceasefire monitor from Finland on board may also have contributed towards the tigerâ€™s reluctance to attack the ship forcefully. Six of the LTTE boats were packed with explosives and manned by black sea tigers. Ramming the suicide boats into the ship would have been simple. Yet it was not done.\n\nWith the four Dvora fast attack craft vessels engaging the sea tigers at sea the tide turned. The passenger ferry was instructed to sail on through international waters towards Indian waters. The three vessels that had gone ahead were also asked to turn back and follow the passenger ferry. Two Dvoras on patrol in North - Western waters near Neduntheevu or Delft were also instructed to turn around to help their beleaguered comrades\n\nThe SLMM headquarters in Colombo was furious at the threat to its members. Oslo too was angered. Massive pressure was exerted on the LTTE in Kilinochchi and abroad. The tigers were pressurised to call off its boats and let the â€œPearl Cruiserâ€ proceed safely.\n\nMeanwhile the personnel carrier was moving away fast towards Indian waters. The â€œMV Pearl Cruise IIâ€ crossed the International Maritime Boundaty Line and reached Indian sanctuary.\n\nAt this point of time a desperate Government in Colombo contacted New Delhi urgently. Indian assistance was requested to rescue the ship from LTTE clutches and escort it to KKS or Trincomalee.\n\nAccording to informed diplomatic sources India was prepared to provide security to Galle but not to Trinco or KKS due to the possibility of getting drawn into possible conflict. New Delhi while ready to help Colombo out was not ready to risk its personnel or get dragged into unnecessary confrontation with the LTTE.\n\nIndia however said that if the LTTE entered Indian waters in pursuit of the passenger ferry their navy and possibly air force would retaliate against the tigers. Such an eventuality never arose because the LTTE never were in hot pursuit.\n\nAn Indian coast guard ship came close to the â€œMV Pearl Cruise IIâ€ ready to provide assistance and protection. Indian Navy and Air Force were also alerted but not deployed due to the tigers giving up pursuit.\n\nIt is possible that the LTTE did not pursue the ship due to several reasons. The tiger boats were engaged in combat. The LTTE had no intention of getting into Indian waters and possibly confront the Indian navy or coast guard. There was also the reluctance to attack a passenger ship with unarmed personnel and a truce monitor on board.\n\nLater tiger political chief Thamilselvan was to tell SLMM head Ulf Henricsson in Kilinochchi that the LTTE had let the â€œMV Pearl cruise IIâ€ escape because a Scandinavian monitor was aboard.\n\nMeanwhile the raging sea battle was ending after nearly 80 to 90 minutes. The Lankan air force too got into the act in the final phase by sending Mi 24 helicopter gunships. The Mi 24 copters were of little utilitarian value as it was now dusk and the battle virtually over. The LTTE boats were returning to base in Chundikulam - Chalai.\n\nThe personnel carrier had reached international waters with an Indian coast guard vessel close by and a naval ship looming on the horizon. The Lankan air force helicopters were trying to inflict damage. Norway and the SLMM was exerting strong pressure. The tigers had put two Dvoras out of action. At least one tiger boat was hit. So the LTTE called off the sea - borne operation and withdrew.\n\nThe personnel carrier ship which reached Indian waters remained at sea for a while. Indian ships stood guard. Meanwhile Colombo had started reprisal bombing and shelling on LTTE controlled areas in the North and East. It appeared that tiger fighting was over for the day.\n\nThe SLMM also obtained guarantes from the LTTE that the â€œPearl cruise IIâ€ will not be targetted when returning.According to informed diplomatic sources Indian ships provided â€œquiet coverâ€ to the Lankan ship to reach Lankan waters off the Jaffna peninsula .\n\nThe personnel carrier first tried to reach Trincomalee during night but thereafter the ship proceeded towards KKS. The plans were changed because tigers had assured the SLMM that it would not be harmed.The â€œPearl Cruise IIâ€ arrived at about 1, 30 pm on May 12th morning near KKS.\n\nThe navy suffered the destruction of one Dvora. P- 418 was sunk by the tigers. It is said that the vessel commanded by Prasanna Edirisinghe had put up a heroic fight. It was responsible for hitting a tiger boat and staving off the sea tigers for quite some time. This enabled the passenger ferry with 710 men to escape.\n\nP- 418 had fifteen crew and another officer Lt. Ratnaike aboard in addition to Edirisenghe. All seventeen were killed. Six navy boats conducted searches and after 36 hours recovered seven bodies.\n\nP - 420 commanded by Wijewardene was also badly damaged. At one point it was thiought that the boat was about to sink. An airborne â€œcasevacâ€ (Casualty evacuation) mission was undertaken near Point Pedro to rescue captain and crew. The Dvora however did not sink and was towed back to KKS. It is extensively damaged and would require much refurbishing to be â€œship shapeâ€ again.\n\nP - 497 was also damaged but remains sea worthy. P - 421 that had a monitor aboard has some minor damage. Two sailors on board were injured. The injuries on the other two ships are not known.\n\nThe LTTE says it has lost four tigers while two were injured. Three of the killed tigers were women . All four killed were promoted posthumously by the LTTE. Their rank, nom de guerre , real names and hometowns are -\n\n1. Lt. Col Pulichelvi - Jenita Pushparaja - Point Pedro.\n\n2. Lt. Col Anbuvili - Amuthasumana Nageswaran - Aaliyawalai.\n\n3. Lt. Col . Kaviyalagi - Shanthini Pedurupillai - Manatkadu (vadamaratchy east)\n\n4. Major.

(June 15)\n\nThe assassination of Sri Lankas third highest-ranking army officer and Deputy Chief of Staff General Parami Kulatunga on June 26, 2006 by an LTTE suicide bomber. The government of India also condemned this murder and further stated the country's stand against the struggle of terrorism.\n\nEELAM WAR IV PHASE:\n\nEelam War IV is the name given to the fourth phase of armed conflict. Renewed hostilities began on the July 26, 2006 when Sri Lanka Air Force fighter jets bombed several LTTE camps around Mavil Aru anicut. LTTE had cut-off the water supply to surrounding paddy fields in the area. The fighting resumed after a four-year ceasefire, nominally still in place, between the Government and the LTE.\n\nContinued fighting lead to several territorial gains for the Sri Lankan Army, including the capture of Sampur, Vakarai and other parts of the east. The war took on an added dimension when the LTTE Air Tigers bombed Katunayake airbase on March 26, 2007, the first rebel air attack without external assistance in history.\n\nEastern Theater\n\nThe war between LTTE and Sri Lankan government started after the failure of Norway brokered cease fire on July 21, 2006, when LTTE cut off the water supply to the rice growing fields in the Mavil Aru area in eastern Trincomalee district. The government military claimed the total control of the eastern province after capturing the Thoppigala (Baron's cap) on July 11, 2007 nearly a year of fighting.\n\nThe major battles took place at Sampoor, Vakarai, Kangikadaichchi Aru, Kokkadichloai and Thoppigala (Baron's cap).\n\nThe LTTE has vowed to attack Sri Lanka's military and economic targets across the country in retaliation for the capture of entire eastern province from them. The political wing leader of the group S.P. Thamilchelvan made the statement to Associated Press on July 12, 2007 at Killinochchi in northern Sri Lanka.\n\nNorthern Theater\n\nMeanwhile, in the north of the country, some of the bloodiest fighting since 2001 took place after the LTTE launched massive attacks on Sri Lanka Army defense lines in the Jaffna peninsula on August 11. The LTTE used a force of 400 to 500 fighters in the attacks which consisted of land and amphibious assaults, and also fired a barrage of artillery at government positions, including the key military airbase at Palaly. Initially, the Tigers broke through army defense lines around Muhamalai, and advanced further north, but they were halted after 10 hours of fierce fighting. Isolated battles continued over the next few days, but the LTTE was forced to give up its offensive due to heavy casualties. Up to 150 rebels and 700 soldiers were killed. Two months later, in October, an army offensive was launched from the city against rebel territory but it was crushed and resulted in the biggest loss of life for the military in four years with 129 soldiers killed and 519 wounded, while only 22 rebels were killed. The SLA accused the Tigers of killing 74 soldiers from a unit they said was surrounded and captured.\n\nAir War\n\nThe battle in air is significant for both sides in this phase of war. The Sri Lankan air-force using their attack planes to carry out bombing campaign in identified LTTE targets. The LTTE Air Tigers also using their light air crafts to carry out bombing on Sri Lankan military.\n\nJul â€“ Tamil Tigers close sluice gates of an eastern reservoir, cutting water to over 60,000 people (July 20), causing government to launch first major offensive on Tiger territory since the 2002 ceasefire. Rebels say war is back on.\n\nMajor battles took place at Sampoor, Vakarai, Kangikadaichchi Aru, Kokkadichloai and Thoppigala (Baron's cap).\n\nSampoor:\n\nBattle Details: Lt.-Gen. Sarath Fonseka was determined to wrest Sampoor from the grip of the Tamil Tigers. The Tamil Tiger local leader, S. Eilalan , Head of LTTEâ€™s Political Division, Trincomalee was also making promises not to let it fall. The battle for Sampoor raged for nearly three weeks with Army advancing slowly but steadily. The advance was slowed by heavy minefields, booby traps and other explosive devices laid by the retreating Tamil Tigers.\n\nTracing the events leading to fall of Sampoor the Army website said: \"It all began back in July 2006 when terrorists shut down the Mavil Aru sluice gates depriving water to over 15,000 families and 30,000 acres of paddy cultivation. The Army troops backed by air support got the sluice gates reopened on 08th August 2006 driving away terrorists further into the south of Verugal area.\n\n\"While ground troops were marching forward terrorists tried their best to stop their advance simultaneously attacking Muttur, Kattaparichchan, Selvanagar and Mahindapura Army installations but troops thwarted those hostilities with repulse attacks.\n\n\"In the meantime, terrorists on 01st August launched mortar attacks towards Trincomalee harbor area while simultaneously directing artillery fire from Sampoor areas but miserably failed to inflict damages on the passenger vessel that was bringing 854 unarmed soldiers from Kankasanthurai to Trincomalee.\n\n\"Columns of Army Special Forces and Infantry columns with the active support of artillery and armour fire power, clearing heavy minefields, booby traps and other explosive devices of their way that had been laid by terrorists, marched forward amidst LTTE's stiff resistance in the past few days. The Air Force and the Navy supported the ground tactical maneuver, effectively in the accomplishment of the mission.\n\n\"At least over 175 Tamil Tiger terrorists perished during the hostilities and over 350 received injuries, as per reports received by the ground troops.\n\n\"The fall of Sampoor comes in the wake of a string of defeats suffered by the terrorists in the north and east in the most recent past in Muhamalai, Nagarkovil, Kilaly, Vavunathivu, Muttur, Mavil Aru, Kallar areas, etc after terrorists unsuccessfully tried either to infiltrate the areas or overrun the camps of the Security Forces,\" said the website.\n\nThe LTTE has vowed to attack Sri Lanka's military and economic targets across the country in retaliation for the capture of entire eastern province from them. The political wing leader of the group S.P. Thamilchelvan made the statement to Associated Press on July 12, 2007 at Killinochchi in northern Sri Lanka.\n\nAug - Seventeen aid workers from Action Against Hunger are massacred in the eastern town of Muttur amid heavy fighting between government troops and rebels.

Vakarai (Vaakare) is a coastal city in the Batticaloa(Madakalapuva) district where the LTTE had clamped their own civil administration and police for some time.\n\nAs per Sri Lankan military sources, the military operation launched to gain the area of Vakarai from LTTE was conducted in two phases. The first phase was to facilitate the movement of civilians into the area under the Sri Lankan army (SLA). The Deep Penetration Unit (DPU) of the SLA infiltrated the area under the LTTE, and launched surprise attacks on them. This tactic caused the LTTE to engage with the SLA instead of holding the civilians (hostages) from fleeing into the SLA control zone.\n\nThe phase-II started on December 4th, 2006 where the SLA troops advanced in three fronts from Trikonamadu(Thrikonamaduva), Kirimichchiya(Kirimaetiyaava), Kadjuwatte and cleared off 15km into the Trikonamadu jungle. During this action, the LTTE targets at Kaddamuravikulam (Gaeta-burutha-vaeva), Karuvappanchenai (Kurunduvana-hena) and Madurankernikulam (Meeran-kenna-vaeva) were destroyed. The second advance of SLA started on December 9th, 2006 from Mahindapura Southwards and captured LTTE camps around Echchalanpaththuwa (Aekiriyan-pattuva) area. The 3rd and 4th advances of SLA started on December 10th, 2006 from Trikonamadu and Kadjuwatta onwards.\n\n2007\n\nJan - Military captures strategic Tiger-held eastern town of Vakarai. UNHCR estimates 213,000 people displaced since April 2006.\n\nMilitary begins Operation Definite Victory to drive the LTTE from Ampara district.\n\nAmpara-Kangikadaichchi Aru\n\nBattle Details: The military operation to consolidate the GOSL's control of Ampara code named as \"Operation Definite Victory\" took place in the Ampara district, in the Lahugala jungles. The Special Task Force also known as the STF was involved in the operation that captured the Kangikadaichchi Aru LTTE military complex during the first week of January 2007.\n\nSTF troops captured around 20 LTTE camps including major bases such as Janak, Stanley and the Jeevan base.
