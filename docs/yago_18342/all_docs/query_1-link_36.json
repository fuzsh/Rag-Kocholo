        "text": "Natural cycle in vitro fertilisation (IVF) for subfertile couples.\n\nPubMed\n\nAllersma, Thomas; Farquhar, Cindy; Cantineau, Astrid E P\n\n2013-08-30\n\nSubfertility affects 15% to 20% of couples trying to conceive. In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is one of the assisted reproduction techniques developed to improve chances of achieving pregnancy. In the standard IVF method with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH), growth and development of multiple follicles are stimulated by using gonadotrophins, often combined with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist. Although it is an established method of conception for subfertile couples, the treatment is expensive and has a high risk of adverse effects. Studies have shown that IVF in a natural cycle (NC) or a modified natural cycle (MNC) might be a promising low risk and low cost alternative to the standard stimulated IVF treatment since the available dominant follicle of each cycle is used. In this review, we included available randomised controlled studies comparing natural cycle IVF (NC and MNC) with standard IVF. To compare the efficacy and safety of natural cycle IVF (including both NC-IVF and MNC-IVF) with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation IVF (COH-IVF) in subfertile couples. An extended search including of the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group (MDSG) Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, conference abstracts in the Web of Knowledge, the World Health Organization International Trials Registry Platform search portal, LILACS database, PubMed and the OpenSIGLE database was conducted according to Cochrane guidelines. The last search was on 31st July 2013. All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing either natural cycle IVF or modified natural cycle IVF versus standard IVF in subfertile couples were included. Data selection and extraction and risk of bias assessment were carried out independently by two authors (TA and AC). The primary outcome measures were live birth rate and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) rate per randomised woman. We\n\nEthical opinions and personal attitudes of young adults conceived by in vitro fertilisation.\n\nPubMed\n\nSiegel, S; Dittrich, R; Vollmann, J\n\n2008-04-01\n\nToday in vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a widespread and important technique of reproductive medicine. When the technique was first used, it was considered ethically controversial. This is the first study conducted of adult IVF-offspring in order to learn about their ethical opinions and personal attitudes towards this medical technology. We recruited the participants from the first cases of in vitro fertilisation in Germany at the Gynaecological Clinic of the University Hospital Erlangen. Our qualitative interview study consisted of in-depth, face-to-face interviews with 16 adults who had been conceived by IVF. Our data was analysed with methods of Grounded Theory. For these adults, the most important factor influencing their personal attitudes towards IVF was the knowledge that they were deeply wanted children. The artificiality of their conception seemed irrelevant for their ethical opinion. All participants mentioned that it was important for them to be informed about the circumstances of their conception by their parents. IVF seems to be a medical technique which, although it affects intimate aspects of human existence, can be integrated into the lives of the affected persons without any great difficulties. The findings suggest that parents should inform their children about their fertilisation at an early age and as part of a process over time, not only on a single occasion. Physicians should advise IVF-parents accordingly.\n\nCytokine expression in the seminal plasma and its effects on fertilisation rates in an IVF cycle.\n\nPubMed\n\nSeshadri, S; Bates, M; Vince, G; Jones, D I Lewis\n\n2011-12-01\n\nCytokines are released by various immunocompetent cell subsets in the male urogenital tract and are thought to affect sperm cell function and reproductive process. The aim of the study was to evaluate the levels and a possible role of seven seminal plasma cytokines with fertilisation rates in men attending an in vitro fertilisation (IVF) programme. A total of 36 men of couples who were undergoing traditional IVF in a regional reproductive medicine unit were recruited into this prospective study. Cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-11, IL-12, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Î±) and interferon gamma (IFN-Î³) in the seminal plasma were determined using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-11 and IFN-Î³ were detected in all samples. IL-12, and TNF-Î± were detected in most samples. Levels of IL-11 were significantly higher in the good fertiliser group (P â¤ 0.05). Positive correlation between cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8 (P < 0.03), IL-10 and IL-11 (P < 0.001) and IFN-Î³ and IL-10 and IL-11 (P < 0.04 and P < 0.0001 respectively) were found. Our study confirms that the six cytokines other than IL-11 do not affect spermatozoon-oocyte interaction and fertilisation rates in IVF. IL-11 could have a role in the fertilising capacity of the spermatozoa. Significant correlation exists among these cytokines which shows that cytokines rarely act in isolation but rather in a network.

The data were divided into three groups based on the fertilisation rate: group 1 (0%), group 2 (<25%) and group 3 (>25%). The impact of rescue ICSI on each group was then analysed in terms of ovum fertilisation, embryo development, embryo utilisation and selection of embryos for transfer. Rescue ICSI was performed on 1831 unfertilised oocytes from 313 cycles. The fertilisation rates for group 1, group 2 and group 3 were 74.66, 68.35 and 65.46%, and the rate of polyploidy in the three groups was 8.55, 11.33, and 14.47%. The percentage of embryos that can be transferred from rescue ICSI for group 2 was 38.33%, and this value was higher than those of the other two groups. It is concluded that rescue ICSI is not recommended for patients with an IVF rate of >25% as the procedure is associated with a greater risk and low returns. However, it is feasible to perform rescue ICSI for patients with IVF rates of <25%.

The present study mainly focussed on the extracellular calcium effector called the calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) and examined its expression in porcine gametes and embryos and its function during fertilisation and early embryo development. By using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, CASR was found to be expressed in porcine oocytes, spermatozoa and embryos at different developmental stages. Functionally, medium supplementation with a CASR agonist or an antagonist during in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and in vitro culture (IVC) was tested. During fertilisation, the presence of a CASR agonist increased sperm penetration rate and decreased polyspermy rate leading to an increased normal fertilisation rate. During embryo development, for the IVF embryos, agonist treatment during IVC significantly increased cleavage rate and blastocyst formation rate compared with the control group. Furthermore, parthenogenetically activated embryos showed similar results with lower cleavage and blastocyst formation rates in the antagonist group than in the other groups. It was concluded that CASR, as the effector of extracellular calcium, modulates porcine fertilisation and early embryo development.\n\nInfluence of mitochondrial membrane potential of spermatozoa on in vitro fertilisation outcome.\n\nPubMed\n\nMarchetti, P; Ballot, C; Jouy, N; Thomas, P; Marchetti, C\n\n2012-04-01\n\nTo determine whether the outcome of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) is influenced by the percentage of spermatozoa with functional mitochondria, a total of 91 random couples undergoing IVF were included. Mitochondrial function was determined by flow cytometry and expressed as percentage of spermatozoa. Conventional sperm parameters were studied by light microscopy. Reproductive outcome parameters were fertilisation rate, embryo quality and clinical pregnancy. It was found that the fertilisation rate was correlated with the percentage of spermatozoa (r = 0.24, P = 0.01) as well as with the percentage of highly motile spermatozoa. However, we did not find any relationship between the percentage of spermatozoa and embryo quality. Nevertheless, no patient who exhibited less than 64% of spermatozoa achieved pregnancy. It is concluded that determination of ÎÏ(m) provides accurate information to guide physicians to identify male patients for whom IVF will be unlikely to result in pregnancy. Therefore, we suggest that the percentage of spermatozoa may contribute to identify the most appropriate treatment for an individual patient.

Decisions for couples with moderate oligoasthenozoospermia (OA) are often empirical because uniform treatment criteria are lacking. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of patients with moderate OA treated with conventional IVF and ICSI. A total of 199 couples with moderate OA undergoing their first IVF/ICSI cycle were included in the study. The patients were divided into two groups according to the type of insemination: conventional IVF group (nÂ =Â 97) and ICSI group (nÂ =Â 102). All patients were randomised to be inseminated either by conventional IVF or ICSI. The fertilisation rate, embryo quality, implantation rate and clinical pregnancy rate were examined. No differences in the fertilisation, implantation and pregnancy rates were observed between conventional IVF and ICSI groups (PÂ >Â 0.05). However, the number of good-quality embryos was significantly higher in the ICSI group than in the IVF group (PÂ <Â 0.05). Couples with moderate OA did not influence on the overall clinical outcomes between IVF and ICSI treatments, and a negative influence by ICSI on blastocyst development was not confirmed.

Twenty-six couples with unexplained infertility and undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment were involved. On the oocytes retrieval day after routine IVF, residual sperm samples were collected to receive progesterone induction (progesterone group) or not (control group). AR rate was calculated and fertilisation rate was recorded. The correlation between progesterone-induced AR and fertilisation rate and between sperm normal morphology and 3PN (tripronuclear) were analysed using the Spearman correlation analysis. The AR rate of progesterone group was statistically higher than that of the control group (15.6Â Â±Â 5.88% versus 9.66Â Â±Â 5.771%, PÂ <Â 0.05), but not significantly correlated with fertilisation rate (rÂ =Â -0.053, PÂ >Â 0.01) or rate of high-quality embryo development (rÂ =Â -0.055, PÂ >Â 0.01). Normal sperm morphology also showed no significant correlation with the amount of 3PN zygotes (rÂ =Â 0.029, PÂ >Â 0.01), rate of 3PN zygotes production (rÂ =Â 0.20, PÂ >Â 0.01), rate of 3PN embryo development (rÂ =Â -0.406, PÂ >Â 0.01), fertilisation rate (rÂ =Â -0.148, PÂ >Â 0.01) or progesterone-induced AR rate (rÂ =Â 0.214, PÂ >Â 0.01). Progesterone can induce AR in vitro significantly; however, the progesterone-induced AR may not be used to indicate fertilisation rate.

They were classified as classic-TMÂ (CTM) or limited-TM (LTM) comparing with patients without TM (Non-TM). Semen parameters, rates of fertilisation, normal fertilisation, good embryos and clinical pregnancy were analysed. The Non-TM group showed higher percentage of morphologically normal spermatozoa than the CTM or LTM group (4.08Â Â±Â 2.07 versus 3.40Â Â±Â 2.00 versus 3.04Â Â±Â 1.66, pÂ =Â .003) while the other general semen parameters were comparable. The LTM group showed higher rate of fertilisation than the CTM group (85.10% versus 81.12%, pÂ =Â .044). Moreover, the rates of normal fertilisation of Non-TM (62.47%) and LTM (66.32%) group were significantly higher than the CTM (58.02%) group (pÂ =Â .027 and pÂ =Â .001 respectively). There were 333 embryo transfer cycles in total (including 222 fresh and 111 frozen). The overall clinical pregnancy rate was 54.95%, 58.33% and 64.12% in the group of CTM, LTM and Non-TM respectively. However, no statistically significant difference was obtained (pÂ =Â .326). Our results suggest that TM may have influence on the IVF outcomes. The extent of microlithiasis correlates inversely with the rates of fertilisation and normal fertilisation.

It is known that endometriosis is associated with infertility, but there is uncertainty whether women with endometriosis have adverse pregnancy outcomes in in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment. To explore the association between endometriosis and IVF outcome. Searches were conducted on MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science (inception, December 2012) in all languages, together with reference lists of retrieved papers. Studies comparing IVF outcome in women with endometriosis with women without endometriosis. Patients were classified by stage of endometriosis. The outcomes were fertilisation, implantation, clinical pregnancy and live birth rates. Study selection was conducted independently by two reviewers. The Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale was used for quality assessment. Data extraction was conducted independently by two reviewers. Relative risks from individual studies were meta-analysed. Twenty-seven observational studies were included, comprising 8984 women. Meta-analysis of these studies showed that fertilisation rates were reduced in stage I/II of endometriosis (relative risk [RR] = 0.93, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.87-0.99, P = 0.03). There was a decrease in the implantation rate (RR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.67-0.93, P = 0.006) and clinical pregnancy rate (RR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.69-0.91, P = 0.0008) in women with stage III/IV endometriosis undergoing IVF treatment. The presence of severe endometriosis (stage III/IV) is associated with poor implantation and clinical pregnancy rates in women undergoing IVF treatment.

The focus is on the social context of infertility and on women's perceptions of and experiences with IVF. Twenty-two childless women/couples who sought IVF. The sample was drawn from consenting clients of clinics in two major Indian cities, viz. New Delhi and Mumbai. In-depth interviews revealed that infertility is deeply feared, women's status and security are affected, and they experience stigmatisation and isolation. IVF was pursued after less intrusive avenues had been exhausted. Inadequate information/counselling is provided, success rates are low, IVF is commercialised and the process is physiologically, emotionally and financially stressful. In Indian society fertility defines womanhood and motherhood, and infertility is stigmatised. Women faced a lot of pressures to produce a biological child, and go through all kinds of treatments, including the expensive ARTs, to have a child.

Treatments used during assisted reproductive techniques may consequently influence the short term evolution of MS by modifying the hormonal status of the patient. The objective of this study was to determine if there was an increased risk of developing exacerbations in women with MS after in vitro fertilisation (IVF). MS and IVF data were either automatically extracted from 13 French university hospital databases or obtained from referring neurologists. After matching databases, patient clinical files were systematically reviewed to collect information about MS and the treatments used for IVF. The association between IVF and the occurrence of MS relapses was analysed in detail using univariate and multivariate statistical tests. During the 11 year study period, 32 women with MS had undergone 70 IVF treatments, 48 using gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists and 19 using GnRH antagonists. A significant increase in the annualised relapse rate (ARR) was observed during the 3 month period following IVF (mean ARR 1.60, median ARR 0) compared with the same period just before IVF (mean ARR 0.80, median ARR 0) and to a control period 1 year before IVF (mean ARR 0.68, median ARR 0). The significant increase in relapses was associated with the use of GnRH agonists (Wilcoxon paired test, p=0.025) as well as IVF failure (Wilcoxon paired test, p=0.019). An increased relapse rate was observed in this study after IVF in patients with MS and may be partly related both to IVF failure and the use of GnRH agonists.\n\nIn Vitro Fertilization (IVF)\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n... or eggs are implanted in your uterus.

With advancing reproductive medicine, assisted reproductive techniques (ARTs) are becoming common. While dermatological manifestations in normal pregnancies have been well documented, there is a paucity of data regarding cutaneous manifestations in patients undergoing ART. The objectives of our study were to estimate the incidence and types of dermatological manifestations in patients undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and to study their associations with age, type of infertility, and outcome of the procedure. A prospective cohort of 200 patients undergoing IVF in a tertiary care centre was observed for occurrence of any dermatological manifestations from initiation of the IVF protocol to the outcome of the procedure at 3 weeks after embryo transfer. Dermatological manifestations were seen in 27% of the study group, with urticaria being the most common cutaneous finding seen in 13.5%, followed by acneform eruptions (3%). Twenty-six (96.3%) of patients who manifested with urticaria were on progesterone. No statistically significant association was found between the occurrence of dermatological manifestations and the outcome of IVF, type of infertility, history of ART, and ovum donation in our study. Association between the age of the patient and the outcome of IVF cycle was statistically significant. Dermatological manifestations are seen in almost one-quarter of patients undergoing IVF, with progesterone-induced urticaria being the most common. Occurrence of cutaneous manifestations has no significant association with the outcome of IVF.\n\nComparison of different fertilisation media for an in vitro maturation?fertilisation?culture system using flow-cytometrically sorted X chromosome-bearing spermatozoa for bovine embryo production.\n\nPubMed\n\nFerrÃ©, Luis B; Bogliotti, Yanina; Chitwood, James L; Fresno, CristÃ³bal; Ortega, Hugo H; Kjelland, Michael E; Ross, Pablo J\n\n2015-05-13\n\nHigh demand exists among commercial cattle producers for in vitro-derived bovine embryos fertilised with female sex-sorted spermatozoa from high-value breeding stock. The aim of this study was to evaluate three fertilisation media, namely M199, synthetic oviductal fluid (SOF) and Tyrode's albumin-lactate-pyruvate (TALP), on IVF performance using female sex-sorted spermatozoa. In all, 1143, 1220 and 1041 cumulus-oocyte complexes were fertilised in M199, SOF and TALP, respectively. There were significant differences among fertilisation media (P < 0.05) in cleavage rate (M199 = 57%, SOF = 71% and TALP = 72%), blastocyst formation (M199 = 9%, SOF = 20% and TALP = 19%), proportion of Grade 1 blastocysts (M199 = 15%, SOF = 52% and TALP = 51%), proportion of Grade 3 blastocysts (M199 = 58%, SOF = 21% and TALP = 20%) and hatching rates (M199 = 29%, SOF = 60% and TALP = 65%). The inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE) cells of Day 7 blastocysts were also affected by the fertilisation medium. Embryos derived from SOF and TALP fertilisation media had higher numbers of ICM, TE and total cells than those fertilised in M199. In conclusion, fertilisation media affected cleavage rate, as well as subsequent embryo development, quality and hatching ability. SOF and TALP fertilisation media produced significantly more embryos of higher quality than M199.\n\nLeptin and leptin receptor are detectable in equine spermatozoa but are not involved in in vitro fertilisation.\n\nPubMed\n\nLange-Consiglio, Anna; Corradetti, Bruna; Perrini, Claudia; Bizzaro, Davide; Cremonesi, Fausto\n\n2016-04-01\n\nIn human and swine, leptin (OB) has been identified in seminal plasma and leptin receptors (OB-R) on the cell surface of spermatozoa, indicating that spermatozoa are a target for OB. This hormone has also been detected in follicular fluid (FF) in women and mares, although its role requires further study. The aims of this study were to investigate the immunolocalisation and the expression of OB and OB-R in equine spermatozoa and to evaluate the involvement of OB in equine in vitro fertilisation (IVF). Since progesterone (P) and OB are both found in FF, the individual and combined effects of these two hormones were studied in equine IVF and compared with the results obtained from the use of FF for in vitro sperm preparation. For the first time, we were able to identify OB and OB-R mRNA and their corresponding proteins in equine spermatozoa. When spermatozoa were treated with OB, there was a decrease in the three motility parameters VSL, STR and LIN, commonly associated with hyperactivation, whilst the acrosome reaction rate increased (P<0.05). The fertilisation rate was 51% with FF, 46.15% with P, 43.64% with P+OB and 0% with OB alone. The percentage of eight-cell stage embryos was 18.7% with FF, 17.1% with P and 16.7% with OB+P. OB alone did not permit oocyte fertilisation, indicating that, in the horse, OB is involved in capacitation and hyperactivation but not in sperm penetration.\n\nIn vitro fertilization (IVF)\n\nMedlinePlus\n\nIVF; Assisted reproductive technology; ART; Test-tube baby procedure; Infertility - in vitro ... conception.

The objective of this study was to document the views of key stakeholders regarding salient ethical issues relating to the practice of in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) in Nigeria. A think-tank session was convened with participants drawn from different backgrounds and disciplines to deliberate on ethical issues in IVF. Ten key issues were discussed at this inaugural session. It was unanimously agreed that there are no right or wrong answers when considering the ethics and morality of IVF as these are principally dependent on choice and circumstances. However within the legal and socio-cultural dictates of the Nigerian society, right and wrong may be clearly determined on some issues. With the expansion of the IVF industry and technology in Nigeria, the need to address related ethical issues have become paramount. The forum recommended that it is important that regulatory guidelines are put in place to regulate the practice of IVF in Nigeria and to protect patients' rights and safety.\n\nThe effects of anxiety and depression on in vitro fertilisation outcomes of infertile Chinese women.\n\nPubMed\n\nXu, Hongmei; Ouyang, Nengyong; Li, Ruiqi; Tuo, Ping; Mai, Meiqi; Wang, Wenjun\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe object was to assess anxiety and depression during in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment and determine IVF-related psychological factors in infertile Chinese women. The self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and self-rating depression scale (SDS) were used to evaluate anxiety and depression among 842 patients, respectively. A univariate analysis was used to compare variables among three SAS groups and three SDS groups. Anxiety and depression were both represented in 21.3% of the cases. PatientsÂ <35Â years tended to be more anxious. In womenÂ <35Â years, the SDS scores were higher with lower educational backgrounds and female or couple's infertility, while the SAS scores were higher in female or couple's infertility. In older ones, the SDS scores were higher in those with lower educational backgrounds and longer time for infertility, while the SAS scores were higher in those with lower educational backgrounds. In SAS groups 1-3, the embryo availability was 5.0 (3.0-8.0), 5.0 (3.0-8.0), and 3.0 (2.0-4.5) (pÂ =Â .013); and the fertilisation rate was 91.9, 90.4, and 81.8% (pÂ <Â .001), respectively. We concluded that infertile women experience anxiety and depression during IVF treatment, especially in womenÂ <35Â years. Younger women with female infertility would be more anxious and depressive while higher education can protect them from depression. In older ones, they would experience more depressive with longer time for infertility and be less anxious and depressive with higher education. Anxiety affects the fertilisation rate and embryo availability.\n\nEffect of a high fat diet on ovary morphology, in vitro development, in vitro fertilisation rate and oocyte quality in mice.\n\nPubMed\n\nSohrabi, Maryam; Roushandeh, Amaneh Mohammadi; Alizadeh, Zohreh; Vahidinia, Aliasghar; Vahabian, Mehrangiz; Hosseini, Mahnaz\n\n2015-10-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to determine the effect of a high-fat diet (HFD) on oocyte maturation and quality in a mouse model. Female BALB/c mice were allocated to one of the following groups: (a) control group (n = 40), which received a controlled diet; or (b) HFD group (n = 40), which received an HFD for 12 weeks. Sections of the ovary were examined histologically. The number of follicles and corpora lutea were counted. In vitro maturation and in vitro fertilisation (IVF) were assessed in germinal vesicle (GV) and metaphase II (MII) oocytes, respectively. The expression of bone morphogenetic protein 15 (BMP15) and leptin receptor genes in GV and MII oocytes was evaluated using reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reactions. In the HFD group, there was a decreased number of primordial and Graafian follicles, as well as corpora lutea (p < 0.05). The rate of oocyte development to the MII stage was also reduced (p < 0.001). Cumulus expansion was observed more frequently in the control group than the HFD group (p < 0.05). The IVF rate in the HFD group was lower than that in the control group (p < 0.05). In the HFD group, BMP15 and leptin receptor genes were upregulated in the GV stage (p > 0.05) and MII stage (p < 0.05), compared to the control group. An HFD reduces folliculogenesis in the primordial and Graafian stages, in vitro maturation and in vitro fertilisation rates, as well as oocyte quality in mice.\n\nRe-evaluation of post-wash sperm is a helpful tool in the decision to perform in vitro fertilisation or intracytoplasmic sperm injection.\n\nPubMed\n\nWiser, A; Ghetler, Y; Gonen, O; Piura, E; Berkovits, A; Itskovich, A; Rom, T; Shulman, A\n\n2012-04-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to find discriminatory parameters, based on sperm characteristics on the day of ovum pickup, that can help guide the decision to perform either intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) or in vitro fertilisation (IVF). We evaluated 112 cycles fertilised with both regular and ICSI insemination during the same cycle. A total of 112 cycles were analysed. In 62 cycles, fertilisation was obtained with both ICSI and IVF, and in 50 cycles, fertilisation was obtained by ICSI alone. The sperm samples were re-evaluated after the preparation process. The mean initial total motile sperm count (TMSC) was 66.3 Ã 10(6) Â± 47.5 in the group that underwent both methods and 23.1 Ã 10(6) Â± 20.4 in the ICSI only group (P < 0.05). After sperm preparation, the mean post-wash TMSC was 4.4 Ã 10(6) Â± 3.4 and 1.06 Ã 10(6) Â± 0.9 respectively (P < 0.05). A cutoff of 1.5 Ã 10(6) or fewer sperm after preparation as an indicator for ICSI has a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 77%. Re-evaluation of TMSC can prevent unexpected fertilisation failure. Fewer than 1.5 million TMSC after wash should be considered an indication for ICSI fertilisation.

An everlasting dilemma nowadays; a narrative review.\n\nPubMed\n\nDaniilidis, A; Balaouras, D; Chitzios, D; Theodoridis, T; Assimakopoulos, E\n\n2017-07-01\n\nThe decision on how to treat tubal diseases, specifically hydrosalpinx, is a difficult one. Ît involves surgical, medical, social, emotional and economic factors. This narrative review aims to increase awareness of tubal disease diagnosis and treatment, to compare between tubal surgery and in vitro fertilisation (IVF) for tubal factor infertility, and to investigate the effect of the combination of both. This way, we can be more effective, safe and provide our patients with better treatment results. The review analysed randomised studies, trials and meta-analysis, which give new aspects on the treatment methods for tubal pathology before IVF. Recent papers published in English have been studied, alongside guidelines and committee opinions from previous years. Tubal surgery and IVF aim to exploit a woman's reproductive potential. IVF and endoscopic tubal surgery must be thought of as complementary, rather than competing techniques in tubal disease cases, in order to improve fertility outcome. The first-line treatment for young women less than 35 years old with minor tubal pathology, is tubal surgery. IVF should be offered if there are other factors in a couple's subfertility, if the patient is >38 years old, if moderate to severe tubal disease is present, and if it has been more than 12 months post-surgery.\n\nHormonal induction of gamete release, and in-vitro fertilisation, in the critically endangered Southern Corroboree Frog, Pseudophryne corroboree\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2010-01-01\n\nBackground Conservation Breeding Programs (CBP's) are playing an important role in the protection of critically endangered anuran amphibians, but for many species recruitment is not successful enough to maintain captive populations, or provide individuals for release. In response, there has been an increasing focus on the use of Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART), including the administration of reproductive hormones to induce gamete release followed by in vitro fertilisation. The objective of this study was to test the efficacy of two exogenous hormones to induce gamete release, for the purpose of conducting in vitro fertilisation (IVF), in one of Australia's most critically endangered frog species, Pseudophryne corroboree. Methods Male frogs were administered a single dose of either human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRHa), while female frogs received both a priming and ovulatory dose of LHRHa. Spermiation responses were evaluated at 3, 7, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72 h post hormone administration (PA), and sperm number and viability were quantified using fluorescent microscopy. Ovulation responses were evaluated by stripping females every 12 h PA for 5 days. Once gametes were obtained, IVF was attempted by combining spermic urine with oocytes in a dilute solution of simplified amphibian ringer (SAR). Results Administration of both hCG and LHRHa induced approximately 80% of males to release sperm over 72 h. Peak sperm release occurred at 12 h PA for hCG treated males and 36 h PA for LHRHa treated males. On average, LHRHa treated males released a significantly higher total number of live sperm, and a higher concentration of sperm, over a longer period. In female frogs, administration of LHRHa induced approximately 30% of individuals to release eggs. On average, eggs were released between 24 and 48 h PA, with a peak in egg release at 36 h PA. IVF resulted in a moderate percentage (54.72%) of eggs being fertilised\n\nKisspeptin as a promising oocyte maturation trigger for in vitro fertilisation in humans.\n\nPubMed\n\nKasum, Miro; FranuliÄ, Daniela; ÄehiÄ, Ermin; OreÅ¡koviÄ, Slavko; Lila, Albert; EjuboviÄ, Emina\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThe aim of this review is to analyse the effectiveness of exogenous kisspeptin administration as a novel alternative of triggering oocyte maturation, instead of currently used triggers such as human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist, in women undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment. Kisspeptin has been considered a master regulator of two modes of GnRH and hence gonadotropin secretion, pulses and surges. Administration of kisspeptin-10 and kisspeptin-54 induces the luteinising hormone (LH) surge required for egg maturation and ovulation in animal investigations and LH release during the preovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle and hypothalamic amenorrhoea in humans. Exogenous kisspeptin-54 has been successfully administered as a promising method of triggering oocyte maturation, following ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins and GnRH antagonists in women undergoing IVF, due to its efficacy considering achieved pregnancy rates compared to hCG and GnRH agonists. Also, its safety in patients at high risk of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is noteworthy. Nevertheless, further studies would be desirable to establish the optimal trigger of egg maturation and to improve the reproductive outcome for women undergoing IVF treatment.\n\nEndurance with partnership: a preliminary conceptual framework for couples undergoing in vitro fertilisation treatment.\n\nPubMed\n\nYing, Liying; Wu, Lai Har; Wu, Xiangli; Shu, Jing; Loke, Alice Yuen\n\n2018-04-01\n\nInfertility affects both women and men in the physical, emotional, existential, and interpersonal realms. When couples seek in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment, they further suffer from the difficulties of the treatment and the uncertainty of its outcome. The aim of this study was to develop a preliminary conceptual framework for couples undergoing IVF treatment to give health professionals a better understanding of the experiences of such couples, and to guide the development of an intervention. The process of identifying frameworks adopted in intervention studies confirmed that there is no established framework for infertile couples undergoing IVF treatment. A skeletal framework identified from previous studies provides an internal structure for the proposed framework for couples undergoing IVF treatment, filled out with concepts drawn from a concept analysis and a qualitative study, knitting the structure together. This preliminary framework is the Endurance with Partnership Conceptual Framework (P-EPCF). It consists of four domains: the impacts of infertility and stressors, dyadic mediators, dyadic moderators and dyadic outcomes. According to the P-EPCF, the impacts of infertility and IVF treatment can be mediated by the couples' partnership and dyadic coping. Improvements in the psychological well-being and marital functioning of IVF couples can then be expected. The P-EPCF would be potentially valuable in guiding the development of a complex, couple-based intervention, which could focus on enhancing the partnership of couples and their coping strategies.\n\nDynamics of sperm subpopulations based on motility and plasma membrane status in thawed ram spermatozoa incubated under conditions that support in vitro capacitation and fertilisation.\n\nPubMed\n\nGarcÃ­a-Ãlvarez, Olga; Maroto-Morales, Alejandro; RamÃ³n, Manuel; del Olmo, Enrique; JimÃ©nez-RabadÃ¡n, Pilar; FernÃ¡ndez-Santos, M Rocio; Anel-LÃ³pez, Luis; Garde, J JuliÃ¡n; Soler, Ana J\n\n2014-06-01\n\nThe present study evaluated modifications occurring in thawed ram spermatozoa during incubation in different media that supported in vitro capacitation and fertilisation, and examines how these changes relate to IVF. Thawed sperm samples were incubated under capacitating (Cap) and non-capacitating (non-Cap) conditions for 0, 1 and 2h and used in an IVF test. During incubation, changes related to membrane status and the motility pattern of spermatozoa were assessed, the latter being used to characterise sperm subpopulations. A significantly greater increase (Pâ¤0.05) in the percentage of spermatozoa with higher membrane fluidity was observed in samples incubated with Cap medium from the beginning of incubation. In addition, changes over time in the distribution of the motile subpopulation were particularly evident when spermatozoa were incubated with Cap medium, with a noted increase in spermatozoa classified as 'hyperactivated like', with major changes occurring after 1h incubation. Both characteristics (i.e. membrane fluidity and the percentage of the hyperactivated-like subpopulation) were significantly related with in vitro fertility, and only sperm samples incubated with the Cap medium were capable of fertilising oocytes. These results support the idea that changes in sperm membrane fluidity and motility pattern (i.e. an increase in hyperactivated spermatozoa) are needed for fertilisation to take place.\n\nProgesterone improves porcine in vitro fertilisation system.\n\nPubMed\n\nMalo, Clara; Gil, Lydia; Cano, Rafael; Martinez, Felisa; Gonzalez, Noelia\n\n2014-03-01\n\nIn an effort to improve the quality of in vitro produced porcine embryos, the effect of progestagens - progesterone analogues - on the in vitro developmental competence of porcine oocytes was studied. A total of 1421 in vitro matured oocytes, from 4 replicates, were inseminated with frozen-thawed spermatozoa. Progestagens were added to late maturation and embryo cultures (10 IU/ml). Fertilisation success (pre-maturation, penetration, monospermy and efficiency) and nuclear maturation were evaluated. There were no differences among prematuration rates between groups (P = 0.221). Penetration rates were higher (P < 0.001) in the presence of progestagens (75.0%) as compared to the control (51.7%). However, no differences were observed in monospermy percentages (P = 0.246). The results indicated that supplementation with progestagens increased the efficiency of the in vitro fertilisation system (P < 0.001). An additional beneficial effect was observed in nuclear maturation with progestagens (P = 0.035). In summary, progestagen supplementation is an important factor to improve the in vitro fertilisation procedure.\n\nThe influence of body mass index to in-vitro fertilisation treatment outcome, risk of miscarriage and pregnancy outcome.\n\nPubMed\n\nThum, M Y; El-Sheikhah, A; Faris, R; Parikh, J; Wren, M; Ogunyemi, T; Gafar, A; Abdalla, H\n\n2007-10-01\n\nThe aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of extreme body mass index (BMI) on assisted reproductive treatment outcome and pregnancy outcome. This is a descriptive cohort study that evaluated 8,145 consecutive in-vitro fertilisation/intracytoplasmic sperm injection-embryo transfer (IVF/ICSI-ET) cycles in which BMI were known, from July 1997 to June 2005 in an inner London major fertility clinic. The data were collected prospectively and analysed retrospectively on women undergoing IVF/ICSI and ET. Patients' weight and height were established prior to treatment. IVF/ICSI treatment was then started using either a long or an antagonist protocol. Patients were divided into five groups: Group A (BMI < 19); Group B (BMI between 19 and 25.9); Group C (BMI between 26 and 30.9); Group D (BMI between 31 and 35.9); Group E (BMI > 36). The main outcomes measured were number of eggs collected, fertilisation rate, number of embryos available for transfer, pregnancy rate (PR), live-birth rate (LBR) and miscarriage rate (MR). The results showed no significant difference in the average number of days taking follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) for ovarian stimulation, the average amount of gonadotrophin used for stimulation, number of eggs collected and fertilisation rate. The pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate and the live-birth rate were not statistically different between all groups. However, in group E the miscarriage rate was significantly higher and the LBR was statistically lower compared with group B. We concluded that extreme BMI did not affect the super-ovulation outcome fertilisation rate and pregnancy rate. Women with a BMI > 35 had a higher miscarriage rate and hence a lower live-birth rate, but a reasonable pregnancy and live-birth rate can be achieved. For women with a BMI < 20 there was no difference in assisted reproduction treatment (ART) outcome and pregnancy outcome when compared with women with a normal BMI. This information should be used to advise patients\n\nExperiences of physical activity during pregnancy resulting from in vitro fertilisation: an interpretative phenomenological analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nWalker, Chloe; Mills, Hayley; Gilchrist, Angela\n\n2017-09-01\n\nTo explore the qualitative experiences and decision-making processes surrounding physical activity (PA) for women who have undergone IVF treatment. PA during pregnancy is safe for both mother and fetus in the majority of cases, including for women who have undergone in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment; however, there is a paucity of research into decision-making and PA in this population. Eight women, who had undergone successful IVF treatment and were currently pregnant or had given birth within the last two years, participated in semi-structured interviews about their experiences of infertility and PA during pregnancy. Interview transcripts were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Three superordinate themes emerged from the data: 'navigating away from childlessness and towards motherhood', 'negotiating a safe passage' and 'balancing the challenges of pregnancy with the needs of the self'. Ten subthemes indicated the processes adopted to navigate experiences of infertility, the IVF process, and subsequent decision-making about PA during pregnancy. PA during pregnancy was experienced as a way to soothe the self and control the experience of pregnancy; however, this was mediated by concerns about safety and physical limitations on PA. Limitations of the study are considered, as well as implications for clinical practice and directions for future research.\n\nIn vitro fertilisation treatment and factors affecting success.\n\nPubMed\n\nHuang, Jack Yu Jen; Rosenwaks, Zev\n\n2012-12-01\n\nThe efficacy of assisted reproductive technologies has improved significantly over the past decades. The main indications for in vitro fertilisation include tubal obstruction, severe male-factor infertility, severe endometriosis, ovulatory dysfunction, diminished ovarian reserve, and infertility of unexplained cause. In vitro fertilisation has also become an effective treatment option for couples wishing to undergo pre-implantation genetic diagnosis or screening, and for those wishing to cryopreserve their oocytes or embryos for preservation of fertility. The management of women in late reproductive age poses a major challenge; the optimum in vitro fertilisation treatment for poor responders remains elusive. The success of in vitro fertilisation treatment can be optimised by taking an individualised, patient-centered approach to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. Key components involve selection of an appropriate controlled ovarian protocol, close-cycle monitoring, adjustment of gonadotropin dosage to avoid hyper-response, and individualised timing of human chorionic gonadotropin injection. Future directions of assisted reproductive technologies include development of non-invasive embryo selection methods, use of transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and time-lapse imaging technologies.

The most appropriate time to commence aspirin therapy and the length of treatment required are also still to be determined. This is an update of the review first published in 2007. To determine the effectiveness and safety of aspirin for improving the outcome of in vitro fertilisation and intracytoplasmic sperm injection treatment cycles. We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library January 2011), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2011) and EMBASE (1980 to January 2011) databases. We used the research terms: \"(aspirin OR acetylsalicylic acid) AND (in-vitro fertilisation OR intracytoplasmic sperm injection)\", combined with the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group's search strategy, in order to identify randomised controlled trials on aspirin for women undergoing in vitro fertilisation. Randomised controlled trials. Two authors independently selected studies to include in the review, extracted data and assessed trial quality. The searches identified 13 trials which were eligible for inclusion in the review, including a total of 2653 participants. No significant differences were found between the treatment and control groups for any of the outcomes assessed. No significant differences were found in the meta-analysis of studies investigating the effect of aspirin compared with control on live birth rate (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.15; three studies and 1053 participants), clinical pregnancy rate (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.17; 10 studies and 2142 participants), ectopic and miscarriage rates (RR 1.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 4.63; RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.77) respectively (three and five studies involving 1135 and 1497 participants). Use of aspirin for women undergoing in vitro fertilisation cannot be recommended due to lack of\n\nAssociation of common thrombophilias and antiphospholipid antibodies with success rate of in vitro fertilisation.\n\nPubMed\n\nSteinvil, Arie; Raz, Raanan; Berliner, Shlomo; Steinberg, David M; Zeltser, David; Levran, David; Shimron, Orit; Sella, Tal; Chodick, Gabriel; Shalev, Varda; Salomon, Ophira\n\n2012-12-01\n\nAssisted reproductive technology (ART) is extensively used as a tool for pregnancy achievement in subfertile couples. Congenital and acquired thrombophilias have been suggested by some investigators to play a role in abnormal embryo implantation and placentation. The objective of this study was to assess the role of common thrombophilias in women with unexplained infertility undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF). We retrospectively analysed 594 women from a large healthcare maintenance organisation going through IVF and who had a thrombophilia workup, and compared them for prevalence of thrombophilia to two reference groups consisting of 637 fertile women from previous work and 17,337 women members of the same healthcare organisation with no history of venous thromboembolism. The mean age of the women at the first cycle of IVF was 30.9 years (SD: 4.1).The mean number of IVF cycles was 7.3 (SD: 5.0), and the mean fertility success rate per woman was 14.6% (SD: 19.0%). None of the common thrombophilias tested was found to be significantly associated with the number of IVF cycles or with lower fertility success rate. Rather, women who had APCR and /or factor V Leiden and lupus anticoagulant had significantly higher live birth rates (12.3% and 12.6%, respectively) in comparison to women who were tested negative (9.0% and 9.7%, respectively). Thus, hypercoagulability is not associated with failure to achieve pregnancy. These data suggest that neither screening for thrombophilia nor anticoagulant treatment is indicated in cases with unexplained reproductive failure.\n\nDNA methylation changes at infertility genes in newborn twins conceived by in vitro fertilisation.\n\nPubMed\n\nCastillo-Fernandez, Juan E; Loke, Yuk Jing; Bass-Stringer, Sebastian; Gao, Fei; Xia, Yudong; Wu, Honglong; Lu, Hanlin; Liu, Yuan; Wang, Jun; Spector, Tim D; Saffery, Richard; Craig, Jeffrey M; Bell, Jordana T\n\n2017-03-24\n\nThe association of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and DNA methylation has been studied predominantly at regulatory regions of imprinted genes and at just thousands of the ~28 million CpG sites in the human genome. We investigated the links between IVF and DNA methylation patterns in whole cord blood cells (nâ=â98) and cord blood mononuclear cells (nâ=â82) from newborn twins using genome-wide methylated DNA immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing. At a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5%, we identified one significant whole blood DNA methylation change linked to conception via IVF, which was located ~3Â kb upstream of TNP1, a gene previously linked to male infertility. The 46 most strongly associated signals (FDR of 25%) included a second region in a gene also previously linked to infertility, C9orf3, suggesting that our findings may in part capture the effect of parental subfertility. Using twin modelling, we observed that individual-specific environmental factors appear to be the main overall contributors of methylation variability at the FDR 25% IVF-associated differentially methylated regions, although evidence for methylation heritability was also obtained at several of these regions. We replicated previous findings of differential methylation associated with IVF at the H19/IGF2 region in cord blood mononuclear cells, and we validated the signal at C9orf3 in monozygotic twins. We also explored the impact of intracytoplasmic sperm injection on the FDR 25% signals for potential effects specific to male or female infertility factors. To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive study of DNA methylation profiles at birth and IVF conception to date, and our results show evidence for epigenetic modifications that may in part reflect parental subfertility.\n\nPrediction of individual probabilities of livebirth and multiple birth events following in vitro fertilization (IVF): a new outcomes counselling tool for IVF providers and patients using HFEA metrics\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJones, Christopher A.; Christensen, Anna L.; Salihu, Hamisu; Carpenter, William; Petrozzino, Jeffrey; Abrams, Elizabeth; Sills, Eric Scott; Keith, Louis G.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nIn vitro fertilization (IVF) has become a standard treatment for subfertility after it was demonstrated to be of value to humans in 1978. However, the introduction of IVF into mainstream clinical practice has been accompanied by concerns regarding the number of multiple gestations that it can produce, as multiple births present significant medical consequences to mothers and offspring. When considering IVF as a treatment modality, a balance must be set between the chance of having a live birth and the risk of having a multiple birth. As IVF is often a costly decision for patientsâfinancially, medically, and emotionallyâthere is benefit from estimating a patientâs specific chance that IVF could result in a birth as fertility treatment options are contemplated. Historically, a patientâs âchance of successâ with IVF has been approximated from institution-based statistics, rather than on the basis of any particular clinical parameter (except age). Furthermore, the likelihood of IVF resulting in a twin or triplet outcome must be acknowledged for each patient, given the known increased complications of multiple gestation and consequent increased risk of poor birth outcomes. In this research, we describe a multivariate risk assessment model that incorporates metrics adapted from a national 7.5-year sampling of the Human Fertilisation & Embryology Authority (HFEA) dataset (1991â1998) to predict reproductive outcome (including estimation of multiple birth) after IVF.

In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a widely accepted treatment for this condition; however, this treatment is invasive and expensive and is associated with risks. To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of IVF compared with expectant management, unstimulated intrauterine insemination (IUI) or intrauterine insemination along with ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins (IUI + gonadotropins) or clomiphene (IUI + CC) or letrozole (IUI + letrozole) in improving pregnancy outcomes. This review has drawn on the search strategy developed by the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group. We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (searched May 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, first quarter), MEDLINE (1946 to May 2015), EMBASE (1985 to May 2015), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (May 2015) and reference lists of articles. We searched the following trial registries: clinicaltrials.gov (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Trials Registry Platform search portal (http://www.who.int/trialsearch/Default.aspx). We searched the Web of Science (http://wokinfo.com/) as another source of trials and conference abstracts, OpenGrey (http://www.opengrey.eu/) for unpublished literature from Europe and the Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) database (http://regional.bvsalud.org/php/index.php?lang=en). Moreover, we handsearched relevant conference proceedings and contacted study authors to ask about additional publications.Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. The primary review outcome was cumulative live birth rate. Multiple pregnancy and other adverse effects were secondary outcomes.

Our aim was to assess the role of B vitamins and genetics. We did a prospective cohort study of 602 women undergoing fertility treatment. We assessed intake of folate and vitamin B12 with a questionnaire and measured their plasma and red-blood-cell concentrations by radioimmunoassay. We measured five B-vitamin-related gene variants in women who received treatment and in 932 women who conceived naturally. The likelihood of a twin birth after IVF rose with increased concentrations of plasma folate (1.52, 1.01-2.28; p=0.032) and red-cell folate (1.28, 1.00-1.65; p=0.039). There was no association between folate and vitamin B12 levels and likelihood of a successful pregnancy. Women homozygous for the 1298 CC variant of methylenetetrahydro-folate reductase (MTHFR), rather than the AA variant, were less likely to produce a livebirth after IVF (0.24, 0.08-0.71; p=0.003) or to have had a previous pregnancy (0.42, 0.21-0.81; p=0.008). Our findings suggest that MTHFR genotype is linked to a woman's potential to produce healthy embryos (possibly through interaction with genes related to DNA methylation). In women likely to have a successful IVF pregnancy, high folate status increases the likelihood of twin birth after multiple embryo transfer. Proposals to fortify the UK diet with folic acid could lead to an increase in the number of twins born after IVF.\n\nCan we identify subfertile couples that benefit from immediate in vitro fertilisation over intrauterine insemination?\n\nPubMed\n\nTjon-Kon-Fat, RaÃ¯ssa I; Tajik, Parvin; Custers, Inge M; Bossuyt, Patrick M M; van der Veen, Fulco; van Wely, Madelon; Mol, Ben W; Zafarmand, Mohammad H\n\n2016-07-01\n\nAvailable treatment options in couples with unexplained or mild male subfertility are intrauterine insemination with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (IUI-COH) and in vitro fertilisation (IVF). IUI-COH is a less invasive treatment that is often used before proceeding with IVF. Yet as the IVF success rates might be higher and time to pregnancy shorter, expedited access to IVF might be the preferred option. To identify couples that could benefit from immediate IVF over IUI-COH, we assessed whether female age, duration of subfertility or prewash total motile count (TMC) can help to identify couples that would benefit from IVF over IUI-COH. We performed a secondary data-analysis of a multicentre open-label randomised controlled trial in three university and six teaching hospitals in the Netherlands. 116 couples with unexplained or mild male subfertility were randomised to one cycle of IVF with elective single embryo transfer with subsequent frozen-thawed embryo transfers or 3 cycles of IUI-COH. The primary outcome was an ongoing pregnancy within 4 months after randomisation. Our aim was to explore a possible differential effect of specific markers on the effectiveness of treatment. We chose to therefore assess female age, duration of subfertility and TMC as these have previously been identified as predictors. For each prognostic factor we developed a logistic regression model to predict ongoing pregnancy with that prognostic factor, treatment and a factor-by-treatment interaction term. Female age and duration of subfertility were not associated with better ongoing pregnancy chances after IVF compared to IUI-COH (p-value for interaction=0.65 and 0.26, respectively). Only when TMC was lower than 110 (Ã10(6)spermatozoa/mL), the probability of ongoing pregnancy was higher in women allocated to IVF (p-value for interaction=0.06). In couples with unexplained or mild male subfertility, a low TMC might lead to higher pregnancy rates after IVF than after IUI-COH.

This paper describes the development and pilot test of a patient decision aid (DA) for this purpose. The development of the DA consisted of a literature search, establishment of the format, and a pilot test among IVF patients. The DA development was supervised by a panel of experts in the fields of subfertility, obstetrics and DA-research and it was based on the criteria of the International Patient Decision Aid Standards. One Cochrane review and 34 articles were selected for the DA content. The DA presents information in text, summaries, tables, figures and through an interactive worksheet. The DA was reviewed positively and as acceptable for use in clinical practice by patients and professionals. The DA was thoroughly developed and is likely to be helpful for the decision-making process for the number of embryos transferred after IVF. Physicians and researchers can use the DA without restriction in clinical practice or research related to decision-making.\n\nShould fertile people have access to in vitro fertilisation?\n\nPubMed\n\nDawson, K; Singer, P\n\n1990-01-20\n\nSome existing laws and some proposed legislation regulating the practice of in vitro fertilization (IVF) limit its availability to infertile couples. Dawson and Singer question whether it is reasonable to so restrict access to IVF, and examine some of the medical and social circumstances in which IVF and the related procedures of embryo freezing, embryo biopsy, and embryo transfer might be used by the fertile. They argue that while society may object to some uses of IVF by the fertile, the principle of governmental non-interference with personal liberties except to prevent harm mitigate against legally restricting IVF to the infertile.\n\n[No arguments to support an age limit for men entering an in vitro fertilisation or intracytoplasmic sperm injection programme].\n\nPubMed\n\nRÃ¶mkens, M; Gordijn, B; Verhaak, C M; Meuleman, E J H; Braat, D D M\n\n2005-04-30\n\nTo identify medical and psychosocial risks that could arise from allowing older men to father children through in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Literature review. The databases Medline, Current Contents weekly, Current Contents archives, and PsycINFO were searched over the period 1970--June 2004 for articles with data on age limits for men entering IVF/ICSI programmes. The following inclusion criteria were used: availability in the Netherlands and written in English or Dutch. Although sperm quality decreases with age, men remain fertile up to an advanced age. The risks of having children with autosomal dominant disorders or chromosomal defects increase slightly, but the individual chance is extremely small. Studies on the psychological development of children with fathers aged > 50 years are lacking. Extrapolation from other studies indicates that growing up with an older father has no negative influence on child development. Although older fathers have a greater chance of dying sooner, the absence of the father does not contribute significantly to psychological problems in offspring later in life. There are no medical or psychosocial arguments to support an age limit for men entering an IVF/ICSI programme.\n\nA randomised controlled trial of intra-uterine insemination versus in vitro fertilisation in patients with idiopathic or mild male infertility.\n\nPubMed\n\nElzeiny, Hossam; Garrett, Claire; Toledo, Manuela; Stern, Kate; McBain, John; Baker, Hugh William Gordon\n\n2014-04-01\n\nThe cause of infertility is unexplained or poorly explained in 30-40% of couples undergoing standard investigations, and treatment ranges from expectant management to IUI and IVF. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical pregnancy rates and costs of intra-uterine insemination (IUI) and in vitro fertilisation (IVF) in women where the same ovarian stimulation led to the development of two or three mature follicles. A randomised controlled clinical trial compared the efficacy of IUI and IVF in a tertiary fertility centre (ISRCTN28780587). Primary outcome measures were fetal heart positive pregnancy rate and cost per live birth. The selection criteria were age: females 18-42Â years and males 18-60Â years, infertility for one year or more, no IVF or IUI for 12Â months prior to the trial, and no coital, tubal or ovulatory disorders, oligospermia, untreated endometriosis or contraindication for multiple pregnancy. All women (nÂ =Â 102) had the same dose FSH stimulation protocol. Those who developed two or three preovulatory follicles were randomised 3:1 to IUI (nÂ =Â 33) or IVF (nÂ =Â 10). IUI or IVF was performed 36Â h after hCG administration with single or double embryo transfer on day two. Clinical pregnancy rates (40% vs 12%, PÂ =Â 0.04) and live birth rate (40% vs 6%, PÂ =Â 0.01) were higher for IVF than IUI. The cost per live birth was AU$8735 for IVF compared with $42,487 for IUI. This study provides evidence that IVF is more successful and cost-effective than IUI using the same doses of FSH. Further confirmatory studies are required.

Surgical management of hydrosalpinges before IVF improves outcome but these procedures are often contraindicated in women with dense pelvic adhesions. Tubal occlusion achieved by Essure(Â®) via hysteroscopy provides an alternative. To conduct a systematic review on the efficacy and safety of Essure(Â®) in the management of hydrosalpinx before IVF. We searched MEDLINE (January 1950 to July 2013), EMBASE (January 1980 to July 2013) and Web of Science (1899 to July 2013). We also searched reference lists of relevant articles and proceedings of relevant international conferences (2000-2013). All types of studies where women with suspected infertility and presence of hydrosalpinx had hysteroscopic tubal occlusion with Essure(Â®) before IVF. Two authors independently selected studies and extracted data. Where necessary, study authors were contacted for further data. In all, 115 women in 11 studies received Essure(Â®) , mainly in the outpatient setting where local anaesthesia by paracervical block and/or intravenous sedation was used. Successful placement of Essure(Â®) was achieved in 96.5% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 91.1-98.9%) of women and tubal occlusion in 98.1% (95% CI 93.1-99.9%). Subsequent IVF resulted in 38.6% pregnancy rate (95% CI 30.9-46.8%), 27.9% live birth rate (95% CI 21.1-35.8%) and 28.6% combined ongoing pregnancy and live birth rate (95% CI 21.7-36.6%) per embryo transfer. Essure(Â®) appears to be an effective option for management of hydrosalpinx in women before IVF although evidence from a randomised controlled clinical trial is lacking.

In vitro fertilisation is perceived as the last resort of infertility treatment. The impact of unsuccessful in vitro fertilisation treatment on psychological function has been documented; however, research comparing the levels of anxiety of women who cease and those who continue in vitro fertilisation post-failure is scant. A cross-sectional comparative study design was used. Fifty-eight women in whom in vitro fertilisation had failed within the previous year were recruited to this study from a medical centre in northern Taiwan; 34 women continued treatment and 24 discontinued treatment. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was used to assess their levels of anxiety. Women in the group who continued treatment exhibited higher state and trait anxiety (TA) than women in the group who discontinued treatment (p < 0Â·005). The number and frequency of in vitro fertilisation cycles were significantly higher in the group who continued treatment than in those who did not. A strong positive correlation between state and TA (r = 0Â·8, p < 0Â·01) existed in both groups. Both groups exhibited considerable levels of anxiety; however, the women who continued in vitro fertilisation treatment had higher levels of anxiety than those who discontinued treatment. The level of anxiety of women who decide to continue in vitro fertilisation treatment should be assessed as early as possible and counselling services provided to women who experience in vitro fertilisation failure should concentrate more on relieving psychological distress. One year after discontinuing treatment, some women still experience considerable anxiety; therefore, the care and assistance provided to these women need to be continually evaluated.

However, it is unclear whether CFTR is correlated with ovum fertilisation rate. The present study was to test the possible relationship between spermatozoa CFTR protein expression rate in healthy men and ovum fertilisation rate during in vitro fertilisation. Ninety-four couples for female factor infertility for IVF-ET treatments were retrospectively studied. All the patients were divided into three groups based on the fertilisation rate of ovum in vitro. It was performed to explore whether there were differences in sperm CFTR protein expression rate among the three groups and the relevance between CFTR protein expression rate and ovum fertilisation rate. Our study showed that there was no significant differences in sperm CFTR protein expression rate among the three groups (F = 0.614, P = 0.544), and the relevance between spermatozoa CFTR protein expression rate and ovum fertilisation rate was not significantly different (r = 0.013, P = 0.904). These results further suggest that CFTR protein expression rate in healthy men spermatozoa was not associated with ovum fertilisation rate and thus we cannot predict ovum fertilisation results by sperm CFTR protein expression rate.

Although Roman Catholic theology teaches that a human being is a union of physical body and spiritual soul, it is incorrect to interpret this in a dualistic sense. The meaning of 'soul' is considered and the conclusion reached that although both in the religious context and apart from it abortion is difficult to justify at any stage after conception, it does not follow that the use of 'spare' In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) embryos should be rejected. If 'ensoulment' does not occur until the new organism functions as a whole then a decision not to make use of IVF embryos for medical purposes would be a heavy responsibility and not a 'safe' way out.

Gamete unsuitability or loss was confirmed in both members of seven otherwise healthy couples presenting for reproductive endocrinology consultation over a 12-month interval in Ireland. IVF was undertaken with fresh oocytes provided by anonymous donors in Ukraine; frozen sperm (anonymous donor) was obtained from a licensed tissue establishment. For recipients, saline-enhanced sonography was used to assess intrauterine contour with endometrial preparation via transdermal estrogen. Among commissioning couples, mean+/-SD female and male age was 41.9 +/- 3.7 and 44.6 +/- 3.5 yrs, respectively. During this period, female age for non dual anonymous gamete donation IVF patients was 37.9 +/- 3 yrs (p < 0.001). Infertility duration was >/=3 yrs for couples enrolling in dual gamete donation, and each had >/=2 prior failed fertility treatments using native oocytes. All seven recipient couples proceeded to embryo transfer, although one patient had two transfers. Clinical pregnancy was achieved for 5/7 (71.4%) patients. Non-transferred cryopreserved embryos were available for all seven couples. Mean age of females undergoing dual anonymous donor gamete donation with IVF is significantly higher than the background IVF patient population. Even when neither partner is able to contribute any gametes for IVF, the clinical pregnancy rate per transfer can be satisfactory if both anonymous egg and sperm donation are used concurrently. Our report emphasises the role of pre-treatment counselling in dual anonymous gamete donation, and presents a coordinated screening and treatment approach in IVF where this option may be contemplated.\n\nAssociation of GSTM1 and GSTT1 gene polymorphisms and in-vitro fertilisation outcome in a population in northern Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nKarimlo, F K; Mashayekhi, F; Sorouri, Z Z; Bahador, M H; Salehi, Z\n\n2015-01-01\n\nImplantation failure is a major limiting step for in-vitro fertilisation (IVF). Embryo implantation is the result of the interaction of the embryo with the endometrium. Oxidative stress (OS) can cause defective embryo development and retardation. Genetic polymorphisms of detoxicating enzymes, such as glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), may play an important role in the outcome of embryo implantation. GSTM1 and GSTT1 are known to be highly polymorphic. The aim of this study was to examine the association of GSTM1 and GSTT1 gene polymorphisms with IVF-ET outcome in a population in northern Iran. Blood samples were collected from 120 infertile women who underwent an IVF cycle, and 108 healthy volunteers. Genomic DNA was prepared from peripheral blood leucocytes. Genotype frequencies were determined in patients and healthy controls using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). It was found that 25.8% of the infertile women and 0% of the controls had the GSTM1 null genotype (odds ratio (OR) = 76.37; 95% CI = 4.6-1,265.7; p = 0.0025). On the other hand, 5% of the cases and 0% of the controls had the GSTT1 null genotype (OR = 12.3, 95% CI = 0.68-221/3, p = 0.088). These results suggest that GSTM1 null type might be associated with IVF outcome in a population in northern Iran.\n\nParticipation of the sperm proteasome during in vitro fertilisation and the acrosome reaction in cattle.\n\nPubMed\n\nSÃ¡nchez, R; Deppe, M; Schulz, M; Bravo, P; Villegas, J; Morales, P; RisopatrÃ³n, J\n\n2011-04-01\n\nIn this work, we have investigated the role of the bovine sperm proteasome during in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and the acrosome reaction (AR). Motile spermatozoa, obtained by a swim-up method in Sperm-Talp medium, were capacitated for 3.5 h and incubated in the presence or absence of the specific proteasome inhibitor epoxomicin for 30 and 60 min. Then, the spermatozoa were co-incubated with mature bovine cumulus oocytes and after 48 h the cleavage rate of inseminated oocytes was evaluated. In addition, we evaluated the participation of the sperm proteasome during the progesterone-induced AR. Capacitated spermatozoa were incubated for 30 min with or without epoxomicin, then progesterone was added and the ARs were evaluated using the dual fluorescent staining technique 'Hoechst and chlortetracycline'. The results indicate that the proteasome inhibitor decreased the cleavage rate of oocytes inseminated with treated spermatozoa. In addition, acrosomal exocytosis levels were statistically significantly higher in the samples treated with the AR inducer progesterone than in control samples in the absence of the inducer. However, the progesterone-induced AR was significantly reduced by previous treatment of the spermatozoa with epoxomicin (P < 0.001). These observations indicate that the bovine sperm proteasome participates in the IVF and AR processes.

In Experiment 1, pooled ejaculated sperm-rich fractions were frozen in 0.5 ml straws after dilution in extender supplemented with pentoxifylline to a final concentration of 0, 2, 4, 8, 16 or 32 mM. The addition of 4, 8, 16 and 32 mM pentoxifylline to the freezing extender significantly decreased the progressive and total motility of spermatozoa. The percentage of viable spermatozoa with intact acrosomes as well as the penetration rate and the efficiency of fertilisation were significantly lower in pentoxifylline-treated groups compared with the untreated control. In Experiment 2, a pool of three straws with 'good' post-thaw sperm quality parameters and another three straws with 'poor' sperm quality were diluted in extender with 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 or 32 mM pentoxifylline. Post-thaw samples with both 'good' and 'poor' sperm quality with 0, 2, 4, 8 and 16 mM were used to assess IVF parameters. The addition of pentoxifylline to post-thaw extender did not improve the post-thaw motility or viability of spermatozoa compared with the control. The in vitro penetration was higher (P<0.05) than the control for oocytes fertilised with spermatozoa that were thawed and incubated in extender with 4, 8 and 16 mM pentoxifylline. However, no differences were observed in the efficiency of fertilisation. We conclude that pentoxifylline, as a supplement added to the freezing extender, has a deleterious effect and that it does not improve the survival or in vitro fertilising efficiency of frozen-thawed boar spermatozoa when added after thawing.\n\nIVF twins: buy one get one free?\n\nPubMed\n\nIsmail, Laura; Mittal, Monica; Kalu, Emmanuel\n\n2012-10-01\n\nThere has been an overall increase in the incidence of multiple pregnancies and assisted reproduction technology is largely responsible for this rise. Although twins may appeal to couples undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF), they have been associated with serious health consequences to the babies, their mothers and the family unit, as well as having massive financial implications for the National Health Service. Transfer of more than one embryo during IVF is mainly responsible for IVF twins, and elective transfer of a single embryo at a time with cryopreservation of surplus embryos for later transfer has been shown to be an effective strategy to minimise the risk of twins without compromising IVF success rates. Factors that will impact on the success of the policy of elective single embryo transfer (eSET) include improvement in embryo selection for transfer, better cryopreservation techniques and adequate state funding for IVF. However, in implementing the policy of eSET it is important that each case is assessed on an individual basis since in some situations (e.g. in older women) the transfer of two embryos may be more cost effective. Adequate and continuous education of all stakeholders is essential if the policy of eSET is to be successful in the UK.\n\nThe long path to pregnancy: early experience with dual anonymous gamete donation in a European in vitro fertilisation referral centre\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2010-01-01\n\nBackground This investigation describes features of patients undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and embryo transfer (ET) where both gametes were obtained from anonymous donors.

The aim of this study was to determine if hyperactivated motility (HAM) and acrosome reaction (AR) can be useful tests for evaluating semen quality during male infertility evaluations and to help the clinician decide whether regular insemination or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is preferable during in vitro fertilisation. A prospective study was conducted. Patients with normal sperm according to World Health Organization guidelines who underwent IVF treatment and planned regular insemination were asked to participate. A portion of sperm sample was evaluated for HAM and AR on day of ovum pick up. In HAM assessment, 93.3% of patients with increased HAM had a high fertilisation rate compared with 64% in the group without increased HAM (P = 0.059). For the AR evaluation, 91.7% of samples with a low rate of spontaneous AR had a high fertilisation rate compared with 39.3% in the group with a high rate of spontaneous AR (P = 0.004).

This population based study is aimed at analyzing the presence of congenital malformations in a large group of infants born after IVF and to compare malformation risk both with that of all infants born and according to IVF method used. Infants born after IVF during the period 1982-2001 were ascertained from all IVF clinics in Sweden. The presence of congenital malformations was identified from three national health registers: the Swedish Medical Birth Register, the Swedish Registry of Congenital Malformations, and the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register. The IVF children were compared with all children born in Sweden during the same period and recorded in the Swedish Medical Birth Register. Among 16,280 IVF children (30% conceived after intracytoplasmatic sperm injection [ICSI]) a 42% excess of any congenital malformation was found, explainable by parental characteristics and in some cases by the high rate of multiple births. Among these children, 8% had a congenital malformation, and 5% had a relatively severe condition. For neural tube defects, choanal atresia, and alimentary tract atresia, an additional risk increase was seen. There was no difference in malformation rate according to IVF method except for an excess of hypospadias after ICSI. An increased risk for congenital malformations occurs after IVF, similar for the different IVF techniques used, and mainly a consequence of parental characteristics. A few specific conditions show an extra increase in risk.

Psychological and counselling interventions have previously been widely recommended in parallel with infertility treatments but whilst in many jurisdictions counselling is recommended or mandatory, it may not be widely used. Acupuncture is increasingly used as an adjunct to IVF, in this preliminary study we sought to investigate the experience of infertile women who had used acupuncture to improve their fertility. Methods A sample of 20 women was drawn from a cohort of women who had attended for a minimum of four acupuncture sessions in the practices of two acupuncturists in South Australia. Eight women were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire. Six had sought acupuncture during IVF treatment and two had begun acupuncture to enhance their fertility and had later progressed to IVF. Descriptive content analysis was employed to analyse the data. Results Four major categories of perceptions about acupuncture in relation to reproductive health were identified: (a) Awareness of, and perceived benefits of acupuncture; (b) perceptions of the body and the impact of acupuncture upon it; (c) perceptions of stress and the impact of acupuncture on resilience; and (d) perceptions of the intersection of medical treatment and acupuncture. Conclusion This preliminary exploration, whilst confined to a small sample of women, confirms that acupuncture is indeed perceived by infertile women to have an impact to their health. All findings outlined here are reported cautiously because they are limited by the size of the sample. They suggest that further studies of acupuncture as an adjunct to IVF should systematically explore the issues of wellbeing, anxiety, personal and social resilience and women's identity in relation to sexuality and reproduction.

However, few studies have specifically examined this association in births resulting from in vitro fertilisation (IVF). A retrospective cohort study was conducted in 97288 singleton and 40961 twin pregnancies resulting from fresh non-donor IVF cycles using 2006-10 data from the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology Clinic Online Reporting System. Rates of very early preterm (<28), early preterm (<32), and preterm birth (<37 completed weeks) decreased with increasing maternal age in both singleton and twin births (PTrend <0.01). With women aged 30-34 years as the reference, those aged <30 years were at an increased risk of all types of preterm births. The adjusted odd ratio (95% confidence interval [CI]) for very early preterm birth, early preterm birth, and preterm birth in women aged 25-29 years were 1.3 [95% CI 1.1, 1.5], 1.2 [95% CI 1.1, 1.4], and 1.1 [95% CI 1.02, 1.2] in singletons. This increased risk of preterm births among younger women was even more significant in twin births. However, women aged â¥ 35 years were not at an increased risk of any type of preterm births in both singleton and twin births. In contrast to natural conception, advanced maternal age is no"
