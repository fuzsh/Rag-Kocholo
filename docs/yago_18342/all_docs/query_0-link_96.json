        "text": "Executive Summary Economic growth in Sri Lanka has been among the fastest in South Asia in recent years. The growth averaged 6.3 percent in 2002 - 2013, with GDP per capita rising from US$859 in 2000 to US$ 3,256 in 2013. The preliminary indication is the rise of GDP further by 7.8 percent in 2014. Despite of this growth and development trend, poverty reduction in Sri Lanka has been slow due to widening inequalities among income groups and across regions, sectors and groups, since the growth concentrated on key urban areas of the Western Province. Consequently, the trade-off between economic growth and social welfare (poverty alleviation) has been a much debated issue. The issue in the context of the current higher economic growth trajectory is whether it would enable the country’s social indicators to improve. There are some concerns that the path, processes and priorities of economic growth would shrug off the social welfare of the country. These concerns stem from various observations. The expenditure on education, health, social welfare programs and projects as a percentage of GDP is declining and poorly sustains the achievements in these areas. Besides, there are new concerns in the post war era. The rehabilitation of the people whose livelihoods have been devastated by the war and the large number of children, displaced persons subject to physical injuries and mental trauma requiring medical attention and welfare measures pose serious challenges. Further, there emerging diverse problems concerning a rapidly ageing population. Therefore, more inclusive economic growth will require easing of specific constraints affecting particular sectors, regions, and groups, but priorities include improving of the quality of education, access to infrastructure such as electricity, health services, education and connectivity to markets in urban centers, and access to finance for micro-enterprises. These improvements will expand opportunities for the poor and those in backward regions in terms of moving to higher paying occupations, setting up or expanding microenterprises, or migrating to work in modern industries. Since many of these opportunities are created in the urban sector, poverty reduction will require better and simultaneous coordination between rural development strategies and urban planning and development. Poverty is the most intractable problem in the country. Despite the economic growth, poverty persists at an unacceptable level in many rural, urban and estate areas and have many manifestations. Average national statistics do not capture the full range of amounts and variety of poverty conditions that are dominant, as poverty is a multifaceted and multidimensional issue. Even though income poverty is important, there are many other facets of poverty that are not captured by the levels of income alone. Economic growth alone will not reduce poverty, good governance, the nature of economic strategies, people’s attitudes, public expenditure patterns and structural reforms are needed to make a serious breakthrough in poverty. The latest statistics on poverty in Sri Lanka released by the Department of Census and Statistics reveal a fall in the head count in poverty in the Island and a drastic reduction in poverty on the estate. There was uncertainty about the comparability of these statistics with those of previous surveys. It is more important to note that the multidimensional aspects of poverty in its appearance on poverty around the country as well as in other South Asian countries. It was also pointed out that inflation erodes the real incomes of the poor seriously and natural disasters of floods, tsunami and drought affect the poor adversely. The impact of the war was immeasurable and the rehabilitation of the displaced poor, not only in terms of housing but also in adequate livelihoods opportunities would constitute a daunting challenge in the era of post war at present in Sri Lanka. However, Sri Lanka’s poverty status (according to some social development indicators) has shown slow progress in recent decades and failed to keep up with the promise of early progress. This can be closely attributed to inadequate investment in education, health and other social welfare measures. Besides, some of the welfare measures do not reach the intended beneficiaries. Expenditure on caring for the elderly is grossly inadequate. Three policy thrusts are needed to improve the country’s poverty conditions. • First, the strategy and process of economic development should be more pro-poor oriented and focused on areas of development such as agriculture, education, information technology, small and medium entrepreneurship expansion and health supports that would benefit the poor. • Second, there must be much higher expenditure on social infrastructure and recurrent social expenditure on agricultural technology, agricultural insurance, natural resource management, renewable energy, women empowerment and emerging needs of natural disasters, climate changes and calamities. • Third, funds expended on social welfare must be better targeted to reach the justifiable in provinces, regions, districts or communities rather than political bias or radical decisions and there is a need to increase the allocation of investment on research and development. Addressing these three policy thrusts areas in economic, technological, human resource, and social issues, the following most important reformist approaches should be introduced. • New constituencies for community problem solving • The design of new institutions relating to rules and regulation for market transaction • National level policy and program evaluations (standardization criteria) • Technical assistance in implementing new plans and projects Prioritization of social expenditure along with economic infrastructure development is imperative. Much social expenditure is more important than some economic infrastructure investments with uncertain returns. Since resources available to the state are limited, the extra expenditure on social development must come from increased revenue collection and curtailment of excessive and wasteful government expenditure. There are real concerns that public expenditure is not prioritized to meet significant goals of economic or social development. On the other hand, economic growth is achieved neglecting the social welfare of the country. Against this backdrop, Sri Lanka is in the midst of fundamental political change followed by the election of the new President of the country in January 2015. The new government has pledged new reforms under its 100 days program in short term and it is expected that a newly elected government would focus on corresponding long term economic policy directions, with special reference to policies to address poverty reduction, while addressing multiple dimensions simultaneously."
