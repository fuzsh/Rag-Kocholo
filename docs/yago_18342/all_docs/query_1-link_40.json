        "text": "Acquiring the credit card portfolio of Gap Inc. and its family of brands including Old Navy; Gap; Banana Republic; Athleta has been one of the most exciting and complex projects we’ve undertaken within Barclays Bank US. We are now the exclusive issuer for Gap’s $3.5 billion credit card portfolio and have doubled our U.S. customer base. Cross-functional teams across the business put in more than one million hours of work to ensure we delivered for our new customers. Transformative technology changes were also made to provide seamless customer experiences. We are delighted to partner with such an iconic brand, one who shares our sustainability values and goals - Gap’s branded cards are made with a core of recycled plastic. I want to thank all of those involved for their hard work and collaborative spirit. And of course, to our 10 million new customers - welcome!\n\nOnce upon a time, there lived a crow. He was a firm believer in #YOLO. He used to fly far and wide to quench his thirst for life. One day, he flew across a large body of water to a restaurant he fancied. He feasted on some great leftovers that day. Chilli Chicken. Gobi Manchurian. Stuffed Kulchas. Name it. Midway through his flight back home, he received the call of nature in the form a grumbling stomach. He was flying over water and didn't want to do his pooping business there - because fish live there. Duh. As pressure built in his tummy, he began to look for an appropriate place to dump his misery. And then, a hundred metres or so away, he spotted an island. It was named LinkedIn. He hovered over LinkedIn for a few seconds, made sure nobody was in the path of his poop, and did the deed. It landed harmlessly and the relieved crow flew away. In a matter of minutes, the poop that landed on LinkedIn turned into a story. The story of a resourceful crow full of empathy. How it rose above the odds stacked against it and took a considerate and brave dump. A tale of courage and selflessness. An inspirational saga of an ordinary crow born to another ordinary crow from a humble background. \"Be like the crow\" or something along those lines would be the story's punchline.
