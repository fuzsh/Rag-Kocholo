Please consider supporting local journalism by subscribing to the Journal at PoughkeepsieJournal.com/subscribe.\n\nEmmy- and Grammy-winning musician Adam Schlesinger, co-founder of the band Fountains of Wayne, died Wednesday due to coronavirus complications, according to his longtime attorney, Josh Grier.\n\nThe 52-year-old was a Dutchess County resident, according to a comment from County Executive Marc Molinaro on his own Facebook post regarding Schlesinger's passing. The comment has since been deleted, and Molinaro subsequently declined to comment to the Journal on Schlesinger's residency, citing privacy reasons.\n\nGrier said Schlesinger died at an \"upstate hospital,\" and the New York TImes reported he died in Poughkeepsie.\n\nIn posting the New York Times article on Facebook, Molinaro wrote, \"Adam Schlesinger still had songs to write, plays to score & life to live. Like far too many, he was taken too early by a disease that knows no social, geographic or economic boundaries. We join his family, friends and devoted fans in mourning his death and celebrating his life‚Ä¨.\"\n\nSchlesinger had been sedated and on a ventilator for several days, Grier told the Associated Press.\n\nPreviously, five coronavirus-related deaths have been announced by the county, the latest being a 68-year-old woman on Wednesday. The identities of previous victims have not been revealed.\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon there were 547 confirmed cases in Dutchess County, according to the state. The county said numbers are expected to continue to rise as testing continues.\n\nFran Drescher, who was developing \"The Nanny\" musical on Broadway with Schlesinger, wrote on Instagram: \"We will miss you .... Devastedüò•üò≠üò© My prayers are for you. May peace be with you.\"\n\nThe songwriter formed the power-pop group Fountains of Wayne, playing bass, with Chris Collingwood, who played guitar and sang lead vocals, in 1995. The band was named after a lawn ornament store in Wayne, New Jersey, near Schlesinger‚Äôs Montclair hometown. The 2003 hit \"Stacy's Mom,\" which had a music video featuring model Rachel Hunter, was the band's most popular song.\n\nHe received Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for writing the theme song to the 1996 Tom Hanks-directed movie ‚ÄúThat Thing You Do!\" Hanks referenced the movie's fictional Playtone Record Label paying tribute on Twitter.\n\n\"There would be no Playtone without Adam Schlesinger,\" wrote Hanks. \"He was a One-der. Lost him to Covid-19. Terribly sad today.\"\n\nSchlesinger won two Emmys for parody songs written for the 2012 and 2013 Tony Awards telecasts, and won another last year for co-writing ‚ÄúAntidepressants Are So Not a Big Deal‚Äù for Rachel Bloom‚Äôs CW series \"Crazy Ex-Girlfriend.\" His other television and film credits include ‚ÄúSesame Street,‚Äù ‚ÄúMusic and Lyrics‚Äù and ‚ÄúShallow Hal.‚Äù\n\nSchlesinger was also nominated for two Tony Awards, including best musical for the 2008 Broadway show ‚ÄúCry-Baby,‚Äù an adaptation of the John Waters comedy starring Johnny Depp.\n\nHe won the 2009 Grammy for best comedy album for writing the songs on ‚ÄúA Colbert Christmas: The Greatest Gift of All!‚Äù a companion to a TV Christmas special with songs performed by Stephen Colbert and Elvis Costello.\n\nSchlesinger, the cousin of ‚ÄúThe Walking Dead‚Äù actor Jon Bernthal, leaves two daughters.\n\nFountains of Wayne's most recent album, \"Sky Full of Holes,\" was released in 2011.\n\n\"I think part of the reason we still exist is because we're so slow between records. ... We tend to put out a record every three to four years and then do some touring and then we get away from each other for a while,\" Schlesinger told the Asbury Park Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, in 2011. \"It's always a nice thing to come back to, but it definitely doesn't feel like that much time has elapsed. I feel pretty much like the same guy.\""
