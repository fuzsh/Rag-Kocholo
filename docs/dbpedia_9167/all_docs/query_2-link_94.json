        "text": "Multiplatinum alt-rockers Fastball are back, and they’re not shying away from, but embracing, their knack for writing hits with their latest album Sonic Ranch. Reflecting on their meteoric rise with the chart-topping debut \"The Way,\" guitarist/vocalist Miles Zuniga quips, \"I like to say that 'The Way' gave us the freedom to continue doing what we do.\" And what Fastball does best is write hits, whether they become big ones or not. The new album, produced by David Garza (Fiona Apple) and John Fields (Demi Lovato, Miley Cyrus) cuts out all the fat for ten lean and tight sing-along gems that blend the pop smarts the band’s known for with the wisdom gleaned from 30 years together.\n\nFormed in 1994 in Austin, Texas, Fastball brought together a love for melodic, Beatles-inspired pop and the alternative edge of late-'90s mainstream rock. Guitarist/vocalist Miles Zuniga, bassist/vocalist Tony Scalzo, and drummer Joey Shuffield, all veterans of Austin's underground rock scene, originally banded together under the name Magneto U.S.A. After signing with Hollywood Records, they rebranded as Fastball and released their debut album, Make Your Mama Proud, in 1996. This album showcased their knack for blending modern flair with classic pop hooks, a combination that would soon catapult them into the mainstream. That breakthrough came with the follow-up album, All The Pain Money Can Buy, in early 1998. The lead single, \"The Way,\" became a runaway hit, topping the American rock charts for seven weeks and achieving crossover success on pop charts. Hits like \"Fire Escape\" and the piano-driven \"Out Of My Head\" followed suit, and the album went platinum within six months, earning two Grammy nominations.\n\nIn fall 2000, Fastball released The Harsh Light Of Day, featuring piano work by Billy Preston and straying from their brand of alt-pop a little bit for an increasingly arty sound, but they still had a Top 40 hit with \"You're An Ocean.\" Following a retrospective compilation, Painting The Corners: The Best Of Fastball in 2002, their 2004 album, Keep Your Wig On, co-produced by Adam Schlesinger, marked a return to their power pop roots and reinvigorated their spirit, which continued with the 2009 album Little White Lies. After years of focusing on live performances, Fastball returned to the studio in 2015, recording in their hometown of Austin. This culminated in the 2017 self-released album, Step Into Light. In 2018, they celebrated the 20th anniversary of All The Pain Money Can Buy with an expanded edition and a hometown concert. In October 2019, they released The Help Machine, produced by Steve Berlin of Los Lobos, and in 2021 and 2022 they released music exclusively through Patreon. In 2023, the released Smashed Hits, on which they perform their biggest hits from the '90s live plus a few surprises for good measure.\n\nWith Sonic Ranch, Fastball continues to demonstrate why they’ve lasted this long capturing the essence of their 30-year run with songs both catchy and profound. Fastball's ability to evolve while getting back to their roots is evident in every note. And they’ll continue to write the hits, because after all, that’s what they do."
