        "text": "Mike Viola might be the most popular rocker most people have never heard of.\n\nThat’s because the Stoughton native’s gift for pop songwriting has most often been heard in movie theaters, as part of the 1996 Beatlesque film “That Thing You Do,” which earned an Oscar nomination for its title song (which he sang), in 2007’s “Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story,” about an over-the-top country star, and most recently a couple years ago with the tunes he provided for the dissolute rock star in the Russell Brand comedy “Get Him to the Greek.”\n\nViola appears this Sunday night at the Brighton Music Hall, when his band opens for soulful popster Rachael Yamagata.\n\n(Viola and Yamagata are also at the Iron Horse in Northampton tonight.) The Yamagata connection comes from another facet of Viola’s career, one of his many collaborations as co-writer or producer for a bevy of the music world’s top stars. A short list of Viola’s collaborative efforts would include work with Ryan Adams, Dan Bern, John Wesley Harding, and Adam Schlesinger of Fountains of Wayne. Viola has been Mandy Moore’s musical director for several years. He also plays guitar throughout Yamagata’s new “Chesapeake,” her third album, also just out.\n\nBoston-area fans will remember Viola from his early bands, The Mike Viola Alliance and The Snap, and more recently from his early 1990s group The Candy Butchers, which released three albums, and appeared several times on Conan O’Brien’s show.\n\nCandy Butchers survived into the new millennium even after Viola relocated to New York City, and scaled it down to a duo with longtime cohort Todd Foulsham. And in 2008, Viola was part of a Beantown super-group, the Major Labels, which included indie-rocker Bleu and legendary drummer/studio wizard Ducky Carlisle.\n\nThese days, Viola is based in Los Angeles, where his output includes a 2005 concert album “Just Before Dark: Live at Largo” done at the L.A. nightclub, and the more recent “Lurch,” his first solo band record. This fall marks the release of Viola’s latest album, “Electro De Perfecto,” another collection of sweet pop melodies and the kind of keening vocals that suggest if John Lennon had a kid brother, he’s sound a lot like this.\n\nViola’s most recent local appearance was in August, when he was a centerpiece, with Lori McKenna, of a benefit show to help preserve the Stoughton Theater in his hometown.\n\nThat developed out of a visit home, when this 1985 Stoughton High grad was doing what every self-respecting New Englander does – freezing at the Thanksgiving Day football game.\n\n“I saw so many people at that game, and felt that hometown pride all over again,” Viola said from his Los Angeles digs.\n\n“But then I was driving through the center of town and seeing all those empty storefronts. I felt like there’s no reason we can’t re-invigorate Main Street – if we’ve got people coming here from all over New England for the IKEA store, we ought to have some culture to draw them into Stoughton center too.\n\n“That started us spinning ideas around,” said Viola. “I learned about a 22-year old actor trying to save the Stoughton Theater, and we decided a benefit concert might really help make people aware of that effort, and perhaps attract support. This is a concept you see all over the country – these little community theaters being revived. Lori McKenna got involved, and we put together that concert at Club Passim, and ended up raising $5,000 to $6,000.’’\n\n“My first meeting with Rachael came through Mandy Moore,” said Viola. “Rachael and Mandy and I wrote a Christmas song together, and we really discovered that we loved writing together. When she was writing her next record, I spent a couple weeks up here with her and we found again that we work very easily, and productively together. I love her new record, and touring together was just a natural.”\n\nIt’s probably unavoidable, but being so capable at working with a wide variety of artists means Viola’s own work gets sidetracked. To try and avoid that, he’s trying to take a little break from collaborating while he’s introducing his new record.\n\n“All my other writing and producing things are on a back burner while I’m on tour,” Viola chuckled. “I do have a MacBook Air, so I could still do stuff, but I do not want to be tied to a computer all day. Part of the enjoyment of being on tour, for me, has always been just being able to get out, get around, and look at all the different parts of the country.”\n\nLongtime Viola fans will find much to savor in Viola’s new album. I might be partial to the buoyant rocker “Get You Back,” but many others might prefer the tenacious optimisim of “El Mundo de Perfecto.”\n\nIt was done live in the studio – I can do the whole, fully-produced kind of album, but I prefer this. There are barely any overdubs, and it’s basically our live show. What we got is an even more souped-up version of my music, which I believe has always been a pretty energetic style.”\n\nNever was that vivacious style utilized better for comedic effect than in “Walk Hard,” with actor John C. Reilly the embodiment of every country star, or rocker, dangling way out there on the edge of excess. Not only did Viola pen seven of the tunes used in the movies’ often hilarious soundtrack, he took Reilly on the road with a concert tour timed to coincide with the film’s opening back in 2007.\n\n“I really did get a lot of work out of ‘‘Walk Hard,” Viola noted. “I continue to get work today from people who saw that movie. I believe in doing the best work you can do, so I’m pretty selective and strict about what I allow myself to do. There’s always an ebb and flow to this business, but if you’re true to yourself and work hard, and never do things contrary to what you think is best, you’ll be alright. That film was a great experience with a lot of talented people, especially John C. Reilly, and subsequently all kinds of work came to me. I’ve really been approached for all sorts of Hollywood projects, but I prefer touring and performing my own work.\n\nViola moved to New York City in 1992, and relocated to L.A. about three years ago, but he’s always kept a regular gig schedule in his home area, so old fans and friends can be sure to catch him at smaller venues like the Lizard Lounge in Cambridge.\n\n“I have always loved playing in Boston,” said Viola. “It isn’t just the old friends and family connection, and all the fans there that know me, but since it’s a college town you can always find new fans too. I try and play the Lizard Lounge three or four times a year. I have played the old Harpers Ferry too, but this is my first time since it’s renovated into the Brighton Music Hall, so I’m interested to see the new place.”\n\nLATE DATES: Hollywood comes to Quincy in another form Saturday night, when Future Bar Music Lounge welcomes The Young Rapscallions. Also Saturday, Patsy Whelan returns to Paddy Barry’s in Quincy with guitar ace Paul Kenny.\n\nREAD MORE about this issue."
