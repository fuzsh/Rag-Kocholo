There was an 8-year hiatus between albums #4 and #5 (which was certified x4 Platinum, and received the 2002 Grammy for Best Pop Vocal Album), and a 10-year hiatus between #5 and #6. Soldier of Love (#6) was a debut #1 album in the U.S. and was certified Platinum. Her music has encompassed jazz, soul, R&B, soft rock, dub, reggae, neo soul and lovers rock. Her services to music were recognised with an award of an OBE in 2002, and a CBE in 2017.\n\nBorn Edward Christopher Sheeran, in Halifax, West Yorkshire, 17 February 1991, ES is a singer-songwriter, guitarist and record producer.

Raised primarily in Texas, he lived for much of his life in Portland, OR. Smith suffered from depression, alcoholism and drug dependence, and these topics often appear in his lyrics. He died from two stab wounds to the chest. The autopsy evidence was inconclusive as to whether the wounds were self-inflicted. He released five albums. Two albums have been released posthumously: From A Basement On A Hill (2004) and New Moon (2007).\n\nBorn Regina Ilyinichna Spektor, 18 February 1980, in Moscow.

Her 2001 debut album, 11:11, was self-released on CD and sold at her early shows. Rarer, now, than hens’ teeth!"
