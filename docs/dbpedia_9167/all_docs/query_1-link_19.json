        "text": "He died on Wednesday morning, according to Variety.\n\nA statement from his family on Tuesday said he was in hospital in New York fighting Covid-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus.\n\nChris Carrabba, from the band Dashboard Confessional, confirmed his death.\n\n“I am grasping for the right words” he tweeted. “My dear friend Adam Schlesinger has passed away from COVID-19.”\n\nCarrabba added: “I knew him best as a mentor, and a friend. We must take this seriously. People are sick and dying. It is hard to stay locked indoors but lives will be saved. Take care of each other. Rest In Peace, my dear friend.”\n\nSchlesinger earned an Oscar nomination in 1997 for writing the title track on That Thing You Do!, a musical comedy directed by Tom Hanks.\n\nHanks paid tribute on Twitter and said he would not have launched his Playtone record label and production company without Schlesinger’s help.\n\n“He was a One-der,” Hanks, who also tested positive for coronavirus, said. “Lost him to Covid-19. Terribly sad today. Hanx.”\n\nAline Brosh McKenna co-created TV musical comedy-drama Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, which Schlesinger wrote songs for.\n\nShe paid tribute on Twitter, saying she had known Schlesinger since the early 1990s. She said: “Adam was so funny, so kind, so opinionated, so clever, so passionate. We worked together and agreed and disagreed and rejoiced and bemoaned and celebrated and it felt extra sweet for me because I’d known him so long.\n\n“I love that guy. I love all the memories.”\n\nMcKenna also shared a song he sent to her and Crazy Ex-Girlfriend star Rachel Bloom.\n\nMusicians who had worked with Schlesinger paid tribute. Singer-songwriter Nicole Atkins said he was “really sweet and beyond talented”.\n\nShe tweeted: “I’m heartbroken to hear about Adam Schlesinger’s passing. He was one of the 1st people I ever co-wrote a song with and we went on the road with Fountains of Wayne back in the day. He was really sweet and beyond talented. My heart goes out to his family and band mates.”\n\nAcclaimed songwriter Diane Warren said: “RIP Adam Schlesinger. Love and prayers to his family. Thank U for the songs.”\n\nSchlesinger was divorced and is survived by his two daughters. He was best known as the bass player and co-songwriter of Fountains Of Wayne, the power pop band whose hits included Stacy’s Mom and Hey Julie.\n\nThey formed in New Jersey in 1995 and were named after a lawn ornament store in the state.\n\nOver his career, Schlesinger earned nominations for an Oscar, a Golden Globe, Tonys, Grammys and Emmys, winning the latter two.\n\nIn 2019 he won the Emmy for outstanding original music and lyrics for Antidepressants Are So Not A Big Deal from TV musical drama Crazy Ex-Girlfriend.\n\nIt was one of his three Emmy wins. Schlesinger won a Grammy in 2009 for his work on A Colbert Christmas: The Greatest Gift Of All!\n\nThe White House has projected tens of thousands of Americans are likely to be killed by the disease."
