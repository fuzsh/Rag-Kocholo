This album was the third out of what ended up being a total of five put out by FofW, so it essentially represents the midpoint of their career.\n\nComing in at about an hour, it's chock full of power pop gems spanning 17 tracks. There are hooks galore so you're likely to find something to like even if it's not any of the songs I think you should check out first. So, whether you give my tracks a listen or not, don't skip this record - I guarantee there will be something in there for you."
