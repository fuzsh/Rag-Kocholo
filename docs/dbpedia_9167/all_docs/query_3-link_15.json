        "text": "Adam Schlesinger could do everything, but he didn’t like to shout about it. Not everybody realised that the guy behind Fountains Of Wayne’s chipper 2004 hit “Stacy’s Mom” was the same person who perfected the art of the comedy song in Crazy Ex-Girlfriend or produced the best Monkees album since the 1960s. When he died of complications from Covid-19 yesterday, he was halfway to an EGOT, the quadruple crown of show business, having won three Emmys and a Grammy and been nominated for Oscars and Tonys. It sometimes seemed as if he could write a great song about any subject in any style and in any medium.\n\n“When I was in my early twenties and trying to figure out how to be a songwriter, it would literally keep me up at night,” he told me in 2016. “What am I? What is my style? Everybody has broad tastes, and you have to make some choices, but then I had this revelation – it’s really just about having the focus for the particular project you’re working on. It doesn’t have to define you for all time.”\n\nBorn in New York and raised in New Jersey, Schlesinger was spinning plates from the start. In the mid-1990s he formed two bands (Fountains Of Wayne and Ivy), wrote music for The Dana Carvey Show and submitted a song for Tom Hanks’ feelgood comedy That Thing You Do! It was a tough brief for a relative unknown – write a song irresistible enough to be a credible hit for a bunch of Beatles-besotted American teenagers in 1964 – but Schlesinger nailed it, to the extent that it became not just the movie’s giddy heartbeat but a real-world hit. As he enjoyed noting, it missed the Top 40 by just one place. “Just like the acting has to be convincing, the songs have to be convincing,” he told me. “You have to believe that this music could be popular.”\n\nSchlesinger became a one-man Brill Building for fictional bands in movies, such as Josie And The Pussycats and the Hugh Grant romcom Music And Lyrics, and comedians including Sarah Silverman and Stephen Colbert. He’s certainly the only songwriter whose work has been performed by Willie Nelson, Nicki Minaj, Kristen Bell, Peter Dinklage, Neil Patrick Harris, will.i.am and the puppets of Sesame Street.\n\nLike a great impressionist, Schlesinger grounded his mimicry in deep knowledge and appreciation of his source material. “Meaningless Kiss” in Music And Lyrics is both a spot-on parody of a Wham! ballad and a real earworm. “I didn’t want it to be completely ridiculous, but slightly ridiculous,” he said. “I want to write something I actually want to listen to, even if it’s silly.” As TV critic Alan Sepinwall observed, he “was The Princess Bride of songwriters. His stuff worked beautifully as a goof, but also as the genuine article.”\n\nSchlesinger’s talent was in full flower during the four series of Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. With Jack Dolgen and the show’s creator and star Rachel Bloom, he wrote 157 songs, all of them funny, many of them brilliant, which served the story and characters while spoofing everyone from Abba and Beyoncé to Cole Porter and Billy Joel. He was a fast learner who could get under the bonnet of any artist or genre, understand how it worked and do something fun with it. The same gift that made Schlesinger an expert parodist could also be applied to sincere homages to a band’s glory days, as The Monkees’ superb 2016 album Good Times! demonstrated. “They’re a fictional band who became a real band,” he said. “So that line between what’s real and what’s fake goes away really easily sometimes.”\n\nLest we forget, between 1996 and 2011, Schlesinger juggled his stage and screen work with Fountains Of Wayne, power-pop storytellers in the tradition of The Kinks and The Cars. Anyone who only remembers “Stacy’s Mom” might not appreciate the wit and empathy with which he chronicled ordinary lives on songs such as “It Must Be Summer” and “All Kinds Of Time”.\n\n“A rule of thumb is if one of our songs has a New Jersey reference, or is about high school, that’s one of Adam’s,” said frontman Chris Collingwood. Schlesinger could write character studies with enough depth to justify a movie and he could break your heart with a joke. He also made sophisticated pop with Ivy and bouncy classic rock with the supergroup Tinted Windows and wrote the music for the John Waters musical Cry-Baby. As long as he had a deadline, he said, he could always find inspiration.\n\nNext month was supposed to see the off-Broadway debut of The Bedwetter, Schlesinger’s collaboration with Sarah Silverman. Instead, the musical is suspended and the man is gone, at the shockingly premature age of 52, leaving behind perhaps the most diverse body of work of his generation as well as countless anecdotes about his good humour and generosity. There are so many ways to remember him.\n\nNow read\n\nThe origins of The Specials’ ‘Ghost Town’ (and why it eerily resonates today)\n\nThe 14 songs that prove Joni Mitchell's genius\n\nThe 15 Bob Marley facts you need to know"
