I’m forging a pitchfork out of molten steel right now.\n\nPiers Morgan (@piersmorgan): Breaking: Oscars ratings crash to an all-time low, down a staggering 58% on last year’s Awards (which was also an all-time low.) As I feared, the woke brigade may have now destroyed the biggest, glitziest event in show business.\n\nJulius Sharpe (@juliussharpe): Lotta pressure on the next Oscars host to somehow top nobody.\n\nAwards\n\n93rd Academy Awards\n\nWinners:\n\nBest Picture: Nomadland\n\nDirector: Chloé Zhao – Nomadland\n\nActor: Anthony Hopkins – The Father\n\nActress: Frances McDormand – Nomadland\n\nSupporting Actor: Daniel Kaluuya – Judas and the Black Messiah\n\nSupporting Actress: Youn Yuh-jung – Minari\n\nOriginal Screenplay: Promising Young Woman – Emerald Fennel\n\nAdapted Screenplay: The Father – Christopher Hampton and Florian Zeller\n\nAnimated Feature Film: Soul\n\nInternational Feature Film: Another Round (Denmark)\n\nOriginal Score: Soul – Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross, and Jon Batiste\n\nOriginal Song: ‘Fight for You’ (performed by H.E.R.) from Judas and the Black Messiah\n\nFor the complete list of nominees and winners, visit oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2021.\n\nSpotlight\n\nNomadland\n\nCast: Frances McDormand, David Strathairn, Bob Wells, Linda May, Swankie\n\nDirector: Chloé Zhao\n\nDrama; after losing her job and the death of her husband, a woman (McDormand) decides to leave her hometown and travel around the country as a van dwelling nomad.\n\nBased on Jessica Bruder’s 2017 non-fiction book Nomadland: Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century.\n\nHad a budget of $5 million; has grossed an estimated $6.5 million.\n\nHas been lauded by critics as one of the best films of 2020.\n\nReal-life nomads, including Bob Wells, Linda May, and Swankie, play fictionalized versions of themselves in the film.\n\nScore composed by Ludovico Einaudi."
