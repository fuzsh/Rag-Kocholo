        "text": "As the coronavirus pandemic continues to rage and new variants pop up, the rich and famous aren’t staying quiet about their diagnoses. Instead, celebrities are speaking out on social media not only to keep fans informed but, in some cases, to urge followers to stay home in order to help reduce the risk of transmission.\n\nBold-faced names from professional athletes (Kevin Durant) to politicians (Miami’s Mayor Francis Suarez) to big- and small-screen stars (Daniel Dae Kim) and even royals (Prince Albert II) are among those who have opened up about testing positive for COVID-19. Musicians have been no different, sharing tales of their symptoms and quarantine.\n\nHere are the artists who have opened up about having the coronavirus.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nBrandi Carlile\n\nBrandi Carlile revealed April 27, 2022, that COVID-19 “finally got me” and that she had to cancel her planned set at Stagecoach.

Argh, it’s horrible. I’m a few days in and I have a chest infection, but I think I turned a corner today and I’m starting to feel a little better. I just wanted to let everybody know that I’m devastated to be missing you and I hope you have a wonderful time out there with all my friends. See you on the other side of this trash.”\n\nMiley Cyrus\n\nMiley Cyrus revealed April 1, 2022, on Twitter that she has COVID-19, but she has no regrets: “It was definitely worth it.” The pop star has been touring Latin America for the past week, with a concert in Bogota, Colombia, and a performance at Lollapalooza Brazil in Sao Paolo. “Traveling around the world, playin for 100,000 people a night & meeting hundreds of fans a day, the chances of getting Covid are pretty high,” Cyrus tweeted. “I have Covid now but it was definitely worth it.”\n\nPatti Lupone\n\nThe star of stage and screen announced via Twitter Feb. 27, 2022, that she had contracted the virus, and would have to sit out of several shows of Broadway production Company.

He noted that while his first bout was fairly mild, this time, COVID-19’s “got the better of me.”\n\nJazmine Sullivan\n\nThe singer-songwriter announced on Feb. 24, 2022, that she was canceling at least one show of her Heaux Tales tour after coming down with COVID-19. “My doctor confirmed today that I’m positive with COVID,” she shared on social media, a day after canceling a show because she wasn’t feeling well. “I am taking every precaution to isolate myself.

My sinuses, my head… I’ve never had this experience before. … I woke up the next day and I had to take a COVID test for something and I took a COVID test and I had Omicron, which is why I was in such a fog.”\n\nBez\n\nThe Happy Mondays drummer confirmed to U.K. paper The Daily Star on Jan. 17, 2022, that he tested positive for COVID-19 for a second time. The news came just one day after the British percussionist made his debut appearance on the U.K. reality series Dancing on Ice. “I’m gutted because I’m going to be missing training but I’m looking forward to skating on the show again for Week Three and I’ll be tuning at home and cheering on my mates who are skating this weekend,” he told the publication.\n\nRoberta Flack\n\nThe R&B legend revealed in a statement Jan. 13, 2022, that she, too, experienced a breakthrough case. “The vaccines and booster worked and protected me from severe illness or hospitalization,” she shared. “Instead, I was ill with fatigue, fever, and slight congestion. I stayed home to rest and recover. Today I feel much better. I am at home and isolating until I retest and receive a negative test this week. I can testify: Vaccines and boosters work. If you are not vaccinated, please do so. They likely saved my life.”\n\nJason Isbell\n\nThe country artist revealed Jan. 11, 2022, that he has experienced a breakthrough case of COVID-19. “Lotta sinus drainage type stuff, scratchy in my throat and some muscle aches but no cough or breathing issues fyi,” he told fans. “Boosted and very grateful for it.”\n\nJohn Mayer\n\nThe singer-songwriter, who has been playing with Grateful Dead spinoff Dead & Co., tested positive for the virus, the band announced on Jan. 5. “Today, just prior to leaving for Mexico, per his physician, @JohnMayer tested positive for COVID-19 and will be unable to perform,” the group tweeted.\n\nAnthony Callea\n\nThe Australian Idol alum shared on Jan. 5 that he had contracted COVID-19, telling fans on social media that he had woken to “excruciating pain” days earlier.“My head felt like it was about to combust, my throat, well I have never felt pain in my throat like that before, it was like someone stabbing me right in the throat,” he explained in his post. “My chest was tight, I felt as though I was about to burst my ear drums and my body overall just felt like it was shutting down.”\n\nLL Cool J\n\nThe rapper was originally scheduled to perform at Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve With Ryan Seacrest 2022, but announced that he’d be pulling out of the show on Wednesday (Dec. 29) after learning he tested positive for COVID-19.\n\n“I know it’s disappointing to the millions of fans but my test came back positive for COVID, which means I’ll no longer be able to perform as scheduled at NYRE,” LL Cool J said in a statement to Billboard. “We were ready and I was really looking forward to ringing in 2022 in my hometown in a special way, but for now I wish everyone a healthy and happy New Year.

I’m so glad I’m vaccinated.”\n\nHugh Jackman\n\nJackman, current star of Broadway’s revival of The Music Man, revealed he tested positive for COVID-19 in an Instagram video. “I just wanted you to hear from me that I tested positive this morning for Covid,” he said. “My symptoms are like a cold: I have a scratchy throat and a bit of a runny nose, but I’m fine. And I’m just going to do everything I can to get better, A.S.A.P., and as soon as I’m cleared, I’ll be back onstage.”\n\nFollowing Jackman’s post, The Music Man‘s official Instagram account told fans that shows will resume on Jan. 2, with Jackman’s return scheduled for Jan. 6.\n\nBrian May\n\nThe Queen guitarist shared on Dec. 18, 2021, that after attending a birthday party recently, he had tested positive for COVID-19. “The shocking day finally came for me.

It was terrible. I still have side effects. I was sick for two months almost,” she explained to the shock jock. “I want it to be clear that it is because of the vaccine I’m fine. I think if I weren’t vaccinated, I would have died, because it was bad … When I say it was bad, I more just mean that it felt horrible.\n\nDoja Cat\n\nAfter pulling out of two Jingle Ball tour dates due to crew members testing positive, the star shared on Dec. 12 that she, too, had tested positive. “While my spirits are down since I can’t be there to celebrate the holiday with my fans in Philly, DC, Atlanta and Miami, I’m doing ok and look forward to recovering and getting back out there as soon as I can!” she told fans on social media.\n\nBryan Adams\n\nThe singer was hospitalized in Italy in November after contracting COVID for a second time. “Here I am, just arrived in Milano, and I’ve tested positive for the second time in a month for Covid,” he wrote on Instagram, posted from Milan Malpensa airport. “So it’s off to the hospital for me.”\n\nEd Sheeran\n\nOn Oct. 24, a week ahead of his new album’s arrival, the singer-songwriter revealed that he had tested positive. “I’m now unable to plough ahead with any in person commitments for now, so I’ll be doing as many of my planned interviews/performances I can from my house,” he shared.
