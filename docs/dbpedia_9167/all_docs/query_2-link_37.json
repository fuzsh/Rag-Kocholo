        "text": "IMHO the best names work on more than one level. For example, the Fountains of Wayne. There actually was a garden shop in Wayne, NJ whose sign said \"Fountains of Wayne.\" And since it is also the hometown of the band, they are the \"fountains\" of that town. Great name. Can you find a common connection for your band?\n\nThey're one of my favorite bands...such witty and carefully crafted music. Yeah, they were named after a lawn ornament shop (I was thinking hardware store until I looked it up on Wikipedia) located at the intersection of U.S. Route 46 and New Jersey Route 23, in Wayne, NJ, Adam Schlesinger's hometown.\n\nComing up with a band name can be very hard, but then again look at some of the band names from popular bands in the 60's and 70's (and even now)...there were some pretty bad names but yet really good bands. Sometimes the band name really doesn't matter if you're just really good; I'm glad we have a pretty decent name\n\nOh, I like the name Phil 'n the Blanks.\n\nA long time Columbus 50's/60's Oldies act is called \"Phil Dirt and the Dozers\".\n\nAnother favorite of mine is the Detroit Blues band (St. Claire Shores actually) \"Phil The Void\".\n\nThe band I joined 4 years ago is The Terra City Blues Band. It's been that for about 15 years but if it were up to me, the name would be retired.\n\nI was in a corparate function type band in the 80's called The Corporate Guise.Another was called The Dalmingoes,our logo and prop was a pink flamingo painted like a dalmation.I also came up with some genre/band names like white trash psyco billy band,Feral and the cats.Gothic Emo band, Vlad and the Impalers.Jewish blues Band, Howlin' Moishe and the brisbreakers.A couple of cover bands that used to play the atlanta area that I liked,Mr Resistor and the incapacitators,Book'em and risk it\n\nI like this name of an old boston garage band. The Dogmatics\n\nLove this song by said Dogmatics\n\nArch...Did you ever hear of a Boston garage band called The Turbines? I have their album. They looked cool, played Gretsch guitars, vintage Slingerland drums, etc. Worst vocals I ever heard in my entire life. Nobody in the band could sing at all. Horrendous.\n\nhaha....Never heard of them....dont get me started on bad singers......I have resolved never to play aging with someone who cant sing.....well if I can help it anyway.\n\nThe last band I was in was a country rock band called Cranky Yankee. I liked the name because I thought people would remember it. My wife hated it. Anytime anyone would ask the name, they would say that it was catchy, which my wife said was polite way of saying that hey hated it also.\n\nI typed this in yesterday,but it didn't come up,so here goes again......\n\nI came up with:\n\nSuperBad and the K-Tels!\n\nAfter those old K-Tel commercials...........\n\n\"You must get...SuperBad! 12 of the BADDEST funky/soul hits ever!\"\n\nI heard of a band called male body part The Menace............thought that was a good one...........\n\nHere was a list of names I came up with when our band was thinking of changing its name.\n\nWe never changed it\n\n-Kip\n\n4 close\n\n5 cents\n\n8 ball\n\nAbin Sur\n\nAdvarks and anthills\n\nAlpha bravo\n\nArthur eyes\n\nAuthorize\n\nBlackball\n\nBleed\n\nBotchi\n\nBusway\n\nCellar steps\n\nCharlie company\n\nChutes\n\nColonel Ungus\n\nCommand D\n\nCrisscross\n\nCrosstalk\n\nCrosstown\n\nDash\n\nDish\n\nDrop\n\nDropper\n\nEBO\n\nEnuff z enuff\n\nEuthanasia\n\nExtra sauce\n\nFive sense\n\nFlashcard\n\nFore\n\nForthought\n\nFourth world\n\nfrantic\n\nfrantix\n\nFree zone\n\nFren z\n\nFrenzy\n\nFrogger\n\nGamora\n\nGodet\n\nGone\n\nHardwood\n\nHedge\n\nHedgefund\n\nHi ball\n\nHighbacks\n\nHogtied\n\nIs it all\n\nIscream\n\nJefferson Thomas\n\nJust a dash\n\nJust a pinch\n\nKamandi\n\nKing pin\n\nKnockdrop\n\nKraken\n\nLandstar\n\nLenders and borrowers\n\nLeon\n\nLittle darlings\n\nLongnecks\n\nLongshot\n\nLuftgittare\n\nMiss ellie\n\nModem\n\nModus operandi\n\nMoist\n\nMondo condo\n\nMoney hungry\n\nMoodle\n\nMost\n\nMothmen\n\nMushrooms in the dark\n\nNeon\n\nNewman\n\nNin\n\nNixons\n\nnon sequitor\n\nNonsense\n\nNuisance bar\n\nOgre\n\nOzone\n\nPheno\n\nPhren z\n\nPieces\n\nPinch\n\nPip the troll\n\nPipe organ\n\nPocketpol\n\nPong\n\nPosse come and got us\n\nPushback\n\nQ\n\nRain parade\n\nRbi\n\nRTFM ( as a computer guy, this is always one of my favs!)\n\nScammin nannies\n\nSense c\n\nSeven sense\n\nShatter star\n\nShoots\n\nShoots and ladders\n\nSidewalk and snakes\n\nSimmer\n\nSlipstream\n\nSnipe\n\nSnipe hunt\n\nSnuff\n\nSolstice\n\nSt john\n\nStarcross\n\nStatic\n\nSureshot\n\nThe all ins\n\nThe angries\n\nThe authority\n\nThe bank\n\nThe big top\n\nThe darlenes\n\nThe Dollar Generals\n\nThe drop\n\nThe droppers\n\nThe dung beetles\n\nthe frantic francis\n\nthe frantics\n\nThe hedge\n\nThe herbs\n\nThe mood\n\nThe moodies\n\nThe nannies\n\nThe pansies\n\nThe side steps\n\nThe slipkids\n\nThe snipe hunters\n\nThe tire pyres\n\nThe ya yas\n\nToadload\n\nTrends\n\nU tant\n\nU than aja\n\nU thant\n\nUnhinged\n\nWaiting for the bus\n\nWiseguy\n\nXS\n\nExcess\n\nX treme\n\nYouth in Asia (as in Euthanasia)\n\nZ"
