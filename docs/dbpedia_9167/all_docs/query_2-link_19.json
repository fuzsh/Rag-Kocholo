        "text": "Adam Schlesinger, a singer-songwriter for the bands Fountains of Wayne and Ivy, has died aged 52.\n\nHe was also an award-winning writer of songs for film, theatre and television.\n\nHis lawyer, Josh Grier, said that Adam passed away on Wednesday from complications brought on by coronavirus.\n\nAdam's critically acclaimed band Fountains of Wayne, in which he played bass while Chris Collingwood played guitar and sang vocals, rose to fame with 2003 hit, Stacy's Mom.\n\nThe track about a teenage boy who was infatuated with his friend's mum, reached number 21 on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart and featured supermodel Rachel Hunter in the video.\n\nFountains of Wayne were named after garden ornament store in Wayne, New Jersey, which was near Adam's hometown of Montclair, when the band was started in 1995.\n\nThe band's style was compared to that of 70s groups The Cars and Big Star as well as a nod to 60s icons, The Kinks.\n\nThe group was based in northern New Jersey and the suburbs of New York City and they sang about the lives of suburban people.\n\nAdam found fame as a songwriter for films, gaining recognition with the theme song for Tom Hanks directed movie 'That Thing You Do!' in 1996.\n\nAdam received nominations for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for his efforts.\n\nThere was also recognition with the Emmys as Adam won three awards for his songs that featured in 2010s TV show 'Crazy Ex-Girlfriend'.\n\nThere was also joy in the theatres as Adam joined forces with David Javerbaum to write songs for the 2008 Broadway musical 'Cry-Baby'.\n\nThis brought a Tony nomination for best original score.\n\nMost recently, Adam has been working with comedian Sarah Silverman on a Broadway stage adaptation of her memoir, The Bedwetter.\n\nThe show was due to start its run this month but it has been postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic."
