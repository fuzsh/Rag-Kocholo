It’s been an extremely scary week,\" she said.\n\nFans of the iconic musical talent flocked to his latest Instagram post to send their condolences to his family.\n\n\"Horrible news today. We'll miss Adam Schlesinger deeply - his was a rare and prolific talent. RIP,\" one fan wrote.\n\n\"Another said: \"You are a songwriting legend. Rest In Peace, Adam.\"\n\n\"I am speechless and heartbroken. A note to his family/loved ones: if you need ANYTHING, and I mean ANYTHING. Please reach out. We are here for you,\" a third promised.\n\nA fourth sent a farewell to the legend: \"RIP Adam Schlesinger. You'll meet Stacy's mom in heaven.\"\n\nHe is survived by his two daughters, Sadie and Claire."
