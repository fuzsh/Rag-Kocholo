        "text": "Tributes have quickly begun pouring in for Adam Schlesinger, the Fountains of Wayne founding member and Emmy and Grammy-winning songwriter who died Wednesday of complications of coronavirus. He was 52.\n\nTom Hanks, who worked with Schlesinger on the 1996 film That Thing You Do! (Schlesinger wrote the film’s title track and was nominated for a best-original-song Oscar)—and is recovering from COVID-19 himself—tweeted that he was “terribly sad” about the loss.\n\n“There would be no Playtone without Adam Schlesinger,” Hanks wrote—a reference to his production company, named after the fake record company in the film—“without his ‘That Thing You Do!’ He was a One-der. Lost him to Covid-19. Terribly sad today. Hanx.”\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nRachel Bloom, the creator of Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, wrote that she was “at a complete loss for words.”\n\n“I have so much to say about Adam Schlesinger that I am at a complete loss for words,” she tweeted. “He is irreplaceable.”\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nSchlesinger was an executive music producer for Crazy Ex, cowriting dozens of songs for the musical CW series. He won an Emmy in 2019 for best original music and lyrics for the song “Anti-Depressants Are So Not a Big Deal,” an award he shared with Bloom and Jack Dolgen. As part of her tribute, Bloom also shared a short video of Schlesinger and Dolgen working on the song “I Go to the Zoo.”\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nDolgen shared a tribute as well, posting a photo of the mini 3 Musketeers that Schlesinger left on his piano “as a treat during the taping of the Crazy Ex-Girlfriend concert special. Remembering, missing and loving Adam Schlesinger tonight and always.”\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nAline Brosh McKenna, the cocreator of Crazy Ex, penned a lengthy tribute to Schlesinger, which she posted on Twitter. She recalled that he used to laugh at the word “egobituary,” a term McKenna coined to describe the self-absorbed posts and stories people share online when talking about a celebrity who just died. “I truly think that was his favorite thing I ever said to him in the 25 years I knew him,” McKenna wrote, remembering him as “so funny, so kind, so opinionated, so clever, so passionate.”\n\n“I love that guy. I love all the memories. I’m making this too much about me, because that’s what an egobituary is,” she continued. “I’m devastated for his family, his kids, for Alexis, for Steven, for his CXG family, for the many, many, many who loved him.”\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nShe also shared a demo Schlesinger made for the song “What’ll It Be?”, a song the Crazy Ex team found “tough to crack.”\n\n“Suddenly, without much preamble, he sent in a demo,” she recalled. “Rachel and I stood in her office and listened to it and looked at each other, astonished, because it was perfect.”\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nBloom quote-tweeted the demo with a simple message: “He was a genius.”\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair\n\n— Cover Story: How Reese Witherspoon Turned Her Literary Obsession Into an Empire\n\n— The Best Movies and Shows on Netflix to Watch While Stuck at Home\n\n— A First Look at Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story\n\n— An Exclusive Excerpt From Natalie Wood, Suzanne Finstad’s Biography—With New Details About Wood’s Mysterious Death\n\n— Tiger King Is Your Next True-Crime TV Obsession\n\n— The Best Shows to Stream If You’re in Quarantine\n\n— From the Archive: A Friendship With Greta Garbo and Its Many Pleasures"
