        "text": "NEW YORK — Adapted from a lesser movie by John Waters, the laborious musical \"Cry-Baby\" that opened Thursday at Broadway's Marquis Theatre works hard at trying to entertain, never relaxing for a moment as it tells a familiar story: the romance between a good girl and a bad boy, set against the backdrop of 1950s social mores and mortality. Yet, we've been here before, most famously with \"Grease.\"\n\nThe book for \"Cry-Baby\" is by Mark O'Donnell and Thomas Meehan, the guys who adapted Waters' better film \"Hairspray\" for the theater. They manage to pepper Waters' raunchy, admittedly chaotic story with a continuous parade of one-liners and wisecracks that often are funny but reinforce the comic-strip nature of the script. And the writers wrap up the story in the most convoluted manner possible, which makes director Mark Brokaw work even harder as he struggles to straighten out various plot points.\n\nIn the film, Johnny Depp brought a threat of sexual menace to the title character, while Amy Locane had a Sandra Dee winsomeness. Their Broadway counterparts, James Snyder and Elizabeth Stanley, are not only bland, but also look as if they are ready for their 10th-year high school reunion.\n\nCry-Baby is the leader of the blue-collar, juvenile delinquent Drapes in 1954 Baltimore (Waters' hometown) and Allison (Stanley's role) is a charter member of the Squares, the upper-crust kids who go to country-club dances and, in the words of one of the evening's better songs, are \"squeaky clean.\"\n\nWaters' movie was a musical, too, but none of those songs are onstage at the Marquis. Instead, David Javerbaum and Adam Schlesinger have supplied a new score that features jam-packed, often witty lyrics tied to '50s-style pop melodies that frequently float away as soon as they are heard.\n\nWhat lifts many of the songs is the pulsing, often erotically charged choreography by Rob Ashford. He's the real star of the evening, keeping it moving when plot and song falter. And Ashford has assembled a terrific hip-swiveling, pelvis-grinding collection of dancers who seem to have cornered the market on perpetual motion.\n\nThe supporting cast mostly emotes in the key of unsubtle. Best of the lot is Harriet Harris, as Allison's straight-laced, class-conscious grandmother, looking like Mamie Eisenhower incarnate. Unfortunately, her big musical number, overstuffed with plot exposition, disappoints.\n\nIt's not easy playing a villain in which the deck is stacked against him, but Christopher J. Hanke manages to earn some genuine laughs as Allison's beau and leader of the dorks.\n\nWhat: \"Cry-Baby: The Musical\" Starring: James Snyder, Elizabeth Stanley Directed by: Mark Brokaw Where: Marquis Theatre, 1535 Broadway at West 45th Street, New York City When: 8 p.m. Mon.-Sat., 2 p.m. Wed. and Sat.
