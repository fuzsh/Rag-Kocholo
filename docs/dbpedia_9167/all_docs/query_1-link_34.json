At 8:30 p.m., Wellmont Theater, 5 Seymour Street, Montclair, N.J., (877) 935-5668, wellmonttheatre.com; sold out. (Amanda Petrusich)\n\n★ ANTONY AND THE JOHNSONS (Friday) In 2005 Antony Hegarty released “I Am a Bird Now” (Secretly Canadian), his second full-length album; the single “Hope There’s Someone,” a stark, breath-catching lamentation on death and the afterlife, gorgeously bellowed over rich, pulsating piano, earned Mr. Hegarty instant (and copious) accolades. He unveiled a new album, “The Crying Light” (Secretly Canadian), last month. At 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100, ticketmaster.com; sold out.\n\n(Petrusich)\n\nBROADWAY BY THE YEAR: 1924 (Monday) The theater critic and author Scott Siegel curates this compelling series for Town Hall, which celebrates — through narration, written by Mr. Siegel, and songs, performed by a cast of cabaret and Broadway veterans — a specific year in Broadway history. This installment will feature cuts from “The Student Prince,” “Lady, Be Good,” “Rose-Marie,” “Charlot’s Revue,” “Music Box Revue” and more. At 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100, ticketmaster.com; $45 to $55. (Petrusich)\n\nGEORGE CLINTON AND THE P-FUNK ALL-STARS (Thursday) George Clinton’s long-running band has become an American institution, using funk to subvert and outflank any puritan reflexes. As P-Funk’s leisurely jams amble from bubbling-mud funk to slow-grinding blues-rock to bits of doo-wop, jazz and hip-hop, the music is tight and loose at the same time. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $37.50 in advance, $42 at the door. (Jon Pareles)\n\nTIM FITE (Friday) Mr. Fite, from Brooklyn, dabbles in classic acoustic folk and hip-hop — still an unlikely pairing, although increasingly less so — and his scrappy, defiantly lo-fi songs are difficult to classify. At 8 p.m., Bell House, 149 Seventh Street, Gowanus, Brooklyn, (718) 643-6510, thebellhouseny.com; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Petrusich)\n\nFOUNTAINS OF WAYNE (Wednesday and Thursday) Chris Collingwood and Adam Schlesinger of Fountains of Wayne earned their seats in the songwriting pantheon with power-pop classicism and songs that celebrate beta males and bridge-and-tunnel quotidiana (and, in the case of their 2003 hit “Stacy’s Mom,” teenage fantasies of older women). These two shows will be acoustic performances. At 9:30 p.m., Joe’s Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; sold out. (Ben Sisario)\n\nFRENCH KICKS (Saturday) New wave gets a twisted revival in the songs of the French Kicks. Bouncing along on keyboards one moment, facing guitar barbs the next, the songs are as unstable as the romances they sketch. At 8 p.m., Bell House, 149 Seventh Street, Gowanus, Brooklyn, (718) 643-6510, thebellhouseny.com; $12. (Sisario)\n\nEMMYLOU HARRIS, PATTY GRIFFIN, SHAWN COLVIN, BUDDY MILLER (Friday) On this tour, titled “Three Girls and Their Buddy,” these folksy singer-songwriters perform together, which is not an entirely new phenomenon; dedicated fans might be prompted to compile a chart of some sort, mapping all of the overlap between their careers (Mr. Miller has produced Ms. Colvin; Ms. Harris has appeared on Ms. Griffin’s last two albums; Ms. Harris, Ms. Griffin and Mr. Miller have toured as a trio, etc.). At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-4111, beacontheatrenyc.com; sold out. (Petrusich)\n\n★ HELOISE & THE SAVOIR FAIRE (Friday) This electro-funk band from Brooklyn is anchored by the elastic vocals of its shimmying frontwoman, Heloise Williams; appropriately, Blondie’s Debbie Harry proffered guest vocals for the band’s lashing 2008 debut, “Trash, Rats and Microphones” (Simian). At 7 p.m., Seaport Ice, South Street Seaport, Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 661-6640, seaportmusicfestival.com; free (skating is $5, skate rental is $7; skating is not required for admission).\n\n(Petrusich)\n\nJIMMY EAT WORLD (Monday) In 2001 Jimmy Eat World was at the forefront of emo, a new and unfortunately dubbed movement in punk-rock that focused on confessional lyrics and fraught guitars. Eight years later the group is hardly emblematic of the genre (which has expanded to include guyliner and skinny jeans) but still commands legions of uberdedicated fans, who holler along to every word. With Reubens Accomplice. At 8 p.m., Terminal 5, 610 West 56th Street, Clinton, (212) 582-6600, terminal5nyc.com; sold out. (Petrusich)\n\nTOM JONES (Tuesday) The Welsh singer Tom Jones is as divisive a figure as any: some are drawn to his gold chains, exposed chest hair, booming vocals and singalong choruses (“It’s Not Unusual,” “She’s a Lady”), while others are moderately repulsed. At 8:30 p.m., Terminal 5, 610 West 56th Street, Clinton, (212) 582-6600, terminal5nyc.com; $50. (Petrusich)\n\nB. B. KING (Saturday) Mr. King is at his most comfortable with his trusted electric guitar, Lucille, tucked casually under one arm; he is the sort for whom guitar playing is as natural as heaving air in and out of his lungs. Now 83, Mr. King is as vibrant as ever, spinning golden, meandering blues songs that incite ecstasy and devastation in equal parts. With his much-revered fellow blues guitarist Buddy Guy. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-4111, beacontheatrenyc.com; sold out. (Petrusich)\n\n★ BEN KWELLER, WATSON TWINS (Wednesday) On his newest album, “Changing Horses” (ATO) — a rollicking country record in the spirit of Gram Parsons and Waylon Jennings — the indie-pop singer and songwriter Ben Kweller revisits his Texas roots (he recently returned to his home state after logging nine years in Brooklyn). After collaborating with Jenny Lewis of Rilo Kiley on her 2006 solo debut, “Rabbit Fur Coat” (Team Love), the Watson Twins (from Los Angeles by way of Louisville, Ky.) released their debut long-player, “Fire Songs” (Vanguard), a collection of sweet, languid folk-rock tracks. At 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824, the-townhall-nyc.org; $26.\n\n(Petrusich)\n\nLABELLE (Thursday) The 1974 album “Nightbirds,” produced by Allen Toussaint, crystallized Labelle’s raucous disco-funk, which included suggestive lyrics, exquisitely sequined costumes and brash, hair-raising vocals (see especially the hit single “Lady Marmalade”). The group eventually disbanded (Patti LaBelle went on to pursue a successful solo career) and then reunited; last year the trio released “Back to Now” (Verve), its first new record in 30 years. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-4111, beacontheatrenyc.com; $59.50 to $104.50. (Petrusich)\n\nMATISYAHU (Sunday) The colossally bearded M.C. Matisyahu is known not only for his religion — he practices Hasidic Judaism, a lifestyle not particularly common within the hip-hop and reggae communities — but also for his trembly, almost psychedelic flow, influenced as much by contemporary rap as it is by classic reggae and dub. At 7:30 p.m., Bell House, 149 Seventh Street, Gowanus, Brooklyn, (718) 643-6510, thebellhouseny.com; sold out. (Petrusich)\n\nJESSE MCCARTNEY (Thursday) The actor and singer Jesse McCartney recently released his third album, “Departure” (Hollywood), which, conveniently, marks a departure from his pop beginnings and a move toward a more urban, dance-oriented sound. The packs of panting, shrieking teens crowding his shows appear to agree with the new direction. With Anjulie. At 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-1000, nokiatheatrenyc.com; sold out. (Petrusich)\n\nNEVILLE BROTHERS (Friday) These New Orleans musicians have been playing a loose mix of jazz, soul, Bayou funk and R&B since the late 1970s, and while their work can be surprisingly moody, it still neatly embodies their hometown’s (unofficial) credo: Laissez les bon temps roulez. With Dr. John, the renowned New Orleans pianist, and his backing band, the Lower 911. At 8 p.m., Terminal 5, 610 West 56th Street, Clinton, (212) 582-6600, terminal5nyc.com; $37.50 in advance, $42.50 at the door. (Petrusich)\n\n★ NE-YO, JAZMINE SULLIVAN (Friday and Sunday) The R&B singer and songwriter Ne-Yo’s third album, “Year of the Gentleman” (Def Jam), was one of 2008’s finest pieces of confessional writing; its title was inspired by the effortless class of the Rat Pack, but Ne-Yo is sweeter and less aggressively macho than his heroes. Jazmine Sullivan, a soul singer from Philadelphia, came up under the tutelage of the rapper and producer Missy Elliott, but her debut album, “Fearless” (J Records), is more reminiscent of Lauryn Hill. With Musiq Soulchild. Friday at 8 p.m., Sunday at 7 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-1000, radiocity.com; $39.50 to $79.50. (Petrusich)\n\nODETTA: VOICE OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT (Tuesday) The blues and folk singer Odetta, who died in December, has been honored both for her voice — thunderous, heady, opulent — and for her remarkable work within the civil rights movement. This memorial will feature live performances, readings and video (all intended to revisit and celebrate Odetta’s life and career), and an impressive list of writers and musicians has signed on, including David Amram, Maya Angelou, Harry Belafonte, Oscar Brand, Tom Chapin, Guy Davis, Ruby Dee, Steve Earle, Wavy Gravy, Geoffrey Holder, the Holmes Brothers, Maria Muldaur, Pete Seeger, Sweet Honey in the Rock, Josh White Jr. and Peter Yarrow. At 7 p.m., Riverside Church, Riverside Drive at 122st Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 870-6700, theriversidechurchny.org; free. (Petrusich)\n\nTHIEVERY CORPORATION (Wednesday and Thursday) This D.J. duo from Washington is stubbornly unclassifiable, drawing on disparate and often unpredictable sources: acid jazz, global beats (Brazilian bossa nova, Indian ragas) and late-1990s electronica. With Nickodemus. At 9 p.m., Terminal 5, 610 West 56th Street, Clinton, (212) 582-6600, terminal5nyc.com; $45. (Petrusich)\n\nTOAD THE WET SPROCKET (Thursday) To pop music historians, the ’00s seem destined to be recalled — fondly or not — as the decade of the reunion tour. After enjoying a string of sprightly radio successes in the 1990s (“Fall Down,” “All I Want,” “Walk on the Ocean”), the folk-rock quartet Toad the Wet Sprocket disbanded, reformed, re-disbanded and re-reformed. Since the band has no new record to promote, expect spirited renditions of past hits — which have aged surprisingly well. With Heyday. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $30. (Petrusich)\n\nTOKYO POLICE CLUB (Wednesday) On its much anticipated debut album, “Elephant Shell” (Arts & Crafts), this Toronto-area quartet manages to do what a lot of the current wave of Canadian indie bands can’t: master moody atmospherics while still packing a taut rock ’n’ roll punch. With Born Ruffians and Harlem Shakes. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sisario)"
