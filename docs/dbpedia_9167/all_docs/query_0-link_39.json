        "text": "Update (March 31, 1:17 p.m.): Adam Schlesinger’s family has released a statement saying the musician’s condition is “improving.”\n\n“Thank you for the outpouring of love for Adam and his family,” the statement reads, per Billboard. “Adam has been hospitalized with COVID-19. He’s on a ventilator and has been sedated to facilitate his recovery. He is receiving excellent care, his condition is improving and we are cautiously optimistic. His family appreciates all of the love and support.”\n\nIn addition, Rachel Bloom, the co-creator of Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, tweeted a request for her followers to “please keep Adam in your thoughts and prayers. It’s been an extremely scary week.”\n\nThe original post continues below:\n\nAdam Schlesinger, the co-frontman of band Fountains of Wayne, has been put on a ventilator after contracting coronavirus. The Oscar–nominated singer-songwriter is receiving treatment at a hospital in upstate New York, his attorney Josh Grier told Variety, while dismissing initial reports that Schlesinger is in a coma.\n\n“He’s very sick and is heavily sedated, as are all people on ventilators, but no one has used the word ‘coma’ to me,” Grier said. He added that the singer-songwriter has been in the hospital for over a week and has been receiving exceptional medical care, Variety noted.\n\nSchlesinger is a prolific, award-winning performer, having been nominated for two Grammys with his band Fountains of Wayne, and later winning one for his work on the comedy album A Colbert Christmas: The Greatest Gift Of All! He’s also won three Emmys. Two were for outstanding music and lyrics for songs performed at the 65th and 66th Tony Awards; the other was for outstanding original music and lyrics for the song “Antidepressants Are So Not a Big Deal” on the musical series Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. Schlesinger wrote numerous songs for the series and served as its executive music producer.\n\nHe was nominated for a best-original-song Oscar in 1997 for penning the titular track for That Thing You Do!, the musical movie written and directed by Tom Hanks. Schlesinger is also an EGOT nominee, having been nominated for a best-original-score Tony and best musical in 2008 for his work on Cry-Baby.\n\nTo many, however, Schlesinger is perhaps best known as the co-frontman of Fountains of Wayne, the pop-rock band he cofounded in 1995. The band’s most famous song was “Stacy’s Mom,” a cheeky ode to the ’80s. Schlesinger also founded the bands Ivy and Tinted Window.\n\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair\n\n— Cover Story: How Reese Witherspoon Turned Her Literary Obsession Into an Empire\n\n— The Best Movies and Shows on Netflix to Watch While Stuck at Home\n\n— A First Look at Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story\n\n— An Exclusive Excerpt From Natalie Wood, Suzanne Finstad’s Biography—With New Details About Wood’s Mysterious Death\n\n— Tiger King Is Your Next True-Crime TV Obsession\n\n— The Best Shows to Stream If You’re in Quarantine\n\n— From the Archive: A Friendship With Greta Garbo and Its Many Pleasures\n\nLooking for more?
