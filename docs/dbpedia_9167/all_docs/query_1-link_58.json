He joined initially as the program’s recruiting coordinator, but was moved into an assistant coaching role in October 2021.\n\nMontgomery, a four-year starter at Michigan State under the legendary Jud Heathcote, was an assistant coach under Tom Izzo for 10 seasons.\n\nHe came back to Michigan State after spending the second half of the 2020-21 season on the staff at the University of Detroit.\n\nIn his two years back at MSU, the Spartans have reached the NCAA Tournament twice, including an appearance in the Sweet 16 during the 2023 postseason. He has also mentored four players who have earned All-Big Ten honors, including Tyson Walker, an All-Big Ten Second Team selection in 2022-23.\n\nIn 2023-24, the coaching staff welcomes in a recruiting class that was ranked No. 5 in the country by 247 Sports and includes one 5-star recruit and three 4-stars.\n\nMontgomery was head coach at Northern Illinois for 10 seasons (2011-20) and took the program to new heights, leading the team to both a postseason appearance and a victory over a ranked opponent. His 124 wins were the third-most in school history and his 21-win campaign in 2015-16 was tied for the second-most victories in school history. He led the team to a share of the MAC West Division crown in 2019-20 and under his watch, his student-athletes accumulated three NABC All-District honors, six All-MAC honors and four MAC All-Freshman Team recognitions and one Lou Henson All-America Team selection.\n\nDuring his 10 seasons on Izzo's staff at MSU (2001-11), the Spartans made 10-straight trips to the NCAA Tournament and three Final Four appearances. He coached 26 All-Big Ten players and six NBA Draft picks.\n\nMontgomery started his coaching career at Central Michigan in 1997-98. Following a 6-23 season in 1999-2000, the Chippewas made a worst-to-first turnaround the following season as they finished the 2000-01 campaign with a 20-8 record, winning the MAC with a conference mark of 14-4.\n\nAn All-Big Ten Third Team selection under Heathcote as a senior in 1992, Montgomery ended his career as the all-time leader in games played (125), was part of the 1990 Big Ten Championship team, three NCAA Tournament teams and an NIT Final Four team. Montgomery ranks sixth on the career assists chart (561) after leading the team in assists as a junior (169) and senior (190). He also ranks fourth on the MSU career steals list (168).\n\nA two-time Academic All-Big Ten honoree, he earned his bachelor’s degree in food industry management from Michigan State in 1992.\n\nFollowing his graduation, Montgomery played professionally for four years in Germany, Lithuania and Sweden.\n\nA native of Inkster, Mich., Montgomery starred in the prep ranks at Aquinas High School.\n\nMontgomery and his wife, Alexandra, have two sons, Mason and Nicholas, and a daughter, Charlotte Ann."
