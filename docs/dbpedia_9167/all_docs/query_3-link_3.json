        "text": "Adam Schlesinger, the Emmy-winning songwriter behind Crazy Ex-Girlfriend and a slew of Grammy, Tony, and Oscar-nominated songs, and a founding member of Fountains of Wayne, has died of complications of coronavirus at the age of 52.\n\nSchlesinger was perhaps best known for his longtime role as songwriter and bassist in the band Fountains of Wayne, which scored a Top 40 hit and Grammy nomination with their memorable 2003 single, “Stacy’s Mom.” He also performed and wrote songs with the cult-favorite band Ivy.\n\nAdam Lyons Schlesinger was born in October 1967 and grew up in Montclair, New Jersey. As a freshman at Williams College, he met Chris Collingwood, and the two played in various bands before splitting up after graduation when Schlesinger moved to New York City. In 1991, he responded to a newspaper ad that singer and guitarist Andy Chase placed looking for a songwriting partner. Eventually they met Dominique Durand, and the trio bonded over their love for British indie-pop, which led them to the sound that Ivy became known for. Over the years, they released 6 albums and lent their songs to countless movie soundtracks.\n\nAfter hearing about a film about a band in the 1960s through his publisher Polygram, Schlesinger wrote the song which later gave That Thing You Do! its title. “I just took it as an assignment and decided it was worth spending a couple of days on for a shot at something like this,” he later told People, adding that he often takes on songwriting assignments as a creative exercise. When it was chosen, Schlesinger recorded the song along with his bandmate Chase and songwriter Mike Viola on vocals. It ultimately earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Original song and became a minor hit in real life, reaching number 41 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nAround the same time, he reunited with Collingwood, and the pair began working on a set of songs that would eventually become Fountains of Wayne’s first self-titled album. The name was suggested by Schlesinger’s mother, Barbara Schlesinger, who lived near a statuary store of the same name in Wayne, New Jersey. Their unabashed power-pop hit a nerve when it was released in 1996, and its singles reached the U.K. Top 40. Speaking to the AV Club in 2011 about “Radiation Vibe,” Schlesinger said, “I don’t know what it is about that song, but it’s got some kind of magic, fun quality to it that we never really had in anything before. I got very jealous of that song, and then we recorded a version of it and it came out so great. It really was the inspiration to write that whole first record.”\n\nThe band went on hiatus after their second album, Utopia Parkway, and were dropped by major label Atlantic Records. Without any label support, they reconvened to record again, and Schlesinger brought in a song he had been working on inspired by the Cars. “Stacy’s Mom” became the lead single, and was the band’s biggest hit, reaching number 21 on the Billboard 100."
