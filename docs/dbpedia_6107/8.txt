A longtime Upstate South Carolina TV personality will appear next month in Salem, and Lynne Martin is sending an invitation out to come to hear and meet Beverly Exercise of Greenville’s WGGS-TV (Channel 16). At 80 years old, Beverly is still active as the host of an exercise show in which she mixes spirituality. She’s to speak at 1 o’clock Saturday afternoon, August 3 at the Eagles Nest Art Center in Salem. There’s no admittance charge; however, donations are accepted.
