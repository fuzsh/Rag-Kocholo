On Tuesday, January 29, from 8-10 PM Eastern Time, Clint Fleming and I will appear on the Niteline show of WGGS television, broadcast out of Greenville, SC.

Niteline is Dove Broadcasting’s two-hour Christian variety production that features Gospel music, Biblical teaching, practical help for Christians and prayer and counseling by trained phone workers.

Program Description from the Station

Keith Kelly and Pastor Steve Watson host a program dedicated to promoting good health. Clinton Fleming, from Simpsonville, a registered nurse who works full-time in an Emergency Room, discusses his work with local ministries to establish disease prevention and health promotion within Christian churches. Dale Fletcher, of Charlotte, North Carolina, shares information about the Faith and Health Connection ministry he has founded and explains the connection between spirituality and health.
