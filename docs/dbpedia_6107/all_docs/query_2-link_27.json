        "text": "Joanne and Jimmy Thompson say a message from God led them to begin their television ministry 25 years ago.\n\nWGGS TV 16, which is celebrating its anniversary this week, is now the cornerstone of a multimillion dollar operation overseen by Jimmy Thompson. \"Back then, all we knew about TV was how to turn our black and white television on and off,\" Joanne said in a recent interview at the TV 16 studio in Taylors. When the Thompsons began their ministry, televangelism was not a well-known means of financial success or of Christian outreach. \"It was thought of as a strange way of spreading the Gospel,\" said Joanne. What once was strange is now commonplace. Religious programming now occupies channels on many cable systems across the country. WGGS, though, is the only religious station in the Upstate, reaching viewers as far as western North Carolina and northeastern Georgia. The genesis of WGGS occurred in 1968, when Jimmy Thompson was the preacher at Faith Temple Church in Taylors. Evangelical couple Jim and Tammy Bakker came to the church to preach at a revival. The Thompsons and the Bakkers became friends, and Jim Bakker's connection with Pat Robertson led to Joanne being offered a chance to sing on Robertson's \"700 Club.\" \"On the way back from that show, God spoke to my husband and said, 'I want you to come back to Greenville and start a television station,' \" Joanne said. Jimmy was immediately persuaded to begin planning the new station. Joanne took further convincing. \"I saw what it cost and said, 'No, we don't have the money. We're not doing this,' \" she said. \"So my husband spoke to God and said, 'God, there she is. You can do more with her than I can.' Then God began to work on me and say that this is His plan.\" The Thompsons bought secondhand TV cameras and equipment and opened a small studio on Greenville's Paris Mountain. Almost five years later, WGGS went on the air. Later, they moved the studio to Taylors, though the station's transmitter remains on Paris Mountain. \"We didn't have any money,\" Joanne said. \"Jim and I would go up to Paris Mountain and look down on the houses at night. We'd pray that any of the lights we'd see would one day have their television turned to channel 16.\" Jimmy's Faith Publishing Co., which has published religious and secular books, school annuals and other products since 1958, helped the couple remain fiscally afloat. At the time, he was still pastoring Faith Temple. The advent of cable television in the 1970s pushed WGGS's programs into an increasing number of homes. WGGS scratched out its place in the market by airing Christian music, religious services and talk shows, mostly using local performers. The Thompsons raised money through pledges from viewers during telethons, and the station provided Christian telephone counselors to take calls from those in need of help. Eventually, the demands of the station became sufficient for Jimmy to give up his ministerial position. \"This is a ministry,\" Joanne said. \"Our congregation is larger than a normal church's and we can't see them all, but they're still there. You know, Jay Leno would think you'd lost your mind if you called and asked him to pray for you. But we do that every day.\" Office Manager Norma Barnett has been at WGGS 22 years. \"It's a ministry as well as a job,\" she said. \"We have our ups and downs like any business, but this is a good place to work.\" Just as they have from the outset, Joanne and Jimmy co-host the live \"Nite Line\" program each week. Barnett estimates the show, which airs at 8 p.m. Monday through Friday, receives more than 200 requests for prayer each night. The Thompsons differ in performance styles, with Joanne's talkative, bubbly personality contrasting with Jimmy's tendency to remain in the background. \"I wish I had that originality or spunk that she has,\" Jimmy said. \"I've pastored for 30 years, and I guess I'm more of a homebody.\" \"We support each other, but our ministry has always been in two different directions,\" Joanne said. \"I've never been the average pastor's wife. I go where angels fear to tread.\" Joanne routinely travels to do missionary work in foreign countries, state penitentiaries and Appalachian hollows. \"I go where the action is,\" she said. \"My husband would never do things like that, but he's taking care of business in other ways.\" Jimmy said his business prowess has led to a number of opportunities to \"spread the Gospel.\" The first of those opportunities came about in the early 1980s, when the Thompsons purchased a second television station, WGSE in Myrtle Beach. 1995 brought the acquisition of channel 63 in Sumter and the sale (for $1.5 million, according to \"Broadcasting and Cable\") of the Myrtle Beach station. And in 1996, the Thompsons started a station in Atlanta. Industry estimates from Dun and Bradstreet place the yearly profits of the Thompsons' businesses at more than $5 million. Jimmy declined to offer details of their financial assets. The Thompsons say they have tried to live simply. \"We've never had big homes or big cars,\" Joanne said. \"We have tried to remain real, and I think we've done a good job of that. God gets all the credit.\" \"God has blessed us,\" Jimmy said, \"and we've tried to handle God's money as it should be handled.\"\n\nNews researcher Carolyn Edds contributed to this article.\n\n25-YEAR CELEBRATION What: WGGS TV 16 Silver Jubilee.
