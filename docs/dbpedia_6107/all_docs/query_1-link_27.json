        "text": "\"This is the best book I've ever read, next to the Bible. I have given one to a lady whose son committed suicide, one to a missionary whose wife passed with cancer, one to the mother of a nursing student at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, who has been looking for something to share with the families of her terminally ill brain cancer patients, one to the wife of a Viet Nam vet who is suffering from the after effects of Agent Orange, one to a man whose company was on the brink of bankruptcy, one to a discouraged pastor's wife, one to a lady whose husband is an addict...thank you for writing this book of hope to comfort God's people.\"\n\n— G.

Before you make your next big decision, read this book!”\n\n-Beth Jones - Pastor & Author of Getting a Grip on the Basics Series\n\n“Karen’s 10 keys for finding God’s direction are masterpieces that will help you in your personal walk with the Lord.

I've had this book on my bedside table for many years!\"\n\n— G.M.\n\n“Using this devotional (and going through the video series) has totally changed the way we raise our children. God has a plan and purpose for them and we need to raise them up so they can fulfill their God given purpose. I would highly suggest that every parent use it! We are blessed because we do.”\n\n— B.Z.\n\n“I used this devotional daily over my troubled teenaged son, and slowly as the Word began to work I saw a change. He accepted Jesus as his Savior, and now he is active in youth group, doing well in school, and a joy to be around. He does chores when asked and even helps on his own. I believe it happened because I stayed committed to speaking the Word over him -- and this devotional is the tool that has helped me to do it.”\n\n— S.R.\n\n“Our church members use this devotional in German in their home group. It has really helped the moms pray for their children! They love it!”\n\n— J.L.\n\n“As a parent, I make hundreds of choices a day that will affect and mold my child. It is so relieving not to be winging it, but to be parenting with purpose!”\n\n— V.S."
