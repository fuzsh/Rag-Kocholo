        "text": "Greta Campbell will be 90 years old this Saturday, March 20.\n\nYou may wish to send a birthday card to Greta at this mailing address:\n\nGreta Campbell\n\n600 Hunts Bridge Road, Lot 411\n\n​Greenville, SC 29617\n\nGreta was saved at the age of 15 on July 13, 1946 and joined the Sandy Springs (SC) Pentecostal Holiness Church in 1947. In the following years, whenever possible, Greta and her brother, Arthur, would travel to wherever their sister, Evangelist Inez Campbell, was conducting revivals and join her in singing and worship.\n\nBy 1951, Greta knew God was calling her into the ministry. She says she hadn’t told anyone about her surrender to the call to preach except an out of town friend to whom she wrote and asked not to tell anyone. Well, the friend told her pastor and the pastor of Reedy Grove P H Church (Greenwood, SC area) wrote Greta and asked her to come for a two-week revival! So, Greta’s first sermon on October 13, 1951, was also the beginning of her first revival!\n\nIn 1952, Greta became a licensed minister in the Upper South Carolina Conference of the Pentecostal Holiness Church. Also, that year, Pat Welch, a gifted pianist and singer, joined Greta and they became a team, ministering in many churches throughout mostly the southeast.\n\nIn 1961, Ramona Ready from Mobile, Alabama, joined Greta and Pat and they formed the Greta Campbell Trio. They travelled across the country ministering in Word and song until 1973, during which time they recorded eleven long play albums. After the trio dismantled due to the many miles between Mobile and Greenville, SC, Greta’s brother, William (Willie) Campbell later became the third person of the trio and they continued singing together until Willie’s health no longer allowed to sing. Greta and Pat had recorded two albums as a duet and then a CD with Willie.\n\nIn addition to God’s mighty call on Greta to sing and preach the Gospel, He also called her to a powerful television ministry. In 1972, Greta had the privilege of hosting the very first program aired on WGGS TV-16 , a station in Greenville, SC founded by Rev. Jimmy and Joanne Thompson. She continued hosting Niteline on Thursday evenings for 43 years until 2016. The homes she has reached with the glorious Gospel, and the lives she has touched are immeasurable.\n\n[Editor's comment: I have known Greta Campbell since 1964. I invited Greta and her Greta Campbell Trio for a two-week revival at my first pastorate, the Brownville Pentecostal Holiness Church, near Evergreen, AL. We had a large number of youth in our church, and everyone of them was saved in this revival with the exception of one boy. Numerous people were saved, sanctified, and baptized with the Holy Spirit.\n\nGreta Campbell, Pat Welch, and Ramona Ready composed the trio. Melvine and I kept them in the parsonage where we lived. They stayed in one bedroom. We had two bedrooms and only one bathroom. I walked over to the fellowship hall of our church (next door) to take my showers and use the bathroom to allow the ladies to have privacy and the time they needed.\n\nThe revival fires burned brightly, and people came from near and far to the services. God blessed us and those who came.\n\nI have kept in touch with Greta all these years. Melvine and I were privileged to go on a Holy Land Trip to Israel with Greta and Phillip Hart as our hosts/leaders. There were 17 people in our group. It was an unforgettable trip.\n\nOne year, as I recall, I selected Greta Campbell as Hugh's News Woman of the Year. Melvine and I, along with Stephanie were interviewed on Greta's Niteline telecast. When Greg was preparing to go to Budapest, Hungary as a tentmaker missionary, he sang several solos on the program.\n\nI want to wish Greta a happy 90th Birthday on Saturday, March 20, 2021.\n\nI am grateful to Gloria Hart Moon, a niece of Greta, for sharing this information about Greta's life and ministry.]"
