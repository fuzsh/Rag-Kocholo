        "text": "Advertisements\n\nThe TV channel reassignments have been announced as part of the FCC repack. Good news is that theoretically most current receiving antennas should have no major changes in reception, despite the channel changes. As most major channels will remain High VHF and UHF. However, there are 2 significant changes: WGGS will move from channel 16 to channel 2, and WYCW-62 will go off the air.\n\nA larger outside antenna with the long VHF elements may be needed to receive WGGS, rather than indoor rabbit ears or the current UHF loop antennas. And low channel VHF can be problematic for digital reception and subject to noise and interference.\n\nWYCW is expected to channel share with sister station WSPA, which is moving from channel 7 to channel 11. Hopefully they will utilize advanced encoding methods to multicast 2 HD channels and maintain video quality. it is unknown if they will keep additional subchannels such as MeTV, the home of classic sitcoms and retro programming.\n\nWYFF-4 is moving from 36 to 30, and WHNS FOX Carolina is moving from 21 to 17. Both channels will reduce power because theoretically a lower frequency requires less power to maintain the same coverage area, according to the dipole factor.\n\nWLOS from Asheville will remain on the same problematic channel 13, and it is unknown if they will be allowed any changes in their current transmitting pattern which has a null towards the Upstate. Sister station WMYA-40 is moving from 14 to 35.\n\nAnd the fate of many translators serving NC and parts of the Upstate is unknown, as the TV spectrum in the UHF band has been reduced to make room for cellular signals.\n\nAs for PBS, WNVT-29 from Greenville will move from 9 to 8 for SCETV, and WRET-29 will go off the air from Spartanburg. WNVT should cover most of the Upstate and remove unnecessary duplication from WRET. And UNCTV-33 from Asheville will move from 25 to 20.\n\nAnd WBTV from Charlotte will maintain their current strong signal in the Upstate as they will remain on channel 23 with their current transmission pattern. All other Charlotte channels will move, but WCNC and WJZY should also continue to be received in the Upstate, but they may not be quite as strong as WBTV depending upon power levels and transmitting antenna patterns which remain to be seen. WMYT-55 is going off the air and will channel share with sister station WJZY FOX-46. WSOC may continue to reach Spartanburg, but not Greenville.\n\nSo long story short: Major channels WYFF, WSPA, WHNS, and WBTV should remain strong and easy to receive with current antenna. WLOS may remain problematic, and WGGS may become problematic.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Jandrew5\n\nSo the Upstate is losing the CW? I'm confused. You said it's sharing with CBS, how is that possible?\n\nIs this just for antennaes or does it affect digital too? Will CBS be moving from 7 to 11 on Directv/Charter?\n\nThe changes will affect the over the air broadcast signals. There should be no changes on cable or satellite carriage barring the occaissonal contract dispute.\n\nCBS is currently 707 on Charter Spectrum HD. (WSPA). That should remain the same. CW will also likely continue to be carried.\n\nAs for over the air, digital broadcasting allows for multiple channels on one frequency. 7.1 is CBS-HD, 7.2 is MeTV, and 7.3 is Ion. They will probably move CW to 7.2 and have 2 HD channels. They may drop MeTV or Ion. That is unclear at the moment. But the concern is proper multiplexing to preserve video quality on the HD channels. It is already done successfully in other markets such as Johnson City, TN and Wilmington, NC. Depends on encoders and various technical aspects."
