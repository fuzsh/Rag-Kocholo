        "text": "Attention antenna users – six local TV stations changed frequencies recently, and more will change next summer.\n\nHere's what viewers in the Upstate need to know about the changes and how to reconfigure their televisions.\n\nWhy are channels changing?\n\nWith the 5G and other broadband services taking up space in the airwaves, TV stations must change frequencies in order to make room for all the activity, a release from the FCC said.\n\nWho needs to rescan their TV?\n\nCable and satellite television subscribers will not be affected by these changes. Only viewers who use antennas to watch local channels will have to rescan their TV.\n\nWhen are channels changing?\n\nSix stations have already changed frequencies, and four more will change between May and July 2020, according to Jean Kiddoo with the FCC.\n\nIf you go to a channel you usually watch and get a blue or \"snowy\" screen saying \"weak connection,\" it's likely that station has already changed frequencies.\n\nKiddoo said stations will change frequencies on a rolling basis, so viewers may experience this multiple times and have to rescan their televisions more than once.\n\nWhich channels are changing?\n\nThese stations transitioned two weeks ago:\n\nWYFF-TV (NBC 4)\n\nWHNS-TV (Fox 21)\n\nWGGS-TV (Ch. 16)\n\nWNEH-TV (PBS 38)\n\nWUNF-TV (PBS 33)\n\nWMYA-TV (Ch. 40)\n\nThese stations will change frequencies next summer:\n\nWCTI\n\nNCT\n\nWNTV\n\nWSPA\n\nThese stations will run on-air announcements with more details about their future changes, Kiddoo said.\n\nHow do you rescan your TV?\n\n\"Rescanning is not terribly complicated,\" Kiddoo said. \"Everybody who uses an antenna had to scan their TV when they installed the antenna to teach the TV which stations were available.\"\n\nViewers simply have to go to the menu button on their remote control and select \"auto scan,\" \"channel scan,\" or \"channel tunnel.\"\n\nGET YOUR ANSWERS\n\nThrough local journalism, we help get you answers to questions about issues, big and small. Please consider becoming a subscriber. Here's our special offer.\n\nFor those who have difficulty rescanning their TV, the FCC has posted a 90-second video explainer online and has a helpline open seven days a week from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. EST: just call 1-888-CALLFCC (1-888-225-5322) and press “6.”\n\nWhat happens after viewers rescan?\n\nOnce the rescan process is complete, viewers will retain their existing channels and in some cases gain others in their broadcast area, the FCC said."
