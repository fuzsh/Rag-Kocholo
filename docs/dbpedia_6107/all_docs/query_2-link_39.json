Thompson, have produced Christian programming for more than 38 years. Joanne regularly hosted WGGS' program “Nite Line.” Other programs she hosted included “You Can Make It” and “The Jo-Mitch Show.”\n\nIn addition to reaching people through broadcast, she also did mission work in Appalachia, Romania and Moldova.\n\nThe funeral service for Thompson will be held at 3 p.m. Sunday at Faith Temple Church, 5080 Sandy Flat Road in Taylors, and burial will follow in the church cemetery.\n\nWGGS studios are at 3409 Rutherford Road Ext. in Taylors.\n\nSprings of Grace Lutheran Church, 7420 Highway 9 in Inman, will celebrate Shrove Tuesday with its annual All-You-Can-Eat Pancake Supper from 6 to 8 p.m. Tuesday.

Children 12 and younger will eat free.\n\nDuncan First Baptist will hold a fundraiser March 12 to raise money for a mission trip to Nicaragua. The fundraiser is called The Big Stay 5k because the church's pastors will spend 48 hours in a replica of a Nicaraguan home.\n\n“The pastors will live like the people live in the barrios of Nicaragua, with no running water, no electricity in a 10' x 12' home wrapped in black plastic,” according to a written statement.\n\nThe cost to participate in the Big Stay 5k race is $25, and a 1-mile fun run is $15. The fun run starts at 8 a.m. and the 5k race starts at 8:30 a.m. People can register online at www.thebigstay.com or the day of the race from 7:30 to 8:15 a.m.\n\nWalkers also are welcome to participate.\n\nThe race starts at Duncan First Baptist and ends at The Big Stay Nicaragua home, to give participants insight into the needs of Nicaragua.\n\nPeople can also make pledges per hour for the time the pastors live in the “plastic home.”\n\nPledges and donations may be made online at www.thebigstay.com or during the weekend of March 11-13.\n\nEvangelist James Croft of Olustee, Fla., will preach revival services Sunday through Wednesday at Cudd Memorial Baptist Church, 1301 Boiling Springs Road.\n\n“James has what some pastors have called a unique evangelistic ministry in that he is only 3 feet 10 inches tall. His size attracts the attention of adults, youth and children, allowing him the opportunity to share the gospel. He even has a pulpit that was made to fit his size. He jokingly says, ‘Have pulpit, will travel,' ” according to his website.\n\nSunday services start at 11 a.m. and 6 p.m. Sunday school breakfast will be served in the church's Christian life center at 8:30 a.m.\n\nServices start at 6:30 p.m. Monday through Wednesday.

Beginning with the ‘Imposition of the Ashes' on Ash Wednesday and running through Easter Eve, April 23, Lent lasts a total of six weeks,” according to a written statement.\n\n“Lent has become, over the centuries, a time during which Christians prepare themselves spiritually for the celebration of the resurrection. … This is the time in the Christian year that we engage in special disciplines: fasting, more prayer time, personal reflection and special acts of charity. We do this to keep Lent holy in preparation for the joy of the Resurrection.”\n\nThe Rev. Ian Walker, pastor of Christ Community Church of the Foothills, and his wife, Esther, will begin a six-week study on the second coming of Jesus on Sunday.\n\nThe study starts at 6 p.m. and will explore the New Testament book of Revelation.
