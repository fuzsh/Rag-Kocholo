        "text": "I had such an amazing time as I visited Greenville, SC. This beautiful quaint town was relaxing and restful as I encountered so many God-fearing individuals on fire for God. From my taxi driver Brenda who drove me in style to my hotel, to my yellow cab driver named Abraham who most certainly lived up to his name. I was all smiles as I watched God orchestrate this trip–worry free!\n\nYes, that is the God we serve, for He is who He says he is. Trust me, you can believe that. I was blessed during my stay in Greenville to attend the Redemption Chruch where the lead pastor Ron Carpenter Jr. delivered a powerful word. I love that the lord knestled me in between two wonderful women who I was able to love on and encourage while they encouraged me also. Iron sharpening iron, just as God designed it.\n\nAfter I marinated on the awesome word at Redemption Church, I was blessed to be a guest on Niteline television show through Dovebroadcasting -WGGS TV 16 with the fabulous host Sean Hamilton. We had so much fun talking about my new book Beyond the Face of the Movies, DCL Ministries, my Christian show, under PJC Media Network, called Dovetales and my theatrical play titled, God’s Office. You never know where the trials and tribulations of life can bring you. 10 years ago, I wasn’t sure how I was going to survive after going through a divorce, but God is MIGHTY TO SAVE and his mercies and grace for humanity is endless.\n\nDuring the show we were so blessed by the anointed Mime Ministry lead by Chainah Street, from Mauldin, SC. God brought us all together to praise his name and give Him the glory.\n\n“But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you” Matthew 6:33.\n\nThank you to everyone who believes in and supports DCL Ministries. Join the movement of Random Acts Of Kindness as we act with compassion, like Jesus did, when seeing those in need.\n\nDCL Ministries"
