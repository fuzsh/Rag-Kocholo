History

The Beginning

In June 1954, a new campus was opened on a 4.86-hectare lot along Samson Road , Caloocan, then it was still known as UE Tech. With the Technical School as a Junior College offering Liberal Arts courses and training technical subjects, and a complete secondary course with both academic and vocational curricula, the 2-2 Plan of the Department of Education was then complied with.

School year 1957-1958 marked the offering of general courses leading to the Associate in Arts, Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor in Business Administration degrees and a one-year Secretarial course leading to a Certificate in Secretarial Science. The next six years saw the construction of the High School Building, the Gymnasium, the Applied Industrial Training Building, the Home Economics Building, the block-long Shop Buildings, the Cement Products Shop and the Woodworking and Construction Building.

By school year 1960-1961, first- and second-year Liberal Arts, first- and second-year Commerce and Pre-law courses were offered. By August 1964, the UETS started phasing out its technical offerings. The elementary School and the High School as well as Secretarial courses were also phased out but in their place, Engineering courses and a complete Business Administration program were offered starting in 1977. Thus, began the campus shift from being a vocational-technical school to becoming the academic extension of UE Manila.

In 1976, when extension programs began to be offered, the Caloocan Campus adopted the name University of the East Caloocan.

The School of Fine Arts was relocated to the Caloocan Campus before the opening of SY 1981-1982. The SFA, established on July 15, 1964 and incorporated in October of that year, started as a unit of the UE Manila School of Music and Arts under the UE Research Center for Sciences, Humanities and Culture. The other units were the School of Music and the Ballet School. The school used to be in what was then the College of Dentistry building in Aurora Boulevard across the UE Ramon Magsaysay Memorial Medical Center.

The four-storey Engineering Building was inaugurated in 1980. What used to be the technical shops were gradually converted into classrooms for the students of the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Business Administration until November 2003.

In 1977, the late Dean Oscar Limlingan of the College of Engineering was appointed officer-in-charge of UE Caloocan. Later, he became assistant vice president, then vice president and the first chancellor of UE Caloocan.

At Present

At present, the 4.86-hectare UE Caloocan has the Colleges of Arts and Sciences (CAS), Business Administration (CBA), Fine Arts (CFA) and Engineering (CoE). All four have counterpart colleges in UE's Manila Campus, except for the College of Fine Arts. The UE Caloocan grounds have been used for ROTC and CAT instruction since 1986.

The College of Business Administration continues to be the largest of the four in terms of student population.Fact|date=April 2008 It has four course offerings: the Bachelors of Science in Accountancy (BSA), Business Administration (BSBA), Accountancy and Computer-Based Accounting Systems(BSA-CAS) and Bachelor of Sciences in Entrepreneurship(BSE).

The CAS offers the Bachelor of Arts (AB) degree program, with Communication Arts as major.

The College of Enineering has six course offerings, thus far: Civil Engineering (BSCE), Computer Engineering (BSCoE), Electrical Engineering (BSEE), Electronics and Communications Engineering (BSECE), Mechanical Engineering (BSME) and Industrial Engineering (BSIE).The college currently hosts the Information Technology (BSIT) program. Also under the College of Engineering is the Institute of Technical Education, which offers the one-year Machine Shop Technician course.

The College of Fine Arts offers the Bachelor of Fine Arts program and Industrial Design degrees.

UE Caloocan recently enhanced its own infrastructure and that of Caloocan City with the Tan Yan Kee Academic Building, which was opened in the second semester of SY 2003-2004 and was inaugurated in December 2003.

The College of Engineering owns building a four-storey sprawl that houses over 50 lecture rooms, 24 laboratories and lab rooms, various tool rooms and stock rooms, two machine shops and the Campus two Multipurpose Halls.

In February 2004, UE Caloocan was honored by the City Government of Caloocan as "One of the Outstanding Institutions of Caloocan City" in the field of education. The award was given to UE Caloocan "for its invaluable contribution in the field of education towards the realization of our vision of a truly reformed City of Caloocan, revitalizing the historic legacy of our City." The Caloocan Campus marked its 50th year with the UE Caloocan Week. Timed to coincide with Caloocan Day, the UE Caloocan Week projected its vital role as an educational institution serving the youth in the CAMANAVA and neighboring areas.
