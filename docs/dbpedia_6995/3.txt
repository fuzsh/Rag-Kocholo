The University of the East (UE) is opening its doors to aspiring first-year college students from different high schools for a campus tour, meet-and-greet opportunities, and activities this Thursday and Friday, March 7 to 8, 2024.

Both UE Manila and UE Caloocan will host an open house for incoming freshmen who will be given the chance to tour the campus, interact with UE student organization officers and athletes, and participate in games and raffle draws.

Founded in 1946, the private, autonomous university will also allow participating students the opportunity to take the UE College Entrance Test (CET) on the said dates for free or without having to pay any fee.

Registration for the exam can be done online before the intended schedule of either March 7 or 8 via https://www.ue.edu.ph/onlineadmission/main.html.
