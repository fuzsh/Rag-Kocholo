        "text": "The major purpose of the study was to measure the effect of scholarships on students’ social development at the university level. The study was descriptive, and the survey method was applied for the collection of data. The population consisted of all teachers and students of public and private universities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad. The total population of teachers in the public and private universities were 4073 and students were 101968. A stratified random sampling technique was applied for selecting the study sample. The researcher selected 525 teachers from public and private universities as well as 900 students from public and private universities. The researcher developed two questionnaires using a five-point Likert scale on the foundation of related literature and with the help of the supervisor. The validity of the instruments was checked by two experts in the field. The reliability of these instruments was determined through Cronbach’s alpha which was 0.832. Mean, standar...\n\nScholarship schemes have been long around in India since 1961, with various custom required based scholarships which facilitate a student to choose from according to their needs and requirements. Not only the central but the state government has made its own scholarship programs available to their students which further illustrate their motive, of supporting their students and encouraging them for further studies, it can be concluded that scholarships by the government to have a visible impact on students for the motivation of further studies and they have clearly been successful in providing equal opportunity to all students.\n\nScholarships are awarded based on various criteria, which usually reflect the values and purposes of the donor or funder of the award. Therefore, in a bid to verify the impact of scholarships on students' academic performance using tertiary institutions in Enugu State, Nigeria as a case study, the study utilised survey data generated from 540 questionnaires distributed among student in twelve (12) higher institutions in Enugu State, Nigeria. The propensity score matching model was adopted for the study and the results indicated that students' academic performances significantly increase with an increase in the award of scholarships. The results also suggested that with scholarships academic performance of students in higher institutions in Enugu state would decreases by 13% but will rise by about 87% if the scholarships are given to indigent students'. There is need for increased award of scholarships to students from poor background and not to students from high socioeconomic status by the government, Non-governmental organizations, and other philanthropist to alleviate the challenge. Government should revitalize the giving of bursary awards to students from their respective states that are in higher institutions, be it private or public. Essentially, scholarships should be awarded to people who are poor and find it difficult to pay tuition fees, eat at least two times per day, and also who find it difficult to clothe themselves.\n\nRepublic Act No. 10931 intends to provide all Filipinos with an equal opportunity to quality tertiary education as to ensure the optimized utilization of government resources in education. This study investigated how the state university students utilized the 28,000 grant, and how it directly helped their education. Data was collected during the second semester of 2018-2019. In sample size 336 students, 77% have a family income of 10,000 and below. The items purchased by students in decreasing order were: 21% cellphone, 20% laptop, 20% boarding house fee, 19% food/groceries, and 13% clothes/shoes. Only 16% of the respondents had bank accounts, 88% sent money to parents, while 10% did not inform parents. The students gave priority to products they found helpful to their studies but were not affordable without subsidy. It is therefore concluded that the top five items are considered to be the basic needs of a student to tackle college degrees in Philippine state universities; subsid...\n\nGiven the challenges faced due to declining public budgets on education on one hand and the need for more resources on the other, many developed and developing countries such as India, are now examining alternative methods of subsidizing higher education to benefit students from the deprived sections. One such mechanism is scholarship schemes for students. A scholarship scheme is not a new phenomenon in India. Scholarship Schemes have been in operation in India since 1961. This paper critically examines 24 scholarship schemes provided by the central government and, the paper examines the private expenditure of students on their higher education. The study provides us with some interesting observations such as (1) The GER (Gross Enrollment ratio) of all categories is 26.3% in higher education but when we exclude SC (scheduled caste) and ST (scheduled tribe) from it; then GER for all other categories increases to 28.25%. (2) The share of means-based scholarship schemes is less in comparison to means cum merit and merit-based scholarship schemes. (3) Student's private expenditure on course fees is more than 65%, but only 46% of scholarship schemes cover both the course fees and the maintenance cost of the students. (4) The average private expenditure of students on maintenance cost in general degree courses is ₹ 7,078 and for technical/professional degree course it is ₹ 17,769; however, the maintenance amount provided by 70 % of the scholarship schemes is less than 5,000 rupees. The study concludes that the current scholarship schemes are making little contribution to either the efficiency or equity of the higher education system in India. The existing lacuna in Indian scholarship schemes can be corrected by doing some alterations in the policies, such as: (1) the government should be more focused on the means-based scholarship rather than merit-based. (2) The scholarship amount for both the course fees and the maintenance cost should be revised every 5 years and, (3) A greater number of scholarship schemes should cover the course fees of the students.\n\nEducation is the most crucial input for empowering people especially youth with skills and knowledge and giving them access to productive employment in future. It develops confidence and helps in building the personality of a person. Education improves an individual's quality of life. Hence, it is necessary to develop an education system which generates human capital for achieving social and economic development. But Education is increasing with the new paradigm. Education is becoming very costly in recent time. The fee structures followed by different institutions are different and higher. Mostly students cannot afford the costly education. But the central government is playing a tremendous role in financing the education by providing scholarships to the eligible students. The aim of this research paper to emphasize on some national scholarships and highlight the Gross Enrollment ratio of India. The paper concludes with recommendations on enhancing the effectiveness of scholarships to improve access and\n\nSingle Tuition Scholarship (UKT) is a grant provided by the Ministry of Education and Culture (Kemendikbud) to universities, both State Universities (PTN) and Private Universities (PTS). This aims to help underprivileged people so they can get education in higher education, both PTN and PTS. The large number of UKT recipient participants overwhelmed the University and made the decision not objective. For this reason, it is necessary to have a decision support system (SPK) in order to help deal with these problems. There are many methods that can be used in SPK including the MOORA method, WASPAS, TOPSIS, SAW, WPS and many more. In this study, researchers tried to compare two methods between the WASPAS method and the MOORA method in determining UKT scholarship recipients. There are five criteria for selecting recipients of UKT assistance, namely parents&#39; income, electricity bills, water bills, land and building taxes and family expenses. The results of this study were students who...\n\nVarious academic scholarship schemes are introduced in India with the aim of inspiring students for better academic performance. However, for availing such scholarships it depends largely on the level of awareness among the students about the scholarship schemes. Though a considerable number of scholarship schemes are available in India, level of awareness regarding scholarship among students is not known. The present study was conducted to assess the awareness of Agricultural University students on different Scholarship Schemes. Two hundred forty undergraduate students from Assam Agricultural University were included as respondents by using stratified random sample method for the study. One questionnaire was prepared on “Google Form” for online data collection. Frequency, percentage, Mean, Standard Deviation and chi square test were used for analysing the data statistically. The findings reveal that majority of the students of Assam Agricultural University had awareness on Ishan Ud..."
