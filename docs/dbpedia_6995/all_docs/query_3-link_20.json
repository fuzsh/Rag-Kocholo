We are sorry to interrupt, but it is Saturday, August 17, and this site notice will be up for the lockdown. We ask you to leave Robloxiapedia while Robloxiapedia Staff are placing the site under lockdown due to excessive vandalism and spam. In the age of vandalism and spam, access to verifiable Roblox fan information is crucial. Robloxiapedia is at the heart of online fan information, powering everything from your personal searches to emerging Roblox games. Your gift strengthens the fan knowledge of today and tomorrow. Unfortunately, if the verifiable Roblox fan information ever gets vandalized and spammed, the heart of online fan information will stop beating. If Robloxiapedia is one of the websites you use, please do not vandalize Robloxiapedia next time and just edit in good faith next time. Every contribution in good faith helps: every edit made in good faith, every gift made in good faith counts. Sincerely, Director of Robloxiapedia. Any questions?
