        "text": "By: Crishia Villanueva\n\nThinking about your future at a young age is not the usual. You might see young people outside worrying on how will they budget their allowances in a week, how will they save money to buy their favorite kicks for their ootds, worrying on what movie will they watch, what photo to post in their Facebook and Instagram accounts, what filter will they use just to make their Instagram feeds a feed goal one, where to eat and spend the weekend with their friends, and the likes… But for Jerryl, these are just minor things. What matters to him the most is his future. His future in the canvass he is now sketching.\n\nAbout the Subject\n\nJerryl S. Domingo, 17 years old, a second year Accounting Technology Student in University of the East Caloocan, dreams to become a CPA someday. He is pursuing this course because he loves Economics and Business, and planning to shift from BS Accounting Technology to BS Accountancy. His story about to be unfolded is a story of him as he prepare himself to the future. Young but future ready!\n\nAll about his dream\n\nEvery dream corresponds to hindrances and struggles. Hindrances that would resist you to pursue something that you really want to achieve. Struggles that you will encounter along the way, that will cause you to look down and pause for a while. But for Jerryl, these are the driving points that will cause him to continue to drive his dreams up. He had encounter hindrances and struggles in pursuing his dream to become an accountant.\n\nOne major hindrance that almost restrict him in pursuing his dream is the lack of financial support. Jerryl’s mother is not that capable of sending him to a private school like UE that’s why his aunt take charge on it. Unfortunately, his aunt can’t shoulder all his expenses in school so his elder sister take over. The same case happened. Jerryl almost lose his hope in his dream of becoming an accountant. It is very expensive. But, as what I have stated earlier, Jerryl considers this kind of hindrance as his driving point to continue. If there’s a will, there’s a way.\n\nJerryl as a Student Assistant\n\nFirst two semesters was done. Jerryl is now thinking of a way on how he can continue to study without spending thousands for tuition fee. It just happened that the university he’s in is looking for new student assistants. Jerryl immediately grabbed the opportunity. He is currently enrolled on his 2nd year 1st semester in the same school, working as a student assistant in the Information Technology Department.\n\nOn his way to his dream…\n\n“Ang pagiging isang student assistant ko dito sa UE Caloocan ay kinokonsider ko as a road to my future. Kasi sa pagiging student assistant ko dito, inoopen ko ang sarili ko sa mga posibleng mangayari sakin sa workplace ko in the near future. This will serve as a preparation for me on pursuing my dream to become an accountant. Bukod syempre sa mga technical skills na matututunan ko, exposed na ako sa possible work environment ko, attitudes of bosses and workamates, at marami pang iba. I’am also into time management and pagbabalance syempre ng academics at work. Importante to kasi ganito rin ang gagawin ko sa pagbabalance ng work at family sa futrure. Sobrang dami kong natutunan at matututunan pa. Isa itong great advantage for me, sa pag-abot ko ng mga pangarap ko.”\n\nWould you pursue your passion even it is the opposite of your desired profession?. Joshua E. Vacaro a 20 year old civil 5th year engineering student who will graduate next semester, but despite the fact that his course is difficult, he managed to push through to his current standing while doing both of his music and aspired profession.\n\nHe said that “music and measurements really differs, even so it wont stop me from doing my passion as a musician, It is what makes my heart beat”. Joshua plays as a keyboardist at their church, he carefully study every part of his piece playing with soul and vigor, his favorite piece? the classical music canon rock version.\n\nIn his studies, he allots a 4 hour review of every lesson they discuss in class. As breakthrough from school to his profession, he already designed a house for a client ” it was my fist time to draw but they were satisfied”, excelling both in academics and his profession Joshua did it well.\n\nHe definitely gave a message for all of us and to the students like him, but how did he did it? Joshua said that whenever he plays he remembers a quote from a philosopher that said that,\n\n“The river cuts through the river not because of its power but because of i’ts persistence”. -anonymous-\n\nJoshua E. Vacaro is an ordinary student of the University of the East but not so ordinary."
