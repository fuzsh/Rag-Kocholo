The University offers courses on Kindergarten, Elementary, Highschool and College.\n\nHistory\n\nManila Central University had a very humble beginning. In 1903, on the request of several students from the University of Sto. Tomas and other individuals, Dr. Alejandro Albert organized a private review class.\n\nThis review class developed into the Escuela de Farmacia del Liceo de Manila in 1904, with Dr. Alejandro Albert, Alfredo L. Guerrero, Antonio C. Llamas, Feliciano Paterno and Filemon Tanchoco, and all faculty members of the institution, as incorporators. This was the first educational institution of its kind established and managed by Filipinos. Its success demonstrated the undoubted capacity and ability of the Filipinos managing their own affairs in the educational field, especially then, when at that time of its initial organization it was barely 4 years after the establishment of the Philippine Educational System.\n\nThe Manila College of Pharmacy became one of the leading institutions of higher learning of its kind. It produced many prominent pharmacists. Stable and secure in its position, the college expanded in number in 1929. Its Board of Trustees, answering a long felt need for the training of the youth for dental services, opened the College of Dentistry. Manila College of Pharmacy became then the Manila College of Pharmacy and Dentistry of pre-war time.\n\nOpened and dedicated to gave the best education for our youth, the College maintained its leading position in the educational field. Unfortunately, the war closed its portals in 1941.\n\nDuring the Japanese occupation, the enemy systematically looted its extensive facilities, laboratory, equipment, museum, etc. and during the liberation period, it was further looted of everything but the shell of its two buildings.\n\nAfter the liberation of the Philippines, the Board of Trustees reorganized the College into Manila Central College.\n\nIn addition to Pharmacy and Dentistry, the reorganized institution offered courses in Liberal Arts, Education, Commerce and Business Administration and Post Graduate courses in Pharmacy. And finally in 1947, the College of Medicine was added. In 1948, it became the Manila Central University after having opened the College of Nursing and Graduate School and more than sufficiently meeting the requirements for a university.\n\nIn 1949, the MCU inaugurated its 10-hectare campus in Caloocan City. Since then, additional school buildings and service facilities have been constructed yearly in the 1960s. The College of Optometry, Midwifery and High School and Kindergarten classes were also opened. Expansion projects and development program for the whole university and individual colleges were continuously drawn to meet the educational demands and the objectives of the University.\n\nWebsite: www.mcu.edu.ph/\n\nInfolink: en.wikipilipinas.org/index.php?title=Manila_Central_Uni...\n\nNearby cities:"
