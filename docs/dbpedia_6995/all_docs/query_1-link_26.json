The university was founded in 1946 as a coeducational institution. Once labeled as the \"Largest University in Asia\" in terms of population, UE became the first university in Asia to have an enrollment of over 60,000 students.Fact|date=December 2007\n\nIn over 60 years of existence, the University of the East has grown into a respected private university in the Philippines. [cite news|title = University of the East: Nearly 60 years of quality education for the masses|publisher = Manila Bulletin| url = http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2004/07/30/SCAU2004073015212.html|accessdate = 2006-09-20] At present UE offers degree programs in commerce and business administration, law, dentistry, engineering, arts and sciences, fine arts, education, computer technology, nursing, physical therapy, medicine and graduate studies. University of the East has two extension campuses, namely UE Caloocan and UERM in Quezon City.\n\nUE is one of the eight member universities of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP), a member since 1952. UE was the host of the concluded 2006-2007 UAAP Season 69.\n\nSeveral colleges of UE - Manila have each been accredited the Level II status by the Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities Commission on Accreditation (PACUCOA). The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) has identified the Information Technology Department as a \"Center of Development in Information Technology Education\". [cite news|title = CHED cites UE as a “Center of Development in Information Technology Education”|publisher = University of the East| url = http://www.ue.edu.ph/manila/news/?news=200721.html|accessdate = 2007-03-15] The UERMMMC Colleges, for their part, have been accredited in high levels by the PhilippineAccrediting Agency of Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU). The College of Medicine has level II accreditation, Innovative Curriculum, Recognized as a Center of Excellence in Research by the Department of Science and Technology. The College of Nursing has level III and accredited by the Commission on Higher Education as Centers of Excellence.\n\nHistory\n\nThe history of the University of the East goes back to September 1946, in a rented room on Dasmariñas St., Manila, where 110 students enrolled in Certified Public Accountant (CPA) review classes. The group of business teachers led by Dr. Francisco T. Dalupan, Sr. that started the sessions made it their objective to help the country, which was still reeling from the war. Of the 110 students, four made it to top spots in the 1947 CPA board Examinations. [cite news|title = University of the East: Nearly 60 years of quality education for the masses|publisher = Manila Bulletin| url = http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2004/07/30/SCAU2004073015212.html|accessdate = 2006-09-20] On September 11, 1946, five people namely Francisco Dalupan, Sr., Herminiglio Reyes, Jose Torres, Jaime Hernandez and Santiago dela Cruz established the Philippine College of Commerce and Business Administration (PCCBA) along R. Papa St. in Sampaloc, Manila. The PCCBA admitted 350 students in the summer of 1947. The following year, more students enrolled and more academic units were organized, and the PCCBA moved to what is now UE's main campus on \"2219 Claro M. Recto Avenue\".\n\nPCCBA alumni performed successfully in the government's accountancy examinations. Because of this success, the government granted the PCCBA permission to establish other colleges, leading to the establishment of the Colleges of Liberal Arts, Business Administration, Dentistry, and the Graduate School of Business Administration. [cite news|title = University of the East: Nearly 60 years of quality education for the masses|publisher = Manila Bulletin| url = http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2004/07/30/SCAU2004073015212.html|accessdate = 2006-09-20]\n\nThe PCCBA was granted university status on July 3, 1951 and was renamed the \"University of the East\". Dalupan became UE's first President and Chairman of its Board of Trustees. The first members of the Board were Herminigildo B. Reyes, a businessman, scholar, and former Vice President of the University of the Philippines. Santiago F. de la Cruz, a CPA and business executive who later succeeded Dalupan as UE President. Jose L. Torres, a soldier, businessman, and accountant and Jaime Hernandez, who was former Secretary of Finance. The succeeding years saw the opening of the colleges of Law, Medicine, and Engineering, as well as the Graduate School of Education. The Graduate School later merged with the Graduate School of Business Administration.\n\nIn June 1954, UE opened a new campus, then known as UE Tech, on a 4.86-hectare lot along Samson Road in Caloocan. UE Caloocan, which is now academically autonomous, is headed by a Chancellor. The new Tan Yan Kee Academic Building houses the Colleges of Arts and Sciences, Business Administration, and Fine Arts, whereas the College of Engineering has its own building. The UE Caloocan grounds have been used for ROTC and CAT instruction since 1986.\n\nIn 1955, the UE purchased a one-hectare lot along Aurora Boulevard in Quezon City, where it established the College of Medicine. On May 17, 1957, the College was converted into a Foundation and named the UE Ramon Magsaysay Memorial Medical Center (UERMMMC).\n\nIn 1962 the University acquired a 5,850-square meter lot across UERMMMC. This became the Research Center for Sciences, Humanities and Culture, which is home to two buildings. One housed the School of Music and Arts and the Ballet School while the other housed the College of Dentistry and research laboratories. The School of Music and Arts, now the College of Fine Arts, moved to the Caloocan campus in 1981. On the mid 60's Dr. Francisco Dalupan commissioned the National Artist Guillermo Tolentino to create the symbol of every UEnian, the Lualhati from the figure of CBA student Ophelia Salas. The College of Dentistry moved to the Recto (Manila) campus in school year 1988-1989.\n\nIn 1967, the late President Diosdado Macapagal, father of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, decided to teach part-time in the College of Business Administration and branded UE as the \"People's University\". Fact|date=December 2007\n\nTogether with the expansion came rapid growth in enrollment. From the original 110 students in 1946, the student population steadily grew each year until 1960, when UE became the first Philippine university have an enrollment of over 60,000. The highest enrollment record was achieved during the first semester of school year 1975-1976, with 67,443 students registered. Today, the body of UE alumni is over 250,000 strong.\n\nThe economic crisis and recession that hit the Philippines in the 1980s did not spare UE. The devaluation of the peso, rising inflation, the high cost of wages, coupled with faculty, personnel and student strikes affected UE. Enrollment declined. This period intensified into a crisis that almost led to the school's being sold to a foreign religious group.\n\nFinancial trouble and academic decline continued to burden UE throughout the 1980s. Dr. Isidro D. Cariño, who became UE president in 1984, began applying measures that included personnel reduction, cost-cutting measures, and renting out of school premises and facilities on short-term and long-term leases. UE began offering a ladderized curriculum, a special course for executives, programs from the Institute for Computer Studies and Systems, and scholarships for accounting and engineering students. The lease of facilities enabled UE to hold back tuition fee increases in 1986-1987 and 1987-1988.\n\nWhen Cariño was appointed Secretary of Education of the Philippines in 1990, Panfilo O. Domingo, former President of Philippine National Bank, took over as Chairman of the Board of Trustees and became Chief Executive Officer and Acting President of the University.\n\nDomingo immediately worked to cure the financial ills of the University by retiring its short-term debts and instituting fiscal and operational reforms. Within five years, the University's loans were substantially reduced and the long-accumulated operating deficit was eliminated from the books. At the same time, Domingo began a massive rehabilitation of UE's infrastructure and academics.\n\nIn 1992, former Treasurer of the Philippines Rosalina S. Cajucom became UE President. After she retired in mid-1995, Domingo reassumed the presidency until the appointment of Dr. Josefina R. Cortes to the position in 1997. She was succeeded by Mr. Baltazar N. Endriga following her 2003 retirement.\n\nUE's programs have seen success from its inception up to the early 1980s, when UE graduates were among the topnotchers list of the CPA board exams. The University has likewise yielded topnotchers in other licensure board exams in Dentistry, Engineering, Education, Medicine, Nursing and Physical Therapy.

The UERMMMC Colleges, for their part, have been accredited by the PhilippineAccrediting Agency of Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU). The College of Medicine and Nursing has level II and level III respectively.\n\nRecently the University is labeled as \"One of the Most Wired Universities in the Country\", [cite news|title = Computer World Magazine, 2006 Computerworld Premier 100|publisher = Computer World Magazine, August-September 2006 Edition] conducted by the Computer World Magazine and Enterprise Magazine. Featured in the 2006 Computerworld Premier 100 of Computer World Magazine, the university ranked 15 among the top 100 corporations and companies in the use of Information Technology and is the only educational institution to have entered the list.\n\nThe University migrated from ATM to Gigabit Ethernet to support growing online requirements, expanding online learning capabilities and improving administrative functionality at its Manila campus with an Ethernet networking solution from Nortel Networks.

The upgrade will also support the University’s plan for a unified communications network ultimately linking the Manila facility with campuses in Caloocan and Quezon City.\n\nPresently the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) has identified the University of the East as a \"Center of Development in Information Technology Education\".
