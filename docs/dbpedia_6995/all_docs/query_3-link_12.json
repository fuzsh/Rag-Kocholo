To make the College more responsive to the needs of City's constituents, government employees with 60 undergraduate units were enrolled as third year students in the special Bachelor in Public Administration in 1997.\n\nOn February 9, 2004, after 33 long years, Municipal Ordinance No. 0379 converted the Caloocan City Polytechnic college into the full-fledged University of Caloocan City."
