        "text": "About University of Caloocan City\n\nThe University of Caloocan City (abbreviated as UCC) is a public-type local university established in 1971 and formerly called Caloocan City Community College and Caloocan City Polytechnic College. Its south campus is located at Biglang Awa St., Grace Park East, 12th Avenue, Caloocan, Metro Manila, Philippines (also known as EDSA/Biglang Awa Campus) and the north campuses are Camarin Business Campus, Congressional Campus, and TechVoc Campus (near Libis, Camarin).\n\nOn July 1, 1971, the Secretary of Education authorized the first-year operation of the proposed Caloocan City Community College. For this, Municipal Ordinance No. 1495 appropriated the amount of P23,400.00. Its purpose was to implement the national development goal which assures the maximum participation of all people in the attainment and enjoyment of the benefits of growth and provide quality educational opportunities to its indigent but deserving constituents.\n\nOn June 22, 1972, the College was authorized to open the second year of the general education course and the one-year secretarial on a P35,100 city budget.\n\nOn June 7, 1973, the Secretary of Education approved the third year operation of the College with BS Industrial Education and the BS Business Technology appropriating therefore P36,760 (Mun. Ord. Nos. 2020 and 2140).\n\nOn March 25,1975, Ordinance No. 2295 provided for the charter of the renamed Caloocan City Polytechnic College. A fire gutted the High School PTA Building in 1984 forced the College to move to the nearby elementary school before transferring to the Sangandaan site. In June 1996, Buena Park and Camarin Annexes became operational, while Tandang Sora Annex at 7th avenue started classes in November, 2002. From an enrollment of 42 in 1971, the College had 3600 in 2000.\n\nIn June 1996, it offered two(2) masteral courses in public administration and in education. To make the College more responsive to the needs of City's constituents, government employees with 60 undergraduate units were enrolled as third year students in the special Bachelor in Public Administration in 1997.\n\nOn February 9, 2004, after 33 long years, Municipal Ordinance No. 0379 converted the Caloocan City Polytechnic College into the full-fledged University of Caloocan City.\n\nTo know more about UCC.
