A lawmaker has filed a bill to establish a branch campus of the Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) in Caloocan City. The bill's author, Rep. Oscar Malapitan, cited the rapidly growing population in Caloocan City and need to expand educational opportunities. PUP had previously approved establishing a campus in 1991 but it did not push through due to financial constraints. The new campus would give more residents access to higher education and help develop their skills and opportunities for economic progress. The bill aims to adhere to UNESCO's four pillars of education by providing learning opportunities to the community.",
