        "text": "CEU Faculty Member Wins Best Presenter in International Educators Conference\n\nCentro Escolar University faculty Mr. Raymund Peraltawas awarded Best Presenter for his research paper, \"Development and Evaluation of Course Management System with Short Messaging Service Notification” during the 4th International Educators Conference, held at Taipan Hotel in Bangkok, Thailand.\n\nThe study focuses on developing and evaluating a new, privately owned Course Management System with SMS notification for Centro Escolar University. The research utilized a developmental and descriptive survey design. The evaluation results indicated that faculty members were satisfied with the new course management system, giving it a highly acceptable rating across all criteria, including functional suitability, performance efficiency, compatibility, usability, reliability, security, and maintainability.\n\nOn the other hand, students rated the system as very acceptable for each criterion. The study suggests that while the system meets the needs of faculty members, improvements are needed to better address students' needs. Suggested enhancements include refining the user interface, adding features such as online quizzes and exams, facilitating communication through chat rooms, and improving security features like archiving deleted files and accounts of both students and faculty.\n\nFor more information about CEU, please visit the official website of the University at www.ceu.edu.ph.

The intensive five-day training program was organized by the Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines (IPOPHL), the government agency mandated to administer and implement State policies on intellectual property (IP) to strengthen the protection of IP rights in the country.\n\nAccording to IPOPHL, the annual IP Boost Camp is an intermediate-level program that aims to provide an opportunity for undergraduate students and law students to acquire a deeper knowledge of IP and IP-related areas to better prepare them in their respective career by boosting their competence and confidence on IP.\n\nStrong CEU Makati representation\n\nBelonging to Batch Maalab, Esponilla was joined by 13 fellow Legal Management students who participated in the camp. The group tackled a wide range of IP topics, including patents, trademarks, copyright, and other intellectual property rights.\n\nThe workshop covered key areas such as trademarks and digital economy trends, patent examination and industrial design, copyright and the creative industry, and IP enforcement and research.\n\nFollowing the intensive discussions, IPOPHL organized an IP Career Expo featuring intellectual property and human resources experts. Leading law firms, including ACCRALAW, Quisumbing Torres, Sycip Salazar Hernandez & Gatmaitan, Villaraza & Angangco, Kalaw, Prasad & Hofileña, MOSVELDTT Law, and Dennemeyer, shared their IP best practices with the campers. The expo provided students with valuable insights on the IP field and various career paths within the industry.\n\nThe IP Boost campers underwent rigorous training, workshop, application activities, and assessments before their graduation ceremony.\n\nFor more information about CEU, please visit the official website of the University at www.ceu.edu.ph.
