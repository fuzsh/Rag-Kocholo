        "text": "City Is Ready To Open\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWritten by Summer Jane Dasing\n\n“The road to success is always under construction.”\n\nA popular phrase that most of us encountered in our life but that won’t be the case for our future scholars as the new campus for the University of Caloocan City will soon open its doors to aspiring engineers.\n\nDetermined to offer the chance to cultivate and further develop the students’ expertise and skills, a total of 2,973.6 sq.m floor area is utilized for a four storey building and is constructed to have 10 classrooms, 2 Computer Rooms, and 2 Science Laboratories.\n\nMeanwhile, Cong. Oca Malapitan also shared and assured the public in the project overview that the building will feature a minimalist and modern architecture that will have clean lines, shapes and basic textures in which it is considered as a good strategy of learning as the atmosphere surrounding the facility is critical when it comes to the increase of students’ attention. Having a relaxed and calm mind is essential in order for the students to focus in their lectures in addition to their motivation to learn.\n\nThe UCC College of Engineering will offer Industrial Engineering, Electronics Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Computer Engineering programs. But hold on, there’s more, the new UCC extension will also offer business-related programs. Vice President for Administration, Engr. Wenald H. Lopez will serve as the Dean of the College of Engineering. It is set to open in academic year 2024-2025.\n\nOn the other hand, this incredible accomplishment would not have been possible without the efforts of the Caloocan Local Government Unit and the significant contribution of the project’s main asset, Puregold Inc., which will finance and cater all of the project’s expenses. Congressman Oca Malapitan shared and acknowledged his gratitude toward Puregold as the City Government’s partner in bringing this project to existence as a further sign of appreciation.\n\nThe groundbreaking ceremony for this campus happened on June 14, 2021 at Bagong Silang Phase 8A, Barangay 176, North Caloocan. The presence of the former Mayor Oscar Malapitan, now Congressman, as well as former Rep. Along Malapitan, now Mayor, UCC OIC Marilyn De Jesus, DPA, and other university officials had been recognized during the ceremony."
