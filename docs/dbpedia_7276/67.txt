In this update, I've added JQuery support, which includes an emulation of the following dock features:

* a "bounce" effect when you hover over a navigation icon

* a per-navigation icon translucent tooltip

I have also added two pseudo-buttons to distinctly show two important links: how to install Awn, and getting help for Awn.

I forgot to note in the last screenshot that the entire site is written using the HTML5 spec.
