Avant Window Navigator (Awn) is a Mac OS X like panel for the GNOME Desktop written in C. In addition to launchers that can be dragged onto the bar, it features a taskbar that behaves similarly to the Mac OS X dock. The window navigator uses the composite extension for transparency and other effects.

It can be used for anything from the launching of simple programs to complex multi-tasking. This application compares to The Mac OS X dock in functionality, allowing the user to specify its position on the screen.

The look and feel are fully customizable, and theming support is also available.

Features include:

Based on the workspace concept, but the space is two dimensional.

Customise the bar:

Choose between two ‘engines’:

Glass engine. All the gradients can be changed to your taste

Pattern engine.

The border & internal border colours can be changed.

The ‘glow’ (the background of an active window icon) can be changed, to be as simple or as lavish as you need.

Choose between sharp or rounded corners.

Choose the text & shadow colour of the window title text.

Each time you move to a new, unvisited workspace, a terminal window is automatically launched, emulating TTYs’ behavior.

Delete an entire workspace, killing all the window launched in it.

Delete an entire dimension, deleting all the residing workspaces.

Order windows on the fly.

Proc-like interface.

Launchers.

Task lists.

Plugins:

Music software: Audacious, Rhythmbox, Banshee, Exaile, Quod Libet, and Amarok.

Internet software: Deluge,Pidgin, XChat, and Epiphany.

Awn Extras provides a number of important applets (not unlike the panel applets for GNOME and Xfce) in a single package, along with a number of plugins that allow applications to better interface with Awn’s task manager. These applets range from a Trash applet to fancy workspace switcher.
