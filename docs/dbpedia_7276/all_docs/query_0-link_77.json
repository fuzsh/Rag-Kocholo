        "text": "You can make a quiz available to all your students before or after the due date by setting availability dates. Availability date settings can be used for both New Quizzes and Classic Quizzes.\n\nNote: If you are looking to change quiz dates for individual students, you can assign a quiz to an individual student or assign a quiz to a course section. Additionally, you may be able to edit due and availability dates for multiple quizzes at one time from the Assignments Index page.\n\nQuizzes have an autosubmit feature tied to the Until (lock) date, which may affect student submissions. Only quiz attempts that have been started are auto-submitted. Common quiz scenarios and date results include the following:\n\nNo dates: quiz is never marked late and autosubmitted at course conclude (see course settings)\n\nDue date only: quiz is marked late at Due date and autosubmitted at course conclude (see course settings)\n\nDue date with Until date: quiz is marked late at Due date and autosubmitted at Until date\n\nTime limit: quiz is autosubmitted when time expires. The time limit will still expire if a student navigates away from the quiz. The quiz will autosubmit when the student navigates to the quiz page again.\n\nTime limit with Until date: quiz is autosubmitted when time expires unless the Until date expires first\n\nStudent View\n\nWhen students view a quiz, they are able to see the details of the quiz. Quiz details do not show due and availability dates in relation to the current time. However, within the quiz, Canvas notifies students regarding any upcoming quiz deadlines:\n\nFor quizzes with a Due date, the browser displays a notification banner to let students know when the quiz will be marked late (30 minutes prior, 5 minutes prior, and 1 minute prior).\n\nFor quizzes that are close to autosubmitting (using an Until date or the natural course conclude date), the browser displays a notification banner to let students know when the quiz will autosubmit (30 minutes prior, 5 minutes prior, 1 minute prior, and 10 seconds prior).\n\nFor timed quizzes, the browser displays a notification banner if students are not able to complete the quiz in the full allotted time period. The quiz sidebar also displays a timer indicating how many minutes remain to complete the quiz. For example, if a 60-minute quiz has an Until date of 11:59 pm and a student begins the quiz at 11:30 pm, the student will only have 30 minutes to complete the quiz.\n\nOpen Quizzes\n\nIn Course Navigation, click the Quizzes link.\n\nAdd Quiz\n\nTo add a new quiz, click the Add Quiz button.\n\nSelect Quiz Engine\n\nIf your course has New Quizzes enabled, you must select a quiz engine.\n\nTo select New Quizzes, click the New Quizzes option [1].\n\nTo create a classic quiz, click the Classic Quizzes option [2].\n\nThen click the Submit button [3].\n\nNote: Learn more about creating a quiz using New Quizzes.\n\nEdit Quiz\n\nTo edit the settings of an existing quiz, locate the quiz [1]. Classic Quizzes display an empty Quiz icon [2]. New Quizzes display a filled quiz icon [3].\n\nTo edit the quiz, click the Options icon [4], and select the Edit option [5].\n\nSave Quiz\n\nClick the Save button.\n\nNote: If you edited an existing quiz, any saved changes will automatically be updated.\n\nView Quiz\n\nView the quiz and the dates you have made the quiz available to students."
