Clicking âacceptâ or your use of the Telenav Software indicates that you accept these terms and conditions. If you do not accept these terms and conditions, do not launch or otherwise use the Telenav Software.\n\nThese terms and conditions represent the agreement (âAgreementâ) between you and TeleNav Shanghai Inc. (âTelenavâ) with respect to the Telenav Software (including upgrades, modifications, or additions thereto) (collectively âTelenav Softwareâ). All references herein to âyouâ and âyourâ means you, your employees, agents, and contractors, and any other entity on whose behalf you accept these terms and conditions, all of whom shall also be bound by this Agreement. You agree to inform all drivers and passengers about the presence of the Telenav Software in the vehicle. Telenav may collect and process location information and navigation related data in order to provide the services to you. You also agree to obtain the agreement of any such other person(s) to all of the terms and conditions as set out in this document. Additionally, all of your account information, as well as other personal information provided by you to Telenav (directly or through the use of the Telenav Software), is subject to your vehicle manufacturerâs privacy policy located at https://ttap-id.soimt.com/TAP.Web/pages/policy.html. Telenav may revise this Agreement at any time, with or without notice to you. You agree to visit https://www.telenav.com/legal/terms/connected-nav-europe-s20 from time to time to review the then current version of this Agreement. Where this Agreement is provided bilingual in English and a local language, and in case there is a conflict between the English version and the local language version, the English version shall prevail.\n\n1. Safe and Lawful Use\n\nYou acknowledge that devoting attention to the Telenav Software may pose a risk of injury or death to you and others in situations that otherwise require your undivided attention, and you therefore agree to comply with the following when using the Telenav Software: (a) observe all traffic laws and otherwise drive safely; (b) use your own personal judgment while driving. If you feel that a route suggested by the Telenav Software instructs you to perform an unsafe or illegal maneuver, places you in an unsafe situation, or directs you into an area that you consider to be unsafe, do not follow such instructions; (c) do not input destinations, or otherwise manipulate the Telenav Software, unless your vehicle is stationary and parked; (d) do not use the Telenav Software for any illegal, unauthorized, unintended, unsafe, hazardous, or unlawful purposes, or in any manner inconsistent with this Agreement; (e) arrange all GPS and wireless devices and cables necessary for use of the Telenav Software in a secure manner in your vehicle so that they will not interfere with your driving and will not prevent the operation of any safety device (such as an airbag).\n\nYou agree to indemnify and hold Telenav harmless against all claims resulting from any dangerous or otherwise inappropriate use of the Telenav Software in any moving vehicle, including as a result of your failure to comply with the directions above.\n\n2. Account Information & Your Location and Search Information\n\nYou agree: (a) when registering the Telenav Software, to provide Telenav and your vehicle manufacturerâs group of companies (âSAICâ) with true, accurate, current, and complete information about yourself, your account and your vehicle, and (b) to keep such information true, accurate, current and complete.\n\nIn order to enable your use of the Telenav Software, Telenav may receive location and search information related to your use of the Telenav Software. In using the Telenav Software, you allow Telenav to obtain, use and share (as disclosed) this location and search information. Such information is subject to SAICâs Privacy Policy.\n\nIndividuals with inquiries or complaints regarding privacy matters should contact SAIC at Dpo@mgmotor.eu or they have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.\n\n3. Software License\n\nSubject to your compliance with the terms of this Agreement, Telenav hereby grants to you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable license (except as expressly permitted below in connection with your permanent transfer of the Telenav Software license), without the right to sublicense, to access and use the Telenav Software (in object code form only). This license shall terminate upon any termination or expiration of this Agreement. You agree that you will use the Telenav Software only for your personal business or leisure purposes, and not to provide commercial navigation services to other parties.\n\n3.1 License Limitations\n\nYou agree not to do any of the following: (a) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, translate, modify, alter or otherwise change the Telenav Software or any part thereof; (b) attempt to derive the source code, audio library or structure of the Telenav Software without the prior express written consent of Telenav; (c) remove from the Telenav Software, or alter, any of Telenavâs or its suppliersâ trademarks, trade names, logos, patent or copyright notices, or other notices or markings; (d) distribute, sublicense or otherwise transfer the Telenav Software to others, except as part of your permanent transfer of the Telenav Software; or (e) use or access the Telenav Software in any manner that: (i) infringes the intellectual property or proprietary rights, rights of publicity or privacy or other rights of any party, (ii) violates any law, statute, ordinance or regulation, including but not limited to laws and regulations related to spamming, privacy, consumer and child protection, obscenity or defamation, and all applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations, or (iii) is harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortuous, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, or otherwise objectionable; and (f) lease, rent out, or otherwise permit unauthorized access by third parties to the Telenav Software without advanced written permission of Telenav.\n\n4. Disclaimers\n\nExcept where prohibited by applicable law, in no event will Telenav, its licensors and suppliers, SAIC, or agents or employees of any of the foregoing, be liable for any decision made or action taken by you or anyone else in reliance on the information provided by the Telenav Software. Â Unless otherwise provided under applicable laws, Telenav and SAIC also do not warrant or condition the accuracy of the map or other data used for the Telenav Software. Such data may not always reflect reality due to, among other things, road closures, construction, weather, new roads and other changing conditions. Telenav and SAIC also do not warrant that your use of the Telenav Software will be uninterrupted or error-free. Rather, temporary interruptions of the Telenav Software may occur from time to time (such as when you drive into an area that has no network coverage or when the Telenav Software or your carrier's network is undergoing maintenance). Telenav will exercise reasonable efforts to attempt to limit or prevent such occurrences, but in no event will Telenav be liable for any financial or other damages due to such interruptions. You are responsible for the entire risk arising out of your use of the Telenav Software. Â For example, but without limitation, you agree not to rely on the Telenav Software for critical navigation in areas where the well-being or survival of you or others is dependent on the accuracy of navigation, as the maps or functionality of the Telenav Software are not intended to support such high-risk applications, especially in more remote geographical areas.\n\nEXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, TELENAV AND SAIC EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM AND EXCLUDE ALL WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE TELENAV SOFTWARE, WHETHER STATUTORY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ALL WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS WHICH MAY ARISE FROM COURSE OF DEALING, CUSTOM OR TRADE AND INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO THE TELENAV SOFTWARE. Certain jurisdictions do not permit the disclaimer of certain warranties, so this limitation may not apply to you.\n\n5. Limitation of Liability\n\nEXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL TELENAV OR ITS LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS OR SAIC BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (INCLUDING IN EACH CASE, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR THE INABILITY TO USE THE EQUIPMENT OR ACCESS DATA, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR THE LIKE) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE TELENAV SOFTWARE, EVEN IF TELENAV HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. Â\n\nEXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY DAMAGES THAT YOU MIGHT INCUR FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL DAMAGES REFERENCED HEREIN AND ALL DIRECT OR GENERAL DAMAGES IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE), THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF TELENAV AND OF ALL OF TELENAVâS SUPPLIERS AND OF SAIC SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU FOR THE TELENAV SOFTWARE. Â SOME PROVINCES, STATES AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n6. Arbitration and Governing Law\n\nYou agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Telenav Software shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the said Rules. The seat of the arbitration will be Berlin, Germany, and it will be conducted in the English language. Note that there is no judge or jury in an arbitration proceeding and the decision of the arbitrator shall be binding upon both parties. You expressly agree to waive your right to a jury trial.\n\nThis Agreement and performance hereunder will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Germany, without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions. To the extent judicial action is necessary in connection with the binding arbitration, both Telenav and you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Berlin, Germany. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply.\n\n7. Assignment\n\nYou may not resell, assign, or transfer this Agreement or any of your rights or obligations, except in totality, in connection with your permanent transfer of the Telenav Software, and expressly conditioned upon the new user of the Telenav Software agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Any such sale, assignment or transfer that is not expressly permitted under this paragraph will result in immediate termination of this Agreement, without liability to Telenav, in which case you and all other parties shall immediately cease all use of the Telenav Software. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Telenav may assign this Agreement to any other party at any time without notice, provided the assignee remains bound by this Agreement.\n\n8. Miscellaneous\n\n8.1 This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Telenav and you with respect to the subject matter hereof.\n\n8.2 Except for the limited licenses expressly granted in this Agreement, Telenav retains all right, title and interest in and to the Telenav Software, including without limitation all related intellectual property rights. No licenses or other rights which are not expressly granted in this Agreement are intended to, or shall be, granted or conferred by implication, statute, inducement, estoppel or otherwise, and Telenav and its suppliers and licensors hereby reserve all of their respective rights other than the licenses explicitly granted in this Agreement.\n\n8.3 By using the Telenav Software, you consent to receive from Telenav all communications, including notices, agreements, legally required disclosures or other information in connection with the Telenav Software (collectively, âNoticesâ) electronically. Telenav may provide such Notices by posting them on Telenavâs Website or by downloading such Notices to your wireless device. If you desire to withdraw your consent to receive Notices electronically, you must discontinue your use of the Telenav Software.\n\n8.4 Telenavâs or your failure to require performance of any provision shall not affect that partyâs right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor shall a waiver of any breach or default of this Agreement constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.\n\n8.5 If any provision herein is held unenforceable, then such provision will be modified to reflect the intention of the parties, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.\n\n8.6 The headings in this Agreement are for convenient reference only, will not be deemed to be a part of this Agreement, and will not be referred to in connection with the construction or interpretation of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the words âincludeâ and âincluding,â and variations thereof, will not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather will be deemed to be followed by the words âwithout limitation.â\n\n9. Other Vendors Terms and Conditions\n\nThe Telenav Software utilizes map and other data licensed to Telenav by third party vendors for the benefit of you and other end users. This Agreement includes end-user terms applicable to these companies (included at the end of this Agreement), and thus your use of the Telenav Software is also subject to such terms. You agree to comply with the following additional terms and conditions, which are applicable to Telenavâs third party vendor licensors. Such terms and conditions can be found here: https://www.telenav.com/legal/terms/connected-nav-europe-s20\n\n9.1 End User Terms Required by HERE Europe B.V.\n\nThe data (âDataâ) is provided for your personal, internal use only and not for resale.

The Data may contain inaccurate or incomplete information due to the passage of time, changing circumstances, sources used and the nature of collecting comprehensive geographic data, any of which may lead to incorrect results.\n\nNo Warranty.

Geos\n\nLicensed under GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\nVersion 2.1, February 1999\n\nCopyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n\n51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA Â 02110-1301 Â USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nA \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\nThe \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n\"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n1) You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n2) You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\nâ¢a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\nâ¢b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\nâ¢c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\nâ¢d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n\n3) You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.\n\nOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\nThis option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n4) You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\nIf distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n5) A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\nHowever, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\nWhen a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\nIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n\nOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\n6) As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.\n\nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:\n\nâ¢a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)\n\nâ¢b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\nâ¢c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\nâ¢d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.\n\nâ¢e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\nFor an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\n\nIt may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.\n\n7) You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\nâ¢a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.\n\nâ¢b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n8) You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n9) You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.\n\n10) Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n11) If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n12) If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n13) The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n14) If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n15) BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n16) IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n8.

Peter Deutsch, sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA. ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally, that you must include source code if you redistribute it. Â (See the file ansi2knr.c for full details.) Â However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than the foregoing paragraphs do.\n\nThe Unix configuration script \"configure\" was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, ltmain.sh). Â Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium but is also freely distributable.\n\nThe IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce \"uncompressed GIFs\". Â This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.\n\nWe are required to state that \"The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of CompuServe Incorporated.

ByÂ using informationÂ made available under this licence,Â youÂ accept the terms and conditions set forth in this licence. As set out in Section 7, theÂ licensorÂ disclaims any and all liability for the quality of theÂ information and what theÂ informationÂ isÂ usedÂ for.\n\nThis licence shall not impose any limitations on the rights or freedoms of theÂ licenseeÂ under the Norwegian Freedom of Information Act or any other legislation granting the general public a right of access to public sector information, or that follow from exemptions or limitations stipulated in the Norwegian Copyright Act. Further, the licence shall not impose any limitations on theÂ licensee'sÂ freedom of expression recognized by law.\n\n1.

The informationÂ may be used in any medium and format known today and/or which will become known in the future. TheÂ LicenseeÂ shall not sub-license or transfer this licence.\n\n3. Exemptions\n\nThe licence does not apply to and therefore does not grant a right toÂ use:\n\n* informationÂ which contains personal data covered by the Norwegian Personal Data Act unless there is a legitimate basis for the disclosure and further processing of the personal data\n\n* informationÂ distributed in violation of a statutory obligation to observe confidentiality\n\n* informationÂ excluded from public disclosure pursuant to law, including information deemed sensitive under the Norwegian National Security Act\n\n* informationÂ subject to third party rights which theÂ licensorÂ is not authorised to license to theÂ licensee\n\n* informationÂ protected by intellectual property rights other than copyright and neighbouring rights in accordance with Chapter 5 of the Norwegian Copyright Act, such as trademarks, patents and design rights, but this does not entail an impediment to useÂ informationÂ where theÂ licensor'sÂ logo has been permanently integrated into theÂ informationÂ or to attribute the origin of the informationÂ in accordance with the article below relating to attribution.\n\nIf theÂ licensorÂ has made availableÂ informationÂ not covered by the licence according to the above list, theÂ licenseeÂ must cease allÂ useÂ of theÂ informationÂ under the licence, and erase theÂ informationÂ as soon as he or she becomes aware of or should have understood that theÂ informationÂ is not covered by the licence.\n\n4. Effects of breach of the licence\n\nThe licence is subject to theÂ licensee'sÂ compliance with the terms and conditions of this licence. In the event that theÂ licenseeÂ commits a breach of this licence, this will entail that theÂ licensee'sÂ right toÂ useÂ the informationÂ will be revoked immediately without further notice. In case of such a breach, theÂ licenseeÂ must immediately and without further notice take measures to cause the infringement to end. Because the right toÂ useÂ theÂ informationÂ has been terminated, theÂ licenseeÂ must cease allÂ useÂ of theÂ informationÂ by virtue of the licence.\n\n5.

Guarantees regarding data quality and accessibility\n\nThis licence does not prevent theÂ licensorÂ from issuing supplementary statements regarding expected or intended data quality and accessibility. Such statements shall be regarded as indicative in nature and not binding on the part of theÂ licensor. The disclaimers in Section 7 also apply in full for such indicative statements. Based on separate agreement, theÂ licensorÂ may provide guarantees and distribute the informationÂ on terms and conditions different from those set forth in this licence.\n\n9. Licence compatibility\n\nIf theÂ licenseeÂ is to distribute an adapted or combined work based onÂ informationÂ covered by this licence and some other work licensed under aÂ licence compatible by contract, such distribution may be based on an appropriateÂ licence compatible by contract, cf. the list below.\n\nAÂ licenceÂ compatible by contractÂ shall mean the following licences:\n\n* for allÂ information:Â Open Government Licence (version 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0), Creative Commons Attribution Licence (international version 4.0 and norwegian version 4.0),\n\n* for those parts of theÂ informationÂ which do not constituteÂ databases: Creative Commons Attribution Licence (generic version 1.0, 2.0, 2.5 and unported version 3.0) and Creative Commons Navngivelse 3.0 Norge,\n\n* for those parts of theÂ informationÂ which constituteÂ databases: Open Data Commons Attribution License (version 1.0).\n\nThis provision does not prevent other licences from being compatible with this licence based on their content.\n\n10. New versions of the licence\n\nTheÂ licenseeÂ may choose to use theÂ informationÂ covered by this licence under any new versions of the Norwegian licence for Open Government data (NLOD) issued by the responsible ministry (currently the Ministry of Local Government and Modernisation) when these versions are final and official, unless theÂ licensorÂ when making theÂ informationÂ available under this licence specifically has stated that solely version 2.0 of this licence may be used.\n\n11. Governing law and legal venue\n\nThis licence, including its formation, and any disputes and claims arising in connection with or relating to this licence, shall be regulated by Norwegian law.
