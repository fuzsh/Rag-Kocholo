        "text": "This piece by Bob Ostertag was originally published at On The Commons. We’re reprinting it here because it’s a great description of exactly how distribution networks are still strongly weighted against free-as-in-freedom. The cost of maintaining the monopoly sidewalk is that freedom can grow only in the cracksÂ âÂ and the increasingly eager auto-detection bots keep “repairing” the cracks, because their masters only see the value of the sidewalk. Bob is an active performing and recording musician, and a long-time friend of QuestionCopyright.org (he was one of our founding Board members). His biography is at the end of this article.\n\nWe of course hope Bob makes plenty of money from A Book of Hours on CDÂ BabyÂ âÂ there’s no contradiction between freedom-friendly licensing and making money! And yes, we recognize the contradiction between his original Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial licensing and the freedom of other artists to pursue the same strategy Bob describes below while incorporating his music in their works. In the usual QCO so-transparent-it’s-kind-of-edgy fashion, we’ll discuss this with Bob and see if he’s open to using truly free licensing while still selling his music on CDBaby and similar sites [Update 2013-08: He was, and we’re now working with him to relicense his music under free licenses wherever possible.]. But the outcome of that conversation doesn’t affect his message below, which is that right now freedom is much harder work than it needs to be, because the major distribution networks still regard it as a weed, and because the few distributors that prioritize a direct audience-artist financial connection are small and don’t have the cloutÂ âÂ yetÂ âÂ to change how the sidewalks are maintained.\n\nWhy I No Longer Give Away My Music\n\nHow the digital music biz makes it difficult for musicians to offer free downloads\n\nIn 2006 I gave my music away. That music had previously existed on CDs and LPs (yes, I began making music in the days of vinyl and tape). I moved all of it to the Web, downloadable for free.\n\nToday, seven years later, I see that giving away music for free is not as easy as I had imagined. In some ways, it turns out to be impossible. The reasons why this is so say a lot about creativity,property, and power in a networked world of corporately owned digital commons policed by netbots and stochastic algorithms.\n\nMy music is now available under a Creative Commons âAttribution-Non Commercial 2.5 License,â which allows anyone to download it, copy it, remix it, slice and dice it, and so on. They just canât sell it, or profit from it. If they incorporate it into music of their own, they should note that they did so, and since they used my music as their source material for free, they should not charge for their music either.\n\nBut thatâs all just words. In the real world, I have no resources with which to enforce those conditions. And as we shall see, the problems I have encountered in this endeavor have been entirely in another direction.\n\nDeciding to do this was the easy part, since the ârecord businessâ never worked for me in the first place. This was no big surprise, as the record business never worked for most musicians. What is surprising is how many musicians seem either to not know this or to have forgotten it.\n\nThe whole structure of the industry put corporate interests first, musician interests a distant second. Actually, this is not quite true. The biggest stars get taken care of pretty well. Lady Gaga should have no complaints. But many people would be shocked to know how many bands whose names they know and CDs they bought never saw any money from those sales. For musicians like myself making ânon-commercialâ music which does not fit easily any any genre or marketable category, the situation was hopeless from the start.\n\nMy income comes from concerts, not recordings (I have performed internationally since 1978). For most of my audience, before the Internet came along just finding my recordings was a major undertaking. Concerts in various parts of the world were often attended by people who travelled long distances to get to the show, hoping to find some recording for sale which they had heard about but were never able to find.\n\nEnter the Internet. Suddenly, world-wide âdistributionâ of audio recordings â which had formerly required an infrastructure of pressing plants, trucks, ships, planes, warehouses, retail shops, accountants, lawyers, and more â became instantly available to everyone at the push of a button.\n\nWho needs the ârecord businessâ? What was a difficult, tentative, and ultimately impossible decision for big name groups like Radiohead was a no-brainer for me. I wrote an essay called The Professional Suicide of a Recording Musician that was widely read and commented upon. I was invited on to the board of a non-profit called Question Copyright, which is all about trying to create a real digital commons.\n\nThe first thing that happened after âfreeingâ my music was that people began to access it in far greater numbers than previously possible. My first release to bypass the CD stage and go directly to the Internet for free download, w00t, was downloaded about 40,000 times. And the total downloads of all my recordings has gone well over 100,000. (Since numerous sites now offer my music for downloading I do not have an accurate total).\n\nBut I have learned that âaccessingâ music and actually listening to it are two different things. Free downloading has created a kind of collector or hoarder who is unique to the digital age. In my university classes, I query my students about their downloading habits, and everyone who is deeply into music has figured out how to download music for free, despite the best efforts of the record business to stop them, and have far, far more music downloaded to their laptops and iPods than they will ever have time to listen to in their entire lives. Gigabytes and gigabytes of meaningless data. These same students invariably report that they have actually listened to all the music they paid for.\n\nIf a virtual tree falls in a virtual forest and no one opens the file, does it still make a sound? This is a real conundrum. If by âcommonsâ we mean, say, communally owned pastures in England, we are talking about finite resources that were valued as such and cared for accordingly by the surrounding community. But if by âcommonsâ we mean a vast expanse of server farms that seems capable of expanding without meaningful limit, then we are speaking of something very different. Have I cheapened my music by not monetizing its recorded artifact?\n\nFor most people for whom new music is an important part of their lives, however, the most relevant commons has become iTunes, Spotify, Pandora and so on â Web sites that allow the user to begin from their favorite music and then link outwards to music that has been somehow identified as similar. College kids and fanatical collectors might work late into the night figuring out how to get their files for free, but for most people, the sites listed above are the main way they discover new music. And these sites do not accept music that is free. They are all about making money. By giving away my music for free, I seem to have shut myself out of the new âcommonsâ.\n\nThe Mysterious Case of the Missing Copyright\n\nJacques Sirot is an independent French artist and film-maker. He used my music as the soundtrack for one of his recent films, as I have made clear he (and everyone else) is free to do. Making sure to dot every i and cross every t, when he posted his film on YouTube he noted: This Creative Commons film uses Bob Ostertagâs music, Say No More, which is distributed with a Creative Commons license; its usage has moreover been personally agreed by the musician.\n\nYet soon after the film was posted, it was blocked for copyright violation, with a notice that âit may have content that is owned or licensed by IODA [Independent Online Distribution Alliance].â Jacques appealed:\n\nâThis video contains elements protected by rights of the author in question, but with the appropriate license or written authorization of the holder of those rights. Bob Ostertag was notified of this use of his music (which he distributes via âCreative Commonsâ) and granted his authorization. I believe in good faith that the claims described above are not valid, and that I hold the necessary rights to the contents of my video, for reasons cited. I have not knowingly made a false declaration and am not voluntarily using this contestation procedure in an abusive manner to undermine third party rights. I understand that the forwarding of fraudulent contestations can lead to the closure of my YouTube account.â\n\nHe received the following reply:\n\nDear Jacques Sirot,\n\nIODA has reviewed your dispute and reinstated its copyright claim on your video, âTSUNAMIâ. For more information, please visit your Copyright Notice page.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nThe YouTube Team\n\nWorking with scholar Sally-Jane Norman, Jaques spent considerable time researching the matter, and eventually contacted me, and I spent hours more looking into it. Finally I figured out what had happened.\n\nYears back, I released some CDs on Seeland, a label run by the notorious media guerrilla group Negativland. Negativland was famously sued for a parody of a song by U2, which made them into icons of free expression and resistance to absurd claims about the reach of copyright. I had left their label years ago when I put my music under the free Creative Commons license. As is often the case with tiny, underfunded labels, there had been a disagreement about accounting, with the Negativland people arguing I owed them money for unsold CDs that were returned by stores. Just the sort of thing that led me to give up on small labels and give away my music. Well, it turned out that, without informing me, Seeland had continued to collect royalties on that music in an effort to recoup what they claimed to be their losses. Through a byzantine circuit of contracts and enforcements, the banishment of Jacques Sirotâs video from YouTube for copyright violation, for using my music which I had given him and everyone else explicit permission to use, was the result of a secret account collecting royalties on my music operated by a label that had built its reputation on resistance to overblown copyright claims!\n\nKanye West vs. Etienne Noreau-Hebert\n\nThere are some Web sites, like YouTube, SoundCloud and BandCamp, which are set up to allow free music and video sharing. But even these are problematic. They are policed by ânetbots,â software algorithms that constantly search for sounds allegedly owned by someone or other. My friend Etienne Noreau-Hebert recently uploaded a new work to SoundCloud, to share with others for free, and received back the following reply:\n\nOur automatic content protection system has detected that your sound â121223-Muhamarra-v0.3â may contain the following copyright content: âLove Lockdown (as made famous by Kanye West)â by Future Hit Makers Of America, owned by Big Eye Music. As a result, its publication on your profile has been blocked.\n\nKanye West, of course, is a major figure in the world of corporate hip hop, with megahit records, movies, a fashion line, and more than 30 million paid digital downloads of his songs. Etienne is an unknown musician making abstract electronic music he would like to share with others for free. There is nothing in his music that sounds even remotely like Kanye West. But some netbot has judged that Etienne has infringed on Kanyeâs rights, and so Etienneâs composition is banned from SoundCloud. Perhaps there is someone at SoundCloud to whom Etienne could appeal, if he dug through their web site, sent the emails, waited through various levels of phone robots, etc. Perhaps not. But Etienne is giving away his music for free. Where is he going to get all that time? Or rather, he is trying unsuccessfully to give away his music for free.\n\nLittle guys like Etienne are not the only victims of netbot police. The YouTube live stream of Michelle Obamaâs speech during the last Democratic Convention was suddenly shut down midsentence by YouTubeâs âpreemptive content filters,â leaving viewers staring at a black screen with text informing them that: This video contains content from WMG, SME, Associated Press (AP), UMG, Dow Jones, New York Times Digital, The Harry Fox Agency, Inc. (HFA), Warner Chappel, UMPG Publishing and EMI Music Publishing, one or more of whom have blocked it in your country on copyright grounds.\n\nIf you want to know who rules the roost on the Internet, that list would be a good place to start. A live webcast of the Hugo Awards for science fiction writers was blocked when a netbot ruled that the stream was showing copyrighted film clips. This was true, but the Hugo Awards had secured permission to use them. No one told the netbots. YouTubeâs âpreemptive content filtersâ repeatedly blocked footage from NASAâs Curiosity rover Mars landing, even though the images are in the public domain.\n\nMusic for Almost Free\n\nMy newest work is A Book of Hours, featuring the extraordinary vocal talents of Shelly Hirsch, Phil Minton, and Theo Bleckman, as well as saxophone legend Roscoe Mitchell. I have decided not to give this one away, but to use a relatively new service with the unlikely name of CDBaby. CDBaby will host the files for download on their site, with all the now-standard ability to share, comment, and so on. But more importantly, they will place the music on iTunes, Pandora, Spotify, and so on. I have to pay them for this service, and they will not accept my work unless I charge for it. I have chosen a very low amount: $1.99 for nearly an hour of music. All my previous works will remain available on my web site for free.\n\nIn a way this feels like a retreat from the across-the-board music-for-free stance I have taken for the last seven years. But really I am just trying to keep my head above water in the digital deluge.\n\nBob Ostertagâs newest work, A Book of Hours, can be purchased here at CDÂ Baby\n\nAbout Bob Ostertag\n\nComposer, performer, historian, instrument builder, journalist, activist, kayak instructor, Bob Ostertag has published 21 CDs of music, two movies, two DVDs, and three books.

They didn’t print it, alasÂ âÂ don’t worry, we’ll keep trying with other piecesÂ âÂ but we still think its message is important, so we’re publishing it here.]\n\nIn the last weeks of 2012, Dr. Oliver Sacks published a memorable essay in the New York Times Book Review, “Reading the Fine Print”, about how fewer and fewer books are being made available in large-print editions, and how this matters more and more to him as his vision deteriorates.\n\nLet’s stop to ask: Why are they not available? Who or what, exactly, is behind this scarcity?\n\nSacks’s essay does not contain the word “copyright”. He looks everywhere else, attributing the decline of large-print editions to the rise of audiobooks (which he dislikes because they are a less engaging experience) and of digital reading devices like the Nook and the Kindle (which are difficult for him to use). After visiting the ravaged large-print section of the Strand bookstore in New York, he writes: “I came out frustrated, and furious: did publishers think the visually impaired were intellectually impaired too?”\n\nThis is the closest he comes to identifying the real cause of the problem, a cause entirely of our own making. If there is a ready demand for large-print booksÂ âÂ and there isÂ âÂ then what can the explanation be, in a free market, for the steadily shrinking supply?\n\nThe answer, of course, is that we do not have a free market in books. We have a monopoly-controlled market: if the copyright holder decides not to offer a large-print edition, then those who need such an edition are out of luck. It does not matter that the readers would happily subsidize the print runs themselves, Kickstarter-style; it does not matter that many smaller and specialty publishers would gladly step into the gap to supply what the big players have decided isn’t worth the effort; it does not matter that on-demand print services would eagerly make large-print texts available in an instant, bound and ready to ship, if only they were allowed to. The system we use now does not permit any of these bottom-up solutions to happen at sustainable scale, because in a world where we’ve just built a gigantic, globe-spanning, low-cost copying machineÂ âÂ the InternetÂ âÂ we have also elected to keep, and indeed tighten, a monopolistic distribution system originally designed to regulate printing presses in the late seventeenth century.\n\nThat word “monopoly” shouldn’t be controversial. We’re used to hearing it about things like liquor distributorships in pliant jurisdictions, or energy utilities that successfully legislate competition out of the way. But if the word applies to anything, it surely applies to copyright: a government-enforced right to be the sole supplier of a text, song, etc, including the right to dictate which formats and which distribution channels copies and variants may circulate in. You’d think we’d be fairly cautious in handing out such a power, but instead in recent decades the monopoly lobby (to be fair, the sound recording and movie industries took the lead, more than the book publishers) have gotten it extended far beyond its original scope, both in terms of its per-work duration and of its censoring powers.\n\nOnce you start to see it as a policy choice, rather than as a law of natureÂ âÂ the latter being how that lobby would prefer you to think of itÂ âÂ all sorts of phenomena begin to look different. It’s not just about large-print editions. Do you have any idea how many translations are suppressed because rights cannot be negotiated? How many audio books are not recorded because the sole rights-holder couldn’t be interested enough to do it themselves, yet is still willing to prevent anyone else from doing it? Did you know that neither the FDA nor private-sector patient protection organizations can review crucial software code in medical devices, because the manufacturers assert copyright and refuse to circulate the code?\n\nFor that matter, should George Lucas be the only person in the world who can make Star Wars movies, no matter how badly he botches them? The issue is not that Lucas shouldn’t be free to make any movie he wants, it’s that the pernicious nature of monopoly, and of the “get permission first” culture it creates, means there is not true competition in the market: no one else is free to try and do better.\n\nThe industry’s response to this would be, as it has been for centuries, that it is the only way to pay authors. This is laughable. The system was not designed to pay authors and mostly does a lousy job of that. It was really designed to subsidize, and to a lesser degree regulate, distributors, which it accomplishes very wellÂ âÂ otherwise they would not argue so regularly and noisily for its expansion.\n\nThere’s no shortage of concrete recommendations to improve the situation. My organization is but one of many calling for us to step back from the brink and return to treating culture as something people don’t need permission to participate in. For starters: bring back registration requirements and renewals; require a fee to maintain a monopoly license; distinguish attribution law from copying law (their current conflation is both the result and the servant of the monopolist’s cause); do away with retroactive extensions, retroactively; shorten copyright terms; etc.\n\nBut what we need first is a fundamental change in how we think about copyright. It is not a natural law, nor is it even rooted in the common-law doctrine of property ownership. It is a monopoly created by statute, with only the purposes and powers given to it by statute. If it’s not doing what most people want it to do, we can and should fix it, without sentimental and historically suspect notions that a three-century old industrial regulation is somehow the shield of the artist. Indeed, the current system hurts artists perhaps most of all.\n\nThere are signs that the dam is starting to break. Recently, a researcher with the Republican Study Committee circulated a position paperÂ [1] that said nothing more shocking than what I’ve said above: that copyright is a monopoly-based policy, that it should ideally be shaped toward the public good with all assumptions on the table for inspection, that such reconsideration has not yet happened, and that a party that wants to be in tune with younger voters and with future trends would do well to start looking at the issue with fresh eyes. Such is the strength of the Hollywood lobby that those ideas would have been unthinkable for a major party researcher to produce even a few years ago. Apparently they are still pretty edgy, because the position paper was immediately disavowed by the RSC and the researcher, Derek Khanna, was fired shortly thereafter. But he was right, and I hope Oliver Sacks is reading a large-print version of his paper right now.\n\n[1] We originally referred to Derek Khanna’s paper for the Republican Study Committee as a “draft”, but since then have learned that it was not merely a draftÂ âÂ it was a finalized position paper, later retracted. Techdirt has more about the incident, and Khanna’s paper itself is here: Three Myths about Copyright Law and Where to Start to Fix It.\n\nQCO Artist-in-Residence Nina Paley’s interview with at Baixa Cultura, conducted by email with journalist and photographer AndrÃ© Solnik. The English below is the original; Baixa Cultura translated Nina’s answers.\n\n1. When your interest on free culture has begun?\n\nFor a long time I thought copyright terms were too long and the law could use reform, but I didn’t really understand Free Culture until October 2008, after months on the film festival circuit with my then-illegal feature Sita Sings the Blues. Free Culture was too audacious a concept for me to think about clearly until then. One morning I finally got itÂ âÂ freeing my work would be better for the workÂ âÂ and I spent the next half-year preparing for a Free, legal release of SSTB. That finally happened in March 2009, when I finally cleared all the necessary (and bullshit) licenses at a cost of about $70,000 to myself.\n\n2. Tell me in short why artists should free their work. Is it a good choice for both renowned and new artists?\n\nFrom my article How To Free Your Work:\n\nWhy should you Free your work? To make it as easy as possible for people to share your work â as easy as possible for your work to reach eyeballs and ears and minds â to reach an audience. And to make it as easy as possible for audience support â including money â to reach you…. Copy restrictions place a barrier between you, the artist, and most forms of support. By removing the barriers of copyright, you make it possible to receive money and other kinds of support from your audience, both directly and through distributors, thereby increasing your chances of success.\n\n3. Creative Commons has recently released the final draft of the version 4.0 of its licenses. What changes would you like to see? Do you think CC should keep on supporting the nonfree licenses?\n\nYes, CC should stop supporting the non-free licenses. What kind of “commons” is that?\n\n4. Although they are probably the most known alternatives to more restrictive ones, they still remain unpopular compared to the âall rights reservedâ. Why is that? Do you reckon people get confused by the many possibilities given by the CC licenses?\n\nMost people who use CC licenses don’t understand what the different licenses mean; they just call all of them “Creative Commons” as if that means anything. CC’s modular system was a good idea, I see it as an experiment that was worth doing. But the results are in: it didn’t work. What we have now are a mess of incompatible licenses, most of which fail to contribute to any real “commons,” and an increase of confusion and misinformation.\n\nYou can’t really blame Creative Commons thoughÂ âÂ the problem is copyright law. Nothing can fix it at this point. Even CC-0, a valorous attempt to opt out of copyright, doesn’t work in practice, as my experience with the Film Board of Canada showedÂ âÂ even after placing SSTB under CC-0, their lawyers refused to accept it was really Public Domain, and made me sign a release anyway, just to allow one of their filmmakers to refer to it. I will be saddled forever with permissions paperwork even with CC-0. I’ll probably keep using CC-0, of course, but I have no expectation it will work as it’s supposed to.\n\n5. The BY-NC-SA license, although nonfree, itâs pretty popular. Why do you think so? What are the main issues about licensing a work using it?\n\nPeople are high-minded when they choose the -NC restriction, but it accomplishes exactly the opposite of their ideals. They want to “protect” their works from abusive exploitation from big corporate players. They don’t realize those big corporate players LOVE the -NC clause, because it’s a commercial monopoly. Big corporate players are all set up to deal with commercial monopolies: they have licensing departments and lawyers. It’s the big corporate players who can afford to license your -NC works. It’s your peers, small players with no legal departments and limited resources, who can’t. The -NC clause screws over your fellow artists and small players, while favoring big corporations.\n\nThe way to avoid abusive exploitation is to use CC-BY-SA, a Share-Alike license without the -NC restriction. This allows your peers to use the work without fear, as long as they keep it Free-as-in-Freedom. Big corporate monopoly players, however, are unwilling to release anything Freely: if they want to use your work, they’ll have to negotiate a waiver of the -SA clause. For this they will pay money. It works like a regular licensing deal: for $X you waive the -SA restriction and allow them to re-use the work without contributing to the community. I have had many corporate licensors offer me such contracts, although I didn’t sign any because I was such a Free license booster.\n\nThe only reason BY-NC-SA is popular is because people really haven’t thought it through.\n\n6. Money seems to be one of the main worries artists have when they hear someone saying âfree your workâ. Is this âfearâ justified? Have you recovered all the money spent in the making of Sita Sings the Blues?\n\nNo, this fear is not justified. But your question sure is biased: “Have you recovered all the money spent in the making of Sita Sings the Blues?” As if with copyright I would have! I have made more money with Freeing my work than I ever did with copyright restrictions. Period. Where do people get this idea that putting a Â© on something will magically generate money? It doesn’t. If it did, I would fully support copyright, and be rich. Copyright is a “right to exclude,” not a right to make money. You are free to make money without copyright, and you stand a better chance to as well.\n\n7. You have recently announced that SSTB is now in the public domain. Although now you are finally free of burocracy envolving copyright stuff and this action could help your movie to have more visibility, on the other side it could favour restricted modifications of your work (e.g.: a book inspired by SSTB released under âall rights reservedâ). How do you weigh these two sides?\n\nEh, honestly I just don’t care any more. Let’s just put it out there and see what happens. If something terrible happens because I shared freely, I’ll learn from that. But I think it’s stupid to worry about what other people do, and try to control it, especially with broken laws. Even Free Share-Alike licenses require copyright law to be enforced, and copyright law is hopelessly broken. I don’t want to validate or support it in any way.\n\nLicenses are not going to fix our problems. What is fixing our problems is increasing numbers of people simply ignoring copyright altogether. Instead of trying to get people to pay more attention to the law, as CC does, I’d rather encourage them to ignore the law in favor of focusing on the art. Licenses are the wrong solution. Art is the solution. Make art not law.\n\n8. Are you keen on the free software movement as well? Any of your works was made using free softwares?\n\nI’m attending the 2013 Libre Graphics Meeting in Madrid this year, to discuss building a good Free vector animation tool I can actually use. More in this article, It’s 2013. Do You Know Where My Free Vector Animation Software Is?"
