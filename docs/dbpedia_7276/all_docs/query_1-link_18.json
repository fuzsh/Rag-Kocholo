        "text": "Why do I need a font license?\n\nFont licensing is not the most glamorous aspect of typography. When people think about type, they typically think about serifs and swashes, and all of the personality and emotion a well-drawn typeface can deliver.\n\nHowever, not everyone realizes thattypeface designs and the font software that generates those designs are entitled to intellectual property protection. Each font file is a separate piece of software that needs to be properly licensed.\n\nFonts are made by the human hand, painstakingly drawn over months or sometimes years, and engineered to perform perfectly. This is what you’re paying for when you license a font: Not just the letters on the screen, but the time and care the designer put into it, often the result of a lifelong dedication to the craft.\n\nSo while font licenses may be unglamorous, it is nevertheless important to understand the basics of how they work. They are your gateway to the world of letters and everything we love about typography. So let’s dig in!\n\nFrequently Asked Questions.\n\n01\n\nDo I need separate font licenses for different uses?\n\nYes. Even if your brand only uses one typeface (let’s say, Futura Now), the font software must be licensed for the different environments where it will be used.\n\nMonotype offers a few basic font license types, each pertaining to a different form of font usage:\n\nDesktop licenses allow you to install fonts on computers for use in print or static image formats.\n\nWebfont licenses allow you to embed fonts into websites.\n\nDigital ad licenses allow you to use fonts in emails and HTML5 digital ads.\n\nEmbedded licenses let you distribute fonts as part of physical products like medical devices and cars, as well as in software programs.\n\nApplication licenses allow you to embed fonts in phone/tablet apps and SaaS products.\n\nePub licenses cover font usage in commercial publications.\n\nServer licenses allow non-licensed desktop users to use fonts on company platforms, such as variable or prepress-based print and digital proofs and editing. They include both commercial and non-commercial uses. Other common uses include automated marketing services (CMS), SaaS-based print-on-demand, and dynamic digital signage.\n\n02\n\nCan I use a desktop license on my website?\n\nNo. A typical desktop license allows you to install the font on your computer for use in design programs like InDesign. Web font licenses will enable you to embed that font in the code for a website. So, whereas you might use a desktop license to create a static image (like a .jpeg) you upload to your website, a web font license facilitates the implementation of the font in the actual code of your website.\n\n03\n\nOnce I license a font, can I share it with as many people as I want?\n\nNot exactly. Most EULAs limit the number of “seats” or “workstations” allowed, aka the number of times it can be shared. If you need to share a font widely (for example, if you have a huge creative team), you can include that in your initial license agreement. If your needs change, you can also purchase additional licenses to add seats or workstations. Consider purchasing Monotype’s company desktop license, which is designed for modern workflows and a more flexible desktop licensing approach.\n\n04\n\nBonus: What is the difference between a typeface and a font?\n\nAlthough the terms “font” and “typeface” are often used interchangeably, they do not, in fact, mean the same thing. “Typeface” refers to the design—the actual appearance of the letters, numerals, punctuation, and other symbols—while a font is the physical embodiment of the typeface, whether it’s a case of metal type or a computer file. More simply, a font is what you license and use, and a typeface is what you see.\n\nA typeface is usually grouped together in a family containing individual fonts for a range of styles, including thin, light, regular italic, bold, condensed, and other variations of the primary design. Individuals and brands can license a single font, the whole family, or any selection of fonts from a typeface.\n\nQuick note from the Monotype legal department: The information included here pertains to Monotype font licenses only. Other foundries may have unique requirements or restrictions in their contracts. Always read your licensing agreements closely.\n\n05\n\nWhat are server licenses?\n\nServer licenses allow non-licensed desktop users to use font software on company platforms. Examples of non-licensed desktop users include your clients, dealerships, and third-party distributors. Examples of server-based software include prepress and variable print software, dynamic text generation (e.g., signage), automated marketing services (CMS/templates), and web-based print-on-demand platforms. The output of server environments can include non-commercial embedded documents like marketing materials as long as they cannot be edited. Commercial Embedded Documents (e.g., eBooks, magazines, etc.) require additional license coverage.\n\nHere’s a quick example: If a brand licenses Futura Now for some print materials and then decides to launch an app using the same typeface, they’ll need to secure a mobile app license for Futura Now before deploying the app.\n\n06\n\nWhat kind of license do I need to use fonts in emails or HTML5 digital ads?\n\nEmails and HTML5 digital ads fall under the umbrella of digital ad licenses. (Note that these are called “Digital Marketing Communications”). With a digital ad license, you can use a font’s software in HTML5 digital ads and email marketing up to your number of Licensed Impressions.\n\nThe challenge: Fonts at scale.\n\nWhile font licenses themselves fairly simple—merely paperwork listing a handful of do’s and don’ts—managing licenses and ensuring proper use has always been a headache.\n\nThis is especially true for larger brands and agencies that often accumulate large libraries of fonts.\n\nOver time, as team members and agency partners come and go, or as new brands join the organization and existing brands are updated, it’s pretty easy to lose track of which font goes where or whether an existing font license needs to be renewed. At an enterprise scale, this can quickly become a major problem.\n\nLegal font licensing: Secrets to avoiding pitfalls with fonts.\n\nFont. Music. Imagery. Colors. These elements are all integral to creating digital assets and marketing campaigns. Like Cinderella, however, only one magical font will fit a specific project or campaign. If a marketing or creative team finds what they think is the perfect font that helps express the message behind the effort, everything else seems to fall into place–except for legal font licensing.\n\n5 tips for building a better font licensing strategy.\n\nKevin Laurino, Manager of Art & Print Production, Retouching, and Finishing at Netflix, shares some experiences from his career-long relationship with fonts and how to tame the beast that is managing a brand’s font licensing. Here are some tips to help get you started.\n\nFonts help build better brands.\n\nModern brands are in constant motion, adapting and evolving to deliver highly personalized, dynamic experiences across countless channels, often to a global audience.\n\nHowever, the average creative spends eight hours a week on administrative tasks related to fonts. That’s eight hours not spent designing and creating for your customers.\n\nA thoughtful approach to font licensing gives design, brand, and marketing teams the freedom to be creative and the confidence to move quickly. It takes the guesswork out of choosing fonts and streamlines the finding, sharing, and designing with typography. Imagine what your teams could do if they got those eight hours back.\n\nCommon font licensing hassles that creatives face (and how to avoid making them).\n\nGraphic designers and other creative team members are usually the primary users of the fonts at a brand, which means they’re also responsible for ensuring those fonts are used properly according to their license.\n\nHow understanding font licenses can simplify creatives’ lives.\n\nCreatives are the primary users of the fonts, but licensing approval typically runs through other departments. Here are a few key concepts all designers should understand.\n\nFont license management.\n\nSorting out your organization’s font licenses can seem like a monumental task. It’s like venturing into your garage or attic after years of mindlessly filling it with boxes and boxes of random stuff. How do you even begin to organize it? Where do you start?\n\nIf this sounds like your brand, don’t worry: You’re not alone. We’ve helped countless brands organize and restrategize their approach to font licensing. And while there’s no one-size-fits-all strategy for getting your font licenses in order, the solutions are simpler than you might think. Here are some suggestions to help you get started.\n\n7 common problems organizations face due to poor font management practices.\n\nEvery organization has their own approach to managing their fonts, but oftentimes these practices aren’t consistent across the board. This makes working with fonts tricky and causes issues over time.\n\nWith the largest collection of award-winning type as well as access to the world’s most sought after foundries and type designers, Monotype Fonts enables creative professionals to spend less time on administrative work, and more time on designing meaningful brand experiences.\n\nKey features\n\nThe world’s best fonts, type designers and foundries.\n\nTrusted and secure font management.\n\nIntegrated with the tools you use everyday.\n\nControlled annual cost."
