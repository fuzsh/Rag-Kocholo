Youâre only limited by your imagination and command-line skills when configuring this Linux dock for your system.\n\nYou can download Tint2 directly with the use of your package manager.

All of these options are configurable with the use of the dock preferences.\n\nThe default set up is good too, but with the features and configuration options provided by this dock, you might not want to look at anything else.\n\nWho should use Cairo Dock? - People who want a highly configurable dock, without having to tinker with code or command line.\n\nWebsite: Cairo Dock Official Website\n\n4. DockBarX - Best Linux Dock for XFCE\n\nSo this dock is not limited to XFCE users but it certainly is the most popular among them. One thing to note is that if all you want is a default dock with icons that launch applications, the XFCE Panels are more than enough for the job.\n\nThe DockBarX offers additional features that the XFCE Panels donât; like identifying which app windows are open with some icon-hinting or showing app-specific menus wherever available.\n\nWho should use DockBarX? - If youâre an XFCE fan, but arenât satisfied with the XFCE Panelâs functionalities, DockBarX is the dock you should choose.\n\nWebsite: DockBarX Github\n\n5. Latte Dock - Balance of Ease of Use and Features\n\nBased on the plasma frameworks, Latte dock offers an intuitive experience for your open tasks and widgets. The content is animated with the use of parabolic zoom and the dock also features auto-hide to save screen space.\n\nThis dock was made with the K Desktop Environment in mind so most of the features work right out of the box on KDE. As it is with any Linux package, this dock can run on any other desktop environment, provided you configure it and provide it with the dependencies to run.\n\nWho should use Latte Dock? People who are KDE users and love the beauty and features that the desktop environment offers and would love their dock to have similar features out of the box\n\nWebsite: Latte Dock KDE Github\n\n6. Plank Dock - Easiest Linux Dock\n\nDid we say easiest? Yes, we did. This is actually the easiest Linux dock to set up and get started with. Not everyone is interested in configuring a lot of options just to get a dock show up correctly on their systems.\n\nThough most of the Linux docks that we talked about above also work out of the box, but the sheer number of features and options make them really advanced for someone who just wants something to work.\n\nWith just the right amount of configuration options, this dock makes it easy for its users to build beautiful Linux docks.\n\nWho should use Plank Dock? People who want easy-to-use, and out-of-the-box good looking dock which simply fits right into the current system theme.\n\nWebsite: Plank Dock Launchpad\n\n7. Avant Window Navigator - One of the Oldest Linux Docks\n\nJust because itâs the oldest, doesnât make it ugly or out-dated. In fact, itâs a very feature-rich, stable, and tried and tested Linux dock. If you are someone who loves stability over everything else, then you wonât go wrong with the AWN Linux dock.\n\nThe number of years it took to mature have made the code robust and you can use all of its features without breaking the dock.\n\nWho should use Avant Window Navigator? People who love tried and tested technology.\n\nWebsite: AWN Launchpad\n\n8. i3status - Best Linux Dock for Command-Line Fans\n\nThe i3status is like an empty slate. You decide exactly what goes on it from start to finish. You decide on which side of the screen it sticks, the size of the bar, the colors that it uses, the fonts that are used, everything.\n\nInitially built for i3-Window Manager, this status bar was liked and accepted by many users using other window managers. If you look at the screenshot above, youâll notice how thereâs a section that you can define for each element thatâs visible on the bar.\n\nWho should use i3status? - Command-line fans who want to display nerdy outputs of different commands on their docks.\n\nWebsite: i3status Official Page\n\n9. lemonbar - Lightweight Linux Dock\n\nThis is yet another bar that allows the configuration of each of the elements while being really lightweight on the system resources.\n\nWho should use lemonbar? People who want to keep their system lightweight and functional at the same time.\n\nWebsite: Lemonbar Github\n\n10. KSmoothDock - Best Linux Dock Built for KDE Users\n\nThis KDE specific dock can be extended with the use of KDE Plasma widgets. This Linux dock has a lot of UI animations and transitions with which you can make it look and feel attractive.\n\nNot everyone would love this dock as itâs really heavy on the system due to the number of dependencies that it has. But for those who are not concerned with the resource usage, and just want a lot of animations, this is your go-to Linux dock.\n\nWho should use KSmoothDock? For people who want to use and try a lot of animations and themes to make their dock look beautiful. NOTE: This dock depends on a lot of KDE packages and if you try to install this on a different desktop environment, youâll end up installing all those KDE dependencies too.\n\nWebsite: KSmoothDock Github\n\nConclusion\n\nCome to think of it, a dock is a really beautiful addition to your existing Linux desktop setup and with the right dock, you can make your entire setup stand out.\n\nWeâve tried to make sure we add the most popular Linux docks to this article. But let us know which Linux dock you use and like in the comments!"
