Listening Comprehension consists of similar material to the reading section but requires examinees to listen to brief audio scenarios: dialogs, newscasts, radio shows, and other audio media.

For example, the writing tasks may require examinees to type notes to friends, write letters or emails, or present opinions on topics, all in the target language.
