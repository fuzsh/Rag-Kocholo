Also had to post stories for our latest Store offer: it's called OS Refugee, it's actually a resurrection of a program we ran a LONG time ago, and it goes like this: if you've got a license for any other commercial operating system (i.e. Windows) you can trade it in for a 35% discount on 2008 Powerpack, 2008 Flash, or a Powerpack subscription. Neat, yes? Details are here.\n\nAlso spent a bit of time booting RC1 on my systems and filing bugs on the stuff that doesn't work. It can be surprisingly hard to find time to actually test the product 'clean' in between all the time spent promoting it, fixing it, and discussing it :). My systems all run Cooker, so there's some stuff I don't get to see unless I burn a One CD and test it out (like the installation process, hardware detection, and state of the default desktop)."
