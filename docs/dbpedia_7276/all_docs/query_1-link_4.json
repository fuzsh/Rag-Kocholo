        "text": "User:JSutherland (WMF) , why do you say \"Other than the changes below, Section 7 will not change.\"? What changes are being considered for other sections of the ToS? Where are they being discussed? I think some other changes are badly needed and should be considered. --Elvey (talk)\n\nHi Elvey - The only section with changes proposed is section 7. I apologise for the poor wording there; I'll fix that now. Joe Sutherland (WMF) (talk)\n\nCool. :This section was archived on a request by: Elvey (talk)\n\nAlso, when we create 2 headings by category 'For' or 'Against' it compartimentalizes the discussion. But overall good process: nice ad to bring me here, information about the issue, possibility to read the verbatim, then everybody's free responses... those are all good things to keep. Also btw I'm for the change :) — The preceding unsigned comment was added by 78.229.134.90 (talk)\n\nHi 78.229.134.90 - this dicussion's format attracts quite a lot of general support/oppose comments, so while it'd be ideal to stick to discussion itself, it's necessary for ease of navigation and discussion to separate these out. Joe Sutherland (WMF) (talk)\n\nI don't see any reason why it's not a good idea yet, but then again I've only read this page and haven't done much of my homework in this area. ^Have to agree with Meg a poll Yes/No/Abstain would be better, at end of time stick one up and let everyone vote.\n\nI contribute to Wikipedia mostly for this reason: Its information is freely available to all, and can be reproduced by anyone. I am not clear about the details of the proposed changes. If the new revision improves upon this feature of openness, I'm all for it. If the proposed revision undermines openness, I'm against it. If it goes beyond a certain point and undermines the concept of a free market of ideas, I'll have to find another hobby and stop contributing to Wikipedia. Brachney (talk)\n\nI think the differences table linked to above explains very well the differences between license, including openness and others: [1] - you can make up you own mind if the new license is as free as you want.--Strainu (talk)\n\nHello all. Je ne suis pas sûr de bien comprendre l'intérêt de ce changement. Désolé.\n\nI'm not sur to really well understand the interest of that change. Sorry. Gerardgiraud (talk)\n\nDoes changing the license affect the terms for existing content licensed under 3.0? For example, could the new provisions explicitly allowing URLs as valid attribution be used for articles already licensed under 3.0?\n\nIf not, are we going to have to track extra licensing information for every piece of content, and show a different license per article? --Yair rand (talk)\n\nThe first question is no, but the problem for me now is about the \"how-to-mark-the-articles-in-a-way-that-is-neat-enough\" question...--1233 | Questions?| Tools | He left the message at\n\nLate joiner here :( Just to ask has the ? of is the issue of sole rights and prop etc. been hit on yet . Upspeed me pls? This is a large topic to me as well, as a writer. Gary P. Wolfe 70.73.222.180\n\nAs I read through this proposal, I get two things I don't understand: You list impact to Wikinews and Wikidata. How does this affect Wikipedia / should I understand that Wikipedia content will thus be licensed under 4.0? ETA: Now I am seeing the banners on WP, so I assume it does affect Wikipedia - that should be clearly spelled out in the FAQ, though. (And, for example, I do not upload anything to Commons but all my work seems to get ported for inclusion there by others.... So if this has anything to do on Commons or Commons-only, then I'm not all that interested except for any potential differences in what I upload to WP. If this affects Wikipedia, why isn't there announcements on Wikipedia about this discussion - or did I miss something?) Second: I'd have questions about the impact of 4.0 \"enabling more anonymity\" provisions and how those might apply to WMF projects..... but honestly, if this is a, \"Yep, it's going through and this is our last chance to give you buy-in, but we won't change anything at this late phase of adoption no matter what,\" then I think I'm just wasting my time here.... Not saying I am or I'm not, as there's nothing to indicate what this 'feedback' will do in terms of adoption. LaughingVulcan (talk) Edited by me: 00:50, 6 October 2016 (UTC)\n\nHi LaughingVulcan, the most recent version of the terms of use was prepared after a thorough discussion in 2012, so we plan to listen to the feedback and discussion here and revise the proposal accordingly. I think Wikimedia's policy documents like the Terms of Use benefit greatly from close review. Thanks for taking the time to provide feedback.\n\nOn your first question, we can modify the question and answer section above the explain how this will affect Wikipedia. On your second question, the current Terms of Use explains attribution will be provided according to your username that appears in the revision history in an article. Removing this material is technically difficult for Wikipedia, so we will need to see if this is possible if the case comes up. Stephen LaPorte (WMF) (talk)\n\nThanks for the answers. First question, I think there may be other Wikipedians dropping by who will wonder, so thanks for that. The feedback, thanks for replying to that point. The second question, I think what I was wondering was since the anonymizing customizations are one of the differences linked in a 4.0 change document I saw here, I was wondering if anything would be changing based on that new feature. I don't mind having my identity associated with what I contribute at all, but wondering if WMF has any plans to tell other mirrors and copiers \"Yeah you can copy, don't involve the WMF or Wikipedia's name in it so it looks like we approved your copy.\" Again, thanks for the answers! LaughingVulcan (talk)\n\nI share concerns from some of the earlier comments concerning mainly the lack of enforcement of existing licenses. Clearly time and effort has been expended regarding the \"upgrade\" of licensing rather than enforcement of existing licenses. However, some of the more egregious license violations I've encountered have appeared on non-English sites. With official translations under 4.0, I expect the license to be more enforceable internationally to potentially combat these violations. Also, I appreciate the clarification regarding the right to cure. In practice, many violations are unintentional, and I expect that some reusers will respond better to a request suggesting they cure a violation during the cure period rather than a notice that they must cure or legal action could ensue.\n\nUtilizing the new license appears to be a good next step. If adoption is coupled with more enforcement (even if such enforcement is informal), I believe it's a step in the right direction.PolicyReformer (talk)\n\n@PolicyReformer: We agree that the more international licenses will help with enforcement, and I'm glad to hear that you and several others are interested in the issue. As I mentioned above, I'd encourage people to contact WMF Legal about these enforcement issues, especially if you find some bad ones. We can't fix all of them, but we can definitely help with some of the worse ones and we can sometimes direct you to helpful resources for how you can help with enforcement as a volunteer (because a lot of the time, just letting somebody know that there's a problem can lead it being fixed). -Jrogers (WMF) (talk)\n\nAren't Wikipedia and Wikimedia just a platform for all of this information from other places? I don't understand why we need any licencing at all if the information isn't originally from here and we have (almost) everything cited.\n\nHi there. Wikipedia is written using references from many places, but the text of the articles is original work by all the volunteers contributing worldwide. The licenses are there to help provide credit to all the awesome work that everyone is doing, to make it possible for other people to reuse that work to help spread knowledge around the world without needing to ask permission, and to promote the free culture values that underlie Wikipedia by ensuring that others who adapt and remix things from Wikipedia have to provide the new knowledge they're creating to the world too. -Jrogers (WMF) (talk)\n\nI wonder why don't wikipedia just adopted CC-By, not CC-By-SA\n\nWe use CC BY-SA because it helps promote the values of free culture. If the license were just CC BY, people would be able to freely use content from the Wikimedia projects for any purpose, but if they made changes, they could put those changes under regular copyright and forbid others to use them. The ideal is to make the world's knowledge available for everyone, and part of the way we strive towards that is by using a license that makes sure contributions to that knowledge remain available for everyone. -Jrogers (WMF) (talk)\n\nCC 4.0 should be allowed to bring the creators to upload their works. That secures a big amount of works. But Wikipedia should always campaign for the Creative Commons 1.0 version to patronize the concept of (literal) open-source.--Bluemel1 (talk)\n\nI request that a very straightforward infographic be created explaining the key differences between this version of CC and the previous. I was alerted to a helpful licensing tutorial infographic during a discussion on Facebook where several editors (including myself) bemoaned the inscrutability of photo licensing requirements to the average person. Funcrunch (talk)\n\nI like the idea of providing an infographic, but I'll need to see if anyone at the Foundation is able to work on something like this. Over the long term, I do agree that it would be helpful to have more simple and plain explanations of our licensing terms. I think that Creative Commons provides a good overview of what's new in CC 4.0, although it isn't quite an infographic. This would be a good project to discuss as part of our copyright strategy. Stephen LaPorte (WMF) (talk)\n\nThat infographic is awful. The problem is the information is false. It's clear and easy to understand. It falsely states, for example, that these logos were all improper uploads!--Elvey (talk)\n\nPersonnellement, je pense que nos contributions devraient se faire sous une licence d'usage non commercial : en effet j'apprécierais assez peu qu'une agence dite de communication s'appropriât mon travail pour un usage commercial. Il en de même pour les livres non téléchargeables gratuitement. Je ne remets pas en cause le droit de courte citation mais il est inadmissible qu'un livre soit du copier coller d'un article de Wikipedia sans créditer l'auteur et que l'éditeur menace toute personne qui recopierait le livre en question (qui est une contrefaçon) de plusieurs années de prison. Il serait temps que la Wikimedia Foundation se réveille et au contraire exige qu'une contrefaçon de Wikipedia devienne libre d'accès et téléchargeable. Cela serait une excellente punition car l'éditeur voyou n'aurait plus que ses yeux pour pleurer. Malosse (talk)\n\nBonjour, La licence libre est l'un des 5 principes fondateurs de wikipédia : https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipédia:Principes_fondateurs cependant cela ne veut pas dire que la réutilisation est en full-open : une copie doit mentionner : d'après/copie de Wikipédia, sous licence xxxx, et encore mieux la liste des auteurs. Un plagiat d'élève pour un exposé, s'il ne mentionne pas la source est illégal, de même qu'un livre plagiant de Wikipédia le serait. En ce qui concerne votre proposition d'obliger une modification à être publiée sous la même licence, je ne suis pas sûr qu'elle soit légale partout.Tpe.g5.stan (talk)\n\nThere are a few problems that needs to be sorted out before considering a transition to the CC 4.0. First of all, there are few problems when you want to transit to CC 4.0:\n\nHow can one knows the page uses 3.0 license or 4.0 license directly from revision?\n\nWill there be a phrase out of the 3.0 license (gradually transit to a 4.0 license before DD/MM/YY )?\n\nIf yes for the question above, are there any time span? If not, why? Using two licenses will affect readers and different institutions using the WIkipedia as source, as it creates legal problems.\n\nWhen will the change be in effect if the terms of use is passed? Immediately or there will be a buffer period (such as the change will take effect on 1 Jan 2017)\n\nWho can vote for the change of the ToS?\n\nCheers,\n\n--1233 | Questions?| Tools | He left the message at\n\nI'd say the answer to #2 should be no. From a technical point of view, it is much simpler to just have a cutoff time: from then on, any changes are under v4. There will be a (long) transition period in which many articles will not see any edit, but my understanding is that reusers can still use the v3 text under the newer license, so it makes sense to say that the whole Wikimedia project that made the change is under CC v4.--Strainu (talk)\n\nIs there any problem like it was in GFDL? Is there any serious problem in redistributing, blah blah? If not, this just seems unnecessary. — regards, Revi\n\nMy main problem is that we can't import CCBYSAv4 text into Wikipedia right now. As more and more websites move to v4, we'll have difficulties getting outside content.--Strainu (talk)\n\nI'm sorry, but I do not agree nor do I really see the need to move to Creative Commons 4.0. A lot of us have gone through a lot of trouble researching and photographing places and events with the intention of sharing our knowledge. Therefore, I believe that the right thing to do is thst those who want to use the work in Wikipedia is to at least give credit and state from where said information was obtained. Marine 69-71 (talk)\n\nThis is just for text. You can already post CC 4.0-licensed images on Commons and post them on Wikipedia. What's the actual problem? ViperSnake151 (talk)\n\nThis plan towards CC4.0, if implemented how would it affect the media on commons? Are you proposing forcing a license update on all existing CC licensed media or will commons media files be able to retain their current license version? Offnfopt (talk)\n\nThis is only about the text content. Commons has already allowed content to be uploaded under 4.0 licenses for a while now. ViperSnake151 (talk)\n\nI think the main page should clearly link to Creative Commons License Versions (big bold text) because the very first thing readers will want to know is what is the difference. Instead, we get text explaining why the differences are better, but really it is best if people read the differences for themselves objectively before they read your rationale for the change. In fact, the rest of the FAQ that's on this page should really be on the main page, as all of those points are important.\n\nAlthough this proposal affects \"default license for text\" many people on this talk page have expressed concerns about images. The last FAQ entry merely states you \"can\" use CC4 for images. What would be a more useful FAQ is \"What about images and other non-text contributions\". And your answer would be that this proposal only covers text. Also you should state that the default licence on Wikimedia Commons for new uploads via the Upload Wizard has been CC4 since XXXX-XX-XX (can't remember the date, but a while ago now) though Commons has always accepted and continues to accept wide range of licences and licence versions for non-text media. In fact, stating that Wikimedia Commons has been using CC4 as default (though not mandatory) licence for many months might be worth including in the main text.\n\nPerhaps you need a FAQ entry on retaining the -SA aspect. Fundamentally, the project is stuck with -SA since it cannot drop it while reusing existing content under the CC BY-SA 3.0 licence. That's aside from any desire to force reusers to keep the content free.\n\nAnd btw, I support the change to CC4. -- Colin (talk)\n\nSome communities, for some weird reason, not even have the cc-by-sa 3.0, for example n:pt, you will also bring them to 2016? Here we still have \"and you irrevocably agree to release your contribution under the CC BY-SA 3.0 License and the GFDL\", we will remove the GFDL? And as we already updating the license, why we do not release our logos under a free license?????? We are a free Movement, with a proprietary \"flag\", and this is a shame. Rodrigo Tetsuo Argenton m\n\nThe logos - notably the Wikipedia 'globe' are already freely-licensed, since 2014. Wittylama (talk)\n\nI created a Wiki, installed Mediawiki and chose cc-by-sa 3.0 to be compatible with Wikipedia. I also use Instant Commons. Do I have to change my Wiki licence now? — The preceding unsigned comment was added by 90.177.12.108 (talk) 2016-10-06T13:08:00 (UTC)\n\nYou will continue to be able to load images from Instant Commons. Wikimedia Commons currently has some images under CC 4.0 which can be displayed in articles that are released under CC 3.0. The amendment to the Terms of Use will affect text on Wikimedia sites. Stephen LaPorte (WMF) (talk)\n\nWhat is \"Project\", as used in TOU, Sec7a: \"The only exception is if the Project edition...\" and \"facts you contribute to the projects may be...\"? I think you mean \"sister projects\", like Wiktionary or Meta-Wiki, but you might mean WikiProjects. Or something else.\n\nIf the word is not defined previously in the TOU, you might add a definition or substitute \"all Wiki projects\" to the TOU text in section 7. Like \"facts you contribute to all Wiki projects may be...\". By the way, what is a \"Project edition\"? --RoyGoldsmith (talk)\n\nProject refers to a distinct top level URL. For example, German Wikipedia (de.wikipedia) is a different project than French Wikipedia (fr.wikipedia), which is different from Wiktionary. But everything on en.wikipedia is part of the same project, even if there are plenty of different subdivisions. -Jrogers (WMF) (talk)\n\nThe page says \"Version 4.0 asks an author to waive their moral rights, as well as personality and privacy, to the extent that is legally allowed\". Does this hold true only for the given edit, or do I waive my rights against the whole project and will therefore be unable to e. g. sue against insults on \"my\" wiki page (assumed that this page would exist)? If this is the case I'm against the change and happy to live in an country which does not allow such paragraphs. Jev12 (talk)\n\nHi Jev12, the terms of CC4.0 only require waiver of these rights \"to the limited extent necessary to allow [Wikimedia] to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise\". In other words, these rights would only be waived for your edits and other content you upload to be used on WP. They wouldn’t affect rights exercised generally (including in relation to other wikis and the WMF). TKrishnakumar (WMF) (talk)\n\nI'm concerned whether, with this baked into the license, it is even possible to upgrade the licence. EU-law is very strict concerning such rights, and since it was not specified in the original licence it might not be possible (even if the wording of CC-3.0 allows it). Do we really need a case before the EU-court for what is at best a hypothetical improvement (we can't even police the licence breaches that exist today). CFCF 💌 📧\n\nIt's still possible to upgrade. 4.0 doesn't actually stop the assertion of moral rights in those places such as some European countries where it's not possible to waive them. The moral rights waiver is there to provide as much freedom as possible for content that's designed to be changed, edited, and remixed without needing to consult the original author. In addition, the CC 4.0 license has what's called a severability provision in section 8 at the end of the legal language. What that says is that if one part ends up not working (like the moral rights waiver), the rest of the license still keeps on applying as much as possible. -Jrogers (WMF) (talk)\n\nSensible move to clearly superior license, although as BethNaught mentioned there are some slight subtle changes - a slightly less dense version of the changes is available here. Wikipedia should be a universal encyclopedia freely available for everyone around the world as far as possible and I believe the changes made in relation to creating a international license help Wikipedians reach this goal. Domdomegg (talk)\n\nI agree --Sargoth (talk)\n\nDomdomegg - I agree, that page should be linked to from the FAQ or announcement page. But the place to vote support is here, not here, Sargoth. Changed section title so we don't have two with the same title. And fixed link. --Elvey (talk)\n\nWell why would I expect user guidance in a wiki? thanks, Elvey --Sargoth (talk)\n\n:-) --Elvey (talk)\n\nMaybe my thoughts are related to the previous section. I received a dataset together with some copyrighted material under the CC BY-SA 4.0 licenc, and I was very happy. Then I realized (if I am right), I cannot use neither in Wikipedia under CC BY-SA 3.0 (or in Wikidata under CC0), because the license is not back-compatible. If most of the Wikimedia projects move to 4.0, many third party sites cannot use the content under 3.0 license version. While Wikipedia will be able to use their 3.0 licensed content (I would be happy to see a confirmation for this). Samat (talk)\n\nSamat, yes, you're correct. Just like we could use v2 content from, say, Flickr, we will be able to use v3 content from now on.--Strainu (talk)\n\nHi, I'm no legal pro, so I'm always a bit in the dark with reusing loops. The evolution around data-mining and data-bases do not help me in shedding some lights on the matter. There is a very wide range of licences and be only discussing v3 to v4 seems quite limited to me. I keep checking w:Comparison_of_free_and_open-source_software_licenses and w:Permissive_software_licence and yet I haven't this big meta-picture in mind yet. As I'm always balanced between virality and full liberty, so it's not always clear to me what option I consistently prefer.\n\nCouldn't we elaborate some frame (2D or cube, or hypercube) with planes such as this picture Fig.A. Some arrows could be added to complete directional compatibility ([from Licence-x to Licence-y]OK ; [from Licence-y to Licence-x]Not OK), or we could agree on a reading direction (lines toward columns), bringing a non-symmetric matrix. Thinking while striking the keyboard I think a table would be more appropriate for the time being (and the delay for the decision). Not-OK marks could be associated with 'footnotes'\n\nLine VS Column 0 OK Not-OK (1) 0\n\nWith explanations linked:\n\n(1) With <ref> One can produce content to be sold and modified from 0-licenced content... but the source must be open... + links toward permissive licenses (opposition between copyleft and copyleft) <- Do correct me cause I'm not even sure. What I'm sure of is there are, in wikipedias, passionate and expert persons quite up to the job (almost rand pinking, in fact from 'view history' and editor statistics.). Shaddim, Wickey-nl, Farmer21, Yug, Cantons-de-l'Est Does the proposal appeal to you or any friends ? (1) explanation dots may need to be -> (expl) linked to [[w:Confronting licences#CC confrontations#Cc-zero VS Cc-by-nc-nd]] for more complete documentation.\n\nBy the way a code for folding tables would be great (show - develop columns), cause it's gonna be a wide one. Folding CCs and GPLs and BSDs, or categories by rights and so on, would help reading in my opinion. No idea how to wikicode that however. (same pinking) Whatamidoing (WMF) any idea ?\n\nIn anyway, this would be the occasion to complete and improve some pages in the wikipedias.\n\nHope it might help the debate. --RP87 (talk)\n\nTables such as the design in w:en:Template:Navbox with collapsible groups – on some wikis, for most users. However, collapsing content (including, but not limited to, tables) is an accessibility problem, because it hides things from some people (e.g., anyone using ⌘ Command+F to find the collapsed content on the page). Also, it doesn't work if your web browser and/or the local wiki doesn't support it (almost certainly more than 10% of WMF wikis, and probably much more than 10% of them). So it's possible, but I don't necessarily recommend it. Whatamidoing (WMF) (talk)\n\nThis is an important point desiring a legal answer. We may find ourselves in the egly position to force others to change their licenses, which would not be nice. --grin ✎\n\nHi, I'm willing to join a license discussion regarding compatibility and compatibility chart representation. Regarding the chart with specialized column vs row interpretation, I thought about something like that myself. Separating colum-row into source and destination license makes sense. cheers Shaddim (talk)\n\nI think We have enough information about the advantages of this upgrade. Can we point out some of the disadvantages on the other hand? We need those information from different perspectives and viewpoints related to law related, user experience and many more. Can someone provide some examples if we switch to the new license regarding how it will affect most of the users?\n\nAgreed, that's fair. Suggest someone chooses two of the strongest drawbacks identified on this page and adds them, after the advantages bullet points at Terms_of_use/Creative_Commons_4.0, as \"Concerns\".--Elvey (talk)\n\nI have two thoughts to share, the first is the less important. I like this part of the 4.0 license, which is explicitly different between version 3.0 and 4.0 (although I don't know if it is even relevant in the context of Wikipedia):\n\n\"Version 3.0 included a provision allowing a licensor to request that a licensee remove the attribution from an adaptation, if she did not want her name associated with it. Version 4.0 expands that provision to apply not only to adaptations but also to verbatim reproductions of a work. Licenses now account specifically for situations where licensors wish to disassociate themselves from uses of their works they object to, even if their work hasn’t been modified or published in a collection with other works.\"\n\nThis is the second thought, to which I attempted to refer as a\"Version compatibility question\" in the subject line of my comment.\n\nAll things equal, it would seem easier to just stick with Creative Commons 3.0. My only concern is that by NOT changing to CC 4.0, we won't have the most current version. Is it possible that the older versions (e.g. 3.0, 2.0) might not be valid anymore and thus we wouldn't be using any licensing at all? I don't think that that is how Creative Commons licensing works now, but based on analogy with, say, Microsoft Windows, and other licensed software products, older versions aren't supported, aren't upward compatible and so forth. Is there any basis for such a concern, if we choose to remain with CC 3.0 given that there is now a CC 4.0 available? --FeralOink (talk)\n\n@FeralOink: A license is like a contract and doesn't go obsolete, so there would be no need to worry about that. The reason we want to make a change, though, is that we think that the advantages of going to 4.0 outweigh the bit of extra work that will be needed for a transition. 4.0 helps a lot with clarity and consistency among jurisdictions, and the international translations will make the license more accessible to people around the world. Even though there have been a few changes that have caused some worry in the comments here (like the discussions on moral rights and database rights), we think that on balance the improvements make it worth our while to do the upgrade. -Jrogers (WMF) (talk)\n\nThe Wikimedia Foundation is not playing fair in the consultation.\n\nFirst. The statement of the consultation is not true.\n\n“Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects have been available under a Creative Commons license since June 2009, when the Wikimedia community expressed very strong support for using version 3.0 of the license.”\n\nWikimedia community did not express a very strong support for using version 3.0 of the license. Community expressed support for using a Creative Commons license instead of the GFDL, as you can see here [2] .\n\nIn 2009, v.3 was the current CC license, that is the reason because that version was adopted, nothing special.\n\nSecond. WMF Must advice about changes in Creative Commons license more than in the changes of the Wikimedia Terms of Use.\n\nIf the consultation is about an upgrade in the license, should be more important to understand the change in the scope of the license than in the text of the WM Terms of Use.\n\nThird. Version 4 of CC licenses was released in 2013. Why we are discussing the upgrade now?\n\nCommon sense dictates that is preferable to be covered under the latest version of the license than in a former version. That is not truth always but more of the times. I guess (and I hope) there is a discussion thread about the upgrade of the license in 2013 or 2014. But again, here is not an explanation or context about why 3 years later of the release of the CC BY-SA license version , the WMF team decides to start a discussion about the upgrade.\n\nWhy Wikimedia projects have not benefited by the CC v.4 since 2013? Someone was clueless, I guess.--SirWalter (talk)\n\n@SirWalter:: I can address a couple of your points. While I wasn't at the Foundation in 2009, my understanding of the upgrade process is that BY-SA 3.0 was the only option available for the switch at the time, so the strong support of the community was for that license. My knowledge there is secondhand though, so I'm not the best source for it. For your second point, we tried to provide both if you take a look at the legal note linked from the top. That discusses the changes in 4.0. There are also a number of resources from Creative Commons that compare the two licenses such as What's New in 4.0. Third, the delay was in large part getting things in order to do an upgrade. One of the big advantages of 4.0 is the improved international accessibility, but much of that was not available until this year because it took time for the licenses to be translated to other languages. We're going ahead now because we think this is a good time to make the change and that with the versions of the license currently available and more to come soon, the whole Wikimedia movement see a lot of those international advantages with the upgrade. -Jrogers (WMF) (talk)\n\nHi, I read the comparison between 3.0 and 4.0, according to CC website:\n\nTrademark and patent explicitly not licensed In the 4.0 licenses, trademark and patent rights are expressly mentioned as not among the rights licensed. No CC license version licenses patent and trademark rights along with copyright. These rights are treated separately and are not covered by the license. In 4.0, this was made explicit to avoid confusion. However, in all license versions, implied licenses may come into play where these rights would interfere with exercise of the rights granted by the CC license.\n\nif someone in Wikimedia commons make his work (photo or video) that contain his trademark or copyrighted logo as CC, or make his trademark or logo as CC, is this unacceptable in 4.0 ? could someone explain this point ? -- Ibrahim (talk)\n\nHi Ibrahim.ID - this consultation and proposed changed in license is for text content only. Images and videos are not covered and will continue to be licensed under their varying licences. Joe Sutherland (WMF) (talk)\n\nThat said, yes, you can place your trademarked logo under a 4.0 CC license. What it would mean is that the image could be reproduced under the terms of the CC license if it was being used in ways that did not require permission under trademark law. (For example, using the logo as an artistic picture in a book of designs or as part of a collage, so long as it was clear that the company was not endorsing the usage or connected with the art.) For uses that did require permission under trademark law, such as placing the logo on a product for sale, that use would require a trademark license from the trademark holder even though the copyright of the image was licensed under a 4.0 CC license.

In many cases the articles in Wikipedia are nothing else but blatant fraud. I wrote several articles in Wikipedia just to be vandalized by the members of political regimes controlling especially the polish edition of Wikipedia (members of soviet communist agentura, communist pro soviet journalist, members of special forces, polish military intelligence, some mental cases, and especially the politicians from the communist Civic Platform monitoring the political aspects of soviet propaganda in today's Poland.\n\nThere was NO crash in Smolensk, it was a blatant assassination performed by the soviet OMON, on orders of soviet pupets in Polish government such as Donald Tusk, Tomasz Arabski, Radosław Sikorski, Bronisław Komorowski, Gen.

UNIVERSAL CITY STUDIOS, INC., (1984) No. 81-1687 Argued: January 18, 1983 Decided: January 17, 1984\n\n[[7]]\n\nPetitioner Sony Corp. manufactures home video tape recorders (VTRs), and markets them through retail establishments, some of which are also petitioners. Respondents own the copyrights on some of the television programs that are broadcast on the public airwaves. Respondents brought an action against petitioners in Federal District Court, alleging that VTR consumers had been recording some of respondents’ copy-righted works that had been exhibited on commercially sponsored television and thereby infringed respondents’ copyrights, and further that petitioners were liable for such copyright infringement because of their marketing of the VTRs. The Supreme Court explained that any individual may reproduce a copyrighted work for a “fair use”; the copyright owner does not possess the exclusive right to such a use. The Court held that the recording accomplished by VTRs was only time-shifting in nature and even though 100% of the copyrighted work was copied, the use nonetheless constituted a fair use.\n\nCopyright Clause argument was so powerful was the fact that §514 fails to “promote the Progress of Science” as contemplated by the initial words of the Copyright Clause. The petitioners argued that because §514 affects only works already created it simply cannot meet the Clause’s objective. In the face of a correct and logically consistent argument like this what did the Supreme Court say? They decided that the creation of new works is not the sole way Congress may promote “Science.” In fact, the Supreme Court went on to do what they did throughout the opinion, which was say that Eldred already answered the question, which is of course nonsense. Of course, even if that were true the fact that the Supreme Court has previously made egregious mistakes shouldn’t be a legitimate rationale to perpetuate those mistakes and make wholly new egregious mistakes.\n\nIf you are a creator or inventor you probably did like to read that the Supreme Court said that Congress is empowered to determine whatever intellectual property regimes serve the ends of the Clause. So I guess that means that Congress gets to both enact intellectual property laws and gets to interpret them and the Constitution, which I had previously thought was the prerogative of the Supreme Court of the United States beginning back with Marbury v. Madison. My non-Ivy League law education must be lacking because I was SURE that it was the Supreme Court that was supposed to interpret the Constitution and the limited powers granted to Congress under Article I, Section 8 were not plenary power to determine whatever ends justify the means… but I digress.\n\nCreators and inventors were also likely quite pleased to read that “Progress of Science” does not exclusively require there be incentives for creation. For example, the Supreme Court explained that Congress could determine that progress is promoted inducing the dissemination of existing works is an appropriate means to promote science. The reason this should be so well received by inventors is because everyone knows that there are a great many reasons innovations are not available on the market. For example, someone may have patented an item and was just unable to get the project to move forward for one reason or another. The next person, perhaps a generation later, who wants to patent and move forward decides not to when they learn they cannot obtain a patent. So under the Supreme Court’s rationale here in Golan v. Holder Congress could determine that progress would be promoted by disseminating the invention and the only way that can be accomplished is to grant exclusive rights to make the dissemination commercial attractive and feasible. Thus, the logic underpinning the Golan v. Holder decision (and I do say that with my tongue planted firmly in my cheek) must be that inventions that are in the public domain could be re-patented at the discretion of Congress.\n\nEven the once mighty and revered First Amendment was no match to the plenary power granted to Congress by the Constitution to do whatever they please with respect to intellectual property rights. According to the Supreme Court there is nothing in the historical record, subsequent congressional practice, or Supreme Court jurisprudence that suggests there should be any First Amendment issues associated with snatching works that were once in the public domain and granting them copyright protection.\n\nUnbelievable really. Exactly which part of “Congress shall make no law… abridging the freedom of speech” is confusing to those Ivy League educated know-it-alls on the Supreme Court? Do they actually understand copyright law at all? Do they realize that the petitioners could engage in all kinds of activity freely prior to the restoration of copyrights and then after the restoration they can engage in such activities only if they pay licensing fees to the copyright owner?\n\n[[8]]\n\nSupreme Court OKs Public Domain Works Being Copyrighted\n\nGolan v. Holder, 132 S.Ct. 873 (2012) – Petitioners, orchestra conductors, musicians, publishers and others that enjoyed the free access to preexisting foreign works in the public domain sued, Respondent, the U.S. Attorney’s Office claiming a violation of the First Amendment, as well as claiming that Congress exceeded its authority under the Copyright Clause. In 1994, Congress implemented §514 of the Uruguay Round Agreement Act (URAA) which extended copyright protection to works that were previously denied U.S. copyright protection. Prior to this the U.S. did not protect sound recordings before 1972 or when the author had not complied with certain U.S. statutory formalities. The Supreme Court, first, held that §514 does not exceed Congress’ authority under the Copyright Clause of the U.S. Constitution because the Copyright Clause does not exclude copyright protection to works that are in or were previously in the public domain. In fact, the Supreme Court pointed out that Congress has, multiple times, adjusted copyright law to allow for the protection of new categories of works and works that were previously in the public domain. Second, §514 does not violate the First Amendment because “the idea/expression dichotomy” and the “fair use defense,” were not impeded nor limited by the statute’s implementation.\n\n[[9]]\n\nThere is no \"fair use\" in most parts of the rest of the world, and US court decisions won't have any effect either.

It has been scientifically proven that people who think something is pleasing to the eye, will be more likely to stay on that page.

Horrible error to limit PUBLIC DOMAIN material with any kind of license. Either public domain exists, or it does not.

There is no benefit of a CC license except to confuse people or worse, discourage them from using public domain works. Nobody understands CC licenses anyway, and the most common one demands you not profit from your work in any way. So, if your aim is to thwart creativity (new art, especially) put a license on it.

This step should be thought of since creative common license will give you more scope and future to your website using this step. 3) Make your website dynamic, else creative common license will give nothing to the website. What do I mean by dynamic?? See google, it has constant changing environment with changing needs of user and adaptable environment with improved technology, from last decade, wikimedia has not even updated its logo, how would the people accept. Have changes like improving website appearance and much more, What has it to do with creative common license? well the license is for covering every field, so you must have experts from each field in that proportion itself. 4) Without loss of generality, improvement will help and license is just an \"Cherry on the cake\".\n\nI would strongly oppose Wikipedia if it does not even read this content.

There is a ported license for France in the French language, which is not exactly the same as the international license (it contains pieces that are specific to French law); a few other jurisdictions also have ported licenses that are available in the languages most widely spoken in those jurisidictions. But these are not the same as official translations of the license designed to work in any jurisdiction.\n\n(I know the French translation of 4.0 is in progress, but it looks like it hasn't yet been completed. Making the translations of these licenses is very difficult, though—they have to make sure that the text makes sense for the language and legal context of all of the Francophone countries and that it corresponds as closely as possible to the original text in English, so that the legal meaning is not changed.)

But putting it under the 4.0 version of the license would make it so projects using version 3.0 of the license could not use it. So this makes Wikipedia content available to less projects and reduces the license compatibility and reusability of the content elsewhere. I am for a license that maximizes the reusability of the content and has downstream compatibility with the most licenses, in particular something that would be at the very least GNU GPL-compatible would be good because there is some source code on Wikipedia and it ought to be usable in open-source software. I suggest instead we should be using the CC0 Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication on Wikipedia, but if that is not something other people agree with, at the very least we ought to stick with the current license instead of switching to one that has even less downstream compatibility with other licenses so I oppose this suggestion. Anything available under a 3.0 Creative Commons license, according to the license terms, is already also available under 4.0 and later versions of the same license, so this move accomplishes absolutely nothing productive whatsoever and I oppose it completely and suggest other people do the same. For the same types of reasons, when it comes to software currently licensed under GNU GPL 2.0 or later, when people suggest switching to GNU GPL 3.0 or later I always oppose that too, it limits downstream license compatibility if you \"upgrade\" to the latest license version which means less people can reuse your work. Just stick with the current license or better yet switch to a less restrictive one that is either public domain or is closer to public domain. Switching from CC BY-SA to CC-BY and getting rid of the ShareAlike restrictions would also be good, and the earlier the version of CC-BY the better, if you can't agree to CC0 license 1.0 or later, I would suggest having everything licensed under CC-BY version 1.0 or later, and by 1.0 or later I mean people will be able to reuse the content under version 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, etc. of the license, whichever version they choose, I am not suggesting we use some later version of the license than 1.0, 1.0 would be best. And yes there were 2.1 and 2.5 releases of the Creative Commons license suite but I suggest \"downgrading\" to version 1.0 for maximum compatibility, doing the exact opposite of this move, and also getting rid of the ShareAlike restrictions.\n\nEDIT: For examples of projects that would be adversely affected by a move to Creative Commons 4.0 from 3.0, just look at any other wiki that uses Creative Commons 3.0 licenses and uses Wikipedia content. They would have to update their license to Creative Commons 4.0 too and some of them might not want to do that for some reason, but if Wikipedia moved to 4.0, anyone reusing it under the Creative Commons license rather than the GFDL would have to upgrade their Creative Commons license to 4.0 as well. Since there is a lot more content originally contributed to Wikipedia and later used on other wikis than content originally contributed to other wikis and then later used on Wikipedia, I am particularly thinking how this move would negatively impact all the other wikis on the Internet that reuse content on Wikipedia currently. As someone who is an admin on several of them I think it is best not to cause problems for other wikis, other wikis have enough trouble to deal with already with vandalism, hosting, etc., and then introducing this license version incompatibility problem to the rest of the wikis on the Internet besides Wikipedia, a large portion of which reuse Wikipedia content, is just creating more trouble than any good that it does. At least it causes trouble for other wikis besides Wikipedia and I think Wikipedia should be as generous as possible in sharing information with the rest of the wikis on the World Wide Web, and this move would be counterproductive for many existing wikis. --Yetisyny (talk) first posted , last updated 20:51, 8 October 2016 (UTC)\n\nThis section was archived on a request by: Joe Sutherland (WMF) (talk)\n\nall content should be completely free, reusable with no strings attached. creative commons is a private initiative which should be barred, public domain is the way to go!\n\nIn an ideal world, possibly yes.

Reusers will benefit from the clear language in the license. Creative Commons is encouraging platforms to offer CC 4.0 as the default license, so we will likely see more adoption around the web.

It is very bad if WIKI images in the most cases cannot be used in a small commercial projects. Grand everything in WIKI to everybody for any purpose! CC0 must be set as the default rule for each new upload. (sory my bad english) PavelSI (talk)\n\n@PavelSI: You can use works licensed under BY-SA 3.0 or BY-SA 4.0 in a commercial project. What you have to do, though, is to give people attribution under BY-SA, which isn't required under CC0 (there's also the bit about relicensing derivative works, which I discuss in reply to a few other people below). We think it's good to have that attribution requirement so that everyone who contributes to the Wikimedia projects receives acknowledgement for their awesome work. -Jrogers (WMF) (talk)\n\n@Jrogers (WMF): the problem with every other licence is that you need to interpret its limitations to see if they apply to your case. for example attribution. what is proper attribution? there always will be borderline cases. who should i attribute to? what if i don't have author's name, and i have to research first? i should be vigilant not to cross any lines. with cc0, there are no lines to cross, and using the information is as easy as possible. therefore, cc0 is superior to all licences. that said, i don't think that wikipedia should enforce cc0, because it will exclude some contributors who insist on other licences. but setting as default or recommended is not a bad idea. Krisztián Pintér (talk)\n\nPeople does not use WIKI data in commercial projects because it is too much work for maintenance all the references to the WIKI and attribution. It work only in theory, practically NOT. PavelSI (talk)\n\nI think it's a fair balance for people to be giving attribution for their commercial projects, but still be able to use things in most cases. While there can be borderline cases, one of the things that is helpful about CC4.0 is that is uses more clear language so that hopefully more people will understand the attribution requirement and get it right while still being able to use all this material. -Jrogers (WMF) (talk)\n\nI agree with Jrogers (WMF).

ChristianKl (talk)\n\nI strongly disagree with CC0, since it would enable commercial projects to do anything with your content, even brand or re-sell it under a different name.

Doing so entirely guts most commercial uses. CC0 whenever possible, please, or at least CC4-BY, but just say NO to share-alike. A lot of small businesses are trying to survive on the niches that CC-BY and CC0 allow us. Share-Alike requires us to share, instead of sell, our labours.\n\nI strongly oppose this. Free content should stay free and there should be no backdoor to monopolize it. Chaddy (talk)\n\nIn addition to the point from Chaddy, there are a couple reasons why the Share-Alike part is needed here. There's license compatibility. Going from the current BY-SA 3.0 to BY-SA 4.0 is compatible and therefore can be done just by upgrading the terms of use and editing articles, as the legal note explains. Upgrading to BY, on the other hand, would not be compatible with existing articles and would require some kind of really difficult to implement split where older contributions are still under 3.0 BY-SA and only new changes would be on BY. I think that's probably messy enough to just be unworkable. On top of that, the values of the Wikimedia movement have been supported by having BY-SA. It's still possible to use any content licensed under By-SA commercially, for example by drawing upon it in a larger work. The SA part means that if you take the CC licensed content and change it, your new adaption has to be freely licensed, which prevents people from copying part of a Wikipedia article, improving it, and then claiming that nobody is allowed to access or reuse their version of it. -Jrogers (WMF) (talk)\n\nI agree with the other replies. Strong support for including share-alike. It's a key part of the Wikimedia ecosystem and the community that has developed. --QuixoticLife (talk)\n\nI agree with the anonymous OP philosophically, but I agree with the other users that it would be impractical if impossible. Emir of Wikipedia (talk)\n\nYes tough luck OP it really should stay share-alike imho... That's the whole idea of it in the first place, that's what makes Wikipedia work and spread the love. That's one of the reasons many contributed. Perhaps there are other data/knowledge bases for other uses you can tap from ? Perhaps you can change your product to include proper links and open its content and still do the buisiness of providing it ? By facing those obstacles we keep knowledge free and its spread free too. It's important is the reason.\n\nI strongly disagree with the Share-Alike provisions. I believe its against the wikimedia spirit for the free sharing and dsitribution of information. Copyrighting under CC with a mandatory share alike actually IMPEDES the free flow of information. As a contributor on Wikipedia I want this info shareable freely, and that includes the ability for people to take this information and make use of it freely for commercial purposes or own purposes. By right all information on Wikipedia articles should be PUBLIC DOMAIN and not copyrighted at all. BaronVonchesto (talk)\n\nNon-starter. It's totally impossible to switch to CC4-BY or CC0.

Then, why all the fuss about the license anyways? Or am I misunderstanding something? What qualifies as a \"fact\": A word? A sentence? A paragraph? A page? An image? I for myself do not understand, what's the matter with this latin database stuff... I'm no lawyer and I'm not going to become one. This should get some clarification.\n\nSecond, above, some guys asked, why they can't use the stuff commercially, but as far as I understand, they should (otherwise the License would be nc?), right? HirnSpuk (talk)\n\n@HirnSpuk: Let me go in reverse order. Yes, both the current BY-SA 3.0 and the proposed By-SA 4.0 allow for commercial use. There's an attribution requirement though, and if somebody makes a remix, they have to freely license it under the same or an equivalent license (that's the SA part, and we have it because there has been consensus from early in the movement that it would be bad for people to take parts of Wikimedia projects, improve them, and then lock them up so people can't access them). As far as the database rights thing, it is a bit complicated, so I'll try to do my best to explain. If you're really interested, we have a wikilegal post about databases that goes into more detail. The short version is that under copyright law, facts can't be copyrighted. A \"fact\" for this purpose is some true statement about the world, like the date of a historical battle or the chemical composition of a material.But in some places that have these database rights, the limitations on reusing the database can go beyond just copyright. Facts are an example where database sometimes hit that copyright doesn't, and we wanted to explain that we have that waiver language to make sure that things like facts that aren't covered by copyright aren't limited by database rights either. That said, if you think the example sentence is more confusing than helpful, I'd be curious to know that, as we could change it or take it out. -Jrogers (WMF) (talk)\n\n@Jrogers (WMF): So they may sell it as long as they attribute the author and include the license, right? Concerning the database: Thanks for the link, I suppose the problem is with waiving the rights. If we interpret the ideals of wikimedia extremly strict (which is exactly what is done in german wikibooks, where the statement \"we are only accepting verifiable knowledge\" is always referred to as an absolute not discussable statement, that needs to be followed under all circumstances) every information within the database of wikimedia-projects could be considered a fact. So if we consider every information in the wikimedia-project-databases being a fact and if a contributor waives all the rights for facts, there is actually nothing left, that the license could be applicable to. In this regard, yes I think it's really confusing. But I think the problem is with the rights-waiving not the example itself. If it is really clear, that sui generis database rights are only and solely concerned with the database in total, or with compiling large portions of a specific database, than I'll agree it's fine (so nobody needs to attribute every contributor of wikimedia projects, if he/she is just doing statistics or something). But as far as I'm understanding it, with the new sentence \"Where you own Sui Generis Database Rights covered by CC BY-SA 4.0, you waive these rights. As an example, this means facts you contribute to the projects may be reused freely without attribution.\" means: somebody makes a dump. Everything in the dump are facts → no license needed, no attribution needed, go for it and sell it. I would expect something like: where you own specific Sui Generis Database Rights you waive these rights in favor of the Wikimedia foundation. I don't know if I was able to clarify, because I'm not a native speaker. And I'm totally unsure if I even understand everything correctly. I just wanted to point out, that Wikimedia or whatever should be needed to be attributed and nobody can dump the database and say: well you just waived all your rights of the database and it's just mere facts, so you can't complain (as the example-sentence could be understood in my opinion). Regards Axel --HirnSpuk (talk)\n\n@HirnSpuk: I think maybe taking out or rewriting the facts sentence would be good. Most of what's on Wikipedia isn't \"facts\" in the copyright or database legal meaning of the word. Specific bits are facts, say the date of birth of Alexander Hamilton for example. But a paragraph about Hamilton's early life is creative because it contains a particular way of expressing many facts about Hamilton's life and there are many different ways those same facts could be laid out. One could not copy and sell that whole paragraph without proper attribution, but one could take a fact (the birthdate) and use that without attribution. In places without database rights, one could even take a lot of facts, say the birthdates of every major figure in the American revolution, and compile them from Wikipedia without needing to include a thousand different attribution links (extra edit: even in countries with database rights, you might be able to do this without attribution, depends on the database and whether you've taken a \"substantial\" portion of it, which is a word nobody knows the meaning of here). I think that's a good thing, myself. Copyright is meant to protect creativity, it stops someone from copying a whole Wikipedia article verbatim and pretending that they wrote it. But someone who puts together a list of dates, or a table of molecules for a school report shouldn't be forever obligated to include hundreds of different links and license text with it.\n\nSo that's what the database rights waiver is doing. It's not giving up huge chunks of Wikipedia at all. In the example you give, the purpose who copied the data dump would need to attribute Wikipedia properly. What the waiver is doing is giving up this small right in the overall organization or structure of a database that only exists in some places and not others. We think it makes sense to do that because it means that Wikipedia will be consistent worldwide (instead of people needing to check what country something came from for how they can use it), and it will keep consistency with how data has been used under 3.0, which does not mention database rights. -Jrogers (WMF) (talk)\n\n@HirnSpuk: When asked about database rights, I always mention census data. Now, census data is not under copyright in most countries, simply because it's not creative work, but a series of facts. However, European Union countries protect that data by database rights for 15 years from the date the database structure is \"finished\" (which is very slippery IMO, but whatever\". Say that a single wikipedian collects all the historic census data from the beginning of censuses to 1995 for all countries in the world. He might say that this is a new database and that it is protected by this Sui Generis rights. What the license says is: you're giving away this right, so if company X only copies that data (and not any surrounding text, which might be protected by copyright), it can do so freely.\n\n@Jrogers (WMF):: I don't think taking out the fact sentence would be good. The users need to know even of the most obscure corner cases of this license. More examples would probably help.--Strainu (talk)\n\n@Strainu:: I suppose a \"good\" lawyer could change your opinion about what is a \"fact\" ;-). Especially regarding the \"threshold of originality\".\n\n@Jrogers (WMF):: I agree with Strainu. With a clarification, what a fact is in this regard (maybe even how it is normally stored), and a clarification, that database-entries containing creativity are not in focus, it would be fine. Regards Axel --HirnSpuk (talk)\n\nChange my mind? Not really likely. Force a court decision in the direction he wants, possible, unfortunately. :) It has happened before and will happen again.--Strainu (talk)\n\nAs for \"facts\": in OpenStreetMap (which is the \"wikipedia of maps\") a \"fact\" is something which can be known by people without intervention or help of other people, and when many people get to know the same fact that result is the same, or very similar knowledge. When they reach the same conclusion from the same fact suggests (and most often implies) that there was no subjective or creative process involved, since everyone have reached the same result. Examples are the color of a column, the name of a street [seen on a street name plate], the temperature on a given day, the amount of windows on a building. Apart from this very simplistic definition there are facts which are data involve human processing but not creativity, like the area of a country, the salinity of a water body or the amount of planetoids of a given size range in the solar system; gathering these facts require human efforts but not [subjective] creativity. These facts are not copyrightable. Sui generis db right does make it possible to lock down such non-copyrightable facts if they are in a special environment, collection (\"database\"), leaving in uncertainity how much of the database is protected, usually resulting debates and copyright-like claims about non-copyrightable data. (For example we had pretty heated arguments a decade ago with a legal entity publishing non-copyrightable law text in a database, and they argued that even one text body of a law violates their sui generis database right and we should immediate remove the text or face the untold consequences, lawyer signature follows.) --grin ✎\n\nThis section was archived on a request by: Joe Sutherland (WMF) (talk)\n\nFAQ mentions this question, but just in a way, that Wikidata keeps CC0. Significant part of the content of Wikidata comes from Wikipedia, and the data transfer between Wikipedia and Wikidata is continuous and bidirectional. It can work until Wikipedia is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0, because it has no regulation about database rights (although I always felt concerns of this data transfer from CC BY-SA 3.0 to CC0, in some countries it is strongly questionable). But what happens after Wikipedia is under CC BY-SA 4.0 with explicit database rights? My understanding is, that extracting datasets from from Wikipedia to Wikidata won't be legal anymore. Is that right? Samat (talk)\n\nHi @Samat: This issue is one of the main reasons we have the sentence about waiving database rights. Even without that waiver, the upgrade to 4.0 shouldn't significantly change the process of importing from Wikipedia to Wikidata. Database rights are a small right in the overall organization or structure of a database, and they exist in some countries but not others. (You can read more in the Wikilegal post on this if you're curious.) What the clause in the 4.0 license does is clarify that those database rights, if they exist, are included in the CC license terms. The waiver language we added makes sure that copying facts to Wikidata doesn’t have the CC 4.0 limitations anywhere, so that bits of data can freely be copied over and put under the Wikidata CC0 license. Note that the way that articles are written and information is presented on Wikipedia was protected by copyright before, and still will be under CC 4.0. It’s just that the kind of copying to Wikidata that focuses on facts (in the copyright meaning of the term, which Jrogers (WMF) discussed in a couple of replies), like dates of historical events or chemical compositions of material, still cannot be copyrighted, and can be imported into Wikidata. - LMixter (WMF) (talk)\n\nEffect on Wikivoyage\n\nWikivoyage is historically CC and has never supported GFDL - apparently the reasoning in the distant past was that GFDL required that the work include a copy of the license and Wikivoyage destinations were intended to be printed as individual hard-copy pages for one city and brought as carry-on baggage?\n\nThe Wikidata issue could also affect Wikivoyage - there are a few infobox-style templates like voy:template:quickbar with data fields that are being migrated from WV to Wikidata. In theory, voy:template:listing could also be a future migration target (a huge quantity of database-style records for individual venues).\n\nWhat are the implications of the differences in license (WP is GFDL/CC-BY-SA, WV is CC only, WD is CC-0 public domain) - any pitfalls here? K7L (talk)\n\n@K7L: There shouldn't be any impact on how Wikivoyage works in transitioning from 3.0 to 4.0. Wikidata being CC0 means info from there should be freely usable, and the waiver in the terms of use gets rid of any ambiguity about migrating things to Wikidata, although even without that waiver it's unlikely that copying a template would be enough to invoke database rights. -Jrogers (WMF) (talk)\n\nThis section was archived on a request by: Joe Sutherland (WMF) (talk)\n\nInsofar as Wikiquote may be considered a database (a compilation as described at Wikilegal/Database Rights), does the waiver of Sui Generis Database Rights covered by CC BY-SA 4.0 effectively waive all rights to the Licensed Material and render the License Conditions (BY, SA) inapplicable? ~ Ningauble (talk)\n\n@Ningauble: No, the database waiver wouldn't render the license conditions inapplicable to Wikiquote, which isn't relying on database rights today either. Rather, copyright, just regular normal copyright, can exist in lists and compilations when there's some creativity in layout and organization. So somebody copying a whole page off Wikiquote would need to comply with the license conditions. -Jrogers (WMF) (talk)\n\nThanks Jrogers, I think I understand the intent. I realize that under CC 3.0 we have been relying on copyright alone, and that Sui Generis Database Rights are in a jurisdictional muddle. However, if database rights eventually become more widely and uniformly recognized we could be hamstrung by having already waived them.\n\nI had wondered about this for a couple reasons.\n\nWikiquote has itself run afoul of Sui Generis Database Rights, as I understand it, when the entire French Wikiquote was taken down in 2006 after it was claimed to have extracted a substantial part of another quote database.\n\nSome of the leading quotation sites appear to be routinely crawling the internet for quotations and extracting data wholesale without attribution, including data from Wikiquote, not to reproduce the pages per se but to create Adapted Material.\n\nIn that context, I wonder whether relying on copyright alone is sufficient to protect the right of attribution of the project's community of contributors. ~ Ningauble (talk)\n\nThis section was archived on a request by: Joe Sutherland (WMF) (talk)\n\nI believe this section is about images. This section should include a sentence explaining that the images have their own copyrights which are visible when you click on the image. After you click on the image, click on \"More Details\", and the copyright instructions, the institution or individual who either owns the original image and/or who uploaded the image, and a description are available in a box below the image.\n\nThis section was archived on a request by: Joe Sutherland (WMF) (talk)\n\nJust throwing this quick thought in here: Upgrading to CC BY-SA 4.0 would allow one-way compatibility with GNU General Public License, version 3 only (GPLv3-only) and Free Art License 1.3. CC BY-SA 3.0 is not compatible with any version of the GPL or FAL.[1] 80.221.159.67\n\nI don't think we should still accept GFDL-only images, the sources of such images can be taken by another licensed images, and by GFDL, when re-using, you must fork a LICENSE file within your images, which could fire your memory disks. --221.238.16.46\n\nThis section was archived on a request by: Joe Sutherland (WMF) (talk)\n\nThe Creative Commons 4 license reads\n\nMoral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\n\nMoral, publicity or privacy rights are not granted by the license, but the contributor waives these rights to allow licensees to exercise the licensed rights (the right to reuse). If the right to reuse clashes with privacy rights, those privacy rights are waived.\n\nWaiving these rights are a bad idea, particularly for images. In 2007, Virgin Mobile took a CC licensed work, an image of an Asian American minor - plastered it with derogatory text and used to it to advertise their service in Australia.[11] Virgin were sued for violation of privacy rights, the case was eventually dropped due to geography, and not because it was without merit. Lawrence Lessig wrote about the case, acknowledging that CC licenses did not deal with privacy rights, and for those concerned about these rights to consider using CC noncommercial licenses.[12]\n\nWikipedia is text. Other media on the project are separately licensed. I find it difficult to think of an example where Wikipedia text could violate the privacy, publicity or moral rights of the contributor. But I'm also not a fan of proliferating licenses that waive privacy and publicity rights, which is why I opposed the license migration above. - hahnchen (talk)\n\nWikipedia is text, but it is being used as bait to lure new contributors into uploading images onto Commons under terms which arbitrarily allow their automated harvest for virtually-unlimited commercial re-use for purposes which have absolutely nothing to do with making an encyclopaedia. The scheme works as follows: a user finds an article on some seemingly-innocuous topic like w:boy scouts, uploads a photo of his scout troop, then someone on some advertising-laden commercial site \"re-uses\" that free image to illustrate erotic spanking - on some other website which has nothing to do with Wikipedia. Maybe they have a boy scout fetish, who knows. (Wikia actually did do this to us once, the \"boy scout controversy\" ended with the wiki in question moving to another webhost, but waiving personality rights would leave us *wide open* if the issue were ever to come up again.)\n\nFor that matter, \"reusable by anyone\" would include the KKK, the mafia, whomever. It can also be abused to infer that the subject is endorsing a commercial product. Waiving personality rights can therefore be a very bad idea.

You have done a great job in making knowledge free and future generations will thank you for doing this pioneering work. Knowledge leads to truth and truth sets us free. In such a world, there is little or no violence and people share rather than hoard. You must know that your work is leading to that unified world and with great success. More and more people all over the world are learning everyday what is wrong with the lives that we lead and are working towards a better world. If we restrict the flow of this learning, it can only slow down the real progress of mankind.\n\nTherefore, I am of the opinion that there should be no restrictions whatsoever. In fact, people should be free to use any material available in any which way they want. Actually, the restriction should be on the people who do not want others to use their material: they should not be allowed to put restricted material anywhere in Wikipedia/Wikimedia. Acknowledgement of the source should be voluntary and should come as a result of gratitude to the source and not as a legal requirement. In ancient India, sages and philosophers did not attach any importance to their authorships since the thought was that it is nothing but pride and ego. Nevertheless, those who wrote sensible things became famous anyway and are acknowledged and quoted even today. If I quote Shakespeare, I am quoting him more for my association with a famous person than for Shakespeare's needs. So, the fear of original authors is not very well founded because if they have said or written anything meaningful, they will anyway get known and acknowledged.\n\nThis section was archived on a request by: Joe Sutherland (WMF) (talk)\n\nActually, I agree because all with depth of knowledge can help widen a disc"
