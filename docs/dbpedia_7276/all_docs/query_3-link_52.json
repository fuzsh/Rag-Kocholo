        "text": "The new Microsoft Teams\n\nWhat is the new Teams?\n\nThe new Teams desktop client is reimagined from the ground up with performance in mind, providing a faster, simpler, and more flexible experience. The new Teams client installs and loads faster, letting you launch the app and join meetings more quickly, giving you more time to focus on the business tasks.\n\nThe new Teams ensures more efficient use of device resources. You can lower memory and disk usage with a Teams app optimized for your device. Whether you have users on multiple accounts or tenants, the new Teams can help eliminate the silos and bring them together in one place, giving them more extensibility and scale.\n\nServicing agreement\n\nTeams is governed by the Modern Lifecycle Policy, with the expectation that users remain on the most up-to-date version of the desktop client. Automatic updates ensure that users have the latest capabilities, performance enhancements, security, and service reliability. An in-app alert is displayed if the userâs current version is between one and three months old, and if there's a new version available.\n\nLearn more about the Modern Lifecycle Policy under the Servicing agreement for Microsoft Teams.\n\nNew Teams availability\n\nNew Teams is available for:\n\nWindows\n\nMac\n\nVDI (Dates for VDI are available at Upgrade to new Teams for Virtualized Desktop Infrastructure (VDI).)\n\nEdu\n\nWeb\n\nNew Teams is not available for these Customer segments:\n\nConsumer\n\nDesktop running a Windows 10 version earlier than 10.0.19041\n\nNew Teams web client availability\n\nThe new Teams client is now available for the Web.\n\nBrowser Date R4, Chrome/Edge, Non-EDU Mid November 2023 Chrome/Edge, EDU November 2023 Safari/Firefox (target date) March 2024 Gov March 2024 Microsoft 365 operated by 21Vianet in China March 2024\n\nWhen will all users see the \"Try the new Teams\" toggle?\n\nLicenses\n\nLicense Availability date Business Licenses and Teams Essentials Available Enterprise and other Licenses See the schedule listed in this article\n\nIf the update channel isn't listed, then the Monthly Enterprise Channel schedule is followed.\n\nUpdate channel Date Public preview program Available Targeted release program Available Monthly Enterprise Channel Available Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel (Preview) Available Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel, Semi-annual Extended, and remaining channels Available Current Channel In rollout Government Cloud (GCC, GCC High) Preview In rollout Government Cloud (DoD) Preview March 2024 Microsoft 365 operated by 21Vianet in China March 2024\n\nWhen will the new Teams become the default client?\n\nExisting Teams users are updated to the new Teams based on two factors:\n\nWhich Microsoft 365/Teams license is assigned to the user; and,\n\nThe Microsoft 365 app update channel you're using.\n\nUsers are switched once to the new Teams.
