Experience teaches us that change can be sudden, discontinuous, and wrenching. Calculus draws its power by refusing to see that. It insists on a world without accidents, where one thing leads logically to another. Give me the initial conditions and the law of motion, and with calculus I can predict the future – or better yet, reconstruct the past.\" — Steven H.

I like to say that the key skill developers possess is not coding itself, but rather the ability to learn quickly. This book will help you think like a developer, so you can pick up new tools, solve new problems, and keep blazing forward as a dev.

There's a significant portion dedicated to the “behavioral interview.” This course will show you what to expect and how to prepare for it – through example questions and case studies. It's a time-efficient way to gear up for a successful run of interviews.
