        "text": "It was great to be back home in the Sixth District and hear directly from folks up and down the Valley. As many of you are aware, the Biden-Harris Administration’s out of control spending has pushed our national debt to $35 trillion. This Administration’s misguided open border policies continue to allow millions of unvetted illegal immigrants into our country. In May, two illegal immigrants attempted to breach Quantico Military Base. Now just 3 short months later, both have been allowed to walk free after posting bail. Unfortunately, Americans are still struggling with rampant inflation, and the July jobs report showed no signs of the economy getting any better. As always, it is an honor to represent Virginia’s Sixth District in Congress. As we head into an August district work period, I am committed to fighting for commonsense policies that best serve hardworking Virginians.\n\nNational Debt Surpassing $35 Trillion\n\nThe Biden-Harris Administration’s economic policies have placed a heavy financial burden on hardworking American families. Last week, our national debt surpassed $35 trillion for the first time in history. This unprecedented debt level is a direct result of the Administration’s big spending sprees and fiscal irresponsibility.\n\nIn just one year, our national debt exploded by $2.35 trillion. Under the Biden-Harris Administration, Americans are struggling to keep up with the high costs of goods and increased prices. While hardworking Americans must balance their budgets, it is long overdue for Washington to do the same. It’s time for both parties to work together toward slowing the growth of spending, reducing future deficits, and easing the burden on American taxpayers and families.\n\nQuantico Breachers Out on Bail\n\nIn May, two illegal Jordanian migrants attempted to breach Quantico Marine Corps Base in Virginia. Last week, they were released on bail and now are free, roaming our community. Under failed Border Czar Kamala Harris, every community is a border community, including Virginia. The Biden-Harris Administration continues to prioritize jeopardizing our national security and American’s safety over securing our borders.\n\nIn 2024 so far, 93 illegal migrants on the FBI terrorist watchlist tried to evade U.S. Border Patrol. Each day with Kamala Harris handling our border security puts our national security at risk. Rest assured, I will continue to fight for the safety and security of our great nation.\n\nJuly Jobs Report\n\nLast week, the July jobs report shed light on the true state of our economy for the American people. Despite claims from the Biden-Harris Administration of economic prosperity, the facts tell a different story. With an unexpected rise, the unemployment rate soared to 4.3%, reaching levels not seen since October 2021, and a mere 114,000 jobs were added.\n\nUndeniably, the Biden-Harris Administration has transformed our once thriving economy into ruins, affecting every American. I am committed to combatting reckless, liberal spending sprees and restoring a pro-growth economic agenda to benefit all hardworking Americans.\n\nDistrict Travels\n\nThank you for the opportunity to serve as your Congressman. If my office can ever be of assistance, please contact my Washington office at (202) 225-5431.\n\nFor the latest updates from Washington and across the Sixth District, please follow my Facebook and Twitter pages.\n\nLast week, Vice President Kamala Harris announced her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. Governor Walz has enacted radical, liberal policies that have wreaked havoc on the streets of Minneapolis. Additionally, we continue to see inflation and high prices taking a toll on American families. A new report revealed that Americans are drowning in credit card debt like never before, thanks in part to the failed Biden-Harris Administration’s economic policies. Also, as we’ve seen since January of 2021, our open border chaos continues. Most recently, ICE has arrested 50 illegal aliens for separate felonies allegedly committed on U.S. soil. Last week, I took the time to honor all Purple Heart recipients for their honorable service defending our great nation on National Purple Heart Day. As we continue into an August district work period, I look forward to hearing from folks all around Virginia’s Sixth District and fighting for the policies that support the hard-working men and women of our great Commonwealth.\n\nTim Walz’s Liberal Record\n\nLast week, Vice President Kamala Harris unveiled her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. Governor Walz’s drastic policies have stunted Minnesota’s progress. In 2020, Walz watched passively as Minneapolis was engulfed by violent protests and riots. His lenient approach to crime has fueled a spike in street violence in Minneapolis. Governor Walz’s liberal policies have paved the way for a flood of illegal migrants into Minnesota.\n\nAmong his legislative actions, Governor Walz approved granting driver’s licenses to 81,000 illegal migrants and enacted legislation to provide state-funded healthcare for 40,000 illegal aliens as well as free college tuition. Governor Walz’s track record isn’t one to be proud of. If he is elected to the Vice Presidency, Walz would mirror his failures on a national scale. The American people deserve more than Walz’s radical Far-Left agenda which would only steer our country towards a dangerous path.\n\nEconomy Update\n\nIn the wake of the Biden-Harris Administration’s reckless economic policies, our economy is in complete disarray. Inflation has skyrocketed, plunging Americans into a credit card debt abyss, now totaling a staggering $1.14 trillion from April to June alone.\n\nSince the start of 2021, Americans have been forced to shell out an extra $13,000 just to cover the basics, all thanks to the disastrous economic strategies pushed by this Administration. While wages remain stagnant, families are grappling with the mounting costs of necessities. Hardworking Virginians are feeling the crunch of this inflation catastrophe every single day. It’s high time the Biden-Harris Administration took decisive action to alleviate the financial burdens crushing millions of hardworking Americans and put our country back on a path of fiscal responsibility.\n\nBorder Update\n\nAs you are aware, for the past three and half years our nation’s borders have been overwhelmed with an influx of illegal migrants, all transpiring under the failed leadership of Border Czar Kamala Harris. Vice President Kamala Harris was given the crucial task of securing our southern border—a responsibility she has neglected and at which she ultimately failed. The Biden-Harris Administration has systematically turned our once secure border into a gateway for an unprecedented wave of illegal aliens, fentanyl trafficking, human trafficking, cartel activities, and much more.\n\nJust recently, in a stark example of this crisis, ICE arrested 50 illegal aliens on felony charges on their very first day in the United States. Also, 375 individuals on the FBI terrorist watchlist have been encountered trying to evade Border Patrol during the Biden-Harris Administration. Their radical open-border policies are not just reckless; they are flagrantly lawless. It is imperative that the Biden-Harris Administration assumes full responsibility for the perilous policies that have facilitated the entry of countless dangerous individuals, lethal fentanyl, and nefarious drug traffickers into our county. Under their leadership, our national security and the lives of every American will be at risk because of their open border policies.\n\nNational Purple Heart Day\n\nLast week as we celebrated National Purple Heart Day, we took the time to honor all Purple Heart recipients for their sacrifices to our country.\n\nEvery day, we are grateful to all the brave men and women in uniform for their valor and dedication to defending our freedom.\n\nDistrict Travels\n\nThank you for the opportunity to serve as your Congressman. If my office can assist, please get in touch with my Washington office at (202) 225-5431.\n\nFor the latest updates from Washington and across the Sixth District, please follow my Facebook and Twitter pages.\n\nIt was another packed week in session as House Republicans continued our work delivering for the American people. First, the Judiciary Committee demanded answers on the weaponization of the Department of Justice. Biden’s failed border policies continue with a new executive order that does nothing to secure our borders. I was honored to be appointed to the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party to combat the growing threat of the CCP. Hosting a telephone town hall event in Roanoke, Salem, and Botetourt was a pleasure. Last week, we commemorated the 80th anniversary of D-Day and honored those who stormed the beach of Normandy for our freedom. I always enjoyed meeting with organizations, businesses, and folks in D.C. and back home. Rest assured, I’ll continue to fight for your values and interests in Washington and help protect the safety, security, and freedom of the people of the Sixth District.\n\nDemanding Accountability for the DOJ’s Abuse of Power\n\nUnder Merrick Garland’s leadership, the Department of Justice has become weaponized, betraying the American people’s trust in our justice system over the past few years. We have seen this DOJ work hard to protect the Biden family but not to uphold justice for the American people.\n\nIn a Judiciary Hearing last week, I pressed Attorney General Merrick Garland on the abuse of power within his agency and the questionable appointment of David Weiss as Special Counsel in the Hunter Biden investigation. The deep ties between Weiss and the Biden family raise alarming concerns of bias and favoritism within the DOJ. The American people deserve transparency and accountability, not a two-tiered justice system.\n\nDuring this critical time in our nation’s history, House Republicans will keep working to end the weaponization of our justice system at all levels of government.\n\nCombatting The Chinese Communist Party\n\nThis week, I was honored to be appointed to the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party by Speaker Mike Johnson. Biden’s weak foreign policies have only empowered and emboldened the Chinese Communist Party, so we must respond with tough policies that confront the CCP. I look forward to working under Chairman Moolenaar and with my colleagues to address and counter the growing threat of the CCP at home and abroad.\n\nBiden’s Executive Order on the Southern Border\n\nThe deteriorating border under the Biden administration is one of the top concerns for people across the Sixth District and our country. Over the last three years, we have seen every month hit a new record as thousands of people come across our border, and the Mexican cartels ravage our communities through an explosion of drug trafficking, human trafficking, and sex trafficking.\n\nLast week, Biden announced an executive order that would shut down the southern border once illegal crossings hit 2,500 per day. According to CBP sources, the first full day of this executive order had zero impact on the border. This executive order is nothing but an election-year stunt. If Biden truly wanted to stop the invasion, he could have, but he continues to ignore the crisis he created blatantly. If he does not act, then we must continue to work to hold him and his administration accountable.\n\nTelephone Town Hall Event\n\nThank you to everyone from Roanoke, Salem, and Botetourt who could join my latest telephone town hall on Thursday. I enjoy holding in-person and telephone town halls in the Sixth Congressional District’s 22 counties and cities. These events are important opportunities for me to address the concerns of each community directly. Your direct input helps me effectively represent Virginia’s Sixth District in Congress. I look forward to hosting similar events in the future.\n\nRemembering D-Day\n\nIn commemoration of D-Day, we pay tribute to the nearly 160,000 valiant Allied troops who stormed the beaches of Normandy, embarking on a monumental fight for freedom against pure evil. We will never forget their courage and unwavering commitment to save the free world. May we always honor them and America’s Greatest Generation for their sacrifices.\n\nMeetings on the Hill\n\nDistrict Travels\n\nThank you for the opportunity to serve as your Congressman. If my office can assist, please get in touch with my Washington office at (202) 225-5431.\n\nPlease follow my Facebook and Twitter pages for the latest updates from Washington and across the Sixth District.\n\nThe House was back in session last week, with an extra day of session on Saturday to finish out the week. House Republicans brought forward various separate spending bills to address ongoing conflicts around the world. In addition to funding, we also considered several measures to demonstrate our support of Israel and take action against Iran. I also had the pleasure of recognizing some of Virginia’s Sixth District student-athletes. As always, I enjoyed meeting with organizations, businesses, and friendly faces in D.C. and back home. As we finish a district work week, followed by four consecutive weeks back in session, I will continue fighting for the best interests of Virginia’s Sixth District and our great Nation.\n\nSupporting Our Allies\n\nThe Biden administration’s weakness on the global stage has only emboldened our adversaries, which has in turn only escalated violent conflicts worldwide. Under this administration, we’ve witnessed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, China’s alarming threats against Taiwan, and most recently, Iran’s unprecedented direct assault on Israel. The challenges facing Israel, Taiwan, and Ukraine are distinctly separate, demanding separate responses and separate votes on spending bills to address them individually.\n\nIsrael stands as our foremost ally in the Middle East, and they are currently fighting the Hamas, Houthi, and Hezbollah terror groups, as well as Iran – the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism. I voted in support of providing military aid to Israel to help them in their fight against these terror groups and ensure their nation continues to exist.\n\nAt the beginning of this year in his New Year’s address, Chinese President Xi made a troubling declaration that he aims to take action against Taiwan. I also voted in favor of providing Taiwan with military aid to help deter Chinese aggression and preserve peace in the region.\n\nRegarding my vote against additional Ukraine funding, I condemn Russian aggression and pray for peace in the region. However, we have already given over $100 billion to Ukraine without sufficient accountability from the Biden administration as to where the money has gone. While financially supporting our allies can sometimes be in America’s best interest, we must exercise fiscal responsibility and demand some accountability for American tax dollars from this Administration.\n\nTo assist Ukraine, I voted for the Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity for Ukrainians Act, which gives the president the authority to confiscate Russian sovereign assets frozen in America and transfer them to assist in Ukraine’s reconstruction efforts. This legislation also prohibits the release of funds to sanctioned Russian entities until Russia withdraws from Ukraine and agrees to provide compensation for harm caused by this unprovoked war. This bill has passed the Senate and has been signed into law.\n\nAmerica’s Broken Border\n\nLast week, I also voted in favor of H.R. 3602, the End the Border Catastrophe Act, which would have fixed our broken asylum system, hired more Border Patrol agents, and provided them with the resources they need while reinstating Trump-era policies like Remain in Mexico, and forced the Biden administration to resume the border wall. Unfortunately, the bill failed to get the ⅔ majority required by leadership to pass under suspension of rules.\n\nWe need strong, common-sense border security measures to protect the American people. For years now, House Republicans have been calling on President Biden to secure America’s border. We have not only been trying to negotiate with President Biden to fix the problem, but we also passed legislation, like H.R. 2, which has been deemed the strongest border security bill that has passed Congress, and it has been over in the Senate since last year.\n\nFailure To Hold Mayorkas Accountable\n\nUnfortunately, the Senate voted down both articles of impeachment against DHS Secretary Mayorkas after the House sent over articles of impeachment last week. We did our job in the House by passing the articles of impeachment, and I am disappointed that Democrats in the Senate unanimously voted to bypass their constitutional duty and hold a trial. Secretary Mayorkas has lied to Congress and ignored his statutory responsibility to secure our nation’s borders. Every day that Mayorkas has been at his job, Americans are less safe. He deserved to be held accountable.\n\nJoe Biden and Mayorkas’ policies have effectively rolled out the welcome mat for millions of illegal immigrants to enter our country unchecked. Among those entering are people on the terrorist watch list, only a fraction of whom have been apprehended. This leaves an unknown number of people who have successfully entered our country. House Republicans will continue to force this issue, bring legislation to the floor, and pressure the Senate to take up this critical issue.\n\nWatch my interview on WSET, where I discussed my disappointment with the Senate dismissing the Mayorkas impeachment trial.\n\nProtecting Americans From Foreign Adversaries\n\nI voted favor H.R. 8028, the 21st Century Peace Through Strength Act, which also included H.R. 7521, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act. As you might remember, the House passed this TikTok bill in March, a crucial step in safeguarding our nation’s security and ensuring that the American people are not targets of foreign manipulation, surveillance, or targeting through online applications like TikTok. The bill prohibits marketplaces—like app stores and web hosting services—from hosting applications controlled by foreign adversaries of the United States. It offers ByteDance, which owns TikTok, a specific window to divest, or the application will face a prohibition in the U.S.\n\nThe new bill includes some small but important changes from the bill in March that strengthen the bill’s fight with judicial scrutiny and extend the length of time given to ByteDance to divest. This legislation is crucial to protect the well-being and national security of the American people and our country from foreign adversaries.\n\nStanding with our Ally, Israel\n\nThis week, we took significant legislative steps to reaffirm our unwavering support for Israel and to hold Iran accountable for its actions. The measures we’ve passed, alongside other crucial pieces of legislation ignored by Leader Schumer in the Senate, offer a robust strategy to address the threats posed by Iran.\n\nThese measures, which I supported, include:\n\n• H.R. 6046, the Standing Against Houthi Aggression Act, which redesignates the Houthis as a Foreign Terrorist Organization after the Biden Administration removed them from the list.\n\n• H.R. 6323, the Iran Counterterrorism Act, requires Iran to cease support for acts of international terrorism as a condition for the President to waive secondary sanctions and provides for a congressional review process for national security interest waivers of these sanctions.\n\n• H.R. 4691, the Iran Sanctions Relief Review Act, provides for tighter congressional oversight of any Administration attempt to weaken sanctions imposed on Iran.\n\n• H.R. 5947, which ensures Iran cannot gain access to funds that could be used to support terrorism, including funding the Biden Administration has tried to make available to the Iranian regime.\n\nBy supporting Israel’s defense efforts, imposing sanctions on Iranian leaders, severing their financial lifelines, and targeting their allies and terrorist networks, we’re sending a clear message. Our commitment to Israel’s security and our determination to counter Iran’s malign activities remain steadfast.\n\nRecognizing Sixth District Student-Athletes\n\nI was pleased to congratulate the Christendom College women’s basketball team on winning the United States Collegiate Athletic Association Division II National Championship in Petersburg, Virginia. The Christendom Crusaders won the trophy by scoring 76-65 in the championship game against Johnson and Wales Charlotte, bringing home the first women’s basketball national title in school history. Congratulations to all of these champions whose hard work paid off.\n\nWatch my floor speech recognizing Christendom College’s Women’s Basketball Team.\n\nAnother outstanding performance by Sixth District athletes was the Blue Ridge Christian girls’ basketball team, which won the Virginia Association of Christian Athletics, VACA, State championship. The team had a tremendous performance throughout the season, finishing 18-2 and going on to win the championship, their second VACA title in 3 years.\n\nWatch my floor speech congratulating Blue Ridge Christian’s Girl’s Basketball Team.\n\nMeeting on the Hill\n\nThank you for the opportunity to serve as your Congressman. If my office can ever be of assistance, please get in touch with my Washington office at (202) 225-5431.\n\nFor the latest updates from Washington and across the Sixth District, please follow me on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter for the latest updates.\n\nLast week, the House continued to struggle with the question of how to address our ballooning deficits while funding the core functions of the Federal government. While some wanted to kick the can down the road once again and pass a temporary funding bill with no restrictions, I joined many others who support addressing the crisis at our southern border. At the same time, we debated efforts to fund the government and avoid a shutdown. Also, in conjunction with the annual March For Life, the House passed legislation that prevents the Secretary of Health and Human Services from targeting pregnancy centers that serve new mothers and families. As always, meeting with folks back in the district and listening to how I can better serve them is a great pleasure. The battle against wasteful spending is ongoing, and I will continue to be mindful of the hard-earned tax dollars of the citizens of Virginia’s Sixth District.\n\nSame Story, Same Outcome\n\nWith a national debt topping $34 trillion, grocery and gas prices skyrocketing, and many Americans priced out of the dream of home ownership, the massive overspending and resulting inflation at the core of “Bidenomics” is crushing working families. Yet rather than addressing this head-on, Congress passed another continuing resolution, the 20th such bill since I came to Congress in 2019. It has been 28 years since Congress met its obligation and passed all twelve appropriations bills in regular order.\n\nConsistently passing continuing resolutions instead of going through the appropriations process is irresponsible and delays important discussions about funding priorities. Furthermore, the continuing resolutions being passed this year continue the Biden-Pelosi levels of government spending that were adopted under Democrat control and have left American families out in the cold. Virginia’s Sixth District did not elect me to go along with the broken system that has led to trillion-dollar deficits and massive debt. I will continue fighting to right the fiscal ship and restore order to our Federal budget.\n\nCondemning Biden’s Open Border Policies and Safety Crisis\n\nUnder the Biden Administration, the southern border crisis has only worsened. Since Biden took office, 169 individuals on the terrorist watchlist have been apprehended attempting to cross the border illegally, and the CPB has seized 27,023 pounds of fentanyl. That does not consider those who escaped apprehension or the drugs smuggled in that were not detected. This has turned cities and towns across America into border communities, as the lack of enforcement by Secretary Mayorkas and President Biden has resulted in cities like New York riding schools into housing for illegal immigrants and forcing American children to stay home and learn remotely.\n\nThis betrayal of our laws and our Constitution by President Biden and his lackeys must end, which is why House Republicans are moving to impeach Secretary Mayorkas and this week adopted H. Res. 957, which condemns the Biden Administration’s open border policies, disregard of national security, and public safety crisis along our southern border, and urges President Biden to reverse course and secure our border.\n\nStanding For Life\n\nLast week, Washington, D.C., saw thousands of Americans of all ages brave the cold weather to condemn abortion in the annual March for Life. In support of the right to life and the protection of the unborn, House Republicans passed two critical pieces of legislation last week. H.R. 6918, the Supporting Pregnant and Parenting Women and Families Act, prevents the Secretary of Health and Human Services from unfairly targeting pregnancy centers that serve new mothers and families who choose life. We also passed H.R. 6914, the Pregnant Students’ Rights Act, which requires universities and higher education institutions to communicate and distribute information informing pregnant students of their rights, accommodations, and all resources available to them. The tragedy of abortion is one of the greatest human rights crises of our day, and we must continue to stand up and be a voice for the voiceless.\n\nDistrict Travels\n\nThank you for the opportunity to serve as your Congressman. If my office can ever be of assistance, please contact my Washington office at (202) 225-5431.\n\nFor the latest updates from Washington and across the Sixth District, please follow me on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter for the latest updates.\n\nAs the 118th Congress convenes Washington for the second year of the session, House Republicans are determined to pursue a responsible spending deal that cuts wasteful spending, secures our border, and returns money to the taxpayers. In more theater, Hunter Biden made a surprise appearance during his contempt hearing in the House Oversight Committee. As Congress prepares for the road ahead, I remain committed to fighting for our shared values in the Sixth District of Virginia.\n\nAmerica’s Broken Border\n\nAll across the country, Americans’ primary concern is the broken border that President Biden and Alejandro Mayorkas created. In the past three years, over 6.2 million encounters have been at our southern border. In December 2023, there were over 302,000 incidents of migrants attempting to cross the border. These failed policies have enabled fentanyl and other deadly drugs to pour into our communities, as well as criminal migrants to be released into the country with a low likelihood of removal.\n\nLast week, the House Committee on Homeland Security, led by Chairman Mark Green (R-TN), conducted their first impeachment hearing of Alejandro Mayorkas and laid out the facts for Americans. While accountability for the broken border ultimately rests with the President, we must act to remove Secretary Mayorkas for violating his oath of office and encouraging the chaos we are seeing at the border right now. Impeaching Mayorkas is the first step, but we must continue to pressure the Senate to pass legislation such as H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act, the strongest border security package in United States history.\n\n“Bidenomics” Is Wrecking American Families\n\nLast week, the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI), a key inflation index, reminded us that “Bidenomics” is not working for hardworking families. The report was “higher than expected” as it increased at an annual rate of 3.4%, and it is the 33rd straight month with inflation above three percent.\n\nDespite the Biden Administration’s push for “Bidenomics”, the absolute truth is families have seen skyrocketing grocery and fuel bills and depletion of their savings accounts. To guarantee that hard-working taxpayers can keep more of their money, House Republicans are working daily to restore fiscal responsibility in Washington and revive our economy.\n\nHunter Biden’s Surprise Appearance on Capitol Hill\n\nHouse investigators have continued to follow the facts into President Joe Biden’s involvement with his family’s business dealings for months. Instead of appearing for his deposition on December 13, 2023, Hunter Biden staged a media event on the Senate side of the U.S. Capitol, where he made a public statement without taking any questions. Then, this week, at the Oversight Committee’s markup of his contempt resolution, Hunter Biden pulled a publicity stunt, continued defying the orders, and appeared at his contempt hearing.\n\nHunter Biden believes that defying orders and executing publicity stunts will divert attention from the investigation into his family’s shady business dealings. However, the House Oversight Committee and House Judiciary Committee remain committed to uncovering the truth for the American people. No one, including the Biden’s, is above the law.\n\nDistrict Travels\n\nFor 90 years, the Salem Rescue Squad has displayed selfless sacrifice to the city of Salem as it stands as the second oldest all-volunteer rescue squad in the United States. It was an honor to present them with a commemorative plaque recognizing the squad winning the 2023 Volunteer EMS Service of the Year award at their banquet.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to serve as your Congressman.
