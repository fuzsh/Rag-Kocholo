        "text": "Category Archives: Garland Park\n\nGarland Park – Between Storms – Waterfall and Early Wildflowers\n\nWith just a few hours of clear skys Sunday afternoon between the latest series of the Pineapple Express, Mike took off on his bike and I took off on a hike. Rumor had it that the waterfall at Garland was running after four years of drought. I wanted to make sure there was some truth to this rumor.\n\nWell I wasn’t alone. By noon on Sunday the lower trails of Garland were streaming with hikers, mountain bikers, and dogs\n\nof all shapes and sizes jumping for joy to be out in the open.\n\nFor the last four years I would cross the parking lot to the trail head at the Visitors Center by walking across the dry Carmel River bed. Not today! Hallelujah – the temporary footbridge has been removed for the winter – Carmel River is flowing. This may also have had something to do with the removal of the San Clemente Dam last year. But whatever the cause the muddy water was a beautiful sight.\n\nThis mornings 3 mile hike is moderate in level with about 3 climbs totaling around 360 feet in elevation.\n\nThere are a number of sets of stairs cut into the side of the hill and a few areas where the path narrows to about 2 feet with a drop off into the canyon below.\n\nSo keep that in mind when setting out on this hike.\n\nFrom the Visitors Center head south following the\n\npath toward Lupine Loop and Waterfall Trail.\n\nMarch is still early in the wildflower season so spotting new flowers takes a keen eye in the low meadow area.\n\nLupines are few and far between right now but the tiny Filaree, both Red and White-stemmed were prevalent. They just aren’t as showy as the Lupine.\n\nI turned right heading toward the hills following the Lupine Loop. I did manage to spot a patch of Fiesta Flowers\n\nand nice spread\n\nof Padre Shooting Star\n\nbefore taking a left at the fork toward Rumsen Grinding Rock.\n\nAt this part of the hike, the path narrows, you are starting to make your climb to the waterfall.\n\nWatch for low hanging trees\n\nand loose rocks.\n\nAnd the periodic crazy dog that comes out\n\nof nowhere off lease running ever\n\nso nimbly on the edge of the path.\n\nThe Waterfall trail has a few treats for me,\n\na Giant Trillium,\n\nand Globe Lilly camouflaged\n\namong the firms.\n\nIn the distance I can hear the waterfall.\n\nI cross the footbridge,\n\nascend a flight of stairs,\n\nthen what do my wandering eyes should appear but\n\nthe heretofore rumored waterfall.\n\nIt is not quite Yosemite Falls, but it is our waterfall. And having had this dry for four years, it is quite a sight.\n\nThis is normally a good turn around point but I decided to push further another half mile to a point in the Waterfall trail which offers a filtered view of the Carmel Valley below.\n\nHappy with the opportunity to hike between the storms I decided to error on the side of caution and head back before the next rain came.\n\nUntil next time. Happy Adventures!!!!\n\n___\n\nPhotography and video – L. A. Momboisse\n\nFacebook Adventures of A Home Town Tourist\n\nYouTube Adventures of A Home Town Tourist\n\nStandard"
