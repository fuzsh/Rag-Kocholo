        "text": "It was the fourth straight day on the practice fields in South Philly Wednesday, and predictably it was a lighter one — with QB1 Jalen Hurts throwing just 15 passes in competitive drills.\n\nAs we do after every Eagles' training camp practice, here's a look at everything the first team offense did as the year's first preseason game approaches Friday:\n\n7-on-7 at opponent's 40-yard line\n\nPlay 1: Hurts dumps the ball to DeVonta Smith in the flat for a gain of two yards.\n\nPlay 2: A pass is seemingly completed to rookie Johnny Wilson, who has the ball poked loose by Zach Baun very shortly after.\n\nPlay 3: Joseph Ngata with a rare reception with the first team. The crossing route nets a first down.\n\nMORE EAGLES\n\nEagles release first depth chart of the 2024 season\n\nEagles 2024 training camp practice notes, Day 9: A.J. Brown can run a slant\n\nEagles 2024 training camp battle tracker\n\nPlay 4: A short pass to Kenny Gainwell picks up five yards.\n\nPlay 5: With lots of time (and no pass rush thanks to the 7-on-7 format), Hurts uncorks a high spiral toward the end zone. Grant Calcaterra makes the concentration reception in the end zone for an impressive touchdown in coverage.\n\nPlay 6: Wilson makes the catch this time, picking up five yards.\n\n11-on-11 at 50-yard line\n\nPlay 7: A play-action keeper that would likely have been little to no gain with actual tackling.\n\nPlay 8: A really nice route from Calcaterra over the middle picks up at least 20 yards.\n\nPlay 9: A shotgun handoff to Saquon Barkley picks up a few yards.\n\nPlay 10: In what would likely have been a coverage sack if there were live hitting, Jordan Davis and Baun pressure Hurts in the pocket.\n\nPlay 11: A scramble goes for a first down with a wide open lane in front of Hurts.\n\nPlay 12: A really slick cut from A.J. Brown gets him open on a quick comeback route for five yards.\n\n11-on-11 at opponent’s 20-yard line\n\nPlay 13: Patient in the pocket, Hurts fires the ball to an open Dallas Goedert for a touchdown.\n\nPlay 14: Hurts with the rare bad throw, he misses a well-covered Brown in the back left corner of the end zone. It's slightly overthrown.\n\nPlay 15: A designed QB keeper picks up seven yards.\n\nPlay 16: A Gainwell run gets minimal yardage.\n\nPlay 17: Hurts again overthrows Brown, in the same part of the end zone for an incompletion.\n\nSituation: 3rd and 5 at opponent’s 44-yard line\n\nPlay 18: Head coach Nick Sirianni calls out a scenario, and Hurts converts the first down as Smith slithers to the middle of the field and catches an easy pass.\n\n11-on-11 at opponent 30-yard line\n\nPlay 19: A hand-off to Barkley gains little.\n\nPlay 20: Smith catches a pass over the middle in traffic for seven yards. He's a bit unhappy afterwards, as Nakobe Dean unintentionally tackles him to the ground.\n\nPlay 21: A pretty good pass is fired Ngata's way, but Darius Slay is with him step for step and breaks it up.\n\nPlay 22: The last play for the first team is a sideline completion to Brown for first down yardage.\n\nIt wasn't Hurts' best, but it certainly was not his worst either as a solid 11-for-15 day — with two touchdowns — end a long week on the field at training camp.\n\nFollow Evan on Twitter:@evan_macy"
