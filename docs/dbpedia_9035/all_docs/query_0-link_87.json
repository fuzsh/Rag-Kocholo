        "text": "Scott Barnes has secured the Master Shifter title in the Skusa Superkarts USA Pro Tour after a successful weekend in Indiana.\n\nHeading into the final round second overall, the 39-year-old Bermudian karter had a great three days at New Castle Motorsports Park.\n\n“We wrapped it up with a sweep of Saturday’s round five,” Barnes told The Royal Gazette.\n\n“We had pole in qualifying, pre-final win and finals win. In Sunday’s round six, we only had to race for fun; the championship was locked in. We came second in pre-final and second in the final.\n\n“I just want to thank my sponsors, Butterfield & Vallis; their sponsorship helps me a lot. I would also like to thank another guy from Bermuda, Jeff Sousa. He was doing my mechanical work through the weekend.”\n\nBarnes, who races for Maranello Kart USA, is now gearing up for the annual Skusa SuperNationals, the “Super Bowl of karting”. He has a had a packed season since signing for his new team at the start of the year, after three years with the Ohio-based Magic Kart USA.\n\n“The season’s over now and they have the grand finale in November,’’ he said. “That’s a huge event with drivers from all around the world, so we’re looking forward to going to that.\n\n“It’s been a very busy season. We did ten weekends and we have four more planned for the rest of the year.\n\n“I signed for a new team at the beginning of the year and they signed us up for 14 or 15 races for this season. We had a lot of international events this year, which was awesome.\n\n“I have been racing against mostly guys from the US, but for the event in Las Vegas, there will be drivers from all over the world. There will probably be 50 drivers in the class from around the world.\n\n“That’s one of the biggest karting events in the world and definitely the biggest karting event in the US.”"
