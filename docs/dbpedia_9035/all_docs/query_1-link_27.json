        "text": "I attended Louisiana Tech University and Grambling State University, where I earned a Bachelor of Science Degree in Elementary Education, as well as my Louisiana and Texas teaching certification in 1996 for grades (EC-4) and (1-8). After teaching third grade for three and one-half years at Grambling State University Laboratory School, my wife Amanda and I moved to Terrell, Texas. I served in many roles there, including third and fourth grade teacher, elementary and high school assistant principal, Head Start Director, and assistant basketball and baseball coach. During my time in Terrell ISD, I received my Masters of Education Degree in Mid-Management, as well as my Texas principal certification from Texas A&M Commerce in 2011.\n\nAfter fourteen years in Terrell I was blessed with the opportunity to serve two years as principal of the Clarksville Middle & High School campuses, located in Clarksville, Texas. After relocating back to the Dallas area in 2016, I secured a third-grade teaching position at George Washington Carver Elementary School here in Garland ISD. The following school year I was hired as an assistant principal at Coyle. This year I will oversee 6th grade, CTE, PE/Athletics, and History/Social Studies. This will be the start of my 27th year in education, with this being my 8th at Coyle Technology Center for Math & Science.\n\nI have been married to my beautiful wife of 27 years, Amanda, who is also an administrator in another district. We have two awesome children who add so much joy to our lives. Madison recently graduated from Grambling State University in May of 2024, and Maddox is currently a sophomore at North Garland High School.\n\nI look forward to helping all of our students and families find success on their journey here at Coyle Tech!\n\nI attended Kent State University for my Bachelors degree and Texas A&M Commerce for both my Masters and Doctorate. I was a coach and History teacher prior to becoming and administrator. My leadership experience began in the classroom, as I was a department head, I was a campus athletic coordinator and a head coach for track and field. I have also been a campus administrator at both middle and high school. I have also spent time at the central office level in Student Services.\n\nI have been in education for 31yrs. I have spent time in 3 different school districts over the course of that time, the last 17 in GISD. I have 3 wonderful children McKenzie 28, Jace 19, and Greyson 9. I also have an amazing woman and partner in my life whose name is Rachel! I am an avid hunter, sports fan, lover of music and trivia, a good book and thoughtful poem. My parents tell me that I am a bit of a renaissance man, I enjoy having DIY projects and solving problems, working with both my mind and my hands. I am looking forward to all the great things happening at Coyle and excited to be a part of the future. Go Cougars!!"
