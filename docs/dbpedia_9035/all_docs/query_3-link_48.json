        "text": "Parliamentary Networks and Country Groups fortify our relationships with foreign parliaments around the world through engagement with their parliamentarians as well as members of the diplomatic community. This work is integral to our overall international engagement.\n\nAustralian Parliament maintains 11 parliamentary networks. These groupings are devised from the United Nations composition of macro-geographical (continental) regions.\n\nWhere there is significant interest within the parliament of a particular country, an individual country group may be established within their regional network. However, networks are responsible for all countries within their region â€“ not solely countries which achieve an individual country group.\n\nParliamentary Networks and their established corresponding Country Groups are outlined below."
