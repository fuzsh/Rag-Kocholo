        "text": "Garland, city, Dallas county, northern Texas, U.S. Adjacent to Dallas (west), it was founded in 1887, when two rival railroad communities, Duck Creek and Embree, were consolidated by an act of the U.S. Congress and named for Attorney General Augustus H. Garland. In May 1927 a tornado destroyed much of the city and killed 17 people. (Texas—along with portions of Kansas, Oklahoma, and Nebraska—lies within a tornado-prone area known as Tornado Alley.)\n\nGarland’s economy is industrialized and supplemented by the farm crops grown on the nearby Blacklands Belt. A wide variety of manufactures includes electronic equipment, chemicals, and scientific instruments; a popular brand of cowboy hat is also manufactured in the city. Inc. 1891. Pop. (2010) 226,876; (2020) 246,018."
