        "text": "Reece Britt has heard rumors that the Fairvue course at Tennessee Grasslands Golf and Country Club has a full complement of 18 holes. But the Maryville native wouldn’t know, as he has yet to experience anything beyond No. 15 through the first two days of the 25th Tennessee Match Play Championship.\n\nThe senior golfer at Austin Peay made quick work of his three pool play matches, winning by margins of 4&3 and 7&5 on Tuesday then continuing his solid play on Wednesday with a 5&4 win over Kaiser Godinez to earn a spot in the Round of 16 matches that commence Thursday.\n\nEight other golfers went undefeated in their trio of pool matches to advance, while seven pools required a playoff to determine their qualifier.\n\nKeoni Vidrine of Ooltewah found himself 2-down after two holes in his match against Matt Mitchell of Burns and the match was tied after 10 holes. But Vidrine sealed the win with a birdie on No. 16 to win, 2 up, and remain unbeaten in his pool.\n\nJeff Reuter put together three solid rounds that failed to go the distance, winning each one by comfortable 4&3 margins to advance the Humboldt resident. Meanwhile, Knoxville’s Jack Smith birdied No. 16 to go 1-up in his match with Nashville’s Jackson Bechtol, then sealed the 2-up victory with an eagle on the par 5 closing hole to go 3-0 in pool play.\n\nOthers who had perfect results in their pool matches were College Grove’s Grant Clark, Caleb Tipton of Elizabethton, Chris Barron of Hendersonville, Winston Margaritis of Germantown and Church Hill’s Lucas Armstrong, who birdied 18 for his 1-up win to remain perfect.\n\nAmong the matches that required a playoff, it took Jake Eickhoff four additional holes to seal his berth in the round of 16 over fellow Nashville resident Jaron Leasure, atoning a 2&1 loss to Leasure in Tuesday’s pool play.\n\nMurfreesboro’s Spencer Provow, the 2007 Match Play champion, had a similar measure of retribution with Jackson’s Trace Robinson. Robinson bested Provow, 5&3, in their opening match on Tuesday, but Provow captured the berth by eliminating Robinson on the second playoff hole.\n\nLuke Beadles of Nolensville won his pool on the opening hole of his playoff against Jacob Garland. Minutes earlier, Garland birdied No. 17 to defeat Beadles, 2&1, in their pool match to force the sudden death showdown.\n\nGrant Leaver of Murfreesboro won his pool playoff on the second hole against Nashville’s Lucas Herring after the pair tied their match on Tuesday. Rosario Falzone of Nashville moved on in his pool by ousting Franklin’s Coleman Jones on the second playoff hole, having defeated Jones 5&3 earlier in the day in their final pool match.\n\nAfter their head-to-head match on Tuesday ended in a tie, Grant Milling of Nashville needed only one extra hole to claim his entry into bracket play by downing Lee Maxwell.\n\nBen Blackburn, who downed defending champion Cooper Hayes, 1 up, in their Tuesday encounter, won his playoff on the second hole against Michael Hake on Wednesday after they had tied their opening pool match.\n\nThe Round of 16 matches will be followed by the afternoon quarterfinals on Thursday, while Friday will feature the semifinals and the championship match.\n\nFor complete results go to Tennessee Match Play results\n\nPaul Payne can be emailed at paulpayne6249@gmail.com\n\nWednesday’s Results\n\nPool 1: Michael Hake (Brentwood) def.
