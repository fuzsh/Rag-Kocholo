        "text": "A man is in custody and another man is wanted in connection with a home invasion robbery last month in Garland that ended with two suspects fatally shot, police say.\n\nIn a news release Tuesday, Garland Police detailed the March 18 break-in and shooting between four intruders and a resident inside an apartment on the 4300 block of North Garland Avenue.\n\nAccording to police, four men forced their way into an apartment unit at the Woodlands at the Preserve complex at about 2:30 a.m. and began shooting at the person who lives there.\n\nThe resident returned fire to defend himself, police said. Two of the intruders, identified as 27-year-old Terrail Moore of Dallas and 28-year-old Darrian Lowery of Mesquite, died in the gun battle.\n\nOn March 29, detectives arrested a third suspect, identified as 26-year-old Desmond Whitaker of Dallas. He is held Tuesday in the Dallas County Jail with a $1 million bond.\n\nPolice are asking for the public's help finding the fourth suspect, identified as 22-year-old Williams Wilson of Dallas.\n\nBoth Wilson and Whitaker will be charged with capital murder because they are accused of attempting to commit a felony which resulted in the death of Moore and Lowery, police said."
