Garland Wilson was named the Director of Basketball Operations for Jay Ladner's inaugural Golden Eagle staff in May 2019.

As the Director of Operations, Wilson is in charge of organization and administration of the basketball program.

Wilson served the last three seasons as the director of basketball operations at Southeastern, where he supervised team travel, player personnel, basketball camps and other facets of the program.

"Garland Wilson is a coach with a lot of experience in operations," Ladner said. "He's my right-hand man and keeps me organized. I was honored to work with him at Southeastern Louisiana. Having someone with his experience not just from operations but from working with me personally shortens our learning curve here."

Wilson previously served as director basketball operations at Jacksonville State University in Jacksonville, Ala. from 2012-16. He was also a graduate assistant coach at Jacksonville State from January to May 2012 and the programâ€™s head equipment manager from 2004-09.

"I'm excited to be here," Wilson said. "I've worked with Coach Ladner in the past, and he had enough confidence to bring me here with him. It's great to be at a higher level and continue to learn more things and help our program anyway I can."

He received a Master's in Sport Management from Southern Miss in June of 2020. Wilson received a Bachelor of Science degree with a concentration in business marketing from Jacksonville State in 2009.
