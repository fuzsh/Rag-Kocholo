She won several awards for her commercials, and in 2000 she founded her own production company, Miss Wasabi Films.\n\nHer debut as a screenwriter and director was in 1989 with Too Old to Die Young, nominated for Best New Director at the Goya Awards. In 1996 she made her first film in English, Things I Never Told You. Her international success came in 2003 with the intimate drama My Life Without Me, with Sarah Polley in the lead role, with whom she worked again two years later in The Secret Life of Words, winner of four Goyas.\n\nIn addition to her vast filmography, she has also made outstanding documentaries such as Invisibles, Marea Blanca, Talking about Rose, and Listening to Judge Garzón ( Goya for Best Documentary) and the recent The Yellow Ceiling.\n\nIn 2009 she received the Gold Medal in Fine Arts, awarded by the Spanish Ministry of Culture and Sports, and in 2015 the Chevalier des arts et des lettres Medal, awarded by the French Ministry of Culture.
