An oil rig, where all the workers are men, on which there has been an accident. A solitary, mysterious woman who is trying to forget her past (Sarah Polley) is brought to the rig to look after a man (Tim Robbins) who has been temporarily blinded. A strange intimacy develops between them, a link full of secrets, truths, lies, humour and pain, from which neither of them will emerge unscathed and which will change their lives forever. A film about the weight of the past. About the sudden silence that is produced before a storm. About twenty-five million waves, a Spanish cook (Javier Cámara) and a goose. And, above all else, about the power of love even in the most terrible circumstances..\n\nFrom director Isabel Coixet\n\nImport DVD\n\nPAL Region 2\n\nAnamorphic Widescreen\n\nEnglish DD 5.1 Audio\n\nTrailer\n\nCast\n\nFilm credits\n\nFilmographies\n\nWeight 5 oz\n\nRelated products\n\nBrowse All Titles\n\nBag Attack DVD (PAL Region 2)\n\n$23.99 Add to cart\n\nBrowse All Titles\n\nSeptic DVD (PAL Region 2)\n\n$23.99 Add to cart"
