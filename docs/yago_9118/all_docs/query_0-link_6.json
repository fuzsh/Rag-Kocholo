        "text": "Two years after My Life Without Me (which I truly enjoyed), director Coixet and lead actress Sarah Polley reunites for The Secret Life of Words. And with their last work together in mind, there's no doubt I had expectations going into this one.\n\nIt's no secret I'm a huge fan of Polley, and while I haven't dipped too deep into her filmography (yet!), I can't remember a single movie where her performance haven't helped. That girl is so bloody talented, and I'm really happy about the kind of roles she chooses as well. There's always something challenging or interesting about them.\n\nThis is slow, subtle and with a rough beauty to it, and in some ways I'm reminded of Von…\n\nReally bad! Perpetually tied to the era of mid 2000s snoozefests where they seemingly couldn't find a tripod and everything's shot in shallow focus nonsense, and the story's just a bullshit script about overcoming trauma through vague interrogation, a film begging you to believe theres a ounce of depth when all its vague poeticism is portrayed through voiceover, when its characters suffering is never meaningfully portrayed in how haunting the horrors of war are, so when its finally revealed it falls flat on its face, a film where blossoming connection is shown as sexual harassment. Try’s to show us how 2 lonely people can bond over trauma, but we’re never shown how trauma has lived with them because they aren't…\n\nWhat can I say? There are really no words to describe what this movie does. At heart Sarah Polley carries the amazing story of a woman who does her best to become invisible yet is found by an injured, blinded man (played by a surprisingly excellent Tim Robbins). The lines spoken in the penultimate scene - \"If I start crying I'm afraid I won't stop and then the room will fill up with tears\" - just about broke me.\n\nAmazing cinematography since the film is shot mostly on a derelict oil rig in the North Sea (I think it's the North Sea)."
