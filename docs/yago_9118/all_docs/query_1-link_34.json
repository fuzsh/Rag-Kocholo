        "text": "A film festival is often the first place directors will introduce their new babies to the public. This is no stroll in the park, with baby dressed in new finery and compliments expected, even if baby has no hair yet or is fussy and irritable. No, a film festival, especially one such as the Berlinale, is a critical place. Sometimes, the critics are kind and even enthusiastic. Sometimes, baby is booed off the stage. And other times, questions are asked and constructive critiques offered. Baby needs a few changes and all will be well, the critics suggest.\n\nAnd this is what happened to Nobody Wants the Night.\n\nFirst change: A new title. So now the film is Endless Night. That works fine.\n\nSecond change: A new voice-over by Juliette Binoche, who plays Josephine Peary in the film. This makes sense. There was a voice-over in the original film provided by a male character. Having Josephine Peary tell the story seems appropriate.\n\nThird change: The film is re-cut. Think of this as baby’s new clothes.\n\nFourth change: A new poster (although they really should have placed the corresponding names over the images of the actors, don’t you think? Otherwise: confusion).\n\nFifth change: A new trailer. There is definitely more Gabriel Byrne in the new trailer, so that’s a good thing!\n\nFinal change: A new distributor.\n\nVoilà! New baby, ready for screening.\n\nHere are the details from Screen Daily:\n\nUK sales outfit Metro International has taken over sales rights from Elle Driver to a refashioned version of Isabel Coixet’s Berlinale opener Nobody Wants The Night.\n\nThe film is understood to have been “significantly” cut by the filmmakers and now includes a voiceover narrated by the film’s star Juliette Binoche.\n\nMetro described the new version as “a leaner, revitalized final cut.”\n\nThese changes seem to have done the trick. New baby, now leaner and meaner, received much praise at its outing at the Valladolid Film Festival in Spain last fall, where it won four Goya awards.\n\nAnd now baby seems to be poised to go international. Yay!\n\nKudos to director Isabel Coixet and her editing crew for taking such care with her baby and getting past the initial critical hurdles.\n\nAs noted, Metro Films International has taken over distribution of the film and you can find more information on their website.\n\nnew poster\n\nnew trailer\n\nThe new trailer is available but, for some odd reason, it cannot be embedded here in this posting. You can watch it on Vimeo. Do so now! It is really good.\n\nnew trailer screencaps\n\nAs more news becomes available, you will see it here, of course. Let’s continue to hope for an international release for this intriguing film! heart"
