        "text": "Posted on December 16, 2010 By Léopold Lambert\n\nThe secret life of words by Isabel Coixet is a beautiful film that take place on a offshore oil rig situated in the West of Ireland. The rig’s characteristic is to combine the ship’s language with an obvious link to the ground and therefore the island’s static aspect. Foucault’s favorite example of heterotopia is the one of the ship probably in a historicist concern, nevertheless the rig has the advantage not to imply any arrival that would not depend on the human when the oil rig implies an entrance and an exist that are absolutely dependent to the considered character.\n\nThe small basketball field and the swings on the deck definitely participates to the sedentary aspect of the territory itself.Thanks Ethel !"
