        "text": "Conception by racist pack rape kept secret for more than 30 years; rape as war crime kept secret for more than 50 years; a doctor sexual ly abusing a five year old; child abuse within a family. Silence is a ubiquitous by-p roduct of traumatic crime. And when the subjects of such crime finally decide to s peak, the interview process itself can be a traumatising experience. And then, the han dling of information by the journalist, particularly in long form narrative, is integral to that experience. Contextualising these narratives within the genre o f literary journalism, this paper is an exploration of professional practice when dealin g with traumatic memory in subjects. The paper will draw on interviews which f orm part of a manuscript of creative non-fiction entitled Speaking Secrets . This paper argues for a greater discussion within t he academy of empathy as a tool of journalism, rather than a notion regarded by most a s anathema to the industry. It argues that empathy must and...\n\nThis article assesses the implications of listening in the context of the commemoration of a massacre perpetrated in 2000 by paramilitaries in the Colombian Caribbean region Los Montes de María and the subsequent displacement of the survivors from their land. Forced displacement is understood as a process of silencing when it is compared with torture. In forced displacement, as in torture, suffering is inflicted upon the victims to erase their voice, their self, their world. Simultaneously, the voice of the torturer and his regime, his world, is imposed over the victim. While I use this comparison as a conceptual bridge, rather than an absolute equation of the two, I argue that what is at stake in both forced displacement and torture is the capacity to live, perpetuate and recreate a meaningful world. I propose, therefore, that doing justice in the context of forced displacement requires a project of an ethics for listening in which it is necessary to understand voice as an actualisation of a ‘life-world’. Listening implies, then, to remain open to learn from and be changed by the speaker.\n\nThis article analyses several notable examples of what the author calls the post-Yugoslav women’s cinema of trauma. These films made by women filmmakers challenge the standard tropes of war, as well as normative approaches to war cinema, by highlighting the intimate affective domain of experience, rather than large-scale narratives and collective emotions. The author focuses on the near-silent short and experimental works of Una Gunjak and Šejla Kamerić (both from Bosnia-Herzegovina), and suggests that they offer insightful formal and narrative ways of rethinking the question of what makes a war film, as well as what constitutes a woman’s experience of war. By arguing for a continued, strategic and locally specific use of the term women’s cinema, the author deploys feminist analytics towards inscribing these filmmakers’ work into the transnational flows of knowledge production about marginalized groups and non-Western geographies.\n\nThe article considers Pat Collins's feature length debut Silence (2012) as a film concerned with responses to trauma. Opening with a definition of epistemology and film-imaging as framing, the article then focuses these concerns around language or language-use. A parallel is then drawn between the thematising of \" silence \" around the journey of the protagonist (Eoghan) in Silence and \" silence \" as thematised in the final proposition of Ludwig Wittgenstein's Tractatus (1922). This parallel is used to explore an obligation, perceived as coming to prominence in the course of Eoghan's journey, to resist the desire to frame the experience of trauma; resistance defined by an ethics of \" silence. \" The article's middle section develops this discussion of ethics to explore the \" window \" as a visual motif in Silence (considered pertinent to reading the ethical), arguing that this motif gives the perceived obligation to remain silent (in the case of Eoghan's journey home in the film), to resist framing, a crucially aesthetic context. The final section addresses these issues in the wider sense of the film as an allegory on Ireland; concerned with accepting the limitations of language regarding the traumatic or the experience of trauma.\n\nThis article analyzes representations of female Wars on Terror witnesses by Helen Benedict and Lynsey Addario. In their narratives of U.S. soldiers and Arab refugee lives, both criticize effects of (counter-)terrorist warfare and argue for transcultural compassion. Benedict’s documentary novel Sand Queen (2011) unsettles the categories of Oriental terrorist and U.S. hero, as a military sexual assault survivor and an Iraqi refugee interact. Journalistic photographs from Addario’s series for The New York Times (“Women at War”; 2010) and National Geographic (“Veiled Rebellion”; 2010) document the suffering experienced by female soldiers and civilians. These counter dominant Wars on Terror discourses by complicating the gender stereotypes underwriting the U.S. defense melodrama and its anti-colonial resistance. Through field research, including interviews, Benedict and Addario strive toward “authentic” reports of war, but their documentary aesthetics anticipate receptions that sensationalize pain and commodify colonial power asymmetries. This article also asks if demanding that subaltern woman testify to oppression commemorates depoliticized compassion or further precludes the participation of “others” from political spheres.\n\nThis paper seeks to look at the ethical issues inherent in the space of representation with regard to trauma narratives specifically looking at witness testimonies that speak or are trying to speak about an event/events on camera. Using Jacques Lacan’s understanding of trauma as the “missed encounter” I look at the documentary Inshallah Kashmir, that explores the situation in Kashmir, to question and investigate the traumatic effects of gaps, ruptures, silences that putting a camera by an outsider, with power, in such a field produces within representation. If trauma, according to Lacan, inhabits the field of the unrepresentable and the unspeakable then what are we as spectators, as the other, being allowed to see, what are we being allowed to hear and what is it that becomes inaccessible? How does the filmmaker then, standing in a position of power, through his own voice and control over visual representation, use the difficulties inherent in the speaking of trauma to render his own interpretation of the event as the only true interpretation, an interpretation that then produces the conditions that keep the status quo rendering the frame itself complicit in the perpetuation of violence? I will also do this by exploring the insider/outsider binary through a reading of 5 Broken Cameras, a documentary based on footage shot by a resident of Bil`in which saw a Palestinian resistance to Israeli occupation. Looking for an ethical way of addressing of trauma in visual practice I use Judith Butler’s work on images of Abu Ghraib and the idea of circulation, of images, as resisting official narratives to read images/sounds/music that exist elsewhere, made by witnesses impacted on by the violence, and which circulate as testimonies, as evidence, as readings of the events that make up Kashmir. These will be explored as an attempt to come as close to retelling trauma as is possible through the use of different kinds of visual and sound practices.\n\nThis paper performs, in three movements, an exploration of the ethics not of torture itself but of writing it creatively. First movement: of the right to write. This first movement considers ethical questions of authorship in the fictional narration of the trauma of torture. It employs Giorgio Agamben’s work on biopower and testimony to position the act of writing creatively about torture in relation to torture’s political project and the subjection of the body to sovereign power, along with a reading of torture as affective encounter, to suggest the necessity of writing literary testimony to it. Second movement: of writing the torturer’s voice. The second movement draws on Deleuzian affect theory to articulate a relational conception of this trauma that suggests, however distasteful, the need for the torturer’s voice to be heard beyond the torture chamber. Third movement: of being affected by unjust ethics. This third movement draws on concepts of affective contagion to gestures back towards the experience of being affected by writing unjust ethics. With their twists and turns, their connections and discontinuities, these movements navigate – necessarily incompletely – the messy complexities of the ethical space of voice in the writing torture."
