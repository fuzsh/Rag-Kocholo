        "text": "30-year-old Nat escapes from her stressful life in the city and settles in a rundown house in rural Spain. Having worked as a translator of refugees seeking asylum in Europe, she bears the collateral damage of her work within her soul. Nat needs to put her life back on track. But her bad-tempered sexist landlord, a suspiciously overhelpful would-be artist, and the happy young married couple next door only fuel her feeling feeble and alienated. When a stormy night leaves her rented house almost unlivable and her landlord becomes adamant about doing nothing about it, Nat finds herself giving in to a disturbing proposal from her bearish and taciturn handyman neighbor, Andreas. This encounter will give rise to an all-consuming passion that will completely transform Nat. Adapted from a bestselling novel and with the riveting performances of Goya Award winner actress Laia Costa (Lullaby) as Nat and San Sebastian award-winner actor Hovik Keuchkerian (Amerikatsi) as Andreas, acclaimed Spanish writer-director Isabel Coixet (The Secret Life of Words, The Bookshop) and co-writer Laura Ferrero offer an unsettling but absorbing tale on the idea of love—of self and others—about the existential doubt, the role of being a woman, and the transformative power of acting upon one’s earnest desires.\n\n—Hebe Tabachnik"
