Father Earl was born in 1913, inDetroit, Mich., son of Louis and Anna Ullman; brother of Ruth,Hazel and Chester. He attended Our Lady of Sorrows ElementaryCatholic School before entering Sacred Heart Seminary in Detroit.After he completed his high school and college at Sacred Heart heentered Mount St. Mary’s Seminary in Cincinnati, Ohio, where hecompleted his studies for the priesthood on June 11, 1938, bybishop Edward Mooney for the Diocese of Detroit.\n\nHis first priestly assignments in the Diocese of Detroit from1938-44 included St. Mary Magdalene Hazel park and Our Lady of theRosary, Detroit where he served as an assistant pastor. In 1944, hetransferred to the Diocese of San Diego serving first at Our Ladyof Angeles Church in San Diego as an assistant pastor until Nov.15, 1946.\n\nOn Oct. 9, 1946, Fr. Earl was incardinated into the Diocese of SanDiego, which led the way for his first assignment as parishadministrator to St. Mary’s in Escondido on Nov. 15, 1946. Heserved the faithful of this parish until July 1949. From there hewent on to serve as administrator of St. Mary Magdalene, Jacumba(1947-49), and Blessed Sacrament, Descanso (1949-51). He wasappointed for short terms as an assistant pastor in St. CharlesBoromeo, San Diego (1951), St. George, Ontario (1951-53) and St.Margaret, Chino (53).\n\nBishop Charles F.

Earl aspastor to St. Francis of Assisi, where he served for 10 years untilhis retirement on Nov. 1, 1978.\n\nWhile as pastor of St. Francis he saw the need to build a biggerchurch as the Catholic population of Vista continued to growquickly in North County. In 1973, the new church was dedicated.More importantly than building a new church building through his 62years of priestly ministry he built up the church as the Body ofChrist through his preaching and pastoral care of God’s people.\n\nIn 1978, he asked for retirement because he was beginning to losehis hearing. Though his hearing loss was great he was always tunedinto the word of God, which was most evident in his preaching andthe manner in which he treated those who would seek him out. Theparishioners from his beloved St. Francis Church continued to reachout to him in his later years by bringing him daily meals to hishome. At first he said no because he did not wish to be a burden tothem. Little did he know that by bringing him his daily meal he washelping them to carry their burdens in life by his gentle andwelcoming spirit of love. The faithful of St. Francis looked uponhim as the grandfather of the parish. Indeed, he was a grand man, agrand priest and the grand Father Earl Ullman.\n\nA vigil service will be at 7 p.m. today, March 22, at St. FrancisCatholic Church in Vista. A Mass will be celebrated at 1 p.m.Friday, March 23, at St. Francis Catholic Church.
