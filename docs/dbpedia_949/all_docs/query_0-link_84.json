Ames settled originally at New York (1843) and came to Ocean Springs circa 1845 where he made his livelihood as a collier (charcoal maker). Ames secured land patents in 1847 and 1848 from the United States Government on one hundred-twenty acres of land in the SE/4 of Section 19, T7S-R8W.\n\nThis parcel of land, known in the past as the \"Ames Tract\", was bounded on the north by the south line of the SW/4 of the NE/4 of Section 19 (which strikes east-west through the southern one-third of the Evergreen Cemetery) and a line south of Iberville through the Spring Plaza Shopping Center, west by a line projecting from Government through Blount to Fort Bayou, south by Government, and east by a line from Government to the east side of the Spring Plaza Shopping Center. Oddly, Ames Avenue is just west of the original Ames Tract.\n\nProbably, the first baseball park at Ocean Springs, called the \"Baseball Green\" was located on a part of the Ames Tract. It was 763 feet by 363 feet (6.36 acres) and located west of present day Germaine's Restaurant. Captain Antoine Bellande (1829-1918) purchased the tract from James Stranby of New Orleans in November 1873. It later became known as Veillon's Ball Diamond after Mrs. Henrietta Hyde Veillon (d. 1920) bought it from Bellande in May 1913.(JXCO, Ms. Land Deed Bk. 39, pp. 208-210 and Bk. 39, pp. 328-329)\n\nDr. Henry Bradford Powell (1867-1949), a Canadian physician and inn keeper, operated a four hole golf course here in 1910. The links were short lived as Powell with A.E. Lee (1874-1936) and George E. Arndt (1857-1945) developed the Ocean Springs Country Club on the Rose-Money Farm north of Fort Bayou in 1914.\n\nJohn Ames and his wife, Helen (1814-1874) reared four children at Ocean Springs: Thomas Ames (1843-1906), Elizabeth Ames (1845-1917), William Ames (1848-1922), and Jeremiah Ames (1852-pre 1922).\n\nThomas Ames (1843-1906), the eldest child, was born at New York. He made his livelihood as a carpenter. At the time of his demise on June 30, 1906, he was employed by the Dantzler Lumber Company at its Cedar Lake Camp in Harrison County. It is believed that Thomas Ames never married.\n\nElizabeth Ames (1845-1917) called Eliza was the first Ames child born at Ocean Springs. Her younger days were filled with acts of heroism and works of charity which entitle her to a prominent niche in the history of Ocean Springs. In October 1878, the dreaded \"yellow jack\" struck the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Miss Eliza Ames and her brothers led the small brave corps who nursed the sick and buried the dead. They often worked day and night without pay or hope of reward.\n\nIn 1884, Miss Eliza Ames sold the lot adjacent to the Public Cemetery to Bishop Francis Janssens, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Natchez. At this time, this burial ground was known as the Catholic Cemetery. Later, the Public and Catholic Cemetery were called collectively the Evergreen Cemetery.\n\nIn 1900, Eliza Ames was the proprietress of a hotel or boarding house probably the ancestral Ames home located on the east side of Cemetery Road (now Sunset). By 1910, she had retired from the business world. Miss Eliza Ames died in January 1917.\n\nAfter the Augustus von Rosambeau Store and home on Jackson at Calhoun were destroyed by fire on November 13, 1917, Leo von Rosambeau (1883-1931) and a group of workmen tore down Miss Ames's residence. The lumber from that ancient structure was utilized to build the new von Rosambeau home at 420 Jackson Avenue. Thomas Gautier and his family reside here today.\n\nWilliam Ames (1848-1922) married Mary Lux. They had at least two children: Giordina Beatrice Ames (b. 1885) and Thomas Alexander Ames (b. 1888). They left Ocean Springs to reside at Bay St. Louis where he may have worked for the railroad. William Ames died there in September 1922.\n\nJeremiah M. Ames (1852-pre 1922) married Louisa Monti (1856-1925), the daughter of Giacomo Monti (1820-1891) and Rosa Lendre Bacchi. They married on January 15, 1876 in Bay St. Louis at Our Lady of the Gulf. He made his livelihood initially as a merchant (1880) and later with the L&N Railroad as a bridge builder (1900). Jerry and Louisa Ames reared a large family at Ocean Springs. Their children were: Theodore J. Ames (1876-1927), Helen Rose Ames (b. 1878), William Thomas Ames (1880-1969), Emma Louise Williams Ames (b. 1882), Floyd Ames (1885-1969+), Allen Monti Ames (1888-1963), Westley Ames (b. 1890), and Mabel Veronica Ames (b. 1896). (Lepre, 1995, p. 263)\n\nChildren of Jeremiah M. Ames\n\nTheodore J. Ames (1876-1927), known as Ted, married Carrie Seymour (1889-1979), the daughter of Narcisse Seymour (1849-1931) and Caroline Virginia Krohn (1847-1895). In 1904, Ames operated a livery stable behind the Commercial Hotel on Robinson. He later moved into a metal building further east nearer Cash Alley.\n\nIn the early part of this Century, Ted Ames functioned as the director of the Ocean Springs Brass Band. In 1918, During WW I, he served with U.S. Army at Camp Wheeler, Georgia where he was a member of the 123rd Infantry Band. When Ted Ames returned from his military service, he worked as a railroad carpenter (1920). Later Ames was the caretaker of Captain Alex L. Bisso's home (Terrace Hill) at 414 Martin. He and Miss Carrie lived at present day 1108 Calhoun (the Centennial House) where their only child, a son, Kenneth Ames (1923-1987), was born. Kenneth Ames appears to have been the last male Ames left at Ocean Springs.\n\nWilliam Thomas Ames (1880-1969) was born at Ocean Springs, Mississippi on September 4, 1880. His father, Jeremiah Ames (1852- circa 1920) was a first generation American of Irish parentage, and his mother Louisa Monti (1856-1925) from Bay St. Louis was the daughter of Giacomo Monti (1820-1891) and Rosa Lendre Bacchi. Jerry Ames made his livelihood initially as a merchant (1880) and later with the L&N Railroad as a bridge builder (1900). Mrs. Ames had eight children of which six were living in 1900. They were: Theodore J. Ames (1876- 1927), Helen Rose Ames (b. 1878), William T. Ames (1880-1969), Emma Louise Ames (b. 1882), Floyd Ames (1885-1969+), Allen Ames (b. 1888), Westley Ames (b. 1890), and Mabel Veronica Ames (b. 1896). Mr. Jeremiah Ames died at Ocean Springs prior to 1922. One daughter married Will Sigerson of Bay St. Louis.\n\nCareer\n\nYoung William T. Ames worked as a typesetter for The Progress, an Ocean Springs journal, from 1900 to 1903. He listed his occupation as manager of an electric company, probably the Mississippi Coast Traction Company, in 1910.\n\nIt is known that he went to Nashville, Tennessee and took a course in telephone work and was appointed manager of the Cumberland Telephone and Telegraph Company at Ocean Springs in 1904. In April 1909, Manager Ames announced that the phone company was going to rebuild the local phone exchange because the company was unable to supply the demand for telephones at Ocean Springs.\n\nAmes was frequently transferred temporarily by the telephone company and was sent to Hattiesburg in 1917. He returned to Ocean Springs and resigned his position as local manager of the Cumberland Telephone Company, and head of the Gulf Coast Traction Company. Eugene W. Illing succeeded Ames of the affairs of the Gulfport & Mississippi Coast Traction Company, which furnished electric lights to Ocean Springs.\n\nIn January 1918, Ames accepted a government job with the sanitation department at Hattiesburg. He was in charge of the sanitary works and garbage collection of that city.\n\nEvidently this opportunity was short-lived as The Jackson County Times reported Ames back with the phone company. In March 1918, W.T. Ames went to New Orleans. In July 1918,\n\nhe was made manager of Cumberland Telephone Company at Crowley, Louisiana. In October 1918, at Covington, Louisiana in charge of the telephone exchange.(The Jackson County Times, October 26, 1918, P. 5, c. 2) It is believed that Mrs. Ames and the children remained at Ocean Springs during these times.\n\nWilliam T. Ames officiated as Mayor of Ocean Springs (1913-1916), and alderman of Ward One 1905-1910. He was known for his faithful attention to his duties both as mayor and alderman. This was reflected by his almost perfect attendance at all public meetings.\n\nMarriage\n\nIn 1910, W.T. Ames married a widow, H. May Bertolotti of Mobile on September 11, 1909. Her first husband, E.A. Bertolotti, was the local manager of the Biloxi Railway & Power Company. He was a first class electrician. His company specialized in wiring buildings, burglar alarms, desk fans, ceiling fans, and electric door bells. The Bertolottis lived at Ocean Springs in 1904, and had a daughter, Mary L. Bertolotti Baehler (1904-1984).\n\nIn May 1915, a daughter, Elizabeth Ames Estalote (1915-1995), was born to the Ames at Ocean Springs. It is believed that the Ames had another child, probably a son. Ames was a musician in the famous turn of the century Ocean Springs Brass Band.\n\nAfter leaving Louisiana circa December 1918, Ames relocated to Pascagoula where he was the manager of the Pascagoula telephone exchange. He joined the Mississippi Bottling Works at Pascagoula as manager in March 1919. The company made pop, ginger ale, and other soft drinks. In Pascagoula as late as September 1919.\n\nThe Ames relocated to Selma, Alabama where he was employed by the L&N Railroad as an electrician. They resided at 519 Lamar Street until Mrs. Ames death on May 26, 1926. Her body was sent to Mobile for burial. She was survived by three children.\n\nWhen his mother, Louisa Ames, died in August 1925, she was living with Dr. Allen Ames in Pensacola. Her other surviving children were: Mrs. Will Sigerson of Bay St.Louis, Floyd and Wesley Ames of Hattiesburg, and W.T. Ames of Selma, Alabama.\n\nW.T. Ames moved to 226 Franklin Street at Selma and remained here until his retirement in 1964. He probably moved to Algiers, Louisiana to be near his daughter ?\n\nMayor Ames died on September 27, 1969 at Algiers. He is buried at Westlawn Memorial Park.\n\nFloyd Ames (1885-1963+) married Martha Elizabeth Cragin of Purvis at Hattiesburg in February 1909. They resided at Hattiesburg where Ames was a partner in the Century Drug Company. No further information.\n\nAllen Monti Ames (1888-1963) would go to Hattiesburg in the summer months to assist his brother, Floyd, at his drug store there. He began his medical education at Vanderbilt University and in 1912, graduated from the Tulane Medical School at New Orleans. In 1914, Dr. Ames opened his medical practice at Pensacola, Florida. He was a veteran of WW I and returned to Pensacola where he served the community for nearly fifty years. Dr. Ames expired at Pensacola in mid-June 1963. His corporal remains were interred in the Holy Cross Cemetery at Pensacola. He was of the Roman Catholic faith.(The Pensacola Journal, June 19, 1963, p. 8-A)\n\nREFERENCES:\n\nJerome Lepre, Catholic Church Records Diocese of Biloxi, Mississippi, Volume 1, \"Ames\", (Catholic Diocese of Biloxi: Biloxi, Mississippi-1991), p. 4.\n\nThe Daily Herald, \"W.T.

Blossman (1913-1990), founder of Blossman Gas in Ocean Springs and many other local enterprises, was painted by William Robert Steene (1887-1965), Syracuse, New York native. Steene was a fine portrait painter and had many commissions from industrialists and educators. Mr. Blossman had William R. Steene paint several historical and maritime scenes which hang today in the Blossman Building at 809 Washington Avenue.\n\nThe Blossman family at Ocean Springs began with Edward ‘Woody’ Woodrow Blossman (1913-1990). Woody was born at Covington, Louisiana on October 10, 1913, the son of Richard Samuel Blossman (1878-1952) and Edna Sarah Rhody (1881-1979), the daughter of Alfred Rhody (1837-1921), an 1853 English immigrant, and Hattie Ellis Rhody (1855-1929).\n\nIn 1920, Richard S. Blossman made his livelihood as a clerk in the tax assessor’s office at St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana. At this time, he and Edna Rhody Blossman were the parents of Dorothy Ellis Blossman Hollander (1903-1991); Alfred Rhody Blossman (1904-1990); Grace Blossman Hollister (1906-2000); Richard S. Blossman Jr. (1908-2000); Edna Blossman Buquoi (1909-1999); Edward Woodrow Blossman (1913-1990); and David C. Blossman (1919-1979).(1920 St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana T625_\n\nWith the exception of Woody Blossman, whose corporal remains were interred in the Evergreen Cemetery at Ocean Springs, Mississippi, Richard S. Blossman his spouse and children were after their demise, interred in the Burns Cemetery at Folsom, Louisiana.\n\nNew Orleans\n\nCirca 1941, Woody Blossman married a New Orleans lady, Miss Arthemise Ann Alsina, the daughter of John Alsina Jr. (1887-1954) and Jeanne Ader Alsina (1888-1974), both natives of New Orleans. Their only child was John Richard Blossman (1943-2009). Mr. Blossman arrived in Ocean Springs from Louisiana in 1952, with an engineering degree from Tulane University and the experience of a Marine Corps veteran of WWII. He opened an office for Blossman Gas Incorporated, his butane gas company, in the Moran Building on Washington Avenue. As the Blossman Gas company grew, the organization acquired the A.C. Gottsche building in November 1962. It remains here today as the corporate headquarters for the regional butane distributor, which was led his son, John Richard Blossman (1943-2009) until his death. In addition to his gas company, Woody Blossman was active at Ocean Springs in banking, the restaurant business, and philanthropic ventures. He founded the Gulf Coast YMCA and was known for his generosity in the community.\n\nThe mid-20th Century arrival of the Edward ‘Woody’ W. Blossman at Ocean Springs from his native Louisiana brought an energy and community enthusiasm reminiscent of that initiated by earlier Ocean Springs’ “mover and shakers” such as: George Allen Cox (1811-1887), Robert A. Van Cleave (1840-1908); Hiram F. Russell (1858-1940); Louis A. Lundy (1876-1941); A.P. ‘Fred’ Moran (1897-1967); J.K. Lemon Jr. (1914-1998); and today’s A.R. ‘Fred’ Moran Jr.\n\nIn the 1940s, Woody Blossman, a USMC veteran, armed with his degree from Tulane worked as an engineer with Brown and Root and other firms in various parts of America before joining Blossman Inc., a Covington, Louisiana based company, vending Hydratane Gas, the trade name for their butane-propane gas mixture used in home heating and cooking. In 1951, Woody Blossman (1913-1990) was vice president of the company, which was led by his brother, Alfred R. ‘Red’ Blossman (1904-1990), and staffed by brothers, Sam Blossman (1908-2000), secretary, and Dave Blossman (1919-1979), treasurer. In 1950, the company had 80 salesmen and 150 vehicles and was distributing gas to 35,000 customers in Louisiana and Mississippi. They were the second largest butane dealer in the South.(The Gulf Coast Times, February 8, 1951, p. 2)\n\nAmos N. Tims (1888-1960), a native of Vaiden, Mississippi and resident of East Beach at Ocean Springs, had been the local propane distributor from 1938 until he sold to Blossman, Inc. in 1948. He also sold Tappan gas ranges.(The Gulf Coast Times, July 31, 1952, p. 1)\n\nNatural Gas\n\nIt is interesting to note that in 1948, the year that Blossman Inc. began its butane-propane gas business in Ocean Springs, Mayor Albert S. Westbrook (1900-1980) was on June 22, 1948, turning on the valve situated on West Porter Street, which allowed the flow on natural gas [methane] into the local United Gas distribution system which had just been finished. At this time, United Gas was providing natural gas service to about 450 residential and 90 commercial and industrial clients at Ocean Springs. The residents of Gulf Hills did not receive natural gas service until 1953.(The Daily Herald, June 18, 1948, p. 1 and June 23, 1948, p. 1)\n\nOcean Springs\n\nIn the summer of 1952, Woody Blossman opened an office at Ocean Springs for Improved Hydratane Gas Service of which he company president. Amos N. Tims, the former propane salesman and distributor and local representative of Blossman Inc. since he had sold to them in 1948, was named vice president and local manager. Woody Blossman chose a space in the Moran Building on Washington Avenue, which had formerly been occupied by the Carson Ice Cream Parlor. The fledgling operation had one truck to provide service to their customers.\n\nShearwater Drive\n\nInitially, the Blossman family rented a house on the southwest corner of General Pershing and Hellmer’s Lane. Woody Blossman began acquiring his residence tracts at Ocean Springs in January 1953 when he purchased a lot with 200 feet on Shearwater Drive from Stanley P. Ruddiman (1890-1986) and Camille M. Ruddiman (1891-1982). In December 1947, the Ruddimans had bought a large parcel of land between Davis Bayou and Shearwater Drive from Sarah M. Taylor. They sold contiguous southern tracts to Blossman in 1958 and 1964 until his lot now about 4 acres extended from Shearwater Drive to Davis Bayou with excess to Davis Bayou and the Bay of Biloxi by virtue of a dredged canal into the marshy area on the southern end of the tract.(Jackson Co., Mississippi Land Deed Bk. 131, p. 209; Bk. 98, p. 307; Bk. 130, p. 315; and Bk. 252, p. 204)\n\nIn January 1971, the Ruddimans conveyed an .87 acres lot with 106 feet on Shearwater Drive to the Blossmans. This lot was juxtaposed to his original Ruddiman purchase giving them over 300 feet on Shearwater Drive. (Jackson Co., Mississippi Land Deed Bk. 394, p. 237)\n\n201 Shearwater Drive\n\nA guest cottage at 201 Shearwater Drive in Lot 14-Block 1 of the Point-O-Pines Subdivision was acquired by E.W. Blossman in April 1979 from Mary Anderson Stebly. It was sold to Alpha Investments, a Blossman company, in July 1982. The Blossman cottage was destroyed by a fire in October 1999 and the derelict structure removed in January 2000. The lot on the northeast corner of Pine Drive and Shearwater Drive remains vacant today. (Jackson Co., Mississippi Land Deed Bk. 648, p. 613)\n\nCirca 1915 809 Washington Avneue-February 1993\n\nGottsche-Blossman Building\n\nThe Blossman Building at 809 Washington Avenue in Ocean Springs was erected in 1912-1913 for Albert Cecil Gottsche (1873-1949), the son of Hans H. “Henry” Gottsche (1844-pre 1883) and Christina Switzer Gottsche (ca 1852-pre 1896), both German immigrants. Albert C. Gottsche was born on September 23, 1873, at Ocean Springs. On September 30, 1896, he married Cynthia “Cinnie” Davis Maxwell (1869-1951), the daughter of George Washington Davis (1842-1914) and Margaret Bradford (1846-1920). At this time, Mr. Gottsche was a salesman in the Davis Brothers Store, a mercantile business on Washington Avenue, owned jointly by George W. Davis (1842 -1914), Cinnie’s father, and her uncle, Elias Samuel Davis (1859-1925). Albert and Cinnie Davis Gottsche had one son, Albert Lynd Gottsche Sr. (1902-1974), who was the father of John ‘Jack’ H. Gottsche (b. 1941). Jack, a Georgia Tech engineering graduate, was employed by Blossman’s Ready Mix Concrete in 1971 and later managed Trilby’s Restaurant, another E.W. Blossman enterprise.\n\nIn late 1910, Albert C. Gottsche resigned from the Davis Brothers Store operation and began selling animal feed on southeast corner of Washington Avenue and Desoto in the present day Catchot-Lemon Building. He erected the Gottsche Store building across the street in 1912-1913, and ran a first class grocery and market here until his death in March 1949.\n\nAfter the demise of A.C. Gottsche, his stepson, Karl Case Maxwell (1893-1958), managed the Gottsche Store. In the early 1920s, Mr. Maxwell and spouse, Nellie Myrtle Morris (1893-1970), had returned from New Orleans to work in the Gottsche Store. Unfortunately, Mr. Maxwell met death accidentally on June 29, 1958, in an automobile car crash on US Highway 80, near Clinton, Mississippi. Mrs. Dena Atkinson Talbott (1886-1958) of Ocean Springs, the mother of Mrs. Gerald Noble, of Fontainebleau, was also killed in the accident.(The Ocean Springs News, July 3, 1958, p. 1 and The Daily Herald, July 5, 1958, p. 2)\n\nAfter Karl C. Maxwell’s death, the Gottsche Store remained open under the supervision of A. Lynd Gottsche. In January 1959, Lynd Gottsche incorporated the business and became its first president. He hired several managers, among them Jack Bosarge (1931-1999) and Claude Trahan (1920-1984). In 1961, when the Gottsche store ceased operations, the fixtures in the building were sold to Curmis Broome (1928-2006), a former butcher in the Gottsche’s meat market, for his Broome’s new store, called Foodland, on Vermont, now M.L. King Jr. Avenue, and Government Street.(Jack Gottsche, December 17, 2002 and The Gulf Coast Times, January 15, 1959, p. 1)\n\nThe old Gottsche Store building now corporate headquarters for Blossman Gas, Inc. was acquired from Albert L. Gottsche in November 1962. The lot had 35 feet on Washington Avenue and ran 200 feet west on Desoto.(Jackson County, Mississippi Land Deed Book 232, p. 382)\n\nAfter acquiring the Gottsche Store building, Mr. E.W. Blossman hired architects, Slaughter & Smith, of Pascagoula and relied on the advice and suggestions of his wife, the distinguished American artist, William Robert Steene (1887-1965), who was retired and lived in Gulf Hills, and others to create an edifice for Blossman Gas and its management and employees that would reflect the French cultural history of the area.\n\nIt is interesting to note that E.W. Blossman and William R. Steene became friends and Mr. Blossman commissioned several large paintings that hang today in the Blossman Building at 809 Washington Avenue. A short biographical sketch of Mr. Steene follows:\n\nWilliam R. Steene\n\nWilliam Robert Steene (1887-1965) was born at Syracuse, New York on August 18, 1887. He was a nationally known portrait painter and muralist. Steene studied under Colarossi and Julian in Paris, after his initial art education at the Art Students’ League and National Academy of Design in New York City. Among his portraitures possibly familiar to local residents are: President Franklin D. Roosevelt; Senator Theodore Bilbo of Mississippi; Governor Henry Whitfield of Mississippi; Dr. Karl Meyer, head of Cook County Hospital at Chicago; E.V Richards, president of the Navy League of America and Paramount Richards Theatres; and golfing legend, Robert Trent “Bobby” Jones.(Who’s Who in America, Vol. 31, 1960-1961 and Bradford-O’Keefe Burial Book 48, p. 245)\n\nProbably William R. Steene's first visit to the Mississippi Gulf Coast was in April 1931, when he was a guest of the Buena Vista Hotel at Biloxi. He had painted in Mississippi earlier in his distinguished art career. Mr. Steene had come to Biloxi after completing two portraits. They were of Frank G. Logan (1851-1937), philanthropist and honorary president of the Chicago Art Institute, and Dr. Harry Woodburn Chase (1883-1955), president of the University of Illinois. Mr. Logan's portrait was hung in the Grand Central art gallery at NYC.(The Daily Herald, April 18, 1931, p 2)\n\nGulf Hills\n\nIn November 1950, the William R. Steene home and studio in Gulf Hills was under construction. During its building, the Steenes were domiciled in the Edward Brou residence on Washington (sic) Avenue.(The Gulf Coast Times, November 3, 1950, p. 8)\n\nIn 1956, from his Gulf Hills studio, W.R. Steene completed a large mural depicting the 1953 Louisiana Sesquicentennial Celebration, a remembrance of the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, at New Orleans. President Eisenhower is at the center of this 50-foot long, ten-foot tall, triptych mural, which took a year to complete. The painting hangs in the Presbytery of the Louisiana State Museum at New Orleans.(The Daily Herald, “Know Your Coast”, November 15, 1957)\n\nLocally, the Blossman Gas office at 809 Washington Avenue has a fine collection of Mr. Steene’s oil paintings. In 1963, E.W. “Woody“ Blossman commissioned \"Landing of Iberville\" from Steene to hang in his refurbished Gottsche Building, which was acquired in 1962. The architectural firm of Slaughter & Smith of Pascagoula directed the buildings restoration and W.R. Steene served as art consultant for the project.(Down South, March 4, 1964)\n\nWilliam Steene also painted a portrait of E.W Blossman and several other works, primarily shrimp boats of the Mississippi Gulf Coast. The City of Biloxi has a Steene painting in its City Hall on Lameuse Street appropriately titled, “Blessing of the Fleet” and the Ohr-O’Keefe Museum of Art [OOMA] has a Steene in its business office on the Biloxi campus.(The Ocean Springs News, June 3, 1965, p. 7)\n\nWilliam Steene and his wife Eula Mae Jackson Steene (1888-1969) resided in Gulf Hills north of Ocean Springs from 1950, until his death at Biloxi on March 24, 1965. They married in 1914, and had two daughters, Betty S. Painter and Marianne S. Ware (1919-2001). Mrs. Steene’s sister, Miss O. Jackson, a native of Lexington, Kentucky, was once the manager of the Town And Country Restaurant on Park Avenue in New York City.(The Daily Herald, March 24, 1965, p. 1 and The Gulf Coast Times, January 22, 1953)\n\nBlossman Companies\n\nTrilby's Restaurant-1963\n\nAfter successfully establishing Blossman Gas at Ocean Springs and surrounding territories, E.W. ‘Woody’ Blossman and his family built a conglomerate through several investment entities in the fields of food service, real estate, banking, construction, printing, and retail flower sales. Probably the most visible and relished gem in the E.W. Blossman empire was Trilby’s Restaurant.\n\nIn June 1963, after the demise of Trilby G. Steimer (1896-1960), Trilby's Restaurant was acquired from her daughter and widower, Elise ‘Happy’ Welton Gabrielson Thomas (1920-1989) and Edward ‘Ted’ C. Steimer, by Alpha Investment Corporation, an E.W. Blossman (1913-1990) family enterprise. The name \"Trilby's\" was sold with the restaurant.(Jackson Co., Mississippi Land Deed Bk. 241, p. 483)\n\nHarold M. Mayfield Jr. (1932-2011) and Jocelyn Seymour Mayfield, who had worked for Trilby G. Steimer, managed the eating affair for Mr. Blossman, until 1982, when they opened Jocelyn's, their own fine restaurant, also on Bienville Boulevard. Jocelyn’s, closed in late December 2013, after 31 years of excellent food and fine patronage. Jack Gottsche became manager of Trilby’s in 1983. In May 1987, Craig Claiborne (1920-2000), native Mississippian and food critic for the New York Times, ate at Trilby’s.(Jack Gottsche, February 1, 2008 and The Ocean Springs Record, May 21, 1987, p. 7)\n\nLillian Grenet Steimer\n\nLillian “Trilby” Grenet Welton Steimer (1896-1960)-Trilby was a restaurateur at Ocean Springs from 1946 until her demise in 1960. Her Trilby’s Restaurant on US Highway No. 90 became synonymous with fine dining at Ocean Springs and on the Coast. Jocelyn Seymour Mayfield and Harold M. Mayfield Jr. (1932-2011) worked for Mrs. Steimer until 1982, before commencing Jocelyn’s Restaurant, which closed in December 2013\n\nBy January 1952, Willy Dale had a new proprietor in his Porter Street edifice. She was ‘Trilby’ Grenet Steimer (1896-1960). Trilby had already made a name for herself at Ocean Springs in the fine dining and restaurant business. She ran the Big Pine Inn on West Porter Street until February 1946, when it was sold to Paul Lewis. In 1947, Trilby and Ted Steimer with Ray and Juanita Taylor, opened the Alibi, formerly the Clear View Café, on Highway 90 (Government Street) east of Ocean Springs. Another site for the ubiquitous Trilby was the Bayou Chateau, now Aunt Jenny's Catfish Restaurant. She opened here on September 4, 1948. This was the first time that the name “Trilby’s” was used for her business.(The Jackson County Times, August 27, 1948, p. 9)\n\nLillian “Trilby” G. Welton Steimer (1896-1960) was born at New York City on April 1, 1896, the daughter of Auguste J. Grenet (1863-1920+) and Lillian Day (1865-1947). Honore Grenet, Trilby’s grandfather, was born in France and had a background in the restaurant business. He immigrated to Mexico with his Majorcan born wife between 1864 and 1867, when Ferdinand Maximilian (1832-1867), the Austrian archduke, was being enthroned as Emperor of Mexico* by Napoleon III, Louis Napoleon Bonaparte (1808-1873), who ruled France from 1852-1870. Opposition to the French invasion of Mexico led to anarchy, which swept the country and led Honore Grenet to remove his family to the safe environs of San Antonio, Texas. Here Monsieur Grenet founded a successful merchandiser. He owned the Alamo, which he purchased from the Roman Catholic Church for $20,000, and utilized it as a warehouse for his expanding business. Trilby’s father, Auguste J. Grenet, was sent to Manhattan College in New York City. Here he became engaged in the chemical business, but was enamored with horse racing. Auguste, a competent mathematician, devised a system for handicapping race horses and became the first professional handicapper.(Down South,Vol. 9, No. 4, July-August 1959)\n\n*Cinco de Mayo is the celebration of a Mexican military victory over invading French forces at Puebla, Mexico on 5 May 1862. It is not Mexican Independence Day!\n\nWalter F. Welton\n\nIn New York circa 1917, Trilby Grenet married Walter F. Welton (1894-1981), the son of Frances Welton, a Manhattan butcher and later hotelier, and Elise Welton, a French immigrant. Trilby and Walter F. Welton had two children: Francis Welton (1918-pre-1930) and Elise ‘Happy’ W. Fulwiler Mendez Thomas (1920-1989). In 1920, Walter F. Welton was in the hotel business with Frances Welton (1867-1918+), his father. Their resort was called Moheghan Lake and situated in Westchester County, New York. Adele Grenet Stevenson (1888-1990), Trilby’s sister, was also married to a hotelier and resided in Palm Beach, Florida.(1920 New York Co., New York Federal Census T625_1226, p. 3A, ED 1)\n\nTed Steimer\n\nIn March 1930, Trilby Grenet Welton, then divorced from Walter F. Welton, married Edward C. \"Ted\" Steimer (1884-1967) in south Florida. He was an associate of her father's in the horse race handicapping business. Ted Steimer began visiting Ocean Springs circa 1916, as a fishing destination. He continued this routine for years, as he would arrive here in the fall to hunt and fish before the racing season began at New Orleans. Ted and Trilby relocated to Ocean Springs after their wedding.(The Daily Herald, March 14, 1930, p. 9\n\nWilly Dale’s Place\n\nBy January 1952, Trilby G. Steimer had relocated to the William ‘Willy’ F. Dale (1899-1990) building, formerly the Jeremiah J. O’Keefe home at 911 Porter Street. The Steimer’s lived upstairs in the old O’Keefe mansion. Burglars broke into their restaurant on New Year’s Day 1952 and stole $4 in pennies from the cash register.(The Gulf Coast Times, January 3, 1952, p. 1)\n\nWilly Dale had taken possession of the Jeremiah J. O’Keefe home in December 1939 for $3850. It had been repossessed in December 1938, by the Home Owners Loan Corporation, a Federal corporation. A balance of $5612.17 was owed by the O’Keefe family on the mortgaged property.(Jackson Co., Mississippi Land Deed Bk. 71, pp. 580-581 and Bk. 74, pp. 158-160)\n\nOne of the great success stories of Ocean Springs is the return of the J. J. O’Keefe family residence on Porter Street to the family. When they lost it in 1938, the Jeremiah J. ‘Ben’ O’Keefe II family relocated to Biloxi and resided on Fayard Street behind the Bradford-O’Keefe Funeral parlor at 601 West Howard Avenue. A young Jeremiah J. “Jerry” O’Keefe III (b. 1923) and his sister, Alice O’Keefe Sebastian (1922-2011), vowed that someday, they would reclaim their former home in Ocean Springs.(Alice O’Keefe Sebastian, September 13, 1999 and The Ocean Springs Record, July 3, 1986, p. 2 and July 10, 1986, p. 2\n\nThis was accomplished in July 1986, when the Willy Dale family sold the former O’Keefe mansion to Gulf National Life, an O’Keefe corporation. A ceremony was held on the grounds and after signing the warranty deed to the O’Keefe family, Willy Dale said, “Folks, the first day [of owning this building] was fun and the last day is fun too.” In December 1987, Jeremiah J. ‘Jerry’ O’Keefe III with the competent architectural advice and service of Bruce Tolar completed its restoration. The refurbished edifice has been used as the Bradford-O’Keefe Funeral Home since this time.(JXCO Land Deed Bk. 863, p. 159 and The Ocean Springs Record, July 3, 1886, p. 2 and December 3, 1987, p. 1)\n\nThe Gehl Place\n\nIn July 1955, Trilby G. Steimer acquired the former Gehl place on \"new\" US Highway 90, today known as 1203 Bienville Boulevard. This is the Trilby's that many older residents of Ocean Springs are familiar and had fond culinary memories. Here such gourmet dishes as Rock Cornish game hen au parto and creamed ham and sweetbreads with ripe olives, macaroni loaf, carrot casserole, and rum pie were concocted. (Jackson Co., Mississippi Land Deed Bk.\n\nBlossman Flower Shop-1965\n\nThe Blossman Flower shop was situated just south of the Blossman Building at 809 Washington Avenue. It was a small property with just 19 feet on the street but ran west for 200 feet. This tract had been in the Westbrook family for many years and had served as the barbershop of Edwin Westbrook and his son, Albert Westbrook.\n\nEula Quave Noyes sold the business to Alpha Investments, a Blossman company, in May 1963. It had belonged to Tone and Eleanor Herman and Louise Westbrook before Mrs. Noyes took possession.(Jackson Co., Mississippi Land Deed Bk. 239, p. 76)\n\nBanking\n\nFirst National Bank of Ocean Springs\n\nThe First National Bank of Ocean Springs was organized in June 1967 after the Comptroller of Currency in the Capitol approved their charter. The principals in the bank were: E.W. Blossman (1913-1990), W.C. Gryder III (1928-1999), Anthony van Ryan (1899-1980), J.C. “Champ” Gay (1909-1975), Samuel L. Zanca (1919-1991), William T. Dunn (1919-1990), Naif Jordan (1907-1993), G.E. Egeditch (1907-1987), J.K. Lemon Jr. (1914-1998), Dr. Frank O. Smith (1902-1975), Richard M. Davis, Oscar Jordan, Frank T. Pickel (1912-1982), and Thomas L. Stennis (b. 1935). A lot was acquired on the northwest corner of Washington Avenue and Desoto to erect a bank building.(The Ocean Springs Record, June 29, 1967, p. 1)\n\nEarl Jones\n\nIn March 1968, Earl Jones was named president of the First National Bank of Ocean Springs. Earl was a native of Columbus, Mississippi and graduate of Mississippi State University with a degree in finance. In 1953, he joined the National bank of Commerce at Columbus and was named vice-president of this organization in 1961. Earl Jones had married Fay West and they were the parents of: West Jones (b. 1960), Judi Jones (b. 1963), and Jane Jones (b. 1965). The Jones family resided in the Fort Bayou Estate subdivision.(The Ocean Springs Record, March 14, 1968, p. 3)\n\nOpening day\n\nAfter E.W. Blossman, chairman of the board delivered a welcome address and Don Green, president of the Ocean Springs Chamber of Commerce, cut the ribbon, the doors of the The First National Bank of Ocean Springs opened for business in late November 1968 in a Claude H. Lindsley (1894-1969) designed building. Over 3000 people entered the bank and 700 accounts were opened. $1,200,000 in business was transacted.(The Ocean Springs Record, November 28, 1968, p. 1)\n\nFirst National Bank of Jackson County-Pascagoula\n\nIn December 1970, the bank opened an office in Pascagoula on the corner of US Highway 90 and Telephone Road. The bank was housed in a small structure, which was already on the property. The First National Bank of Ocean Springs became the First National Bank of Jackson County in 1971. A new building was erected on the Pascagoula property and the bank moved into it in September 1972.(The Ocean Springs Record, September 14, 1972, p. 2)\n\nIn July 1972, Jolly McCarty of Pascagoula became a vice-president of the bank. He was hired primarily as the Public Relations Officer for the organization.(The Ocean Springs Record, July 27, 1972, p. 1)\n\nFirst National Bank of the South\n\nIn late 1971, when Harroll Dean Castle (b. 1937), a native of Laurel, Mississippi became president of the First National Bank of Jackson County, it had assets of about $8 million. In late 1977, the bank acquired the Biloxi branch of the Southern National Bank and the name of the Ocean Springs based bank became the First National Bank of the South. In 1980, Harroll D. Castle acquired controlling interest in the First National Bank of the South, which by 1984 had assets of $88 million. Mr. Castle also possessed a majority interest in the Pine Belt Capital Corporation, which owned the Hattiesburg based Pine Belt Federal Savings and Loan.(The Ocean Springs Record, October 4, 1984, p. 1)\n\nBank mergers-Metropolitan National Bank and Hancock\n\nIn November 1984, one of the largest bank mergers ever contracted on the Mississippi Gulf Coast occurred when the First South National Corporation, Harroll D. Castle, president; the First National Bank of the South, Kenneth D. Ross, chairman and CEO; the First State Bank of Gulfport, William A. Wiltshire, chairman; and the Metropolitan National Bank of Biloxi, John R. Conry, president, merged to form the Metropolitan National Bank. The new bank had assets of $138 million and eleven branches.(The Ocean Springs Record, November 29, 1984, p. 1)\n\nIn February 1990, an agreement in principal was reached between the Metropolitan Bank and Hancock Bank, which allowed Hancock to acquire the Metropolitan National Bank, a subsidiary of the Metropolitan Corporation. G.H. English, CEO of Metropolitan, said, \"this combination will add to the quality and convenience of our banking services to the people of the Mississippi Gulf Coast\". The merger took place in June 1990, after all Federal banking agencies approved the Hancock acquisition which cost them $6,750,000.(The Ocean Springs Record, February 15, 1990, p. 1 and June 14, 1990, p. 6)\n\nThe clock\n\nThe clock on the old Ocean Springs State Bank, which had been installed in its 1955 remodeling, was removed on December 11, 1990, for refurbishing and cleaning before installation on the new Hancock Bank quarters in the former Metropolitan Bank building. This action by the Hancock Bank created a small furor as members of Main Street and the Historic Ocean Springs Association (HOSA) protested the action. These local civic organizations felt that the clock would be out of character on the former Metropolitan Bank building, which was to become the site of the Hancock Bank at Washington and Desoto.(The Ocean Springs Record, December 13, 1990, p. 1)\n\nThe superstitious might say that Hancock Bank was punished by the ‘gods’ for removing the iconic Ocean Springs State Bank clock in December 1990, from its primal location on the now Cornerstone Group edifice on the NE/C of Washington Avenue and Government Street, when a truck hit the old clock in June 1995. It was removed and repaired and later re-installed where it hangs today on Washington and Desoto Avenues.(The Ocean Springs Record, June 29, 1995, p. 3)\n\nBlossman ‘Airforce’\n\nAmong his many skills and talents, E.W. ‘Woody’ Blossman could also fly an airplane. Initially, he owned a Cesna 172 Skyhawk and then acquired a Piper Comanche, both single engine aircraft. As his propane gas business grew in the southeast United States and his desire to relax and fish in south Florida increased, Mr. Blossman in the summer of 1965 commenced Airplane Services Incorporated.(Robert Bowers-June 2014)\n\nGulf Park Estates Airport\n\nIn 1962, H. Vaughn Watkins, a Jackson attorney, Forrest Jackson and their investors from Jackson, Mississippi acquired Gulf Park Estates and hired Harry Del Reeks of Ocean Springs as general manager and sales agent. Immediately, the Watkins-Jackson group built a 2500-foot landing strip in the E/2 of Section 35, T7S-R8W. The small airport was vastly improved in February 1964 when a contract was signed with Space Age Structures of Gulfport to erect a 15,000 square-ft. hangar to house 25 aircraft. The new airport was dedicated in June 27, 1965. At the celebration, Richard ‘Dick’ M. Davis, president of the Ocean Springs Chamber of Commerce, introduced the Reverend Merlin F. Usner of the 1st Presbyterian Church who gave the invocation. Notable dignitaries present were: Mayor C. Ernest Schmidt; J.J. Hayden, president of Perkinston JC; Miss Rosie Ray, Miss Hospitality; A.V. Ragusin from the Biloxi Chamber of Commerce; H. Vaughan Watkins, Jackson attorney; and Colonel Rex G. Fryer, representing KAFB (Down South, July-August 1962, p. 11 and The Ocean Springs News, June 4, 1962, p. 1 and July 1, 1965, p. 2)\n\nGulf Park Estates Airport-1965\n\nThis June 1965 image was made at the dedication of the Gulf Park Estates Airport. Built in 1962 with a 2500-foot landing strip located in the E/2 of Section 35, T7S-R8W. The small airport was vastly improved in 1964 when a contract was signed with Space Age Structures of Gulfport to erect a 15,000 square-ft. hangar to house 25 aircraft. The new airport was dedicated in June 27, 1965. [L-R: E.W. Blossman; James Wood; Captain Tom Dansby; and Jay Nelson with J.D. Hair Company of Baton Rouge, Louisiana]\n\nAirplane Services Incorporated\n\nIn 1965, Blossman’s Airplane Services Inc. took a lease on the Gulf Park Estates Airport. The company was staffed by Captain Tom Dansby, a retired USAF veteran with 26 years flying and administrative experience; Max Lamptenfeld, vice-president, was a licensed pilot and instructor; and James Wood of Blossman Incorporated served as the secretary-treasurer.(The Ocean Springs News, June 24, 1965, p. 1)\n\nBy 1966, E.W. Blossman had hired Frank Fleming to assist his Airplane Services Inc. Among other duties, Mr. Fleming taught flying lessons. One of his students, Joan Ferguson, became the first women to make her solo flight from the Gulf Park Airport.(The Ocean Springs Record, June 23, 1966, p. 6)\n\nThe Blossman Gas Company owned three twin-engine aircraft while flying Woody Blossman, company executives, family and friends in the Gulf South. According to Robert ‘Bob’ Bowers (b. 1936), former and last of the Blossman pilots, these aircraft were: Piper Aztec, a twin-engine, six-seat aircraft; Cessna 414; and Beechcraft King Air C-90. The last two aircraft had pressurized cabins. After the Blossman Company bought their Beechcraft King Air C-90 circa 1985, they relocated to Gulfport Field.(Robert Bowers-June 2014)\n\nLt. Colonel [ret] Bob Bowers, a native Virginian, joined E.W. Blossman’s Marine Electronics as a technician working with William ‘Bill’ Cox. Bob had been a navigator in the USAF, but learned to fly in his private life. Bowers became the Blossman company pilot circa 1981 when Walter Brown retired. Bowers retired in 1994 from his flying duties after the Beechcraft King Air C-90 was sold. Bob remembers Woody Blossman as a kind, gregarious man who enjoyed life. Although he had turned the gas company executorship to John R. Blossman, his son, Woody would occasional remind the troops that he was still their ‘Boss’!\n\nMarathon\n\nAnother of the Blossman family love was blue water with sailing and fishing at the top of the chart. The Florida Keys, especially Marathon, Florida became a Blossman treasured sanctuary. Marathonis a city of about 12,000 people in Monroe County situated on Knight’s Key, Boot Key, Key Vaca, Fat Deer Key, Long Point Key, Crawl Key, and Grassy Key, all small islands in the middle Florida Keys. Initially, E.W. Blossman either acquired or built a small house on a canal with access to the Florida Strait. As his fortunes improved a larger home was erected at Marathon called Copa de Oro. The Blossman flotilla consisted of two sailboats and two yachts. Mrs. Artemise Blossman gave their boats Spanish names.[Bob and MaBelle S. Bowers-June 2014)\n\nWhen a Blossman boat was moved from the Mississippi coast to the Florida Keys, Woody Blossman, Bill Cox and crew, which occasionally included MaBelle Snyder Bowers (b. 1942), Bob’s wife, and certainly one of Ocean Springs great characters, was aboard. Mabelle was galley chef and sergeant-at-arms while at sea. The Blossman family general modus operandi was to leave Ocean Springs on a Friday and sail until late Sunday. Bob Bowers would then fly from Gulf Park Estates Airport to an airfield near where the Blossman vessel had moored and return its crew to Ocean Springs for work on Monday. In this way, the boat eventually reached Marathon, Florida.(MaBelle S. Bowers-June 2014)\n\nBlossman Printing-1969\n\nWith his businesses become more successful, Woody Blossman realized that he could reduce operating expenses by owning his own printing company. In late June 1969, the Blossman Printing Company held its formal opening in what might have been in the old Engbarth garage building on Washington Avenue. The new Blossman enterprise commenced with a Kors Heidelberg press and a Robertson 580 color process camera.(The Ocean Springs Record, June 26, 1969, p. 3 and Jack Gottsche-April 2014)\n\nClaude Engbarth\n\nIn May 1922, Claude Engbarth (1893-1967) had bought a lot fronting 30 feet on the west side of Washington Avenue, from his uncle, George E. Arndt (1857-1945). The Engbarth garage was south and contiguous with the Farmer’s and Merchants’ State Bank building. The grocery store of Judge Orin D. Davidson (1872-1938) was south of the new Engbarth enterprise. Before the Farmer’s and Merchant’s Bank had been erected in 1913, the infamous Paragon Saloon of Mr. Arndt had sat there on the southwest corner of Washington and Robinson.\n\nClaude Engbarth was probably born at Rodney, Jefferson County, Mississippi, the son of Emile Engbarth (1855-probably 1905) and Magalene, called Lena, Jeanette Arndt (1856-1938). Both his paternal and maternal grandparents were German immigrants who settled in southwest Mississippi.Emile Engbarth was the postmaster at Ocean Springs from 1882 to 1885. As Emile and Lena Engbarth were again residents of Rodney in 1900, it appears that they moved back to Jefferson County after April 1889, when Emile’s position as postmaster terminated. The Pascagoula Democrat-Star of August 31, 1900, announced that well-known Republican, Emile Engbarth, is in Ocean Springs and rumored to be the new postmaster. This did not come to fruition as Thomas I. Keys (1861-1931), a local Black merchant and ardent Republican, remained at this post until March 1911. In September 1900, Emile Engbarth applied for the position of postmaster at Pascagoula. It appears that he was unsuccessful in attaining this opportunity, as the local journal reported that \"Mr. E. Engbarth… returned to Rodney, Miss\".(The Pascagoula Democrat-Star, October 5, 1900, p. 3)\n\nMarie Arndt Alexander (1905-1994) writing in The History of Jackson County, Mississippi (1989) states that her father, George E. Arndt, came to Ocean Springs on May 17, 1881, from Rodney, Mississippi to be with his sister, Lena Engbarth.\n\nAt Ocean Springs, Claude Engbarth had been in the auto repair business with Philip J. Weider (1887-1985), whose parents were also both German immigrants. The Jackson County Times of July 12, 1919, which related that the partners, who called their recent venture, The Ocean Springs Garage, were going to erect a new garage on County Road [Government Street] on the lot that they recently purchased from George L. Friar. Actual construction on the Wieder-Engbarth structure did not start until January 1920. When construction was completed by Wieder and Engbarth, who were surely assisted by some of their brothers, talented carpenters and plumbers themselves, it had a wooden floor and accommodations for fifteen motorcars.\n\nHerrs Wieder & Engbarth announced in The Jackson County Times in January 1921:\n\nWe have been appointed by the Adams Motor Co.

Wieder & Engbarth-Ocean Springs Garage.\n\nThe Ocean Springs Garage on County Road operated by the Wieder-Engbarth combine was dissolved on April 1, 1922. In late March, Mr. Engbarth had sold his interest in the business to P.J. Wieder for $500 and acquired the Arndt lot on Washington Avenue to start his own automobile repair business.(The Daily Herald, April 15, 1922, p. 8)\n\nRestaurateur\n\nClaude Engbarth later started a cafe and bar on Government Street, which after several later proprietors, including The Medora Cafe of Mrs. Wallace of Biloxi, and Cyril Hopkins, eventually evolved into the legendary, Henrietta's Cafe. This local, eatery, landmark closed its portals on May 20, 1995. Engbarth bought two old homes and moved them together for his enterprises. One structure was a shot-gun house which Emile Fayard (1872-1931) once occupied. The present day Henrietta's building, now an amalgamation of small shops, is the original Claude Engbarth structure except for a different roofline. It is believed that the present day, front gable, facade of the structure was established by Aden S. Bellew (1907-1981) in the early 1940s, when he was married to Henrietta Beaorvich Cvitanovich Savage (1911-1999), the daughter of Marco Beaorvich (1883-1966) and Jacobina Sekul (1882-1956), both immigrants from the Isle of Brac, Split-Dalmatia County, Croatia.

A site was selected on the southeast corner of Desoto and Jackson Avenue and on July 26, 1965 McCorkle & Stuart of Montgomery, Alabama construction was commenced on the 5800 square-foot building, which cost $76, 381. In February 1966, Mose W. Stuart III and Frank McCorkle leased their new building to the United States Post Office. In March 1966, moving from the old post office on Washington Avenue began to Desoto and Jackson.\n\nIn June 1966, Postmaster Orwin J. Scharr and his staff of twenty postal employees relocated from the Palfrey building [Salmagundi here until 2013] on the southeast corner of Washington Avenue and Robinson for their new quarters at present day 900 Desoto. The new structure almost tripled the area of the former one on Washington Avenue.(The Gulf Coast Times, December 10, 1953, p. 1 and January 13, 1954, p. 14, and The Ocean Springs Record, June 23, 1966, p. 1)\n\nDedication\n\nOn June 19, 1966, Max Jordan, postal service officer for South Mississippi of the Memphis Region, one of fifteen regions in the Post Office Department, served as the master of ceremonies for the dedication of the new post office.

Calongne is a small village or estate in France. Progenitors of the American family were Francois Calongne and Emilie Adelaide Henry of New Orleans. Their son, Sidney Auguste Calongne (1855-1911), built the American Sugar Refinery in St. Bernard, Parish and other buildings in New Orleans. In 1881, he married Sally A. Forschee (1853-1942), the daughter of J.H. Forshee and Sarah Knight. Sidney A. Calongne and Sally Forschee Calongne had five children: Sidney E. Calongne (b. 1883), Wilford F. Calongne (1885-1967), Emily C. Mead (b. 1887), Ashely Calongne (1890-1953), Mildred Calongne (1891-1892), and Evelyn Leah C. Smith (1896-1973).(Bill Calongne, April 1997)\n\nThe Calongnes were fond of Ocean Springs and began coming here in the early 1900s. They rented a cottage behind Glengariff, the beach front home of Captain Francis O' Neill (1849-1936), the retired Superintendent of Chicago police. It was here that a young Wilford F. Calongne met Mary Haggarty, the daughter of John J. Haggarty. The Haggartys were also residents of the Crescent City and enjoyed the breezy, warm summers of the Mississippi coast. Wilford married Miss Haggarty in September 1920 at New Orleans.(Bill Calongne, April 1997)\n\nCalongne-Reeves House [destroyed by Katrina, August 2005]\n\n204 Washington Avenue\n\nHillside\n\nThe Calongne family built a home in the fall of 1909 at present day 204 Washington Avenue. It was called, Hillside, and cost $3000. The contractors were Wieder & Friar. Hillside burned in the 1930s, and was rebuilt. Muriel Cousins, wife of Mayor George Barrow Cousins (b. 1883), once lived here.(The Ocean Springs News, November 27, 1909, p. 1 and Bill Calongne, April 1997)\n\nThe Calongne home on lower Washington Avenue had been possessed since December 1978 by Louise “Lit” VanCourt (1914-2004). In the late 1990s, Miss VanCourt sold it to James D. Reeves and Nell Webb Reeves. In the summer of 1999, the Reeves family renovated their home with consultations from Carl D. Germany, AIA, and under the auspices of the Ocean Springs Historic Preservation Commission. They restored the L-shaped gallery of the original structure, replaced windows, and installed a balustrade around the perimeter of the porch. New colors, Tarrytown Green with Windham Cream trim, were selected to replace the faded dark green and white trim.(JXCO, Ms. Land Deed Bk. 636, p. 449 and City of Ocean Springs-Historical District Application for Certificate of Appropriateness-March 1999)\n\nPaving company\n\nThe three sons of Sidney A. Calongne formed a paving company called Calongne Brothers. They came to Ocean Springs in May 1915, to remove the defective schellinger paving and laid over one mile of cement walks and driveways at the Benjamin Estate, the large, well-landscaped property of Anna Louise Fitz Benjamin (1848-1938), the widow of David M. Benjamin (1834-1892) of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.(The Ocean Springs News, June 3, 1915, p. 1)\n\nCalongne Children\n\nSidney E. Calongne\n\nSidney Edward Calongne (b. 1883) received a Civil Engineering degree from Tulane. Married Ethel Calongne. Died at Baton Rouge. Four children: Dorothy Calongne, Ethel Calongne, Calongne, and Sidney Calongne married J. Arthur Smith. No further information.(Bill Calongne, April 1997 and Philo Hooper DuVal, April 2001)\n\nWilford F. Calongne\n\nWilford F. Calongne (1883-1967) was born November 30, 1883 at New Orleans. He received a Civil Engineering degree from Tulane. Married Mary Haggarty at New Orleans, in September 1920. She was the eldest of sixteen children (only eight survived). Only child, a son, Wilford F. Calongne Jr. was born a New Orleans in 1921. The family resided on Webster Street near Audubon Park. They later relocated to the Broadmoor section of New Orleans, which is now predominantly Black. W.F. Calongne for WPA during the Depression and assisted in the construction of the Lake Pontchartrain seawall. He expired in May 1967.(Bill Calongne, April 1997)\n\nW.F. “Bill” Calongne House (built 1996)\n\n11001 Pointe-aux-Chenes Road\n\nProfessor Wilford F. Calongne Jr.\n\nWilford “Bill” F. Calongne (1921-2012) was born at New Orleans in September 1921, the son of Wilford F. Calongne and Mary Haggarty. He was reared on Webster Street near Audubon Park. The Calongne family came to Ocean Springs for their summer holiday. They stayed in their grandmother's cottage, Hillside, at present day 204 Washington Avenue. Hillside was built in October 1909, by Wieder & Friar, local building firm.\n\nThese were days when Johnny Seymour operated his fish and oyster house at the foot of Washington Avenue, the Anchor Inn of Mark Seymour was in full swing, and the \"natives\" were more prominent than they are today. Ocean Springs still reeked with atmosphere and ambience of the small village, which it had been since the first tourist had discovered it during the steam packet days of the middle 19th Century.\n\nIn the summer of 1938, young Bill Calongne met Nathaniel Curtis, the Dean of the Tulane School of Architecture. Dean Curtis and family were at Hillside for the summer. Calongne's aunt, Emily C. Mead?, was letting the Connor Cottage on Lovers Lane. They met at the Connors and the two became fishing companions often taking a boat into Back Bay to fish for white trout. During their fishing ventures, Professor Curtis influenced young Calongne into studying architecture.\n\nProfessor Calongne retired from teaching at Tulane in 1984. In November 1973, he bought four acres of land at Pointe aux Chenes described as the W/2 of Lot 5 from William B. Rudolf and his wife, Hayne Rudolph. Ruth Carr was sales the agent. Bill Calongne planned to build his dream home here upon retirement. When construction costs soared beyond his budget, he scaled down the project.(JXCO, Ms. Land Deed Bk. 482, p. 296)\n\nCapital for the Calongne home was raised by selling the land to William Seaman and Wynn Seaman in March 1994. Seaman rents the land to Calongne for $1 per year. The home will naturally belong to Seaman upon the demise of Calongne. (JXCO, Ms. Land Deed Bk. 1049, p. 329 and JXCO, Ms. Chancery Court Plat Book 1, p. 120)\n\nProfessor Calongne started a house on the bluff facing the Gulf of Mexico. Foundation completed and framing commenced, when Seaman discovered the location and didn't want the house there. In 1996, the Calongne project was restarted at a location farther from the water. Ken Snyder of Ocean Springs was the general contractor. The Calongne home has an area of 1500 square feet.(Bill Calongne, April 1997)\n\nWilford Francis Calongne Jr. [September 20, 1921 - August 4, 2012 Ocean Springs, Mississippi]\n\nWilford \"Bill\" Calongne, age 90 years, of Ocean Springs, MS died on Saturday, August 4, 2012. Mr. Calongne was a resident of Ocean Springs since 1984.\n\nHe retired from Tulane University where he was a Professor in Architecture. His urbane and gentle manner was as influential as his considerable skill as an architect. What set him apart was his interest in music, particularly that of modern composers and his passion for the well-designed object. Unlike most of his University colleagues, he was almost universally admired as a non dogmatic but highly principled teacher and architect.\n\nSome of his noteworthy students were Albert Ledner, Milton Scheuermann and Errol Barron. In the scope of his career, he designed many notable buildings in New Orleans and on the gulf coast to include several homes in Biloxi, Ocean Springs and Pascagoula.\n\nMr. Calongne retired from teaching at Tulane in 1984. In November of 1973 he bought four acres of land at Pointe aux Chenes, where he planned to build his dream home. His home was eventually built as an architectural experiment of his own design. The home was geometrically pure, spatially concise and sturdy surviving Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\n\nHis father, Wilford F. Calongne, was born in 1883 in New Orleans. He married Mary Haggarty in New Orleans in 1920. Wilford, Jr. was their only son and the family resided on Webster Street near Audubon Park. Mr. Calongne is survived by extended families to include the Luckey, Smith and Calongne family that mourn his passing and celebrate his unique life.\n\nFuneral services will be held on Saturday, August 11, 2012 at 1:30 p.m. at the Ocean Springs Chapel of Bradford-O'Keefe Funeral Home. Friends may visit from 1:00 p.m. until service time.

Camba\n\nFrancis “Frank” Henry Camba (1853-1885) may have been the son of Frank Camba and Rosalia Oser. He and Elizabeth Catchot (1854-1927) were the progenitors of this local family. They were married at Jackson County, Mississippi on September 22, 1877. At this time Mr. Camba was employed as a teller in a New Orleans bank.(The Pascagoula Democrat-Star, May 21, 1880, p. 3)\n\nTheir only child, Walter F. Camba (1878-1960), was born on July 4, 1878, at Ocean Springs, Mississippi, the home of his mother. Mrs. Camba was the daughter of two European immigrants, Antonio Catchot (1826-1885) of Menorca in the Balearic Islands, and Elizabeth Hoffen (1832-1916), a native of Bremen, Germany. Birth records from archivist of the Diocese of Menorca at Ciudadela, Menorca indicate that the Catchot family migrated to that Mediterranean Island from Malta in the late 18th Century. Antonio Catchot appears to have immigrated to the United States circa 1850, while his wife arrived in 1853 from Germany. Their children were: Elizabeth C. Camba Dunn (1854-1927), Joseph S. “Joe Tony” Catchot (1858-1919), Mary C. Bellande (1861-1931), and Antonio “Toy” Catchot Jr. (1868-1948).\n\nThe Camba family left Ocean Springs for New Orleans circa 1885. Shortly thereafter, Frank H. Camba died at the Louisiana Insane Asylum at Jackson, Louisiana. His remains were interred in the Girard Street Cemetery at New Orleans. When the Louisiana Superdome was erected in the 1970s, the cemetery had to be removed. Camba’s remains were probably sent to the Greenwood Cemetery for internment.(Walter F. Camba Jr., March 1997)\n\nJohn M. Dunn\n\nFrank H. Camba’s widow, Mrs. Elizabeth C. Camba married John M. Dunn (1853-1932) at the St. Alphonsus Church in Ocean Springs in October 1887.

Camba Jr., March 1997)\n\nEva Louisa Camba\n\nEva Louisa Camba (1880-1914), sometimes called Eva Catchot, was the illegitimate half-sister of Walter F. Camba. Her parents were Frank H. Camba (1853-1885) and Mary Catchot (1860-1931), the sister of Mrs. Frank H. Camba. Eva was born at New Orleans, and carried her mother's maiden name, Catchot, until her marriage. She married Issac Clayton Chance, a protestant, of Rome, Georgia on March 8, 1911, at the St. Alphonsus Catholic Church in Ocean Springs, Mississippi. His parents were Isaac Chance and Etheline Hobbs. While growing up in Rome, Georgia, Issac Chance knew Ellen Axson (1860-1914), who married Woodrow Wilson (1856-1924), the 28th President of the United States.(The Pascagoula Democrat-Star, May 21, 1880, p. 3 and The Ocean Springs News, August 15, 1914)\n\nIssac and Eva Camba Chance had a daughter, Mary Etheline Chance, who was born in October 1911. The Chances lived at No. 68 Church Street in Ashville, North Carolina. Eva Catchot Chance died on November 4, 1914. Her remains were sent to Ocean Springs for burial in the Evergreen Cemetery.(The Ocean Springs News, November 14, 1914, p. 2)\n\nCamba Cottage- 520 Rayburn Avenue\n\nIn June 1924, Mary Catchot Bellande (1861-1931) conveyed for $1200 a Queen Anne cottage on the east side of Rayburn Avenue at Ocean Springs to Walter F. Camba. The small, cottage at present day 502 Rayburn Avenue was utilized by the Cambas as a retreat from New Orleans. (JXCO, Ms. Land Deed Bk. 76, pp. 431-432).\n\nThe small, one-story, wood framed, structure was built circa 1880. It has a front gabled roof with imbricated shingles in the gable. The projecting wrap-around gallery has turned posts and sawn brackets. There are shed and gabled-roofed additions on the north and east elevations.\n\nMr. Camba sold his sanctuary to Roland Lovelace (1889-1967) and spouse, Valera Pickel (1910-1977), in April 1951.

Mary Colligan was first generation Irish probably born at New Orleans.\n\nHenry Colligan made his livelihood as a gardener and farmer. He patented several forty acre tracts of land from the U.S. Government in March 1854. These were the SW/4 of the NW/4 and the NW/4 of the SW/4 of Section 20, T7S-R8W. This land later became the property of J.C. Wright (1879-1941) and his brother-in-law, Texas oilman, Haroldson Lafayette Hunt (1889-1974). Here Wright operated the Fort Bayou Dairy, raised cattle, and cultivated pecans.(JXCO, Ms. Land Deed Bk. 12, pp. 545-547)\n\nHenry and Mary Colligan had three children: James Robert (1855-1905), May (1856-pre 1870), and John (1859-1893).\n\nJames Robert Colligan (1855-1905) married Ellen E. Birdrow (1860-1926), a native of Louisiana. Her father may have been from France, while her mother, Theresa Birdrow Bird (1843-1920), was a native of the Magnolia State. Mrs. Birdrow appears to have been widowed circa 1870. She then married a Bird (died pre-1900) who was a native of Pennsylvania. Their children were: James (1876-1918), Jesse Galle (1880-1942), William (1883-1956), and Samuel (1886-1925). Theresa Bird acquired lands in the Cox Avenue area from Sarah A. VanCleave in 1887.\n\nJames R. Colligan made his living initially working as a farmer with his father and then later as a carpenter. In 1900, he was employed on the bridge gang for the L&N Railroad. James and Ellen Colligan's children were: James H. Colligan (1888-1951), Hattie V. Hoffman (1889-1958), Mae C. Ryan (1892-1966), Nancy C. Bertuccini (1894-1984), Ellen C. McKay (1896-1951+), Jasper Colligan (1899-1951+), and Jessie C. Illing (1903-1972). The Colligans resided on the west side of Cox Avenue.\n\nJames Henry Colligan (1888-1951) was a plumber and electrician commencing that profession before 1910. He may have apprenticed under George W. Dale (1872-1953) who was probably the senior plumber at Ocean Springs at this time. When Colligan had his own plumbing business, Mayor Albert S. Westbrook (1900-1980) worked with him before joining the L&N Railroad.\n\nEllen Colligan's brother, George Birdrow (1865-1923), was a carpenter and building contractor at Ocean Springs. In the 1920s, James H. Colligan left Ocean Springs for Texas. By 1929, he had settled his young family at Kenner, Louisiana. At Louisiana, Colligan was employed during the Great Depression helping to construct the Bonne Carre Spillway near Norco. He later worked for the East Jefferson Parish Waterworks and did carpentry work.\n\nJames H. Colligan married Catherine Cunningham (1900-1955). She was a native of New Orleans and met Colligan when she came to Ocean Springs on a vacation. At the time, Catherine Cunningham was employed by the D.H. Holmes Company. This organization provided the opportunity for its female employees to spend a week at Ocean Springs each summer for $7.00. They stayed at \"Haven on the Hill\", the F.J. Lundy home located at LaFontaine and Washington. Mrs. Hilda chaperoned the young ladies when they were visited by the young men of Ocean Springs. The Colligans met in this manner.\n\nJames and Catherine Colligan had three children born at Louisiana: Louise Wilbert (1921), James H. Colligan, Jr. (1926-1926), and Ellen Catherine Colligan (1928-1928).\n\nJasper Colligan (1899-1951+) was a plumber for the L&N Railroad. He left Ocean Springs in the 1920s and lived briefly at New Orleans where he met his wife, Lillian. The Colligans spent the remainder of their years at Mobile. They had a daughter, Claire Danks (1926), who was born at New Orleans.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDALE FAMILY\n\nWilliam F.

Dale, and George Dale (1901-1953+)\n\nWilliam ‘Willy’ Frederic Dale was born March 4, 1899, at Ocean Springs. He was known in the community as Willy Dale. His parents were George William Dale (1872-1953) and Harriet ‘Hattie’ Rose Seymour (1876-1956), the daughter of Narcisse Seymour (1849-1931) and Carolyn V. Krohn (1847-1895). They were married on December 9, 1897 at the St. Alphonsus CatholicChurch. George W. Dale was baptized into the Roman Catholic Church on June 27, 1897, several months before his marriage to Miss Seymour.(Lepre, 1991, p. 78)\n\nCatherine Dana Dale (1852-1934)\n\n[Courtesy of Dr. Judy Bassham-Niceville, Florida]\n\nGeorge W. Dale was a native of Hayward, California. His parents were William Dale and Catherine Dana (1852-1934). William Dale made his livelihood as a plumber and taught the trade to his sons at Hayward, California. Catherine Dana Dale was a native of Sacramento and had lived at Hayward since 1869. George W. Dale settled at Ocean Springs in the 1890s and made his livelihood as an L&N Railroad employee, tinsmith and plumber. In 1909, he went into the hardware and plumbing business with Joseph B. Garrard (1871-1915). They erected a building on the west side of Washington Avenue between Desoto and Robinson. Dale’s father-in-law, Narcisse Seymour, was a pioneer in the seafood industry at Ocean Springs operating at the foot of Washington Avenue. He was especially known for his fine raw oysters.(The Jackson County Times, November 10,1934, p. 3 and The Daily Herald, July 23, 1953, p. 13)\n\nIn the fall of 1916, George W. Dale retired from plumbing when he transferred his business to James H. Colligan (1881-1951), an employee.(The Daily Herald, September 27,1916, p. 6)\n\nAlforetta Newcomb Dale (1905-1932) and Leo B.

His siblings were: George E. Dale (1901-1953+), Leo B. Dale (1904-1954), Lillian Dale Jefferis (1906-1998), Louise Dale Scott (1909-1979+), Milledge Dale Whitworth Allen (1912-1998), John A. (1914-1975), and Gerrard W. Dale (1917-1957). The Dale family was reared at present day 1203 Calhoun Avenue near the homestead of Mrs. W.F. Dales father, Narcisse Seymour, at present day 1108 Calhoun Avenue.\n\n1203 Calhoun\n\n[image made August 1997 by Ray L. Bellande]\n\nDale family cottage\n\nIn May 1913, Narcisse Seymour conveyed Lot 9-Block 35 (Culmseig Map of Ocean Springs 1854) to Hattie Seymour Dale, his daughter. Shortly thereafter, George W. Dale erected at No. 19 Calhoun Avenue, present day 1203 Calhoun, a 1600 square-foot, vernacular, side-gabled roof cottage with a small, shed-roof porch.(Jackson Co., Ms. Land Deed Bk. 39, p. 241)\n\nIn July 1936, during the Great Depression, George and Hattie Seymour Dale sold their home to Eugenia Zeolide “Gallie” Eglin (1877-1962), the wife of Henry L. Armstrong (1874-1945). The Armstrongs resided at 1112 Bowen with their two children: Rollin “Polly” Stanley Armstrong (1907-1979), and Bernadette Armstrong Cavanah (1909-1962+). Mrs. Armstrong returned the Dale cottage to them in a sale in November 1942.(Jackson Co., Ms. Land Deed Bk. 69, p. 173 and Bk. 82, p. 282)\n\nIn July 1953, George W. Dale expired in his home at No. 19 Calhoun Avenue. His corporal remains were passed through St. Alphonsus Catholic Church and interred in the Bellande Cemetery on Dewey Avenue.(The Daily Herald, July 23, 1953, p. 13)\n\nIn her later years and post-demise of George W. Dale, Hattie Seymour Dale was domiciled in a personal care home at Mobile for two years before she expired on August 7, 1956 in Mt. Pleasant, Maury County, Tennessee, at the home of Milledge Dale Allen, her daughter and spouse of Clarence S. Allen (1906-1987). Mrs. Dale’s corporal remains were returned to Ocean Springs and interred in the Bellande Cemetery.(The Daily Herald, August 9, 1956, p. 2)\n\nMilledge Dale Allen was appointed executrix of her mother’s estate, which consisted solely of her residence at No. 19 Calhoun. Hattie Seymour Dale’s heirs conveyed the George W. Dale cottage to Conrad and Mildred von Salzen in May 1959 for $4500.(Jackson Co., Ms. Chancery Court Cause No. 14007-December 1957 and Jackson Co., Ms. Land Deed Bk. 187, p. 512, Bk. 187, p. 514, and Bk. 187, p. 516)\n\nThe von Salzen family lived here until J.Y. Christmas III acquired the Dale cottage from them in October 1976. Mr. Christmas remains here today.(Jackson Co., Ms. Land Deed Bk. 575, p. 451)\n\nEarly Life\n\nWilly Dale attended local schools and graduated with the Ocean Springs High School Class of 1916, which was headed by Professor Benjamin H. Ashman (1892-1983) and spouse, Mildred D. Ashman (1890-1975). Among his classmates who would also find success in their chosen careers were: Edward A. Bellande (1897-1978), A. Lynd Gottsche (1902-1974), and Walter B. Holloway (1900-1965).\n\nOn January 20, 1920, Willy Dale married Ethel Sophia Endt (1900-1978), the daughter of Anthony J. “Tony” Endt (1870-1948) and Johanna Friedericka Wendel (1873-1931). Their nuptial ceremony took place at St. Alphonsus Catholic Church and was presided over by the Reverend Joseph H. Chauvin (1867-1959). Shortly after the wedding, Willy Dale moved to Oklahoma. His wife joined him later.(The Jackson County Times, January 17,1920, p. 5 and Jackson Co., Ms. MRB 13, p. 274)\n\nThe parents of Ethel Endt Dale were natives of New Orleans and the children of German immigrants. Ethel’s parents had married October 29, 1896 at St. Alphonsus Catholic Church.\n\n(Lepre, 1991, p. 103 and JXCO, Ms. MRB 6, p. 70)\n\n1406 Porter\n\n[L-R: images made April 1990 and August 1997 by Ray L. Bellande]\n\nDale-Marion home\n\nIn March 1920, Ethel Endt Dale acquired Lot 5-Block 33 (Culmseig Map 1854), from Elijah Brown of Washington D.C. Here the Dales built their familial home at 1406 Porter Street and reared their two children: Thelma Dale Bradford Christopherson (b. 1921) and William F. Dale Jr. (1926-1979). In November 1989, before his demise, Willy Dale sold his Porter Street home to Thelma Dale Christopherson, his daughter, and Gary W. Christopherson, his grandson, who reside in South San Francisco, Lake Co., California.(Jackson Co., Ms. Land Deed Bk. 48, p. 3 and Bk. 949, p. 31)\n\nIn June 1990, shortly after Willy Dales’s death, Thelma and Gary W. Christopherson vended the structure to Andrew A. Marion Jr. and Melissa Schloegel Marion, his wife. They relocated to Seapointe in 1996 and conveyed the Dale cottage to Andrew’s parents, Andrew A. Marion and Martha B. Marion, who remain here on Porter Street today adjacent to Freedom Field..(Jackson Co., Ms. Land Deed Bk. 959, p. 656 and Bk. 1084, p. 660)\n\nDale Motor Company [circa 1927]\n\n9 Porter Street\n\n[from The Ocean Springs Record, June 22, 1972, p. 1]\n\nMechanical genius\n\nAs a young man Dale learned to repair automobiles. In May 1926, he went into business as the Dale Motor Company. He opened a 3500 square-foot garage on West Porter, in a structure which was once the locus of the J.J. O’Keefe Livery Stable. It was of the most modern on the entire coast. Dale's machines and tools were mostly electrically powered, state of the art for the period. Among his inventory of apparatuses were: the electrical valve resurfacing and reseating tool; electrical riveting; counter-sinking machine for relining brakes; cylinder hones; aligning gauges for front wheels; acetylene welding and cutting torch; weaver wrecker for hauling in disabled vehicles; air pump; Weaver tire change stand; Humpy-Cooper re-babbitting machines and other appurtenances applicable to automobile repair. At this time Willy Dale was the local Chevrolet dealer. He also sold gasoline, oil, and greases and his Porter Street auto service business.(The Jackson County Times, June 12, 1926)\n\nMilledge Dale Whitworth Allen (1912-1998)\n\n[Milledge Dale standing in front of Willy Dale's Ocean Kid, circa 1928. Courtesy of Dr. Judy Bassham-Niceville, Florida]\n\nMotorboat Racing\n\nWilly Dale was a passionate man and motorboat racing and fishing were his salient avocations. His Ocean Wave was the only competitive speed boat at Ocean Springs. The watercraft was powered by a Lockwood Motor. Willy’s Dale Motor Company was the agent for Johnson and Lockwood outboard motors.\n\nOn May 10, 1928, Willy Dale participated in a motorboat regatta in conjunction with the dedication of the Harrison County seawall. Dale in his Ocean Wave, won three trophies. He piloted his light craft to victory in the Class B races. Willy also captured second place in two other class events. He was a contender in a fourth event, but his craft was damaged.(The Jackson County Times, May 12, 1928, p. 2)\n\nOn June 10, 1928, Dale participated in the Pass Christian Motor Boat Regatta. This time he was in a small light craft called the Ocean Kid. This boat developed great speed from its Johnson outboard motor. Willy Dale expertly drove his craft to first place in its class, and finished second in a race against all competitors piloting craft of all sizes and horsepower. (The Jackson County Times, June 16, 1928, p. 3)\n\nTwo weeks later, Willy Dale ran the Ocean Kid in Back Bay at a race course off Bay Terrace. He had recently been experimenting with the small craft and the June 24th race was a ‘test race’ for him. Willy’s experimentations proved deleterious to his watercraft. The Ocean Kid ran well in the first contest finishing second in a hotly contested race with The Last Flea of Biloxi. Dale was not able to race again that day.(The Jackson County Times, June 23, 1928, p. 3 and June 30, 1928, p. 3 )\n\nWilly Dale made a successful appearance at the Biloxi Yacht Club Regatta held in July 1928, piloting the Red Gold, built by a Biloxi party with one of Dale’s ten and one-half, horsepower, Lockwood engine. The Red Gold averaged thirty-five miles per hour and swept every class race.(The Jackson County Times, July 14, 1928, p. 3)\n\nIn August 1928, Dale drove his Lightning to first place finishes in the Class B and Class C outboard motor races at Bay St. Louis. Competitors were from New Orleans and other Mississippi coast towns.(The Jackson County Times, August 25, 1928, p. 1)\n\nEntrepreurial years\n\nAs previously mentioned, Willy Dale commenced his long career as a local entrepreneur in 1926 with the opening of Dale Motor Company on West Porter Street. Mr. Dale had leased the “O’Keefe Livery Stable Lot”, east of the mansion in August 1927, from the J.J. O’Keefe family. Here he operated a garage and initially sold Texaco products. Mr. Dale later vended Shell gasoline here.(JXCO Land Deed Bk. 70, pp. 196-200)\n\nIn September 1929, he Dale began Dale Motor Sales, Inc. with two partners, Arthur W. Hersey and Arthur .T. ‘Ted’ Hersey. This enterprise was an agency that represented and vended Chrysler an"
