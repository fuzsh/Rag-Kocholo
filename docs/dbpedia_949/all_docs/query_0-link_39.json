        "text": "Benjamin Géza \"Ben\" Affleck-Boldt was born on August 15, 1972 in Berkeley, California and raised in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to mother Chris Anne (Boldt), a school teacher, and father Timothy Byers \"Tim\" Affleck, a social worker. Ben has a younger brother, actor Casey Affleck, who was born in 1975. He is of mostly English, Irish, German, and Scottish ancestry. His middle name, Géza, is after a Hungarian family friend who was a Holocaust survivor.\n\nAffleck wanted to be an actor ever since he could remember, and his first acting experience was for a Burger King commercial, when he was on the PBS mini-series, The Voyage of the Mimi (1984). It was also at that age when Ben met his lifelong friend and fellow actor, Matt Damon. They played little league together and took drama classes together. Ben's teen years consisted of mainly TV movies and small television appearances including In den Fängen eines Fremden (1987) and Auf Kollisionskurs (1988). He made his big introduction into feature films in 1993 when he was cast in Confusion - Sommer der Ausgeflippten (1993). After that, he did mostly independent films like Kevin Smith's Mallrats (1995) and Chasing Amy (1997) which were great for Ben's career, receiving renowned appreciation for his works at the Sundance film festival. But the success he was having in independent films didn't last much longer and things got a little shaky for Ben. He was living in an apartment with his brother Casey and friend Matt, getting tired of being turned down for the big roles in films and being given the forgettable supporting ones. Since Matt was having the same trouble, they decided to write their own script, where they could call all the shots. So, after finishing the script for Good Will Hunting: Der gute Will Hunting (1997), they gave it to their agent, Patrick Whitesell, who showed it to a few Hollywood studios, finally being accepted by Castle Rock. It was great news for the two, but Castle Rock wasn't willing to give Ben and Matt the control over the project they were hoping for. It was friend Kevin Smith who took it to the head of Miramax who bought the script giving Ben and Matt the control they wanted and, in December 5, 1997, Good Will Hunting: Der gute Will Hunting (1997) was released, making the two unknown actors famous. The film was nominated for 9 Academy Awards and won two, including Best Original Screenplay for Ben and Matt. The film marked Ben's breakthrough role, in which he was given for the first time the chance to choose roles instead of having to go through grueling auditions constantly.\n\nAffleck chose such roles in the blockbusters Armageddon - Das jüngste Gericht (1998), Shakespeare in Love (1998), and Pearl Harbor (2001). In the early years of the 2000s, he also starred in the box office hits Spurwechsel (2002), Der Anschlag (2002), and Daredevil (2003), as well as the disappointing comedies Liebe mit Risiko - Gigli (2003) and Wie überleben wir Weihnachten? (2004). While the mid 2000s were considered a career downturn for Affleck, he received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in Die Hollywood-Verschwörung (2006). In the several years following, he played supporting roles, including in the films Smokin' Aces (2006), Er steht einfach nicht auf Dich (2009), State of Play - Stand der Dinge (2009), and Ausgequetscht (2009). He ventured into directing in 2007, with the thriller Gone Baby Gone - Kein Kinderspiel (2007), which starred his brother, Casey Affleck, and was well received. He then directed, co-wrote, and starred in The Town - Stadt ohne Gnade (2010), which was named to the National Board of Review Top Ten Films of the year. For the political thriller Argo (2012), which he directed and starred in, Affleck won the Golden Globe Award and BAFTA Award for Best Director, and the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, and BAFTA Award for Best Picture (Affleck's second Oscar win).\n\nIn 2014, Affleck headlined the book adaptation thriller Gone Girl - Das perfekte Opfer (2014). He starred as Bruce Wayne/Batman in the superhero film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), Suicide Squad (2016), and Justice League (2017). He reprised the role in Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021) and he will next appear as Batman in Aquaman - Lost Kingdom (2023) and The Flash (2023).\n\nRecently he has given praise-worthy performances in Out of Play - Der Weg zurück (2020) as a recovering alcoholic, The Last Duel (2021) (notably he also co-wrote the script), and a scene-stealing golden globe nominated performance in The Tender Bar (2021).\n\nJohn Cusack is, like most of his characters, an unconventional hero. Wary of fame and repelled by formulaic Hollywood fare, he has built a successful career playing underdogs and odd men out--all the while avoiding the media spotlight. John was born in Evanston, Illinois, to an Irish-American family. With the exception of mom Nancy (née Carolan), a former math teacher, the Cusack clan is all show business: father Dick Cusack was an actor and filmmaker, and John's siblings Joan Cusack, Ann Cusack, Bill Cusack and Susie Cusack are all thespians by trade. Like his brother and sisters, John became a member of Chicago's Piven Theatre Workshop while he was still in elementary school. By age 12, he already had several stage productions, commercial voice overs and industrial films under his belt. He made his feature film debut at 17, acting alongside Rob Lowe and Andrew McCarthy in the romantic comedy Class - Vom Klassenzimmer zur Klassefrau (1983). His next role, as a member of Anthony Michael Hall's geek brigade in Das darf man nur als Erwachsener (1984), put him on track to becoming a teen-flick fixture. Cusack remained on the periphery of the Brat Pack, sidestepping the meteoric rise and fall of most of his contemporaries, but he stayed busy with leads in films like Der Volltreffer (1985) and Lanny dreht auf (1985). Young Cusack is probably best remembered for what could be considered his last adolescent role: the stereo-blaring romantic Lloyd Dobler in Teen Lover (1989). A year later, he hit theaters as a grown-up, playing a bush-league con man caught between his manipulative mother and headstrong girlfriend in Grifters (1990).\n\nThe next few years were relatively quiet for the actor, but he filled in the gaps with off-screen projects. He directed and produced several shows for the Chicago-based theater group The New Criminals, which he founded in 1988 (modeling it after Tim Robbins' Actors' Gang in Los Angeles) to promote political and avant-garde stage work. Four years later, Cusack's high school friends Steve Pink and D.V. DeVincentis joined him in starting a sister company for film, New Crime Productions. New Crime's first feature was the sharply written comedy Ein Mann, ein Mord (1997), which touched off a career renaissance for Cusack. In addition to co-scripting, he starred as a world-weary hit man who goes home for his ten-year high school reunion and tries to rekindle a romance with the girl he stood up on prom night (Minnie Driver). In an instance of life imitating art, Cusack actually did go home for his ten-year reunion (to honor a bet about the film's financing) and ended up in a real-life romance with Driver. Cusack's next appearance was as a federal agent (or, as he described it, \"the first post-Heston, non-biblical action star in sandals\") in Con Air (1997), a movie he chose because he felt it was time to make smart business decisions. He followed that with Clint Eastwood's Mitternacht im Garten von Gut und Böse (1997), in which he played a Yankee reporter entangled in a Savannah murder case.\n\nCusack has always favored offbeat material, so it was no surprise when he turned up in the fiercely original Being John Malkovich (1999). Long-haired, bearded and bespectacled, he was almost unrecognizable in the role of a frustrated puppeteer who stumbles across a portal into the brain of actor John Malkovich. The convincing performance won him a Best Actor nomination at the Independent Spirit Awards. In 2000, Cusack was back to his clean-shaven self in High Fidelity (2000), another New Crime production. He worked with Steve Pink and D.V. DeVincentis to adapt Nick Hornby's popular novel (relocating the story to their native Chicago), then starred as the sarcastic record store owner who revisits his \"Top 5\" breakups to find out why he's so unlucky in love. The real Cusack has been romantically linked with several celebs, including Driver, Alison Eastwood, Claire Forlani and Neve Campbell. He's also something of a family man, acting frequently opposite sister Joan Cusack and pulling other Cusacks into his films on a regular basis. He seems pleased with the spate of projects on his horizon, but admits that he still hasn't reached his ultimate goal: to be involved in a \"great piece of art\".\n\nSean \"Diddy\" Combs has cemented himself as one of the most successful entrepreneurs and cultural icons of all-time. Standing as a respected symbol of relentless ambition, for three decades Combs' unrivaled influence is only matched by an unparalleled ability to innovate, evolve, and consistently defy convention.\n\nCombs began his career in the music industry as an intern at Uptown Records, where he quickly rose through the ranks and played a pivotal role in launching the careers of Mary J. Blige and Jodeci. By 1993, he had established Bad Boy Entertainment by the following year, partnered with Clive Davis's Arista BMG in a 50/50 joint venture. The label's debut release, Notorious B.I.G.'s \"Ready to Die,\" set the stage for a roster of memorable artists including Faith Evans, 112, Mase, Total, and The Lox, and later included MGK, French Montana, Janelle Monáe among many others. For over 30 years, the label has amassed countless Grammy Awards, Billboard number ones, and built an extensive catalog of classic hits, culminating in over 400 million albums sold and over 3 billion streams to date.\n\nAfter the tragic and untimely death of The Notorious B.I.G. in 1996, Combs paid tribute to his late friend by stepping into the spotlight as a solo artist, releasing \"No Way Out\" in 1997. His career has since soared, earning him numerous accolades and awards, including multiple Grammy Awards, a slew of number 1 hits, and global recognition. He has produced hundreds of songs and has collaborated with the biggest names in music and performed on stages around the world. In 2022, Combs announced his official return to music with the launch of his new all-R&B label, Love Records. That same year, he took center stage at the Billboard Music Awards as the host, performer, and executive producer. He was also honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the BET Awards and by year's end he celebrated a milestone with his song \"Gotta Move On\" featuring Bryson Tiller, marking his 11th number one hit. In 2023, Combs continued to make significant contributions to the industry by making the unprecedented move of reassigning his portion of Bad Boy Publishing to the artists, writers, and producers who helped him build the label. That same year, the Apollo Theater honored him with an Icon Award, and he received the MTV VMA Global Icon Award, where he performed a medley of hits. He released his critically acclaimed \"Love Album: Off the Grid\" under Love Records, which climbed to the top of the charts and earned him a Grammy nomination for Best R&B Album.\n\nCombs has appeared in dozens of films and is recognized for his role as both a television and film producer. Marking his acting debut in 2001 with a heartfelt performance as Lawrence Musgrave, Halle Berry's husband in the critically acclaimed film \"Monster's Ball.\" He showcased his versatility in 2007 by playing the leading role in \"A Raisin in the Sun\" on Broadway, later reprising this role for its ABC television adaptation, which he also executive produced. This adaptation earned three Emmy nominations, and Combs received an NAACP Award for Best Actor. In 2010, he delivered a memorable performance as Sergio in \"Get Him to the Greek,\" alongside Jonah Hill and Russell Brand. His role as an executive producer is equally notable, particularly for the Academy Award-winning documentary \"Undefeated\" in 2012, the critically acclaimed film \"DOPE,\" and \"Two Distant Strangers,\" which won an Oscar in 2021. In television, he has produced numerous shows, including 12 seasons of \"Making the Band,\" multiple seasons of \"I Want to Work for Diddy,\" and \"The Four.\" Combs expanded his influence beyond music and entertainment building a successful portfolio of businesses under Combs Global. He launched the Sean John brand in 1998, steering it to success for over two decades, earning many accolades including a prestigious CFDA award until its sale in 2016. In a strategic move, Combs reacquired Sean John in 2021 from Global Brands Group, with plans to reconceptualize the brand. Marking this new era, he unveiled a couture look at the 2023 Met Gala. In 2007, Combs partnered with Diageo on a strategic alliance for Cîroc Vodka. They expanded that partnership in 2013 with the acquisition of luxury tequila brand DeLeón Tequila. After a successful 15 year relationship, the partnership ended in 2024. Combs launched Revolt Media & TV, the first Black-owned multi-platform cable music network in 2013. The network now reaches over 80 million homes and 20 million viewers digitally, with carriers like Time Warner, Xfinity, and Verizon Fios. Revolt attracts more than 50 million young adults through television, digital properties, social and mobile. Additionally, Combs has fitness water brand Aquahydrate, with Mark Walberg. In 2023, Combs launched Empower Global, a global online Black marketplace.\n\nCombs applied the same drive and entrepreneurial spirit from his entertainment and business success to his philanthropic work and political activism. He has given millions of dollars to support charitable and social causes focused on the underserved and Black communities across the nation, particularly in education and entrepreneurship. Combs launched several initiatives to help the underserved, including Our Fair Share in 2020, a financial readiness platform designed to help diverse business owners and entrepreneurs secure capital. The following year, he introduced the Excellence Program, an internship initiative with Endeavor aimed at students aspiring to work in the entertainment industry. In 2023, Combs deepened his commitment to historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) with a $1 million donation to Howard University, his alma mater. He also unveiled a $1 million investment fund at Invest Fest in Atlanta to foster financial literacy and economic empowerment. Furthermore, he demonstrated his support for HBCUs by donating $1 million to the Jackson State University Football program, underscoring his commitment to the growth and support of HBCU institutions and their enduring legacy.\n\nBilly Crystal was born on March 14, 1948 in Manhattan, New York, and was raised on Long Island. He is the youngest of three sons born to Helen (Gabler) and Jack Crystal. His father was a well-known concert promoter who co-founded Commodore Records and his mother was a homemaker. His family were Jewish emigrants from Russia, Austria, and Lithuania. With his father in the music business, Billy was no stranger to some of the top performers of the time. Legends such as Billie Holiday, Pee Wee Russell, and Eddie Condon regularly stopped by the Crystal household. At age 15, Billy faced a personal tragedy when his father died of a heart attack at the relatively young age of 54. This gave Billy a real appreciation of what his dad was able to accomplish while alive and what his mother did to keep the family together. Despite this tragedy, Billy was very upbeat and likable as a kid. He had a unique talent for making people laugh.\n\nWith television becoming a new medium, Billy got his influence from shows like The Honeymooners (1955), and \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" and performers like Alan King, Ernie Kovacs and Jonathan Winters. He started doing stand-up comedy at the age of 16. However, his real dream was to be a professional baseball player. His idol growing up was Yankees outfielder Mickey Mantle. He spent long hours in the summers playing softball in the middle of Park Avenue with his brothers and his father, a former pitcher at St. John's University . At Long Beach High, Billy played second base and was varsity captain in his senior year. This earned him a baseball scholarship from Marshall University in West Virginia which he accepted. However, he would never end up playing a game as the baseball program was suspended during his freshman year. This would lead him to leave the university and move back to New York. He then enrolled at nearby Nassau Community College, majoring in theater. It was there that he met and fell in love with a dancer named Janice Goldfinger. They would get married in 1970 and have two daughters. Shortly after, Billy got accepted in New York University, where he majored in Film and TV Direction. While at NYU, he studied under legendary filmmaker Martin Scorsese. He also worked as house manager and usher on a production of \"You're A Good Man, Charlie Brown.\"\n\nAfter receiving a Bachelor of Fine Arts from NYU in 1970, Billy temporarily worked as a substitute teacher until he was able to get gigs as a stand-up comic. He formed his own improv group, 3's Company, and opened for musicians like Barry Manilow. His impression of Howard Cosell interviewing Muhammad Ali became a huge hit with the audience. He left Long Beach for Hollywood in August of 1976 in the hopes of trying to land a role on a television series. It only took a year before he got his big break when he was chosen for the role of gay character Jodie Dallas on the controversial ABC sitcom Die Ausgeflippten (1977). This would be the first time that an American TV show would feature an openly gay character as a regular. The show ran successfully for four seasons and helped to jump-start Billy's previously stagnant career. After Die Ausgeflippten (1977) ended in 1981, Billy continued to do his stand-up routine, which was now attracting a larger audience with his growing celebrity status. During this time, he made many TV guest appearances and even hosted his own short-lived variety show, The Billy Crystal Comedy Hour (1982).\n\nHe became a regular on Saturday Night Live (1975) in 1984 where his Fernando Lamas impression with the catchphrase \"You Look Mahvellous\" was a huge hit with viewers. This would lead to appearances in feature-length films such as Diese Zwei sind nicht zu fassen (1986) and Schmeiß' die Mama aus dem Zug (1987). In 1986, along with Whoopi Goldberg and Robin Williams, he started Comic Relief, an annual stand-up comedy show which helped to raise money for housing and medical care for the homeless. The show has since grown substantially with the continued support of all three comics. Billy's career would peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s. His roles in the blockbuster movies Harry und Sally (1989) and City Slickers - Die Großstadt-Helden (1991) helped to establish himself as one of Hollwood's top movie stars. This star status was further validated when he was chosen to host the annual Oscars in 1990, an honor in which he would repeat seven more times. He made his big screen directorial debut in the 1992 film Der letzte Komödiant - Mr. Saturday Night (1992), which was about a washed-up stand-up comic who refuses to retire. He also wrote, produced and starred in the film. Although the film was not a huge hit, it proved that Billy was much more than an actor and comedian. In the following years, Billy continued to act in, produce, and direct several films.\n\nHe had his share of hits (Reine Nervensache (1999), America's Sweethearts (2001)) and some flops (Ein Vater zuviel (1997), My Giant - Zwei auf großem Fuß (1998)). His role in as a therapist to mobster Robert De Niro in Reine Nervensache (1999) earned him critical praise. In 2001, Billy parlayed his childhood love of baseball and Mickey Mantle into a feature film. The movie, 61 (2001), which premiered on HBO, centered on the relationship between Mantle and Roger Maris and their 1961 pursuit of Babe Ruth's home run record. The film for which Billy served as director and executive producer, garnered 12 Emmy nominations in all.\n\nOffscreen, Billy remains married to Janice Crystal and they have homes in California and New York. Both of his daughters are involved in the film business. Jennifer Crystal Foley is an aspiring actress, appearing in 61 (2001), while Lindsay Crystal is an aspiring filmmaker, creating and directing the documentary My Uncle Berns (2003).\n\nFew actors in the world have had a career quite as diverse as Leonardo DiCaprio's. DiCaprio has gone from relatively humble beginnings, as a supporting cast member of the sitcom Unser lautes Heim (1985) and low budget horror movies, such as Critters 3 - Die Kuschelkiller kommen (1991), to a major teenage heartthrob in the 1990s, as the hunky lead actor in movies such as William Shakespeares Romeo & Julia (1996) and Titanic (1997), to then become a leading man in Hollywood blockbusters, made by internationally renowned directors such as Martin Scorsese and Christopher Nolan.\n\nLeonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio was born in Los Angeles, California, the only child of Irmelin DiCaprio (née Indenbirken) and former comic book artist George DiCaprio. His father is of Italian and German descent, and his mother, who is German-born, is of German, Ukrainian and Russian ancestry. His middle name, \"Wilhelm\", was his maternal grandfather's first name. Leonardo's father had achieved minor status as an artist and distributor of cult comic book titles, and was even depicted in several issues of American Splendor, the cult semi-autobiographical comic book series by the late 'Harvey Pekar', a friend of George's. Leonardo's performance skills became obvious to his parents early on, and after signing him up with a talent agent who wanted Leonardo to perform under the stage name \"Lenny Williams\", DiCaprio began appearing on a number of television commercials and educational programs.\n\nDiCaprio began attracting the attention of producers, who cast him in small roles in a number of television series, such as Roseanne (1988) and Lassie (1989), but it wasn't until 1991 that DiCaprio made his film debut in Critters 3 - Die Kuschelkiller kommen (1991), a low-budget horror movie. While Critters 3 - Die Kuschelkiller kommen (1991) did little to help showcase DiCaprio's acting abilities, it did help him develop his show-reel, and attract the attention of the people behind the hit sitcom Unser lautes Heim (1985), in which Leonardo was cast in the \"Cousin Oliver\" role of a young homeless boy who moves in with the Seavers. While DiCaprio's stint on Unser lautes Heim (1985) was very short, as the sitcom was axed the year after he joined, it helped bring DiCaprio into the public's attention and, after the sitcom ended, DiCaprio began auditioning for roles in which he would get the chance to prove his acting chops.\n\nLeonardo took up a diverse range of roles in the early 1990s, including a mentally challenged youth in Gilbert Grape - Irgendwo in Iowa (1993), a young gunslinger in Schneller als der Tod (1995) and a drug addict in one of his most challenging roles to date, Jim Carroll in Jim Carroll - In den Straßen von New York (1995), a role which the late River Phoenix originally expressed interest in. While these diverse roles helped establish Leonardo's reputation as an actor, it wasn't until his role as Romeo Montague in Baz Luhrmann's William Shakespeares Romeo & Julia (1996) that Leonardo became a household name, a true movie star. The following year, DiCaprio starred in another movie about doomed lovers, Titanic (1997), which went on to beat all box office records held before then, as, at the time, Titanic (1997) became the highest grossing movie of all time, and cemented DiCaprio's reputation as a teen heartthrob. Following his work on Titanic (1997), DiCaprio kept a low profile for a number of years, with roles in Der Mann in der eisernen Maske (1998) and the low-budget The Beach (2000) being some of his few notable roles during this period.\n\nIn 2002, he burst back into screens throughout the world with leading roles in Catch Me If You Can (2002) and Gangs of New York (2002), his first of many collaborations with director Martin Scorsese. With a current salary of $20 million a movie, DiCaprio is now one of the biggest movie stars in the world. However, he has not limited his professional career to just acting in movies, as DiCaprio is a committed environmentalist, who is actively involved in many environmental causes, and his commitment to this issue led to his involvement in The 11th Hour, a documentary movie about the state of the natural environment. As someone who has gone from small roles in television commercials to one of the most respected actors in the world, DiCaprio has had one of the most diverse careers in cinema. DiCaprio continued to defy conventions about the types of roles he would accept, and with his career now seeing him leading all-star casts in action thrillers such as Departed: Unter Feinden (2006), Shutter Island (2010) and Christopher Nolan's Inception (2010), DiCaprio continues to wow audiences by refusing to conform to any cliché about actors.\n\nIn 2012, he played a mustache twirling villain in Django Unchained (2012), and then tragic literary character Jay Gatsby in Der große Gatsby (2013) and Jordan Belfort in The Wolf of Wall Street (2013).\n\nDiCaprio is passionate about environmental and humanitarian causes, having donated $1,000,000 to earthquake relief efforts in 2010, the same year he contributed $1,000,000 to the Wildlife Conservation Society.\n\nThis versatile, eclectic, rather wanderlust country crossover star known for his classic ballads (\"Always On My Mind\"), autobiographical road songs (\"On the Road Again\") and catchy rhythms (\"Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys\") started out life as Willie Hugh Nelson on April 30, 1933, in Depression-era Abbot, Texas. He is the son of Myrle Marie (Greenhaw) and Ira Doyle Nelson, a mechanic. After his parents got divorced, in which his mother moved to Oregon and his father remarried, he and sister Bobbie Lee were raised by their gospel-singing paternal grandparents, who introduced them to music. Working in the cotton fields, Willie was handed his first guitar at age six and within a short time was writing woeful country songs and playing in polka bands.\n\nDuring his teenage years he played at high school dances and honky-tonks. He also worked for a local radio station and by graduation time he had become a DJ with his own radio show. Briefly serving a stint with the Air Force (discharged because of a bad back, which would plague him throughout his life), he sold his first song called \"No Place For Me\" while getting by with menial jobs as a janitor and door-to-door Bible salesman. Married in 1952 to a full-blooded Cherokee, he and first wife Martha had two children.\n\nWillie initially came to be known in Nashville for selling his songs to well-established country artists such as Patsy Cline (\"Crazy\"), Faron Young (\"Hello Walls\") and Ray Price (\"Night Life\"). In 1962 he recorded a successful duet with singer Shirley Collie, whom he would later take as his second wife, but his career didn't progress despite joining the Grand 'Ol Opry. In the early 1970s, after extensive touring with his band (which included sister Bobbie on the piano) and experiencing a number of career downswings, he started performing and recording his own songs instead of selling them to others. Two of his albums, \"Shotgun Willie\" and \"Phases and Stages\", helped him gain some stature. In 1975 it all came together with the album \"Red-Headed Stranger\", which would become the top-selling country music album in history and propel him into the country music stratosphere. His offbeat phrasing, distinctive nasal tones and leathery, bewhiskered hippie-styled looks set a new standard for \"outlaw\" country music.\n\nAround 1978 Willie showed himself to be a loose and natural presence in front of the camera, thus launching a film career. He had roles in several movies, his first opposite Robert Redford and Jane Fonda in Der elektrische Reiter (1979). His took to leading roles as a country music star in Honeysuckle Rose (1980), which would include a number of his songs on the soundtrack. He played opposite James Caan and Tuesday Weld in Der Einzelgänger (1981) and a legendary outlaw in the western Barbarosa (1982). In the movie Red Headed Stranger (1986), which was adapted from his hit 1975 album, he played a preacher, and he teamed up with pal Kris Kristofferson as a pair of country singers in Der Songschreiber (1984).\n\nWillie and pal Kristofferson went on to form The Highwaymen with the late Johnny Cash and Waylon Jennings and he successfully recorded and toured with the group for a number of years. They also teamed up to remake the classic western Höllenfahrt nach Santa Fé (1939) as a TV movie (Stagecoach - Höllenfahrt nach Lordsburg (1986)). As a unique song stylist, the bearded, braided-haired, bandanna-wearing non-conformist took a number of non-country standards and made them his own, including Elvis Presley's \"You Were Always on My Mind\" and Ray Charles' \"Georgia on My Mind.\"\n\nBroaching the millennium, Willie continued to be active with film credits that would include roles in the westerns Dust to Dust (1994) and The Journeyman (2001), in addition to roles in such non-westerns as the sci-fi drama Starlight (1996); the comedy capers Der $100.000 Fisch (1997), Hawaii Crime Story (2004) and Ein Duke kommt selten allein (2005) (an updated screen version of the popular TV show); the action thriller Fighting with Anger (2007); the comedy Surfer, Dude (2008); the family dramedy Mein Nachbar der Weihnachtsmann (2013); the music fantasy Paradox (2018) which starred Neil Young and his sons Lukas Nelson and Micah Nelson; the dramatic fantasy Waiting for the Miracle to Come (2018); and Willie and Me (2023), a comedy chronicling the misadventures of a young German girl coming to America to see her idol Willie.\n\nWillie happily married fourth wife Ann-Marie in 1991 and has survived more hard times in recent years, including a $16.7-million debt to the IRS and the suicide of one of his sons, Billy. Inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1993, Nelson received the Kennedy Center Honors in 1998.\n\nDesignated the \"heartbeat\" of R&B during the 1980s and 1990s, Luther Vandross led a productive singing and songwriting life before to this preeminence. The soul balladeer's strong commitment to the art of music continued on its Grammy-winning course, even after an acute stroke in 2003 left him severely incapacitated and unable to continue public appearances.\n\nLuther Ronzoni Vandross, Jr. was born in Manhattan, New York on April 20, 1951, the baby of four children. His father, also named Luther, was an upholsterer who died of diabetes when the singer was just eight years old. Despite this sadness, his mother, a practical nurse, made sure that music was prevalent in the Vandross household, particularly gospel, soul and doo-wop. Luther was influenced by his older sister Patricia, who became a member of a doo-wop group called The Crests, and scored with the 1958 single \"Sixteen Candles\".\n\nIn high school, Luther formed his own musical group and first started to write and compose. His first big songwriting break came with \"Everybody Rejoice (Can You Feel a Brand New Day)\", which was used for the Broadway stage and film productions of \"The Wiz\". He also sang in the film's choir selections. In the 1970s, while still working his way up, Luther voiced commercial jingles (Kentucky Fried Chicken) and provided backup vocals on tour and in session work for such notables as David Bowie, Chaka Khan, Barbra Streisand, Carly Simon, Bette Midler and Donna Summer. After performing with a short-lived singing group called \"Luther\", which was formed to include the talented musicians Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards, who later formed the group, Chic, Luther returned to the background and took part in various projects for Quincy Jones and others. Insisting on creative control, Luther had a difficult time finding the right contract for himself in record-making.\n\nAt age 30, he finally recorded his first solo album with the No. 1 R&B and \"Top 20\" pop chartmaker, \"Never Too Much\". He continued steadily with such albums as \"Forever, for Always, for Love\" (1982) and \"Give Me the Reasons\" (1986), but it wasn't until 1989 that he had his first \"Top 10\" single with \"Here and Now\" (No. 6), which finally placed him securely on the love song pedestal. Such other No. 1 R&B singles would include \"Stop to Love\", \"There's Nothing Better than Love\" and \"Any Love\".\n\nA minimalist stylist whose eloquent, velvety renditions were accentuated by spot-on phrasing and effortless vocal control, his image quickly led to such unwelcome sobriquets as \"master of bedroom music\" and the restrictive label of being a \"ladies only\" act. He was also besieged by a wealth of other personal and health problems. A binge eater, his weight fluctuated through his career with his 6' 3\" frame handling a diversity of 190 to 340 pounds at various stages, aggravated by constant career pressures and a roller coaster personal and romantic life.\n\nThe never-married crooner was besieged by persistent reports that he was gay (he never denied or acknowledged the reports), rumors that threatened his ladies' man career. Moreover, Luther suffered from a mild form of diabetes, the disease that took the life of his father. In 1986, he was the driver in automobile crash that killed one passenger (a close friend) with a charge of vehicular manslaughter finally reduced to reckless driving (speeding).\n\nThe 1990s seemed, career-wise, stronger than ever again with a Top 40 hit dueting with Mariah Carey on \"Endless Love\" (1994) and the release of his No. 1 R&B signature version of \"Always and Forever\" (1994).\n\nOn camera, film and television acting appearances include a cameo in Robert Townsend's film Meteor Man (1993) and episodes of \"Beverly Hills: 90210\" (as himself) and \"Touched by An Angel\". A documentary, Luther Vandross: Always and Forever (1994), is also available. Through his career, Luther continued to write and produce for other artists including Whitney Houston, Dionne Warwick, Teddy Pendergrass, Cheryl Lynn and Aretha Franklin. Following his massive April 2003 stroke, he made a phantom return to the spotlight with the release of his CD \"Dance With My Father\" (2003), which was recorded before his illness. At the awards show, the absent Luther was rewarded with four Grammy Awards, including song of the year. The success also gave him his first No. 1 album on the pop chart and four NAACP Image Awards.\n\nThe beloved 54-year-old musician died of a heart attack on July 1, 2005 at the JFK Medical Center in Edision, New Jersey, and was survived by his Evangelist mother, Mary Ida Vandross, who was instrumental in promoting her son's last work to Grammy glory following his severe debilitation."
