        "text": "Perspectives from Kent State Fashion School Faculty and Students August 10, 2019 - May 31, 2020 Cover: 13. Colin Isaacs, “Make Amerikkka Great Again,” 2019 L2019.39.la-e Wearing Justice Perspectives from Kent State Fashion School Faculty and Students Kent State University Museum Stager and Blum Galleries August 10, 2019 - May 31, 2020 The Kent State University Museum is proud to showcase the creative expressions of our Fashion School students and faculty as presented in the exhibition Wearing Justice. This year the Kent State University community is joining together to mark the 50th anniversary of the day that now lives in infamy: May 4, 1970. Wearing Justice addresses social issues that continue to challenge us today. Some designers directly address the reverberations of May 4, while others focus on today’s global concerns from gun violence, to climate change, to corporate greed. The garments and textiles not only prod us into conversations about social activism, but also remind us of the power and deep significance carried by what we wear and how we wear it. The exhibition was spearheaded by Dr. Kim Hahn, Interim Director of the Fashion School, through conversations with Fashion School faculty. Professors Chanjuan Chen and Sue Hershberger Yoder then took up the responsibilities of organizing the call for proposals, Professors Noël PalomoLovinski, Jihyun Kim and Lauren Copeland selected the student submissions and Juror Amanda Pecsenye, curator at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, selected the faculty work. I especially wish to thank Professors Hahn, Chen and Yoder for their commitment to this project and for always being such great partners. Many thanks to Chanjuan Chen who designed this catalogue. Thanks also go to the wonderful KSU Museum staff including Sara Hume, Curator; Joanne Fenn, Collections Manager; Jim Williams, Exhibition Designer; Todd Clark, Security Manager; Bianka Sinkfield, Administrative Assistant. Both the Fashion School and the KSU Museum deeply appreciate the support of the May 4, 50th Commemoration Fund, as well as the continued support and guidance of the Dean of the College of the Arts, Dr. John Crawford-Spinelli, Effie Tsengas, Communications and Marketing Director, and Brittani Peterson, Marketing Associate.

Kennedy Brouillard & Eleonore Zurawski “Dissent is Not a Crime,” 2019, L2019.39.3ab Mahatma Gandhi 4 Juror’s Statement The arts have always been a means to navigate and explore the world around us, allowing the artist to express thoughts and process emotions and hopefully provide the audience with an opportunity for dialogue and catharsis. I enjoyed acting as a juror for Wearing Justice to see how the participants used the art of fashion design to create garments that fit the theme. The pieces I selected used technique and creativity to explore elements of social justice in garments that often provoked visceral, emotional responses from me, while still being aesthetically pleasing. I was particularly moved by those pieces that deal with the theme of May 4, 1970 at Kent State. I look forward to seeing the finished garments in person! Amanda Pecsenye curator at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Amanda Pecsenye is a curator at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame; she has worked in various roles at the museum since starting there as an intern in 2001. She is a graduate of Bowling Green State University with a B.A. in Popular Culture. Pecsenye has a special interest in new wave music of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Her recent curatorial work includes Forever Warped: 25 Years of Vans Warped Tour and portions of 2019 Inductees and Garage Gear. 5 1. Joanne Arnett “Ladylike Screaming,” 2019 Artist’s statement: Fed up? Yeah, me too. I want to carry protest signs every day. Instead, I put those sentiments on the most ladylike garment I could think of so I can wear my protest. 6 6 Lent by the artist L2019.39.25ab 2. Joanne Arnett &Archana Mehta “No Comfort,” 2019 Artists’ statement: This sweater displays a graph of mass shootings* in the U.S. since the Columbine massacre in 1999. Each year is one row and each death within that year is marked with ten stitches, creating a raised surface. School shootings are further represented by bows in that school’s colors and each bow represents a life lost. The garment consumes the wearer, spilling onto the ground, conveying the overwhelming sense of powerlessness felt in the fight to change the laws and systems that allow these events to occur. One word is continually repeated along the hem of the garment: Enough. *five or more victims. Lent by the artists L2019.39.22 7 3. Victor Barratt-McCartney “Digital Iconoclasm,” 2019 Artist’s statement: This wearable textile incorporates multiple techniques, including Adire style resist dyeing (a tradition from southwestern Nigeria) and patchwork appliqué. It functions as a commemorative wall hanging or can be worn as a wrap skirt with a drawstring waist, accommodating many sizes. Digital Iconoclasm is a celebration of dissent and my rejection of art that exploits or sensationalizes. In an era when state violence and police militarization is normalized, May 4 serves as a constant reminder of the power of people organizing together and the global impact of the American imperialist state. Lent by the artist L2019.39.2 8 4.Kennedy Brouillard & Eleonore Zurawski “Dissent is Not a Crime,” 2019 Artists’ statement: Kennedy Brouillard created this three-piece look using denim, faux leather, Supima cotton, and cotton jersey. The accompanying video by Eleonore Zurawski features clips from important protests throughout history and today. The denim side of the jacket is meant to be worn during a protest and the Supima cotton side can be worn as an everyday look. The jacket also features laser cutting done in the TechStyleLAB and the painting on the back refers to protest signs. The project pays homage to protesters who are committed to creating a better future around the world. Lent by the artists L2019.39.3ab 9 5. Margaret Busche “Parallel,” 2019 Artist’s statement: The purpose of this garment is to show the parallel between the events of May 4 fifty years ago and the current school shooting crisis throughout the United States. This garment was digitally printed at the TechStyleLAB on linen. Lent by the artist L2019.39.4 10 6. Chanjuan Chen “United in Love,” 2019 Artist’s statement: “United in Love” is inspired by the existence of the United Nations organization and the aim of its members to foster cooperation and maintain worldwide peace and security. The UN’s directive is to act as a united people; to put aside cultural and linguistic differences in recognition of larger, unifying characteristics for the betterment of the world. I constructed the top in sections with each piece the same silhouette of people holding hands to represent social equality. The color blue symbolizes this unity and peace. The skirt is in multiple colors to represent the rainbow of races and cultures around the world. Lent by the artist L2019.39.5a-d 11 7. Courtney Lin Donnelly “Rosie’s Rivets,” 2019 Artist’s statement: This piece celebrates women’s paths to empowerment, acknowledging the many barriers as women break down stereotypes. I used an old couture pleating technique to represent society’s dated views of what a woman should be and contrasted this with a silhouette inspired by a man’s welding coat. The pleats are created with a jersey knit and the coat is of stretch denim. “Rosie’s Rivets” is a visualization of women breaking boundaries and social expectations in order to gain the justice they deserve. Lent by the artist L2019.39.7a-c 12 8. Tameka N. Ellington “This is to All Who Refuse to Get Involved!: The Vortex of Black Protest Propaganda,” 2019 Artist’s statement: The muse for this work is a photograph by Emeritus Professor, Timothy Moore. The photograph is of KSU alum, Silas Ashley (’74), who was standing in front of Rockwell Hall protesting the Vietnam War. I manipulated the photo via Photoshop to create a vortex-like print. The message on Mr. Ashely’s tombstone/protest sign along with the Black Power icon was developed into a repeat pattern that was then printed on silk georgette. I used a 1970 Vogue dress pattern by Jerry Silverman, one of the founders of the Fashion School and Museum. This work commemorates social justice protests and signals a renewed identity and purpose for Blacks. Lent by the artist L2019.39.6 13 9. Trista L. Grieder “Hearts of Justice,” 2019 Artist’s statement: For generations, the roles of husband and wife have been scripted along gender stereotypes. I question the impact of such clichés on the individuals within a marriage by creating a dress that symbolizes the “fantasy” of marriage. The sweetheart neckline and silhouette evoke a stereotype of the youthful bride, which is then countered by text on the underskirt that addresses marital issues. Lent by the artist L2019.39.10 14 10. Kim Hahn & Evelyn Rossol “Weaving For Justice,” 2019 Artists’ statement: “Weaving for Justice” is a two-piece, 1970’s inspired look, designed to honor those who were killed and injured in the May 4 shooting on the Kent State University Campus. The crop top and bell bottom pants have a hand woven, triaxial surface design. The strips of fabric which make up the weave include two sets of color gradients inspired by the 70’s-- yellow to purple and teal to red. And the black and white strips contain the names of the individuals who were killed and injured that ominous day, along with a quote from the Scranton Commission calling the event “unnecessary, unwarranted, and inexcusable.” The surface of the finished garments has a three-dimensional optical illusion appearance. Lent by the artists L2019.39.20ab 15 11. Sue Hershberger Yoder & Melissa Campbell “Kindred Bloom,” 2019 Folk art is of, by, and for the people; all people, inclusive of class, status, culture, community, ethnicity, gender, and religion. -The International Folk Art Museum Artists’ statement: Digitally generated images are often the primary communication vehicles for today’s youth: in ways they parallel activists of the past whose hand work and crafts communicated their fight for justice. The impulse for creating identifiers and showing support is the same, but now the symbols are more likely to be made digitally. We are imagining a scenario in which today’s young activists create digital embroidery patterns as a visual connector to past kindred voices who shared their passion for social justice. Specifically, we see these young activists using folk art inspired, embellished clothing to communicate to us as they lead the way toward common sense gun laws. Lent by the artists L2019.39.24.1a-m, L2019.39.24.2a-h 16 12. Ja Young Hwang & Sue Hershberger Yoder “Etched Justice,” 2019 Artists’ statement: “Etched Justice” is a multi-layered dress symbolic of May 4. The bottom layer represents the youthful spirit through the bright floral colors combined with the innocence of a shift dress that does not reveal contours of the female body. The top layer of organza is printed with lines to give the fabric an etched effect. The printed lines shroud the flowers, and yet the flowers continue to shine through the veil. This represents the history of May 4 and supports today’s youth and their activism against gun violence. Lent by the artists L2019.39.23ab 17 13. Colin Isaacs “Make Amerikkka Great Again,” 2019 Artist’s statement: I designed the pattern for the pants and then created the custom print by sourcing articles and newspaper headlines from 1960s to current day that featured the complex issues of equality. The newspaper pattern was then applied to Cotton Sateen by the TechStyleLAB. Lent by the artist L2019.39.1a-e 18 14. Helen Legg “The Cycle Of Life And Death With Nothing In Between,” 2019 Artist’s statement: This ensemble is inspired by Don Drumm’s sculpture, Solar Totem #1, which was irrevocably scarred by the violence that occurred on May 4, 1970 when a bullet pierced the surface. Drumm’s sculpture after May 4 and my design address the never-ending cycle of mass shootings in the U.S. In spite of these frequent occurrences little legislation has passed to reform gun-ownership laws. The organic shapes of the outer garment represent the physical violence and inner conflicts that haunt present society and the memory surrounding the Vietnam War. The materials represent the complexity of these events: the Piñatex* symbolizes the skin covering our bodies and the knitting signifies the anger and confusion that covers us as we grapple with such horrific events. *Piñatex is leather made from Pineapple. Lent by the artist L2019.39.11 19 15. Sophie MacNeil “Doomsday,” 2019 Artist’s statement: This dress is from a collection inspired by today’s Doomsday Preppers subculture and takes inspiration from the idea of living in the postapocalyptic world. It’s made of jersey knit and nylon with nylon webbing and plastic buckles. Lent by the artist L2019.39.12ab 20 16. Michelle Park “Grains Of Truth,” 2019 Artist’s statement: Masquerading as grain sacks, these tote bags provide commentary on the agricultural industry and the unseen costs or “ingredients” of our food. Wheat, corn, and rice are staple grains, each acting as a symbol for a clandestine component of the agricultural system that is calling for justice. In the wake of the largest wave of farmer suicide in history, wheat brings attention to the worker. Many cannot bear the financial strain as they are exploited by agricultural and agrochemical companies. These corporations and the political grafting that occur are represented by corn. Finally, rice calls attention to pesticide usage and environmental exploitation that affects our bodies and our world. Lent by the artist L2019.39.8a-c 21 17. Alexandra Reich “Brotherly Love,” 2019 Artist’s statement: Brotherly Love: The love for family, community and the duty to “love thy neighbor as thyself.” Unconditional kindness that offers a hand in friendship, that loves when not loved back, that gives without getting, and that looks for what is best in others. As a Female Officer serving in the Ohio Army National Guard, I understand the balance between war and peace. As a graduate from KSU Fashion School and a current KSU Masters student, I create quilts to bring meaningful memories into home décor by recycling military uniforms and mixing colorful fabrics to balance patriotism and peace. Lent by the artist L2019.39.13 22 18. Kristin Reynolds “Divided,” 2019 Artist’s statement: This dress focuses on the divide that took place on May 4, 1970: a division between good and bad, peace and war, order and chaos, and even life and death. The garment consists of a structured asymmetrical collared top that is contrasted with a gathered, ruffled skirt. The top represents the National Guard on May 4 and references the structured elements of a military uniform. The ruffled skirt, on the other hand, represents the free-spirited students on this day. While the garment is considered to be a dress, it is split into two pieces. The space between the top and bottom of the garment is held together with rope and symbolizes the divide between the two sides that day. Even though they are separate parts, they are connected as one. Lent by the artist L2019.39.14 23 23 19. Tatum Reusser “Scarlet is She,” 2019, three from a series of six Artist’s statement: The theme of this collection is inspired by the battle of Coon Creek during the American Indian War. I use this history to address perceptions about women then and now, pushing against stereotypes. The fabric manipulations of gathering and layering symbolize the complexity and struggles of the battle. The exaggerated silhouettes, volumes of fabric and stitching create seductive, delicate, and edgy details. I am portraying the woman in scarlet who brought hope to the hopeless, showed strength during a dark time, and compassion to the wounded. Scarlet is She. Lent by the artist L2019.39.19-3ab, L2019.39.19-1ab, L2019.39.19-2 24 25 20. Ashleigh Robek “Don’t Hurt Us ,” 2019 Artist’s statement: “Don’t Hurt Us” consists of three different outfits inspired by the 1970s. These three dresses represent the everyday American who was affected by the horrific shooting that happened on May 4. The first dress is made of white denim with an invisible zipper and darts. The second outfit is a button-down shirt and an A-line skirt both made of linen. The third dress is made with a white knit jersey. Projected onto the garments is video footage from The Kent State shootings that took place on May 4. Lent by the artist L2019.39.15-1_.15-4 26 21. Megan Rodgers “Veil of the Draft,” 2019 Artist’s statement: I designed a sheer army jacket to represent the veil of war and the uncertainty of the draft that surrounded the male students of Kent State. I was inspired by an image I found in the May 4 Visitors Center of Kent State. It is a photograph of fraternity brothers holding up their draft numbers. You see the faces of young men who were at the mercy of the draft lottery during what would otherwise be an exciting time of their college life. On the jacket, I embroidered the birth-dates of the four students who were killed on May 4 and an anti-war black armband. Lent by the artist L2019.39.9 27 22. Rekha Sharma & Gargi Bhaduri “The Khadi Revolution: Spinning, Weaving, And Wearing Homespun Cotton To Promote Social Justice,” 2019 Artists’ statement: Khadi (homespun cotton cloth) was integral to India’s quest for independence from British rule. The material and associated practices symbolically communicated tenets of Gandhi’s nonviolent push for social justice. This exhibit features a khadi sari (a draped garment traditionally worn by women on the Indian subcontinent) printed with significant words from the independence movement. These words— satyagraha (adherence to truth), swaraj (self-rule), swadeshi (selfsufficiency), and ahimsa (non-violence)—as well as the motif of the charkha (spinning wheel) unified the diverse population in a collective struggle for equality and freedom. Even today, as India negotiates its governance and position on the global stage, khadi has provided avenues for articulating a national identity and creating sustainable employment in rural communities. Lent by the artists L2019.39.21ab 28 23. Jaihe Tong “Stop The War and Remember The History,” 2019 Artist’s statement: This tapestry is inspired by the horrors of the Vietnam War and how it also created other battles, such as Kent State’s May 4 tragedy. The depicted figures don’t have faces because they could easily be anyone. However, the faceless figures also show that regardless of what side you are on, death is death. The ring on the soldier’s hand and the envelope laying in the bloodied earth, remind the viewer that when there is a loss, someone is suffering. Lent by the artist L2019.39.16 29 24. Rachel Williams “Protection,” 2019 Artist’s statement: My design pays homage to the students who lost their lives on May 15, 1970 at Jackson State University in Mississippi. The students’ names are Phillip Gibbs & James Earl Green. Another 12 people were injured. This shooting came 11 days following Kent State, but is not as well known, which could be due to the fact that these men were Black. The outfit is a layering of different materials to underscore contrasts; organic gray twill for the pants; black, crocheted lace turtleneck sweater and a jacket of both canvas and silk. I printed the victims’ faces on silk organza to honor their memory. They may be physically gone but remain visible. Lent by the artist L2019.39.17a-c 30 25. Eleonore Zurawski & Maame Amoah “All We Are-Injustice Of Deprivation,” 2019 Artists’ statement: Depriving people of water, food and shelter is an injustice against human kind. The jumpsuit and knit structure are inspired by the basic human necessities for life and growth through water, food, and shelter. The jumpsuit fabric design, created by Eleonore Zurawski, was made from collaged photographs of food and water, then printed in the TechStyleLAB. The knit sculpture, created by Maame Amoah, represents shelter and was designed and knit on the Stoll knitting machine.

What we remember feeling and seeing, even where we were standing or sitting, when we learned the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded or saw the Twin Towers on fire is reinforced and magnified by news reports, our circles of friends, and the cacophony of divergent responses. All these inputs become one memory: deeply personal, cultural, communal. The Kent State shootings of May 4, 1970, continue to hold just such personal and collective power. Depending on one’s age, political views, and perceptions of the aftermath, its complex meanings vary. Our memories evolve with time, and so does our understanding of what it all means and how we might apply its lessons to our actions today. The Kent State University Museum is deeply honored to participate in the 50th Commemoration of May 4 and to be part of the campus-wide, yearlong schedule of activities organized to generate meaningful conversation and reflection. The museum’s major contribution is this exhibition, Culture/CounterCulture: Fashions of the 1960s and ’70s, conceived and curated by Museum Curator Sara Hume. Drawing primarily from the museum’s outstanding collection, she explores the cultural canyon between youth culture and the Establishment in the 1960s and ’70s. The divides were easily read through what we wore: activists used their appearance as billboards for their beliefs, just as parents donned conventional dresses and suits inspired by couture. While what we wear has always tracked social, historic, technological trends; in the 1960s increasing power was given to the meaning of how we dressed. By the mid-1970s, the establishment (including Parisian 4 couture houses) had co-opted hippie wear and miniskirts not as the language of activism, but out of a desire to be youthful, relevant, and, yes, “hip.” This commemoration and its spirit of reflection and inclusion has been led by the remarkable visions of KSU’s immediate past president, Beverly Warren and former provost, now president, Todd Diacon. They inspired all of us to be creative and bring forth truly meaningful projects. Dean John Crawford-Spinelli, who has enthusiastically supported the exhibition from the beginning, was instrumental in the generous grant the Museum received from the provost’s fund to help fund this publication. We appreciate the support of Rod Flauhaus, the 50th Commemoration project manager, who also understood the relevance of the exhibition. While most of the exhibited objects are from the museum’s collection, we are also grateful to our lenders: the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame; The Ohio History Connection, and Kent State University Libraries, Special Collections and Archives. We also thank the individuals who graciously agreed to lend their personal vintage items: Sheryl Birkner, Peter Gent, Daniel Mainzer, Diane Rarick, Cindy Sheehan, and Fred Smith. Sara Hume is to be congratulated for her insight and care in eschewing the stereotypical views of this period and teasing out the complex, nuanced differences and similarities. We appreciate the contributions of Phaedra Scherl and Carolanne Tkach, both student assistants who worked closely with Sara on the many details of the exhibition. Every Wednesday morning for the past year, our dedicated sewing volunteers—Susan Griffin, Leesa Hileman, Marilyn Lown and Millie Chrin—gathered to repair and prepare garments for the exhibition. Thanks also go to the KSU Museum staff: Joanne Fenn, collections manager; Jim Williams, exhibition designer, for his creative installation design; Todd Clark, security manager; Bianka Sinkfield, administrative assistant; Ruth Krause, store manager; Docents Jean Giulitto, Laurie Howell and Susan Laubach, as well as our colleagues Effie Tsengas, communications and marketing director, and Brittani Peterson, marketing associate. Special thanks to the designer of the catalogue, Cecilia Sveda of Minx Design, and editor Erin Holman. Finally, please join us in remembering students Allison Krause, Jeffrey Miller, Sandra Scheuer, and William Schroeder and honoring all Kent State University students, alumni, faculty, staff, and administration, as well as the citizens of the city of Kent. We will not forget May 4, 1970. Sarah J.

Copyright: Kent State University ars ago, e y 0 5 t s Almo the shootings of Kent State University students by the Ohio National Guard brought to a head the cultural divides that had split the nation. Much of the tension centered around the generation gap between the baby boomers who were filling college campuses and their parents who had served in World War II. The divisions went beyond the generational, however. There was a contrast between supporters of the Establishment and those who opposed it—the culture and the counterculture. These cleavages in society saw their expression in the fashions of the time. Clothing served as a powerful signifier of people’s identity and indicated their sense of group belonging as well as personal values. Students move away from the commons as the Guard fire tear gas, May 4, 1970. Copyright: Kent State University 10 It is difficult to define clearly who was part of the Establishment as opposed to the counterculture. Mainstream culture in the 1960s and ‘70s cannot be divorced from the contributions of groups that could be seen as marginalized or disadvantaged. African Americans, those of Jewish descent, and others who today we would identify as LGBTQ all played critical roles in the world of fashion. Although these groups are associated with the political activism of the period, they were not necessarily part of the counterculture. Members of these groups did, however, gain prominence in radio, television, film, theater, even politics and the society pages. Television in particular was central to the development of mainstream culture in the 1960s; by 1960 nearly 90 percent of American homes had a television set. Not only was the TV nearly ubiquitous, but other forms of media became less popular—film attendance declined as did the number of hours people listened to the radio.1 In the popular imagination, one of the icons of 1960s mainstream fashion is First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy. The epitome of privilege, she was born into affluence and grew up in polite society. Known for her education in literature and the arts, Kennedy also maintained a love of fashion, particularly French couture. Her advantages extended beyond the material, as she was endowed with natural grace and beauty. During her years in the White House, she worked closely with designer Oleg Cassini to craft her signature look. She favored tailored suits with knee-length skirts and three-quarter-length sleeves in solid colors. She also wore straight, sleeveless, A-line dresses. With their simple lines and solid colors, her clothes were both flattering and photogenic. As her husband was likewise attractive, television naturally complemented the couple. The president and First Lady both used the medium to their advantage. While John F. Kennedy memorably excelled in a televised debate during his campaign, Jacqueline Kennedy took to the television for a tour of the White House that was broadcast on CBS (fig. 1). Figure 1.

Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, Boston. 11 The Kennedys, among the youngest families to have resided in the White House, reflected the fresh optimism of the early 1960s. While they were young, they were of an earlier generation than the baby boomers—now known as the Greatest Generation. President Kennedy had served with distinction in World War II, and he inspired members of the next generation, who heeded his call to ask what they could do for their country. The infatuation with the presidency and politics fostered during the Camelot years, however, did not long survive after the president’s assassination. Vietnam, first, then Watergate shattered such optimism. In the years following her first husband’s death, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis kept largely out of the public spotlight. However, she did continue to dress with her characteristic grace and elegance. For instance, in 1967, on a visit to Cambodia, she wore a dress identical to the evening dress of mint-green silk edged with dense beading by Valentino that is in the Kent State University Museum collection. This gown represents both the simple lines and the exceptional quality of the clothes favored by the former First Lady (fig. 2). 12 Figure 2.

In the 1960s, the haute couture industry continued to exert strong influence over how a large segment of the population dressed. Despite the growing prominence of youth culture, important and successful designers such as Chanel and Balenciaga created innovative designs for an older clientele. Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel (1883–1971) had begun her career as a milliner before expanding to sportswear in the early 1910s and then finally opening a full couture shop in Paris right at the end of World War I.2 While her early career had been marked by her innovative use of jersey in casual sportswear, Chanel’s mature designs were noted for their tweed (fig. 3). In the years following the reopening of her house after World War II, her name gradually regained its status as a sought-after luxury brand. The quilted linings and metal chains weighting down the jackets’ hems ensured the neat appearance of the bulky fabrics. Cristóbal Balenciaga (1895–1972) was also renowned for his ability to control fabric in his distinctive designs. His house rose to prominence in the years following World War II. In contrast to the contemporary designs of Christian Dior (1905–1957), which emphasized and exaggerated the natural form of the woman’s body, Balenciaga defied a woman’s shape as he created new silhouettes. In the 1960s, he continued to maintain an appeal to older women, to whom his forgiving designs were flattering. Figure 3.

Grey and white tweed dress by Shannon Rodgers for Jerry Silverman, ca. 1965, Silverman/ Rodgers Collection, KSUM 1983.1.663. 14 While Paris remained a center for high-end, custom-made clothing, designers in America also served an Establishment clientele. One American label that tapped into a significant market of women with its wearable, simple yet sophisticated clothing was Jerry Silverman, Inc. The label was launched in 1959 by Jerry Silverman (1910–1984) and his designer and partner Shannon Rodgers (1911– 1996), the founding benefactors of the Kent State University Museum, which now maintains an important collection of their designs. Silverman described his clothing as the “meat and potatoes of the dress industry, not the frosting,” and his pieces were offered for sale across the country in boutiques and department stores.3 The label was notable for its quality ready-towear clothing in interesting fabrics and colors. The tweed dress included in the exhibit showcases both its simplicity of line and its attention to material and texture (fig. 4). First Ladies Patricia Nixon, Lady Bird Johnson and Rosalyn Carter all wore Jerry Silverman dresses. Early in his career, Rodgers worked as a costume designer in Hollywood and cultivated connections with celebrities. He designed dresses for a number of celebrities, including Dinah Shore and Miss Americas Bess Myerson and Phyllis George. The connections Silverman and Rodgers maintained with notable figures ensured that an important collection of clothing with celebrity associations became part of the KSU Museum collection. For example, Dinah Shore (1916–1994) wore pieces designed by Rodgers, but she was also a generous donor to the museum, and its permanent collection includes a number of additional pieces from her wardrobe, among them this blue wool evening dress by Norman Norell (1900–1972) (fig. 5). Norell, like Shannon Rodgers, began his career working in theater and film as a costumer, but in the late 1920s he transitioned into working on Seventh Avenue for Hattie Carnegie (1886–1956). After twelve years with Carnegie, where he reimagined couture designs adapted from Paris into ready-to-wear garments for the American market, he moved to work with the manufacturing firm Anthony Traina. Following Traina’s retirement in 1960, Norell launched his own label. The Figure 5. Blue wool evening dress with embroidered border by Norman Norell that belonged to Dinah Shore, ca. 1965, Silverman/Rodgers Collection, KSUM 1983.1.480 a-c. 15 name “Norell” remained synonymous with craftsmanship and fine workmanship even though the clothes were not couture. Dinah Shore’s blue wool dress exemplifies the high quality and understated elegance of Norell’s work. Dinah Shore first gained fame as a popular singer and radio star during the 1940s. Her career followed the rise of television as she became the host of her own show in the 1950s. By the 1960s, she was an established celebrity known for her wholesomeness and warmth. She continued to host her own talk shows through the 1970s. Kitty Carlisle Hart (1910–2007) was another celebrity and socialite of the 1960s whose wardrobe is included in the KSU Museum collection. Like Shore, Carlisle was Jewish and became well known as a television personality familiar to Americans in the 1960s and ’70s, having made a name for herself as a film actress and opera singer starting in the 1930s. From 1956 to 1978 she was a regular panelist on the television game show To Tell the Truth. Her elegance and stylish dress on the show made her a household name. During the 1980s, 16 Figure 6. Black velvet and pink satin evening dress by Donald Brooks that belonged to Kitty Carlisle Hart, ca. 1968, Silverman/Rodgers Collection, KSUM 1983.1.1282. Carlisle donated some of her gowns to the KSU Museum. Carlisle is represented in this exhibition by a pink satin and black velvet gown by Donald Brooks (1928– 2005) (fig. 6). Brooks, also like Shannon Rodgers, enjoyed a career as both costume and fashion designer. While heading his own label from 1965 to 1973, he also designed costumes for Broadway plays, television, and film. Despite his theatrical experience, his fashions were designed to let the wearer shine so they did not overwhelm her. In his obituary in Women’s Wear Daily, the buyer Jeane Eddy was quoted as describing his designs: “Donald’s feeling about clothes is that the woman should be most prominent. He was what I called the middle of my yardstick. There was someone at the bottom with dumb dresses and there was Rudi Gernreich at the top with his over-thetop designs that were very avant garde. Donald was always in the middle. He was a designer for all seasons.”4 Bess Myerson (1924–2014) first found national fame when she was elected Miss America in 1945. She was the first (and so far, only) Jewish woman to receive that title, which she won in the weeks immediately after World War II—right on the heels of Americans’ triumph over the anti-Semitic forces of Nazism—suggesting an acceptance of Jews into the mainstream of American culture. Following her reign, Myerson served as a spokesperson and made television appearances on game shows before transitioning to a career in politics. She is represented in this exhibition by a Shannon Rodgers dress of sheer white chiffon trimmed at the cuffs with white fox fur (fig. 7). The elegant dress plays with a tension between modesty and sexiness. It includes a plunging neckline and an open back, yet the skin is discreetly concealed with a layer of sheer chiffon. Figure 7. White silk chiffon evening dress trimmed with fur by Shannon Rodgers that belonged to Bess Myerson, 1960s, Silverman/Rodgers Collection, KSUM 1983.1.640. 17 The selection of fashion designers and celebrities included in this exhibition attests to the prevalence of Jews in popular culture. The fashion industry in New York has employed a significant number of Jews as well as members of other immigrant communities. Eastern European immigrants, who fled the nineteenth-century pogroms in their native lands, put their tailoring and dressmaking skills to work in the city’s growing fashion industry.5 While they certainly faced anti-Semitism in the United States through the early twentieth century, by World War II Jews were increasingly integrated into society. Although they were now solidly members of the Establishment, many chose new names to disguise their Jewishness: Norman Levinson became Norman Norell, Hattie Kanengeiser became Hattie Carnegie, Fannye Shore became Dinah Shore, Donald Blumberg became Donald Brooks, and Catherine Conn became Kitty Carlisle. Bess Myerson resisted pressure from Miss America organizers to use the more anglicized “Beth Merrick.”6 The discretion with which they maintained their Jewishness granted these entertainers and designers full access 18 Figure 8. Black net evening dress with silver sequins by Norman Norell for Bonwit Teller worn by Diahann Carroll, 1960s, Gift of Mrs. Amy Greene-Andrews, KSUM 2002.44.1a. to the advantages that privilege afforded. Jews also made a significant contribution to the civil rights movement during the 1950s and 1960s. Driven by their own status on the margins of society, Jews made up at least 30 percent of the white Freedom Riders registering blacks to vote and picketing segregated establishments.7 In the 1960s African Americans continued to face discrimination and even segregation. However, during this time some African Americans achieved the highest levels of celebrity. The career of Diahann Carroll (1935– ) reflected the emergence in the 1950s of mainstream films that featured black casts, including Carmen Jones and Porgy and Bess. In 1962 Carroll became the first African American woman to win a Tony Award for her role in No Strings. Through the 1960s she appeared on a string of television variety shows before landing the title role in the 1968 series Julia, which made her the first African American actress to star in her own television series in a role other than as a domestic worker. While she broke barriers by her very presence on television, the content of the program was not provocative. Because the show was created at a time when racial tensions in the nation were coming to a head following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., its producers and writers struggled to avoid racist stereotypes. They faced the challenge of representing black culture for white America. In general, they presented a comfortable, middle-class woman who reflected few if any aspects of black culture besides her skin color. Carroll said in a 1968 TV Guide interview: “At the moment we’re presenting the white Negro. And he has very little Negroness.”8 Carroll is represented in this exhibition by a dress of black tulle adorned with silver sequins that Norman Norell designed for her in the 1960s (fig. 8). This dress is stunning but squarely conventional in its design and appeal. Like her television character, it was appealing in part by being nonthreatening, by conforming to mainstream aesthetics. One of the most celebrated African American stars to emerge in the 1960s was Diana Ross (1944– ). She was one of the most successful stars of Motown Records. Under the direction of Berry Gordy Jr. the public image including the dress of Motown stars was carefully controlled. Ross’s group, the Supremes, was the first major success under the Motown label, and it established a polished, sophisticated look for African American performers. Other than Diahann Carroll and Lena Horne, African American women had few examples of glamorous celebrities as inspirations.9 Motown was an important player in the progress African Americans made in shaping popular culture. As a black-owned business, it provided an opportunity for black stars and executives to profit. The story of American popular music through the 1950s was dominated by white stars such as Elvis Presley and Buddy Holly, who reinterpreted the blues and other musical styles developed in the African American community. By the 1960s, groups such as the Supremes and the Miracles gained a mainstream audience in both the United States and Europe. British pop groups who would come to dominate the airwaves through the 1960s were also heavily influenced by the blues and R&B, including the music produced by Motown. During the 1960s, television played a large role in 19 popularizing musical groups. Programs like American Bandstand and The Ed Sullivan Show brought entertainers into American living rooms and contributed to a culture of celebrity. Similar shows in Great Britain, including Ready, Set, Go and Top of the Pops, popularized American music across the pond. In 1970, Diana Ross left the Supremes to launch her own solo career, and in 1971, she had her own television special, Diana! in which she wore the taupe sequined dress included in this exhibition. The dress is a testament to Ross’s attention to cultivating her glamorous persona. In the early years of her career, she had made her own dresses, but by the 1970s she had designers such as Bob Mackie help her establish her look. As much as Diana Ross was the essence of glamor and sophistication, Jimi Hendrix (1942–1970) epitomized wild experimentation. In contrast to the generally conservative style of many of the African American stars through the 1960s, Hendrix was extravagant and deliberately thumbed his nose at the constraints of polite society. He began his career, wearing suits and standing in the background, in backup 20 bands for rhythm & blues acts including Little Richard, Wilson Pickett, Sam Cooke, and Ike and Tina Turner. After signing with British manager Chas Chandler in 1966, Hendrix moved to London, where his career took off. He developed a highly individual style, in part from his exposure to London’s fashion scene, that favored bright colors, a combination of bold patterns, and luxurious textures. His flashy stage presence was a combination of statement clothing choices and such antics as burning his guitar. Despite his roots in the US blues and soul music scene, Hendrix’s mature music was part of the predominately white psychedelic rock scene of the late 1960s. The fashion he gravitated to, including the purple velvet jacket displayed in the exhibition also pushed established gender boundaries. The luxurious material and its bold color were and still are largely viewed as feminine. Hendrix was a pivotal figure in the development of countercultural style for his provocative exploration of the boundaries of race, gender, and personal style. Hendrix’s bold personal style was groundbreaking in the 1960s. But by the 1970s, many of the dramatic style choices that had been on the fringe in the 1960s became increasingly mainstream. The dresses included in the exhibition that were worn by Lena Horne (1917–2010) demonstrate the increasing acceptance of bohemian style. A generation older than Diahann Carroll, Horne had a career that spanned more than seventy years and truly reflects the increasing opportunity for African American women. She acted in Hollywood films during the 1940s, but her parts were restricted to minor roles because scenes she was in would have to be cut for cities that did not allow scenes with black performers to be shown. Through the 1960s, Horne performed primarily as a singer in nightclubs while also making many appearances on TV variety shows, including The Ed Sullivan Show and The Judy Garland Show. In the 1970s, she became familiar to Figure 9. Red jersey dress with long trumpet sleeves by Giorgio di Sant’ Angelo worn by Lena Horne, 1970s, Gift of Lena Horne, KSUM 1992.14.16. a new generation of viewers through appearances on Sesame Street and The Muppet Show. Like Diahann Carroll and Diana Ross, Horne cultivated an elegant and sophisticated style. By the 1970s, she had adapted her classical look to the increasingly bohemian contemporary fashions (fig. 9). Giorgio di Sant’ Angelo (1933-1989), a designer who rose to prominence in the late 1960s, designed many of her clothes. Sant’ Angelo made his name with designs that took inspiration from Native American and gypsy styles and included leather, fringe, feathers and beads. He moved on to make extensive use of stretchy, drapey materials such as the synthetic jersey shown in Lena Horne’s dresses included in this exhibition. Along with Jews and African Americans, gays were central to the development of fashion in the 1960s and ’70s. Although homosexuality remained largely unacknowledged, a significant number of prominent fashion designers were gay. While gay rights became a subject of political struggle in the late 1960s and the 1970s, particularly following 1969’s Stonewall riots, the public was not necessarily aware of the sexuality of celebrated fashion designers. In the catalogue accompanying her groundbreaking exhibition A Queer History of Fashion, Valerie Steele addresses the question of whether it is even appropriate to discuss the sexual identity of designers. She concludes that “it is entirely legitimate to discuss the sexuality of the deceased, since there is nothing shameful about variant sexuality.” Furthermore, “it is, in fact, entirely legitimate to ask why homosexuals have played such an important role in fashion.”10 Many of the designers discussed in this essay who were closely linked to designing for the Establishment of the 1960s were gay. Steele identifies two of the great icons of postwar Paris fashion, Balenciaga and Dior as having been gay. Both were discreet in their personal lives, but each shared his life with a male partner. Norman Norell was another designer of the same generation who was likewise discrete in his sexual identity. While known among his circle as gay, he would never admit it.11 Jerry Silverman and Shannon Rodgers were partners in their personal as well as 21 professional lives. They owned and lived in adjacent penthouse apartments on Park Avenue in New York City and shared a country house upstate. Like many of these other designers, their relationship was certainly known among their friends but not by the public. Rodgers, the creative force in the partnership while Silverman was the businessman, loved dramatic displays and decorating but created a firmly mainstream aesthetic for the brand. However, many members of the younger generation who came to direct fashion in the 1960s and ’70s were more open. Yves Saint Laurent (1936–2008) took over Dior’s house after the master’s death in 1957. He would assert to a French film maker in 2002, “My sexuality has been very important to my creativity.”12 He was particularly interested in the lines between men’s and women’s fashion. Taking inspiration from Marlene Dietrich’s wearing of men’s formal wear, Saint Laurent famously reinterpreted the man’s tuxedo as a woman’s tailored suit. This exhibition includes a suit with a safari jacket, a design Saint Laurent first presented in 1967 (fig. 10). The look 22 approximated the styles worn both by the Afrika Korps (the German troops stationed in Africa during World War II) and white colonists’ dress more generally. Saint Laurent, born and raised in Algeria by French parents, frequently took inspiration from points of contact between Europe and other cultures. As a young designer in the 1960s, he looked to the styles among the youth for inspiration, and many of his designs reflected innovation that pushed against Establishment constraints. While his couture designs were definitely part of mainstream fashion, he introduced a boutique—his Rive Gauche line—that offered fashions at a lower price point, allowing his work to reach a larger, albeit still select, audience. Another designer who explored the boundaries of gender constructs was Rudi Gernreich (1922–1985). Born in Austria, Figure 10. Safari-inspired suit by Yves Saint Laurent, 1968, Silverman/Rodgers Collection, KSUM 1983.1.2111 ab.1992.14.16. Gernreich was Jewish and fled to the United States with his mother in 1938, when Germany annexed the country. As early as the 1950s, he became active in the burgeoning gay rights movement through his work with the Mattachine Society, one of the earliest LGBTQ rights organizations in the United States. Motivated by his dissatisfaction with society’s attitudes toward sexuality and the body, Gernreich imagined a future where gender played a negligible role in informing how people dressed. In a January 1970 issue of Life magazine, Gernreich predicted that in the 1970s clothing wouldn’t be identified as either male or female: “Women will wear pants and men will wear skirts interchangeably.”13 While he consistently showed outfits for women with pants starting in the mid1960s, he took his idea for unisex to the Figure 11. Patchwork caftan with mirrorwork and multicolored embroidery, ca. 1975, Gift of Coral Browne Price, KSUM 1985.27.1. extreme in the 1970s when he showed identical outfits for men and women, including caftans. This exhibition includes a caftan that bears the Rudi Gernreich label, although it appears to have been made in India with traditional techniques such as patchwork and mirror-work. Gernreich was photographed wearing a similar caftan (fig. 11). While Gernreich’s designs were more revolutionary than mainstream fashion, regular Americans’ wardrobes did change in a number of ways that echoed his ideas. Women increasingly wore pants, including pantsuits for work. Men wore their hair long and embraced a more colorful palette. In his contribution to this catalogue, Daniel Hill explores what is often referred to as the Peacock Revolution in menswear. The easing of distinction between masculine and feminine dress was accompanied by an increase in casual styles. College campuses largely became incubators for these clothes—particularly jeans. Both young men and women wore jeans and T-shirts on campus for an expanding array of social occasions. While many college campuses in the 23 1960s still insisted young men wear jackets and ties for dinner, this formality disappeared by the 1970s. At the same time, young women abandoned accessories such as hats and gloves. College campuses were also the site of growing political activism during the 1960s. The civil rights movement, which took off in the 1950s, laid the groundwork for a culture of protest. By the 1960s groups such as the Black Panthers and the Black United Students had gained an important foothold on campuses. Specific clothing items became closely associated with particular groups; the black beret, for instance, came to symbolize the Black Panthers. The Black United Students held a number of rallies at the Kent State campus and participated in broader campus protests. The image to the right (fig. 12) shows members participating in the Moratorium to end the War in Vietnam, which took place across the United States in October 1969. The organization’s president, Erwind Blount, stands in the center with a microphone. He is flanked by two young men who each wear dark berets. This photograph brings together 24 symbolism that developed out of the fight for rights and respect for African Americans as well as the protest against the war in Vietnam. College students were central to the resistance because they were the generation being sent to fight and die in the conflict. Enrolling in higher education was one means of receiving a Figure 12.

Although images of student protests (fig. 13) from the 1960s reveal that students’ dress was generally relatively conservative, their elders often characterized these young protestors as rebellious, even iconoclastic. Tensions emerged not simply between the youth and their parents but between youth and the government. At its extreme, the protests were expressed as a disrespect for the young men who served. At the same time, many protest signs (fig. 14) clearly express support for GIs. On the whole, the objection to the war was a call to protect and save the lives of young men who had to fight. However, a soldier’s uniform did not confer on the wearer the respect and gratitude that is now shown to active duty soldiers and veterans. This exhibition includes both the uniform worn by Dennis Fullerton when he served in Vietnam in 1968 and a black cotton jacket he wore after he returned to the United States. The jacket bears the embroidered message “When I die I’ll go to heaven because I’ve spent my time in Hell/Chu-Lai.” Shirts and jackets with this 25 message became a form of expression for returning Vietnam veterans to both identify themselves and express the horror their service entailed. The tensions between young people and the Establishment came to a head at Kent State. When President Richard M. Nixon announced on April 30, 1970, that he was expanding military activities into Cambodia, protests erupted across the United States. Demonstrations in Kent became unruly. In hopes of maintaining order, the town’s mayor, Leroy Satrom, called the governor of Ohio, James Rhodes, to request that the Ohio National Guard be sent in. Across the Kent campus and through the town, the young men of the National Guard, many of whom were no older than the students, sought to maintain order. Student protest leaders called for a rally on the Commons at noon on Monday, May 4, and despite university officials’ efforts to prevent such Protestor speaking to the crowd during the 1972 commemoration. Copyright: Kent State University an assembly, students began gathering in the late morning. Tensions came to a head as efforts to disband the students peacefully failed, and some students yelled and threw rocks. Ultimately some of the Guardsmen fired their rifles into the crowd, killing four and injuring nine more. People across the country were shocked by the violence, which pitted the state against young protestors. Following the events at Kent State, the tensions between culture and counterculture persisted. However, the high fashion of the succeeding years reflected increasing influence of counterculture and street style. Rudi Gernreich made explicit references to the events of May 4 in a collection he presented in October 1970. In this show, known as his back to school collection, the military-influenced styles went down the runway on models holding real guns (fig. 15). One of the models who took part in the show, Leon Bing, reflected later: “It was a fearful failure and pretty much put a shadow over his career because people couldn’t get over it.”14 While designers such as Gernreich saw fashion as a vehicle to make commentary on political events, the Figure 15. Tan knit sweater and shorts by Rudi Gernreich, 1970, Gift of Marion C. Risman, The Rudi Gernreich Collection, KSUM 1993.74.6 ab. events at Kent State were so raw, so recent, and so traumatic that people were not ready accept their interpretation in design. Gernreich’s efforts to employ fashion as social commentary reflected a change in the role of fashion designers. His runway shows became a form of performance as much as a commercial activity intended purely to sell designs. This shift in the agenda of fashion shows occurred at the same time as designers were losing their place as deciders of fashion. In the world’s fashion centers emerged small boutiques that presented inexpensive, innovative clothes for trendy young people; Biba in London and Paraphernalia in New York were two of the most notable of these. Trends like the miniskirt reflect the power of these youthful consumers. While many writers have tried to assign credit for the invention of the miniskirt to such designers as Mary Quant, the style was less the result of individual inspiration as a gradual result of rising hemlines.15 Fashion was shifting from a top-down system shaped by Parisian haute couture to a bottom-up one fed by a variety of emerging style influencers. Major designers such as André 27 Courrèges, Pierre Cardin, and Yves Saint Laurent did recognize the importance of the youth market as they interpreted innovative styles in their high-end designs. Colleen Hill’s essay in this catalogue traces the growing influence of ready-to-wear on fashion, particularly in France. One of the new trends in fashion that cut across every price point was the adoption of an array of experimental materials. As the world entered the space age, futuristic aesthetics influenced fashion design, particularly in the form of new synthetic materials. Many different plastics were introduced to the world by the 1950s, and in the 1960s these were liberally used as sequins and other attachments on evening dresses, as shown on this pink and white dress by Givenchy (fig. 16). They also made their way onto accessories such as handbags and sunglasses. The Courrèges sunglasses based on Inuit eyewear designed to protect against glare off of snow and ice epitomize this modern aesthetic while demonstrating a broadening range of design influences. The emergence of inexpensive fashions meant that many outfits could be worn only 28 Figure 16. Evening dress with pink and white plastic strips and beads by Givenchy, ca. 1965, Silverman/ Rodgers Collection, KSUM 1983.1.505 ab. a few times before being discarded. This ephemeral nature of fashion was pushed to an extreme in the brief paper dress trend. Starting in 1966, companies such as Waste Basket Boutique produced dresses out of a specially produced flame-resistant paper, similar to the material used today for gowns worn in doctor’s offices. These dresses were generally cut in simple A-line shapes, exaggerating the simple silhouette fashionable at the time. While paper dresses were just a fad, new synthetic materials became a significant segment of the clothing by the 1970s. For example, because polyester was wrinkle-resistant, machine washable, and inexpensive, it found widespread popularity. The move away from copying elite styles reached its logical extension with hand-crafted, DIY designs. The rejection of mainstream consumerism and materialism reached its most extreme with hippies. Participation in the counterculture was widely associated with such clothing items as jeans that have been patched or recrafted into skirts and tie-dyed T-shirts. These forms of upcycling and reuse reflected a burgeoning concern for the environment as much as an aesthetic decision. Many of the pieces included in the exhibition were much loved items that are still in the collections of their original owners and have been lent for this exhibition. Sheryl Birkner, a freshman at Kent State in the spring of 1970, witnessed the May 4 shootings. The clothing she wore shaped the memories she has of her years in college. She still has (and wears) a dress that she bought in 1970 which is made out of four Indian wool scarves. (fig. 17). Cindy Sheehan has lent an outfit of denim culottes and matching vest, which she acquired on vacation in Southern California. As she describes it: “I visited family in SoCal each summer and enjoyed having access to new fashions before they hit the Midwest. I remember wearing this outfit in high school.” She also purchased the puka-shell and shark-tooth necklaces in Southern California as well, as they reflect a beach vibe. Diane Rarick still owns several garments that her mother, Arletta Brown made for her in the early 1970s. The wool tunic with its woven design and the poncho both draw from elements of South and Central American design. The embroidered work shirt personalizes a utilitarian garment with fanciful floral designs. For all of these women, clothing remains a link to the past. The items have strong personal attachments with the people who made them and the occasions when they were worn. While the popularity of handcrafted styles obviously rose up organically, without the direction of fashion designers, a number of designers and artists co-opted Figure 17. Dress made of wool scarves, 1970, on loan from Sheryl Birkner, L2019.42.1. 29 the trend. By the 1970s, Roy Halston Frowick (1932–1990), better known as Halston, was an influential designer. Though most famous for designs featuring clean, minimalist lines, by 1970 Halston had introduced a number of tie-dyed designs into his collection. He worked with Will and Eileen Richardson, whose firm, Up Tied, become known in New York as the best at tie-dyeing.16 The tie-dyed ensemble included in this exhibition may well have been part of this collaboration (fig. 18). Tie-dye, widely used to color T-shirts and other garments during the 1960s and ’70s, is a form of resist dyeing that has a long tradition in many cultures. Halston’s tie-dye ensemble combines the skillful execution of this highly esteemed artistic tradition with the brightly colored vocabulary of the popular style. Like tie-dye, patched and refashioned denim was a popular staple of many young people’s wardrobes in the early 1970s. Denim had once been a signifier of the working class, but beginning in the 1950s blue jeans became a symbol of youthful rebellion among high schoolers. Through the 1960s, denim 30 Figure 18. Tie-dyed ensemble with matching scarves by Halston, 1970s, Gift of Marti Stevens, KSUM 1988.11.32 a-d. became increasingly ubiquitous, leading style leaders to develop new variations on the basic jeans. Used, worn denim became sought after, as did all manner of manipulations to the basic jeans. The pieces donated to the KSU Museum by Susan Allen-Umerley are representative of this fashion (fig. 19-20). Allen-Umerley was an undergraduate at Kent State in the 1970s, and as her jeans wore out she reinforced them with patches and scraps of fabric—including some leather she purchased in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood of San Francisco. She also converted a pair of denim jeans into a skirt (fig. 20). In 1973, the New York Times alerted readers to the popularity of aged denim in an article titled “If Jeans Seem on Their Last Legs, It’s Only the Beginning—As Skirts,” Just as in the case of tie-dye, a tension developed between the aesthetics Figure 19 Detail of patched denim jeans, 1970-74, Gift of Typical Student Fashions of 1970-1974, KSUM 2018.9.1. 31 of DIY and high-priced, boutique designs. According to the Times, a new Levi’s denim skirt cost about $8 in 1973. Bloomingdale’s sold skirts of recycled denim for $20, while the New York City boutique Serendipity 3 sold custom-made skirts with appliqués and embroidery for $300.17 Serendipity 3 was and still is a restaurant that also sells an array of funky and one-of-a-kind goods. In the 1960s and ’70s the store became known for its denim clothes and accessories in particular. The KSU Museum boasts an extensive collection of its denim fashions and accessories, donated directly by the business when the museum was founded. Among the many Serendipity 3 pieces in the collection are several that make references to Asian design motifs (fig. 21). The exhibition includes a denim maxi skirt hand-painted with a female figure that draws heavily from Indian aesthetics. Men also looked to India for inspiration as they adopted a style of suit jacket named after Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India. The opening up of fashion choices to include design ideas from other cultures allowed Americans to break away from 32 Figure 20 (top).

This was particularly the case for men, who had long been confined to the strict uniformity of the suit. While the Nehru jacket allowed for restyling the conventional suit coat, some men were even more adventurous. African American men began to adopt elements of traditional African dress as a means of honoring their heritage; notable among these is the dashiki. The word dashiki comes from the Yoruba or Hausa word danshiki and refers to a style of tunic worn by men in West Africa, specifically Nigeria. Credit for popularizing the dashiki among Americans is given to Jason Benning, who helped found the New Breed cooperative in New York City’s Harlem, which opened a store in 1967.18 The tunic included in this exhibition is actually from Northern Ghana, where Kent State University professor Fred Smith purchased it (fig. 22). This style of garment was not technically a dashiki, which was developed by cultures farther south in Ghana and in neighboring Nigeria. Ultimately dashiki became a general term for the styles of shirt that became popular both across West Africa and throughout the African diaspora. High fashion also exploited the popularity of global inspiration not just in actual clothing design but also in the settings for photo shoots. Cuban writer Edmundo Desnoes criticized the trend in an essay titled “Suzy Parker and the Third World”: “The disdain and ridicule Figure 22. Embroidered smock from Northern Ghana, 1960s, on loan from Fred T. Smith, L2019.45.1. 33 of capitalist countries toward the Third World reached its peak in photographs that appeared in Harper’s Bazaar using the African continent to launch the latest exotic furs, hats and stockings. . . . There is elegance and exoticism in all these photographs, true, but there is also cruelty. The cruelty that uses men as decorative elements.”19 The 1960s were turbulent around the world, as former colonies broke from their imperial powers and achieved independence. Fashion reflected both the continued dominance of former colonial powers and the new valorization of previously subordinated cultures. While many fashion trends drew inspiration from foreign cultures, a number of designers developed purely original patterns and motifs. Emilio Pucci was one of the most significant designers who became known for his abstract and Figure 23. Printed blouse and wrap skirt by Emilio Pucci, ca. 1973, Gift of Charles Sawyer, KSUM 2001.50.1 ab. 34 Figure 24. Cotton dress and crocheted shawl with printed underwater scene by Tina Leser, ca. 1968, Gift of Mrs. Charles Rumsey in memory of Tina Leser, KSUM 1995.19.3 a-c. brilliantly colored patterns. Pucci had his roots in producing sportswear, and his clothing had a casual ease (fig. 23). He also produced an array of accessories and even housewares, ranging from the handbag included in the exhibition to scarves, jewelry, glasses, and even airline uniforms.20 Missoni was another Italian brand known for its bright patterns. Although the label was founded 1950s, it first found success in the 1960s and became widely influential starting the in early 1970s. Missoni specialized in innovative knitwear. The example included in this exhibition is representative of the label’s signature brightly colored designs in which the knit is skillfully placed on the diagonal. The multicolored buttons and bright green belt buckle add to the whimsy and humor of the piece. Another fun piece in the exhibition is a blue cotton dress by Tina Leser (1910– 1986), decorated with an undersea design of fish and coral (fig. 24). The dress, with its pattern so large that a single repeat fills it completely, is paired with a crocheted shawl adorned with appliqués of fish cut out of the same print. Although the cut of 35 this rather formal dress is conventional, its originality comes from the inventive print. Leser was known for her pioneering sportswear. She began her career as a fashion designer in Honolulu, where she focused on resort wear, including playsuits and coverups. This blue undersea dress retains the seaside theme even though Leser created it after moving her operations to New York. The spirit of fun in the works by designers such as Pucci, Missoni, and Tina Leser underscore the period’s lighthearted side. The fashion model Peggy Moffit summed up the spirit of the times: “If you are serious about fashion, you don’t take it seriously. . . . I don’t think fashion is a joke, but real fashion must have wit.” Although the 1960s and ’70s were a time of turbulence and protest, they were also full of youthful enthusiasm and innovation. T-shirts with political messages also date to the 1960s. In the 1950s, the T-shirt emerged as a garment in its own right rather than just underwear, and it quickly became a site for communicating messages. Whether advertising products or politics or broadcasting school affiliations, plain cotton T-shirts became 36 blank canvases. As protest movements grew in the 1960s and into the ’70s, the shirts’ messages were often political. The powerful legacy of this turbulent era can be seen in the design of T-shirts made to commemorate May 4, 1970. During the 1990s and continuing through 2000s, anniversaries of the event were marked with T-shirts, many of which are included in the exhibition. These attest to the continuing power of clothing to convey a powerful message and issue a direct call to remember and learn from the past. The 1960s marked a sharp rupture in style and the overall organization of the fashion industry. By the 1970s, couture fashion lost its place as the determinant of how Americans dressed. The growing influence of the baby boom generation can be seen in greater political consciousness but also in the shift in fashions that catered to young people. In many ways, college campuses led the push to more casual clothing, including the move toward women wearing pants and the ubiquity of blue jeans. By the late 1970s many of the innovations introduced by the counterculture found widespread acceptance by the Establishment and became mainstream. In fact, many styles we still wear today have their roots in the 1960s counterculture. About the Author Notes Sara Hume is Associate Professor and Curator of Kent State University Museum.

British designers such as Mary Quant and Barbara Hulanicki, the founder of the legendary Biba boutique, created vibrant, youthful, and affordable clothes that have come to define the look of the decade (fig. 1 previous page). The excitement of London’s fresh influence on fashion, however, did not entirely overshadow the significance of Paris, long established as the fashion capital of the world. That French fashion had lost its relevance is a persistent yet easily disproven myth. Even a cursory glance at leading fashion publications from this era demonstrates that magazines such as Vogue and Queen continued to feature French couture while simultaneously expanding their coverage of ready-to-wear. Faux tortoiseshell sunglasses by Emmanuelle Khanh, probably 1970s, Gift of Mrs. William McCormick Blair, Jr., KSUM 2001.43.17 a. 42 Although ready-to-wear clothing was not unheard of in France prior to the 1960s, it had suffered from a poor reputation. Initially known as confection, these machine-made, mass-produced garments were of dubious quality and design and were generally disregarded by fashionable women. While many French women could not afford couture, they often frequented the workrooms of “little dressmakers” who provided custom-made clothing at affordable prices. It is important to note that the wardrobes of most women during this time period—and French women, in particular—comprised fewer garments that were better made. As the fashion arbiter Geneviève Antoine Dariaux noted in her 1964 style guide Elegance, the Parisian woman “considers it a compliment (as is it meant to be) when her best friend says ‘I’m so glad you decided to wear your red dress—I’ve always loved it!’”2 Cheap, ready-made clothes were simply not a viable or necessary option for many French women. During the 1950s, prêt-à-porter replaced the term confection. A literal translation of the existing English phrase ready-to- wear, this new term was a clear nod to the fashion industry in the United States, known for its manufacture of stylish, massproduced garments. Yet, ready-made clothing in France needed more than a new name: it needed a new identity. Emmanuelle Khanh took on the challenge, establishing herself as a leader among a small but lively group of designers known as stylistes. Their strictly ready-to-wear creations were experimental in ways that couture could not afford to be. A couture garment was characterized by its lavish materials and extensive handwork, meaning that the production of even a sample was expensive. Furthermore, a couturier’s survival depended on his or her clientele, who could easily be alienated by ideas that were too avant-garde. The significantly lower cost of clothing by Khanh and other stylistes allowed for a free-spirited approach to design that appealed to their peers. By 1964, onethird of the population in France was under the age of twenty.3 This influential consumer group was determined to look and behave differently than its parents did.4 For young women, that 43 included purchasing fashionable clothes from shops rather than engaging in the time-consuming, outdated practice of frequenting dressmakers. The fashion press regularly mentioned Khanh’s name alongside those of several other young French designers, including Christiane Bailly, Daniel Hechter, Michèle Rosier, and Sonia Rykiel. Writing about the changes to the French fashion industry, the fashion journalist Hebe Dorsey noted that the stylistes were “a bit like The Beatles, with a great appeal to the masses from whence they came. They are free, unafraid—and will do vulgar things with fun and flair.” An especially audacious dress design by Khanh, dating to 1966, exemplifies this statement. It was made from wide stripes of colorful vinyl that could be stripped away, one by one, to shorten the skirt’s length (fig. 2). Although the stylistes were immensely important in France and abroad, their names are not always well known today, particularly among Americans. This is due in part to the fact that they regularly, though not always, worked under labels other than their own. Khanh, for example, designed for the French labels I.D., Pierre D’Alby, and Cacharel, as well as the New York boutique Paraphernalia. She also shared a label with Christiane Bailly, which they called Emma-Christie. Hechter negotiated licensing contracts with labels around the world, including the United States and Japan, and reported sales of $25 million by 1972.6 Michèle Rosier worked for Chloé and also established her own label, Vêtements de Vacances (V de V), which specialized in chic sporting attire (fig. 3). Sonia Rykiel began her career by designing for a Left Bank boutique called Laura, which was owned by her husband’s family. After divorcing Sam Rykiel in 1968, she began selling clothes under her own name. Figure 2. Dress by Emmanuelle Khanh made from removable strips of vinyl, 1966 Photograph ©Keystone Pictures USA/Alamy 44 Leading fashion magazines had little choice but to keep up. As the New York Times journalist Marylin Bender noted in her revealing 1967 book, The Beautiful People: “when the news of fashion is being made by and for the age group that subscribes to Mademoiselle, Glamour, Seventeen and Elle, their French equivalent that forcefully promoted the manufacture of ready-to-wear and gloated over the decline of haute couture, where do Vogue, the bible of American elegance, and its rival, Harper’s Bazaar, go? They raid the territory of their younger sisters. That’s where the action is.”8 Sandra Horvitz, a young editor at Mademoiselle during the 1960s, recalled the tremendous impact that Elle had on other fashion magazines, including her own New York–based publication.9 Under the direction of Hélène Gordon-Lazareff (who also happened to be Michèle Rosier’s mother), Elle did not entirely eschew couture, but it was more focused on the innovative ready-to-wear offerings of the stylistes. Figure 3. Ski and après-ski ensembles designed by Michèle Rosier, 1966 Photograph ©Keystone Pictures USA/Alamy 45 Horvitz recalled that as the 1960s progressed, Elle’s influence resulted in the growing popularity of ready-to-wear fashion shows in Paris. As a regular attendee, Horvitz would select styles to be featured in Mademoiselle—and she also chose designs for her personal wardrobe (fig. 4). The increasing influence of the stylistes—and by extension the assertion of ready-to-wear as a consumerist force— was evident by the mid-1960s. It was impossible for couturiers not to take note of these changes, and several adapted accordingly. Pierre Cardin, who had worked for Christian Dior before opening his own couture house in 1950, was known as one of the “least stuffy” of the couturiers.10 He had even shown an early interest in ready-to-wear, when he planned a line of prêt-à-porter to be sold in Paris’s Printemps department store in 1959. This endeavor led to his expulsion from the Chambre syndicale—the governing body of the French couture industry—who cited his violation of a rule dictating that any ready-to-wear designs by a couturier could only be sold in his or her own boutique.11 Although Cardin continued to 46 produce couture, he maintained a keen understanding of the future of fashion. In a 1964 interview for the New York Times Magazine, he expressed his belief that couturiers should introduce a limited number of changes to fashion each season, as the industry had become too democratic for the dictatorial voice of the couturier.12 The most acclaimed launch of a couturier’s ready-to-wear line occurred in 1966, when Yves Saint Laurent, who also trained with Dior, opened his Rive Gauche boutique. Literally meaning “Left Bank,” Rive Gauche referred to the boutique’s location in an area with a reputation for being the “bohemian” part of Paris. Because Saint Laurent was one of the most famous couturiers of the 1960s, his Rive Gauche designs enjoyed an immediate Figure 4. Dress by Emmanuelle Khanh for I.D., 1966. The Museum at FIT, 77.57.2. Gift of Sandy Horvitz. Photograph © The Museum at FIT cachet. And because the designs introduced in his couture collections were similar to those sold at the store, more women could afford the distinctive Saint Laurent look. That did not mean that Rive Gauche offerings were considered a bargain. As Marylin Bender observed, Saint Laurent’s ready-to-wear fashions were still costly, describing a particular garment—a shiny, yellow vinyl raincoat with crocheted sleeves—to exemplify her point.13 Costing $90 in 1966, or more than $700 in 2019, this distinctive jacket was hardly an impulse purchase for the average woman (fig. 5). Figure 5. Raincoat by Saint Laurent Rive Gauche, fall 1966. The Museum at FIT, 77.21.4. Gift of Ethel Scull. Photograph © The Museum at FIT 47 Alongside Cardin and Saint Laurent, André Courrèges was considered one of the most innovative couturiers working in Paris during the 1960s. A protégé of Cristóbal Balenciaga, he developed a sleek, minimalist aesthetic that was the result of his mastery of cut. Yet his streamlined silhouettes were especially vulnerable to poor ready-made copies (fig. 6). Rather than see women dressed in such low-quality imitations, the couturier decided to offer more accessible versions of his designs. In 1966, he presented a runway show with a variety of options: couture (designated as “Prototypes”); ready-to wear (cleverly called “Couture Future”); and an even less expensive ready-towear line similar in concept to today’s “diffusion” lines (he called it “Hyperbole”). To showcase couture designs alongside ready-to-wear creations was a bold and unprecedented move.14 The couturiers’ firm stamp of approval on prêt-à-porter was critical to its widespread acceptance and growth in France. It should not be forgotten, though, that couturiers often followed the daring experimentations of the stylistes. As a whole, the changes that took place in the fashion industry during 1960s, in France and abroad, provided the framework for the ways fashion is produced and consumed today. As one of the most dynamic periods in fashion history— aesthetically and commercially—it is little wonder that the 1960s continue to fascinate dress enthusiasts of all kinds, including designers, historians, and museum visitors.

Instead, many chose to rebel against the “Establishment”—schools, government, the military, religion—and bring about sweeping social change through activism and protest. At college, they demanded that students have rights of free speech and that school bans on political activity on campus be rescinded. In the civil rights movement, they registered voters and protested the delays in implementing court-mandated desegregation in the South. In the Second-wave feminist movement, they marched for women’s pay equality and reproductive self-determination. And they joined with American Indians to bring attention to the government’s broken treaties and neglect. Most galvanizing for all American young people at the time, though, was the Vietnam War (1965-75). No sooner had the first U.S. combat troops been sent to South Vietnam in 1965 than campuses nationwide erupted with antiwar demonstrations. Nightly TV news reports brought the war in Asia and the antiwar protests at home into millions of living rooms each night. The events of May 4 continued to draw protest activities, including Vietnam Vets Against the War (organization VVAW). Copyright: Kent State University 54 Shocked citizens across America watched the reports of the tens of thousands of antiwar protesters who marched on the Pentagon in 1967. And horrified parents were stunned by the televised scenes of violence against protesters during the 1968 police riot in Chicago, and most especially, the killing of unarmed students by national guardsmen in Ohio and Mississippi in 1970. The great majority of American youths, though, found ways other than activism and protests to rebel against sociopolitical conventions. For young men, the most direct and personal way to rebel was to choose a nonconformist, nontraditional look and dress. Particularly alarming to parents, teachers, and other adult authorities was long hair on men. With the appearance of the Beatles on American TV in 1964, teen boys were inspired to grow their hair long, a break with the gendernorm orthodoxies of masculine identity established during the era of Napoleon. At first, social opprobrium against men’s long hair was broad, but by the late 1960s, the look had evolved from a subversive defiance of masculine norms into a fashion trend featured throughout American popular culture. The Beatles likewise introduced to American youth a new concept in men’s clothing called mod, short for modernist. In England, the center of men’s mod styles was Carnaby Street, a narrow lane in Soho lined with specialty boutiques that offered young men fashions that were fresh, innovative, and decidedly nonconventional. Skinny rib pullovers flattered the slim youthful physique; shirts of the new synthetic fabrics in neon hues and psychedelic patterns were eyecatching; and see-through voile and lace shirts became all the more exhibitionistic when worn unbuttoned down the front. Jackets were tapered to fit snugly at the waist and hips, and variations were designed without traditional collars and lapels. Similarly, trousers and jeans were sexualized with a painted-on fit through the hips and thighs, and low-rise hiphugger waistbands. In 1968, the era’s iconic bellbottom cuff became a phenomenon that lasted through the mid-1970s. Among the favored mod accessories for young men were skinny ties in floral prints, scarves in 55 vibrant colors and patterns, and jewelry ranging from chain necklaces and ropes of love beads to multiples of bracelets and rings (fig. 1). For most traditionalists in America, mod styles were viewed as effeminate and antithetical to conventions of American masculine identity. Parents genuinely worried that such clothing might “turn” their sons gay. But since young women liked the modernity of the peacock revolution looks, the youthquake male gladly donned the latest Carnaby Street import or knock-off. The American menswear industry eagerly adapted Carnaby styles for the US market, many of which sold well, notably granny-print calico shirts in the new permanent-press fabrics, hiphugger pants, and tapered suits and sports jackets. However, for many American youthquake men, the once controversial mod fashions became too commercialized and mainstream, thus just another iteration of conformity. Instead, some young men explored a more personalized self-expression in their dress through street styles. The antiestablishment, 56 antiwar counterculture that emerged in the second half of the 1960s provided young men with an abundance of ideas for unconventional, individualist looks. The ultimate nonconformists of the period were the hippies, whose eclectic and nontraditional dress was a multicultural mix of clothing. Vintage styles from thrift shops were layered with military garments from surplus outlets, which were often combined with nonwestern styles that included embroidered East Indian shirts, African kente cloth tunics, Arabian kaftans, and colorful Mexican vests and ponchos, among others. In addition, hippies embellished their well-worn jeans with drawings in permanent marker of flower power motifs, antiwar symbols and slogans, and psychedelic swirls with strips of machine-made embroidery stitched to the cuffs of bell-bottoms or along the fly fronts and pocket edges. Among the preferred street looks of the peace-and-love flower children were handcrafted clothes and accessories. Such styles were often one-of-a-kind that allowed the wearer the truest form of independent, personal style. Many enterprising art Figure 1. “Uncommon shirtery,” asserts a 1969 ad from Carriage Club. students and craftspeople made extra cash by creating wearable handicrafts for “bein” and “sit-in” protests and, especially, for music festivals. Textile artisans skilled with knitting or macramé produced a wide variety of unique garments and accessories such as soft hats, bags, vests, scarves, and belts. Silkscreen printmakers adapted or copied graphics and messages from popular dorm posters and applied them to T-shirts. Still other handicrafters added embroidery or beading to flea-market clothing. The most ubiquitous handmade look of the era, though, was tie-dye. Not only was the process easy, quick, and inexpensive—requiring a twenty-cent box of powdered dye, a few rubber bands, and some hot water—but also each resulting pattern was unique. Still, even with the uniqueness that each flower child might achieve with his handcrafted clothing, ultimately the nonconventional look was tribal. The young people who wore flowers in their hair, painted their faces, and layered tiedyed, multicultural, and vintage clothing were mostly from white, middle-class families. Their street looks were a unified Figure 2. The look of the hippie was at once individualistic and, at the same time, tribal.

Yet, other tribal street looks were worn specifically to make protest statements. The more assertive antiwar young men selected protest clothing to declare unequivocally their stand against the draft, the military, and the war. In addition to long hair and perhaps strands of love beads, one of the most effective forms of antiwar protest dress was modified military garments, particularly those in the distinctive army olive green color, which were cheap and easily available through army-navy surplus outlets. Activists tribalized these symbols of the military establishment with antiwar messages and graphics written in permanent marker, silkscreened, or painted on them, especially the circular peace sign. Military garb was further tribalized with the addition of laminated buttons proclaiming antiwar messages, often worn in multiples clustered on lapels and sleeves. Probably the most incendiary antiwar protest look, though, were patchworks made of pieces cut from 57 US flags that were stitched to the seats of jeans or backs of jackets. Wearers of the patches ran the risk of confrontations and even violence on the street from supporters of the war. In African-American communities, the emergence of a new masculine identity was equally dramatic. Among young, urban black men and women, the civil rights movement had in"
