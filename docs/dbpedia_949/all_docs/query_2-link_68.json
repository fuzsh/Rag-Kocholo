        "text": "Biography of Anselm Kiefer\n\nAnselm Kiefer is considered as the most important German artist of the second half of the twentieth century. Anselm Kiefer is born in 1945 in Donaueschingen, on the borders of Switzerland, Austria and France. Student in literature and linguistics, he turns to art in 1966, attending the academies in Freiburg, Karlsruhe and Düsseldorf (with Joseph Beuys). In 1969, he becomes famous by taking himself in picture, a self portrait in which he greets with the Nazi salute in major cities of EEurope; his will is to awaken the conscience by claiming that Nazism is not dead and remains hidden. In the 80's, Kiefer works in Buchen in Baden-Wuerttemberg. In 1993, he settles and works in France (in the Gard – that he left recently - and in Croissy-Beaubourg in Seine-et-Marne). The works of Anselm Kiefer, saturated by material (sand, earth, lead sheets that Kiefer calls “Books”, soot, saliva, chalk, hair, ashes, ruins material and waste), evoke the disaster and the destruction of World War II, especially the Holocaust. Convinced of the need to revisit the identity of the German post-war, without denying, Kiefer questions its grand narratives, its historical events foundation, its great philosophical, literary and poetry figures, giving a speech against oblivion and barbarism. A prolific artist, poet, photographer, sculptor, traveler, Kiefer seeks the truth in history, without landmarks which man could not be found. His works, often monumental, are part of the collections of major museums in the world."
