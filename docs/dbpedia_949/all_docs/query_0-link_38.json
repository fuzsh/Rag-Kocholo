        "text": "Herding Cat Owners\n\nGroups to encourage veterinary clinic visits\n\nBy Greg Cima\n\nToo few pets, particularly cats, are visiting veterinary clinics every year, according to groups trying to increase preventive care visits.\n\nDr. Elizabeth J. Colleran, a practice owner from northern California, said a veterinarian needs to convey to a cat owner the value of annual checkups during an owner's first visit, which otherwise could be their last visit.\n\n“We do see cats once, then lose them,” she said.\n\nJohn Volk, a senior consultant for Brakke Consulting, said 83 percent of cats are brought to veterinarians within the first year of ownership, yet fewer than half of the cats in the U.S. have yearly visits.\n\n“That's one shot the veterinary professional has to really educate those cat owners” about the need to come back, he said.\n\nDr. Colleran, who is a spokeswoman for the Cat Friendly Practice initiative of the American Association of Feline Practitioners, delivered a series of lectures during the AVMA Annual Convention in July in Chicago on educating clients and reducing stress for cats and clients. She and Volk also were among speakers who, in a press presentation during the convention, provided some survey results from one in a series of studies, the “Bayer Veterinary Care Usage Study III: Feline Findings,” and suggested ways for veterinarians to draw in more cat patients. The findings provided by Bayer are based on studies of veterinarians and pet owners.\n\nIn addition, a $5.5 million advertising campaign by the Partners for Healthy Pets—announced just before the convention—will promote yearly veterinary checkups as being “as essential as food and love” for dogs and cats. The ads and public service announcements from the campaign will run from this October through the end of 2014.\n\nThe Partners for Healthy Pets is a campaign by the Partnership for Preventive Pet Healthcare, a committee of the American Veterinary Medical Foundation. The AVMA is among more than 90 sponsor organizations.\n\nChanging attitudes, behavior\n\nDr. Ron DeHaven, AVMA CEO, said the Association has seen a correlation between a decrease in the frequency of pet visits to veterinarians and an increase in the incidence of preventable pet diseases. The AVMA and other organizations in the Partners program want to ensure pets receive the preventive care that they deserve through regular visits to a veterinarian.\n\n“We want there really to be a relationship between the pet owner and the veterinarian, where we look at the lifelong plan that is going to ensure the best health and happiness for the pet and the pet owner as well,” he said.\n\nPrior to the 2012 convention in San Diego, the AVMA Executive Board approved spending $1 million on advertising intended to explain to pet owners the importance of preventive care and to encourage pet owners to visit veterinarians. That money will go toward the current advertising campaign.\n\nThe Partners program's advertisements are scheduled to appear on websites of media outlets such as NPR, CNN, and network TV affiliates, and public service announcements will be provided for such local TV stations to air, according to Brenda Andresen, marketing and projects director for the Partners program.\n\nThe Partners program also has been providing tools intended to help veterinarians deliver preventive care by improving communication with clients, increasing marketing, creating preventive health care plans, and making practices more friendly for cats.\n\nAndresen said pet owners have been cutting expenses for preventive care for their pets as well as for themselves.\n\n“Bottom line, we need to change behavior,” she said.\n\nPerception problem\n\nCats are seen as low-maintenance, independent pets, and owners often assume that their lifetimes spent indoors protect cats from disease sources, Volk said. Nearly 40 percent of cat owners surveyed do not think their cats need yearly veterinary visits, and many owners do not realize that cats are adept at hiding injury and illness.\n\nEven state laws indirectly support the contention that dogs need more care than cats, as all states have requirements for rabies vaccination of dogs but not all do for cats.\n\n“Many people ignore rabies vaccination requirements for cats, anyway,” he said.\n\nSurvey respondents indicated about 70 percent of cats were acquired for free, which seldom is true for dogs, Volk said. As a result, cat owners received little or no instruction on veterinary care, whereas dog breeders and shelter employees often give instructions on veterinary care to new dog owners.\n\n“A cat is often an accidental acquisition; they are often acquired without prior forethought,” Volk said.\n\nWhile the survey results indicated slightly fewer than half of cats visited a veterinarian yearly, they also showed that more than four of five cat owners claim to have a regular veterinary practice, and 90 percent of them were satisfied with that practice, he said.\n\nReducing stress, explaining need\n\nCiting the Bayer survey results, Dr. Colleran said nearly 40 percent of cat owners indicated that they become stressed when thinking about bringing their cats to a veterinarian. Ideally, a visit should be “a consultation instead of a rodeo,” she said.\n\nShe encouraged those in attendance to consider ways to improve a clinic visit, including the 30 to 45 minutes before a cat and its owner's arrival. For example, she suggested teaching clients how to accustom their cats to carriers and vehicles and how to handle their cats when preparing for travel.\n\nDr. Colleran also encouraged veterinarians to create separate areas for only cats within clinics, including examination rooms and reception room areas, when possible. Cat toys and other enrichment resources, in examination rooms and reception areas, can help cats and clients feel more comfortable.\n\nShe noted that keeping other pets at a clinic out of sight, reducing sounds, and eliminating stress-inducing smells can help keep a cat calm.\n\nDr. Colleran also encouraged veterinarians to work with clinic staff to develop a summary explanation of why yearly checkups are important. For example, she said clients could be told that checkups give cats longer, healthier lives, which benefits the owners, cats, and veterinarians.\n\nShe noted that clinic employees also need to know the value of preventive care. Citing the Bayer survey results, Dr. Colleran said 20 percent of veterinarians reported they had not brought their own cats in for examinations during the past year, which could adversely influence the perceptions of the staff members who should be promoting annual visits.\n\nIncreasing visits also involves making an assertive recommendation for follow-up appointments as well as asking dog owners whether they own other pets, she said.\n\nAttendees at Dr. Colleran's sessions received copies of the AAFP document “Ten Solutions to Increase Cat Visits,” which was developed on the basis of findings concerning cats from the Bayer study. That document is available at www.catvets.com/education/bvcus3. She encouraged attendees to participate in the AAFP Cat Friendly Practice program, for which information is available at www.catvets.com.\n\nInformation about the Partners for Healthy Pets campaign is available at www.partnersforhealthypets.org.\n\nFindings from the Bayer survey are available in the feline practitioners resource center at www.bayerdvm.com.\n\nA first-rate convention in the Second City\n\nAVMA convention celebrates 150th anniversary\n\nBy R. Scott Nolen\n\nThousands of veterinary professionals enjoyed top-notch continuing education programming and entertainment as part of the historic 150th AVMA Annual Convention held July 19–23 in Chicago.\n\nIn honor of the AVMA's sesquicentennial anniversary, festivities and educational sessions were held throughout the convention.\n\n“It isn't often that a professional society gets to be 150,” said Dr. Ron Banks, chair of the AVMA Convention Management and Program Committee. “This year's convention looked at the origins of organized veterinary medicine in the United States, considered the amazing technology and medicine of the present, and imagined the wonders of the days yet to come.”\n\nThe total number of convention registrants was 9,089, of whom 4,097 were veterinarians, according to Kelly Fox, AVMA Convention and Meeting Planning Division director.\n\nThe 4 1/2-day meeting commenced with the opening session emceed by famed Chicago news anchor Bill Kurtis. Hill's Pet Nutrition sponsored the event, which featured a theatrical presentation on the history of the AVMA and its evolution, milestones, and continuing mission, shared via a live-action stage tribute (see page 587).\n\nAfterward, the American Veterinary Medical Foundation hosted an event at the Shedd Aquarium highlighting its activities and Chicago's diverse culinary offerings.\n\nMore than 1,000 hours of CE covering a broad range of animal species were offered over the course of the Chicago convention. Supplemental training sessions allowing private practice veterinarians to earn accreditation through the Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Accreditation Program were also available.\n\nThe International Association of Human-Animal Interaction Organizations developed educational sessions in collaboration with the American Association of Human-Animal Bond Veterinarians. The IAHAIO for the first time hosted its international conference in the United States and in conjunction with the AVMA Annual Convention.\n\nVeterinary products of more than 300 companies were on display in the exhibit hall at McCormick Place, along with a traveling exhibition developed by the AVMA and Zoetis in collaboration with the Smithsonian Institution. “Animal Connections: Our Journey Together” explores the complex bonds between humans and animals (see page 592). With more than 1,000 square feet of interactive exhibits, videos, and displays, the exhibtion has made stops at parks around Chicago and will travel throughout the U.S.\n\nVolunteers helped a local Chicago animal shelter by assembling adoption bags as part of the AVMF Our Oath in Action Volunteer project. Cheap Trick headlined the AVMA Concert, sponsored by Merial, and Chicago's Lincoln Park Zoo was the site of the convention's Family Night.\n\n“As promised, the Second City convention was second to none,” Dr. Banks said. “Attendees from around the world and spanning over two dozen veterinary and animal care specialties assembled, networked, and shared their knowledge, their experiences, and their dreams for the future of animal care and animal engagement.\n\n“While there are several professional meetings each year, there has never been a veterinary meeting for an association that's made it to 150 years. We look forward to building on this foundation for the 2015 Convention in Denver, July 25–29.”\n\nCast of characters opens historic convention\n\nBill Kurtis emcees AVMA opening session in Chicago\n\nBy Susan C. Kahler\n\nFamous veterinarians from the annals of U.S. veterinary history joined broadcast journalist Bill Kurtis the evening of July 19 as he hosted the opening session of the AVMA's 150th anniversary convention at Chicago's McCormick Place, sponsored by Hill's Pet Nutrition.\n\nCameos by veterinary figures from centuries past traced the course of the profession through six eras, accompanied by audio and visuals re-creating the times.\n\n“In the Beginning,” from 1863–1900, was a time when the nation's population increased and demand for safer food and better disease control grew. Animals played an integral role in agriculture and the Civil War, but educated veterinarians to keep them healthy were in short supply. “So the stage was set for a more formal endeavor on behalf of veterinary medicine,” Kurtis said.\n\nThe character of Dr. Alexandre Liautard, one of the 1863 founders of the United States Veterinary Medical Association—the AVMA's precursor—was first to take the stage. “Our early efforts with the USVMA focused on setting higher educational standards for the profession … and graduation requirements for all veterinary students,” he said. “The fledgling organization was serious about its desire to help shape public policy, so we began openly lobbying the federal government on behalf of its members and the profession.” Dr. Liautard was also the first editor of the American Veterinary Review, which became JAVMA.\n\nOther advances during that era included the work of Dr. Daniel Salmon and Theobald Smith, MD, and the federal government replacing farriers and uneducated “horse doctors” with veterinarians.\n\nThe character of Dr. Elinor McGrath narrated “A New Century,” 1900–1929, telling how she became the first female AVMA member, following in the footsteps of the first female veterinary college graduate, Dr. Mignon Nicholson. “Taking another progressive step, the first African-American members were admitted to the AVMA in 1920,” she noted.\n\nWith the end of World War I and a decline in the need for horse care came companion animal veterinarians, Kurtis said. “And so it's been throughout the AVMA's history, the organization has always responded to the direction and needs as set by our culture and our society.”\n\nDuring this era, Kurtis said, a boy was born in Chicago who would dedicate his life to advancing the understanding of the connections between human and animal health. To the audience's delight, Dr. James H. Steele, known as the father of veterinary public health, appeared via video, congratulating the AVMA on its anniversary. The centenarian noted the Association was 50 years old when he was born and expressed hope that many present would be back for the AVMA's 200th anniversary.\n\nThe next era, “A Changing World,” 1930–1959, saw the stock market crash and Great Depression. AVMA milestones included formation of the Council on Research and founding of the American Journal of Veterinary Research and the AVMA's Washington office.\n\nA World War II era newsboy strutted across the stage hawking copies of JAVMA that told of veterinarians' farranging wartime contributions, from checking sanitation conditions to caring for messenger pigeons and guard dogs.\n\n“Staying the Course,” 1960–1979, was personified by a '60s veterinarian praising veterinary involvement in the space program, and Kurtis recounting creation of the first euthanasia panel and the work of Dr. Calvin Schwabe, the father of veterinary epidemiology.\n\n“An Evolving Profession,” 1980–2000, saw a majority of AVMA members working primarily in small animal practice, the emergence of technology, and formation of the AVMA Veterinary Medical Assistance Teams.\n\nThe final scene: In the “The New Millennium” era, a graduating student and Dr. Liautard are left to ponder the daunting task facing contemporary veterinarians of choosing from among so many species and specialty career focuses.\n\nDuring the opening event, two veterinarians were recognized—Dr. James H. Brandt with the top honor, the AVMA Award (see page 589), and Dr. Benjamin Hart with the Leo K. Bustad Companion Animal Practitioner of the Year Award (see below).\n\nDr. Ellen Lowery of Hill's and AVMA CEO Ron DeHaven talked about the nationwide Partners for Healthy Pets preventive care program, being led by the AVMA and the American Animal Hospital Association. Dr. DeHaven encouraged attendees to activate the campaign in their practices by enrolling online at www.partnersforhealthypets.org, where they can also find relevant practice tools. See page 583 for a story about the program.\n\nIn conclusion, Kurtis said the profession has come from small beginnings to global influence, adding, “American veterinarians are admired and respected worldwide. And the American Veterinary Medical Association stands as their voice, their foundation, and their biggest supporter.\n\n“Congratulations to each of you for picking a profession so profoundly compassionate and caring.”\n\nBustad award goes to behaviorist\n\nDr. Benjamin L. Hart has devoted his career of more than half a century in academia to the areas of animal behavior and the human-animal bond.\n\nDuring the July 19 opening session of the AVMA Annual Convention, Dr. Hart received the 2013 Bustad Companion Animal Practitioner of the Year Award for his efforts to support the human-animal bond. The AVMA and Hill's Pet Nutrition co-sponsor the Bustad award with Pet Partners, formerly the Delta Society, which seeks to improve human health through therapy and service animals.\n\nDr. Hart developed an interest in animal behavior as a veterinary student. He earned his veterinary degree in 1960 and a doctorate in 1964, both from the University of Minnesota. He joined the faculty of the University of California-Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, where he is now a professor emeritus.\n\nDr. Hart has been a researcher, author, educator, mentor, lecturer, and collaborator. He was instrumental in development of the Companion Animal Behavior Program at UC-Davis. He is a founding member of the American College of Veterinary Behaviorists and the International Society of Anthrozoology.\n\nBrandt receives AVMA Award\n\nDr. James H. Brandt has been a leader of the veterinary profession through some difficult times. He was AVMA president during the Sept. 11 attacks. Until recently, he chaired the AVMA Group Health & Life Insurance Trust as it began the process of discontinuing major medical insurance, and he was just reappointed to the trust.\n\nDuring the July 19 opening session of the AVMA Annual Convention, Dr. Brandt received the AVMA Award for his contributions to organized veterinary medicine.\n\nDrs. Larry G. Dee and John R. Bass nominated Dr. Brandt for the honor. Dr. Bass wrote about Dr. Brandt's “long and illustrious career” and dedication to the profession. Dr. Dee wrote: “Jim has always been a class act. His calm demeanor and analytical mind have enhanced all the organizational activities where he has served.”\n\nDr. Brandt started out studying to be an engineer. When one of his dogs was hit by a car and he didn't know how to help it, he changed course to become a veterinarian. He earned his DVM degree from Oklahoma State University in 1964. He and his wife, Pat, moved to Florida afterward.\n\nAfter working for a practitioner in Sarasota for a year, Dr. Brandt opened a mixed animal practice in Nokomis. When the last dairy in the area closed, the practice turned exclusively small animal. In 1991, he opened a second small animal practice in Venice.\n\nDr. Brandt became very active in organized veterinary medicine while in practice. “Participation seemed to make me feel more involved in the profession and actually made practice that much more enjoyable,” he said.\n\nHe was president of the Florida VMA and the Southwest Florida VMA, and he served as Florida's alternate delegate and delegate to the AVMA House of Delegates. After retiring from practice in the late 1990s, he remained active with the AVMA.\n\n“I was president in 2001, and the terrorist attack created a personal anticipatory anxiety that cast a cloud over the experience, but overall, being president was an experience that I would never trade with anybody,” Dr. Brandt said.\n\n“There are so many wonderful people to associate with in veterinary medicine.”\n\nDr. Brandt's primary focus as 2001–2002 AVMA president was on veterinary economic issues. He continues to espouse the message that continuous improvement will result in fundamental change.\n\nAfter serving as president, Dr. Brandt was 2002–2003 chair of the AVMA Executive Board. He has been a GHLIT trustee since 2005, serving as chair from 2011–2013, and was recently appointed to his third and final four-year term.\n\nThe GHLIT, unable to find an underwriter for major medical insurance after 2013 because of uncertainty surrounding the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, has created a private insurance exchange to help AVMA members find other plans.\n\nDr. Brandt noted that the GHLIT will continue to offer other forms of insurance, such as life and disability. “But the health insurance was our largest benefit to the AVMA members,” he said. “That's the policy that no veterinarian wants to lose, but we have no choice.”\n\nAs the AVMA celebrates its 150th anniversary this year, Dr. Brandt looks back at nearly half a century in veterinary medicine and says, overall, the profession has done a wonderful job keeping up with the times.\n\nThe Sept. 15 JAVMA News will feature career highlights of the recipients of other awards presented during the AVMA Annual Convention.\n\nChicago Snapshots\n\nShowing is sometimes easier than telling. These snapshots highlight the wide array of events that made the 150th AVMA Annual Convention in Chicago one to remember.\n\nAVMA: Smithsonian exhibition shows veterinarians' roles\n\nBy Greg Cima\n\nA traveling exhibition shows visitors how veterinary medicine affects their lives, and describes the bond between humans and animals.\n\nAnna R. Cohn, director of the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service, said the exhibition, “Animal Connections: Our Journey Together,” will share knowledge with young people “who deserve to be inspired by the contributions veterinarians and veterinary medicine make every day of every year.”\n\nThe traveling exhibition debuted July 20 in the McCormick Place exhibit hall at the AVMA Annual Convention. The AVMA and Zoetis collaborated with the Smithsonian on developing the exhibition in time for the AVMA's 150th anniversary year.\n\n“In a mere 1,000 square feet, it opens our eyes, as it will for everyone who visits it, to the fact that animal health is directly tied to our own well-being, and it is veterinarians who are the active partners in ensuring a shared health globally,” Cohn said.\n\nThe exhibition is tailored to middle school–age audiences and their families, she said.\n\nIt was created to inspire the next generation of veterinarians, according to the exhibition website. It lets visitors explore topics involving animals in homes, on farms, in the wild, in zoos, and in veterinary clinics.\n\nDr. Douglas G. Aspros, 2012–2013 AVMA president, described the exhibition as a “dream come true,” and he praised it for including information on a broad scope of veterinary practice areas that work for the betterment of patients, owners, and society. He hopes the exhibition will motivate members of the public to examine how veterinary medicine intersects with their lives.\n\nHe said that when he heard the proposal to develop the exhibition at least five years ago, “It was a dream that seemed to me unlikely to happen.”\n\nThe AVMA wanted to bring attention to veterinary medicine, both for those who use veterinary services and for young people who could learn more about veterinarians and become interested in the profession, Dr. Aspros said.\n\nOn the morning the exhibition was unveiled, he smiled as he looked over the displays inside.\n\n“I'm proud to be a veterinarian, and, standing in this room, you can see the diversity of the professional activities of our members,” he said. “And it's cool.”\n\nAfter the AVMA Annual Convention, the Smithsonian planned to bring the exhibition to seven parks in Chicago, Cohn said. The next destinations were not yet announced, but the attraction will travel throughout the U.S.\n\n“The exhibit has captured tremendous interest, and it's in very high demand,” she said.\n\nIt could visit up to 45 sites annually, she said, including veterinary schools, state fairs, 4H and National FFA meetings, middle schools, parks, and community centers.\n\nThe Smithsonian operates the world's largest traveling exhibition service, and about 50 of its traveling exhibitions circulate yearly, Cohn said.\n\nDr. Aspros said the AVMA encourages members to volunteer to help educate the public when the exhibition moves into areas where they live.\n\nJ.B. Hancock, director of the AVMA Communications Division, said work on the Smithsonian project spanned eight years and many iterations, ending with a gratifying product “more impressive and engaging than we imagined.”\n\n“While we were only able to scratch the surface of all the ways in which veterinary medicine affects our lives every day, we hope the traveling exhibit will be a catalyst that inspires visitors to seek out more information about this wonderful profession and its role in society,” she said.\n\nVisit the exhibition website at www.sites.si.edu/animalconnections.\n\nNew policies, allied group for HOD\n\nAVMA takes stance on remote consulting, relocated pets\n\nBy Greg Cima and Malinda Larkin\n\nThe AVMA will oppose remote veterinary consulting, seek controls on adoption of relocated pets, and advocate for veterinarian notification about illegal drug residues.\n\nThe AVMA House of Delegates also will add representation from the American Holistic VMA, but, at least temporarily, declined to add representation for the American Academy of Veterinary Acupuncture.\n\nThe delegates took those actions July 19 at the HOD regular annual session, also passing a resolution that the Executive Board should give the delegates access to results from a survey on member satisfaction.\n\nThe new policy “Remote Consulting,” a revised version of the policy “Paid Media Consulting,” states that the AVMA opposes remote consulting by veterinarians to diagnose a condition or treat a patient in the absence of a veterinarian-client-patient relationship.\n\nDelegates from Hawaii and Alaska tried to introduce an amendment saying such consulting can be beneficial or acceptable when a veterinarian is unavailable geographically.\n\nDr. Dan Lafontaine, delegate for the American Association of Food Hygiene Veterinarians, countered, “In these states where there are unique situations, the state practice act is the proper place to make exemptions, not to have it in an AVMA policy that's this broad.”\n\nIn addition, the policy “Relocation of Pets for Adoption” was approved. This was developed in response to concerns expressed by AVMA members and veterinary associations that interstate transport of dogs and cats by animal control facilities, shelters, and rescue groups can increase the risk of infectious diseases being brought into local shelters and communities, according to the statement about the resolution.\n\nAnother resolution passed by delegates urges the Food and Drug Administration to require that livestock owners identify their veterinarians to the FDA when their animals are found to have illegal drug residues. The AVMA wants the agency to inform those veterinarians about the residues.\n\nThe Executive Board had recommended that both the American Holistic VMA and the American Academy of Veterinary Acupuncture be admitted as HOD members, but delegates admitted only the AHVMA, referring the resolution on the AAVA back to the Executive Board to examine whether the academy fittingly represents veterinary acupuncturists.\n\nFor an organization to qualify to be a member of the House of Delegates, it needs to have a national scope of practice, represent a broad field of professional veterinary activity, and have a prerequisite number of AVMA members. At least 90 percent of a constituent organization's members must be AVMA members. Those AVMA members need to constitute at least one percent of the AVMA's total membership, or 840 members as of Jan. 1, 2013.\n\nInformation given to delegates indicates 1,032 of the holistic VMA's 1,140 members are AVMA members, as are 843 of the acupuncture academy's 903 members.\n\nAmong acupuncturists, however, there are three certifying agencies: the Chi Institute of Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine, the International Veterinary Acupuncture Society, and the Medical Acupuncture for Veterinarians Program at Colorado State University.\n\nDr. David Ylander, Nebraska delegate, expressed concern that the AAVA more heavily represents the first two organizations, which promote Chinese medicine. He is a graduate of the Colorado State program that does not espouse that kind of medicine.\n\nDr. Nancy N. Scanlan, executive director of the American Holistic VMA, said in an interview prior to the delegates session that gaining representation in the House of Delegates would help her association's members communicate with the rest of the veterinary profession. She said some veterinarians have distorted views of those practicing alternative modalities, including views that they are using unscientific methods.\n\n“I think nothing could be further from the truth, but you don't know that if you don't sit down and talk to us every day or have one of us as your neighbor,” Dr. Scanlan said. “So, we look forward to it as a chance to communicate more closely with the rest of the veterinary community.”\n\nIn January, the House of Delegates had considered a resolution from the Connecticut VMA that the AVMA declare that homeopathy is ineffective, a resolution that Dr. Scanlan said was a surprise. But the delegates had referred the resolution to the Executive Board with a recommendation for further consideration by the Council on Veterinary Service.\n\nDr. Scanlan hopes that her organization can give delegates more information on modalities used outside of conventional medicine and the results AHVMA members have achieved by using those modalities. Her organization plans to watch for issues that could affect complementary and alternative veterinary medicine, and she expects that in the near future, the AHVMA will play an advisory role, rather than raise issues for the HOD to consider.\n\nAAVMC takes on bigger role with education council\n\nThe AVMA House of Delegates changed the AVMA Bylaws July 19 to alter the method of appointing members to the AVMA Council on Education. The AVMA and Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges will now share responsibility for making these appointments, covering the costs of participation, and providing staff support.\n\nThe amendment was a response to concerns that the previous method of appointment of COE members could lead to a perception that the AVMA was exerting an influence on the accreditation of veterinary colleges by the COE.\n\nThese concerns were expressed in public comments received during the U.S. Department of Education process last year to renew recognition of the COE as the accrediting body for veterinary colleges in the U.S.\n\nCommenters voiced support for the creation of a joint accrediting body similar to the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, the accrediting body for medical schools, which is run jointly by the Association of American Medical Colleges and American Medical Association.\n\nIn response, the COE and AAVMC developed the proposal to change the method of appointment of COE members.\n\nFormerly, the AVMA HOD elected 15 of the council's 20 members. The AAVMC and Canadian VMA appointed one member each, and the COE elected three public members.\n\nUnder the newly approved method, the AVMA and AAVMC will develop separate committees that will select eight and seven COE members, respectively. The three public members will continue to be elected by the COE, the Canadian representative will continue to be appointed by the Canadian VMA, and a veterinarian (formerly “liaison”) will continue to be appointed by the AAVMC.\n\nAnother bylaws amendment approved by the HOD removes the COE as a preapproval body for recommendations from the AVMA American Board of Veterinary Specialties to the AVMA Executive Board. The ABVS will now send recommendations directly to the board, with the COE retaining the option to comment.\n\nA third bylaws amendment updates the composition and responsibilities of the AVMA Council on Veterinary Service in an effort to attract younger members to serve on this council.\n\nHOD wants to maintain its existence\n\nBy Malinda Larkin\n\nThe AVMA House of Delegates has sent a clear message regarding its thinking about proposed changes to the AVMA governance structure: We're not going anywhere.\n\nDelegates discussed at length—first in reference committees and district caucuses on July 18 and then for an hour and a half during their regular annual session July 19—the Task Force on Governance and Member Participation's report, which includes recommendations the task force believes will make the Association more nimble and more open to member involvement.\n\nIn its report, the task force outlines a revamped governance structure for the AVMA that has a board of directors; advisory councils; a volunteer resources committee, which would identify and recruit candidates for volunteer leadership positions; and a veterinary issues forum, which would bring together stakeholders to solicit feedback and identify strategic issues. The report doesn't mention the HOD.\n\nBecause the task force delivered its report, and, therefore, concluded its work and was sunset, the Executive Board in June formed a team, the Governance Engagement Team, composed of AVMA volunteer leaders to communicate with AVMA members about the report, solicit feedback, and submit a final governance proposal to the board.\n\nDelegates chose to send their message to the team by submitting a last-minute resolution, introduced by District X, requesting that any final proposal for governance change for the AVMA include the HOD. It passed, with 72.5 percent of delegates voting in favor.\n\nParliamentarian Nancy Sylvester explained to the delegates that they cannot tell the team to include the HOD in their final report, because that entity “reports to the Executive Board, not to the HOD.\n\n“So, this is a recommendation. It doesn't guarantee anything except that the board would consider this recommendation,” she said.\n\nThat said, any changes made to the Association's governance structure would have to be approved by the HOD.\n\nDuring the governance discussion, many delegates expressed a desire to keep the HOD, but perhaps revamp it to be more effective by imposing term limits or having AVMA members directly elect delegates.\n\nDr. Myron Downs, Georgia alternate delegate, said throughout the process of developing a new governance structure for the AVMA—which was initiated by a resolution from the HOD during its 2011 regular annual session—many delegates have not thought they had a voice in the process or were being listened to, which contributed to the introduction of the resolution.\n\n“And now, we can start to have a conversation about making the AVMA the best it can be,” he said.\n\nNot everyone in the HOD believes the entity should remain, however.\n\nDr. Link Welborn, American Animal Hospital Association delegate, spoke against the resolution.\n\n“First, if you were developing governance of a new organization, would you conceive this (current) structure? We have overlapping and conflicting responsibilities (with the board). Today, there were seven resolutions and three bylaws amendments, and all were brought by the Executive Board, and there was minimal wordsmithing, which begs the question if bringing this group of people for this event was necessary. Was it a good use of your time or a good use of resources for members?” he asked. “Don't try to impose restrictions to maintain the HOD because it's personally fulfilling for us, and not recognizing there's a better way to do it.”\n\nOn July 23, the board recommended keeping an HOD-like structure in the governance model and underscored the importance of ongoing dialogue with the HOD.\n\nAVMA: Preventive care: good for animals and the profession\n\nNew AVMA president sees AVMA as vital to profession's health\n\nStory and photo by R. Scott Nolen\n\nThe veterinary profession is in constant peril, and, like any animal patient, in need of preventive care. So says Dr. Clark K. Fobian, incoming AVMA president.\n\nSpeaking during the AVMA House of Delegates regular annual session July 19 in Chicago, the companion animal practitioner from Sedalia, Mo., likened the veterinary profession to a puppy whose health is protected through preventive care. In Dr. Fobian's analogy, the profession is the puppy, and the AVMA is the veterinarian ensuring its well-being.\n\n“There is a perpetual barrage of regulatory, legislative, tax revenue–generating, technological, and societal threats that can impede the veterinarian's ability to practice medicine,” he explained. “Our profession, like the susceptible puppy, is in constant peril, and like the puppy, we as a profession need appropriate preventive care.\n\n“I contend that the AVMA provides this protection.”\n\nThe HOD elected Dr. Fobian AVMA president-elect in 2012, and on July 23, he succeeded Dr. Douglas G. Aspros as the Association's president on the final day of the AVMA Annual Convention in Chicago. Dr. Fobian has approximately 30 years of experience as a mixed and small animal veterinarian. The University of Missouri-Columbia College of Veterinary Medicine alum has served on the AVMA Executive Board since 2006 and is a former chair of the American Veterinary Medical Foundation\n\nDr. Fobian described the AVMA as a “highly successful organization” by most standards, representing more than 80 percent of the nation's veterinary profession. The Association's membership share has been higher, however, leading him to question why some veterinarians see no value in AVMA membership.\n\nInstead of ignoring these nonmembers, Dr. Fobian believes it is necessary to step up efforts to educate them and recent graduates about the important services provided by the Association. “We cannot be complacent when it comes to member recruitment,” he said. “The AVMA needs an ongoing commitment to sell its services to the veterinary community, just like the veterinarian has an ongoing commitment of selling his or her services to the animal-owning public.”\n\nAlong with serving as the voice of veterinarians, the AVMA excels as a powerful advocate for veterinarians and animals in Congress and in the state assemblies, according to Dr. Fobian. He also noted the AVMA is a founding member of the Partners for Healthy Pets, which is in the early stages of a national campaign promoting preventive pet care.\n\nAnother way the AVMA is working on behalf of the profession is through its recent efforts to better understand the markets for U.S. veterinary labor and services. In addition to conducting a major study of the U.S. veterinary workforce, the AVMA established a Veterinary Economics Division to collect and study economic data pertaining to the profession for the purpose of relieving the financial pressure felt by many veterinarians.\n\n“I could go on and on about how AVMA is an unparalleled organization. However, my concluding sentiments are quite simple: Let us remember who we are as a profession, what we do as a profession, and why we find it in our hearts to do the things we do,” Dr. Fobian said.\n\n“Our members think they want various benefits from the AVMA, be that insurance, a convention, or a journal,” he concluded. “But ultimately, what they need is a healthy and sustainable profession, and that is the most important member benefit AVMA strives to provide.”\n\nAVMA charts steady financial course\n\nBy Malinda Larkin\n\nThe AVMA has strong financial resources to invest in its future, including fund balances in excess of $30 million, Treasurer Barbara A. Schmidt told the AVMA House of Delegates July 19 during the AVMA Annual Convention in Chicago.\n\nAs of June 30, reserves were projected to be close to 96 percent of its annual operating expenses; the AVMA's policy is to maintain 50 percent to 150 percent of its annual operating expenses in reserves.\n\n“Our reserves serve as a financial asset for emergency needs and long-term stability. Additionally, reserves are also partially designated for specific strategic purposes,” Dr. Schmidt said.\n\nSince April 2008, $2.75 million has been designated for strategic initiatives and programs. More recently, this has included $1 million for the Partners for Healthy Pets direct-to-consumer campaign that was launched during this year's AVMA Annual Convention.\n\nIn addition, $5 million has been committed to the development of the AVMA's National Economics Strategy Reserve Fund for tactical plans, programs, and initiatives, including the new Veterinary Economics Strategy Committee and the AVMA Veterinary Economics Division. Then, on July 17, the Executive Board voted to allocate $250,000 from this reserve fund to implement a veterinary economics research program (see page 598).\n\nAll the while, the AVMA has maintained income in excess of expenses annually for at least 12 years, including 2013, during which it is expected that there will be a surplus income of more than $50,000. Plus, at the end of June, income from investments was just more than $567,000.\n\nThe 2014 budget is projected to have slightly more than $32.1 million in income and $31.2 million in expenses, which would result in surplus income exceeding $800,000.\n\n“It truly is an exciting time at the AVMA—to be a part of this forward-thinking strategic course to bring value and relevance to our members,” Dr. Schmidt said.\n\nThe votes are in\n\nIn Chicago, the House of Delegates filled vacancies on AVMA councils and the House Advisory Committee. The results are as follows:\n\nCouncil on Biologic and Therapeutic Agents\n\nDr. Michael Hodgman, Zumbrota, Minn., representing members-at-large; Dr. Laurel Gershwin, Davis, Calif., representing immunology; and Dr. K. Fred Gingrich II, Ashland, Ohio, representing private clinical practice, predominantly food animal\n\nCouncil on Education\n\nDr. William Epperson, Starkville, Miss., representing large animal clinical science; and Dr. Caroline Zeiss, New Haven, Conn., representing veterinary medical research\n\nCouncil on Public Health and Regulatory Veterinary Medicine\n\nDr. Stephan Schaefbauer, Raleigh, N.C., representing agricultural agencies; Dr. Brant Schumaker, Laramie, Wyo., representing public health agencies or the armed forces; and Dr. Elizabeth Wagstrom, Washington, D.C., representing members-at-large\n\nCouncil on Research\n\nDr. Anastasha Henderson, Yorba Linda, Calif., representing private clinical practice; and Drs.

Mark Cox, El Paso, Texas; Timothy Montgomery, Dacula, Ga.; and David Ylander, Alliance, Neb., all representing members-at-large\n\nAVMA: AVMA board OKs additional economics research\n\nThe AVMA will conduct a study meant to provide a better understanding of aspects of the national economy related to veterinary labor and services.\n\nThe economics research program follows the April release of the AVMA's 2013 U.S. Veterinary Workforce Study, which shows 12.5 percent of veterinarians' capacity to provide services went unused in 2012. Moreover, the study projects veterinary services will be underutilized for the next several years (see JAVMA, June 1, 2013, page 1444).\n\nThe AVMA Executive Board approved the plan at a meeting in Chicago on July 17. In its proposal to the board, the Veterinary Economics Strategy Committee stated its belief that the AVMA should continue to take an aggressive approach to identifying the economic issues affecting the veterinary workforce, studying them, and developing solutions to remedy them. The research program the strategy committee presented is based on an AVMA advisory group report recommending several responses by the AVMA to the veterinary workforce study.\n\nThe most pressing priorities, according to the committee, are as follows:\n\n• Determining the effects of the price of veterinary services and customer disposable income on the demand for veterinary services.\n\n• Determining the difference in characteristics between veterinary practices operating with excess capacity and those operating at full capacity.\n\n• Updating the veterinary workforce model developed in conjunction with the workforce study with specific practice information, such as for bovine and equine practices.\n\nThe Executive Board approved the plan and the estimated $250,000 to implement it. The first survey, anticipated for release in October, will focus on unemployment and underemployment, and will target veterinarians one, five, and 10 years after graduation.\n\nMeyer and Price elected to AVMA board leadership\n\nOn July 23, the final day of the AVMA Annual Convention in Chicago, the Executive Board elected and installed Dr. Thomas F. Meyer as its chair and Dr. V. Hugh Price Jr. as its vice chair for the 2013–2014 Association year.\n\nDr. Meyer has served on the Executive Board as the District XI representative since 2008. He and his wife, Dr. Jean Meyer, own an American Animal Hospital Association–certified mixed-animal practice in Vancouver, Wash.\n\nThe Washington State University College of Veterinary Medicine alum has served organized veterinary medicine in many capacities, including as a member of the AVMA House of Delegates and as chair of the House Advisory Committee.\n\nDr. Price was elected to the Executive Board as the District VIII representative in 2009. He is director of animal resources at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center at Shreveport, where he is also professor of molecular and cellular physiology and professor of emergency medicine. Prior to joining the Executive Board, Dr. Price served in the HOD and on the House Advisory Committee.\n\nBoard makes appointments\n\nThe AVMA Executive Board, meeting July 17 in Chicago, named the following individuals to the entities indicated, representing the designated areas. The duration of each term varies.\n\nAnimal Welfare Committee\n\nAmerican Association of Corporate and Public Practice Veterinarians alternate—Dr. Kelly Heath, Lincoln, Neb.; American Society of Veterinary Medical Association Executives alternate—Candace Joy, Snoqualmie, Wash.\n\nAquatic Veterinary Medicine Committee\n\nAcademia (veterinary school teaching, research, clinical, or extension faculty)—Dr. Esteban Soto, Basseterre, St. Kitts, West Indies\n\nClinical Practitioners Advisory Committee\n\nAmerican Association of Bovine Practitioners—Dr. Justin Kieffer, Somerset, Mich.\n\nCommittee on International Veterinary Affairs\n\nExecutive Board—Dr. Chester Rawson, Markesan, Wis.\n\nLegislative Advisory Committee\n\nAmerican Association of Bovine Practitioners—Dr. Virginia Fajt, College Station, Texas; American Association of Bovine Practitioners alternate—Dr. Cary Christensen, Overland Park, Kan.; American Association of Corporate and Public Practice Veterinarians—Dr. J.

Kahler\n\nIt was never J. Karl Wise's plan to devote his entire career to the veterinary profession. Nevertheless, prior to his retirement on Aug. 1, he had spent 36 years working with veterinarians, mostly at the AVMA.\n\nWise, PhD, progressed through four very different positions on the AVMA staff under five CEOs, culminating with the position that became his favorite, associate executive vice president and chief operating officer.\n\nAn agricultural economist by training, Dr. Wise joined the AVMA staff in 1977 after obtaining his doctorate at Pennsylvania State University. “I was thinking I'd stay three, four, five years max,” he said. “However, I was one of those lucky people who were given opportunities—including positions—that enabled me to grow and continue to contribute to the Association's evolving mission.”\n\nDr. Wise helped conduct a major veterinary manpower study, was staff consultant to the Manpower Committee, and created the AVMA economics survey program that continues today. In 1986, he left the AVMA to form a consulting firm, Wisemark Associates, focusing on veterinary marketing and economic research. Working for himself had been a dream since graduate school, and it taught him self-reliance.\n\nForming and running a firm also gave him deeper insights about veterinarians' small businesses. After five years in consulting, he applied for a position Hill's was funding at Kansas State University to create a practice management center and curriculum. Dr. Roland Dommert, then AVMA CEO, a member of the KSU search committee, asked whether he'd instead be interested in creating a new management group for the AVMA. In 1990, he accepted the new executive staff position of director of information management.\n\nDr. Wise staffed the AVMA Informatics Committee for many years and oversaw the development of the Association's Internet services. “I began to manage a lot of people and got very interested in association management in the '90s,” he said.\n\nDr. Janver Krehbiel, 2012–2013 board chair, said, “I met Karl in the early '90s when I served on the informatics committee, and I've had the pleasure of working with him on several AVMA entities over the past 20 years. He is a man of great integrity and humility, and his wisdom and patience are keys to his success in working with AVMA members, fellow staff, and our profession in general. His organizational skills have been tremendously useful in helping our organization grow and prosper.”\n\nDr. Wise's interest in association management and services led to his 1999 appointment as director of the Membership and Field Services Division. To understand all the AVMA was doing for members and the public, he immersed himself in learning about the Association in all its breadth, and association governance and structure overall. During the process, he pursued credentialing as a Certified Association Executive, passing the test in 2002.\n\nDr. Janet Donlin, CEO of the AVMA PLIT, worked with him on the AVMA executive staff for several years. She said, “Karl was a very committed professional colleague in terms of associations and association management, and I respected him for that. He really understood how associations should work and how they could provide excellent member services. He married that with his passion and appreciation for veterinarians. Karl is the reason I pursued my CAE. He mentored many folks at the AVMA and in the profession.”\n\nIn 2004, Dr. Wise was promoted to associate executive vice president in the Office of the Executive Vice President. He observed, “It's not surprising that someone who has an economics training perspective would move into a role as a senior individual in an organization like this, because economics gives you a framework for contemplating causal relationships. It has served me well in thinking broadly about organizational issues.”\n\nProud of things he helped accomplish through teamwork, he acknowledged the many “fantastic” volunteers, veterinarians, and staff he has worked with over the years. One team project, while he was staff assistant to the Strategic Planning Committee, was facilitating the process of the Executive Board taking ownership of the strategic planning function.\n\n“That was meaningful change,” Dr. Wise said. This transition in thinking toward a more sophisticated planning approach laid the foundation for the work of the AVMA 20/20 Vision Commission. Dr. Wise staffed the commission and helped provide guidance and insight to the volunteers serving on it, leading to the landmark report outlining the future needs of, and possibilities for, the Association.\n\nDr. Wise supervised construction after the AVMA purchased its current headquarters and later when the conference center was added and two stories were renovated.\n\nThe economist in him enjoyed working with the board and the economics steering and strategy committees to create the new Veterinary Economics Division headed by Michael Dicks, PhD. “That was fun, because I had a good idea what the economics division would do, how it could do it, and what it would take to do it,” Dr. Wise said.\n\nAVMA CEO Ron DeHaven said, “From his behind-the-scenes and supporting roles, Dr. Wise has been able to exert positive leadership throughout all parts of AVMA, especially on the staff and Executive Board. I personally have enjoyed and valued working with him over the past six years as we have successfully tackled several very complex and difficult issues.\n\n“We can all look back at his AVMA career with pride, knowing that the AVMA and the veterinary profession are better because of his time, talent, and efforts. We were extremely fortunate to have Karl at AVMA for all these years and will be forever indebted to him.”\n\nDr. Wise and his wife, Jane, are moving to their cottage in the woods near Baileys Harbor, Wis., along Lake Michigan. He plans to revisit artistic endeavors such as woodcarving, sketching, and stained-glass art; to travel more—including to some faraway places; to spend more time with his two sons' families; and, after a while, to explore volunteer opportunities.\n\nAs for future work projects, that remains to be seen.\n\nGranstrom promoted to AVMA executive position\n\nAs director of the AVMA Education and Research Division, Dr. David E. Granstrom has logged thousands of miles to participate in site visits for the AVMA Council on Education. Fortunately for him, he'll have to travel only a few feet for where he's going next.\n\nDr. Granstrom was announced as the Association's new associate executive vice president and chief operating officer, effective Aug. 5.\n\nHe will provide staff support to the AVMA House of Delegates, House Advisory Committee, and Judicial Council. In addition, he will work directly with many of the AVMA divisions, on top of collaborating with strategic plan goal managers and serving as liaison to the AVMA Group Health & Life Insurance Trust and AVMA PLIT. He succeeds J. Karl Wise, PhD, who retired as of Aug. 1 (see page 600).\n\nDr. Granstrom said, “It's an honor to follow in his footsteps to serve our great profession in this capacity. Fortunately, (AVMA CEO) Ron DeHaven has assembled an exceptional staff to support AVMA operations. I'm looking forward to working with them to continue moving the profession forward. I've greatly enjoyed working with the Council on Education and am pleased that my new position includes continued involvement with the Education and Research Division.”\n\nDr. Granstrom has been director of the Education and Research Division since March 2008. His responsibilities included overseeing AVMA policies and programs related to education, research, accreditation of veterinary colleges, certification of graduates of foreign colleges of veterinary medicine, and recognition of veterinary medical specialties.\n\nHis tenure coincided with a transformative period for the COE during which members began considering veterinary programs with alternative teaching models, such as those with off-campus clinical teaching sites. Also during this time, the council incorporated into its Accreditation Policies and Procedures manual wording requiring veterinary colleges to teach nonclinical skills, such as client communication, and generate more outcome assessment information, including results of employer and alumni surveys and clinical competency checklists.\n\nDr. Granstrom aided the COE, too, in receiving continued renewed recognition by the Council for\n\nHigher Education Accreditation and the U.S. Department of Education. The COE is still working to meet the DOE standards to extend recognition beyond this year.\n\nPrior to 2008, Dr. Granstrom spent seven years with the Department of Agriculture. From 1997–2001, he served as an assistant director in the AVMA Education and Research Division.\n\nIn addition, Dr. Granstrom was an associate professor of parasitology at the Maxwell H. Gluck Equine Research Center at the University of Kentucky Department of Veterinary Science from 1988–1997. There, he founded Equine Biodiagnostics Inc., which was later bought by Idexx.\n\nHe has also served as an environmental health officer for the U.S. Air Force Biomedical Science Corps and as a public health officer with the Kentucky Air National Guard Biomedical Science Corps.\n\nDr. Granstrom received his DVM degree in 1978 from Kansas State University, where he earned a doctorate in parasitology 10 years later. For five years, he owned a practice in Laurie, Mo.\n\nInnovator in nutrition\n\nDr. Mark L. Morris Sr. developed therapeutic diets for pets\n\nBy Katie Burns\n\nSmall animal medicine and the pet food industry were still in their infancy in the early 20th century when Dr. Mark L. Morris Sr. began developing therapeutic diets for pets.\n\nDr. Morris asked three big questions during his career, said grandson David Morris. Why is small animal medicine not as important to veterinarians as large animal medicine? What is the relationship between nutrition and disease in small animals? Why is there no charity for research on the health of small animals?\n\nIn answer, Dr. Morris built a small animal hospital and was founding president of the American Animal Hospital Association. He innovated therapeutic diets that became the basis of a family business, and later, Hill's Pet Nutrition. And, he established Morris Animal Foundation to fund studies in small animal medicine.\n\nSmall animal practice\n\n“Mark Morris: Veterinarian,” by Willard C. Haselbush, chronicles the life of Dr. Morris through the early 1980s. He was born in 1900 as the son of a shopkeeper in rural Colorado. His love of science was what led him into the field of veterinary medicine.\n\nAfter earning his veterinary degree from Cornell University in 1926, Dr. Morris bought a mixed animal practice in New Jersey.\n\n“This was an era of barn calls by day and evenings spent treating cats and dogs with problems or diseases that couldn't be identified by casual examination,” according to the Morris biography.\n\nBut Dr. Morris began applying his scientific approach to the treatment of small animals, borrowing a dairy's laboratory to analyze samples from pets. By 1928, he had built Raritan Animal Hospital to focus on small animal practice.\n\nIn late 1928, Dr. Morris married his wife, Louise. David Morris said his grandfather and grandmother were great partners. Dr. Morris had the ideas, and she helped him figure out the best opportunities.\n\nDuring the 1932 AVMA Annual Convention, Dr. Morris participated in a meeting of practitioners to establish an organization to set standards for small animal hospitals. He ended up as the first president of the American Animal Hospital Association.\n\nAll the while, Dr. Morris was collaborating on research in canine medicine, including nutrition.\n\nHill's Pet Nutrition\n\nAccording to his biography, Dr. Morris' lifelong devotion was the then-unheard-of doctrine “that food can function similarly to medicine and that proper nutrition can aid in managing many diseases.”\n\nIn his practice, Dr. Morris developed a therapeutic diet for dogs with kidney disease. He began sending clients home with a dry meal to mix with fresh protein.\n\nA turning point came when Dr. Morris met a blind man named Morris Frank and Frank's guide dog, Buddy. Dr. Morris diagnosed kidney disease in Buddy, and the Morrises began canning the therapeutic diet for him.\n\nOther customers were soon to follow. Dr. Morris added a new diet for growing puppies and pregnant dogs. In 1948, Dr. Morris contracted with Hill Packing Co. of Topeka, Kan., to take over the canning.\n\nThe Morrises moved to Topeka in 1951 with their children, Ruth and Mark Jr. The children would go on to join the family business, Ruth in public relations and Mark Jr. in product development. Mark Jr. earned his veterinary degree from Cornell in 1958.\n\nDr. Stan Teeter recalls when he started working with Mark Sr. in the late 1950s. Dr. Teeter was stationed at an Air Force base in Topeka where the sentry dogs were faring poorly for dietary reasons.\n\n“The pet food industry was not that up on being nutritionally sound,” Dr. Teeter said. “The whole pet food industry started as way to increase the value of byproducts, either from the cereal or the meat industry. It was all built on palatability and price.”\n\nDr. Teeter met with Dr. Morris for a consultation in a home office that was really a third-floor attic closet. The sentry dogs improved greatly on one of Dr. Morris' products.\n\nIn his time off, Dr. Teeter started going to Dr. Morris' laboratory to help with dietary research. After practicing for a while back home in Phoenix, he returned to Topeka in the 1960s to develop products with Mark Sr. and Mark Jr. He is now chair of the Morris Animal Foundation.\n\n“Mark Sr. was just a wonderful person to work with,” Dr. Teeter said. “He was always willing to listen to your ideas and had good discussions of possibilities to solve a problem.”\n\nThroughout his career, Dr. Morris Sr. kept in touch with practitioners as part of his extensive “library” of contacts. He served as the 1960–1961 AVMA president.\n\nEventually, Mark Jr. took over the family business. The partnership between the Morris family and Hill Packing Co. evolved into Hill's Pet Nutrition, owned by Colgate-Palmolive since 1976. David Morris is president of spinoff ZuPreem, which makes food for zoo animals and exotic pets.\n\nMorris Animal Foundation\n\nDr. Morris perceived a need for research on all aspects of small animal health, not just nutrition. He saw dogs being used for research in human medicine, Dr. Teeter said, but thought it was time to use dogs in research to benefit the health of dogs.\n\nIn 1948, Dr. Morris established the Buddy Foundation to fund studies in small animal health. He set aside half a cent of his royalties per can of dog food toward the endeavor.\n\nThe name was changed to the Morris Animal Foundation by the 1950s. The foundation is now an independent nonprofit organization that funds studies in canine, feline, equine, and wildlife medicine. Members of the Morris family remain among the trustees.\n\n“We have made progress against animal disease and through that effort have made contributions also to human health,” Dr. Morris told his biographer in 1982.\n\nDr. Morris died at age 92 in 1993.\n\n“I think that he was very proud to be a veterinarian. If he was here, he would see how significant the products have become,” David Morris said. “And I think that he would be thrilled about all of the activities and all of the advancements and really what we're trying to achieve at the foundation. I think he'd be very, very proud, and hopefully we're all living up to his expectations.”\n\n“Legends in U.S. veterinary medicine”\n\nIn honor of the AVMA's 150th anniversary this year, JAVMA News is profiling 12 individuals who have made substantial contributions to the American veterinary profession.\n\nIssues: Viral mutation related to deadly cat disease\n\nRecent research findings suggest that a viral mutation is connected with the development of a benign intestinal coronavirus into a pathogen deadly to cats.\n\nThe results published in July (Emerg Infect Dis 2013;19:1066–1073) indicate that researchers at the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine believe the mutation in feline enteric coronavirus' spike proteins is connected with development of feline infectious peritonitis. The researchers think the findings could be used toward developing diagnostic, prevention, and treatment measures against those coronaviruses' malignant forms, which kill their feline hosts.\n\nThe change occurs following interaction between the virus' spike proteins and macrophages.\n\nDr. Gary Whittaker, a virology professor at the veterinary college, said in a university announcement that FIP is tragic “for families falling in love with new kittens and veterinarians who can do nothing to stop it,” and that it was the university researchers who found the mutation that occurs in the transition of the enteric coronavirus from benign to pathogenic.\n\nThe announcement indicates researchers have tried to identify the mutation during the past three decades.\n\nThe article, “Mutation in Spike Protein Cleavage Site and Pathogenesis of Feline Coronavirus,” is also available at www.cdc.gov/eid.\n\nFDA taking comments on drug detention rules\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration is accepting comments on proposed regulations that would let the agency hold drugs believed to be adulterated or misbranded.\n\nThe FDA announced in the July 15 Federal Register that the agency would, through Sept. 13, accept comments on the proposal, intended to prevent illnesses and deaths by giving the FDA time to consider what actions are needed when its inspectors detect potentially unsafe pharmaceuticals intended for use in human or veterinary medicine. The agency already has such authority to hold medical devices, tobacco, and food.\n\nThe FDA also accepted comments on the proposal April 9-May 9, but the Federal Register notice published at the time included fewer details and did not include the text of the proposed regulations. The July 15 notice includes that text, much of which FDA officials indicate is modeled on the regulations for administrative detention of medical devices.\n\nIn proposing the rule, the agency cites authority granted under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, signed into law July 9, 2012.\n\nAdditional information is available at www.regulations.gov under docket number FDA-2013-N-0365. Comments can be submitted at that site or mailed to the Division of Dockets Management (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, Rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852.\n\nNational Provider Identifier numbers not for veterinarians\n\nVeterinarians are ineligible to receive a type of federal identification number used by health care providers in human medicine for some transactions, such as filling prescriptions.\n\nDr. Lynne A. White-Shim, an assistant director of the AVMA Scientific Activities Division, said officials with the Department of Health and Human Services recently confirmed that veterinarians are ineligible to receive National Provider Identifier numbers, even though applicants can indicate they are veterinarians in the online form. The AVMA previously received reports that pharmacies have requested such numbers from veterinarians. Dr. White-Shim suggested that veterinarians who receive such requests offer to instead provide their state-issued license number.\n\nInformation from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is part of the HHS, also indicates that veterinarians are ineligible for NPIs, and any ineligible person who has received such a number should send a request that the number be deactivated. The form for updating or deactivating an NPI is available at www.cms.gov/Medicare/CMS-Forms/CMS-Forms/downloads/CMS10114.pdf.\n\nA January 2004 Federal Register notice states that the NPIs were established as standard identification intended to simplify administration of the health care system and aid electronic transmission of health information. Each health care provider could have a different identification number from each federal or private health care plan, complicating the claim submission process and potentially resulting in multiple providers using the same numbers for different plans.\n\nPractice: CATalyst program to connect pet adopters, veterinarians\n\nThe CATalyst Council announced July 18 that the Portland, Ore., metro area had been selected for the launch of an initiative to provide the animal shelter cat population with permanent homes and regular postadoption veterinary care.\n\nThe CATalyst Connection establishes a formal network between the Oregon Humane Society and veterinarians to ensure the continuation of veterinary care once a cat has been adopted. A major focus of the CATalyst Connection is establishing a relationship between pet adopters and veterinarians.\n\nA key component of the new program is directly transferring health records from the OHS to the veterinarian chosen by the pet owner. The veterinarian will contact the pet owner to schedule a complimentary health check and examination, and will notify the OHS that a relationship has been established so that the OHS can track how many adopted pets receive their postadoption examination.\n\n“The Oregon Humane Society is eager to collect this data,” said OHS Executive Director Sharon Harmon. “Portland area veterinarians have shown a real dedication to caring for newly adopted shelter pets to ensure that these animals get the care they need and deserve. We are committed to improving the lives of adopted cats, and we expect great things from this partnership.”\n\nAn American Humane Association study, “Keeping pets in homes: A three-phase retention study,” shows that more than one in 10 animals adopted from animal shelters are no longer in their homes six months later, according to the CATalyst Council. This could represent several hundred thousand animals each year that are either given away, are lost, die, or are abandoned to uncertain fates, according to the study.\n\nThe council noted that the same study also found about 93 percent of adopted cats and dogs stay with their new family if they visit a veterinarian within six months after adoption. It has been shown that adoption retention rates increase substantially when a pet adopter establishes and maintains a regular relationship with a veterinarian, the council added.\n\nThe ability of the OHS to either place shelter pets in new homes or reunite them with their owners is a primary reason why the Portland area was chosen as the pilot city for the CATalyst Connection.\n\n“When it comes to saving lives of shelter pets, no city in the nation surpasses Portland,” said Dr. Jane Brunt, executive director of the CATalyst Council. “In 2012, the save rate for OHS was 98 percent, meaning that 98 percent of the animals admitted to the OHS shelter were adopted, reunited with their owner, or transferred to another humane organization dedicated to finding homes for pets. This stellar record is a reflection of the Oregon Humane Society's commitment to saving pets. Our hope is to be able to gather the data that will allow us to make the case to other communities that when shelters and veterinarians work together, everyone wins.”\n\nMore information on the Catalyst Connection can be found at www.catalystcouncil.org/connection.\n\nPractice: Pig virus can spread through packing plants\n\nBy Greg Cima\n\nA virus that infected U.S. pigs for the first time can spread through livestock trailers contaminated at packing plants, according to recent test results.\n\nAnalysis of environmental samples taken from about 700 livestock trailers at seven packing plants during June revealed that about 17 percent of trailers were contaminated on arrival with the virus that causes porcine epidemic diarrhea, and another 11 percent of trailers were contaminated while at the facilities, according to a preliminary abstract provided in a newsletter from the American Association of Swine Veterinarians.\n\n“These data suggest that harvest plants and similar livestock collection points serve as an effective method of contaminating fomites with PEDV and could play an important role in expanding the outbreak of PEDV in the U.S.,” the AASV announced in July.\n\nDr. James F. Lowe, the author of the abstract and a clinical instructor at the University of Illinois College of Veterinary Medicine, said the source of the contamination was not yet known, but he and other researchers were examining data on interactions among people and vehicles at packing plants.\n\n“We're in the process now of looking at some preliminary data to say ‘Why is that happening?’” he said.\n\nFactors examined include distances the trailer drivers walked into the plants, the order in which trucks were unloaded, and the methods used to unload pigs, Dr. Lowe said. He noted that the National Pork Board was coordinating meetings among packers and veterinarians to discuss actions that could be taken at plants to reduce the impact of the virus.\n\nThe NPB announced in July it would spend a total of $800,000 on research, education, and coordination efforts related to PED, up from $450,000 announced in June.\n\nPED is caused by a coronavirus that was first discovered in the U.S. in April. The disease has clinical signs similar to those for transmissible gastroenteritis, and outbreaks have caused the most deaths among the youngest pigs.\n\nThe AASV also reported in August that the virus had been identified in pigs on about 400 farms in 16 states. A previous report also had indicated it was identified in 16 states, but the latest report indicates that, contrary to the earlier report, no infections had been found in Arkansas, but an infection was found in Tennessee since the previous report.\n\nThe AASV newsletter sent July 17 states that veterinary diagnostic laboratories and the National Animal Health Laboratory Network are trying to provide accurate and useful reports, and the reports are more useful if submissions identify where the samples were taken, not the location of a corporate headquarters or the veterinarian's office.\n\nCommunity: Oregon dean moves to lead Virginia-Maryland\n\nDr. Cyril R. Clarke of Corvallis, Ore., has been named the fourth dean of the Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, effective Oct. 1.\n\nDr. Clarke currently serves as professor and dean of Oregon State University College of Veterinary Medicine.\n\nAt Virginia-Maryland, he will succeed Dr. Gerhardt G. Schurig, who will return to the faculty after 10 years as interim dean and then dean.\n\nA native of Johannesburg, Dr. Clarke helped strengthen the Oregon State veterinary college's clinical programs and student experiences. He was also instrumental in the collaborative creation of the university's new Division of Health Sciences between the veterinary and pharmacy colleges.\n\nA diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Clinical Pharmacology, Dr. Clarke was a faculty member from 1987–2007 at Oklahoma State University, where he also served as a department head and associate dean for academic affairs in the College of Veterinary Medicine. In 2007, he assumed the position of dean at Oregon State's veterinary college, where he also teaches pharmacology.\n\nDr. Clarke is a member of the board of directors for the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges. He is also a member of the Department of Agriculture's National Research, Extension, Education, and Economics Advisory Board and a past president of the American College of Veterinary Pharmacology and Therapeutics.\n\nIn the past, Dr. Clarke was honored with the Pfizer Award for Research Excellence and the Oregon VMA President's Award.\n\nHis research has focused on interactions among bacteria, antibacterial agents, and host defenses; drug disposition and pharmacokinetics; and biosensor technology development.\n\nHe received a BVSc degree from the University of Pretoria, South Africa, in 1981; a doctorate in veterinary pharmacology from Louisiana State University in 1987; and a master's in higher education from Oklahoma State in 2000.\n\nProposed New York veterinary project nixed\n\nPlans to create a proposed veterinary teaching hospital in Buffalo, N.Y., have come to a halt.\n\nNonprofit health care provider Kaleida Health announced in August 2012 that it had selected local real estate developer Chason Affinity's $65 million proposal to create a veterinary school at the site of one of the provider's hospitals—Millard Fillmore Gates Hospital—that closed in March that year. Kaleida offered a $1 million prize for the winning proposal.\n\nBut on July 12, the health care provider announced in a press release it would reissue a request for proposals to determine interest from others in developing the nearly 10-acre site.\n\nThe move comes after a year of negotiations between Chason Affinity and Devry Inc., a private, for-profit educational organization that operates the Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine in St. Kitts, West Indies, according to the release.\n\nA July 12 article in The Buffalo News said the plan evolved into creating a veterinary teaching hospital for Ross, which would have consolidated small animal clinical training for fourth-year students, instead of having students spend a year obtaining clinical experience at one of the U.S. veterinary colleges with which Ross has contracts. Obtaining experience with large animals would still have required the students to attend other campuses.\n\nChason was also attempting to partner with Medaille College's veterinary technology program and The SPCA Serving Erie County to open a small animal hospital at the former Gates campus, to create additional educational and training opportunities for students and veterinarians.\n\nThe news article quoted a statement from Chason Affinity that said the company worked diligently to advance its veterinary school proposal and was disappointed by Kaleida's decision to end the agreement after Ross backed out. The company said it is working on another project related to the veterinary field and would explore prospects for it elsewhere in Buffalo.\n\nCommunity: Oklahoma State establishes respiratory disease center\n\nA research team headed by Lin Liu, PhD, at the Oklahoma State University Center for Veterinary Health Sciences has received a nearly $11.3 million federal grant to establish the Oklahoma Center for Respiratory and Infectious Diseases.\n\nThe award is the first Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence grant in Oklahoma State's history, according to a July 18 university press release. It is spread over five years, from this past July through June 2018. COBRE funding comes from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health.\n\nThe Oklahoma Center for Respiratory and Infectious Diseases will bring together experts from Oklahoma State University, the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, and the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation.\n\nInvestigators at the new center will study respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, and respiratory bacterial infection, covering disease pathogenesis, therapeutics, molecular mechanisms, and bioengineering.\n\nOne major goal for the new center is to attract research faculty and mentor them so the center can develop a strong research and funding base from the NIH and other federal sponsors, said Dr. Jerry Malayer, associate dean for research and graduate education at the veterinary center.\n\n“Dr. Liu's leadership has shown what can be done when institutions in Oklahoma collaborate,” said Stephen McKeever, PhD, OSU vice president for research and technology transfer. “The National Institutes of Health recognize the excellence of the research into infectious diseases being conducted in Oklahoma, and this award will promote significant advances in several areas.”\n\nDr. Liu is director of the Lung Biology and Toxicology Laboratory in the veterinary center's Department of Physiological Sciences.\n\nAccolades\n\nAcademy of Veterinary Consultants\n\nDr. Mike Apley (KSU '87), a professor at Kansas State University College of Veterinary Medicine and section head of production medicine/clinical pharmacology, received the 2013 Outstanding Service Award from the Academy of Veterinary Consultants. The award was given for his work to improve animal health and veterinary medicine by sharing expertise on administration of antimicrobials to livestock.\n\nThe award was given during an AVC meeting in April.\n\nIdaho VMA\n\nDr. Jeff Heins (WSU '84), owner of Rupert Animal Clinic in Rupert was named the Idaho VMA's Veterinarian of the Year on June 17 during the Jackson Hole Veterinary Rendezvous, hosted by the Idaho and Wyoming VMAs in Jackson Hole, Wyo.\n\nThe IVMA recognized Dr. Heins for his outstanding achievements and contributions to the veterinary profession and the association.\n\nDr. Heins is a past president of the IVMA.

The AVMA's 86th president led a distinguished career in veterinary medicine and public service. He was an AVMA honor roll member.\n\nIn 1991, Dr. Schroeder received the AVMA Public Service Award for outstanding contributions to public health and regulatory veterinary medicine. “Some of the greatest moments of my life have been here with the AVMA, and this is certainly one of them,” he said in accepting the award.\n\nBorn into a farming family in Fort Collins, Colo., Dr. Schroeder received his DVM degree from Colorado State University in 1947 and spent the ensuing year with the Department of Agriculture working in Mexico on the Mexican-American campaign against foot-and-mouth disease. Then, he joined the Los Angeles County Livestock Department. In 1957, he was named director of the department, a title that changed to county veterinarian in 1965, and in 1972, he was promoted to deputy director of comparative medical and veterinary services, the position from which he retired in 1979.\n\nAt the University of Southern California School of Medicine, Dr. Schroeder held a dual academic appointment as clinical professor of pathology (comparative medicine) and clinical professor of community medicine and public health. He was instrumental in establishing the school's Section on Comparative Pathology. In 1979, the school named him emeritus professor of pathology.\n\nDr. Schroeder was instrumental in establishing the Center for Comparative Medicine at the University of California-Davis. He was a charter diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Preventive Medicine.\n\nIn 1966, Dr. Schroeder won a three-way contest for AVMA president-elect, defeating two veterinary college deans. Earlier, he had served on the Executive Board, from 1961–1966. In 1960, he was secretary of the AVMA Section on Regulatory Veterinary Medicine. When the AVMA established the National Television Advisory Committee in 1966, he was named to direct it. He was a member of the AVMA Council on Education from 1969–1974 and chair of what is now the Committee on Veterinary Technician Education and Activities.\n\nHis term as AVMA president was from 1967–1968. In his address as incoming president, he recommended that the House of Delegates instruct the Executive Board to immediately begin an in-depth study of large animal practice, which he thought was struggling. Only 7 percent of AVMA members were large animal practitioners at that time, and many were leaving for other fields. He also recommended that the AVMA redefine and clarify the AVMA administrative structure and responsibilities of officers and governance bodies, have the membership elect the president-elect, establish a continuing education program, and approve representation of special-interest groups in the HOD.\n\nDr. Schroeder served as president of the Southern California VMA in 1960 and on several committees of the California VMA.\n\nHis other organizational affiliations included chairing the Public Health Committee of the U.S. Livestock Sanitary Association and the Food and Agriculture Committee of the Los Angeles Chapter of the United Nations Association. Dr. Schroeder was an adviser to the board of directors of the Los Angeles County Farm Bureau, a member of the Agriculture Committee of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, an executive committee member of the U.S. Animal Health Association, and a trustee of the Los Angeles Zoo Association. He was active in the Medical Research Association of California.\n\nColorado State University's College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences bestowed its Honor Alumnus Achievement Award on him in 1969. He also received the Extraordinary Service Award from California Regional Medical Programs, a Distinguished Service citation from the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, the Distinguished Award for Veterinary Leadership from the Southern California VMA, and the Distinguished Service Award from the Southern California Alumni chapter of CSU.\n\nDr. Schroeder served his country as a 1st lieutenant in the Paratrooper Field Artillery in World War II and as a 1st lieutenant in the Army Veterinary Corps during the Korean War.\n\nDr. Schroeder and his wife of 65 years, Jan, lived in Downey, Calif., for more than 60 years. After his retirement, they spent more than 25 years indulging their passion for fishing, clamming, crabbing, and camping. They fished their way from the tip of the Baja California peninsula to the coastal shores of Alaska.\n\nHe is survived by his wife; his daughter, Jeri Barry; his sons, Craig Schroeder and Curt Schroeder; five grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.\n\nMemorial donations to the Center for Comparative Medicine may be mailed to the School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California-Davis, P.O.
