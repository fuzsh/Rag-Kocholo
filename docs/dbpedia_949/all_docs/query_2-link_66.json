Manitowoc Herald Times Â– Tuesday, Nov 30, 1999 Â– page A2 ******** (9 Dec 1916/28 Nov 1999/SSDI)\n\nMARY BRENNAN TWO DEAD, SEVEN HURT IN TWO CAR COLLISION Druggist From Clintonville, And Girl, 10, Victims Two person were killed and seven injured late Sunday in a two-car collision at the intersection of Highway 32 and County Trunk M. three miles northwest of Howards Grove. The dead: Allan Harvey Mahnke, 41, a Clintonville druggist and a son-in-law of Mr. and Mrs. Carl Koehler, of Route 4, Sheboygan, and Mary Brennan, 10, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Harold Brennan, of Valders. The injured: (Omitted for privacy.) None of the injured persons was reported critically hurt. The two deathsÂ—the first traffic fatalities in Sheboygan County in more than six weeksÂ—raised the county's 1956 highway death toll to 15. It was the third multiple-death accident of the year. In 1955, when the county had 26 traffic deathsÂ—a record topped only in 1941Â—the county recorded its 21st fatality on the same date. Mahnke, a former Sheboygan area drug salesman, was identified by county traffic officers as the driver of one of the cars involved in the collision. His wife and two of his three sons were en route to their home in Clintonville after a week end visit with the Koehlers in Sheboygan. The Brennan girl was on of the four passengers in the other auto driven by her brother, Douglas Brennan. The other occupants were Brennan's wife and her two sisters, the Enders twins. Most seriously injured in the crash was Mrs. Mahnke who was being treated at Sheboygan Memorial Hospital for possible internal injuries, contusions to the chest and a lacerated right knee. The attending physician described her condition at noon today as Â“fair.Â” Also at Memorial Hospital (Turn to Page 20, Col. 1) were her two sons, both of who sustained lacerations and contusions of the forehead. They were reported in Â“goodÂ” condition. At St. Nicholas Hospital, Mrs. Brennan was reported suffering from a severe concussion, ascleral hemorrhage of the left eye, a fractured jaw, a fracture of the right wrist, discoloration of both eyes, multiple contusions to the chest and a muscle strain to the lower back. Her physician said her condition was Â“fair to good.Â” Describe Injuries Brennan was being treated for shock, probably fractures of four ribs, multiple lacerations of the forehead and face, a deep laceration under the left eye and contusions to his arms and legs. He was reported in Â“goodÂ” condition. Jean Enders was hospitalized with a probable broken collar bone, multiple lacerations of the arms and legs, a lacerated scalp and left knee, and was in a state of Â“mild shock.Â” Her twin sister sustained a Â“severeÂ” concussion, severe contusions of the chest and abdomen, a lacerated lip, possible rib fractures and possible internal injuries. The condition of both girls was described by the attending physician as Â“goodÂ” after x-rays had been taken at the hospital. Dr. Reed M. Simpson, Sheboygan County coroner, attributed the instantaneous deaths of both Mahnke and the Brennan girl to skull fractures. Simpson was expected to confer later today with Sheriff Theodore J. Mosch and Dist. Atty. David Weber to determine whether or not to hold an inquest into the deaths. Hurtled Through Stop Sign Investigating officers said the Brennan car, northbound on County Trunk M, allegedly hurtled through an arterial stop sign at the intersection and ploughed broadside into the Mahnke auto. Questioned at the hospital this morning, Brennan admitted to Traffic Officer Vernon Schauer that he saw the headlights of a car traveling northwest on Highway 23 as he approached the intersection. He told Schauer that he applied his brakes momentarily and then apparently realizing he would be unable to stop, accelerated his speed to beat the Mahnke car across the highway. Schauer, who took measurements at the accident scene, said the point of impact was approximately in the dead center of the state trunk highway. After the crash, he said, the Brennan car caromed off the northwest corner of the intersection, hurdled a ditch, rolled over and landed upright in a farmer's field, 122 feet north of the impact point. The Mahnke auto crashed into a ditch on the west side of County Trunk M and north of Highway 32, about 83 feet north of the crossing. Cars Demolished Both cars were completely wrecked. The Brennan Girl's body was thrown clear of the wreckage. She was found lying near a ditch on the north side of Highway 32, south and east of the Brennan car. Mahnke's body was sprawled on the front seat of the car with the head and shoulders hanging out of the open driver's side of the auto. Schauer said several other occupants of the two cars also were thrown from the vehicles. Investigating officers said that Brennan's viability of Highway 32 was probably impaired by a farm house on the southeast corner of the intersection and a small incline on the state trunk highway east of the crossing. Schauer reported that there is a junction sign and a warning sign of the approaching arterial stop several hundred feet south of the intersection on County Trunk M. The injured were rushed to hospitals in Sheboygan by the Sheboygan Ambulance Service and Rudy's Ambulance less than 20 minutes after the accident. Spectators Gather Scores of spectators gathered at the scene within a few minutes after the crash. Officers Harvey Feld, Fred Godeman and Henry Hoppert were dispatched to direct traffic and keep the highways cleared. The Mahnkes were en route to their home in Clintonville after a week-end visit at the home of Mrs. Mahnke's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Carl Koehler, near Sheboygan. They had arrived in Sheboygan Saturday night, spent the night at the Koehler home and on Sunday drove to Milwaukee to visit Mr. Mahnke's parents. Former Drug Salesman A former pharmaceutical sales representative for Parke-Davis in the Sheboygan area, Mr. Mahnke had lived in Fond du Lac before purchasing a drug store at Clintonville in August 1951. He and his wife had dinner with Mahnke's parents in Milwaukee after purchasing a supply of Christmas merchandise from a pharmaceutical house in Milwaukee. Their two boys spent the days with the Koehlers. On their return from Milwaukee, the Mahnkes had supper at the Koehler home and then left with their two boys on the return trip about 7:30 o'clock. Another son, Steven, 15, was in Racine. The Brennan's were returning to Valders after driving Douglas' younger brother, Gerald, 18, to Lakeland College where he enrolled as a freshman student. Lakeland College is only about two miles south of the accident scene.
