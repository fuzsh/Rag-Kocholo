I grew up in what today is an underserved community, and have felt that we needed more physicians in Idaho, and ICOM is providing that service.\n\n— Dr. Brian Martin, ICOM Associate Professor of Pathology\n\nFor students interested in pursuing research, I would say test the waters, like I did. Especially if you don't know what you want or what you're looking for, take every opportunity — anything that can get you involved.\n\n— Thomas Auen, Class of 2022\n\nResearch is really important. Maybe people haven’t had the greatest introduction to it, but it can be really worthwhile with the right mentor and with a project that you’re passionate about.\n\n— Kate Buhrke, Class of 2022\n\nAcademic medicine dares you to do better, learn more, and to provide the best evidence-based care for your patients. I enjoy new perspectives from medical students, and how it challenges me to examine why I do the things I do.\n\n— Dr. Jessica Ziebarth, ICOM Assistant Professor of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation\n\nI’ve really never worked with a more dedicated, open-minded, and hard-working group of faculty and staff. The anatomy team works hard to make sure our student-doctors are receiving the best anatomy education possible.\n\n— Dr. Blaine Maley, ICOM Chair of Anatomy\n\nI was drawn to ICOM as I could continue to work towards a career I enjoy, while living in the state which I have called home for the past 25 years. The friendliness of the professors and staff when I first stepped foot on campus made ICOM the right choice for me.\n\n— James Wendell, Class of 2022\n\nThe training I’m receiving at ICOM, coupled with the advanced technology found around campus, are giving me the tools to become the doctor I want to become.\n\n— Sarah Placek, Class of 2022\n\nAt ICOM, I’m learning about treatment that goes beyond the symptoms. At the same time, Idaho has a need for physicians, and I’m looking forward to making a difference in the Mountain West region.\n\n— Kiefer Starks, Class of 2022\n\nAs an Idaho native, ICOM instills a deep sense of pride and excitement. I am able to pursue my passion for learning and practicing medicine near my family and friends, in a community that is truly my home.\n\n— Erica Latorre, Class of 2022"
