        "text": "Summary\n\nIn NMT Case 4, U.S.A. v. Pohl et al., Oswald Pohl and seventeen other officials of the SS Economic and Administrative Main Office (Wirtschafts und Verwaltungshauptant, WVHA) were charged with conspiracy to commit war crimes and crimes against humanity, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and membership in a criminal organization. The crimes occurred in the concentration camps and labor camps of the SS in Germany and the occupied territories, which the WVHA managed from 1942 to 1945. According to the prosecution, approximately 10,000,000 persons were imprisoned in these camps. Specific charges included: imprisonment of civilians, nationals of foreign countries, and prisoners of war; exploitation of inmates as laborers; medical experiments conducted on prisoners; extermination of the Jews; sterilization; mistreatment of prisoners of war; euthanasia; and deportation of foreign nationals and plundering of their property. (These charges reflected two different forces in the SS system, which sometimes overlapped and sometimes competed against each other: The program of generating revenue for the SS by exploiting captive labor for profit, and the program of punishing and exterminating those considered enemies of the Nazi state.) Pohl was the chief of the WVHA, with August Frank and Georg Loerner as deputies. The other defendants were officials in the Amtsgruppen and Aemter (office groups and offices) responsible for specific aspects of the concentration camps and related operations of the SS. A few defendants were also charged with responsibility for crimes allegedly committed by their military units while they were on active military duty.\n\nPersons Involved\n\nMilitary Tribunal II\n\nRobert M.
