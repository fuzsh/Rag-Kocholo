When Phils father became very ill, the Delmonaco children had to run the familys tailoring shop, so Phil quit school to help.He always regretted only getting an eighth-grade education, but love is a willing sacrifice.

In 1967, Phil attended St. Marys Church and began talking with a young woman named Rosie.This young woman had often gone to Phils dry cleaning shop with her mother and had had a crush on Phil for many years.In spite of the age difference between Phil and Rosie, they connected and married a year later. Phil and Rosie soon made their home in Indiana and reared two daughters, Theresa and Michelle.Phil advised his daughters to get good educations, and he and Rosie scrimped and saved for many years so that they could put their daughters through college.Although there werent fancy clothes and cars and houses, there was love.Once again, love was a willing sacrifice for Phil. During their golden years, Phil and Rosie lived a quiet life at their home in Indiana.In his mid-eighties, Phil began to experience health issues, including the onset of Alzheimers disease.Rosie loved him dearly, though, and what he couldnt remember, she remembered for him.A caregivers role is a hard one, but love is a willing sacrifice. In July of 2015, Phil became ill and spent several months in and out of the hospital.Rosie always insisted on bringing him home, where he belonged, and Phil fought every day to hold onto life.In November, Phils body began to fail him.As Rosie held his hand during his final hour, she told him, You just go ahead and go if you want to.Love is a willing sacrifice. Phil was preceded in death by his father, Michael, his mother, Gussy, his siblings, Don, Frank, Fritz, Angela, Jack, and Ruth, and by his childhood friend, Jimmy.Phil is survived by his devoted wife and tireless caregiver, Rosie, his loving daughters, Theresa and Michelle, and his two pieces of gold, Cameron and Corey.
