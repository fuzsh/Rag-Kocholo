        "text": "Established by members of the Shih-Pai family, the Dr. Shih I. Pai Lecture Series in Fluid Dynamics and Plasma Dynamics honors Professor Pai's years of dedication to teaching and research. Annual lectures are given by distinguished scholars in the fields of fluid dynamics and plasma dynamics.​​\n\nFung is recognized international for his pioneer studies on the mechanics of living tissues and organs. His work was the first to use the principles of mechanical fluid dynamics to study living tissues and organs and has studied circulation, blood vessels, blood cells, the heart, the lung, the relationship between growth and physical stress, and tissue engineering. Author of several books and hundreds of articles, Dr. Fung is a member of the U.S. Academy of Sciences, the U.S. National Academy of Engineering, and the U.S. Institute of Medicine.\n\nGems at the Border of Physical and Biological Sciences\n\nZierep is a professor emeritus at the University of Karlsruhe, Germany. He is internationally recognized for his foundational studies of gas dynamics, transonic and hypersonic flows, and the shape and structures of shock waves.\n\nDr. Zierep received a doctorate of engineering from the Technical University in Berlin. He has published 157 scientific papers, including fix textbooks, and has supervised 40 doctoral students. Dr. Zierep co-founded the periodical journal Acta Mechanica and has been co-editor since 1965.\n\nHe has been president of the Society for Applied Mathematics and Mechanics (GAMM), 1983-1986; Honorary Professor at Beijing University, 1988; promoted Dr.techn.E.h. by the Technical University of Vienna, 1989 and received the Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany, 1995.\n\nCondensation in Transonic Flow\n\nLi was chairman and founder of Y.T. Li Engineering, Inc.; honorary chairman, treasurer and co-founder of Setra Systems, Zinc. (1965- ), and president and co-founder of Dynisco Inc. (1952-1960). He was professor emeritus of MIT (1947-1979), member of the U.S. National Academy of Engineering, and second president of the National Association of Chinese Americans (1980-1984).\n\nDr. Li received his B.S. from National Beijing University of Technology (1934), M.S. degrees from National Central University in Nanking (1936) and MIT (1938), and his Sc.D. from MIT in 1939.\n\nHe was internationally known for his innovative engineering work and leadership. Dr. Li’s work “Technological Innovation in Education and Industry” (Van Nostrand, 1980) has had significant impact on both engineering practice and national policy. Deceased, 1914-2011.\n\nDeveloping Orbital Rod Evaporator as a Model of Developing Technology-Intensive Industry in China\n\nUsing orbital evaporation to improve the performance of seawater desalination was initially used as an academic exercise in the early Eighties to illustrate the process of innovation and as an example for developing a technology intensive industry in China.\n\nA DOE grant in 1982 was followed by the support of several US companies for biotech applications and the collaboration of the government agencies in mainland China and Taiwan for desalination applications. This effort allowed the author to identify several interesting issues along the path of new product development, but without tangible commercial success.\n\nA breakthrough occurred when the orbital technology was licensed to Paul Mueller Company for thermal energy storage application-making ice at night to be used in the daytime for air-conditioning. That company now enjoys risk sales of their new ORE products in US, Japan and South Korea. Another major US firm, Aqua-Chem, is now developing ORE under license for seawater desalination and waste treatment.\n\nKadanoff was the John D. and Catherine T.

Deceased, 1937-2015.\n\nDrips and Jets: Singularities, Topology Changes, and Scaling\n\nWe investigate the behavior of the interface between two fluids. We are interested in the singularities which develop when a mass of fluid breaks into two. Then there is a bridge connecting two pieces of fluid which goes to zero thickness. Experiments, computer simulations, and theory are used to analyze several different physical situations: a dripping faucet, the pinch-off of a jet flow, two fluids being sucked up by a straw, and a liquid which comes to a sharp point.\n\nHarry L. Swinney (1999)\n\nSwinney is the Sid Richardson Foundation Regents Professor in Physics at the University of Texas at Austin and Director of the Center for Nonlinear Dynamics also at the University of Austin. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Fellow of the American Physical Society, and member of the Johns Hopkins Society of Scholars.\n\nOther honors include:\n\nAmerican Physical Society Fluid Dynamics Prize (1995)\n\nJohn Simon Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship (1983-84)\n\nMorris Loeb Lecturer, Harvard University (1982)\n\nHe received his B.S. degree with Honors from Rhodes College in 1961 and his Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University in 1968.

He was a member of the Technical Staff at Bell Laboratories from 1963 until he joined the University of California at Santa Barbara in 1979.\n\nHis current research interests include: critical phenomena near the superfluid transition of 4He; nonequilibrium phenomena with an emphasis on the problem of pattern formation; spatio-temporal chaos; formation of localized structures or pulses.\n\nFluctuations Near Bifurcations in Systems Far from Equilibrium\n\nIn spatially‑extended nonlinear dissipative systems far from equilibrium, bifurcations are usually discussed in terms of deterministic equations for the macroscopic variables which neglect the microscopic degrees of freedom. An example is the use of the Navier‑Stokes equation for Rayleigh‑Bénard convection (RBC). There is then a sharp bifurcation point R = Rc at which an exchange of stability occurs between the spatially‑uniform state and the state with spatial variation.\n\nSreenivasan is the Harold W.

These galaxies are totally dark matter dominated, so may offer some insights missing from the study of large spirals. They are also important in considerations of modifying Newton’s laws, rather than postulating the existence of dark matter. Deceased, 1928-2016.\n\nThe Universe of Galaxies\n\nEvery civilization, from the time of the earliest humans to the present day, tells stories about the universe. What we know about the universe is dictated in large measure by the available technology. In the last century, we learned that we live in a galaxy of 200 billion stars, that the universe is populated by billions of galaxies, and that galaxies are moving away from each other. Equally important, we now understand that everything evolves: stars are born, evolve, and die; galaxies grow at the expense of smaller galaxies and gas clouds in their neighborhood.\n\nKalnay is a Distinguished University Professor in the Department of Atmospheric Oceanic Science (formerly the Department of Meteorology) and the Institute for Physical Science & Technology, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland; she is also the Eugenia Brin Professor in Data Assimilation at the University.

Charney Award (1995)\n\nU.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration Gold Medal (1981)\n\nShe obtained her undergraduate degree in Meteorology from the University of Buenos Aires (1965) and a Ph.D. in Meteorology from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1971).\n\nHer previous appointments include Director of Environmental Modeling Center of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction, U.S. National Weather Service (1987-1997), and Senior Research Meteorologist and Head, Simulation Branch, Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres, U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (1979-1986).\n\nHer current research interests are: data assimilation and predictability, ensemble Kalman Filtering, coupled ocean-atmosphere modeling, and climate change.\n\nAmidst the Chaos, Good Predictions: How Meteorology Beats the Odds\n\nWe will review ideas of weather predictability, with the Lorenz (1963) discovery of chaos (a name coined by Jim Yorke in 1975). Lorenz concluded that even if we had perfect models of the atmosphere and perfect knowledge of the initial conditions (“except for a butterfly”), we could not predict the weather beyond two weeks. At that time, weather forecasts were useless beyond a day, so this limit on predictability was only of academic interest.\n\nLevin is George M. Moffett professor of Biology in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and Director of the Center for Bio-Complexity at Princeton University.

Block Community Lecture Award (2006)\n\nKyoto Prize in Basic Sciences, Inamori Foundation, Japan (2005)\n\nClay Mathematics Senior Scholar-in-Residence (2005)\n\nA.H. Heineken Prize for Environmental Sciences, Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (2004)\n\nMedallion of the Universite de Montpellier (2004)\n\nHonorary Doctor of Humane Letters Honoris Causa, Whittier College (2004)\n\nHe earned his undergraduate degree in Mathematics from Johns Hopkins University (1961), and Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Maryland (1964).\n\nHis current research interests include: modeling of ecological systems; dynamics of populations and communities; spatial heterogeneity and problem of scale; evolutionary, mathematical and theoretical ecology and evolution of cooperation maintenance of social norms.\n\nThe Challenge of Sustainability: Lessons from an Evolutionary Perspective\n\nThe continual increase in the human population, magnified by increasing per capita demands on Earth’s limited resources, raise the urgent man-date of understanding the degree to which these patterns are sustainable. The scientific challenges posed by this simply stated goal are enormous, and cross disciplines. What measures of human welfare should be at the core of definitions of sustainability, and how do we discount the future and deal with problems of intra-generational and inter-generational equality? How do environmental and socioeconomic systems become organized as complex adaptive systems, and what are the implications for dealing with public goods at scales from the local to the global? How does the increasing inter-connectedness of coupled natural and human systems affect the robustness of aspects of importance to us, and what are the implications for management, what is the role of social norms, and how do we achieve cooperation at the global level? All these issues have parallels in evolutionary biology, and this lecture will explore what lessons can be learned from ecology and evolutionary theory for addressing the problems posed by achieving a sustainable future.\n\nJames A. Yorke (2010)\n\nYorke is Distinguished University Professor of the Departments of Mathematics and Physics and the Institute for Physical Science and Technology at the University of Maryland in College Park, Maryland.

He attained his undergraduate degree with major in Mathematics from Columbia University (1963), and Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Maryland (1966).\n\nHis current research interests include: period-doubling cascades galore; better methods for determining the genetic sequence of large genomes; modeling the population dynamics of HIV; chaos and weather prediction; a mathematical theory of observation; topological horseshoes and other topological phenomena; explosions of chaotic sets as a parameter is varied; tools for the numerical exploration of nonlinear dynamical systems and a physical realization of the Plykin attractor.\n\nChaos\n\nEveryone knows our lives are all chaotic and unpredictable in the long run, and the most successful people are those who are good at plan B. Scientists were probably the last people to find out about chaos. Chaos is an area of science and mathematics that describes situations in which small changes can cascade into larger and larger long-term effects. Chaos is a battle between stability and instability. I will describe phenomena that arise in this battle.\n\nAndreas Acrivos (2011)\n\nAcrivos is Professor Emeritus of Chemical Engineering at Stanford University.

Taylor Medal from the Society of Engineering Science\n\nBingham Medal from the Society of Rheology\n\nHe obtained his B.S. degree from Syracuse University in 1950, his M.S. degree from the University of Minnesota in 1951, and his Ph.D. degree from the University of Minnesota in 1954, all in Chemical Engineering.\n\nAlthough formally retired since 2000, Professor Acrivos remains active professionally and, via the internet, cooperates informally with a number of fluid dynamicists the world over.\n\nThe Rheology of Concentrated Suspensions of Non-Brownian Particles: A Historical Survey of Some Recent Variations on a Theme by Albert Einstein\n\nIn one of his landmark 1905 papers, Albert Einstein published his famous expression for the effective viscosity of a dilute suspension of small, non-Brownian, spheres in viscous Newtonian fluids subject only to hydrodynamic forces, which, over the next half a century, was extended to higher particle concentrations by numerous investigators. Underlying all these studies, however, has been the assumption (taken on faith) that, even at particle concentrations φ beyond the dilute regime, such two-phase materials flow exactly like a Newtonian (isotropic) fluid with its viscosity, relative to that of the suspending liquid, being a unique function of φ.\n\nBeginning in the mid-60’s, however, it was found experimentally that non-dilute suspensions flowed in a manner which, at times, was strikingly different from that of a corresponding Newtonian fluid due, as was eventually realized, to the fact that the chaotic motions of the hydrodynamically interacting particles create both a structure within such suspensions, which renders them anisotropic, as well as a shear-induced non-uniform particle concentration profile that greatly affects their rheology. Several examples of such flows will be presented and discussed which illustrate these effects.\n\nSir Michael Berry (2012)\n\nBerry is Melville Wills Professor of Physics at the University of Bristol. In 1962 he obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Physics with honors from Exeter University. In 1965 he was awarded a Ph.D. in theoretical physics by St. Andrews University. Subsequently, he was awarded a Doctor of Science Degree from Exeter University, an Honorary Professorship at Wuhan University, and Honorary Doctorates at ten other universities. In 1967 Professor Berry joined Bristol University and in succession he has been Lecturer in Physics, Reader in Physics, Professor of Physics, Royal Society Research Professor, and Melville Wills Professor of Physics.\n\nHe has been elected Fellow, Member or Foreign Member of: Royal Society of London, Royal Society of Arts, Royal Institution, Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala, European Academy, Indian Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Science of the USA, London Mathematical Society, The Weizmann Institute, Institute of Physics, Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, Royal Society of Edinburgh, and the Mexican Mathematical Society.\n\nHis prizes include:\n\nMaxwell Model and Prize (Institute of Physics)\n\nJulius Edgar Lilienfeld Prize (American Physical Society)\n\nPaul Dirac Medal and Prize (Institute of Physics)\n\nNaylor Prize (London Mathematical Society)\n\nLouis-Vuitton Moet-Hennessey Science for Art Prize (Paris)\n\nHewlett-Packard Europhysics Prize\n\nDirac Medal and Prize (Intl. Centre for Theoretical Physics, Trieste)\n\nKnight Bachelor Queen’s Birthday Honours (London)\n\nKapitsa Medal (Russian Academy of Sciences), Wolf Prize (Physics)\n\nIgNobel Prize (Physics), Onsager Medal (Norwegian Technical Univ.)\n\n2002 Novartis/Daily Telegraph Visions of Science Competition, Polya Prize (London Mathematical Society)\n\nChancellor’s Medal (University of Bristol)\n\nHamilton’s diabolical singularity\n\nHamilton’s first application of the concept of phase-space – later so fruitful in the transition to quantum physics – was a prediction in optics: conical refraction in biaxial crystals. This created a sensation at the time (1831), probably because it was one of the first successful uses of mathematics to predict a qualitatively new phenomenon. At the heart of conical refraction is a singularity, anticipating the simplest geometric phase and the conical intersections extensively studied in quantum chemistry and now resurrected in graphene. The light emerging from the crystal contains many subtle diffraction details, whose definitive understanding and observation have been achieved only recently. Generalizations of the phenomenon involve radically different mathematical structures, reflecting the different physics of real symmetric, complex hermitian, and nonhermitian two by two matrices that are still being explored theoretically and experimentally.\n\nEllen Williams (2013)\n\nWilliams joined BP as Chief Scientist in January, 2010. She is responsible for supporting the basic science that underpins the company’s technology programs, assessment and research in strategic technology issues and engagement with BP’s university research programs around the world.

In parallel, Ellen has worked extensively in providing technical advice to the U.S. government, primarily through the Departments of Energy and Defense.\n\nEnergy and our other Natural Resources: Minerals, Land, Water and the Atmosphere\n\nEnergy is essential to human civilization, and the production of energy and electrical power intersects other natural resources, specifically minerals, water, land and earth’s atmosphere. Of these resources, the strongest energy linkage is with the atmosphere. However, the growing quality of life for more and more of the world’s population places additional stresses on minerals, land and water, as well as increasing the demand for energy.\n\nIn this talk, we will address the question of whether the growing demand for energy can be sustained in the face of competing pressures on our other natural resources. The trends in GHG emissions, and the technical drivers for resource use, especially water, in energy production will be reviewed. We will show how technical choices available now could prevent some energy-resource collisions, and discuss areas of continuing concern.\n\nLevelt Sengers was born and raised in the Netherlands.

After a series of humiliating defeats, the Chinese leaders realized the need to learn Western industry and military technology. The government thereafter selected top students for training abroad. Many of the scholars, such as Hu Shi and Zhu Kenzhen who came to the U.S. in 1910, made a major impact in China, not only in science and education but also in cultural movement and societal change.\n\nThis lecture will highlight the stories of Professor Shih-I Pai and his contemporaries, who came from China to the U.S. to study in the 1930s and 1940s, and their contributions to both China and the U.S.. This group of scientists included the gifted inventor Yao-Tzu Li, the famous rocket scientist Qian Hsusen and the Nobel laureates Chen-Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee. After the normalization of diplomatic relationships between the U.S. and China in the mid-1970s, there has been tremendous scientific interactions, and many U.S.-trained Chinese scientists have actively contributed to the advancement of science and technology. I will highlight some activities in the biomedical field that I witnessed.\n\nIn conclusion, U.S-trained Chinese scientists contributed greatly to the scientific development in both the U.S. and China and to societal change in China. They continue to benefit not only the U.S. and China, but the entire world.\n\nCarlos J. Bustamante (2016)\n\nBustamante is Professor of Molecular and Cell Biology, Physics, and Chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator.\n\nDr. Bustamante received his B.S. degree in biology from the Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia; his M.S. degree in biochemistry from the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos and his Ph.D. in biophysics from the University of California, Berkeley. Dr. Bustamante’s laboratory develops and applies single-molecule manipulation and detection methods, such as optical tweezers, magnetic tweezers, and single molecule fluorescence microscopy to characterize the dynamics and the mechanochemical properties of various molecular motors that interact with DNA, RNA, or proteins.\n\nHis lab also uses and develops novel methods for superresolution microscopy to study the organization and function of protein complexes in cells.\n\nDr. Bustamante is a Fellow of the American Physical Society, an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences and the Chilean Academy of Science and a member of the Board of Directors of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He is the recipient of the 2012 Raymond and Beverly Sackler International Prize in Biophysics for his seminal contributions to single molecule biophysics.\n\nThe Folding Cooperativity of a Protein is Controlled by the Topology of its Polypeptide Chain\n\nProteins are complex functional molecules that tend to segregate into structural regions. Throughout evolution, biology has harnessed this modularity to carry out specialized roles and regulate higher-order functions such as allostery. Cooperative communication between such protein regions is important for catalysis, regulation, and efficient folding; indeed, lack of domain coupling has been implicated in the formation of fibrils and other misfolding pathologies. How domains communicate and contribute to a protein’s energetics and folding, however, is still poorly understood. Bulk methods rely on a simultaneous and global perturbation of the system (temperature or chemical denaturants) and can miss potential intermediates, thereby overestimating protein cooperativity and domain coupling. I will show that by using optical tweezers it is possible to mechanically induce the selective unfolding of particular regions of single T4 lysozyme molecules and establish the response of regions not directly affected by the force. In particular, I will discuss how the coupling between distinct domains in the protein depends on the topological organization of the polypeptide chain. To reveal the status of protein regions not directly subjected to force, we determined the free energy changes during mechanical unfolding using Crooks’ Fluctuation Theorem. We evaluate the cooperativity between domains by determining the unfolding energy of topological variants pulled along different directions. We show that topology of the polypeptide chain critically determines the folding cooperativity between domains and, thus, what parts of the folding/unfolding landscape are explored. We speculate that proteins may have evolved to select certain topologies that increase coupling between regions to avoid areas of the landscape that lead to kinetic trapping and misfolding.\n\nDanielle S. Bassett (2017)\n\nBassett is Associate Professor and Eduardo D. Glandt Faculty Fellow in the Bioengineering Department at the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Bassett received her B.S. (04) in physics from Pennsylvania State University and her Ph.D. (09) in physics from the University of Cambridge.\n\nDr. Bassett’s research group studies biological, physical, and social systems by using and developing tools from network science and complex systems theory. They are developing analytic tools to probe the hard-wired pathways and transient communication patterns inside the brain in an effort to identify organizational principles, to develop novel diagnostics of disease, and to design personalized therapeutics for rehabilitation and treatment of brain injury, neurological disease, and psychiatric disorders.\n\nDr. Bassett was a postdoctoral associate (09–2011) and a Sage Junior Research Fellow (11–2013) at the University of California, Santa Barbara, before joining the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania. Her scientific papers have appeared in journals such as the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), Neuron, Nature Neuroscience, Physical Review E, Journal of Complex Networks, Journal of Computational Neuroscience and Chaos, among others. In 2014 she became the youngest recipient of the prestigious MacArthur Fellowship.\n\nPerturbation and Control of Human Brain Network Dynamics\n\nThe human brain is a complex organ characterized by heterogeneous patterns of interconnections. New non-invasive imaging techniques now allow for these patterns to be carefully and comprehensively mapped in individual humans, paving the way for a better understanding of how wiring supports our thought processes. While a large body of work now focuses on descriptive statistics to characterize these wiring patterns, a critical open question lies in how the organization of these networks constrains the potential repertoire of brain dynamics.\n\nIn this talk, I will describe an approach for understanding how perturbations to brain dynamics propagate through complex wiring patterns, driving the brain into new states of activity. Drawing on a range of disciplinary tools – from graph theory to network control theory and optimization – I will identify control points in brain networks, characterize trajectories of brain activity states following perturbation to those points, and propose a mechanism for how network control evolves in our brains as we grow from children into adults.\n\nFinally, I will describe how these computational tools and approaches can be used to better understand how the brain controls its own dynamics (and we in turn control our own behavior), but also how we can inform stimulation devices to control abnormal brain dynamics, for example in patients with severe epilepsy.\n\nCharles H. Bennett (2018)\n\nBennett, an IBM Fellow at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, received his B.S. in chemistry from Brandeis University in 1964 and his Ph.D. in the study of molecular dynamics (computer simulations of molecular movements) from Harvard University in 1971.\n\nHe joined IBM's research labs in 1972 where he performed pioneering research in the physics of information processing, and in fundamental quantum mechanics. Building on the work of IBM’s Rolf Landauer, he showed that general-purpose computation can be performed by a logically and thermodynamically reversible apparatus. In collaboration with Gilles Brassard, Université de Montréal, he developed a system of quantum cryptography, known as BB84, which allows secure communication between parties who share no secret information initially, based on the uncertainty principle.\n\nBennett and Brassard, with collaborators, discovered “quantum teleportation,” an effect in which the complete information in an unknown quantum state is decomposed into purely classical information and purely non-classical Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) correlations, sent through two separate channels, and later reassembled in a new location to produce an exact replica of the original quantum state that was destroyed in the sending process.\n\nBennett and colleagues. helped found the quantitative theory of entanglement and introduced several techniques for faithful transmission of classical and quantum information through noisy channels, part of the larger and recently very active field of quantum information and computation theory.\n\nBennett is the recipient of the Rank Award for Optoelectronics; Harvey Prize; Okawa Prize; Dirac Medal and the Wolf Prize in Physics. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and Fellow of the American Physical Society.\n\nOccam's Razor, Boltzmann's Brain, and Wigner's Friend\n\nIsmael, Professor of Philosophy at Columbia University, received her Ph.D. from Princeton University, was a Mellon Fellow at Stanford, and taught at the University of Arizona before joining Columbia University in 2018.\n\nIsmael's research focuses on the philosophy of physics and metaphysics, especially areas involving the structure of space and time, quantum mechanics, and the foundations of physical laws. She has published on such issues as the conflict between lived experience and physics, the implications of physics on issues of freedom, death, the nature of the self, and the problem of free will.\n\nIsmael has held a number of prestigious fellowships, including an NEH fellowship at the National Humanities Center, a Queen Elizabeth II Research Fellowship from the Australian Research Council, and fellowships from the Templeton Foundation and CASBS (Center for Advanced Studies in Behavioral Science at Stanford). She is a member of the Foundational Questions Institute.\n\nInformation, Time, and Life\n\nThe differences between past and future frame every aspect of our experience of the world. It is a remarkable fact that research that began in the mid-nineteenth century and was originally focused on trying to derive the phenomenological asymmetries embodied in the second law of thermodynamics from the time-symmetric laws of classical mechanics turned into a very general account of the sources of temporal asymmetry in our world. So a conversation that started by being about why (for example) gas will disperse to fill an open container, turned into a conversation about why we remember the past but not the future, why time seems to flow from past to future, and why we can affect the future but not the past.\n\nThere is much that remains to be understood, but we can assemble the pieces that we have into a picture that has intelligible contours and gives us deep insight not only into the nature of time, but the asymmetries that structure living processes, and our own place in the universe. I’ll sketch the elements of this picture in broad strokes, highlighting the role of information.\n\nAlán Aspuru-Guzik (2020)\n\nAlán Aspuru-Guzik is a professor of Chemistry and Computer Science at the University of Toronto since July 1st, 2018.

He is an elected member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).\n\nAspuru-Guzik received his B.Sc. from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in 1999 and obtained a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley in 2004.\n\nWhere Computational Science Meets Experiment: Self-Driving Laboratories for Materials Discovery\n\nTo face the challenges of the 21st century, modern society requires the rapid discovery of better advanced and structural materials. These, in turn, can help alleviate needs of several sectors that range from health to energy to the environment. Scientific progress is relatively slow in comparison to the timescale of the problems at hand. It is widely recognized that we need to undertake massive immediate action in the timescale of a decade to enable a transition to a sustainable economy and energy systems to avoid catastrophic problems related to climate change. The current COVID19 crisis underscores the much-needed agility to solve problems that relate to molecules and materials in the area of health. Our laboratory's current research aims to accelerate scientific discovery by integrating several disciplines that used to collaborate with each other, but that in our opinion now should merge into a new field of accelerated science. These disciplines include traditional chemistry and materials science, artificial intelligence, data science, analytical and physical chemistry, and robotics. By concentrating on the workflow of scientific discovery and optimization, the concept of a materials acceleration platform or self-driving lab emerges. In this talk, I will describe the components of these platforms and our own efforts to either build them in our laboratory or collaborate with others. I will describe examples in the areas of organic materials and process optimization for the production of pharmaceuticals.\n\nVideo recording for this Zoom Webinar\n\nHui Cao (2021)\n\nHui Cao is the John C.

Yakovlev.\n\nCao received her B.S. in Physics from Peking University in 1990, her M.A. from Princeton in 1992 and her Ph.D. from Stanford in 1997.\n\nStructural Color - Origin and Evolution in Nature\n\nStructural color originates from physical interaction of light with nanostructures. Most studies so far have focused on ordered structures which produce iridescent colors that change with viewing angle. However, nature has used extensively quasi-ordered structures to create weakly iridescent colors. An interdisciplinary team, consisting of optical physicists, material scientists, and biologists at Yale, has investigated the physical mechanism for coloration of nanostructures with short-range order in bird feather barbs. Inspired by nature, a simple technique is developed to fabricate large-scale biomimetic films which display isotropic structural color, that is amenable to potential applications in coatings, cosmetics, and textiles. In order to understand how the structural color evolves in nature, artificial selection has been conducted on a lab model butterfly to evolve the structural color of wing scales and compared to natural selection. This study reveals the physical mechanism of structural color evolution, which stands in sharp contrast to pigment color evolution.\n\nVideo recording for this Zoom Webinar\n\nCristina Marchetti (2022)\n\nCristina Marchetti joined the faculty at Syracuse University in 1987, after postdoctoral appointments at the University of Maryland, Rockefeller University and City College of CUNY. In 2018 she joined the physics faculty at the University of California Santa Barbara.\n\nMarchetti's research focuses on collective behavior in condensed matter and biological systems. Recently she has played a leading role in the development of the field of active matter. The active matter paradigm is relevant to phenomena on many scales, from the control of human crowds to the collective migration of epithelial cells in wound healing. It has additionally paved the way to the development of synthetic analogues that may serve as the base for the development of materials with life-like functions. Marchetti's research has shown that some of this complex behavior can be understood in terms of minimal models based on physical interaction and local rules. She has demonstrated that active systems spontaneously aggregate in the absence of any attractive interactions and has quantified the interplay of activity and topological effects in driving self-sustained flows in active liquid crystals. Her group is currently applying active matter ideas to problems in developmental biology.\n\nMarchetti is a Fellow of the American Physical Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences. She has served on elected positions within the American Physical Society, including chair of GSNP and of GSOFT and as member-at-large of DCMP. She was awarded a Rotschild-Mayent Fellowship at the Institut Curie, a Simons Fellowship in Theoretical Physics, and the inaugural 2019 Leo P. Kadanoff Prize by the American Physical Society for \"original contributions to equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, including profound work on equilibrium and driven vortex systems, and fundamental research and leadership in the growing field of active matter.\"\n\nMarchetti earned her Laurea in Physics cum laude from the University of Pavia, Italy in 1978 and her Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida in 1982.\n\nThe Physics of Active Matter\n\nStructural color originates from physical Birds flock, bees swarm and fish school. These are just some of the remarkable examples of collective behavior found in nature. Physicists have been able to capture some of this behavior by modeling organisms as \"flying spins\" that align with their neighbors according to simple but noisy rules. Successes like these have spawned a field devoted to the physics of active matter – matter made not of atom and molecules but of entities that consume energy to generate their own motion and forces. Through interactions, collectives of such active particles organize in emergent structures on scales much larger than that of the individuals. There are many examples of this spontaneous organization in both the living and non-living worlds: motor proteins orchestrate the organization of genetic material inside cells, swarming bacteria self-organize into biofilms, epithelial cells migrate collectively to fill in wounds, engineered micro-swimmers self-assemble to form smart materials. In this lecture I will introduce the field of active matter and highlight ongoing efforts by physicists, biologists, engineers and mathematicians to model the complex behavior of these systems, with the goal of identifying universal principles.\n\nCharles W. Clark (2023)\n\nCharles W. Clark is a retired career employee of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a NIST Fellow Emeritus, Affiliate of the Institute for Physical Science and Technology and Adjunct Professor and Fellow, Joint Quantum Institute, University of Maryland at College Park (UMCP).

Among other recognitions, he received the Distinguished Presidential Rank Award of the U.S. Senior Executive Service. He earned a B.A. in Mathematics and Physics magna cum laude from Western Washington State College in 1974 and Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Chicago in 1979, under the supervision of Ugo Fano.\n\nGeneration, Detection and Application of Twisted Waves of Light and Neutrons\n\nIt was about 50 years ago today, when \"Dislocations in wave trains\" came into play. Twenty years on, \"Dislocations\" became a nineties hit following the ingenious experiments of Soskin et al., that showed the promise of applications of twisted or structured light with non-vanishing orbital angular momentum about its propagation axis. Modern use cases for such modalities include increased communication bandwidth for 6G applications. Quantum particle beams can also be shaped by analogue tools of optics. I shall present recent results for neutrons, made possible by microfabricated synthetic holograms containing millions of forked dislocation gratings of the type envisaged by Soskin, et al."
