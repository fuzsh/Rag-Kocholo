Luke was born May 28, 1982, in Green Bay, to Wesley Zimmerman and Claire (Denissen) Dombrowski. He was a graduate of Luxemburg-Casco High School, Class of 2000.\n\nLuke is survived by his mother, Claire (Denissen) and Richard B. Dombrowski Jr., who filled the role of his absent biological father and treated Luke as his own child since Luke was in the third grade. He is further survived by his brother, Leonardo C. Zimmerman, Green Bay; and his two stepsisters, Brooke M. Dombrowski, Green Bay; and Toni L. Dombrowski, Little Suamico.\n\nAlso surviving are maternal grandfather, Alfred Denissen, Green Bay; uncles and aunts, Michael and Rose Denissen, Robert and Christine Belport, Green Bay; Scott and Linda Denissen, Kentucky; Dean and Julie Hoegger, Sturgeon Bay; Kurt and Monica Denissen, Milwaukee; Donald and Katherine Brosig, Green Bay; loving cousins, and stepgrandmother, Rosemary Gagnon, Green Bay.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his maternal grandmother, Mary Denissen, and paternal grandmother, Patricia Zimmerman.\n\nLuke loved his family and was immensely proud of being in the U.S. Marine Corps. He always was so full of energy and pep, so kind and willing to help, share, and just goof off. He enjoyed his time just being Luke, from his video games, to his little corny trinkets, to all his activities outside the home.\n\nHe lettered in wrestling, track and cross country. Going to team state with his wrestling pals and also medaling in track at La Crosse with his exceptional relay teams. He also gave football a shot in his underclassman year and completed the season dutifully because quitting mid-season was not an accepted option (even though it wasn't his forte).\n\nLuke worked tirelessly at Julie's Cafe all the while engaged in a full slate of extra-curricular sports. He never complained and rarely, if ever, missed his work assignment.\n\nLuke was so committed to the Marine Corps that he made his mind up in the seventh grade. He joined the program for early enlistment and left almost immediately after graduation. He re-enlisted after his first four-year tour. He enjoyed his job at the U.S. Embassy in Austria. He then had 18 months left to serve while stationed at Quantico, Va., but wasn't able to accept other Marines doing what he felt Marines were supposed to do. So he selflessly volunteered to join the unit that was going to be deployed to Iraq. Luke enlisted in the infantry and expected to be a warrior, and wanted to live up to the standards of a man and a Marine. We believe he achieved those milestones. Luke was passionately known as \"the mule\" by his Marine comrades, and those who personally knew him can relate to that. Luke and his family kept all service members, and especially U.S. Marines, as equals. No one Marine was esteemed over another (maybe Chesty).\n\nLuke was so proud to have received his Combat Action Ribbon and his Iraqi Campaign Service Medal. In addition to being decorated with a Purple Heart, Luke's service ribbons included the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal with one star in lieu of a second award, War on Terrorism Service Medal, Navy Unit Commendation Navy/Marine Corps and the Navy Sea Service Deployment Ribbon with three Bronze Star Devices and the National Defense Service Medal.\n\nLuke's parents and brother were blessed by the Lord to have him for 24-plus years. When notified, one of his mother's biggest worries was if other Marines got injured. Luke's parents would like to attempt to thank Steve and Julie Metzler and their sons, Scott, Troy, Greg and Eric for almost unofficially \"adopting\" Luke. They spent countless times with their buddy and co-worker. Luke loved, \"The Metzlers\" and the feeling was unequivocally reciprocal.\n\nSpecial thanks also to Captain T.M. Mitchell, U.S.M.C. and Corporal Stigsell for doing an exceptional job in assisting Luke's mom with what the Marines do best  taking care of their own. Semper Fidelis. Pastor William Kamke and the parishioners of the Robinsonville Presbyterian Church of New Franken have been so kind, compassionate and accommodating.\n\nFriends may call at Proko-Wall Funeral Home, 1630 E. Mason St., on Friday from 3 to 8 p.m. Visitation will continue on Saturday at Robinsonville Presbyterian Church, corner of Doris Road and County Road K, from 9 a.m. until the time of service. Funeral service 10:30 a.m. at the church with Pastor William Kamke officiating. Fittingly, Sergeant ZIMMERMAN, Luke J., U.S.M.C. will be laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery, marking the last chapter in a noble young man's life. Affirmative, over and out.\n\nIn lieu of other expressions of sympathy, a memorial fund has been established in Luke's name. Please direct your donations to the Luke Zimmerman Scholarship fund, Bank of Luxemburg, Box 440 Luxemburg, WI 54217.\n\nPosted November 1, 2006\n\nZirbel, Gerald Albert \"Jerry\"\n\nGerald Albert \"Jerry\" Zirbel, 62, Green Bay, passed away unexpectedly on Oct. 30, 2006.

He became an English teacher in the Appleton School district and was currently teaching at Einstein Middle School. While teaching, Todd instilled a passion for writing and poetry in his students. The kids at Einstein Middle School adored Todd's Poetry Cafe where they shared their own creative writings and explored modern song lyrics while surrounded by lava lamps and Christmas lights.\n\nIn addition to teaching, Todd expressed his creative talents through his devotion to gardening as well as his prized koi ponds. The countless hours spent in his yard gave Todd great pleasure. Todd also shared an interest in antiquing which at times became a competitive game with Heidi while searching for treasures at estate sales and flea markets. Together they enjoyed travel, the arts and spending time with their dogs.\n\nTodd ended his battle with Leukemia on October 3l, 2006. He was 41 years young. Todd will be forever remembered by his family, friends and those whose lives he touched.\n\nA celebration of Todd's life will be held on Wednesday, November 8, at the Grand Meridian located at 2621 North Oneida Street in Appleton.

Zimmerman, 24, Luxemburg, was killed on Friday, October 27, 2006, in Iraq.\n\nLuke was born May 28, 1982, in Green Bay, to Wesley Zimmerman and Claire (Denissen) Dombrowski. He was a graduate of Luxemburg-Casco High School, Class of 2000.\n\nLuke is survived by his mother, Claire (Denissen) and Richard B. Dombrowski Jr., who filled the role of his absent biological father and treated Luke as his own child since Luke was in the third grade. He is further survived by his brother, Leonardo C. Zimmerman, of Green Bay; and his two stepsisters, Brooke M. Dombrowski, Green Bay; and Toni L. Dombrowski, Little Suamico. Also surviving are maternal grandfather, Alfred Denissen, Green Bay; uncles and aunts, Michael and Rose Denissen, Robert and Christine Belport, Green Bay; Scott and Linda Denissen, Kentucky; Dean and Julie Hoegger, Sturgeon Bay; Kurt and Monica Denissen, Milwaukee; Donald and Katherine Brosig, Green Bay; loving cousins; and stepgrandmother, Rosemary Gag-non, Green Bay.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his maternal grandmother, Mary Denissen; and paternal grandmother, Patricia Zimmerman.\n\nLuke loved his family and was immensely proud of being in the U.S. Marine Corps. He always was so full of energy and pep, so kind and willing to help, share, and just goof off. He enjoyed his time just being Luke, from his video games, to his little corny trinkets, to all his activities outside the home. He lettered in wrestling, track and cross country, going to Team State with his wrestling pals and also medaling in track at La Crosse with his exceptional relay teams. He also gave football a shot in his underclassman year and completed the season dutifully because quitting mid-season was not an accepted option (even though it wasn't his forte').\n\nLuke worked tirelessly at Julie's Caf, all the while engaged in a full slate of extra-curricular sports. He never complained and rarely, if ever, missed his work assignment. Luke was so committed to the Marine Corps that he made his mind up in the seventh grade. He joined the program for early enlistment and left almost immediately after graduation. He re-enlisted after his first four-year tour. He enjoyed his job at the U.S. Embassy in Austria. He then had 18 months left to serve while stationed at Quantico, Va., but wasn't able to accept other Marines doing what he felt Marines were supposed to do. So he selflessly volunteered to join the unit that was going to be deployed to Iraq. Luke enlisted in the infantry and expected to be a warrior and wanted to live up to the standards of a man and a Marine. We believe he achieved those milestones. Luke was passionately known as \"the mule\" by his Marine comrades, and those who personally knew him can relate to that. Luke and his family kept all service members, and especially U.S. Marines as equals. No one Marine was esteemed over another (maybe Chesty). Luke was so proud to have received his Combat Action Ribbon and his Iraqi Campaign Service Medal. In addition to being decorated with a Purple Heart, Luke's service ribbons included the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal with one star in lieu of a second award, War on Terrorism Service Medal, Navy Unit Commendation Navy/Marine Corps and the Navy Sea Service Deployment Ribbon with three Bronze Star Devices, and the National Defense Service Medal.\n\nLuke's parents and brother were blessed by the Lord to have him for 24-plus years. When notified, one of his mother's biggest worries was if other Marines got injured. Luke's parents would like to attempt to thank Steve and Julie Metzler and their sons, Scott, Troy, Greg and Eric, for almost unofficially \"adopting\" Luke. They spent countless times with their buddy and co-worker. Luke loved \"The Metzlers\" and the feeling was unequivocally reciprocal. Special thanks also to Captain T.M. Mitchell, U.S.M.C. and Corporal Stigsell for doing an exceptional job in assisting Luke's mom with what the Marines do best - taking care of their own. Semper Fidelis. Pastor William Kamke and the parishioners of the Robinsonville Presbyterian Church of New Franken have been so kind, compassionate and accommodating.\n\nFriends may call at Proko-Wall Funeral Home, Green Bay, on Friday, November 4, from 3 to 8 p.m. Visitation will continue on Saturday at Robinsonville Presbyterian Church, corner of Doris Rd. and Cty.

She was the last of \"the Martin girls,\" strong, independent and Irish. She was born on September 7, 1909, in Green Bay, Wisconsin, to Joseph and Mildred (Wright) Martin. She was educated at St. Joseph Academy and Rosary College, where the Prohibition \"Gin Joints\" of Greater Chicago, especially Cicero, Illinois, held more interest than her studies. She was the genuine article, a \"flapper,\" and remained one until the end. In 1934, she married Dr. Edward J. Lefebvre. His 1946 cancer diagnosis led to a decade of struggle and sadness. She was widowed in 1956. Her Irish spirit, her strength, her determination never to complain enabled her to enter the work force, to care for her children and to create great friendships. She enjoyed a distinguished career with the Green Bay Board of Education, retiring in 1971. She instilled in her children a work ethic, a sense of history and a love for language and literature. She also played a mean game of bridge with the same group of women for more than 40 years. She was the toughest player at the table, her cards, her cigarettes and her brandy at her side, her stories animating the evenings. She was the real deal. She was an affectionate mother and grandmother whose love of monkeys delighted everyone. With her grandchildren, she set the pace, playing Candyland to win.\n\nJean is survived by her son Mark (Marian) of Madison, Wisconsin; a daughter Julie (Robert) of Paughquat, New York, many grandchildren and great-grandchildren, in particular, Elizabeth Wright Lefebvre and Daniel Martin Lefebvre whose home and cats she shared for years. She is also survived by the Lefebvre nieces and nephews and one Martin nephew, James Delaney.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her parents; her sisters, Mildred, Florence and Helen; her husband; her beloved son, Steven, who died in 2005; and two grandsons, Steven and Joseph Mirsberger. She was also preceded in death by her lifelong friend, Bernadine Neuman Vander Zanden. They grew up together, married college roommates and were pals in the way bright, funny, independent women of their generation could be.\n\nJean will be buried with her family in Allouez Cemetery. At her request, there will be no funeral. There will be a brief graveside service on Saturday, November 11, 2006, at 11:00 a.m. She is now back in the old neighborhood where she began her amazing journey. May choirs of angels sing thee to thy rest, Nonnie. The family would like to thank the entire staff of Greenway Manor who so wonderfully cared for Jean since the day she entered their community in 1999.\n\nMemorials in Jean's memory, to advance medical research, can be made to the University of Wisconsin Foundation, 1848 University Avenue, Madison, Wisconsin 53726.\n\nPosted November 9, 2006\n\nMura, Raymond A. \"Ray\"\n\nRaymond A. \"Ray\" Mura, 79, Green Bay, died Tuesday, Nov. 7, 2006, at his home.
