Dates and identities are made to the best of our abilities, using the Naval Academy Archives and members of the U.S. Naval Academy Band Alumni Association as references. If you have photos you'd consider lending, additions, or corrections to any captions, please contact our Public Affairs Office.\n\nThe History of the United States Naval Academy Band\n\nOriginally prepared by Master Chief Musician (Ret) David Hanner and Master Chief Musician (Ret) Jim Cunningham.\n\nThe United States Naval Academy Band is the oldest band in the United States Navy, the third oldest active duty military band in America, and one of the oldest professional musical organizations in the country. The band was officially founded on November 22, 1852; however, instrumental music on the Naval Academy Yard can be traced back to the establishment of the Naval Academy in 1845.\n\nWilliam Hoeke and Tommy Diggins were two of the first Marine Musicians who served during the Academy's early years, but their replacements, John Jarvis (drummer) and William Bealer (fifer), are the most remembered due to their many years at the Academy. The fifer and drummer signaled reveille, tattoo, morning roll call, assembly, meals, morning and evening studies, and sick call.\n\nThe new Naval School didn't wait long to host its first social event. On January 15, 1846, just three months after the school opened, a naval ball was held. Arrangements were made for the United States Marine Band to travel from Washington D.C. to Annapolis by barge to provide music for the event. Midshipman Charles Hunter, who was on duty that day, recorded the band's arrival in the Officer of the Day Journal: \"The U.S. Marine Band arrived from Washington and reported for duty.\"\n\nIn 1848, Professor Henry Lockwood, instructor in natural philosophy, commanded the Academy's first dress parade, but there was as yet no band. Local civilian musicians were hired for the social occasions, and the fife and drum provided the martial music. Commander Cornelius K. Stribling became Superintendent in 1850, and the Naval School was placed under the control of the Bureau of Ordnance and Hydrography, and renamed The United States Naval Academy. Stribling was advised by the Board of Examiners to provide a source of recreation for the midshipmen and \"a more rigid observance of those Military forms and ceremonies, which are so essential in the order and discipline of the Navy.\"\n\nOn November 10, 1852, John Pendleton Kennedy, Secretary of the Navy, wrote a letter to Commodore Charles Morris, Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance and Hydrography, requesting a plan for the establishment of a band at the Naval Academy. Commodore Morris issued an order on November 22, 1852, authorizing for the Naval Academy, \"a band of music to consist of one master of the band at $18.00 per month, six musicians at $12.00 per month and five at $10.00 per month.\" The person chosen to organize the new unit was John Philip Pfeiffer, a former Navy Musician and Bandmaster of considerable reputation. All the musicians selected were enlisted on board the Receiving Ship \"OHIO\" and by May 10, 1853, transferred from the \"OHIO\" to the barque \"UNION\" to sail to Annapolis.\n\nOn May 17, 1853, Midshipman Edwin H. Dooley documented the band's arrival in the Naval Academy OOD Journal: \"At 7:30 the barque 'UNION' came to anchor in the harbor, having onboard a 'Band' for the Academy.\" The first band members included: John P. Pfeiffer, Robert Haas, John G. Pfeiffer, O. Pillarty, L. (S) Reuther (Reuter), Rudn, Stelezer, Strutton, Henry Vierling, Weitzel, and Wurth (Wirth). At the request of Commander Stribling, Superintendent USNA, one of the band's first performances occurred during the Secretary of the Navy's visit to the yard on October 29, 1853: \"The band will be present to receive the Secretary of the Navy and will be ready to play when directed.\" On May 17, 1860, Secretary of the Navy increased the membership of the band to fourteen members.\n\nAt the beginning of the Civil War, the upper class midshipmen were sent to sea, and the rest of the Naval Academy was transferred to Newport, Rhode Island. The remaining midshipmen sailed to Newport, Rhode Island on the USS CONSTELLATION. The faculty and staff (including the band members) were sent to Newport on the BALTIC. Soon after the band arrived in Newport, E-flat Cornetist Charles Hammer replaced Pfeifer as bandleader. Hammer served as leader for only three months and was replaced by G. J. Meyer. In 1863, William F. Marshall replaced Meyer and served until his enlistment expired in 1865. Under his leadership, the band membership increased to include fifteen members, all brass players. Marshall was the first bandleader not listed as an instrumentalist.\n\nPeter Schoff, a former U.S. Calvary Master Sergeant who served as a bandmaster during the civil war, was hired to replace him. On July 1, 1865, Naval Academy Band members were transferred to the civil list of Academy personnel. Band members were to be paid from the appropriated funds of the Academy instead of the regular pay of the Navy. The new \"Rate of Pay\" allowed $528.00 per year for the bandmaster, $346.00 per year for 1st class musicians and $300.00 per year for the 2nd class musicians. Band members who desired to leave the employment of the Academy were required to find their own replacements. Academy officials offered Bandmaster Schoff the same pay that he received in the U.S. Calvary; however, the bandmaster's authorized new \"Rate of Pay\" fell short each month by $36.00. To make up the shortfall in the appropriated money for the band, each midshipmen was assessed 50 cents per month and officers $1.00 each month. Any money left over after paying the bandmaster was divided up equally with all the band members including the bandmaster. The musicians referred to this extra pay as \"hop money\".\n\nIn preparation for the transfer of the Academy back to Annapolis, Bandmaster Schoff was ordered by the Superintendent to box all the band music and equipment. On August 7, 1865, the band boarded the USS Memphis with the Academy Staff, Faculty, and Superintendent, along with their families, and left for Annapolis. The \"Memphis\" arrived in Annapolis Harbor just three days later. With the Academy back in Annapolis, the new Superintendent, Vice Admiral David Dixon Porter, set about transforming every aspect of Academy life, including the band. On October 14, 1865, Secretary of the Navy Gideon Wells wrote Superintendent Porter authorizing the Academy to increase the size of the band to include \"twenty-two musicians, two snare drummers, one bass drummer, one cymbal player and one triangle player.\"\n\nSince its inception, uniforms for the band had been the standard dark blue union frock coat with fourteen buttons, light blue pants with union kepi hat. VADM Porter designed a new uniform for the band that added red facings, plumed hat, white epaulets, and a white leather sword belt with sword. Park Benjamin, Class of 1867, mentioned in his famous history of the Naval Academy what a grand impression the new band uniform had made with members of the brigade of midshipmen.\n\n\"Even the band, which hitherto had been a small, dispirited collection of serious individuals attired in coats of ecclesiastical cut, turned up with dingy red, and which had a dreadful habit of inciting incipient mutiny by its insistence in playing some one tune, became under Porter's magic touch greatly increased in numbers, and, headed by a drum major, swung down before the line on parade in a way that aroused the delighted admiration of every youngster in the battalion.\"\n\nThe drum major mentioned was Andrew Denver, called \"Old Denver,\" who was appointed Watchman on August 22, 1856, and then promoted to \"Captain of the Watch\" on April 4, 1859. He also served as the band's drum major until the 1870's. The uniform that he wore was an impressive costume that was crowned with an enormous roped bearskin hat.\n\nCommodore John Worden became Superintendent on December 1, 1869, and the first Farewell Ball, Midshipmen Color Competition, Color Parade, and Color Girl Ceremony were all initiated during his tenure. The Secretary of the Navy authorized a housing allowance of eight dollars per month for musicians not having quarters within the grounds of the academy on February 10, 1871. The frequency of hops and balls increased, as it was thought they had a very refining influence upon the young gentlemen. Much importance was also placed on military drill, and dress parades became a daily occurrence; even graduation exercises resembled a dress parade. This much activity around the yard created an interest in the institution and prompted quite a few visits from many prominent individuals from Washington D.C. and Baltimore. The exposure to influential people created an awareness and familiarity of the Academy and its resources.\n\nAs the nation prepared to celebrate the centennial in Philadelphia, several members of congress contacted the Secretary of the Navy, George M. Robeson, to request a performance of the band from the Naval Academy. The band would accompany the Columbia Commandery No. 2 of the Knights Templar of Washington D.C. for a parade on May 30, 1876, in Philadelphia. America's Centennial Exposition attracted over six million visitors, and the \"Parade of the Knights Templar\" drew over seven hundred participants, many bands, and thousands of visitors. During this period, woodwind instrumentalists again performed with the band. The piccolo, flute, oboe, E- flat clarinet, B-flat clarinet, saxophone, and bassoon all appeared, and by October 1883, the band included fifteen woodwinds. On March 4, 1881, the band accompanied the Brigade of Midshipmen to march in President Garfield's inaugural parade. Four years later, the band returned to Washington D.C. to participate in the dedication ceremony of the Washington Monument on February 21, 1885. On March 4,1885, the band marched in Grover Cleveland's Inaugural Parade.\n\nUpon Peter Schoff's retirement on March 1, 1887, Charles Adams Zimmermann became the sixth bandmaster at the Naval Academy. At age 26, he is still the youngest person to become leader of the Naval Academy Band. Joining the band as a 3rd Cornetist on July 1, 1882, he also performed on the violin and cello. For three years prior to joining the Navy, he attended the Peabody Institute of Music in Baltimore (the city of his mother's birth), and is considered a distinguished graduate of that institution. Zimmermann's father had been a band member since June 20, 1859, and Charles Zimmermann was born while the band was stationed with the Naval Academy in Newport, R.I. He was a musician of exceptional ability. Not only did he direct the band, but he also led the Midshipmen choir and started the Midshipmen theatrical club \"The Masqueraders.\" Additionally, he played the organ at St. Mary's Catholic Church in Annapolis.\n\nAbove is a silent movie clip of Theodore Roosevelt's inauguration on March 4, 1905 in Washington, D.C., with the Band and Brigade of Midshipmen.\n\nCourtesy of The Library of Congress.\n\nDuring his career, he dedicated a march for many of the graduating classes at the Academy. His work with the Midshipmen was so much appreciated that the class of 1889 presented him with a gold and ebony baton. Following their lead, the classes of 1892, 1893, 1894, 1895, 1896, 1897, 1899, 1901, 1902, 1905, 1908, 1909, and 1911 each presented him with a gold medal. He led the band in many performances on the Academy grounds and toured with the band up and down the Eastern Seaboard, including performances at the Willow Grove Park (1904), Princeton University, Maryland Agricultural College, Deer Park Hotel, Oakland Hotel, Pen-Mar Resort, Cape May Resort, and the Natural Bridge Resort. Conducting a 120-piece dance orchestra for the Grover Cleveland Inaugural Ball (March 4, 1893) in the Pension Building in Washington, D.C. gained Zimmermann national recognition.\n\nThe following year, in 1894, an order was issued prescribing the scarlet coat, blue pants, and spiked helmet of the standard Marine Corps uniform for all Navy Musicians, including the Naval Academy Band. By 1898, Fleet Navy Bands had done away with the high-maintenance but impressive Marine Uniform, but the Naval Academy Band continued to wear it until 1925. When bandmaster Francesco Fanciulli of the US Marine Band, Washington, D.C., was dismissed in 1897, Zimmermann was offered the prestigious position. Both Colonel Charles Heywood, Commandant of the Marine Corps, and Theodore Roosevelt, Assistant Secretary of the Navy, worked to bring Zimmermann to Washington, D.C. The event was a major news story for the Washington Post during that year, and in the end, Zimmermann declined the position and remained in Annapolis.\n\n1903 marked the closure of the U.S. Navy School of Music in Norfolk, Virginia, and seventeen active duty Navy Musicians from the school were transferred to the Naval Academy to augment the Naval Academy Band, including Bandmaster Pasqual DeSantis. For seven years, Zimmermann had to mold this mixture of civilian and regular navy personnel into a cohesive unit, while administering a dual set of standards in areas such as outside employment, disciplinary action, retirement and medical benefits.\n\nMidshipman First Class Alfred Hart Miles approached Zimmermann with a request for a new march. Miles, a member of the Midshipmen Choir and the Class of 1907, told Zimmermann that he and his classmates \"were eager to have a piece of music that would be inspiring, one with a swing to it so that it could be used as a football marching song, and one that would live forever.\" Supposedly, with the two men seated at the chapel organ, Zimmermann composed the tune and Miles set the title and wrote two stanzas. This march was played by the band and sung by the brigade at the 1906 Army-Navy football game, and for the first time since 1900, Navy won. This march was \"Anchors Aweigh,\" which was subsequently dedicated to the class of 1907 and is widely accepted as the song of the U.S. Navy. Click to read more about \"Anchors Aweigh.\"\n\nApproved by congress on April 12, 1910:\n\n\"Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, The Naval Academy Band shall consist of one leader, who shall have the pay and allowances of a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps; one second leader, with the rate of fifty dollars per month, twenty-nine musicians, first class, and eleven musicians, second class; and shall be paid from \"Pay of the Navy.\" \"Sec. 2. That the members of the Naval Academy Band as now organized shall be enlisted in the navy and credited with all prior service of whatever nature as members of said band, as shown by the records of the Naval Academy and the pay rolls of the ships and academy; and the said leader and the enlisted musicians of the band shall be entitled to the same benefits in respect to pay, emoluments, service as are, or may hereafter become, applicable to other enlisted men of the navy: Provided, that no back pay shall be allowed to the leader or to any member of said band by reason of the passage of this act.\"\n\nThe midshipmen prepared a special tribute in the 1916 Lucky Bag (year book), recognizing Zimmermann's years of devotion to the Naval Academy, which unfortunately he never had opportunity to read.\n\nZimmermann fell ill during the latter part of 1915 and took sick leave to fully recover. Upon his return to duty, he suffered a brain hemorrhage and passed away at the Naval Hospital on January 16, 1916. He was given a full military funeral with midshipmen serving as pallbearers. Classes were suspended so that the entire brigade could attend. His body was first interned at St. Mary's Cemetery and later was exhumed and transferred to the Naval Academy Cemetery, where a handsome granite monument was \"Erected by His Midshipmen Friends.\"\n\nAfter Zimmermann's untimely death, his assistant leader, Adolph Torovsky became the bandleader. Torovsky had joined the band as a Cornetist on January 4, 1892, and had quickly risen to a position as the band's first assistant leader. Born in Bohemia in January 21, 1868, he went to Vienna for seven years as a member of the 26th Hungarian Regiment Band, playing the cornet, violin and cello. In Vienna, he studied with several prominent musicians including Johann Strauss Jr. When his enlistment expired in 1891, he traveled to America and joined the Naval Academy Band. Like his predecessor, Torovsky was an accomplished composer. His compositions include \"Memories\" for the Class of 1918, \"Underway\", \"Navy Blue and Gold\" (not the same as the USNA Alma Mater), \"Triumphal March\", \"Our Boys Overseas\", \"Woodland Whispers\",\" The Army and the Navy\" and \"March of the Middies\". In 1913, he had become conductor of the St. John's College band; in that position, he composed the school songs \"St. John's Forever\" and \"Faculty March\".\n\nBy 1919, Congress passed a bill that provided for:\n\n\"One leader, to be a first lieutenant in the Marine Corps; one assistant leader; one drum major; 45 musicians first class and 27 musicians second class\".\n\nTorovsky and the band made the band's first commercial recording on June 9, 1920. The record was released by Columbia Gramophone Company with Zimmermann's \"Anchors Aweigh\" and Torovsky's own \"March of the Middies.\" The following year he retired from the naval service.\n\nFirst formal picture of the Band in Tecumseh Court, 1920\n\nAdolph Torovsky was replaced by H.J. Peterman, a Navy bandmaster from Washington, D.C. By 1925, the spiked helmeted uniform had become outdated, and a new uniform was designed that was dark blue with six gold braids down the front with red facings. The new uniforms were similar in design with the U.S. Marine Band, except the colors were exchanged. This uniform was supplemented the following year by a Navy Chief's style uniform, similar to the current uniforms worn by the band today. In these uniforms, Midshipmen began referring to the Naval Academy Band as \"The Chief's Band,\" a tradition that still lasts today.\n\nIn 1931, legislation sponsored by the Honorable Stephen W. Gambrill, Representative from Maryland's Fifth Congressional District, was passed, and resolved differences in the administration of the U.S. Navy Band and the Naval Academy Band. This amendment provided that the U. S. Naval Academy Band would be comprised of one leader with the pay, allowances, and uniform of a Lieutenant, U. S. Navy; one assistant leader with the pay, allowances, and uniform of a warrant officer, and also raised the membership of the band to include 76 musicians.\n\nWhen Lieutenant Peterman retired in 1932, his assistant director, William Sima, succeeded him.\n\nLieutenant William Sima, best remembered as the composer of the Academy's \"Victory March,\" joined the band at age 18 in 1910. Born in Baltimore, he attended City College and became musical director of the Wilson Theatre at age 15. As the Naval Academy Bandleader, he is credited with several musical compositions, including the musical score to the midshipmen productions of \"Gangway\" and \"Cease Firing.\" In the summer of 1918, he played with Victor Herbert in the \"Red Mill\" and at the premiere performance at Ford's Theater of \"Naughty Marietta.\" In the summer of 1933, twenty members of the band, including Sima, participated in a midshipmen practice cruise. Somewhere in mid-ocean between the Madeira Islands and Halifax, LT Sima and Midshipmen Collins and Martin wrote the words to the \"Victory March\" in about fifteen minutes. A day or so later he completed a musical arrangement and introduced the song to the Brigade of Midshipmen. It was met with overwhelming approval by the Brigade. The song is performed at most Navy sporting events to this day.\n\nDrum Major Otts Jerosik with the trombones. Probably circa 1940.\n\nIn 1939, the band began broadcasting performances over local Maryland radio stations and also traveled to New York City to represent the State of Maryland at the 1939 World's Fair. Congress again increased the size of the band to 78 members: one leader, pay and allowances of senior lieutenant, U.S. Navy; one assistant leader with pay and allowances of a warrant officer, 14 musicians with pay and allowances of permanent chief petty officer, 19 musicians with pay of acting chief petty officer; 22 musicians with pay of 1st class musician; and 22 musicians with pay of 2nd class petty officer.\n\nAlexander Cecil Morris, a career Navy Musician, became leader of the band in 1946. Born in Manhattan's East Village on January 21, 1889, he was orphaned at age three and grew up at the St. Vincent's School for Boys in New York City. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy on November 17, 1907, and served on board the training ship USS Constellation. Eighteen years later, he was selected to be \"third leader\" at the newly formed U.S. Navy Band in Washington D.C., and also held the position as bandleader on board the Presidential Yacht \"MAYFLOWER,\" serving Presidents Warren Harding, Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, and Franklin Roosevelt. In 1931, he was promoted to \"second leader\" at the U.S. Navy Band. He transferred to the Naval Academy Band as second leader in 1938.\n\nNotable events during his tenure include the beginning of a weekly radio show, President Eisenhower's inaugural parade, the band's first performance on television, and marching in the WWII Victory Parade, as well as inaugurating the annual tradition of a combined performance of Handel's \"Messiah\" in the Naval Academy Chapel with the chorus from Hood College.\n\nIn 1953, Congress amended the law governing the Naval Academy Band to permit the Secretary of the Navy to prescribe the grade of the leader. Lieutenant Morris received promotion to Lieutenant Commander. Congress also established that the proportionate distribution among the ratings of the enlisted men would be the same as in the U.S. Navy Band, Washington, D.C. In August 1954, at the request of the Superintendent, a board of officers selected by the Chief of Naval Personnel conducted an inspection of the Naval Academy Band. This board's report covered every facet of the Band's operation, and recommendations were made to increase the size of the band and provide adequate facilities, musical instruments, and equipment. In March of 1955, nearly all of the band's instruments and equipment were replaced. The value of this material was $35,000, but a majority came from surplus stocks on hand which were purchased in anticipation of a large expansion for the Korean War.\n\nAdditional space was acquired to expand the music library and office space needed for increased administrative requirements. Mr. Morris retired in March 1955 after 47 years and five months of continuous service, and was the first Band Leader to be honored by the Naval Academy as the Reviewing Officer at a Dress Parade, as well as by the State of Maryland with Senate Resolution No. 42, congratulating and commending him for his services to the state and the Navy.\n\nTubist Basil Kapchonick serenades a young lady on his sousaphone, and she is obviously impressed!\n\nIn April 1955 Max Corrick became the 11th Leader of the band. Born in Boone, Iowa in 1919, he enlisted in the Navy in 1939 and served as instrumentalist and assistant leader in the Pacific area until 1943. He also served as Leader of a Navy Unit Band and as an instructor at the U.S. Naval School of Music. Mr. Corrick was transferred to the U.S. Naval Academy Band in 1954 and after his appointment as Leader, was promoted to Lieutenant Commander in October 1957.\n\nThe personnel allowance of the band was increased to 85 in May 1955. Many great performers joined the band during this time including trumpeter, Don Tison, pictured above with fellow trumpeters R.C. Kitt and J.G. Eldred. Tison went on to be Principal Trumpet in the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra for 31 years. A uniform for ceremonial occasions and dress parades was redesigned and delivered in September 1955.\n\n1961 Severn River Naval Command (SRNC) Bowling Champions.\n\nNaval Academy Band members Philip Austin, Pete Metzger, Basil Kapchonick, Marty DeMey, Cy Harris, Nick Ferri, Pat Orres\n\nThe much needed band facilities improvement lagged far behind the actual needs of the band as noted in the 1954 Inspection Report. Many proposals had been advanced concerning spaces for the band, and nearly every available building in the U. S. Naval Academy was surveyed and studied as a possible site. In 1961, it was decided that the band would remain in Bancroft Hall and designs were submitted to use the area below the 2nd and 4th wing terraces. The total area occupied by the band increased from 5,130 square feet to 7,900 square feet. This is the same space currently occupied by the band.\n\nHarper's Bazaar magazine sent three fashion models to the Naval Academy for publicity photos in 1963.

The scholarship plus an opportunity to solo with the Naval Academy Band was awarded to the winner of a formal audition held at Annapolis Junior High. The first winner was Ralph M. Gambone, eventually the 23rd Leader of the band.\n\nMr. Corrick died in December of 1965 while serving as Leader of the band, and is buried in the Naval Academy Cemetery. Upon Bandmaster Corrick's death in 1965, the policy governing assignment of band officers to the Naval Academy Band was changed. Officers would no longer be assigned on a permanent duty, non-rotational status. It was felt that the influence of \"Fleet Leadership\" would be beneficial to the organization. Since 1966, leadership of the band has been determined by the Bureau of Naval Personnel.\n\nThe First Naval Academy Band Trombone Quartet:\n\nJack Ingram, Carl Stewart, Don Evans, and Bill Bowden\n\nIn the first 113 years of the band, only 11 different men were assigned as leaders.

His Naval career included duty with bands aboard the U.S.S. Texas, U.S.S. New York, U.S.S. Kearsarge, and the U.S.S. Franklin D. Roosevelt, instructor duty at the School of Music, West Coast Audition Supervisor, and Leader or Assistant Leader of various Navy Bands, including Assistant Leader of the U.S. Navy Band, Washington, DC.\n\nNext Wave Jazz Ensemble, 1966\n\nRow1: Chuck Delcamp, Denny Davis, M. \"Skip\" Harding,\n\nRon Diehl, Barry Weinstein\n\nRow 2: Ken Woodring, Jerry Zadera, Jim Langdon, Don Evans,\n\nBill Bowden, Jack Ingram\n\nRow 3: Rex North, Larry Callahan, John Gatchell,\n\nOtto Schauble, Denny Christianson\n\nTom Short, the first African-American member of the USNA Band, joined the Navy's Oldest and Finest in 1967 as a tuba instrumentalist.\n\nFollowing Lieutenant Commander Turner was John S. Surber, a trombonist with the USNA Band from 1955 to 1960. A native of Peru, Indiana, he graduated from high school in that city and attended Indiana University before enlisting in the Navy in August 1948. During the next several years, he served in unit bands in Yokosuka, Japan, Great Lakes, Illinois, and Commander, Cruiser Division One, home ported in Long Beach, California. In 1955 he was accepted as a trombonist with the United States Naval Academy Band, and remained here until 1960, when he received his commission. Among his duties were leader of the Navy's select Choral group, the Sea Chanters, at the U.S. Navy Band in Washington, DC, Executive Officer of the School of Music, and in May 1968, he returned to the Naval Academy Band as Assistant Leader. He was appointed Leader of the band and promoted to Lieutenant Commander in March 1969. He was assigned as Commanding Officer, School of Music, in 1971, where he remained until his retirement in 1972. He was the first enlisted member to transfer out of the USNA Band, receive a commission and return to Annapolis as Leader.\n\nThe Wind Quintet, 1970\n\n(L-R): Jim Staley, Jerry Lewis, Harold Greinke, Don Carter, Ralph Gambone\n\nDonald Dean Patterson, a native of Ventura, CA, attended Hartnell College, in Salinas, CA, and enlisted in the Navy in 1945, attending the Navy School of Music, Washington, DC, before being assigned as trombone instrumentalist to the PACFLT band aboard the USS Wasp.\n\nDon Patterson discussing the fine points of an arrangement with bass trombonist Gordon Beckwith and arranger Warren Kellerhouse, 1971\n\nMr. Patterson was assigned to the Entertainment Branch, New York, and rehearsed for a show tour to the Far East with a special show band. He also served with bands on the USS St. Paul, USS Astoria, USS Pasadena, USS Springfield, ComCruDiv 5, and Naval Operations Base, Kodiak, AK. In 1954, he transferred to Seattle, where he was head arranger for the Seattle TV series, \"March- On,\" which won two Peabody Awards as the best show of its kind in the country. He served at the Navy School of Music, Washington, DC, Band 161 at Naval Base Brooklyn, NY, and ComNavAirLant, in Norfolk, VA. He was promoted to Lieutenant Commander in 1968 and served as Assistant Leader of the Naval Academy Band until 1970 when he assumed duties as Head, Music Branch at the Bureau of Naval Personnel. He became the 14th Leader of the Naval Academy Band later in 1970, a position he held for only a year. In that time however, the band recorded an album titled Wind and Song with the Naval Academy Glee Club.\n\nNed E. Muffley was the Band's 15th Leader, serving in 1971 and 1972. His musical career as cornet soloist began in Allentown, PA at the age of seven. Mr. Muffley enlisted in the Navy in 1949 and after completing the basic course at the Navy's School of Music in Washington, DC, was assigned to a unit band in Kodiak, Alaska. During this period, he played first chair trumpet for a touring production of \"South Pacific\" entertaining the people in the Aleutians and Alaska. In 1955, he returned to the School of Music for the Advanced Course of instruction. His classes were temporarily interrupted when he was selected to tour nationwide with the Ed Sullivan \"All Navy Talent Show\" as Trumpet Soloist with the band. Upon his return to the School, he completed the Advanced Course and was retained on the faculty as rehearsal conductor. After tours in the fleet, School of Music, and the Music Branch, he was commissioned an Ensign in 1965. In 1970, he was again transferred to the Bureau of Naval Personnel as the assistant head of the Music branch of the U.S. Navy. In 1971 he became head of this branch and guided the entire Navy Music program into accepting women into the Navy Music Community.\n\nThe Next Wave in performance at a Pittsburgh Steelers home game in 1972.\n\nIf they look cold, it may be because it was 18 degrees below zero that day!

Soloists from the band were encouraged to perform as well as renowned artists including jazz pianists Monty Alexander and Marian McPartland. In addition, Tidal Wave, USNA Band's first rock combo, and the Navy's first rock group to go on national tour, was formed.\n\nTidal Wave, the newly formed rock band, in 1972.\n\nkneeling: Steve Enlow, Pete Williams\n\nstanding: Mike Beegle, Dick Glass, Bob Simmons,\n\nLarry Shirk, Ron McGranahan, Bob Rumbley\n\nOn December 8, 1972, Lieutenant Commander Muffley swore in the Navy's first official female instrumentalist, Heidi R. Hunter, of Reisterstown, MD. The soon to be Musician 2nd Class Hunter, a guitarist assigned to the Naval Academy Band, enlisted under a special program designed to attract women instrumentalists into the Navy Music Program. Mr. Muffley went on to serve as leader of the U. S. Navy Band in Washington, DC, and retired in December 1978 after serving in the Navy for 30 years.\n\nWilliam J. \"Joe\" Phillips, a native of North Carolina, enlisted in the Navy as a trombone instrumentalist in 1957 and reported to the School of Music at Naval Station Anacostia. He served with Navy bands at sea and ashore working his way up the ranks. He was advanced to Chief Petty Officer in 1964, promoted to Warrant Officer in 1967 and became the leader of the Commander in Chief Atlantic Fleet Band in 1968. He was commissioned a CWO2 in 1969 and shortly thereafter was promoted to Ensign and reported to the U.S. Naval Academy Band as Assistant Leader. In March of 1972 he became the leader.\n\nAs leader of the Academy Band, Mr. Phillips proposed to revamp the image of the United States Academy Band and initiated a concept in programming that was new to the band and a departure from its traditional performances and repertoire. Academy Band concerts were totally thematic, complete with scripts and narration using a fifty-five piece band instrumentally capable of any sound from the classics to a lush, studio recording sound.\n\nGayle (Holmes) Slater, pictured above to the right of Ralph Martino, along with Dave Ward, staff arranger Warren Kellerhouse,\n\nand Bandmaster Joe Phillips, was recruited in 1973.\n\nKnown as \"The Naval Academy's First Lady of Song,\" she had a highly successful 20-year career with the band.\n\nA staff of arrangers and copyists labored endlessly to provide new arrangements, making the programs about 85% original, and vocalists were featured to hold audience interest. This concept increased the Band's popularity and resulted in overflow crowds and the expansion of the band's concert schedule to include open-air concerts at the North Severn Naval Station during the summer, and the need to perform their indoor concerts twice weekly.\n\nIn January of 1974, the band's strength was officially cut from 88 musicians to 64, a move that coincided with many economizing measures in the Navy. Navy Music was reconfigured at this time, eliminating Unit bands and creating larger regional bands. In June of 1974, the rank of E-6 (Musician 1st Class) became entry level for all new members of the Naval Academy Band, School of Music and US Navy Band to provide equity with members of the Special Bands in the other services.\n\nThere was a new push on touring in support of the \"all volunteer force,\" and all of Navy Music was put at the disposal of the Navy Recruiting Command. The bulk of the Naval Academy Band's touring was done by the rock band \"Tidal Wave.\"\n\nTidal Wave in 1973.\n\nLarry Shirk, Steve Enlow, Bob Simmons, Bob Rumbley,\n\nJohn Pastin, Scott Ragsdale, Dick Glass\n\nIn 1975 consideration was give to the consolidation of the US Navy Band and USNA Band. The Band enjoyed a great reputation at the time and the plan was met with serious resistance from the community, with letters written to the Superintendent of the Naval Academy, members of Congress and the newspaper.\n\nThe Original Crabtowne Stompers, 1975\n\nEmmett Wright, Dewayne McClaeb, Bob Simmons,\n\nHenning Hoehne, Phil Cook, Tony Mazzone\n\nThe band was invited to march along with 90 midshipmen in a Bicentennial celebration parade in Massachusetts, with President Gerald R.

Navy band in Washington, DC, and has the distinction of being the first officer in the music program to achieve the rank of Captain.\n\nCountry vocalist and guitarist, Ben Winter.\n\nIn the post Vietnam era, an attempt was made to reach young people for the new \"All Volunteer\" military through popular music.\n\nThis included the Navy's newly formed rock and country groups.\n\nMr. Winter was recruited locally, Davidsonville, Maryland,\n\nbut spent only a short time here before joining \"Country Current,\"\n\nthe very popular country and bluegrass ensemble from the Navy Band, Washington, DC.\n\nJohn Richard Bledsoe, a native of Miami, FL began his professional career as a French horn instrumentalist while attending the University of Miami. After enlisting in the Navy in 1958 he was assigned to duties with bands in the US Sixth Fleet and elsewhere.

Two years later, he extended this study to the saxophone and clarinet. Upon graduation from high school, he was awarded a scholarship to attend the Eastman School of Music, where he majored in music education. A member of the Naval Reserve since 1954, Commander Beck enlisted in the regular Navy in 1957 and was selected for duty as a clarinetist with the United States Navy Band. In July of 1960, he left the band to gain more experience in the Navy's music program, serving in Fleet Bands as player and Leader, serving as instructor at the School of Music, and working at the Music Branch as Detailer and Material Assistant, before his appointment to Warrant Officer in 1966.

These included a concert at Pasadena City College with USNA Band and the Military Academy Band joining forces, \"Next Wave\" backing up Mr. Alan Thicke on his nationally televised program \"Thicke of the Night\", and a parade through Pasadena to the Rose Bowl. Commander Beck continued the annual Side By Side concert and rehearsals featuring outstanding high school musicians as guests, but added a guest conductor and clinician, creating a wonderful learning experience for all involved.\n\n\"All Hands on Deck for Bob Hope's All-Star Birthday Party at Annapolis.\"\n\nIn May of 1982 the band participated in the taping of a prime time Bob Hope television special \"All Hands on Deck for Bob Hope's All Star Birthday Party at Annapolis.\" It was taped at Navy Marine Corps Stadium over three rainy days and featured many stars, midshipmen, and the band.

He enlisted in the Navy in 1958 and attended the Navy School of Music in Washington, DC. His Navy music assignments took him twice to Japan and to the Armed Forces School of Music, where he served as piano and arranging instructor, rehearsal conductor, and staff arranger. In 1970 he was appointed a warrant officer and assigned as director of the Naval Air Station Band in Pensacola, Florida.

As a joke someone replied that we were part of the new \"Enlisted Astronaut\" program. People seemed intrigued by this fictitious program, often asking more questions leading to elaborate tales. One day while playing an airshow in Pennsylvania we spotted this NASA exhibit and thought it would be a great photo opportunity. The sign reads \" Enlisted Astronaut Program From Lyres to Flyers.\" By the way, a very large crowd gathered to photograph this distinguished group. The truth was revealed when the band performed to a very appreciative crowd.\n\nLieutenant Commander Fluck was assigned as Assistant Director of the Naval Academy band in July 1987 and became director of the band in August 1988.

It has always been my goal to come home as the band leader, but for a while it just didn't seem like it would happen. Being able to work with these outstanding musicians is truly a rewarding experience. I just couldn't ask for a better group of professionals. We are very fortunate because we have terrific support from our command. From the Superintendent, Adm. Charles Larson, and the Commandant, Capt. Randy Bogle, on down the chain of command, we are treated as important members of the Naval Academy family.\" - Commander Ralph Gambone (from Master Chief Musician James Cunningham's article 'A Childhood Dream Realized' that appeared in \"Inside Annapolis Magazine\" in 1997).\n\nCommander Gambone enlisted in the Navy in 1969 after receiving his bachelor's degree in music from Towson State University in Baltimore.
