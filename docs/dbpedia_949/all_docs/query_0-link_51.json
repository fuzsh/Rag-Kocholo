In the Catholic and mainline Protestant traditions, one of the main symbols used during the Advent Season is the Advent Wreath. These wreaths are often placed in prominent places in the church’s sanctuary so that all can see the colored candles and smell the fragrant evergreen boughs.\n\nThe Advent Wreath, with its humble origins as wagon wheels hung from ceilings when ancient roads were impassible, were used as chandeliers with increasing number of candles as the days grew short and the darkness increased. This circle of evergreens evokes the eternity of a God who has no beginning or end and the truth that Christ is the Light that conquers the darkness in which we walk. The candles may all be white with decorative ribbon: three of which are purple, one of which is rose or the candles themselves may be of those aforementioned colors. If you have the space, some place a white candle in the center, representing Christ.\n\nAs was the tradition in my home when I was a boy, many in our university community place Advent Wreaths in their homes- lighting the appropriate candles during the dinner hour each night. As the youngest of eleven children, it often fell to me to light the candles of the wreath as we said a special prayer and sang a verse from the ancient hymn O come, O come, Emmanuel. (To get a copy of an advent prayer service you can use in your own home, please click here).\n\nMay your home be blessed in a special way during this holy season of expectation. Let us continue to pray for each member of our families and for The University of Scranton family as well. May God’s infinite goodness bring each of you joy and peace this Advent Season.\n\nRev. Patrick Rogers, S.J.\n\nExecutive Director, The Jesuit Center\n\nPRAYER\n\nWe pray, O Lord, for the courage to walk with you as Advent unfolds before us. May the scent of evergreen boughs remind us of your everlasting love and may the growing light of the Advent Wreath candles scatter the darkness in each human heart.\n\nDecember 3 Reflection\n\nLove has many forms. Friendship is one of the most important. So, today on the Feast of St. Francis Xavier—the most famous of all Jesuits—let us see how he related with his friends.\n\nWriting from a remote isle in what is now Indonesia, he said:\n\nSo that I may never forget you and ever have a special remembrance of you, I would have you know, dearest brothers, that for my own consolation I have cut your names from the letters which you have written to me with your own hands so that I may constantly carry them with me together with the vow of profession which I made because of the consolations which I receive from them. I give thanks first of all to God our Lord, and then to you, most dear Brothers and Fathers, for the fact that God has so made you that I derive such great consolation from bearing your names.\n\nAnd a footnote adds:\n\nWhen Xavier died he had a locket suspended from his neck which contained a small relic of St. Thomas, the formula of his vows, and a signature of Ignatius which he had cut from a letter.\n\n(Costelloe, Letters of Francis Xavier, 141-42)\n\nMay we fruitfully remember and help our friends, most of whom are so much nearer.\n\nJames D. Redington, S.J.\n\nJesuit Fellow, The Jesuit Center\n\nPRAYER\n\nLord Jesus Christ,\n\nwe humbly pray on this feast of Saint Francis that all be gathered together at the great banquet in your Father's Kingdom, the Kingdom prepared from the foundation of the world.\n\nDecember 4 Reflection\n\nOn this day we remember the life of St. John Damascene. John was an astonishing person having spent most of his life living in Muslim majority places but living near Jerusalem. He was a writer and a poet who used his talents to pay homage to the Blessed Mother. We can all look to the life of St. John Damascene during this Advent season to remind us of the Blessed Mother and her beautiful gift of a child that she shared with the world on December 25.\n\nSharing one’s child with others can be very difficult. In fact, my personal journey involves being the recipient of a mother sharing her child with me. My husband and I adopted our children years ago from two loving birth mothers. Giving your children to others is the ultimate sacrifice, yet the most loving one in the case of adoption. Thus, I regularly pray to the Blessed Mother to remind myself of her ultimate sacrifice in giving her Son to save all of us. I try and say a decade of the rosary on a daily basis in thanks for the gift from other mothers to me. I see the rosary as the beads of life all connected together with the love of the Blessed Mother.\n\nIn closing, I leave you with a very special poem and prayer. Reading it always reminds me of the innocence of a child. Enjoy, and have a blessed Advent season.\n\nCatherine Lovecchio, Ph.D.\n\nDepartment Chair, Nursing\n\nPRAYER\n\n\"Heartprints\"\n\nWhatever our hands touch…\n\nWe leave fingerprints.\n\nOn walls, on furniture,\n\nOn door knobs, dishes and books.\n\nSmudges, showing we were there! Oh Lord, please,\n\nWherever I go today…\n\nHelp me leave Heartprints…\n\nHeartprints of compassion,\n\nUnderstanding and love.\n\nHeartprints of kindness\n\nAnd genuine concern. I shall go out today…\n\nTo leave Heartprints…\n\nAnd if some one should say…\n\n“I felt your touch!”\n\nMay that one feeling be…\n\nYour loving touch, Lord,\n\nThrough me!\n\nMay my heart touch\n\nmy lonely neighbor, with a smile,\n\na worried mother, with peace,\n\na runaway child, with safety,\n\na homeless person, with warmth,\n\nand my dear friends, with love.\n\nDecember 5 Reflection\n\nIn today’s gospel reading, Jesus fulfills a prophecy from Isaiah by ascending a mountain. “Great crowds came to him, having with them the lame, the blind, the deformed, the mute, and many others. They placed them at his feet, and he cured them.” It doesn’t say how Jesus cured them or what He said, if anything, but it does mention that “the crowds were amazed,” and that they glorified God. Jesus does reveal what he was feeling, however: “my heart is moved with pity for the crowd,” he says to his disciples, “for they have been with me now for three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry.” Jesus then blesses the scant bread and fish they had with them so that it fed everyone with baskets to spare.\n\nIt wasn’t enough that Jesus cured the people; he had to make sure they were also fed. I hear echoes of my grandmother: “sit down, you’re not going anywhere until you’ve eaten something.” Preparing food for another and eating together with them fosters intimacy. Jesus wants that intimacy with the people gathered there on the mountain. It wasn’t enough for Him to “fix their problems.” He wanted to prepare and share a meal with them, to bond with them, to befriend them.\n\nThe prophecy from Isaiah speaks of the Lord on a mountain providing for all peoples “a feast of rich food and choice wines.” Then comes the healing: “on this mountain He will destroy the veil that veils all people, the web that is woven over all nations; He will destroy death forever. The Lord God will wipe away the tears from all faces…” What a beautiful, moving image! One can’t help but wonder if Jesus wiped away anyone’s tears as He healed them that day in Galilee.\n\nJesus gave the people bread and fish that day on that mountain, but very soon He would also give them His life: His very flesh and blood, sacrificed on the cross. It is through this sacrifice that the God of life destroys death once and for all. And so in receiving Jesus’ body and blood at the sacrifice of the Mass, we are also fulfilling that prophecy from Isaiah by sharing in the feast that saves us from death. As Jesus tells us, “anyone who eats my body and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise that person on the last day” (Jn 6:54).\n\nPatrick Clark\n\nAssociate Professor, Theology & Religious Studies\n\nPRAYER\n\nLord Jesus, you are the Good Shepherd who became the Lamb of God, born as a child in Bethlehem. Lead us to Your holy mountain, to verdant pastures and restful waters. Gather us around the table you have prepared for us, where we might feast on You, Who are the fulfillment of all good things. And grant that we might dwell in Your presence all the days of our life, and be raised up with You on the last day. Amen.\n\nDecember 6 Reflection\n\nThe true story of Santa Claus begins with St. Nicholas, and on this sixth day of December, we celebrate the Feast of St. Nicholas. While many of us visualize a fantastical Santa, it’s comforting to recall that the real St. Nicholas, who was born to wealthy parents in the third century, obeyed Jesus’ words to “sell what you own and give the money to the poor.\" St. Nicholas used his entire inheritance to help the needy, sick, and suffering. He dedicated his life to serving God and was known for his generosity to those in need and his love for children. In his true form, St. Nicholas points us to God’s most special gift; the sending of a Savior for the most ordinary of people.\n\nAs we walk this Advent journey, let us pray that we act as St. Nicholas did and remember the words of Jesus; to give all that we can to the poor, needy, and sick. May we live our faith and share our love, compassion, and abundance during Advent, and carry it with us throughout the entire year.\n\n\"The giver of every good and perfect gift has called upon us to mimic Gods giving, by grace, through faith, and this is not of ourselves.\"\n\n- St. Nicholas of Myra\n\nTara M. Seely\n\nAdministrative Assistant to the Board of Trustees\n\nPRAYER\n\nGracious God, open our hearts to be like the poor children who were cared for by St. Nicholas and knew your generosity first hand. By St. Nicholas’ example, and through his intercession, give us the courage to care for the needy in our communities.\n\nDecember 7 Reflection\n\nI have always welcomed the Advent season as one of celebration. I was born on the seventh day of December, so each year, the weeks before Christmas are literally a new beginning for me, filled with anticipation and joy. In addition, the fourteenth day of December is my wedding anniversary, which marks another milestone. For these reasons, I think of Advent as a sequence of events that fulfill a promise and look forward to early winter as a time of positive growth and change.\n\nDuring my childhood, my parents were active in our church Sunday School, so Advent was also a time of decorating parties, caroling groups, and holiday pageants. At many of these events, my father would say an opening prayer, passed on to him from his grandfather. Its clarity remains with me, so I will share it with you today.\n\nDarlene Miller-Lanning\n\nHope Horn Gallery Director\n\nAdjunct Faculty, Art & Music Program and Women's Studies\n\nPRAYER\n\nDear Lord\n\nOur Heavenly Father,\n\nThank You for this day and the many blessings\n\nwe have received.\n\nBless us, protect us, and be with us now\n\nand forever more.\n\nIn Jesus’ name we pray. Amen\n\nDecember 8 Reflection\n\nToday in the Church we celebrate the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary. This feast reminds us of the beautiful connection between Mary and the season of Advent. Pope Benedict XVI once wrote: “The Virgin Mary perfectly incarnates the spirit of Advent; this spirit is one of listening to God, of profound desire to do his will, of joyous service to our neighbor. Letting ourselves be guided by her, so that the God who comes does not find us closed and distracted, but can, in each one of us, extend a part of his kingdom of love, of justice and of peace.”\n\nFrom the beginning, Mary embraced the wonder of her newborn child. She was totally attentive to this experience of the mystery of God’s salvation. In the Scriptures, we hear: “Mary treasured all of these things and pondered them in her heart.” Mary’s “yes” gradually unfolded in her life, and thus her memory, those things she treasured and pondered in her heart, remained close to her.\n\nTo identify with Mary in faith during this season is to be open to listen and to receive what she received and to experience a profound sense of gratitude for the warmth of God’s love given to us in His Son. Mary would remain attentive to God’s graces in her life, even though His coming would disrupt her own plans. At every turn in her life, she remembered God’s promise to her and treasured it and pondered it.\n\nDuring this Advent season, we are also challenged to remember; to reflect on God’s goodness to us even during those times that we don’t see God’s presence so clearly. With Mary, we desire to listen, to treasure, and to follow.\n\nRev. Herbert B. Keller, S.J.\n\nRector, Scranton Jesuit Community\n\nSpecial Assistant to the President\n\nPRAYER\n\nO God,\n\nduring this Advent season,\n\nmay we, like Mary,\n\nbe open to your Word\n\nand respond in love, gratitude and service.\n\nMay we, too, listen,\n\ntreasure and follow.\n\nAmen.\n\nDecember 9 Reflection\n\nJohn the Baptist always introduces us to the Advent Season. For me, he is one of my personal heroes and an exemplar of what it is to be a person of faith.\n\nEveryone was convinced that John was the Messiah. The crowds followed him everywhere. But instead of hogging the spotlight, John turned everyone around to follow Jesus. And they all soon forgot about John as he languished alone in Herod’s prison awaiting his eventual beheading. I think John teaches us that the essence of sanctity is not striving to be more extraordinary than others, but turning the spotlight on others so that they can discover just how extraordinary they are, too.\n\nWhen I arrived at Scranton 35 years ago, there was a remarkable Jesuit in Campus Ministries, Fr. Bill Tome, SJ. He spent most of his ministry in India and was an advisor to the Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi. Here, no one knew of his exploits as a younger man; he was just an old, nearly blind Jesuit taking up a desk. What I found remarkable about him was that whenever he chanced to make a new student friend, he always introduced him or her to other Jesuits, even if it meant he would probably see less of that student as a result. It didn’t matter to Bill; what mattered was his students benefitting from other wisdom besides his own. He was as selfless as John the Baptist himself!\n\nFr. Ronald McKinney, S.J.\n\nProfessor of Philosophy\n\nPRAYER\n\nJohn the Baptist spent his ministry pointing his followers to the true fulfillment that only the Messiah could bring. May our eyes be open to the eternal love of God so that we are not distracted by those things that are merely passing.\n\nDecember 10 Reflection\n\nIn today’s readings we hear about a holy highway that is “for those with a journey to make, and on it the redeemed will walk.” This holy road is set in a place that reflects the glory of God in lush nature; it is a comforting place to walk, where journeys are undertaken with confidence. Who wouldn’t want to travel there? Contrary to what we hear about life as a road, the road in Isaiah 35 is the destination.\n\nPerhaps the journey of your life has taken you (or your loved ones) on paths crossing city limits, state lines, and country borders. We worry about others when they travel, do we not? We usually think to ourselves, what if they run out of money? Will they be able to find their way in a place where they don’t know anybody? What if they trust the wrong people? This concern, as we well know, is a sign of love; it is what makes us wish that the roads on this Earth could be as safe and welcoming as the holy highway.\n\nI want to ask you to follow me in an exercise of imagination: consider whether God could have been asking similar questions as the ones above when Jesus traveled to this world, much like a parent would ask them about her or his beloved child. Could Joseph have asked them, too, when the Blessed Mother visited her cousin Elizabeth? And, further, could these be the questions that the families of migrants and refugees all over the world ask when they see their loved ones leave their homes for a future almost certainly seeded with indignities, abuse, loneliness, and fear?\n\nIn this season of Advent, we accompany the Blessed Mother to welcome Jesus and prepare for His birth. I would like to invite you to consider how we can ease her journey by welcoming others in the name of Jesus her son, that is, in the name of Love. Let us reflect on how, united as a community inspired by Ignatius, we can make the holy highway a reality “for those with a journey to make.”\n\nIleana Szymanski\n\nPhilosophy Department\n\nPRAYER\n\nMary, Mother of God,\n\npray for us.\n\nSaint Christopher, patron Saint of travelers,\n\npray for us.\n\nDecember 11 Reflection\n\nToday’s reflection comes from Aba Amon-Kwafo, a junior neuroscience major in the College of Arts and Sciences. Aba was raised in New Jersey and has family ties to the West African nation of Ghana.\n\nFr. Patrick:Welcome to the Jesuit Center, Aba. What kinds of things do you like to do during Advent to prepare you for Christmas?\n\nAba: Well, for me it’s all about music and food! I really like listening to Christmas music, so as soon as Thanksgiving arrives I’ve got it on 24/7. I’m a particular fan of Michael Bublé and can listen to his Christmas album over and over again. I also like “old school” Christmas classics like those sung by Nat King Cole! Because Advent is a time for preparation, my family also likes to sing Ghanaian songs that remind us of our cultural heritage and of family members we love and miss.\n\nAlso, since my family is in a celebratory mood during the holidays, my mother cooks a lot of traditional Ghanaian food during Advent and Christmas. For example, when my dad and I are outside decorating the house to get ready for Christmas, my mom is inside cooking her awesome “light” soup. Let me tell you, there’s nothing like coming in from the cold and being greeted by that incredible aroma; especially since I know it’ll soon be warming up my bones!\n\nFr. Patrick:What about Christmas? How does your family celebrate the nativity?\n\nAba: We usually sleep in because we’ve gone to the Midnight Mass. When we are in Ghana for the holidays, Mass won’t end until 3:30 or 4:00 a.m. so we like to get our sleep. My mom makes a special Ghanaian delicacy for Christmas that I can’t wait for. It’s a pound cake with currants, cherries, raisins and lots of other types of fruits. It is delicious for sure. We save this special cake for Christmas because it reminds my parents of Ghana and family.\n\nMostly though, we spend the day relaxing and enjoying each other’s company while listening to great Christmas music and eating terrific traditional Ghanaian food.\n\nFr. Patrick: Thanks for sharing your Advent and Christmas traditions with us, Aba. Have a blessed Advent and a terrific finals week. I hope your Christmas is a special one, and if you’ve got any of that cake left over, please be kind to Fr. Patrick and bring him a slice!\n\nAba: You got it Fr. Patrick!\n\nPRAYER\n\nGood and gracious God, continue to bless each and every person in the human family. Turn our hearts towards You and to that peace and joy that only your Spirit can provide. Help us to follow you more closely.\n\nDecember 12 Reflection\n\nToday the Jesuit Center staff wishes to share the following story of Our Lady of Guadalupe, retrieved from LoyolaPress.com:\n\nOn December 9, 1531, a 57-year-old Aztec, Juan Diego, saw the Blessed Mother on a hill in Mexico City. She told Juan to have a church built in her honor. When Juan went to ask Bishop Zumarraga about this, the bishop did not understand the Indian dialect—and he did not believe in the vision Juan described.\n\nThree days later, on December 12, Mary appeared again to Juan Diego, and this time she gave him a sign for the bishop. “Take these roses to the bishop,” she said, as she arranged in his cloak beautiful roses she had Juan Diego pick from the hillside although it was winter. When he was admitted into the bishop’s room, Juan Diego opened his cloak, and out dropped the roses. On the cloak there remained an image of Mary as she had appeared to Juan Diego.\n\nThe image of Mary on the cloak is known as Our Lady of Guadalupe for an interesting reason. On that same day, Mary appeared to Juan’s uncle and cured him, giving him a message for the bishop, saying that she would “crush the serpent’s head.” The bishop did not understand the Indians’ language. The Indian word for “crush the serpent” sounded to him like “Guadalupe,” the name of Mary’s shrine in Spain. Thinking that the Virgin wanted the new shrine to have the same name, the bishop called her Our Lady of Guadalupe.\n\nMary appeared to Juan Diego dressed as an Aztec woman to show her love and compassion to an oppressed group of people. Mary had heard the prayers and pain of these people, and she came to give them hope.\n\nMary’s visit to Guadalupe is a reminder that God will remember his mercy for all people. In Mary’s song of joy, the Magnificat, she praised God because he has put down the mighty, exalted the lowly, filled the hungry, and sent the rich away empty. People honor Our Lady of Guadalupe because they recognize her motherly concern for them.\n\nPRAYER\n\nDear mother, we love you. We thank you for your promise to help us in our need. We trust in your love that dries our tears and comforts us. Teach us to find our peace in your son, Jesus, and bless us every day of our lives. Amen.\n\nDecember 13 Reflection\n\nWe finally put the Christmas lights up last night. By “we” I would like to be clear that I played no role in the project. When I mentioned to my kids that I thought the lights were a lost cause this year, my 7-year-old had a terrific response.\n\n“This is a celebration after all.”\n\nI like this time of year. I mean, I really like this time of year. And I like what the “celebration” entails.\n\nCan I say that? Am I allowed to admit that I like walking through malls and buying things? I love watching my kids barely – and I mean barely – contain their excitement before walking into the living room on Christmas morning. I’m fond of the Christmas glitz (the lights in Nay Aug Park) and the Christmas glamour (people treating one another like they should always treat them). Shoot, I even kind of like the desperate oh-my-goodness-we-almost-forgot the slinging of the family elf from one shelf to the next before one of our kids wake up each morning.\n\nThere, I said it. I like just about everything about Christmas. I certainly feel better after coming clean.\n\nBut that is part of the tension I feel each year. How do I live in and enjoy the real world Christmas with all of its stuff – the buying and consuming – while maintaining the focus of the real celebration: the birth of Jesus. Christmas and the birth of Jesus can be synonymous.\n\nIt is possible to celebrate the joy and wonderment of Christmas without losing the meaning. That’s part of the challenge of being a Christian. We are, after all, called to be a part of this world without ever losing our faith and purpose. Being engaged with the world is part of the example of Jesus enduring this world with us.\n\nEven now, in the business of this season, we can make simple adjustments. We don’t have to change who we are and what we enjoy. There is a big difference between purchasing to consume and purchasing in order to bring about joy and in order to give. We can turn “Did I buy enough?’ into “Did I give enough?” We can turn time spent doing things alone into meaningful time spent with family and friends.\n\nI am going to take my 3-year-old to sit on Santa’s lap this week – and the other three are coming too! Yes, they are going to ask for things. And yes they are going to get some of those things. We will also continue to go to church, we are going to continue to pray as a family, and I am going to continue to help them understand why we celebrate the birth of Jesus and why it is so important think of others during this time.\n\nI don’t think I know the best way to navigate this wonderful and crazy season, but I am going to do my best to make sure my family is filled with joy, excitement, and love in anticipation of Christmas day.\n\nThis is a celebration after all.\n\nRyan Sheehan, J.D.\n\nAssistant Director, The Jesuit Center\n\nPRAYER\n\nGracious and merciful Creator, let me look upon your coming with wonderment and joy. Allow me to be an instrument of your peace, to bring love and excitement to those around me, so that we may welcome You on Christmas day.\n\nDecember 14 Reflection\n\nAdvent teaches us to desire and welcome our Lord Jesus Christ. It is important to welcome Him as He presents himself and to put our expectations second, otherwise we will never be able to accept Him, as He likes to surprise us. In fact, it is better if He does not present as we expect because our expectations limit us. His real and concrete presence frees us from ourselves and puts us in a relationship with the Father.\n\nWe need to be ready to recognize Jesus’ coming. This means, first, giving up excuses that mask our disinterest and our resistance to the invitation of conversation which unceasingly leads us to the word of God. Jesus' recurring messages urge us to walk in justice and operate in sincere faith.\n\nChrist’s coming is not just about penance and change of life, but about happiness brought by the Gospel. Evangelical happiness will be born in us if we know that He was not ashamed of being called a “friend of sinners”. The forgiveness that He grants us is not an empty word, nor generic message of His good disposition towards us. Rather, it is a signal of his arrival, and his desire to celebrate our lives with us even though we are sinners.\n\nMay God free us of a critical spirit that denies everything, that always finds reason to not accept, to not welcome life as it is presented to us, to not welcome people as they are. During Advent, we are reminded of the true spirit of welcome and benevolence that encourages us to see everything that is good in the world and in our lives. That same spirit helps us provide a better service to the Lord, a spirit that helps us progress in the giving and receiving of love.\n\nMaria Vital, Ph.D.\n\nOperations Manager, Leahy Clinic\n\nLeahy Community Health Center\n\nPRAYER\n\nFree us, Lord, of the bad spirits that deny your presence among us. Give us your strength this holy season that we may always progress in the giving and receiving of love. Amen.\n\nDecember 15 Reflection\n\nA message of hope.\n\nThe readings for today convey restoration and friendship, with an undercurrent of hope. The first reading speaks of re-connection and re-establishment, as in turning back “the hearts of fathers toward their sons, and to re-establish the tribes of Jacob.” It also speaks of friendship: “Blessed is he who shall have seen you and who falls asleep in your friendship.” Today’s Gospel reading conveys restoration, calling on us to believe, and to have faith and hope.\n\nThat, of course, is the message of this season of renewal, opportunities, and hope. That message is also seen in the life of the saint for this day, Saint Mary (Paula) di Rosa. As I happened to read about her, I am struck by her fight against hardship throughout her life, but in every obstacle, in every moment of grief and turmoil, she saw opportunity. Sister Mary lived in a world equally divided as the one at the present time, but she seems to have never given up. Such was her life that when she died at the young age of 42, she had fought miraculously for the sick, those dying, and especially the poor girls, sustained, it appears, at every turn, by her faith in the power of God’s love, in friendships, and in hope.\n\nIn this time of Advent, let us slow down a little in our hustling lives, in a divided world, to reflect on friendships and restoration. As a Catholic and as a person, I look forward to this time of the year to relax and reflect, and to re-connect. Let us cherish this time of peace and warmth in the comfort of our family and friends, and take this opportunity to look forward to the coming of Christ, with hope.\n\nSunil Ahuja, Ph.D.\n\nAssociate Provost for Academic Affairs\n\nProfessor, Department of Political Science\n\nPRAYER\n\nDear Lord, give us insight and intellectual capacity, particularly in this season of Advent as we look forward to the celebration of Christmas, that we may never lose faith in hope.\n\nDecember 16 Reflection\n\nRejoice! Rejoice! Again I say Rejoice!\n\nGeorge Bailey in the Christmas classic, It’s a Wonderful Life, fervently prays, “I want to live again. Please, God, I want to live again.” The immediate response is his being recognized by Bert, the cop. George has been restored back to life! And his heart is filled with Joy.\n\nThe final ten minutes of the movie are a depiction of a man who had been blind to the gifts and joys of his life. He now realizes how blessed he is, and he goes wild with joy. George had measured himself against the success of others, and had felt that he had missed the boat on Sam Wainwright and plastics, and much more. His nemesis, the frustrated, warped old man, Mr. Potter, had kept the Bailey Building and Loan’s $8,000 (some $695,000 in 2018 dollars), and gotten away with it.\n\nBut the reality is that George’s life of loving, self-sacrificing service had kept Bedford Falls from devolving into Pottersville. George was, in truth, “the richest man in town.” His real wealth and joy were all his friends in Bedford Falls, his kids, and his loving wife, Mary, who had the good sense to deal with the crisis by asking others for help!\n\nFr. Rick Malloy, S.J.\n\nUniversity Chaplain\n\nAdjunct Professor, Anthropology, Sociology & Theology\n\n“THE JOY OF THE GOSPEL fills the hearts and lives of all who encounter Jesus. Those who accept his offer of salvation are set free from sin, sorrow, inner emptiness and loneliness. With Christ joy is constantly born anew.” – Pope Francis’s Exhortation, The Joy of the Gospel.\n\n“...being in love with God is the basic fulfillment of our conscious intentionality. That fulfillment brings a deep-set joy that can remain despite humiliation, failure, privation, pain, betrayal, desertion. That fulfillment brings a radical peace, the peace the world cannot give. That fulfillment bears fruit in a love of one's neighbor that strives mightily to bring about the kingdom of God on this earth.” - Bernard Lonergan, S.J.\n\n“Joy is the best makeup.” – Anne Lamott\n\nDecember 17 Reflection\n\nThe O Antiphons of the Advent Season are used at Vespers during the last seven days of Advent, beginning today, December 17, through December 23. Each antiphon is a name or a title for Christ, drawn from the Old Testament.\n\nThe antiphon prescribed for use today (December 17) is “O Sapienta”, or Christ as Wisdom. Wisdom, or sapience, has been defined as the ability to think and act using knowledge, experience, understanding, common sense, and insight.\n\nThe readings of the Advent season inspire us and help us to grow deeper in our relationship with God. However, reading alone isn’t enough. We must take God’s word and use our ability to think, our experiences, our understanding, and our insight to take God’s Word and put it into practice in our own lives.\n\nI challenge you to not let the many things we do for the Christmas season prevent you from celebrating the true meaning of Christmas. Use your “wisdom” to find opportunity to serve and bring the greatest happiness to others.\n\nMerry Christmas!\n\nDave Martin\n\nDirector of Athletics\n\nPRAYER\n\nWe beg you Good and Gracious God to give us the gift of Holy Wisdom.\n\nHelp us to use that Wisdom in the service of others.\n\nWe ask this in your Holy Name, Amen.\n\nDecember 18 Reflection\n\nReminder to Believe.\n\nMy children are 6 and 7. And this may be our most magical Christmas (then again, I said that last year.) I know the wonder of Santa Claus will be a faded memory before long. This year, though, this year they believe in Santa with every fiber of their being. They believe our little elf friend reports back to the big guy each night. So much so that I catch them whispering to her at bedtime asking for a little discretion before she makes her way to the North Pole.\n\nTo watch my children have such unwavering faith in something - even Santa and his helper elf - brings me joy and comfort.\n\nThis past year, I had the incredible privilege of participating in the Ignatian Leadership Program offered by the Jesuit Center. After several months of preparation, we embarked on the remarkable Footsteps of Ignatius Pilgrimage. The pilgrimage led us through the life of St. Ignatius. We visited numerous significant and holy places along the way, including Loyola castle, the cave of Manresa, and the Gesu church in Rome. Those ten days transformed me and my relationship with God.\n\nWhen I see how intensely my children believe in Santa, it reminds me of how strongly St. Ignatius believed in Christ. And this inspires me to quiet myself and strive to have the same faith. Faith in something that sometimes seems impossible or almost too good to be true.\n\nSometimes I just need to remind myself to believe.\n\nBryn Schofield\n\nAdministrative Assistant\n\nCollege of Arts & Sciences\n\nPRAYER\n\nLord, let me see You in this season. Help me believe when I am busy and tired and in need of direction. Let me hear Your voice speak this Christmas.\n\nDecember 19 Reflection\n\nThe Gospel for today speaks about maintaining faith in God throughout difficult times. Zechariah prayed for some time to have his prayers answered by God, and we see that an angel comes to answer his prayers. After weeks and weeks of tests, essays, projects, and presentations, students get their first week home with their friends and families. The stress and countless prayers to God throughout finals week comes to a close as students, faculty, and staff prepare for the arrival of Christmas. After a tough semester, our community has our prayers answered. We enter our homes and breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nMost important to this time of year is appreciating those around us. It is appreciating the comfort and ability we all have to breathe that sigh of relief at home. While each of us should be grateful that we can enter a warm, beautifully decorated home for the holiday season, we must keep in mind those who are less fortunate. We must keep in mind those who do not get that sigh of relief. While it is important to appreciate the time each of us gets to spend at home, we should take an extra step this Christmas season to do something outside our usual routine to help those in need. We, as men and women for and with others, should step outside the comfort of our usual holiday routines to try something new this year.\n\nMatthew J. Coughlin\n\nPresident, Student Government\n\nPRAYER\n\nGod of Light- help us to be men and women for others. Help us to shake off our old ways of doing things so that we can be ready to receive something new and surprising from You!\n\nDecember 20 Reflection\n\nRight now I am in a desert. Literally.\n\nMore specifically, I am chaperoning a group of students on the Death Valley Retreat where we have the opportunity to spend the first week of break learning how to “clear a space.” The purpose of clearing a space is straightforward: to limit distractions in order to hear God. The group is taught various strategies in order to limit our minds from wandering and to remain centered on God. To be completely honest, clearing a space is the hardest thing I have ever done.\n\nMy mind is excellent at wandering onto the most random of topics, but here I am attempting to purposely calm myself to listen for God each day. You are probably thinking, what does any of this have to do with Advent?\n\nIn today’s Gospel reading, Mary is visited by Gabriel and he tells her that she will bear a son - the Son of God. Mary hears this news, and in what must have been one of the most difficult and overwhelming experiences of her life, she nonetheless clears a space for God. Mary listens and trusts. The act of listening and trusting someone seems so easy for Mary. She replies, “Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord. May it be done to me according to your word.”\n\nEvery single time I read this line, I am blown away. We are called to listen and trust God. We are called to calm our lives in order that the example of Mary may take hold. Take some time to clear a space this season – physically, mentally, emotionally – and practice listening.\n\nSarah Jerome\n\nAssistant Women's Soccer Coach\n\nPRAYER\n\nLord,\n\nHelp us to clear a space for you and for your son this holiday season. Teach us to listen and trust in Your will.\n\nSpend a minute – or as much time as you can spare – in silence and just listen\n\nAmen.\n\nDecember 21 Reflection\n\nTHE BIRTH OF CHRIST\n\nBy Alfred Tennyson\n\nThe time draws near the birth of Christ;\n\nThe moon is hid—the night is still; The Christmas bells from hill to hill\n\nAnswer each other in the mist.\n\nFour voices of four hamlets round,\n\nFrom far and near, on mead and moor,\n\nSwell out and fail, as if a door Were shut between me and the sound.\n\nEach voice four changes on the wind,\n\nThat now dilate and now decrease, Peace and good-will, good-will and peace,\n\nPeace and good-will to all mankind.\n\nRise, happy morn! rise, holy morn! Draw forth the cheerful day from night; O Father! touch the east, and light The light that shone when hope was born!\n\nPRAYER\n\nLord, Creator, as the time draws near, let me hear Your voice. Let me be an instrument of peace and good will this season.\n\nDecember 22 Reflection\n\nJesus is the reason for the season!\n\nThe advent calendar is winding down and we are getting closer to Christmas. As we finish up our Christmas lists and complete our last minute shopping, we begin to turn our heads towards the real reason for the season. It is about family and fellowship and most of all, it is about the love our LORD has for us. Be sure this year to be even more vigilant to show the love to our young ones and direct our young ones to Jesus.\n\nIn the scripture reading for today, Hannah brought her son Samuel to a temple in Shiloh and proclaimed that she is praying to the lord for her son and praying that her son will dedicate his life to the LORD. As adults we may tend to focus on the glitz and glam of Christmas as well as the excitement of giving the perfect gift that you have searched high and low for.\n\nRemember that our Lord has already given the greatest gift of all in the form of Jesus. Leading our young people to Jesus and guiding them to an authentic relationship with the LORD is the greatest gift you could give.\n\nI pray that you all have a happy and healthy new year and that this time with your loved ones is well spent. Merry Christmas!\n\nOzzie Brown\n\nHead Coach, Men's and Women's Track and Field\n\nPRAYER\n\nAs Christmas draws near, let us continue to focus on the real reason for the season: Our Lord. Help us to guide others to You this season.\n\nDecember 23 Reflection\n\nToday’s gospel describes the vivid scene of the meeting of two women, one visiting and the other welcoming. The older of the two, called a cousin, but by age, probably more like an aunt, is a daughter of the priestly clan and the wife of a priest. The younger is betrothed to be married, but recently received the disturbing news of being with child. It had troubled her and caused her to ponder deeply.\n\nWe often think that Mary went to visit Elizabeth because Elizabeth was pregnant after many years of being barren. But perhaps it was much more the unwed Mary seeking out a woman whom she respected, who was older, and who obviously had deep spiritual roots, in whom she could confide and from whom she could seek guidance in terms of her life.\n\nThen without discussion and without judgement Elizabeth cries out in affirmation. She affirms Mary and affirms the child that Mary bears. Empowered by this affirmation, Mary sings out her Magnificat.\n\nChristmas affords us all a great opportunity to affirm one another just as our humanity has been affirmed by God. May this gift of unqualified affirmation move us all to make of our Christmas gift-giving a means to recognize and affirm that the recipients are important to us. When we imbue our gift-giving with this kind of meaning, it becomes our affirmation that our children, spouses, relatives and friends are unconditionally loved and valued by us and by God.\n\nFr. John Sivalon, M.M.\n\nDirector of International Learning Programs\n\nPRAYER\n\nGod of our salvation- help us to recognize Your Spirit animating the entire human family. Help us imbue our gift giving with unconditional love so that their recipients may know how much they are loved by God.\n\nDecember 24 Reflection\n\nThe word Advent comes from the Latin word “adventus” which means coming. We use Advent to anticipate the coming of Christ and ready ourselves for this important event in the calendar.\n\nBut what is “coming” for a college student at this time is a different important calendar event. It is a clutter of exams, papers and presentations, all of which make reflection a challenge. The Advent season for a college student gets lost in the completion of the Fall semester. Our heads fill with anxiety over finals or papers, nerves about grades and the anticipation of returning home. Honestly, it is not a very reflective time for me. It becomes hard to appreciate this time of year and I find myself wishing my way to the end rather than stopping to clear a space.\n\nThis rushing to the end reminds me of a popular writing by the Jesuit Paleontologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. He writes:\n\nWe are quite naturally impatient in everything to reach the end without delay. We should like to skip the intermediate stages. We are impatient of being on the way to something unknown, something new. And yet as the law of all progress that it is made by passing through some stages of instability – and that it may take a very long time.\n\nTo me, this is my unintentional approach to Advent. I rush impatiently to reach the end. However, something remarkable happens and suddenly everything stops. The papers are in and the exams over. Now is the time to relax and reflect on this important “coming.” Like Chardin encourages, we should “accept the anxiety of feeling [ourselves] in suspense and incomplete.” Whether that is accepting the anxiety of finals week or accepting the suspense of the Advent season, I encourage you to soak in that feeling of being incomplete on this Christmas Eve. This feeling helps to remind me that Christmas completes the incomplete and ends our suspense. That’s what I’m reflecting on this Christmas Eve.\n\nVirginia Farrell '20\n\nHistory Major\n\nPRAYER\n\nLord, help us remember that Christmas completes the incomplete. Help us slow down and let go of anxieties. For we know that Advent is done and Your coming is here.\n\nDecember 25 Reflection\n\nGift better than Himself God doth not know,\n\nGift better than his God no man can see;\n\nThis gift doth here the giver given bestow,\n\nGift to this gift let each receiver be:\n\nGod is my gift, Himself he freely gave me,\n\nGod’s gift am I, and none but God shall have me.\n\nThese lines, taken from Saint Robert Southwell’s poem The Nativity of Christ, remind us of why we observe the tradition of gift giving on Christmas day. Southwell underscores the greatest gift that all of us receive today and every day: the presence of God in our lives and in our world. During the holidays, we imitate God’s daily act in his gift of his Son to us by giving gifts to one other. These Christmas gifts are tokens of our love and, no matter how significant or special they are, each one pales in comparison to the gift of God’s unconditional Love, which we celebrate in a special way today.\n\nGod’s unconditional Love moves us toward gratitude, the most fundamental of Ignatian virtues. At The University of Scranton, animated by the charism of Ignatius Loyola, we have a profound understanding of how blessed we are. We are blessed to share in the sacred work of education. We are blessed with incomparable colleagues and collaborators. We are blessed with the opportunity to cooperate with God in shaping souls, hearts and minds. On this Christmas day let us pray for and with each other asking for an even deeper appreciation for the gifts we receive from God uniquely here on this good ground.\n\nOn behalf of the University I wish you all a blessed Christmas and a Happy New Year.\n\nScott R. Pilarz, S.J.\n\nUniversity President\n\nFeb. 14 Reflection\n\nI’ll never forget an exchange I had in my catechism class with a Bronx teenager on Ash Wednesday 1995. It went something like this:\n\n“Yo, Brother Pat (that’s what the students called me back then), why do we put these ashes on our foreheads? They make me look dirty!”\n\nI agreed and responded accordingly: “Well, they’re supposed to make us look dirty because that is what our bodies will all become one day: dirt!”\n\nMy student’s question about this annual ritual was both fair and correct. The ashes do make us look a bit untidy and dirty. I offer as proof of that assessment the numerous times I’ve had complete strangers approach me on Ash Wednesday, tissues in hand, and sheepishly remark out of the side of their mouths that I have some dirt on my face and that I might want to wipe it off!\n\nBy marking our foreheads with an ashen cross we remember two important aspects of our Christian faith. First, the ashes themselves remind us that we are mortal and that we will die (remember man, remember woman, that you are dust and to dust you shall return). Ashes signify death, but when they are placed on our bodies for all to see, they tell the world that we who carry that “dirty little mark” on our foreheads realize that we are mortal and in need of a savior. Second, the ashes taking the form of a cross is significant because it reminds us that Jesus’ Passion, death, and resurrection covers our mortality and brings us to eternal life. The ashes are a mark of repentance, a sign of hope for the future, and a signal of our community’s renewed awakening to a deeper spiritual reality and a closer communion with God.\n\nRev. Patrick D. Rogers, S.J.\n\nExecutive Director of TheJesuit Center\n\nFeb. 15 Reflection\n\nFasting during Lent, along with many traditions, has changed as I have grown from a small child to the college student I am today. As a child, fasting seemed like a horrible burden and something created to take the fun out of life. No Xbox? No candy? No soda? No chicken-wing pizza on Fridays? That is a recipe for a frustrated pre-teen. As I got older, however, fasting began to take on a new meaning.\n\nWith age, I realized that fasting gives us a sense of personal responsibility. Obviously, something as simple as giving up Starbursts or Instagram for Lent doesn’t come close to comparing to the suffering Jesus underwent, but the mere action of abstaining from something we enjoy gives us a glimpse of his suffering. As simple as it may seem, actively avoiding what I gave up each year makes me reflect on the deeper meaning and purpose of Lent.\n\nI have come to understand that Lent is not meant to bother me by preventing me from enjoying some of my favorite things; rather, it is more a time of self-reflection. Lent gives me an opportunity to assess what I need to do to better myself as a Christian and as a person.\n\nJake Brown '21\n\nBiology Major\n\nFeb. 16 Reflection\n\nFasting God’s Way\n\nHow many times do we give up something tangible for Lent without considering whether the exercise of fasting, in and of itself, brings us closer to God?\n\nToday’s reading, from the Book of Isaiah, reminds us that fasting while continuing divisive and sinful behaviors is of no real value. Rather, the changes that we must strive for are as much about what we are doing as they are about what we are not doing. The 40 days of Lent give us time to dwell on the idea that the love of God permeates each interaction with those who walk the Earth with us. We are called to channel God’s love by ministering to the oppressed, sharing what we have with the homeless and hungry, and forgiving others for the faults we see in them. It is also a time to learn how to give up the things that bind us into our own faults, and to pray that others can forgive those faults in us.\n\nWe are reminded that we are called to engage in deep reflection and to cultivate a contrite and humble heart. We are to give ourselves over to the love of the Almighty, to allow the Divine to work through us so that we can be the hands of God on Earth, reaching the oppressed, the broken, and lonely. We are called to give up our fear of moving into the darkest places to bring light. We are asked to trust that even in our own brokenness, we are worthy of God’s love and capable of sharing that love with others.\n\nIndeed, Lent can be more for us than a time of avoiding certain things. It can be forty days of learning how to live into an entirely new way of being.\n\nPatricia Wright, Ph.D.\n\nFaculty, Department of Nursing\n\nFeb. 17 Reflection\n\nIn today’s Gospel reading (LK 5:27-32), Jesus responds to the question of why he would eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners, saying, “Those who are healthy do not need a physician, but the sick do. I have not come to call the righteous to repentance, but the sinners.”\n\nDo we see others with compassion, or are we quick to judge?\n\nI vividly remember chaperoning a service trip and watching as one of our college students demonstrated the love and acceptance God asks of us. This trip, sponsored by the Center for Service and Social Justice, enabled our students to travel to the Father McKenna Center in Washington, D.C. This nonprofit social service agency serves the poor and homeless of the area in an effort to carry on the work of the late Rev. Horace McKenna, S.J., who was known as the \"priest to the poor.\"\n\nA special part of that day was when each of our students was paired with one of the men visiting the homeless shelter. The pairs were asked to talk to each other for about ten minutes, in order to get to know each other well enough to introduce one another to the larger group of about 100 homeless men and 12 students.\n\nOne of our students, Erica, proudly introduced us to her conversation partner, Tyrone. Even though Erica was a young student who grew up rather sheltered in the local Scranton community, she demonstrated such enthusiasm about this experience and embraced the opportunity to meet new people.\n\nWhen it was her turn to introduce her new friend, she and her new buddy walked to the front of the room. Erica stood there proudly, next to a man whose imposing and hardened demeanor differed drastically from her own peaceful countenance.\n\nErica calmly shared with us that her new friend was recently released from prison after serving a long sentence. She told the group he was happy to be out of jail and hopeful that he could stay out of trouble. While touching his arm, Erica said, “I believe he can do this because he knows he made many mistakes, but he has learned from them.\" She continued, sharing some information about his troubled upbringing, but focused more on his desire to be a better person. And when she concluded, Erica asked us all to clap for him to show that we believed in him, too.\n\nErica made a new friend that day, and it was heartwarming to see one of our young students listen to and accept this man as someone who is like us all—a human forgiven by God for his wrongdoings and eager to live a meaningful life.\n\nThis Lenten season, let’s ask ourselves how we can see others with compassion, instead of being quick to judge them.\n\nBetty Rozelle G'84\n\nAssistant Director, Center for Career Development\n\nFeb. 18 Reflection\n\nWhat was the 40-day desert experience for Jesus and how is Lent a desert experience for us? The desert was a place of solitude, a place to spend quality time with God. Our world is a busy one, and we have the added distraction of ever-changing technology. How many of us could imagine not checking our phones for 40 minutes, let alone 40 days?\n\nLent can provide the same sort of quiet time for prayer that Jesus experienced in the desert. Jesus also fasted in the desert, which is the second Lenten practice. Fasting has always reminded me of Lent's special significance, especially on days like Ash Wednesday and Lenten Fridays. It is precisely in changing my normal routine that I am reminded to spend more time with God. Fasting or giving something up for Lent also reminds me of how much I have been given and how much I take these good things for granted. Fasting reminds me to be grateful for God’s gifts.\n\nIn addition to prayer, we are also called to preach the Gospel by living it. Helping those in need or giving alms, the third Lenten practice, is a concrete way of preaching through our actions. It shifts the focus off me because it’s not about me, and it puts the focus on loving God through helping my neighbors.\n\nYou may ask yourself why we observe Lent every year since we already know that Jesus died for us and rose from the dead. The short answer is that we humans need to be reminded of important things and we need to prepare once again for the worthy celebration of Easter.\n\nSaint Ignatius Loyola advises in the Spiritual Exercises that as we celebrate Easter, we rejoice with the joyful Risen Jesus as we ask God to make us grateful and send us out to serve Jesus and transform the world.\n\nRev. Daniel Sweeney, S.J.\n\nFaculty, Political Science\n\nFeb. 19 Reflection\n\nAfter several days of trekking Death Valley terrains and reflecting on contemplative themes, our group of 38 returned to our campsite from the Salt Flats exhausted, weary and distraught, to find an intense scene. 50 mph gusts of wind were destroying our tents, leaving us to question what would happen next. “What are we going to eat?” “Where would we sleep?” “I wonder if my things are still in that tent...” These thoughts pervaded our minds before we decided to leave our vans and enter the low visibility sand-filled atmosphere to salvage whatever was left. After a collective effort from everyone on the trip, we quickly packed our sand-filled belongings into the vans and were back on the road searching for a place of refuge from the storm that was enveloping us.\n\nAfter our encounter with mother nature, our campus minister, Fred Mercadante, made a call to Holy Spirit Parish in Las Vegas, NV, asking for help. Unsure of what their response would be because it was late in the evening, we were already drafting a backup plan in case they were not able to accommodate our large group. Without hesitation, the parishioners opened their doors and lodged every single one of us. The next morning we were greeted with a bountiful breakfast and a display of kindness and service that was truly overwhelming and inspirational.\n\n“For I was hungry and you gave me food,\n\nI was thirsty and you gave me drink,\n\na stranger and you welcomed me…”\n\nI was a witness to what it means to live the Gospel call to serve those most in need because I was one of them! The parishioners' willingness to help a group of dirty and tired Scranton retreatants still inspires me and informs my prayer life as I begin my Lenten journey. Experiences like these invite us to stop and reflect upon the moments when others have been neighbors, but it also allows us to be aware and open to the opportunities in which we can be neighbors for others.\n\nLuis Melgar '18\n\nExercise Science\n\nFeb. 20 Reflection\n\nIndifference\n\nIn the First Principle and Foundation of his Spiritual Exercises, Ignatius instructs us that “we are to use the things of this world only to the extent that they help us to praise, reverence, and serve God, and we ought to rid ourselves of the things of this world to the extent that they get in the way of this end.” These things won’t be the same for all of us, and Lent offers us a time to take inventory of the roles certain objects, habits, or thoughts play in our relationship with God. In other words, Lent can be a time when we practice thisJesuit ideal of indifference most intentionally.\n\nRead below Martha Serpas’ poem, “The Discipline of Non-Fulfillment for and after Margaret A. Farley,” which addresses the Easter season and the practice of the faith in similar ways as Ignatius did when discussing indifference.\n\nThe Discipline of Non-Fulfillment\n\nfor and after Margaret A. Farley\n\nEastertide, Margaret, and all\n\nThat we’ve given up comes back\n\nTo us at once, chicken and\n\nSausage gumbo, twelve-packs of Dixie,\n\nPicayunes, and the man-god builder\n\nOf trawl boards who frees bird dogs\n\nAnd coons from steel jaws.\n\nAt once the humid air rolls back\n\nAnd northern light pours through.\n\nGirls in pastel dresses spin, petals\n\nTo relieve pink azaleas\n\nOf carrying the day\n\nOn their own. A crowded\n\nSea of greens, innocent water\n\nWedged by shorn banks below.\n\nEastertide, Margaret, and tide\n\nMeans something different here,\n\nBut wouldn’t you say it’s the same\n\nSweeping abundance overtaking\n\nShoals and inlets, joining lake and bay,\n\nDrowning everything in between?\n\nDon’t answer. I’ll focus on some small\n\nThing, a blue heron lifting from brown stubble,\n\nLight off bleached barnacles, helicopter blades\n\nBeating the marsh into submission.\n\nNo action hero will rappel down\n\nIn camouflage or lab white\n\nTo sew together the last scraps\n\nOf duckweed and spoil, like the\n\nDiscipline of non-fulfillment,\n\nYou offered from the pulpit\n\nYears ago, as if you were explaining\n\nThe abbreviated life of dogs\n\nTo children, laying a still,\n\nFurry body down in its damp\n\nSpace and closing up the hole.\n\nby Martha Serpas\n\nfrom The Dirty Side of the Storm (W. W. Norton)\n\nTeresa Grettano, Ph.D.\n\nAssistant Professor, Dept. of English & Theatre\n\nDirector of First-Year Writing\n\nFeb. 21 Reflection\n\nHave you ever experienced something so powerful, you don’t have the words to explain it to others?\n\nMy dad once shared with me wise words he had heard from a Jesuit: “Once you get to a point where your words fail, that’s when you’ve reached the heart of the matter.”\n\nI traveled to Managua, Nicaragua last summer as part of an International Service Program (ISP) trip through Scranton’s Office of Campus Ministries. It was a powerful experience for me, and every time I contemplate what the Nicaraguan people gave me, my words fail me. I try to reflect on the generosity of the Nicaraguans, and if I let it, the gift of their kindness continues to impress and touch my heart. The house we built didn’t end up being the biggest gift given. The relationships we built with the family, the students, the workers, our bus driver, guard and translator were an even bigger gift. The patiently-translated conversations gave us a deeper connection. The hugs and laughs made it harder to leave. The children reminded us of simple happiness. The natural beauty inspired us to treat the environment better. The passion of the Nicaraguan people encouraged us to be proud of our heritage, as well. By our American standards Nicaraguans don’t have much to give in material goods. Our heads tell us they don’t have abundant possessions or wealth. That changes at the level of the heart.\n\nLet your heart be open to the possibility of gifts you have to feel to understand. Let your heart decide riches, and make sense of how you can feel so showered in blessings from people who your head tells you have little or nothing to give.\n\nThe three themes of the Lenten season are Pray, Fast & Give. Don’t reduce Lent to simply fasting from your favorite foods, refraining from meat on Fridays, and praying throughout these 40 days (though these are good things, too). Don't forget about the third theme: Give. Try to model your Lenten attitude off of the Nicaraguan people. Give, and receive, with your heart.\n\nVirginia Farrell '20\n\nArt History Major\n\nFeb. 22 Reflection\n\nThe Lord says to Simon Peter:\n\nI have prayed for you that your faith may not fail,\n\nAnd, once you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.\n\n[Entrance Antiphon]\n\nMy brother and his family live near a sheep farm and every time I drive by there I slow down so I can observe the flock. They always seem content with life – a great place to live, nourishment all over the pasture, three ponds nearby for water, and lots of companions. “They’re ok,” I say to myself, and pick up speed continuing on my way.\n\nThe sheep motif runs throughout today’s scripture: Tend the flock of God in your midst [1 Peter], The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want [Psalm 23], leading up to the Gospel of Matthew wherein Jesus calls Peter a rock, upon whom Christ will build his Church. Peter, the first Shepherd of the Church, confesses his faith in Jesus by saying: “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”\n\nEvery day in my work with our students I am reminded of the faith we all share. I see how they care for one another at choir rehearsal, or how they encourage each other in preparing to serve at liturgy. When I ask why they do what they do as music and liturgical ministers, more often than not it is because they identify with each other as members of a community of faith called by God to this place, at this time, in this moment, to serve, as Christ serves – to love, as Christ loves. What better example for ourLenten journey but to see how our students tend the flock of God in their midst, shepherd each other in Christ’s name, and call forth the building of the Church in their service to this university community of faith.\n\nI’m thinking about those sheep . . .\n\nM. Jayne Lucas\n\nDirector of Liturgy and Liturgical Music\n\nOffice of Campus Ministries\n\nFeb. 23 Reflection\n\nMy Aunt Mo & Uncle Jerry are celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary this year – God bless them! They spend most of their time in Fort Myers, Florida, with other retired people spanning states from New York to Michigan. Today it's 88 and sunny down there – life is good!\n\nTheir lives are pretty simple at this point. Mo (the fun aunt) spends her days playing tennis, chatting with “the girls” at the pool, and cracking open a few cold ones as the sun dips into the Gulf each evening. Jerry (for those older than me, picture \"The Fonz\" from Happy Days) has his Sudoku, Hot Wheels collection, Publix chicken wings, and a 2015 Mustang GT.\n\nUncle Jerry hasn’t touched a drop of booze in decades, and a few years ago he suggested that Mo give up beer for Lent. I showed up for a visit that year, and although Lent can be a great opportunity to shake up our lives a bit, change our routines, and break some habits, Mo was just not her usual, fun-loving self. We went to 5 p.m. Mass on Saturday at St. Columbkille (beats Patrick and Brigid for cool Irish saint names…) and the priest encouraged us to rethink simply giving something up for Lent. “Embrace life, enjoy those around you, & do what makes you happy.” Though I seem to recall Mo jumping out of the pew and cheering, I’m sure her response was a bit more subtle, at least until we got to the parking lot.\n\nI have always challenged my students, here and at Chaminade and Kellenberg high schools on Long Island, to think beyond giving up something relatively unimportant for Lent. Wanna give something up? How about hatred, gossip, betrayal, pettiness, cheating, excess, lying, grudges, negativity…and don’t just pick one, go big or go home – actually attempt to make a meaningful improvement in your life.\n\nWanna do something? Be yourself. Really, give it a shot – take off the masks, put aside the show, and become the truest self who you were created to be.\n\nJohn Kirrane\n\nAssistant Director, Residence Life\n\nFeb. 24 Reflection\n\nThe word \"selah\" appears 71 times in the book of psalms. Appearing at the end of individual psalms, it encourages the reader to \"pause and reflect,\" to take the time to comprehend and discern how the sacred words and messages can be incorporated into our lives.\n\nI offer this poem today as a way in which to pause and reflect - to process the magnitude of our blessed, complicated, and beautiful lives. I hope you enjoy.\n\n\"Thirst\" by Mary Oliver\n\nAnother morning and I wake with thirst\n\nfor the goodness I do not have. I walk\n\nout to the pond and all the way God has\n\ngiven us such beautiful lessons. Oh Lord,\n\nI was never a quick scholar but sulked\n\nand hunched over my books past the hour\n\nand the bell; grant me, in your mercy,\n\na little more time. Love for the earth\n\nand love for you are having such a long\n\nconversation in my heart. Who knows what\n\nwill finally happen or where I will be sent,\n\nyet already I have given a great many things\n\naway, expecting to be told to pack nothing,\n\nexcept the prayers which, with this thirst,\n\nI am slowly learning.\n\nSelah\n\nRyan Sheehan, J.D.\n\nAssistant Director, The Jesuit Center\n\nFeb. 25 Reflection\n\nAll three readings today talk about the sacrifice of a son to prove one’s love. The philosopher Kierkegaard spent his whole life reflecting on the meaning of Abraham sacrificing his son Isaac to God. Now I am no theologian who can illuminate the mystery of redemption found in these readings, but all I can tell you for sure is what the readings are not saying.\n\nIf a father gives his son the keys to a red Ferrari on graduation day and then asks him to return the keys to prove that he loves his Dad more than he loves the gifts his dad gives him, that father does not deserve to be called “Dad” in any sense of the term. No father, including God, treats their children in that manner. Whatever the stories of Abraham and the Transfiguration mean, they most certainly are not about sacrifice, but undying love.\n\nA friend from the DA’s office called me one Saturday morning about a student of mine who had been jailed for some minor offence. All he needed was his parents to post a small bail to get him out, but this student was too ashamed to call his folks. So I did, and I explained the situation to them. Of course they immediately came to rescue him and express their unconditional love for him, because that’s what parents do in imitation of God Himself. Even I, a priest with no children of my own, understand this simple fact about parental love.\n\nToday we need to ask ourselves whether we do indeed believe that God is not someone who is out to TEST us to prove ourselves, but someone who is begging us to let Him love us unconditionally. All we have to do is say “thank you” in return for this free gift.\n\nRon McKinney, S.J.\n\nPhilosophy Department\n\nFeb. 26 Reflection\n\nLet nothing disturb thee,\n\nNothing affright thee;\n\nAll things are passing;\n\nGod never changeth;\n\nPatient endurance\n\nAttaineth to all things;\n\nWho God Possessth\n\nIn nothing is wanting;\n\nAlong God Sufficeth.\n\nSt. Teresa de Ávila (1515-1582)\n\nVirgin, Mystic, Ecstatic, Reformer, Doctor of the Church\n\nFrom The Jesuit Center Staff\n\nFeb. 27 Reflection\n\nEver since I was a young girl, I loved listening to the story of Jesus washing the feet of his apostles. The way he owned his truth and served others has been a guiding lesson for me throughout my life. This story came to mind as I was reflecting on the gospel for today. In Matthew Chapter 23:1-12, Jesus said:\n\n\"Call no one on earth your father; you have but one Father in heaven. Do not be called ‘Master’; you have but one master, the Christ. The greatest among you must be your servant. Whoever exalts himself will be humbled; but whoever humbles himself will be exalted.\"\n\nWhat does this mean for us in our daily lives? Do we live in service to others and see ourselves as equals? Do we live in truth, knowing that we are all created equal in the image and likeness of God?\n\nIn 2010, I was going through a very tough time in my life. I needed to practice humility and serve others in order to reconnect with the truth of who I really am. I needed to be reminded of what is important in life. In that same year, a devastating earthquake rocked the country of Haiti and destroyed the lives of so many people. As God called me to serve, I immediately answered by going to Haiti to help in whatever way I could.\n\nAs I spent time with the people of Haiti, I saw suffering in ways I have never known before. I was humbled by their faith and honesty. As I was serving them, they were doing the same for me. Haitian people do not pretend to have more or be more than anyone else. They are secure in the knowledge that they are children of God, and that He will provide for them. They experience life as a precious gift from God, and they thank Him in so many ways…in a smile, a touch, in writing, and in song. Even in the midst of a crisis, knowing this truth allowed the people of Haiti to serve the needs of those who were there to help them.\n\nWhen I looked into the eyes of the Haitian people, I was able to see the goodness within their souls. I saw their non-pretentious, faith-filled selves. I must admit that it is not as easy to see this truth when looking into the eyes of many Americans. So many people seem to live beyond their truth and forget their real purpose in life. When people reach out to others in need, they can hear the voice of God calling them to be humble and truthful. These experiences can touch their lives and change them forever. By living in their truth, they will be humbled. This is how the world can change for the better. This is what God wants for us all.\n\nLisa A. Kozden, MOT, OTR/L, CHT, COMT\n\nFaculty Specialist, Occupational Therapy\n\nFeb. 28 Reflection\n\nWhen my children were small, I had a famous line: “When I’m talking, you’re not talking.\" In my collection of “mom-isms,” I used this one quite a bit. I recall speaking the words over their chatter…typically when trying to give directions or explain something important. “Honey, you can’t hear what I am saying if you are talking at the same time. When I’m talking, you’re NOT talking.”\n\nDuring their teenage years, important conversations typically started with, “Let’s turn the TV off.\" Silencing that distraction helped us really listen to each other and more easily hear what the other was saying.\n\nOne of my regular Lenten practices is turning the radio off in the car. At first, I started this as a way to “give something up.\" Living 50 minutes from campus, I have to admit that in the beginning it was torture. The silence can be deafening. I started using the time to talk to God. Out loud. (Yes…more than once, passersby thought I was nuts). I talked. And talked. And asked God for things. And asked God what I should do about difficult situations. And told God about things I was grateful for. And told God what I worried about.\n\nOne day, it hit me. God planted this message in my heart: “Honey, you can’t hear what I am saying if you are talking at the same time. When I’m talking, you’re NOT talking.”\n\nA few weeks ago, my oldest son came home to have dinner with me while my husband was away. We prepared a lovely meal together. I will never forget the joy I felt when he stood up from the table, picked up the remote, and turned off the TV.\n\nLet me end my reflection with this poignant saying from Mother Teresa of Calcutta:\n\n\"I shall keep the silence of my heart with greater care, so that in the silence of my heart I hear His words of comfort, and from the fullness of my heart I comfort Jesus in the distressing disguise of the poor. For in the silence and purity of the heart God speaks.\"\n\n- Mother Teresa of Calcutta\n\nLynn King Andres '89, P'17\n\nAssociate Director, Alumni & Parent Engagement\n\nMarch 1 Reflection\n\nThe season of Lent is our preparation for the most important feast of the Christian calendar, the Feast of the Resurrection of Christ. It is our Garden of Gethsemane; it is our Calvary; it is where we can forgo some of the pleasures of life to prepare ourselves completely to celebrate the joy of the feast. We prepare in many varied ways, but certainly the three main ways are by fasting, by almsgiving and by prayer.\n\nThe golden-mouthed orator Saint John Chrysostom, Archbishop of Constantinople, gave a sermon for this feast nearly 1700 years ago. It is read in most Eastern Christian churches at the end of the Vigil Liturgy each year. One small part reads as follows:\n\nIf any have toiled from the first hour,\n\nlet them receive their due reward;\n\nIf any have come after the third hour,\n\nlet him with gratitude join in the Feast!\n\nAnd he that arrived after the sixth hour,\n\nlet him not doubt; for he too shall sustain no loss.\n\nAnd if any delayed until the ninth hour,\n\nlet him not hesitate; but let him come too.\n\nAnd he who arrived only at the eleventh hour,\n\nlet him not be afraid by reason of his delay.\n\nFor the Lord is gracious and receives the last even as the first.\n\nHe gives rest to him that comes at the eleventh hour,\n\nas well as to him that toiled from the first.\n\nWe are already several weeks into our season of Lent. We may think that we have failed to fast, that we have avoided almsgiving and that we have not been living a life of prayer. There is no reason to despair, as Chrysostom tells us. Rather, we take the opportunity to begin now. We can now begin to fast, to feed the hungry, to clothe the poor, to educate the uneducated, and to get closer to God through prayer and in the liturgy of the Catholic Church. We can still reach our joy in the Resurrection by beginning now at the middle of the fast. We, as Christians, should not judge those who have joined late, nor should we feel superior for having begun at an earlier time; rather, we should welcome them on this path and give them all the support we can..\n\nLent is more than simply a season of preparation for a single feast. It is analogous to our life here on Earth. In our lives, we have sufferings and joys, times of feast and times of famine, times when we remain close to God and times when we fall away. But just as Chrysostom says for the Feast of the Resurrection, so it is true for our lives. If we have fallen, if we have failed to love our neighbor, to share our blessings, to avoid sin, to live a life of prayer, then God still shall give rest to those who have toiled only from the eleventh hour. Lent reminds us, no matter what hour of our lives that we happen to be in, that we still have time to live the life that we want to live, to live a life that brings us closer to God. We still have time to fast, to give alms, to pray, to forgive, to seek out God. As Lent prepares us for the joy of the Resurrection, so our life prepares us for the ultimate joy when we see God face to face.\n\nSteven Dougherty, Ph.D.\n\nProfessor of Mathematics\n\nMarch 2 Reflection\n\nDuring Lent, I’ll occasionally be interviewing some of the young women and men who participate in the liturgical life of our community. Today’s offering comes from Harry Helbock, a senior communication major in the College of Arts and Sciences and a long-time lector on our campus.\n\nFr. Patrick: So, Harry, how and when did you get involved with the ministry of lecturing? Was that something you started here at Scranton?\n\nHarry: No, I grew up in a house where participation at Mass as liturgical ministers was normal. My dad is a lector and my mom is a Eucharistic minister so that was just a part of how my family gave back to the Church. I began my participation in liturgy as an altar server when I was a boy, and when I was a junior in high school I began to lector at my parish’s weekly youth Mass.\n\nFr. Patrick: What kind of lector training did you receive once you got to the U?\n\nHarry: Well, I contacted our Director of Liturgy, Jayne Lucas, and she met with me to go over the responsibilities of a lector and also listened to me read passages of scripture, and then gave me feedback about pacing and volume and such.\n\nFr. Patrick: How do you prepare for the liturgy when you are assigned to read the scriptures? As you know, some of those Old Testament names are pretty difficult to pronounce!\n\nHarry: Yeah, I know they are, so that’s why you have to get there early and carefully look over the readings to make sure that any names you don’t understand can be worked out. I also like to read the scriptures out loud to myself to practice. It is really important that the readings are proclaimed well and that’s why you’ve got to practice.\n\nFr. Patrick: How has being a lector changed you spiritually?\n\nHarry: Now that I’m in college I’ve really learned how to take it all in and really internalize what is being said in that scripture passage. When I was younger, I was focused more on not making any big mistakes and proclaiming the Word well. I still want to do a good job, but now that I have more experience, I understand scripture better and can see connections that I didn’t see when I was younger.\n\nFr. Patrick: On the lighter side, what’s the funniest thing that has happened to you as a lector?\n\nHarry: Well, one time, as I was getting up to read, I tripped over myself and almost took a really bad fall right there in the main aisle! I caught myself though and just kept on going!\n\nFr. Patrick: What do you like about being a lector?\n\nHarry: I love being able to do something for the Church. I’ve grown a lot spiritually here at the U through personal prayer and retreats, but lecturing for me is about giving back to the community and giving witness to my peers by participating.\n\nRev. Patrick D. Rogers, S.J.\n\nExecutive Director, The Jesuit Center\n\nMarch 3 Reflection\n\nLent is often seen as a spring cleaning for the soul – an opportunity to renew our relationship with God and the Church. We recognize our sinfulness, our mortality, and seek the mercy of our Creator.\n\nIf the past 24 hours have taught me anything, it is that spring will not arrive simply because we think we are ready for it! I was already looking outwards, towards the warmer weather, and preparing for the next season: cleaning branches off the lawn, sweeping the driveway, putting the shovels in the shed – not to mention the not-so-gentle daily ooshings of the kids to stop jumping up and down on the sofas and to get out of the house!\n\nBut here we are again, confined to our homes, with swirling winds and snow stirring up outside. The winds will calm soon enough and the snow will melt, but not before a little more work is completed. The Spirit sent us a not-so-subtle reminder that we have to get our own homes in order before we venture out – before we look to the next season. We cannot rush the end simply because we think it will be easier, warmer, and less harsh. It is not how our spiritual lives work.\n\nReading the story of the Prodigal Son in today’s Gospel, the three main characters remind us of several (avoiding lengthy exegesis) simple truths during Lent.\n\nWe must take the time to repent as did the older son. We must look to God and ask for forgiveness. And we must avoid the bitterness and self-exclusion of the older brother and offer forgiveness where it is needed, including forgiving ourselves.\n\nSoon enough we will rejoice with the risen Jesus. But for now there is still snow in the yard and work to be done in the house.\n\nEaster is not here…not yet.\n\nRyan Sheehan, J.D.\n\nAssistant Director, The Jesuit Center\n\nMarch 4 Reflection\n\nThe Good News for Lent is what Paul preaches, the crucifixion of Jesus. It is the way that His Sacred Heart deals with man’s failure to love Him as He loves us. And His way is our way to deal with the failure to love, whether the failure is our own or that of others. For He is The Way. He allows His feet to be nailed so that He does not run away from those who hurt Him in hurting themselves by their lack of love.\n\nHe allows His hands to be nailed so that the unloving need not fear that He will hurt them in return. Rather, His arms are held open, waiting to embrace the ones He loves. Nor do His hands cover His Sacred Heart to protect His life. So His Sacred Heart is pierced and His life is poured out to overwhelm with love those who are lacking in love. To overcome the death of love, water is poured out to Baptize, to exchange birth into the love life of God for what is missing in the ones He loves. And for the nourishment of the new love life is poured out His Life, His Precious Blood, the medium of the message “Let anyone who thirsts come to me and drink.” (John, 7:37) His Sacred Heart gives the life that is present in His Body, His flesh that we eat in the Holy Eucharist, Holy Thanksgiving returning His Love. But His feet are nailed so that He cannot come to us to give us His Body, the Daily Bread that we pray for in the Our Father.\n\nDo we hunger enough for His love to come to Him to receive daily the complete union with Him in His Love of Our Father? Do we fully accept the gift of His Sacred Heart which is the result of His crucifixion? Can we resist not only being loved into existence at every moment but being drawn into the Sacred Heart’s sharing with those He loves, the Holy Spirit, His love of Our Father?\n\nRev. J. Patrick Mohr, S.J.\n\nProfessor, Department of Philosophy\n\nMarch 5 Reflection\n\nOn March 3rd 1868, Blessed Pope Pius IX signed the decree that marked the beginning of the Diocese of Scranton.\n\nYesterday afternoon, the Diocese marked its 150th Anniversary with a special Mass at the Cathedral of St. Peter. Today, let us offer up a special prayer for the Diocese of Scranton and ask for God’s continued blessings on all of its parishes, missions and works.\n\nFrom the Jesuit Center Staff\n\nMarch 6 Reflection\n\nDear Friends,\n\nAs we celebrate the sesquicentennial anniversary of the Diocese of Scranton, let us take a moment to offer a prayer of thanksgiving for all the blessings we’ve received from the Diocese, especially our profound connection with its bishops.\n\nOur current bishop has personal ties of affection to the University and at one time took graduate theology classes here. He also served on our Board of Trustees. So today, let us offer up a prayer for our chief shepherd and spiritual leader, the Most Reverend Joseph C. Bambera, D.D., J.C.L., Tenth Bishop of Scranton.\n\nRev. Patrick D. Rogers, S.J.\n\nMarch 7 Reflection\n\nToday’s reflection comes as a result of an interview I did with senior lacrosse player Timmy Gray '18.\n\nThroughout our conversation, I asked Timmy to reflect on questions pertaining to the blessings and challenges of being formed in the Ignatian charism that is a hallmark of a University of Scranton education. For student-athletes at the University, this formation program is called “The Royal Way.” It helps them strive for excellence on and off their place of competition while forming them to be women and men of good conscience and character.\n\nTimmy Gray '18 is an Exercise Science major and a goalie on our men’s lacrosse team.\n\nFr. Patrick: So, Timmy, what is “The Royal Way?”\n\nTimmy: It’s a program for all athletes here at the University, and it's a program that helps student-athletes come together as a team through the building-up of character. “The Royal Way” is not only about competing hard and giving it your best shot every day, but about how we do things on our teams. One of the touchstones of “The Royal Way” states, “We demand mutual respect, tough love and total care from one another.” Those values are hard to live up to sometimes, but they remind us that doing the right thing, while it is often very tough, is worth it in the end.\n\nFr. Patrick: Does every student-athlete have to participate?\n\nTimmy: Yeah, as far as I know every athlete signs the large “Royal Way” Touchstone poster at the beginning of the year and in doing so pledges to do their best to live up to these high ideals. That signed document hangs in the Long Center gym, which is great because everyone in our community can see it. When I look at it I am reminded that we are called to seek the magis (the more) in all that we do because we represent more than ourselves or our team, we represent our community.\n\nFr. Patrick: Is there one aspect of “The Royal Way” that you find particularly appealing?\n\nTimmy: Yes, and it’s the last part. At the bottom of the document, it says, “Wherever we go, whatever we do- WE ARE ROYALS.” I feel blessed to represent the University and am honored to wear a Scranton uniform because we really are one community.\n\nFr. Patrick: How do you and your team engage “The Royal Way?”\n\nTimmy: Well, we often talk about Jesuit values in our team meetings and, like all the other teams here at the University, we do community service. We regularly participate in the Thanksgiving Food Drive run by the Friends of the Poor, and the guys love it. “The Royal Way” is much more than community service, though, because we want to honor God in all that we do. Think about it - we are able to put AMDG (Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam, For the Greater Glory of God) on our basketball court and on our jerseys! We can literally wear our values on our sleeves, and that means a lot to me.\n\nFr. Patrick: What value represented in “The Royal Way” most resonates with you?\n\nTimmy: That’s easy: “We compete with an attitude of gratitude and greatness, striving to win each day our way.\" As a senior, I’m grateful for all that I have because I know that I didn’t get to where I am on my own. My parents, coaches, friends, and teammates have all helped shape me as a person. Competing with my teammates is great because they are awesome guys, and I feel blessed to be on the team.\n\nFr. Patrick: Thanks for sharing your thoughts, Timmy. Good luck with the season!\n\nTimmy: Thanks, Fr. Patrick!\n\nMarch 8 Reflection\n\nSimple Prayer for the Midway Point of Lent\n\nMay we give up noise -pray- so as to enter into deeper prayer for ourselves and the life of the world.\n\nMay we give up food and consuming -fast- so that others may eat and have something at all.\n\nMay we give up judgment, sarcasm, the unkind word or remark\n\n-give instead- a word to lift us up and get us through it all.\n\nFrom the Jesuit Center Staff\n\nMarch 9 Reflection\n\nToday marks the 450th anniversary of the birth of Saint Aloysius Gonzaga, S.J. Because he died giving care to plague victims at the age of 23, Aloysius is the patron saint of students and youth, Jesuit Scholastics, plague victims and AIDS victims and caregivers.\n\nTo mark this milestone, the Society of Jesus begins today a Jubilee Year to honor this great saint and patron of youth. Fr. General Sosa, S.J., has invited the whole Society, including its communities and institutions, to find ways to celebrate St. Aloysius’ life by drawing attention to the rich contributions young people bring to society, the Church and the Society of Jesus. Read Fr. Sosa's Invitation Here\n\nTo begin our jubilee year, I asked Brian Kilner '20 (a graduate of Gonzaga High School in Washington, D.C.) to offer his thoughts about St. Aloysius Gonzaga.\n\nEnjoy,\n\nFr. Patrick\n\nMarch 10 Reflection\n\nRev. Patrick D. Rogers, S.J., sits down with Elizabeth Dugan '18, Occupational Therapy major and Psychology minor, to discuss her experience as a cantor.\n\nFr. Patrick: Hi, Elizabeth, it’s good to have you here at the Jesuit Center. So, let’s get down to brass tacks … when did you first begin to cantor at Masses? Were you in high school or here at the Univeristy?\n\nElizabeth: Actually, I first began to cantor at my home parish when I was in the sixth grade.\n\nFr. Patrick: Wow, that’s really awesome and a lot of responsibility for a young person, so good for you! Since you’ve been participating as a cantor for some time now, do you have a special way of preparing yourself to lead us in song on Sunday?\n\nElizabeth: I prepare for a Sunday liturgy by attending the music ministry’s weekly rehearsals. If there are hymns or psalms that I am not familiar with I will take pictures of the music and record the song while we are practicing so I can go back and listen to it. I also find myself randomly singing songs that are in the Masses during the week, as corny as that may be, especially if it is a hymn that really strikes a chord with me or one that I really enjoy.\n\nFr. Patrick: Has singing at Mass helped you grow in your spiritual life? If so, how?\n\nElizabeth: Singing at Mass has definitely impacted and supported my spiritual life. I have realized that singing the hymns is having a conversation with God, just like praying. For me, the combination of music and scripture helps to foster my spiritual growth. I have been able to see in different theology classes how many scripture passages have inspired artists in their music and how the scripture is incorporated and used in the music played at Masses.\n\nFr. Patrick: I don’t know if you’ve heard this, but the great St. Augustine is given credit for saying, \"Those who sing pray twice.\" How do you encourage your fellow students to PRAY MORE, i.e., sing at Mass?\n\nElizabeth: One thing I always try to do is smile whenever possible. Also, last semester I read \"Why Catholics Can’t Sing\" by Thomas Day for my Intro to Christian Worship course. In that book, Mr. Day explains that cantors should back off of the microphone when they hear that the congregation has a strong communal sound. I have started trying to implement this technique and have noticed a difference in the congregation’s participation in singing during Masses.\n\nFr. Patrick: All of us have had funny things happen to us during Mass. Can you share with us one of your funny moments?\n\nElizabeth: One funny moment happened last year. I remember looking at the microphone before Mass and thinking it looked kind of loose. Later, toward the middle of the Mass, the microphone fell out of the stand and onto the floor with a big thud! I continued with the Mass parts without the microphone and just pretended like it was there until I could pick it up before the communion hymn. It was a very interesting Mass that Sunday!\n\nFr. Patrick: Thanks for taking the time to tell our University Community about you singing ministry, Elizabeth. Enjoy your spring break and I’ll see you in a week or two!\n\nElizabeth: Thanks, Father. I hope you have a great break as well!\n\nMarch 11 Reflection\n\nA SPIRITUAL EXERCISE FOR LENT\n\nIt strikes me that today’s Second Reading, from the Letter to the Ephesians (2.4-10), fits fruitfully together with the Contemplation on the Incarnation (#101-109) in the Spiritual Exercises. St. Ignatius bids us imagine Father, Son, and Holy Spirit taking a long look at the world, seeing humanity’s self-destructive course, and deciding, “Let us work the redemption of the human race.” \"Work\" is the word that then connects creation, redemption, resurrection and salvation as God’s Plan, his \"Handiwork\" proclaimed in Ephesians as follows for our meditation:\n\n“It’s a wonder God didn’t lose his temper and do away with the whole lot of us. Instead, immense in mercy and with an incredible love, he embraced us. He took our sin-dead lives and made us alive in Christ. He did this all on his own, with no help from us! Then he picked us up and set us down in highest heaven in company with Jesus, our Messiah.\n\nNow God has us where he wants us, with all the time in this world and the next to shower grace and kindness upon us in Christ Jesus. Saving is all his idea, and all his work. All we do is trust him enough to let him do it. It’s God’s gift from start to finish! We don’t play the major role. If we did, we’d probably go around bragging that we’d done the whole thing! No, we neither make nor save ourselves. God does both the making and the saving. He creates each of us by Christ Jesus to join him in the work he does, the good work he has gotten ready for us to do, work we had better be doing.”\n\n(Excerpt from The Message New Testament)\n\nFr. James Redington, S.J.\n\nJesuit Center Fellow\n\nMarch 12 Reflection\n\nThe conversation between Jesus and the father in today’s Gospel is fascinating and rather strange. The father begs Jesus to help his dying son. Jesus’ response seems impatient, somewhat irritable. “You people...” he says, “you people won’t believe unless you see signs and miracles.” Doesn’t this seem a bit harsh? The father hasn’t seen signs and miracles, and he’s not there to ask for some proof that will make him believe. He just wants his son not to die. He has left him, knowing he might never see him alive again, and traveled for at least a day because he thinks that Jesus can save him. Surely he wouldn’t have done that unless he did believe? But he hasn’t got time to argue with Jesus – “what do you mean? I’m here, aren’t I?” He just wants help for his kid. So he ignores Jesus’ rebuff and repeats: “If we don’t hurry, he’ll die – please, let’s go!”\n\nJesus says, “Go home; your boy is going to be fine,” and the father doesn’t argue, he doesn’t insist that Jesus needs to be there; he believes him, John says, and he does as he’s told and heads home. Again, doesn’t this look like belief? Wasn’t Jesus being too hard on him with his “you people . . .?” But then the father meets his servants, hurrying to him with the good news. He learns that the fever turned just when he was with Jesus . . . It seems that the timing qualifies his son’s healing as a “sign and a wonder” because then, John tells us, then he believes.\n\nBelief, it would seem, isn’t a simple proposition: either you believe or you don’t, case closed. Like the father’s, our faith is a complicated thing, a layering of need, of hope, of trust, of experience, of conviction. Jesus knows what a mess our faith is, how unsimple, how tangled. Sometimes we believe because we want to, or need to, or because it gives us something to hang-on to. Sometimes we believe because we are compelled to, or because something meets our standards for an adequate reason to believe. Like the father’s, if we are willing to risk the journey towards Jesus, our faith can begin as grasping at straws and grow into something that can draw in those around us.\n\nLent, when we try to get clear of some of the jumble of our lives, can be a time to look at our faith in the company of Jesus, who knows all about its tangled messiness, and who always wants to show us the truth about ourselves, and to heal us.\n\nDr. Maria Poggi Johnson\n\nFaculty, Theology and Religious Studies\n\nMarch 13 Reflection\n\nJust as water brings life to all areas of the world, so too does God’s love bring new life to the people of the world.\n\nIn the first reading today we see Ezekiel being led by an angel around the temple, from which water is trickling. As the angel measures around the temple, Ezekiel finds himself in deeper and deeper water, until a river has formed. The angel tells Ezekiel, “wherever the river flows, every sort of living creature that can multiply shall live.”\n\nIn the Gospel reading Jesus visits a pool where many sick people are gathered. Jesus finds one man, who has been sick for 38 years, and tells him to “Rise, take your mat, and walk.” However, because it was the Sabbath the man was not allowed to carry his mat, and so he was questioned as to who told him to do so. When the man eventually tells people that it was Jesus who had healed him and told him to carry the mat, the people began to persecute Jesus.\n\nLent is often seen as a dry spell. Fasting, giving things up, and the somber mood at Mass as we lead up to the Passion and death of Jesus. But, come Easter, the floodgates are open and the Risen Christ brings salvation to the world! God’s love can heal us, make us grow, and help us thrive and multiply. We see throughout the Gospel readings during Lent that Jesus shows his love for the poor and sick by performing miracles and teaching, even though with it comes the scorn of the authorities and people that would eventually put him to death. That’s how greatly God’s love flows out to all of us. Let us use this time to wade a little deeper into the water and immerse ourselves in it.\n\nJoseph Sorbera, III '08\n\nMember, Alumni Society Advisory Board\n\nMarch 14 Reflection\n\nAs the Gospel says, \"Amen, amen, I say to you, the Son cannot do anything on his own.\" Why is it that people today either do not believe in God, or think they do not need Him in their lives? There is a great deal of chaos in our daily lives and life tends to get busier all the time. It seems as though people do not make the time for God. Our God is a loving God who knows our every move before we do, and yet people still do not believe. Even Jesus Himself says in the Gospel quote mentioned above that He \"cannot do anything on his own,\" yet somehow we, as humans, think that we can.\n\nSome people tend to turn to God when they are going through a difficult time, whether it be the loss of employment or the loss of a loved one. Yet, when time passes and they think everything is OK again, they no longer need God in their lives. Seemingly, they only seek God when it is convenient for them or during troubled times. Apparently, they do not think about the \"day of resurrection\" when we are accountable for ourselves.\n\nIn my opinion, I think that everyone should make the most of every day, be kind to others, help others whenever/wherever they can, be the best people our good Lord made them to be, and utilize the talents our good Lord has blessed them with.\n\nThere’s one other saying that I would like to reference – “Let go and let God” – but do NOT let go of God!\n\nMaryAnn Maslar\n\nOffice Manager, College of Arts and Sciences Dean's Office\n\nMarch 15 Reflection\n\nA few years ago, I arrived home after a long, busy day at the University and found a small package that had come with that day’s mail. The return address told me that my best and dearest college friend had sent me a surprise, but hadn’t mentioned that something would be arriving. What I unwrapped that night was a small plaque, which reads: “Good friends are like stars – you don’t always see them but you know they’re always there.” In the quietness of this Spring Break week, as I thought about the readings for this day, I walked to my kitchen and saw that little plaque yet again, not even knowing at this point how many times I have relied on that simple message as a reminder of a special friendship. Moreover, in a mere ten days we will commemorate Palm Sunday and begin our annual Holy Week reflections, leading us to the joy and hope embodied in our Lord’s Resurrection at Easter. As I think ahead to these closing rituals of Lent, I now see powerful stories in which friendship is tested and its challenges are underscored, as fundamental lessons in our Christian faith. How quickly those lessons and revelations are approaching, even if we see inevitable hints about them, as today’s readings suggest.\n\nIn our first reading from Exodus, we encounter Moses, one of our God’s best friends in the Old Testament. Moses desperately tries to convince God not to take His wrath out on those wayward, misguided, depraved Israelites, after they had made “for themselves a molten calf” and proceeded to worship and make sacrifices to it, as if it was their God! Incredibly, Moses must remind God of that indelible covenant of friendship made previously to “your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and how you swore to them by your own self, saying, ‘I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in sky; and all this land that I promised, I will give your descendants as their perpetual heritage.’” Yes, those very stars (and a bit of land) ultimately symbolize the promise of everlasting friendship and love between us and God, even if some really abhorrent human behavior at times causes us to lose sight of that bond, at least temporarily.\n\nToday’s Gospel reading is from John’s fifth chapter. In it we encounter Jesus chastising Jewish leaders for not accepting that He performed miracles as testimony of the fact “that the Father has sent me” to finish His Father’s work. Jesus had just healed the invalid at the Pool of Bethesda, and very shortly would be persecuted to death. Those same Jewish leaders would argue that Jesus not only performed miracles on the Sabbath (violating the Law of Moses), but claimed to do so supposedly in the name of some “Father.” We know that Jesus was referencing the same God who Moses befriends and with whom Mos"
