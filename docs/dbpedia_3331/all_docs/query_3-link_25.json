        "text": "What if the normal, bustling streets you walked or drove down every day hid a secret world full of mystery and magic? What if the world you and I know is only a thin veneer hiding monsters and organizations dedicated to hunting them?\n\nThatâs the allure of urban fantasy: taking what we are all familiar with and asking âWhat if?â\n\nItâs a combination of the mundane and the magical, and it makes for some of the most exciting stories in modern literature (at least, in my humble opinionâ¦ as an urban fantasy author and reader).\n\nUrban fantasy also gives us the opportunity to explore timeless themes in a contemporary setting, something that epic fantasy, dark fantasy, and science fantasy canât do. It is truly unique in its substance.\n\nAnd weâre going to talk all about how you can bring your urban fantasy story to life. That includes:\n\nUnderstanding this awesome subgenre\n\nBuilding an urban fantasy world\n\nCreating characters\n\nComing up with a great urban fantasy plot\n\nSome tips to remember and common mistakes to avoid\n\nUrban fantasy is a subgenre with avid fans who love to read a lot. If you have a story idea that combines the magical and modern, youâre in the right place.\n\nUnderstanding the Urban Fantasy Subgenre\n\nBefore we get too far into this article, letâs come up with a solid grasp of what urban fantasy really is.\n\nHere is a pretty clinical definition:\n\nUrban fantasy is a subgenre of fantasy set primarily in a real-world urban environment where magical elements coexist with the modern world.\n\nâUrbanâ means relating to or characteristic of a town or city, which means most novels in this subgenre donât take place in a country or rural setting. Thatâs not to say smaller towns canât be your primary setting or your characters canât venture out to a farmhouse or forest, but those arenât the most common settings in this subgenre.\n\nTo expand on our clinical definition, here are some key elements and common traits of successful urban fantasy novels.\n\nMagic in Modern Settings\n\nThis is the hallmark of urban fantasy. Magic is not confined to the mages of ancient castles or the dark cults dancing in the woods under a blood moon; it thrives in the bustling streets, hidden alleys, and everyday locations of modern life.\n\nIn most urban fantasy, magic goes unnoticed by the mundane world, though there are plenty of instances where it is public knowledge. Either way, magic is integrated into society, whether itâs noticed or not.\n\nThis parallel world is often referred to as âthe secret world,â âthe world beneath,â and so on.\n\nUrban Environments\n\nLike I mentioned, urban fantasy takes place in urban locations (or at least semi-urban places or a town). Cities arenât usually just backdrops to the story but integral to it. The city itself, more than most genres, influences the plot, themes, and characters.\n\nThe reason cities are chosen over rural areas, in part, is because of the contrast they can create with the magical elements of your story. Again, weâre drawing on that familiarity of modern life and saying, âHold up, thereâs dazzling spells and cursed artifacts in the middle of a shopping mall.â\n\nMost urban fantasy settings are real-life metropolises, like New York City or Toronto. However, you can make your own fictional place for your stories to take place in, and some urban fantasy novels center in towns with only a couple thousand inhabitants.\n\nIntegration of Fantasy with Real-World Elements\n\nEveryday life coexists with the extraordinary, and thatâs a two-way street. That means your protagonist and other characters might juggle a day job while fighting supernatural threats. They might save the world, but they still need to work at a coffee shop to make rent by the end of the month.\n\nOn top of that, you need to balance real-world issues, finding ways to weave things like crime, social justice, technology, and climate change into your world alongside magical elements.\n\nIf you take the time to think about how that all works, though, youâre going to create a grossly engaging world.\n\nHidden Magical Societies\n\nWhile not present in all urban fantasy novels, hidden magical societies are pretty commonplace in this subgenre. Secret societies, hidden magical enclaves, and underground networks often play significant roles in your characterâs journey and the larger world.\n\nIf you love worldbuilding, youâll foam at the mouth as you come up with the rules, hierarchies, conflicts, and histories that create these organizations and inform how they affect the plot.\n\nSupernatural in Everyday Life\n\nIt isnât just magic thatâs everywhere in urban fantasy; supernatural elements are part of the everyday world. This includes everything from mythical creatures and supernatural beings to enchanted objects and magical locations.\n\nVampires might run nightclubs or cafes. Werewolves work as private investigators and bouncers. Witches own new-age shops or take on private clients for out-of-body experiences.\n\nYou can also incorporate mythology and folklore into your story, pulling ancient legends into the modern world. This can include reinterpretations of classic myths, incorporation of lesser-known folklore, and the creation of entirely new mythological elements.\n\nJust remember these older legends either need to fit into everyday life or present a threat to it that needs taking care of.\n\nTension Between the Mundane and Magical\n\nBeyond paying the bills, characters have to deal with the tension of leading two lives and living in two worlds. I donât know about you, but Iâd find it difficult to write articles like these if I knew an eldritch being was on the precipice of being summoned and only I could do something to stop it.\n\nOn top of that, thereâs the macro-level tension between the mundane world and the magical one. How do they coexist? How do they threaten each other? Is there some kind of balance that needs to be maintained?\n\nWorldbuilding in Urban Fantasy\n\nThis is just my personal opinion, but worldbuilding is the best part of writing. If I could just be paid to work with authors to build their worlds, magic systems, religions, monsters, and so on, I would be a happy man.\n\nAnd worldbuilding for an urban fantasy novel is even more appealing to me than most.Â\n\nNow, I wish I could spend a few thousand words on a complete worldbuilding guide, but this article is about writing urban fantasy, not worldbuilding, so here are a few links youâre going to want to bookmark to help buff your skills in this area.\n\nAn Authorâs Guide to Crafting a Worldbuilding Bible\n\nDabbleâs Worldbuilding Guide\n\nHow to Create a Fictional World\n\nHow to Write a Setting\n\nHow to Make Your Own Language\n\nInstead, Iâm going to offer some urban fantasy-specific advice when youâre crafting your fictional world.\n\nBlend Real Settings with the Fantastical\n\nUp first, we need to figure out where your story is taking place. Like we mentioned before, the setting of your story is more than just a backdrop in urban fantasy (and most stories, but especially in this subgenre).\n\nMost urban fantasy focuses on a single cityâthe characters live there, work there, and operate within the magical systems there. They might venture out to other locations or parts of the world, but entire double-digit length series often take place in one city.\n\nItâs your choice if you want to take a real place and make it magical or come up with your own metropolis for your story. Creating fictional places inspired by real towns and cities gives you more creative freedom but lacks the familiarity and potential of an actual place.\n\nWhichever you choose, think about the history, culture, and unique characteristics of your setting. Consider how its geography and infrastructure can influence your magical elements or be influenced by them.\n\nAdding Magic to a City\n\nThere are innumerous ways you can add magic to an urban setting, but here are two of the most popular (and beloved) ways to do so:\n\nLandmarks and locations - Infuse iconic landmarks with magical significance. Thereâs a portal to the fae realm in Central Park. The Statue of Liberty is a giant sentinel that comes to life when the city is threatened. Space Mountain was built on an old dragonâs lair.\n\nYou can also create secret magical locations throughout the city. Think an occult market in the sewers or a meeting place for supernatural factions at the top of the Eiffel Tower. These will be well known by the secret world-savvy.\n\nEveryday places with a twist - Because the world beneath exists within modern society, it will have many familiar, though slightly different, amenities and locations. Think about ways you can take everyday places weâre used to and make them magical.\n\nIâm talking about a bar that serves witchâs brews and a subway system where every station is located on an intersection of ley lines. Unless magic is obvious and well-known in your world, youâll want to blend the ordinary with the extraordinary, making magic a part of daily life without drawing overt attention.\n\nCreating Your Urban Fantasy Magic System\n\nIf you add up all the words from the articles we have about magic and magic systems on DabbleU, itâs probably bordering on novel length. Itâs a whole rabbit hole you can dive down, and itâs only one aspect of worldbuilding.\n\nThat said, itâs an incredibly important part of worldbuilding. Magic is to fantasy as technology is to science fiction and happily ever afters are to romance.\n\nSo, while Iâll be covering some of the basics of magic and urban fantasy here, feel free to dive down the magic systems rabbit hole with the links below:\n\nBuilding Your Own Magic System\n\nWhat is a Magic System?\n\nDifferent Types of Magic to Use in Your Writing\n\nDifferent Types of Magic Users to Use in Your Writing\n\nPopular Magic Systems to Inspire You\n\nFor now, letâs talk about what you need for your urban fantasy novel.\n\nWhere Does Magic Come From?\n\nTechnically the source of any magic is essential in every fantasy story, but itâs for that reason that Iâm knocking it out right away.\n\nWhen it comes to where magic comes from, you have a bunch of options. Here are some to whet your palate.\n\nInnate Magic\n\nThese characters are born with magical abilities. These could be hereditary, passed down through bloodlines and restricted to particular families, or they could just be random mutations. If you go this route, consider when these abilities manifest.\n\nLearned Magic\n\nMagic is a skill that can be learned through study and practice. Are there schools, guilds, or mentors who teach magic? What are the costs and challenges of learning magic?\n\nGranted Magic\n\nWith this source, magic is granted by gods, spirits, demons, or other supernatural entities or artifacts. Consider what sort of pact or agreement needs to be made to acquire these abilities. Are there any consequences for breaking them?\n\nThese are the most common sources of magic but not the only ones. Reference those links above for more variety, but always keep in mind how youâll tie these sources into your urban fantasy world.\n\nTypes of Magic\n\nAnother quick crash course in the types of magic you might be interested in integrating into your world. Try to think about who uses these magics, what the barriers to entry are, and how they affect your world.\n\nElemental magic - Control over elements like fire, water, earth, and air.\n\nHealing magic - Abilities to heal wounds and cure illnesses.\n\nIllusion magic - Creating illusions to deceive the senses.\n\nNecromancy - Manipulating life and death, communicating with the dead.\n\nTechnomancy - Combining magic with technology.\n\nEnchantment - Imbuing objects with magical properties.\n\nRules and Limitations\n\nIf thereâs one thing you must know about creating a magic system, itâs that limitations and what magic canât do are the most important things you can come up with.\n\nWhy? Two reasons:\n\nUnchecked magic can be so powerful that everything else in your story feels meaningless.\n\nIt creates tension and forces your characters to adapt or fail.\n\nDefining the rules and limits of any magic system is mandatory. Here are some ideas to get you started.\n\nEnergy Source\n\nPersonal energy - Magic draws from the casterâs own life force or stamina, which can lead to exhaustion or physical harm.\n\nExternal sources - Magic requires external sources like magical artifacts, ley lines, or specific environmental conditions.\n\nCost and Consequences\n\nPhysical and mental costs - Using magic can have physical or mental tolls, like fatigue, injury, mutation, or insanity.\n\nSocial and legal repercussions - Societal laws and regulations governing the use of magic. Are there magical crimes and law enforcement?\n\nLimitations\n\nScope and power - Define the limits of what magic can and cannot do.\n\nSkill and mastery - The casterâs skill level affects the potency and control of their magic. Novices might struggle with simple spells while masters perform complex arcane feats.\n\nImpact on Society\n\nOkay, now weâre starting to get more urban fantasy-specific. There are very few urban fantasy novels where magic is completely unknown save for a select few. Itâs usually known to at least the members of the world beneath and may be known by mundane society, too.\n\nWhen youâve decided how well-known and integrated magic is into society, you need to define the impact it has.\n\nEconomic Impact\n\nHow does magic affect everyday tasks? Iâm talking menial tasks, jobs, and industry.\n\nAre there magical goods and services for sale or hire? Does the stock market still exist in a world where magic events can cause huge market swings? How do the wealthy or magically powerful exploit the economy?\n\nPolitical Impact\n\nNow think about how magic influences governing bodies. On one hand, you might have magical councils or parliaments. On the other, how do magical governments interact with mundane ones? Does the government know about the secret world? Are there treaties drafted between the two?\n\nThen consider the power struggles between political powersâboth within magic or supernatural society and between the secret and mundane worlds. All of this plays a role in when and how magic can be used.\n\nCultural Impact\n\nOf course, magic of any kind would have an impact on society and culture. Imagine if we discovered magic today? Everything would change.\n\nIn your urban fantasy novel, how do ordinary people (from both worlds) view magic and magic users? It could be feared, worshipped, or both.\n\nHow well-integrated are magical communities into non-magical ones? Does magic play a bigger role in some areas, like art or science, than others? Are people from the secret world segregated in the mundane world (or vice-versa) or do we all get along?\n\nBalancing the Magical with the Mundane\n\nWhen youâre writing an urban fantasy novel, you need to find your balance between the magical and the mundane. This will be unique to your story; I canât tell you what the right balance is. However, I can give you some things to think about when making that magical side of things and how they impact the mundane.\n\nUsing familiar elements helps ease readers into your dual world. Thatâs why urban fantasy excels; we know what these cities are like, even if they arenât real. That in itself makes the fantastical elements more believable because some setting work is done for us.\n\nYou can also leverage technology to make magic make sense. This isnât for everyone, but an app that has a library of spells or a magical GPS that is like Waze on arcane steroids gives us a sense of something before we add on magic.\n\nBarring that, ease your readers into it to avoid overwhelming them. Start with subtle hints and displays, then build up to more significant revelations. Start with how magic is interwoven into daily life before jumping to a magic street fight with fireballs instead of firearms.\n\nThink a simple spell for convenience, like fixing a broken chair leg or drying a soaking wet shirt after getting caught in the rain.\n\nAdding in magical street vendors or people doing their jobs with magical assistance in the background is a great way to flesh out your world while introducing magic.\n\nLastly, I want you to consider the real-world impact of magical events when you get to them. If said street fight destroys a building, how is it explained to the public? Are there cover stories or magical clean-up crews? Or is it just an Avengers situation and we all have to deal with it?\n\nAdvanced Magic Rules\n\nLast stop on our magic system section, but I want to drop some advanced tips to get that brain of yours thinking. These have the potential to make your âgoodâ worldbuilding into something great.\n\nMagic Evolution\n\nThere are plenty of ways magic can evolve over time. In an urban or modern setting, we have the luxury of history and recordkeeping to keep track of that. We also have scientific practices to force evolutionâor understand an evolution forced upon it.\n\nConsider some of these:\n\nTechnological integration - How does magic jive with technology? Are they complimentary or at odds with one another? In urban fantasy settings, magic tends to enhance technology, like spells hidden in computer code, enchanted cybernetics, or weaponry that combines magic and science.\n\nCultural shifts - How does the change in culture affect magic? Are new practices, beliefs, or trends introduced as people and times change?\n\nEnvironmental changes - While not all magic will be tied to nature in an urban fantasy novel, you might want to include how urban expansion or climate change impact magic and its practice.\n\nEthics and Moral Questions\n\nIâll save my waxing about power dynamics and imbalances for another blog (or urban fantasy book), but itâs something worth thinking about in your writing.\n\nMoney, political influence, and physical strength can all be used and abused. They can all be tools to exploit others for your own gain.\n\nMagic is no different. If anything, magic has the potential to be worse than all three combined.\n\nUse and abuse of magic - What are the moral boundaries of using magic? How do your characters navigate the gray areas of ethics?\n\nIs there something stopping one group of people from using magic like others? Is there a clear advantage that magic has given some people and not others?\n\nConsequences of power - Absolute power corrupts absolutely. With great power comes great responsibility.\n\nDelve into the consequences of possessing and using magical power. How does it corrupt or inspire characters? What are the long-term effects on individuals and society?\n\nSecret Societies and Powerful Organizations\n\nBefore we dive into our next section on characters, letâs chat quickly about hidden or powerful societies. These are common tropes in urban fantasy novels because theyâre funâand make sense.\n\nThe existence of things like magic and werewolves and witches all lend themselves to some sort of organization. In this day and age, lone wolves (sometimes literally) donât last long.\n\nThey canât! They wouldnât have the resources or be able to hide. Opportunistic people would overpower them and take them out. These organizations are natural products of human nature and the additional elements that youâve added to our modern world.Â\n\nIf youâre going to flesh out your secret or powerful societies and organizations, here are some things to think about.\n\nStructure and Hierarchy\n\nThink about and define the structure of these cabals. Are they organized in guilds, clans, or secret orders?\n\nActually take the time to establish this hierarchy and important players, too. Think about the leaders and the roles members play. This will allow you to make them feel real as you include them in your book.\n\nRules and Traditions\n\nAlso come up with the unique rules, traditions, and customs for these societies. Each of them will have their own, and all of them should be meaningful. Why do they have these customs and what do they accomplish?\n\nConsider how the rules, specifically, affect interactions between them and both the non-magical world and other magical or supernatural groups.\n\nConflict and Politics\n\nAny sort of organization, especially spooky or powerful ones, will deal with a lot of conflict.Â\n\nThere will be conflict within the group.Â\n\nThere will be conflict with the mundane world, even if the normies arenât aware of it.Â\n\nThere will be conflicts with other groups in the secret world.\n\nAnd Iâm not just talking about physical or magical conflict, either. Think about political intrigue because all organizations, at their core, are political, even if itâs only the politics of their werewolf clan or wizard guild.\n\nCharacters in Urban Fantasy\n\nHereâs a bit of a sassy secret: developing an urban fantasy character is just like developing a character in any other story, just with some different spices.\n\nAnd we have a ton of articles on character development for you (for free) on DabbleU.

They still have to pay their bills and buy groceries.\n\nMake sure you give your protagonist and important secondary characters relatable issues. Job stress, relationship problems, and personal insecurities let readers connect with them, even if theyâre an orc mage.\n\nThis will help you walk that fine line of their dual life. They need to juggle that ordinary life with their extraordinary abilities or responsibilities, which adds some much-loved tension to your tale.\n\nThen you need to layer on some unique traits. Give them abilities or qualities that are magical, supernatural, or otherwise different from normal folks. Make sure these set them apart for a distinct reason so they donât get lost in the shuffle.\n\nAnd alwaysâalwaysâunderstand their backstory. Even if some elements never make it onto the page, you should know how they acquired their abilities and what motivates their actions.\n\nTypes of Secondary Characters\n\nIn urban fantasy books, youâll often see characters that embody both archetypes and beloved tropes. Iâm going to list off some of the ones that make the best stories or vibe with urban fantasy readers the most here; you donât need to use them if you donât want to, but they are fictional folks you can add to your writing toolkit.\n\nIf you donât know what archetypes are, theyâre a set of traits and attributes that are immediately recognizable. Tropes, on the other hand, are similar but usually genre-specific things we see often. Enemies to lovers, a charming rogue, a mad scientist, etc.\n\nReaders love their tropes, and archetypes help us avoid long-winded or confusing infodumps. So take a look at these bundles of spices all wrapped up in some tasty characters.\n\nI also cringed at that, donât worry.\n\nMagical Mentors\n\nThese folks are especially common in young adult urban fantasy, but youâll find them all over the place in this subgenre. A mentor or sage character is one who guides or trains the protagonist.\n\nUsually, they have some sort of deep knowledge of magic or the supernatural while our protagonistâtheir menteeâdoes not.\n\nThis type of character lets you explore the mentor-student relationship and its evolution. Do they grow closer? Further apart? Does one betray the other?\n\nNon-Magical Friends\n\nAs your protagonist navigates both worlds in your urban fantasy novel, they probably have some mundane friends. These friends, while not magical or supernatural, are incredibly important for grounding your protagonist when things get wacky.\n\nIf you want to include them, you need to decide whether these mundane friends know about the world beneath or not. How do they react to it? Do they support or hinder their friend when they learn the truth?\n\nSupernatural Beings\n\nYouâll struggle to find an urban fantasy without supernatural beings, theyâre kind of a big deal. You can include only one or two types, or you can go for it and include werewolves, fae, vampires, demons, ghosts, witches, pixies, gnomes, dwarves, goblins, orcs, centaurs, demigods, angels, merfolk, and whatever your writer brain comes up with.\n\nEach species should have their own unique perspectives and abilities, but each of them are still individuals (aka characters) within that group. Treat them as such when you develop them.\n\nLocal Allies\n\nBecause cities are living, breathing things (sometimes literally in urban fantasy settings), your characters will likely rely on local allies and experts to help them navigate their way through your story.Â\n\nThese are characters with deep knowledge of the world, if only in their unique way, like journalists, detectives, or informants.Â\n\nThere are other allies who provide resources or assistance, like magical suppliers or tech-savvy hackers.\n\nAll of these not only aid your character but add to your worldbuilding at the same time. Win-win.\n\nCommon Conflicts in Urban Fantasy\n\nTragically, I canât come up with your plot for you. Thatâs your job, as the writerâand why we do this in the first place, right?\n\nLike Iâve said a handful of times in this article, coming up with an urban fantasy plot is a lot like coming up with any other plot. So here are some resources to make you an expert in story structure and plot development:\n\nStory Structures: The Fundamentals You Need to Know\n\nHow to Plug Those Plot Holes\n\nThree-Act Structure Worksheet\n\nThe Four Types of Conflict\n\nFor this article, to give you a hand, I want to touch on some recurring conflicts in urban fantasy. Get those gears grinding away in your noggin.\n\nPersonal Conflicts\n\nThe duality of urban fantasy worlds and the fantastical nature of them lends to a lot of inner conflict. Here are some examples:\n\nInternal struggles - Whether grappling with their newfound magical abilities or a moral dilemma presented by the world youâve made, your protagonist is going to have a lot of conflicting feelings.\n\nRelationship - There will inevitably be tension with family, friends, or romantic partners as the hero tries to balance world-ending threats, potential magic powers, and the ârealâ world.\n\nIdentity and secrecy - Your protagonist is leading dual lives, one in each world. That alone is going to cause them a headache. Tack on the stress they feel from (and the consequences of) hiding magical truths from loved ones and the public, and you have a lot of potential for inner turmoil.\n\nExternal Conflicts\n\nI always dub these the âsexierâ conflicts because they are what sell books, while personal or internal struggles are what make stories exceptional. You need both! And urban fantasy provides so much room to create stunning external conflicts to complement your internal ones.\n\nHere are some to think about:\n\nSupernatural threats - This is probably the most common external conflict in the urban fantasy genre. Some sort of major threat endangers the city or magical community, like a powerful eldritch being or a magical catastrophe.\n\nSocietal issues - We already have prejudice in our society and conflicts between different factions and beliefs. Now think about how much worse it would be if you threw in supernatural species and magic. Tackle broader societal issues exacerbated or created by your unique world.\n\nClash between the two worlds - Consider the tension between the two worlds and how that can cause conflict, too. Maybe the plot is about racing to cover up a magical incident before itâs exposed to the mundane world, or perhaps itâs more about the conflicts arising from the coexistence of these two worlds.\n\nPower struggles - Think back to that political intrigue we were talking about. How does that manifest with your worldâs being and organizations? What conflicts arise between and within the magical communities and societies over power, control, and influence?\n\nSome Tips for Writing Urban Fantasy\n\nBefore we part ways, I just want to provide you with some last tips for writing your urban fantasy novel. These will either reinforce what weâve spoken about or address an issue that didnât fit nicely in one of the previous sections.\n\nTheyâre all important and will be evergreen in their lasting impact on your urban fantasy writing career, though.\n\nWriting Dialogue\n\nDialogue is a critical part of any novel. So much so that we made our Premium workshop on dialogue free. In urban fantasy, youâre combining a time and genre that seem contradictory when it comes to dialogue.\n\nKeep these things in mind:\n\nAuthenticity - Youâre writing in the 21st century. Use contemporary slang and idioms to ground characters in the modern world. Current (if magical) backgrounds and personalities should influence the way someone speaks. If using a real place, research local dialects and get feedback to make it sound right.\n\nMagical vocabulary - Your world is going to have its own magical terminology. While you want to slowly introduce these terms to your reader, you also need to seamlessly integrate them into the way people speak. Take it easy at first, then let these words feel like everyday vocabulary for those in the know.\n\nCharacter voice - This isnât urban fantasy-specific, but character voice is the most important thing you can understand and develop for writing strong dialogue. Luckily for you, my pal Abi has a great guide to establishing a characterâs voice right here.\n\nWriting Description\n\nUrban fantasy readers are unique in that they love magic, supernatural beings, and all that fun fantasy stuff, but they donât tend to love the exposition and detail that comes with traditional or epic fantasy writing.\n\nYou need to keep that in mind while writing. Think about:\n\nFocus on key details - Hone in on a couple details that immediately enhance the atmosphere and setting. Senses are your friends hereâa smell and sound can go a long way in enhancing a scene with only a sentence or two.\n\nAvoid infodumps - While some fantasy readers love infodumps, chill out a bit in this subgenre. Urban fantasy is faster paced, so integrate descriptions naturally into actions and dialogue when you can.\n\nUrban and magical contrast - Highlight the contrast between the magical and mundane. Focus on how our normal changes with the presence of magic to really draw a readerâs attention.\n\nWriting Themes\n\nThemes are what make stories worth reading. Theyâre the meaning behind all the action and talking and spellslinging.\n\nTheyâre also tricky to get right. Luckily for us, the urban fantasy genre skews towards some common themes people love to read about.\n\nIdentity - This genre gives you a big sandbox to explore themes of dual lives and self-discovery, whether the hero is trying to balance their two worlds or exploring their ultimate destiny.\n\nPower and responsibility - Refer to those two lines about responsibility I used before. Examine the ethical implications of using magical power and the consequences of its abuse and explore the protagonistâs responsibility to protect both the magical and non-magical worlds.\n\nSecrecy and revelation - These worlds are rife with lies and secrets. What does it mean to keep these secrets? How does someone feel living a life that needs to be hidden from the general population? What needs to be sacrificed to keep such a big secret?\n\nWriting Urban Elements\n\nWhen writing urban fantasy, youâre writing two urban locations: the one we know and the one we donât. This requires some planning and intentionality.\n\nRealistic urban settings - Incorporate realistic details of your urban setting, like local landmarks, street names, and cultural influences. Reflect the hustle and bustle of city life, including traffic, noise, diverse populations, and urban challenges.\n\nMagical urbanization - Magical crime, enchanted public transportation, or supernatural nightlife are all signs of magical influences of urban life, so think about the way magic will influence our real cities. Then dig deeper and think about the magical influences hidden within the city. Map these all out in your notes.\n\nBring Your Secret World to Life With Dabble\n\nLike any fantasy novel, thereâs a ton of worldbuilding that goes along with writing urban fantasy (you could probably tell from how much time we spent on it in this article).
