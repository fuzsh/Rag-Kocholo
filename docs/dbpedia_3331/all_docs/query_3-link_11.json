        "text": "I’ve posted a couple of posts lately about urban fantasy versus contemporary fantasy (here and here) and got a ton of emails and messages from all of you, discussing how you see the genres, and what you think they are.\n\nAll very interesting.\n\nI’m a member of SFWA (Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Association), and a fellow member, Carrie Vaughn, mentioned that traditional publishers are no longer interested in publishing urban fantasy.\n\nThat made me sit up and take notice. Carrie Vaughn is an award-winning author. Her urban fantasy series have hit the New York Times Best Seller list.\n\nAnd she can’t sell her urban fantasy to New York.\n\nI had a discussion with Carrie about this phenomenon, and she directed me to a post she wrote some years ago that covers the same ground. You’ll find it here. It’s eye-opening stuff, especially if you’re not keeping up with the vagaries of the traditional publishing industry (like me).\n\nTaylen."
