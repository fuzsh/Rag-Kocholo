Mr. Rodriguez initially studied at the University of Miami in Florida, where he grew up, but transferred to The New School in New York City where he received his B.A. Mr. Rodriguez has performed and toured with Clark Terry, Bobby Watson, Quincy Jones, Joe Lovano, Toshiko Akiyoshi Orchestra, Pop Icon Jessica Simpson, Chico O’Farill Orchestra, Wynton Marsalis and the JALC, Lincoln Center Afro-Latin Jazz Orchestra, and is a member of Charlie Haden’s Liberation Music Orchestra. In 2019, Mr. Rodriguez Joined Chick Corea’s Spanish Heart Band and won a Grammy Award for Best Latin Jazz Album. Mr. Rodriguez and his brother, pianist/composer Robert Rodriguez, have recorded four albums together and their most recent album Impromptu was nominated for a 2015 Grammy for Best Latin Jazz Album. Mr. Rodriguez is currently on the faculty at NYU and San Francisco Conservatory of Music as an adjunct Professor of Trumpet and travels the globe as a clinician. In March 2013, he released his debut solo recording under The CrissCross Label entitled Reverence. His new recording is entitled Pathways under the label Rodbrosmusis, which is co-owned by both him and his brother.\n\nA world-class soloist, accomplished composer and formidable bandleader, saxophonist Chris Potter has emerged as a leading light of his generation. A potent improvisor and the youngest musician ever to win Denmark’s Jazzpar Prize, Mr. Potter’s impressive discography includes 15 albums as a leader and sideman appearances on over 100 albums. He was nominated for a Grammy Award for his solo work on In Vogue, a track from Joanne Brackeen’s 1999 album Pink Elephant Magic, and was prominently featured on Steely Dan’s Grammy-winning album from 2000, Two Against Nature. He has performed or recorded with many of the leading names in jazz, such as Herbie Hancock, Dave Holland, John Scofield, the Mingus Big Band, Jim Hall, Paul Motian, Dave Douglas, Ray Brown and many others. Born in Chicago in 1971, Mr. Potter’s family moved to Columbia, South Carolina when he was 3. There he started playing guitar and piano before taking up the alto saxophone at age 10, playing his first gig at 13. When piano legend Marian McPartland first heard Chris at 15 years old, she told his father that Mr. Potter was ready for the road with a unit such as Woody Herman’s band, but finishing school was a priority. At age 18, Mr. Potter moved to New York to study at the New School and Manhattan School of Music. As an 18-year-old prodigy with bebop icon Red Rodney (who himself had played as a young man alongside the legendary Charlie Parker), Mr. Potter has steered a steady course of growth as an instrumentalist and composer-arranger. Looking back over his 20 years since arriving in New York, Mr. Potter says, “I’ve had the chance to learn a lot from all the leaders that I’ve worked with. Each gave me another perspective on how to organize a band and make a statement. It’s taught me that any approach can work, as long as you have a strong vision of what you want to do.” Now a respected veteran (as well as a new father), Mr. Potter continues to work as a bandleader and featured sideman.\n\n# # #"
