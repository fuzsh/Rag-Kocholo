        "text": "Fred Ebb Award and Jonathan Larson Grant winning writing duo Kooman & Dimond will drop the world premiere recording of their musical The Noteworthy Life of Howard Barnes on Friday, September 13th.\n\nMichael Kooman and Christopher Dimond (Disney’s “Vampirina”) after completing three seasons of music for the hit Disney Junior series “Vampirina,” which airs in 115 countries to more than 100 million viewers, return to their theatrical roots with this album. To preorder the album, visit KoomanDimond.com/store.\n\nCalled “uproariously funny and surprisingly touching” by The Seattle Times, The Noteworthy Life of Howard Barnes follows Howard Barnes, a perfectly average man until the day that he wakes up to discover that his life has become a musical. Desperate to escape from the show, Howard embarks on a fantastical quest through the realm of musical theater. Equal parts satire, romantic comedy, and love letter to the American musical, The Noteworthy Life of Howard Barnes is a musical for people who love musical theater, and their spouses who hate it.\n\n“We’re thrilled to share the recording of this zany, joyous musical comedy with the world, and we can’t wait to receive .006 cents per play on Spotify,” said Kooman and Dimond. “It’s a rare opportunity for writers to get the chance to bring a completely original, 16 actor, 10 musician musical to life, and we’re honored to release this album on iTunes, Amazon, and whatever new app people use to steal music.”\n\nFirst staged at Seattle’s Village Theater, The Noteworthy Life of Howard Barnes was one of the theatre’s most popular new musicals since the world premiere of Million Dollar Quartet. The world premiere recording features Joshua Carter as Howard, Taryn Darr as Maggie, Jeff Steitzer as Stephen Lloyd Rogers Von Schwartzenheim, Jasmine Jean Sim as Grace, with Kate E. Cook, Alex Crozier, Nick DeSantis, Paul Flanagan, Danielle Kelsey, Mallory King, Greg McCormick Allen, Richard Peacock, Sarah Russell, Hannah Schuerman, John David Scott, and Brenna Wagner. A bonus track features Heidi Blickenstaff (Disney’s Freaky Friday, Something Rotten!).\n\nOrchestrations are by Michael Pettry. The album was musical directed by R.J. Tancioco with mixing and mastering by Paul Vazquez. The original production of The Noteworthy Life of Howard Barnes was directed by Brandon Ivie (Jasper in Deadland) and choreographed by Al Blackstone (So You Think You Can Dance, Freddie Falls in Love).\n\nMichael Kooman (music) and Christopher Dimond (book & lyrics) are a New York City-based writing team for the stage and screen. Their most recent musical, Romantics Anonymous, debuted to rave reviews at Shakespeare’s Globe. They also currently serve as songwriters for “Vampirina,” an animated musical TV series for which they have written more than 150 songs. The show airs on Disney Channel and Disney Junior, reaching over 100 million viewers in 115 countries.\n\nMichael and Chris have written songs for Patti LuPone, Brian Stokes Mitchell, Patina Miller, Christian Borle, Andrew Rannells, Skylar Astin, Anna Camp, and Wanda Sykes.\n\nTheir stage projects include The Noteworthy Life Of Howard Barnes (Village Theater), Orphie & The Book Of Heroes (The Kennedy Center), The Enlightenment Of Percival Von Schmootz (Adirondack Theatre Festival), Judge Jackie: Disorder In The Court (Pittsburgh CLO; licensed by Samuel French), Dani Girl (Exit, Pursued by a Bear; licensed by Samuel French), Golden Gate (Williamstown Theatre Festival), Homemade Fusion (London’s Ambassadors Theater, Edinburgh Fringe Festival) and Junior Claus (Orlando Repertory Theatre; licensed by Dramatic Publishing).\n\nAwards and honors include the Fred Ebb Award, a Jonathan Larson Grant, the Mary Rodgers/Lorenz Hart Award, the Samuel French Next Step Award, the Burton Lane Award, and the Harold Adamson Award. They are members of the Dramatists Guild and ASCAP, and are proud alumni of Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nTheir debut album, Out Of Our Heads, featuring an all-star lineup of Broadway performers, is available on iTunes.\n\nFor more information on Kooman and Dimond, visit KoomanDimond.com.\n\nLASSO-ED AGAIN? — (via Deadline) Ted Lasso fans, this is not a drill. In a major step toward the long-awaited fourth season of Apple TV+’s hugely popular soccer comedy, the series’ studio Warner Bros. Television has picked up the options on the three original cast members who had been contracted under the aegis of the UK acting union Equity, sources tell Deadline. They are Hannah Waddingham, who plays AFC Richmond owner Rebecca Walton, Brett Goldstein, who plays hardman Roy Kent and Jeremy Swift, who plays Director of Football Operations Leslie Higgins.\n\nAfter securing the trio, the studio is expected to start reaching out to Ted Lasso cast members with SAG-AFTRA contracts whose options had expired, so they will need to make new deals, we hear. In addition to co-creators/executive producers Jason Sudeikis (Ted Lasso) and Brendan Hunt (Coach Beard), that is believed to include Juno Temple (Keeley Jones). We hear one of the Ted Lasso OGs, Phil Dunster (Jamie Tart), has not been picked up, presumably due to a conflict with another series; he is on both Prime Video’s The Devil’s Hour and Apple’s Surface.\n\nIt is unclear which other stars may be approached about Season 4; the cast have all said repeatedly that they would be happy to reprise their roles if an opportunity arises. Many would likely pop in for guest appearances.\n\nGetting the cast back paves the way toward a Season 4 green light, contingent on budget approval and scheduling as actors whose options have lapsed may have joined other series that have them in first position, sources said.\n\nWhile the outreach to the cast is underway, early preparations are also being made to open a writers room. If all elements come together, we hear production on a fourth season is eyeing an early 2025 start. Reps for WBTV and Apple TV+ declined comment.\n\nStarting the process for a Season 4 greenlight indicates that the main Ted Lasso driving force on and off-screen, Sudeikis, is on board for a new installment as the studio would not have proceeded without his consent.\n\nThe fate of Ted Lasso has always hinged on Sudeikis, who’d originated the character in NBC Sports videos. While being open that they would love to extend Ted Lasso, one of the biggest and most acclaimed comedies of the past decade, Apple and Warner Bros. executives have made it clear that it would be up to Sudeikis whether the show would continue.\n\nThe Saturday Night Live alum, who co-created Ted Lasso with Hunt, Joe Kelly and Bill Lawrence, had originally conceived the comedy as a three-season story arc and he stuck with the plan despite the series’ enormous success. But he had not shut the door to more Ted Lasso — which is why Season 3 was not labeled as final — contingent on finding the right idea. Much to Ted Lasso fans’ delight, more than a year after the Season 3 finale, it looks like that has happened.\n\nWith its uplifting tone and a good-natured, eternal optimist lead character, Ted Lasso was the perfect show to launch at the height of the pandemic in August 2020. The comedy became an instant global hit and Apple’s signature and most-watched ever original series.\n\nIn addition to its immense popularity that catapulted it into the pop culture zeitgeist, Ted Lasso earned 13 Emmy Awards during its original three-season run, including two back-to-back Outstanding Comedy Series trophies and acting wins for Sudeikis (2), Goldstein (2), who is also a writer-producer on the show, and Waddingham.\n\nThe May 2023 Season 3 finale saw Keeley and Rebecca potentially partnering for a new venture, AFC Richmond Women’s Team, with all the main characters main characters getting a happy ending, including Ted, last seen coaching his son on a soccer field in Kansas.\n\nInteresting to say the least. The question is and has always been, could they again capture what made the first-run of the show, so successful? I personally was happy with the resolution, although many were not. It’d be a major payday for everyone involved, so that’s a major consideration for everyone. Stay tuned.\n\nDREW’S BLUES — (Via Deadline) As she prepares to get back to her studio couch, Drew Barrymore plans to give her guests a little more space going forward.\n\nFollowing The Drew Barrymore Show’s renewal for seasons 6 and 7, the actress and talk show host explained why she tends to get literally up-close and personal with her subjects on the syndicated CBS morning show.\n\n“Well, I’ll try to practice physical distance, which is not my strong point,” Barrymore said on Entertainment Tonight. “Do you know how hard the pandemic was for me? I was alone in a studio by myself! I like to be around people!”\n\nShe acknowledged that her indifference toward personal space is “not everyone’s favorite but I’m sorry to those people!”\n\n“I think that, first of all, we’re always gonna be big on joy and laughter and feeling good, and that was something I always wanted to do,” explained Barrymore. “But I never thought we would launch in a pandemic, and trying to lean into the joy and the feel good and the comedy at that time was real weird and wacky.”\n\n“Drew is a one-of-a-kind talent who is an integral part of the CBS and Paramount family,” said Wendy McMahon, president and CEO of CBS News and Stations and CBS Media Ventures. “This early renewal and upgrades are a testament to our commitment to The Drew Barrymore Show and its loyal audience, who tune in every day to see Drew’s warmth, inquisitiveness and spontaneity.”\n\nThis fall, The Drew Barrymore Show moves to upgraded time slots on CBS stations in six markets, including five of the top 10 markets. Meanwhile, the show is averaging 1.1 million viewers, with nearly 6 billion minutes watched this season, according to CBS.\n\nI’m a fan, but I don’t often watch her show. I watched it when I was sequestered at home, but found it somewhat off-putting. The current 9:30 AM ET slot was kind of awkward too. There was alto of talk about the show being canceled, so this is manna from heaven.\n\nSHORT TAKES — Our old Friend Marcus Linail (ML Presents) is currently featuring a Coldplay-tribute band. Why not? Marcus ran NYC’s The Canal Room and Shine – both much missed and has worked for years with the tribute band Jessie’s Girl – who are phenomenal. Check out his productions at https://www.mlpresents.com/ …\n\nKjersti Long’s about-to-be-staged play in London has undergone a name change, to Little Piece Of You. More to follow on this one, including who will be the star of the show, which will be a mind-blower. We heard it and could not believe it … Now here’s something I’d really love to read: You can read about Peter and all the Monkees, plus all your teen idols in my memoir: “Meow! My Groovy Life with Tiger Beat’s Teen Idols,” you can grab an e-book or paperback at Amazon.com or an autographed copy at my website:annmoses.com …\n\nHad occasion to listen to Robin Trower’s magnificent “Bridge Of Sighs” from 1974. My God, it sounded as good as ever. Jim Dewar’s vocals just mesmerize. The Bride Of Sighs is in Venice and was the last thing the convicts of the day saw before their death. What a song. Take a listen\n\nAre Oasis re-uniting after a 15-year split? “Wonderwall” remains a stone-cold classic. Check this piece out from Deadline: https://deadline.com/2024/08/liam-gallagher-appears-to-confirm-oasis-reunion-15-years-after-warring-brothers-split-1236049824/ … Micky Dolenz admitted on his weekend interview with Cousin Brucie on WABC, that being a DJ on CBS-FM back in 2005, was a difficult one in that getting up at 3:00 AM was often difficult as being on rock and roll time, he’d be going to sleep then. Great interview and don’t forget Dolenz will be at Flagsataff/Westbury Music Fair on December 14 … Jeff Lynne and his re-configured ELO opened their 31-date Over and Out Tour over the weekend in Palm Desert, CA. He’s one of my all-time faves but from the videos I saw, it looked a tad shaky. It’s essentially the same band he’s had in previous tours and while they’re good, they’re almost a little too slick. Hope to catch them at MSG next month …\n\nAnd, CBS News Radio -just shy of 60 years on air- officially signs off tonight. Sad for sure.\n\nNAMES IN THE NEWS — Vito Bruno; Toby Mamis; Chuck Pulin; Paul Undersinger; Mark Bego; Tom & Lisa Cuddy; Lillian Roxon; Jane Blunkell; Debbie Gibson; Heather Moore; Liz Skollar; Van Dean; Mark Berry; Lon Van Eaton; Steve Plotnicki; Manny Bella; Carol Ross; Tommy James; Dan Zelinski; Peter Shendell; Randy Alexander; Lee Jeske; Steve Walter; Barry Fisch; Eppy; Amanda Naylor; Zach Martin; Race Taylor; Joe Bonadonna; and BELLA!\n\nImages on this page have been licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International license.\n\nMEGALOPOLIS SCREW-UP — (from Variety) “Lionsgate is immediately recalling our trailer for ‘Megalopolis,’” a Lionsgate spokesperson said in a statement provided to Variety. “We offer our sincere apologies to the critics involved and to Francis Ford Coppola and American Zoetrope for this inexcusable error in our vettingprocess. We screwed up. We are sorry.”\n\nThe trailer, released on Wednesday morning, aimed to position Coppola’s latest film as a work of art that would withstand the test of time, much like his previous masterpieces “The Godfather” and “Apocalypse Now.”\n\nThe video included several quotes from critics panning Coppola’s previous work — but none of the phrases, attributed to the likes of Roger Ebert and Pauline Kael, could be found in any of their reviews.\n\nVariety‘s Owen Gleiberman was incorrectly cited as calling the 1992 film “Bram Stoker’s Dracula” “a beautiful mess” and highlighting its “absurdity” when he reviewed the film for Entertainment Weekly, where he worked at the time of its release.\n\n“Even if you’re one of those people who don’t like critics, we hardly deserve to have words put in our mouths. Then again, the trivial scandal of all this is that the whole ‘Megalopolis’ trailer is built on a false narrative,” Gleiberman said of the trailer’s falsified quotes. “Critics loved ‘The Godfather.’ And though ‘Apocalypse Now’ was divisive, it received a lot of crucial critical support. As far as me calling ‘Bram Stoker’s Dracula’ ‘a beautiful mess,’ I only wish I’d said that! Regarding that film, it now sounds kind.”\n\nIt’s not clear where most of the quotes featured in the trailer came from — with the exception of Roger Ebert’s comment, “a triumph of style over substance,” which was actually pulled from his 1989 review of “Batman,” and not about “Dracula,” as indicated in the trailer.\n\nThe trailer snafu is the latest in a string of scandals befalling the $120 million production, which Coppola financed entirely himself. Last month, Variety exclusively obtained video depicting Coppola trying to kiss young female extras on the set of the project, as additional crew members detailed his unprofessional behavior during production.”\n\nHere’s the trailer –\n\nSHORT TAKES — U2 are releasing a film of their Sphere residency. Was bound to happen. While it’ll be difficult to imagine the show in person on film; it’ll no doubt be great …\n\nJanet Jackson at 58, will be heading a Vegas residency in January? God bless her … NBC and The Today Show have been relentlessly promoting the forthcoming two-part Wicked movie (directed by Jon M. Chu); from their sister studio Universal. I hear the film is not very good, but has all this advance PR helped, or hurt. We’ll see …\n\nThe pristine name Warner Brothers is in real trouble; mostly caused by one David Zaslav aka Zaz The Butcher. The brand Warner Brothers is worth $9.1 billion less this year, than last. Check this missive out: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/party-loving-hollywood-mogul-making-131500886.html Personally when he threw the name HBO out and re-branded it was MAX, I knew he was in major trouble. Oh, he’s changing it back to HBO now. There you go …\n\nMicky Dolenz is interviewed on Bruce Morrow’s WABC show Saturday night … First Robert Downey Jr. has returns to the Marvel Universe, now has James Spader who will reprise hisUltron-voice for the new Vision series; tentatively called VisionQuest. Here’s Deadline’s take on it: https://deadline.com/2024/08/james-spader-ultron-marvel-vision-series-1236048975/ …Yes, the just-completed DNC show in Chicago ran very, very smoothly and a lot of that is due to producer Ricky Kirshner. Yes, Don’s son … As we go to press, the rumor of the day is Trump and Kennedy hooking up on the ticket? What a crazy, crazy roller-coaster ride this election has been. Stay tuned for sure as I just bet there’s eve more to come …\n\nAnd, clearly it’s a premiere puff-piece for Primary Wave’s goal to launch the house of James Brown as another Graceland, but from Billboard a crazy article for sure. Called the James Brown House on Beech Island, it’s quite an amazing read and yes, almost every member of the Primary Wavestaff gets a mention.

Who was this silver-haired devil bolting around his live audience? Whether it was John Wayne or Bill Clinton or Ringo Starr, he was a whirling dervish. Donahue always said that his audience were the real stars; they were the buyers who made shows like his possible … and he was right.\n\nBeginning to Dayton, Ohio, then Chicago, then New York, Phil Donahue had the real, first-ever talk show, where his audience would get involved. Oprah, who for my money stole his format, might have gotten more ink, but Donahue’s choice of topics was absolutely stunning and diverse.\n\nHis 44-union with Marlo Thomas was pretty amazing too. She sort of dropped off the radar after her series That Girl; although we would see her in relentless commercials for St. Jude, which her father Danny founded.\n\nThink about everyone who followed in Phil’s footsteps; Geraldo; Sally Jesse Raphael; Montel Williams; Joan Rivers; Jenny Jones; Maury Povich; Gordon Elliot; Tyra Banks; Jerry Springer; Bill Boggs;Lee Leonard; Richard Bey; Stanley Siegal; Morton Downey Jr. … just an endless stream of competition, but Phil was the best.\n\nTo tell the truth, after Phil I became an avid Larry King devotee and he definitely borrowed some elements from his show. I first met Donahue in my dentist’s office, if you can believe that. We started talking and soon become acquaintances. He was definitely the real deal.\n\nNo question, Phil was the king. RIP.\n\nBELLO TO WATERFRONT — (Via Deadline) Maria Bello (Beef) is set as a series regular opposite Holt McCallany in the new Netflix family drama series The Waterfront, written and executive produced by Kevin Williamson.\n\nInspired by true events, The Waterfront dives into the flawed Buckley family as their attempts to retain control of their crumbling North Carolina fishing empire drive them to increasingly dangerous means to keep themselves afloat.\n\nBello will play Mae Buckley, a complex woman who’s married to Harlan (McCallany) and the mother of their two children. After her husband took a step back from the family business, together with their son, she has been running the fishery in very questionable ways in a desperate attempt to save the family.\n\nWilliamson and Ben Fast executive produce for Outerbanks Entertainment. Universal Television, a division of Universal Studio Group, where Williamson is under an overall deal, is the studio.\n\nBello won the Critics Choice Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress this year for her role in Beef. Her film works includes The History of Violence and The Cooler. She’ll next be seen in the French/English language film Hell in Paradise\n\nSHORT TAKES — NBC’s trailers of Zachary Quinto new show Beautiful Minds are a tad ominous. He was great as Spock in the Star Trek-movies and I don’t think I can get that image of out my mind … Are you a fan of McDonalds? They’ve been on the scene since 1940. Hard to believe, right. Check out this article from the Independentin the U.K. – https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/mcdonalds-sales-fast-food-chain-competition-high-street-b2597337.html …Monkee-Micky Dolenz was a DJ on CBS-FM; and he’s playing a weddding DJ in the new zom-com The Zombie Wedding.

The two parts will air consecutively, beginning at 8:00 p.m. ET/PT on the 7th, and will also be available to stream on Max. Here’s the trailer:\n\nNassau County exec Bruce Blakeman has curated some great “free” concerts at Eisenhower Park this summer – where I lived nearby for years. Living Color; Don Felder and even a Taylor Swift-tribute band. The word has not been good on Blakeman, but with numerous commercials and some creative-booking, let’s give him an E for effort … FBI’s Katherine Renee Kane, who portrayed agent Tiffany Wallace, will depart this season. Too bad as she was great. Overlord Dick Wolff keeping his costs down for sure – insiders reports he’s still aggravated that his early Law & Order stars got so rich. Too bad. Wolff is definitely not a one of the good guys …Kudos to Wednesday’s National Radio Day … Caught Ben Affleck’s 2010 drama The Town again and was just blown away. Just sensational direction. With Rebecca Hal, Jon Hamm and Jeremy Renner, it was just brilliant … Happy Bday Al Roker (70) and Debbie Gibson (54)!\n\nNAMES IN THE NEWS — Mark Bego; Colin Quinn; Glenn Friscia; Vito Bruno; Alan Cumming; Carson Daly; Matt Lauer; Lee Jeske; Randy Alexander; Tom & Lisa Cuddy; Michael Ellis; Frankie Crocker; Greg D’Alessandro; Steve Immerman; Tony Seidl; Markos Papadatos; and SADIE!\n\nImages on this page have been licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International license."
