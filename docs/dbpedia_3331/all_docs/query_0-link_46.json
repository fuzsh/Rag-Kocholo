        "text": "Anesthesia management for MitraClip device implantation\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHarikrishnan Kothandan\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Aims and Objectives: Percutaneous MitraClip implantation has been demonstrated as an alternative procedure in high-risk patients with symptomatic severe mitral regurgitation (MR who are not suitable (or denied mitral valve repair/replacement due to excessive co morbidity. The MitraClip implantation was performed under general anesthesia and with 3-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (TEE and fluoroscopic guidance. Materials and Methods: Peri-operative patient data were extracted from the electronic and paper medical records of 21 patients who underwent MitraClip implantations. Results: Four MitraClip implantation were performed in the catheterization laboratory; remaining 17 were performed in the hybrid operating theatre. In 2 patients, procedure was aborted, in one due to migration of the Chiari network into the left atrium and in second one, the leaflets and chords of the mitral valve torn during clipping resulting in consideration for open surgery. In the remaining 19 patients, MitraClip was implanted and the patients showed acute reduction of severe MR to mild-moderate MR. All the patients had invasive blood pressure monitoring and the initial six patients had central venous catheterization prior to the procedure. Intravenous heparin was administered after the guiding catheter was introduced through the inter-atrial septum and activated clotting time was maintained beyond 250 s throughout the procedure. Protamine was administered at the end of the procedure. All the patients were monitored in the intensive care unit after the procedure. Conclusions: Percutaneous MitraClip implantation is a feasible alternative in high-risk patients with symptomatic severe MR. Anesthesia management requirements are similar to open surgical mitral valve repair or replacement. TEE plays a vital role during the MitraClip implantation.\n\nPercutaneous interventional mitral regurgitation treatment using the Mitra-Clip system\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nBoekstegers, P; Hausleiter, J; Baldus, S\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe interventional treatment of mitral valve regurgitation by the MitraClip procedure has grown rapidly in Germany and Europe during the past years. The MitraClip procedure has the potential to treat high-risk patients with secondary mitral valve regurgitation and poor left ventricular function....... Furthermore, patients with primary mitral valve regurgitation may be treated successfully by the MitraClip procedure in case of high surgical risk or in very old patients. At the same time it has been emphasised that the MitraClip interventional treatment is still at an early stage of clinical development....... The largest clinical experience with the MitraClip procedure so far is probably present in some German cardiovascular centers, which here summarise their recommendations on the current indications and procedural steps of the MitraClip treatment. These recommendations of the AGIK and ALKK may present a basis...\n\nAcute outcomes after MitraClip therapy in highly aged patients: results from the German TRAnscatheter Mitral valve Interventions (TRAMI) Registry.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSchillinger, Wolfgang; HÃ¼nlich, Mark; Baldus, Stephan; Ouarrak, Taoufik; Boekstegers, Peter; Hink, Ulrich; Butter, Christian; Bekeredjian, Raffi; Plicht, BjÃ¶rn; Sievert, Horst; Schofer, Joachim; Senges, Jochen; Meinertz, Thomas; HasenfuÃ, Gerd\n\n2013-05-20\n\nThe influence of age on baseline demographics and outcomes of patients selected for MitraClip has not been previously investigated. Baseline demographics and acute outcomes in 1,064 patients from the German TRAMI registry were stratified by age (525 patients â¥76 years and 539 patients 50% (40.1% vs. 21.8%, p<0.0001) and degenerative mitral regurgitation (DMR, 35.3% vs. 25.6%, p<0.01). Age was the most frequent reason for non-surgical treatment in the elderly (69.4% vs. 36.1%, p<0.0001). The intrahospital MACCE (death, myocardial infarction, stroke) was low in both groups (3.5% vs. 3.4%, p=0.93) and the proportion of non-severe mitral regurgitation at discharge was similar (95.8% vs. 96.4%, p=0.73). A logistic regression model did not reveal any significant impact of age on acute efficacy and safety of MitraClip therapy. In both groups, the majority of patients were discharged home (81.8% vs. 86.2%, p=0.06). Elderly and younger patients have similar benefits from MitraClip therapy. Age was the most frequent cause for denying surgery in elderly patients.\n\nFailure of acute procedural success predicts adverse outcome after percutaneous edge-to-edge mitral valve repair with MitraClip.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPuls, Miriam; TichelbÃ¤cker, Tobias; Bleckmann, Annalen; HÃ¼nlich, Mark; von der Ehe, Katrin; Beuthner, Bo Eric; RÃ¼ter, Karin; BeiÃbarth, Tim; Seipelt, Ralf; SchÃ¶ndube, Friedrich; HasenfuÃ, Gerd; Schillinger, Wolfgang\n\n2014-01-01\n\nMitraClip implantation is evolving as a potential alternative treatment to conventional surgery in high-risk patients with significant mitral regurgitation (MR). However, outcome predictors are under-investigated. The aim of this study was to identify predictors of midterm mortality and heart failure rehospitalisation after percutaneous mitral valve repair with MitraClip. A total of 150 consecutive patients were followed for a median of 463 days. Survival analyses were performed for baseline characteristics, risk scores and failure of acute procedural success (APS) defined as persisting MR grade 3+ or 4+. Univariate significant risk stratifiers were tested in multivariate analyses using a Cox proportional hazards model. Overall survival was 96% at 30 days, 79.5% at 12 months, and 62% at two years. Multivariate analysis identified APS failure (HR 2.13, p=0.02), NYHA Class IV at baseline (HR 2.11, p=0.01) and STS score â¥12 (HR 2.20, pfailure (HR 2.31, p=0.01) and NYHA Class IV at baseline (HR 1.89, p=0.03) as significant independent predictors of heart failure rehospitalisation. Furthermore, a post-procedural significant decrease in hospitalisation rate could only be observed after successful interventions (0.89Â±1.07 per year before vs. 0.54Â±0.96 after implantation, p=0.01). Patients with severely dilated and overloaded ventricles who did not meet EVEREST II eligibility criteria were at higher risk of APS failure. The failure of acute procedural success proved to have the most important impact on outcome after MitraClip implantation.\n\nCurrent MitraClip experience, safety and feasibility in the Netherlands\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nRahhab, Z.; Kortlandt, F.

Three consecutive patients were treated successfully for severe symptomatic Tricuspid regurgitation. Three-dimensional transoesophageal echocardiography confirmed reduction of measured effective regurgitant orifice in all patients [effective regurgitant orifice area-baseline/post-procedure (cm(2)): 0.7/0.3; 1.5/0.8; 0.4/0.1], which was accompanied by an increase in left ventricular stroke volumes [baseline/post-procedure (mL): 42.8/45.4; 38/45; 35.2/45], decrease of measured levels of N terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (pg/mL: baseline/post-procedure: 548/440; 2526/1702; 1754/623), and significant relief of clinical symptoms for chronic right heart failure in all patients. Transcatheter tricuspid valve repair by use of interventional edge-to-edge repair with the MitraClip system was feasible, and safe in three consecutive patients. Reduction of tricuspid insufficiency associates with relief of clinical symptoms for right heart failure. This strategy seems a promising treatment option for patients at prohibitive surgical risk.

Anesthesia for high risk patients undergoing percutaneous mitral valve repair with the mitraclip system in the catheterization laboratory\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nR. Soliman\n\n2016-07-01\n\nFull Text Available MitraClip system implantation is used inhigh-risk patients with severe mitral regurgitation.anesthetic management for mitral clip implantation. The study included 34patients scheduled for MitraClip implantations in the catheterization laboratory. An arterial line and central venous line were inserted under local anesthesia before induction. Epinephrine was started before induction and milrinone infusion was started after induction. The anesthetic technique for induction and maintenance was the same for all patients. All patients were hemodynamically stable intra- and postoperatively. The intervention was successful in 33 cases and aborted in one case because of severe posteromedial leaflet tethering. The epinephrine and milrinone were weaned and all patients were extubated, except, one case mortality happened within the first 8 hours postoperatively. Percutaneous mitral valve repair with MitraClip implantation is a successful alternative in high-risk patients with symptomatic severe mitral regurgitation. Starting epinephrine before anesthetic induction and milrinone infusion induction resulted in decreased pulmonary artery pressure, increased ejection fraction and maintained arterial blood pressure during procedure inspite of worse preoperative conditions.\n\nLeft cardiac chambers reverse remodeling after percutaneous mitral valve repair with the MitraClip system.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nScandura, Salvatore; Ussia, Gian Paolo; Capranzano, Piera; Caggegi, Anna; Sarkar, Kunal; Cammalleri, Valeria; Mangiafico, Sarah; ChiarandÃ , Marta; ImmÃ¨, Sebastiano; Di Pasqua, Fabio; Pistritto, Anna Maria; Millan, Giovanni; Tamburino, Corrado\n\n2012-10-01\n\nSuccessful mitral valve surgical repair, decreasing volume overload, has been shown to provide reverse left ventricular (LV) and/or left atrial remodeling in most patients. Percutaneous mitral valve repair with the MitraClip system (Abbott, Abbott Park, IL) has been associated with favorable clinical outcomes in patients with mitral regurgitation at high risk of surgery. However, specific data on left cardiac chambers reverse remodeling after such procedures are limited. This was a prospective observational study of consecutive patients at high risk of surgery, with moderate-to-severe or severe mitral regurgitation undergoing MitraClip system implantation. Follow-up echocardiography was performed at 6 months. The evaluated parameters were the LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volume indexes, LV sphericity index, LV ejection fraction, and left atrial volume index. Reverse LV remodeling was defined as a decrease of 10% in the LV end-diastolic volume index. The study population included 44 patients: 14 with degenerative and 30 with functional mitral regurgitation. At 6 months of follow-up, significant reductions in the median and interquartile range of the sphericity index (from 0.57 [interquartile range 0.54-0.62] to 0.54 [interquartile range 0.50-0.58]; P interquartile range 63.0-102.2] to 60.7 mL/m(2) [50.8-84.4]; P interquartile range 28.2-70.5] to 28.9 mL/m(2) [interquartile range 22.2-55.8]; P interquartile range 30.0-55.0%] to 46.0% [interquartile range 35.0-58.0%]; P < .001) from baseline to 6 months. Minor differences in the left atrial volume index were observed. Reverse remodeling, according to the specified definition, was observed in 77.3% of the patients. The present study reports positive LV reshape effects after mitral valve repair with the MitraClip system, showing significant improvements in LV size and function.

Recently, the novel pushing maneuver technique has been described for approaching restricted and short posterior leaflets with a pigtail catheter in order to facilitate grasping of the clip. However, complications or unexpected situations may occur. We report the case of an 84-year-old patient who underwent MitraClip implantation wherein the pushing maneuver was complicated by the clip accidentally gripping the pigtail catheter along with the two leaflets.\n\nClinical outcome of critically ill, not fully recompensated, patients undergoing MitraClip therapy\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nRudolph, Volker; Huntgeburth, Michael; von Bardeleben, Ralph Stephan\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAIMS: As periprocedural risk is low, MitraClip implantation is often performed in critically ill, not fully recompensated patients, who are in NYHA functional class IV at the time of the procedure, to accelerate convalescence.

The aim of this study was to investigate gender differences in outcomes in a cohort of patients treated with MitraClip implantation. A multicenter registry of 173 patients treated with MitraClip prostheses from 2009 to 2012 at 3 experienced centers was performed. One hundred nine patients (63%) were men. Men were younger (mean age 73 Â± 10 vs 79 Â± 9 years, p = 0.001) and had a higher prevalence of previous coronary bypass graft surgery (34% vs 13%, p = 0.002), previous myocardial infarction (46% vs 20%, p = 0.001), and diabetes mellitus (26% vs 11%, p = 0.020). There were no differences regarding New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class before the intervention (NYHA class III or IV in 95% of men vs 97% of women, p = 0.472) or the cause of mitral regurgitation (MR) (functional in 58% of men vs 48% of women, p = 0.233). Men exhibited significantly larger ventricles (mean indexed left ventricular end-systolic diameter 2.4 Â± 0.8 vs 2.0 Â± 1.6 cm/m(2), p = 0.002, and mean indexed left ventricular end-diastolic volume 92.7 Â± 46.1 vs 59.9 Â± 24.6 ml/m(2), p effective treatment of MR in men and women.

Thirty-three consecutive patients who underwent mitral valve surgery in our institution were studied. At a median of 41 days, they had previously undergone one to five futile MitraClip implantations. At the time of their operations, patients were 72.6 Â± 10.3 years old, and the calculated risk, using the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE) II, was a median of 26.5%. Individual outcomes were recorded, and all patients were monitored postoperatively. Thirty-day mortality was 9.1%, and the overall survival at 2.2 years was 60.6%. Seven cardiac-related and six noncardiac deaths occurred. Univariate survival regression models demonstrated a significant influence of the following variables on survival: EuroSCORE II (p = 0.0022), preoperative left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (p = 0.0052), left ventricular ejection fraction (p = 0.0249), coronary artery disease (p = 0.0385), and severe pulmonary hypertension (p = 0.0431). Survivors showed considerable improvements in their New York Heart Association class (p < 0.0001), left ventricular ejection fraction (p = 0.0080), grade of mitral regurgitation (p = 0.0350), and mitral valve area (p = 0.0486). Survival after mitral repair was not superior to survival after replacement. Indications for surgery after failed MitraClip procedures must be considered with the greatest of care. Variables predicting postoperative survival should be taken into account regarding the difficult decision as to whether to operate or not. Our data suggest that replacement of the pretreated mitral valve is probably the more reasonable concept rather than complex repairs. When the EuroSCORE II at the time of surgery exceeds 30%, conservative therapy is advisable. Copyright Â© 2016 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of mitral annulus remodeling on the reduction of mitral regurgitation in patients with functional etiology. The study included all patients with functional mitral regurgitation treated with MitraClip at our hospital until January 2015. Echocardiogram (iE33 model, Philips) was performed in all patients immediately after device positioning. Changes in the mitral annulus correlated with mitral regurgitation severity, as assessed using the effective regurgitant orifice area. The study included 23 patients (age, 65Â±14 years; 74% men; left ventricular ejection fraction, 31%Â±13%; systolic pulmonary artery pressure, 47Â±10 mmHg). After the procedure, the regurgitant orifice area decreased by 0.30 cm 2 Â±0.04 cm 2 (P<.0005), from a baseline of 0.49 cm 2 Â±0.09 cm 2 . Anteroposterior diameter decreased by 3.14 mmÂ±1.01 mm (P<.0005) from a baseline of 28.27 mmÂ±4.9 mm, with no changes in the intercommissural diameter (0.50 mmÂ±0.91 mm vs 40.68 mmÂ±4.7 mm; P=.26). A significant association was seen between anteroposterior diameter reduction and regurgitant orifice area reduction (r=.49; P=.020). In patients with functional mitral regurgitation, the MitraClip device produces an immediate reduction in the anteroposterior diameter. This remodeling may be related to the reduction in mitral regurgitation. Copyright Â© 2016 Sociedad EspaÃ±ola de CardiologÃ­a. Published by Elsevier EspaÃ±a, S.L.U.

The frequency of adverse events has also increased, but the data related to acute central nervous system complications during acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment are sparse. The purpose of this study is to evaluate these complications and to determine their long term outcome. We retrospectively analyzed the hospital reports of 323 children with de novo acute lymphoblastic leukemia from a 13-year period for acute neurological complications. The central nervous system complications of leukemic involvement, peripheral neuropathy, and post-treatment late-onset encephalopathy, and neurocognitive defects were excluded. Twenty-three of 323 children (7.1%) suffered from central nervous system complications during acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment. The majority of these complications (n = 13/23; 56.5%) developed during the induction period. The complications included posterior reversible encephalopathy (n = 6), fungal abscess (n = 5), cerebrovascular lesions (n = 5), syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (n = 4), and methotrexate encephalopathy (n = 3). Three of these 23 children (13%) died of central nervous system complications, one from an intracranial fungal abscess and the others from intracranial thrombosis. Seven of the survivors (n = 7/20; 35%) became epileptic and three of them had also developed mental and motor retardation. Acute central neurological complications are varied and require an urgent approach for proper diagnosis and treatment. Collaboration among the hematologist, radiologist, neurologist, microbiologist, and neurosurgeon is essential to prevent fatal outcome and serious morbidity. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

However, its clinical impact is not fully elucidated. This study assessed the impact of postprocedural MVA reduction on pulmonary hypertension and outcomes. A total of 92 patients with grades 3 to 4Â + mitral regurgitation (MR) who underwent MitraClip therapy were retrospectively reviewed. Using intraprocedural, 3-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography, postprocedural MVA was obtained by 2 optimized planes through the medial and lateral orifices of the repaired valve. MVA was reduced by 60.1% immediately after MitraClip procedure (p <0.001). Postprocedural MVA correlated moderately with mean transmitral pressure gradient (TMPG) in the majority of patients (rÂ =Â -0.56, p <0.001), but discordance of MVA and TMPG was observed in 40% of patients. In multivariable linear regression analysis, postprocedural MVA â¤1.94Â cm 2 was independently associated with a blunted decrease in systolic pulmonary artery pressure at 1-month follow-up (Î²-estimateÂ -4.63, 95% confidence intervalÂ -9.71 toÂ -0.15, pÂ =Â 0.042). Postprocedural MVA â¤1.94Â cm 2 was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalization after MitraClip (hazard ratio 4.28, 95% confidence interval 1.56 to 11.7, pÂ = 0.005) even after adjustment for age, gender, atrial fibrillation, cause of MR, left ventricular systolic function, pre-existing pulmonary hypertension, and residual MR. After further adjustment for TMPG â¥5Â mm Hg, postprocedural MVA â¤1.94Â cm 2 remained predictive for adverse outcomes (pÂ = 0.048). In conclusion, the intraprocedural assessment of MVA by 3-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography can predict hemodynamic response and postprocedural prognosis after MitraClip therapy.

Given the well-known drawbacks of the regular treatments for acute gout (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine), systemic corticosteroids might be safe alternatives. OBJECTIVES: To assess the\n\nGHS additivity formula: can it predict the acute systemic toxicity of agrochemical formulations that contain acutely toxic ingredients?\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nVan Cott, Andrew; Hastings, Charles E; Landsiedel, Robert; Kolle, Susanne; Stinchcombe, Stefan\n\n2018-02-01\n\nIn vivo acute systemic testing is a regulatory requirement for agrochemical formulations. GHS specifies an alternative computational approach (GHS additivity formula) for calculating the acute toxicity of mixtures. We collected acute systemic toxicity data from formulations that contained one of several acutely-toxic active ingredients. The resulting acute data set includes 210 formulations tested for oral toxicity, 128 formulations tested for inhalation toxicity and 31 formulations tested for dermal toxicity. The GHS additivity formula was applied to each of these formulations and compared with the experimental in vivo result. In the acute oral assay, the GHS additivity formula misclassified 110 formulations using the GHS classification criteria (48% accuracy) and 119 formulations using the USEPA classification criteria (43% accuracy). With acute inhalation, the GHS additivity formula misclassified 50 formulations using the GHS classification criteria (61% accuracy) and 34 formulations using the USEPA classification criteria (73% accuracy). For acute dermal toxicity, the GHS additivity formula misclassified 16 formulations using the GHS classification criteria (48% accuracy) and 20 formulations using the USEPA classification criteria (36% accuracy). This data indicates the acute systemic toxicity of many formulations is not the sum of the ingredients' toxicity (additivity); but rather, ingredients in a formulation can interact to result in lower or higher toxicity than predicted by the GHS additivity formula.

Its diagnosis is a highly complex task, for which modelling through automated methods has been attempted. A systematic review of the literature was performed on diagnostic tests that applied intelligent systems tools in the diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes. A systematic review of the literature is presented using Medline, Embase, Scopus, IEEE/IET Electronic Library, ISI Web of Science, Latindex and LILACS databases for articles that include the diagnostic evaluation of acute coronary syndromes using intelligent systems. The review process was conducted independently by 2 reviewers, and discrepancies were resolved through the participation of a third person. The operational characteristics of the studied tools were extracted. A total of 35 references met the inclusion criteria. In 22 (62.8%) cases, neural networks were used. In five studies, the performances of several intelligent systems tools were compared. Thirteen studies sought to perform diagnoses of all acute coronary syndromes, and in 22, only infarctions were studied. In 21 cases, clinical and electrocardiographic aspects were used as input data, and in 10, only electrocardiographic data were used. Most intelligent systems use the clinical context as a reference standard. High rates of diagnostic accuracy were found with better performance using neural networks and support vector machines, compared with statistical tools of pattern recognition and decision trees. Extensive evidence was found that shows that using intelligent systems tools achieves a greater degree of accuracy than some clinical algorithms or scales and, thus, should be considered appropriate tools for supporting diagnostic decisions of acute coronary syndromes.

It includes all important organs and organ systems. The proposed grading corresponds to the four-scale-system of the WHO and UICC. The system is also compatible to the RTOG and EORTC acute and late radiation morbidity scoring criteria. This facilitates the data transfer for retrospective and prospective analysis of monomodal and multimodal radiotherapy treatment regimes. We recommend to use this scoring system in all German speaking countries for multicentric prospective studies. It is possible, that organ-specific sophistications of the toxicity grading will be developed in the future. These additions should conform with (inter)national standards and apply the same four-scale grading of this classification system. (orig.)

Drug treatment is limited to diuretics and the cardiac or pulmonary comorbidities. Due to the high risk only aÂ small percentage of patients are amenable to surgical treatment of tricuspid regurgitation in those who undergo left-sided surgery for other reasons. Catheter-based procedures are an attractive treatment alternative, particularly since the strong prognostic impact of tricuspid regurgitation suggests an unmet need of treatment, independent of the underlying heart disease. A vast amount of clinical experience exists for the MitraClip system for treatment of mitral regurgitation. AÂ first case series shows that the application for treatment of tricuspid regurgitation is technically feasible, seems to be safe and the degree of valve regurgitation can be reduced. In this review the background of tricuspid regurgitation treatment is summarized and first experiences and perspectives with the MitraClip system are assessed.\n\nPerformance of an automated electronic acute lung injury screening system in intensive care unit patients.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKoenig, Helen C; Finkel, Barbara B; Khalsa, Satjeet S; Lanken, Paul N; Prasad, Meeta; Urbani, Richard; Fuchs, Barry D\n\n2011-01-01\n\nLung protective ventilation reduces mortality in patients with acute lung injury, but underrecognition of acute lung injury has limited its use. We recently validated an automated electronic acute lung injury surveillance system in patients with major trauma in a single intensive care unit. In this study, we assessed the system's performance as a prospective acute lung injury screening tool in a diverse population of intensive care unit patients. Patients were screened prospectively for acute lung injury over 21 wks by the automated system and by an experienced research coordinator who manually screened subjects for enrollment in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Clinical Trials Network (ARDSNet) trials. Performance of the automated system was assessed by comparing its results with the manual screening process. Discordant results were adjudicated blindly by two physician reviewers. In addition, a sensitivity analysis using a range of assumptions was conducted to better estimate the system's performance. The Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, an academic medical center and ARDSNet center (1994-2006). Intubated patients in medical and surgical intensive care units. None. Of 1270 patients screened, 84 were identified with acute lung injury (incidence of 6.6%). The automated screening system had a sensitivity of 97.6% (95% confidence interval, 96.8-98.4%) and a specificity of 97.6% (95% confidence interval, 96.8-98.4%). The manual screening algorithm had a sensitivity of 57.1% (95% confidence interval, 54.5-59.8%) and a specificity of 99.7% (95% confidence interval, 99.4-100%). Sensitivity analysis demonstrated a range for sensitivity of 75.0-97.6% of the automated system under varying assumptions. Under all assumptions, the automated system demonstrated higher sensitivity than and comparable specificity to the manual screening method.

In the acute phase, the damaged CNS activates resident and circulating immune cells via the local and systemic release of soluble mediators. This early immune activation is necessary to confine the injured tissue and foster the clearance of cellular debris, thus bringing the inflammatory reaction to a close. In the chronic phase, a sustained immune activation has been described in many CNS disorders, and the degree of this prolonged response has variable effects on spontaneous brain regenerative processes. The challenge for treating acute CNS damage is to understand how to optimally engage and modify these immune responses, thus providing new strategies that will compensate for tissue lost to injury. Herein we have reviewed the available information regarding the role and function of the innate and adaptive immune responses in influencing CNS plasticity during the acute and chronic phases of after injury. We have examined how CNS damage evolves along the activation of main cellular and molecular pathways that are associated with intrinsic repair, neuronal functional plasticity and facilitation of tissue reorganization.

We examined the role of zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 in preclinical models of central nervous system leukemia and performed correlative studies in patients. Zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 expression in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells was modulated using short hairpin ribonucleic acid-mediated knockdown or ectopic expression. We show that zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 regulates CCR7/CXCR4 via activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases. High expression of zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells resulted in a higher proportion of central nervous system leukemia in xenografts as compared to zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 low expressing counterparts. High zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 also enhanced the migration potential towards CCL19/CXCL12 gradients in vitro CCR7 blockade almost abrogated homing of acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells to the central nervous system in xenografts. In 130 B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 117 T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients, zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 and CCR7/CXCR4 expression levels were significantly correlated. Zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 expression correlated with central nervous system disease in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and CCR7/CXCR4 correlated with central nervous system involvement in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. In multivariate analysis, zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 expression levels in the upper third and fourth quartiles were associated with central nervous system involvement in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (odds ratio=7.48, 95% confidence interval, 2.06-27.17; odds ratio=6.86, 95% confidence interval, 1.86-25.26, respectively).

A number of international efforts have been directed at identifying non-animal alternatives for in vivo acute systemic toxicity tests. A September 2015 workshop, Alternative Approaches for Identifying Acute Systemic Toxicity: Moving from Research to Regulatory Testing, reviewed the state-of-the-science of non-animal alternatives for this testing and explored ways to facilitate implementation of alternatives. Workshop attendees included representatives from international regulatory agencies, academia, nongovernmental organizations, and industry. Resources identified as necessary for meaningful progress in implementing alternatives included compiling and making available high-quality reference data, training on use and interpretation of in vitro and in silico approaches, and global harmonization of testing requirements. Attendees particularly noted the need to characterize variability in reference data to evaluate new approaches. They also noted the importance of understanding the mechanisms of acute toxicity, which could be facilitated by the development of adverse outcome pathways. Workshop breakout groups explored different approaches to reducing or replacing animal use for acute toxicity testing, with each group crafting a roadmap and strategy to accomplish near-term progress. The workshop steering committee has organized efforts to implement the recommendations of the workshop participants. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

There exists an urgent need to develop and refine biological measures of acute brain injury and chronic recovery after brain injury. Such measures \"biomarkers\" can assist clinicians in helping to define and refine the recovery process and developing treatment paradigms for the acutely injured to reduce secondary injury processes. Recent biomarker studies in the acute phase of TBI have highlighted the importance and feasibilities of identifying clinically useful biomarkers. However, much less is known about the subacute and chronic phases of TBI. We propose here that for a complex biological problem such as TBI, multiple biomarker types might be needed to harness the wide range of pathological and systemic perturbations following injuries, including acute neuronal death, neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and neuroregeneration to systemic responses. In terms of biomarker types, they range from brain-specific proteins, microRNA, genetic polymorphism, inflammatory cytokines and autoimmune markers and neuro-endocrine hormones. Furthermore, systems biology-driven biomarkers integration can help present a holistic approach to understanding scenarios and complexity pathways involved in brain injury.\n\n78 FR 38679 - Medicare Program; Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems for Acute Care Hospitals and the...\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2013-06-27\n\n...

Labelling for (human) acute toxicity categories is based on experimental findings usually obtained by oral, dermal or inhalative exposure of rodents. There is a strong societal demand for replacing animal experiments conducted for safety assessment of chemicals. Fish embryos are considered as alternative to animal testing and are proposed as predictive model both for environmental and human health effects. Therefore, we tested whether LC50s of the fish embryo acute toxicity test would allow effectively predicting of acute mammalian toxicity categories. A database of published fish embryo LC50 containing 641 compounds was established. For these compounds corresponding rat oral LD50 were identified resulting in 364 compounds for which both fish embryo LC50 and rat LD50 was available. Only a weak correlation of fish embryo LC50 and rat oral LD50 was obtained. Fish embryos were also not able to effectively predict GHS oral acute toxicity categories. We concluded that due to fundamental exposure protocol differences (single oral dose versus water-borne exposure) a reverse dosimetry approach is needed to explore the predictive capacity of fish embryos.

The present study was designed to evaluate the double-button fixation system in the management of acute acromioclavicular joint dislocation. Methods: This cross sectional study, done between February 2011 to June 2014, consisted of 28 patients who underwent surgical management by the double-button fixation system for acute AC joint dislocation. Age, sex, injury mechanism, dominant hand, side with injury, length of follow up, time before surgery, shoulder and hand (DASH), constant and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores, and all complications of the cases during the follow up were recorded. Results: The mean age of patients was 33.23Â±6.7 years. Twenty four patients (85.71%) were male and four (14.28%) were female. The significant differences were observed between pre-operation VAS, constant shoulder scores and post-operation measurements. There were not any significant differences between right and left coracoclavicular, but two cases of heterotrophic ossifications were recorded. The mean follow-up time was 16.17Â±4.38 months. Conclusion: According to the results, the double-button fixation system for management of acute acromioclavicular joint dislocation has suitable results and minimal damage to the soft tissues surrounding the coracoclavicular ligaments.

A viral pathogen was detected in 52 of 132 (39.4%) cases with acute CNS infection. Enteroviruses predominated (15/52, 28.8%), followed by West Nile virus (9/52, 17.3%). Phleboviruses, varicella-zoster virus, and Epstein-Barr virus accounted for 15.4%, 13.5%, and 11.5% of the cases, respectively. The study gives an insight into the etiology of viral CNS infections in a Mediterranean country, where arboviruses should be included in the differential diagnosis of acute CNS infections.

Currently there is no widely accepted method to measure disease activity in patients hospitalized for acute pancreatitis. We aimed to develop a clinical activity index that incorporates routine clinical parameters to assist in the measurement, study, and management of acute pancreatitis. We used the UCLA/RAND appropriateness method to identify items for inclusion in the disease activity instrument. We conducted a systematic literature review followed by two sets of iterative modified Delphi meetings including a panel of international experts between November 2014 and November 2015. The final instrument was then applied to patient data obtained from five separate study cohorts across Southern California to assess profiles of disease activity. From a list of 35 items comprising 6 domains, we identified 5 parameters for inclusion in the final weighted clinical activity scoring system: organ failure, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, abdominal pain, requirement for opiates and ability to tolerate oral intake. We applied the weighted scoring system across the 5 study cohorts comprising 3,123 patients. We identified several distinct patterns of disease activity: (i) overall there was an elevated score at baseline relative to discharge across all study cohorts, (ii) there were distinct patterns of disease activity related to duration of illness as well as (iii) early and persistent elevation of disease activity among patients with severe acute pancreatitis defined as persistent organ failure.

We sought to develop a new systematic classification of acute abdominal pain and to give some helps to physicians encountering difficulties in diagnoses. From March 2005 to May 2010, clinical data were collected retrospectively from 442 children hospitalized due to acute abdominal pain with no apparent underlying disease. According to the final diagnoses, diseases that caused acute abdominal pain were classified into nine groups. The nine groups were group I \"catastrophic surgical abdomen\" (7 patients, 1.6%), group II \"acute appendicitis and mesenteric lymphadenitis\" (56 patients, 12.7%), group III \"intestinal obstruction\" (57 patients, 12.9%), group IV \"viral and bacterial acute gastroenteritis\" (90 patients, 20.4%), group V \"peptic ulcer and gastroduodenitis\" (66 patients, 14.9%), group VI \"hepatobiliary and pancreatic disease\" (14 patients, 3.2%), group VII \"febrile viral illness and extraintestinal infection\" (69 patients, 15.6%), group VIII \"functional gastrointestinal disorder (acute manifestation)\" (20 patients, 4.5%), and group IX \"unclassified acute abdominal pain\" (63 patients, 14.3%). Four patients were enrolled in two disease groups each. Patients were distributed unevenly across the nine groups of acute abdominal pain. In particular, the \"unclassified abdominal pain\" only group was not uncommon.

The early medical management situation requires quantitative indications for early initiation of cytokine therapy in individuals exposed to life-threatening radiation doses and effective triage tools for first responders in mass-casualty radiological incidents. Previously established animal (Mus musculus, Macaca mulatta) total-body irradiation (Î³-exposure) models have evaluated a panel of radiation-responsive proteins that, together with peripheral blood cell counts, create a multiparametic dose-predictive algorithm with a threshold for detection of ~1 Gy from 1 to 7 d after exposure as well as demonstrate the acute radiation syndrome severity score systems created similar to the Medical Treatment Protocols for Radiation Accident Victims developed by Fliedner and colleagues. The authors present a further demonstration of the acute radiation sickness severity score system in a mouse (CD2F1, males) TBI model (1-14 Gy, Co Î³-rays at 0.6 Gy min) based on multiple biodosimetric endpoints. This includes the acute radiation sickness severity Observational Grading System, survival rate, weight changes, temperature, peripheral blood cell counts and radiation-responsive protein expression profile: Flt-3 ligand, interleukin 6, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, thrombopoietin, erythropoietin, and serum amyloid A. Results show that use of the multiple-parameter severity score system facilitates identification of animals requiring enhanced monitoring after irradiation and that proteomics are a complementary approach to conventional biodosimetry for early assessment of radiation exposure, enhancing accuracy and discrimination index for acute radiation sickness response categories and early prediction of outcome.\n\nAcute pancreatitis.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTalukdar, Rupjyoti; Vege, Santhi S\n\n2015-09-01\n\nTo summarize recent data on classification systems, cause, risk factors, severity prediction, nutrition, and drug treatment of acute pancreatitis. Comparison of the Revised Atlanta Classification and Determinant Based Classification has shown heterogeneous results. Simvastatin has a protective effect against acute pancreatitis. Young black male, alcohol, smoldering symptoms, and subsequent diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis are risk factors associated with readmissions after acute pancreatitis. A reliable clinical or laboratory marker or a scoring system to predict severity is lacking. The PYTHON trial has shown that oral feeding with on demand nasoenteric tube feeding after 72âh is as good as nasoenteric tube feeding within 24âh in preventing infections in predicted severe acute pancreatitis. Male sex, multiple organ failure, extent of pancreatic necrosis, and heterogeneous collection are factors associated with failure of percutaneous drainage of pancreatic collections. The newly proposed classification systems of acute pancreatitis need to be evaluated more critically. New biomarkers are needed for severity prediction. Further well designed studies are required to assess the type of enteral nutritional formulations for acute pancreatitis. The optimal minimally invasive method or combination to debride the necrotic collections is evolving. There is a great need for a drug to treat the disease early on to prevent morbidity and mortality.\n\nDouble-button Fixation System for Management of Acute Acromioclavicular Joint Dislocation\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAli Torkaman\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Background: Surgical treatments for acromioclavicular (AC joint dislocation present with some complications. The present study was designed to evaluate the double-button fixation system in the management of acute acromioclavicular joint dislocation. Methods: This cross sectional study, done between February 2011 to June 2014, consisted of 28 patients who underwent surgical management by the double-button fixation system for acute AC joint dislocation. Age, sex, injury mechanism, dominant hand, side with injury, length of follow up, time before surgery, shoulder and hand (DASH, constant and visual analogue scale (VAS scores, and all complications of the cases during the follow up were recorded. Results: The mean age of patients was 33.23Â±6.7 years. Twenty four patients (85.71% were male and four (14.28% were female. The significant differences were observed between pre-operation VAS, constant shoulder scores and post-operation measurements (P=0.001, P=0.0001, P=0.0001, respectively. There were not any significant differences between right and left coracoclavicular (P=0.238, but two cases of heterotrophic ossifications were recorded. The mean follow-up time was 16.17Â±4.38 months. Conclusion: According to the results, the double-button fixation system for management of acute acromioclavicular joint dislocation has suitable results and minimal damage to the soft tissues surrounding the coracoclavicular ligaments.\n\nCasemix classification payment for sub-acute and non-acute inpatient care, Thailand.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKhiaocharoen, Orathai; Pannarunothai, Supasit; Zungsontiporn, Chairoj; Riewpaiboon, Wachara\n\n2010-07-01\n\nThere is a need to develop other casemix classifications, apart from DRG for sub-acute and non-acute inpatient care payment mechanism in Thailand. To develop a casemix classification for sub-acute and non-acute inpatient service. The study began with developing a classification system, analyzing cost, assigning payment weights, and ended with testing the validity of this new casemix system. Coefficient of variation, reduction in variance, linear regression, and split-half cross-validation were employed. The casemix for sub-acute and non-acute inpatient services contained 98 groups. Two percent of them had a coefficient of variation of the cost of higher than 1.5. The reduction in variance of cost after the classification was 32%. Two classification variables (physical function and the rehabilitation impairment categories) were key determinants of the cost (adjusted R2 = 0.749, p = .001). Validity results of split-half cross-validation of sub-acute and non-acute inpatient service were high. The present study indicated that the casemix for sub-acute and non-acute inpatient services closely predicted the hospital resource use and should be further developed for payment of the inpatients sub-acute and non-acute phase.\n\nRadiotherapy of the central nervous system in acute leukemia\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nNovak, L.J.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nThe central nervous system (CNS) is a site of occult and overt involvement with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children.

With increasing numbers of patients being treated the success of procedure becomes a key issue. We sought to investigate the pre-procedural predictors of device failure in patients with advanced HF treated with MitraClip. From April 2012 to November 2016, 76 patients with poor functional class (NYHA class III-IV) and severe left ventricular (LV) remodeling underwent MitraClip implantation at University Hospitals of Trieste and Bologna (Italy). Device failure was assessed according to MVARC criteria. Patients were subsequently followed to additionally assess the patient success after 12months. Mean age was 67Â±12years, the mean Log-EuroSCORE was 23.4Â±16.5%, and the mean LV end-diastolic volume index and ejection fraction (EF) were 112Â±33ml/m 2 and 30.6Â±8.9%, respectively. At short-term evaluation, device failure was observed in 22 (29%) patients. Univariate predictors of device failure were LVEF, LV and left atrial volumes and anteroposterior mitral annulus diameter. Annulus dimension (OR 1.153, 95% CI 1.002-1.327, p=0.043) and LV end-diastolic volume (OR 1.024, 95% CI 1.000-1.049, p=0.049) were the only variables independently associated with the risk of device failure at the multivariate model. Pre-procedural anteroposterior mitral annulus diameter accurately predicted the risk of device failure after MitraClip in the setting of advanced HF. Its assessment might aid the selection of the best candidates to percutaneous correction of FMR. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess are common causes of dental pain and arise from an inflamed or necrotic dental pulp, or infection of the pulpless root canal system. Clinical guidelines recommend that the first-line treatment for teeth with symptomatic apical periodontitis or an acute apical abscess should be removal of the source of inflammation or infection by local, operative measures, and that systemic antibiotics are currently only recommended for situations where there is evidence of spreading infection (cellulitis, lymph node involvement, diffuse swelling) or systemic involvement (fever, malaise). Despite this, there is evidence that dentists continue to prescribe antibiotics for these conditions. There is concern that this could contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacterial colonies both within the individual and within the community as a whole. To evaluate the effects of systemic antibiotics provided with or without surgical intervention (such as extraction, incision and drainage of a swelling or endodontic treatment), with or without analgesics, for symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess in adults. We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 1 October 2013); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 9); MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 1 October 2013); EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 1 October 2013) and CINAHL via EBSCO (1980 to 1 October 2013).

To enable more efficient performance of billing activities, a point-of-care (POC) handheld computer technology replaced a paper-based system on an acute pain management service. Using a handheld personal digital assistant (PDA) and software from MDeverywhere (MDe, MDeverywhere, Long Island, NY), we performed a 1-yr prospective observational study of an anesthesiology acute pain management service billings and collections. Seventeen anesthesiologists providing billable acute pain services were trained and entered their charges on a PDA. Twelve months of data, just before electronic implementation (pre-elec), were compared to a 12-m period after implementation (post-elec). The total charges were 4883 for 890 patients pre-elec and 5368 for 1128 patients post-elec. With adoption of handheld billing, the charge lag days decreased from 29.3 to 7.0 (P billing using PDAs to replace a paper-based billing system improved the collection rate and decreased the number of charge lag days with a positive return on investment. The handheld PDA billing system provided POC support for physicians during their daily clinical (e.g., patient locations, rounding lists) and billing activities, improving workflow.\n\nIncidence and risk factors for central nervous system relapse in children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCancela, Camila Silva Peres; Murao, Mitiko; Viana, Marcos Borato; de Oliveira, Benigna Maria\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground Despite all the advances in the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, central nervous system relapse remains an important obstacle to curing these patients. This study analyzed the incidence of central nervous system relapse and the risk factors for its occurrence in children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Methods This study has a retrospective cohort design. The studied population comprised 199 children and adolescents with a diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia followed up at Hospital das Clinicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (HC-UFMG) between March 2001 and August 2009 and submitted to the Grupo Brasileiro de Tratamento de Leucemia da InfÃ¢ncia - acute lymphoblastic leukemia (GBTLI-LLA-99) treatment protocol. Results The estimated probabilities of overall survival and event free survival at 5 years were 69.5% (Â± 3.6%) and 58.8% (Â± 4.0%), respectively. The cumulative incidence of central nervous system (isolated or combined) relapse was 11.0% at 8 years. The estimated rate of isolated central nervous system relapse at 8 years was 6.8%. In patients with a blood leukocyte count at diagnosis â¥ 50 x 109/L, the estimated rate of isolated or combined central nervous system relapse was higher than in the group with a count 50 x 109/L at diagnosis seems to be a significant prognostic factor for a higher incidence of central nervous system relapse in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

A review of the current state of knowledge is attempted in this paper, with appropriate attention given to the complications of multiple valence states and solubility. Selected chromium compounds, particularly hexavalent ones, are carcinogens, corrosives, delayed contact sensitizers, and have the kidney as their primary target organ. But chromium is also an essential element for humans. The body clearly possesses some effective detoxification mechanisms for some degree of exposure to hexavalent chrome compounds. The significant features of acute and chronic chromium toxicity are presented in view of these considerations.\n\nRespiratory Effects and Systemic Stress Response Following Acute Acrolein Inhalation in Rats\n\nData.gov (United States)\n\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency â This data set is an Excel file pertaining to the study that examined nasal, pulmonary, and systemic effects of acrolein in rats acutely exposed to a range of...\n\nAcute Systemic Complications of Convulsive Status Epilepticus-A Systematic Review.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSutter, Raoul; Dittrich, Tolga; Semmlack, Saskia; RÃ¼egg, Stephan; Marsch, Stephan; Kaplan, Peter W\n\n2018-01-01\n\nStatus epilepticus is a neurologic emergency with high morbidity and mortality requiring neurointensive care and treatment of systemic complications. This systematic review compiles the current literature on acute systemic complications of generalized convulsive status epilepticus in adults and their immediate clinical impact along with recommendations for optimal neurointensive care. We searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane library for articles published between 1960 and 2016 and reporting on systemic complications of convulsive status epilepticus. All identified studies were screened for eligibility by two independent reviewers. Key data were extracted using standardized data collection forms. Thirty-two of 3,046 screened articles were included. Acute manifestations and complications reported in association with generalized convulsive status epilepticus can affect all organ systems fueling complex cascades and multiple organ interactions. Most reported complications result from generalized excessive muscle contractions that increase body temperature and serum potassium levels and may interfere with proper and coordinated function of respiratory muscles followed by hypoxia and respiratory acidosis. Increased plasma catecholamines can cause a decay of skeletal muscle cells and cardiac function, including stress cardiomyopathy. Systemic complications are often underestimated or misinterpreted as they may mimic underlying causes of generalized convulsive status epilepticus or treatment-related adverse events. Management of generalized convulsive status epilepticus should center on the administration of antiseizure drugs, treatment of the underlying causes, and the attendant systemic consequences to prevent secondary seizure-related injuries. Heightened awareness, systematic clinical assessment, and diagnostic workup and management based on the proposed algorithm are advocated as they are keys to optimal outcome.\n\n77 FR 43089 - Evaluation of an Up-and-Down Procedure for Acute Dermal Systemic Toxicity Testing: Request for...\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2012-07-23\n\n... vivo acute dermal systemic toxicity tests.

When severe, it requires surgical treatment, repair being the preferred option. The edge-to-edge repair technique treats mitral regurgitation by suturing the leaflets together and creating a double-orifice valve. Due to its relative simplicity and versatility, it has become progressively more widespread. Recently, its percutaneous version has become feasible, and has raised interest thanks to the positive results of the Mitraclip(Â®) device. Edge-to-edge features and evolution have stimulated debate and multidisciplinary research by both clinicians and engineers. After providing an overview of representative studies in the field, here we propose a novel computational approach to the most recent percutaneous evolution of the edge-to-edge technique. Image-based structural finite element models of three mitral valves affected by posterior prolapse were derived from cine-cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. The models accounted for the patient-specific 3D geometry of the valve, including leaflet compound curvature pattern, patient-specific motion of annulus and papillary muscles, and hyperelastic and anisotropic mechanical properties of tissues. The biomechanics of the three valves throughout the entire cardiac cycle was simulated before and after Mitraclip(Â®) implantation, assessing the biomechanical impact of the procedure. For all three simulated MVs, Mitraclip(Â®) implantation significantly improved systolic leaflets coaptation, without inducing major alterations in systolic peak stresses. Diastolic orifice area was decreased, by up to 58.9%, and leaflets diastolic stresses became comparable, although lower, to systolic ones. Despite established knowledge on the edge-to-edge surgical repair, latest technological advances make its percutanoues implementation a challenging field of research. The modeling approach herein proposed may be expanded to analyze clinical scenarios that\n\nAcute and prolonged complement activation in the central nervous system during herpes simplex encephalitis.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nEriksson, Charlotta E; Studahl, Marie; BergstrÃ¶m, Tomas\n\n2016-06-15\n\nHerpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) is characterized by a pronounced inflammatory activity in the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we investigated the acute and prolonged complement system activity in HSE patients, by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for numerous complement components (C). We found increased cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of C3a, C3b, C5 and C5a in HSE patients compared with healthy controls. C3a and C5a concentrations remained increased also compared with patient controls. Our results conclude that the complement system is activated in CNS during HSE in the acute phase, and interestingly also in later stages supporting previous reports of prolonged inflammation.

Curcumin, a natural compound, exerts CNS anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective functions mainly after chronic treatment. However, its effect after acute treatment has not been well investigated. In the present study, we provide evidence that 50 mg/kg of curcumin, orally administered for 2 consecutive days before a single intraperitoneal injection of a high dose of LPS (5 mg/kg in young adult mice prevents the CNS immune response. Curcumin, able to enter brain tissue in biologically relevant concentrations, reduced acute and transient microglia activation, pro-inflammatory mediator production, and the behavioral symptoms of sickness. In addition, short-term treatment with curcumin, administered at the time of LPS challenge, anticipated the recovery from memory impairments observed 1 month after the inflammatory stimulus, when mice had completely recovered from the acute neuroinflammation. Together, these results suggest that the preventive effect of curcumin in inhibiting the acute effects of neuroinflammation could be of value in reducing the long-term consequences of brain inflammation, including cognitive deficits such as memory dysfunction.\n\nPatient-specific cardiac phantom for clinical training and preprocedure surgical planning.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLaing, Justin; Moore, John; Vassallo, Reid; Bainbridge, Daniel; Drangova, Maria; Peters, Terry\n\n2018-04-01\n\nMinimally invasive mitral valve repair procedures including MitraClip Â® are becoming increasingly common. For cases of complex or diseased anatomy, clinicians may benefit from using a patient-specific cardiac phantom for training, surgical planning, and the validation of devices or techniques. An imaging compatible cardiac phantom was developed to simulate a MitraClip Â® procedure. The phantom contained a patient-specific cardiac model manufactured using tissue mimicking materials. To evaluate accuracy, the patient-specific model was imaged using computed tomography (CT), segmented, and the resulting point cloud dataset was compared using absolute distance to the original patient data. The result, when comparing the molded model point cloud to the original dataset, resulted in a maximum Euclidean distance error of 7.7Â mm, an average error of 0.98Â mm, and a standard deviation of 0.91Â mm. The phantom was validated using a MitraClip Â® device to ensure anatomical features and tools are identifiable under image guidance. Patient-specific cardiac phantoms may allow for surgical complications to be accounted for preoperative planning. The information gained by clinicians involved in planning and performing the procedure should lead to shorter procedural times and better outcomes for patients.\n\nChildhood central nervous system leukemia: historical perspectives, current therapy, and acute neurological sequelae\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nLaningham, Fred H.

Effects of tubercular meningitis, a form of chronic meningitis on hypothalamic pituitary axis, are well known both at the time of diagnosis and after few months to years of illness. However, there are few reports of pituitary dysfunction in subjects with acute CNS infections. Therefore, this study was aimed at evaluating the pituitary hormonal profile in patients with nonmycobacterial acute meningitis at the time of presentation. Materials and Methods: This prospective case series study included 30 untreated adult patients with acute meningitis, meningoencephalitis, or encephalitis, due to various nonmycobacterial agents, admitted and registered with Lok Nayak Hospital, Maulana Aazd Medical College, New Delhi, between September 2007 and March 2009. Patients with preexisting endocrine diseases, tubercular meningitis and patients on steroids were carefully excluded from the study. The basal pituitary hormonal profile was measured by the electrochemilumniscence technique for serum cortisol, luetinizing hormone (LH, follicular stimulating hormone (FSH, prolactin (PRL, thyrotropin (TSH, free tri-iodothyronine (fT3, and free thyroxine (fT4.
