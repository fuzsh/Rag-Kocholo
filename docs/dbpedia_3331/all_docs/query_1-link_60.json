Bratton’s Richard is more restrained — he’s a deeply spiritual man who seems determined not to give his captors the satisfaction of seeing him in anguish. As both Micah and the guard Petre, McIver delivers a strong, believable performance.\n\nDirector Stephen Waldschmidt, who also designed the simple but symbolic set, keeps the story moving, but it feels as if there’s a long stretch that stays stuck on more or less the same emotional note — namely the resilience of the Christian captives who rely upon their faith in God to resist the agony their physical and spiritual selves are being put through.\n\nTowards the conclusion, when Richard puts it all into words — that each of them are the Body of Christ, and that their suffering is a kind of commitment to God — a little light begins to shine in on the gloom. But it’s still more or less a made-in-Eastern-Europe brand of bulb doing the illuminating, and we all know how well that worked out.\n\nWe Are the Body\n\nat the Pumphouse through May 23\n\nburntthicket.com\n\nThree and a half stars\n\nshunt@calgaryherald.com\n\ntwitter.com/halfstep\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
