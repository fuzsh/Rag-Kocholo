        "text": "A Very Potter Musical\n\nLost Boys Theatre Company\n\nMetro Arts Studio\n\n2nd – 4th February 2012\n\nIf you’ve seen on YouTube, A Very Potter Musical (Book & Score by Darren Criss & A.J. Holmes), you’re already either a big fan or a hater. Haters gonna’ hate, y’all. But the big fans got themselves and their friends along to Metro Arts on the weekend to see The Lost Boys Theatre Company’s stellar starter production. Yes, it was their debut on the Brisbane theatre scene. Yes, there are some things that will improve in future with a little more attention to detail across the board but this was a great, fun, free show, delivered confidently, by a new, fun-loving company who deserves our support.\n\nThe brainchild of Joshua Correa (Director) and Sarah Harvey (Producer), the Lost Boys are a group of very young, very talented performers who claim they are “not trying to be the BEST theatre company, just the COOLEST.” A few of the faces are familiar because, well, performers gonna’ perform, aren’t they?\n\nThis is not the production you’ll see online. Starkid Productions, a group of music, theatre and dance students from the University of Michigan’s School of Music, created a cheeky parody (for $150) for their families and friends, of J.K. Rowling’s successful stories about The Boy Who Lived and helped by other comedies such asStarship and Me and My Dick – I didn’t make that up – very quickly discovered a worldwide cult fan base of epic proportions. A Very Potter Musical Act 1 Scene 1 has over 8 million hits on YouTube!\n\nIf you’ve been living under a rock or at Pigfarts, on Mars, you might not know the story so here’s a brief synopsis. Reluctant kid wizard, Harry Potter (The Boy Who Lived), returns for a new year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with his friends, Hermione and Ron, basically to study as little as possible and to kill Harry’s nemesis, Voldemort (The Dark Lord), who is living parasitically at the back of Professor Quirrell’s head. What the Lost Boys have done very well is to make this production their own and in doing so, they have improved on the original.\n\nThis Harry Potter is written as a self-absorbed, fame-affected prick and Dakota Striplin, last seen (with Tom Oliver and Emma Taviani) in Oscar Theatre Company’s Spring Awakening (2011), plays it to the hilt, as well as playing guitar throughout, which gives him a real rock star quality – including the unlikeable bits brought about by fame and fortune – lifting the game from the outset. Another notable improvement is that Clay English has choreographed where Starkid has not and despite seeing all of English’s best Broadway/YTT moves in the opening number, the energy and parody benefit.\n\nThe band was split, with the drummer on stage, and not just onstage but upstage dead centre, a spot that would otherwise have made a convenient entrance and exit. I hated seeing the tabs either side pushed aside to make way for the performers. The band is terrific (only Musical Director, Ben Murray, is credited in the program), however; early on they drown out unamplified voices. Now, in the small Studio space, the voices shouldn’t need amplification but if you’ve got a loud band and inexperienced singers without the vocal strength required to fill even that small space, do amplify them (or box your band)! Tough gig, Joel Redding (Sound Designer). A simple, open set serves the performers well (Set Designer Daniel Harvey) and, ably lit by Michael Rogerson (Lighting Designer), we focus on the characters and their ridiculous, OTT antics.\n\nEmma Taviani is a sweet, book-hugging Hermione, The Bold and The Beautiful of this production, complete with fixed gazes out front prior to her exits. Tom Oliver is a continuously snacking, hilarious Ron Weasley. This role allows Oliver’s comic and vocal ability to come through in a most relaxed manner. As Severus Snape, Cameron Whitton is the ultimate sneering, gliding, glaring, suspicious professor, making the most of his sweeping and dramatic entrances and exits. In boxer shorts, blue cape and rainbow hat, is Robert Pigdon as Dumbledore, more oddball than endearing, with an odd NYC accent that seemed out of place (as it does in the original). I should mention at this point, in case you’re imagining that due to its British origin, this is a British story with British accents, the vast majority of characters speak (and sing) in American accents. Do the American accents make the show funnier? Not really, just more American. And which generation is enjoying the additional American-accented course language? I wonder. On the other hand, scene-stealer, Lauren Neilson, played pretty Draco Malfoy as the British snob that he is. Although Neilson seemed at first inexperienced or insecure, mimicking the original performance, she warmed to the role, rose to its challenges and ended up delivering a better version of it with some fabulous comedy, mostly in the form of completely over the top choreographed…well, everything! Her every line was supported by fluid and controlled athletic-balletic-Matrix moves that had the audience falling about laughing until we are crying. I would like to see even more time taken over these moves, now that the joke has been tried and tested in front of an audience (and executed with far greater competence than that which we see on YouTube). But sadly, the season is done. Neilson could not have executed many of her moves without the able assistance of her comical henchmen, Lachlan Geraghty (Crabbe) and Nic Mohr (Goyle). Some great character work there. Sally Lloyd was lovely as Ginny Weasely and would certainly develop vocal strength and greater confidence before the end of a longer run.\n\nTogether, Anthony Craig as Professor Quirrell and George Kennedy as Voldemort, were bosom buddies of the most bizarre kind. The cooperative work of this kooky couple was fantastic and Kennedy’s song and dance number a showstopper. The ensemble was complete with Allison Nipperess (Neville Longbottom), Kristen Barros (Mrs Weasley/Pansy), Kelly Smith (Bellatrix Le’strange), Samantha Lan (Lavender Brown) and Lauren Jimmieson (Cho Chang).\n\nA Very Potter Musical is a wonderfully, funny, quirky show, with catchy, toe-tapping tunes and politically incorrect jibes and in-jokes, which the true fans of Harry Potter must drink up just as easily as their butterbeer, which, strangely, was not available at the theatre, nor downstairs at Verve. An oversight? Too short a season to offer it? Not necessary? I’ve provided a recipe below so you may BYO (Brew Your Own) the next time this show comes to Brisbane. Despite the lack of butterbeer (or chocolate frogs for that matter), the diverse pool of talent involved in this production indicates that The Lost Boys Theatre Company is one to watch and this, their debut effort, performed for free, is one to applaud.\n\nJames and the Giant Peach\n\nHarvest Rain\n\nQPAC Cremorne Theatre\n\n5th – 21st January 2012\n\nI can’t stand Pantomime. There. I said it. I think I said it last year too. I’m just not a fan of the genre. There’s a place for it. It employs people. It entertains loads of other people. It’s light, fun, mindless, colourful, musical and quite often cute. But it’s not for me. Let me tell you why children and (other) adults appear to enjoy pantomime.\n\n1. Pantomime is fun and free from heavy morals, ethics and politics\n\n2. Pantomime is colourful, musical, choreographed and cute\n\n3. Pantomime is funny and can be a little bit crazy or naughty\n\n4. Pantomime quite often requires boys to dress as girls (see 3)\n\n5. Pantomime is inter-active (see 3 & 4)\n\nAlso, importantly, Pantomime is usually scheduled in school holidays, which makes it an obvious choice for parents. And if the company does a good job, even the slightly more reticent adults in a pantomime audience will eventually clap along and cry “BOO!” and “HISS!” and “HOORAH!” Like me, however; unless they are completely engaged (a hard ask, to engage adults and children simultaneously on two different levels and very few performers can pull it off), some of them will participate for the sake of the children. Others will love being a part of a theatrical production that brings back memories of the fun they had somewhere, sometime as a child, probably at Christmas time, with an audience of strangely unfamiliar cousins and uncles and aunts looking on in the living room. There is something creepy in that but perhaps my imagination gets away on me.\n\nThis pantomime, James and the Giant Peach, adapted by David Wood, from the original story by Roald Dahl, works less successfully on stage than one might expect. I’ve never thought there was much story in it but it’s a fantastic tale, which should probably translate to the stage a little better than that which Wood has done with it. Sometimes stage adaptations are like the long-awaited film after we’ve read the book. The film doesn’t live up to our expectations because we have, in our limitless imaginations, already seen what will (“should”) be.\n\nWhat Harvest Rain does well, to kick off their family friendly 2012 season (The Wizard of Oz is next, from February 10th – 19th), is to give us the giant peach, very simply and cleverly, on a big revolve, in a big reveal, which I won’t give away entirely because it’s one of the highlights of the show. Needless to say, the peach is GIGANTIC. AND ROUND. AND PEACH COLOURED. It’s beautifully lit (Lighting Design Jason Glenwright) and it is home to several delightful creature characters (Sandro Collarelli, Clare Finlayson, Belinda Heit, Judy Hainsworth and Dash Kruck), all of which take up residence in the peach and, along with James (Jack Kelly), in a bid to escape, after his parents are killed in a regrettable encounter with a rampaging rhinoceros, two terrible, horrible, mean and nasty guardian aunts (Heit & Hainsworth), to seek adventure in New York City. I can only assume that the first 10 minutes of the show are scripted, or at least, outlined in the script, because it sets a NYC precedent for us Aussies, who, you know, like, probably wouldn’t know where NYC is or, like, what the Statue of Liberty looks like. I found the opening a little condescending, confusing and wondered if it was necessary. Does the book begin in the same way? The film? I don’t remember. Why not just start the show? It was as frustrating as The Princess Bride being book ended by that annoying kid listening to his grandfather read the story, you know, the original annoying kid, the one before Macauley Culkin, no, not Doogie Howser (thank goodness he grew up to be Neil Patrick-Harris), the one before him; Fred Savage. That’s it. That’s him. That’s thanks to my IMDB app.\n\nAnyway, far from being annoying (you can’t help but adore him), Dash Kruck plays the odd little role of tour guide (and then an old man and then a centipede) and almost saves the opening segment. In fact, Kruck proves, once again, to be the hardest working actor on stage. But he’s miscast and would be better utilised in the role of James, in terms of storytelling, reading the crowd and working it (incidentally, Kelly could give us a more confident performance if he were focused on playing just James and not James the Narrator). Let’s face it; Kruck has the skill set for children’s entertainment. Create a Narrator and give him the role of Narrator. He’s a little wasted in multiple small roles and I don’t mean in a New Year’s recovery party way.\n\nThe ensemble works well together, making the most of some terrible lines, and creating the motion of the peach by their movement. They bring to mind images of The Whos being blown about by the wind in their tiny city on top of a clover inSeussical the Musical. The show really starts with these fabulous looking friends (Josh McIntosh’s 1950’s/Robots inspired costumes are seriously funky), although the aunts get some good belly laughs early on and later, they enjoy from the safety of the wings, raucous appreciation for their timely demise beneath the runaway (rollaway) peach! Maitlohn Drew’s original songs are delightful and have not been given nearly enough attention, as if they have been slotted in after minimal rehearsal. The singers seem uncertain of their cues, resulting in clunky, uncomfortable starts to songs and the choreography, though cute, is somewhat limited by the confines of the peach (Choreography Callum Masfield). It’s unclear when we reach the end of the show that it is, indeed, over!\n\nJames and the Giant Peach is a visual feast and lots of fun for the kids but if you’ve seen a Tim O’Connor panto, you’ve seen this one too. Of course, this is no problem for the kids (unless they are a little older and a little more discerning) and it’s a great, hour-long introduction to the theatre as well as a lovely, easy venue to bring the children. In fact, with three major productions suitable for children currently showing at QPAC, there’s no excuse for your family to miss anything as magical as a trip to the theatre. Harvest Rain’sJames and the Giant Peach is your most affordable option.\n\nMary Poppins\n\nDisney & Cameron Mackintosh\n\nQPAC Lyric Theatre\n\n30th December 2011 – 17th March 2012\n\nMary Poppins is pure magic. If you can find a way to afford it and you can still get the tickets, take the whole family. It is heartwarming, uplifting, life-lesson-learning stuff. It’s also lots of fun.\n\nWith Musical Direction by Michael Tyack, new material by George Stiles and Anthony Drewe, musical numbers we know and love by Sherman and Sherman and the original book by Julian Fellowes, based on stories by P.L. Travers, everybody’s favourite nanny takes grown ups and a whole new generation of theatregoers on a magical, joyful journey.\n\nHelpmann and Green Room Award winner, Verity Hunt-Ballard, IS Mary Poppins. She has a slightly sharper quality, both in voice and manner, than we might have anticipated but she also has the air of authority and the supreme self-confidence that comes from someone who is Practically Perfect. And it suits her. Hunt-Ballard is the essence of the “white magic”, which Travers described to her first publisher, George William Russell, editor of The Irish Statesman, before his death in 1935. Her first book of Mary Poppins Stories had been published in 1934. Her imagination was her sanctuary and from it came a whimsical world, unlike her real life, in which her mother was suicidal and her alcoholic father had died when she was seven, leaving her to raise her two younger sisters with little support.\n\nCameron Mackintosh’s stage version of the best loved and highest grossing Disney film, certainly packs a punch for younger punters. At just over two and a half hours (including interval), it’s not exactly short and sweet. And it’s not without its darker moments, either. The arrival of Mrs Andrew, the nanny/tyrant who made Mr Banks what he is (Natalie Gamsu, wonderfully frightening and funny in her completely OTT Katisha-ish from The Mikado manner) and Playing the Game, a scene in which the toys come to life and – I’m not sure that I condone the sentiment – take “their turn” to mistreat those who have been unkind to them i.e. the children, reminding us that childhood is as much, if not more so, about facing our fears and learning right from wrong as it is about fun and games. Of course, if you have someone like Mary Poppins around at some stage of your childhood, there is a lesson AND a good dose of fun in everything. You know, a spoonful of sugar and all that stuff.\n\nThe glorious colour, light (Lighting design by Howard Harrison), semi-chaos and casualness of the children’s outings with Mary Poppins are perfectly juxtaposed against the prim and proper paper doll pop-up home on Cherry Tree Lane, the tiny nursery setting particularly effective in eliciting “oohs” and “awwws” from the audience. Costumes too, ideal in their representation of characters and, on Hunt-Ballard, eliciting further murmurs of admiration from the opening night Brisbane audience (Scenic and Costume Design by Bob Crowley).\n\nChoreography by Matthew Bourne and Stephen Mear is delightful and it is executed with precision, enthusiasm and with energy to burn. Ballet aficionados will certainly appreciate the exuberant dance of the statues. Matt Lee, a gentle, adoring Burt (and the story’s narrator), excels in each dance number, with a spectacular performance up and down and across – upside down – the proscenium! Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious (no, I didn’t need to check the spelling, though I won’t attempt to say it backwards) and Step in Time are the showstoppers. And if it were not for a super-talented ensemble, Lee might shine even brighter in this role.\n\nThe children (on opening night they were Rose Shannon-Duhigg and Kurtis Papadinis) are precisely the right amount of proper British precociousness and mischief, mixed up with the insecurity of being part of a household built on order, precision and money, rather than on one in which love is communicated through every thought, word and action. This is a big show for the children and they give it their all, each setting themselves up for a career in musical theatre should they want to continue to work so hard.\n\nAs the picture-perfect turn of the last century couple, Mr and Mrs Banks, Simon Burke and Pippa Grandison bring an exquisitely damaged relationship to the stage, challenging us all to work hard on just the relationships that matter most. Burke is simply superb (if it were not Stories of Mary Poppins, it would be Stories of Mr Banks), his interrupted journey, his misaligned goals and his assumption that the universe conspires against him; so sad and sadly, instantly recognisable. The change, in outlook, attitude and behavior, is believable though and we celebrate with Banks, the re-discovery of simple joys and unconditional, enduring love. There are a couple of poignant moments, the picking up of a homemade kite placed on the floor and an encounter with the Bird Woman (the beautiful Deliah Hannah), which help to win us – and the family – over. If only every grown man had stashed away his gingerbread stars for the inevitable rainy day!\n\nSimilarly, Grandison gives us an underplayed Mrs Banks, the ex-actress-turned-demure-housewife (and a far cry from recent roles in Wicked and Underbelly Razor)! I love Grandison’s conflict and her steadfast belief, as Mrs Banks that she has, indeed, chosen the right role, despite our contemporary persuasions to do and to be everything to everyone. Being Mrs Banks comes across simply and honestly. A microcosm of a master class in serving the lyric and sharing the story, Grandison delivers this new song in the middle of kite-flying and brimstone brewing, to be best remembered by those who have connected personally with it.\n\nWhat a strange joy it is to remove ourselves from the world, hear the giggles and chuckles of children and adults all around, and notice the tears streaming down my own child’s cheeks as we smile and bravely wave goodbye to Mary Poppins after our amazing journey with her and with those characters she has affected. It’s pure magic. It’s the magic of theatre.\n\nThis brand of theatre, Disney and Cam Mack’s special brand, makes Mary Poppins a spectacular production and truly a show for everyone (the merch is the most impressive I’ve seen for a long time too)! Now whether or not you have an opinion about the commercial aspects at play or even fail to openly acknowledge the value of the arts and the wonders of creative thought, imagination and music in your own life, do let your children experience the magic of Mary Poppins. You might find your inner child comes skipping home with you! Anything can happen if you let it!\n\nA Midsummer Night’s Dream\n\nUSQ Alumni Theatre\n\nRoma St Parklands\n\n18th November – 4th December 2011\n\nColourful, highly physical and mostly funny, the USQ Theatre Alumni’s inaugural production A Midsummer Night’s Dream is bringing Roma Street Parklands to life for another week.\n\nMy little family needed no encouragement to prepare a picnic and set up on the grass steps of the amphitheatre, a venue that begs greater use by Brisbane theatre companies. The last production we enjoyed there wasQueensland Shakespeare Ensemble’s Twelfth Night, when Poppy was still in a pram. That’s not to say the place has stood unused since then, it’s just that when one drives from the Sunshine Coast for an outdoor performance, one must consider the weather forecast. As it happened, I had arranged to see the show Thursday night. The day was windy and rainy and the night sky was looking ominous. We decided to see the show on Friday night, under clearer skies, consequently missing Zen Zen Zo’s show in Montville (much closer to home)!\n\nScott Alderdice has in parts, cleverly directed this Dream. Terrific, fun physical comedy supports the text between the lovers particularly and the use of scaffold and some of the pop music (some of it was repetitive or just too much) allows for vibrant energy and pure joy, most noticeable in the energetic, well rehearsed dance routines (choreography by Christine Strahan with Fight Choreography by Nigel Poulton).\n\nFairies and lovers are clad in tattered, layered costumes, boasting rich colour and texture, in contrast to the set, which is a simple matter of three scaffold towers on castors and two enormous white flowers in lieu of a cyc (Designer Carolyn Taylor-Smith). There are two lighting credits in the program, Ben Andrews (Lighting Designer) and Keith Clark (Lighting Realiser) and whilst we enjoy some pretty effects, what is not realised is the need for more light on actors’ faces.\n\nWithin this company there are, as in any newly formed group, some standouts and some bad habits displayed very well by other members. The bad habits surprise me. A leading institution known (among other things) for its vocal work, is letting its Alumni mutter and then shout their lines? I think not. I think inexperience is evident in a few delivery issues and I hope these will be remedied when performers remember that volume does not equate to energy levels. In short, I expect to clearly hear The Bard’s words next time!\n\nOn that – and I’m ready to duck for cover – are we really still needing every word? Is it time we put Shakespeare under the knife? A good Dramaturg could certainly give it a go (and then there’s Short + Sweet Shakespeare but more of that later)! It might be that, like David Lindsay-Abaire’s Pulitzer Prize-winning play, Rabbit Hole, adapted for the screen by the playwright, there is simply an alternative way to get the story across. It’s just an example – it came immediately to mind, having talked about it with someone recently – because structurally, the story probably works better as it unfolds in the film. But rather than major structural change,A Midsummer Night’s Dream might just need a few clever cuts. It’s just a thought remember…purists; you may throw at me whatever is nearest!\n\nMost impressive is Matthew Walsh, as Lysander, full of spritely energy that could just as easily transfer to the role of Puck or to that of a Mechanical. But Lysander he is and as the young lover, he gives us fresh-faced determined and cheeky love that knows no bounds. The running fight that occurs with Demetrius (Ben Rigby/Christopher Hunter) is hilarious – it always reminds me of the fight scenes in Bridget Jones and so I don’t mind telling you that I actually expected, in this semi-contemporary version, to hear, stopping and starting, The Darkness screeching I Believe in a Thing Called Love or Gerri Halliwell belting out It’s Raining Men!\n\nDemetrius and the girls – Helena (Emily Curtain) and Hermia (Kate Murphy) – take a little while to warm up but when they do, Act 2 belongs to The Lovers. Helena, suitably tall and gangly, and Hermia, appropriately puppet-like in her costume and makeup, eventually establish together, a wonderful BFF relationship. Curtain’s comedic talent particularly, is showcased in this role.\n\nTitania (Lauren O’Rourke) is absolutely beautiful in her faery gowns, moving gracefully and singing strongly at first but leaning towards the pitchy end of the spectrum as she grows tired by the end of a particularly big musical number early in the show – too big – and it seems a shame to show us so much, rather than just a taste, like getting to know somebody too well or getting an honest response to the daily query, “How ARE you?” Certainly, when we see a show, we want to see “show fit” performers (and, as performers, we aspire to it; in fact, there is a performing arts school currently auditioning down south that has built itself upon the whole “show fit” triple-threat premise). Perhaps, in this case, the demands were a little too high. Having said that, O’Rourke is an absolute treat to watch (I love her spoken work and her mannerisms, as self-assured in the role of Hippolyta as she is in that of the Faery Queen). She is well matched with her Oberon (Sasha Janowicz). Janowicz has the most commanding presence on stage and as Theseus, his vocal skill and posture give us clear indication of the proud, authoritarian Athenian. But in the forest, I always feel Oberon must be omnipresent and when he is not, I wonder what he is up to! This is no criticism of Janowicz’s work, which is by far the most competent, but an observation of the choices made by the director and an ever-present thought about how much of the original work do we honour in a production? Again, is it a question of staying faithful to the text (and, in this case, what we can only guess might be the intent of the playwright) or do we imagine those moments in between and simply make up a little more of it?!\n\nPuck should be a little monkey-friend/pet/servant, loyal and attentive to the point of annoyance but more often than not, there is no physical or emotional bond between he/she and his/her master. Or not enough. To me, they are the puppeteers and too often are dealt with as separate entities, despite having wonderful dialogue together and, as is the case in this production, some very clever and well punctuated, physical comedy; Oberon gesturing to lasso and draw Puck (Hannah Ellis) to him, Puck choking and spluttering as the imaginary rope tightens around her neck. The relationship on stage could benefit from even more play, as master and chief mischief-maker. A bit like Shrek and Donkey. Seriously!\n\nThis is mostly a really lovely production and there is potential for this company to make its mark on Queensland theatre and on our slight obsession with Outdoor Shakespeare. But the next collective need to narrow their focus and decide what it is they want the company (or at least, the next production) to be. What “sort” of Shakespeare is it? I don’t mind if it’s a different mode and style of delivery every time – I love it all – but it needs to be clear, and confident enough in its own skin so that we feel comfortable too, for two or three hours in the world created by these Athenians and magical creatures!\n\nStorm the Stage – National Finals\n\nJames Gauci with Rotary Club of Cannington & IGA Supermarkets\n\nBrisbane Powerhouse\n\nSunday 27th November 2011\n\nRotary and IGA Supermarkets are keeping the arts alive!\n\nWhen the major sponsors and supporters of a national young performers’ competition are Rotary and an independent supermarket, you have to wonder at the state of performing arts in this country. It’s the question I most often ask. What IS the current state of theatre in this country? Apparently, if you go back and read our recent Briztix interviews with Australian working musical theatre performers, IT’S ALL GOOD. Phew. That’s a relief. Personally, I have no qualms about where the money comes from, not really, however; where was any level of government on this one? Perhaps they weren’t asked to contribute but with the previous sponsor (an offshore philanthropist) devastated by the natural disasters in his own country, unable to continue with his financial support this year, only Rotary and IGA stepped in to ensure the event continued. I’m glad they did because this event gives young performers (16 – 19 years of age) a platform to present their best impression of themselves…before anybody else tells them who they should be.\n\nWithout the grooming along the way by prominent industry personalities, this competition is like a kinder, smaller, live version of The X-Factor. And like The X-Factor, the trick is to find those finalists with that elusive special something that will set them apart. What IS it that sets a performer apart? What makes them a winner in the subjective world of The Arts? What makes “good” art? “Good” theatre? What does good theatre look like anyway? Does anybody know anymore? If you’ve got a blog you’re a critic (hell, if you’ve got a Facebook or a Twitter profile you’re a critic)! BUT “Does anybody know what we are looking for?” Maybe not until we see it and then, once we’ve seen it, experienced it, we want to see it, experience it again. Does it really matter anyway? The show must go on! Most of our high profile performing arts awards are the same popularity contests we see on our screens, decided on by votes from friends and fans of those involved, who login, click to vote and go about their day. One particular Storm the Stage award intrigued me greatly: the Briggs and Gibbs Award for Audience Appeal…decided on by the judges. Because just like the TV audiences who listen to the propaganda created by the publicity departments and executives of the commercial television stations (and recording companies) in this country, we need somebody to tell us what will appeal to us, what’s good… I’m not saying I disagree with the judges’ decision – Queenslander, Mitchell Page was, without appearing on any promotional material, the obvious pin-up boy of this year’s competition…or perhaps, of next year’s competition. Just saying.\n\nSome of the Storm the Stage talent was impressive. Musical Theatre performer, Madeline Crofts, certainly had the voice but lost the story as she focused on switching between the different vocal styles in the challenging number, The Girl in 14G (from the musical of the same name) and Romy Vuksan showed us she is a wonderful dancer in Show Off from The Drowsy Chaperone (that number is up there with Ulla’s in The Producers, in terms of the “deceptively easy to sell” stakes)! Lachlan Graeme and Matty Johnstondemonstrated their comic capabilities in I Really, Really Love You (Sorta Love Songs) and The Ballad of Farquaad (Shrek – The Musical) respectively. Taylah Jarrett – the judges’ choice in the Musical Theatre category – sang beautifully but in neglecting to don a blonde wig, looked nothing like her character, Audrey or Donna Reed, of whom she sings, making Somewhere That’s Greena strange choice for this one-off performance in the finals of a national musical theatre competition. What does good theatre look like? Sound like? Song choice. Attention to detail. Let us into the world of your character and imagine their world is yours.\n\nBut art is not a science! Take a bit of the technique and precision out of it. As vocal coach and musical director, Todd Schroeder teaches, “First, serve the lyric.” Tell the story. Special guest performer from NASDA (National Academy of Singing and Dramatic Art) in New Zealand, Ashleigh Stove, delivered a superb monologue from Skintight, demonstrating her natural ability to feel the rhythm of the language, the discipline of her training and the confidence she possesses at this point in her career, to let it all go and simply be Elizabeth, who shares her story with us. This was, in my opinion, the best performance of the evening but as a special guest performer, of course Ashleigh was ineligible for an award. I’m sure we’ll see her on the professional stage or on our screens sometime soon.\n\nThere is immense value in a competition that awards competitors with honest, constructive feedback, giving them the opportunity to hone their craft a little, which allow them to rehearse and perform in a commercial venue with a professional technical team, in front of a supportive audience. As our Emcee,Drew Jarvis and National Producer, James Gauci, pointed out, young performers in Storm the Stage are undoubtedly gaining confidence and building a valuable network of like-minded creative people. So, like the eisteddfods and in preparation for the awards systems already in place in our Performing Arts Industry, I maintain that this competition is invaluable. It must continue. I will say though, that alternate drama & musical theatre – mostly comedy – is certainly an interesting mix and doesn’t make the most entertaining evening for an audience. If this competition is to grow – and, as I’ve stated, despite my misgivings about the subjective parameters of performing arts awards – it should be allowed to grow, perhaps the drama and musical theatre components can be kept apart.\n\nIn the meantime, young (and old) performers still need to see more theatre! That’s key. I hope most of it’s good but some of it might be bad. And that’s okay. If you’re not seeing and experiencing any of it, how can you expect to work out what “good” is? So see more theatre. Seek new teachers. Take a master class. Engage a vocal coach. Engage an acting coach. Appreciate your training and then be prepared to let it go. Prepare. Compete if that’s your thing (and even if it’s not, remember every audition is a competition) and know that winning doesn’t mean you’ll make it. A lot of hard work, great mentors, good networks, self-belief and a little bit of luck means you might make it.\n\nCongratulations to all the finalists and chookas!\n\nJudges:\n\nPaul Sabey, John Peek and Simone de Haas\n\nWinners:\n\nIn Drama\n\nRunner up: May Grehan Rae’s Story\n\n1st Place: Camilla Best The Seed\n\nIn Musical Theatre\n\nRunner up: Lachlan Graeme I Really, Really Love You\n\n1st Place: Tayla Jarett Somewhere that’s Green\n\nBriggs & Gibbs Award (Audience Appeal): Mitchell Page\n\nFRACTIONS\n\nQTC & Hothouse Theatre\n\nQPAC Cremorne\n\n14th November – 10th December 2011\n\nThis. This play. This playwright. This production. It’s QTC’s final for 2011.\n\nIn Brisbane this year there has not been better theatre than QTC’s production of Marcel Dorney’s award-winning Fractions. It’s been the talk of the town since its first public reading four years ago, let alone since its inclusion in the finals of the Queensland Premier’s Drama Awards (the only playwriting award in the country to guarantee a full-scale production). And the writing IS incredible. It’s little wonder that this play had creatives vying for roles – on stage and off – even before its win.\n\nThis is intriguing, engaging drama from a self-proclaimed “human conflict enthusiast” and for those who don’t think this play’s their thing – it’s mathematics, it’s science, it’s philosophy, it’s religion, it’s humanity – think again and go check it out. You might be surprised.\n\nFractions is not completely fabricated. There was, in ancient Alexandria, a woman named Hypatia, however, very little is known about her. What we do know is that she was mathematician, philosopher, astronomer and teacher, and the last librarian of the massive library housed within the Museum of Alexandria in Egypt. A major intellectual and cultural centre, Hypatia studied and lectured there. At a time when few women held a position of power or influence, Hypatia became the salaried director of the school in 400, established close ties with political figures and regularly challenged Christian popular opinion, a habit which ultimately led to her demise; an horrific death at the hands of a Christian extremist faction. Now, with Dorney’s characters come to life before us, perhaps we know a whole lot more. Imagine!\n\nIt’s not an easy story. On the contrary, it challenges us to consider the way we are living and learning and teaching and communicating today (unforgivingly so). The contemporary street speak and naturalistic delivery, rather than the use of a poised, proper, “ancient” language is an inspired choice, making this work so current, so relevant on so may levels that it becomes quite frightening to think too much on any of it. But we must…although Dorney is reluctant to reveal any obvious lessons, insisting, “we’re in show business – we make entertainment, and Fractions is made for the audience to enjoy, not to study.” Director, Jon Halpin notes, “It’s set 1500 years ago but it speaks with an urgency and relevance to today’s world with more insight and profundity than any other new work I’ve come across.”\n\nJolene Anderson is the imagined Hypatia and I imagine there could be no one better suited in the creation of this role than she. Anderson is a beauty but not in the classical sense. There is nothing really delicate or particularly “feminine” about her (rather, she is striking), yet she exudes a gentleness that her outward manner defies. It is thought that Hypatia wore the gowns of a scholar, rather than the typical feminine garb of the time and she once rejected the advances of a male student by proffering her menstrual rags, in order to demonstrate to him, the lack of beauty, poetry and romance in the carnal. This moment in the play is fierce and that Hypatia might actually have done this, is made completely believable. Anderson, in short, is a study in relaxed, contemporary performance.\n\nWell-known Brisbane actors join her: Hugh Parker as Orestes, the other pagan (in perhaps his best role to date), Jason Klarwein as Kyril, Eugene Gilfedder as Rika and Lucas Stibbard as Synesius. This casting allows us to see Klarwein at his evil, unlikable best! Kyril is not ever supposed to win our sympathy (the audience visibly squirms each time he enters to upset the apple cart) but for some reason, I expected to understand him better so that I knew why I hated him so. A buff Gilfedder, as the guard, Rika, makes the ultimate sacrifice for Hypatia and though his words are few, they are mostly intense and we believe every one of them. Stibbard, having played 24 characters in one show for the last couple of years, plays just two in this production and it is the first, Synesius that we get to know. Just a little. Simon, Stibbard’s second role, serves to reinforce Hypatia’s strength of character and her determination to continue teaching in the face of adversity rather than establish any great journey of his own. It is Parker who impresses most, giving us every thought and good (or questionable) intent behind his political motivations and personal actions, his good humour and turn of phrase. He is the Pontius Pilot, waiting for a chance to wash his hands of blood but the chance never comes. He is the ideal match for Anderson on this stage.\n\nAn Affiliate artist in 2011 and QTC’s Resident Designer in 2012, Simone Romaniuk, has created the entire world and changing moods of the play in a clean, simple, effective design. Complemented by the evocative lighting of Affiliate Artist, Lighting Designer, Ben Hughes and dreamscape style sound by award winning Brett Collery, this is a refreshingly easy set to look at. But the thing that strikes me most about it is the collection of scrolls. The scrolls! Like the truffula trees in the land of The Lorax! Masses and masses of them (scrolls, not truffula trees), stored far above us, in tall, black structures that allow plenty of play space underneath, where the actors dart in and out of shadows and the golden glow tries to bely the evil that is happening outside the walls of the library. All those thousands of books lost. “How do you save a forest?” Imagine.\n\nIt’s not hard to put a finger on what it is about this production that is so powerful. It’s simple really. It starts with the writing. It is brought to life by a talented creative team and an attentive, fully engaged audience consumes it. Like fire. That’s it. It’s GOOD. It’s POWERFUL. It’s THOUGHT-PROVOKING. The ideas and the fears within this play will be listened to – we hope by audiences all over the world – because they are our ideas and our fears (and because we are unequivocally proud of this Queenslander, this Marcel Dorney, regardless of where he is currently based). And we don’t change. Not really. We face our ideas, our fears and all our imaginings in the theatre (remember, the raw form is the original news source) and we think on them and we talk about them for years after the event. Unlike so many big-budget, glossy productions, which I love but I remain skeptical of, Fractions is THAT sort of raw theatre – real theatre – the sort of theatre that stops you in your tracks and demands your attention until story’s end. Don’t miss it and wonder what all the talk was about.\n\nThis review published originally on briztix.com\n\nLittle Birung\n\nJudith Wright Centre of Contemporary Arts & Dr Tulp\n\nJudith Wright Centre of Contemporary Arts\n\n16th – 19th November 2011\n\nADVICE: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders are advised that this review contains names of people who have died.\n\n7 years in the making. 6 generations. 120 years of history.\n\nThis show is deadly, too deadly! It is so deadly that an audience member couldn’t wait until the end of the show to tell Megan so. Slightly stage left of centre, out of the candlelight in the cabaret seating came a small, clear, proud voice, “You’re deadly, Megan!” Laughter. Smiles. Love.\n\nMegan Samardin hails from Mount Isa and calls it home still, despite her recent success, which has come from the Helpmann Award winning musical The Sapphires. She is just 27 years old and delivers with immense love, tales told her by “the grannies that went before”. They are the tales of hard lives, injustice and the love and honour that, against all odds, hold a family together.\n\nLittle Birung is a beautiful little piece and a rare treat for audiences. Sensitively directed by Sean Mee, it is plain, simple storytelling at its best. The touching stories Megan tells are those of her family, told by the women, passed down through generations and now, for those lucky enough to catchLittle Birung during its brief season at the Judith Wright Centre, they can be heard and treasured by a much larger family.\n\nThe stories have been told to Megan by her 96-year old great grandmother (the oldest Ngadjon person living today), Flora Hoolihan (nee Illin), who lives by herself in Townsville and whose character we get an even greater sense of, when seeing her speak with Megan on screen. Flora muses, “Sharing the past isn’t easy sometimes…”\n\nWritten by Megan and John Rodgers, the music, ranging from pop to pub rock to blues to country helps (though the spoken word needs a little attention to get it flowing as comfortably as the songs). In its generally gentle shape and form, it is unmistakably John Rodgers stamped. Megan, with Musical Director, Jamie Clark, very naturally, confidently perform the work. These two have a wonderful connection on stage and bathed in glowing light from all directions (Lighting Design by George Meijer) on a simply set stage, they establish a distinct air of secrecy and special privilege. The stories are so personal and to share them with strangers is an enormous act of trust. Performing this show must be a bit like trying out a new acoustic set for the regular punters in a small town pub. But with better sound. Much, MUCH better sound (Sound Design by Brett Cheney).\n\nMegan’s great-great-great grandmother, Emily Russell, experienced first contact in the Atherton Tablelands. In 1955, at the age of 90, she was removed from her home with the cruel promise of a “holiday” and placed on Palm Island, where she died in her cell the same year. Most of us, including Megan as she sang the final lyric (and myself again now, even as I write this), were moved to tears…\n\nAnd I’ve outlived my daughters, though Kitty had a good man\n\nThat didn’t keep her from dying, a long, long way away from her land\n\nWhat about Lullie and Flora? Do they know I am on Palm?\n\nAre they waiting to save me? Waiting for the storm to calm?\n\nThe good man was a Russian, Leandra Illin, and due to his health, the couple moved off Kitty’s land and onto another’s. Struggling with her feelings of displacement, Megan sings for Kitty – in the style of the opening bars of Mama Who Bore Me (Spring Awakening) – Black Cockatoo (her mother’s totem). Kitty died in childbirth, having passed on the story so far, which we hear in the form of a sweet, catchy lullaby, Little Birung. Megan explains, “The title song,Little Birung, is about Granny Kitty singing to Granny Flora while she was in the womb. It’s a lullaby talking about all the struggles they had to go through.” My five year old heard me singing the refrain quietly in the house this morning and wanted it on repeat in the car. She was singing along with Megan by the time we got to school. It’s sad and bitter sweet and beautiful, perfectly encapsulating the mood of the show.\n\nOther highlights were He’s Alright (showcasing Megan’s vocal versatility and comedic ability), La Paloma (sung in Spanish, a tribute to Flora’s father), I Wish I Could Have Listened to Him (Megan’s mother, Dixie Samardin’s regret about never really knowing her Grandad Hoolihan, a political man) and Jenny Brown, in which we hear Margaret Gertz (nee Hoolihan) list the names of those who have passed, showing respect and keeping their stories alive.\n\nSo it’s not all sad. In fact, the culmination of these stories is a strangely uplifting summary song, The Mountain, which has so much hope and pride in it that most of us were moved to tears all over again!\n\nLittle Birung premiered in Cairns in 2010 as Blackbird as a co-production with JUTE Theatre. Renamed in honour of Flora (the original Birung), it really is a remarkable original work from a collective of artists who care deeply about sharing local stories with local communities. Remember, these are the guys who brought us, for the Queensland Biennial Festival of Music (under Lyndon Terracini), Bob Cat Dancing (Mt Isa 2003), in which Megan got her real start. Perhaps you didn’t know that? A massive community theatre event and a unique tribute to the Mt Isa’s mining industry, Bob Cat Dancingincorporated a trio of 3-tonne bobcat machines that spun, twirled and balanced with balletic precision, while a live band played country, pop, rock and gospel music. Wait a minute! Did Sean Mee, John Rodgers and Philip Dean create Australian Spectacle Theatre?! Maybe so! Anyway, I’m proud to have been involved in that production so I just wanted to let you know that it happened and that it led to other things happening too…\n\nSometimes people forget what has gone before. We are all connected to place and to our past – our personal and collective histories – and shame on any one of us who forgets it or ignores it or tries to cover it up and hide it away. Megan’s family’s stories are incredible (and they are incredibly important) and it’s clear that she has a lot more of her own story to tell. Megan is quite a talent and Little Birung, a perfect piece of theatre for all of us, for all sorts of reasons.\n\nDoctor Tulp is:\n\nArtistic Director: John Rodgers Creative Producer: Leah Cotterell Executive Producer: Seamus Mee Artist: Megan Samardin Production Manager: Gavin McDonald\n\nThis review published originally on briztix.com\n\nSongs For Nobodies\n\nDuet Entertainment\n\nBrisbane Powerhouse\n\n10th – 20th November 2011\n\nSongs For Nobodies is quite simply the most sophisticated night out at the theatre since Caroline Nin joined us, with Hymn a Piaf, during Twelve Acts of Cabaret. Bernadette Robinson raises the bar with her stunning impersonations of not only Edith Piaf but also Judy Garland, Patsy Cline, Billie Holiday and Maria Callas. While this feat alone is impressive in anyone’s books, she also brings to life, the personas and personal stories of five other women, the “nobodies” of the title, who each experience a chance encounter with one of the divas.\n\nI love how this show came about and it’s a model that we are seeing more and more often in Australian theatre and, more particularly, in Australian musical theatre (think of the variations that are Kris Stewart’s New Musicals Australia and recent festival commissioned works, such as The Little Green Road to Fairyland for Brisbane Festival 2011). In this case, Johanna Murray-Smith, commissioned by Melbourne Theatre Company’s Artistic Director (and director of this work), Simon Philips, wrote Songs For Nobodies to showcase Robinson’s extraordinary talent as actress and singer. The combined elements of the writing, the talent, the production values and a small, highly competent and sensitive band do just that. I would credit all those involved if it were not for the fact that, to my immense disappointment, no program was issued for this season of the production, an oversight that I hope will be remedied before any overseas engagements.\n\nRobinson’s portrayal of the divas is quite perfect, uncanny even. For all the recordings I’ve heard and for all the footage I’ve seen of these – five of our best loved female vocalists – I cannot fault Robinson. Her mimicry is spot on and the posturing and gesturing, dressed in a classic LBD and superbly cut jacket to suit all 10 characters, is as if she had engaged each artist’s coach to coach her, so precise is she in her study. Her wide ranging soprano is both exquisitely clear and hard-life-infused raspy where necessary; so much so that to close one’s eyes and listen, one might assume the women themselves are there with us. This applies to each singer; there is no weak character, and we see each at the peak of success, through the eyes of the “nobodies”, the ordinary women in menial jobs who each attract a chance meeting and a brush with fame.\n\nThere is Beatrice, a shy, unassuming washroom attendant, who offers to sew the hem of Judy Garland’s gown and divulges to the star, the sad story of the end of her relationship (a moving rendition of Happy Together). There is theatre usher, Pearl, invited by Patsy Cline to sing back-up vocals before Cline boards the plane that will later crash and kill her (Crazy). There is Edie, a librarian who explains one degree of separation between she and The Little Sparrow, Edith Piaf (my favourite – always – Non Je Ne Regrette Rien). A New York Times journalist, Too Junior Jones, makes Billie Holiday laugh and gets an interview, which gets her a promotion (Strange Fruit and Ain’t Nobody’s Business). Finally, there is Orla, a nanny aboard an Onassis cruise that also carries the opera darling, Maria Callas (Vissi d’arte). The connections between the ordinary women and the slightly more extraordinary women are tangible (a funny thing while there is just one artist on stage) and the transitions between each are absolutely seamless. I know I was one who gasped, upon first hearing the switch from shy, squeaky Beatrice to exuberant songbird, Judy Garland.\n\nSongs For Nobodies is exquisite musical theatre and despite moving slowly for some (Murray-Smith’s superb expositional writing and Phillip’s careful direction have allowed for pause, thought and nuance and there was some shuffling and fidgeting at times behind me), the uninitiated as much as the musical theatre lovers and players should see this show. Geoffrey Rush has described this show so eloquently that I shall quote him (thanks, Geoffrey): “Bernadette’s is a beautiful performance – that rare collision between actress and material that provides an astonishing showcase for her exquisite artistry…with charm and fragility, melancholy, sassiness and beguiling warmth – and that divine chameleon voice.” He’s right. It’s little wonder that Robinson receives a standing ovation wherever she goes.\n\nRobinson is too much an incredible performer to miss and whether or not you are a fan of any or all of the divas, you will fast become a fan of Bernadette Robinson. Songs For Nobodies deserves worldwide attention. And it will get it. You should see it before it leaves our shore.\n\nThis review published originally on briztix.com\n\nPygmalion\n\nQTC\n\nQPAC Playhouse\n\n7th – 27th November 2011\n\nWhat? No songs?! Admittedly, I was both excited AND disappointed to hear that Michael Gow would be directing George Bernard Shaw’s most popular play, based on the Greek myth, Pygmalion, for Queensland Theatre Company, rather than Lerner & Loewe’s beloved musical,My Fair Lady. I know. Shame on me for shying away from a classic! But I love the musical (the 1938 original non-musical film not so much) and I particularly love all that Audrey Hepburn brought to the role of Eliza Doolittle, the flower girl “guttersnipe” who is transformed during a period of “education” in the home of Henry Higgins, played in the 1964 film by Rex Harrison.\n\nThis Henry Higgins, the charming Robert Coleby, is less abrupt than Harrison and more mischievous, making his treatment of Eliza all the more disgraceful and thus, a whole lot funnier…because we all recognise his behaviour and the feelings associated with being treated abominably by an older, arrogant, condescending male authoritarian figure but it’s not us in those petite shoes, is it? Coleby brings to the role the abhorrent qualities of Shaw’s Higgins without making us hate him. The balance throughout of complex emotions – and his simple despair at the end – makes an appallingly behaved character rather endearing. At story’s end, we find that we are empathetic.\n\nOur story begins before the house lights dim and the scene is set, literally, by an actor sharing what must be the italics from the script (the setting and stage directions). It’s the 1950’s and despite the design and the famous line, “Not bloody likely!” being updated, it seems that neither good manners nor issues of class disparity have changed much since 1912. We are invited into the world of Eliza Doolittle on Drury Lane, which is a far cry from Higgins’ home in Wimpole St where she soon finds herself. The stage is slightly raked and a full scrim gives us some lovely well lit moments behind it and a complete map view of London out front, the setting for each scene highlighted by a travelling pin spot (Lighting Designer David Walters). On stage, settings are simply and elegantly conveyed and the set pieces glide magically on and off stage via a track system, without the bustle of stagehands (Designer Stephen Curtis).\n\nLeading lady, Melanie Zanetti (QTC Emerging Artist in 2010), embodies the flower seller Eliza and later in the piece, in undeniably “Audrey-esque” fashion, reveals another side to this complex character, in similarly stunning styling and superb gowns. Zanetti comes across just as she should – and I’m sure her finish will get stronger by the end of the run – a walking, talking doll, a temporary plaything and an amusing experiment for Higgins and Colonel Pickering (beautifully underplayed by Bryan Proberts).\n\nThe show skips and dances along (the repetition in the final scene barely noticeable), the laugh-out-loud moments too many to count and the audience easily able to commit fully to the story, largely because the actors resist an easy invitation to go OTT. Instead, refreshingly, they remain true to the humanity of the tale.\n\nChris Betts, as Eliza’s father, Alfred, is rough around the edges and a fish out of water but he cleans up nicely (I was waiting for him to break out into a jovial rendition of Get Me To the Church on Time). Kaye Stevenson is a politely intolerant Mrs Higgins. Carol Burns and Kerith Atkinson as the Eynsford Hill ladies are both adorable and repulsive in their upwardly aspiring manners and as Freddie Eynsford Hill, Christopher Sommers suitably pathetically, pines over Eliza. The hired help are hilarious: Penny Everingham’s Mrs Pearce and Andrea Moor’s Parlourmaid extracting gales of laughter and making some of us feel very grateful that we, er, choose to forego the luxury of being waited upon!\n\nGow has cast superbly, not only the main roles but also every character, letting them play, I suspect, considerably in the rehearsal room so that we can enjoy the quirks and nuances of each. The creative team and Dialect Coach, Melissa Agnew, are some of the best in their respective fields and this production benefits from their shared vision. If we’re honest, Gow’s 2011 season has been a bit hit and miss but Pygmalion is a triumph. You must see it.\n\nThis review published originally on briztix.com\n\nROCK OF AGES\n\nNew Theatricals\n\nQPAC Lyric Theatre\n\n12th November – 4th December\n\nZOMG! Brisvegas! Go see this show! Rock of Ages is awesome, feel-good entertainment and you’ll love it! Directed by Kristin Hanggi, it’s the best jukebox musical I’ve seen and it’s an exhilarating night out for everyone.\n\nYou know the story: small town girl meets boy in big city, waits some tables, meets rock star, loses boy, turns some tricks, finds boy and finds love. That’s how it goes, doesn’t it?\n\nAmy Lehpamer is the perfect blonde ingénue, Sherrie, in LA to be discovered. And she is; first by wannabe rockstar, Drew (Justin Burford) then by fading rockstar, Staycee Jaxx (Michael Falzon). Waiting tables at the infamous Bourbon Room, owned by Dennis (Anthony Harkin), she makes a choice that rocks her world and just as quickly, shatters it. Lured by “Mama” Justice (Rachel Dunham) and her sassy dancing girls to the Venus Club, Sherrie discovers that the Sunset Strip, which is under threat of redevelopment from Hertz (David Whitney) and his son, Franz (an hilarious Lincoln Hall in his professional debut), is not the dream she thought it would be.\n\nFrancine Cain, in her professional debut, plays the wily, hippy Regina (be sure to pronounce it correctly, please), who throws a spanner in the development works. Cain is also hilarious (she and Hall make quite a pair) and she has a voice on her. Dunham is well known for her powerful vocal work and she doesn’t disappoint. Falzon is every rock chick’s lust-worthy fantasy-turned-worst-nightmare and Burford, in his stage debut, sings his guts out, to the delight of a capacity crowd on opening night.\n\nBut it’s Lonny, “the sound guy” and Narrator, who steals the show. Dynamic Brent Hill, with tongue firmly in cheek, drives the action from the outset and could well be mistaken for funny-man, Jack Black, such are his comedic antics and style of delivery. He appears randomly, outside of his own story, to smash the fourth wall and to inject a brand of humour that is quirky, naughty and absolutely necessary in a show with a book about as thin as your favourite pair of slightly see-through (slightly age inappropriate) pink panties… the whole show, after all, is a wicked piss-take of the musical genre, everything eighties and all that is rock ‘n’ roll goodness and madness. I love it!\n\nThe set list is the best of the eighties and it makes for one helluva rockin’ show, with perfect rock concert sound (Peter Hylsenki), the bass vibrating through your chest and your chair, no doubt blowing the dust off the Lyric Theatre’s sound system. The songs would have you singing along; only the voices – all the voices – are so good that you won’t want to miss any of them. It’s your best eighties’ party playlist, with classics such as Just Like Living in Paradise, We Built this City, I want to Know What Love Is, Final Countdown, Hit Me With Your Best Shot and Don’t Stop Believin’ (and hey, Gleeks? Do I even need to say that this is the way these songs are supposed to be sung)?! The band, led by Musical Director, Dave Skelton, appear on stage as Arsenal, surviving within the context of the show, lineup changes and changing times. They’re talented guys, raw and ready for anything.\n\nJason Lyons’ lighting is in turns, suitably flashy and fabulous for the powerhouse numbers and more subtle for the corny, romantic moments. Set design (Beowulf Borit) is cleverly multi-functional, incorporating hidden spaces and terrific use of levels (we love stairs and balconies and scaffold). The AV adds a daggy drive-in movie feel to the action and helps move the very few plot points along (Projection Design Zak Borovay). Costumes, designed by Gregory Gale, are outrageously sexy and undeniably eighties. Yeah, you remember…\n\nMake no mistake about what this show is. It’s not masquerading as something deep and meaningful. It’s (probably) not going to change the world. It’s not going to change your life. But it will have you rockin’ out for its duration and all the way home! It’s entertainment! And it’s the most professional job we’ve seen from a professional company all year. They sing, they act, they sweat, they dance…and boy, do they dance (and boy, does one of them sing! Look out, Lehpamer)! Choreographer, Kelly Devine, has outdone herself, nailing the style and the…sentiment. The ensemble girls are pure sex, just as they should be, and quite frankly, it’s about time we saw this much sex on stage again, oozing from the pores and stiletto heels of women who are cast because they look, sing and move like a large percentage of the population believes they should…or did in the eighties, anyway. Yeah. That’s right. So sue me. And we welcome fair and honest comments in response to each review. Look, it’s simple. I love seeing talent on stage and these girls and boys are talented. In fact, they are so multi-talented that I’ve been thinking. Have the reality TV talent shows had to scrape the bottom of the barrel recently because our most talented performers are already working in our musical theatre industry? Is that it? I think so. These performers are fit, they’re hot and they can really dance (the girls’ kicks and the totes eighties take on the bend & snaps are awe-inspiring)! Their commitment, their energy, their generousity and their joy, every moment as they bust their guts to give us a stellar show, are second to none. Snaps to Lynne Ruthven Casting and the creatives on this one for staying with the integrity of the show and finally, for the Brisbane season, telling the story in the very best way it can be told.\n\nIf you don’t know what I’m talking about, perhaps you’ve never seen a show with a cast and a creative team of this calibre. Perhaps it’s time you did. Rock of Ages will infect you; inject itself into your soul like the happy cocktail of sex, drugs, love and rock ‘n’ roll that it is. And that’s the key to the success of this show. Rock of Ages is pure adrenalin, all energy, commitment and undeniably infectious fun. Don’t miss it! Take a crowd of friends, take your drinks in with you and wave that faux lighter like it was 1989!\n\nThis review published originally on briztix.com\n\nSweet Charity\n\nHarvest Rain\n\nPowerhouse Visy Theatre\n\nTim O’Connor has wanted to direct Sweet Charity “since forever”. The show, with Book by Neil Simon, Music by Cy Coleman and Lyrics by Dorothy Fields, is “timeless” and at the same time, slightly dated and kinda kitsch. Without being a fan of the show, you would undoubtedly recognise two or three of the showstoppers, largely because Shirley MacLaine made the role of Charity famous in the 1969 film, directed & choreographed byBob Fosse. In my humble opinion, this show – this story, despite its simple surface-level message of optimism – begs a more mature cast, however; this young, vibrant company concentrates on selling the shiny, happy-kitsch-cuteness and the positive message without so much of the deeper meaning. Well, that’s entertainment! And perhaps it’s just what we all need!\n\nThe simple design (O’Connor with Construction by Josh McIntosh) is surprisingly lacklustre – stairs and a NYC starburst of skyscrapers either side of the raised stage and a smattering of stars behind, painted onto a cloth backdrop, hiding the musicians from view (what a shame, when seeing the musicians at a Harvest Rain production is something we look forward to)! Even under Jason Glenwright’s lights, the colours of the set seem faded and the overall feeling is that of a forgotten idea about the world, and just a shadow of something wholesome. Perhaps this was the intent. I can imagine the design brief may have been “I’m gonna have me some faded dreams, some lost ambition and a whole lotta forgotten hope”. If this is the case, it fits the bill but it isn’t visually exciting.\n\nThe costumes (O’Connor) are much more colorful than the set and considerably more modest than you might have seen in other productions, or indeed, in the 2005 Broadway revival starring Christina Applegate or West End’s 2010 revival with Tamsin Outhwaite. (Or is it just that everybody on Broadway has legs and everybody in the West End has boobs?!) This cast is so young and so…dressed! This is not a surprise. They are the first and second year interns, who train daily in all aspects of musical theatre and are well and truly focused on the sweet and fun elements of the theatre industry (yes, all you cynics, there are those!) It seems to me to be, for this company, an odd show choice in a way, with its tale of the dance hall hostess who, time after time, gets the wrong guy and is more often than not treated somewhat appallingly by her “friends” at work as well as the men she encounters.\n\nAs my five year old commented, these are people who want to be happy and in order for them to be happy they need to “go and get the job that fits them because they can’t ever find a person to fit.” Incidentally, she loved the dancing too.\n\nAs the ridiculously geeky Oscar, Cameron Whitten’s elevator scene all but stole the show; his physicality, his energy and his commitment to the role was unmatched. While there were other terrrific performances (Tom Markiewiczas Vittorio Vidal and a couple of the more competent girls in their minor roles), Casey McCollow, as the sassy, cynical Nickie, was the other standout. With strong vocal work and a clear-cut character, she helped drive the Fandango Ballroom scenes and raised the bar in musical numbers such as Big Spender and There’s Gotta Be Something Better Than This. Disappointingly, for her voice is lovely and I would like to have heard more of it, Erika Naddei’s (Charity’s) vocals were, at times, lost under the volume of the band (Sound Designer Cameron Heit), which was all class, once again led by Maitlohn Drew. Though some may have missed it, Drew’s odd nod toBarnum – Jenny (The Nightingale) Lind’s song, Love Makes Such Fools of Us All– is nevertheless an apt addition to the score.\n\nIn all but the vocal harmonies (Vocal Director Sophie Mangan) and the choreography (Callum Mansfield), this production lacks attention to detail. The real precision is in Mansfield’s groovy choreography, which is suitably sixties-seventies stylised, Bob Fosse infused and each dance number in itself, a complete showpiece. It’s the best I’ve seen from Mansfield but unfortunately, the sometimes-careless execution means that his style and vision is entertaining without being fully realised. Inexperience also showed up a number of times in the mishandling of props.\n\nSweet Charity is a light, fluffy, fun show that hints at the darker side of life but doesn’t cross the tracks to go there. This Harvest Rain production, like its others, is engine room stuff, offering valuable performance experience and a certain degree of exposure to the next ambitious generation of Brisbane talent. Like Charity, the world of these performing artists is full of colour and possibility. Who are we to say that “out there” is anything BUT that?!\n\nThis review published originally on briztix.com\n\nOften I Find That I Am Naked\n\nCritical Stages and Jo & Co\n\nJudith Wright Centre of Contemporary Art\n\n27th – 29th October 2011\n\nJo Thomas is just gorgeous. If you hadn’t realised already, after seeing her in the show’s original season or after seeing her on the brochure, naked in a bath tub filled with brightly coloured candy, you would have seen it last night at the Judith Wright Centre. Tonight – the second night of a three night return season – marks the 100th performance of South AustralianFiona Sprott’s sexy comedy by this dynamic company; a well deserved milestone in terms of nationally touring, locally produced product. With the support of Critical Stages, Often I Find That I Am Naked, has been seen all over the country and it looks set to take on the overseas market next. And well it might but beware the language and cultural barriers! This is Sex and the City in your preferred Aussie city and the leading lady is Miranda, Charlotte, Samantha and Carrie, all rolled into one super sensitive, self-loathing, sexual predator. Or is that self-appointed victim?\n\nInspired by actual events in the playwright’s life, via Jo Thomas as Jezebel, Sam Clark as the many men in Jezebel’s life and James Dobinson as pianist, vocalist and conscience, Often I Find That I Am Naked tells the tragedy of women (and disastrous dates) everywhere. And let me make it clear: the men are not entirely to blame! Refreshingly, in this re-worked work, there are no taboos, nothing is sacred; it all rates a mention: drinking, shopping, dressing, dating, camping, dancing, fucking, sucking and spitting… WHAT?!\n\nBringing wry comedy and excellent musicianship to the stage and to the story, is Dobinson. He acts as a buffer and the rather bemused raised eyebrow of contemporary morality. Whatever that is. In Jezebel, Jo gives us every false hope, every rich fantasy and every fabulous, soul destroying mistake we have ever made in the dating market, largely because we just don’t know what it is we’re selling. Jezebel’s indecision and all her insecurities are our own…only we don’t DO that (that scene, those boys, those shoes or quite that much gin) anymore. Though some of us still dance around barefoot in our underwear to great bad eighties tracks with a homemade cocktail in hand. A-hem.\n\nThe boys she sees/has sex with are just one cliché after another and we can tell Clarke has fun playing them. He and Thomas have a wonderful, vibrant connection on stage; their energy is absolutely tangible and the sex scenes are hilarious…and a little bit tragic. Poor lovely, sexy, searching, hopeless Jezebel. The beauty sitting next to me was so engaged in the show and feeling so much for the character that I heard her on more than one occasion, in direct response to Jezebel’s actions, mutter her own dating advice… “DO IT, Jezebel!” and “No! DON’T DO IT, Jezebel!” That level of engagement is surely one of the markers of a great show!\n\nI love the lavish, single girl apartment set (Josh McIntosh) with its permanent fixtures, including a recessed wall of alcohol, its closet, chaise lounge and Dobinson and his baby grand. In addition to Dobinson’s musical arrangements, the footlights (the lighting design by Andrew Meadows) and the red velvet curtains allow this thoroughly entertaining play-with-music to sit stubbornly on the shelf alongside cabaret, in unashamed Bridget Jones “All byyy myyyself” style.\n\nIn all honesty though, I expected the boundaries to be pushed a little further. It’s clear that audiences have been enjoying the show as it is (it’s evolved since the original run) but with so much smutty SMS stuff about “hooking up” in the disabled dunny, as well as unconscious post-party sex/rape (don’t try that at home, kids) I think I thought there would be more nasty, dirty, kinky sex. Perhaps the drinking became the thing (with Ruben Guthrie down the road, our drinking habits seem to be the flavour of the month). Perhaps there was more of everything and like any wicked girl, this Jezebel isn’t telling us all! Director, Shane Anthony, has done an admirable job of bringing the shape of this piece together and keeping the show slick for the duration of the tour.\n\nIf you can’t relate to Jezebel’s experiences (if they never happened or you can’t remember them or like me, you’ve gone to great lengths to block them out), you’ll still enjoy this show. You’ll still get it. You’ll still LOL. It’s fabulously funny, terrifyingly familiar stuff that lets us have a laugh at just how awful our choices can turn out to be and what happens when, one day (or night), we finally become brave enough to choose differently.\n\nThis is your last chance to see Jezebel before she struts out of town and off around the world! Don’t miss a fabulous night out at the theatre!\n\nThis review published originally on briztix.com\n\nMind Games\n\nJo Loth\n\nMetro Arts\n\n15th – 22nd October 2011\n\nA cabaret about depression and bi-polar disorder? How does one DO that? Jo Loth has found a way and it’s a cracker of a cabaret show, performed at a cracking pace, with 60 minutes of poignant song and piss-take (every musical genre gets a guernsey) feeling like a 20 minute awards night opening number…with a very serious message.\n\nLoth is an accomplished performer, comfortable enough in her skin to show a lot of it and revealing throughout the evening, a lot more beneath it. Loth lays herself bare, literally, on the therapist’s couch, admitting to years of self doubt, depression and diagnosis without appropriate support. Her story is the same story as one in four Australians. One in four. Is it yours?\n\nLoth’s story (and the interwoven stories of the women with whom she has spoken about the subject) is multi-faceted and this woman sparkles, though not in a conventional glitzy cabaret way. She has Wade Gregory by her side and being the talented pianist, guitarist and vocalist that he is, Gregory has also done all the musical arrangements for the show. He brings additional warmth and a lovely, steady energy to it.\n\nLoth is a dishevelled, behind-the-scenes version of herself as well as multiple (considerably more flamboyant) characters. These are not to be confused with multiple personalities, which is another cabaret topic altogether! Her alter ego, Jolene Mindtrick, inspired by the cabaret archetype, Marlene Dietrich, is “both the ego and the embodiment of Jo’s dark side, instrumental in propelling the journey forward” (Director’s Note). As she struggles to free herself from the ‘straitjacket’ (a quick, terrifying nod to self-perception and the stigma attached to mental health in this country), strips away the blonde wig and the golden gown, and loses the stilettos and the stockings, Loth is raw and real, to the point that the audience feels completely comfortable chatting with her and chiming in on the chorus of a country & western song. There is no fourth wall. We are invited to join Loth on a roller coaster ride of emotions and so we take a deep breath and go; we are with her every step of the way, as she sings about her confusion, self-loathing and thoughts of self-harm and suicide.\n\nHer patter is well written, well rehearsed and comes across as casual conversation. Even so, the lighter moments almost come as a surprise. They are absolutely necessary – if we couldn’t laugh we’d cry – and they are superbly delivered, making Mind Games one of the funniest, grittiest shows I’ve seen. Not since Lucas Stibbard shared with us his story (it was not a love story, it was a story about love), have we, in turn, shared in the energy, vibrancy and commitment of somebody working this hard on a stage…and relishing every minute of it.\n\nThe self-assured hand of director, Sandro Collarelli, can be seen in Jo’s movement and just as much in her stillness, in her style, which is clearly her own and yet has a distinct Collarelli feel to it. This comes as no surprise, as the man himself is a rare cabaret champion and showed us as much, as the Emcee in Zen Zen Zo’s recent production of Cabaret. Just one question: with barely-there lighting (Mitch Chamberlain) and a low floor, at times we were obliged to stretch and lean and look around those heads in front in order to see Loth…could we not, again in this space, have raised the stage?\n\nThis is a show that deserves a bigger audience. And by bigger, I mean bigger on a national scale. It’s such a personal, honest show; funny, bittersweet and sad. But ultimately, it’s an uplifting, inspiring, entertaining story that desperately needed to be told and now it and Loth – a brave, bold, extraordinary performer and purveyor of truth – need to be heard.\n\nJo Loth’s Mind Games is testament to the life-changing power of theatre and the importance of discussion amongst us, about the tough topics. Let the media report on what it will, as long as the people are thinking and talking and reading and watching and subscribing widely. In short, if a story these days can go so far as to affect a life, then this show deserves your attention. Take a risk, see this show and look a little differently at life and at those around you who may struggle each and every single day to live it.\n\nThis review published originally on briztix.com\n\nSpring Awakening\n\nOscar Theatre Company\n\nQPAC Cremorne\n\n13th – 22nd October 2011\n\nOscar Theatre Company’s Artistic Director, Emily Gilhome, doesn’t care what the reviewers think of her Spring Awakening. She is all about connecting with audiences and giving her company a great experience during the process. On opening night, the quality of which she speaks is in reference to the experience rather than the production itself, which is impossible to achieve at any level without Gilhome’s other favourite ingredients for a successful show, integrity and humility.\n\nContained and almost careful, pushing boundaries without crossing lines, this is an impressive production that brings a little bit of Broadway to Brisbane. The vocal work is superb and, more than powerful, it’s saccharine sweet. We get the angels and the inner demons, not so much, though there is plenty of rock-god goodness, from the band, err, orchestra (err…why not have a rock band?!) and from Dash Kruck, who almost steals the show with his Greenday-like renditions of the tough Moritz songs. Well known for his comedic roles, Kruck reveals a different, darker side, whilst not missing the opportunities to go after a few giggles.\n\nI say that Kruck almost steals the show because this show actually belongs to Charles Sells. Call me biased, I care not. Charles calls the Sunshine Coast home and we found him in 2008 for a role in our production of Shout! The Legend of the Wild One, putting him on stage alongside seasoned professional performer, Dale Pengelly. We let him steal the penultimate scene even then. Sells has a beautiful voice, jazz baby good looks and a magical presence on stage. For such a young performer, he has a wealth of acting talent that needs nurturing and insightful direction. If Sells is not our next big thing then I don’t know who is! Siobhan Kranz is a lovely Wendla, all innocence and wonder, which along with the fear and misunderstanding of her mother (and the incompetence of a well-meaning, dodgy doctor), tragically brings about her demise.\n\nGilhome’s direction of the actors is, indeed, nurturing and insightful, allowing them their nuances and bringing out the best in this vibrant company. The boys (Sells, Kruck, Tom Oliver, Dan Venz, Justin Tamblyn and Dakota Striplin), by any disciplinarian’s standards, are a force to be reckoned with. There are a couple of incredibly strong performances here, including that ofTom Oliver’s as Georg and Dan Venz, as Hanschen. The girls (Kranz,Rachel Burke, May Green, Emma Taviani & Jessica Harm) underplay and remain contained until they seem to want to run and scream and explode – probably the perfect representation of their sex in the 19th century. The adults playing adults, Norman Doyle and Louise Brehmer, do well to further build on the horror that must have been that dark, depressing world of 1892. What Steven Sater (Book & Lyrics) and Duncan Sheik (Music) have done with this show is put Frank Wedekind’s shocking story on stage in its most authentic, angst-ridden form for contemporary audiences. You see, I love the original, ghastly play but it was not until seeing it and hearing it happen around the raw action that seems to come straight out of a drug-addled, curfew-breaking rock concert that everything fell into place. It’s a little bit like RENT, in terms of its structure and at times, this slowed the gear changes a little, though, for the general audience, did nothing to take away from the overall effect.\n\nAll the elements are there, though they are not often connected – a discreet sound design, a simple timber-slatted set, empty picture frames, wooden chairs, candles and blackboard walls covered in graffiti. And a big, bare tree, sketched in white chalk like a skeleton soul, on the back blackboard wall. The lighting design doesn’t always match up with the action and more often than not, the performers move in and out of the light. It’s different but it makes it difficult to see faces. Sloppy work from the audio tech is always damaging to a production and that it impacted the quality of this show by way of slow microphone cues was frustrating. Accents need greater attention in the future; they are a little disconnected and inconsistent.\n\nHaving said that, Emily Gilhome is doing what she’s set out to achieve, again blurring the lines between independent and professional theatre. She is connecting with audiences and she is giving our local talent the experience of their lives.\n\nThere is no doubt that Oscar Theatre Company is already one of our country’s best incubators for artists. Oscar provides performers with the same professional process and industry platform for which some of our elite arts institutions are charging a fortune. This is a company who needs our support. If we can keep them here, we will soon begin to see the talent leaving the bigger cities down south and moving north, to humble Brisvegas, for their first foray into the Performing Arts Industry here.\n\nThis review published originally on briztix.com\n\nRuben Guthrie\n\nLa Boite\n\nThe Roundhouse Theatre\n\n8th October – 13th November 2011\n\nRuben Guthrie. He had us at “Hello.”Brendan Cowell’s razor-sharp social commentary, marketed (superbly) by La Boite, was always going to be Gyton Grantley’s show. But is it? Despite the images that indicate a solo effort (we’ve seen Grantley – Guthrie – on coasters, on buses and online for months now), this is no one-man-show. This is a well-crafted, well-directed ensemble piece for some of Brisbane’s best actors with Gyton Grantley in the title role. With two newcomers thrown into the mix (Darren Sabadinaand Lauren Orrell), it’s a ruthless, unforgiving exposé on not only one man but on one man’s culture.\n\nAn Australian play about alcoholism you say? Look deeper. Listen harder. This play is not so much about alcoholism; it’s about our alcoholic country. Don’t get me wrong, Cowell has written an incredible account (a detailed study) on the behaviour of an alcoholic but there is a bigger picture, which Director, David Berthold, offers in this production.\n\nWe’ve normalised drinking and we’ve normalised drunken behaviour. Not only do we condone it, we tolerate it to excess, encourage it and celebrate it. We are a nation of drinkers. And that’s okay…isn’t it? It’s part of our identity! As posed by some of the people in Ruben Guthrie’s life, one drink is okay. And, as announced by Ruben himself, one blackout every now and then is a blessing!\n\nThe ensemble’s performances are generally strong and give a true sense of the family unit, an uneasy mix of love, support, judgment, criticism, intervention and more often than not, inconsistent messages! Caroline Kennison’sportrayal of Ruben’s mother (daughter of an alcoholic, wife of an alcoholic and mother of an alcoholic) challenges us on every level. During an incredibly uncomfortable scene, she forces Ruben, in the vain hope that he will learn to drink “rationally”, to take a sip of wine. Ruben spits it out as she turns and walks away (taking the bottle with her), back into the glass she has poured for him. As the father, John McNeill gives Ruben grief and gradually, subtly, starts to reveal complex, mixed emotions, the guilt and shame of an Australian bloke who has to suffer the company of an intolerably sober son.\n\nIt might be a brave move to have a go at AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) – the witty take on the constant meetings and the participants, the “feeling” language and the predictably awkward instructional style of communication between Ruben and his sponsor – but the program is not for everyone and it’s important that the text doesn’t cross that line into self-righteousness and preachy promotion. A sponsor with benefits, Virginia is as natural and up-front as I’ve seen Kathryn Marquet and she is well matched with Grantley.\n\nLauren Orrell is perfectly cast as Ruben’s fiancé, the petite size 6 (or is it size 4?) blonde Czechoslovakian supermodel, with Cate Blanchett cheekbones, easily legitimising any typecasting to come. Stronger in the second act, Orrell is one to keep an eye on.Hayden Spencer has long been one to keep our eyes on and he doesn’t disappoint, giving Grantley plenty to play with, as his boss (a reformed alcoholic), Ray. With incredible energy and comedy Spencer ensures he has the audience in the palm of his hand from the outset.\n\nRenee Mulder’s very simple yet effective set, of blue square floor atop blue square floor, with chairs and coffee tables flanking the sides, signified the boxing ring, the continuous battles with himself and those who care about him (or not) in every area of Ruben’s life every day – work, home, at a family barbeque, AA meetings – and becoming smaller, the void around him more expansive and the empty space itself serving to box him in as he plummets into alcoholic oblivion.\n\nJason Glenwright’s lighting is spot on, letting us into Ruben’s private “aloneness” and darkness before jolting us into the light of the sober day and back again into a cold, dark, dreamlike state. Guy Webster’s sound design works perfectly, underscoring events and adding a cold wind to set the mood – bizarrely – for a giant penguin to cross the space (Peter Brook, are you there? Homage to the deadly, holy, rough, immediate perhaps?)\n\nAct 1 seemed slightly static, even clunky but then, opening nights often are, and to make up for it, Act 2 set a cracking pace, not letting up until the moralistic conclusion made us wonder if we were the test audience for a feature film’s alternative ending. I felt there could have been an earlier ending, perhaps with the father’s exit (“I don’t know…”) or even earlier, at the blackout after Ruben’s apparent overdose. In short, the work itself is a little too long and a little overdone at the end. I found Gyton’s energy to wax and wane, though his commitment to the complex character was clear and the journey fully explored.\n\nThese are minor quibbles and I’m still reeling after sharing such a difficult journey with Ruben Guthrie. Anyone familiar with the mindset and typical behaviour of an alcoholic will recognise the telltale signs and symptoms of this disturbing disease and realise how little we know, as a society, about alcoholism and how to manage it. Integral to the success of the telling of this confronting tale is the strength that is required by one who drinks, in order to beat the demons once the decision has been made to get dry. One day at a time.\n\nRuben Guthrie is great entertainment with a strong moral message. It challenges us to examine – sans beer goggles – our “beautiful alcoholic country” and what it means to be a sober “boring” Australian.\n\nIt seems ironic that, in celebrating the opening of a fierce new Australian play about drinking, we all headed outside, in true Aussie deference to the threat of rain (and judgment), to listen to speeches and thanks with a drink in hand. Well, it would have been bloody un-Australian to refuse one…or two. Right?!\n\nThis review published originally on briztix.com\n\nRhinoceros in Love\n\nNational Theatre of China\n\nBrisbane Festival\n\nBrisbane Powerhouse\n\nOne of the festival favourites (and possibly the biggest buy in), with a large cast and an amazing set (designed by Zhang Wu), Rhinoceros in Love is like no play I’ve seen before. Brisbane Festival Artistic Director, Noel Stanton, was right to note: “This play will not only move audiences to the core but it will open the eyes of Brisbane audiences to modern Chinese theatre during the Year of Chinese Culture in Australia.”\n\nA poetic, dramatic script, laced with lovely comedy, well-timed songs (sung by vibrant young actors), water, paper, chairs and a conveyor belt bed made this a performance to remember.\n\nThe capacity Powerhouse audience came out chatting, impressed with the rain in the production and with the final message, to “pursue beauty.” I left the theatre feeling strangely abandoned and somewhat depressed. The layers and layers of the work spoke to me and as the company stepped (read splashed) forward for their curtain call, the members of the company were visibly moved. If there was ever any doubt about their passion or commitment to the tale, the tears on stage at the end smashed it.\n\nPerformed entirely in Mandarin, I was suddenly presented with surtitles again (there were none for Maria de Buenos Aires and none were needed). I found that I was obliged to look up and read them, rather than watch the performers for any length of time. This grieved me! I didn’t want to take my eyes off the actors! I felt sure I was missing their passion, their anguish, their dissatisfaction and high emotion, not to mention their cheeky facial expressions and a wink or two in the lighter moments. I tried so hard to ignore the surtitles but my eyes were drawn, time after time, to the text above the stage. I couldn’t connect with the actors, despite my best efforts.\n\nThe story they tell is one of youth and unrequited love. Quite simply, Ming Ming (Qi Xi), the ethereal object of the leading man’s affections, is so uninterested in Ma Lu (Zhang Nianhua) that in her efforts to dissuade him, she becomes cruel, completely destroying him. Strangely, maddeningly, he is undefeated. Playwright, Liao Yimei, notes, “The ending of the love story itself is not important.” The play is more about the power of belief and the pursuit of ideals and dreams.\n\nLook, it took me a little while to work out that Ma Lu and Ming Ming were neighbours. It strikes me that when you’ve got a boy, a girl and a wall between them; a stick of white chalk and the mind of one local Helpmann nominee best serve you. Is that just me?\n\nMing Ming is petite and so pretty, it seems she doesn’t deserve to suffer…but she does. She chooses to. As does Ma Lu, although it seemed to me that he walked nearer to madness. Perhaps it’s the same thing, his suffering a measure of his madness. An energetic ensemble, each actor creating their unique character, with quirks and comedic tics that are at times absurd, supports them well.\n\nAbstract devices – the songs, the “love tutorials” (classes in love making and breaking up) – added a touch of morality, wisdom and then wicked humour. At times these scenes were a little longer than necessary or ended so abruptly there was nothing leading into the following scene. Like dream sequences, this may well have been the intention.\n\nIn China, where the play was first performed in 1999, it has a cult following. It has been performed for the last 12 years – it’s a popular choice in the high schools – and Ma Lu (and his self-inflicted anguish), regardless of which fine, young actor is playing him, has quite a following; the youth particularly, very easily relate to him. As Ma Lu tells his friends:\n\nA rhino forgets the grassland.\n\nA water bird forgets the river.\n\nA man in hell forgets heaven.\n\nA leg amputee forgets a brisk walk.\n\nTo forget is what a normal person does.\n\nBut I’ve decided…not to forget.\n\nPerhaps we all decide not to forget sometimes.\n\nRadically different from the traditional Chinese theatre, Liao’s raw prose and Meng Jinghui’s bold direction have set a new benchmark for Chinese contemporary theatre. This cast, having now worked together for four years, delivers an intriguing, entertaining take on love, lust, life, our goals, our ideals, our dreams and power, which challenges us to take a look at ourselves and the things we most desire. “Society has changed, but the emotions in our heart are like a fire that never extinguishes…after all, we are all a rhinoceros in love.”\n\nThis review published originally on briztix.com\n\nSteampowered\n\nCircus Oz\n\nBrisbane Festival\n\nQPAC Playhouse\n\nCircus Oz is no ordinary circus. Come to think of it, there is no ordinary circus anymore! Circus has pulled up its stripy socks, picked up its act, stepped up to the plate and gotten its game on! When I think of circus I think of Cirque de Soleil (my sister is currently in China callingSaltimbanco), Circadia (at Woodford Folk Festival) and Circus Oz. Le Grand Cirque is yet another brand of popular circus and you can read Josh Matthews’ review of it here.\n\nSteampowered evolved over the last 12 months, collaboratively in the rehearsal room, “making it less like ‘direction’ and more like ‘curating’, ‘surfing’ or cooking’”, according to the company’s Artistic Director, Mike Finch. The theme (“a colour and a shape”) for the show, came out of the subversion associated with Steampunk, the imagined history of the Victorian era and it suits Circus Oz. A bold, original company, these performers have many skills between them and they deliver an excellent show.\n\nA slow, serious start to Steampowered was saved by a comedy duo that started on stage, sharing the space with a massive white dome, which was later removed to reveal the Steampunk style clad band. The dome glowed prettily, changing colour, while we watched safety checks and general pre-show circus busyness. Then, through the audience came Daphne and Fantaysia Fitness, warming up the punters of all ages, shaking vigorously their wrists, pulling suitably silly-serious faces in hilarious fashion. A new breed of clown/stand up comic, Daphne set the standard for the multi-talented, refreshingly funny characters. A juggling act, using four multi-talented members of the company, each of whom were able to step out from the act and into the band and back again, then on and off various other apparatus. And whilst the presence of spotters spoilt the risk element of the opening teeterboard act, they were clearly necessary. It’s a slick ensemble and they all look out for each other.\n\nI enjoyed the failed tricks of the magician (with Daphne “assisting”), the Boss Lady’s sassy singing and emceeing, the tumbling, frantic chaotic chase (slow motion under strobe lighting for good comic effect), as the Boss Lady attempted to reclaim her hat and Daphne’s running gag/love interest, proffering flowers to a guy in the front row at every opportunity. In fact, I’m determined to serve Christmas dinner a la Daphne, presenting each dish with a little run, a big flourish and a triumphant “Ta-da!”\n\nMy five year old was suitably impressed by a fun bicycle cum unicycle act, the bike breaking into several pieces and being reassembled by the rider…whilst riding it! And we were both in awe of three performers – 2 guys and a girl – sharing a pole, in an act of strength, focus and split second ensemble timing that put to shame some of the pole-dancing masquerading as burlesque I’ve seen recently. Seriously. If you want to see a good pole act, see Circus Oz. It’s fun, sexy and seriously impressive!\n\nThe moving, mechanical set of steam powered machines (Darryl Cordell) and the red & brown Steampunk costumes (by Laurel Frank, in a nod to Sergeant Pepper), aided by interesting lighting states throughout (Marko Respondeck), added to the original yet sentimental feel of this production. After seeing so many bright primary colours on circus performers for years, there is something strangely comforting about the iconic rusty colours and industrial themes reinvented to fit such brave, visionary artists. Circus is, after all, about imagination and reinvention.\n\nUnfortunately I’m able to tell you about the first act only because, due to a delay during interval (apparently, it was an orchestra pit issue, inconveniencing the first three rows of the audience, who were asked to wait to be directed to their seats), the five year old and I had to leave before Act 2. Ordinarily, I would have been happy, as were most of the punters, to wait until the safety issue had been properly assessed and fixed but I had a trip back to the Sunshine Coast to do, before returning (again) to Brisbane for a second show that night. I know. The traffic! Crazy. I like to live on the edge. I’m sure Poppy would have been happy to continue to dance and perform her original tricks in the aisle, however it was not to be. By the way, theSteampowered soundtrack, available for purchase, is excellent. But enough about us. Life and the show must go on.\n\nIf you do get the chance to see a Circus Oz show in another venue, another time, I urge you to go and let off some steam! In the meantime, you’ll find them online. Visit circusoz.com/onlinecommunities\n\nThis is a modern, multi-talented troupe with unending energy, humour and a high level of skill, presenting original and thoroughly entertaining circus for all ages.\n\nThis review published originally on briztix.com\n\nNo Man’s Land\n\nQTC & STC\n\nBille Brown Studio\n\n19th September – 22nd October\n\nQTC’s final studio show for 2011 is Harold Pinter’s No Man’s Land and it is all about, as Michael Billington suggested in his critique of the original 1975 production, “precisely what its title suggests.”\n\nDirected by QTC’s previous Artistic Director, Michael Gow, No Man’s Land is unabashed, unashamed, plain and simple delivery of a complicated text, which is certainly Pinter at his best (and by best I mean most challenging, in a truly mind altering way).\n\nDesigner, Robert Kemp has set this strange story simply, in a vast room, appropriately well appointed and eccentric, with its imposing wall of books (with its odd assortment of bookend lamps, their leads exposed…but why? What did they signify? I could write an additional 600 words but I won’t bore you with my interpretive analysis), the lighting states (Nick Schlieper) created a suitable glow by lamplight at night and brighter white by the morning (loved the daylight, hated the window, or rather, that wall which lay beyond the window…oops). A barely audible soundscape (Tony Brumpton) and echo effects were suitably eerie.\n\nThere is always some debate about just what percentage of directing is in the casting. In this production, I say there’s approximately 93% of the directing in the casting. This is an incredible cast.\n\nWe are led to believe that the very wealthy, elderly Hirst (John Gaden) meets the vagabond conman, Spooner (Peter Carroll), in a pub in Hampstead and upon returning to Hirst’s house, the two new companions (for want of a better word) drink copious amounts of top shelf stuff and attempt to converse over the little they appear to have in common. After that, we are not sure what to believe. Two younger men, Foster (Steven Rooke, looking very much like Brad Pitt’s biggest fan) and Briggs (a buff Andrew Buchanan) join the older gentlemen in the room. They seem to have a relationship, they seem to have some authority over Hirst and certainly, more information than we do. So just who is in the room and what is actually being said? Are the ensuing events real or imagined?\n\nTo be honest, it took me a while to warm to Gaden. His drunken acting was overplayed, too deliberate yet unfocused and I found the crawling out of the room, or more particularly, the dramatic falling about that preceded it, unnecessary. He gets drunk, collapses and has to crawl from the room, yes? Then give us just that. I warmed to him later, as he settled into his character. Steven Rooke on the other hand, has an incredible, ticking, time bomb presence the second he appears on stage and it’s always exciting to see him, to feel him, in the space. We’re never quite sure what to expect from him. He is the epitome of antici…………pation, not to mention Brisbane’s best new white-suited, white-shoed, waxed, gay pin up boy. Peter Carroll and Steven Rooke together in this production"
