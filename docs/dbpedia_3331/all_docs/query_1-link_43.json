        "text": "Ten-Minute Plays\n\nWith the rise of popularity for these action-packed skits, we’re certain you’ve heard of ten-minute plays–but what are they exactly?\n\nWe wanted to share our knowledge on ten-minute plays. We even share some of our very own ten-minute playscripts.\n\nLet’s begin, shall we?\n\nWhat is a Ten-Minute Play?\n\nYou might be wondering, what is a ten-minute play?\n\nA ten-minute play is a fairly new form of play that showcases the fast-paced development of characters and plot. Sometimes ten-minute plays are excerpts from longer scripts, but more often than not, they are original skits.\n\nThe concept of Ten Minute Play was developed by the UK’s National Theater in order to encourage new audiences to watch theater productions. This meant that plays were staged at short intervals, usually every ten minutes, rather than once or twice a week.\n\nThis format has become very popular in recent years, especially in the US. In fact, some theaters even offer tickets specifically for these shorter shows.\n\nWhy Do We Love Ten-Minute Plays?\n\nFirst, they are incredibly fun! They allow you to get into character quickly, which can sometimes lead to spontaneous performances. If you have ever seen an improv show, this is similar to that.\n\nSecond, they are extremely easy to stage. All you need is a couple of chairs, a microphone, and maybe a prop or two.\n\nThird, you don't need any special equipment for them. Most ten-minute plays don't require lights or sound effects, making them affordable options for most groups.\n\nFinally, they can be used to teach different skills like improvisation, acting, storytelling, and directing.\n\nHow Do You Write a Ten-Minute Play?\n\nWhen writing a ten-minute play, or really any script, the biggest obstacle is the idea.\n\nThe main goal is to have a large amount of development in a short amount of time–most likely meaning there will be a lot more dialogue than actual movement.\n\nCheck out this video series to help give you all the tips and tricks you need to write an action-packed playscript!\n\nExamples of Ten-Minute Plays\n\nThe Type Writer\n\nThis play consists of 2 characters–one male and one female.
