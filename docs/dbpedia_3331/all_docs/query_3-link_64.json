        "text": "True to my nature I wanted to clear up some of the confusion that I have noticed surfacing in the literary world. It’s a bit simple may be even trivial but I feel its necessary. Many writers, reviewers and readers of both Urban Fiction and Urban Fantasy are becoming confused. They are two different genres but are frequently appearing in similar circles. I review books of both genres because a good book is a good book however, I primarily focus on urban fiction.\n\nSimilarities Between Urban Fiction & Urban Fantasy\n\nLike the name suggests urban fiction and urban fantasy both are written in an urban setting. The tales are spun using a city or underground setting. It doesn’t have to be in a ‘ghetto’ or slum background but usually within the inner city where crime, violence or drugs are prominent features in the environment. For the story to be considered ‘urban’ this must be expressed throughout the story or in the beginning of the tale.\n\nDifferences Between Urban Fiction & Urban Fantasy\n\nThe major difference between the two starts at where the story leads. Urban Fiction usually leads its readers through a sticky web of deceit, affairs and over the top drama. While urban fantasy leads its readers through an urban setting toward a supernatural experience. That may mean vampires/werewolves/superheroes/other galaxies and such. Another difference includes is the language used throughout the story. Urban fiction uses lots of slang or ‘street talk’ as well as over the top profanity while urban fantasy can be a bit more toned down.\n\nBook Submissions\n\nKnowing the correct genre will help you reach your target audience more effectively. Granted you may reach a reader who is into one genre and have them cross over after reading your work but it’s not the norm. Urban Fantasy is on the rise due to such series as Harry Potter and the Twilight series. Urban Fiction is also on the rise from such authors as Zane and Wahida Clark. No the difference so you submit your work to the appropriate publishing companies, reviewers and book clubs. That can make or break the success of your book\n\nIf you enjoyed the post please like"
