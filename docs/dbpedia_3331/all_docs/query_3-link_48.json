        "text": "Nobody Knew She Was There…\n\nI’m delighted to welcome author and editor Jan Edwards this week to the Guest Blog.\n\nI am Jan Edwards and I write Fantasy fiction.\n\nIt is true that I have published two mainstream fiction novels and ghostwritten non-fiction, and my latest novel will be firmly fixed in the crime sector, but when it comes to the short story I am Fantasy all the way. And by Fantasy (capital F) I do mean in its broadest sense. Within the big F I have strayed into most of the various sub-categories over the years: crime, Cthulhu mythos; fairy tales; folklore; horror; myths and legends; paranormal/supernatural; science fiction; Sherlock Holmes; steampunk; swords and sorcery; urban fantasy…\n\nTo date more than forty of my short stories have made it into print. Many of the supernatural stories are collected together in Leinster Gardens and Other Subtleties, and a further fourteen collected tales (plus a little poetry) are about to hit the bookshelves as Fables and Fabrications. Yes, I do also write Fantasy novels, and hope to get an urban fantasy series out with a small press quite soon! I have also worn another cap editing anthologies for Alchemy Press and Fox Spirit Books.\n\nSo … I am Jan Edwards and I write Fantasy fiction. Put that way it sounds like some literary confessional, and in some ways it can feel like that when you go to a writing or literary event.\n\nWay back in the mists of the late 1980s I attended a writing weekend at Southampton Uni (the event later became Winchester Writers’ Conference) and had booked for the novel writing workshop. The novel writing workshop was heavily oversubscribed and some forty writers had gathered for the morning’s work.\n\nThe author leading it – a self-confessed literary author – quite logically began the session by dividing us into ‘genres’.\n\nI, he declared, will take the literary writers. Will the historic go to the right hand corner and the romantic and womens’ fiction writers the left. Now – what do we have left?\n\nThe remainder of the herd huddled in the centre of the room mumbled replies of fantasy/crime/horror/sf.\n\nOh, he sneered. The weirdos. Caroline (points at well-known fiction editor) you know about those sort of things. You deal with them. Amazingly he did survive, and the Weirdo’s Workshop was born, and went on as a functional writing group across three counties for almost ten years afterwards. In fact I will be attending Bristol Crimefest with one of that group, crime writer Debbie Bennett, in May this year.\n\nIt would be good to think that such snobbery has changed since that time. Sadly it has not to any great extent. It is something that perhaps we are so used to hearing from the high-flown towers of heritage publishing houses that we barely notice it. Science fiction is rebranded as futuristic, Fantasy becomes magic realism. Horror so often lurks beneath the euphemisms of supernatural thriller or dark/gritty crime.\n\nThe mainstream find it hard to own up to a sneaking regard for our fantastical tales and seek to justify their interest with cute tags. But the hardening of lines between our beleaguered ranks is something I find a lot harder to understand. I have heard horror buffs are heard to refer to traditional fantasy as ‘pixie-shit’ and fantasy authors referring to the horror crowd as ‘satanists’ (in the derogatory sense). I have heard paranormal romance being derided by some on both sides as ‘beastie-porn’.\n\nWe are all writing Fantasy, with than all-important capital F and we should (IMHO) be reading with more catholic (small c) tastes. This cutting and dicing of Fantasy into increasingly blinkered back alleys does us all a disservice. Especially for those of us who relish the freedom of writing the story that wants to be written and not those we are expected to write.\n\nWhich brings me neatly round to that tricky question of selling fiction.\n\nWe writers are always being told that to gain our market share we should carve ourselves a niche in our particular field. My own work crosses a lot of genre boundaries which I personally prefer. I prefer to write across the board with whatever takes my fancy, but in doing so I am aware that I could be shooting myself in the marketing foot. In the past few months I have had four short stories published:\n\n‘Jamesian Conundrum’, The Mammoth Book of the Adventures of Moriarty (Sherlock Holmes).\n\n‘The Decks Below’, Terror Tales of the Ocean (steampunk/folklore/horror).\n\n‘Bone Wary’, Tales From The Lake: vol 2 (horror).\n\n‘Shaman Red’.Winter Tales, Fox Spirit Books (folktale /urban fantasy).\n\nIt has never mattered to me what particular sub-folder I will find a writer in because we are all writing to that sense of wonder beyond the mundane and the everyday. That capital F says it all.\n\nBut we are told it matters to the publicists and commissioners of fiction because they need to target their audience. Writing well enough for publication is tough enough without having to consider marketing before you even set down a single word.\n\nThen you add the male-female issue into that maelstrom and it can and does become quite toxic. There have been several ‘kerfuffles’ in the fantasy community in recent years over gender parity (or not) in the publishing field. In theory gender should not matter, only the quality of the prose, yet this is a banner that appears to both divide and unite in very public and highly acrimonious debates.\n\nIn the anthologies edited by myself and Jenny Barber for both Alchemy Press and Fox Spirit Books we chose on quality of writing and were fortunate never to have needed to consider gender parity because the male to female divide was always around the 50/50 mark; give or take.\n\nHaving waved the gender equality laws in earnest in my daytime career back in the 1980s, it is never far from my mind and I can understand why this is an issue. And, having worked in bookselling for many years, I know how the perceptions of gender can influence some readers.\n\nThese perceptions are wrong at any level but they are changing, albeit at glacial speed. This change is not helped when lists of the ‘best’ genre film/book or ‘most influential’ or ‘top ten’ genre authors are issued and, time after time, fail to include more than a token number of female writers; or on some occasions none at all. The list makers are invariably men who, it must be said in the name of fairness, are giving their personal opinion based on their own reading habits. But there can be no doubt that the perception that male authors will always rise as the cream of the genre pinta thrives on the existence of these very personal polls.\n\nAcademe has had similar bias when the literary canon has traditionally listed an all-male casting. There have been more women included since the 1960s, but the debate still rages over what the canon should represent and how far back into antiquity should it stretch. Shakespeare compared with Aphra Benn? Or Homer to Sappho?\n\nBalancing the gender equality has been a long fight across centuries.\n\nThe genre war is possibly a far more recent development and not something I have looked into in depth, perhaps a subject for another time. I began this blog by mentioning the thorny subject of marketing, outlining some of the problems I can see in how to promote a varied output in the current market, and will be the first to admit I have no real answers. But I shall leave you with this final thought.\n\nShakespeare, the Bard, wrote many a Fantasy. The celebrated children’s author E. Nesbit was a writer of dark and gruesome short fiction and one of my favourite authors of all time, Daphne du Maurier, wrote both the historical staple Jamaica Inn and horror classic The Birds.\n\nWrite what makes you happy and write it well, and it will find a market.\n\nJan Edwards lives in Staffordshire with her husband Peter Coleborn and the obligatory three cats – between the Peaks National Park and the Potteries district. She has a life-long passion for folklore and the supernatural and draws on this for her fiction. She has had numerous stories published in anthologies such as the Mammoth Book of Dracula, Mammoth Book of the Adventures of Moriarty and Terror Tales of the Ocean. Some of her published short stories are reprinted in her collections Leinster Gardens and Other Subtleties and Fables and Fabrications. Jan won a Winchester Slim Volume prize and was short-listed for a BFS Award for Best Short Story. She also edits anthologies for the award winning Alchemy Press and also for Fox Spirit Books. In a previous existence she was a Chairperson for the British Fantasy Society. Other titles by Jan Edwards: Sussex Tales and Winter Downs (Penkhull Press – expected 2016)"
