Gunderson is known for her focus on strong, intellectual women with a particular affinity for historical drama and women in the sciences; her works include Ada and the Engine, following a young girl inspired by the first mechanical computer at the time of the Industrial Revolution, and Emilie, based on the life of Emilie du ChÃ¢telet, a scientist, mathematician, and a lover of Voltaire. 8\n\nP:11\n\nPeter Pan and Wendy has demanded a herculean effort from a larger-than-usual squad. While an average artistic team numbers around 20, from designers to animal trainers, animators to musicians, more than 65 people have contributed to the stage magicâand thatâs not even including STC staff and crew at the costume, prop, and scenes shops, or the actors! From Disney animation, to Mary Martin singing âIâve Gotta Crow,â to Kate Winslet and Johnny Depp in Finding Neverland, the story of Peter Pan casts a spell on generation after generation. Whatâs your favorite version? What makes it special to you? Nana, the Darlingsâ intrepid canine nanny, is played by Bailey, a Very Good Boy. Baileyâs last role was as an understudy for Because of Winn Dixie. In the play, Winn Dixie gets lost in a thunderstorm, so Bailey learned how to run on a treadmill with lights and projections flashing around him. 9\n\nP:12\n\nFROM THE PLAYWRIGHT In re-imagining Peter Pan and depravity, and violently tyrannical Wendy for this moment in time, power.

Whenever the 13 crocodile tries to sneak up on Hook, he hears the ticking, and is able to flee. Captain Hook is not afraid of the crocodile itselfâheâs afraid of the clock winding down, and what will happen when the crocodile can sneak up on him in silence. For Hook, mortality is around every corner. On the opposite end of the spectrum is Peter Pan, who also wants to stop time. Peter tries to resist growing up, and this comes at a great cost to him. In the end, this is a story of generational change, a movement away from the mistakes of the past. We hope itâs a chance for kids and adults to see the capacity of young people to come together and lead us to better things. Embarking on theatre for families is new ground for Shakespeare Theatre Company, and our goal has been to make something with universal appeal, created with seriousness and artistry. I think Peter Pan and Wendy is the perfect classic for the job. âAlan Paul\n\nP:16\n\nThe Thief of Time By Drew Lichtenberg, Dramaturg and Katherine Blauvelt, Artistic Fellow Photo of J.M.

NEW YORK: Broadway: Sister Act 34\n\nP:37\n\n35\n\nP:38\n\nFrom Wags to Riches: A Doggo Star Is Born By Christine Covino, Marketing and Communications Coordinator Peter Pan and Wendy reimagines the story of Peter Pan in many waysâeven the Darlingsâ beloved nanny, Nana. Instead of an actor in a dog costume, Peter Pan and Wendy features a real dog star, who has performed on hundreds of stages across the country. Theatrical Animal Trainer Bill Berloni, the only animal trainer honored with a Tony Award, and dog handler Tyler Garstka spoke to us about their trade and about Bailey, the furry actor who is sure to steal many hearts. Christine Covino: How did the way, trying to raise awareness you become a theatrical about homeless animals. animal trainer?

Finding Neverland Discover the inspiration behind Peter Pan by delving into author J.M. Barrieâs life. This Academy Award-winning film stars Johnny Depp as the quirky, introverted J.M. Barrie alongside Kate Winslet as Sylvia Llewelyn Davies and Freddie Highmore as Peter Llewelyn Davies, who served as inspiration for the iconic character of Peter Pan. 40\n\nP:43\n\nMoonrise Kingdom With a lighthearted spirit and colorful aesthetic, Wes Andersonâs Moonrise Kingdom is a unique coming-of-age story for all generations. Featuring a cast of idiosyncratic children, this movie follows Sam and Suzy, two social outcasts who fall in love and elope in order to find their own space on the tiny island they call home. Edward Norton leads the cast as an adorably awkward scoutmaster, alongside the jaded lawyer Bill Murray and the eccentric social services worker Tilda Swinton. Once Upon a Time Ever wonder what would happen if all your favorite fairy tale characters crossed paths? ABCâs top-rated drama Once Upon a Time puts a fresh spin on classic stories, weaving imaginative storylines where Captain Hook can convene with Snow Whiteâs Evil Queen, and Peter Pan may not be as innocent as you think. A Wrinkle in Time Madeleine LâEngleâs classic novel promises exciting adventure across whimsical universes as thirteen-year-old Meg and her siblings attempt to find their missing father and save the universe from an evil force. While the fantasy is sure to entertain all readers, this book is especially great for young girls, as it features a curious and bold female protagonist, who has been credited with paving the way for other iconic characters such as Harry Potterâs Hermione Granger and even The Hunger Gamesâ Katniss Everdeen. Tiger Lily In this reimagining of Peter Pan, New York Times best-selling author Jodi Lynn Anderson follows the character of Tiger Lily as she navigates the dangerous landscape of Neverland, as well as an alluring yet treacherous relationship with Peter Pan himself. Andersonâs moving novel has also been chosen for STCâs Book Club, and all are welcome to join in our discussion on Tuesday, January 7.
