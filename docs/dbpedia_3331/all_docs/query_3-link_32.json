        "text": "Category: Urban Fantasy\n\nSelf-published Authors Appreciation Week Book Spotlight: Werecats Emergent by Mark J. Engels\n\nAs Self-published Authors Appreciation Week continues, I’m happy to shine a spotlight on Werecats Emergent by Mark J. Engels. This is urban fantasy with a twist, and you can find an excellent review for the book on Gina Rae Mitchell’s blog.\n\nBook Blurb:\n\nAfflicted, exploited, and deadly…\n\nTeenaged Pawly discovers her secret werecat heritage after unexpectedly morphing one Halloween night. Desperate to find an outlet for her and her twin brother’s growing bloodlust before they go feral, Pawly’s blended human-werecat family begs a Chicago-area drug cartel for help. Her uncle Ritzi, meanwhile, scrambles to develop an alternate way the twins might satisfy their lethal urges. Resuming his deported father’s scientific research, Ritzi draws notice from an elder werecat representing a rogue state keen on the twins’ potential. When a cartel enforcer is found savagely mauled following the twins’ first job, Ritzi insists Pawly and her brother enlist in the rogue state’s service to ensure their safety. But their father, a Navy sailor critically wounded in recent combat, would rather die than risk being separated from his children again–which Pawly soon realizes is no idle threat.\n\nTo Purchase:\n\nAmazon\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nBoyhood interests in trains and electronics fostered my career as an electrical engineer, designing and commissioning signal and communications systems for railroads and rail transit agencies across the United States. Authoring rail industry trade magazines articles led me to write novel-length fiction, inspired by my beloved anime, manga and anthropomorphic fandoms. Growing up in Michigan never far from the Great Lakes, my wife, son and I live in Wisconsin with a dog who naps beside me as I write.\n\n​\n\nI am a member of Allied Authors of Wisconsin, one of the state’s oldest writing collectives, and the Furry Writer’s Guild, dedicated to supporting, informing, elevating, and promoting quality anthropomorphic fiction and its creators.\n\nAuthor site\n\nBook Review: The Unchosen by Laura Huie\n\nThank you to the author for providing me with this book in exchange for my honest opinion. The Unchosen is available now.\n\nI loved, loved, loved The Sunset Sovereign, a hopeful sort of fantasy (with a dragon!), so of course I was excited to see what The Unchosen had in store for me. Let’s just say that Laura Huie has solidified herself as an author who can write pretty much anything.\n\nThe two books were so different, not just in contend or subgenre, but in feel. Both deftly written, they are nonetheless as different as night and day. While The Sunset Sovereign was more of a quiet, character-driven tale, The Unchosen was full of magic and fantastic worldbuilding. They do have something in common, though: their ability to completely draw me in to stories both creative and unique\n\nPortal fantasies often have either a main character finding their way to somewhere Else from earth, or a main character finding themselves on Earth. But what if you could have the best of both worlds?\n\nFia was found unconsciousness by a policy officer, with no memory of her identity, aside from her name. While trying to make a life for herself, Fia and her newfound friend, Karen, also hope to help Fia recover her memories. Little does she know that her life is somewhat more unusual than most. She accidentally makes a hiddenway (what portals are called in the book) to Thedre, where it turns out she’s actually from. Not only that, but danger lurks at every turn.\n\nFia was wonderful! She’s clever and resourceful and doesn’t let a little think like not remembering her past make her the host of a pity party. She’s definitely not perfect, but she’s something much better: she’s interesting. Oh yes, and she isn’t completely head-over-heels swoony, which is always nice (I have the romantic sensibilities of a rock when it comes to books). I love reading a book in which romance isn’t a huge driving force.\n\nThis is a faster-paced book, although never at the cost of detail or plot and certainly not at the cost of world development. I thought everything about Thedre was fascinating in that sort of magical way that first drew me to fantasy many years ago.\n\nThis is my second book by Laura Huie and I now consider myself a fan of the author. More from her, please!\n\n2024’s Big, Long List of Super Self-published Books\n\nIt’s one of my favorite times of the year: Self-Published Authors Appreciation Week! This week exists to shine the spotlight on some great self-published books. And let me tell you: there are a ton!\n\nIf you’d like to give a self-published book a try and are looking for suggestions: I’ve got ’em! This is not by any means an exhaustive list. There are many, many great self-published books that I haven’t read yet, or that I’ve neglected to mention. Check some of these out! And readers, let me know what I need to add to my “to be read” pile.\n\nAdjacent Monsters by Luke Tarzian\n\nAlexis vs the Afterlife by Marcus Alexander Hart\n\nAmong Thorns and Stardust by Marie Sinadjan, et. al.,\n\nArvia: Heart of the Sky by DH Willison\n\nThe Audacity by Carmen Loup\n\nAwenydd and Conversation with a Country Boy by J.R.

From a knife that kills on its own, to a daring acorn theft, each story is a reminder of how unique the fantasy genre is.\n\nThis collection is so much fun! I’ve kind of fallen in love with the mashup of mystery and fantasy anyway, and these stories made me smile, shudder, and wonder. Like all anthologies, there were some tales that I liked more than others, although there wasn’t a bad story in the bunch.\n\nIt started with “Birthright”, which was probably the most traditionally mystery-feeling story in the book. Because of that, I knew right away “who dunnit”, but it was the how that mattered, and that was a fun adventure. It was also a great way of introducing the reader to what became a steadily less traditional group of mysteries.\n\nNext came “The Affairs of Wizards” by Michael H. Payne, which is a strong candidate for favorite story. There’s something delightful about a P.I. taking a case for a talking squirrel. Especially when the “My case and your case are the same f—ing case” moment involves ifrits and magical items. Basically, the whole thing features fabulous twist after fabulous twist as well as an utterly adorable client.\n\nI really enjoyed “The Mystery of the Angry Knife” by Rob Edwards. I must admit, I did not see the final reveal coming at all. It was a perfect meshing of mystery and fantasy elements and the story moved along seamlessly. I expected nothing less from the author of the Justice Academy books.\n\n“A Murder on Canvas” stood out for the disturbing nature of the crimes. Well written and ick!, ick!, ew! I was definitely invested and hoping that the murderer would be caught. This one had the added benefit of having a connection to The Tempest Blades, a hopepunk series that I love.\n\n“An Elementary Twist” by Brent A. Harris featured a reluctant team-up between Sherlock Holmes and…Oliver Twist? Yup. Oh, and a device that manipulates time. It was different and loads of fun, with the unlikely pairing paying off in dividends.\n\nTales of Mystery: Dead for a Spell was a fantastic collection; one I plan on rereading soon. This is also the last book from Inklings Press, which honestly makes me a little sad. Each contributor is massively talented, and many are writing their own books separate from the tales they’ve shared with these collections. I’ve enjoyed books written by several of these authors and will seek out others that I haven’t read yet. Inklings Press is going out on a triumphant note, and I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good mystery with a dash of fantasy. Best of luck to each author!\n\nBitter Waters (Dr. Greta Helsing #3.5 by Vivian Shaw\n\nThank you to Orbit Books for providing me with this book in exchange for my honest opinion. Bitter Waters will be available on June 25th.\n\nI’ve greatly enjoyed the other Dr. Greta Helsing books, so of course I was excited to jump back into the fun (and, yes, charming) world of Dr. Greta Helsing. Bitter Waters is a fun aside in an entertaining series.\n\nGreta is a doctor of the most unusual variety: she caters to the supernatural. However, in this installment she’s left her practice behind to go visit the country on a much-needed break. Her job follows her, though, when a barrow-wight brings an unconscious soon-to-be vampire girl to her door. I need to pause right there to point out one of the smaller additions to this series that I love so much: the supernatural creatures don’t start and end with vampires. Seeing a barrow-wight casually saunter to the main character’s front door is fabulous!\n\nThe novella is meant to focus on discovering who turned such a young girl (something that just shouldn’t be done, according to the characters in the book), but the author skillfully sneaks in gobs of character development and backstory, fleshing out characters already introduced in the series. I adore good character development, so I was already satisfied. But, not only that, but the elusive Dracula himself pops up.\n\nWhile this is billed as a standalone, I think that you really should read the other books in order to really become invested in this. There are only three, so it’s an easy (and fun) assignment. It might be a little odd to say that a book involving vampires is cute, but there’s really no other description: Bitter Waters is a cute addition to a genuinely fun series.\n\nBooks with Relationships for People who Don’t Love Love: 2024 Edition\n\nI am quite possibly the least romantic person, who is also happily married, that you will ever encounter. I am not the sort of person who is going to often appreciate meet-cutes or sweet romantic gestures in books (with a very few exceptions). That being said, there are all sorts of love, from romance to friendship, and even my heart of stone can appreciate a good loving relationship in a book. Here are some books with great relationships for people who don’t love love.\n\nYou can read my previous posts about relationships here: Books with Relationships for People who Don’t Love Love 2023 Edition, Books with Relationships for People who Don’t Love Love.\n\nThe Hexologists by Josiah Bancroft\n\nThere is something wonderfully refreshing about a healthy, established married relationship in literature. It doesn’t happen nearly enough, in my opinion. Iz and Warren make a great team, and their mutual regard and respect for each other makes the already great book even better.\n\nEmily Wilde’s Map of the Otherlands by Heather Fawcett\n\nEmily Wilde is anti-social and cantankerous. Wendell Brambley is lazy and charming. They each love the other in their own quirky way. This comes out in a mutual exasperated appreciation, some sweet moments, and some genuinely funny ones.\n\nA Necromancer Called Gam Gam by Adam Holcombe\n\nThe motherly personality of Gam Gam the Necromaner, who takes in a heartbroken girl who really needs a friend, is absolutely wonderful. Their relationship was touching and made me smile. There are all sorts of love, and the love in this novella is protective and kind.\n\nBookshops and Bonedust by Travis Baldree\n\nThe orcish main character, Viv, returns in the prequel to the charming Legends and Lattes. While she does have a “fade to black” sort of dalliance (another big win for me, as I’m not a ginormous fan of sex scenes), it’s the love between friends that puts Bookshops and Bonedust firmly on this list. The ragtag group of companions is delightful, adding a new group to the found-family trope.\n\nRook by William Ritter\n\nIf you’ve read Rook, which takes place in the world of the Jackaby series (and if you haven’t read the fantastic Jackaby series, why on earth not?), you’re probably wondering why I put this book on the list. Well, stay with me here. Abigail Rook and R.F. Jackaby have a supportive and loving friendship. Sure, it’s not a romance, but so what? In this installment, Rook is struggling to find her place and use her new gifts. She’s scared and overwhelmed. R.F. Jackaby is her biggest cheerleader. He knows when to leave a kind word and when to push her to stretch her talents. Plus, the book itself is exciting!\n\n*Should you choose to purchase any of these books through my Bookshop link, I will receive a small commission at no extra cost to you.\n\nA Trick of the Shade: Gravity’s Daughter by Stephanie Caye\n\nThank you to the author for providing me with this book. All opinions are my own. A Trick of the Shade is available now.\n\nThis is the sequel to The Flaws of Gravity. I’ll do my best to avoid the dreaded spoilers, but a few might sneak by. You have been warned.\n\nA Trick of the Shade continues the story of Jude, a half-faerie with an odd ability. She can defy gravity. This in and of itself is unusual in faerie lore (at least, as far as I’ve experienced it), which I already found intriguing in book one. Add in a majorly snarktastic main character, and you’ve got me hooked.\n\nA Trick of the Shade is no different in that respect. Jude continues to deliver in the snark and sass department, as her luck continues to be abysmal. Once again, she finds herself in over her head (well, sometimes. Other times, she’s above the situation, although that doesn’t seem much safer). There’s never a dull moment.\n\nThere’s a lot going on in A Trick of the Shade, and I mean a lot. As with The Flaws of Gravity, I found myself a bit confused at times, especially in the beginning. I believe the author doles out information incredibly sparingly on purpose, to keep the reader off balance and guessing. It’s a unique choice, and it ends up working well, despite the occasional confusion.\n\nThe characters are all great, but Jude once again stole the show. The way she deals with things (and the amount of chirping that she does) is a ton of fun. I particularly appreciated the way she played off of Daniel, who is her opposite in some ways. I wouldn’t say that her character changes all that much from The Flaws of Gravity, but this is a book that you read for the adrenaline and the tongue-in-cheek humor. A Trick of the Shade is massively enjoyable.\n\nShould you choose to purchase this book through my Bookshop, I will receive a small commission at no extra cost to you.\n\nThe Heavy Metal Book Tag\n\nI came across the coolest booktag on Peatlong’s blog! That is not surprising: Peatlong has one of my very favorite blogs. He has kindly given permission for me to do the heavy metal book tag as well. All definitions regarding the various metal subgenres are Peatlong’s since he is a far bigger expert on metal music than I am.\n\nIf you end up doing this tag, please credit and link back to Peatlong, the creator!\n\nHeavy Metal:\n\nA classic book\n\nIn the beginning, bands fused psychedelic rock and the blues in a loud, abrasive howl at the world. Bands like Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, and Deep Purple. This would become Heavy Metal and the world would never be the same again…\n\nThe Three Musketeers by Alexandre Dumas\n\nIf I had to pick a favorite classic, The Three Musketeers would definitely be on the shortlist! I refuse to pick only one favorite “classic” metal band.\n\nThrash Metal\n\nA Speedy Read\n\nAs bands like Iron Maiden and Motorhead sped the genre up, a major evolution would happen in the Bay Area as bands like Metallica, Slayer, Anthrax and Megadeath took it a step further and created Thrash Metal, a sound of whiplash aggression that would become big in Germany, Brazil, and, well, everywhere…\n\nThe Six Deaths of the Saint by Alix E. Harrow\n\nThe Six Deaths of the Saint is short, even for a novella. That being said, it still packs a punch. Alix E. Harrow is a massively talented author and, as soon as I finished reading this, I immediately read it again. Peatlong’s mention of thrash metal’s “whiplash aggression” is an apt way of describing this novella as well.\n\nGlam Metal\n\nA Book with Decadence\n\nWhile some made metal more confrontational, others made it more accessible. Glam Metal spawned in LA when bands like Motley Crue and Dokken popularised a mix of glam rock aesthetics, pop melodies on metal rhythms, and songs about a riotous good time.\n\nThe Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald\n\nWith themes such as wealth at the cost of morality (I will not talk politics, I will not talk politics…) and disillusionment with the American ideal, is it any wonder that F. Scott’s book came to mind? The book drips with glamor and decadence, although there is rottenness visible underneath all the glitz.\n\nDoom Metal\n\nA Book with Crushing Sadness\n\nAnother route was to slow it down. Bands like Pentagram, St Vitus, Candlemass and Trouble would take Black Sabbath’s sound and make it slower, heavier, and then sing about all the things associated with being absolutely miserable.\n\nThe House of Sorrowing Stars by Beth Cartwright\n\nThe House of Sorrowing Stars is about grief in all its forms, from the bitterness and anger of fresh grief to the acceptance of loss and the knowledge that there will always be a “before” and an “after”. It’s a beautiful book but, man, it’s heavy. It’s not the sort of book you just pick up and put down easily. Like doom metal, it’s something you experience to your core.\n\nDeath Metal\n\nA Book with Brutal Violence\n\nThe Florida heat will piss anyone off. So much that bands like Death, Morbid Angel, and Deicide took the more extreme thrash template (particularly Possessed) and made it heavier, darker, and nastier, growling about the most fucked up shit as they did.\n\nGone to the Wolves by John Wray\n\nI almost picked George R.R. Martin’s series, which is violent as all get out, but hear me out on this: Gone to the Wolves is a coming-of-age novel which takes place during the 80s heavy metal scene. As these three teens navigate growing up, their love of metal in its many forms reflects their experiences. The violence in this book, while not on par with the Red Wedding, is much more shocking. Because it’s believable. From emotional violence to racially motivated violence and domestic abuse, death metal and black metal form a backdrop through which much heavier themes are explored. To be honest, I didn’t like Gone to the Wolves, but I don’t think it’s a book that is meant to be liked. It is meant to crawl into your mind and leave you unsettled. It definitely did that.\n\nProg Metal\n\nA Structurally Complex Book\n\nAs more and more bands looked for ways to build on what they’d heard, they’d inevitably turn to prog rock. The mix was pioneered by bands like Fates Warning, Queensryche and Savatage, but has grown and twisted into a thousand shapes over the years – as per the name.\n\nThe Seven and a Half Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle by Stuart Turton\n\nThe main character starts each day in the body of a different guest at a large estate, knowing that Evelyn Hardcastle will be murdered each night until he discovers the identity of the killer. There are twists upon turns and the book defies expectations of both writing and genre.\n\nBlack Metal\n\nA Book with Evil for the Sake of Evil\n\nMetal lent itself easily to shocking imagery like Satanism, as bands like Venom and Bathory found out. The blend of fast-paced tremolo, aggressive shrieking, and lots and lots of evil crystallised into Black Metal in Norway, easily the most controversial of the sub-genres for the crimes stemming from its rise.\n\nA Child Called “It” by Dave Pelzer\n\nA Child Called “It” is the most disturbing book I have ever read all the way through, without giving up on it. It was required reading for a class I took and it flat-out made me sick to my stomach. Anyone who can abuse a child like that is truly evil. There is no excuse.\n\nPower Metal\n\nA Book All About Glory\n\nAn offshoot from the main branch of heavy metal, pioneers like Helloween, Manilla Road, and Cirith Urgol would take the galloping songs about fantastical subjects and turn it into a whole thing. If ever there was music to be listened to with a broadsword in one hand and a mug of ale in the other, this is it.\n\nBeowulf translated by Seamus Heaney\n\nThere could be no other choice for me. Beowulf is motivated by the search for glory and a desire to be remembered for his heroic actions. Beowulf has influenced many authors over the years, cementing its place among the early greats.\n\nAlternative Metal\n\nA Popular Book\n\nA sort of catch-all name for the various types of metal you’ll hear most often on the radio, alt-metal comes from many places but started with bands like Faith No More and Jane’s Addiction, grew big in the grunge days, and also contains trends like nu-metal and rap metal.\n\nLegends and Lattes by Travis Baldree\n\nThis book has been everywhere. I don’t usually read cozy fantasy, but curiosity got the best of me. I’m so glad it did! Legends and Lattes is delightful, as is the recently released prequel, Bookshops and Bonedust.\n\nGothic Metal\n\nA Book with Big Gothic Atmosphere\n\nGothic metal is usually credited as starting as an offshoot of the doom movement, with Northern English bands like Paradise Lost and My Dying Bride taking a dramatically sombre and romantic approach to the subject material\n\nOne Dark Window by Rachel Gillig\n\nOne Dark Window is gothically gorgeous. Like gothic metal, this book is more than just the words. It’s a mood. It’s oppressive and darkly beautiful.\n\nFolk Metal\n\nA Book that Revitalizes Old Standards\n\nIn the early 90s, bands like Skyclad and Cruachan would start incorporating folk melodies into their music, sparking a genre that would be adopted in many countries, each place working with their own native traditions, with Scandinavia turning into a particular stronghold\n\nKnight’s Ransom by Jeff Wheeler\n\nKnight’s Ransom is reminiscent of Arthurian fantasy, while also bringing to mind “classic” fantasy greats such as Tad Williams. Honor is everything and, while far from being telegraphed, there is a familiar feeling to the sequence of events throughout the story. It draws from what came before while making its own unique mark.\n\nSymphonic Metal\n\nA Book that is Really Quite Dramatic\n\nUsually seen as an offshoot of Gothic, Symphonic Metal majors in big bombastic melodies, plenty of orchestral passages, and women with operatic voices. The initial major acts were Therion, Nightwish, and Within Temptation\n\nThe Death I Gave Him by Em X. Liu\n\nThis book is a reimagining of Hamlet, so a sense of the dramatic is a given. The Death I Gave Him is brilliantly written, each word placed deliberately to lend to a sense of desperation and of being trapped. It’s never over the top, which made each pause or inner commentary that much more compelling.\n\nPost Metal\n\nA Cross-Genre or Experimental Book\n\nEvery genre has its post-genre. In metal’s case, it’s post-metal, a vast, cavernous, and layered approach to the genre pioneered by bands like Neurosis and Godflesh in the early 90s. At least we haven’t got to post-post-metal yet.\n\nThe Tainted Cup by Robert Jackson Bennet\n\nI really do love a good fantasy mystery. And The Tainted Cup is a good fantasy mystery. The author meshed a classic detective mystery trope with a rich fantasy, making awesome soup (I promise my review will be better worded).\n\nWell, there you have it! Should you choose to purchase any books through my Bookshop, I will receive a small commission at no extra cost to you. Now, I’m off to listen to some music!\n\nIt’s Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas: Adult Books 2023 Edition\n\nAre you looking for recommendations for great adult books to give as gifts this year? No? Too bad. You’re getting them anyway. I’ve attempted short breakdowns of each plot, rather unsuccessfully I worry, as well as giving a reason why each book would be an excellent gift. Enjoy!\n\nEmily Wilde’s Encyclopaedia of Faeries by Heather Fawcett\n\nThis book is so much fun! If you have read the Amelia Peabody mysteries, just picture Amelia with faeries instead of pyramids. Of course, that comparison probably won’t make sense to many of you. Suffice it to say, the main character of this book is stubborn, determined, and quirky. Add in faerie shenanigans and a fantastic narrative style (written as journal entries), and you have a wonderful book.\n\nReview\n\nThe Murder of Roger Ackroyd by Agatha Christie\n\nI’ve been slowly reading through Agath Christie’s extensive collection with my oldest. This one was a reread for me and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The great thing about Christie’s books is that you don’t necessarily have to read them in order. Any one (or two, or three…) of her books would be a great gift.\n\nThe Magician’s Daughter by H.G. Parry\n\nThe plot of The Magician’s Daughter is interesting: Biddy has grown up on a deserted island off the coast of Ireland, with her mentor (a father figure and magician) for company. He leaves on mysterious errands from time to time and one night he doesn’t return. Biddy is thrust into a new world that she doesn’t understand, navigating dangers and crossing from childhood into adulthood at the same time. However, it is the tone and prose of the book that make it so special. It drips with magic and wonder.\n\nReview\n\nMiss Percy’s Pocket Guide to the Care and Feeding of British Dragons by Quenby Olson\n\nThis is a cozy and fun read, not my usual fare but absolutely delightful. Miss Percy, a rather introverted spinster, finds adventure, friends, and new purpose when she somehow inherits a dragon egg. This is such a great book!\n\nReview\n\nThe Hexologists by Josiah Bancroft\n\nThis fantasy mystery is so much fun! The creativity of the plot and the shenanigans that the characters get up to make for a massively entertaining read. Bonus points for a happily married couple in the main roles. That doesn’t happen too often in fantasy books, and I love seeing it!\n\nReview\n\nThe Heroes of Spira by Dorian Hart\n\nThis is one of my favorite series! Fans of epic fantasy, quests, found family, and excellent characters will love these books! Bonus: this series is fully published, which means you can grab all five books now, instead of waiting impatiently for the next book to come out.\n\nReview\n\nLegends and Lattes or Bookshops and Bonedust by Travis Baldree\n\nLegends and Lattes is a fresh take on fantasy, with a battle-weary orc named Viv who wants nothing more than to settle down and open a coffee shop. Running a coffee house is hard, and she is unprepared for the new sort of battle she finds herself in the midst of. Viv also finds herself making friends, despite her prickly nature. Bookshops and Bonedust is a prequel that takes place beforehand. It is equally fun and cozy and you can’t go wrong with either book.\n\nReview\n\nThe Tempest Blade series by Ricardo Victoria\n\nThere is so much to love about this series, especially if you’re a fan of shows such as My Hero Academia. It perfectly balances action with story and character development and will have readers of science fiction (or science fantasy) and hopepunk ignoring everything to see what happens next.\n\nThe Sword Defiant by Gareth Hanrahan\n\nThe Sword Defiant is a truly incredible look at the question of what happens after the good guys win. Does everyone “live happily ever after” or do the heroes become the villains? The characters are nuanced, the plot is complex (I’m really not doing it justice in my attempt at a short break-down), the world is fascinating, and the book had me staying up way too late to finish it. Hanrahan is a master storyteller and The Sword Defiant will hook any fantasy reader.\n\nReview\n\nRogues Edited by George R.R. Martin and Gardner Dozois\n\nI’m hard to please when it comes to collections of short stories, but this is a strong showing. I loved the majority of the stories, and the few that didn’t do it for me were well-written anyway. This book explores the many different interpretations of a rogue in literature with some big names.\n\nReview\n\nThe nonfiction I’d recommend is very niche but is excellent if you are interested in the subject: What Board Games Mean to Me, Dungeons and Dragons and Philosophy (I don’t agree with everything, which made it that much more interesting), and Dungeons and Dragons Art and Arcana: A Visual History.\n\nShould you choose to purchase any of these books from my Bookshop linked below, I will receive a small commission at no extra charge to you.\n\nJodie’s Bookshop: Witty and Sarcastic Book Picks\n\nAssassin’s Creed: The Resurrection Plot by Kate Heartfield\n\nThank you to Aconyte Books for providing me with this book in exchange for my honest\n\nopinion. Assassin’s Creed: The Resurrection Plot is available now.\n\nGame tie-in novels are rarely in the middle for me: either I enjoy the heck out of them, or I hate them. It can be a challenge to write a book that feels both like the game and is a complete story all on its own. The Resurrection Plot does it beautifully.\n\nThe book starts off with a conversation between two characters: Pierette Arnaud and Safiya El-Nadi, as they plan an operation. It is interrupted by a scuffle with a spy and that is this book in a nutshell. It is an exciting story arc folded in among well-written action scenes and I loved it.\n\nThe book follows Arnaud as she comes across a plot to get rid of all free will. Pretty intense, right? Of course, there is maneuvering on a larger scale that spans other books and storylines. It is never too much, though, although it is a lot. Arnaud is reunited with Simeon Price, whom I enjoyed reading about immensely. There is an interesting character dynamic between the student and teacher. From being close friends to having major trust issues, their relationship actually seems to regress (although it has simply become more complex). People can be confusing messes, and I liked reading about these messes.\n\nThe plot itself is a fun one full of mayhem and a sense of urgency. The pacing was excellent, nonstop fun while still having a bit of character development. If I had to pick a part that wasn’t hands-down amazing, it would be that character development because, while the dynamic between Simeon and Arnaud was a good one, not much growth happened with anyone in the book. Of course, that isn’t what I expected from The Resurrection Plot, so I was in no way disappointed.\n\nThe story never slows down, instead location-hopping. In this way, I am reminded of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, which is a compliment of course. There were cameos from other characters, some of whom I recognized and others who would probably mean more to other people. The author really delivered on the sense of danger and excitement. The book is loads of fun, perfect for fans of both the game and good adventure books.\n\n*This review was originally published on Before We Go Blog."
