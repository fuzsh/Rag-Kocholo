        "text": "The novel I'm writing is actually along this vein, and I had the same thought as you: it appears to be a portion of the market that is yet to be fully recognized and tapped into. Whilst it definitely exists, not a lot of mainstream fiction seems to explore the vast possibilities of combining these two distinct yet similar genres.\n\nMedia are generally categorized as \"Sci-Fi/Fantasy\" because there tends to be a lot of overlap between the people who like the two different types of fiction. Although this isn't always true, it's usually enough of a generalization to assume that if someone is a fan of one, they would also be a fan of the other.\n\nHowever, a high majority of fans of both Sci-Fi and Fantasy will have an opinion on which they prefer; they will rarely like both types of fiction equally. This means that few people will looking for pieces of work that combine the two 50/50.\n\nSo writing books that split the two down the middle will be a niche audience, who are looking to read something that caters to multiple of their interests, whilst readers who prefer one over the other may choose to read it, but are unlikely to be drawn to it naturally. That's not to say that you shouldn't write it, but you would need to understand that it is a niche market that you are writing for.\n\nWhat you may be looking for, and what I believe is the best solution to the issue, is to not do both entirely equally, but rather have either a Fantasy piece with Sci-Fi elements or a Sci-Fi novel containing aspects of Fantasy.\n\nThis way, let's say you choose to write your first example of Fantasy creatures in a post-apocalyptic age on earth, you could write it as a Fantasy novel with swords & sorcery, but also contains things such as radiation, ancient technologies from humans before the apocalypse, and even maybe popular themes of Sci-Fi such as attempting to rebuild civilization.\n\nHowever, it would need to be made clear to the readers early on what it is they are reading. Within the first 2 or 3 chapters you would need to establish which genre your piece is, but also establish that it will also contain portions of another genre.\n\nThat last thing you want to do is write an entirely Fantasy novel, then in the final couple of chapters include a big twist that they were on a spaceship all along, unless you drop clues about it throughout the story.\n\nI do not believe that the readership of SF and F is as distinct as you claim. I love, read, and write both SF and F. I also like crime fiction, romance, and many other genres. Many people have tastes that are not totally exclusive.\n\nBut reading is like eating: Just because I like both hotdogs and strawberry cake does not mean that I like my stawberry cake with mustard. In the same way I don't like my Fantasy and Science Fiction mixed up. I don't like guns fighting magic. Because technology and magic don't mix. And I don't like dragons in space ships. Because a dragon has a mystical meaning, a psychological truth, that does not fit the context of either space opera or hard SF.\n\nIf you want to mix genres, you'll have to be so good that in fact you are creating a new genre, not merely mixing elements from two existing genres. Your work has to feel fresh and inspiring, like a new idea, not like two old ideas thrown together. And that new genre made from SF and F already exists:\n\nThe hybrid genre of Science Fiction and Fantasy is called\n\nScience Fantasy\n\nA famous successful example is Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern series. Other examples and subgenres are given in the Wikipedia article on Science Fantasy.\n\nAs for your elves in SF: that is not for me. Like dragons, elves have a specific meaning for me that makes them incompatible with SF. But I know that there are many novels in which elves have become something more akin to an alien humanoid species, and there isn't really that big a step from certain kinds of fantasy to putting the elves in spaceships. I don't quite understand why you would need these aliens to be called \"elves\", and how what elves are in folk tales has anything to do with the story you want to tell, but again: hybrid genres are popular, from urban fantasy to steampunk.\n\nSpacefaring elves can be found in Warhammer 40,000 and Elfquest.\n\nWell, as almost anything regarding readers, it depends.\n\nFantasy and sci-fi are broad genres. They have several subgenres each, and not every subgenre on each one caters to the entire public that reads sci-fi or fantasy. When you are mixing sci-fi and fantasy, you are actually mixing up subgenres of the two, and that combination may or may not work in your favor. Still, we have some very good examples of how it can work nicely - and not just on books!\n\nNote that I'm not giving just examples on which sci-fi and fantasy are mixed in equal parts - some of those examples just have a little bit of the other genre added in for extra flavor.\n\nShadowrun is a RPG setting which mixes up heavily sci-fi and fantasy elements. It is one of the best examples how to make elves, orcs and The Matrix work on the same universe.\n\nDiscworld is a heavy fantasy work with some dabbling on sci-fi elements. While it is fantasy to the core, the sci-fi elements spice up the books in a interesting way when they appear. They are not core to it by no means, but they do add up to the works.\n\nStar Wars is a popular space opera with heavy fantasy elements on a \"spacey\" backdrop. While there are spaceships, FTL travel, and laser weapons, the core of this work is heavily grounded around the magical energy that is The Force, sword-based duels and mystical overtones.\n\nFoundation by Isaac Asimov is a heavy sci-fi book with a drop of magic on it, by means of telepathic powers of some characters. While there is a scientific explanation for it on the books, it still has that \"plot-powered\" usefulness that magic usually has.\n\nGolarion is the default RPG setting for Pathfinder. While it is mostly fantasy, it does have some hints of sci-fi with its multiple planets, aliens, and even the possibility of magic-powered space travel.\n\nThe Dark Tower by Stephen King. It is a incredible series (for the good and the bad meanings of the word \"incredible\"), and has several fantasy elements mashed up with a really subtle sci-fi background.\n\nIron Kingdoms is a RPG setting that is mix of tech and magic that has a deep \"steampunky\" feel. It has a really detailed way of explaining how magic-powered tech works, and is an awesome reading, even if you don't intend to play it.\n\nWarhammer 40K is the pinnacle of the \"mixed up stuff\", with space-faring elves, armored super-soldiers, psychic powers, and almost everything you can find on fantasy and sci-fi mixed up together. While it seems a bit dark because of the background narrative, it is an excellent example on how those two broad genres can be mixed up together.\n\nThe World of Synnibarr is... well, this one can't really be explained without a Google Image search. I'll leave it up to you to check it, but it is an awesome game if played with the right mindset.\n\nAsura's Wrath is an incredible tale in the form of a video game. It mixes up some barely used mythology with sci-fi tones that make the game memorable in several ways. It has a space cowboy ninja Jesus, a really angry cybernetic dad, space battles, religious overtones and a super-weapon somewhat reminiscent of the Death Star, powered by human souls. It is a hell of a trip.\n\nAs you can see, mixing up fantasy and sci-fi is not just possible but done pretty frequently. It is not something that can be done to make every single reader happy, by no means, but it is done and it works if your works are interesting enough!\n\nI think it can work if done well. I read both Sci-Fi and fantasy and enjoy both so I'm perhaps your target audience as I see no reason that the two could not be mixed if there is a point to doing that. As long as the story supports the need for it and it's done in a logical and believable fashion then it should be fine.\n\nYou could also explore the effect of the discovery of real 'magic' on the advance sci-fi people. Maybe initial denial and attempts to scientifically explain it followed by a split in the culture caused by part of the population simply wanting to believe in the 'magic'. That might give your Elves an embedded force sympathetic to them and allow them to eventually win even if they were not initially superior to the high tech people on the battlefield.\n\nOn the other hand if you try and cram both into a single novel just as a means to try and double the potential audience then it will probably fall flat.\n\nOf course you can mix these genres, and by all means, pleaaase do so. A lot of bestselling and well-known works have successfully mixed these before:\n\nDragon Riders of Pern (Anne McCaffrey) have been mentioned here before. Generally, Anne McCaffrey does a lot of hybrid stuff.\n\nMarion Zimmer Bradleys \"Darkover\" Series is a nice mixture of both. And a classic. Read them.\n\nThe ShadowRun Roleplaying Game and associated computer games are definately a hybrid.\n\nRecently, i enjoyed the Shadow-OPs series a lot (Myke Cole)\n\nThe Albion computer game is also a nice example.\n\nSo, if the mixture sounds interesting in your head, and your story setting seems to be so unique, fresh and awesome that you really want to write it... go for it!\n\nCaveat: but do you really need to do it? Or could your story be achieved without going all the way to mixing two genres? Could your spacelelves just be psionically active aliens? If that was the case, i'd suggest you try to go for the pure genre, as it will probably not only be easier to write (think of all the interactions and tech-questions you don't have to answer to), but might also be easier to publish.\n\nI am actually in the progress of writing a Sci-fi/Fantasy novel series myself. I did have the same question concerning the topic before finally finding the full motivation. I say combining the two genres is possible and it might even come out amazing if you know how to combine them. There are great examples of what these two genres could bring when they're combined.\n\nFinal Fantasy. One of my favorite series ever, even though it's a game/movie series. It's amazing, and although some of the endings were unsatisfying, this series is a great example of a Sci-fi/Fantasy\n\nAvatar Another great example, with great descriptions of the technology and fantasy landscapes.\n\nStar Wars It can also be categorized as a Sci-fi/Fantasy considering all of the technology used, like the Millenium Falcon and the unrealistic elements that can't be defined by science like The Force.\n\nAlthough the one thing that made me write this genre was the fact that i'm writing this for myself, and hopefully other people would like it. So check your goal first, if you're aiming on some audiences, you should do some research on what kind readers you want.\n\nI hope this helped.\n\nI am a SciFi and Fantasy reader myself. I usually read Fantasy, and when I want to take a break from that I read some Science Fiction. I've read some books where they mix SciFi and Fantasy and I've really enjoyed them. The Saga of Tramorea by Javier Negrete is a good example, it consists of four books:\n\nThe Sword of Fire\n\nThe Spirit of the Magician\n\nThe Dream of the Gods\n\nThe Heart of Tramorea\n\nIt is a tetralogy based on a \"samurai style\" fantasy. It begins fulfilling all the features of the genre of epic fantasy (an imaginary world without technology, set in a medieval setting with magicians, imaginary creatures, heroes fighting with swords...), but through the history all that magic is being revealead as high science (without stepping in to deep, just deep enough for you to know how this could work) in a wonderfully explained story.\n\nI would recommend you give it a go.\n\nAs per Orson Scott Card comments, one thing is mixing some science explanation in a fantasy book and another thing altogether is to stop the story in order to explan in two or three pages some sciency thing (something like this happens in Ender's 3 or 4, I remember reading too many pages full of gibberish (to me) about how outside the sapce our rules doesn't apply and therefore you can do anything you want, or something among those lines).\n\nIt is a historical fact that The Magazine of Fantasy started in 1949 changed its name to The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction starting with the second issue and still uses the title today. No doubt the proportions of fantasy and science fiction vary over the decades.\n\nThe Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction - Wikipedia\n\nAnd take a look at the contents of Fantastic Stories of the Imagination volume 13 # 4, April 1964. I have a copy of that issue packed away somewhere and remember some of the stories in it.\n\nThe cover story, \"Centipedes of Space\" is a space opera with a space fleet fighting an interstellar war. But the plot depends on a rather metaphysical speculation. \"The Rule of Names\" by Ursula K. Le Guin is an early Earthsea story with wizards and dragons. And \"The Devil Came to our Valley\" by Fulton T. Grant, didn't seem to have any science fiction or fantasy elements, although it is described as sort of a \"lost race\" story.\n\nFantastic Stories of Imagination, April 1964\n\nHere are some more stories that mix science fiction and fantasy elements:\n\nKrull (1983) mixes sword and sorcery and alien invasion of the planet Krull.\n\nStar Trek: Deep Space Nine mixes science fiction and space opera with the plotine of the protagonist becoming the emissary of the wormhole aliens/Prophets worshipped by the Bajorans and the Pagh wraiths.\n\nAre At the Mountains of Madness, \"The whisperer in darkness\", and \"The Shadow out of Time\" fantasy, science fiction, mixed, or pure H.P. Lovecraft?\n\nThere are countless millions of people alive today who use the products of science and technology and believe that science and technology work and also believe in various supernatural aspects of their religions.\n\nAnd so there are many millions of people who believe that just as science fictional airplanes, computers, atomic bombs, trips to the Moon, etc. have come true, many even more advanced science fiction elements will become real in the future, and ho also believe in the reality of supernatural beings of various types.\n\nThere are some people who would believe, for example, that a story about a benevolent god assigning an angel-like being to secretly stop a mad dictator from starting World War Three and killing hundreds of millions of persons was perfectly plausible.\n\nA reader can enjoy a fantasy story equally ell if it is set on a flat Earth that is the center of the universe or if it is set on a spherical Earth that is one of gazillions of of planets in the universe. J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth is both a different times.\n\nIf a reader can believe that elves and dragons might exist alongside an ancient or medieval human society, he can believe they might continue to exist alongside an advanced star travelling human society.\n\nIf a religious reader can believe in science and technology existing in a world with the supernatural beings of his religion, he can accept a story in which science and technology exist in a world with fictional supernatural beings.\n\nSo it is possible but not guaranteed for stories that mix science fiction and fantasy elements to succeed."
