        "text": "I’ve been publishing books since 2013. Since then, I’ve learned from some of the best indie authors and have implemented what they’ve shown me. I’ve jumped from an author averaging $89 a month selling books, to making five figures a month selling books. Fifty percent of it is because of storytelling and picking a kick-ass editor, an amazing cover artist, and working my blurbs like they’ve gone out of style, street teams, beta readers, and the worlds finest proof reader — in my humble opinion.\n\nAnd the other fifty percent is because of marketing, interviewing the masters in my industry, and implementing what they’ve laid out and taught me — especially with marketing (and I can’t emphasize that enough…marketing, marketing, marketing).\n\nNow, let’s get to the main topic of this article: Izzy Shows. She’s the wonderful new fiction author that has just come on the scene like a caterpillar emerging from its cocoon. Okay, I know, that’s a terrible analogy, but it’s late and I want to get to the point.\n\nIzzy Shows has so far made $109,000 in ten months. How did she do it? Well, she allowed me to show you with her own Kindle Board posts, to which I’m going to simply copy and paste below. Why don’t I just link the Kindle Board posts and send you to another website? Because a lot of times several “links” in an article or a blog post can be a roadblock for people.\n\nLet’s not block your road.\n\nBelow are three of Izzy’s launches. They are all step by step and well detailed. My launch strategy is very similar to hers, but I didn’t document them as well as she documented hers. As you will see, her strategy slightly changed from launch to launch. She experimented and found what worked best. And each launch was better and better.\n\nRemember, success always leaves clues and it’s your job to find what clues work best for you.\n\nSo, let’s welcome Izzy Shows.\n\nIzzy Shows writes urban fantasy and space fantasy novels for adults. She has read just about everything — fantasy, science fiction, dystopian, historical fiction, and much more. Izzy is also an avid LARPer. Don’t know what that is? Shoot her a message and she’ll gab your ear off about it. She loves to talk with fans, so don’t be shy — be forewarned, though, she can rant a good bit.\n\nJoin her Facebook group, Izzy’s Wizard Nation, to get to know her better! https://www.facebook.com/groups/izzyswizardnation/\n\nShe grew up in Wilson, North Carolina. It’s a small town about an hour east of Raleigh, and she spent most of her time finding adventure, filling up notebooks with every story that came to her head, and being reprimanded by teachers for reading in class. Her first fiction novel came out in January of 2017, and she releases about every month; so sign up for the newsletter to stay on top of things!\n\nAnd, back to the article.\n\nThe rest of the article are her words, and like I said above, it is copied and pasted from her Kindle Board’s posts. The remainder of this article is very long, so come back and forth to it to learn as much as you possibly can. I’ll also be interviewing her in a couple of weeks in order for you to get a more in-depth look at who she is and an even deeper look on how she did it.\n\nBrandon Ellis\n\nwww.brandon-ellis.com\n\nLAUNCH ONE\n\nSo I love reading the launch threads, they’re some of my favorite threads here on the kboards. Maybe mine is redundant, maybe no one cares, but I do so I thought I’d share.\n\nSome background:\n\nI wrote Grave Mistake large in part without doing a lot of market research. Woops! I didn’t know what a ‘no no’ that was at the time, but I also was an avid urban fantasy reader and swear on The Dresden Files like they’re holy books. So I did know a thing or two about tropes in the urban fantasy genre, and I’d like to say that served me well. I banged out my book with the original intention to traditional publish, or at the very least to shop it around until someone said ‘yes’ and then turn and run the other way because a gatekeeper approved me so now I could pursue the option that made money.\n\nI never said I was bright.\n\nEnter a series of vlogs by a self-professed self-publishing guru. I didn’t know much at all at that point, but they said they had published one book and now they’re a full time author, and isn’t that the dream? So I gobbled up their videos, all the while thinking I could publish a book a year and be fine and dandy — hey, this person is still editing book two a full year and a half after their first book came out, why shouldn’t I be able to do that? Hm. Because I’m not that person.\n\nEnter kboards! Oh my goodness did I devour launch threads like they were going out of style when I first got here, Domino Finn and JA Cipriano’s were two of my favorites that I kept returning to. At the time I was still struggling with the idea that fast publishing had to equal bad writing, but I could see that fast publishing meant a living…and then I read the books and promptly told myself to go sit in a corner and think about how mean I’d been, even if I’d kept the comments to myself. So I’m sorry for all the bad thoughts I put out into the world! I swear I know better now.\n\nI can’t really pinpoint the moment I switched from “I’m just reading these self-publishing posts for fun” to “I’m going to do this and I’m going to give it my all.” It happened somewhere in those launch threads, though, I’m certain of it.\n\nSo after much editing on my part, I sent Grave Mistake to the editor, and hired Bookfly Designs to do my cover — which I’m still absolutely in love with!\n\nAnd then I lined up my launch plan. For the sake of not repeating myself overly much, I’ll go ahead and say that FB and AMS ads were a large part of the launch plan.\n\nI participated in an IF cross promo and used FB ads to drive traffic to my IF giveaway to build up my mailing list. I knew these weren’t going to be the best subscribers, but I wanted to start somewhere.\n\nI also put the book up for preorder one week before release, and scrounged on Goodreads for ARC reviewers. I had the paperback up for two weeks prior where my ARC reviewers could leave their reviews, and had the paperback and ebook preorder linked before launch. And just to test out the FB ad with the audience I had crafted for the IF giveaway, I ran a fb ad pointed at my preorder as well as an AMS ad to learn how to use it.\n\nI managed to garner 42 preorders, which I thought was pretty darn snazzy considering no one knows who the heck I am or why they should care about me.\n\nDay 1\n\nEnticing Journey Book Promotions\n\nGenrePulse\n\nDay 2\n\nEnticing Journey Book Promotions\n\nBooks Butterfly\n\nDay 3\n\nEnticing Journey Book Promotions\n\nBooks Butterfly\n\nPrice Dropped Books\n\nDay 4\n\nGenreCrave Newsletter\n\nDay 5\n\nBargain Booksy\n\nDay 6\n\nGenreCrave Book Blast\n\nDay 7\n\nChoosy Bookworm\n\nDay 8\n\nI Love Vampires\n\nDay 9\n\nRomancing the Dragon\n\nGeez, that’s a spaced out promotion schedule! I know, but I read a lot of Chris Fox and watched his videos, and I learned that Amazon likes to see steady sales, not spikes. So, since I didn’t have an amazing mailing list to space out the announcement to, I did it with promotions. I used the resources I had available.\n\nDid it work? You tell me.\n\nNo, I’m serious, I have no idea what constitutes a good launch for a new author and I’m kind of hoping I’m not making a joke of myself by sharing this with you all. I was going to make this thread at the beginning of my launch, but nerves got the better of me. The official excuse was that I wanted my also-boughts to populate first. Which they have!\n\nAs of right this second, I am sitting at 1,467 in the store. #2 in Werewolves & Shifters, #4 in Psychics, and #4 in Vampires.\n\nMy best ranks so far(today is Day 4):\n\nDay 1\n\nSales: 44\n\nKENP: 2,406\n\nHighest Rank: 3,305\n\nNiche 1: 6, Book Psychics\n\nNiche 2: 7, Kindle Psychics\n\nNiche 3: 7, Vampires\n\nDay 2\n\nSales: 40\n\nKENP: 6,789\n\nHighest Rank: 3,272\n\nNiche 1: 6, Kindle Psychics\n\nNiche 2: 7, Vampires\n\nNiche 3: 7, Book Psychics\n\nDay 3\n\nSales: 42\n\nKENP: 5,728\n\nHighest Rank: 2,534\n\nNiche 1: 4, Vampires\n\nNiche 2: 5, Werewolves & Shifters\n\nNiche 3: 5, Book Psychics\n\nDay 4\n\nSales: 105\n\nKENP: 7,393\n\nHighest Rank: 1,245\n\nNiche 1: 1, Werewolves & Shifters\n\nNiche 2: 3, Vampires\n\nNiche 3: 3, Psychics\n\nDay 5\n\nSales: 127\n\nKENP: 11,678\n\nHighest Rank: 928\n\nNiche 1: 1, Werewolves & Shifters\n\nNiche 2: 2, Witches & Wizards\n\nNiche 3: 2, Vampires\n\nDay 6\n\nSales: 168\n\nKENP: 12,502\n\nHighest Rank: 656\n\nNiche 1: 1, Werewolves & Shifters\n\nNiche 2: 1, Vampires\n\nNiche 3: 1, Witches & Wizards\n\nDay 7\n\nSales: 127\n\nKENP: 15,192\n\nHighest Rank: 671\n\nNiche 1: 1, Vampires\n\nNiche 2: 1, Werewolves & Shifters, Books\n\nNiche 3: 1, Werewolves & Shifters, Kindle\n\nDay 8\n\nSales: 128\n\nKENP: 20,269\n\nHighest Rank: 558\n\nNiche 1: 1, Witches & Wizards\n\nNiche 2: 1, Psychics\n\nNiche 3: 1, Werewolves & Shifters\n\nDay 9\n\nSales: 121\n\nKENP: 22,978\n\nHighest Rank: 559\n\nNiche 1: 1, Book Werewolves & Shifters\n\nNiche 2: 1, Psychics\n\nNiche 3: 1, Kindle Werewolves & Shifters\n\nDay 10\n\nSales: 180\n\nKENP: 26,247\n\nHighest Rank: 390\n\nNiche 1: 1, Ghosts\n\nNiche 2: 1, Psychics\n\nNiche 3: 1, Werewolves & Shifters\n\nDay 11\n\nSales: 177\n\nKENP: 37,944\n\nHighest Rank: 353\n\nNiche 1: 1, Vampires\n\nNiche 2: 1, Werewolves & Shifters\n\nNiche 3: 1, Ghosts\n\nDay 12\n\nSales: 191\n\nKENP: 39,112\n\nHighest Rank: 283\n\nNiche 1: 1, Ghosts\n\nNiche 2: 1, Witches & Wizards\n\nNiche 3: 1, Psychics\n\nDay 13\n\nSales: 253\n\nKENP: 60,872\n\nHighest Rank: 241\n\nNiche 1: 1, Werewolves & Shifters\n\nNiche 2: 1, Vampires\n\nNiche 3: 1, Psychics\n\nSo, am I crazy, or have I done pretty well for myself?\n\nEDIT 1/28:\n\nI AM NOT CRAZY. I BROKE THE TOP ONE THOUSAND. WOOOOOOOO.\n\nEDIT 2/6\n\nSo I think it’s safe to say the LAUNCH was a success. We are now entering the sticky period, where the book has been raised to $2.99, and we will see where it lands in the rankings.\n\nEDIT 2/13\n\nAll right, Grave Mistake has been at full price for one week now, and it looks like I have achieved this mythical stickiness. I have stayed in the top 500, currently in the low 400s so that might be on its way out. I also just threw book 2 up for pre-order, so we’re going to see how that does and if it affects book 1 at all. Fingers crossed I didn’t ruin everything with a semi-long pre-order. (Book 2 won’t be out until 3/28.)\n\nLAUNCH 3\n\nAll right! This is exciting. I love launch threads, they’re so much fun for me, I hope they’re fun for you, too. Quick question: are you sick of my threads documenting the different things I’m doing(launch threads, my free promo)? Go ahead and tell me to shut up, lol, and I can do that.\n\nBut, plowing ahead with the assumption that you all love me(HA, YEAH RIGHT)! I have done something that is incredibly stressful for me. I started a new series. Even crazier, I’ve got two more series I’m starting in the next two months, and Codex Blair isn’t even close to being finished…and won’t be until like 2019. That’s all beside the point, though, because this is about documenting Blood Huntress’ release! We’re now 7 days into the launch, and I thought now would be a good time to share how it’s doing (not at all related to my excitement over having beaten Grave Mistake’s highest rank and stealing a bestseller tag from Stephen King).\n\nI’m going to break this down about the same way I did Grave Mistake’s release back in January. Note that because of the way I break down(Sales, KENP, Rank, Subcat bestseller status) my launch threads are notoriously longer than some others.\n\nSome Background\n\nFeel free to skip this, it’s basically me rambling about my decision to write multiple series at the same time.\n\nI honestly don’t remember exactly when or why I decided to launch a few new series while I was still writing Codex Blair, but it’s not a decision I made lightly. It kind of reminds me of when I decided to publish Grave Mistake at all(traditional or self), I don’t remember going from “I’m writing this book because I want to write it” to “I want to publish this” — I just remember one day I was intensely researching publishing and creating immense pros and cons lists to deliberate between self and trad. Similarly, I don’t remember when I had the thought “You know, I’d like to write more series” — the earliest thought about it I can remember was posting in 20booksto50k asking if other people wrote multiple series at the same time. There was much deliberating involved, but ultimately I decided that I just wasn’t willing to wait until Codex Blair finished(it’s a 15 book series O.O) before I got to play with something new. Now, how did ‘something new’ turn into ‘three somethings new’? I have no idea. I can’t even begin to remember that. I just know that one day it was on my spreadsheet, and once it’s on my spreadsheet, can I really argue with it? One thing I’ve learned since starting Ruled by Blood, is that writing in another series refreshes me when it comes to the prior series. I was struggling to get through High Stakes, book 6 of Codex Blair, and then I took a break to write Blood Captive, Ruled by Blood’s prequel story, and suddenly I was able to come back and finish High Stakes in no time at all. It was amazing. So yeah, I think multiple series was the best idea for me.\n\nAlso, I really just wanted to figure out if I was a one hit wonder or not, you know? It was beginning to wear on me, and with every book I put out in Codex Blair, I grew more and more worried that if I waited until I finished that 15 book series, I would have trained my readers to never expect anything more from me, and that I’d be stuck writing in Codex Blair for the rest of my life. Don’t get me wrong, I love Blair, but I’ve got so many ideas, you know?\n\nAs far as Ruled by Blood goes, I took a look at things and decided I wanted to write a vampire story. They’re not exactly popular right now — fae and wizards are really hot — but I wanted to, and I threw my own spin on it, and ran away with the story. Clearly I did something right somewhere in there, because book 2 is getting great preorders.\n\nThe Plan\n\nAll right, so I mapped out a plan for promo, fb, bb, and ams ads — and of course fb and ams don’t spend exactly what you want, so things have fluctuated. Here was the original plan:\n\nAnd here are the actual numbers of what was spent on ads:\n\nAug 22:\n\nFB — 55.23\n\nAMS — 31.61\n\nBB — 7.51\n\nAug 23:\n\nFB — 68.06\n\nAMS — 34.37\n\nBB — 15.11\n\nAug 24:\n\nFB — 138.02\n\nAMS — 34.98\n\nBB — 26.33\n\nAug 25:\n\nFB — 216.12\n\nAMS — 25.37\n\nBB — 39.47\n\nAug 26:\n\nFB — 185.29\n\nAMS — 23.05\n\nBB — 41.76\n\nAug 27:\n\nFB — 175.5\n\nAMS — 25.37\n\nBB — 97.93\n\nAug 28:\n\nFB — 138.93\n\nAMS — 101.33 (not actual daily spend.

This is going to be fun, I think. I’ve been planning this for about two months now, to coincide with book 6 of the Codex Blair series release. Lots of time, effort, and of course money going into this, with the hope for an astonishing amount of sell through, fame, and glory, right? Eh, maybe not.\n\nI also thought y’all might enjoy this because it gives a little data on how my series is doing, since a lot of people enjoyed my initial launch thread in January.\n\nThis was heavily inspired by Pauline Ross’s “roll-your-own-bookbub” thread. Credit where credit is due, and you should totally read that thread if you haven’t, it’s here.\n\nSome background\n\nThe Codex Blair series has done amazingly well, in my eyes at least. When I’m running rather low spend(because I’m still very cautious with this) cpc ads I get a really great ROI and maintain a top 2k ranking, top 10 in my cats, no issue. When I’m not running anything, I generally stay in the 4–5k range, hovering around the top 20 of my cats. I have great sell through, imo, and I get a decent amount of NL sign ups from the back of my book, a good portion of which go on to join my facebook fan group where I get to chat with them which is so much fun. Considering how well the series has done so far, and also considering that it’s nowhere near done, some people might be inclined to say that I’m doing this too early. That I should wait until things cool off and I need a kick back up the charts. But I love doing things, and this seems like an interesting little research project that could pay off nicely considering I’ll have six books ready to read.\n\nOnto the fun stuff!\n\nUnlike Pauline, I opted to go for the full five days, mostly because I know that a lot of people don’t check their email every day and I didn’t want someone to miss out because they checked the day after an email was sent. Also, experimentation is fun!\n\nThe promos\n\nDay 1: Wednesday, July 26th\n\nPriceDroppedBooks\n\neBookDiscovery\n\nILVN\n\nChoosyBookworm\n\nDay 2: Thursday, July 27th\n\nGenrePulse\n\nOHFB\n\nBook Gorilla\n\nDay 3: Friday, July 28th\n\nRomancing the Dragon\n\nBooksends\n\neReaderIQ\n\nReign of Reads\n\nBook Rebel\n\nDay 4: Saturday, July 29th\n\nBookBarbarian\n\nFussy Librarian\n\nMany Books\n\nDay 5: Sunday, July 30th\n\ngenreCRAVE\n\nRobin Reads\n\nFreebooksy\n\nThe cost\n\nGod, do I really need to confess this out loud? You’re all going to hate me. I’m going to be publicly shamed for spending this amount of money. I’m sorry.\n\n-whispers in a teeny tiny voice- $1k.\n\nObjectives\n\nFun, sell through, my best sales month ever…I’ve never done any kind of free promo before, so I’m also just really interested in seeing what happens. I really don’t know what to expect with this. I have no idea what kind of numbers to expect download wise, or what sell through is going to look like from a free book to a paid book. But! Book 2 will be 99c during the free run, so that should help a little bit.\n\nI’m thinking of doing the reporting similar to how Pauline did it(can you tell the way I structured this post borrowed from her? I’m so unoriginal). I’ll do day by day, then I’ll come back in a week to report on if there was a tail or not, and if there is I’ll probably do up to a 4 week report just like she did.\n\nStats for the week before the promo\n\nTo get as clean a baseline as possible, I turned off all cpc ads this week\n\nBook: Grave Mistake\n\nAverage ranking: 4–5k\n\nAverage daily sales: 9\n\nAverage daily page reads: 17.5k\n\nWeek stats for the rest of the series(note this is a total for 4 books)\n\nBooks: Blood Hunt, Dark Descent, Wild Game, Grim Fate\n\nAverage daily sales: 29\n\nAverage daily page reads: 57k\n\nDid I miss anything? I’m so excited, it starts tomorrow!\n\n—\n\nFinal Results:\n\nIf you want to see the grand total, scroll down.\n\nDay 1:\n\nDownloads: 3,420\n\nPage reads of book 1(free book): 15,468\n\nAudiobook rank(included for curiosity purposes): 4,225\n\nBest free rank: 47\n\nSales of book 2(99c sale): 39\n\nPage reads of book 2: 10,347\n\nBest paid rank: 3,738\n\nSales of other books in series(3–5): 30\n\nPage reads of other books in series(3–5): 31,057\n\nBook 6 is separated because its sales will be abnormal to the rest of the promo due to being a new release.\n\nSales of book 6: 26\n\nPage reads of book 6: 4,004\n\nBest paid rank: 3,782\n\nDay 2:\n\nDownloads: 2,620\n\nPage reads of book 1(free book): 11,499\n\nAudiobook rank(included for curiosity purposes): 3,037\n\nBest free rank: 37\n\nSales of book 2(99c sale): 39\n\nPage reads of book 2: 13,711\n\nBest paid rank: 2,729\n\nSales of other books in series(3–5): 20\n\nPage reads of other books in series(3–5): 34,070\n\nBook 6 is separated because its sales will be abnormal to the rest of the promo due to being a new release.\n\nSales of book 6: 48\n\nPage reads of book 6: 14,239\n\nBest paid rank: 998\n\nDay 3:\n\nDownloads: 3,234\n\nPage reads of book 1(free book): 13,469\n\nAudiobook rank(included for curiosity purposes): 3,486\n\nBest free rank: 31\n\nSales of book 2(99c sale): 43\n\nPage reads of book 2: 14,328\n\nBest paid rank: 2,729\n\nSales of other books in series(3–5): 23\n\nPage reads of other books in series(3–5): 41,763\n\nBook 6 is separated because its sales will be abnormal to the rest of the promo due to being a new release.\n\nSales of book 6: 26\n\nPage reads of book 6: 23,756\n\nBest paid rank: 1,187\n\nDay 4:\n\nDownloads: 2,265\n\nPage reads of book 1(free book): 11,557\n\nAudiobook rank(included for curiosity purposes): 1,922\n\nBest free rank: 30\n\nSales of book 2(99c sale): 31\n\nPage reads of book 2: 11,383\n\nBest paid rank: 2,999\n\nSales of other books in series(3–5): 18\n\nPage reads of other books in series(3–5): 34,226\n\nBook 6 is separated because its sales will be abnormal to the rest of the promo due to being a new release.\n\nSales of book 6: 16\n\nPage reads of book 6: 21,273\n\nBest paid rank: 1,740\n\nDay 5:\n\nDownloads: 5,983\n\nPage reads of book 1(free book): 11,432\n\nAudiobook rank(included for curiosity purposes): 2,040\n\nBest free rank: 14\n\nSales of book 2(99c sale): 63\n\nPage reads of book 2: 12,161\n\nBest paid rank: 2,175\n\nSales of other books in series(3–5): 39\n\nPage reads of other books in series(3–5): 38,214\n\nBook 6 is separated because its sales will be abnormal to the rest of the promo due to being a new release.\n\nSales of book 6: 20\n\nPage reads of book 6: 21,750\n\nBest paid rank: 2,127\n\nGrand Total\n\nDownloads: 17,693\n\nPage reads(book 1): 63,425\n\nBook 2 sales: 219\n\nBook 2 page reads: 61,930\n\nBooks 3–5 sales: 133\n\nBooks 3–5 page reads:179,330\n\nBook 6 sales: 139\n\nBook 6 page reads: 85,022\n\nPure revenue: $2,543.86\n\nROI*: $793.86 (70% of promo cost)\n\n*ROI is calculated as total revenue minus $350*5(number of days book was free, assuming my established average of $350 earned a day without any promo or ads).
