        "text": "Is it fantasy that takes place in a fantasy city?\n\nfantasy that takes place in a modern city?\n\nfantasy that takes place in a real world city?\n\nFantasy that takes place in what could be the real world with the inclusion of magical and supernatural elements. It used to be more about the city setting, but as the genre has grown and broadened its reach, it isn't so much about city, rural, or even a stretch of countryside as much as it's about a place that could be found on current a real world map.\n\nIs Game of Thrones Urban fantasy? (because it takes place in King's Landing)\n\nHigh fantasy in a completely fictional world.\n\nWhat about Dracula and London?\n\nGothic/Historical horror.\n\nI'm choosing agents to query, and I've got a fantasy book that takes place in a fantasy city during the 1800s, is that Urban Fantasy?\n\nI see some agents that list they don't want \"Urban Fantasy.\" Do they really hate any city setting that much or is it code for something else?\n\nConsidering how the definition has changed, this could come down to the particular agent and their chosen interpretation. The best bet would be to highlight what makes it not Urban Fantasy without actually mentioning the term so the thought isn't put in their mind.\n\nA fantasy city during the 1800's could be Steampunk or Historical or... ???. What sub-genre takes center stage or is the one you want to take it? Frame it that way. If the agent disagrees, then they disagree and they aren't the one you want to be representing you and your story anyway because there is a disconnect between you on your views of your story.\n\nI see the \"Sookie Stackhouse\" novels listed as Urban fantasy, but they take place in a small ruralish town?\n\nSee above explanation and then ask, can Bon Temps, Louisiana be a place on a current real world map? Is it a modern day setting with everyday characters that has magical or supernatural elements added in? It is an example of the more common, broad description of what Urban Fantasy is currently considered compared to the more traditional and original one.\n\nConsidering how the definition has changed, this could come down to the particular agent and their chosen interpretation. The best bet would be to highlight what makes it not Urban Fantasy without actually mentioning the term so the thought isn't put in their mind.\n\nThanks for the info! At least for the agent I was wondering about, I read her \"I want the next...\" and \"Favorite Books...\" and found a fantasy in an urban setting, and a fantasy in a real-world but historical urban setting. So I sent her a query.\n\nI think what's been tripping me up is that the only definitions I find (through google) are from fans of the genre, but there appear to be two views:\n\nTo fans of Urban Fantasy, it means any Fantasy set in a city.\n\nTo haters of Urban Fantasy, it means any Fantasy in a familiar modern day setting.\n\nI found one list of what isn't urban fantasy:\n\nJ.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series, J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, George R.R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire, or C.S. Lewis’s Chronicles of Narnia\n\nBut I've heard that Harry Potter is, and it's not exactly useful information to say the others aren't. I'd like to hear opinions on borderline cases like Rachel Aaron's \"HeartStrikers\" series or Travis Baldree's \"Legends and Lattes.\"\n\nAnyway I think I have a handle on it now. Thank you!"
