This is the urban fantasy list dedicated to kick ass females in more modern/ urban settings. If you liked this list I recommend taking a look at the other, they are both dedicated to great fantasy novels, with strong female protagonists. Some novels may have more romance than others, but these are all books I loved with characters that kick butt. If the book is part of a series as many of them are I only included the first in the series though it would be safe to say I loved the entire series.",
