And he had a life so extraordinary, so marked by sudden twists and unexpected reversals, that it reads like something out of one of his picaresque novels. Traversing multiple continents, winning and losing fortunes, falling in love and having his heart broken, Thackeray seems to have written directly from lived experience. The modernity of his works, however, particularly that of his masterpiece Vanity Fair, arises from their ambiguity. We are always looking for the ârealâ Thackeray on the page, seeking certitude in his characters, and facing instead an enigma. Born in Calcutta in 1811, he was the only child of a father who worked for the East India Company, during the height of colonial rule. Shipped home to England at the age of five when his father died, young William supposedly spied Napoleon on a ship along the way. His mother married an officer, a civil engineer whom she had loved before marrying his father, a plot the grown Thackeray would recycle many times. Introduced by his stepfather into the punishing world of English boarding schools, Thackeray later attended Cambridge and Illustration from sheet music for Pas de quatre by Meyer Lutz and Antonin Louis.

Living during the golden age of the magazine and newsprintâan era of fake news and flim-flam, of ad hominem anonymous attacks, of con men, gamblers and financial speculators, of which he was all threeâThackeray wrote for many rags under a number of colorful pseudonyms, including âMr. Michael Angelo Titmarsh,â âFitz- Boodle,â âIkey Solomons,â and âThe Fat Contributor.â In works such as The Yellowplush Papers (1837) and The Luck of Barry Lyndon (1844, adapted by Stanley Kubrick into a 1975 film), he became a virtuosic juggler of incident and innuendo, speedily sketching in seedy characters while addressing the\n\nP:15\n\nreader with a metafictional wink. Vanity Fair was originally published in 19 serialized installments in Punch magazine between 1847 and 1848, much like a prestige TV show would be nowadays. Accompanied by Thackerayâs illustrations, it was subtitled âPen and Pencil Sketches of English Society.â The first work Thackeray published under his own name, Vanity Fair helped to establish his fame and fortune, and much of his posthumous reputation now rests upon it. The novel is a unique innovation Illustration by William Makepeace Thackeray from the original publication of Vanity Fair.

Thackerayâs masterpiece. 14 The wheel goes up, the wheel goes down, and we watch as each character plies their trade at the game of life. As the carousel makes its final spin, between virtue and vice, Thackeray and Hamill seem to be asking, with the same half- smile, which is right and which is wrong? And how much of our own class or gender determines the answer? The answer remains unclear. In this novel of cultivated sensibilities, the wheel of identity never stops turning.\n\nP:17\n\nCOMING TO DCâS LANSBURGH THEATRE APR 24 - MAY 19, 2019 BY LUCAS HNATH DIRECTED BY NICOLE A.
