        "text": "Desmopressin to Prevent Rapid Sodium Correction in Severe Hyponatremia: A Systematic Review.\n\nPubMed\n\nMacMillan, Thomas E; Tang, Terence; Cavalcanti, Rodrigo B\n\n2015-12-01\n\nHyponatremia is common among inpatients and is associated with severe adverse outcomes such as osmotic demyelination syndrome. Current guidelines recommend serum sodium concentration correction targets of no more than 8 mEq/L per day in patients at high risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome. Desmopressin is recommended to control high rates of serum sodium concentration correction in severe hyponatremia. However, recommendations are based on limited data. The objective of this study is to review current strategies for DDAVP use in severe hyponatremia. Systematic literature search of 4 databases of peer-reviewed studies was performed and study quality was appraised. The literature search identified 17 observational studies with 80 patients. We found 3 strategies for desmopressin administration in hyponatremia: 1) proactive, where desmopressin is administered early based on initial serum sodium concentration; 2) reactive, where desmopressin is administered based on changes in serum sodium concentration or urine output; 3) rescue, where desmopressin is administered after serum sodium correction targets are exceeded or when osmotic demyelination appears imminent. A proactive strategy of desmopressin administration with hypertonic saline was associated with lower incidence of exceeding serum sodium concentration correction targets, although this evidence is derived from a small case series. Three distinct strategies for desmopressin administration are described in the literature. Limitations in study design and sample size prevent definitive conclusions about the optimal strategy for desmopressin administration to correct hyponatremia. There is a pressing need for better quality research to guide clinicians in managing severe hyponatremia. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

A 35-year-old female inpatient with an optic chiasm glioma and ventriculoperitoneal shunt for hydrocephalus developed acute hyponatremia (sodium 122 mEq/l) perhaps coinciding with haloperidol treatment. The sum of her urinary sodium and potassium concentrations was markedly hypertonic vis-Ã -vis plasma; it was inferred that serum sodium concentration would continue to fall even in the complete absence of fluid intake. Intravenous (i.v.) 3% NaCl was recommended; however, a city-wide public health emergency precluded her transfer to the ICU. She was treated with hourly oral NaCl tablets in a dose calculated to deliver the equivalent of 0.5 ml/kg/h of 3% NaCl with an objective of increasing the serum sodium concentration by 6 mEq/l. She experienced a graded and predictable increase in serum sodium concentration. A slight overshoot to 129 mEq/l was rapidly corrected with 0.25 l of D5W, and she stabilized at 127 mEq/l. We conclude that hourly oral NaCl, in conjunction with careful monitoring of the serum sodium concentration, may provide an attractive alternative to i.v. 3% NaCl for selected patients with severe hyponatremia.\n\nIncidence of Hyponatremia with High-Dose Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole Exposure.\n\nPubMed\n\nTsapepas, Demetra; Chiles, Mariana; Babayev, Revekka; Rao, Maya K; Jaitly, Manasvi; Salerno, David; Mohan, Sumit\n\n2016-12-01\n\nTrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is a commonly prescribed antibiotic used at high doses for treatment of pneumocystis pneumonia and other infections. Trimethoprim is structurally related to the potassium-sparing diuretic amiloride and has been associated with hyperkalemia and hyponatremia through blocking of epithelial sodium channels in the distal nephron. The incidence of hyponatremia in hospitalized patients treated with high-dose TMP-SMX is unknown. We performed a single-center retrospective chart review of all hospitalized patients who received high-dose TMP-SMX (nÂ = 235) from January 2012 to July 2014. Patients with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , baseline hyponatremia, and those on other medications associated with hyponatremia were excluded. Hyponatremia was defined as a serum sodium level <136 mEq/L. Analysis was restricted to 76 unique patients who received more than 8 mg/kg/d of TMP for â¥3Â days. Mean starting serum sodium at time of TMP-SMX initiation was 138.4 Â± 2.1 mEq/L. Fifty-five patients (72.3%) developed hyponatremia while on therapy, of which 43.6% (nÂ = 24) were cases of serum sodium <130 mEq/L. Mean sodium at the time of nadir was 131.6 Â± 5.1 mEq/L. Hyponatremia was noted, on average, 5.5 days after initiation of therapy, with more severe hyponatremia development among African American patients. Urine sodium concentrations were available for 40.0% (22/55) of incident hyponatremia cases, with mean urinary sodium of 104.8 Â± 55.9 mEq/L. Hyponatremia often resolved within 3 weeks of drug discontinuation. There is a high incidence (72.3%) of hyponatremia associated with the use of high-dose TMP-SMX among hospitalized patients. This is an overlooked and potentially reversible cause of hyponatremia. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, the preoperative over-secretion of cortisol or the postoperative administration of excessive glucocorticoids can cause âsecondaryâ adrenal insufficiency, in which the prevalence of hyponatremia is usually lower than that of primary adrenal insufficiency. Case Report: A 60-year-old woman with a past medical history of Cushingâs syndrome developed hyponatremia with symptoms of acute glucocorticoid deficiency, such as prolonged general fatigue and anorexia, after upper respiratory tract infection. A decrease in the serum cortisol level and the lack of increase in the ACTH level, despite the increased demand for cortisol, enabled a diagnosis of âsecondaryâ adrenal insufficiency. Although the initial fluid replacement therapy was not effective, co-administration of dexamethasone and sodium chloride quickly resolved her symptoms and ameliorated the refractory hyponatremia. Conclusions: In this case, the hypothalamic-pituitary axis of the patient was thought to have become suppressed long after the surgical treatment for Cushingâs syndrome. This case suggested a mechanism of refractory hyponatremia caused by secondary adrenal insufficiency, for which the administration of dexamethasone and sodium chloride exerted additional therapeutic efficacy. PMID:26319655\n\nThe risk of hyponatremia with desmopressin use for nocturnal polyuria.\n\nPubMed\n\nChoi, Eun Young; Park, Joon-Sung; Kim, Yong Tae; Park, Sung Yul; Kim, Gheun-Ho\n\n2015-01-01\n\nDesmopressin is used for treating nocturnal polyuria, but hyponatremia is an associated concern in the elderly due to impaired urinary dilution. This study was undertaken to characterize hyponatremia occurring in adults using desmopressin for nocturnal polyuria. Data from 172 patients who were prescribed desmopressin for nocturnal polyuria at a urology clinic from September 2010 through February 2013 were retrospectively analyzed. Demographic and laboratory parameters were investigated to examine the risk factors for desmopressin-associated hyponatremia. The average follow-up serum sodium measured 21 Â± 22 days after using desmopressin was 138 Â± 5 mmol/l. Hyponatremia (<135 mmol/l) was found in 24 patients (14%), and it was severe in 7 (<126 mmol/l). In the hyponatremic patients, serum sodium decreased by 11 Â± 6 mmol/l. Patients with hyponatremia were older than those with normonatremia (78 Â± 7 vs. 68 Â± 9 years, p < 0.0001). The presence of either hyponatremia-predisposing comorbidities or concurrent medications was associated with hyponatremia. Patients with hyponatremia had lower basal hemoglobin (11 Â± 2 vs. 13 Â± 2 g/dl, p < 0.001) and serum sodium (139 Â± 2 vs. 140 Â± 2 mmol/l, p < 0.05) than those with normonatremia. Multivariate logistic regression after adjustment for basal serum sodium showed that advanced age (OR 1.15; 95% CI 1.03-1.27) and lower hemoglobin level (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.43-0.94) were independently associated with hyponatremia. Hyponatremia is not infrequently associated with desmopressin use. Those with advanced age (â¥65 years) and lower hemoglobin are at risk of desmopressin-associated hyponatremia and need to be carefully monitored. Â© 2015 S.

Besides the well known neurological symptoms, gait disturbances, falls, fractures and osteoporosis have also been described recently in patients with chronic hyponatremia. Acute hyponatremia is a more dramatic situation and needs rapid action when severe neurological symptoms are present. Hypertonic saline is recommended to treat this condition until relief of severe symptoms. The causes of hyponatremia have to be carefully examined. Especially diuretics, antidepressants and endocrine causes, e.g. hypothyroidism, hypocortisolism and hypoaldosteronism should be excluded by examination of the patient history, clinical examination and by laboratory tests. Patients should be classified as being euvolemic, hypovolemic or hypervolemic. Whereas acute hyponatremia with severe symptom should be treated with hypertonic saline, euvolemic hyponatremia due to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) with mild and moderate symptoms can now be treated with tolvaptan, a selective V(2)-vasopressin antagonist. Oral tolvaptan has been shown to be an effective and potent aquaretic to treat hyponatremia caused by SIADH as evidenced by a simultaneous increase in serum sodium and a decrease in urine osmolality. The condition of patients with mild or moderate hyponatremia is also improved. Side effects associated with tolvaptan include increased thirst, dry mouth, polyuria and hypernatremia. Rapid increases in serum sodium should be avoided by close monitoring in a hospital setting.\n\nPrognostic consequences of borderline dysnatremia: pay attention to minimal serum sodium change.\n\nPubMed\n\nDarmon, Michael; Diconne, Eric; Souweine, Bertrand; Ruckly, StÃ©phane; Adrie, Christophe; Azoulay, Elie; Clec'h, Christophe; Garrouste-Orgeas, MaÃ¯tÃ©; Schwebel, Carole; Goldgran-Toledano, Dany; Khallel, Hatem; Dumenil, Anne-Sylvie; Jamali, Samir; Cheval, Christine; Allaouchiche, Bernard; Zeni, Fabrice; Timsit, Jean-FranÃ§ois\n\n2013-01-21\n\nTo assess the prevalence of dysnatremia, including borderline changes in serum sodium concentration, and to estimate the impact of these dysnatremia on mortality after adjustment for confounders. Observational study on a prospective database fed by 13 intensive care units (ICUs). Unselected patients with ICU stay longer than 48 h were enrolled over a 14-year period were included in this study. Mild to severe hyponatremia were defined as serum sodium concentration < 135, < 130, and < 125 mmol/L respectively. Mild to severe hypernatremia were defined as serum sodium concentration > 145, > 150, and > 155 mmol/L respectively. Borderline hyponatremia and hypernatremia were defined as serum sodium concentration between 135 and 137 mmol/L or 143 and 145 respectively. A total of 11,125 patients were included in this study. Among these patients, 3,047 (27.4%) had mild to severe hyponatremia at ICU admission, 2,258 (20.3%) had borderline hyponatremia at ICU admission, 1,078 (9.7%) had borderline hypernatremia and 877 (7.9%) had mild to severe hypernatremia. After adjustment for confounder, both moderate and severe hyponatremia (subdistribution hazard ratio (sHR) 1.82, 95% CI 1.002 to 1.395 and 1.27, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.60 respectively) were associated with day-30 mortality. Similarly, mild, moderate and severe hypernatremia (sHR 1.34, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.57; 1.51, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.99; and 2.64, 95% CI 2.00 to 3.81 respectively) were independently associated with day-30 mortality. One-third of critically ill patients had a mild to moderate dysnatremia at ICU admission. Dysnatremia, including mild changes in serum sodium concentration, is an independent risk factor for hospital mortality and should not be neglected.\n\nModerate/Severe hyponatremia increases the risk of death among hospitalized Chinese human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nXu, Lijun; Ye, Hanhui; Huang, Fan; Yang, Zongxing; Zhu, Biao; Xu, Yan; Qiu, Yunqing; Li, Lanjuan\n\n2014-01-01\n\nTo evaluate whether the serum sodium concentration is associated with the progression and long-term prognosis of Chinese HIV/AIDS patients. Three hundred and eighty seven hospitalized patients were recruited into this retrospective cohort study. The strata of serum sodium concentration were moderate/severe hyponatremia, mild hyponatremia and normonatremia. Disease progression was estimated using CD4 counts and the WHO clinical stage. Correlation analysis was used to evaluate the serum sodium concentration with disease progression. The Kaplan-Meier method and the Cox proportional hazards model were used to analyze the effect of different serum sodium levels on survival. In this study 206 patients (53.2%) had hyponatremia, including 10.6% patients with moderate/severe hyponatremia and 42.6% with mild hyponatremia. The serum sodium concentration was significantly correlated with the HIV/AIDS progression (P<0.001). During the follow-up, 100 patients (25.6%) died. The cumulative survival rates of HIV/AIDS patients were 47.8% Â± 8.5% in patients with moderate/severe hyponatremia, 59.8% Â± 5.0% with mild hyponatremia and 79.9% Â± 3.4% with normonatremia (log-rank P<0.001). After adjusting for sex, age, WHO stage, CD4 count, hemoglobin and albumin, the relative hazard was 3.5 (95% CI: 1.9-6.5) for patients with moderate/severe hyponatremia (P<0.001), and 1.5 (95% CI: 0.9-2.4) for those with mild hyponatremia (P = 0.161), compared with normonatremic patients. The serum sodium level is closely correlated with the severity of patients. Only moderate/severe hyponatremia affects the prognosis of Chinese HIV/AIDS patients.

PMID:25360785\n\nHyponatremia induced by hyperinsulinemia-euglycemia therapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nBeavers, Jennifer R; Stollings, Joanna L; Rice, Todd W\n\n2017-07-15\n\nA case of symptomatic hyponatremia induced by hyperinsulinemia-euglycemia (HIE) therapy is reported. A 59-year-old, 81.65-kg woman with hypertension, major depressive disorder, and anxiety arrived at a tertiary medical center 1.5 hours after an intentional overdose of oral amlodipine 200 mg, metoprolol tartrate 2,000 mg, and isosorbide mononitrate 1,200 mg. Upon arrival, her pulse was 63 beats/min and blood pressure was 106/56 mm Hg. The patient's blood pressure was refractory to fluids, calcium gluconate, and norepinephrine, resulting in initiation of HIE therapy. She had recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia, which required increases of the dextrose infusion and resulted in the patient receiving a total of 6.9 L of dextrose with free water. Seventeen hours into the hospitalization, the patient became obtunded due to hyponatremia (serum sodium concentration, 121 mmol/L). HIE therapy was discontinued, an infusion of 5% dextrose injection with sodium bicarbonate added was started, and a bolus of 3% sodium chloride was administered. Nine hours after the presentation of hyponatremia, the patient's serum sodium concentration normalized (137 mmol/L), and her symptoms resolved. The patient's blood pressure, pulse, and mental status continued to improve, and the patient was transferred out of the medical intensive care unit 41 hours after her arrival at the hospital. A woman who overdosed on amlodipine, metoprolol tartrate, and isosorbide mononitrate was treated with HIE therapy and developed symptomatic hyponatremia. Hyponatremia resolved after administration of dextrose with sodium bicarbonate infusion and 3% sodium chloride infusion and cessation of HIE therapy.

There is now an emerging literature that suggests that chronic hyponatremia increases the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for both falls and fractures in the elderly. Hyponatremia appears to contribute to falls and fractures by two mechanisms: (i) it produces mild cognitive impairment resulting in unsteady gait and falls and (ii) it directly contributes to osteoporosis and increased bone fragility by inducing increased bone resorption to mobilize sodium. There is debate over the effect of hyponatremia on the production of osteoporosis, as one study found decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and another did not. Should we be screening for low serum sodium in patients with osteoporosis or assessing BMD in patients with hyponatremia? The final answer is yet to come from prospective studies that allocate elderly individuals with mild hyponatremia to receive active treatment or not for hyponatremia and see if this intervention prevents gait disturbances and changes in BMD reducing fracture risk. In the meantime, physicians caring for elderly patients must be aware of the association between hyponatremia and bone problems. As serum sodium is a readily available, simple and affordable biochemical measurement, clinicians should look for hyponatremia in elderly patients who take medications that can cause hyponatremia. Also, elderly patients with unsteady gait and/or confusion should be checked for the presence of mild hyponatremia and if present it should not be ignored. Finally, elderly patients presenting with an orthopedic injury should have serum sodium checked and corrected if hyponatremia is present.

We identified from the hospital database, 363 inpatients of a Swedish County hospital who between March 2003 and August 2006 were found to have serum sodium levels <125 mM. Medical records were reviewed and we identified 11 patients with seizures in conjunction with their hyponatremia. Seizures were the only neurologic manifestation of hyponatremia in patients with serum sodium levels >115 mM. Of 150 patients reviewed with serum sodium levels of 120-124 mM, one had a seizure. Using 120-124 mM as reference, odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for having seizures at serum sodium levels of 115-119 mM was 3.85 (0.40-37.53), 8.43 (0.859-82.85) at 110-114 mM, and 18.06 (1.96-166.86) at <110 mM.

We collected data on serum sodium levels in people with epilepsy who were attending a tertiary epilepsy center while on treatment with CBZ or OXC. We defined hyponatremia as Na+ â¤134 mEq/L and severe hyponatremia as Na+ â¤128 mEq/L. We identified 1,782 people who had used CBZ (n = 1,424) or OXC (n = 358), of whom 50 were treated with both drugs. Data on sodium level measurements were available in 1,132 on CBZ and in 289 on OXC. Hyponatremia occurred in 26% of those taking CBZ and 46% of those taking OXC. This was severe in 7% in the CBZ group and 22% in the OXC group. Hyponatremia was symptomatic in 48% and led to admissions in 3%. Age over 40 years, high serum levels of CBZ and OXC, and concomitant use of other antiepileptic drugs were the main risk factors for hyponatremia in both treatment groups. Female patients on OXC were at a higher risk than male patients of hyponatremia. The risk of hyponatremia on CBZ was significantly associated with the risk of hyponatremia on OXC within a subgroup that used both drugs consecutively. Hyponatremia is a common problem in people taking CBZ or OXC. Regular ascertainment of sodium levels in those taking either drug is recommended and results should be acted on. Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The reported incidence of hyponatremia varies widely in literature reports, and there is continuing difficulty in clearly differentiating between the 2 common causes of hyponatremia with natriuresis: the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) and cerebral salt wasting (CSW). We encounter hyponatremia frequently in our practice, and we therefore decided to review data from our center to estimate the incidence of hyponatremia and the results of our management strategies, and attempt to formulate simple guidelines for the correction of hyponatremia in TBI. A retrospective analysis of 1500 consecutively admitted patients with TBI was performed by the use of electronic records and radiographic review. Hyponatremia was defined as serum sodium <135 mEq/L, and natriuresis as a urine spot sodium of more than >40 mEq/L. The incidence of TBI, its management, and the effect of fludrocortisone were evaluated. The incidence of hyponatremia was 13.2%. Early therapy with fludrocortisone significantly reduced the duration of hospital stay (P < 0.05). Traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage was the most common abnormality on the admission computed tomographic scan in patients who experienced hyponatremia. Early initiation of fludrocortisone in the setting of hyponatremia with natriuresis decreases the hospital stay. This protocol is probably safer in a tropical country where fluid restriction might be harmful. It also eliminates the need to differentiate between SIADH and CSW. Copyright Â© 2017.

Reports of severe hyponatremia as a presenting manifestation of a craniopharyngioma and hyponatremia-induced myopathy are rare. We report the case of a patient with craniopharyngioma presenting with severe hyponatremia, panhypopituitarism, and hyponatremia-induced myopathy. A 52-year-old Sri Lankan man presented with anorexia, nausea, fatigue, generalized muscle weakness, and cramps for 1 week. The onset of his illness had been preceded by vomiting and diarrhea for 1 day which he attributed to food poisoning. On examination, he had an apathetic disposition with a generalized \"sallow complexion.\" He was not dehydrated. Apart from reduced muscle power (4/5) and hyporeflexia, the neurological examination was normal. His serum sodium was 102 mmol/l; potassium 4.1 mmol/l; chloride 63 mmol/l; plasma osmolality 272 mosm/KgH 2 O; urine osmolality 642 mosm/KgH 2 O; and urine sodium 79 mmol/l. His creatine phosphokinase was 12,400 U/l, lactate dehydrogenase 628 U/l, aspartate aminotransferase 360 U/l, and alanine aminotransferase 64 U/l. His hormone profile revealed panhypopituitarism. An electromyogram showed nonspecific abnormalities while a muscle biopsy did not show any pathology. Magnetic resonance imaging of his brain demonstrated a well-defined craniopharyngioma with suprasellar extension. His pituitary gland was compressed and the pituitary stalk was displaced by the tumor. He had marked improvement in muscle power and rapid reduction of serum creatine phosphokinase levels paralleling the correction of severe hyponatremia, even before the initiation of hormone replacement. This case illustrates the rare presentation of severe hyponatremia and hyponatremia-induced myopathy in patients with craniopharyngioma, awareness of which would facilitate early appropriate investigations and treatment.\n\nRelationship and interaction between serum sodium concentration and portal hemodynamics in patients with cirrhosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nMaruyama, Hitoshi; Kondo, Takayuki; Kiyono, Soichiro; Sekimoto, Tadashi; Takahashi, Masanori; Okugawa, Hidehiro; Yokosuka, Osamu\n\n2015-11-01\n\nTo examine the relationship between hyponatremia and portal hemodynamics and their effect on the prognosis of cirrhosis. Portal hemodynamic parameters measured by Doppler ultrasound and serum sodium concentrations were examined in 153 cirrhosis patients (mean age 62.2âÂ±â12.0 years; median observation period, 34.1âm). Study participants included 16 patients with hyponatremia (Naâ<â135âmEq/L), who showed a significantly greater frequency of possessing a splenorenal shunt (SRS; Pâ=â0.0068), and 137 patients without hyponatremia. Serum sodium concentrations were significantly lower in patients with SRS than in those without (Pâ=â0.0193). An increased prothrombin time-international normalized ratio was a significant predictive factor for developing hyponatremia a year later (8/96; Hazard ratio 14.415; Pâ=â0.028). The cumulative survival rate was significantly lower in patients with hyponatremia (46.7% at 1 and 3 years) than in those without (91.8% at 1 year, 76.8% at 3 years; Pâ<â0.001). The cumulative survival rate was significantly lower in patients who had developed hyponatremia after 1 year (100% at 1 year, 62.5% at 3 years) than those who had not (100% at 1 year, 89.0% at 3 years; Pâ<â0.001). The cumulative survival rate was significantly worse in patients with both hyponatremia and SRS (20% at 1 year). There was a close linkage between the serum sodium concentration and portal hemodynamic abnormality, presence of SRS, and their interaction may negatively influence the prognoses in cirrhosis.

The aim of this short review is the presentation of the mechanisms of hyponatremia and of the available data regarding its implications and treatment in patients with hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism is one of the causes of hyponatremia, thus thyroid-stimulating hormone determination is mandatory during the evaluation of patients with reduced serum sodium levels. The main mechanism for the development of hyponatremia in patients with chronic hypothyroidism is the decreased capacity of free water excretion due to elevated antidiuretic hormone levels, which are mainly attributed to the hypothyroidism-induced decrease in cardiac output. However, recent data suggest that the hypothyroidism-induced hyponatremia is rather rare and probably occurs only in severe hypothyroidism and myxedema. Other possible causes and superimposed factors of hyponatremia (e.g. drugs, infections, adrenal insufficiency) should be considered in patients with mild/moderate hypothyroidism. Treatment of hypothyroidism and fluid restriction are usually adequate for the management of mild hyponatremia in patients with hypothyroidism. Patients with possible hyponatremic encephalopathy should be urgently treated according to current guidelines. Severe hypothyroidism may be the cause of hyponatremia. All hypothyroid patients with low serum sodium levels should be evaluated for other causes and superimposed factors of hyponatremia and treated accordingly.

Classic cases were described in alcoholics as beer potomania, which is characterized by hyponatremia in the setting of low-solute intake due to heavy beer drinking. We report a case of low-solute hyponatremia in a nonalcoholic person who was given a solute load, and, subsequently, had excessive diuresis with the resultant rapid increase in serum sodium concentration.\n\nCorrelation of hyponatremia with hepatic encephalopathy and severity of liver disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nQureshi, Muhammad Omar; Khokhar, Nasir; Saleem, Atif; Niazi, Tariq Khan\n\n2014-02-01\n\nTo assess the frequency of low serum sodium levels and to correlate it with the severity of liver disease and hepatic encephalopathy (HE) in patients coming to the tertiary care hospital. Observational study. Shifa International Hospital, Islamabad, from January 2011 to January 2012. A total of 202 patients with hepatic encephalopathy and chronic liver disease had serum sodium measured. The HE was graded according to the West Haven classification (4 grades). Relationship of hyponatremia was correlated with severity grade of encephalopathy using Spearman rank correlation test. Out of 202 patients, 62 (30.7%) patients had serum sodium less than 130 meq/l. Out of 202, HE was present in 69 (34.15%) patients and out of these, 38 had grade III-IV HE and 31 had grade I - II HE. Out of 69 patients with HE 57 had sodium less than 135 (p < 0.001). Hyponatremia was a common feature in patients with cirrhosis and its severity increased with the severity of liver disease. The existence of serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L was associated with greater frequency of hepatic encephalopathy compared with patients with serum sodium concentration > 135 mmol/L.\n\nSevere Hyponatremia Due to Valproic Acid Toxicity.\n\nPubMed\n\nGupta, Ena; Kunjal, Ryan; Cury, James D\n\n2015-09-01\n\nHyponatremia is a very commonly encountered clinical entity with potentially dangerous effects and for which many precipitating factors have been identified. We present a case of valproic acid (VPA) overdose causing profound hyponatremia, with one of the lowest serum sodium levels ever documented in literature. A 54-year-old woman with hypothyroidism, hypertension and bipolar disorder presented with somnolence after intentionally ingesting 7,500 mg VPA. She was drowsy but easily arousable with no hemodynamic compromise and an unremarkable physical exam. There was no clinical suspicion for organic neurological or pulmonary disease, adrenal insufficiency or volume depletion. She was found to have a serum sodium of 99 mEq/L, low plasma osmolality (211 mOsm/kg H2O), and high urine osmolality (115 mOsm/kg H2O). Her urine sodium was 18 mEq/L. She was euthyroid (TSH: 3.06 mIU/L) and compliant with thyroxine replacement. She was admitted to the intensive care unit for close monitoring and VPA was withheld. Over 36 hours her VPA level fell from 59.3 mg/L to 22.8 mg/L, serum sodium steadily rose to 125 mEq/L and there was concomitant improvement in her mental status. At 72 hours, she was transferred for an inpatient psychiatric evaluation and her sodium level was 135 mEq/L. She luckily did not experience any seizures or decline in neurological function. The clinical presentation in this patient is consistent with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) leading to a dramatic fall in sodium to a level of 99 mEq/L. Chronic VPA use has been associated with SIADH and chronic hyponatremia. Review of records in this patient from 1 year prior revealed that her last measured sodium level was 127 mEq/L. It is therefore most likely that our case is one of acute on chronic hyponatremia provoked by VPA overdose in the setting of chronic VPA use. Whilst our patient's course was relatively benign, this case illustrates a rare consequence of VPA toxicity, which\n\nHyponatremia in distance runners: fluid and sodium balance during exercise.\n\nPubMed\n\nNoakes, Tim\n\n2002-08-01\n\nSince its first description in 1985, two opposing theories have evolved to explain the etiology of symptomatic hyponatremia of exercise. The first holds that the condition occurs only in athletes who lose both water and sodium during exercise, and fail to fully replace their sodium losses. The second theory holds that the symptomatic form of this condition occurs in athletes who generate a whole body fluid overload as a result of an excessive fluid intake during prolonged exercise. It is argued that the promotion of the idea that athletes should drink as much as possible during exercise has produced, rather than prevented, the recent increase in the incidence of this condition. A series of case reports and laboratory studies reported in the past 2 years have established that it is a whole body fluid overload, resulting from sustained high rates of fluid intake, that causes the symptomatic hyponatremia of exercise. There is no evidence that, in the absence of fluid overload, the usual sodium deficits generated during exercise can cause this condition. These findings confirm that the potentially fatal condition of symptomatic hyponatremia would be eliminated from sport immediately if all athletes were advised of the dangers of ingesting as much fluid as possible during any exercise that lasts more than 4 hours.\n\nDehydration, Hypernatremia, and Hyponatremia.\n\nPubMed\n\nMorley, John E\n\n2015-08-01\n\nDisturbances of serum sodium are one of the most common findings in older persons. They are also a major cause of hospital admissions and delirium and are associated with frailty, falls, and hip fractures. Both hypernatremia and hyponatremia are potentially preventable. Treatment involves treating the underlying cause and restoring sodium and volume status to normal. The arginine vasopressin antagonists, vaptans, have increased the therapeutic armamentarium available to physicians. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In a hospital with a focus on geriatric fall prevention, we sought to characterize this population to develop targeted interventions. As mild hyponatremia, defined as a serum sodium <135meq/L, has been reported to be associated with falls, unsteadiness and attention deficits, we hypothesized that hyponatremia is associated with falls in our geriatric trauma population. Gender, age, pre-existing conditions (cardiac disease, diabetes, hematologic disorder, liver disease, malignancy, musculoskeletal disorder, neurological disorder, obesity, psychiatric disorder, pulmonary disease, renal disease, thyroid disease), mechanism of injury and admitting serum sodium level were queried for all geriatric trauma admissions from 2008 to 2011. Mechanism of injury was coded as falls admissions and non-falls admissions. Admitting serum sodium levels were coded as hyponatremic (<135mmol/L) and not hyponatremic (â¥135mmol/L). Of the 2370 geriatric trauma admissions during the study period, there were 1841 (77.7%) falls admissions and 293 (12.4%) patients who were hyponatremic. Gender, age, neurological disorder, hematologic disorder, and hyponatremia were found to be significant predictors of falls in both univariate and multivariable analyses. Hyponatremic patients are significantly more likely to be admitted for a fall than non-hyponatremic patients, when adjusting for age, neurological disorder, and hematologic disorder. Consequently, hyponatremia identification and management should be an integral part of any geriatric trauma fall prevention programme. Additionally, if hyponatremia is found during a geriatric fall workup, it should be corrected prior to discharge and closely monitored by a primary care physician to prevent recurrent episodes of falls.

Cross-sectional study (March 2007-April 2009) with prospectively collected data. Patients were older than 60 years, used antidepressants, and had a complete geriatric assessment. Serum sodium and antidiuretic hormone levels, serum osmolality, urine sodium level, and urine osmolality were measured. The prevalence of hyponatremia (serum sodium <135 mM) as an adverse reaction to an antidepressant (AR-AD), defined with Naranjo's algorithm, was calculated. Hyponatremic patients were compared to normonatremic patients with regard to gender, age, weight, history of hyponatremia, hyponatremia-associated medications and disorders, and type and duration of antidepressant use. Of 358 eligible patients, 345 were included. The prevalence of hyponatremia as an AR-AD was 9.3%. Risk factors were a history of hyponatremia (adjusted OR 11.17, 95%CI 2.56-40.41), weight<60 kg (adjusted OR 3.47, 95%CI 1.19-10.13), and psychosis (adjusted OR 3.62, 95%CI 1.12-11.73). Non-suppressed ADH was found in a minority of hyponatremic patients. In elderly patients, the prevalence of hyponatremia as adverse reaction to all types of antidepressants was 9%. Patients with previous hyponatremia, weight <60 kg, and psychosis were at risk. Beside SIADH, the nephrogenic syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis, in which ADH secretion was normal, is postulated as an underlying mechanism. This has consequences for treatment of antidepressant-induced hyponatremia with vasopressin receptor antagonists. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

It is based on patient models that integrate the risk associated with clinical variables and bone mineral density (BMD) at the femoral neck. The clinical risk factors included in FRAX were chosen to include only well-established and independent variables related to skeletal fracture risk. The FRAX tool has acquired worldwide acceptance despite having several limitations. FRAX models have not included biochemical derangements in estimation of fracture risk due to the lack of validation in large prospective studies. Recently, there has been an increasing number of studies showing a relationship between hyponatremia and the occurrence of fractures. Hyponatremia is the most frequent electrolyte abnormality measured in the clinic, and serum sodium concentration is a very reproducible, affordable, and readily obtainable measurement. Thus, we think that hyponatremia should be further studied as a biochemical risk factor for skeletal fractures prediction, particularly those at the hip which carries the greatest morbidity and mortality. To achieve this will require the collection of large patient cohorts from diverse geographical locations that include a measure of serum sodium in addition to the other FRAX variables in large numbers, in both sexes, over a wide age range and with wide geographical representation. It would also require the inclusion of data on duration and severity of hyponatremia. Information will be required both on the risk of fracture associated with the occurrence and length of exposure to hyponatremia and to the relationship with the other risk variables included in FRAX and also the independent effect on the occurrence of death which is increased by hyponatremia.\n\nAntidepressant-Induced Hyponatremia in Older Adults.\n\nPubMed\n\nViramontes, Terry S; Truong, Havan; Linnebur, Sunny A\n\n2016-03-01\n\nTo describe the prevalence of hyponatremia in older adults related to antidepressive agents and identify potential alternative options in older adults with a low-baseline serum sodium concentration and/or when a patient has experienced hyponatremia as a result of taking an antidepressant. A PubMed search was conducted on November 10, 2015. Search terms included: antidepressive agents, antidepressive agents second-generation, bupropion, citalopram, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, hyponatremia, milnacipran, mirtazapine, paroxetine, reboxetine, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone, sertraline, trazodone, venlafaxine, and vilazodone. Filters included English language. A search of product labeling was also conducted. Out of 363 results, 124 publications were identified and reviewed along with 11 additional references. Publications were chosen based on relevance to the review: case reports of patients 60 years of age or older or clinical investigations of the association between hyponatremia and antidepressants in older adults. Hyponatremia was counted as an adverse effect if an antidepressant was the likely cause of hyponatremia, and hyponatremia was resolved after withdrawal. Antidepressant-induced hyponatremia in older adults is fairly common. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and mirtazapine were implicated in the majority of the case reports and clinical studies evaluating older adults. Bupropion, trazodone, and tricyclic antidepressants were implicated less often in the same literature. Given its unique mechanism of action, bupropion may be the most appropriate antidepressant for older adults at risk for antidepressant-induced hyponatremia.\n\nSymptomatic hyponatremia in association with a low-iodine diet and levothyroxine withdrawal prior to I131 in patients with metastatic thyroid carcinoma.\n\nPubMed\n\nShakir, Mohamed K M; Krook, Linda S; Schraml, Frank V; Hays, James H; Clyde, Patrick W\n\n2008-07-01\n\nStrategies to improve I131 uptake in thyroid carcinoma include levothyroxine (LT4) withdrawal or thyrotropin (TSH) administration along with a low-iodine diet. We report five patients with papillary or follicular thyroid carcinoma who developed symptomatic hyponatremia during LT4 withdrawal and low-iodine diet. Four patients had pulmonary and/or brain metastases. All had restricted iodine intakes during LT4 withdrawal. Presenting complaints included weakness, dizziness, fainting spells, lethargy, and/or nausea. Baseline serum sodium levels while on LT4 suppression were normal. During presentation all were hypothyroid and serum sodium ranged from 110 to 121 mmol/L (normal 135-148). Despite hyponatremia, the plasma renin activity and serum aldosterone levels were suppressed, indicating volume expansion. The hyponatremia responded to fluid restriction and normalized after LT4 replacement. Low sodium intake, inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion syndrome (SIADH)-like disorder secondary to hypothyroidism and/or lung or cerebral metastases may have contributed to hyponatremia. The development of hyponatremia during LT4 withdrawal and low-iodine diet in otherwise healthy patients with thyroid carcinoma is extremely rare. However, elderly patients with metastatic thyroid carcinoma need observation during LT4 withdrawal combined with a low-iodine diet and should receive instruction to take iodine-free sodium chloride. Free water restriction may be necessary in some patients.\n\nHypothyroidism and Hyponatremia: Rather Coincidence Than Causality.\n\nPubMed\n\nWolf, Peter; BeiglbÃ¶ck, Hannes; Smaijs, Sabina; Wrba, Thomas; Rasoul-Rockenschaub, Susanne; Marculescu, Rodrig; Gessl, Alois; Luger, Anton; Winhofer, Yvonne; Krebs, Michael\n\n2017-05-01\n\nHypothyroidism is referred to be a rare but possible cause of hyponatremia. However, there is only poor evidence supporting this association. Since hyponatremia and hypothyroidism are both common conditions themselves, co-occurrence does not have to be causal. To address a potential relationship, a retrospective analysis of data from the Division of Endocrinology of the Medical University of Vienna from April 2004 to February 2016 was performed. A total of 8053 hypothyroid patients (48âÂ±â18 years of age; 71% female) with thyrotropin >4.0âÎ¼IU/mL and available blood tests for free thyroxine and sodium (Na + ) within maximalâÂ±âseven days were included and screened for hyponatremia. Patients' records were searched for concomitant disease and medication when Na + concentration was <135âmmol/L. Hyponatremia was present in 448/8053 (5.56%) patients. Analysis of medical history revealed potential alternative causes of hyponatremia in 442/448 (98.88%) patients (i.e., side effects of medication, concomitant underlying disease, or other endocrine disorders). This distribution did not differ between patients suffering from clinical or subclinical hypothyroidism. No case of clinically relevant hyponatremia (Na + < 130âmmol/L), present in 111/448 (24.78%) patients could be attributed only to hypothyroidism. There was a very weak but statistically significant trend toward a positive association between thyroid function and serum Na + levels (Na + /thyrotropin: Râ=â0.022, pâ=â0.046; Na + /free thyroxine: Râ=â-0.047, pâ<â0.001). The results suggest that hypothyroid patients with moderate to severe hyponatremia often have other potential explanations for their low serum Na + concentrations in routine care.\n\nCarbamazepine-Induced Hyponatremia in Patients with Mental Retardation.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nKastner, Ted; And Others\n\n1992-01-01\n\nThis study of 40 patients with mental retardation receiving carbamazepine found hyponatremia in only 5 percent of these patients and found a statistically, but not clinically, significant decrease in serum sodium levels in patients receiving anticonvulsant polytherapy.

However, results from peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients are discordant. We wished to establish whether there was an association between serum sodium and mortality risk in PD patients. â¦ METHODS: We analyzed 3,108 PD patients enrolled at day 90 of renal replacement therapy (RRT) into the UK Renal Registry (UKRR) data base with available serum sodium measurements (in 3 groups: â¤ 137, 138 - 140, â¥ 141 mmol/L) who were then followed up until death or the censoring date (31 December 2012). Analysis used Cox-regression with adjustment for age, sex, year of starting RRT, primary renal disease, serum albumin, smoking, and comorbidities. â¦ RESULTS: Unadjusted mortality rates were 118.6/1,000 person-years (py), 83.4/1,000 py, and 83.5/1,000 py for the lowest, middle, and highest serum sodium tertiles, respectively. After adjustment for covariates, patients in the lowest serum sodium group had almost 50% increased risk of dying compared with those with the highest serum sodium (hazard ratio [HR] 1.49, confidence interval [CI]:1.28 - 1.74), with a graded association between serum sodium and mortality. The association of serum sodium with mortality varied by age (p interaction < 0.001), and whilst this association attenuated after adjustment for confounding variables in the older age groups (55 - 64, and > 65 years), it remained in the younger age group of 18 - 54 years (HR 2.24 [1.36 - 3.70] in the lowest compared with the highest sodium tertile). â¦ CONCLUSIONS: Lower serum sodium concentrations at the start of RRT in PD patients are associated with increased risk of mortality. Whilst this association may well be due to confounding in the older age groups, the persistent strong association between hyponatremia and mortality in the younger age group after adjustment for the available confounders suggests that prospective studies are required to assess\n\nCollapse in the Heat - From Overhydration to the Emergency Room - Three Cases of Exercise-Associated Hyponatremia Associated with Exertional Heat Illness.\n\nPubMed\n\nOh, Robert C; Malave, Bryan; Chaltry, Justin D\n\n2018-03-01\n\nExertional heat illness and exercise-associated hyponatremia continue to be a problem in military and recreational events. Symptoms of hyponatremia can be mistaken for heat exhaustion or heat stroke. We describe three cases of symptomatic hyponatremia initially contributed to heat illnesses. The first soldier was a 31-yr-old female who \"took a knee\" at mile 6 of a 12-mile foot march. She had a core temperature of 100.9Â°F, a serum sodium level of 129 mmol/L, and drank approximately 4.5 quarts of water in 2 h. The second case was a 27-yr-old female soldier who collapsed at mile 11 of a 12-mile march. Her core temperature was 102.9Â°F and sodium level was 131 mmol/L. She drank 5 quarts in 2.5 h. The third soldier was a 27-yr-old male who developed nausea and vomiting while conducting an outdoor training event. His core temperature was 98.7Â°F and sodium level was 125 mmol/L. He drank 6 quarts in 2 h to combat symptoms of heat. All the three cases developed symptomatic hyponatremia by overconsumption of fluids during events lasting less than 3 h. Obtaining point-of-care serum sodium may improve recognition of hyponatremia and guide management for the patient with suspected heat illness and hyponatremia. Depending on severity of symptoms, exercise-associated hyponatremia can be managed by fluid restriction, oral hypertonic broth, or with intravenous 3% saline. Utilizing an ad libitum approach or limiting fluid availability during field or recreational events of up to 3 h may prevent symptomatic hyponatremia while limiting significant dehydration.\n\n[Clinical experience of supplying sodium chloride for the treatment of patients with severe heart failure].\n\nPubMed\n\nHe, Li-xia; Sun, Lu-lu; Yang, Yue-jin; Zhang, Jian; Zhang, Yu-hui; Song, Wei-hua; Huang, Yan; LÃ¼, Rong; Ji, Shi-ming\n\n2012-09-01\n\nTo observe the effect and safety of supplying sodium chloride in the treatment of patients with severe heart failure. Consecutive 51 hospitalized patients with severe heart failure and cardiac edema were included in this study. Normal diet (6 g NaCl/d) was supplied to all patients. On the basis of controlling fluid intake and treating related etiological factors as well as standard medications including furosemide for severe heart failure, patients with mild hyponatremia (serum sodium level 130 - 134 mmol/L) ate additional salted vegetables, patients with moderate hyponatremia (serum sodium level 125 - 129 mmol/L) and severe hyponatremia (serum sodium level < 125 mmol/L) ate additional salted vegetables and were received additionally intravenous 3%NaCl hypertonic saline infusion (10 ml/h) until reaching normal serum sodium level. On admission, 37.25% (19/51) patients had hyponatremia. During the first two weeks hospitalization period, 88.24% (45/51) patients were treated with intravenous diuretics and total incidence of hyponatremia was 64.71% (33/51), mild hyponatremia was 50.98% (26/51), middle and severe hyponatremia was 13.73% (7/51); among them, hyponatremia lasted less than 3 d in 57.58% (19/33) patients and â¥ 3 d in 42.42% (14/33) patients. Heart failure exacerbation and hypernatremia were not observed in patients receiving additional sodium chloride therapy. Hospitalization time was similar among patients with different blood natrium levels [average (16 Â± 12) d]. Fifty out of 51 (98%) patients discharged from the hospital with improved heart failure symptoms and signs. Supplying additional sodium chloride could rapid correct hyponatremia in heart failure patients with or without intravenous diuretics therapy which might contribute to a favorable prognosis in hospitalized heart failure patients.\n\nHyponatremia is Associated with Fluid Imbalance and Adverse Renal Outcome in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients Treated with Diuretics.\n\nPubMed\n\nLim, Lee Moay; Tsai, Ni-Chin; Lin, Ming-Yen; Hwang, Daw-Yang; Lin, Hugo You-Hsien; Lee, Jia-Jung; Hwang, Shang-Jyh; Hung, Chi-Chih; Chen, Hung-Chun\n\n2016-11-14\n\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) is frequently complicated with hyponatremia, probably because of fluid overload or diuretic usage.

We found that diuretic users had worse clinical outcomes compared with diuretic non-users. Hyponatremia (serum sodium <135âmEq/L) was associated with excessive volume and volume depletion, measured as total body water by bioimpedance analysis, in diuretic users, but not in diuretic non-users.

Hyponatremia (serum sodium <135âmEq/L) was associated with excessive volume and volume depletion, measured as total body water by bioimpedance analysis, in diuretic users, but not in diuretic non-users. Furthermore, in Cox survival analysis, hyponatremia was associated with an increased risk for renal replacement therapy (hazard ratio, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.13â1.85, Pâ<â0.05) in diuretic users, but not in diuretic non-users (P for interaction <0.05); restricted cubic spline model also showed a similar result. Hyponatremia was not associated with all-cause mortality or cardiovascular event whereas hypernatremia (serum sodium >141âmEq/L) was associated with an increased risk for all-cause mortality. Thus, hyponatremia is an indicator of fluid imbalance and also a prognostic factor for renal replacement therapy in CKD patients treated with diuretics.

This study was conducted to estimate the serum sodium level among local marathon runners and to identify the associated risk factors of dysnatremia. Prospective observational cohort study. Hong Kong Marathon 2008. Subjects were approached at their convenience to participate in the study. Only full-marathon runners were recruited. They were to have had an unremarkable medical and drug history. Demographic data, training information, previous marathon experience, anticipated drinking strategy, details of fluid consumption throughout the race, weight change, finishing time, and physical complaint. Post-race serum sodium level. Of the 6488 entries to the race, 370 runners (5.7%) were recruited. Among them, 272 (73.5%) completed the race and attended for blood sampling and data collection. One runner (0.4%) had hyponatremia (133 mmol/L) and 35 runners (12.9%) had hypernatremia (>145 mmol/L), whereas 236 runners (86.7%) had normal serum sodium (135-145 mmol/L) after the race. No symptomatic dysnatremia was found. A mean weight reduction of 0.70 kg was found after the race. An average of 1.9 L of fluid was consumed during the race and 2.5 L if the fluid consumed immediately before and after the race was also included. Hypernatremia was seen in runners who were better trained before the race, those who performed better, and those who drank less water after the race. This is the largest prospective observational cohort study of dysnatremia conducted on athletes completing a standard marathon in Asia. No case of symptomatic dysnatremia was found.\n\n[Hyponatremia in ultraendurance exercises. Effects on health and performance].\n\nPubMed\n\nOrtega Porcel, Francisco B; Ruiz Ruiz, Jonatan; Castillo GarzÃ³n, Manuel J; GutiÃ©rrez Sainz, Angel\n\n2004-06-01\n\nDehydration is one of the main problems associated to endurance sports. In order to avoid the negative effects of dehydration athletes tend to drink well above their current needs. The negative effect of drinking too much fluid is hyponatremia. Hyponatremia is defined as a plasma sodium concentration lower than 135 mmol/L. Hyponatremia is the first cause of severe illness in ultraendurance sports and has been associated with sudden death. In this article, we analyze the causes, consequences, associated factors, therapeutic treatment and prevention of ultraendurance sports-associated hyponatremia. It is concluded that an adequate fluid ingestion is the best method to avoid hyponatremia. There is not conclusive data about the amount and necessity of sodium supplementation to avoid hyponatremia. However, it might be that it is not necessary to ingest additional sodium to prevent the development of hyponatremia in athletes who only partially replace their fluid losses during prolonged exercise.\n\nHypothyroidism as a cause of hyponatremia: fact or fiction?\n\nPubMed\n\nSun, Grace E Ching; Pantalone, Kevin M; Hatipoglu, Betul\n\n2012-01-01\n\nTo illustrate that severe primary hypothyroidism alone may not be enough to cause hyponatremia in the otherwise healthy ambulatory patient. A retrospective chart review was conducted using an academic health center enterprise-wide electronic health record to identify 10 patients with primary hypothyroidism and same-day serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), sodium, creatinine, and calculated glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Same-day free triiodothyronine or free thyroxine was also recorded if tested. Patients were included in our case series if they met the following inclusion criteria: TSH level >100 Î¼U/mL and same-day sodium and creatinine levels. All laboratory tests were collected on an outpatient basis. The 10 subjects (2 men and 8 women) were ages 19 to 97 years (median, 51.5 years). Median TSH was 193 Î¼U/mL (range, 104.2 to 515.6 Î¼U/mL; normal, 0.40 to 5.50 Î¼U/mL) with median sodium of 138 mmol/L (range, 136 to 142 mmol/L; normal, 135 to 146 mmol/L). The lowest sodium was 136 mmol/L with concurrent TSH of 469.7 Î¼U/mL, free triiodothyronine of 1.0 pg/mL (normal, 1.8 to 4.6 pg/mL), and free thyroxine of 0.2 ng/dL (normal, 0.7 to 1.8 ng/dL). Median GFR was 67.5 mL/min/1.73 m2 (range, 44 to 114 mL/min/1.73 m2; normal, 90 to 120 mL/min/1.73 m2). In our small series of patients with extreme TSH elevations, none had a serum sodium level below normal (<135 mmol/L), even in the presence of a reduced GFR. Hyponatremia can be a common occurrence in hospitalized and/or chronically ill patients; however, in an otherwise relatively healthy ambulatory patient, hypothyroidism, even when severely undertreated, may be a less clinically relevant cause of hyponatremia.\n\n[Influence of preventive use of vasopressin tannate on diabetes insipidus and serum sodium at the early postoperation of craniopharyngioma].\n\nPubMed\n\nXiong, Tao; Wanggou, Siyi; Li, Xuejun; Liu, Qing; Jiang, Xingjun; Peng, Zefeng; Yuan, Xianrui\n\n2016-10-28\n\nTo explore the influence of preventive use of vasopressin tannate on diabetes insipidus and serum sodium at the early postoperation of craniopharyngioma.â© Methods: The data of 83 patients, who underwent unilateral sub-frontal approach resection of craniopharyngioma between 2010 and 2014 by the same senior neurosurgeon, were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into a vasopressin tannate group (used group) and a control group. The diabetes insipidus and serum sodium changes were compared between the two groups.â© Results: Compared with the control group, the incidence of diabetes insipidus decreased at the early postoperation in the vasopressin tannate group (P<0.05). There was high incidence of diabetes insipidus in patients with pituitary stalk excision and tumor close adhesion to the third ventricle floor at the early postoperation (P<0.05). Under such conditions, the incidence of diabetes insipidus in the vasopressin tannate group was decreased compared with the control group (P<0.05). Postoperative hypernatremia occurred in 37 patients (44.6%), and hyponatremia occurred in 60 patients (72.3%), the average time of the occurrence of hpernatremia and hyponatremia was 1.4 and 3.7 days after surgery. Postoperative high serum sodium and low serum sodium appeared alternately in 19 patients (22.9%). There was significant difference in the serum sodium distribution in the first day after surgery in both groups (P<0.05), and the percent of hpernatremia in the vasopressin tannate group was significantly less than that in the control group (P<0.05).â© Conclusion: Preventive use of vasopressin tannate can effectively reduce diabetes insipidus and hypernatremia incidence at the early postoperative stage after microsurgery for craniopharyngioma.\n\nStudy of brain electrolytes and organic osmolytes during correction of chronic hyponatremia. Implications for the pathogenesis of central pontine myelinolysis.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLien, Y H; Shapiro, J I; Chan, L\n\n1991-01-01\n\nOsmotic injury induced by rapid correction of severe chronic hyponatremia has been implicated in the development of central pontine myelinolysis. Organic osmolytes known previously as \"idiogenic osmoles\" accumulate intracellularly to protect cells from osmotic injury. We investigated the changes of these organic osmolytes as well as electrolytes in the brain during the induction and correction of chronic hyponatremia. Using 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and HPLC, we found that in rats with chronic hyponatremia (3 d, serum sodium = 109 +/- 3 meq/liter), brain concentrations of myoinositol (41%), glycerophosphorylcholine (45%), phosphocreatine/creatine (60%), glutamate (53%), glutamine (45%), and taurine (37%) were all significantly decreased compared with control values (percentage control value shown, all P less than 0.01). The contribution of measured organic osmolytes and electrolytes to the total brain osmolality change was 23 and 72%, respectively. With rapid correction by 5% NaCl infusion, significant brain dehydration and elevation of brain Na and Cl levels above the normal range occurred at 24 h. These changes were not seen with slow correction by water deprivation. Reaccumulation of most organic osmolytes except glycerophosphorylcholine is delayed during the correction of hyponatremia and is independent of the correction rate of serum sodium. It is concluded that: most of the change of brain osmolality in chronic hyponatremia can be accounted by the changes in organic osmolytes and brain electrolytes; and rapid correction of hyponatremia is associated with an overshoot of brain sodium and chloride levels along with a low organic osmolyte level. The high cerebral ion concentrations in the absence of adequate concentrations of organic osmolytes may be relevant to the development of central pontine myelinolysis. PMID:2056123\n\nMaternal and neonatal hyponatremia during labor: a case series.\n\nPubMed\n\nSolomon, Neta; Many, Ariel; Orbach, Rotem; Mandel, Dror; Shinar, Shiri\n\n2018-03-12\n\nHyponatremia during labor and delivery may result in severe maternal and neonatal sequelae. Our aim was to describe the direct effect of hyponatremia in labor on pregnancy outcome. A case series of parturients diagnosed with hyponatremia during labor and their neonates. Clinical presentation, laboratory workup, and maternal and neonatal outcomes are presented. Four parturients and their corresponding six neonates were diagnosed with hyponatremia. Of these, two cases were caused by water intoxication and two were preeclampsia induced. While two were identified due to maternal or neonatal symptoms, two were diagnosed by routine laboratory testing. In all cases, low maternal sodium resulted in similarly low neonatal sodium. Neonatal symptoms included respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), lethargy, and jaundice. Psychogenic drinking during labor and preeclampsia may predispose to maternal hyponatremia, resulting in neonatal hyponatremia. Early recognition and treatment can prevent further maternal deterioration and adverse neonatal sequelae.\n\nOutcomes in Severe Hyponatremia Treated With and Without Desmopressin.\n\nPubMed\n\nMacMillan, Thomas E; Cavalcanti, Rodrigo B\n\n2018-03-01\n\nOvercorrection of plasma sodium in severe hyponatremia is associated with osmotic demyelination syndrome. Desmopressin (DDAVP) can prevent overcorrection of plasma sodium in hyponatremia. The objective of this study was to compare outcomes in hyponatremia according to DDAVP usage. This was a retrospective observational study including all admissions to internal medicine with hyponatremia (plasma sodium concentrationÂ <123Â mEq/L) from 2004 to 2014 at 2 academic hospitals in Toronto, Canada. The primary outcome was safe sodium correction (â¤12Â mEq/L in any 24-hour and â¤18Â mEq/L in any 48-hour period). We identified 1450 admissions with severe hyponatremia; DDAVP was administered in 254 (17.5%). Although DDAVP reduced the rate of change of plasma sodium, fewer patients in the DDAVP group achieved safe correction (174 of 251 [69.3%] vs 970 of 1164 [83.3%]); this result was driven largely by overcorrection occurring before DDAVP administration in the rescue group. Among patients receiving DDAVP, most received it according to a reactive strategy, whereby DDAVP was given after a change in plasma sodium within correction limits (174 of 254 [68.5%]). Suspected osmotic demyelination syndrome was identified in 4 of 1450 admissions (0.28%). There was lower mortality in the DDAVP group (3.9% vs 9.4%), although this is likely affected by confounding. Length of stay in hospital was longer in those who received DDAVP according to a proactive strategy. Although observational, these data support a reactive strategy for using DDAVP in patients at average risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome, as well as a more stringent plasma sodium correction limit of 8Â mEq/L in any 24-hour period for high-risk patients. Further studies are urgently needed on DDAVP use in treating hyponatremia. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This is a study of 55 consecutive kala-azar patients and 20 normal individuals as a control group. Hyponatremia and serum hypo-osmolality were detected in 100% of kala-azar patients. High first morning urine osmolality (750.0 Â± 52.0 vs. 894.5 Â± 30.0mOsm/kg HâO, p < 0.05), and high 24-hour urine osmolality (426.0 Â± 167.0 vs. 514.6 Â± 132.0 mOsm/kg HâO, p < 0.05) demonstrated persistent antidiuretic hormone secretion. Urinary sodium was high (82.3 Â± 44.2 vs.110.3 Â± 34.7 mEq/L, p < 0.05). Low seric uric acid occurred in 61.8% of patients and increased fractional urinary uric acid excretion was detected in 74.5% of them. Increased glomerular filtration rate was present in 25.4% of patients. There was no evidence of extracellular volume depletion. Normal plasma ADH levels were observed in kala-azar patients. No endocrine or renal dysfunction was detected. It is possible that most hyponatremic kala-azar patients present the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion.\n\nTramadol for noncancer pain and the risk of hyponatremia.\n\nPubMed\n\nFournier, Jean-Pascal; Yin, Hui; Nessim, Sharon J; Montastruc, Jean-Louis; Azoulay, Laurent\n\n2015-04-01\n\nCase reports have signaled a possible association between tramadol, a weak opioid analgesic, and hyponatremia. The objective of this study was to determine whether the use of tramadol is associated with an increased risk of hyponatremia, when compared with codeine. Using the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink and Hospital Episodes Statistics database, a population-based cohort of 332,880 patients initiating tramadol or codeine was assembled from 1998 through 2012. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of hospitalization for hyponatremia associated with the use of tramadol, compared with codeine, in the first 30 days after initiation. A similar analysis was conducted within a highly restricted sub-cohort, which additionally excluded patients with any serum sodium level abnormality in the year before cohort entry. All models were adjusted for propensity score quintiles. The incidence rates of hospitalization for hyponatremia were 4.6 (95% CI, 2.4-8.0) and 1.9 (95% CI, 1.4-2.5) per 10,000 person-months for tramadol and codeine users, respectively. In the adjusted model, the use of tramadol was associated with a 2-fold increased risk of hospitalization for hyponatremia, compared with codeine (adjusted HR 2.05; 95% CI, 1.08-3.86). In the highly restricted sub-cohort, the use of tramadol was associated with an over 3-fold increased risk of hospitalization for hyponatremia, compared with codeine (adjusted HR 3.54; 95% CI, 1.32-9.54). In this first population-based study, the use of tramadol was associated with an increased risk of hyponatremia requiring hospitalization. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Study design Informatics-enabled cohort study of all hospitalizations at Lucile Packard Childrenâs Hospital between April 2009 and March 2011. Extraction and analysis of electronic medical record data identified normonatremic hospitalized children who received either hypotonic or isotonic intravenous maintenance fluids upon admission. The primary exposure was the administration of hypotonic maintenance fluids and the primary outcome was the development of hyponatremia (serum sodium < 135 mEq/L). Results 1048 normonatremic children received either hypotonic (n=674) or isotonic (n=374) maintenance fluids upon admission. Hyponatremia developed in 260 (38.6%) children receiving hypotonic fluids and 104 (27.8%) of those receiving isotonic fluids (unadjusted OR 1.63; 95th CI 1.24â2.15, p<0.001). After controlling for intergroup differences and potential confounders, patients receiving hypotonic fluids remained more likely to develop hyponatremia (adjusted OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.03â1.84). Multivariable analysis identified additional factors associated with the development of hyponatremia including surgical admission (adjusted OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.09â1.91), cardiac admitting diagnosis (adjusted OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.34â3.20) and hematology/oncology admitting diagnosis (adjusted OR 2.37, 95% CI 1.74â3.25). Conclusions Hyponatremia was common regardless of maintenance fluid tonicity, however, the administration of hypotonic maintenance fluids, when compared with isotonic fluids, was associated with a greater risk of developing hospital-acquired hyponatremia. Additional clinical characteristics modified the hyponatremic effect of hypotonic fluid, and it is possible that optimal maintenance fluid therapy now requires a more individualized approach.

Objective To investigate the association between hyponatremia and bronchiolitis severity in children hospitalized to the intensive care unit (ICU) for bronchiolitis. Methods We conducted a 16-center, prospective cohort study of hospitalized children age <2 years with bronchiolitis during the winters of 2007 to 2010. We classified patients into two groups: normonatremia (135â145 mEq/L) and hyponatremia (<135 mEq/L) based on the first-measured serum sodium concentration on the day of hospitalization. Outcomes were use of mechanical ventilation and ICU length-of-stay (LOS). To examine the association of sodium status with outcomes, we fit logistic and linear regression models with propensity score adjustment. Results Of 231 children hospitalized to the ICU for bronchiolitis, 193 patients (84%) were categorized into the normonatremia group, and 38 children (16%) into hyponatremia group. Compared to children with normonatremia, those with hyponatremia had higher risks of mechanical ventilation use (40% vs. 58%; P=0.04) and longer ICU LOS (median, 3 days vs. 6 days; P=0.007). Likewise, in the adjusted analyses, children with hyponatremia had significantly higher risks of mechanical ventilation use (OR, 2.14; 95%CI, 1.03â4.48; P=0.04) and longer ICU LOS (Î²-coefficient 2.21 days; 95%CI, 0.68â3.73 days; P=0.003). Conclusions In this prospective, multicenter study of children hospitalized for bronchiolitis, hyponatremia on the day of hospitalization was associated with a higher severity. Our data support hyponatremia as a prognostic factor that might improve the ability of clinicians to predict the disease course of children with severe bronchiolitis.

Prospective observational cohort study. Cradle Mountain Run, Tasmania, Australia, February 2011. Forty-four runners (86% of starters) prospectively enrolled, with 41 runners (80% of starters) eligible for inclusion in final data set. Body weight change, serum sodium concentration change, and hydration plan (according to thirst vs preplanned fluid consumption). There was 1 case of exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) [postrace [Na], 132 mmol/L]. This runner was asymptomatic. There was a strongly significant correlation between the change in serum [Na] and body weight change during the race. There was a significant inverse correlation between serum [Na] and volume of fluid consumed. Change of serum [Na] was not correlated with the proportion of water versus electrolyte drink consumed. Runners drinking to thirst consumed significantly lower average fluid volumes and had higher postrace serum [Na] than those complying with a preplanned hydration protocol (142 mmol/L vs 139 mmol/L). More experienced runners tended to drink to thirst. There was a 2% incidence of EAH in this study. Serum [Na] change during an 85-km mountain run was inversely correlated with the volume of fluid consumed. The results provide further evidence that EAH is a dilutional hyponatremia caused by excessive consumption of hypotonic fluids. Drinking to thirst represents a safe hydration strategy for runners in a wilderness environment. Drinking to thirst during endurance running events should be promoted as a safe hydration practice.\n\nPrevalence, Timing, Causes, and Outcomes of Hyponatremia in Hospitalized Orthopaedic Surgery Patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nHennrikus, Eileen; Ou, George; Kinney, Bradley; Lehman, Erik; Grunfeld, Robert; Wieler, Jane; Damluji, Abdulla; Davis, Charles; Mets, Berend\n\n2015-11-18\n\nHyponatremia is common among orthopaedic patients and is associated with adverse clinical outcomes. We examined the prevalence, timing, causes, and outcomes of hyponatremia in adult hospitalized orthopaedic surgery patients. We evaluated the medical records of 1067 consecutive orthopaedic surgery patients admitted to a tertiary academic institution. The medical records were reviewed to investigate hyponatremia (serum sodium <135 mEq/L) that (1) had been present on hospital admission or (2) had developed postoperatively. The primary outcomes were the prevalence and timing of, and risk factors for, presentation with or development of hyponatremia. Secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay, total hospital cost, and discharge disposition. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the variables associated with hyponatremia and the effects of hyponatremia on clinical outcomes. Of the 1067 patients, seventy-one (7%) had preoperative hyponatremia and 319 (30%) developed hyponatremia postoperatively. Of the latter, 298 (93%) developed hyponatremia within forty-eight hours postoperatively. Compared with patients with normonatremia, those who presented with hyponatremia, on the average, were older (67.2 versus 60.5 years, p < 0.001), had longer hospital stays (4.6 versus 3.3 days, p < 0.001), incurred higher hospital costs ($19,200 versus $17,000, p = 0.006), and were more likely to be discharged to an extended-care facility (odds ratio [OR] = 2.87, p < 0.001). Developing hyponatremia postoperatively resulted, on average, in a longer hospital stay (3.7 versus 3.3 days, p = 0.002) and greater hospital cost ($18,800 versus $17,000, p < 0.001). Age (OR = 1.13 per decade, p = 0.012), spine surgery (OR = 2.76 versus knee, p < 0.001), hip surgery (OR = 1.76 versus knee, p < 0.001), and the amount of lactated Ringer solution used (OR = 1.16, p = 0.002) increased the risk of developing hyponatremia. Hyponatremia in orthopaedic patients is associated with\n\nHyponatremia in Guillain-BarrÃ© Syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nRumalla, Kavelin; Reddy, Adithi Y; Letchuman, Vijay; Mittal, Manoj K\n\n2017-06-01\n\nTo evaluate incidence, risk factors, and in-hospital outcomes associated with hyponatremia in patients hospitalized for Guillain-BarrÃ© Syndrome (GBS). We identified adult patients with GBS in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2002-2011). Univariate and multivariable analyses were used. Among 54,778 patients hospitalized for GBS, the incidence of hyponatremia was 11.8% (compared with 4.0% in non-GBS patients) and increased from 6.9% in 2002 to 13.5% in 2011 (P < 0.0001). Risk factors associated with hyponatremia in multivariable analysis included advanced age, deficiency anemia, alcohol abuse, hypertension, and intravenous immunoglobulin (all P < 0.0001). Hyponatremia was associated with prolonged length of stay (16.07 vs. 10.41, days), increased costs (54,001 vs. 34,125, $USD), and mortality (20.5% vs. 11.6%) (all P < 0.0001). In multivariable analysis, hyponatremia was independently associated with adverse discharge disposition (odds ratio: 2.07, 95% confidence interval, 1.91-2.25, P < 0.0001). Hyponatremia is prevalent in GBS and is detrimental to patient-centered outcomes and health care costs. Sodium levels should be carefully monitored in high-risk patients.\n\nHyponatremia Is Associated With Increased Osteoporosis and Bone Fractures in a Large US Health System Population.\n\nPubMed\n\nUsala, Rachel L; Fernandez, Stephen J; Mete, Mihriye; Cowen, Laura; Shara, Nawar M; Barsony, Julianna; Verbalis, Joseph G\n\n2015-08-01\n\nThe significance of studies suggesting an increased risk of bone fragility fractures with hyponatremia through mechanisms of induced bone loss and increased falls has not been demonstrated in large patient populations with different types of hyponatremia. This matched case-control study evaluated the effect of hyponatremia on osteoporosis and fragility fractures in a patient population of more than 2.9 million. Osteoporosis (n = 30 517) and fragility fracture (n = 46 256) cases from the MedStar Health database were matched on age, sex, race, and patient record length with controls without osteoporosis (n = 30 517) and without fragility fractures (n = 46 256), respectively. Cases without matched controls or serum sodium (Na(+)) data or with Na(+) with a same-day blood glucose greater than 200 mg/dL were excluded. Incidence of diagnosis of osteoporosis and fragility fractures of the upper or lower extremity, pelvis, and vertebrae were the outcome measures. Multivariate conditional logistic regression models demonstrated that hyponatremia was associated with osteoporosis and/or fragility fractures, including chronic [osteoporosis: odds ratio (OR) 3.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.59-4.39; fracture: OR 4.61, 95% CI 4.15-5.11], recent (osteoporosis: OR 3.06, 95% CI 2.81-3.33; fracture: OR 3.05, 95% CI 2.83-3.29), and combined chronic and recent hyponatremia (osteoporosis: OR 12.09, 95% CI 9.34-15.66; fracture: OR 11.21, 95% CI 8.81-14.26). Odds of osteoporosis or fragility fracture increased incrementally with categorical decrease in median serum Na(+). These analyses support the hypothesis that hyponatremia is a risk factor for osteoporosis and fracture. Additional studies are required to evaluate whether correction of hyponatremia will improve patient outcomes.\n\nImproving the diagnostic workup of hyponatremia in the setting of kidney disease: a continuing medical education (CME) initiative.\n\nPubMed\n\nGolestaneh, Ladan; Neugarten, Joel; Southern, William; Kargoli, Faraj; Raff, Amanda\n\n2017-03-01\n\nHyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder and is associated with mortality. We examined the frequency of appropriate testing in response to an episode of inpatient hyponatremia in a large urban hospital to better inform our educational intervention. We then evaluated the impact of a live CME activity with a focus on CKD- and ESRD-associated hyponatremia physiology, on diagnostic practices of audience hospitalist attendings. We performed a retrospective database analysis of all patients admitted to Montefiore Medical Center in 2014 to examine the performance of hospital staff in response to hyponatremia across all CKD stages. We then did a comparative analysis of diagnostic workup orders for hyponatremic patients admitted to audience members of a live CME activity in the 4Â months prior as compared to the 4Â months after the activity. The prevalence of hyponatremia was 27% in a cohort of hospitalized patients: 41% of these hyponatremia inpatients had CKD, and 11.4% had ESRD. Overall less than 10% of patients had orders written for serum and urine osmolality without aÂ differential pattern based on CKD or ESRD diagnosis. Among the patients admitted to the CME audience hospitalists, urine/serum osmolality and urine sodium orders occurred infrequently overall and did not differ after vs. before the lecture. The frequency of appropriate diagnostic orders written in response to an episode of hyponatremia was very low and did not vary based on degree of CKD. A CME activity with an emphasis on the role of CKD/ESRD in diagnostic accuracy did not improve the order quality in a group of audience hospitalists. Efforts to improve the diagnostic workup of hyponatremia with concomitant kidney disease are crucial to proper management of these patients.\n\n[Diuretic treatment in patients with acute pulmonary edema did not produces severe hyponatremia or hypokalemia].\n\nPubMed\n\nKaluÅ¾ay, Jozef; PokornÃ¡, Veronika; BodÃ­kovÃ¡, Svetlana; VahanÄÃ­kovÃ¡, NatÃ¡lia; PonÅ¥uch, Peter\n\n2016-04-01\n\nOne of the risks of diuretic therapy for pulmonary edema is the development of hyponatremia and hypokalemia with pro-arrhythmic potential. The aim of our study was to analyze the incidence of hyponatremia and hypokalemia after the first day of treatment in a real clinical practice. We performed a retrospective analysis of data obtained from medical records. We included all patients with pulmonary edema admitted to the coronary care unit, only patients which died within the first day of treatment were excluded. Absolute dose of administered furosemide, total fluid intake and urine output, saline and pottasium intake were analyzed. Nonparametric paired Wilcoxon test was used to compare natrium and pottasium levels changes. 37 patients were included into analysis. The median dose of furosemide administered during the first day of treatment was 120 mg (IQR 20-300 mg). Median diuresis was 2â¯400 ml (IQR 1â¯425-3â¯225 ml). The median of difference between diuresis and total fluid intake was 315 ml (IQR 538-1â¯380 ml). Wilcoxon test confirmed a prevailing statistically significant trend of slight rise in serum sodium within the first day of treatment (serum sodium 138.0 IQR 132.8-139.6 vs 138.1 IQR 134,0-141,7 mmol/l, p = 0.0046). The difference in serum potassium was not statistically significant (serum potassium 4.2 IQR 3.9-4.8 vs 4.2, IQR 3.8-4.8 mmol/l). Results did not confirmed the need for a substitution of sodium and potassium losses during the first day of diuretic therapy to prevent hyponatriemia and hypokalemia in patients with pulmonary edema.\n\nAn Addison disease revealed with a serious hyponatremia.\n\nPubMed\n\nMaguet, Hadrien; Carreau, AgnÃ¨s; Hautefeuille, Serge; Bonnin, Pierre; Beaune, Gaspard\n\n2017-02-01\n\nWe present the case of an Addison's disease revealed by a serious hyponatremia. The serum concentration of ACTH and 21-hydroxylase antibodies were increased and lead to the diagnosis. The cortisol blood level was lowered but required to take into account the stress induced by the hospitalisation of the patient. Addison's disease is characterized by the destruction of the adrenal cortex. Autoimmune adrenalitis is the main cause of adrenal insufficiency. Treatment involves normalisation of sodium concentration and corticosteroids replacement. With a good patient compliance, the survival rate of Addisonian patient is similar to that of the normal population. Management of patient requires vigilance because of the occurrence of others autoimmunes diseases during patient life.\n\nSerum sodium identifies patients with cirrhosis at high risk of hepatorenal syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nJaniÄko, M; VeselÃ­ny, E; Abraldes, J G; JarÄuÅ¡ka, P\n\n2013-07-01\n\nAlthough the precipitating events of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) development have been well characterized, the actual baseline risk of these events resulting in HRS is much less studied. To assess the predictive value of hyponatremia in the development of HRS. We performed a retrospective observational cohort study including consecutive patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis and normal creatininemia admitted to tertiary center in Slovakia. Patients were censored at two months, development of renal failure, classified either as HRS or renal failure not fulfilling criteria of HRS, was the main outcome. Out of 202 patients 18 developed HRS and 14 renal failure not fulfilling the HRS criteria. A significant difference was found between patients with and without HRS in serum sodium (135.76 Â± 5.01 vs. 130.78 Â± 3.574 mmol/l; p < 0.0001), creatinine, (81 Â± 20.11 vs. 98.18 Â± 25.032 Âµmol/l; p = 0.006), bilirubin (90.4 Â± 104.82 vs.175.42 Â± 174.12 Âµmol/l; p < 0.0001), MELD (15.17 Â± 5.52 vs. 21.61 Â± 6.0; p < 0.0001) and MELD-Na score (19.96 Â± 6.0 vs. 25.89 Â± 4.96; p < 0.0001). Sodium, creatinine, bilirubin, MELD, MELD-Na score were found to be significant predictors of HRS in univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis two prediction models (Model 1: Bilirubin, creatinin, sodium and Model 2: Sodium, MELD) showed that sodium together with creatinine are the strongest HRS predictors, followed by bilirubin or MELD score. Serum levels of sodium, creatinine and parameters of liver function are important predictors of hepatorenal syndrome.

Patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) are at greater risk for osteoporosis as well as for hyponatremia. The aim of the present study was to assess the association between hyponatremia and bone mineral density (BMD) in a large cohort of adolescent inpatients with AN. A historic cohort study of 174 adolescent females (mean age 15.7Â Â±Â 1.8Â y) hospitalized because of AN between 2003 and 2013. Demographic and clinical data, including age, psychiatric comorbidity, anthropometric measurements, laboratory tests, and BMD scores were obtained from the patients' medical charts. Mean lumbar spine BMD z-score of the patients was lower than expected in the normal population (mean -1.5Â Â±Â 1.2) and positively correlated with body mass index standard deviation score (rÂ =Â 0.42, PÂ <Â 0.0001). Sixty-four participants (36.8%) had at least one episode of hyponatremia during the year preceding the BMD measurement. These participants had a significantly lower lumbar spine BMD z-score (-1.8Â Â±Â 1.2 versus -1.3Â Â±Â 1.2, PÂ =Â 0.01) compared with participants with no hyponatremia. Lumbar spine BMD z-score was also positively correlated with the levels of free triiodothyronine (rÂ =Â 0.16, PÂ =Â 0.038), 17 b-estradiol (rÂ =Â 0.23, PÂ =Â 0.005), and luteinizing hormone (rÂ =Â 0.25, PÂ =Â 0.001), and negatively correlated with cortisol levels (rÂ =Â 0.33, PÂ <Â 0.0001). Having at least one episode of hyponatremia, BMI z-score and cortisol levels were identified as independent predictors of BMD z-score (PÂ <Â 0.001, PÂ <Â 0.001, and PÂ =Â 0.034, respectively). Hyponatremia may be associated with decreased bone density in adolescent females with AN. Additional studies are required to evaluate whether the correction of hyponatremia will improve BMD.

The patient, who presented with a body mass index (BMI) of 13.4âkg/m2, was successfully treated by means of an adapted inpatient version of an enhanced form of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT-E). Within a few days, careful water restriction, solute refeeding, and the specific cognitive behavioural strategies and procedures used to address the patient's excessive compulsive exercising and undereating produced a marked reduction in CK levels, which normalised within one week. Exercise-associated hyponatremia also gradually improved, with serum sodium levels returning to normal within two weeks. The patient thereby avoided severe complications such as cerebral or pulmonary oedema or acute renal failure and was discharged after 20 weeks of treatment with a BMI of 19.0âkg/m2 and improved eating disorder psychopathology.
