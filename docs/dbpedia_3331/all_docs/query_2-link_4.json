Link is in the comments! #podcast #podcastingtips #readingbooks\n\nWhat are your favorite self-improvement books? I've never been big into reading books. I always felt like I was too busy with work, the kids, etc to squeeze it in so I just didn't do it. A few years ago, I started using Audible and it has been a game-changer! My commutes used to be dedicated to mind-numbing morning radio shows and music, but now I look forward to that time for self-improvement. Even if it only helps me improve by 1% a week, that compounds into a huge difference in just a matter of weeks / months / years. If you are in the same boat as me, I highly recommend giving it a shot! If you’re looking for suggestions, here are some of my favorite reads so far: Can't Hurt Me / Never Finished - David Goggins Extreme Ownership / Dichotomy of Leadership / Leadership Strategy – Jocko Willink Do Over / All Takes is a Goal (podcast) – Jon Acuff How to Win Friends and Influence People – Dale Carnegie $100M Leads – Alex Hormozi I’d love to hear some of your favorites in the comments so I can add them to my queue!\n\nAre you ready to take part in an extraordinary adventure? Join me in the journey of resilience and growth in my new book, \"The Monsters of Marymount Mansion.\" Perfect for young readers, this enchanting story is a reminder that sometimes, the most unexpected adventures start with a single brave step.
