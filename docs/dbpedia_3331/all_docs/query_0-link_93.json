        "text": "This dissertation examines how relations between different actors in the Egyptian opposition have contributed to the endurance of authoritarianism in Egypt over the past three decades. In this dissertation, I argue that the durability of authoritarianism in Egypt, and elsewhere in the Arab world, is not simply a function of regime strength and cohesion, as the conventional wisdom maintains, but that it is also a function of important divisions and mobilizational asymmetries between different actors in the opposition, particularly between Islamists and non-Islamists. I argue that ideological divisions and mobilizational asymmetries have impeded successful cooperation and alliance building between Islamists and non-Islamists and have thus inhibited broad based mobilization against the authoritarian regime, even during moments of regime crisis. These divisions have also lowered the cost of repression and allowed the authoritarian regime to successfully play off different forces against one another in order to ensure its continued hegemony.\n\nWhat are the cultural dynamics within a congregational system that are vital to the empowering of missional leadership? Do Lutherans have anything to contribute to the missional church movement in the United States? These two questions were primary for this dissertation and emerged out of two gaps identified in the missional church literature. Seeing congregations as complex, open systems, missional leadership within congregational systems was studied using a grounded theory, qualitative research approach. The five ELCA congregational systems in this study were identified by their peers as excelling in helping their faith community discover their calling as disciples of Jesus and empowering them to live their faith in the world. They were studied using primarily the ethnographic methods of field observation, focus groups, and journaling. The particular cultural dynamics of each congregational system were identified first, and then those that were common among them were articulated. These eight common cultural dynamics included: an active view of God, the world as the horizon, discipleship as a way of life, congregational systems as a network of people, the dance of leadership, tension of ministry and mission, a vibrant Lutheran identity, and a changing and adapting posture. From these cultural dynamics, a Lutheran hermeneutic for leading in mission was proposed. Using Craig Van Gelder’s four part hermeneutic, this proposal was shaped around: communicatively discerned, biblically and theologically framed, theoretically informed, and strategic action. The foundation of this hermeneutic of leading in mission was a missional theology, with a missional view of God, church, and ministry tied to a missional, Lutheran understanding of baptism and vocation. To this foundation were added several theoretical perspectives: grounded theory; ethnography; cultural anthropology; complex, open systems theory; and organizational leadership theory. The qualitative, grounded theory research findings, having sought to capture the what and why of the faith communities with a missiological inquiry of discovering God’s intent, were woven throughout. The addition of qualitative research provided the opportunity for the lived experiences of missional congregational systems to speak into the missional church conversation in the United States offering a Lutheran voice, while also keeping theology and theory central.\n\nContemporary science fiction television series, such as Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Voyager, and Babylon Five, fascinate viewers as expressions of popular culture precisely because they update in modern garb the Western attempt to grapple symbolically with the tension between consciousness and the unconscious. More specifically, these series owe much of their power and appeal to their ability to draw from and weave together Christian, Gnostic, and medieval alchemical symbolism. Using Jungian and archetypal perspectives, this dissertation amplifies key symbols of the Self and the shadow within the three previously mentioned series in the interest of gleaning a richer understanding of the contemporary Western psyche--its tensions, its possibilities, and its needs for compensatory balance. The commonalities shared by these three sci-fi television series lead the author to make four observations: (1) It would appear that polytheistic images of the divine are emerging as a symbolic counterweight to monotheism, for all three series under consideration offer images of the divine that are grounded in a corporate or polytheistic symbolism; (2) it would appear that more ambivalent images of the divine are emerging as a counterweight to the split between good and evil characteristic of the historically dominant symbol of the Self within the West; namely, the Christian God-image; (3) through their portrayals of the positive effect that human characters have upon supernatural characters, these three sci-fi television series would seem to validate symbolically the benefits of a strong ego upon the Self’s expression; and (4) it would appear that feminine images are emerging as a counterweight to masculine images of the Self, bringing with them a reminder of the critical importance of embodied awareness and concern for the welfare of the larger group."
