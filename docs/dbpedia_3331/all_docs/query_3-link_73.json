        "text": "The fantasy novel genre has existed for hundreds of years with different subgenres forming from it, one being contemporary fantasy.\n\nContemporary Fantasy Definition\n\nContemporary fantasy is a subgenre of fantasy fiction. The stories are set in the same time period when they are written. So a contemporary fantasy text written in the 21st century would also be set in the 21st century.\n\nThe most important aspect of contemporary fantasy is that it is set in modern times and interacts with fantastical elements. The characters live in the modern day with magical and supernatural elements interwoven into the setting. The magic system or magical creatures are either present in the world or live in an alternate world that interferes with the present world. In other words, magic is either an integral part of normal society or is something present in another world that the protagonist can travel to. Contemporary fantasy fiction can make characters and plots more relatable to the readers.\n\nNotable contemporary fantasy fiction includes C.S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia (1956) and Phillip Pullman’s His Dark Materials (1995–2000).\n\nSub-genres of Contemporary Fantasy\n\nContemporary fantasy fiction is an umbrella category for other subgenres such as the following:\n\nUrban Fantasy: Urban fantasy is also set in the present day but is set explicitly in a densely populated place or current city. We will explore this in more detail later.\n\nRivers of London (2011) by Ben Aaronovitch\n\nMythic Romance: This fantasy takes inspiration from myths and includes elements of romance in the plot.\n\nElsker (2013) by S. T. Bende\n\nNoir Fantasy: This fantasy sub-genre is a form of noir-style crime plot with strong fantastical elements.\n\nJim Butcher’s novel series The Dresden Files (2000–Present)\n\nOther forms of Fantasy Literature\n\nFantasy can be divided into sub-genres as well as different periods.\n\nContemporary fantasy fiction is always set in the modern world and is based in the present time. There are other genres of fantasy literature which are set in different times: Historical Fantasy (past) and Science Fantasy (future).\n\nHistorical Fantasy: This is a subgenre of fantasy fiction set in the past and based on historical research. It includes fantasy elements in the plot. A lot of stories in this genre are set before the twentieth century.\n\nThe Scar-Crow Men by Mark Chadbourn (2011)\n\nAge of Myth by Michael J Sullivan (2016)\n\nScience Fantasy: Science Fantasy fiction can be set in the past or even up to the far future. What makes it distinct from contemporary fantasy is that it doesn’t look like the modern world (an example of a science fantasy would be Star Wars). It can also include scientific elements and fantastical elements in the plot (for example, cyborgs and wizards).\n\nContemporary Fantasy Elements\n\nMythology: Mythology and folklore play a huge role in contemporary fantasy. Writers may also use plotlines and character archetypes from mythology when writing contemporary fantasy.\n\nIn Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief (2005), Rick Riordan incorporates ancient Greek mythology into the fantasy plot\n\nParanormality: In contemporary fantasy, the paranormal is anything that has supernatural or magical elements. This similarity connects contemporary fantasy to traditional fantasy: both explore magical/supernatural elements.\n\nImaginary Settings: Most contemporary fantasy novels include imaginary settings to support the paranormal activities that go on and myths being explored. The society in these settings has its own norms, laws, histories and politics.\n\nContemporary Fantasy Characteristics\n\nFarah Mendlesohn, a writer and British academic historian, states that four characteristics of fantasy include portal-quest, immersive, intrusion and liminal. These four types of characteristics explain how the protagonist will act in the fantasy world.1\n\nThese features are common in the broad genre of fantasy fiction, and contemporary fantasy is no exception to the rule. But the ways these elements manifest are different in contemporary fantasy, as will be explained below.\n\nIn portal fantasies, the character leaves a familiar setting, passes through a portal and enters an unknown destination. These can often become portal and quest fantasies, where the protagonist leaves their ordinary home to fulfil a quest in a new setting, often with the help of a guide.\n\nThe Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1950) by C.S. Lewis\n\nAlice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865) by Lewis Carroll\n\nA Darker Shade of Magic (2015) by V. E. Schwab\n\nIn an immersive fantasy, the characters accept and understand the rules of this fantastical world. To them, these magical or fantastical elements are ordinary, so it is the role of the author to inform the reader of the new fantastical rules and world. The reader relies on the protagonist’s experience (and therefore, the protagonist’s personal beliefs and notions). Immersive fantasies in contemporary fantasies could be set in a modern world that looks a lot like ours, but where magic is normal.\n\nIn intrusion fantasy, the fantastical and magical worlds intrude on the contemporary world. In some sense, it is the reverse of the portal quest, as this time the magical is entering the real world, rather than a character in the real world entering the magical.\n\nFreaky Friday (1972) by Mary Rodgers\n\nTwilight (2005) by Stephenie Meyer\n\nThe liminal fantasy is a type of fantasy where it is ambiguous if the fantasy is something real in the fictional world or if the fantasy is simply just the product of the protagonist's imagination.\n\nGünter Grass's The Tin Drum (1959) could be an example as the unreliable narrator throws into doubt whether the fantastical elements are indeed part of the plot or rather are imagined by the narrator.\n\nContemporary Fantasy vs Urban Fantasy\n\nThe difference between contemporary fantasy and urban fantasy is that urban fantasy is a sub-genre of modern fantasy where the plot primarily happens in a city. It is a type of fantasy that occurs in the real world and deals with issues from modern urban spaces. It can even include characteristics present in thrillers and science fiction and overlaps with other fantasy sub-genres such as high fantasy, dark fantasy, sword and sorcery and epic fantasy.\n\nDrug issues, gang crime, pollution and problems with the police are some examples of what is explored in urban fantasy. Usually, the monsters/creatures are classical romance villains like ghosts, demons, and vampires. These characters are popular as villains and heroes in urban settings as it presents the dark and light side of humanity. For example, vampires look like ordinary people, but they have a thirst for blood. Urban fantasy also often incorporates romance in its stories.\n\nOne of the earliest urban fantasy books was created by C.S Lewis, who brought monsters and wizards to contemporary London in The Magician's Nephew (1955). The story begins with two children (Polly and Diggory) playing in a garden in London; they eventually come across a magic ring that leads them into the world of magic.\n\nContemporary Fantasy: Novels & Books\n\nHere we will take a close look at contemporary fantasy novels and examine how they use certain tropes.\n\nCity of Bones by Cassandra Clare (2007)\n\nThis contemporary fantasy novel is the first in a series called The Mortal Instruments (2007–2014). It is set in modern New York and is an urban fantasy novel.\n\nAdhering to the young protagonist trope, 15-year-old Clary Fray is out at a club when she notices a boy with green eyes and blue hair. She watches as he follows a beautiful girl into a closet with two boys and as they kill the boy with the blue hair. She realises that no one else in the club has noticed the event and thinks she has imagined it.\n\nIt is here when the mythical creatures enter the urban setting, as one of the murderers, Jace, says the boy he killed was a demon and that they were shadowhunters. He also said ordinary people wouldn’t be able to see them. Later, Clary's mother is captured. Clary journeys to the City of Bones to unlock her memories and find her mother.\n\nWe Hunt the Flames (2019) by Hafsah Faizal\n\nThe novel is set in an imaginary world named Arawiya. Although the imaginary setting is inspired by the world of ancient Arabia, the characters in this novel relate to modern readers in how they interact with each other and communicate. Inspired by Arabian mythology, this novel is an immersive fantasy as magical or fantastical elements are perceived as ordinary by the characters.\n\nThe young 17-year-old protagonist Zafira is known as the Hunter though no one knows it is her as she can’t reveal her identity as a woman. She disguises herself as a man and enters the cursed forest named the Arz to feed her people. The Arz grows every day, and each day, people are threatened with its curse. Zafira goes on a quest to get a lost artefact that would supposedly restore magic to Arawiya and end the curse of the Arz.\n\nNasir is the Prince of Death and an assassin for his father, the King. He is sent by the King to kill the infamous Hunter and take the artefact (an ancient book filled with the knowledge that the Lion of the Night desires to know). When Nasir finds out that the Hunter is Zafira and Zafira finds out that the Prince of Death is just a boy, their plans change to one of unity.\n\nContemporary Fantasy - Key Takeaways\n\nContemporary fantasy is a subgenre of the fantasy genre set in the modern world. Other subgenres are historical fantasy and science fantasy.\n\nContemporary fantasy can be further categorised into urban fantasy, mythic romance fantasy and noir.\n\nThe elements of contemporary fantasy are mythology and folklore, paranormality and imaginary settings.\n\nThe elements of urban fantasy include urban settings, mythical creatures, fantasy tropes, noir themes and young protagonists.\n\nContemporary fantasy was popularized by writers like C.S. Lewis, who wrote The Chronicles of Narnia (1956).\n\n1 Farah Mendlesohn, Rhetorics of Fantasy, 2014."
