        "text": "Patina Renea Miller (born November 6, 1984) is an American actress and singer. Miller is best known for originating the role of disco diva wannabe Deloris Van Cartier in the 2009 West End and 2011 Broadway productions of Sister Act. She also starred as the Leading Player in the 2013 revival of Pippin for which she won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical.\n\nShe is also known for her role as Commander Paylor in The Hunger Games: Mockingjay films, and her series regular role as Daisy Grant on Madam Secretary.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nBorn in Pageland, South Carolina, and raised in a single parent home, she was introduced to music at an early age and sang with the gospel choir at her local church. She attended South Carolina Governor's School for the Arts & Humanities and in 2006 graduated with a degree in musical theatre from Carnegie Mellon University, which she attended on a full scholarship. She has credited her time at Carnegie Mellon as a big part of her life, saying, \"It was there that I studied and really realized that I could make my dream a reality. I'm so thankful to all my teachers who helped me to become the performer I am today. I'm so proud of my school and feel so blessed to have gotten such a wonderful education and made lifelong friends.\"\n\nCareer\n\nIn 2005, Miller was one of three finalists for the role of Effie White in Dreamgirls, which ultimately won Jennifer Hudson the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.

The London production opened on June 2, 2009 at the London Palladium, and although it received mixed reviews, most critics singled out Miller and praised her performance. Benedict Nightingale of The Times cited her \"terrific voice\" and continued, \"Add warmth, humour, vivacity—and you've a star who lacks Whoopi's wry vulnerability but adds dazzle to the razzle around her,\" while David Benedict of Variety thought her \"powerhouse vocals, pitched somewhere between Gloria Gaynor and Whitney Houston, and her thrillingly fast vibrato act as the show's engine.\" For this role Miller won the whatsonstage.com Theatregoers Choice Award for Best Actress in a Musical and was also nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical. She remained with the production till it closed on October 30, 2010.\n\nMiller reprised the role of Deloris Van Cartier in the Broadway production of Sister Act, which began performances on March 24, 2011, at the Broadway Theatre and officially opened April 20, 2011.
