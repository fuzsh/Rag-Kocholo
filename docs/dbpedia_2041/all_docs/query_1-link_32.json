Some kids in Israel think that we need to justify all the time why we are here. And we don't need to justify it to anyone. This is our right to be here. This is the national home for us. There is no other national home. The national home of the Jewish people.\n\nAnd we need to continue and talk about it and talk about it, and not let the Palestinians or the Arabs or any other enemy take us from our root. If they want to continue on, if they want to negotiate, if they want to sit at the table with us, this is the condition. If they don't want [that], we can continue and fight with them another one hundred years. We're not afraid of it. They need to become tired of fighting us, and not the opposite.\n\nAnd we do it, I think as [co-panelist Israeli MK Einat Wilf] said before, by winning again and again and again and again and again. We won every conflict that we've had, and we will win any conflict that we will have."
