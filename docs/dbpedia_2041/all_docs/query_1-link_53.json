        "text": "JERUSALEM, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Israel has announced an agriculture reform plan to reduce prices of fruits, vegetables, eggs and other products, the Israeli Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Agriculture said on Wednesday in a joint statement.\n\n\"This is the largest-scale reform in Israel's agriculture field in the last 30 years. We are launching an agricultural revolution in favor of consumers, innovation and farmers,\" said Israeli Agriculture Minister Oded Forer.\n\nThe program, which implements the recommendation of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), is expected to increase competition in Israel's agriculture industry and expand the range of products by easing regulation, and thus reduce consumer prices, the ministries said.\n\nThey noted that the prices of fruits and vegetables in recent years have jumped by more than 80 percent on average, adding that the new plan will thus save 2.7 billion shekels (824 million U.S. dollars) per year for Israeli consumers.\n\nIt is expected to enhance competition by reducing the import taxes imposed on all fruits and vegetables, including an immediate cancelation of taxes imposed on eggs, avocados, lychees, and pineapples.\n\nThe program also includes a broad support package for Israeli farmers, such as tax benefits, cost reductions, and grants for innovation.\n\nIsrael's finance minister Avigdor Lieberman said that the reform will support Israeli farmers while reducing consumers' living costs.
