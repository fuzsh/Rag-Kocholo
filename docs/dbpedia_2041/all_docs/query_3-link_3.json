        "text": "Thrilled to Share Insights at ProVeg Incubator üåü There's a special kind of joy in sharing knowledge, especially when it comes to empowering the bright minds shaping our future food systems. I had the pleasure, for the third time, to lead a workshop for ProVeg Incubator, the winter 2023 cohort - focusing on 'Comanufacturing & Supply Chain: Unlocking Success for Startups'. For those not yet familiar, ProVeg Incubator is a force for good in the food tech world. It‚Äôs an initiative supporting startups that are reimagining the way we consume food for the betterment of our health, the planet, and the welfare of animals. They nurture these innovators with the tools, connections, and knowledge to flourish in a competitive market. At Cibus Nexum, we align perfectly with this mission. My workshop delved into the nuances of building robust supply chains and agile comanufacturing partnerships ‚Äì essential ingredients for startup success. It's not just about logistics; it‚Äôs about crafting a sustainable framework for upscaling, innovation, and long-term impact. Being part of this transformative journey is an honor. Watching these startups evolve, knowing we‚Äôve played a part in their story, reinforces why we do what we do at Cibus Nexum. Thanks for having me Antje R√§uscher and Nicole Rocque! And thanks for joining: Allium Bio POSEIDONA cellva Livestock Labs Food4You Guimarana Dream Food Boyan Zahariev Marinas Bio #FoodTech #Innovation #Sustainability #altprotein #plantbased #ProVegIncubator #StartUpGrowth #foodworkshop\n\nVery excited to share that after working alongside the founders of Adept Aqua for 7 months now, I‚Äôve recently decided to take the leap and join the team more formally. Adept Aqua is an emerging DeepTech/ClimateTech startup which is revolutionising water treatment - both for the protection and regeneration of the natural environment and industrial applications such as the aquaculture industry. They have also recently been selected by Cicada Innovations to be one of the #Tech23 When the Ops role was offered, I realised I had both Ikigai * and the perfect team fit to take the leap. You know what they say... \"never say I'll never join a startup again!\". The website and technology is deliberately vague - we are awaiting priority dates - but it will deliver key benefits, such as: - Catalysing decarbonisation of the global aquaculture industry (lowering energy use and carbon footprint of oxygenation/aeration leading to increased profitability). - Boosting the health and resilience of fragile river, waterway, and lake ecosystems, and the critically endangered native species that live within them. I'm still working with my portfolio of startups, board roles and still investing. I'm looking forward to the many more exciting announcements Adept will make over the coming months. *Ikigai = Reason for Being What I love = Food & helping technical founders bring their products to market. What I'm good at = getting shit done What the world needs = low carbon future What I can be paid for = Massive TAM in 3 distinct markets.\n\nüåü Wishing you a Happy New Year from all of us at RootCamp! ‚ú® At RootCamp we are ready for another amazing year.

In the fertile grounds of innovation, talent often blooms in the most unexpected places. I was able to witness this firsthand at a the START Global student hackathon last week, an event that focuses on catalyzing ideas for various industry challenges, including agriculture. At the hacking arena of innovation, I was struck by the energy - a blend of talent, persistence, creativity and other factors that together, create the alchemy of success. Another key ingredient of that larger equation is collaboration. Or in farming terms: The pollination of ideas which turns a single seed into a garden of possibilities. Resources, too, play a crucial role. Just as a farmer needs the right tools to cultivate their land, innovators need access to technology, mentorship, and a platform to bring their ideas to life. Events like the #STARThack provide such resources allowing talents of the next generation to thrive and contribute to complex challenges - such as how we feed an ever-growing population while protecting our planet. Syngenta is cultivating an environment that values innovation and collaboration through such events and strategic partnerships (e.g., as recently announced with IBM Research and with US biotech Maxygen). Platforms like our https://lnkd.in/dpYrZexz program act as incubator and bring together academia, start ups and organizations. A big THANK YOU to all \"our\" teams that inspired us with their talent, their persistence and their creativity at the #STARThack. Mostly I enjoyed the collaboration and exchange with these young talents (some of them listed below) and look forward to hearing about the causes they'll invest their talents in the future. While riding a unicorn may not be my talent (clearly not, but my team challenged me at the #STARThack), it might invite others to try things they are not (yet) experts iny, and which could potentially blossom into something special over time. #futureofagriculture #digitaltransformation #digital Luis Kalckstein, Mojm√≠r Horv√°th, Victoria Utomo, Peter Dike, Michelle Espranita Liman, Andr√©s Gonz√°lez Eelman, Alexander Palatnik, Ekaterina Gikalo, Leonie Merkl, Felix Waigner, Johanna Emily Hallfahrt, Noah Latzel, Alexandra Juchler, Shinan Chen, Pedro Basso, Jo√£o Rubens Belluzzo Neto, Alessia Bernareggi (and many others, who I don't have the contacts of)\n\nRSVP for our virtual pitch event on December 7th üóìÔ∏èüå± This week we are introducing the startups that will be pitching during our final pitch event of the year: Pitch & Plant 2023!
