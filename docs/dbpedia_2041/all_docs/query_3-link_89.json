        "text": "Archaeologists digging near Tel Aviv unearthed a glimpse of daily life 1,500 years ago and Christianity’s influence then in the region. The Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) found remains of an agriculture community, as well as an artifact perhaps from a Byzantine-era church and a gold coin depicting Jesus’ crucifixion.\n\n“The excavation unearthed evidence of agricultural-industrial activity at the site during the Byzantine period—about 1,500 years ago,” explains Dr. Yoav Arbel, excavation director on behalf of the IAA.\n\nArbel said the finds included a winepress, possibly a large warehouse foundation, storage, and cooking jars, and cooking and medicinal stone tools made from the basalt found in the Golan Heights in Galilee.\n\nThe coin is believed to have been minted in 638 or 639 AD. On one side is the image of Heraclius, the Byzantine emperor at the time. The other side contains three figures depicting Jesus’ crucifixion at Golgotha. The original owner of the special coin also put an inscription on it (in Greek and possibly Arabic) to mark his prized possession.\n\nA chain made of bronze was also discovered at the dig in Ramat Ha-Sharon. Glass lamp chandeliers in Byzantine churches were hung using chains such as the one uncovered at the site.\n\nArchaeologists also found remnants of the Muslim conquest around the same time. For example, they unearthed remains of jars for storing grain, baking ovens, and a workshop for blowing glass.\n\nThe mayor of Ramat Ha-Sharon said he plans to find a way to bring the old and new together by incorporating the ancient archaeological site into a new housing development just outside of Tel Aviv.\n\nPrime Minister Naftali Bennett met on Wednesday in Washington with Secretary of State Antony Blinken as part of a series of meetings with President Joe Biden and top US defense officials.\n\nThis is Bennett’s first visit to the US.\n\nBennett stated during the meeting that “Israel has no stronger and more reliable ally than the United States of America. From our inception and to this day, especially these days, you are always with us, you have our back and that matters a lot to us.”\n\n“I can assure you that you’ll find no friend which is more reliable and appreciative than us,” he added.\n\nHe declared he was bringing from Israel “a new spirit, a spirit of folks who sometimes harbor different opinions but work together in cooperation, in goodwill, in a spirit of unity and we work hard to find common things that we do agree upon and move forward on it.”\n\nHowever, it is unclear what he was relating to, as former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former President Donald Trump had one of the closest working relationships in Israel’s history and brought unprecedented achievements for the Jewish State.\n\nThe “bunch of issues” they discussed is “how do we fend off and curtail Iran’s pursuit to dominate the region and its race to a nuclear weapon,” regional stability, and climate change.\n\nBlinken stated that they discussed “the importance of the US-Israel partnership, including America’s commitment to Israel’s security.”\n\nEarlier in the day, Bennett met with Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and discussed “a series of regional, diplomatic and security issues, especially the ways to block Iran’s regional aggression and the progress of its nuclear program.”\n\nBennett stressed that “alongside the strategic alliance between the US and Israel, Israel will continue to insist on its right to maintain security supremacy in the Middle East and would continue to do everything necessary in this regard.”\n\nBennett is slated to meet with Biden at the White House on Thursday.\n\nAn Israeli excavation of the famed Great Synagogue in Vilnius (Vilna), Lithuania, has fully exposed the Aron Kodesh (Torah Ark) and the Bimah (raised podium) that was destroyed decades ago by the Nazis and the Soviets.\n\nThe expedition, directed by the archaeologist of the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) Dr. Jon Seligman, announced Thursday its conclusion after a six-year excavation project, aimed at uncovering the remains of the Great Synagogue of Vilna and parts of the Shulhoyf, the center of the Jewish community and Torah life of Vilna.\n\nThe excavation began in July 2015 with a ground-penetrating radar test that developed into a full excavation and significant discoveries.\n\n“Just this morning, while sifting the soil in front of the Aron Kodesh, we found a silver Yad,” the archaeologists said.\n\nThe Yad is a pointer used while reading from a Torah scroll.\n\nThe magnificent Great Synagogue of Vilna was the oldest and most significant symbol of Lithuanian Jewry. Like most of the Jewish cultural centers in Lithuania, the Great Synagogue was destroyed during the Holocaust.\n\nBuilt in the 17th century in Renaissance-Baroque style, the Great Synagogue was surrounded over time by other community buildings, including 12 synagogues, the community council, kosher meat stalls, the famous Strashun library, a complex of ritual baths and other communal institutions that formed a great center of Torah study, the beating heart of Lithuanian Jewry.\n\nAfter centuries of existence, with the destruction of the entire Jewish community of Vilna, this important shrine was ransacked and burnt by the Germans during World War II. The remains were later demolished by the Soviet authorities, and a modern school was constructed on the site.\n\nSeligman visited Vilnius a few years ago as part of a heritage trip, sparking the idea of revealing and discovering what was left of the compound and the synagogue.\n\nSeligman, Justinas Rakas, of the Kultūros paveldo Išsaugojimo pajėgos, and combined teams of Lithuanians, Israelis and North Americans, worked for six seasons.\n\n“When we arrived to excavate the Aron Kodesh and the Bimah, from which generations of Jews read the Torah scroll for 300 consecutive years, it became clear, unfortunately, that the core of the synagogue had been greatly damaged by Soviet destruction,” Seligman noted.\n\nHowever, two impressive staircases, clearly visible in the many images of the synagogue before its destruction, were discovered and are evidence of their existence.\n\nIn addition, the excavation of Bimah was completed including the entire façade of the Bimah and the complete remains of one of the four huge pillars that supported the roof of the Great Synagogue.”\n\nThe remains of the Aron Kodesh, which were recently unearthed, and which appears in all its glory in the many pictures of the synagogue, was renovated after a fire in the 18th century with the contribution of the “Yesod” foundation. The foundation also donated the ornate Bimah, which was a two-story structure with four Corinthian columns and eight Tuscan columns.\n\nThe excavation of the Great Synagogue in Lithuania is a joint venture of the Israel Antiquities Authority, the Kultūros paveldo Išsaugojimo pajėgos, the Good Will Foundation, and the Jewish Community of Lithuania.\n\nDefense Minister Benny Gantz held on Wednesday a briefing for more than 60 foreign ambassadors on the security situation under the title “Challenges and opportunities for Israel and its allies,” during which he underscored Iran’s threat to global peace.\n\nThis is the third year that Gantz held this briefing for foreign ambassadors.\n\nFocusing on Iran, Gantz state that “Iran has an intention to destroy Israel, and it is working to have the means to do so. In addition, it operates through its branches in Iraq, Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and Gaza, uses drones and precision missiles, works against merchant ships at sea, and conducts cyberattacks around the world.”\n\nHe underscored that according to Israeli estimates, the attack on the oil tanker Mercer Street in July which killed two people “was carried out on Iranian soil, and it is likely that this was done with the approval of the Supreme Leader,” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nGanz presented the Iranian defense budget and its marked increase, which more than doubled in five years from $22 billion to $49 billion.\n\nGanz said that “Israel has no conflict with the Iranian people, but with the Iranian regime.”\n\nHe also noted Israel’s discontent with representatives of several countries, including the European Union, who attended the swearing-in ceremony of Iran’s new President Ebrahim Raisi, “the executioner from Tehran.”\n\nGantz further stressed that “Iran is two months away from accumulating the material needed for a nuclear bomb.”\n\n“We do not know if the Iranian regime is ready to reach an agreement and return to the negotiating table and the world must build a Plan B and halt its progress now,” he stated.\n\nPrime Minister Naftali Bennett is in Washington for discussions with President Joe Biden and top US defense officials with an emphasis on the Iranian nuclear threat.\n\nWhile “the ultimate goal is to reach a longer, stronger and broader agreement,” Iran’s arrival at a nuclear threshold “puts us on the brink of a regional and possibly global nuclear arms race. All Iranian aggression so far has been without this capability, if it has the ability to break through to nuclear capacities, it will increase its aggression,” Gantz warned.\n\n“We in Israel have our options, we knew how to use the means at our disposal in the past, and I do not rule out that we will have to use them in the future. But Iran is first and foremost a challenge to the world that needs to unite and act,” he explained.\n\nIsrael bombed the Osirak reactor in Iraq in 1981 and the Syrian nuclear program in 2007.\n\nOn the Lebanese issue, Ganz said that “there are missile depots in thousands of homes in the heart of the civilian population. Iran and Hezbollah are taking advantage of the humanitarian situation in Lebanon, preventing a stable government.”\n\nGantz noted that he had offered Lebanon assistance on three occasions, including directly through international organizations, and that Israel was ready to enable international assistance to Lebanon to be dispatched from its territory.\n\nOne of the things about getting older is that the older you get the more experience you have. Sometimes it is good experience and sometimes it is less profitable experience. Regardless of the quality of your experience, with each and every day we acquire more of it. After I passed a certain age and had gained a certain level of experience, people (mostly younger) began to seek out advice and counsel and advice from me. I have been asked what the most important lesson that I have learned over my years as a believer in Yeshua is. So, I thought I would share that nugget of experience and knowledge with you.\n\nSo, here it is. G-D is the main character in the Bible. Too often in our reading and studying of the Bible, we forget that Adam and Eve, Abraham and Sarah, Isaac, Jacob and Esau, Moses, David, Solomon, Samson, Peter, Paul and John are all supporting characters in the greater narrative in which G-D is the only protagonist. You may be wondering why I consider this the most important lesson I have learned as a believer. It is because once we realize that G-D is the one and only main character in the story, we will conclude that the Bible is a story about G-D and not about you and I.\n\nIn other words, just as Abraham, Moses, Sarah, Rebecca, and the others are a part of the story, they are not what the story is about; the Bible is about G-D. Once we come to terms with this truth, then we are able to remove ourselves from the lead role and allow G-D to be the one and only star.\n\nIt is then that we realize life isn’t all about us. When we realize we are not the hero of the story, then we also realize that everyone really isn’t watching our every move. We are not responsible to be the be-all and end-all. When we rightly conclude that the story is not about us, but about Him, then all of the weight and burden of trying to be Him gets lifted off of our shoulders. When we stop trying to be Him, being us becomes so much easier and so much more peaceful. When we realize that our job is to let Him do His job within us, then becoming what He designed us to be becomes much less stressful. Life as a disciple becomes so much less problematic when we start being a disciple (follower) instead of always trying to be the leader.\n\nEvery other lesson that we as believers need to learn is easier to learn once we learn that we are not the stars of the story and that the story isn’t really all about us. That’s why the story begins with: “In the beginning, G-D,” not “In the beginning, you.”\n\nPrime Minister Naftali Bennett’s government is facing criticism following reports that his government has halted the funding for the expansion of Route 60 in the Gush Etzion area, the main artery connecting the area to Jerusalem.\n\nAccording to a report by the Makor Rishon daily, Minister of Transportation Merav Michaeli and Minister of Finance Avigdor Liberman have frozen the funding for a significant segment of the road, which is already under the early stages of construction.\n\nGush Etzion Regional Council head Shlomo Ne’eman stated Tuesday that “we heard with astonishment the intention of the Ministry of Transportation not to allow the immediate continuation of the tunnel widening work that is already in progress.”\n\n“The road is the main artery of Gush Etzion and the surrounding area to ​​our capital Jerusalem. Our residents suffer terrible traffic jams when a short drive becomes a long stand in endless traffic jams, and there is hardly a day that there is not at least one car accident on the short section of the tunnel road that has long since become a transport disaster,” he noted.\n\n“Do we once again find ourselves held hostage by politicians on the way to receiving basic service from the state, in which we are equal citizens? The people of Gush Etzion find it difficult to believe that such a decision was indeed made, but if so, it must be reversed immediately and the opposite done: to allow the continuation of the works, which have already cost the state many millions,” he said.\n\nOded Revivi, the Mayor of Efrat, said he had sent a missive to Michaeli explaining the significance of the road works, which are benefiting both Israelis and Arabs in the area.\n\nBoth ministries said they were aiming on transferring the funds, possibly in the 2022 budget.\n\nAn Iranian, Daryoosh, grew up acquiring hatred for Israel. But, when he encountered Jesus Christ, hatred turned into love.\n\nIranian in Israel\n\nDaryoosh lived in a community in Iran where hatred for Israel was evident. Every morning before class, they would shout, “Death to Israel!”\n\nSubsequently, he entered the Iranian military and during that time, he got addicted to drugs, life in Iran was difficult. So, after serving in the military, he tried to flee from the country illegally.\n\nJourney in England\n\nHe landed in England wanting to have a better life. He didn’t have a good reason for the asylum application so he pretended to be a persecuted Christian from Iran. Daryoosh claimed that life in Iran was dangerous for him so he fled.\n\nAnd so, he prepared himself for the interview in the immigration office. Since he didn’t know anything about Christianity, he looked for a church and joined, gathering every basic information about being a Christian.\n\nAs a result, he learned all about Jesus but his heart was still dark. The knowledge was in his mind, but not in his heart.\n\nThe day for his interview was near and Daryoosh called his pastor for help. But, instead of supporting him, the pastor encouraged Daryoosh to stop the lies and stand in the truth.\n\nOverwhelming love\n\nOne day, he locked himself in his room, and desperately pleaded God for a revelation. True to His Word, God came. He encountered Daryoosh with His overwhelming love.\n\n“That moment I gave my heart to Him,” he said. “He gave me strength and power to give up the drugs.”\n\nAt that moment, Daryoosh surrendered his life to Christ and started a new life. So, he went into the immigration office and confessed his wrongdoing. He was then summoned into court for lying to the government.\n\nBut, a miracle happened inside the courtroom. As Daryoosh was probed by the judge, he shared about Psalm 96. Everyone inside got to open the Bible and read Psalm 96. After which, he got accepted to stay in England.\n\nAs Daryoosh continued studying the Bible, he learned to love Israel. He said, “God gave me a passion, a love for the Jewish people because the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Jesus Christ, saved my life.”\n\nIranian Muslim chanted “death to Israel” Now speaks life!\n\nReference: Youtube | One for Israel\n\nALSO READ:\n\nIranian Jew Begged Jesus To Heal His Son, ‘I Can’t Shut Up Anymore’\n\nFor the first time in Israel’s history, the Israeli Air Force (IAF) deployed a “Shimshon” C-130J Super Hercules aircraft to fight fires.\n\nThe Super Hercules flew over the Jerusalem Hills on Tuesday afternoon and on dropped 16 tons of fire retardant as part of the consorted effort by Israel’s rescue forces to put out the wildfires in the area.\n\nThe project to use the massive plane to fight fires is still in its pilot stages, and the decision to deploy the plane was made after a joint situational assessment with the IDF, Israeli Police, and Israeli Fire and Rescue Services.\n\nIf crowned a success, the deployment of the Hercules aircraft is expected to double Israel’s airborne firefighting capabilities.\n\nThe IDF’s support in fighting the fires also included Home Front Command firefighters, IAF aircraft providing a real-time situational image of the fires, and soldiers from the IDF Search and Rescue Brigade.\n\nThe IAF’s Airborne Combat Search-and-Rescue Unit 669 performed evacuations.\n\nThe forest fires that raged in area around Jerusalem have been placed under control after two days of burning, fire authorities announced Tuesday evening.\n\nResidents of all the towns of the area were allowed to return to their homes.\n\nThe fires had been suppressed after 52 hours of continuous firefighting. 204 fire crews comprising of some 1,500 firefighters took part in the operation.
