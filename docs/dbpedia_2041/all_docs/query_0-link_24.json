        "text": "JERUSALEM, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Israeli farmers on Thursday staged demonstrations and blocked major junctions across the country in protest of a reform announced by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Agriculture last week.\n\nThe two ministries decided to conduct the biggest reform in the agricultural section in the last 30 years, aiming to reduce consumer prices of fruits, vegetables, eggs and other products.\n\nThe reform, which is recommended by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, is expected to increase competition by reducing import taxes.\n\nPrices of fruits and vegetables in recent years have jumped by more than 80 percent on average in Israel. The new plan is thus expected to save 2.7 billion shekels (830 million U.S. dollars) per year for Israeli consumers.\n\nDespite a broad support package including tax benefits, cost reductions and grants for innovation, the Israeli farmers' organizations claim that the plan will severely harm the farmers financially, adding that the suppliers, mainly supermarket chains, are those responsible for the high prices\n\nMeetings held on Wednesday between the ministries and the farmers did not yield agreements, leading to the protest, in which the farmers used tractors, tools and agricultural products to block the roads.\n\nIsrael's Finance Minister Avigdor Lieberman said that \"throwing eggs, fruits, and vegetables on the roads while blocking them will not benefit consumers and will not lead to an increase in production and consumption.\"\n\nAgriculture Minister Oded Forer said he would immediately open the egg market to tax-free imports, following information he received, according to which farmers plan to sabotage the egg supply ahead of the Jewish holidays to be marked in September.
