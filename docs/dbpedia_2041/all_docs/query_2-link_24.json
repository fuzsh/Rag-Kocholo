        "text": "The American Dental Association defines Comprehensive oral evaluation as: A general dentist performs a comprehensive exam, which is applicable to new patients and long-term patients who have had a significant change in their health or haven‚Äôt been seen in a while. It entails a visual examination of the oral cavity in conjunction with dental imagery. Additionally, ADA policy states: Dentists can and do play an essential role in the multidisciplinary care of patients with certain sleep related breathing disorders and are well positioned to identify patients at greater risk of SRBD. SRBD can be caused by a number of multifactorial medical issues and are therefore best treated through a collaborative model. Working in conjunction with our colleagues in medicine, dentists have various methods of mitigating these disorders. In children, the dentist‚Äôs recognition of suboptimal early craniofacial growth and development or other risk factors may lead to medical referral or orthodontic/orthopedic intervention to treat and/or prevent SRBD. So the question that this raises to me is: Shouldn‚Äôt the definition of ‚ÄúComprehensive Care‚Äù include the routine screening for airway issues? We know that 7 of the 10 most commonly prescribed medications are co-morbidities of Airway problems. When checking the medical history shouldn‚Äôt this set off alarm bells in the evaluating dentist? I have often heard the statement ‚Äúairway trumps all‚Äù. Perhaps it‚Äôs time to shake up our training and be sure to bring this evaluation into our comprehensive examinations and help all our patients achieve a better life.\n\nJohn I agree wholeheartedly. The challenge, from my perpective as a dental patient is, dentists may know what the ADA reccommends but it doesn't translate into action. During presentations to large groups of dental offices I've regularly asked two questions; \"With a show of hands, Do you screen for oral cancer during your exam? All hands go up. \"Do you screen for sleep disordered breathing (OSA)?\" Far fewer hands are raised. My take, based on my experience introducing VELscope, tissue flouresence, and OSA appliance therapy to dentistry was that most dental offices weren't PROPERLY screening for oral cancer & most had no idea how to screen for Sleep Disordered Breathing. The million dollar question: Regardless of what's reccommended, what needs to happen to change behavior? Any one have any suggestions?\n\nI HAVE COME ACROSS A LOT OF REELS AND POSTS IN SOCIAL MEDIA as such where dentists are being trolled for their conversations with patients during dental procedures. It's important to remember that when dentists engage in conversations with their patients during procedures, they often do so to help alleviate anxiety and create a more comfortable atmosphere. However, like many professionals, dentists may face challenges, including the potential for misunderstandings or trolling. Here's a balanced perspective on this issue: ü¶∑ The Challenge of In-Between Conversations in Dentistry ü¶∑ Dentists, like all healthcare professionals, aim to provide the best care possible to their patients. Sometimes, they engage in light conversations during procedures to ease tension and create a more relaxed environment. However, this practice can occasionally lead to misunderstandings or trolling. Why Dentists Talk During Procedures: 1.Anxiety Reduction: Dental procedures can be intimidating, and friendly conversation helps patients feel more at ease. 2.Distraction: Engaging in conversation can divert a patient's attention away from the procedure, making it seem less daunting. 3.Building Trust: Open communication fosters trust between dentists and patients, which is crucial for quality care. The Challenge: 1.Misinterpretation: In some cases, patients or observers may misinterpret these conversations, assuming they are unprofessional or irrelevant. 2.Trolling: Like many professionals, dentists may occasionally face trolling or negative comments, especially in the age of social media. It's important to remember that dentists prioritize patient care and comfort. If you have concerns about conversations during dental procedures, it's best to discuss them with your dentist directly. Clear communication can help both parties understand each other's perspectives and work towards a comfortable and positive dental experience. ü¶∑‚ú® #DentalCare #PatientComfort #Communication #dentalanxiety #dentalawareness #dentistrylife #dentalclinic #dentalhygiene #dentalindustry #prosthodontics #orthodontics #periodontics #omfs #pediatricdentistry #oralmedicine #endodontics #oralpathology\n\nAre you considering dental treatment abroad?

The sources of stress can be patient-related, practice-related, and personal. The impact of stress can be significant and can lead to burnout, anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. To prevent and manage stress, dental surgeons should have access to support services, improve their work-life balance, receive regular training and education, and work in a positive environment. These strategies can help dental surgeons maintain good mental health and provide the best care for their patients."
