        "text": "Wars end, the historical record shows, not through goodwill but through defeat. He who does not win loses,â wrote Middle East Forum president Daniel Pipes.\n\nIt is clear that in the over 100 years of violent rejectionism against sovereignty for the Jewish people in its historical, ancestral and indigenous homeland, the Palestinians have yet to fully feel defeated.\n\nPipes explains that âwars usually end when failure causes one side to despair, when that side has abandoned its war aims and accepted defeat, and when that defeat has exhausted its will to fight.â\n\nHamas and other violent rejectionists on our borders have yet to abandon their war aims of destroying the Jewish state. This is a simple fact that must be addressed, if Israel is ever to achieve true long-term peace and security.\n\nThat is why we need bold thinking and courage to end this war once and for all.\n\nWe have been told for some time now that Hamas is readying itself for the next confrontation. Sadly, our recent policy of preparing for the next bloody confrontation is to strengthen it financially while allowing it to strengthen militarily.\n\nIn November, after trying for many months to convince his colleagues in the security cabinet to deliver a mortal blow to Hamas, then-defense minister Avigdor Liberman quit the government.\n\nâ"
