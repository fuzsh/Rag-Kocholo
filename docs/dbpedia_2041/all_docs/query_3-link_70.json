        "text": "(haipo) - 21-year-old Omri Zevida from Haifa participated last month (7/24) in an international Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu competition held in Venice, Italy, and returned to Israel with great honor, winning 7 fights and taking 4 medals - 2 gold and 2 bronze.\n\nZevida participated in the competition - IBJJF Venice open and won 7 victories which brought him, as mentioned, 4 medals.\n\nAfter three fights, he won first place in the GI division (with a suit) in the category up to 70 kg (Zavida's weight is 63 kg - it should be noted that these are significant weight differences), after winning the first fight by submission and the other fights by choke.\n\nZevida also took first place in the NOGI division (without a suit) in the category up to 70 kg, after two fights in which he won by a margin of about 20 points.\n\nHe was not satisfied with these impressive achievements and also competed in the open weight category in the GI division, in which he defeated a competitor weighing 80 kg (!) and came in the respectable third place."
