        "text": "The Innovation Department of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Serbia in cooperation with the Representative Office of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Serbia in Israel held a Tech7 Webinar on Monday, January 17, 2022, starting at 10 am, where programs for the startup community of Serbia and Israel were presented.\n\nThe event was attended by representatives of relevant institutions from Israel and Serbia, which contribute to the improvement of startup ecosystems, such as: Tech7, Yazamut 360˚, Israel National Cyber ​​Directorate, Bar-Ilan University, Office of the Prime Minister - IT and Entrepreneurship Team, Ministry Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia, Science and Technology Park Niš, Science and Technology Park Čačak, Science and Technology Park Novi Sad, Digital Serbia Initiative, Regional Chamber of Commerce Niš and Business Club Naissus.\n\nThe goal of the event was networking, as well as to exchange the experience and make new business opportunities in the startup ecosystem of these two countries. The event was interactive, where the participants, in addition to the opportunity to get information about the work of these institutions from Israel and Serbia, had the opportunity to present their business and initiate potential cooperation.\n\nThe introductory words were given by Bojana Krstić, the Head of the Innovation Department of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Serbia, who pointed out that this is the second event that connects institutions from Israel and Serbia. The initial event resulted in numerous interconnections, and was aimed at the BIO4 Campus - headed by the Cabinet of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Serbia - and the possibility of cooperation with the Institute of Nanotechnology and Advanced Materials of Bar-Ilan University in Israel. Such events will soon become a practice – because of the common goals and values ​​of these institutions.\n\nContinuing the above, Aleksandar Nikolić, Honorary Consul of the Republic of Serbia in Israel and Director of the Representative Office of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Serbia in Israel, referred to numerous opportunities for business development, emphasizing the connection and potential for cooperation between twin cities - Niš and Beer Sheva, and focused of talent recruitment and funds.\n\nMihailo Vesović, Director of the Sector for Strategic Analysis, Services and Internationalization of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Serbia, expressed words of support for organizing of the meeting between the two countries for a second time, and stressed the great potential for cooperation between representatives of present institutions.\n\nRepresentatives of Tech7 (Harel Ram, Omri Yitro Dai, Daniel Martin and Itay Harel) presented the course of development of their organization from 2011 to 2019, pointing out all the factors that contributed to the improvement of infrastructure and the overall business organization. Tech7 encompasses innovation, entrepreneurship and the high-tech community, as well as startup, scale-up and senior-level development programs for companies. Cooperation with investment funds and business angels was underlined, and Mexico and Vietnam was mentioned as foreign partners, while cooperation with partners around the world is welcome. Also, cyber security was pointed out as a topic that will be significant in the coming period. Future activities will require the support of all actors, from the Government to the private sector, in order to provide the community with adequate solutions that include industry, startups, pilot programs and the wider company market.\n\nOr Santo, a representative of the Yazamut 360 Entrepreneurship Center, attended the meeting and expressed interest and openness to the participation and contribution of this center in future activities.\n\nDoron Lieberman, a representative of the INCD (Israel National Cyber ​​Directorate), stressed the importance of cyber solutions to be supported by the Government, as well as the important role of the private sector.\n\nAfter presentations held by representatives of the institutions from Israel, the floor was given to domestic institutions that contribute to the development of startup ecosystems.\n\nMilan Ranđelović, Director of the Science and Technology Park Niš, presented in detail the most important activities and plans of this institution. It is interesting that Niš is also a twin city with the Israeli city of Beer Sheva, where the headquarters of the Tech7 organization are located, which - as both sides hope - will influence future cooperation. Comparing the systems and opportunities they provide, Ranđelović offered concrete proposals on common points, encouraging colleagues from Tech7, but also participants from Serbia, to initiate further steps.\n\nMirko Pešić, Director of the Science and Technology Park Čačak, presented the most important activities and expressed readiness for cooperation. It is interesting that NTP Čačak consists not only of IT companies, but also companies that have physical products. Also, cooperation with the Government of the Republic of Serbia since 2020 has been singled out as an important factor.\n\nVladimir Todorović, a representative of the Science and Technology Park Novi Sad, in addition to being open for creating joint initiatives, singled out the Institute for Artificial Intelligence as an important current activity.\n\nThe presentations were followed by an active discussion where the present representatives of the institutions exchanged opinions and experiences, and initiated cooperation with the aim of finalizing as soon as possible.\n\nIn the final part of the meeting, it was proposed to form a working group on the topics discussed at the meeting, where science and technology parks and other relevant institutions would take part. Also, on this occasion, the science and technology parks were invited to attend the Dubai 2020 Expo exhibition in early March, so that they could make personal contact at the event and begin the realization of cooperation.\n\nThe Innovation Department of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Serbia and the Representative Office of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Serbia in Israel plan to host similar meetings in the future and give their contribution to the improvement of the startup community of Serbia and Israel.\n\nOct 11, 2021\n\nWith the words “welcome home”, the President of Serbia, Aleksandar Vučić, began his address today at the opening of the Commemorative Meeting on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the first Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM).\n\n“I hope that we will not only discuss the past, but also the future that we want to build together. The world of dialogue, compromise, and peace is still possible and attainable”, he said.\n\nBelgrade has been, is and will continue be a proud host to all human beings who carry peace within themselves. The basic idea around which our predecessors gathered when they founded the Movement was peace. Peace is the basis for the development of cooperation, whether politicalor economic”, Vučić pointed out.\n\nHe said that he was especially glad for having the opportunity to see friends from distant countries, for whom the difficult situation with Covid-19 was not an obstacle to travel to Belgrade, which showed the importance they attach to this organization.\n\nIt is a great personal privilege and honour for Serbia that we gathered here in Belgrade, where we will make sure that you feel at home. I am convinced that Belgrade, as a centuries-old symbol, a crossroads of civilizations and religions, a meeting point between East and West, can inspire you to dialogue and encourage you to build new bridges of cooperation”, Vučić said.\n\nHe emphasized that international cooperation, while respecting fundamental principles, is the only path towardsthe development and prosperity of humanity, and pointed out that the UN Sustainable Development Agenda 2030, according to him, highlights and promotes three principles – peace and security, development and human rights.\n\n“Serbia, as the legal successor of Yugoslavia, the founder of the UN and the NAM, is a proud promoter of the policy of multilateralism and respect for international norms.\n\nVučić pointed out that the Movement is based on common principles that have never lost their significance, and that it played an essential role in preserving peace and security in the world, in the process of decolonization, which promoted equality and social and economic development of all countries.\n\nHe also said that today it is not enough to nostalgically remember the golden age of the Movement, but that we must work together on fulfilling the goals that will lead towards the future of equals, where the same rights shall apply to everyone, and this is the direction the Movement has taken from its beginning and for which everyone should strive even today.\n\n“We are advocating this, not because it is a question of the interests of individual countries, but because it is one of the biggest civilizational steps that the world must take if it wants to survive, and not as a kind of camp of which only the rich have the key”, Vučić said.\n\nThe President said that the right to decide one’s own destiny is not a sin, but a right that must belong to everyone, regardless of the strength and power at theirdisposal.\n\nHe noticed that the world today is much different from the one in 1961, since globalization, interdependence and the development of new technologies have made the planet smaller, making an impact on everyone’s lives.\n\n“The challenges we face today know no boundaries, and their nature is more complex. That is why we need to work more than ever on the development of multilateralism, because no country is isolated and cooperation is the only way to prosperity”, Vučić said.\n\nThat, he says, is the basis on which, despite the differences, members of the Movement stand, the Movement which is a symbol of the freedom-loving part of the world, ready to fight for freedom, independence and sovereignty.\n\n“I believe that this indeed is something worth fighting for. Serbia knows best how difficult it is, because of all the struggles it is waging to preserve its sovereignty and territorial integrity, to resolve the issue of Kosovo and Metohija”, Vučić said.\n\nThe President said that in this way, Serbia defends the universal principles on which the UN Charter is based, the principles of international law, but also some of the most important values of the Movement.\n\nVučić said that Serbia remains committed to finding a compromise solution that would guarantee lasting peace in the province, convinced that it is a reflection of our strengths, not weaknesses, and stressed that Serbia is an independent state, which makes its own decisions, a reliable partner to all of its friends, always ready to extend a hand of cooperation.\n\nOn that note, he reminded that in the past period, Serbia selflessly helped everyone who needed it, with more than a million vaccines against Covid-19, more than half of which were donated to African and Asian countries, adding that our country will continue to do so, until the coronavirus becomes a thing of the past.\n\n“You have a loyal friend in Serbia, and these are not empty words. Despite all the pressures, Serbia will never turn its back on friends”, Vučić underlined.\n\nHe also reminded that the Movement was conceived with the idea of SFRY, Egypt and India, that peace cannot be ensured by divisions, but by striving for collective security and ending the domination of one country over another.\n\nPresident Vučić concluded by quoting an African proverb, saying “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together”, which he believes corresponds fully to the character of this Movement.\n\nSource TANJUG\n\nTo the Editor-in-Chief of the Jerusalem Post\n\nDear Mr. Katz,\n\nMuseum of Genocide Victims, a national cultural institution of the Republic of Serbia that researches and nurtures the memory of victims of Genocide committed against Serbs in World War II, victims of the Holocaust and other victims of Nazism and Fascism, expresses astonishment and sends a public protest to your daily newspapers.\n\nDespite its carefully created reputation as a relevant daily, Jerusalem Post published just before the sad 80th anniversary of the establishment of the concentration and death camp in Jasenovac (Croatia) - one of the most monstrous execution sites in all of Europe during the Second World War which functioned within the framework of the puppet Independent State of Croatia – a pseudo-scientific and revisionist text by journalist David Goldman.\n\nWith the text entitled \"This disgraceful mocking of the Holocaust needs to stop immediately\", author, without any professional qualifications and completely unknown to the international scientific community, became involved in the ongoing debate on the phenomenon of Holocaust distortion as a phenomenon on a global scale.\n\nAnd that's where almost everything positive in this article ends.\n\nUsing a series of inaccurate statements and semi-information with only few sentences author tried to make meaningless 76 years of continuous research, both by experts and institutions of Yugoslavia, later Serbia and Croatia, as well as institutions such as Yad Vashem and the USHMM.\n\nThe system of concentration and death camp in Jasenovac, founded and managed by the Independent State of Croatia, without the influence of Nazi Germany, was taken as an example of the mentioned distortion.\n\nThe only thing that is correctly stated refers to the geographical position of Jasenovac and the percentage share of Jews in human losses (15%).\n\nAnd that is where the factual and historical reliability of the claims presented in the article ends.\n\nIn a series of problematic information contained in that revisionist review, we first point to the statement about forensic research conducted in Yugoslavia, which allegedly determined that the total number of Jasenovac victims was between 2,500 and 4,500, which is an absolute and shameful untruth.\n\nMuseum of Genocide Victims, above all, points out that forensic research cannot yield results in the number of victims which ranges in a huge range from \"from - to\".\n\nAbove all, no exhumations were performed in 1947 and 1948.\n\nDuring 1946, four graves near the Uskočka Forests were excavated in which 967 remains were found (311 men, 467 women and 189 children).\n\nBased on the further research, it was estimated that there ere about a thousand killed in the tomb near the Strug Forest, but experts concluded that due to the position and the intertwining of the victims as well as the condition of the bodies, it was not possible to perform a completely precise investigation.\n\nThus, there is no forensic examination that resulted in data on 2,500 to 4,500 Jasenovac victims, conducted during 1947 and 1948, as stated in this revisionist text.\n\nIt is also indicative that this article misses the opportunity to mention the actual forensic research conducted during 1964 by a commission of experts composed of: Alojz Šercelj, Vida Brodar, Anton Pogačnik and Srboljub Živanović. These researches resulted in the discovery of the remains of a total of 284 victims, in 7 probes (of which 197 were in one grave).\n\nThis extremely revisionist article also mentions various established and/or estimated numbers of people killed in the system of the concentration and death camp in Jasenovac, as follows: 59,000 (census of victims of the Second World War conducted in 1964), 72,000 and 77,000, which at one point represented achieved result of supplementing the number of victims based on the revision of the already mentioned census from 1964 which is conducted by the Museum of Genocide Victims.\n\nThe Museum of Genocide Victims uses this opportunity to emphasize that its databases contain data on almost 90,000 identified victims of the Jasenovac concentration and death camp system which currently represents only the smallest possible, but not the final number of all those killed at that execution site.\n\nAs the research of the experts of the Museum of Genocide Victims, which is conducted according to the same methodology as it has been done for decades in Yad Vashem, continues, it is to be expected that the number of identified Jasenovac victims will be corrected in the coming years. The estimated total number of Jasenovac victims is, unfortunately, far higher than the one that historical science will ever be able to identify with the precise data.\n\nThe same revisionist text also mentions the number of 99,000 victims of the system of the concentration and death camp in Jasenovac which at one time was an estimation of the USHMM, but also a scientifically completely unknown estimation of about 250,000 victims. Finally, the same text contains some, alleged, number of 800,000 killed at all Jasenovac execution sites.\n\nThe Museum of Genocide Victims possesses no information that Yad Vashem demanded \"original documents from Jasenovac\" from the Republic of Serbia during the last decade of the previous century since historical science does not know that there is a significant corpus of material other than the one Antun Miletić has already published in four books (three of which as early as the late 1980s of that same century).\n\nIt is also possible that this revisionist-intoned article refers to the evacuated museum material from the Jasenovac Memorial Centre (Republic of Croatia) which was located in Bosanska Dubica (Bosnia and Herzegovina) during the 1990s.\n\nHowever, that is a question to which some others can and should give, but not the Republic of Serbia.\n\nMoreover, in 1997, the Museum of Genocide Victims submitted to Yad Vashem a list with the names of 52,500 Jews killed in Yugoslavia during World War II (of whom 10,500 lost their lives in Jasenovac), which is included in the official Yad Vashem list of Holocaust victims.\n\nFollowing the ridiculous, pseudo-scientific, anti-civilization and shameful logic which in this revisionist article denies the number of victims in Jasenovac solely on the grounds that there are no adequate forensic data (except for 2,500 to 4,500 victims, as the author falsely claims), we could ask a question as to whether it is possible to deny in the same way the number of 1,200,000 to 1,500,000 killed in Auschwitz since there is no forensic evidence for that claim either?\n\nIt would be interesting if the author of this revisionist text, denying the number of victims in Jasenovac, answered the question regarding where 30,000 Jews who lived within the teritorryof the Independent State of Croatia came from?\n\nThe Museum of Genocide Victims reminds that, according to available data, about 7,500 of them were killed in German concentration camps.\n\nWhat happened to the remaining 22,500 of them?\n\nWhere did they \"disappear\"?\n\nThrough many years of research by its experts, the Museum of Genocide Victims has shown that between 18,000 and 19,000 Jews from the Independent State of Croatia were killed in the Jasenovac concentration and death camp system and that their share in total civilian casualties was many times higher than their population (10.23 times higher).\n\nExperts from the Museum of Genocide Victims continuously clearly separate the suffering in the Holocaust victims from the victims of the Genocide committed against the Serbian people on the territory of the Independent State of Croatia.\n\nThe research of the Museum of Genocide Victims continuously emphasizes that the loss of Jews in the concentration and death camp system in Jasenovac, given the representation in the population, was realistically 13 times greater than the loss of Serbs in the camp, which refutes the absurd claim that \" \"Serbia is trying to oust Jews from the Holocaust and replace them with Serbs.\"\n\nDear Mr. Katz,\n\nPointing out only the most obvious untruths presented in the article published in the Jerusalem Post, Museum of Genocide Victims points out historical facts, but at the same time calls on everyone to treat the victims of the Second World War with full responsibility and reverence.\n\nOne can rightly ask how it could have happened that an internationally relevant daily newspaper such as Jerusalem Post published a distinctly revisionist text that essentially denied the specific character and tragic consequences of the existence of the Jasenovac death and concentration camp system?\n\nMuseum of Genocide Victims points out that, among numerous others, even three Presidents of the Republic of Croatia publicly stated that a Genocide committed against the Serbs had been performed by the state system of the Independent State of Croatia between 1941 and 1945.\n\nHaving that in mind, the one and only disgraceful mockery is that the author of this revisionist article tries to deny this tragic historical fact.\n\nFollowing such logic, is it possible to expect that an equally revisionist-intoned text written by David Irving, which denies the existence of the Auschwitz death and concentration camp system, will soon be found on the pages of your paper?\n\nDear Mr. Katz,\n\nMuseum of Genocide Victims publicly and resolutely rejects and condemns the untrue claims contained in the above mentioned revisionist article which attacks historical truth and dignified memory of the victims of World War II and request from you to publish this reaction so that the Jerusalem Post readers would be aware of what really happened. in Jasenovac - one of the largest and most monstrous execution sites in all of Europe during the Second World War.\n\nBest regards,\n\nDejan Ristić\n\nhistorian\n\nMuseum of Genocide Victims Acting Director\n\nBelgrade,\n\nAugust 16th 2021\n\n20 May 2021\n\nMinister Selaković presented the new e-Consulate service\n\nA new service of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs \"e-Consulate\" was presented in Belgrade today, intended for foreign citizens who apply for a visa and aspire to come to Serbia to work.\n\nOn that occasion, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Serbia Nikola Selakovic said that this service was one of the indicators of good development of our country, which, as he pointed out, was becoming a magnet for serious foreign companies, which brought a large number of workers from other countries to work in Serbia.\n\n\"Not to be pretentious, but completely realistic, this service represents a turning point in the functioning of our system. E-Consulate and digitalization of the procedure for issuing work visas for foreign citizens who want to work in Serbia, is the first electronic service offered by the Foreign Ministry, and I can promise you that this is indeed our first, but by no means the last e-service\", Selakovic emphasized.\n\nThe Head of Serbian diplomacy pointed out that \"e-Consulate\" reflected the modernization of an extremely important segment of the activities of diplomatic and consular missions of Serbia, and that we were actually talking about something that was essential for the further development processes of our country.\n\nThe Minister recalled that, when the President of the Republic visited the construction site of the Moravian Corridor, he was told that some construction works were delayed because Bechtel company was not issued work visas on time.\n\n“The moment we saw that and heard the President, I alerted the services in the Ministry. We were surprised, as we knew that the issuance of visas in Turkey had a good dynamic, and then we determined that it was actually workers from Bangladesh who applied for a visa through our Embassy in India, where we have a problem with staff shortage”, the Minister explained.\n\nAs he added, this is a demanding and laborious task, each of our employees had to receive the documentation on paper, check it, then request additional information, and only then forward it.\n\n\"Today, this has been fantastically perfected for our consular officers, all that documentation is submitted in electronic form. We used to have two filters to check the documentation, now we actually have three. And the work is significantly more efficient\", Selakovic pointed out.\n\nAs he emphasized, this is a service which was promised less than four months ago and it becomes available on Monday, in 95 diplomatic and consular missions of Serbia, i.e. in all our embassies and consulates general.\n\nThe biggest result of that endeavor, the Minister pointed out, apart from the advantage it would bring in the future work, was the fact that it was not a project of one state body, but a joint endeavor of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, IT and eGovernment Office, General Secretariat of the Government, Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of Labor, Employment, Veterans and Social Affairs, National Employment Service.\n\n“We did an extremely good job in record time. This is to the pride of our Ministry, to the pride of the entire state. I am convinced that in the period ahead, we will further modernize our affairs and make Serbia one of the few countries that has such mechanisms and such state-of-the-art provision of consular services\", Selakovic said.\n\nSpeaking about the \"e-Consulate\" portal itself, the Minister explained that there is a cartoon of Nikola Tesla and the building of the old railway station with one crane, which actually symbolizes a historical fact - that Tesla was in Belgrade in the year when it was built.\n\n\"Today it is the place behind which the Belgrade of the future is rising, and what we managed to do together is an indicator of something that is the future of Serbia, the development of artificial intelligence, IT and creating conditions for more people to live and arrive here in Serbia in the future seeking good life and employment\", concluded the Minister.\n\nThe Director of the Office for IT and eGovernment, Mihailo Jovanovic, said that this was the first time that e-services were focused on foreign citizens, which was the case with our citizens so far.\n\nIn the period from 1 January 2019 to 17 May this year, the most applications for Serbian visas were submitted at the Embassy in Beijing, 6,766 applications, then in New Delhi - 2,973, Shanghai 2,115, Tokyo 1,798, and Cairo 1,756.\n\nIn that period, 1,270 requests were submitted in Algiers, 1,095 in Jakarta, and 1,077 in Beirut.\n\nIn terms of their nationality, Serbian D visa for employment is most requested by citizens of China - 9,516 applications, followed by India 1,955, and Ukraine - 673.\n\n24 March 2021\n\nMarking the Day of Remembrance of the victims of the NATO aggression\n\nPresident of the Republic of Serbia Aleksandar Vucic made a statement on the occasion of marking the Day of Remembrance of the victims of the NATO aggression.\n\n\"Your Holiness, distinguished Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, distinguished Speakers of the National Assemblies of the Republic of Serbia and the Republic of Srpska, distinguished Prime Ministers of the Republic of Serbia and the Republic of Srpska, distinguished Ministers of both Governments, dear guests and friends, representatives of the Serbian People from Montenegro, North Macedonia, Croatia, thank you for the fact that we are all together tonight and that the Serbian spirit is unbreakable and invincible.\n\nOne child a day and a little more than that. That is the most difficult, sickening and painful number of the NATO aggression from 1999. Killed, stopped, guilty of nothing, having committed no sin, without the right to defence, without the right to justice and without the right to life.\n\nNo one has ever been held accountable for this crime, a crime greater than a crime. No one, for the 2,500 killed civilians, but also soldiers and policemen who were only guilty of guarding, protecting themselves and their homes. No one has ever been held accountable for more than 6,000 persons injured.\n\nEven today, 22 years after the aggression, it is not possible to explain that, there is no universal justification, despite all the work done to that end, there is no reason, it makes no sense, and only names remain, as eternal as sin.\n\nMiljana Milic, fifteen years old,\n\nVladimir Milic, twelve years old,\n\nMiomir Mladenovic, fourteen years old,\n\nDragan Dimic, three years old,\n\nJulijana Brudar, ten years,\n\nOlivera Maksimovic, twelve years old,\n\nMiroslav Knezevic, thirteen years old,\n\nDajana Pavlovic, five years old,\n\nStevan Pavlovic, eight years old,\n\nMarko Simic, two years old,\n\nMilica Rakic, three years old,\n\nIvan Ivancic, seven years old,\n\nMarko Ivanovic, three years old...\n\nAnd the list goes on, eighty nine names, not only Serbian ones...\n\nThe senselessness of sheer killing did not choose. Sixteen children, aged two to seventeen, from the Ahmetaj and Hasani families, were killed in a convoy returning home to Prizren.\n\nIn one headline in the West, this was simply explained as a \"tragic mistake\". The deaths of Marko Roglic, Milan Ignjatovic, Gordana Nikolic, Irena Mitic, Milica Stojanovic, Bojana Tosovic, Branimir Stanijanovic, our Sanja Milenkovic...could not expect or get even such an explanation.\n\nThose deaths were not tragic, for those who caused them, much less a mistake. It was just an excuse, a miserable excuse.\n\nThey were a result of intent and a clear decision, as a severe judgment against one country, its people, its children.\n\nAnd that is why today we will refrain from speculation in giving a name to everything that happened during the spring of 1999. Because a crime happened, a heinous and terrible one. And it was an aggression, not a bombing, not an intervention, not a campaign, not an operation. An aggression is what happened. An attack on a sovereign country, without a decision of the United Nations, without a sufficient reason that would justify attacking the then Yugoslavia or a neighbouring or NATO country.\n\nNo one was attacked by Serbia or the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia at that time. They attacked us, with one goal. To defeat us, to keep killing us, and in the end to take away a part of our territory.\n\nAnd no matter how much we analyze things today, no matter how harsh and critical we are towards ourselves, our policy and leadership at the time, it is clear that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Serbia were left with almost no choice then. The choice was horrible, either the loss of territory and people on the one hand, or the complete disappearance of the Serbian state, morals, honour, Serbian spirit, names and surnames. And we could not help but lose. Nineteen big ones attacked one small country, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. They attacked both Serbia and Montenegro. And even when they don't talk about it today, in one of the two independent countries, those are the facts. And that small country, and that small nation, to all nineteen of them so great and powerful, held a lesson in what matters most - honour, morals and love for freedom that a nation can have.\n\nYes, justice, lest we forget justice. All those nineteen great ones today still silently talk about their military success, avoid answering questions, while - can you imagine, one small, only numerically small Serbian people, that small but magnificent nation, with sadness, tears in their eyes, proudly remembers their resistance and struggle against the nineteen cruel and arrogant ones.\n\nWe lost a lot, we lost our fathers, brothers, spouses, children, but the honour and Serbian heart are still there, to protect Serbia, which is eternal and indestructible.\n\nWe lost children, we lost people, we lost control over a large part of the territory, we lost billions because of the destroyed infrastructure and economy.\n\nAnd all that was left for us was the body of a tortured, destroyed country, a country in disintegration, mutilated, looted, wounded, deserted, and guilty, condemned for everything that happened not only in the 1990s, but throughout history.\n\nA country that, even ten years after the aggression, did not have the strength to stand up, rise to its feet, and do anything but be silent, or bow its head and obediently apologize, for everything, even for its dead, even for its murdered children.\n\nToday, it is no longer that failed, tortured, devastated, mutilated Serbia.\n\nToday, it is Serbia, which has found its strength and its pride again.\n\nSerbia, which calls things by their real names.\n\nSerbia, which turned its back on war and defeats, and started working.\n\nSerbia, which rose to stand on its own feet and has a voice of its own.\n\nSerbia, which, even when they don't believe it, they listen to. Which is capable, which is growing, and is no longer part of the problem. Serbia, which is and will be, at least we will do our best to this end, the very solution that enables the entire region to live in peace and understanding.\n\nAnd that Serbia, today, when there are still many more bombs in the world than vaccines, sends not bombs, but precisely those vaccines to the region. Today, it is ready to produce them as well, and in just a few months we will do just that, but not only for ourselves, but also for others, for the entire Balkans.\n\nWe are ready, and we are willing to help.\n\nWe are not ready to be and we will not be silent, nor be humiliated again.\n\nWe draw the right to that not only from the victims we had, but also from the fact that we stopped looking at others only a long time ago, and looking for fault and guilt only in them, and not sometimes in ourselves as well.\n\nWe looked at each other and admitted. Every loss, every defeat and every crime that someone committed in our name, every failure and every wrong policy.\n\nAnd we are no longer doing anything that could endanger anyone.\n\nWe continue to work and work, and grow more and more, gaining strength with only one goal - to be the best in economy and education, health, in culture, science, sports...\n\nAnd we want to be safe, on our own. We want our army to be much stronger than it was in 1999. So that we never again face a situation that someone is killing our children, destroying the country, or expelling our people.\n\nWe want to remain free, to decide our own destiny, and for no one to take everything away from us ever again, and give us nothing.\n\nAnd that nothing today, and I will repeat it as much as necessary, is the idea of some great, powerful ones, but also those who serve them, the idea that \"Kosovo\" should recognize us, so that we could recognize \"Kosovo\".\n\nWe do not need that recognition. And Serbia will not allow you to walk over our victims, our history, our past, but also to walk over our future. You will get the answer of reasonable, kind and responsible people. We need a compromise. We need all the obligations that we and Pristina have assumed to be fulfilled, but only we have fulfilled them so far.\n\nAnd this is not our whim. It is not a phantasmagoria about a Serbian world that we want to create.\n\nEven today, when they threaten us with the formation of a Greater Albania, when they say that the Community of Serb Municipalities is not going to happen, it is ours to be calm, to take care of our people in Kosovo and Metohija, but to send a clear message to all those great, powerful ones that we are not as weak as we were, that we will be able to preserve what is our own, not touching anything that belongs to anyone else. After all, Serbia is not and will not be but a handful of oats that every crow from the whole wide world can eat. As for those who used the strength and power of the nineteen arrogant and cruel ones, I only ask them not to threaten us. Please, please, don't threaten us. They should not think that Serbia is broken and that it will not have the strength to respond. Please, please, our Albanian neighbours, do not threaten us. And we ask all others, who have demonstrated their cruelty towards Serbia, not to help you in that. That is all we are asking and nothing more.\n\nAnd we will respond to calls for peace, calls for compromise, and always with good will, because we do not want to have children killed again. And we do not want the children of others to suffer again. But do not underestimate Serbia, and do not look at Serbia with the same eyes as you did in 1999.\n\nToday, Serbia is much stronger, much more powerful. Today, Serbia is a united country of togetherness, not a divided one. Today, Serbia is incomparably stronger and better in every aspect than it was in 1999, from the economy to our army. And we will never threaten anyone, we just ask you and request from you to respect us and nothing more.\n\nToday, we are building roads that will connect us, among ourselves, with the region and with the world. Until the end of the year, we will work on eight motorways, on eight routes in the entire Balkans, not only Serbia, eight roads of peace and cooperation.\n\nOnly a crazy person would trade this for war, for dead children, for demolition and new loss. And yes, we want to have the closest relations with everyone who took part in the aggression against our beautiful Serbia, we have forgiven a long time ago, but no, we will never forget. And don't ask us to. That one day, every year, we will remind both ourselves and you. The nineteen of you, the most powerful, strongest, greatest in terms of might and force, but not so much when it comes to honour and morality. We will keep remind you and ourselves, just so it would never happen again. Not to us only, but to none other freedom-loving people in the world.\n\nAnd if we have an offer, today it reads as follows: we are ready to make the whole Balkans a winner, for everyone to win, as long as no one tries to make Serbs the only losers.\n\nAnd the path to this goal is not difficult at all.\n\nWe just need to respect and understand each other and not try to humiliate each other.\n\nAnd not to touch into what everyone paid the highest and bloodies price for. Freedom. And we, Serbs, know the price of freedom.\n\nInto our right to have it, to keep it and to remember all the victims who are part of it.\n\nAnd our defeats, our lives and our children are built into ours. And the lives of our heroic pilots, and our giants from Kosare and Pastrik, and our children, innocent, completely innocent, and only guilty of living in Serbia.\n\nThis is too high a price to be quiet about it.\n\nBecause that would mean that we are ready for another defeat, for another humiliation.\n\nAnd we are not.\n\nAnd when all go quiet, we will keep repeating.\n\nA child a day, and a little more. This was how much you killed us. In an aggression that even you did not understand why you carried it out.\n\nAnd we will keep repeating this, just so it does not happen to us again.\n\nWith special reverence, we are fulfilling our obligation to pay tribute to all innocent Serbian victims who laid their lives on the altar of the homeland, both civilians and our heroic soldiers and policemen, the heroes of Kosare, Prizren, Mitrovica.\n\nToday, for us Serbs, life in Kosovo and Metohija is like Via Dolorosa, using their last strength on the road to Golgotha, but we would not be Serbs if we were not capable to \"exist in a terrible place\".\n\nAnd today, tonight, I can conclude with one important sentence. On the soil of Europe, there was, and today is stronger than ever, an indomitable, unwavering, unconquerable and never conquered Serbia.\n\nMay eternal glory be to all the victims of the NATO aggression and let us all exclaim together - long live free and proud Serbia\", President Vucic said.\n\nSource:www.predsednik.rs\n\nPhoto:www.predsednik.rs\n\nPreservation of peace, taking care of the health and better living standard are key for Serbia in 2021, underlined President of the Republic Aleksandar Vucic, convinced that even though the completion of this ambitious and by no means easy task will be anything but straightforward, best results can be achieved by working in concert with the Government, while ensuring security and a future of certainty for the citizens.\n\nThe President said that Serbia has set for itself great and ambitious goals for the next year, notwithstanding the complex international and regional circumstances, and that it will endeavour to fully preserve peace and stability in the region and the country, while safeguarding the vital national and state interests.\n\n\"Serbia will remain on the course of a winning policy - the policy of stability\", President Vucic said and stressed that our country remains on the European integration path and that it will carefully foster its friendship with Russia and China, while building a friendship with the United States as well.\n\nAccording to the President, Serbia will continue to pursue a winning policy, with the country itself as a top priority, i.e., a policy that will enable Serbia to continue being one of the top three countries in Europe in terms of growth rate in the next two years.\n\nA precondition for that, the President noted, is to crack down on criminal groups, but also to ensure even bigger investments in the police and army forces.\n\n\"Serbia is the country that recorded the highest growth in Europe in 2020\", the President pointed out at the annual press conference and added that he expects to conclude a new arrangement with the IMF, as well as that Serbia, by the end of next year or early 2022, will raise its credit rating to an \"investment\" one, which will put our country's rating on par with the most developed EU countries.\n\nAs the greatest success in 2020, Vucic noted that Serbia will end the year with the highest growth rate in Europe, which, as he said, is expected to be from minus 0.75 percent to minus one.\n\n\"I am proud to be the President of a country that is the European champion in terms of GDP\", Vucic pointed out and added that German Chancellor Angela Merkel was also pleased with Serbia's success.\n\nAccording to President Vucic, this result will encourage Serbia to accelerate its European path, while continuing friendships with those who did not turn their backs on Serbia when it was at its darkest hour, namely Russia and China.\n\nThe President pointed out that the activities to attract foreign investors will continue, then that work will be done on investments in agriculture, primarily the food industry, new machinery, and digitalization of agriculture.\n\nPresident Vucic also emphasized that the goal is for salaries in the public sector to average between 560 and 570 euros by the end of the year.
