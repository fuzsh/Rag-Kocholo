        "text": "In 2021, Challenge 22 continued to encourage people worldwide to adopt a plant-based diet â and over 125,000 people accepted the challenge! Among them are more than 60,000 Spanish speakers from around the world, who enjoyed the support of our amazing team in the Spanish-language challenge. Challenge 22 is recognized worldwide as one of the most effective projects for introducing people to veganism in a supportive and positive environment. All this is only possible thanks to our wonderful volunteers worldwide â from the Netherlands, Vietnam, Germany, India, the USA, and everywhere in between. Our Challenge 22 mentors do incredible work helping people experience a vegan lifestyle.\n\nAnd the Challenge 22 community just keeps on growing! This year in the Challenge 22 Community Program, we continued to support organizations worldwide as they develop their own local vegan challenges, following the format of Challenge 22. We collaborated with 14 organizations, and those challenges welcomed 65,000 new participants in 2021! Projects in Thailand, Romania, Chile, Nigeria, and Vietnam are just some of those joining us on our mission to show the world the benefits of veganism!\n\nThis year our education project reached about 20,000 teenagers and adults with our lectures and workshops, both via Zoom and in person! In addition to lectures in schools and youth movements, we gave talks to employees of huge companies like Google and Intel, the Ministry of Health, representatives of Israeli embassies at the Foreign Ministry conference, teachers in training courses of the Ministry of Education, education students, pre-military preparatory students, regional climate conference participants, and more. Participants enjoyed one of our two educational programs: Share the World dealing with animal rights, and Change Begins on Your Plate â experiential educational sessions on sustainable nutrition, which we run in collaboration with the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Life & Environment. Our program doesnât just raise awareness and spark conversation on these subjects â we also showcase just how delicious vegan food is by providing vegan meals in class and holding an entirely plant-based ‘MasterChefâ competition.\n\nWe also shared lesson plans on animal rights and sustainable diets for special events (Animal Rights Day, Earth Day, and Tu BiShvat, when we encourage schools to celebrate ecological awareness focused on sustainable food patterns). More than 7,000 teachers used these lesson plans!\n\nWe continued to invest in preparing and distributing lesson plans for teachers through our Live Act website and other channels, and we reached over 100,000 users. One of our significant achievements was launching a page of lesson plans in Arabic.\n\nWe worked with decision-makers in parliament: We participated in Education Committee discussions and promoted education to reduce animal-based food consumption. The committee’s chair, Sharren Haskel, called on Ministry of Education representatives to add this topic to the curriculum! We have also been campaigning for the removal of school petting zoos due to the harm caused to the animals. The Animal Welfare Advisory Committee to the Government has added this to the recommendations submitted to the Minister of Education.\n\nWe promoted over 150 articles and items across the media: on television, radio, and digital and print press. And weâre making waves on social media â on Facebook, we published over 100 videos, and our Facebook, Instagram, and Challenge 22 pages combined reached more than 60 million(!) people. We posted 20 videos on YouTube, mostly in our unique series What’s Up With..?, and Vegan Life, and we reached 1.2 million views. And we’re also on Tiktok â where weâve posted about 200 videos and got 3 million views, wow!\n\nThis year, Animals Now websites had over 3.7 million views! The Israeli Vegetarian and Vegan website, one of our leading projects, reached over 1.7 million users and over 2.7 million total views this year. 1,500 Israelis who visited the site and enjoyed our recipes also signed up for Challenge 22.\n\nAnd although 2021 was a challenging year, we took to the streets to speak up for animals. We spoke to people at public events, at universities, we took part in the Pride Marches in Jerusalem and Haifa, joined the Climate March, represented veganism at a Health and Fitness Festival, and a variety of other large events. At these events, over 400 people signed up for Challenge 22, and over 1,000 people said they would change their eating habits after talking to us!"
