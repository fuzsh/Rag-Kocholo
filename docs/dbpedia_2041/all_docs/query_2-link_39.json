        "text": "It’s been about +65 days since the start of 2024, & today, some hours after arriving in Singapore 🛬 , I felt it was the perfect moment to share what I’ve been up to lately. A lot has happened. Good news, new encounters, & positive energy. So, here's a brief update on my recent endeavours! 🙌🏼 1. Venture Café Fukuoka: The pre-opening event of Venture Café Fukuoka (13 Feb 2024, a day before my final thesis defence! 🫣) was an enriching experience where I had the opportunity to be a student volunteer! After attending sessions in Boston last year, it was a pleasure to finally connect with people from various Venture Cafés across Japan as well. One standout encounter was with a Tokyo-based ambassador whose project resonated closely with mine. It was eye-opening to understand the different pains of both issues, the stark difference between the two environments (Fukuoka vs Tokyo) & so forth ⚡️. This event underscored to me, once more, the importance of seizing opportunities as they arise. After all, opportunities rarely present themselves; sometimes, you have to take the initiative & create them. 🚪 2. Degree Project: On the academic front, I recently wrapped up my degree project (deatjapan.com), a.k.a. my graduation thesis! From in-person interviews & field research to online questionnaires & design prototypes, it has been a long, gruelling past few months... 😮💨 But, the journey has only just begun! A little after the final presentation, my team & I also participated in the University's Hult Prize. I'm gratified by the acknowledgement received, including three gold badges 🎖 from the judges (a panel of 5), securing a close 2nd! 3. 冷デリー (rei-deli) | READILY: Another highlight was my involvement with READILY & the Final Challenge & Creation (C&C) Presentation. Presenting in front of esteemed judges at Hakata was a significant milestone. I've been diligently fine-tuning our efforts & ideas, learning valuable lessons in managing finances, branding, & even bringing innovative concepts to life. Most notably, organizing tasting events & having direct conversations with the community 🍱. It has been a rewarding experience. Through READILY, we aim to make more genres of halal food accessible in Japan, a reality. (Website: reideli.com) 4. [New Role!]: 🚀 Lastly, I’m honoured to announce that I'll be serving as the Community Manager at the Fukuoka Startup Collective (FSCO) & Manabu Community. I'm extremely grateful for the chance to be at the forefront of the foreign startup scene in Fukuoka, which has exposed me to diverse perspectives & industries in & out of Japan. I'm looking forward to organising events, delving deeper into industry dynamics, empowering others through content creation, & harnessing the power of networking. These past few months have been nothing short of transformative. I’m excited to see what the future holds! Here's to more mistakes, learning, & growth! Not to forget, spending more time with my loved ones here on homeground! 💛\n\n𝙌𝙍𝙀𝘾 𝙀𝙣𝙩𝙧𝙚𝙥𝙧𝙚𝙣𝙚𝙪𝙧𝙨𝙝𝙞𝙥 𝘽𝙤𝙤𝙩𝙘𝙖𝙢𝙥 𝘿𝙖𝙮 4 & 5 | 23.09.10 - 11 | 𝘽𝙤𝙨𝙩𝙤𝙣, 𝙈𝙖𝙨𝙨𝙖𝙘𝙝𝙪𝙨𝙚𝙩𝙩𝙨 A little behind with the posting but, these two days were devoted to gearing up for the upcoming pitches scheduled in the week. Teams utilized this time to conduct in-depth customer interviews and craft their pitch decks. On September 10th, we had the privilege of speaking to Zijian Reddix, during which we explored various topics, delved deep into our team's idea, compared the problem landscapes in Japan and the United States, and explored potential collaboration opportunities. Thank you, Zane! We wish you all the best in your journey and look forward to sharing positive updates on our project. The idea was subjected to a first round of evaluation at Babson College, where we were fortunate to receive feedback from students enrolled in both the undergraduate and MBA programs. Following this, we had the opportunity to sit in a class by Yasuhiro (Yasu) Yamakawa, Ph.D.. During the session, we delved into various topics, including Entrepreneurial Thought & Action, Prediction & CreAction, and Ellsberg's hypothesis. There’s always something charming about classes by Yasuhiro (Yasu) Yamakawa, Ph.D., and I’m really glad that I could experience it in person. The day concluded with a guided tour of the school and a networking session. A heartfelt thank you to our wonderful guides for showcasing their stunning campus—truly breathtaking. Last but not least, to every person I had the pleasure to talk to yesterday, it was a great honour and I hope to see you flourish and succeed in whatever field you choose to pursue. Wishing all continued success, and I hope that we can meet again sometime in the near future! 𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗧𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗮𝘄𝗮𝘆𝘀: 1. Fall in love with the problem, not the solution Successful entrepreneurship should always begin with a deep connection to challenges and the genuine needs of people. This was emphasized through concepts like emotional intelligence and empathy. Learning to be more people-centric ensures that the solutions we aim to create have real demand and value. Never create a solution for a market that doesn't exist. 2. Prediction, Risk & Uncertainty The concepts of \"known\", \"unknown\", and \"unknowable\" are highly relevant for decision-making. Not all cases will allow us to apply market trends, customer preferences, and known data. This is where risk assessment and management come into play. Financial projections are necessary to address uncertainties. However, there's also the concept of \"the unknowable.\" You may have expected chocolate in the bag, but instead, you found odd-shaped objects. How will you create value in such a random situation? In cases like this, we must think about resilience, adaptability, or even creativity to generate something new. 3. Tomorrow is not promised. Live today preparing for a better tomorrow. Nothing is guaranteed.\n\n𝙌𝙍𝙀𝘾 𝙀𝙣𝙩𝙧𝙚𝙥𝙧𝙚𝙣𝙚𝙪𝙧𝙨𝙝𝙞𝙥 𝘽𝙤𝙤𝙩𝙘𝙖𝙢𝙥 𝘿𝙖𝙮 3 | 23.09.09 | 𝘽𝙤𝙨𝙩𝙤𝙣, 𝙈𝙖𝙨𝙨𝙖𝙘𝙝𝙪𝙨𝙚𝙩𝙩𝙨 𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗧𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗮𝘄𝗮𝘆𝘀: 1) Believe in yourself, otherwise, no one else will. Someone told me, \"Everyone here's just faking it til' they make it\". Confidence is key. To do that, not only do you have to convince others that you're capable and qualified, but you've got to convince yourself. It might seem counter-intuitive to staying humble but, after all, how can we expect others to trust us or believe in our ideas if we don't believe in ourselves first? Confidence, tempered with humility, is the key to gaining trust, both from within and from those around us. Don't ever forget that. 2) Not all ideas have to be original. Learn how different systems work in other communities and see if they can be adopted in yours. Not every idea needs to be groundbreaking or entirely original. Sometimes, the path to progress might just lie in the wisdom of adaptation. The answer could just be recognising what works elsewhere, and integrating those lessons back into our own contexts. Themes like transportation, parking, food allergies or even healthcare. Why is Country A more advanced? How are they more advanced? There must be a reason why something works or doesn't work, we've simply got to uncover it. 3) Stay healthy. As a rule of thumb, nothing can be done if you're not well. To everyone, remember to stay healthy, drink lots of water (though I myself still struggle with this), and be kind to your body. P.S. Big big big shoutout to Khyteang Lim for lunch! Thank you for giving us such valuable insights on everything, from your journey so far to navigating your way around Boston's ecosystem. Super grateful, thanks for the wonderful chat!\n\n𝙌𝙍𝙀𝘾 𝙀𝙣𝙩𝙧𝙚𝙥𝙧𝙚𝙣𝙚𝙪𝙧𝙨𝙝𝙞𝙥 𝘽𝙤𝙤𝙩𝙘𝙖𝙢𝙥 𝘿𝙖𝙮 2 | 23.09.08 | 𝘽𝙤𝙨𝙩𝙤𝙣, 𝙈𝙖𝙨𝙨𝙖𝙘𝙝𝙪𝙨𝙚𝙩𝙩𝙨 𝗔𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀: 1) Tour at LabCentral: LabCentral is the premier shared lab community for innovative biotech startups. (https://lnkd.in/g_qF7zjA) > Q & A Session with John Vroom from Kano Therapeutics, a biotech startup specialising in DNA nanotechnology 2) Attend MIT delta v Demo Day: \"MIT delta v is MIT’s student venture accelerator, providing a capstone educational opportunity for MIT student entrepreneurs that prepares them to hit escape velocity and launch into the real world ... MIT delta v culminates in Demo Day, typically held at the beginning of the school year\" (https://lnkd.in/gMurggPq) 𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗧𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗮𝘄𝗮𝘆𝘀: 1) Take action. Find opportunities. This isn't limited to finding incubators or accelerators, but finding the right community. It's important to recognize that not everyone in your network needs to be a part of your company; some play pivotal roles as mentors, offering valuable advice and motivation. Coming from Fukuoka, a young and growing startup hub, stepping into Boston, a startup powerhouse, was incredible. In spite of fire competition, you've got to harness that unwavering determination and transform it into a blazing fire that breathes life into your dreams. 2) An object at rest, remains at rest (Newton's 1st Law of Motion ... or Entrepreneurship?) The last instance I distinctly recall memorising this was during my HL Physics examination back in 2019. I was reminded of this during demo day. An entrepreneur, much like any object, persists in inertia until influenced by an external force. But what is this external force? To avoid remaining in motion with that same speed, in the same direction, that leads to nowhere, there must be disruption. The world, I've come to realize again and again, is profoundly vast with boundless opportunities waiting to be explored. The article by Dominick M. Belfiore explains it best. (https://lnkd.in/gqRTNyhw) 3) Gain experience. Actively speak to those with more experience. This journey has brought me into contact with an incredibly diverse array of individuals, spanning generations and backgrounds. A special shoutout to the Japanese community at MIT, graduate students from MIT's SDM program, entrepreneurs from the Venture Cafe and even individuals from the program. These encounters have been a poignant reminder that life is different for all. I've been on a constant quest for that \"ideal\" path for an aspiring entrepreneur. The reality is, there's no perfect answer. Whether it's pursuing further studies now or later, launching a business in the present or postponing it. Opportunities are different for all, and it's as important to make the best of the hands we are dealt.\n\n𝙌𝙍𝙀𝘾 𝙀𝙣𝙩𝙧𝙚𝙥𝙧𝙚𝙣𝙚𝙪𝙧𝙨𝙝𝙞𝙥 𝘽𝙤𝙤𝙩𝙘𝙖𝙢𝙥 𝘿𝙖𝙮 1 | 23.09.07 | 𝘽𝙤𝙨𝙩𝙤𝙣, 𝙈𝙖𝙨𝙨𝙖𝙘𝙝𝙪𝙨𝙚𝙩𝙩𝙨 Hi everyone! I'm currently in Boston for the \"Entrepreneurship Bootcamp\" organised by QREC (Robert T. Huang Entrepreneurship Center of Kyushu University). In brief, it is a practical entrepreneurship program implemented in the United States that aims to foster world-class entrepreneurs capable of leading new business or innovation creation projects. We will be spending about 9 days learning from different key players in the startup ecosystem, attending demo days, speaking to investors, VCs and even having a shot at pitching. Being a part of this bootcamp has been a huge privilege, and I'm incredibly grateful for this opportunity. I've decided to document my daily takeaways and insights from each day of the program and share them on LinkedIn. While it is more of a personal journal, I hope that by sharing my experience, I can inspire others interested in entrepreneurship, the start-up world or even this program in particular. Without further ado, let's begin! 𝗔𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀: 1) Visit to MassChallenge MassChallenge is a non-profit organisation that connects startups, experts, corporations, and communities to grow and transform businesses and economies. Their unique equity-free model allows them to accelerate high-impact startups from non-traditional backgrounds. A heartfelt thank you to Burhan M for his generous sharing of insights and experiences prior to, and after joining the company despite his hectic schedule. Thank you for providing valuable information about the accelerator programs worldwide. Notably, the Bridge to MassChallenge Japan, a national startup competition in collaboration with METI (Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry). We extend our warmest wishes to him for continued success and impact in his endeavours. 2) Thursday Gathering at Venture Café Cambridge: MATCHMAKING FOR SUCCESS What an incredibly humbling and eye-opening experience! To say the least, I was lucky to have crossed paths with some of the most accomplished, innovative and inspiring individuals I've ever had the privilege to meet. Many of them have ventured fearlessly into the challenging world of startups, weathering both failures and celebrating successes along the way. Each person had a unique and compelling story to share, and I was deeply honoured to hear them all. Attending this networking event marked my first foray into such an enriching environment, and it left an indelible impression on me. The opportunity to immerse myself in dynamic discussions with this community of innovators was nothing short of exhilarating. Their unwavering grit, unyielding discipline, and sheer perseverance in the pursuit of their dreams were nothing less than admirable. Thank you so much to everyone who made my evening that day. It was really lovely meeting all of you, and I really do hope that we can stay in touch. All the best!"
