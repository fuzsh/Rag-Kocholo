        "text": "Kachol Lavan\n\nLeader: Benny Gantz\n\nCurrent Seats: 35\n\nRecommended candidate for prime minister in the Twenty-First Knesset: Benny Gantz\n\nSupports/Opposes Two-State Solution: Unclear (leans supportive)\n\nKachol Lavan is the largest opposition ticket, a merger of Benny Gantz’s Hosen Leyisrael, Yair Lapid’s Yesh Atid, and Moshe Ya’alon’s Telem. The faction is primarily seen as a vehicle to unseat Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, with its preferred option being a unity government with a post-Netanyahu Likud. While the party is broadly centrist, its ideological underpinnings are difficult to place precisely, particularly as they concern the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Gabi Ashkenazi (former IDF chief of staff and the list’s number four) and Yair Lapid support a two-state solution. Benny Gantz has advocated steps to disengage from the Palestinians without a complete withdrawal from the occupied territories, including policies which could be compatible with both one- and two-state proposals. Moshe Ya’alon (a former IDF chief of staff and number three on the list) publicly opposes the two-state solution, a position he reaffirmed in the early stages of the first 2019 Knesset campaign. Kachol Lavan supports amending the Nation-State Law, rather than overturning it entirely.\n\nLeader: Benjamin Netanyahu\n\nCurrent Seats: 39 (as Likud and Kulanu)\n\nRecommended candidate for prime minister in the Twenty-First Knesset: Benjamin Netanyahu (as Likud and Kulanu)\n\nSupports/Opposes Two-State Solution: Opposes\n\nLikud, the party of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is Israel’s largest right-wing party. In 1977, under Menachem Begin’s leadership, the party broke the three-decade electoral monopoly of the Labor Party and its antecedents. Since then, it has been a dominant force in Israeli politics, returning to lead the government under prime ministers Yitzhak Shamir, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Ariel Sharon.\n\nThe party’s primary philosophy includes a more hardline approach toward territorial concessions for the Palestinians and a commitment to economic liberalism (the latter tenet has mattered less as an ideological determinant since the privatization of Israel’s economy). While Benjamin Netanyahu has offered tepid endorsement of a two-state solution (which he has since walked back), the party officially opposes the creation of a Palestinian state. Last year, the Likud Central Committee overwhelmingly voted to endorse de facto annexation of West Bank Area C. On the eve of the April elections, Prime Minister Netanyahu promised to annex West Bank settlements, without regard for their size or location.\n\nThe party remains broadly committed to keeping Prime Minister Netanyahu in office, despite pending indictments against him in three corruption cases. In the last election cycle, Likud won 35 seats, but failed to form a government that would vote to grant Netanyahu immunity when Avigdor Liberman refused to have his Yisrael Beiteinu sit alongside the ultra-Orthodox parties. Theoretically, Likud sans-Netanyahu could have joined a unity government with Kachol Lavan. However, the party supported the prime minister’s push for new elections instead. Likud MKs like Gideon Saar and Michal Shir, perceived as critical of Netanyahu, ultimately voted in favor of dissolving the Knesset and moving to new elections.\n\nIn the last election campaign, Naftali Bennett and Ayelet Shaked split from Habayit Hayehudi to form Hayamin Hehadash, in order to separate their brand of right-wing politics from the perceived narrow religious interests of factions like Tkuma. However, their new list failed to pass the electoral threshold. Meanwhile, at the urging of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the rump Bayit Yehudi (including Tkuma) merged with the Kahanist faction Otzma Yehudit, yielding five seats as the Union of Right-Wing Parties. With the advent of a new election, Shaked and Bennett decided to return to politics, this time with Shaked in the number one spot in Hayamin Hehadash. Despite initial resistance from Peretz, Shaked, who is widely popular on the right in Israel, was granted the leadership of the united list.\n\nLiberman’s stand on secularism is in line with his previous positions, although he has sat in government with the ultra-Orthodox parties before. His refusal to bow to ultra-Orthodox demands appeals to a largely secular Russian-speaking base (immigrants from the former Soviet Union have often been mistreated by Israel’s religious authorities), as well as to the broader Israeli public. Current polling indicates that this could benefit Yisrael Beiteinu come election day. However, there is also an element of personal rivalry between Netanyahu and Liberman, who was once the prime minister’s subordinate within Likud. Because of this, Netanyahu has taken a particularly vindictive tack against his erstwhile colleague. Liberman, for his part, is calling for a national unity government including his party, Kachol Lavan, and Likud, and excluding leftist factions and the predominantly Arab Joint List. Such an eventuality would presumably exclude Netanyahu too, as Kachol Lavan has committed to not join a government in which the prime minister faces indictment. Liberman seeks the defense, immigration absorption, interior, and health ministries for his party.\n\nAvigdor Liberman lives in the West Bank settlement of Nokdim. However, Yisrael Beiteinu officially supports a version of the two-state solution colloquially known as the Liberman Plan. Under the Liberman Plan, large settlements would be annexed to Israel, but predominantly Arab parts of Israel, such as the Triangle in northern Israel, would be ceded a future Palestinian state. This program is strongly opposed by Palestinian citizens of Israel, who do not want to surrender their citizenship. Liberman is hawkish on military affairs, often seeking to position himself as more militant than Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Indeed, it was Liberman who brought the coalition to a single-seat majority when he resigned in protest over a ceasefire with Hamas in Gaza, criticizing Netanyahu’s government as soft on terror.\n\nParty List:\n\n1. Avigdor Lieberman\n\n2. Oded Forer\n\n3. Evgeny Sova\n\n4. Eli Avidar\n\n5. Yulia Malinovsky\n\n6. Hamad Amar\n\n7. Alex Kushnir\n\n8. Mark Ifraimov\n\n9. Limor Magen-Telem\n\n10. Elina Bardach-Yalov\n\n11. Shadi Halul\n\n12. Alex Fridman\n\n13. David Davidyan\n\n14. Shahar Alon\n\n15. Ilana Kartysh\n\nShas decried Avigdor Liberman’s confrontation with the ultra-Orthodox parties during coalition negotiations following the April elections. However, Shas maintains that its primary enemy remains Yair Lapid of Kachol Lavan, owing to Lapid’s past campaigning against ultra-Orthodox hegemony, and that Liberman’s efforts should be ignored.\n\nIn recent years, Shas has lately been plagued by internal fractures and legal troubles. Former Shas head Eli Yishai launched a new far-right party, Yachad, in 2015. Meanwhile, the Israel Police have recommended indictments against party leader Aryeh Deri on corruption charges (Deri was previously jailed for corruption). While Deri was previously restored to the Shas leadership by the party’s rabbinical overseers, the Council of Torah Sages have been more tepid in their support for the embattled chairman this time around. Investigations into Deri over graft allegations remain open, with police questioning the Shas leader as recently as June 2019.\n\nParty List:\n\n1. Arye Dery\n\n2. Yitzhak Cohen\n\n3. Meshulam Nahari\n\n4. Yaakov Margi\n\n5. Yoav Ben Tzur\n\n6. Michael Malkieli\n\n7. Moshe Arbel\n\n8. Yinon Azoulay\n\n9. Moshe Abutbul\n\n10. Uriel Busso\n\nThe Joint List\n\nLeader: Ayman Odeh\n\nCurrent Seats: 10 (6 as Hadash-Ta’al, 4 as United Arab List-Balad)\n\nRecommended candidate for prime minister in the Twenty-First Knesset: No candidate (as Hadash-Ta’al and United Arab List-Balad)\n\nSupports/Opposes Two-State Solution: Supports\n\nThe Joint List is a unified ticket of four major Israeli Arab parties: communist Hadash, secular Arab interest Ta’al, conservative Islamist United Arab List, and nationalist Balad. In previous elections, the different parties have run together in various configurations, often too small to cross the electoral threshold on their own. After Avigdor Liberman advocated raising the threshold in lead up to the 2015 elections, the four parties banded together to become the third largest faction in the Knesset. In 2015, the Joint List released a set of principles, including support for a two-state solution. However, different factions within the list maintain their own positions. Balad, in particular, is not opposed to a two-state solution, but views it as only an interim step toward a single democratic state.\n\nAfter the 2015 election, rotation agreements intended to balance representation among the Joint List’s constituent factions became perennial sources of disagreement, and the parties ceased to function as a unified bloc. In the April election, the Arab parties ran two separate lists Hadash-Ta’al, and United Arab List-Balad.\n\nApril’s elections saw the Arab parties collectively lose three seats, as compared with the Joint List’s performance in 2015. Voter turnout dropped from 63.5 percent to 49 percent in Arab communities. Several outside factors contributed to this, including the main opposition party, Kachol Lavan, campaigning on a commitment to not work with Arab parties, and voter intimidation/suppression efforts by Likud contractors, who illegally placed hidden cameras at polling stations in Arab municipalities. However, there was also a sense of disappointment in Israeli Arab politicians for the united ticket’s breakup. Accordingly, the four Arab parties supported Prime Minister Netanyahu’s initiative to dissolve the Knesset and move to new elections, seeing this as an opportunity for a do-over. Shortly after new elections were called in May, the Arab factions declared that they would restart the Joint List.\n\nDespite the announcement, mediation between the parties, overseen by a reconciliation committee consisting of prominent Israeli Arab scholars and activists, stalled. Negotiations broke down over a dispute between Hadash, Ta’al, and Balad over the twelfth and fourteenth spots on the Joint List. The reconciliation committee began preparing for an eventuality in which the merger failed to materialize, but Hadash, Ta’al, and the United Arab List ultimately decided to unite on July 28, just days before the deadline for final party registration. Balad confirmed it would join the next day. Both Balad and Ta’al stated they were joining with reservations about the assignment of seats at the bottom of the list.\n\nHadash chair Ayman Odeh, who leads the Joint List, has vowed not to sit in any coalition that includes Ehud Barak, presumably because of the former prime minister’s poor reputation among Israeli Arabs following the police shooting of 12 Arab citizens and one Gaza Palestinian in a series of October 2000 demonstrations.\n\nParty List:\n\n1.

After April’s election, former Prime Minister Ehud Barak’s reentry into politics at the head of the new Israel Democratic Party raised concerns that voters who traditionally supported Meretz and Labor would be split, to the detriment of all parties on the left. When the merger was announced, Meretz chair Nitzan Horowitz was given the top spot on the joint ticket, with Stav Shaffir second. Horowitz is a journalist and former MK who defeated Tamar Zandberg in the Meretz leadership election in June.\n\nThe merger with the Israel Democratic Party brings in potentially valuable figures like former IDF Deputy Chief of Staff Yair Golan, and the Democratic Union is expected to produce a better finish than Meretz would have received by itself. However, Ehud Barak is a controversial figure in Israeli politics. On the right, he is distrusted for withdrawing Israeli forces from southern Lebanon and attempting to negotiate a two-state solution with Yasser Arafat. On the left, he is often criticized for splitting the Labor Party in 2011 in order to retain his position as defense minister in Netanyahu’s government. Many Israeli Arabs also object to Barak’s behavior as prime minister during a series of demonstrations in October 2000 in which 12 Arab citizens and one Gaza Palestinian were killed by police. Meretz MK Isawwi Frej, himself an Israeli Arab, helped smooth Barak’s transition into the merger. Frej compelled the former prime minister to issue a formal apology to the families of those killed in 2000, and the Meretz MK also plans to hold visits with the families. Barak accepted tenth place on the joint party list.\n\nParty List:\n\n1. Nitzan Horowitz\n\n2. Stav Shaffir\n\n3. Yair Golan\n\n4. Tamar Zandberg\n\n5. Ilan Gilon\n\n6. Esawi Freige\n\n7.

Ali Salalha\n\nIn July, Peretz united Labor with Gesher, the socio-economic issues-focused party of ex-Yisrael Beiteinu MK Orly Levy-Abekasis. Peretz and Levy-Abekasis are both of Moroccan descent, and the aim of the union is to siphon off votes from the right-wing in the poorer, more Mizrahi regions known as the “periphery,” something Peretz successfully accomplished in 2006. However, the perception of Gesher as being a center-right party as well as Levy-Abekasis’s prior association with Avigdor Liberman’s hard-right Yisrael Beiteinu have proven controversial among Labor’s left-wing base. In the wake of the Gesher merger, Stav Shaffir left the party to join Meretz and the Israel Democratic Party, while Itzik Shmuli mulled leaving too before ultimately opting to stay in. Notably, a previous iteration of Gesher led by Levy-Abekasis’s father ran on a joint ticket with Ehud Barak’s Labor in 1999.\n\nThe Labor Party emerged from a series of socialist and social-democratic parties, although its leftist economic bent has been subdued in recent decades. Under Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, the party launched the Oslo peace process with the Palestinians, and Ehud Barak became the first Israeli prime minister to formally support a two-state solution. As Israeli public confidence in a final status agreement wanes, the party has downplayed the issue of two states, with some Labor members expressing doubts about the timeline for the creation of an independent Palestine in the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nParty List:\n\n1.
