        "text": "Yesterday, I launched the foodtech and agritech lobby in the Israeli parliament - the Knesset. I held a special discussion, together with Health Minister - MK Moshe Arbel and former Finance Minister - MK Avigdor Lieberman, managers of foodtech and agritech companies and representatives of government ministries. The global food crisis, in light of climate change, requires adjustment to the way food is grown and produced. Technology is the key to the solution and in recent years the State of Israel has become a trailblazer in this field, second to the US in investments, with over 70 start-ups of alternative protein. The attempt to turn Israel into an undemocratic state, is harming the foodtech industry, as well as the entire high-tech industry. A drop in investments due to government policy has made setting up ventures more difficult, and created a major challenge for existing companies. This is in addition to the heavy regulatory challenges facing the industry, mainly in the Ministry of Health. Despite the deep disagreement I have with the government, we are still committed to working with the ministries in order to reduce regulation and try to create a business environment that can, at the very least, preserve the foodtech and agritech industry. Health Minister, Mk Moshe Arbel, expressed willingness to reduce regulation, and I intend to open, through the lobby, a direct route with the minister's office in order to raise the challenges and find solutions. #technology #climatechange #foodtech #agritech #environment"
