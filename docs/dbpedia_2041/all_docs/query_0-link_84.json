        "text": "The brutal murder of a woman in South Africa has sparked a national outcry over violence against women. Tshegofatso Pule was missing for four days before her body was found hanging from a tree. According to government data, a woman is killed every three hours in South Africa, prompting president Ramaphosa to declare the country as “one of the most unsafe places in the world to be a woman.”\n\nA male lawmaker was appointed to Israel’s national Committee for the Advancement of Women & Gender Equality. Oded Forer took over as head of the committee despite a lack of experience. The Israeli feminist group Kulan condemned the decision in a response posted to Facebook:\n\n“This comes at a time where Israeli women are facing a crisis, with domestic violence at an all-time high and the coronavirus exacerbating women’s social and economic inequality. More than ever, the Committee for the Advancement of Women needs a qualified and expert leader at the helm. This is not that.”"
