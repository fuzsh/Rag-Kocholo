        "text": "Article\n\nArab Residents of Mixed Cities: A Snapshot\n\nWritten By: Dr. Nasreen Haddad Haj-Yahya, Adv. Oded Ron, Ben Fargeon\n\nThis study aims to provide an up-to-date snapshot of the current situation in mixed cities alongside a description of trends in Israel’s mixed cities over time, in five closely related fields—welfare, education, higher education, employment, and crime—by presenting data collected over a period of time, as a critically important input to sound policymaking.\n\nOp-ed\n\nIsrael's Jerusalem Syndrome\n\nWritten By: Dr. Nasreen Haddad Haj-Yahya\n\nThe recent clashes in a capital where even the smallest spark can set its streets ablaze are a direct result of the city's long-term neglect of its disadvantaged Palestinian residents, among whom poverty rates are double that of Jewish Jerusalemites.\n\nPress Release\n\nSecond Wave is a Matter of Time\n\nMore than half of Israelis think a second wave is a matter of time and 39% think that the return to normalcy is too fast\n\nIsraeli Voice Index\n\nOver Half of Jewish Israelis Support Annexation\n\nWritten By: Prof. Tamar Hermann, Dr. Or Anabi\n\nThe Israeli Voice Index for April 2020, found that 52% of Jewish Israelis support Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's stated policy of extending Israeli sovereignty in the West Bank, however only 32% believes Israel will move forward with this in the coming year.\n\nOp-ed\n\nA New Political Card\n\nWritten By: Dr. Arik Rudnitzky\n\nHas the \"Deal of the Century\" injected energy into Israel's third election and perhaps provided an incentive for Arab Israelis to turn out in higher numbers than September? Arik Rudnitzky uses the village of Bartaa as a possible case study.\n\nPress Release\n\nMK Liberman: \" If third elections are held the outcome will be different\"\n\nMK Avigdor Liberman at IDI Annual Conference on Security and Democracy: \"I fully trust the security forces know how to deal with threats in a professional manner uninfluenced by outside biases\"\n\nOp-ed\n\nSome are Guilty, but All Are Responsible\n\nWritten By: Dr. Nasreen Haddad Haj-Yahya\n\nWhen the PM smeared Arab Knesset members, those 'allies' who urged us to go and vote had a responsibility to protest. They didn't.\n\nOp-ed\n\nA Minority Government in Israel?\n\nWritten By: Dr. Assaf Shapira\n\nThe final results of the third election are in and Israel is in very much the same stalemate position as the previous two rounds - is a minority government the solution?\n\nOp-ed\n\nThe Golem Turns on its Creator\n\nWritten By: Yair Sheleg\n\nAs a rule, it is not just their extremist ideology that has sent them to camp on the hilltops, but also the alternative they have chosen to replace the staid, bourgeois life they left behind.\n\nOp-ed\n\nEvery Cloud has a Silver Lining?\n\nWritten By: Dr. Arik Rudnitzky\n\nArab parties can surge if they shake off the old politics - a significant number of Arabs who stayed home in April will vote if they are persuaded their leaders have integrity\n\nOp-ed\n\nIs Israel like Iran? Hardly\n\nWritten By: Dr. Shuki Friedman\n\nAn unflattering US report on freedom of religion would have us believe that Israel is being run by an ayatollah-like regime. While some limits to freedom of religion exist, Israel is a free country\n\nOp-ed\n\nAnother Chance for the Joint List\n\nWritten By: Dr. Arik Rudnitzky\n\nWill Arab politicians take advantage of the second chance that the new elections have presented? Runing in a Joint List and reaching out to their younger voters - 60% of which didn't vote in the last election, would be the right place to start.\n\nOp-ed\n\nAnd Now, Over to the Public\n\nWritten By: Dr. Arik Rudnitzky\n\nAfter abysmal Arab voter turnout, it’s time for public action. Arabs in Israel are desperate for a new discourse and leaders who connect with them -- what they don't want is more ideology\n\nOp-ed\n\nCounting the Votes\n\nWritten By: Dr. Arik Rudnitzky\n\nWill Arab elected officials adopt a pragmatic and matter-of-fact approach and overcome the obstacles standing in the way of establishing political partnerships among them, in order to encourage Arab voters to go to the polls on Election Day?\n\nOp-ed\n\nThe Five-Year Plan for Arab Israelis: the Acid Test of the Upcoming Elections\n\nWritten By: Dr. Nasreen Haddad Haj-Yahya\n\nThe five-year plan for the development of the Arab community was a giant step forward towards the socioeconomic advancement of Israel’s Arabs, nevertheless the current election campaign is going to be the acid test: Is the Israeli government serious about integrating the country’s Arab citizens into the broader society, or merely in promoting the Arab economy in light of its importance for the country’s overall prosperity?\n\nArticle\n\nHouse Demolition at the Israeli Supreme Court: Recent Developments\n\nWritten By: Prof. Yuval Shany, Prof. Amichai Cohen\n\nIn its fight against terrorism, Israel has often been proud of its ability to effectively fight terrorism, while remaining faithful to democratic principles. House demolitions were always considered a necessary evil, which could be resorted to in very exceptional circumstances - are we now facing populist trends that runs contrary to the traditional ethos of subjecting counterterrorism policies to rule-of-law constraints.\n\nArticle\n\nPresentation of the Israeli Democracy Index to the President of Israel\n\nWritten By: Yohanan Plesner\n\n\"Our central mission—and we see you as a partner in this—is to strengthen Israel’s democratic core in the spirit of the Declaration of Independence\" says Yohanan Plesner in his address to President Reuven Rivlin.\n\nArticle\n\nMeet the Next Generation of IDI Leaders\n\nWritten By: Rachel Cohen, Adv. Alona Vinograd, Dr. Nasreen Haddad Haj-Yahya, Daphna Aviram-Nitzan, Dr. Gilad Malach\n\nGuaranteeing an independent Supreme Court. Integrating the Ultra-Orthodox into the IDF. Boosting participation of Arab women in the workforce. Improving the ease of doing business in Israel. These are some of the challenges facing IDI’s new cadre of program and center directors.\n\nOp-ed\n\nIn Grand Debut, Israel's Nation-state Law Reveals Its Ugly True Colors\n\nWritten By: Prof. Mordechai Kremnitzer\n\nThe deputy president of the Jerusalem District Court inaugurated the Basic Law on Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People, issuing the first verdict based on it - imposing punitive damages on Hamas for the severe post-traumatic stress suffered by a Jewish Israeli wounded in a terror attack in Tel Aviv in 1998.\n\nArticle\n\nJewish, Democratic—and Israeli\n\nWritten By: Yair Sheleg\n\nWe should simultaneously define Israel as the nation state of the Jewish people and at the same time---the state and home of all its citizens.\n\nOp-ed\n\nStrengthening Jewish Peoplehood In The Diaspora — But Not In Israel\n\nWritten By: Yohanan Plesner\n\nIn the bill’s final wording, the state only commits itself to act within the Diaspora to strengthen the ties of Jewish peoplehood – as if actions taken inside the Jewish state, like the reneged-upon Western Wall compromise, have no bearing on the rest of the Jewish world.\n\nPress Release\n\n60% of Israelis Think the New Nation-State Law Should Have Included ‘Equality'\n\nWritten By: Prof. Tamar Hermann, Prof. Ephraim Yaar\n\nThe monthly Peace Index of the Israel Democracy Institute and Tel Aviv University, published today, finds that: only 52% of Jewish Israelis think it was important to pass the Nation-State law at this time.\n\nPress Release\n\nLetter to the Israeli Government on the Nation State Bill\n\nWritten By: Yohanan Plesner , Prof. Yuval Shany, Prof. Yedidia Z.
