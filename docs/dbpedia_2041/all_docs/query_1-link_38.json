        "text": "The Caucus will act to raise and promote awareness in Israel and abroad that the victory of Israel over its enemies means the victory of the Zionist idea and recognition that the State of Israel is the national homeland of the Jewish people. It will also send a clear message about the necessity of a clear military victory over Israel's enemies. This will be achieved to promote a solution to the conflict which will bring real peace, prosperity, progress and a better future to the region as a whole. The Caucus will act in parallel with its sister caucus in the U.S. called the Congressional Israel Victory Caucus\n\nMK Oded Forer\n\nYisrael Beitenu\n\nOded Forer enlisted in the Navy, completed naval officers course, and served in a variety of command positions: Dabur (patrol boat) commander, naval officer course instructor, and commander of a-patrol boat subdivision. He was discharged at the rank of captain and was promoted to major during the course of reserve duty. After his discharge from the IDF, Forer began his academic studies and simultaneously began serving as adviser to then-Minister of Education Limor Livnat and as secretary of the Israeli Council for Culture and Arts.\n\nForer is an attorney, with an LL.B. and a B.A. in Government from the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya, and a M.A. in Political Media from Tel Aviv University.\n\nIn 2005, Forer founded a strategic consulting firm that focused on ventures, particularly BOT (Build-Operate-Transfer) and PFI (Private Finance Initiative), including a national training center for the Israel Police and the IDF training-base complex (Ir HaBahadim).\n\nIn 2011, Forer joined Yisrael Beitenu. He initiated and established the party's youth division –Tzeiri Beitenu – which he headed until 2013. That year, Forer was appointed Director General of the Ministry of Immigration and Absorption, under Minister Sofa Landver.\n\nPrior to the elections for the 20th Knesset, Forer resigned from his position to run for the Knesset. Since September 2015, Forer has been serving as MK.\n\nActivity as Director General of the Ministry of Immigration and Absorption\n\nAs Director General of the Ministry of Immigration and Absorption, Forer made, encouraging immigration to Israel as one of the Ministry's main goals, in addition to improving the absorption processes for immigrants. As a result, the name of the Ministry was changed to Ministry of Immigration and Absorption. The Ministry then began to focus on encouraging potential immigrants to emigrate to Israel.\n\nForer spearheaded a revolution in this area, including the establishment of an inter-ministerial team to encourage immigration from France. He worked to pass Government resolution 1736 to encourage immigration and to promote a national project to encourage immigration. During his term as Director General, the number of immigrants to Israel rose. In 2012, before he joined the Ministry, 1,900 immigrants from France moved to Israel. In 2014, this number rose to over 6,500 immigrants. Furthermore, the number of immigrants who moved to Israel in 2014 broke a ten-year–old record: approximately 27,000 immigrants moved to Israel in 2014, as opposed to the average of 18,000 immigrants in each of the past ten years.\n\nIn light of the 2014crisis in Ukraine, which also affected the Jewish community, MK Forer spearheaded a series of measures to facilitate faster and easier absorption for immigrants from the Ukraine. Furthermore, he led to the approval of two significant Government resolutions on the removal of barriers to employment of immigrants. The inter-ministerial committee that Forer initiated and headed that formulated recommendations that were eventually approved by the Government (Government Resolutions 1737 and 2225). The activity resulted in regulatory changes and relief in employment of immigrants and resolved bureaucratic difficulties in the Ministries of Education, Health, and Economy; the Civil Service Commission, Council for Higher Education, and other institutions.\n\nIn addition, Forer spearheaded a major consulting process to promote the inclusion of Ethiopian immigrants in Israel, a move to which thousands of people and 12 government ministries were party. Spearheading this complex process required special attention; ultimately, immediately after the formation of the current government, the principles that the committee had painstakingly formulated were approved. This program, known as Derech Hadasha (New Path)for the integration of Ethiopian immigrants in Israeli society, was the first time in which representatives of the Ethiopian community were completely involved in all the hearings and decision-making fora to rebuild trust and formulate a plan that would satisfy the community's needs.\n\nDuring Forer's term as Director General, thousands of apartments were built for immigrants eligible for public housing alongside steps taken together with the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Housing to increase assistance to immigrants waiting for public housing. During his term, the Ministry began managing and funding the activity of the Israel Students Authority, which handles thousands of students. Furthermore, the Ministry established the new Youth Department.\n\nActivity as a MK\n\nIn the 20th Knesset, Oded Forer is a member of the Finance Committee; the Education, Culture and Sports Committee; and the Special Committee to Discuss the Motion for the Agenda on Difficulties in Reforming the Civil Service.
