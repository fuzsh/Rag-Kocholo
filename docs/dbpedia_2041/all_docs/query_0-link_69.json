        "text": "Ofer Cassif, a member of the Knesset – Israel’s parliament – is an outlier in Israeli politics.\n\nHis strong anti-war and pro-Palestinian stance flies in the face of accepted norms in Israel, and has landed him in legal trouble, got him suspended and thrown in jail.\n\nThe firebrand politician is a lone voice against the most right-wing government in Israel’s history, having refused to support the Israeli Defence Force’s (IDF) assault in Gaza and joined demonstrations calling for an end to the war.\n\nNow, he faces becoming the first member of the Knesset to be impeached, after dozens of members backed a petition to get the left-wing politician thrown out of parliament.\n\n“This is a clear-cut example of tyranny of the majority and political persecution,” he told i.\n\n“They are silencing any kind of real opposition, especially now after the terrible massacre committed by Hamas, which we totally condemn. This government and unfortunately some of the opposition use it as an excuse to silence voices they don’t like.”\n\nAfter he publicly supported South Africa’s case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) accusing Israel of committing acts of genocide against Palestinians, 85 Knesset members signed a document calling for impeachment proceedings against Mr Cassif, of the Arab-majority Hadash-Ta’al party.\n\nOded Forer, who collected the signatures, said Mr Cassif’s public endorsement of the ICJ case was “treasonous”, saying it constitutes support “for an armed struggle” against the state of Israel, one of three grounds to bring impeachment proceedings against a Knesset member, the others being incitement to violence or racism. Mr Cassif rejects the allegations.\n\nThe much-disputed law that passed the Knesset in 2016 had been criticised for being “anti-democratic”, with critics at the time saying it was aimed mainly at Arab politicians.\n\nMr Cassif, who is Jewish, said some of those Knesset members who opposed the law eight years ago were “now actually using it”.\n\nHe added: “People should be aware that if I am impeached using this lie of supporting an armed struggle against Israel, and if asking for an end to the war is identified as support of the enemy, then tomorrow someone who raises a plaque at a demonstration saying ‘stop the occupation’ will be accused of being identified with the enemy.\n\n“This is a Pandora box that may be opened – a very dangerous one, an undemocratic one.”\n\nAnti-government protests rocked the nation for much of 2023 before the attacks by Hamas in southern Israel on 7 October, which killed about 1,200 people. Political differences were set aside as Israelis came together to support the military and the families of those killed or taken hostage.\n\nBut as the Palestinian death toll continues to climb at an alarming rate and hopes of bringing hostages home alive dwindle, Israeli society has become increasingly divided over the war, with many urging the government to sign a ceasefire deal.\n\nCracks have also emerged in Israel’s war cabinet, with the leadership split on the military strategy in Gaza that has seen more than 200 Israeli soldiers killed.\n\nThe cabinet deem Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s steadfast vow to eradicate Hamas as being incompatible with returning captives held in Gaza.\n\nCabinet member and former military chief Gadi Eisenkot, who lost a son and a nephew in the fighting in Gaza, went public with his criticism of the war’s strategy in a television interview last week, saying a deal was needed to free remaining hostages.\n\nMr Cassif agrees, saying eliminating Hamas was “unrealistic”.\n\n“The war, in my view, was intended for one thing – survival of the government of Israel, nothing about the security of the Israelis, let alone the security and release of the hostages,” he said.\n\n“The blood spilt of thousands and thousands of innocent Palestinians, of Israeli soldiers and of hostages is on the hands of the Israeli government that doesn’t do anything to really save them.\n\n“I believe more and more people in Israel are beginning to understand that, it’s not easy to recognise when you make a mistake.”\n\nMr Cassif has been a member of the Israeli parliament for nearly five years, but his propensity to make waves in the political scene dates back several decades.\n\nIn the 1980s, he was one of the first conscientious objectors and spent time in military prison for refusing to serve as a soldier in the occupied territories. He has been jailed four times in total.\n\nA clash with police in 2021 during a protest in Israeli-occupied east Jerusalem against an illegal Jewish settlement left him in need of medical attention, and he was charged last week with assaulting an officer in a separate incident in the West Bank in 2022, when he demonstrated against the eviction of Palestinian villages. Mr Cassif said the indictment was “political persecution”.\n\nIn the wake of the Hamas attack on southern Israel, which led to the retaliatory military assault in Gaza that has so far killed more than 26,000 Palestinians, Mr Cassif was suspended from the Knesset for 45 days for criticising the war.\n\nMr Cassif is a staunch supporter of the two-state solution to establish an independent Palestine, something Israeli ministers including Mr Netanyahu have firmly rejected in recent weeks.\n\nMr Cassif believes Israeli leaders have never been serious about wanting to honour the two-state solution despite international pressure to do so, and he criticised the West – including the UK – for not doing enough to resume talks with the aim of establishing a Palestinian state.\n\n“The two state solution must be understood as the interest of the international community, that’s the only bulwark against another world war,” he said. “And I hope that it won’t be too late, when different leaders in the world realise that.”"
