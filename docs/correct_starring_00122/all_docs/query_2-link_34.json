        "text": "Bodybuilder turned Hollywood star Arnold Schwarzenegger may have attained the epitome of fame and stardom, but his experiences keep him grounded. With a grand net worth, Schwarzenegger easily tops the list of Hollywood’s greatest stars. However, early in his career, the actor had to tackle awful challenges while shooting. While John McTiernan’s Predator was a commercial success and well-received by the audience, but a nightmare for the actors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe star-studded cast of Predator couldn’t have been tougher with Carl Weathers, Jesse Ventura, Bill Duke, and Sonny Landham. While this film proved to be a shiny button in Schwarzenegger’s career, it also gave him some wild memories for life. The movie was shot in an exotic location, Puerto Vallarta, a resort city in Mexico. Hence, a scarcity of basic necessities turned into an ordeal for the cast.\n\nAlso Read: “That made Jesse Ventura feel pretty good”: Arnold Schwarzenegger Waged Psychological Warfare on Predator Co-star To Get His Ego Down a Notch On Set\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger’s Predator dilemma\n\nAlmost a decade ago, the 76-year-old actor posted an Ask Me Anything for his fans on Reddit. More so, he encouraged them to throw some crazy questions at him rather than being subtle. Hence, a particular question asking Schwarzenegger about his ordeal while shooting Predator got a hilarious yet dumbfounding response.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger revealed that not the movie, but the behind-the-scene antics made him gravely sick. He wrote in the Reddit post,\n\n“Not because of the predator. But during the shooting of the movie, I got really sick in Puerto Vallerta. I will spare you the details, but while I was on a run, the runs hit. I ran to the side of the road and some cars driving by got quite the show.”\n\nIn another interview by FilMagicians, Shane Black disclosed the pathetic living conditions of the hotel they were living at. The contaminated water made everyone sick while Schwarzenegger was most affected. He got dehydrated and nearly got hospitalized with stomach cramps. Black said in the interview,\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We got a notice in our hotel room telling us that the water was not potable. But we got the note seven days after it happened.”\n\nSurprisingly, two members of the cast were not affected by the contaminated water or the harsh weather conditions at all.\n\nAlso Read: After Fighting Arnold Schwarzenegger and Comanches, Next Predator Film Should Take Place in Viking Age – One Actor is Perfect to Replace Arnie\n\nShane Black and Carl Weathers dodged the bug\n\nInitially clueless about the water, all the actors consumed it for a while only to fall sick later. Fortunately, Black and Carl Weathers survived through the ordeal and were not sick at all throughout. On the other hand, Bill Duke fell severely ill after a long shower. Consequently, he was on bed rest for days, shivering even under a pile of blankets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSony Landham dealt with intense diarrhea, running to the loo every now and then. As per the interview, actors would hold back until the director called cut and dashed to the nearest bathroom after scenes. Whereas, Arnold Schwarzenegger simply took to the roadside once in an emergency.\n\nThe McTiernan-led movie was a success if not a blockbuster. As per Forbes, it earned almost $100 million worldwide against a $15 million budget in 1987. Also, Predator steered the spotlight towards the Austrian Oak, giving a kick-start to his now $450 million worth career. Despite the ordeal, the actors recall it as a fond memory worth a thousand laughs.\n\nAlso read: ‘The Revenant Meets Predator’: Prey Initial Reactions Praise Movie’s Atmospheric Thriller, Fans Want an Anthological Series Based in Different Timelines"
