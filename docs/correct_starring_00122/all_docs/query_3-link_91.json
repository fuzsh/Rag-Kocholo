        "text": "By Movieguide® Contributor\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger and Alan Ritchson are slated to star in the upcoming Christmas comedy movie THE MAN WITH THE BAG.\n\n“When Santa’s magic bag is stolen, he turns to his naughty list to find Vance, a former thief, to help him get it back. Along with his daughter, Santa, and a group of misfit elves, Vance will have to pull off the greatest heist of his life to save Christmas,” a summary from Deadline reads.\n\nRitchson, best known for his role in REACHER, announced the movie on his Instagram.\n\n“This one’s gonna sleigh…” he wrote.\n\n“That’s awesome brother. Congrats and God bless! Love seeing all the blessings coming your way,” one user commented.\n\nAnother person said, “Fantastic script…. and just wow on Arnie! You’re gonna smash this. Congratulations.”\n\nThis will be Schwarzenegger’s first film since 2019. He last starred in TERMINATOR: DARK FATE, and his last holiday movie was JINGLE ALL THE WAY in 1996.\n\nThe movie will be directed by Adam Shankman and produced by “Lawrence Grey, Ben Everard, Reg Tigerman, Dan Spilo, and Alan Ritchson,” according to Deadline.\n\nA release date for THE MAN WITH THE BAG has yet to be announced.\n\nMovieguide® previously reported on Ritchson’s desire to spread the gospel through secular roles:\n\n“I think we can start conversations, and we can reach people through these mediums in a way that I think God enjoys,” he said. “So here we are now where we can get to the heart of the matter where God has built a platform because of this show for me where I can reach people who maybe don’t think about these things all the time. And maybe for those who are struggling or feel lost or want to try something now, they can find something that brings them hope like my faith has [for me].”\n\nThe actor also believes that playing an imperfect, morally ambiguous character who is fighting to do good provides a more realistic look into the people God chooses to do His work.\n\n“God continually shows up in our world in a way that kind of boggles our mind,” Ritchson told Christian Headlines last April. “For whatever reason, I think we continue to buy into that idea that…God chooses heroes to do His work. And it’s just never been the case.”"
