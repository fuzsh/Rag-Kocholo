        "text": "The 1987 film Predator is no doubt one of the movies to help cement actor Arnold Schwarzenegger as a massive 1980’s action star. Unlike the Terminator franchise, however, which saw Arnold Schwarzenegger return multiple times – he’s never returned to the Predator franchise. At least for the film series, that is. But after lending his voice talents to the recently released video game Predator: Hunting Grounds, it seems he’s eager for a cinematic comeback as well. It’s been announced that filmmaker Dan Trachtenberg is attached to a new Predator film, and according to a new rumor, Arnold Schwarzenegger wants to be part of the project.\n\nThe rumor was revealed via Patreon, where insider Daniel Richtman revealed the exciting possibility. According to Richtman, Disney is interested in getting Arnold Schwarzenegger for their new Predator film that’s currently in development. Of course, this isn’t the first time a studio was eager to have Arnold Schwarzenegger in a new Predator film – essentially every sequel offered the star a chance to return.\n\nWhat’s different in this scenario, however, is that Arnold Schwarzenegger is likewise interested to return according to the rumor. And if that’s the case, it seems likely that he could easily come to terms with Disney and return to the Predator franchise as so many fans have wanted for decades.\n\nWhile this is only a rumor, and should be interpreted as such, it does make sense that Disney would want Arnold Schwarzenegger to come back. After all, they’re probably hoping to create a sequel more successful with audiences than the last couple of films have been. And bringing Schwarzenegger back into the fold could be the perfect way to do that. And as mentioned above, he did come back to voice Dutch for the video game Predator: Hunting Grounds, so I’d say it’s likely he really does want to come back.\n\nUnfortunately there’s not really anything concrete about the newly announced Predator film to go off of. The information we do have is that Dan Trachtenberg will be directing a script written by Patrick Aison. Beyond that, we’ll have to wait for more info. So as always, stay tuned to ScreenGeek for any future updates on the project."
