        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger has had quite a terrific run at the box office as an action star. In a career spanning over 50 years, Arnold has become synonymous with the action genre. Be it fighting aliens in Predator or machines in the Terminator franchise to his recent spy comedy, Fubar, the former bodybuilder has wowed the audience with his performance. With Fubar garnering rave reviews, here’s looking back at some of the star’s best action movies that you can watch on YouTube, Netflix and more.\n\nBest action movies of Fubar star Arnold Schwarzenegger; to watch on YouTube and more\n\n1. Predator – Apple TV, YouTube\n\nA perfect blend of action and sci-fi, the Predator brought international recognition for Arnold Schwarzenegger as an action hero. The plot follows Major Alan Schaefer, aka Dutch, (Arnold), a Vietnam War veteran, who is tasked with leading a rescue mission to bring home the foreign cabinet minister. During their mission, the group comes across a chopper wreckage and a few bodies. As they go deeper into the forest to rescue the minister, they encounter a mysterious alien, who is a highly-skilled hunter. The Predator uses advanced technology to attack his prey. The plot then focuses on Dutch going all commando to find and kill the Predator and save his teammates.\n\n2. Conan the Barbarian – Disney+Hotstar\n\nThe movie turned Arnold Schwarzenegger into an overnight international sensation – and even managed to grab the attention of ace filmmaker, James Cameron, who then cast him in another critically-acclaimed series, Terminator. In this revenge, action fantasy, the actor stars as a barbarian warrior, Conan. When his clan, including his parents, is brutally massacred, Conan, then a child, is enslaved by the enemy clan. Years later, Canon has grown into a well-built, sword-wielding muscular man. Yearning for vengeance for his parents’ death, he sets out to find the culprit, leaving in its wake, a bloody massacre. The epic drama is an entertaining amalgamation of gritty action, fantasy, and an unforgettable performance from Arnold.\n\n3. Commando (1985) – Apple TV, Google Play Movies, YouTube\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger goes all-gun blazing (no pun intended) as former special forces colonel, John Matrix, in this high-octane action thriller. When John’s daughter, Jenny, is kidnapped by his enemies, he is forced to come out of retirement and pick up his gun again. With time running out to save Jenny, John doesn’t hesitate to go on a bloody rampage. The movie is quite violent with Arnold Schwarzenegger engaging in fistfights, shooting, dismembering and blowing up people. This is Arnold in all his glory as an action star.\n\n4. The 6th Day – Apple TV\n\nThe events of the movie are set in the near future where human cloning, though illegal, is quite rampant. The plot revolves around Adam Gibson, a pilot, whose life is turned upside down when he finds that a clone has taken his place in the human world. With assassins tailing him and his life slipping away from his hand, he sets out to find the person responsible for his plight. And, surprisingly, he gets help from his clone. The duo begins a quest to confront the mastermind and unearth a shocking truth about Adam’s cloning.\n\n5. Last Action Hero – Apple TV\n\nThe movie is a delight to watch as it is a parodic take on some of Arnold Schwarzenegger’s iconic action movies. The plot follows a 10-year-old boy, Danny, who’s obsessed with Hollywood action stars. He is a fan of the movie series Jack Slater which is based on a powerful cop. He watches the movie at a theatre owned by his friend, Nick. One day, Nick gives an advance ticket to Danny to watch the latest part of Jack Slater. The ticket happens to be owned by the renowned magician Harry Houdini. Danny’s life takes a fantastical turn when he finds himself mysteriously transported to the fictional world, especially that of his idol, Jack Slater. He ends up being his partner and helps him investigate a drug lord. However, chaos ensues when a notorious criminal escapes the fictional world and plans to kill the actor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who plays Jack in the movie. Danny and Jack must leave the fictional world and thwart the plan.\n\n6. The Last Stand – Netflix\n\nArnold stars as Sheriff Ray Owens of a small town near the state border. There aren’t major crimes happening in the town and residents are living a peaceful life. Owen and the townspeople’s lives take a dramatic turn when an escaped drug lord, Gabriel Cortez, enters their village. When the owners of a diner and one of his deputies are murdered by Cortez’s men, Owen assembles a team of people to stop the drug lord from crossing the border. Though the movie starts slow, it picks up pace eventually and keeps you hooked till the last car chase.\n\n7. Eraser – Amazon Prime Video, YouTube\n\nThe highly-engaging actioner follows John Kruger, a marshal working in the witness protection programme. The specialty of the programme is ‘erasing’ witnesses by faking their deaths. Kruger is assigned to protect a senior executive Lee Cullen. Tension escalates when Cullen’s boss sends assassins to kill her. From the first scene, the movie gets you hooked on its intriguing narrative."
