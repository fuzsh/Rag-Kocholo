        "text": "Graham Sinden\n\nPhenomenal Film Handler\n\nPosts: 1131\n\nFrom: Kent, UK\n\nRegistered: Aug 2005\n\nposted April 15, 2007 06:03 PM\n\nI thought its about time that somebody did a review on the Arnold Schwarzenegger classic Predator. This is available from Derann and comes supplied on 4x600 ft reels. The print is flat (non scope) and with a stereo soundtrack.\n\nThis film is basically another shoot em up staged in the jungle. I first saw this many years ago when it was projected at a nearby film club from a ST1200 with an F1 lens. I was gob smacked at the picture quality as it was better than some 16mm films I had seen. I knew then that I had to buy a copy. It was certainly the best super 8 i've ever seen.\n\nArnie plays a character called Dutch, The leader of an elite Special Forces team heading into the jungle of Mexico to get rid of guerrillas there and rescue any remaining hostages. However Dutch and his team soon change their plan when they find themselves hunted by a highly intelligent alien killer who has chameleon like properties who can blend in with the background and become invisible to the team. Slowly, each member is killed off one by one as the predator has an armoury of sophisticated weapons at his disposal. Thankfully Arnie is one of the last to go but it ends up with him being left the task to destroy the predator. Eventually the killer shows himself for real and we get a chance to see one of the best monsters in movie history when he takes off his helmet. Finally Arnie runs away as the predator tries to blow himself up (not sure if he is dead or still alive)\n\nAt various points throughout the movie you get a chance to see through the predators eyes. This looks like the images you get from heat cameras.\n\nThis film very quickly becomes a grabber. The tension throughout is excellent and you will find it hard to stop the projector once running. It gets very scary towards the end of the film when Arnie scurries under a bush hoping not to be seen and the predator scans the ground with his special vision trying to pick out any living thing that moves. Just like Commando, there are also lots of goofs here. One of the most obvious ones is when Mac (Bill Duke) picks up a scorpion on the end of his knife. He places it down on a piece of wood with its head pointing to the left. He then crushes it with his boot and the scorpions head then clearly points to the right.\n\nA list of mistakes can be found here\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093773/goofs\n\nI also like the ending with a kind of like 'You have been watching' cast list. Reminds me of Jeremy Lloyd and David Croft brit sitcoms like Dads Army, Are you being served.\n\nPicture quality is just superb with pin sharp focus throughout and excellent colours although with a very slight blue tint, but that is to be expected with most Derann features nowadays. Sound quality is top notch with an excellent stereo soundtrack which (with my ears) I cant fault so I wont be re-recording it. I was once told by a certain Mr Keith Wilton that he thought that Predator was the best Flat release he had seen. This was at a time when he was showing Gladiator in scope at the BFCC.\n\nOn the downside there are some negative marks, particularly near the start of the film and a couple of messy negative joins but overall this is an excellent print.\n\nI would rate this film picture 9.9/10 and sound 10/10.\n\nIf you only ever buy one Schwarzenegger feature, make it this one as it will have your audience on the edge of its seats and on the large screen makes you feel you are also in the jungle with them.\n\n| IP: Logged\n\nRob Young.\n\nPhenomenal Film Handler\n\nPosts: 1633\n\nFrom: Cheshire, U.K.\n\nRegistered: Dec 2003\n\nposted April 16, 2007 09:36 AM Great review, Graham.\n\nI owned a print a few years back and agree it was one of the sharpest prints ever produced with an absolutely belting sound track. A real highlight in the history of super 8 releasing!\n\nI saw \"Predator\" when it was first released at my local flea-pit in the '80's. I was 17 and remember having to charm the cashier into letting me in as in the UK it was and \"18\" rated movie and legally, I was too young to see it! As a real \"Alien\" fan, I just loved all the similarities with that movie.\n\nParticularly, I liked Alan Silvestri's musically score which really keeps things moving along and remember being really impressed with the surround sound, with all the jungle noises coming from behind, etc.\n\nI couldn't believe it many years later when I ran my 8mm print through a Dolby Surround processor and found that Derann's fabulous recording actually managed to reproduce some of that amazing surround effect.\n\nOsi, hear what you say in that this super 8 version is basically a full frame print of the original negative, without the appropriate top and bottom masking that would have been present in a theatrical presentation (even if this were introduced by the projector gate) to give 1.85:1 ratio.\n\nI have found that good screen masking overcomes this. I use black velvet tabs and bring them in top and bottom on some prints to give an image closer to 1.85:1. \"Gremlins\" is another super 8 title which springs to mind as being printed \"open mask\", as it were, and benefits from this.\n\nI don't recall anything creeping into the top and bottom of frame on \"Predator\" that you really shouldn't see (like microphones, etc.), although I do remember that on the heat camera effect \"Predator Vision\" shots, you ocasionally see words like so-and-so VIDEO, etc. in the extreme bottom of frame!!!\n\nClearly the audience isn't meant to see this but it does take a sharp eye and, as I say, a bit of good screen masking does away with it...\n\n| IP: Logged"
