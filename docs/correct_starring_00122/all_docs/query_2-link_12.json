        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger is preying on the follow-up films to 1987’s Predator.\n\nIn a Reddit interview, the actor was asked whether he would participate in the franchise reboot that Shane Black is developing. Schwarzenegger replied by saying that the original Predator was one of his “absolute favorite” projects and that he is not yet attached to Black’s film, adding that Black is a “very talented guy.”\n\n“The sad story is that sometimes studios do a great job with creating sequels, and sometimes they really screw it up bad, and it all has to do with greed,” Schwarzenegger said. “They sometimes want to do it really cheap and make as much money as possible, so they don’t hire the right cast or the right director. … It’s stupid moves to make.”\n\n“So far, no Predator, no matter which one they did after the first one has come out, has been satisfactory to the audience,” the star continued.\n\nAfter Predator came 1990’s Predator 2, which starred Danny Glover and in which Schwarzenegger did not appear. More recently, Alien vs. Predator (2004), Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (2007) and Predators (2010) have hit theaters.\n\nSchwarzenegger’s comments can be seen in the video below, beginning at the 12:32 mark."
