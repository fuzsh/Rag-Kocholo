Iâ€™m probably alone in that opinion, but I just donâ€™t like him. I wish him Godspeed in recovering, and the best of health, but I wouldnâ€™t be upset not seeing him in another film.\n\nBut he is the reason why so many people love Predator, if it wasnâ€™t for his dlc the tapes and teases in Keyes audio logs, Predator Hunting Ground wouldnâ€™t be alive till this day especially since it went back to the original theme of the first movie, guys with guns in a jungle with a monster hunting them\n\nI know Iâ€™m a minority. Maybe even the only one.\n\nNah thereâ€™s probably a lot but letâ€™s just agree to disagree and pray good health to Arnold\n\nHe has been eating a lot healthier these days. I saw a YouTube video where his fridge was almost all fruits and vegetables. I wonder if heavy bodybuilder and his past steroid use cause his heart trouble. A celebrity should be forth coming about such issues as they have the opportunity to benefit the multitude with their advice.\n\nGuys. Itâ€™s ok. He was actually just in Cyberdyne getting routine maintenance. He is fine and will probably be killing some of you soon.\n\nHeâ€™s certainly not a great actor, but for the role he played the part well, itâ€™s hard to imagine anybody else as Dutch now\n\nThis is true\n\nFor sure\n\nArnolds Fridge @ 2:57. Arnolds probably the coolest guy ever but he is an adulterer . I probably would be too if I was a movie star, honestly.\n\nNot me, I love predator for the creature concept - also this is the same reason why I love Predator 2 more than Predator\n\n\" IL BE BACK!\" Theres plenty of stunt men so Iâ€™m sure hel do one more predator\n\nNo\n\nBody building always comes with additional stress on the heart.\n\nAs do steroids lol"
