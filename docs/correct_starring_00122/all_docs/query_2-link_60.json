        "text": "7. “Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem” (2007)\n\nDirected by Greg and Colin Strause (aka The Brothers Strause), “Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem” introduced the Predalien: a hybrid creature resulting from a chestburster incubating inside an adult Predator.\n\nPicking up immediately after the events of “Alien vs. Predator,” the second clash of Xenomorphs and Predators arrived in 2007 and brought unprecedented gore to the Predator franchise. Screenwriter Shane Salerno takes the baby theme to some decidedly weird places (including an ill-fated Colorado maternity ward that gives the grossness of “Prometheus” a run for its money).\n\nIn addition to going a tad goopier than the rest of the “Predator” movies, “Requiem” is also thematically darker than the first three films, with an ending way more cynical (and decidedly stupider) than its promising starting point.\n\nSure, it’s a staggering waste of a solid set-up. On the plus side, “Requiem” provides some last-act lore that doubles as vaguely interesting groundwork for the eventual Weyland Yutani Corporation of the “Alien” series.\n\n6. “The Predator” (2018)\n\nNot since “The Final Destination” has a sequel title been so unearned.\n\nShane Black’s “The Predator” hit the box office as a supposedly fresh take on old IP in the summer of 2018. But following a series of last-minute reshoots and an entirely avoidable casting scandal thanks to Black, the overworked slog of a project did little more than cram Jacob Tremblay and a misguided subplot about neurodivergence into an otherwise unremarkable mess.\n\nBoyd Holbrook appears alongside Trevante Rhodes, Sterling K. Brown, Olivia Munn, Keegan-Michael Key, Thomas Jane, Alfie Allen, Yvonne Strahovski, and more. Alas, none of those big names can save Black and co-writer Fred Dekker’s abysmal suburban-set story about stolen alien tech.\n\nThe fourth “Predator” sequel plays with a few novel concepts — namely, a Predator held in human captivity — but blows past its best ideas with erratic pacing and a bizarre tone that’s more awkward than entertaining.\n\n5. “Predator 2” (1990)\n\nDirected by Stephen Hopkins, “Predator 2” sounds like a decent enough idea: Take the jungle-set, human-hunting action of the original “Predator” and reposition it against the tumultuous concrete jungle of gangland Los Angeles. Then swap star Arnold Schwarzenegger for newcomer Danny Glover, fresh off “Lethal Weapon 2,” and you’re good to go, right? Wrong.\n\nAlthough the original screenwriters returned for “Predator 2,” the terminally hokey sequel from 1990 is screamingly disappointing, with a contrived plot that somehow still manages to bore for huge stretches of screentime. That said, the critical flop does include some cool shots of the predator scaling city buildings; Bill Paxton giving the hardest sell as an over-the-top detective looking into a voodoo conspiracy (don’t ask); and hilarious repeated use of the very ‘90s platitude: “Shit happens!”\n\n4. “Alien vs. Predator” (2004)\n\nThe final scene in “Predator 2” set up a collision between Xenomorphs and Predators all the way back in 1990. But it would take a whopping 14 more years for the crossover event to reach theaters in writer-director Paul W. S. Anderson’s “Alien vs. Predator.”\n\nDespite an underwhelming plot, this 2004 sci-fi flick delivers plenty of what you’d hope for from two major alien franchises working together. When human explorers in Antarctica accidentally awaken an ancient Xenomorph queen, the simultaneous arrival of a trio of Predators ignites an explosive three-sided war.\n\n“Alien vs. Predator” has a worthy hero in the Predator films’ first female lead, Sanaa Lathan; scads of creepy-crawly facehuggers running alongside surprisingly complex Predators; and a genuinely fun finale stinger setting up the significantly less enjoyable “Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem.”\n\n3. “Predators” (2010)\n\nWith the original, a bad sequel, and two “Alien” crossovers under its belt, the “Predator” franchise upped its game with “Predators”: a back-to-basics standalone sequel that smartly expanded upon the combat-heavy classic with heightened stakes and improved visual effects.\n\nDirector Nimród Antal’s 2010 fright fest follows a group of nine people who wake up mid-free fall before parachuting into an unfamiliar jungle. Adrien Brody, Alice Braga, Mahershala Ali, and Oleg Taktarov play international military intelligence officials from across the globe. Walton Goggins portrays an American death row inmate; Danny Trejo plays a member of a Mexican drug cartel; Louis Ozawa Changchien appears as a Yakuza enforcer; and Topher Grace plays a medical doctor. Laurence Fishburne also stars in a role better left unspoiled.\n\nAlthough it’s weighed down by some seriously stupid plot twists (and as much offensively dumb dialogue), “Predators” not only looks beautiful, but screenwriters Alex Litvak and Michael Finch craft some of the series’ strongest character arcs since the original.\n\n2. “Prey” (2022)\n\nStrictly speaking, “Prey” isn’t the first “Predator” movie to take audiences back in time. (That distinction belongs to “Alien vs. Predator,” which includes otherworldly flashback scenes set in 1904 Antarctica.) Fortunately, a novel setting isn’t the only thing that makes director Dan Trachtenberg’s 18th century-set film a franchise energizing triumph.\n\nStar Amber Midthunder plays Naru, a young Comanche warrior who enters battle with an ancient Predator after he begins hunting members of her tribe on the Great Plains. Much like the original “Predator,” “Prey” manipulates audience assumptions to tremendous (and terrifying) effect, delivering unpredictable wilderness scares alongside cutting sci-fi action.\n\nAs overtly fun as it is satisfyingly coded (with stunning cinematography to boot), Patrick Aison’s brilliant script subverts franchise expectations with a pared-down conflict that lets the most interesting aspects of the Predator shine, while still winking at the greatness of the original.\n\n1. “Predator” (1987)\n\nYour basic ’80s guerilla warfare flick gives way to a sci-fi grudge match for the ages in director John McTiernan’s “Predator.” Written by brothers Jim and John Thomas, the 1987 Best Visual Effects nominee sees Arnold Schwarzenegger go toe-to-claw with an intergalactic invader (Kevin Peter Hall) hunting humans for sport against the backdrop of war-torn Central America.\n\n“Predator” not only features Schwarzenegger swinging from trees, dead-lifting a truck, and otherwise flexing his ultra-toned action movie muscles; but it also boasts some of the Austrian-American actor’s most iconic line deliveries to date, including: “You are one ugly motherfucker,“ “Get to da choppa!” and “What the hell are you?“"
