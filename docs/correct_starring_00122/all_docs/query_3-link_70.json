Have an account? .\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger started lifting weights when he was 15 years old. Since then, he won 12 renowned bodybuilding titles.\n\nHe later starred in some of the biggest films of the 1980s, including \"Terminator\" and \"Conan the Barbarian.\"\n\nIn 2003, he went into politics and became California's governor following a campaign plagued by sexual misconduct allegations.\n\nSign up to get the inside scoop on today’s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business — delivered daily.

In 1967, he won Mr. Universe when he was 20 years old. He ended up winning it another four times, along with winning Mr. Olympia seven times.\n\nFor about a decade, Schwarzenegger was a Hollywood star. He was in a number of big films in the '80s, including \"Terminator,\" \"Terminator II,\" and \"Total Recall,\" making about $35 million per film.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nLater, he transitioned to politics. During his run for governor in 2003, 16 women accused him of sexual assault over the previous 30 years. He still won the gubernatorial election and served for two terms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger was born in Austria on July 30, 1947.\n\nHe grew up on a farm where his family didn't have a fridge, telephone, or modern toilet until he was about 14.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was a skinny child, and his father Gustav, who was a policeman and a one-time Nazi Party member, reportedly beat him.\n\nGustav used to have his two sons race each other or box, and Schwarzenegger was often the loser.\n\nA later investigation found though Gustav chose to join the Nazis there was no evidence he committed any war crimes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe began bodybuilding when he was 15 years old. He didn't see success in the sport as the end goal but as a way to get where he wanted to go.\n\nHis mother later told reporters he used to sneak out at night to a local stadium and train while his father was asleep.\n\nIn 1990, he told a reporter he \"was always interested in proportion and perfection.\"\n\n\"When I was 15, I took off my clothes and looked in the mirror,\" he said. \"When I stared at myself naked, I realized that to be perfectly proportioned I would need 20-inch arms to match the … rest of me.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBodybuilding was \"a means to an end\" for him, Schwarzenegger said.\n\nHe viewed the activity as his ticket to success in America, a life he envied after seeing it in television shows and magazines.\n\n\"I just felt I could succeed there,\" he told the Tampa Bay Times. \"There was no reason for me to hang out in Austria being a farmer when I could do that.\"\n\n\"It was like my passport to all the great things that can happen in life; the things that I admired so much: getting wealthy, becoming an actor, getting an education,\" he continued. \"I felt that bodybuilding could be the vehicle to get there.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1967, he won Mr. Universe when he was 20 years old. He ended up winning the title another four times, along with winning Mr. Olympia seven times.\n\nDuring this period he spent about four hours a day working out.\n\nIt wasn't just his physique that led to his victories, but also how well he posed.\n\nHe studied ballet to work on moving smoothly from one pose to the next.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1968, he came to America. He entered a bodybuilding competition in Miami and lost.\n\nBut a well-known bodybuilder named Joe Weider saw something in him and took him under his wing.\n\n\"I knew, and he knew, that he could be great,\" Weider told The New York Times. \"We created Arnold. He was special because he was tall, he had willpower, charm, and above all he wanted to win.''\n\nWeider also told The Times during this period they began watching politics and Schwarzenegger decided Republicans made better TV than Democrats.\n\nSchwarzenegger watched Richard Nixon and Hubert Humphrey debating, and after a friend translated Nixon's policies — free trade, less government, more military —he declared he was a Republican, too.\n\nSchwarzenegger decided he would never go back to Europe and moved to Los Angeles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlong with politics and weightlifting, money was another focus for him.\n\nHe studied business administration, graduating from the University of Wisconsin-Superior in 1979. His business acumen has been well documented.\n\nAfter one bodybuilding victory, he told the media eating bull testicles had helped him win, and later made sure Austria's bull-rearing industry paid him for his promotion.\n\nHe also bought real estate, wrote popular fitness books, and started a mail-order business. Later, he diversified into bonds, stocks, and other investments.\n\nBy 2017, he was estimated to be worth $300 million, according to CNBC.\n\nIn 1970, his debut movie, \"Hercules in New York,\" was released. He used the name Arnold Strong rather than his real name, but would never use it again after.\n\nUnfortunately, the movie wasn't a hit, The New York Times reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt wasn't until 1976 when a documentary about the strange world of bodybuilding called \"Pumping Iron\" was released that things started to pick for him.\n\nThe documentary followed Schwarzenegger as he trained for a Mr. Olympia competition and attempted to defend his title. It became a cult hit. The documentary was where he first started to get noticed on-screen.\n\nIn one scene, he lied about refusing to go home for his father's funeral, because he was training for an event. The story was stolen from an Olympic boxer, and Schwarzenegger liked it so much he decided to use it himself.\n\nAfter the success of \"Pumping Iron,\" Schwarzenegger asked Bobby Zarem, the documentary's publicity agent to get him into a room with Jackie Kennedy, whom he wanted to meet more than anyone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe following year, in 1977, he met Maria Shriver, the daughter of Eunice Kennedy Shriver and niece of President John F. Kennedy, at a celebrity tennis match.\n\nHe said to her mother Eunice, \"Your daughter has a great ass,\" The Washington Post reported. He was 30 years old at the time. Shriver was 21.\n\nThey dated each other for the next few years. He asked her to marry him several times, but she refused because she wanted to focus on herself and her career before settling down.\n\nShe eventually agreed to marry him.\n\nHe later said he didn't marry her to marry a Kennedy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey married in Hyannis, Massachusetts, in 1986.\n\nThey had about 500 guests at the wedding.\n\nThey went on to have four children together: Christopher, Patrick, Christina, and Katherine.\n\nIn 1983, Schwarzenegger became a US citizen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThroughout this period, he continued to act and solidify his place in Hollywood.\n\nSince the release of \"Pumping Iron,\" he had become one of the go-to choices for brutal film leads, alongside Sylvester Stallone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Schwarzenegger was yet to have a real hit. He wasn't an obvious choice for Hollywood — he had a thick accent, an unpronounceable name, and wasn't conventionally trained.\n\nBut that all changed when \"Conan the Barbarian\" came out.\n\nThe movie grossed more than $100 million, Vanity Fair reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom 1982 to 1991, Schwarzenegger was a Hollywood heavyweight. He starred in a number of big films including \"Terminator,\" \"Terminator II,\" and \"Total Recall.\"\n\nFor a while, he made about $35 million per film, the Atlantic reported.\n\nBut his time at the top was relatively brief. After the release of \"Last Action Hero\" in 1993, his film career hit a slump and never really picked back up.\n\nHe continued to appear in films throughout the 1990s. Some were successful like \"Twins,\" but many others were not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the 1980s and early 1990s, Schwarzenegger embraced the Republican Party, speaking on behalf of Republican politicians including Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush.\n\nIn return, Bush appointed Schwarzenegger chairman of the President's Council on Physical and Fitness and Sports, a government organization dedicated to promoting programs encouraging a healthy lifestyle.\n\nBut Schwarzenegger wasn't a diehard Republican.\n\nIn 1997, after he had heart surgery, he said, \"We made, actually, history, because it was the first time ever that doctors could prove that a lifelong Republican has a heart.\"\n\nTwo years later, he told a reporter, \"No one knows what our party really stands for rather than going from one convention to the next talking about what we're against.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2003, Schwarzenegger announced on \"The Tonight Show\" that he was running to be the Republican governor of California.\n\nOn the show, he said his decision to run had been a hard one.\n\n\"It was the most difficult decision that I've made in my entire life — except the one in 1978 when I decided to get a bikini wax,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring his run, the Los Angeles Times published a report detailing six women accusing him of sexual assault.\n\nThree women said he grabbed their breasts and one said he'd reached under her skirt over the previous 30 years, the Los Angeles Times reported. Eventually, 16 women accused him of sexual misconduct.\n\nHe responded to the story during a rally.\n\n\"A lot of the stuff in the story is not true,\" he said. \"But I have to say that where there's smoke, there's fire.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn old interview published in 1977 in a magazine called \"Oui\" also resurfaced during his campaign and was met with controversy.\n\nIn the interview, he described joining in group sex acts, taking drugs like cannabis, his thoughts on homosexuality, and the objectification of women.\n\nIn the original interview, he said, \"Girls became sex objects. I saw the other bodybuilders using them in this way and I thought it was all right.\"\n\n\"My attitude about all that has changed radically. I used to feel that women were here for one reason,\" he later said in the interview. \"Sex was simply another kind of exercise, another body function ... In fact, it wasn't until four years after I started training that I had any meaningful communication with a girl.\"\n\nAfter initially denying the interview during his campaign, he later said he remembered it and said, \"I never lived my life to be a politician. I never lived my life to be the governor of California.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShriver, who gave up her TV news job so he could run for governor, came out in his defense.\n\n\"I wouldn't be standing here if this man weren't an A-plus human being,\" she said. \"I wouldn't be taking my time, I wouldn't have left my job that I love, I wouldn't be doing any of this if I didn't believe in this man.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite the accusations and controversy, Schwarzenegger won the election.\n\nIn his first speech, he made some promises he would struggle to keep.\n\n\"I have never been afraid of the fight, and I have never been afraid of the hard work,\" he said. \"I will not rest until our fiscal house is in order. I will not rest until California is a competitive job-creating machine. I will not rest until the people of California come to see their government as a partner in their lives, and not a roadblock to their dreams.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe following year, his political acumen was so strong that people discussed the possibility of amending the Constitution so he could run for president.\n\nBut it never went anywhere.\n\nSchwarzenegger was re-elected in 2006, but his two terms were a struggle.\n\nOne of the problems was that he wasn't a typical Republican — he supported gun control and gay rights — but he also angered Democrats two years into his term when he tried to pass a number of initiatives relating to unions, reform, and teachers.\n\nWhen he left office in January 2011, his approval rating had fallen to 22%, though critics admitted he had done some good, including his work on climate change.\n\nIt was the lowest-ever rating for a California governor, tied with Gray Davis, the governor before him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Schwarzenegger didn't disappear. In May, he was back in the news after publicly admitting to having had a child named Joseph with Mildred Baena, the family's housekeeper, in the 1990s.\n\nIt turned out Baena was pregnant at the same time as Shriver had been. Shriver and Schwarzenegger separated, and after a failed attempt at marriage counseling, Shriver later filed for divorce.\n\nIn 2012, during a tour for his memoir, \"Total Recall,\" he said it was \"the stupidest thing I've done in the whole relationship.\"\n\n\"It was terrible,\" he said. \"I inflicted tremendous pain on Maria and unbelievable pain on the kids.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the pandemic, he became popular on social media. He posted brash, funny clips telling people to wear masks or exercise and not to party.\n\nHis videos later got more serious.\n\nOn TikTok, one of his videos condemning the January 6 riot got 80 million views.\n\nBut since the end of the pandemic, his social media presence has pulled back.\n\nIn March, he told the Atlantic that he was writing a self-help book that had a working title of \"Be Useful,\" and was figuring out his next step.\n\nIn an interview with the Atlantic, he said he's not done yet.\n\n\"If you have the kind of life that I've had — that I have — it is so spectacular,\" he said. \"I could not ever articulate how spectacular it was.\"\n\nRead next\n\nAdvertisement"
