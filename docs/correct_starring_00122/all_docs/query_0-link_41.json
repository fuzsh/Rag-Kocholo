        "text": "The director of the Predator prequel was asked if there is any chance of bringing Schwarzenegger back into the franchise. Prey director Dan Trachtenberg has revealed that he wants to add Arnold Schwarzenegger (from first Predator) and Danny Glover (from Predator 2) to the next Prey sequel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrey is a science fiction action film which was released in 2022. It is the fifth film in the Predator franchise which is set in the Northern Great Plains in the 1700s. Now (there’s no confirmation), director Dan Trachtenberg is planning for its next film. Let’s see if Prey fans get to see their beloved Arnold Schwarzenegger in the upcoming sequel.\n\nAlso read: “This is where the money is”: Not Terminator, Arnold Schwarzenegger Put His $378M Movie Producer At Ease After James Cameron Ditched Green Screen For Climax\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I don’t know how to do things” – Dan Trachtenberg\n\nThe director told Variety that he still doesn’t know “how to do things.” Here, he meant he has no idea how he would bring Arnie or Glover back for Prey 2. He said:\n\n“I don’t know how to do things, but I’m learning how to do things. I did learn there was an attempt to have Arnold in Predators. All I’ll say is — there’s still time for those guys. They’re still around, and wouldn’t that be awesome?”\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger is the protagonist of the first Predator, released in 1987. While Danny Glover played LAPD Lieutenant Mike Harriman in Predator 2 in 1990.\n\nAlso read: “Arnold and Bruce Willis can get away with things that I can’t”: Sylvester Stallone Felt He Was Trapped in Stereotypical Action Movies Unlike His Archnemesis Arnold Schwarzenegger\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen to Expect the New Predator Sequel\n\nPrey has been a breakout success at the box office. The fifth film in the movie series has scored the best reviews of any Predator film and has received praise from audiences.\n\nThe film is undoubtedly worth watching because it isn’t just another installment of the Predator science-fiction franchise but also a visually cool sequel. In addition to the visual, the powerful music and sound adds so much to the film.\n\nWhile it is still under consideration what will be next for Predator and Prey, Trachtenberg has revealed that “exciting conversations” are ongoing. He said:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I can’t really say anything about that right now, but I’ll say while we were finishing the movie, we were having really exciting conversations.”\n\nHe then continued:\n\n“The studio, myself, the writer, and the producers about what crazy things could we do next. And I’ve never stopped, no one stopped thinking about how cool things could be going forward.“\n\nThough Prey 2 has not been officially announced as of yet. But director Dan Trachtenberg has spoken about having ideas for a follow-up. If we were to play a guessing game, hoping to see a Prey sequel in 2025 would be accurate.\n\nWatch Predator and Predator 2 on Apple TV.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso read: “Your daughter has a great butt”: Arnold Schwarzenegger Creeped Out His Ex-Wife Maria Shriver’s Mother In Their First Meeting, Regrets Risking Marriage With Vulgar Comments"
