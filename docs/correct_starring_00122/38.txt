Predator’s journey from Arnold Schwarzenegger’s iconic 1987 sci-fi action film to a successful Hollywood franchise has been remarkable. Dan Trachtenberg’s 2022 Oscar-nominated installment, Prey, starring Amber Midthunder, has been considered one of the franchise’s best films from its inception, and its success quickly led to the announcement of a sequel.

And recent reports have revealed another upcoming project under the franchise, helmed by Trachtenberg. However, the movie is set to feature a significant deviation from the franchise’s established formula, as, unlike its predecessors, it will reportedly be set in the future.

Dan Trachtenberg is Set to Work on a New Predator Movie

After reinvigorating the sci-fi action horror franchise with the 2022 hit, Prey Dan Trachtenberg is set to work on a new installment for the Predator franchise titled Badlands. The film will not be a sequel to Prey but would rather introduce a fresh narrative set in the future.

With a storyline that ventures into uncharted territory, Badlands will also feature a female lead. Other details surrounding its plot are scarce. Along with Badlands, the studio is reportedly planning a series of new projects under the franchise, including a sequel to the 2022 film, which received acclaim from critics and audiences alike and also became a massive success on Hulu.

While the prospect of exploring new horizons is exciting, it also brings the challenge of navigating unfamiliar territory within the established universe, particularly as it deviates from traditional settings and potentially incorporates advanced human technology.

The Predator Franchise Faces a Risky Turn Away from its Legendary Roots

The newly announced project under the Predator franchise, which will be set in the future, suggests a move towards more advanced human technology, a significant departure from the original film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger along with the 2022 prequel.

Both films traditionally relied on protagonists using basic survival techniques to outsmart the formidable alien predators equipped with advanced invisibility tech, weaponry, and extensive hunting experience.

Schwarzenegger’s Dutch in the 1978 film and Amber Midthunder’s Naru in the 2022 prequel opted for primitive methods, such as covering themselves with mud upon realizing that the creature cannot spot him or using herbs, to counter the predators’ sophisticated capabilities.

However, these strategies do not seem to be as viable in the new installment, which will be set in the future, with the protagonist potentially equipped with more advanced technology to face off against the extraterritorial creature.

While a Predator film set in the future would offer a fresh perspective to the franchise, previous attempts, such as the 2010 film Predators and the 2018 release The Predator, struggled to capitalize on futuristic elements, as both the films received mixed reviews. And with the new installment set in the future, the franchise faces the challenge of maintaining its core identity while exploring uncharted territory.

Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Predator is available to stream on Max.

Prey is available to stream on Hulu.
