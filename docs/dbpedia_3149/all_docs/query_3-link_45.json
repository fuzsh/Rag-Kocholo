        "text": "Today I’ve proudly reached a milestone with my Brian Eno collection. In addition to the dozens of art prints, books, lithographs, 85 digital releases, and other miscellanea I’ve acquired, I’ve now successfully built a sizable library of most major releases issued in the vinyl format by the artist.\n\nWhile there are still a number of bootlegs and collaborative efforts, as well as titles from Eno’s catalog originally issued in the 90s now being released for the first time on vinyl, my library comprises 40 of his best-loved works totaling 64 discs of content, including the highly sought-after Music For Installations 9LP limited edition box set.\n\nThis feature will showcase the most noteworthy elements of my collection to date. I’ll begin with the LPs, themselves. It was quite a challenge to photograph 40 12” multi-disc releases all in one shot, particularly without photographer’s lamps and other equipment, but I’ve done my best using the trusty digital SLR I received from my family when I first started art college twenty-two years ago.\n\nHere are the LPs:\n\nNext, for some art, here is the “Electric Love Blueprint – A History of Electronic Music” theremin schematic created by the Dorothy design collective. The infographic “celebrates over 200 inventors, innovators, artists, composers and musicians who (in our opinion) have been pivotal to the evolution of electronic music, from the invention of the earliest known sound recording device in 1857 to the present day.” Of course, Brian Eno’s name appears typeset in the largest point size of any pioneer cited among the layout.\n\nThe 60 x 80 cm art print is printed with metallic silver ink on 120gsm Keaykolour Royal Blue uncoated stock. It was gifted to me by a dear friend and hangs proudly in my listening room.\n\nNext is a limited edition oversized promotional art print for Eno’s 77 Million Paintings exhibition at Moogfest in 2011.\n\nAnd just for fun, I had a t-shirt printed up with the art from one of the most influential early Eno solo albums, Before and After Science.\n\nI also made sure to track down an original UK pressing of that very album specifically for the large lithographs exclusive to that edition painted by Peter Schmidt. I had the lithographs professionally framed for my dining room.\n\nI also secured both original and remastered pressings of Apollo: Atmospheres & Soundtracks. The Extended Edition includes the For All Mankind bonus LP and I was among the first 250 to order which got me a handsome 42cm x 59cm poster of the Apollo cover artwork which I had framed as well.\n\nI was similarly inspired by Eno’s pioneering ambient effort, Music For Airports, so I prepared a framed print of the sheet music of the album’s score.\n\nThen there is the DVD collecting Eno’s experiments with film, Thursday Afternoon (1984) and Mistaken Memories of Mediaeval Manhattan (1981)\n\nI’ve previously shared my excitement when I learned that Eno had collaborated with one of my other musical heroes, Karl Hyde of Underworld. I framed the pair of postcards included with their two album releases.\n\nThere was also an art print included with original pressings of Eno and Hyde’s first collaboration, Someday World, which I’ve framed in my listening room.\n\nAnd while working as a designer, I independently produced a 24” x 24” oversized PVC-mounted vinyl print of a graphic I designed mapping a chronology of all of Eno’s creative works both as an artist and as a producer. Here is a web-friendly downscaled copy of the artwork with a magnified sample of an area of text.\n\nOf course, what Eno collection would be complete without an edition of the Oblique Strategies oracle deck?\n\nAnd finally, here is my library of thirteen books examining the mind and the art of Brian Eno. It was great fun compiling them all, including a copy of Eno’s own diary, A Year With Swollen Appendices.\n\nThat is the collection to date. I know that it is far from complete. My research reveals an additional 14 vinyl releases far more rare than anything I have and nearly 2,600 releases with Eno named in the credits, but I made sure to collect all of the titles which were of great significance to me, personally.\n\nThank you for permitting me to share my love for great music. Eno and his work are an unparalleled inspiration in my life.\n\nI’ve been reading texts on artist, producer, and self-proclaimed “non-musician” Brian Eno for years, and thought it might be a good idea to start tracking all of the books examining his work in my library. I extracted a list of all Eno-related texts from moredarkthanshark.org and added a few other rare titles from my own archive. Referencing data from my Goodreads account I built a spreadsheet to catalog which texts I’ve read, which I have in physical form, as well as the ones I have as ebooks. I then used an aggregate book search engine to secure physical copies of most of the texts I was missing to build as complete a library as I was able. There are three titles I’ve yet to claim, but they command higher prices than I was ready to import to the States for this first stage of the project.\n\nPictured below are thirteen of my favorite titles on the subjects of Eno’s work, and ambient and generative music in general. There was a week delay in the project after book #13 was lost in the post and I had to order another copy, but at last I have them all.\n\nI was particularly excited to secure a copy of Sound Unbound published by MIT Press, which compiles essays on sample/mashup/remix culture collected by Paul D. Miller (aka DJ Spooky), and which features a Forward by Cory Doctorow, my favorite essayist on the subjects of digital rights activism and copyleftism. And like the Moondog book I recently ordered, it is packaged with a companion compact disc of the works discussed.\n\nPictured are the following:\n\nBrian Eno’s Ambient 1: Music for Airports by John T. Lysaker\n\nAudio Culture: Readings in Modern Music by Christoph Cox\n\nOcean of Sound: Aether Talk, Ambient Sound and Imaginary Worlds by David Toop\n\nA Year With Swollen Appendices by Brian Eno\n\nExperimental Music: Cage and Beyond by Michael Nyman\n\nBrian Eno: His Music And The Vertical Color Of Sound by Eric Tamm\n\nThe Ambient Century by Mark Prendergast\n\nSound Unbound: Sampling Digital Music and Culture by Paul D. Miller\n\nOn Some Faraway Beach: The Life And Times Of Brian Eno by David Sheppard\n\nAnother Green World (33 1/3 Series) by Geeta Dayal\n\nBrian Eno: Visual Music by Christopher Scoates\n\nBrian Eno: Oblique Music by Sean Albiez\n\nMusic For Installations (companion book to the ltd ed. 2018 9LP vinyl box set) by Brian Eno\n\nas well as the official Oblique Strategies deck Eno produced with artist, Peter Schmidt.\n\nAlso read but not pictured:\n\nMusic Beyond Airports – Appraising Ambient Music by Monty Adkins\n\nI really look forward to diving into the yet-unread titles from this indispensable collection. These books will be wonderful company through the chills of winter and shall serve as an intellectually stimulating start to 2020!"
