        "text": "Ladies and gentlemen, it doesn’t get any better than this.\n\nThe postman just delivered two large long-awaited packages to Innerspace, and they are absolutely wonderful treasures.\n\nThe first was a gift item from Ninja Tune Records. For the delay in shipping my limited edition repressing of The Cinematic Orchestra’s Motion LP, Ninja Tune presented me with a huge book with a foil cover – NINJA TUNE: 20 Years of Beats and Pieces.\n\nIt’s 192 glossy pages of color photographs, graphics, and an inside look at the history of this fantastic label.\n\nBut the second package was the holy grail. The largest audio investment (outside of our gear, of course) that Innerspace has ever made for its archive; this limited edition, monstrous gem is the most treasured recording in our library.\n\nI’ve posted video links to the film before, but for the sake of complete-ism I will present it all here in one post, along with the history of the piece and the most exhaustive high-res photo gallery of the set you will find on the Web.\n\nFirst, for those who are not familiar with the story of William Basinski’s legendary recording, here is what happened September 11th, 2001.\n\nFrom the Wiki:\n\nThe Disintegration Loops is based on Basinski’s attempts to salvage earlier recordings made on magnetic tape, by transferring them into digital format; however, the tape had deteriorated to the point that, as it passed by the Tape Head, the ferrite detached from the plastic backing and fell off. Basinski has said that he finished the project the morning of the September eleventh attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City, and sat on the roof of his apartment building in Brooklyn with friends listening to the project as the W.T.C. towers collapsed.\n\nBasinski filmed the smoke billowing from the fallen towers and set the slow decay of his tape loops as the soundtrack for the 9/11 attacks.\n\nThe piece has received considerable critical acclaim –\n\n“Stunning… the most amazing piece of process music I’ve ever heard.”\n\n– Pitchfork’s Top 200 Albums of the 2000s\n\n“Overwhelming… transfixing.”\n\n– The New York Times\n\n“Poignant and harrowing.”\n\n– The Wire\n\n“Astonishing.”\n\n– NPR\n\n“Essential.”\n\n– FACT\n\nAnd there’s more.\n\nFor the 10th anniversary of the event, musicians gathered at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on September 11, 2011, and performed the slow decay of the loops with a live orchestra. A similar performance was taped at the 54th Venice Biennale.\n\nFinally, on September 4, 2012, New-York based record label Temporary Residence reissued 2000 copies of the entire Disintegration Loops series, the film and the two previously unreleased live performances as a massive 9xLP + 5CD + DVD box set, marking the project’s 10-year anniversary as well as its impending induction into the National September 11 Memorial & Museum. The set also included a 12″ x 12″ print and a 144 page 12″ x 12″ book – a chronological collection of frames from the Disintegration Loops film.\n\nAnd once again, for complete-ists sake, you’ll find the original Disintegration Loops film and an NPR link to the 10th anniversary Wordless Music performance below."
