        "text": "Alexandre Pato might have struggled to make an impression on the Premier League.\n\nBut the former Chelsea striker was, at one stage, one of the hottest youngsters in the game.\n\nThe Brazilian arrived at AC Milan in 2007 â€“ as a fresh faced 17-year-old.\n\nAnd, according to Italian football expert Tancredi Palmeri, was faced with an immediate choice.\n\nBetween Playboy and religion.\n\nThe Duck was speaking to Fox Basil about his time with the Rossoneri.\n\nAnd, judging some his past misdemeanours, it's fair to say he opted for Ronaldinho's 'Playboy' route.\n\nThe former Blues star's first marriage (to Sthefany Brito) lasted less than 10 months and the pair split due to Pato's 'constant partying'\n\nHe also had a brief dalliance with Miss Brazil Debora Lyra in 2010.\n\nThen between 2010 and 2013, Pato was dating non-other than Barbara Berlusconi, daughter of AC Milan owner Silvio.\n\nBut, of course, that didn't last and he was then linked with Albanian model and actress Almeda Abazi.\n\nAnd, according to reports, the now-Villarreal forward is dating Brazilian actress model and TV presenter Fiorella Mattheis, as Dream Team has 'reported' in the past.\n\nBut who's the real winner?"
