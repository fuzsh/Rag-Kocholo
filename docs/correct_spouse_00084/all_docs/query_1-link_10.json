        "text": "Nine months and 13 days. This was the time it took for the fairy tale, played by Sthefany Brito and Alexandre Pato, to end. The actress and the footballer, who married a bash valued at R$ 1 million in the Copacabana Palace on 7 July last year, failed to overcome a crisis in their relationship and decided to put an end to the union. Pato left the apartment he shared with his wife in Milan, Italy, and is temporarily living in a hotel. Sandra, mother of Sthefany, is in Italy and is helping her daughter overcome this bad time. Close friends to the actress said she is resolving some personal problems back in Milan, and as soon as possible, will return to Brazil. The aviation chaos in Europe is also a factor that hinders her return to Rio.\n\nIn the last 7 days, the EXTRA journalist, Gilmar Ferreira, published in his column \"Football and all that\" the AC Milan striker had turned into a figurine in the nightlife in Milan, often in the company of Ronaldinho. The wife of soccer star, of course, went on to become irritated with the outputs of the husband, since he had asked her to leave work to join him in Italy. Sthefany was the role of Cecilia Dassi in \"Living Life\", but she gave up the job on behalf of marriage.\n\nSthefany leaves the marriage with nothing. She and Pato are united under a contract of total separation of assets. Friends say that, during the preparation of the wedding, Pato said Sthefany could get married under the community property. But suddenly, there was a lawyer who guided the change in the contract. The justification of it: \"If you are marrying for love, then it shouldn't matter.\" The girl was hurt by the conversation, but in love, accepted the new condition of the athlete.\n\nPeople close to Sthefany say that other wives of soccer players who have some familiarity with the couple directed her not to separate. \"Soccer player are like that, let it go,\" one of them said to Sthefany. The actress, apparently, did not listen to the advice of \"friends.\"\n\nWith seven jobs in the curriculum, Sthefany has a contract with TV Globo to the middle of this year. Before the marriage, the actress thought to dedicate herself exclusively to the miniseries in order to not stay long away from her home and husband. With new life, however, Sthefany must give the guys on TV as soon as possible.\n\nhere via here with the help of google translation"
