        "text": "MILAN, July 20 (Serie A) - AC Milan striker Alexandre Pato believes Ronaldinho's arrival at the San Siro will turn the Rossoneri into world beaters.\n\nRonaldinho finally completed his long-awaited switch to the Serie A giants on Thursday, training with the team for the first time the following day.\n\nMilan are hoping to bounce back from last season's disappointing campaign where they finished fifth, a result that saw them miss out on a Champions League spot, and Pato feels that with Ronaldinho on board they will sweep all before them.\n\n'We will try to win the Scudetto and now that Ronaldinho has arrived we can win everything,' Pato told Italian sports daily Gazzetta dello Sport.\n\n'We will fight for the UEFA Cup and for the Copa Italia, even though the league is our first priority.'\n\nRonaldinho's arrival has generated a wave of excitement which the Italian media are dubbing 'Dinho mania'.\n\nThousands of spectators gathered outside Milan's training ground in the hope of catching a glimpse of the new signing on Wednesday, while 40,000 fans turned up to the San Siro 24 hours later for his presentation ceremony.\n\nSuch fan fervour does not surprise Pato, who is used to the affection afforded to his fellow Brazilian in his home country.\n\n'Dinho deserves this welcome because he is one of the great ones, a phenomenon,' added the 18-year-old.\n\n'I grew up in Porto Alegre and Ronaldinho was born there, In the city all they talk about is that he is a legend.\n\n'I dream about arriving at his level. He has brought to Milan much happiness, he plays while smiling and that is his secret.'\n\nWe presented soccer sage Tyler Duffy with a challenge: Using a 3-5-2 formation, pick the best team in the world. And then select their backups. Some might argue that the 4-4-2 is more commonly used, but this formation is a cheesy attempt to squeeze in another talented midfielder, since there seem to be more of those than skilled defenders. Seen here, two of the 11’s finest, Ronaldo and Messi.\n\nGK: Gigi Buffon (Juventus, Italy):Gigi is possibly a facist, and possibly bet on Juventus matches, but he makes saves so impossible you can’t tell whether he intended them.\n\nD: Ricardo Carvalho (Chelsea, Portugal):Carvalho’s nickname is The Master of the Dark Arts and Wayne Rooney isn’t his biggest fan. But, the Portugal man may be the best pure defender in the world and, unlike John Terry, he can be an effective player with the ball.\n\nD: Rio Ferdinand (Man U, England):Rio is a renaissance man. He enjoys Christmas parties, cypriot vacations with Frank Lampard and the occasional puff. He may also be found “merking” his teammates like an even less funny Ashton Kutcher. He’s also a tremendous athlete and a suffocating physical presence for opposing forwards.\n\nD: Nemanja Vidic (Man U, Serbia):Vidic is a solid, no-nonsense defender. He’s the perfect yin to Ferdinand’s yang.\n\nM: Cristiano Ronaldo (Man U, Portugal):Enough said.\n\nM: Cesc Fabregas (Arsenal, Spain):Cesc is the best pure passer in the world, and has added a flair for the dramatic goal. He matured greatly last season and during the Euros.\n\nM: Michael Essien (Chelsea, Ghana):Essien is soccer’s meast. He’s powerful. He’s quick. He can play any position. And, he can score goals like this. It’s hard to believe that he’s still so underrated.\n\nM: Kaka (AC Milan, Brazil):He led Milan oldsters to Champions League glory. Best player on the Brazilian national team. Has a miraculous aura, which is not surprising, since he belongs to Jesus.\n\nM: Wesley Sneijder (Real Madrid, Netherlands):He was the best player in Spain for much of the 2007-08 season, and the heat behind the Dutch Oven at Euro 2008.\n\nF: Fernando Torres (Liverpool, Spain):Scored the Euro 2008 Final winner for Spain. He was the best striker by far in England last season. Well respected by men, even if he is a pretty boy.\n\nF: Leo Messi (Barcelona, Argentina):The Maradona comparisons are apt. Messi may be the best player in the world when healthy. Hopefully his growth hormone treatments as a child haven’t screwed him up permanently.\n\nApologies to GK: Iker Casillas (Real Madrid, Spain), D:Kolo Toure (Arsenal, Ivory Coast), M:Frank Ribery (Bayern Munich, France), F: David Villa (Valencia, Spain).\n\nFive to watch: Alexandre Pato (A.C. Milan, Brazil), Sergio Aguero (Atletico Madrid, Argentina), Daniele De Rossi (AS Roma, Italy), Theo Walcott (Arsenal, England), Javier Mascherano (Liverpool, Argentina).\n\nNot much has been happening in transfer news this summer. Most of the news has been flooded with Cristiano Ronaldo and Real Madrid. I’m so over\n\nit at the moment and hope C. Ronaldo moves to Real and they end up trophyless next season.The real story that I’m worried about is if AC Milan will land Ronaldinho. Alot of people have said Milan do not need him because they have Kaka but I think Milan can do well with having Ronaldinho in the team.\n\nMilan have struggled for strikers since the lost of\n\nThey have not been able to land a striker and to be honest there aren’t too many star strikers available anyway. Galliani mentioned at the end of the season that there could be a possibility of Kaka playing upfront. Could you imagine that with Ronaldinho in the team?\n\nYou can have Kaka and Pato up front with Ronaldinho, Pirlo and Seedorf supporting them. It would be a dream attack for any club in any league.\n\nThis may well happen as Ronaldinho clearly does not want to play for Manchester City. The English club has offered Barcelona the asking price and are willing to pay Ronaldinho £200k a week. Now that should have been a done deal but the only reason why Ronaldinho has not moved to Manchester City is because he does not want to play for them. Ronaldinho being a star player will not play for a B grade team. No offense to Manchester City but they are no Barcelona or Milan.\n\nRonaldinho’s brother Roberto De Assis has confirmed that Ronaldinho wants to play for Milan and Milan want Ronaldinho.\n\n“Nothing has changed. We know that Milan like Ronaldinho and that Ronaldinho likes Milan and we will continue to work to bring the best player in the world to the best club in the world,” De Assis stated.\n\nHe adde “We have always had a good relationship with Milan and always been in contact,”\n\nIf Ronaldinho does move to Milan I can bet you more people will be watching the UEFA Cup this year.\n\n“The possibility that Ronaldinho will play in the red and black shirt next year is still there and is the same as a few months ago.\n\nPremier League club Arsenal target Diogo Luis Santo has had an alternative offer from an unnamed Serie A side, making it a two-way race for the 21-year old Brazilian striker.\n\nDiogo, who plays for Brazilian team Portuguesa-SP, has already had two offers for him by the Gunners turned down. Portuguesa director Andre Heleno has also confirmed that the Italians bid was turned down, with it also not meeting the clubs valuation of the player, although it is thought it was not by far.\n\n“So far the best offer has been from an Italian side who I cannot name,” Andre Heleno told the press.\n\n“They have bid around £9million, but we want closer to £11million.”\n\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger has been trying to sign Diogo for the last three months, revealed club President Manuel da Lupa, also confirming the rejection of the two offers made.\n\nLupa also stated his plan to increase Diogo’s value to gain maximum profit from his star player.\n\n“We want Diogo to play in the Brazilian league until the end of the year, reach the national team, and increase his value,” he said.\n\nHis agent Rodrigo Righetti has admitted that his client would favour a move to the Premiership to join Arsenal.\n\n“Diogo would love to play for Arsenal. But for now, he must wait for an offer that suits both the club and himself,” he said\n\nOne stumbling block however could be a British work permit, with it unlikely Diogo would get one for next season, unless he was able to make a successful ‘Special talent’ visa application.\n\nDiogo scored 22 goals in 29 appearances for Portuguesa last season and will line up alongside AC Milan forward Alexandre Pato at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.\n\nINNSBRUCK, Austria (AP) - If Luiz Felipe Scolari feared his impending move to Chelsea might distract him from guiding Portugal toward a European Championship title, he needn't have worried.\n\nThe Chelsea fans, the British media, the bookmakers and, who knows, even Blues owner Roman Abramovich, are doing his new job for him.\n\nThe Portugal coach is on his way to one of the biggest and toughest jobs in soccer. Judging by Portugal's form and results, he could well go there with a European title to go along with the 2002 World Cup he won as Brazil's coach.\n\nWith this in mind, he can easily concentrate on Portugal and has effectively banned all talk of the Chelsea job from news conferences, the next of which is Saturday, the day before his team faces already-eliminated Switzerland in Group A. But the British media, with no team to follow because the English, Irish, Scots and Welsh all failed to qualify, are hungry for stories about Scolari and Chelsea.\n\nThe old season is not even cold and the new one is effectively beginning with Friday's announcement of the draw for the third tier League Cup and Monday's release of the full Premier League schedule. That means the European Championship takes something of a back seat compared with the transfer news involving the likes of Manchester United's Cristiano Ronaldo and Chelsea's Frank Lampard. Scolari's move to Chelsea has topped it all.\n\nThere are so many implications to the move.\n\nBefore it was announced, the fact that former Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho had joined Inter Milan prompted speculation that some of his Portuguese countrymen - such as Ricardo Carvalho and Paulo Ferreira - might follow him from Stamford Bridge to San Siro.\n\nWith the current - for now - coach going to west London, Carvalho and Ferreira likely will be happy to stay.\n\nThen there is the Brazilian connection.\n\nNewspapers are suggesting that Chelsea - with a seemingly bottomless pit of the owner's cash to spend - might tempt AC Milan to let go of Kaka or Alexandre Pato. Or Scolari might join the chase for FC Barcelona's Ronaldinho and Real Madrid's Robinho, both out of form but with the talent to bounce back under a different coach.\n\nThe British bookmakers are already thinking even further ahead.\n\nNot only are they offering odds on what titles he will win with the Blues next season, they have even opened a book on how long he will last at Stamford Bridge and who will replace him.\n\nWith Portugal doing well at its third straight major championship - Scolari also led the team to the final at Euro 2004 and semifinals of the 2006 World Cup - he can also keep an eye on other Chelsea stars, such as Germany's Michael Ballack, Petr Cech of the Czech Republic and Claude Makelele and Nicolas Anelka of France.\n\nScolari's arrival for the first time in English soccer comes two years after he turned another huge job down. The Football Association interviewed him for the national team role after it was known that Sven-Goran Eriksson was leaving and reportedly spoke to him three times. But Scolari was scared off by the impact a demanding and inquisitive media might have on his family and stayed with Portugal.\n\nEngland chose Steve McClaren, who wasn't even second choice, failed to qualify for Euro 2008 and now Fabio Capello is in charge.\n\nNegotiations for Scolari's move to Chelsea are understood to have begun a month ago and even the Portuguese federation admitted they have been going on \"for some time.\"\n\nThere is one part of this championship which appears to be preparing Scolari for the Premier League - the appalling weather.\n\nTorrential rain both in Switzerland and Austria has plagued the tournament with the conditions from Basel to Klagenfurt resembling February rather than June.\n\nScolari has it still to come, but now he has a feel for what it's like in Manchester, Birmingham and Newcastle - albeit without the mountains.\n\nPato is hoping to play alongside his childhood hero once more.\n\n“I would like it a lot if we could play together,” Pato, 17, told GQ magazine.\n\n“We are really good friends.\n\n“Ronnie is going through a rough patch at the moment. The media are always hounding him.\n\n“Nevertheless, he has such a great character that I expect he will get over his injury and image problems.\n\n“We talk all the time, but never about football. He always asks me how I am doing. It’s crazy, Ronaldo is my idol.”\n\nThe teenage sensation also shared his opinion on the Italian game and it seems as if he had to learn fast the hard way.\n\n“I remember Cristian Ledesma repeatedly hitting me - massacring me. I was not bothered. Actually, I like playing this way. It has made me grow up,” said Pato\n\n“In Brazil, you get the ball and are allowed 20 seconds to look up and think about what you are going to do.\n\n“Here, instead, you have three seconds to do something before someone like Ledesma arrives.”\n\nPato scored nine goals in 18 games for Milan this season and in that explosive form he is sure to be one of the best in future if he continues working hard at San Siro.\n\nPato began his playing career at Internacional in Porto Alegre, where he played for both the youth and senior teams between 2001 and 2007. On his first team debut, at the age of 17, Pato helped Internacional to a 4-1 win over Palmeiras on November 26, 2006. He had created three of the goals and scored the other goal.\n\nPato scored Internacional's second goal of the 2006 FIFA Club World Cup on December 13 in the semi-final game against Al-Ahly Cairo, helping the team win 2–1 and a spot in the final. With this goal, Pato took Pelé's record as youngest scorer in the history of official FIFA competitions (17 years and 102 days, against Pelé's 17 years and 239 in the 1958 FIFA World Cup against Wales). He was substituted in the final of the competition, before team-mate Adriano Gabiru scored the winner, ensuring the title for Internacional.\n\nPato was linked to several high profile clubs including Benfica,Juventus, Inter,Chelsea and Arsenal.\n\nHe helped Brazil win the 2007 South American Youth Championship, which qualified the country for the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup, and has been selected by Dunga for the 2008 Summer Olympics.\n\nHe scored his first goal for the senior team on his debut against Sweden at the Emirates Stadium on March 26, 2008.\n\nAlexandre Pato played with Brazil versus Venezuela on June 6 at the Gillette Stadium in Foxboro."
