I really want to play for them.\"\n\nPato is keen to throw himself into life at Stamford Bridge, and says he will get up to speed quickly despite not having played since 28th November.\n\n\"I'm very happy... and very nervous.\n\n\"I want to meet my new team-mates so I can adapt as quickly as possible.\n\n\"Yes, it's been a while without playing, but nothing that my new colleagues can't help me with.\"\n\nPato impressed on loan at Sao Paulo last year, getting his career back on track after flopping at Corinthians, who paid AC Milan €15million for his services."
