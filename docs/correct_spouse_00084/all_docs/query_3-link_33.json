        "text": "Rio de Janeiro: Brazilian soccer club Corinthians has revealed its interest in signing AC Milan striker Alexandre Pato.\n\nPato has endured an injury-plagued season with the Serie A club, managing just 18 appearances this season.\n\nHis left thigh strain suffered earlier this month was the Brazil international's 14th muscle-related injury since January 2010, reports Xinhua.\n\nBut Corinthians director of football Duilio Alves said the club was willing to sign the 22-year-old.\n\n\"I have followed his situation closely. He is a great player and our doors are open for him to come here and recover,\" Alves told Lancenet.\n\nCorinthians are on the lookout for another striker after the departure of Adriano last month. The ex-Inter Milan and Roma forward was released by the Sao Paulo club following reports of disciplinary problems and a lack of commitment from the former Brazil star.\n\n\"We need a center forward and we need to think big,\" Alves said. \"We have looked at (Diego) Forlan and we are also weighing up players at other European clubs.\"\n\nPato's agent Gilmar Veloz, who also represents Corinthians coach Tite, would not be drawn on the star's mooted return to Brazil.\n\n\"His focus is on getting over his injuries and playing again, then we will see. I can't say anything about interest from other clubs,\" Veloz said.\n\nPato, who earns an estimated four million euros a year, was almost signed by French club Paris Saint-Germain in January for a reported 28 million euros.\n\nIt is understood the move was blocked by Milan president Silvio Berlusconi, who is the father of Pato's partner, Barbara.
