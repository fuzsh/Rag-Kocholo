        "text": "Pulse Sports takes a look at the list of the richest footballers and their main sources of income.\n\nDespite their dominance and successes on the pitch, neither Cristiano Ronaldo nor Lionel Messi are the richest footballers in the world.\n\nFootball has produced celebrities, and given the salaries and deals these celebrities enjoy, some have gathered enormous wealth.\n\nBut given that Ronaldo and Messi are not the richest, then who is the richest footballer in the world? Take a look.\n\n10. Alexandre Pato - $150 million\n\nApart from making his wealth on the pitch playing for Corinthians, Chelsea, Villareal, and AC Milan, the Brazilian footballer generated part of his wealth from other investments.\n\nSome other sources for his wealth include CoverGirl Cosmetics endorsements, real estate, a chain of restaurants, a vodka line, a fashion line, and others.\n\nHis current wealth, according to Daily Mail, is estimated at $150 million, which makes him the 10th richest footballer in the world.\n\n9. Ronaldo - $160 million\n\nNicknamed R9 or O Fenomeno (The Phenomenon), the Selecao legend is considered one of the greatest players of his generation.\n\nHe was named FIFA World Player of the Year three times and won the Ballon d'Or on two occasions.\n\nOff-pitch, his success is marked by the number of cars he owns, which include several Bugattis, a Maserati, and a Lamborghini Aventador and is also the majority owner of LaLiga side Real Valladolid.\n\nHis Brazilian home includes many bedrooms, a large swimming pool, and an extensive garden for practicing sports and hosting parties.\n\nHe was sponsored by Nike for most of his playing career, and this is another source of Ronaldo’s wealth.\n\nApart from being a celebrated football icon, Ronaldo is one of the richest footballers.\n\n8. Wayne Rooney - $170 million\n\nThe former Everton and Manchester United forward was one of the best-paid footballers and ranked fifth in the world and No. 1 in England, according to the 2012 France Football survey of the world’s best-paid players.\n\nRooney enjoyed several endorsement deals with Nike, Nokia, Ford, Asda, and Coca-Cola and appeared on seven consecutive UK-version covers of Electronic Arts' FIFA video game series from FIFA 06 to FIFA 12.\n\nApart from his salaries and endorsements during his active playing days, he has also generated part of his wealth as a manager. He is the DC United coach now, having managed Championship club Derby County before.\n\nZlatan Ibrahimovic - $190 million\n\nThe Swede has more than 500 club goals and has been active despite most of his peers retiring.\n\nThe giant striker has made appearances for Malmo, Ajax, AC Milan, Inter, Juventus, Barcelona, Paris Saint Germain, Manchester United, and LA Galaxy.\n\nIn 2019, Ibrahimovic was announced to have bought 23.5 percent of the shares in Hammarby IF, a Swedish top flight club.\n\nHe is arguably one of the most celebrated football icons, and his wealth is estimated at $190 million, making him one of the richest footballers.\n\n6. Neymar - $200 million\n\nNeymar has been awarded the FIFA Puskás Award, named in the FIFA FIFPro World 11 twice, the UEFA Team of the Year twice, and the UEFA Champions League Squad of the Season three times.\n\nAn 11-year contract with Nike ended in August 2020 after a Nike employee made a sexual assault complaint against him.\n\nApart from Nike, the Brazilian has signed deals with Puma, Panasonic – which paid US$2.4 million to secure his services for two years), Volkswagen, Tenys Pe Baruel, Lupo, Ambev, Claro, Unilever, and Santander.\n\nHe has been featured on the front covers of the video games Pro Evolution Soccer 2012 and 2013 on the North American version, another source of his wealth.\n\nHe is estimated to be the sixth-richest footballer in the world.\n\n5. Dave Whelan - $210 million\n\nHe is not a popular name among current football fans, but he is estimated to be one of the richest footballers in the world.\n\nHe began his career in the English football league and then retired to venture into business and open a series of supermarkets.\n\nHe became a successful businessman after retiring in 1966 after playing for Blackburn Rovers and Crewe Alexandra.\n\nThe former left back has since become a successful businessman following his retirement in 1966,\n\nHe was the former Wigan Athletic owner and chairman of the club for twenty years, before passing the position over to his grandson, David Sharpe.\n\nHis JJB Sports became a chain of seven stores by 1980 and is currently ranked as the UK’s second biggest sports retailer.\n\n4. David Beckham - $450 million\n\nOne of the richest footballers in the world, whose wealth is estimated at $450 million.\n\nThe retired forward is the first English player to win league titles in four countries: England, Spain, the United States, and France.\n\nBeckham is a former Manchester United, Preston North End, Real Madrid, Milan, LA Galaxy, Paris Saint-Germain, and England national team player.\n\nHe retired in 2013, and in the following year, Beckham bought an MLS expansion team, Inter Miami, for $25 million.\n\nHe has also featured in EA Sports' FIFA video game series and was on the cover of the UK edition of FIFA 98.\n\nIn 2020, EA Sports had an agreement with the 47-year-old to feature in FIFA 21. He would earn £40 million from a three-year deal.\n\n3. Cristiano Ronaldo - $500 million\n\nThe 21st century sporting phenomenon is ranked as the third richest footballer in the world.\n\nHe is currently playing for Saudi Arabia’s Al Nassr after sealing a mega deal in 2022.\n\nThe Portuguese international has won five Ballon d'Or awards and four European Golden Shoes, which is the most by a European player.\n\nHe has written impressive club histories with clubs; he won the Premier League with Manchester United, La Liga with Real Madrid, the Champions League with both United and Madrid, and the UEFA Nations League with Portugal.\n\nRonaldo has signed multiple sponsorship deals with consumer products companies, sportswear companies, and football boots. Since 2012, Ronaldo has worn the Nike Mercurial Vapor personalized CR7 edition.\n\nHe has featured as the cover star of EA Sports' FIFA 18 video game and was heavily involved in the game's promotion.\n\nHis social media presence is understood to have been part of his wealth generating sources. He is the most-followed person on Facebook (162 million), the most-followed on Instagram (554 million), and the most-followed sportsperson on Twitter (107.9 million).\n\nHis sponsors reportedly earned $936 million in media value across his accounts between June 2016 and June 2017.\n\n2. Lionel Messi - $600 million\n\nThe Argentina captain has won almost everything on the pitch.
