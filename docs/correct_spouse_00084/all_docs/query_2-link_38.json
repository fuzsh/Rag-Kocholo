        "text": "The build-up to the 29th April 2011 wedding of Prince William of Wales and Catherine ‘Kate’ Middleton has generated the kind of wall-to-wall coverage that only once-in-a-generation nuptials, wars or FIFA World Cup hosting rights contests can. But while a seemingly infinite amount of rainforest has been expended speculating upon which dukedom the couple may be allocated or the attendance of certain Middle Eastern aristocrats, few if any seem to be asking whether the soon-to-be Princess Catherine represents the most imaginative choice of spouse in the present climate. While Kate Middleton will almost certainly be hugely popular – at least initially – in the heartlands of Middle England, the young lady from the Parish of Bucklebury is unlikely to add significant value to the economy of the United Kingdom; given that ceteris paribus the UK is likely to struggle to retain the position of global economic pre-eminence it has enjoyed for much of the past two centuries, this is not an entirely insignificant issue.\n\nCould other brides have offered more tangible relief from an imbalanced, debt-ridden and resource-light economy? Prince William – the Succession to the Crown Act 1707 notwithstanding – would have done well to consider the following potential candidates:\n\n1. Irina Shaykh. Born Irina Shaykhislamova in 1986 at Yemanzhelinsk, a small town in the southern Urals near the Russian Federation’s border with Kazakhstan, Shaykh has swapped a provincial existence for the life of an über-international model with apparent ease. But she has far more to recommend her than traffic-stopping looks: via her Russian nationality and Tatar ethnicity, Shaykh could have been a vital bridge between the UK and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, an entity that is a cross between NATO and the EU in terms of functions and which includes Russia and China as its two biggest member states, with four mineral-rich Central Asian territories completing the present roster. Instead, the 1.78m talent appears to have attached herself to that most uncommon of commoners, Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\n2. Katrina Kaif. Arguably the most eligible single woman in the world’s biggest film industry, twenty-six-year-old Kaif – one of eight children born to an Indian Kashmiri father and an English mother – has seen her stock gradually rise in Bollywood to the point where she is almost synonymous with the word ‘blockbuster’; her career was kick-started by a starring role in the 2007 international hit Namastey London, apposite since Kaif is a British national who works in India on an employment visa. Her status in India – where major film stars are deities in a way that celebrities in Europe and North America can barely conceptualise – means that Kaif could have opened doors for the UK in an economy that Goldman Sachs estimates will surpass the United States in US dollar terms by 2043. She will instead make progress with Dostana 2, a comedy set to be released later this year.\n\n3. Sthefany Brito. A Brazilian national whose first name is the bane of spellcheckers everywhere, the twenty-three-year-old Brito notched a Most Promising Newcomer award from the Sao Paulo Association of Art Critics back in 2001 for her performance as Samira, a Moroccan girl in the Globo telenovela The Clone. The immensely cute Paulista is also a young divorcée, having already married and divorced hyperactive AC Milan and Brazil forward Alexandre Pato. As princess, she could have increased British influence in the Americas and particularly in her country of birth, now the seventh largest economy in the world by nominal GDP and one which is undergoing a social transformation that renders it unrecognisable from the Brazil of recent decades; a future as the spouse of another technically-accomplished footballer surely beckons.\n\n4. Carissa Putri. Of Indonesian, German and Dutch extraction, Frankfurt-born Carissa Putri Soelaiman is the most exotic bridal candidate. The face of Rexona, TelkomSpeedy and Marie France Bodyline, the twenty-six-year-old – an alumnus of Pelita Harapan University’s Faculty of Social and Political Sciences – also has a burgeoning acting career, with her most famous role to date being that of an Egyptian Coptic Christian in the intriguingly titled drama Ayat Ayat Cinta (‘Verses of Love’, 2008). More practically, Putri represented the keys to the heart of ASEAN, presently a bloc of ten member states in South-East Asia with a 2010 GDP of nearly US$2trn and which has concluded free trade agreements with – amongst other countries – China, Japan, India and Australia. Putri is pressing home this point in her current role as Brand Ambassador for Nokia Indonesia.\n\n5. Lena Meyer-Landrut. A high school graduate who came from nowhere to win the 2010 Eurovision Song Contest as a nineteen-year-old, Meyer-Landrut offered extraordinary princess potential. Her genuinely iconic looks and charismatic eccentricity might have revitalised the House of Windsor in a way that little else could; her bloodline (Hungarian nobility) and nationality (German) made her a perfect fit for a family whose original name is Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. But even more attractive than this: the chance to anchor the United Kingdom to Europe’s powerhouse economy, the land of the mittelstand, the exporter’s exporter. This missed opportunity will become all the more apparent if Meyer-Landrut bags the 2011 Eurovision title, an occurrence that is almost as certain as William and Kate getting married.\n\nIn his much misunderstood magnum opus The End of History and the Last Man, Francis Fukuyama writes of a time when a combination of material prosperity and physical security sound the death knell for culture. While comprehensively examining such a proposition is probably beyond the scope of this blog, it is interesting to note that in certain aspects of popular culture, the US and UK – countries which not so long ago were regarded as being culturally prolific – seem to be experiencing, at the very least, something of a hiatus.\n\nComedy is one area where this trend is manifesting itself. Seinfeld and Friends, the cultural wallpaper for so many in the Anglosphere in the 1990s remained so in the 2000s; adequate replacements for the ten post-Nietzschean New Yorkers have not yet been located. The former program even made a comeback for one episode within another series, Curb Your Enthusiasm, in 2009, eleven years after its original finale. Meanwhile, in the UK, Only Fools and Horses has been repeated to the point where it is virtually omnipresent.\n\nA similar tendency is apparent in pop music, where the 1990s and 2000s saw the art form cannibalise itself to the point where poor facsimiles of the three previous decades – with additional portions of narcissism heaped on top – became the new cutting-edge. Arguably the most emblematic band of the era – Oasis – were also the most self-consciously indebted to their influences.\n\nIn an era when YouTube gives us an almost unfathomably complete archive of music and comedy, are we in the UK and US fulfilling Fukuyama’s prophecy by being curators of the past, as opposed to creators in the present? Or will music in the Anglosphere be infused and rejuvenated by English-language compositions from countries from the rest of the world, particularly linguistically-similar countries such as Sweden and Germany, and will we find it within ourselves to laugh at life once more?"
