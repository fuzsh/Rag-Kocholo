With so many options, how do you know which one is the right fit for your child? No. 1 Soccer Camps Regional Director Christine Huber asks the twelve vital questions parents should pose to potential camps to ensure a rewarding and safe soccer camp experience.\n\nASK YOUR SOCCER CAMP THE TOUGH QUESTIONS\n\n1) How many years has the camp been in the business?\n\nExperience matters. While it is not always a guarantee of a superior camp, this can be an excellent indicator of the caliber of the camp experience, its management, and its coaches. No. 1 Soccer Camps has been in continuous operation for over 40 years. VERY few camps can make this claim, and we are proud of our tradition and history.\n\n2) Is the camp a soccer specific camp or a camp that offers soccer? Which is best for your child?\n\nA camp that offers soccer may have different activities and may not be focused on just on soccer. Dances, plays, and skits may be incorporated into the camp day which limits the amount of time spent on soccer. No. 1 Soccer Camps is a specific soccer camp geared towards the player who loves the game. We offer on and off the field soccer specific training, films, and lectures to make sure the camper gets the most comprehensive soccer experience. Each session we see amazing improvements in the campers’ skills in a relatively short amount of time.\n\n3) How does a camp facilitate maximum amount of touches on the ball to foster the most positive results over a short period of time?\n\nMany camps play 11 vs 11 games which means some players are only getting a few touches a game. In these camps you will also see drills with long lines and campers waiting to shoot or touch a ball due to limited equipment and staff. With well thought out and designed lesson plans, No. 1 Soccer Camps plays small sided tactical games based on a recently broken down technical skill. This not only increases the amount of touches on the ball but also mentally prepares players for tight situations in the final third of the field. Field players are preparing and taking more shots while goalkeepers continuously have shots coming at them. We bring in full sized official goals to mimic the real game.\n\n4) How does the camp challenge its players? Will the camp allow the player to “play up” if warranted?\n\nEvery player needs to be challenged physically and mentally in order to improve. A good camp will be flexible enough to adjust to the needs of every camper. During the first session of camp, our staff evaluates the campers and makes any necessary adjustments under the direction of the Camp Director and Striker/ Goalkeeper Director. This ensures each camper receives a tailored experience geared toward his/her current level of play.\n\n5) What is the average number of training hours per day? How many hours of your camper’s day are actually spent working on the field getting better?\n\nA good camp like No. 1 Soccer Camps will have perfected the proper balance between training, recovery, and free time. We offer evening lectures, group discussions as well as the on the field training to create a comprehensive program geared to the mental and physical needs of the player.\n\n6) What is the staff to camper ratio? Is it 1:8 or less?\n\nThis ratio is required legally by many states. A smaller staff to camper ratio will ensure your player receives the individual attention necessary to improve. No. 1 Soccer Camp aims to have a 1:6 or less ratio at all of our locations.\n\n7) How many years has the Camp Director been running the camp and how extensive are the staff coaches backgrounds in coaching younger players?\n\nNot all professional coaches are capable of coaching youth players. Your camp director and staff coaches should have many years of experience in the camp industry along with coaching the specific age groups. Our No. 1 Soccer Camps Directors are leaders in the soccer community and have been an integral part of our company for many years. Several are even former campers themselves! Our Staff coaches are selected and matched based on coaching experience with a particular age group in mind for maximum success.\n\n8) Does the camp perform background checks on all staff?\n\nMost state legislation requires criminal background checks and SORI checks for ANYBODY around children. Be sure any camp under consideration meets these requirements and thoroughly checks its staff. No. 1 Soccer Camps uses a national company to perform background checks on all staff regardless of state requirements.\n\n9) What kind of access do campers have to the camp site’s facilities besides the fields ie. indoor spaces for inclement weather, dorms, cafeterias, pool, lounges etc?\n\nThe access to and quality of these amenities are important to a camper’s overall experience. No. 1 Soccer Camps chooses its locations based on the excellence of the facilities and the needs of our campers. The quality and stellar reputation of No. 1 Soccer Camps allows us to secure some of the most coveted university and private schools locations in the nation.\n\n10) How is the camp supervised? Do coaches, directors, and medical staff stay on campus? Is there adequate staff coverage in the dorms?\n\nSafety is a paramount parental concern and proper staff supervision is necessary to make sure campers are well cared for on and off the pitch. At No. 1 Soccer Camps our directors, coaches and camp nurse are on campus throughout out the day and night to provide supervision and assistance 24 hours a day.\n\n11) How does the camp prepare it’s players for the collegiate experience?\n\nOnly a few camps address the many issues the college-bound player faces. Collegiate level training, recruitment, and application processes are just a few of the areas our College Showcase ID, College Prep and Sr. Academy programs address both on and off the field.\n\n12) How are players evaluated?\n\nCamp is over. Now what? At many camps, once the last session is played, you are on your own. On the final day of No. 1 Soccer Camps, each camper receives a written 75 point evaluation, the most in depth detailed soccer camp evaluation in the industry. Our staff takes great pride in the quality of each camper’s evaluation and the Personal Development Plan which offers a post camp game plan for the further enhancement of each camper’s abilities. Campers and parents have the opportunity to review and discuss the evaluation with the camper’s staff coach at the end of camp creating a positive conclusion to camp’s training.\n\nRegional Director Christine Huber has been with No. 1 Soccer Camps since 1996. A former four year starter and Hall of Fame Player for the University of New Haven, Huber is now the head coach at Hamden Hall Country Day School and Assistant Coach at the University of New Haven. The following No. 1 Soccer Camp locations are under her direction: Brewster Academy, Northfield Mount Hermon, Pomfret School, CFC Arena, and Hamden.\n\nMLS Winningest Goalkeeper Nick Rimando\n\nNO.1 ALUM SETS MLS RECORD FOR MOST GK WINS\n\nFormer No. 1 Camper and Staff Coach – and current Real Salt Lake Goalkeeper – Nick Rimando – made history last weekend as he recorded his 181st win, the most in MLS History.\n\nReal Salt Lakes’ 3-1 win over Chicago Fire placed Rimando ahead of an another No. 1 alum, former No. 1 Camper and Staff coachKevin Hartman, who previously held the record for 180 wins. Hartman, a MLS league legend, played for the LA Galaxy, Kansas City Wizards, FC Dallas and New York Red Bulls in a 17-year career.\n\nRimando, 37, has been in the MLS for 17 years, first with the Miami Fusion (2000-01) and D.C. United (2002-06), before landing with and Real Salt Lake (2007-present). He made 11 playoff appearances and won the MLS Cup with RSL in 2009.\n\nBefore last weekend, Rimando already held the MLS record for clean sheets with 126, and he now holds a career record of 181-135-98, with a 1.19 goals against average, including a league-record 27 penalty-kick saves.\n\nNo. 1 Soccer Camps has a long history of producing the top goalkeepers and players in the US. At one time, No. 1 had 5 starting goalkeepers in MLS – Nick Rimando, Kevin Hartman, Joe Cannon, Matt Reis, and Jon Busch. Today, the 40 year tradition of excellence lives on as No.1 continues to train the next generation of professional soccer players.\n\nNO.1 Parents Tell It Like It Is\n\nThere is a reason No. 1 Soccer Camps has been successfully training players for over 40 years – a commitment to excellence. This commitment is evidenced in every facet of our camp – from our exceptional coaches, to our proven methodology, to our top notch facilities. But don’t just take our word for it, have a look at what parents have to say about our camp this season so far:\n\nCannot even say enough about this great camp at Northfield Mount Hermon. Thank you Christine and all the coaches for pouring into Daniel this week. Special thanks to Jordan who has helped my son’s confidence, skills, and spirit to soar. He respects and admires you. What a great role model you are for our son. You have been instrumental in building his strength, belief and character as a goal keeper. He talked the entire way home about what you and all the other coaches taught him…not only in skill level but also how “to think” and make better decisions on the field. Really?! How many 11 year olds are getting that level of training? Wow. You are all much appreciated. – Jenny via Facebook\n\nI just wanted to shoot you an email thanking you!! Carter had the best camp experience. As you know, this was her first time attending your camp and you are your staff exceeded our expectations. The Vero facility was nicely kept up and I felt very safe and comfortable leaving her there. In addition, you and your staff had energy!! Sometimes I find that the energy fades after the first day, but Carter came home and said how much time the staff spent with her teaching and training her. She came there to learn and become a better soccer player and that is what was accomplished. This experience was so positive for her that her love of soccer has grown. She continues to practice everyday and she loves every minute of it! Thanks again Mike. Carter will absolutely see you at camp next summer. Regards, Kathy\n\nJust wanted to pass along my thanks to you and your staff for a great experience for my daughter. This was her first time away from home and she had a blast. She enjoyed the people, the soccer drills, the food, the pool…just about everything. Before she even left camp, she said she was going to do it again next year. So thanks again for a great camp experience. – Jen R\n\nI just wanted to say what a class act I think your organization is and that I would highly recommend you to other players and parents. My daughter, who is a goalie, fractured her wrist at an overnight camp after spending less than 24 hours at camp and was not medically able to continue. I had no expectations for a full refund (we were hoping for a credit for a future camp). But we received an email stating that our full camp tuition had been refunded, minus a minor handling fee!!! Thank you so much! Your organization will certainly receive our business again in the future and we will spread the word about your exceptional customer service! – Patricia via Facebook\n\nI wanted to pass a few things along since pick up my son From the NMH soccer camp. He absolutely loved this camp, hasn’t stop talk about the coaches, friends, food. Him and his friends really enjoyed and wish was a few days longer. My son had real anxiety about going and this was a great thing for him, thank you to your staff for give him a great week! Thank you. -Michelle\n\nNo. 1 Soccer Camps was founded by Dr. Joseph Machnik in 1977.

As part of this continuing progression, US Soccer has mandated two key changes that will impact youth soccer throughout our country. Theses change will affect your child, and No. 1 Soccer Camps can assist in making this transition as smooth as possible for you and your family.\n\nThe first change will be the nationwide adoption of small-sided standards and the second will be a shift from school-year to calendar year age grouping of teams. “With these initiatives, we’re more likely to have players better prepared down the road” according to Tab Ramos, U.S. Youth Technical Director. “With small sided standards, what we’re trying to do is to help players develop by putting them in an environment where they are constantly involved in the play.”\n\nAt No.1 Soccer Camps, our unique “Go to Goal Curriculum” played 35 yards from the goal, has always employed the small-sided standards concept for maximum touches and realistic game type experience. Our philosophy has always recognized the benefits of small-sided games for our players. By managing the numbers of players and the space they play in, we see tremendous benefits including more interaction, additional touches on the ball, and the increased need for quicker tactical decisions. Our philosophy allows players to learn different positions, become more technically acute, learn tactics quicker, increase fitness, and allow players to become more emotionally and socially involved. Whether you are a goalkeeper or a field player, you will be more active at No. 1 as we create the opportunity for 1000 saves or a 1000 chances on goal during a week of camp.\n\nThe second change from US Soccer is the mandate of players from a school year calendar to acalendar year for the age groupings of teams. We recognize this change has caused much concern and disruption within leagues, clubs, teams, and families. The philosophy of No.1 Soccer Camps has always been to challenge the player based first and foremost on the player’s ability, not just their age. Players regularly play up with their teams at home, and we embrace this concept at No. 1 Soccer Camps. With so many players having to adjust to playing with new teammates and being moved to new teams, there is a tremendous challenge ahead for all involved.\n\nTo assist players and parents in this transition, No. 1 Soccer Camps provides an environment where players can challenge themselves in a positive manner, make new friends, reinvent themselves, and become more prepared for the next season. The new age mandate means players will be jumping in age groups, changing teams or moving to a different club, and we facilitate making that transition easier for the individual player as well as the newly formed team. If you have a son or daughter that is going into a new team and new environment, our training program will expose them to new concepts, new coaches, and new friends – all in a positive and encouraging environment. With No.1, new teams are given the opportunity to train together, play together and team build together as they prepare for the next season.\n\nAs the foremost leader in soccer education for over 40 years, No.1 Soccer Camps has always been ahead of the curve in regards to our curriculum and training concepts. We recognize and embrace the incredible responsibility we have which is to create the most advanced, forward looking curriculum that helps all of our participants become No.1 on their respective teams.\n\nDr. Joe Machnik is the Founder of No. 1 Soccer Camps, FIFA/CONCACAF Match Commissioner, and a Rules Analyst for Fox Sports. No. 1 Soccer Camps was founded by Machnik in 1977. Since then, over 100,000 soccer players and coaches have attended No. 1 Soccer Camps and countless alumni have gone on to playing and coaching careers throughout the national and international soccer ranks. No. 1 Soccer Camps currently offers programs for every level of field players and goalkeepers with residential and day camps at twenty-five locations across the country.\n\nMike Idland Named Head Coach At Suny Brockport\n\nLong time No. 1 Staff Coach Mike Idland was recently named Head Coach for Women’s Soccer at SUNY College at Brockport. SUNY Brockport is a division III program near Rochester, NY competing in the SUNYAC conference. Idland was selected over scores of exceptional candidates due to his impressive resume that spans several different levels of soccer and his achievements as head coach at the University of Pittsburgh at Bradford. A former No. 1 camper, Idland played collegiately at at Suny Cortland. He became a staff coach at No. 1 in 2000 and went on to become a Regional Director in 2004.\n\nIn Idland’s eight seasons with the Panthers, he accumulated a record of 88-54-6, including an Allegheny Mountain Collegiate Conference (AMCC) record of 49-22-2. The Panthers team qualified for seven straight conference postseasons including four straight runner-up seasons. During that time the Panthers have dominated the AMCC awards with numerous All-Conference honors in addition to Offensive and Defensive Player of the Year awards. In addition, Idland was first named the AMCC Coach of the year in 2011 after leading Pitt-Bradford to an impressive 13-3-2 record. He also was awarded the AMCC Co-Coach of the year this past season. Idland’s 2014 team set a new school record after a 15-5-0 year, which also resulted in the program’s first ever regular season championship.\n\nAdditionally Idland serves as a senior staff member of the Region I Girls’ Olympic Development Program (ODP) and as the head coach of the Under-14 Girls team for the Western New York Flash Academy. He also holds a United State Soccer Federation National Coaching “A” (USSF “A”) license.\n\nAt Brockport, Idland will face some No. 1 family rivalry in the SUNYAC conference next season when his team will face off against long-time No. 1 Striker Director, Nick DeMarsh’s Buffalo State University.\n\nIdland recently spoke on his new venture at Brockport and the influence of No. 1 Soccer Camps on his coaching philosophy:\n\nI am excited to be taking on a new challenge. The team has been hovering in the middle of the pack for the SUNYAC, so I am going to try to push the program higher up towards the top of the conference obviously. I think pretty much any coach would come into a new position with that same objective; the real question is how to get it done?\n\nAs far as on-field performance goes, games are basically won and lost in front of both goals. In the recent past, Brockport has been solid in front of our own goal and less so in front of our opponents’ goal. I think that leads me right back to No.1 Soccer Camps, which is obviously all about executing the striker’s role as well as the goalkeepers’. Therefore, plenty of our camp curriculum and methodology will be put in place on the field here just as it has been during my time in my previous position at Pitt-Bradford, where we eventually led our league in virtually every defensive and attacking category.\n\nWhat brings me back to camp on a deeper level is the philosophy. Dr. Machnik has always put it so simply for us over the years there. I can still hear him saying this stuff in my head sometimes: “Do the very best you can under all circumstances.” “Create loyalty.” “Create intrinsic motivation.” “Respect tradition.” “Get in and get out.” These are the types of principles that gave camp such an aura for me as a player and as a staff coach; they are what made it matter on such a deep level. So, I’ve always just tried to implement that same philosophy as best I can into my teams to make it matter on a deep, intrinsic level for my players. I’m looking forward to laying that ground work in front of both goals and inside our heads here at Brockport.\n\nMore by Mike Idland: Understanding The Youth Goalkeeper Mentality (Pt. 1), Mistake Management and Troubleshooting for Goalkeepers (Pt. 2), Adjusting Technique and Training Mentality in Gosalkeepers (Pt. 3) and Out Of Your Mind Breakaways\n\nGear Up For Spring With No. 1 Soccer Camps April Giveaways\n\nSNAG SOME SWEET SOCCER SWAG SIMPLY BY REGISTERING FOR CAMP!\n\nEach week in April, we will be gifting No.1 Soccer Camp apparel and gear to our No.1 Soccer Camps family.\n\nWeek of April 10-16th Goalkeeper Week Each day we will randomly select 1 goalkeeper who has registered for 2016 camp for a free pair of Adidas GK gloves.

If we are unhappy with individual results over a short period of time, we will instantly look to find another team, another club, or another coach for our son or daughter to play for. We often find ourselves asking young children “Did you win?” instead of the more important question “Did you have fun and learn something new?” and this is highlighted in youth sports every day within the United States. There are a variety of different options available now to young soccer players with Soccer Academies, ECNL, ODP and High School to name a few, therefore, if we are unhappy, it becomes easy to find another option.\n\nAs a college coach, I believe the growth of the game has increased enormously in the past decade and every program named above will serve a purpose and create success stories along the way. However, we have to ask ourselves how many of these programs are focused on the process of improving technique and how many are purely focused on results. Joe Machnik’s No.1 Soccer Camps provide a unique environment where young soccer players can break down their individual technique as well as apply it in a match-related game.\n\nI believe that in order to really develop individual technique, you must be willing to work at the skill on a daily basis; not just the 90-120 minutes you spend with your club each week. I truly believe that the Machnik method is the best coaching tool I have witnessed in my career as it enhances player development over a very short period of time.\n\nThere is no doubt that the United States is full of great coaches that will develop talented players but the Machnik method used at No.1 Soccer Camps will give players a technical breakdown that most of them have never received before in areas such as: passing, receiving, placement shooting, and power shooting to name a few. I was fortunate enough to be introduced to No.1 Soccer Camps in the summer of 2004, and I realized very quickly that the Machnik method allowed players to gain an invaluable experience using instruction and positive reinforcement as well as playing match-related games; both field players and goalkeepers.\n\nThe patient atmosphere created at No.1 Soccer Camps allows players to work individually and collectively on skills that their club coaches do not have time for which is why I would strongly recommend the camps to any player who wants to develop their game technically. No.1 Soccer Camps also benefits young coaches who are looking to learn the game from some of its best teachers.\n\nWords cannot express how fortunate I was to learn so much throughout the summer as a young staff coach from the following coaches and current No.1 staff directors: Clark Brisson, Mike Potier, Billy Gordon and Naomi Clarke. I cannot think of many other coaching opportunities that provide a lifetime of networking that No.1 Soccer Camps have given myself and many other coaches and players that are now in the coaching world.\n\nNo. 1 Regional Director Graeme Orr has been with No.1 Soccer Camps since 2003. In addition, he is also the Head Coach of the University of West Alabama Women’s Soccer Team. No. 1 Soccer Camps at University of West Alabama will be under the direction of Graeme Orr and will offer Junior Academy and Senior Academy Programs for players aged 10-18 from July 9th – 12th.

While in Costa Rica, the team competed in four international matches, performed community service, went white water rafting, participated in several cultural events and toured San Jose, Costa Rica’s historical capital. The US Region 1 U15 team won the international tournament for the first time in the 10 years Region 1 has attended and on the tournament’s 10th year anniversary.\n\n“I feel honored and humbled to have been selected to the Region 1 staff for this event,” said Gregg. “The experience for the girls and myself in learning about the culture of Costa Rica, the playing abilities of the Latin American (CONCACAF) born players, and participating in community services in a poverty stricken area and school was incredible. We all left Costa Rica with a much better appreciation of life and the things we have.”\n\nIn Game One, the Region 1 Girls topped Moravia 2-1. With thirteen free kicks and one penalty for the Moravian team, it appeared the Referee was a home team fan, but the US team was able to persevere for the win. In Game Two, the team netted a major victory when they beat a very competitive Dimas Escszu 2-1. Again having to deal with adverse condition of home field advantages, It was a hard-fought game, and the US R1GK had an unbelievable save on one of two penalty kick to ensure the win. After day 2, the Region 1 girls were the only team of the 8 undefeated.\n\nThe girls and coaches had a break from competition on day five where they ventured into the Rain Forest for a team rafting trip down the Sarapiqui River. Day six started with a trip to the Robleato Children’s Center for community service. For players and coaches alike, it was a humbling, but incredibly rewarding experience. While there, the team the players and staff socialized and played with the children. Although children spoke English, the Americans found common ground with a soccer ball at their feet, swings, monkey bars, and other playground equipment. The highlight – and tear jerker – was the 5 year old boy who blessed the team for coming to spend the day to play with them.\n\nInspired by the visit, the team quickly turned it around in preparation for Game Three versus UCEM Alajuela. The team wasted no time with goals at 1:08, 8:47, 22:53, and 25:46 to move onto an impressive 4-0 win. “The game plan was to jump on them right away and score early and often given the referees no decisions in the game,” said Gregg. “We knew if we could get on them fast , we could then control the tempo and get them off their game plan.”\n\nThe R1 team lost their final game to the professional club, Saprissa, 0-2, but due to the point total and goal difference, the Region 1 U15 team nabbed the championship title. While the Region 1 ODP program has been attending this tournament for the last 10 years, this year’s U15 team was the first to ever win the event. Out of the four goals the R1 team gave up, only one was in the run of play. Their keepers faced five PK’s during the course of the tournament and saved two.\n\n‘Of all the fortunate things I have been able to experience through soccer, this was by far one of the BEST things I have ever done! I would do this again no questions asked,” Gregg commented upon his arrival back in the US.\n\nNo. 1 Regional Director John Gregg first came to No. 1 Soccer Camps as a camper in 1985 and later transitioned to a staff coach, GK director, and RD.

No. 1 Founder Dr. Joe Machnik believed the use of small-sided training allowed players a greater number of touches on the ball and, therefore, an increased opportunity to improve their technical and decision-making skills. For these reasons, small sided games continue to be a hallmark of today’s No. 1 Soccer Camp curriculum.\n\nIn my past 19 years with the camp, I am still amazed at the rate which players develop in such a short period of time due to this practice. To continuously have a soccer ball at your feet and playing in various tactical small sided games for eight hours a day, a player becomes more confident and comfortable on the ball which ultimately leads to an increase in playing performance. No. 1 has long known small-sided training works, and US Soccer’s recent initiative is a testament to the sound practices No. 1 Soccer Camps is based upon.\n\nUS Soccer’s Statement on Small Sided Standards\n\nCourtesy of US Soccer\n\nThe coaching initiatives are focused on advancing youth players’ individual skill and intelligence, and providing players with the best opportunity to improve. “Our number one goal is to improve our players down the road and these initiatives will help us do that,” said U.S. Under-20 Men’s National Team head coach and Youth Technical Director Tab Ramos. “With small-sided standards what we’re trying to do is to help players develop by putting them in an environment where they are constantly involved in the play and our changes in birth-year registration will make age groups easier to understand, while aligning our calendar with the international calendar.”\n\nSmall-Sided Standards MALL-SIDED STANDARDS\n\nThe small-sided standards are focused at players from the U-6 to U-12 age groups. The field size is based on age groups, providing a more age appropriate environment that will allow players with a better opportunity to develop heightened soccer intelligence and on-the-ball skills.\n\nThe field dimensions and number of players on the pitch will increase in size from 4v4 to 7v7 to 9v9 as players age, up until they reach the U-13 age group and begin to play full 11v11 matches.\n\n“In general we would like for players to be able to process information faster, and when they are in this environment they are going to learn to do that over a number of years,” Ramos said. “When you have young players in an 11v11 game there are only so many involved in any one play at a time. By taking numbers away and playing 4v4, 7v7, and 9v9, you are multiplying their chances on the ball, increasing their touches and making it overall more for them by making them an active participant at all times. Fast forward 10 years and there are thousands of game situations added to a player’s development.”\n\nFor the complete article on US Soccer’s Initiatives, click here.\n\nNo. 1 Regional Director Christine Huber has been with No. 1 Soccer Camps since 1996 when she began as a Striker Staff Coach. A former four-year starter and Hall of Famer for the University of New Haven, Huber is now the Head Coach at Hamden Hall Country Day School and Assistant Coach at the University of New Haven.

Members of his team include No.1 Soccer Camps staff coaches Nathan Jones and Ben Fitzpatrick.\n\nJones, who was UU’s co-captain and field general on the pitch this season, started 19 matches in goal for the Blue Knights. The 2015 All-MEC first teamer finished second in the conference in goals against average (0.81), save percentage (.803), and ranked fifth in total saves (61).\n\nJones was the main catalyst in UU’s resurgence this season, leading the Blue Knights to their first-ever national ranking and a program record nine-straight wins. He posted seven shutouts, including a 1-0 win over nationally-ranked Millersville in UU’s first NCAA Tournament contest in any sport.\n\nBen Fitzpatrick was named to the 2015 National Soccer Coaches Association of America (NSCAA) All-Atlantic Region Team, recently announced by the organization.\n\nFitzpatrick, a native of Hilliard, Ohio and co-captain of the Blue Knight men’s soccer team, picked up first-team honors and has been recognized as an all-region performer by the NSCAA for the third straight year. The junior midfielder garnered All-MEC First Team accolades, while posting four goals and four assists this fall.\n\nAs one of UU’s top scoring threats, Fitzpatrick most notably scored the game-winning goal during the first-ever NCAA Tournament game in school history, which ended up as a 1-0 victory over No. 21 Millersville.\n\nPhotos courtesy of Urbana University Men’s Soccer\n\nNo. 1 Soccer Camps will be at Urbana University June 26th to 30th in 2016.

Given annually, the award recognizes teams that exhibit fair play, sporting behavior and adherence to the laws of the game. This is reflected by the number of yellow caution cards or red ejection cards they are shown by referees throughout the season based on the number of cards accumulated divided by the number of games played.\n\nAlbertus Associate Head Coach John Adams is also an Associate Director for No. 1 Soccer Camps West Conn. Albertus players Danielle Polvan, Maria Case and Lexi Mack have all been a part of the No.1 family as Staff Coaches at our West Conn and Salisbury, MDlocations for the past two years. In addition, Angelina Piccirillo and Bridget Judd are Staff Coaches at No. 1’s Brewster Academy and West Connsites.\n\n“I’m pretty impressed with it.” Judd said. “I like the fact that the program has been recognized for the last 4 years for sportsmanship while we’re still playing good, physical games. We’re not a team to just roll over and take the punches but we’re playing a fair game and putting up a good fight with opponents.”\n\nAlbertus Magnus College is located in New Haven, CT and will host a No. 1 College ID Camp this summer in June.\n\nFor more information on any of the 2016 No. 1 Soccer Camps programs or locations, please visit our website at www.no1soccercamps.com.\n\nNo.1 Celebrates 40th Year\n\nNO.1 SOCCER CAMPS: LONGEST CONSECUTIVELY RUNNING SOCCER CAMP IN THE US\n\nNo. 1 Soccer Camps is proud to announce its 40th year as a leader in the soccer camp industry. In an era when soccer camps come and go, No. 1 Soccer Camps has provided four decades of professional soccer training for generations of American and International players.

Many of the country’s and the world top players and coaches have become part of the camp’s legacy. Always striving to be No.1, the search for excellence continues today. It’s a true testament to Dr. Joe that many of his current staff have been part of this experience for well over 20 years, and a few from the beginning. It’s amazing to think how many players and coaches have benefitted from the lessons and teachings of Dr. Joe. He is a true icon in the American soccer culture and his contributions are immeasurable.”\n\nDr. Joe Machnik on the milestone season: “As we celebrate our 40th camp season in 2016, we look back at the long history of outstanding staff, professional players and international stars, and we think about the nearly 100,000 participants, campers and staff and those that have excelled at the highest levels of our sport. But most of all, we remember the sheer joy on campers faces, the huge smiles when learning takes place and the level of satisfaction achieved in so many ways.

If for some reason you do not receive this information within two weeks of the start of camp, please contact your regional director directly. Their phone numbers and email addresses are listed on our website and individual site pages. Please also note that the contact number on our website (571-428-8387) is for our national office in Virginia and can be used if you are unable to reach your RD directly. Please feel free to contact us with any questions.\n\nYouth Academy Camps\n\nYour Regional Director will provide you with detailed information concerning the specifics regarding the Youth Academy Camp schedule, check in, location and other important information.\n\nResidential Camps\n\nYour Regional Director will provide you with the time and location for the first day of camp check in prior to the start of camp.\n\nMedical and Camper Profile Forms\n\nThe Medical Form must be completed by a parent and your physician. Physical exams conducted for the 2016/17 school year may be attached to our Medical Form provided all necessary information is provided. It is imperative that you remember to bring your medical form to camp. Please note that you cannot participate at camp without a completed Medical Form.\n\nThe Camper Profile Form must be completed by the player and/or a parent. The picture is important and will help us to get to know the campers quickly at camp. The camp directors and staff coaches will use the Camper Profile Form as an aid in placing the camper in the right group and in maximizing their camp experience. Please bring the Camper Profile Form along with your Medical Form to camp. For all camper forms, go to our website at www.no1soccercamps.com, click on FYI, Players, then click on Prepare For Camp or simply click the links above.\n\nRoommate Requests\n\nAll roommate requests will be honored to the best of our ability. Be sure to list your roommate choice during the registration process. If for whatever reason the roommate dynamics are not working out between campers, it is important that campers let our staff know. If a camper is uncomfortable telling someone, then they should have their parents call. Things are sometimes simple to fix.\n\nPacking List:\n\n• Soccer Ball\n\n• Soccer Socks\n\n• T-Shirts (NO tank tops)\n\n• Soccer Shoes – it is NOT a good idea to bring new shoes to camp.\n\n• Indoor Training Shoes (Sneakers)\n\n• Shin Guards\n\n• Warm Up\n\n• Bathing Suit\n\n• Equipment Bag\n\n• Water Bottle\n\n• Sun Screen and Bug Spray\n\n• Note Book and Pen\n\n* Personal Items\n\n• Sandals/Flip Flops\n\n• Towels\n\n• Pillow and Bed Sheets – for twin size bed – residents only\n\n• Blanket/Sleeping Bag – residents only\n\n• Toiletries\n\n• Goalkeeping gear including gloves\n\nCommuters – First Day of Camp\n\nCampers who are not staying overnight should arrive at the assigned time provided to them by the Regional Director. Dinner will be the first meal. The regional director will provide you with the time and location that your commuter should be dropped off and then picked up at the conclusion of the day. Lunch and dinner will be provided daily. We will have a location in the dorm where our commuters can relax between sessions and store their belongings.\n\nResidents – First Day of Camp\n\nRegistration is generally between 12:00 pm and 2:00 pm on opening day at a specified location. Your Regional Director will send you exact times and locations. Once on campus, signs will direct you to the exact location for registration. The first field session is scheduled for early afternoon. Dinner is the first meal of the day, followed by a second field session. The evening lecture concludes the day’s events followed by lights out.\n\nRoom Key Deposits\n\nMost residential campers are required to submit a key deposit at the time of check-in. Deposits can be made in the form of cash or checks and will be returned to campers on the last day of camp at check out when the room keys are returned to us. Please make checks payable to No. 1 Soccer Camps. It will save you time during check-in if you have a check ready.\n\nCreating Groups\n\nCampers will be initially placed into groups based on the program that they have enrolled during registration. During the sessions on the first day, campers will evaluated on their ability, throughout the week there will be continued evaluation as the program progresses.\n\nPlease know that the staff is very aware that friends come together and want to stay together in the same group. Groups and teams that signed up together will work together. As other groups are established, the staff may not know exactly which campers are friends and want to train together.\n\nCampers will be asked several times – “Is there anyone who has been separated from their friends – does anyone want to move for any reason?” This is an important question, and we take it seriously. Groups can be adjusted – friends can and should play together – this is part of the whole camp experience. If a camper does not feel right in his group for whatever reason, please let us know. PLEASE tell your camper to speak up – we want to hear what they have to say. Sometimes they need to call home and have their parents contact us for them…that’s okay too.\n\nLast Day of Camp\n\nCamp will conclude after the morning field session on the last date of camp. Specific times will be provided by your regional director. At that time, campers will receive their personal detailed evaluation forms from our coaches. Lunch will not be served. Campers can be met on the field or at their dormitory. There is no formal closing meeting with parents. Parents wishing to do so may meet with the Directors, Staff Coaches, and Trainers on the field at the end of the last session. All campers must be promptly picked up at the conclusion of camp. We will have them as ready as possible for you. Due to our national sites, many of our staff are moving onto another site and will also need to depart camp promptly.\n\nIf you have any additional questions, please feel free to contact your Regional Director directly.

It may sound too good to be true, but it’s not. Under current guidelines, parents can earn a federal tax credit for sending their children to summer camp. Imagine, your child receives a quality camp experience, and you put some of that hard earned money back in your pocket come tax time. All you have to do is gather information now from your No. 1 Soccer Camps Regional Director to use on this year’s tax forms. The article below by David Slade details the Federal Child and Dependent Care Credit and the steps you need to take to take advantage of this credit.\n\nSENDING A CHILD TO DAY CAMP SO THAT YOU CAN WORK? COLLECT INFORMATION NOW FOR TAX SAVINGS LATER.\n\nBy David Slade, Columnist for The Post and Courier\n\nIf you’re the parent of a child under the age of 13, and you’re working or looking for work, then perhaps you’re sending that child to day camp or paying someone to care for them while you work this summer.\n\nIf so, you’re likely eligible for a federal tax credit that will put some of that child-care money back in your pocket, even if you have a high income.\n\nI’ll explain the rules, but here’s a quick tip: If you are sending a child to a summer day camp, make sure to ask for the camp’s tax identification number, and the name and address associated with that number. If you are paying someone to care for your child while you work, such as a babysitter, you’ll want their address and Social Security number.\n\nYou’ll be asked to provide that information in order to claim the credit on your federal income tax form, and when you’re filling out tax forms in 2016, it may be difficult to figure out who to call. Some summer camp programs last only a few weeks and are held at temporary locations. In my experience, they can be difficult to track down in the off-season.\n\nHere are some key points about the federal Child and Dependent Care Credit:\n\nA tax credit is a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the tax you owe, and is therefore much more valuable than a tax deduction, which reduces taxable income. This credit is worth between 20 percent and 35 percent of the amount paid to care for a dependent, who was under age 13 at the time the costs were incurred, so that you could work or look for work.\n\nYou can claim the credit for up to $3,000 in expenses for one child, or $6,000 in expenses for more than one. So, for example, $3,000 in qualifying child-care expenses results in a tax credit worth between $600 and $1,050. Qualifying expenses cannot be greater than the income earned by the tax filer, and in the case of a married couple the amount would be capped by the lowest-earning spouse’s income.\n\nDay-camp expenses count as child care, even if they focus on particular activities such as learning computer skills or cooking, as long as the child’s enrollment in that camp allows the parent to work or look for work. Overnight camps, however, are ineligible expenses.\n\nThe cost of a preschool program or an after-school program is an eligible expense. Summer school costs, private school tuition for kindergarten and higher grades, and tutoring costs are not eligible.\n\nDependent care benefits provided by an employer may reduce the amount of expenses that can be claimed.\n\nMarried couples (unless legally separated) must file a joint tax return in order to claim the credit, and both must be working or looking for work during the time the qualifying expenses were incurred. One spouse can, however, be a full-time student, but he or she also must have earned income during the year.\n\nThe dependent care credit also applies to work-related expenses necessary to care for a spouse or dependent who is “physically or mentally incapable of self-care and lived with you for more than half the year,” according to the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nSome costs are eligible, or not, depending upon the options offered by the care provider. For example, someone working part-time may only need child care three days a week, but the care provider offers only a five-day program. In that case, the cost of all five days is eligible, but if there were an option to only pay for the three days needed, only the cost of three days would be eligible.\n\nLike many federal tax rules, there are lots of rules that might apply to people with nuanced child-care situations. One example used by the IRS is a family that hires a housekeeper to care for two children, one of which is young enough to qualify for the tax credit, while also providing other household duties and driving the parent to work (the answer is, the cost of the housekeeper qualifies). To see all the rules, visit irs.gov and find Publication 503.\n\nArticle originally appeared in the Post and Courier\n\nNo. 1 Soccer Camps, the first national camp of it’s kind, was founded by Dr. Joseph Machnik in 1977. Since then, over 80,000 soccer players and coaches have attended No. 1 Soccer Camps. The former World Cup and professional soccer coach is credited for creating the “Machnik Method”, a distinctive soccer training method that is universally recognized and used today.

Mike Woitalla from Soccer America takes a closer look how unexpected set plays, a multidimensional back line, and coach who trusts her players can make all the difference.\n\nLessons from Jillellis and The U.S women\n\nby Mike Woitalla, Soccer America\n\nIt’s wonderful that millions of aspiring players and coaches watched the Women’s World Cup final. Not because the USA won, but because how it won. Many aspects of the victory serve as excellent examples of how to play successful and entertaining soccer.\n\nPlay Low, Win High.\n\nWhen Megan Rapinoe lined up to take a third-minute corner kick, everyone expected a high ball into the area. Instead, she drove a low ball that Carli Lloyd met eight yards out and shot into the net with the outside of her foot.\n\nNot that low corner kicks will work all the time, but, besides demonstrating the value of executing the unexpected, the opening goal showed something crucial that’s often ignored by players and coaches — that well-aimed balls on the ground are harder to defend than crosses “whipped into the mixer.”\n\nLloyd’s second goal, just two minutes later, came from Lauren Holiday’s free kick on the flank. Again, it was a low-driven ball that the Japanese couldn’t handle.\n\nThe USA did get success in the air, such as Lloyd’s headed gamewinner in the quarterfinal victory over China, but high balls were a very small part of the U.S. game. The majority of its offensive success came from combination play on the ground — a wonderful example being the second goal of the semifinal win over Germany.\n\nSavvy is Better than Brawn\n\nThat the U.S. four-player backline combined for just three fouls in final against Japan – and only 14 fouls total in the tournament’s seven games – reveals what kind of defenders Coach Jill Ellis fielded in Ali Krieger, Julie Johnston, Becky Sauerbrunn and Meghan Klingenberg. They used smarts, good positioning and good timing to stifle opponents.\n\nJohnston may have been lucky to escape with a yellow card when she took down Germany’s Alexandra Popp in the semifinal, but that was one of only two fouls Johnston committed in 630 minutes of soccer.\n\nAll four players were more than comfortable with the ball at their feet, able to maintain possession after they won it, by being able to elude the first opponent who challenged them and hitting accurate passes of various ranges.\n\nThe outside backs surged forward with confidence and the central defenders didn’t just “clear” balls out, but aimed for teammates.\n\nA major part of the USA’s success at World Cup came thanks to the backline — not just for its defending, but it because it was comprised of multidimensional players who also helped the offense improve from game to game.\n\nTrust Your Players\n\nJust imagine the pressure there was on U.S. coach Jill Ellis. The USA hadn’t won a World Cup since 1999 and anything other than first place in Canada would be considered a debacle.\n\nBut you would never have thought that Ellis was anything but confident in herself and her players when you saw her sitting on the bench during the final — or anytime during the tournament, even when the USA struggled to find its groove.\n\nOnce in a while, she would get up and convey an instruction — before returning to the bench. She wasn’t pacing, prowling and yelling from the sideline, but watching in way that made one feel she believed in her players.\n\nI imagine when players see such positive body language from their coach it helps them keep the confidence that will get them through the high-pressure periods.\n\nCoaches who behave with such dignity as Ellis does on the sideline — instead of bouncing around, gesticulating and screaming — look like coaches who know they’ve done well to prepare their teams and can trust their players at game time.\n\nOriginal Article\n\nNo. 1 Soccer Camps, the first national camp of it’s kind, was founded by Dr. Joseph Machnik in 1977.

How can No. 1 help both of them, specifically at their individual positions?\n\nNo 1. Founder and President Dr. Joe Machnik: Both of your sons will benefit from the unique and modern methodology of our “Go to Goal Curriculum” which concentrates on play in the final third of the field – 35 yards from goal – on either side of the ball. Field players and goalkeepers are trained and tested at the highest level.\n\nFor your son who is a defender, he will learn to attack and defend the various tactical situations which challenge the complete player in today’s all inclusive modern game. Attackers, midfielders and defenders learn the art of goal scoring with over a thousand “Go to Goal” opportunities in a typical camp week.\n\nFor your son who is a goalkeeper, our nationally recognized Goalkeeper staff will teach him the technical skills needed to be successful and tactically savvy. At a No. 1 camp, he will be playing in the goal in game like situations under the guidance of a goalkeeper coach who will be coaching the player from in the goal, not from the sideline. Each camp lesson will finish with game-like situations combining the strikers and goalkeepers. Using small sided games in front of full size goals, the strikers and goalkeeper are involved in critical decision making situations designed to improve their execution in this all important part of the field.\n\nIn addition to our proven “Go to Goal” philosophy, what really sets No.1 Soccer Camps apart from other camps is our staff. Our camp staff is a virtual who’s who of American players and coaches. Our Alumni include MLS Coaches, 5 current MLS goalkeepers, and a current member of the US Men’s National Team. We are also proud of our impressive list of former No.1 Soccer Campers who represent our male and female youth National teams at every level, including four current staff coaches, and a three year camper who played in this year’s NCAA Final Four. All of our coaches are carefully screened and selected to ensure our campers are getting the highest caliber coaches in the soccer world.\n\nWith a 40 year camp history and over 80,000 players trained, No. 1 has a long tradition in the soccer community. Each summer we have former campers returning to bring their children to camp and campers who have gone onto play at the collegiate and professional level are returning to coach. Shown to the left is the McLaughlin family. Dad Ryan, a No. 1 veteran, brought his son Connor and daughter Callie to the No. 1 Soccer Camps in Salisbury Maryland recently.

America’s pioneers recall an Italian adventure\n\nSteve Trittschuh recognized the figure slowly approaching the American locker room beneath Rome’s Stadio Olimpico. This was June of 1990, the middle of the World Cup, and everyone knew the silhouette of Italy’s best player, Roberto Baggio, with bushy curls piled on his head. But why was Baggio here? Why was he outside the locker room of the team Italy had just beaten 1-0? And why was he clutching what appeared to be … his game shorts?\n\n“Hey,” Baggio said to Trittschuh, changing just inside the door.\n\n“Hey,” Trittschuh replied.\n\nAn awkward silence filled the space between them until Trittschuh realized what was happening. Baggio, perhaps the greatest player of his time, was asking a 25-year-old defender from Granite City, Illinois, to trade pants.\n\n“I had Baggio’s shorts forever, man,” Trittschuh said one recent morning as he prepared to coach his Colorado Springs Switchbacks of the United Soccer League. “It was the coolest thing.”\n\nLong before Major League Soccer, regular World Cups for America and Saturday games on network TV, there was a team that launched modern soccer in the United States. It was a group of unknowns, many of them fresh from college, who had been handed an impossible task: become the first American team in 40 years to go to the World Cup.\n\nFor nine months in 1989, the US players battled to seize one of the two Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football (Concacaf), spots in the 1990 World Cup. Eventually, they did, with a miracle goal scored on a tiny island off the coast of Venezuela. Then 25 years ago this week they stepped on an Italian field and launched a movement.\n\nThis is the story of America’s soccer pioneers who walked into a world they never could have imagined.\n\n1. From the Stone Age\n\nBob Gansler (Head coach of the US men’s soccer team 1989-91): We didn’t think about the difficulties of the venture. That’s just where soccer was at the time. There was no professional soccer at the time.\n\nJohn Polis (Director of communications, US Soccer Federation 1988-93): Soccer in the United States was the Stone Age compared to now.\n\nGansler: We tried to put together a squad of talented people who could do things together, and could go through adversity as well as perform. There was no way outside of Concacaf where we would be the favorite. We wanted guys with gonads who could handle the situation.\n\nPaul Krumpe (midfielder): Even with guys who had professional experience, our experience was so minuscule. It was imposing for us against everyone we went up against.\n\nBruce Murray (forward): There were a lot of indoor league guys like Ricky Davis, and the sports writers were saying these need to be the players in the World Cup, these are professional players, grizzled players, but Bob Gansler is like: “They haven’t played outdoors and [don’t have] the fitness levels.” He stuck with the college guys. A lot of people criticized him for it.\n\nPolis: In 1988, Fifa had announced the 1994 World Cup was coming to the United States.\n\nMurray: Can you imagine what an embarrassment it would be to not have qualified for the previous World Cup and be awarded the World Cup? There was even some talk about taking the World Cup away.\n\nGansler: I said: “Let’s get together a team not just for 1990 but for the 1990s.”\n\nMurray: We were the guinea pigs.\n\nSteve Trittschuh (defender): There was a group of us – like 13-14 guys – and we started together at the end of 1986 and beginning of 1987. It was a good group. We all had to learn the game. Gansler taught us.\n\nPolis: The task was enormous. There was this big, huge mental block hanging over this team.\n\nGansler: We played catch-up but we were running fast.\n\nPolis: Gansler was a terrific guy who was in a tough situation. It was a little bit like Herb Brooks with the US hockey team. He wasn’t blustery. He had a businesslike manner. He was coaching a bunch of kids trying to get to the World Series. That’s what it was like – taking a bunch of 22-year-olds to the World Series.\n\nPeter Vermes (forward): I always admired the job he did at that time. It was like the movie Miracle. He had to take college players and turn them into men playing at the highest level in a short time.\n\nJohn Harkes (midfielder): I think Bob Gansler had a keen eye to not just observe the ability of the players but to see the desire of the team you are putting together. It’s hard.\n\nMike Windischmann (defender and captain): I remember one time we were in East Germany, and we were training a lot. So some of the guys said: “Hey, Mike go talk to Bob and ask him if he could cut down the practices a little bit.” So I got to Bob Gansler’s room, and I say: “Some of the guys are a little concerned, you know, with training.” And he was like: “Oh, all right.” Basically, it was like: “Tell them to go to hell. We’re still practicing.” I go back and everybody’s huddled up. “What did he say?” He said: “Go to hell. We got practice next morning.”\n\nJoe Machnik (assistant coach US men’s team 1989-90): I would say Bob was authoritative. He was a serious-minded coach who believed the players had to behave a certain way off the field.\n\nMurray: We had a lot less … professionalism. I guess that would be the word. But we got it done.\n\nVermes: It was amazing if you look at the resources [Gansler] had to achieve what he needed to. Back in those days we had a $5 per diem.\n\nGansler: When we qualified for the World Cup, our federation president, Werner Fricker, put up his Philadelphia construction company as collateral to have a loan that got us some more money.\n\nKrumpe: The big benefit to us [in qualifying] was Mexico using ineligible players [in 1988 Olympic qualifying] and not being part of the Concacaf. There was a huge opening without Mexico. Everyone felt the same way. It was the time to qualify.\n\nGansler: I was glad we were getting covered by more journalists, but they had never covered soccer before. They didn’t know much about soccer or Concacaf. They pulled out the atlas and said: “You’re playing against Guatemala or you’re playing against El Salvador, and should be able to beat them anyway.”\n\nJohn Stollmeyer (midfielder): I was always surprised that it was close for us in getting through qualifying. The older I get, I realize it’s difficult. It got to the end of those last several games and it was a battle.\n\nGansler: I knew it was going to be a long road. Early on, after a game against Costa Rica, I said: “More than likely it’s going to come down to the last game of qualifying [against Trinidad & Tobago].”\n\nMurray: It wouldn’t have come down to Trinidad if we had won the El Salvador match right before that. We blew it.\n\nTrittschuh: That was tough. El Salvador was not in [the running for the World Cup] at the time and they sent a really young team and we just couldn’t score (a 0-0 tie). The way things happened is a great story but we could have made it a lot easier on ourselves.\n\n2. The shot heard round the world\n\nCosta Rica had already grabbed one Concacaf qualifying spot. The US and Trinidad & Tobago were tied for the second with nine points. Since Trinidad had a two-goal differential over the Americans, the US could not make the World Cup with a tie. It needed to win or face the shame of hosting a World Cup in four years without having been to one in more than four decades. The match, scheduled for the afternoon of 19 November 1989, in Trinidad’s national stadium, became the biggest American soccer history to that point.\n\nGansler: The federation got us a camp in Cocoa Beach, Florida, for 10 days, and they even flew in Bermuda to play us to prepare, because they played the same way as Trinidad – an athletic team who was quick.\n\nMachnik: We struggled against Bermuda, so the media around us was very skeptical. They were writing that we can’t win.\n\nPolis: There was angst among the press at the time around the team. Could [the US] do this on the road? There were people in the press corps who thought we were going to get thumped.\n\nTrittschuh: I knew we could play against Trinidad. but in the back of our minds we wondered what was going to happen to US soccer if we didn’t win – and then what was going to happen to us?\n\nGansler: I remember at the airport, as you walked off the plane, you walked into a sea of red. All of Port of Spain was wearing red that day.\n\nPolis: There were 10,000-15,000 people screaming: “No way, USA! No way, USA!” People were banging on the side of the bus.\n\nVermes: There were even people on the roof of the airport. It was crazy.\n\nTrittschuh: It was 10 o’clock at night. As we were driving down the highway there was a lot of people lining the road all the way to the hotel.\n\nMurray: They had declared a national holiday the day after the game to celebrate going to the World Cup.\n\nKrumpe: They were so convinced they were qualifying for the World Cup, they got all their artists to record World Cup songs, and were playing them on the radio.\n\nPolis: On the morning of the match, a lot of us in the delegation were invited to breakfast at the ambassador’s residence. It was a beautiful house that looked down on the stadium and at the water. The stadium was already filled at 11am.\n\nMurray: The bus ride into the stadium was at 2mph, and everywhere you looked it was red. I’ve played before bigger crowds, but it was a very intimidating atmosphere. Everybody was dressed in red.\n\nVermes: You could feel the tension of the occasion. It was us against the world.\n\nMurray: There was a park next to the stadium with a Jumbotron, and there were 100,000 people watching the game, and the stadium holds 35,000, but there were people climbing up the walls.\n\nStollmeyer: There was only a rail around the field and people were actually sitting on the track.\n\nMurray: I don’t think there was a lot of belief in that locker room. You could ask any player. You were young, you weren’t sure you were getting another contract [with the national team]. You had to win to survive. I was getting married a week later, and I was like: how am I going to take care of kids?\n\nGansler: I told them before the match: “[Trinidad] will take chances, that’s the opportunity we can have. That opportunity is going to be there.”\n\nVermes: I remember walking out of the tunnel before the game. You could see the terror in the [Trinidad players’] eyes, because of all the pressure to go to the World Cup that had been placed on them.\n\nPlay by play: Ramos…putting it in…to Caligiuri…beats the first man, a left-footed shot…Paul Caligiuri has scored a goal and the US leads 1-0!\n\nGansler: Paul just let it fly.\n\nWindischmann: He just flicked it over and just hit it. It was surreal, like in slow motion, the ball continuing and just dropping in.\n\nMachnik: The moment Caligiuri hit it, I jumped up and yelled: “Trouble!” The sun was in the goalkeeper’s eyes.\n\nGansler: The goalkeeper did not have an NBA vertical. It had a chance.\n\nMachnik: The ball was in the perfect spot. I think it hit the ground before it hit the net.\n\nVermes: We were all amazed when the ball went in. It was almost as if: “Holy cow! We got this thing now.”\n\nMurray: When Paul scored his goal, we realized: “You know, we can win this game. We probably can score another one.” There was no belief until Paul scored and then there was belief.\n\nStollmeyer: During the rest of the game you were wondering: “How much more time were they keeping on the clock to give them a chance?” I kept thinking: “When are they going to blow the whistle?”\n\nWindischmann: Some people just fell down afterward. There was shock when that whistle blew, because we were waiting and waiting for that whistle to blow. It was just a relief when that whistle blew and it was: oh my goodness, we are going to the World Cup! It was unbelievable.\n\nPolis: The celebration in our locker room was tremendous relief. Bob Gansler was in the corner nursing a beer. He said: “Just another game.”\n\nTrittschuh: It was a relief. By the time everybody got back to the hotel, everybody was exhausted. We didn’t even have a party that night. Everyone just sat by the pool.\n\nMurray: For us, [losing] would have been a disaster. All this that you see now [in US soccer] is because of what Paul Caligiuri did in Trinidad & Tobago. It’s as simple as that, if you want to pin it to one specific moment. For example, Nike jumped in with hundreds of millions of dollars to build all these academies, and that never would have happened if Paul hadn’t scored that goal. They should put Paul on a lifetime stipend. Seriously.\n\n3. Three stripes or you’re out\n\nKrumpe: The US Soccer Federation had not been through this since 1950. Nobody knew what you were supposed to do. Do you give bonuses? Do you fly everyone to a training? Everything was new to them.\n\nTrittschuh: After we qualified, we had to sign another contract, because it was the start of another year.\n\nStollmeyer: They flew us to New York.\n\nTrittschuh: In New York, we all got into a room and they all presented what [the contract] was going to be.\n\nKrumpe: Then they brought us into a room one-by-one.\n\nStollmeyer: They gave us the contracts and we either signed them or we left. There wasn’t any negotiation. They said: “This is it.”\n\nKrumpe: It was minimal. It was less than $50,000 a year.\n\nTrittschuh: I want to say it was between $40,000 and $50,000.\n\nWindischmann: It was $40,000, I definitely remember.\n\nStollmeyer: It floored a lot of us, in terms of: oh my God, look at what we did, and they aren’t going to take care of us?\n\nKrumpe: I have an aerospace engineering degree, and I had a great job with McDonnell Douglas designing the MD-90. It was an unbelievable job. They couldn’t believe I was walking away from it to play soccer.\n\nMurray: I had just bought a house in Bethesda [Maryland] right by Suburban Hospital on Garfield Street.\n\nStollmeyer: I got married in February of 89. My wife was still in med school and I had car payments.\n\nTrittschuh: A few of the guys thought they were being a little bit bulldozed by the federation.\n\nStollmeyer: The problem with the whole thing was that we couldn’t have individual shoe contracts because the federation had a deal with Adidas. There was no means to make more money.\n\nPolis: The federation was short on funds at the time. I don’t think they were getting much of anything. They got a deal with Adidas and I don’t think they got much more than product.\n\nWindischmann: We were approached about signing Puma contracts.\n\nKrumpe: There were 10 of us under contract to Puma at the time, and we had to give that up to go to the World Cup.\n\nWindischmann: Puma gave us, I think, $10,000. They gave us boots and gave us equipment. At the time Adidas wasn’t giving us stuff like that, so it’s kind of hard to say: ‘No”.\n\nPolis: There was one guy at Puma who was pouring gasoline on the flames. I remember one day when a bunch of them walked out to practices with Puma gear on, and Gansler said: “Go change.”\n\nWindischmann: I think it was in San Diego, and we put the Puma boots on only to have people tell you: “You can’t wear those.”\n\nStollmeyer: Here we were, at the best time of our lives, and we were fighting over how much we were getting paid.\n\nTrittschuh: We all stuck together as a group for a while until everybody finally went their own way. I wanted to play in the World Cup. What else were we going to do?\n\nPolis: It’s got to be hard when at age 20 you’re getting told: “You’re getting screwed by the federation.”\n\nStollmeyer: Two guys I remember held out. They showed up to camp without contracts.\n\nGansler: I finally said to them: “This isn’t the German federation or the Brazil federation or Argentina. This is us.”\n\nTrittschuh: We all stuck together as a group for a while, until everybody finally went their own way. I wanted to play in the World Cup. What else were we going to do?\n\nKrumpe: As a 32-year-old without an outdoor pro league to play in, there was no chance but to say yes to the contract. There were sacrifices to be made, including wearing Adidas shoes.\n\n4. ‘It was like a prison’\n\nThe US was faced with a daunting task in its first World Cup in 40 years. At the draw, actress Sophia Loren picked the ball that placed the Americans in a loaded Group A with rugged, experienced, Czechoslovakia; the host Italy – one of the world’s finest teams – and Austria, then a rising soccer force in Europe. The Czechoslovakia and Austria matches were to be played in Florence. The US would face Italy in Rome.\n\nGansler: To go to downtown Rome and try and prepare with all the spotlights and media and all that … I thought it wouldn’t serve us. I thought it would be better for a group of young guys that, rather than spending extended time with the media, we should be somewhere secluded.\n\nMachnik: There are several theories on whether a team should be sequestered or at a downtown hotel. It had been 40 years since the USA had been to a World Cup, so no one had an idea what we should do. But Bob told the federation that we should be sequestered.\n\nGansler: We were booked to go to Coverciano, the [soccer] training center of Italy, which is located just outside Florence. That’s what the agreement was. If you look up the official Italian training center you’ll see how nice it is.\n\nMachnik: We were going to share it with [the Italian team]. Then we got put in the same group as them and they didn’t want us training with them anymore.\n\nGansler: They said: “We have an Olympic training center a little farther away in Terrenia. It’s comparable.” We didn’t have any money to go out there ahead of time and find out it wasn’t comparable.”\n\nHarkes: It looked like barbed wire [on the top of the gate]. Where are we going?\n\nPolis: It was a dormitory-like training facility. It wasn’t in town, it was out in the country a little bit. There were a lot of Italian carabinieri law enforcement guys. We had guards stationed all around the compound. They were well-armed.\n\nVermes: It was like a prison. Anytime you wanted to go out a guard went with you.\n\nMurray: It was almost like a compound.\n\nHarkes: We pull in, and there’s a track around the field, and that was it. There were these little complexes on the site and that’s where we were staying.\n\nTrittschuh: It was a little bit of a letdown. It didn’t feel like we were at the World Cup. It was a prison camp.\n\nMachnik: Lets just say it was Sparta compared to Athens.\n\nStollmeyer: The problem was: we were watching on TV all these big teams coming out of these posh hotels. Why aren’t we living like that?\n\nGansler: They assured us it was comparable [to Coverciano]. Where we thought we had a four-star complex – we went there and found that. I felt bad and wanted better. I could have stood there and pitched a fit, but those were the cards we were dealt.\n\nMachnik: After the World Cup they brought all the World Cup coaches back to Coverciano for a seminar with the coaches from Serie A. It’s a nice place, you can imagine, the Italian team stayed there during World Cup. Our players would have loved it.\n\nGansler: I didn’t go out there before, our coaches didn’t go out there before. We couldn’t afford the plane trip to check it out, and we couldn’t afford the time away from the team. Maybe our shortcoming was that we were too trusting when the Italians told us it was comparable\n\nTrittschuh: We trained twice a day. When we started they had a cafeteria and the food wasn’t good, so eventually they found us an Italian restaurant outside, just so we had one good meal a day.\n\nMurray: We were away from our families, had very little time with our families, and I think that was a big mistake. Now they have players stay at the Westin or whatever. The team will take over the whole hotel in the World Cup. They don’t seclude them completely from their family. My family, we had 50 people over there – it was like a big celebration, but I could never get to see them.\n\nKrumpe: There was a sponsor who paid for anyone who was married and their spouse and family to travel to Italy. That was a nice touch.\n\nPolis: When we were there the US was thought of as neophytes, and how did we get there? They said if we got there then Concacaf must be so weak. That was the overriding view.\n\nGansler: Czechoslovakia had a lot of internal crisis going into that World Cup. They were in turmoil. I thought watching their films through qualifying that this was the one game to get a result. Maybe I’m conservative in these matters but a result would be a tie.\n\nMachnik: We thought our best chance was against Czechoslovakia. Only later on, when I was at the coaching seminar in Italy and I talked to their coach, did I find out how bad their internal issues were.\n\nStollmeyer: I remember our coaches telling us the Czech game was the one where we had a chance to get a result. I thought: “Really? I don’t remember playing an eastern bloc team that wasn’t hard and couldn’t run our asses off.”\n\nMurray: That first game we weren’t really prepared, I don’t think. I remember Joe Machnik telling us that physically we would be imposing, and we were lining up in the tunnel to come out, and I’m right next to Tomas Skuhravy, and he’s, like, 6ft 5in, and the two center-backs are 6ft 4in, and I’m thinking: “What the hell?”\n\nGansler: We had opening-game jitters. We gave up a goal just before half – it would have been easier to go into half down just 1-0. To be down 2-0 was much worse. We were a young team and we self-destructed. Eric Wynalda got tossed out of the game.\n\nMurray: We just got smashed.\n\nWindischmann: We got beat in the air. But you have to remember both of those teams went to at least the quarter-finals – Czechoslovakia and Italy – so we weren’t playing against just teams that so happened to qualify. So we had a tall order.\n\nHarkes: There were a lot of deep thoughts among the players, among ourselves: “Are we really up for this thing?”\n\nMurray: So now you can imagine going into the second game against Italy in Rome … The Italian paper La Gazzetta dello Sport was like: “Can the Italians score 12? “You have to remember the Italians were the best team in the world cup according to 90% of the people over there. Their line-up was ridiculous.\n\nPolis: This German journalist asked: “Mr Gansler, what would be an acceptable number of goals to lose by? Five goals? Six goals?”\n\nStollmeyer: After the Czech game, team morale was not great. Practices were brutal. Changes were coming on the field. There were guys coming out to practice in screw-ins and it was really hard play.\n\nTrittschuh: There was a lot of frustration. There were guys who weren’t starting and thought they should have been starting. We had three straight weeks in that place and guys were getting sick of each other.\n\nStollmeyer: We had to say: “Hey, we’re teammates here.”\n\nWindischmann: I think maybe it’s that mental aspect that gets to you when you are doing that same thing over and over again. We hardly had any television, [ate] regimented meals. Then we started going back to our rooms getting on each other’s case because you’re there so long.\n\nVermes: We had a big fight. It was Murray and [Eric] Eichmann. It was a melee, everybody was basically in the goal throwing punches.\n\nMurray: I felt that Eric had targeted me in training, and if he made me look bad it would help his cause to get into the next game. So a couple of late hits, and that was it, and the gloves were off. I have no problem today with Eric, but it does show the competitive atmosphere within the group.\n\nVermes: It was letting steam off.\n\nHarkes: I would have to think Gansler would look at that and think: “This is good.”\n\n5. Respect, finally\n\nMurray: On the way to Rome we had helicopters flying beside the bus, literally down low, like five feet off the ground, and another sweeping across the road, like, maybe five feet off the ground. There was some threat, apparently, from some terror group that they were going to do something, so that was a concern.\n\nStollmeyer: There were one or two (police) cars ahead of us, and two or three in back of us and one on the side, and a helicopter above us. The bus never stopped. We would come up to a toll plaza and it would be cleared and the bus would never stop going through the tollbooth.\n\nMachnik: In Rome, the bus would come to a major intersection. The bus would stop and the (police) would get out of the car with their guns and look around and then wave us on.\n\nStollmeyer: They all had Uzis hanging out of the cars.\n\nGansler: When we drove over to Rome, there were people on the side of the road. They figured out it was our bus and they’d come to stand by the road and hold up 10 fingers. They weren’t giving an Italian greeting. It was them saying: “We are going to beat you by 10.”\n\nPolis: People were coming out of their houses holding up 10 fingers.\n\nMachnik: They were just standing there holding up 10 fingers!\n\nGansler: On the day of the match, I remember Joe Machnik coming to me saying: [the players] want to have a meeting. I said: “Why not?” Those are meetings where leaders stand up and they are accountable.\n\nStollmeyer: It was in a ballroom of the hotel in Rome. It had a stage up front and 30 or 40 theatre seats. The captains sat up on the stage, everyone else was in the seats.\n\nVermes: I remember a lot of guys talked.\n\nStollmeyer: Guys were complaining, and I had just had it with the bullshit. I basically called anybody out who was whining and moping. I said: “We are here for us, and let’s just go out there and play.” Brian Bliss later told me: “You set the record for F-bombs in two minutes.” John Doyle said: “Nothing else needs to be said.”\n\nGansler: So those guys did have gonads after all!\n\nVermes: We got to the stadium quite a few hours before the game. There were only, like, 500 people in the stadium and the stadium was so loud already.\n\nStollmeyer: The field was just like a putting green – it was spectacular. There was a fog smoke in there, flags were waving, people singing, you couldn’t hear a guy five yards away.\n\nMurray: When I walked out of the stadium tunnel (at the start) I was standing next to Paolo Maldini, the famous AC Milan player. I look over to my right and Franco Harris and Tom Landry were sitting in the front row. I went like: “What the hell is this?” You couldn’t miss them. Tom Landry with his fedora. Franco Harris with his beard. (Franco) kind of smiled at me – a very surreal scene.\n\nGansler: I thought if we could control the ball against Italy their Adam’s apples would be – should we say – upwards, because of the expectations that they would beat us by 10 goals. That’s exactly what happened.\n\nMurray: Bob Gansler said: “This is our gameplan: we are going to defend two blocks of four, and we’re going to hit them on the counter-attack, and you need to hold the ball more.” And we did. Everything came off exactly as planned.\n\nHarkes: We had a sequence where we had 23 consecutive passes without the Italian team touching the ball. In order to do that, on that stage, is pretty remarkable in itself.\n\nMachnik: We could have won that match too.\n\nMurray: The crowd started to turn on their team in the first half because we were just hoarding everything. I was winning my individual battle. And the whole idea was to get it up to me. I would hold it up so we could get some defensive players out. So it"
