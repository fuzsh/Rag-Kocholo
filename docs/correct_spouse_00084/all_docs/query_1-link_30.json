        "text": "There are, broadly speaking, three competing schools of thought when it comes to explaining one of Brazilian football’s most nagging conundrums.\n\nThe majority view is that Alexandre Pato was undone by injuries — that the gruelling series of muscle strains he sustained at AC Milan chip-chip-chipped away at the edifice of his talent before he had the chance to properly sculpt it. Not many footballers have an entire section of their Wikipedia page dedicated to their various spells on the sidelines. Pato does.\n\nSome will tell you he didn’t want it enough — that he lacked that flame that burns deep inside the chests of the true greats, lending that dash of urgency to everything they do. Those who know him paint a portrait of a well-rounded human being who is content with his place in the world. Perhaps, faced with a choice between hard-won immortality and the good life, he just chose the latter.\n\nOthers will insist he wasn’t all that in the first place — that he was a victim of the hype machine, swept along on a wave of expectation he could barely comprehend, let alone control. According to this view, the potential that made him a €24 million player before his 18th birthday never even threatened to crystallise. Even before he began his slow walk into irrelevance, Pato the idea was estranged from Pato the reality.\n\nThere are varying degrees of blame and sympathy attached to these positions, but all are shot through with melancholy, a strange nostalgia for what might have been. Pato is still only 30 years old. It is really not difficult to conjure an alternate timeline in which he has racked up hundreds of goals for a Champions League team and is gearing up for a fourth World Cup as Brazil’s No 9.\n\nInstead, he is toiling away for Sao Paulo, his best run of form in the last decade having come not in Europe but in the Chinese Super League. He dreams of a return to Milan, but that possibility looks well beyond him now. He last played for his country seven years ago.\n\nIt is a dizzying contrast. And so the question persists: What on earth happened?\n\nFor the senior players at Internacional, one training session was all it took.\n\nIt was November 2006. Inter, the South American champions, were preparing for the Club World Cup. Their president, Fernando Carvalho, wanted Pato — at that point only 17 but already on the radars of European clubs, including Arsenal — to travel to Japan with the squad, largely because he thought it would help increase his value. So he asked coach Abel Braga to give him a chance in a practice match between the reserves and the first team.\n\nPato scored. Then he scored again. Then once more, just to be sure.\n\nBraga and his players could hardly believe what they were seeing. “It was so impressive,” recalls Iarley, who played up front for Inter between 2005 and 2008. “We were all taken aback. His potential was frightening. I had to speak to the press after that session. Everyone wanted to know about him. I told them that, after Ronaldo, he was the most complete player I had ever seen.\n\n“He was strong, he was fast – zoom! – and he could shoot with both feet. He was intelligent. He could dribble. Normally, a kid of that age has one main strength. Pato was different. He could do everything.”\n\nRubens Cardoso, the team’s left-back, had a similar reaction. “We had all heard about Pato, but I was bowled over,” he says. “I thought, ‘Christ, this guy is a phenomenon’. Right from that first moment, I thought he would become the best player in the world. Easily.”\n\nPato scored with his third touch in senior football, a minute into his debut against Palmeiras. He found the net again in the Club World Cup semi-final against Al Ahly. His third game was the final, against Barcelona. He went home with Ronaldinho’s shirt and a winner’s medal.\n\nIt was a whirlwind, but so was Pato. Over the six months that followed, he was an irrepressible force, tormenting defenders with his pace and dynamism. “He brought youthful energy to the team,” says Cardoso. “We always wanted to get the ball to him, because we knew something good would happen. He wasn’t just a young promise who needed further development; he was ready for senior football.”\n\nHe also seemed ready for stardom. In early 2007, he made the front cover of Placar magazine, who called him “the new sensation of Brazilian football”. Before long, the whispers of interest from Europe became a roar. As Milan battled to the head of the queue, it became evident he would quickly outgrow Internacional.\n\nHis team-mates from the time insist Pato was not swayed by his newfound fame. “He was a super-obedient kid who listened a lot,” says Iarley. “He was always asking questions and never talked back.”\n\nCardoso agrees. “I think he knew how much potential he had,” he explains. “When you win the Club World Cup and start getting linked with big teams, you do get stars in your eyes. But he was focused and centred. He wasn’t the kind of guy who thought he was the bee’s knees. On the contrary: he had this purity, this desire to grow.”\n\nOne particularly memorable quote from the time goes against that grain, however. It was a warning, delivered to Pato by his own agent, about the pitfalls of becoming a household name before being old enough to vote.\n\n“I’m always talking with Alexandre, telling him not to think that he’s already made it,” Gilmar Veloz told Placar. “He’s talented, but things are happening too quickly.”\n\nInterlude 1: Fanfare\n\n“Pato is a good example of the society of the spectacle, which is always searching for celebrities. He is treated like a superstar before he has even played 30 games.” (Tostao, World Cup-winning Brazil striker, Folha de Sao Paulo, January 2008)\n\n“Pato believed everything that people said about him. After that, he never progressed.” (Tostao, Folha, October 2013)\n\nPato could not play for Milan until he turned 18 — they then had to wait three more months to register him — but that did not stop him making a positive impression. Carlo Ancelotti, with whom he would develop a strong bond, compared him to Careca. Club captain Paolo Maldini believed he would lead their line for years to come. “We have found our striker,” Maldini told his team-mates.\n\nWhen Leonardo, who was instrumental in the Pato transfer, accompanied Kaka to the Ballon d’Or gala in December 2007, he made a promise to reporters: He would be back the following year with his new prodigy in tow. It seemed a bold claim. But then Pato started playing.\n\nHe scored on his debut against Napoli (this is a bit of a running theme in his career), then twice against Genoa. By the end of the season, he had nine league goals to his name, despite only starting 13 matches.\n\nThe momentum continued into the following campaign: David Beckham and Ronaldinho arrived in the summer, but it was Pato who formed the most fruitful relationship with Kaka and Pippo Inzaghi in the Milan attack.\n\nHis finishing ability spoke for itself. Yet it was his ability to beat his man that really caught the eye of Andriy Shevchenko, who found Pato impossible to displace from the starting XI after returning on loan from Chelsea. “He had incredible pace,” Shevchenko tells The Athletic. “It was a natural gift. He was very explosive.”\n\nFor Brazil, too, he looked a lot like the future. He made his first senior appearance against Sweden at Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium in March 2008, scoring a stunning goal moments after coming off the bench. When Placar mocked up a cover to illustrate the fierce competition for the main striking berth at the 2010 World Cup finals, Pato was literally at the front of the queue, ahead of Ronaldo, Adriano and Luis Fabiano. Inside, a report card rating his various skills put him at the same level as an at-his-peak Romario. That seems woefully misguided in hindsight, but it neatly captures the extent to which Pato fever was sweeping the country.\n\nWith his boyish good looks and sparkling future, Pato was also prime tabloid fodder. He married actress Sthefany Brito in a glitzy ceremony at the Copacabana Palace; when they split up a few months later, the Brazilian newspapers claimed it was because Brito had grown tired of Pato partying with Ronaldinho. If anyone expected him to duck out of the limelight after that, they were to be disappointed: in 2011, he started a relationship with Barbara Berlusconi, the daughter of Italian prime minister — and AC Milan owner — Silvio.\n\nThat created distance between Pato and his team-mates. He also struggled to get on with Max Allegri, who was less paternal than predecessor Ancelotti. “Carlo talked to me,” Pato told Corriere dello Sport. “He told me what to do on the pitch. If I need to improve, (Allegri) should tell me how. A coach has to tell you how to correct your faults.”\n\nIn truth, though, Pato’s tumble down the Milan pecking order had more to do with his body than with his personal relationships. When Allegri arrived in summer 2010, Pato’s muscles had already given hints they were struggling to cope with the strain of top-level football. He was still able to produce flashes of brilliance – he made Barcelona look slow and silly at the Nou Camp, for instance – but they became rarer and rarer. By the time the forward left San Siro, two and a half years later, he had suffered a total of 16 injuries, the vast majority of them to his hamstrings and quadriceps.\n\nThis was bewildering, both to outside observers and Pato himself. “I lost confidence,” he told Gazzetta dello Sport earlier this year, and little wonder. He started just seven games for Milan in 2012, completing 90 minutes on only one occasion. “That really messes with a player in a way that can be difficult to understand,” says Cardoso, who has remained close with Pato.\n\nIt did not help that Milan’s doctors seemed unable to get a grip on what was happening. Pato was sent to specialists in the US and Germany for treatment. Some believed it was a psychological issue. It was even suggested that the length of the grass at San Siro was to blame. Solutions, though, proved oddly elusive. “He’s been all over,” Jean-Pierre Meersseman, the founder of Milan Lab, told Gazzetta dello Sport in 2012. “He’s seen and been looked at by scores of doctors and therapists. I don’t know which saint to turn to anymore. I asked my spiritual adviser to pray for him.”\n\nEventually, Pato decided to take matters into his own hands.\n\nAs his Milan career petered out, he flew to Brazil for a private consultation with Dr Turibio Leite de Barros, a physiologist who had previously worked with Kaka. He wanted answers. He wanted hope. He wanted focus on the next chapter of his career — he was still just 23 — without worrying about the next snap or twang.\n\n“Pato was concerned about the frequency of the muscle injuries,” recalls Dr Leite de Barros. “They had really impacted his career. It was a question of demystifying things — dispelling the notion that he was cursed. It was clear, even before a full examination, that there was nothing major wrong with him. He was a young kid who just needed a bit of help.”\n\nPato stayed in Sao Paulo for three days, undergoing a thorough examination. “We did a series of exams, focusing on different muscle groups,” Dr Leite de Barros explains. “We used electrodes to test him, analysing muscle by muscle. We asked him to go through movements that mirrored game situations: acceleration, sprinting, deceleration, ball control.\n\n“The diagnosis was that he was still suffering the lingering effects of the previous injuries. When you have a muscle problem, it’s natural for the human body to ‘defend’ that muscle. Unconsciously, you end up using it less due to the memory of the pain. A muscle that isn’t used atrophies, loses strength. And then, when it’s called into action in a quick movement, you have another injury. That’s what was happening with him, repeatedly.”\n\nThe root of the problem — later confirmed by medical staff at his next club, Sao Paulo’s Corinthians — was imbalance. Pato had built up powerful quads but had not worked on his hamstrings to the same extent — a recipe for disaster. Dr Leite de Barros put together a booklet recommending exercises that would help him to get back on an even keel, allowing his damaged thigh muscles to finally heal properly.\n\n“It wasn’t rocket science,” he says. Which naturally begs the question — why couldn’t Milan’s medical staff figure it out?\n\n“It’s delicate to comment on these things, due to professional ethics,” Dr Leite de Barros says, cautiously. “But I think you’ve answered your own question. It was surprising to me. That kind of diagnosis should already have been done, no doubt about it. It’s hard to judge why it wasn’t.”\n\nGiven that evaluation, it is hardly surprising that Pato himself later laid the blame for his injury woes squarely at the club’s door.\n\n“What happened at Milan had nothing to do with me,” he said during an interview on Brazilian television. “I paid the price, but I wasn’t the one to blame.\n\n“The treatment there is different to the treatment (in Brazil). If you get injured in Italy, you don’t do anything for 20 days. Only swimming pool, physiotherapy. Then, in one week, you do all the work you should have been doing in those 20 days. For a year and half, I played one game, got injured for a month, came back, and then got injured again. Everyone can see the results of what is happening there. The players there are still getting injured a lot.”\n\nInterlude 2: Desire\n\n“Pato is the most overrated player in the country. When he came through, I thought he was going to be one of the best in the world. He was quick, two-footed, good in the air. An exceptional player. But when I look at him, I don’t see the hunger that Edmundo, Djalminha, Ronaldo or Alex had. Football is just a diversion for Pato.” (Neto, former Corinthians and Brazil playmaker, YouTube, May 2020)\n\n“From the very first time I saw you, I thought that a goal a game for someone like you wasn’t enough. Once again, you could have scored three. At times, it’s like you do the bare minimum.” (Carlo Ancelotti, Sky Italia, 2011)\n\nA team that revels in its outsider status and a player with something — everything — to prove: Corinthians and Pato should have been a match made in heaven. Their top brass had been trying to make it happen for a year. The €15 million fee was the largest ever paid by a Brazilian club, but they expected him to fill seats and sell shirts. His face was plastered all over their marketing material, including the memorable – albeit slightly dubious – ‘Corinthians epidemic’ campaign.\n\nThe physios got him fit. He scored in his first game, with his very first touch. And then… well, nothing good.\n\nPato was awful. He missed chances. The ball bounced off him. He ran around like a headless chicken. All of which would just about have been excusable had he not committed what amounts to a cardinal sin at Corinthians: Looking like you don’t care.\n\nThis is a blue-collar club. The team, managed by Tite, was a study in gritty collectivism. Rightly or wrongly, the fans and the other players felt Pato considered himself above it all.\n\nFor months, distrust bubbled under the surface. Then, when Pato dinked a crucial penalty straight into the arms of Gremio goalkeeper Dida in a Copa do Brasil shootout, it burst forth. The supporters howled with anger. Two or three of his team-mates had to be physically restrained on the pitch. They wanted to punch his lights out.\n\nFor many, this was a watershed moment.\n\n“He took it (the penalty) that way due to a feeling of superiority, because he thinks he’s a superstar,” wrote Tostao. “He isn’t and he never was. Pato has never even played 10 great games.”\n\nEdu Gaspar, then Corinthians’ director of football and now at Arsenal, pulled no punches. “We were all excited, but the player didn’t arrive with that Corinthians attitude,” he said. “Here, you play with a knife between your teeth. You have to think, ‘OK, I’m not playing that well today, but I’m going to fight’. I’m hoping we sell him.”\n\nRespite came across town at Sao Paulo FC. Injury-free and visibly happier, Pato played 98 times in two years, scoring 38 goals.\n\nIn part, this was down to tactics. For a start, Pato was back playing in his preferred position — not as a central striker, but as a wide forward, cutting in from the flanks. This is another strand to the Pato conundrum: he spent years trying to be something he was not, getting judged against standards he didn’t set for himself. It was simple category error. And Pato claimed Silvio Berlusconi was chiefly responsible for it.\n\n“I played out wide when I turned professional,” he said in July 2015. “It was the same (early on) at Milan, with Inzaghi and then with Zlatan Ibrahimovic. It was Berlusconi who suggested that I play through the middle. I tried it, and even played there for Brazil, but I don’t have the physical strength to keep bouncing off defenders and holding the ball up. That’s not my game. I like to have the ball and run at defenders. I can offer more when I play open down the flanks, making the most of my speed and tracking back.”\n\nIt also helped that Pato had another coach who understood he preferred the carrot to the stick. Muricy Ramalho had first met him a decade earlier at Internacional, and went out of his way to restore his confidence. The arrival of Kaka, on loan from Orlando City of Major League Soccer, only improved the outlook.\n\n“He and Kaka had a really good relationship,” Ramalho tells The Athletic. “Kaka always wanted to help and he made it easier for Pato. Plus, Pato is just a really good professional. He was great for us in every respect — on the pitch and off it. It worked out really well.”\n\nInterestingly, even Ramalho admits that the natural vibrations of Pato’s personality can trip him up. The appraisal is not so different in content to Edu’s; the difference is that Ramalho was able to get inside Pato’s head and press the right buttons. He did not feel that he was dealing with a busted flush.\n\n“I told him he needed to show desire — to always be striving for more,” he says. “Pato is an exceptional player technically, but he needed to fight a bit more. That’s what he lacked, not just confidence. Football isn’t just about ability; it’s physical, and you have to compete. That was what was missing.\n\n“We talked about it a lot. We got the most out of him when that more physical, competitive edge appeared alongside his technical side. He’s an intelligent player who absorbs things quickly, so it wasn’t too hard to restore his confidence.”\n\nInterlude 3: Fracture\n\n“You hear all these comments about Pato. ‘He doesn’t shine because he doesn’t want it enough’, or ‘Nobody doubts his enormous talent’. I doubt it. Pato is missing the main quality that all great players have: lucidity in his decisions. Pato is confused and makes too many errors. He’s a fragmented footballer, schizophrenic on the pitch. His is a career of little bursts, a few brilliant moments. He’s divided into parts that never come together.” (Tostao, Folha de Sao Paulo, July 2016)\n\nAt the end of his Sao Paulo loan, Pato got a giant approach from China. Tianjin Quanjian offered Corinthians €20 million for him; as Pato owned 40 per cent of his economic rights, he would have made €8 million on the spot. Add Chinese Super League wages to the mix and it’s easy to see why it would have appealed. Easy to see why Corinthians were desperate to cut their losses, too.\n\nBut Pato felt he had unfinished business in Europe. “He wanted to go back and prove he was able to cut it — that what happened at Milan was just a bad moment,” says Ramalho. “He had not given up on the dream of doing well in Europe. He wanted to give his response.”\n\nYet when his agent Gilmar Veloz touted Pato to a series Premier League clubs in 2015, there were no takers. “Nobody wanted him,” a source close to the player tells The Athletic. Eventually, after an intervention from Kia Joorabchian, Chelsea agreed to take him on loan. The weakness of the Brazilian Real made it a cheap enough deal: Pato’s wages equated to around £30,000 a week. There was only one issue: the manager, Guus Hiddink, didn’t want him. He played twice in six months.\n\nA stint at Villarreal in Spain wasn’t much more productive, and so Pato did finally answer Tianjin’s siren call. There, he found another sympathetic manager in Fabio Cannavaro. He also found the football very, very easy.\n\n“He was head and shoulders above the rest,” Cannavaro said in a recent Q&A on Instagram. Any video of his best moments there will make you want to send a condolence card to the Chinese Defenders’ Union.\n\nThis, then, is where we’re at with Alexandre Pato: amazing in China, hit and miss in Brazil — he has not reached the same heights since returning to Sao Paulo FC a year ago — and unlikely to ever get a third tilt at Europe. Barring a miracle, there will be no Champions League. No Ballon d’Or. No Golden Boot. No World Cup finals. His has been a respectable career but not an era-defining one. A curio rather than a monument.\n\nWas he ever that good, really? Briefly, yes, and it is tantalising to speculate about how far he might have gone if Ancelotti had remained at Milan, and if he had played in his best position. Above all, if that incessant drumbeat of injuries had not broken his momentum.\n\nAt the same time, it is worth noting that none of the shortcomings of 2020-issue Pato are physical. Those muscle problems were not terminal; he still has the turn of pace that quickened heart rates when he was a teenager, can still turn on a 50 centavo coin. The most compelling explanation is they simply sapped his mental resources: his confidence, his concentration, his conviction that he was heading for the stratosphere. It is hard to sand down the raw edges of your game when you’re spending most of your waking hours on a treatment table.\n\nFor those who knew him at the start, back when Pato’s potential fizzed like a freshly-struck match, there are mixed feelings. “The expectations were very high and he did have the talent,” says Cardoso. “I don’t know whether he should have done more. Maybe his ascent took him to his limit.”\n\nIarley is more forthright.\n\n“I definitely expected a lot more from him,” he concludes. “With the potential he had, he should have been Brazil’s No 9 until today.”\n\n(Photo: Claudio Villa/Getty Images)"
