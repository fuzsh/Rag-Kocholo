        "text": "Alexandre Pato was once touted as one of football's hottest prospects, particularly during his time at AC Milan in the Serie A.\n\nHowever, Chelsea flop Pato never quite lived up to his early expectations, and his time at the top was fleeting. It seemed as soon as the Brazilian striker had arrived at the top, he had left.\n\nBut one man Pato certainly left a lasting impression on was Silvio Berlusconi, the former president of AC Milan. Berlusconi, 86, passed away on Monday (June 12) at the San Raffaele hospital in Milan. While his cause of death is unknown, Berlusconi had been treated for a lung infection linked to chronic leukaemia.\n\nThe 86-year-old was often larger than life during his spell as Italian prime minister - and during his time at Milan.\n\nREAD MORE: Silvio Berlusconi promised footballers 'bus of prostitutes' months before death\n\nNot only did Pato star for his side in the early 2010s, but the Brazilian spent two-and-a-half years in a relationship with his daughter, Barbara Berlusconi.\n\nShortly after winning the Scudetto with Milan in 2011, still their most recent to date, Pato entered into a relationship with Barbara, who was five years his senior. However, this period of Pato's life also coincides with his first spell of injury troubles.\n\nDo you remember Pato, what did you think of his spell at Chelsea? Let us know in the comments section\n\nAs a result, Pato was often in the stands, and when Barbara began appearing alongside the Brazilian rumours started swirling that the pair were dating. Pato was even snapped kissing Barbara's belly as fans began to speculate that the pair were starting a family.\n\nHowever, their relationship split the AC Milan dressing room. A source inside Silvio Berlusconi's media group Mediaset told the Daily Mail: \"The rest of the squad realised they had to bite their tongues in front of Pato.\n\n\"They couldn't say certain things about the club or directors. When your team-mate is dating the president's daughter, you need to be careful.\"\n\nThe source also revealed that the squad blamed Barbara for his downturn in form: \"The rest of the squad, rightly or wrongly, linked this to his influential partner.\"\n\nBy 2013, their relationship was coming to an end, especially after Pato moved onto Corinthians in his homeland, halfway across the world.\n\nThere was an infamous incident in 2012, where Pato had looked set to join PSG, but had a late change of heart. Barbara still denies that she was a factor in Pato's decision to remain in Milan to this day.\n\nPato spent the second half of the 2015/16 on loan with Chelsea, but only managed two appearances, scoring once."
