        "text": "Alexandre Pato, once tipped for the very top of the game, has joined Chelsea in a six-month loan move.\n\nThe Brazilian striker has arrived in London and, after weeks of speculation, finalised the deal on Friday.\n\nInterim Blues boss Guus Hiddink jumped to Pato’s defence this week, claiming signing the 26-year-old - yes, he’s still only 26 - isn’t a gamble for the club.\n\nHiddink said: “Coming on loan makes it possible to have a good view of him, whether he's able to adapt to the high demands of the club and the League.\n\n\"We'll give him all the support in this, but it's up to him. If you buy these kind of players, who must take the next step, then it's more of a risk. Taking him on loan is good for everyone, to see whether he's happy at this club and if the club are happy with him.\n\n“It will take him a while [to play]. He cannot yet be fully fit because Corinthians were only in [pre-season] preparations.”\n\nWhile Hiddink was vociferous in his justification for the move, Pato’s decline since his early years at AC Milan is concerning and suggests an element of risk.\n\nPato returned to his native Brazil in 2013 despite taking the famous number nine shirt at Milan after Flippo Inzaghi’s retirement.\n\nThe move was seen as a ploy to reignite his career after years of plateauing in Italy and, while he hasn’t been prolific, it seems to have worked.\n\nHe scored 19 goals in 59 league games for Sao Paulo - just over one strike in every three appearances - but has also harnessed his selfishness, laying on plenty of assists for his team-mates.\n\nPato, however, hasn’t played competitively for over two months because of the structure to the Brazilian league, so is unlikely to make the instant impact perhaps Chelsea fans are hoping for.\n\nHe has also been plagued by injuries since a tender age. In 2010 alone, he tweaked or pulled the same hamstring three times as his spell at Milan began to peter out.\n\nPato then struggled with a thigh problem which saw his miss large chunks of the 2011-2012 season, forcing Milan to start questioning his worth. He was reportedly on the brink of joining PSG as the Italian giants pondered cashing in on the Brazilian so they could fund a move for Carlos Tevez. Pato, though, snubbed the proposed switch.\n\nHis ex-wife Sthefany Brito also raised concerns about his temperament and 'party boy' antics following their divorce, which may indicate why his potential has never truly been fulfilled.\n\nChelsea’s disastrous season is epitomised by their strikers' fortunes, with Diego Costa in the headlines mainly for the wrong reasons and Loic Remy and Radamel Falcao misfiring altogether.\n\nRemy and Falcao have managed just two league goals between them this season, so the Pato acquisition certainly makes sense on paper.\n\nThe Falcao blueprint also points to smart business in that Pato has only been brought in, initially, on loan so the Blues can see how he adapts to the Premier League without having to fully commit.\n\nFalcao has been an unequivocal disaster since his move to England in summer 2014 and has shown almost no evidence why he was once regarded as one of the deadliest marksmen in Europe.\n\nChelsea will be hoping it isn’t a case of déjà vu with Pato. The jury is still very much out on the Brazilian, so a trial period at Stamford Bridge makes sense. If he can stay fit, Hiddink’s risk-free argument could be vindicated."
