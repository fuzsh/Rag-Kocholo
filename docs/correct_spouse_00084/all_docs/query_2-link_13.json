        "text": "Legendary Brazilian striker and global FIFA World Cup ambassador, Ronaldo, may have been linked to a bevy of beauties and married four times within the span of 18 years.\n\nBut after ending his recent seven-year marriage to Bia Anthony last December, it seems that the 36-year-old has found love again - both in women and in his new found hobby of cooking.\n\nRonaldo is now dating Brazilian club DJ Paula Morais, whom he met earlier this year after his separation from Anthony.\n\nMorais also accompanied the former Corinthians striker to the Brazil's famous Carnival parade and when she isn't spinning away on the turn tables, Morais is busy keeping her famous beau's fluctuating weight in check.\n\nIndeed, after going through strict diet for a reality show on Brazilian TV where he lost 17kg, Morais has also assumed the role of Ronaldo's personal 'weight watcher'.\n\nOn Sunday, she posted a photo of a proud Ronaldo holding a pan of omelette he had prepared for himself with the caption: \"A man's place is the kitchen!I love you!\"\n\nHere's hoping that Morais can churn out some inspirational tunes for Ronaldo when he hits the gym...\n\nAccording to new reports in Italy's Vanity Fair magazine, the 'Bad Boy' of Football - Mario Balotelli - has completely changed his outlook on life thanks to his new relationship.\n\nAnd interestingly, Fanny Neguesha, the Belgian model whom the AC Milan striker has been dating for the past four months, has achieved what her predecessors (his former girlfriends) failed to : tame the hot-headed player.\n\n\"She is strong, confident and generous,\" gushed Balotelli to Vanity Fair Italia.\n\n\"We met in Brussels. Then I tried (wooing her) from a distance from Manchester: I called and sent her messages. But it did not work. I had to rent a private jet and go see her,\" he added.\n\nAnd all his elaborate efforts in pursuing Neguesha certainly seems to have worked in the 22-year-old Italian's favour.\n\nHe has since scored 7 goals in 7 matches for the Rossoneri, with not a training ground bust-up in sight. Despite being a feisty and controversial character at Man City, Balotelli has also fitted in well into the AC Milan set-up, fostering a new bond with teammate El Shaarawy.\n\n\"Since meeting Fanny, I have been less distracted and nervous (on the pitch),\" he admitted in the same interview.\n\nIn a new photo posted online, Balotelli and Neguesha were pictured having a laugh as they both wore matching khaki shorts on his couch.\n\nWhen asked about Pia, Balotelli's daughter with his ex-girlfriend, Rafaella Fico, the striker said : \"I would be happy if she (had) my blood. But I would like to ask (the public) to respect this story (of me and Rafaella) as it hasn't been easy,\" he said.\n\nThey say that long-distance relationships are difficult, but this seems to be far from the mind of AC Milan's vice-president and Alexandre Pato's girlfriend, Barbara Berlusconi.\n\nAfter his departure from Milan to pursue his career in Brazil with Brasileirao side Corinthians, the couple have been busy jet-setting in between Europe and South America on their free days.\n\nOf course, Barbara's relationship with the 23-year-old striker has been met with controversy in Italy, due to her designation as an employer of AC Milan.\n\nIt was also reported that a 'gag order' had been imposed on several media outlets owned by her father - former Italian PM, Silvio Berlusconi - which prevented them from questioning and debating the relationship.\n\nIn addition, Italian gossip rags reported last year that Pato had faced pressure from Berlusconi to \"marry his daughter\" or face the wrath of the Italian mafia. However, the story was later dismissed as gossip.\n\n\"I'll watch him whenever I can. I will take a 12 hour flight to spend just three days by his side,\" Barbara declared when asked by Brazilian media recently.\n\nAdded Pato : \"When two people love, respect each other and are willing to be together, anything is possible.\"\n\nHowever, Barbara has also reiterated her desire to see the relationship working out in the long run.\n\n\"We are two active people, young people - and we are still building a life: it's just that everyone has their own goals, even if they (are in different jobs) And, really, that's tiring and requires effort,\" explained Pato."
