        "text": "Tottenham's terrific totty!\n\nNAME: Sylvie van der Vaart?? (top left)\n\nAKA: Spurs dynamic Dutchman Rafael Van Der Vaart’s other half\n\n??LOOKS LIKE: She could be a right handful. Check out the video below which shows Mrs VderV has some super ball skills! ?\n\nBEFORE SHE WAS FAMOUS: Began modelling at 18 and voted Holland’s sexiest female in 2003 before shacking up with Rafa. Come on, she was never going to struggle was she???The Dutch have had a right result. They’ve got Mrs van der Vaart casting her very pretty eyes over competitors on Britain’s Got Talent equivalent, Das Supertalent.\n\nNAME: Abigail Clancy (bottom left)\n\nAKA: Fiancee and soon to be baby-mama of Tottenham and England striker Peter Crouch.\n\nLOOKS LIKE: To look at her you'd think she's way out of Crouchy's league and you'd be right. The boy done good!\n\nBEFORE SHE WAS FAMOUS: Was a member of girl band Genie Queen, a group she formed in Liverpool when she was 17, however, they disbanded after three years.\n\nBONUS VIDEO:\n\nAC Milan's Bella Donne!\n\nNAME: Barbara Berlusconi (top right)\n\nAKA: The Italian PM's youngest daughter and rumoured new girlfriend of Milan's Alexandre Pato.\n\nLOOKS LIKE: Fortunately she doesn't resemble her headline grabbing father, she looks more like Silvio's young female 'friends'.\n\nBEFORE SHE WAS FAMOUS: Barbara's a lucky girl, Daddy happens to own AC Milan and recently she took on a senior role at club in the communications department. Alexandre Pato's recent divorce from Brazilian actress Sthefany Britoleft the door ajar for Barbara who has snuck in and grabbed her man. Let's just hope Pato doesn't dump her, her Dad's his boss!\n\nBONUS VIDEO:\n\nNAME: Helena Seger (bottom right)\n\nAKA: Wife of AC Milan's Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic\n\nLOOKS LIKE: The sexy Swede is bit of a cougar - she's 11 years senior to Zlat, which we think makes her around 40. She kind of looks like Ulrika Johnson with some work done but hopefully not as insane!"
