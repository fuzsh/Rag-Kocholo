The jet includes a kitchen, two bathrooms, and 16 seats that can be folded to beds.\n\nThe jet is valued at $15 million, and during the summer, Messi travels around with his family on a yacht which can cost $50,000 per week.\n\nIn addition to his hefty salary and bonuses, much of his income derives from endorsements.\n\nMessi’s main sponsor since 2006 is the sportswear company Adidas.\n\nAs Barcelona's leading youth prospect, he had been signed with Nike since the age of 14, but transferred to Adidas after they successfully won the claim to his image rights in court.\n\nOver time, Messi established himself as their leading brand endorser, and from 2008, he had a long-running signature collection of Adidas F50 boots.\n\nIn 2015, he became the first footballer to receive his own sub-brand of Adidas boots, the Adidas Messi.\n\nAt the start of his career, Messi mainly held sponsorship contracts with companies that employ sports-oriented marketing, such as Adidas, Pepsi, and Japanese video game company Konami.\n\nBut as from 2010, his marketing appeal widened, due to hisnincreased achievements as a player, leading to long-term endorsement deals with luxury brands Dolce & Gabbana and Audemars Piguet.\n\nMessi is also a global brand ambassador for Gillette, Turkish Airlines, Ooredoo, and Tata Motors, among other companies.\n\nHe was the face of Konami's video game series Pro Evolution Soccer, appearing on the covers of PES 2009, PES 2010, PES 2011 and PES 2020.\n\nHe subsequently signed with rival company EA Sports to become the face of their video game series FIFA and has since appeared on four consecutive covers from FIFA 13 to FIFA 16.\n\nMessi also has an incredible fanbase on social media.\n\nMessi's Facebook page has over 116 million followers, the second highest for a sportsperson after Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nHe also has over 501 million Instagram followers, the second highest for an individual and sportsperson after Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nHis iconic 2022 FIFA World Cup celebration post from 18 December 2022 is the most liked post on Instagram with over 70 million likes.\n\nIn June 2021, Messi signed a five-year deal to become an ambassador for the Hard Rock Cafe brand.\n\nAnd in May 2022, Messi was unveiled as Saudi Arabia's tourism ambassador.\n\nMessi's current contract with Inter Miami is worth a guaranteed $20.5 per year, approximately $5 million more than the next highest-paid MLS player.\n\nThe Albiceleste skipper also has profit-sharing deals with Apple TV, whose 10-year, $2.5 billion contract makes them the primary global broadcast partner of MLS, and with Adidas.\n\nThe eight-time Ballon d’Or winner drastically turned around Inter Miami's business operations, with their revenue more than doubling to $118 million in 2023, from $56 million in 2022.\n\nThe significant change in the club's fortune has fueled the club’s appreciation following the arrival of Leo Messi.\n\nForbes estimates Inter Miami is now the second-most-valuable MLS team, worth $1.03 billion after a 72% bump from a year ago.\n\nThe franchise is the second in MLS history to achieve a billion-dollar valuation, following in the footsteps of the league's most valuable team Los Angeles FC ($1.2 billion).\n\nInter Miami had also finished selling its entire 2024 season ticket inventory two weeks after the 2023 season concluded.\n\nMessi’s move to Miami also doubled the subscriber count of MLS Season Pass, the league’s subscription streaming service with Apple, which is expected to bring in at least $2.5 billion over 10 years.\n\nOnce the subscription service reaches a certain threshold, Apple and MLS will share revenue and Messi is expected to profit from that share either way.\n\nAs of 2024, Lionel Messi, despite his unparalleled success and earnings throughout his illustrious career, possesses an estimated net worth of $650 million, making him the second richest footballer in the world.\n\nThis figure, while still exorbitant by most standards, might seem comparatively modest given Messi's astronomical achievements on the pitch and global fame.\n\nIs Lionel Messi a Billionaire?\n\nNo! Lionel Messi is not yet a billionaire, although he is not so far off from claiming that status.\n\nLike Ronaldo, despite Leo Messi's substantial earnings, which have exceeded the USD $1 billion-dollar mark over the years, his financial portfolio is subject to various deductions, including taxes, agent fees, investments, and lifestyle expenditures, which could significantly impact his overall net worth.\n\nMessi's position as the second richest footballer worldwide underscores the immense wealth accumulated within the sport.\n\nBeyond his earnings from football, Messi's endorsement deals, business ventures, and investments further solidify his financial prowess, showcasing his ability to leverage his iconic status both on and off the pitch to bolster his wealth and secure his legacy as one of the most financially successful athletes in history.\n\nMessi could very well reach the billionaire status in a few years considering the vast amount of lucrative business opportunities available via his contract with Inter Miami and Adidas.\n\n1.
