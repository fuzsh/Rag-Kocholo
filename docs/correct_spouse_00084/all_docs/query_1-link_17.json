        "text": "Chelsea might be paying mega-money to their stars but new signing Alexandre Pato already appears to be living the champagne lifestyle off the pitch.\n\nThe former Brazilian boy wonder has enjoyed a football career that has taken him from Milan to Sao Paulo, and now to London - and has had a host of girlfriends along the way.\n\nActresses, models and even a prime minister's daughter have followed Pato, 28, who once admitted: \"I like having girlfriends.\"\n\nBut it has been a turbulent ride for Pato, who was told he could be forced to have his arm amputated after a tumour was uncovered when he was just 11-years-old.\n\nAged 17 he scored on his AC Milan debut and the world were suddenly swooning over South America's next big thing.\n\nJust months after arriving in Italy, Pato was engaged to Sthefany Brito, who he met on a swimsuit photoshoot.\n\nBy July 2009, the pair tied the knot despite an on-off relationship - and threw a Â£170,000 party at Brazil's five-star Copacabana Palace hotel to celebrate.\n\nThe country's media branded the pair as Brazil's Posh and Becks as hundreds of people joined them as they wore matching Dolce and Gabana outfits for the bash.\n\nHowever, the marriage lasted just nine months and Sthefany moved back to Brazil with her mum and the pair endured a bitter divorce, which included a three-year legal battle.\n\nBut Pato wasted no time in moving on and hooked up with Miss Brazil 2010 Debora Lyra as they watched their country compete in the World Cup. Pato had missed out through injury.\n\nHectic work lives were the reported reasons for their split after just one month.\n\nLater that year, while Pato remained in Milan despite injuries hampering his progress, he began a relationship with Barbara Berlusconi - the daughter of former Italian prime minister and AC Milan owner Silvio.\n\nHe was alleged to have got her pregnant after pictures emerged of him kissing her stomach, as the pair continued to attend matches together while he was injured.\n\nTeam-mates were reportedly becoming uncomfortable with Pato's close relationship to Milan's hierarchy and in January 2013, they cut their losses and sold him to Brazilian side Corinthians.\n\nTravelling problems appeared to end the relationship with Barbara, as both were pictured and linked with other partners shortly after the move.\n\nHe tweeted in July 2013: \"After two and a half years of dating with many good things! The distance put an end to the relationship.\"\n\nPato was forced to deny a relationship with UFC ring girl Camila Oliveira.\n\nNow, he is in a relationship with model and TV presenter Fiorella Mattheis , with whom he has moved to England with.\n\nFiorella, 27, has already amassed 2.1million followers on Instagram and is well aware of the fame that comes with being a Premier League girlfriend.\n\nShe regularly shares photos of herself with Pato or her dogs, alongside a host of selfies.\n\nFiorella has been dating Pato since the end of 2014, just months after becoming divorced from her former partner Flavio Canto."
