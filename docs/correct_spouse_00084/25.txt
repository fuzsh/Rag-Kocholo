Brazil and AC Milan teenage striker Alexandre Pato married 22-year-old television actress Sthefany Brito in a lavish ceremony attended by soccer and show business celebrities.

The couple were married at the Sao Francisco de Paula church in central Rio de Janeiro before receiving guests at a party in the glamorous Copacabana Palace hotel on Tuesday night.

Dozens of fans, onlookers and media lined the street outside the hotel hoping for a glimpse of the couple, who did not permit pictures to be taken in the church or hotel.
