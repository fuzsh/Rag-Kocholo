The wife of Brazilian football star Alexandre Pato has dumped him over his wild nights with teammate Ronaldinho.

The 20-year-old star, a summer target of Chelsea, and actress Sthefany Brito, 22, were dubbed Brazil's Posh and Becks.

They wed nine months ago in a lavish 300,000-pound ceremony.

According to The Sun, Sthefany reportedly hit the roof over his partying with fellow AC Milan and Brazilian ace Ronaldinho in Italy.

â€œBrazil coach Dunga may leave Pato out of the World Cup over this," a source was quoted, as saying.
