One day, Dan decides to go from betting on races to competing in them when he purchases an unimpressive horse. Though his wife is fed up with him, Dan gets support from his sister-in-law, Princess (Myrna Loy), and stableman Whitey (Clarence Muse) as they try to turn the loser horse into a winner.",
