        "text": "Prime Video has picked up the family drama series The Baxters, from LightWorkers Media, the faith and family-focused company founded by Mark Burnett and Roma Downey which is owned by Amazon MGM Studios through Amazon’s the acquisition of LightWorkers parent MGM.\n\nThe 10-episode series, based on the best-selling book series by Karen Kingsbury, is executive produced by Downey who stars as the family matriarch, Elizabeth Baxter, alongside Ted McGinley as John Baxter. The Baxters, which is slated to stream spring 2024 exclusively on Prime Video, was filmed in 2018. Also executive produced by Will Packer, it was originally intended to stream on LightWorkers Media’s platform.\n\nThe Baxters follows Elizabeth and John Baxter and their five adult children. Season 1 centers on Elizabeth and John’s daughter, Kari, who learns the shocking truth that her professor husband, Tim, has been secretly having an affair with one of his college students. As her relationship is tested, Kari must seek comfort in her faith and family to discover if love is truly a choice and if her marriage can be redeemed. In this deeply moving faith-based journey, The Baxters must come together as a family to work through the challenges of life.\n\n“With over 25 million fans of the Baxter series books we know audiences are going to love this family drama brought to life, and I am personally so excited to bring more inspirational content to Prime Video,” Downey said.\n\nAdditional cast include Ali Cobrin (American Reunion) as Kari Baxter Jacobs, Masey McLain (On Fire) as Ashley Baxter, Josh Plasse (iCarly) as Luke Baxter, Cassidy Gifford (God’s Not Dead) as Reagan Decker, Reilly Anspaugh (Chauncey) as Erin Baxter, Emily Peterson (Chicago P.D.) as Brooke Baxter, and Brandon Hirsch (Atlanta) as Tim Jacobs.\n\nDowney and LightWorkers Media originally acquired the rights to Kingsbury’s The Baxter Family novel series for television eight years ago.\n\n“Since the day Roma Downey asked for my blessing in making the Baxter family literary series into a televised show, I have dreamed that it might find a home on Prime Video,” Kingsbury said. “Many millions of readers are going to be thrilled over this news. It is a dream come true.”\n\nThe Baxters is produced by LightWorkers Media, Will Packer Media, and Haven Entertainment. Jessie Rosen serves as showrunner and executive producer. Executive producing alongside Downey, Rosen and Packer are Kevin Mann, Brendan Bragg, and Jaime Primak Sullivan. Karen Kingsbury and Rick Christian are consulting producers."
