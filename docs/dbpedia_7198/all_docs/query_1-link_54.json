        "text": "Two of the most talked-about new movies these days, “Lincoln”’ and “Django Unchained,” both center on slavery, a subject that’s infrequently been tackled by Hollywood. When was the last time two big slavery movies were released more or less simultaneously? As it happens, 75 years ago when Tay Garnett’s “Slave Ship” arrived in theaters a month or two before Henry Hathaway’s “Souls at Sea.”\n\nBoth of these quasi-historical epics were inspired by the box-office success of Oscar-winning MGM’s “Mutiny on the Bounty” (1935) — “Souls at Sea,” starring Gary Cooper, and “Slave Ship” each include a mutiny, as well as a climactic fire, a trial at the end, and a first mate (George Raft in “Souls” and Wallace Beery in “Slave Ship”) who makes a heroic sacrifice on behalf of the hero.\n\nFox’s Darryl Zanuck, who had access to MGM stars thanks to investments by Metro’s Nicholas Schenck and Louis B. Mayer, had hope to lure “Mutiny” star Clark Gable to star in “Slave Ship,” but had to settle for borrowing Beery and the up-and-coming juvenile star Mickey Rooney. For the lead, Zanuck went with Warner Baxter (“42nd Street”) an aging Fox contract star who would be off the roster by 1940, triggering a nervous breakdown.\n\n“Slave Ship” — recently out on DVD from the Fox Cinema Archives manufacture-on-demand program — was originally slated for John Ford, who had directed Baxter’s best performance the previous year in “The Prisoner of Shark Island.” Ford apparently begged off this project, as did Howard Hawks. But not before Hawks brought in his longtime collaborator, William Faulkner, to rework the script that the respected Lamarr Trotti, an expert on historical subjects — and the team of Sam Hellman and Gladys Lehmann, better known for Shirley Temple vehicles — had adapted from a novel written by a Long Island general practioner. Faulkner, who received an “story by” credit, explained: “I’m a motion picture doctor. When they run into a section they don’t like, I rework it and continue to rework it until they do like it. In ‘Slave Ship,’ I reworked sections.”\n\nExecutive-produced by Nunnally Johnson (who may also have had an uncredited hand in the script), “Slave Ship” is set in 1860, when veteran slave trader Baxter is running a “blood” barque called the Alabatross between Africa and the Southeastern U.S. after the trade has been outlawed by international laws (the French title translates as “The Last Slave Trader”). But he has a change of heart after meeting a beautiful Virginia abolitonist (Elizabeth Allan of “A Tale of Two Cities,” recently separated from MGM, and a last-minute replacement for Will Rogers’ daughter Mary, who succumed to the same flu epidemic that shut down production of “Souls at Sea” altogether for a while).\n\nBaxter instructs first mate Beery to pay off the crew and hire some non-slavers so he can sail with his new bride to Jamaica, where he plans to retire on a plantation. But Beery and the second-mate (a monocled George Sanders) double-cross Baxter and surprise him on his honeymoon with a mutiny of the original crew, Baxter’s partners who are not going to give up their lucrative jobs without a fight.\n\nBaxter eventually manages to take control of the ship with the help of a loyal cabin boy (Rooney), setting the stage for an action-packed confrontation with Beery and the cutthroat crew as he tries to take the ship into British-controlled Saint Helena.\n\n“Slave Ship” offers a much more horrifying view of the slave trade than the more romantic “Souls at Sea” (though both films get bogged down in romantic subplots). Early on, there’s a long tracking shot of chained slaves being whipped below decks. African trader Joseph Schildkraut (in dusky makeup and earrings) is seen in closeup whipping slaves, and there’s an early scene where an ill slave waiting to board is executed to make room for a healthier specimen on the boat.\n\nBut the scene that really got to me was Beery giving orders to “get rid” of the slaves before the approach of the British, for whom slaving was a hanging offense. The sailors simply tie an anchor to the slaves, who are chained together, and they begin to tumble off the deck into the water — until Baxter, who shoots Beerry, takes control and stops the massacre.\n\nThe AFI catalogue quotes a “modern source” as claiming that “blacks who were servants and chauffeurs to Hollywood stars and producers were hired to play slaves.” In fact, the only recognizable black actor in the cast is an uncredited Matthew Beard — formerly Stymie of the Little Rascals — as a youngster who briefly appears on the Atlanta pier. Also appearing unbilled is Lon Chaney Jr. as a workman who is crushed during the ship’s launching in the very first scene.\n\nThere are also many familiar faces among the billed cast, including Jane Darwell, Miles Mander and Arthur Hohl. “Slave Ship” is expertly directed Tay Garnett (“One-Way Passage”), who managed to get more restained performances from Beery and Rooney than was often the case back at MGM. Berry received critical praise for what amounted to his first excursion into full-fledged villainy since “The Big House” seven years earlier.\n\n“Slave Ship” was far better received by critics and the public than the muddled “Souls at Sea,” which I reviewed when it recently debuted on DVD as part of the TCM Vault Collection’s “Universal Rarities” set. But the Paramount flop somehow received three Oscar nominations (for score, art direction and assistant directing) vs. none for Fox’s (the no-less-lavishly produced) “Slave Ship.”\n\nThe off-the-shelf transfer used for the Fox Cinema Archives release of “Slave Ship” (available from Amazon, Movies Unlimited and other etailers) is fairly clean, but aged and on the dark side. I had to turn up the brightness in many scenes, and there wasn’t much in the way of contrast. Still, it’s an opportunity to see a fascinating, historically important movie that was a syndication staple back in the day but has been largely out of circulation for decades."
