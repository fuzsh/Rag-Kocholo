        "text": "This week marks two years at FLASH and I couldn‚Äôt be prouder or more grateful how fast things have gone. It‚Äôs been an amazing journey filled with growth, learning, and exciting challenges. First and foremost, I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to my colleagues, mentors, and the entire FLASH organization. Your support and guidance have been invaluable, and I am truly thankful for the opportunities I‚Äôve had to work with such an all-star team. One of the proudest moments of my career was being part of the team that worked with FLASH Leadership to resolve one of the ‚Äúunspoken-infamous ticket issues‚Äù. It was a complex challenge, but together, we found a solution and improved our services. Another highlight has been working in the field with some of FLASH‚Äôs cutting-edge technology like ‚ÄúOffline Mode‚Äù. WATCH OUT PARKING WORLD, the advancements we‚Äôre making at FLASH are truly groundbreaking, and it‚Äôs EXCITING to be on the front lines of innovation in the parking industry. With the upgrade in our services and the implementation of Regionalization, I‚Äôve proudly stepped into the role of Field Project Manager. In the past, this role has allowed me to contribute and unify parking solutions across entire cities, municipalities, and regions in four countries. It‚Äôs a blessing to work in an environment where efforts are truly appreciated and where I have the opportunity to make a significant impact. I also feel incredibly honored to have been chosen to be part of the ‚ÄúCEO advisory board‚Äù. The connections and network we have at FLASH are shaping the future of parking, and I am thrilled to be a part of it. Working at FLASH has been a FUN experience in every sense of the word‚Ä¶ and if you know me, you know I love making acronyms. So here‚Äôs one for F.U.N: - F - Fulfillment: Finding purpose and satisfaction in the work we do. - U - Unity: Collaborating with an incredible team that feels like family. - N - New Beginnings: Embracing innovation and the exciting future of parking. Thank you, FLASH Parking, for an amazing two years. Here‚Äôs to many more years of growth, innovation, and fun! PSA - It doesn‚Äôt seem like work when you‚Äôre having so much F.U.N. üòú #WorkAnniversary #Grateful #ATeam #FLASH #Innovation #ParkingIndustry #FieldProjectManager #FutureOfParking\n\nI am really excited that we are featuring musical talent in our weekly ai video competition. Big Swede joined our community last week, and he makes some great bangers. There is a moment when you think \"OMG, I can work with AI software and do everything.\" It's true you can. And so can everyone else. I feel that it's way better to work WITH other people. We level each other up. And it feels great to celebrate other artists. So take this as a suggestion if you are an ai directors - consider finding more ways to highlight music (and audio) from talent that includes another human. There are win-wins out there. It's great when minds meet. We are AI neutral. (That may sound funny because we make it really easy to use AI inside our platform) Use it. Don't use it. What ever. You can make some sweet live action content without any AI. But work together, and work with amazing people. And don't lambast them for using the new AI tools. Some of us will use it more than others. It's weird to hear so much ethically loaded pro / anti AI, to feel like I am now a voice for \"ai tolerance.\" Just allow artists the choice to use the right tools in the right context. Give credit when it's due. Celebrate the humans that use the tools, whether a brass instrument, MIDI or remixing with new-fangled AI tools. Celebrate the human behind the knobs. Want to make an AI music video with us? Come tomorrow to our discord. We'll show you how.\n\n\"In our experience, some of the big reasons why great concepts don't get to market, or when they do get to market, they can't scale properly, is because there is not a complete understanding of the full process of ideation to delivery and launch to operating. \"Fundamentally, the operations mindset isn't threaded throughout every component, from concept to build.\" This can be said for any creative project that needs to become a business (aka sustainable.) Knowing literally how value will be delivered and the factors of success (KPIs) to measure that transfer of value is important knowledge right from the ideation phase. Business and creativity go hand in hand. This is a great article that explores business modeling in FECs and trends through the lens of Spider Entertainment. I now have a new adventure to follow, as I'm keenly interested in seeing what happens next with Rob Hetherington and team."
