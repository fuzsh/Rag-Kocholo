        "text": "Texas Longhorns running back CJ Baxter heads into his second season on the Forty Acres. The top-ranked running back from the 2023 recruiting cycle played in 12 games last season with six starts.\n\nThe honorable mention All-Big 12 running back took over as the premier back following the injury to Jonathan Brooks starting the next four games including the Big 12 championship game and College Football Playoff semifinal against the Washington Huskies.\n\nThe Florida native expects to have a large role in the Steve Sarkisian offense during the upcoming season. Baxter finished second on the team in rushing with 659 yards and added 156 receiving yards. Baxter earned a 74.4 offensive grade and a 74.5 running grade from PFF during his freshman season.\n\nPreseason CJ Baxter Profile\n\nHometown: Edgewater, Florida\n\nHt: 6-1\n\nWt: 220\n\n247Sports Composite Ranking:\n\nFive-Star | No. 1 Running Back | No. 22 Overall (2023 Class)\n\nClass in 2024: Sophomore\n\nCareer Stats\n\nDepth Chart Overview\n\nBarring something unforeseen, CJ Baxter is expected to RB1 when the team kicks off the season against the Colorado State Rams on Aug. 31 at Darrell K. Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium. Baxter should lead a stable of backs that includes Jaydon Blue and Tre Wisner. The 2024 signees Jerrick Gibson and Christian Clark likely won’t see the field much unless this depth gets tested with injuries.\n\nCJ Baxter’s Photo Gallery"
