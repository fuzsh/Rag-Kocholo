        "text": "Entered movies in 1918 and emerged as a star in his first sound film, \"In Old Arizona\" (1929), playing the Cisco Kid. A capable middle-aged lead through the 1930s in such fine films as \"Daddy Long Legs\" (1931), \"One More Spring\" (1935), \"Thr Prisoner of Shark Island\" (1936) and \"The Road to Glory\" (1936), Baxter suffered a sharp career decline following a nervous breakdown in the early 1940s. He did keep working until shortly before his death, including appearances in a series of \"Crime Doctor\" mysteries, though many of his final films were low-budget affairs. He was married to silent screen performer Winifred Bryson."
