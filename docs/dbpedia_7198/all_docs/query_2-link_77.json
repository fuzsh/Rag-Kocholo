Cartoons\n\nANIMATION ANECDOTES posted by\n\nIn His Own Words: Bob Clampett Talks About Robert McKimson\n\nHere is a letter I received from Bob Clampett, dated March 28th, 1978, which provided me with further insight on Robert McKimson for an article I was writing.\n\nKeith Scott on Voices posted by Keith Scott\n\nMel Blanc: From Anonymity To Offscreen Superstar (The advent of on-screen voice credits)\n\nClarifying the facts behind the Mel Blanc’s exclusivity deal, and putting to rest some long-running falsehoods and wrong assumptions.\n\nBAXTER'S BREAKDOWNS posted by\n\nPorky and Daffy in “Boobs In The Woods” (1950)\n\nIn this film, Porky Pig is essentially trapped with Daffy in the woods – a lingering vestige of Daffy as a lunatic, as he originated from his screen debut.\n\nTHE GOLDEN AWARDS INTERVIEWS posted by\n\nA Chat with Martha Sigall\n\nThis week we go back to March 8th, 1986 to the Third Annual Golden Awards Banquet, beginning a fresh set of interviews by the head of the UCLA Animation Workshop – the late, great Dan McLaughlin.\n\nANIMATION ANECDOTES posted by\n\nIn His Own Words: Robert McKimson\n\nFor the November 28, 1972 issue of PUNCH magazine, writer Lloyd Chester interviewed Bob McKimson on the state of animation. Here are excerpts from that piece.\n\nBAXTER'S BREAKDOWNS posted by\n\nRobert McKimson’s “Walky Talky Hawky” (1946)\n\nThis month’s feature—AH SAY—this month’s feature is “Foghorn February” on Cartoon Research! Bob McKimson’s Foghorn, that is… and here is his first appearance! That’s NOT a joke, son!\n\nTHUNDERBEAN THURSDAY posted by\n\nIt’s Here – Private Snafu on Blu-ray!\n\nNever fear. A “New Set” is here! A year and a half in production, with the majority of that time involving digital cleanup of the films, Private Snafu is now on Blu-Ray.\n\nBAXTER'S BREAKDOWNS posted by\n\nMcKimson’s “Daffy Duck Hunt” (1949)\n\nBob McKimson sustained Daffy Duck’s zany personality well into the early ‘50s. Clever gags, aided by sharp timing and witty dialogue, make this an overlooked classic.\n\nBAXTER'S BREAKDOWNS posted by Devon Baxter\n\nRobert McKimson’s “A Ham In A Role”\n\nIn this week’s breakdown: a Shakespearian hound and the Goofy Gophers!"
