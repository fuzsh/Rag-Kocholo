        "text": "Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images\n\nTexas Longhorns running back CJ Baxter will reportedly miss the upcoming college football season after suffering a knee injury during Tuesday's practice.\n\nAccording to Anwar Richardson of Orangebloods.com, Baxter tore his LCL/PCL and will require surgery that will keep him sidelined for six to nine months.\n\nThis is quite the blow for the Longhorns, as ESPN's Pete Thamel noted he was the team's leading returning rusher and projected starter for the 2024 campaign.\n\nBaxter arrived at Texas as a 5-star prospect and the No. 1 overall running back in the 2023 recruiting class, per 247Sports' composite rankings. He was a solid playmaker in his freshman season and finished with 659 rushing yards, 156 receiving yards and five touchdowns.\n\nHe helped lead Texas to a Big 12 championship by scoring a touchdown in the win over Oklahoma State in the conference title game and then found the end zone again in the College Football Playoff during a loss to Washington.\n\nIt was reasonable to expect a jump from his first to second seasons in the collegiate game, especially after he picked up plenty of high-level experience as a freshman.\n\nThe Longhorns will likely rely on the combination of Jaydon Blue and Quintrevion Wisner in the backfield during Baxter's absence. While they both have some experience in the offense, it is still a difficult setback for a team that can use all the offensive firepower it can get as it moves to the SEC this season.\n\nTexas faces Michigan, Oklahoma, Georgia and Texas A&M, among others, in a difficult schedule and will surely be eyeing another CFP appearance."
