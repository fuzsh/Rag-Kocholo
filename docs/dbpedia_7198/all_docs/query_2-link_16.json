Here’s the updated list.\n\n44. 42nd Street (1933)\n\nPROGRAMMING NOTE: Our Pre-Code coverage will continue this year on a monthly basis, but will extend beyond Essentials to include other enjoyable pictures of the era that deserve to be seen and discussed, even if they aren’t stellar — like The Guardsman (1931). Stay tuned…\n\nCome back next Wednesday for another Wildcard post! And tune in again on Tuesday for my thoughts on the best episodes from the seventh season of Married… With Children!"
