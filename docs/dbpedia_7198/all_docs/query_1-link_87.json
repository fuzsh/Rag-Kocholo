        "text": "Psychiatric symptoms form the basis for the plot of this film in the CRIME DOCTOR series. A jumbled plot with a lot of unexplained twists concerns a WW II vet who comes to Baxter suffering from amnesia. The vet is murdered by two hoods who, in turn, are killed by a mysterious woman thought to be the sister of the vet's fiancee. Baxter finds out that it was the fiancee herself, suffering from a split personality, who became the killer sister and murdered the two hoods."
