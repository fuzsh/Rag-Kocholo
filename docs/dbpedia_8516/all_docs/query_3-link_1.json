        "text": "The Free State lies in the middle of South Africa. It borders six other provinces. North West, Gauteng, and Mpumalanga lie to the north, KwaZulu-Natal to the east, the Eastern Cape to the south, and the Northern Cape to the west. The mountain kingdom of Lesotho also borders the Free State to the east and south.\n\nThe largest part of the Free State is grassland. There are mountains in the east, along the border with Lesotho. The Vaal River forms part of the Free State’s northern boundary. The Orange River forms the southern boundary. South Africa’s largest dams are the Gariep and Vanderkloof dams. Both are on the Orange River in the Free State.\n\nBloemfontein is the largest city in the province. Other notable towns include Welkom, Botshabelo, Kroonstad, Virginia, Harrismith, Bethlehem, Sasolburg, Parys, Phuthaditjhaba, and Odendaalsrus.\n\nAgriculture\n\nThe Free State is known as the breadbasket of South Africa because of its grain production. The province provides significant crops of maize, wheat, and sorghum. Other important crops include sunflowers and various vegetables and fruits, including potatoes, asparagus, and cherries. Most of the country’s cherries are harvested in the Ficksburg area. Dairy and sheep farming also contribute to the economy.\n\nMining\n\nMines provide jobs for many people in the Free State. There are 12 gold mines in the province. They provide about 30 percent of South Africa’s gold and make the province one of the world’s largest gold producers. The Free State goldfields are in the districts of Odendaalsrus, Virginia, and Welkom.\n\nThe province’s gold mines also provide much of South Africa’s silver. In addition, the gold-mining process produces uranium. Other mineral resources in the Free State include diamonds, bentonite (a kind of clay), and coal.\n\nManufacturing\n\nSince 1989 the Free State has tried to make its economy less dependent on agriculture and mining. As part of this effort, manufacturing has expanded in the province. The chemical industry is very important. In Sasolburg, the Sasol company uses coal to make fuels, chemicals, and other products. Other manufactured products include food and beverages, textiles, and jewelry. A growing number of companies focus on high-technology manufacturing.\n\nTourism\n\nThe Free State’s main tourist area is Golden Gate Highlands National Park. It is in the foothills of the Maluti Mountains. The impressive Sentinel Rock rises above the park.\n\nThe Vredefort Dome is the world’s oldest and largest visible crater made by a meteorite. Two billion years ago a meteorite that was larger than Table Mountain, with a diameter of 6 miles (10 kilometers), hit an area near Vredefort and Parys. In 2005 the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) named this area a World Heritage site.\n\nThe Anglo-Boer War Museum and the National Women’s Monument are in Bloemfontein. The monument was designed by the sculptor Anton van Wouw in the early 1900s. It honors the thousands of Boer women and children who died in British concentration camps during the Anglo-Boer War. Emily Hobhouse, a British campaigner for human rights, was buried at the monument. She did much to improve conditions in the concentration camps.\n\nPeople have lived on the land that is now the Free State for many centuries. The earliest inhabitants were the San. Later, Bantu-speaking peoples such as the Tswana came to the area. In the early 1800s the Tswana were forced out by the Zulu, who were led by King Shaka. The Sotho and Griqua peoples took their place in the region. A leader named Moshoeshoe united numerous African peoples to form the Sotho kingdom. The Sotho capital was at Thaba Bosigo, which is now in western Lesotho.\n\nEuropeans first crossed the Orange River northward to enter the Free State area in the 1700s. In the early 1800s, as the Sotho arrived in the region, the Boers also began to settle there. More Boers came from the Cape Colony during the Great Trek of the 1830s and 1840s. The Boers fought the British for control of the territory. At the same time, the Sotho clashed with both the Boers and the British. In 1854 the British gave up the fight. The Boers made the territory into a republic named the Orange Free State.\n\nThe Orange Free State fought with Moshoeshoe and the Sotho kingdom. The battles were mainly disputes over land.\n\nIn 1868 the Sotho were conquered. The Boers took much of the Sotho land and added it to the Orange Free State. The reduced Sotho kingdom eventually became the independent country of Lesotho.\n\nWhen the Anglo-Boer War broke out in 1899, the Orange Free State joined with the South African Republic (ZAR) to fight against Britain. The ZAR was another Boer state. In 1902 the Boers lost the war. Both republics became British colonies. The name Orange Free State was changed to Orange River Colony.\n\nIn 1910 the colony became one of the provinces of the independent Union of South Africa. It was again called the Orange Free State. The province remained unchanged when the Union of South Africa became the Republic of South Africa in 1961. After apartheid ended in the early 1990s, the Orange Free State was renamed simply Free State."
