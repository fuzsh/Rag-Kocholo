        "text": "AMNESTY HEARINGS\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: Thank you Mr Chairman. For the purposesof the record I introduce myself, T V Matsepe of the same firmT V Matsepe and Company practising at Odendaalsrus. Mr ChairmanI just want to point out from the onset that I shall lead, indeedstart leading the evidence of Petros, but must also point outto the Committee that I have instructions to appear on behalfof five applicants. For the purposes of the convenience of thedeliberations I have opted to lead the evidence of all the fiveapplicants that I am appearing on behalf of, and then later onlead the evidence of any further witnesses which we might deemnecessary. The reason for this Mr Chairman is that the circumstancessurrounding the incidents relating to these applications are allto a great extent similar, and in that way we hope that we shallbe sparing a lot of time for the Commission.\n\nBefore I continue I would just like to confirm Mr Roland, MrChairman I am led to believe that before I lead the evidence ofthe first applicant Roland Petros it would be necessary for himto take the oath.\n\nROLAND PETROS: (sworn states)\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: Roland I would like you to feel completelyat ease. Is that in order?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: Before we start with your evidence Iwould like to know from you do you realise what the nature oftoday's proceedings is?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes I understand it.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: Do you also understand that this is nota court case in the sense that you are being tried, do you understandthat? Do you realise that this is not a trial in the sense thatyou are not standing there as an accused in a trial?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes I understand that.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: Do you also realise that you must bevery open with this Committee, for instance if you had appearedin court in a case arising from the same incident, you must justrealise that today's proceedings demands of you that you makea full disclosure of the facts?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes I understand.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: In other words you must not conceal orhide anything from the Commission.\n\nMR PETROS: Yes, no, absolutely.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: Firstly I would like you to tell theCommission where you were born and when you were born.\n\nYou may continue, where were you born?\n\nMR PETROS: I was born in Johannesburg, El dorado Park,in 28 Sand Street, 1969. I then moved to Ennerdale to CancerStreet, Ennerdale.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: You see there are people here in theaudience who would also like to hear what you have to say. Theyare very interested in your evidence and therefore I would liketo ask you could you please speak a little bit louder.\n\nMR PETROS: Right.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: Please explain to the committee whatyour links are with Kroonstad.\n\nMR PETROS: My father was born in Kroonstad, Mr PhilipPetros, and his entire family also born here, the entire Petrosfamily. I spent most of my early years in Kroonstad with membersof the Petros family. So a large part of my life I spent in Kroonstadrather in Johannesburg where I'd been born. It's a very largefamily the Petros family.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: Now did you visit Kroonstad regularlyduring the period in which this incident took place?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes, frequently, and also before the incidenttook place I visited Kroonstad regularly. I spent the majorityof my time here rather than in Johannesburg where I was born.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: Ja, could you just explain why that isso? Seeing that you were born in Johannesburg and your parentslived there why did you spend such a large part of your time inKroonstad?\n\nMR PETROS: Well the reason for that is because I wasinvolved in the ANC Youth League in Kroonstad and that's why Ispent a lot of time here.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: Were you a member of the ANC Youth League?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: What time were you a member of the ANCYouth League, even if you can just give us an approximate time,even if it's not a specific date?\n\nMR PETROS: From approximately 1980, I can't rememberexactly.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: Were you involved in the activities ofthe Youth League during 1991 and 1992?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes in some cases.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: Ja you were convicted in a matter arisingfrom the murder of George Ramasimong whose nickname was \"Diwiti\".\n\nMR PETROS: That's correct.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: And you were sentenced for this murder?\n\nMR PETROS: That is correct.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: I would like you to explain to the committeewhat you knew of this particular person before we get to the actualevent, what do you know about the deceased, how did you get toknow him?\n\nMR PETROS: I met the deceased in the community as a callous,cruel, merciless person, who terrorised the community day in andday out.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: And how did you become aware of this?\n\nMR PETROS: Well that was because of my involvement withthe ANC Youth League, and because I was often with Senator Bloemin his company.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: Now could you explain to the Committeewho Senator Bloem was at that stage?\n\nMR PETROS: Senator Bloem is one of my cousins, actuallymy father's cousin, in fact he's my uncle.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: Yes well apart from that ...(intervention)\n\nMR PETROS: Excuse me.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: Is there a family connection betweenthe two of you? Is there a family connection between yourselfand Senator Bloem?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes that's correct.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: Did he hold office within the ANC structureat the time?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes. He was the leader of the ANC in theMaokeng branch.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: Were any of your family members harmedby either the Three Million Gang and/or George Ramasimong himself?\n\nMR PETROS: I regard the whole community as my familyso the whole community have been terrorised by this person soI can say \"yes\" to that question.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: I know it that in the case you mentioneda certain person by the name of Philip, Philip Petros, do youknow him?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: Who is he?\n\nMR PETROS: That's my father.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: Philip Petros is your father?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: No the person who had been killed - MrChairman if you would allow me. You mentioned a person who'dbeen killed who was a member of your family?\n\nMR PETROS: That is Andrew Petros.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: You also mention a Simon Bloem here,could you tell us a little bit more about him?\n\nMR PETROS: Well Simon Bloem was killed in a most brutalmanner on the 14th of February 1992.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: Do you know how he had been killed?\n\nMR PETROS: No I don't know how he had been killed butI had heard that it happened at the taxi rank. He had been killedsomewhere there in cold blood by the Three Million gang.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: According to information which you hadobtained who was responsible for this murder?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes I was worried ...(intervention)\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: No, who had been responsible for themurder, according to what you had learnt?\n\nMR PETROS: Diwiti and the Three Million gang.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: How had he been killed?\n\nMR PETROS: He was killed in cold blood in a most cruelmanner.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: Well had he been shot or killed?\n\nMR PETROS: He had been butchered, he had been stabbed,he had been torn apart if one could actually call it that.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: Right. Before this murder with whichwe are concerned with here had there been any meetings to talkabout this problem the problem presented by the gang?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes, there had been many meetings regardingthis gang. Yes, there were many different meetings held to discussthe problem presented by this gang.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: Was a meeting held at which specificmention was made of the possibility of killing George Ramasimong?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes such a meeting was held.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: Could you give us some more details regardingthis meeting, where was it held?\n\nMR PETROS: It was held at Brent Park Stadium. I can'texactly remember who attended the meeting, everybody who attendedthe meeting, but in the meeting a request came from the communityto the self-protection unit to remove this George Ramasimong fromsociety because of the way he terrorised society in various cold-bloodedways.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: Right. Was it as a result of this meetingthat you acted in the way that you did?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes, yes there was an order from the communityto remove this person and this order was given at this particularmeeting.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: What did you decide to do?\n\nMR PETROS: The instruction wasn't aimed specificallyat myself, but specifically everybody, any member of the self-protectionunit who found this person could kill him.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: Your testimony is then that you weren'tspecifically approached and asked as an individual to kill thisperson?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: What appeared from the meeting was thatanybody who came into contact with this particular person couldkill him?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes that is correct.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: Right, I'd like to get to the actualday of the incident. What happened, what did you do on the dayof this particular incident? Let me put it this way perhaps tokeep my questioning brief, do you confirm your explanation ofplea tendered in the Supreme Court when you pleaded guilty tothe murder?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes that's correct.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: You then went to the taxi rank whereyou shot Diwiti dead?\n\nMR PETROS: That's correct.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: After this person's death is that correct?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: At the start of the court proceedingsyou pleaded not guilty?\n\nMR PETROS: That's correct.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: But later on you did plead guilty?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes, that's correct.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: Could you explain to the Committee whyyou decided to change your plea to one of guilty?\n\nMR PETROS: Initially they wanted me to plead guilty butthey wanted me to place all the blame on Senator Bloem so thathe could go to prison for the act which I had committed.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: I would just like to repeat my question,what I would like to know is initially you did not plead guilty?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: But later on you decided you were goingto change your plea, in other words you decided to admit thatyou had killed this person and that you had the intent to killhim?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes I am sorry I misunderstood the question.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: Why the change of plea?\n\nMR PETROS: Well I felt that I wanted to be entirely honestand truthful with the State.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: Do you know what happened after the deathof this person as regards the violence which took place in thevicinity, in the area?\n\nMR PETROS: Peace had been restored to the communities,it did take a little bit of time however. From the time of hisdeath until this time there has been peace in our community, theentire community can confirm that.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: How do you feel about the fact that youcommitted this act? How do you feel about that right now?\n\nMR PETROS: I feel very bad about it, I feel very sorryabout the fact that I committed this deed. I didn't want to commitit in the first place but because we had nobody else to protectus at that stage we had to protect ourselves and defend ourselves. This person should not have been dead today and I'm actuallyvery sorry that he is dead. But if the South African Police hadhelped us then this person would never have died. I am very sorrythat this person is dead because he was actually also an innocentperson who had been used by the SAP. For that reason I'd liketo say, perhaps if his mother and other members of his familyare present, I would like to say that I am very sorry and I'dlike to ask their forgiveness. I would want them to forgive meas God forgives us. I am sorry that I killed this person.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: In other words what you are telling theCommittee is that you are sorry that you had to be the personresponsible for executing the sentiments and demands of your society?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes the instructions came from the communityitself and was directed at us because we protected and defendedthe community.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: You say that George Ramasimong was usedby the then South African Police?\n\nMR PETROS: That is correct.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: Why do you say that?\n\nMR PETROS: I killed this person and I got 14 years imprisonmentfor this deed but this same person killed 102 people and thereis proof of that. But this person didn't even receive 14 secondsof imprisonment for his deeds.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: If it pleases you Mr Chairman I am justgoing through. I still think that this question has not beenclearly answered, do you have any information, whether personallyor information that has been given to you that led to the conclusionthat the South African Police at the time were colluding and conspiringwith the Three Million gang.\n\nMR PETROS: Yes, I am sorry I haven't yet fully answeredthe question. Evidence proves that this person was involved andcooperated with the South African Police in that he was neverarrested for any act committed by him. This person was transportedin SAP bakkies and so on, and dropped off in various areas ofthe community to terrorise them and he was present when the SAPkilled certain members of the community. Further evidence alsoshows that this person was given bail for each and every act thathe committed.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: Do you have any information regardingthe relationship between George Ramasimong and the then Prosecutor,Miss Pienaar, or Mrs Pienaar?\n\nMR PETROS: There was a time when we were looking forthis person to remove him from society and as a result of thathe received certain information and went and hid himself at MrsPienaar's home. As a result of this we knew that this personcolluded with the South African Police, because this person wentinto hiding at that particular place for his own safety and wecouldn't understand why he couldn't be kept in safe detentionat the police station.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: Do you also have information that MrsPienaar had confirmed this, in other words that the Prosecutorhad confirmed this fact and she did not deny that Ramasimong hadcome to her house to hide?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes she admitted that and confirmed that. She confirmed that she had done that and we have evidence tothat effect.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: Now these things, for instance the factthat there were allegations that police were conspiring with thegang, allegations that the police, that the leader of the gangsometimes went to sleep over at the home of the Prosecutor, whatfeelings did this evoke from yourself and the community? Yousee now you were given the information and you heard the allegationsregarding police conspiracy, allegations were made about the factthat certain people were charged but soon let out on bail andthere were allegations that the leader of the gang sought safetyat the Prosecutor's home and stayed there for a while, now inthe light of all this information which you had, how did you feel? What I would like to establish, and what I'd like you to explainto the Committee is after you saw these things happening or heardthat these things were happening, how did you feel, did you feelsafe and secure or did you feel threatened and afraid? What wenton in your mind at that time?\n\nMR PETROS: At that stage we felt that we are not safe.We felt that there was nobody to defend us and to protect us. We felt that there was no justice for us.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: Did you have any faith and confidencein the police?\n\nMR PETROS: No, none at all, I had no confidence in theprevious dispensation and system.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: Did you have any faith in the court procedure,did you feel that you could go to court and complain?\n\nMR PETROS: No, I trusted nobody. I trust nobody fromthe South African Police or any magistrate, State prosecutor becauseall these people seemed to collude with this \"Diwiti\"this deceased. So at that stage I didn't trust anybody.\n\nMR T V MATSEPE: So you are saying that you had not faithin the legal system under the police and it is therefore underthose circumstances that you took the decision to do what youin fact did?\n\nMR PETROS: It wasn't my decision, it was the community'sdecision in relation to the self-protection unit, because I wasthe person who found the deceased first I was the person who performedthis act.\n\nQUESTION: Yes Mr Chairman I do have questions, thankyou. Mr Petros you testified about the relationship between yourselfand Senator Bloem, do you remember that? Sorry? You testifiedabout you relationship with Senator Bloem?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes.\n\nQUESTION: Now I just want to know from you, how oftenwere you with Senator Bloem?\n\nMR PETROS: I was often with Senator Bloem, on and off. Most of the time I drove the car and he was a passenger in thecar with me.\n\nQUESTION: You testified that you were a member of theANC Youth, was he a leader or a combat in the ANC Youth League?\n\nMR PETROS: He was a leader of ANC as well, actually howcan I say, was involved in the activities of the ANC as well aswith the community. He was involved in the activities of theANC Youth League as well with the community. So I cannot explainto you was he a member of the Youth League, I can say yes he was,I can say no but you could say he was a member.\n\nQUESTION: Sorry Mr Petros you are by the way entitledto put on the earphones to get the Afrikaans translation.\n\nMR PETROS: Oh sure, sure.\n\nQUESTION: Did the ANC Youth League not have it's leader?\n\nMR PETROS: The ANC Youth did have its own leader, namelyPetros Machaba Ntulu.\n\nQUESTION: Now between Petros Machaba Ntulu and SenatorBloem to whom were you closely related, politically?\n\nMR PETROS: Both of them.\n\nQUESTION: Would you take an instruction from SenatorBloem, political instruction?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes.\n\nQUESTION: Would you equally take a political instructionfrom Ntulu Machaba?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes.\n\nQUESTION: Now for how long were you a member of the ANCYouth League before the date of committing this crime?\n\nMR PETROS: I joined in 1989 as a card-carrying member,but before that I had been involved in the ANC activities forquite a long time, youth activities. I grew up in ANC circlesand I was well acquainted with the activities. In other wordsbefore I joined in 1989 as a card-carrying member, even beforethat I had been involved in their youth activities.\n\nQUESTION: You are responding to my question I get theimpression that you were at a certain stage an honourary sympathiserof the ANC and later on you became a member, am I correct?\n\nMR PETROS: That's correct.\n\nQUESTION: What I want to know from you, for how longwere you a member of the ANC, before the commission of this crime,actual member?\n\nMR PETROS: Since 1989.\n\nQUESTION: You testified that an instruction was givenat the meeting that was held that the deceased is to be removedor perhaps to be eliminated?\n\nMR PETROS: That's correct.\n\nQUESTION: Now who gave that instruction or that command?\n\nMR PETROS: I can't remember exactly who gave the instructionbut what I can remember is that the instruction came from thecommunity at large.\n\nQUESTION: Mr Petros is it really possible that the wholecommunity gathered at a stadium or any other venue to give instructionsto other members of the community, was there no leader, a chairmanof that nature?\n\nMR PETROS: It had been reported to us that there wasa certain specific person but I can't remember his name.\n\nQUESTION: It was in any case a formal ANC meeting notso?\n\nMR PETROS: yes.\n\nQUESTION: Now who was chairing that meeting?\n\nMR PETROS: I can't remember exactly.\n\nQUESTION: Who opened the meeting?\n\nMR PETROS: I think, if I remember correctly, one Biza.\n\nQUESTION: Biza who?\n\nMR PETROS: At that stage we just used code names so Iknew most of the members just by their code names.\n\nQUESTION: So Biza was his code name?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes that was his code name.\n\nQUESTION: I am going to refer you to your supplementaryaffidavit, I know you don't have it but I'll read to you whatyou said and ask a question therefrom. Members of the Committeethat will be on page 3 of the handwritten supplementary affidavit,that will be page 27 according to indexing, page 27 the thirdparagraph. I will read this out to you because you don't haveit. You stated that,\n\n\"The gang ultimately took on a political character as wasevidenced by a submission made by the leader of the gang nameDiwiti George Ramasimong who was a complainant in a case heldat Kroonstad, when he admitted.....\"\n\nnow this is where my question comes,\n\n\"....when he admitted under cross-examination that he andthe gang had become members of the IFP in 1990 and that he hadinstructions to oppose the ANC\".\n\nDo you remember you said that in your affidavit?\n\nMR PETROS: I can't remember that very well because itwas a long time ago and at that stage my life was very confused.\n\nQUESTION: If you wish I can let the affidavit be shownto you so that you recollect what you said. With the Chairman'sindulgence.\n\nQUESTION: I want to know is it himself that confessesthis?\n\nQUESTION: Ja, according to that statement you said hesaid that in court, in the case wherein he was a complainant. This was the affidavit that was taken from you not very longago by your legal representative on a Saturday this year.\n\nMR PETROS: Oh yes, yes I was a bit confused, I beg yourpardon. I was a bit confused. That is correct, yes.\n\nQUESTION: Did you yourself have any information as towhat the accused said to the Court, his connection with the IFP?\n\nMR PETROS: We did not believe that this person was amember of the IFP I think he just wanted to hide behind the IFPbut as far as I am concerned he did say that, that he had beenappointed by the IFP to crush all opposition.\n\nQUESTION: Did he perhaps tell you further or did youknow as to who actually made them, the deceased and the gang,to oppose the ANC?\n\nMR PETROS: No, no, I don't know who gave them those instructionsbut I do know of what you have just mentioned. I don't know whogave them those instructions, but I do know that they were givensuch instructions or that he'd said that he was so instructed.\n\nQUESTION: Let's go back again to the issue of, the issuewhere the meeting was held, where you testified that \"I wasrequested by the community to kill the deceased\". I stillhave a bit of a problem there as to how was this order, if itwas an order or an instruction given.\n\nMR PETROS: The order was given by means of a messagefrom an informer. (The Interpreter requested the witness to pleasespeak up it is difficult to interpret).\n\nQUESTION: The order was given by an informer, is thatwhat you are saying? Who gave the order or instruction that thedeceased, Diwiti should be eliminated or killed?\n\nMR PETROS: As I said the community came to this conclusionitself and they decided to request us and the self-defence unitto eliminate this person and to remove him from society. We asthe self-protection unit were told by an informer that the communityhad taken this decision.\n\nQUESTION: Was SDU or wing or part of the ANC Youth League?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes it was the self-defence unit.\n\nQUESTION: Now was this meeting, was it a meeting of theANC Youth League or was it a meeting of the SDU's?\n\nMR PETROS: It was a meeting of the SDU.\n\nQUESTION: How many members of SDU were at that meeting?\n\nMR PETROS: I can't remember exactly.\n\nQUESTION: Mr Petros I want you to - sorry to interruptyou, what meeting are you referring to I just want to satisfymyself we are talking about one and the same meeting here? Whatmeeting are you referring to Mr Petros?\n\nMR PETROS: Sir may I ask which particular meeting itis that you want to know about. I just recall one meeting thatwe had, I can just recall one meeting in connection with this.\n\nQUESTION: The meeting is the meeting whereat a decisionwas taken that Diwiti must be killed, where you testified that,\"I had been requested by the community\".\n\nMR PETROS: Yes it is the same meeting that I am referringto.\n\nQUESTION: Now whose meeting was this?\n\nMR PETROS: It was a meeting of the self-defence unit.\n\nQUESTION: It was not a meeting of the community as awhole?\n\nMR PETROS: No.\n\nQUESTION: Now when you say it was not a meeting of thecommunity as a whole which part of the community was attendingthe meeting?\n\nMR PETROS: Earlier that afternoon there had been a meetingattended by the whole community, but as a result of feedback fromthat meeting this person was sent to us after we had had our meetingat a later stage, and this person was sent to us with the messagefrom the community's meeting which had taken place earlier thatday. I can't remember whether it was on the same day or the previousday.\n\nQUESTION: Mr Petros are you saying now on this particularday there were two separate meetings, one of the community andlater of the SDU's?\n\nMR PETROS: No, no I am not saying it's on the same daythat this took place, I am saying that I am not sure whether itwas the previous day that the community meeting took place oron the same day as our self-defence meeting.\n\nQUESTION: Did you attend the meeting of the community?\n\nMR PETROS: No.\n\nQUESTION: Did anything that was discussed in the meetingof the community was it ever taken over to the meeting of theSDU's.\n\nMR PETROS: Yes.\n\nQUESTION: Now who took that which came from the committeeto the SDU's, who made a report to you?\n\nMR PETROS: I can't remember exactly who brought thisinstruction to us. I think I arrived at the meeting five minuteslate. The meeting had already started.\n\nQUESTION: If you could speak a little bit louder, wehave got a problem with hearing.\n\nMR PETROS: I say I cannot remember who brought us theparticular instruction to our meeting because I arrived a bitlate at the meeting and the time that I arrived there the meetingwas already under way.\n\nQUESTION: But did you hear what was said in the SDU meetingfrom the community meeting, did you hear everything?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes. That the community was requesting usas self-defence unit to eliminate this person.\n\nQUESTION: Now where did you get the firearm from, theone which you used in killing Diwiti?\n\nMR PETROS: I got the firearm from Sergeant Jacobs. SergeantJacobs, I think he was stationed at Langlaagte Police Station. I obtained the firearm from him to complete my shooting lessonswhich (Side A of tape 1 ends). ...training.\n\nQUESTION: You had dealings with the police yourself?\n\nMR PETROS: No. This person loaned me the firearm. Atthat stage I was struggling to get my firearm licence so the firearmis given to me so that I could complete my training in order toobtain the licence.\n\nQUESTION: Is there any relationship between yourselfand this policeman who gave you the firearm?\n\nMR PETROS: No, no there was no relationship between thetwo of us. We just attended the same church at some stage andI know that he was a good person. At the stage when he gave methe firearm he did not know anything about the act which I wasplanning to commit with the firearm.\n\nQUESTION: But you've testified Mr Petros that you hadno confidence in the police because the police were assistingthe Three Million gang, how do you explain your getting a firearmfrom the very police you don't have confidence in?\n\nMR PETROS: This person lives in Johannesburg and he wasnot aware of circumstances in Kroonstad at that stage.\n\nQUESTION: Am I right then to understand you to be sayingthat when you say you do not have confidence in the police youare referring in particular to the Kroonstad police only?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes that is entirely correct.\n\nQUESTION: In your evidence when led you simply statedthat you killed the deceased at a taxi rank, could you tell usin detail how you did this, how you planned this, let us knowexactly what happened?\n\nMR PETROS: I walked up to this person, this person GeorgeRamasimong was with his gang. I think there were about 12 or15 of them I can't remember exactly, because they knew me I worea balaclava so they wouldn't identify me because if they had identifiedme and recognised me they would have attacked me and not the otherway round, so I was wearing this balaclava to stop them from recognisingmy face. The person walked to the taxi rank and walked througha passage, a little gate there, entered through the gate to thetaxi rank. I was walking in amongst the members of the ThreeMillion, I walked up to him, I took out the firearm, went up tohim and a couple of the gang members behind me shouted at him,he turned around, he looked in my direction, he saw me approachingwith a firearm and he tried to run away, I shot. various shotsat him and he ran round the combi's at the taxi rank and the fenceis quite high on the other side so he couldn't run away. So heactually cornered himself there, he turned around, he ran backtowards me, I ran towards him, I think I caused him to fall bykicking him on his chest, he tried to get up again whilst I wasstanding there, I knocked his feet out from under him so he felldown again, I then put my foot on his head and while he was lyingon the ground I shot him in the head. I turned around again,I was alone, there was nobody else there and I then went backto the car, I ran away in the direction of the car.\n\nQUESTION: Mr Petros you have testified and you said youare sorry for what you have done, you asked for forgiveness.\n\nMR PETROS: Yes.\n\nQUESTION: In killing the deceased Diwiti do you thinkthat measure was justified to take human life?\n\nMR PETROS: No it was not justified.\n\nQUESTION: Do you then agree with me that taking the circumstancesthat prevailed there, between yourself, that is your group andthe Three Million gang you went overboard by killing the deceased?\n\nMR PETROS: I never wanted to kill this man. It was neverour plan to kill him but we had no choice but to kill him becausethere was nobody who could protect us, nobody who could complainabout this man and to seek help against all his actions.\n\nQUESTION: No Mr Petros after killing this man was thereany political change in the area?\n\nMR PETROS: Since this man died, up until today, but notimmediately, I think it took a couple of months after his death,but up until today there's been a change in our society, thereis peace and stability. The community is here to verify that,what I have just said now.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you Mr Chairman. Petros I think thereis something that I think you must give a little bit more clarityto. Now I think you need to just clarify something for us, Iwill try and lead you, this meeting to which we have now referredto at such a meeting could you perhaps tell us how this particularkind of meeting proceeds? In other words is it a very formalkind of meeting or does it take place very informally?\n\nMR PETROS: It took place in a very informal way becauseat that stage it was easier for our enemies to kill us when wewere all gathered together like that so the meetings were veryinformal.\n\nQUESTION: Is it so that there was a secretary that tookdown the minutes?\n\nMR PETROS: No, that did not happen.\n\nQUESTION: And when people were given opportunities toask questions how did they do that? At these meetings when peoplewanted to make some kind of contribution or input or ask questionshow was it done, how did it happen?\n\nMR PETROS: He simply voiced his opinion and then we sawwhat kind of feedback we could give him.\n\nQUESTION: In other words a person could simply get upat the meeting and simply state what he had to say, he could simplysay no we can't continue with this, he must be killed, any individualcould do that?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes that's correct.\n\nQUESTION: How do you think - in other words support thatposition?\n\nMR PETROS: Everybody supported the same point of viewso all the people at the meeting were in favour of this view.\n\nQUESTION: How do you come to the conclusion that thatview was the general attitude and view of the people at the meeting,how did you become aware of that?\n\nMR PETROS: Could you repeat that?\n\nQUESTION: How would you at such a meeting, how wouldyou be able to determine that a view voiced by any particularperson was the view of the entire meeting? How could you be surethat an individual's view had the support of the entire meeting?\n\nMR PETROS: The command was directed at all of us.\n\nQUESTION: So it wasn't for instance the chairperson whowould say that this is the proposal and that's what we must do?\n\nMR PETROS: No, no, that's not how it happened. It wasn'tformal in a sense of a motion tabled and that a voting had totake place. That did not take place.\n\nQUESTION: In other words what you would like to tellus is that a view held by a particular person at the meeting,you all then had to agree with it, whether you actually agreedor not?\n\nMR PETROS: No the view was then negotiated and talkedabout until everybody understood it.\n\nQUESTION: Mr Petros I would like to clear up a few thingsin your evidence. You remember you filled in an application foramnesty?\n\nMR PETROS: That is correct.\n\nQUESTION: And you were asked in that form what crimeyou were seeking amnesty for, do you remember? You were asked...(intervention)\n\nMR PETROS: That's correct.\n\nQUESTION: And you were asked about your justificationsfor the act.\n\nMR PETROS: That's correct.\n\nQUESTION: And you were asked also, and I read from question11A,\n\n\"Was the act or offence committed in the execution of anorder or of or on behalf of or with the approval of the organisationconcerned\".\n\nAnd you said,\n\n\"Yes it was by the organisation African National Congress\".\n\nAnd you were then asked,\n\n\"If so state particulars of such order and the date thereofif known and the name and address of such person who gave suchorder or approval\".\n\nDo you remember you were asked that question?\n\nMR PETROS: That's correct.\n\nQUESTION: \"Answer\", that is the person whogave such order or approval you wrote down \"Mr Dennis VictorBloem, Brentpark, Kroonstad\".\n\nMR PETROS: That's correct.\n\nQUESTION: Did he give you the order?\n\nMR PETROS: No.\n\nQUESTION: Why did you put false information on your applicationform?\n\nMR PETROS: I did not say that - I put down the name ofthat person as the person who also was aware of what had happened. I did not thereby indicate that he had given me the order.\n\nQUESTION: The question that you answered was the personwho gave such order or approval, not anybody who was aware ofit, but that is your explanation is it?\n\nMR PETROS: Pardon?\n\nQUESTION: That is your explanation you don't want togive any other?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes.\n\nQUESTION: Right. Now you now talked about this meetingof the self- where you were told at the meeting of the self-defenceunit to remove the deceased, when was that meeting?\n\nMR PETROS: If I remember correctly the meeting took placeon a Sunday the 23rd of February 1992.\n\nQUESTION: And that was when the instruction was giventhat he must be removed?\n\nMR PETROS: Pardon?\n\nQUESTION: That is when he was given, you were given theinstruction to remove him, on Sunday 23rd of February, two daysbefore he was killed?\n\nMR PETROS: That's correct.\n\nQUESTION: Yes. Now reverting to why you mistrusted theorganisation you said that on one occasion the deceased went andstayed with a Mrs Pienaar, the Prosecutor?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes.\n\nQUESTION: When was that?\n\nMR PETROS: I can't remember exactly, but I think it wasduring 1990, if I remember correctly.\n\nQUESTION: 1990?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes 1990 or 1991, it happened on various occasions,it didn't only happen once, it happened several times, he wentthere quite often to Mrs Pienaar's home so I can't remember anexact date.\n\nQUESTION: You said, \"there was a time when we werelooking for the deceased to remove him and he received informationand went and stayed with Mrs Pienaar\", do you remember tellingus that in your evidence?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes.\n\nQUESTION: So you were trying to remove the deceased in1990 or 1991?\n\nMR PETROS: No, there was a time when a part of the self-defenceunit was looking for this person, not I personally. There wasa time when a section or some members of the self-defence unitwere looking for this person I think this was during 1991 or 1990,I can't remember exactly.\n\nQUESTION: To remove him?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes, that's correct.\n\nQUESTION: I take it the statement you made, the supplementaryaffidavit you say you were somewhat confused, that was writtenby your attorney was it? You were shown it, remember?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes, yes he just put it a little bit moreformally.\n\nQUESTION: He wrote it though?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes, that's correct.\n\nQUESTION: Did you return the firearm to Sergeant Jacobsafter you had killed deceased?\n\nMR PETROS: No. The State kept the firearm.\n\nQUESTION: Oh they found it did they?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes.\n\nQUESTION: And you've told us how you went up to the deceased,he was with 12 to 15 members of his gang and you didn't want themto recognise you so you pulled a balaclava down over your head?\n\nMR PETROS: That's correct.\n\nQUESTION: Didn't you think that would look very suspicious?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes it did look very suspicious but I can'tunderstand it how I actually managed to shoot him without hissupporters and gang members actually doing anything to me.\n\nQUESTION: And after you shot him you told us you werealone there?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes, just myself and the deceased at the taxirank.\n\nQUESTION: What happened to the 12 to 15 gang memberswho were there?\n\nMR PETROS: I really couldn't tell you, I think they ranaway perhaps to go and look for help.\n\nQUESTION: What had you been doing that day before youshot the deceased?\n\nMR PETROS: I can't remember exactly, I think I was justat home the whole morning.\n\nQUESTION: The day before?\n\nMR PETROS: On the previous day we went looking for thisperson to kill him.\n\nQUESTION: That's on the Sunday, the day on which you...(intervention)\n\nMR PETROS: That was a Monday.\n\nQUESTION: The previous day?\n\nMR PETROS: Ja, that was a Monday, ja.\n\nQUESTION: Were you living in Kroonstad then?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes.\n\nQUESTION: How long had you been there?\n\nMR PETROS: I had been in Kroonstad, well, I stayed inKroonstad during the week and on weekends I went to Johannesburg,so on the weekend before this I went to Ennerdale so I remainedbehind for two days in Ennerdale so I think it was about on theWednesday that I came from Ennerdale to Kroonstad.\n\nQUESTION: So you made a statement at your trial in termsof section 112 of the Criminal Procedure Act, do you rememberthat?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes.\n\nQUESTION: In which you said,\n\n\"On Thursday the 20th of February I came to Brentpark,Kroonstad, to attend the funerals of two of my uncles, Simon Bloemand Abyssinia Buthelezi\".\n\nMR PETROS: That's correct.\n\nQUESTION: \"During the vigil I learnt that Simon Bloemhad been killed by members of the Three Million gang\".\n\nMR PETROS: Yes.\n\nQUESTION: \"I also learnt that certain other of myrelatives had been assaulted and raped by members of the ThreeMillion gang\".\n\nMR PETROS: That's correct.\n\nQUESTION: \"I was upset at hearing of these eventsand seeing the effect they were having on my relatives in Kroonstad....\"\n\nall this is what you learnt when you were at the vigil at thefuneral, but you tell us you had been living at Kroonstad thewhole time, how is it you hadn't heard of it before the funeral?\n\nMR PETROS: That is correct. I had already heard allof this whilst I was still in Ennerdale but it was just that itwas far more emphasised at the funeral and the vigils.\n\nQUESTION: Oh you heard it at Ennerdale?\n\nMR PETROS: That's correct.\n\nQUESTION: You then go on to say,\n\n\"I drank alcohol excessively over the weekend and on Mondaythe 24th as well as on the 25th of February\".\n\nMR PETROS: That's correct.\n\nQUESTION: Is that true?\n\nMR PETROS: That is true.\n\nQUESTION: So you weren't hunting this man, you were drinkingalcohol to excess on those days.\n\nMR PETROS: No. No, I was not abusing alcohol I used alcoholfor my nerves.\n\nQUESTION: \"You said I drank alcohol excessively\",do you remember saying that?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes but I can't remember exactly how muchbut I used alcohol to stabilise myself because I was looking fora person to kill him and it was him or me and that was the reasonwhy I used alcohol.\n\nQUESTION: Because you went on to say,\n\n\"After 4pm on the 25th of February I was transported toKroonstad town in a motor vehicle driven by Daniel Hankan(?) toascertain the fares payable and the times at which taxis wouldbe available from Kroonstad to Ennerdale\".\n\ndo you remember saying that?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes that's correct.\n\nQUESTION: So you went there to find out about catchinga taxi to Ennerdale.\n\n\"This was done at the behest of my uncle Dennis Bloem whois accused no.1 of this matter\".\n\nMR PETROS: That's correct.\n\nQUESTION: And then you say, you went on to say that,\n\n\"After you alighted from the taxi you saw deceased\".\n\nMR PETROS: Not that I can recall, after I got out ofthe taxi?\n\nQUESTION: Yes.\n\nMR PETROS: From which taxi is this now?\n\nQUESTION: Sorry, sorry, not taxi the vehicle, after yougot out the vehicle.\n\nMR PETROS: Yes.\n\nQUESTION: And Dennis Victor Bloem also made a statementdidn't he?\n\nMR PETROS: I am listening, yes.\n\nQUESTION: He told you to go home on the afternoon ofthe 25th of February.\n\nMR PETROS: Yes.\n\nQUESTION: And was very cross with you because you hadspent the money he had given you on drink. Do you remember that?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes.\n\nQUESTION: And he then sent you off to the taxi rank tofind out how much it cost to send you home.\n\nMR PETROS: Yes.\n\nQUESTION: And that's what you were doing at the taxirank.\n\nMR PETROS: Yes.\n\nQUESTION: Mr Petros you will remember from the beginningI told you that today is the day when you should play open cards?\n\nMR PETROS: Yes.\n\nQUESTION: Where I read you documents pertaining to theprevious file and where at the time you did not tell the truth,what you said was not the truth, and if you still feel that whatyou said it was not the truth, that means you must now say soand say what I said previously was not the truth, today the truthis this, do you understand that?\n\nMR PETROS: That which the Judge read now was a statementwhich I made in the past which - that was not the truth, thatwhich the Judge has just read. That was all fabrication. Whatactually happened was that on that day we went out looking forthis man to kill him. There were no taxis, we were not lookingfor taxis and trying to get me onto a taxi or anything like that. There is no question of me taking a taxi to Ennerdale, we simplywent there on that day to kill him. So that statement which hadbeen read out was a total fabrication.\n\nQUESTION: That was the statement you made when you changedyour plea and pleaded guilty and said to us here today that youwanted to be entirely honest and truthful with the State and thatstatement was confirmed by your uncle. Are you now saying youwere lying when you said you wanted to be honest and truthfulwith the State in your evidence today?\n\nMR PETROS: The State itself wasn't honest with me sohow can I be honest with the State?\n\nQUESTION: Anyway my question, the question I am askingyou is that what you said in the statement to the Court was thatthe truth, that's what I am asking you, the version relating tothe taxi rank, that is what I am asking you?\n\nMR PETROS: That is not the truth.\n\nQUESTION: Tell me Mr Petros I don't know this place andcertainly members of the committee don't know this place, thisThree Million gang what is it, or what was it?\n\nMR PETROS: The Three Million gang was a group of membersof the community who terrorised the community.\n\nQUESTION: Do you perhaps know why they were called ThreeMillion?\n\nR PETROS: No I don't, I don't know why they were calledthe Three Million Gang.\n\nQUESTION: And you told us that you used time and againto come and visit Kroonstad, although you did not live here, whatwas the political situation like here in Kroonstad during thattime?\n\nR PETROS: It was very tense, the political situationwas extremely tense. Too many things happened. The situationwas really quite disorderly.\n\nQUESTION: From your evidence I would imagine that therewas in fact a branch of the ANC Youth League in this area?\n\nR PETROS: In which area?\n\nQUESTION: In this area, Maokeng or Kroonstad area?\n\nR PETROS: Yes that is correct.\n\nQUESTION: And did the Youth function freely without anyproblems?\n\nR PETROS: No.\n\nQUESTION: No what, did it have problems? What sort ofproblems did the ANC Youth League have?\n\nR PETROS: There were always problems with the Three MillionGang. We could never march in peace or anything like that becausewherever the Youth met and gathered the Three Million Gang wasalso present to harass us and to terrorise us and to fight withus. There was never any peace in the whole of Maokeng.\n\nQUESTION: Just for the record tell us a little bit forabout this SDU, what was it?\n\nR PETROS: The SDU was the self-defence unit of the YouthLeague. I think it had three different branches and it had threedifferent names, I can't remember exactly, I think one was Slovosomething, the SDU was a body formed by the Youth League to protectand defend society.\n\nQUESTION: Was it an affiliate of the ANC Youth League?\n\nR PETROS: Yes it was affiliated with the Youth Leaguebecause some of the members of the Youth League were also membersof the self-defence unit.\n\nQUESTION: Well you said that the deceased had killeda number of people, I don't know you said something like 140 orI misheard.\n\nR PETROS: 102 that's what I said.\n\nQUESTION: Well 102 is a big number, I am not goingto ask you to enumerate 102 names we would sit here the wholeafternoon but can you mention a few names if you still remember? Or let me put it to you this way among the people killed werethere people that you considered as leaders?\n\nR PETROS: Yes some of these people I did regard as leadersand exemplary residents of the community.\n\nQUESTION: Just mention a few names of the people whowere killed, who you think were killed by this gang and who youregarded as leaders in this area.\n\nR PETROS: No I can't remember any of the names.\n\nQUESTION: You don't remember the names?\n\nR PETROS: No.\n\nQUESTION: And what do you mean by saying that there wasnobody to defend you, can you just elaborate on that?\n\nR PETROS: We often went to the South African Police andpleaded with them to help us to solve this problem, the problemof the gang and the more we went to them to ask for help the worsethings became.\n\nQUESTION: You were asked by Advocate ...(indistinct)to whether you thought the killing of the deceased was justifiedand your answer was - well do you remember what your answer was?\n\nR PETROS: I said no, it was not justified because I didnot want to take the law into my own hands and because I haverespect for human life.\n\nQUESTION: Was it necessary to kill him?\n\nR PETROS: It wasn't necessary to kill him but if theSouth African Police had done their job properly it would neverhave been necessary.\n\nQUESTION: Sorry to question you again, reverting to yourlast answer that if the police had done their job it would nothave been necessary to kill the deceased, you remember in yoursupplementary affidavit which you wrote last month you said, andI am reading to you from it,\n\n\"On the 25th of February 1992 I armed myself with a firearmand followed him (that is the deceased) to the Kroonstad taxirank as he was coming from court where he had appeared on chargesand murder and attempted murder of ANC members\".\n\ndo you remember saying that in your affidavit?\n\nR PETROS: Yes.\n\nQUESTION: So he was being charged with the offences ofmurder and attempted murder and facing those charges at the timeyou killed him, is that so?\n\nR PETROS: No, he hadn't been charged with murder, hewas accompanying his gang who was attending court in connectionwith the murder case. It was not himself who had been charged.\n\nQUESTION: Well why did you say this in your affidavit,your attorney prepared it for you, he read it over to you, youswore to it?\n\nR PETROS: Maybe I speak Afrikaans, my attorney speaksEnglish, maybe there was some language confusion.\n\nQUESTION: How many people were charged with the deathof the deceased besides yourself?\n\nR PETROS: Four, four people.\n\nQUESTION: What happened to them?\n\nR PETROS: One was killed, the State withdrew the caseagainst one of them, one became State witness and the one wassentenced with me.\n\nQUESTION: To your knowledge is this gang the Three MillionGang no longer in existence or is it still in existence?\n\nR PETROS: I don't know whether they still exist or notbut if they were still in existence there would be no peace inthis community.\n\nQUESTION: You were a member of the self-defence unitwere you?\n\nR PETROS: That's right.\n\nQUESTION: Was the self-defence unit itself also an informalorganisation or was it a formal, properly constituted organisation?\n\nR PETROS: It was a properly constituted body formed aspart of the Youth League.\n\nQUESTION: So you were a member of the self-defence unitand the ANC Youth League?\n\nR PETROS: They were almost one and the same thing, theself-defence unit was slightly separate because some of the peoplewho belonged to the defence unit also belonged to the Youth League,they were more-or-less the same thing.\n\nQUESTION: The deceased was not a member of any politicalorganisation was he?\n\nR PETROS: As I said this person had made a statementthat he was a member of the IFP, that's all I know. But accordingto how I saw it that was just a smokescreen really. I don't reallybelieve he was a member of the IFP.\n\nQUESTION: Mr Petros it seems to me that there is someconfusion about the two meetings which apparently took place. If I understand your evidence correctly the whole community ora large part of the community attended a meeting at which certaindecisions were taken, right, and later whether on the same dayor on the next day there was a meeting of the self-defence unit.\n\nR PETROS: That is correct.\n\nQUESTION: Did you attend both of these meetings or onlyone of them or neither?\n\nR PETROS: I only attended one.\n\nQUESTION: Which one did you attend?\n\nR PETROS: The meeting of the self-defence unit.\n\nQUESTION: So you don't know what decisions were takenat the other meeting except as far as you were informed by theparticular informer?\n\nR PETROS: That's right.\n\nQUESTION: And you also don't know who the person waswho conveyed this information because you arrived late at theself-defence unit's meeting?\n\nR PETROS: That's correct.\n\nQUESTION: So when you arrived at the meeting, the meetingof the self-defence unit, the discussion had already been disposedof or what exactly happened?\n\nR PETROS: It was more-or-less towards the end of the meetingthat I arrived there.\n\nQUESTION: And you said that you got the firearm froma Sergeant Jacobs?\n\nR PETROS: That is correct.\n\nQUESTION: Were you friends, you great friends with him?\n\nR PETROS: Yes, yes.\n\nQUESTION: And did you ever discuss these problems withhim, namely the fact that the police in Kroonstad were not attendingto the community's complaints and grievances?\n\nR PETROS: No, never.\n\nQUESTION: But you had full confidence in this man?\n\nR PETROS: Yes as he also had confidence in me.\n\nQUESTION: Would it not perhaps have helped if you hadspoken to him about this matter?\n\nR PETROS: No.\n\nQUESTION: Mr Petros in your evidence you've stated thatyou had lost confidence in the police and you had lost confidencein the legal system itself and this is what led the communityto take its decision on the 23rd of February 1992, is that correct?\n\nR PETROS: That's correct.\n\nQUESTION: Now are you able to enlighten this committeeas to what attempts had been made by the community at large toconvey its problems which it had with the Three Million Gang tothe police in Maokeng?\n\nR PETROS: We wrote letters to the then Minister of Lawand Order Adrian Vlok to try and address this problem but nothingcame of it. If I remember correctly there was a Captain Duriesent here to try and solve the problems, the problem was onlysolved temporarily because he was then transferred if my memoryserves me correctly. The offices in the South African Policehere in Kroonstad even, the General in the Free State vicinity,they were approached regarding the situation here but absolutelynothing was done to solve the problem.\n\nQUESTION: Now the Captain that you have mentioned CaptainDurie, who sent him? Are you aware?\n\nR PETROS: I am not sure who sent him here.\n\nQUESTION: When did the Three Million Gang come into existenceMr Petros?\n\nR PETROS: I can't remember exactly, I think it was in1990, or maybe 1989, I am not sure.\n\nQUESTION: You have stated in your supplementary affidavitthat initially the Gang committed pure criminal acts, that theGang ultimately took on a political character, do you recall makingthat statement in ...(intervention)\n\nR PETROS: That's correct.\n\nQUESTION: Now what was this political character it assumed? What was it doing for it to assume a political character fromthat of being purely a criminal gang?\n\nR PETROS: I am sorry could you repeat the question itwas quite a long question?\n\nQUESTION: Let me make it simpler. In your supplementaryaffidavits you've stated that when the Three Million Gang startedit started as purely a criminal gang but that later on it tookon a political character, I just want to know on what made youto conclude that it had taken a political character?\n\nR PETROS: These persons claimed that they were supportersof the IFP and they wore red pieces of cloth around their necks.\n\nThank you, Mr Chairman. The applicant now on the stand is tobe cross-examined today. May I ask that he retakes the oath.\n\nMR H G THULU: Still under oath\n\nMR MPSHE: Yesterday you testified that in the year 1990you were the organiser of the Youth League and you were electedthe General Commander of the SDUs, is it correct?\n\nMR THULU: Correct, sir.\n\nMR MPSHE: Will I then be correct to state that all actionsor activities taken by the SDUs were taken as a result of yourcommands?\n\nMR THULU: Indeed.\n\nMR MPSHE: Petros testified yesterday as to how he killedDuvidi. Do you know as to who gave him that instruction?\n\nMR THULU: By that time I was already in prison.\n\nMR MPSHE: You don't have any idea as to how did he getthe command to kill?\n\nMR THULU: Actually I never gave them an individual command,it was a general command from the onset. I commanded them todefend the community in all the way they can.\n\nMR MPSHE: Were you aware of a meeting that took placeon the 23rd January 1992?\n\nMR THULU: I wasn't aware, but we usually held such meetings. I was informed about the meeting.\n\nMR MPSHE: Just to be fair to you. It is a meeting testifiedto by Petros where the community was involved where a decisionwas taken. Did you know about that one?\n\nMR THULU: I heard about that after.\n\nMR MPSHE: Were you told as to who chaired the meeting?\n\nMR THULU: No.\n\nMR MPSHE: Do you know as to who was responsible forthe meeting?\n\nMR THULU What I knew is that in such meeting only the(inaudible) members were allowed to enter, so my (inaudible) thatthey were members of the SDUs whom I knew.\n\nMR MPSHE: Do you know anything about the so-called TMK?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nMR MPSHE: What is it in full?\n\nMR THULU: In Afrikaans it is TIEN MANNEKRAG. In our language,cadres, it is TALENTED MEMBERS OF UMKHONTO we SIZWE.\n\nMR MPSHE: Was this an existing ANC wing or organisation?\n\nMR THULU: It was a defending structure actually. Itwas not an ANC structure, but there were people who took initiativeswho proposed the structure must be opened, those who were there,some of them were the members of ANC, the leaders.\n\nMR MPSHE: When was this TMK formed?\n\nMR THULU: Between October month and November 1990.\n\nMR MPSHE: Formed by whom?\n\nMR THULU: I was the one who formed it, organised theyouth to join the SDUs.\n\nMR MPSHE: Did the TMK have any connection or relationwith the known Umkhonto we Sizwe?\n\nMR THULU: Actually, no.\n\nMR MPSHE: Now you testified that George Ramasimong,Duvidi, was previously a member of the Youth League.\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nMR MPSHE: I want to believe then that if he was a memberof the Youth League previously you were in a position that youcan talk to him and enter into some form of negotiations withhim.\n\nMR THULU: Exactly.\n\nMR MPSHE: Now don't you think it would have been better,instead of him being murdered, that negotiations be entered intothrough yourself because you were in good contact with him?\n\nMR THULU: I knew that very well and I tried it on countlessoccasions, but it failed.\n\nMR MPSHE: What attempts did you do?\n\nMR THULU: We once went to a small police station in\n\nGelukwaarts to go and settle up there the dispute, then we proposeda meeting, a peace meeting which will be held at the Roman CatholicChurch here in Constantia, but at a later stage, maybe after anhour, we hear that they have killed one of the comrades in Pumulang(indistinct), and then by that time the members of the SDUs were(witness speaking indistinctly) they didn't want to listen tome because they were angry. These people this side they are talkingabout the peace and reconciliation while the other side they arekilling the people.\n\nMR MPSHE: So negotiations stopped on that day betweenyourself and Duvidi.\n\nMR THULU: Yes, Sir.\n\nMR MPSHE: Was there any other attempt made by yourself?\n\nMR THULU: Yes. I once again tried to talk to him incourt at town and then he never wanted to listen to me.\n\nMR MPSHE: You testified about a bus that ferried peoplewho had red bands on and were armed to the teeth. Do you knowthe ownership of the bus?\n\nMR THULU: No, I don't know the ownership of the bus.\n\nMR MPSHE: What bus was it? Where did it come from?\n\nMR THULU: They used to transport the people locallyhere, from here to job and in town. It is public transport actually.\n\nMR MPSHE: Oh, it is public transport owned.\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nMR MPSHE: Which company is that?\n\nMR THULU: I don't know the company. I knew the firstcompany which was Greyhound and then by the time I came out ofprison, Greyhound was no more there and then the very same buseswere non-existent.\n\nMR MPSHE: Would you say the same bus company is stilloperating in the area?\n\nMR THULU: I don't know, because I've got a long timein prison.\n\nMR MPSHE: Do you know anything about an intended settlementor negotiation which was led by the local ministers of religion(inaudible)?\n\nMR THULU: Yes, that I recall because the one who ledthe delegation was Rev Kosongo(?)\n\nMR MPSHE: And how did that happen? Could you just explainto the committee?\n\nMR THULU: Pardon?\n\nMR MPSHE: Could you just explain to the committee howdid this happen, who was involved and why was it done?\n\nMR THULU: The person I remember who was there was MrKosongo and I can't remember the others, but their intention wasto go there because there were people who could (inaudible) otherpeople as religious people.\n\nMR MPSHE: How many ministers of religion, if you canrecall, all in all were there? Just an estimate?\n\nMR THULU: Estimation is plus five or six.\n\nMR MPSHE: And where did they attempt to enter into negotiations? Where was the venue and who was there?\n\nMR THULU: They used to go to the Presbyterian Churchwhere Mr Kosongo was the reverend.\n\nMR MPSHE: And were the members of the 3 million alsopresent?\n\nMR THULU: They came once and the youth lost control. Senator Bloem managed to let them escape because the youth wasnow out of control. And the intention of the meeting was actuallyto bring peace back. Because the community at that time was soangry.\n\nMR MPSHE: In trying to resolve this amicably, did youmake any attempts to contact the ANC head office to come to yourassistance?\n\nMR THULU: Yes, we did make attempts.\n\nMR MPSHE: When was this done?\n\nMR THULU: I cannot remember the days specifically, butI remember that it was between October month and December wherebywe indicated to them. I even got information that some of the3 million members were in hiding. It was at about two o'clockand I took them to the camps. I took those children to SenatorBloem at about two o'clock and then he took them to Shell House.\n\nCHAIRMAN: What children are we talking about now?\n\nMR THULU: These were the members of the 3 million.\n\nCHAIRMAN: You refer to them as children.\n\nMR THULU: No, not (inaudible) children. I am referringthis to - I once caught two young children who were the membersof the gang and then the other members of the SDUs tried to killthem but I deny them and then took the children to Mr Bloem'sresidence and then he took them to Shell House.\n\nJUDGE WILSON: How old were these two children?\n\nMR THULU: Between 16 and 18 years.\n\nJUDGE WILSON: And what did the other people want to doto them?\n\nMR THULU: They wanted to kill them.\n\nJUDGE WILSON: Was that the members of your self-defenceunion? Or who wanted to kill them?\n\nMR THULU: The members of Premier. They were sittingin one place to defend their area there. So I caught those childrennear their camp.\n\nJUDGE WILSON: Who wanted to kill them?\n\nMR THULU: The workers of Premier.\n\nJUDGE WILSON: The workers of Premier Milling wanted tokill two children?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nMS KHAMPEPE: Mr Thulu, are you still referring to theincident which happened October and December?]\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nMR MPSHE: Did you personally accompany these childrento Shell House in Johannesburg?\n\nMR THULU: No.\n\nMR MPSHE: So you won't know who assisted them in ShellHouse?\n\nMR THULU: No, I don't know. What I knew is that theywent with Comrade Dennis Bloem to Johannesburg.\n\nMR MPSHE: Dennis Bloem took them to Shell House.\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nMR MPSHE: Now you testified about the men or employeesof Premier Milling Company. How did they get involved?\n\nMR THULU: These are the people who resisted everything\n\nthat was done by the 3 million gang, more than the community ofMaokeng.\n\nMR MPSHE: The death of Masusu(?) caused by yourself,did you thereby achieve anything?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nMR MPSHE: What?\n\nMR THULU: Peace and stability.\n\nMR MPSHE: Are you telling the committee that becauseof this one man, Masusu, there couldn't be peace and stability?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nMR MPSHE: In what way was he stopping it alone?\n\nMR THULU: As I have already said yesterday, he was alsothe spinal cord of 3 million. When you are a leader of an organisationthat is troubling the community, as soon as you fall down we assumethat the pillar has been destroyed and the members of his gangwould not attack back as they used to attack.\n\nMR MPSHE: But the leader was George Ramasimong and notMasusu, that was the pillar of the 3 million gang.\n\nMR THULU: He was also the leader.\n\nMR MPSHE: You testified yesterday about your connectionwith Masusu and the fact that he was your idol for what he didin soccer, you remember that?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nQUESTION: Now that gives me the impression you were ingood terms, you can talk to him, as you once referred to him as\"Groot man\", not so?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nMR MPSHE: Don't you think it would have been advisableor even better instead of shooting him, as you did, to talk tohim as your \"Groot man\" and try to reason things outwith him?\n\nMR THULU: I tried, as I said. Whenever I talked toDuvidi he was near Duvidi. They were close friend and they werealways together.\n\nMR MPSHE: Yes, but did you ever take any attempts -look, I don't think he was sleeping with George Ramasimong. Atall times you would go to his place. Did you take such pains?\n\nMR THULU: What I can tell you, he was a person who usedto terrorise the community and they used to stay together in oneplace. You'd never see him alone. They'd be together at alltimes.\n\nMR MPSHE: When you shot him, that is Masusu, as you did,was he in any way armed with a weapon?\n\nMR THULU: Yes, he was armed, he had a knife, a self-madeknife.\n\nMR MPSHE: And yourself and other members of SDUs usedthe guns.\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nMR MPSHE: Do you find it having been necessary to useguns on him when he only had a knife? Couldn't he be disarmed?\n\nMR THULU: I beg yours?\n\nMR MPSHE: Couldn't he have been disarmed?\n\nMR THULU: No, there was no other way to disarm him. (inaudible) you cannot disarm someone, you just have to defendyourself so that you mustn't lose your life.\n\nJUDGE WILSON: Do you say you were acting in self-defence?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nMR MPSHE: But if Mr Thulu, if I remember well, you testified that you shot him on the back first.\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nMR MPSHE: Which tells me that he was facing anotherdirection other than yourself.\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nMR MPSHE: Where were you defending yourself there, becausehe was not even facing you?\n\nMR THULU: I want to explain how I defended myself. I have already told the committee that our intention was not togo and search for him, but we had to do what I did because wewere now in their base. You get so nervous and you think thathe is not the only person there. Even the people who are runningaway, you get so disturbed that you think they are attacking youand then you'd attack back so that you get out of that place safe. (APPLAUSE)\n\nMR MPSHE: At that time when you were attacking him asyou did, did you have it in mind that you were acting on behalfof the ANC?\n\nMR THULU: Yes, because I was defending the people whowere the members of the ANC and my community.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Mr Thulu, the Act in terms of which youhave made an application for amnesty, says that a person may begranted amnesty provided certain requirements are met. And itis this requirement which your application must meet. One ofthe requirements is that the Act, or in your case, the offencein respect of which you have been convicted must be associatedwith a political objective. Do you understand what I am saying?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Now what is the political objective whichyou were seeking to achieve when you killed this man?\n\nMR THULU: The objective for the reason that made meis that these people of the 3 million were terminating(?) AfricanNational Congress, and I was aware that because of our organisationbeing unbanned ....\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Just start all over again. We couldn'thear your answer. You were answering my question to tell us whatpolitical objective was being served by or was being achievedby killing this person?\n\nMR THULU: The political objective that I achieved, thatI achieved, was the voice - I saw that the people have voted forthe ANC during the elections, and that was the objective thatwe got.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: No, I mean at the time when you killedhim, what political objective were you trying to pursue, at thetime when you killed him?\n\nMR THULU: It was to protect the community and the membersof the ANC and I managed to get that.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: I don't understand. In which way exactly?\n\nMR THULU: I want to broaden this.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Just tell me what the political objective- the exact political objective that you were trying to achieve? The whole purpose of us assembling here is, I must tell you,is to try and find out what political purpose the killing of thisperson was going to serve. It will not help your applicationmerely to say that this man was a rapist, he killed 102 peopleand the like. The law does not say that if somebody kills 100people you must kill him. That is not what the law says. Inyour case, for your application to succeed, you must tell us whatthe political objective, exactly what political objective wereyou trying to promote in killing him?\n\nMR THULU: My political objective was to see to it thatmy organisation is not being terminated by the gangster, thatis being perpetrated by the former government which is NationalParty and its forces.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Your political organisation being?\n\nMR THULU: ANC.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Was this man a threat to the continuedexistence of the ANC?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: In which way?\n\nMR THULU: We used to have mass campaigns. We used toprotest against the law, we used to protest against the council,making peaceful rainbow cause and whatsoever, and these peoplewho had been used to threaten the community so that the communitycan come and pay their rent forcibly and the Mayor, Osmond Sikwekwe(?)at the time and then he was told that if they don't pay they wouldbe evicted. (APPLAUSE)\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Please don't, like we asked you yesterday,please don't do that because you are not really helping his case. When we decide whether or not to give this amnesty, we are notgoing to count how many times you clapped hands for him. Please,give him the chance to explain his case properly so that he canget the chance to apply for his amnesty properly. We are notgoing to be influenced by whether or not you clapped hands. Youare just really spoiling his case, please.\n\nNow Mr Thulu, I am going to take you step by step and you mustlisten very carefully and answer the question as it comes. Ifyou don't understand it you must tell me. Was there any occasionduring which these - or first let me say. Who are these peoplethat the Mayor said or the councillor said he would send to forcepeople to come and pay rent? Is it the 3 million gang?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Is there any occasion when in fact theydid threaten people to go and force them into doing anything?\n\nMR THULU: Yes, it was just rumoured but after he hasconveyed the message we made it a point that they don't threatenthe people as he mentioned because we wanted the community tobe what we want it to be.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: You have said that on occasions you heldsome protest marches. That is, I assume it to be members of theANC, am I right?\n\nMR THULU: Yes, Sir.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Was there any occasion during which membersof the 3 million gang interfered with your protest marches, inthe form of trying to disrupt them or to make them fail?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Tell me more about it.\n\nMR THULU: During that time when everything was happening,there was a march organised to the councillors' offices. Thecommunity of Maokeng was complaining about the arrears, that theydo not even know about the high payments of the electricity, asif they were operating factories. As we were organising the peopleat the shopping centres, members of the 3 million gang came. They attacked the people, the people dispersed. We had to organisethe people back to the\n\nshopping centre.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Any other occasion that you can remember?\n\nMR THULU: That is the only one I remember, Sir.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Is there any other way in which membersof the 3 million gang interfered with the affairs of the ANC orany political organisation?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: In which way?\n\nMR THULU: There was a time when a consumer boycott wasconducted, and we have been preaching to the people the importanceof consumer boycott. Those who had businesses, we wanted themto gain. We tried to talk to the councillors to tell them thatthe monies that we have to pay are so heavy - we made door-to-doorcampaign. And those people, the members, got into the streetsand our members were threatened, they couldn't continue with thedoor-to-door campaign. They were told to stop their message.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Did that kind of conduct on the part ofthe 3 million gang have a negative effect on the campaign forthis consumer boycott?\n\nMR THULU: Yes, because the community of Maokeng wasso threatened. If you went into a house as a family you knowto explain to them what was happening, they will say to you itdoesn't help for you to come and tell us. We know that we haveto be part of this, but tomorrow when we come back 3 million gangis going to kill us saying that we have been involved in the marchtogether with the members of the ANC.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: I don't know if you would be able to havean answer to this question, but in so interfering with the activitiesof the organisation, what did the 3 million gang actually standto gain?\n\nMR THULU: They wanted to terminate ANC.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Did you think there would be any benefitto them by having the ANC terminated?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: What benefit do you think would be there?\n\nMR THULU: The Council would carry on letting the peoplepay very high rates on top of the threats that the community hadalready received.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: When you speak of the Council, are youreferring to the Maokeng Town Council?\n\nMR THULU: Maokeng Town Councils, the former one.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: It is fairly known throughout the countrythat there was a time when there were Town Councils and Mayorswhich were rejected by the majority of the black people throughoutthe country. Is the Council that you are referring to that kindof Council?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Where did the revenue for the Council comefrom? Do you know?\n\nMR THULU: Can you please repeat your question?\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: For the Council to run properly, I am sureit needed to have money.\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: What were the sources, where did the Councilget its monies from?\n\nMR THULU: I think it was one of the Nationalist Partytools, they used to get money from the Nationalist Party.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Did the Council also collect money fromthe residents or want to collect money from the residents in theform of the tariffs, such as for electricity and water etc. etc?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Were there any boycotts aimed against paymentof those things?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Is this one of the boycotts that you saythe 3 million gang interfered with?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Yesterday you testified about a possiblerelationship between, or collusion between the police and possiblythe prosecutors or prosecutor. Now did you see any visible relationshipor any evidence of working together between the 3 million gangand the Town Council?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: How did they work together?\n\nMR THULU: The then Council and the 3 million gang collaboratedbecause on many occasions we would see that the Mayor's transportwould be used by the 3 million gang members to attack the communityof Maokeng.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: You have said two things in that sentence,and I want you to treat them separately. Firstly you have saidthat members of the 3 million gang used to be transported by thekombis which belonged to the then Mayor.\n\nMR THULU: Yes, that is what I said.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: And then you said they would attack peopleor something to that effect with the kombis. Let's leave thatfor a while. On how many occasions did you see members of the3 million gang being transported in the vehicles of the Mayor? Whether they were going for shopping or for a picnic or to goas you say to go and kill people it doesn't matter. I just wantto know how many times did you see them being transported in thevehicles of the Mayor?\n\nMR THULU: This used to happen almost everyday becausethese were the people. The kombis would take them to town andgo to town to take them back. If they were supposed to appearbefore the court, they would be taken by those kombis and thenbe taken back in the same kombis.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Were these kombis operating as taxis inwhich any person could get into them, or would these kombis transportonly members of the 3 million gang?\n\nMR THULU: At first they were the public transport, butafter the community had a campaign against him he deemed it fitto use them for the 3 million gang.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: So at some stage the people of Maokengrefrained from using the kombis of the Mayor.\n\nMR THULU: Yes, Sir.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: They were initially used.\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Now after the people decided not to usehis taxis he then used it for the purpose of transporting the3 million gang.\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nJUDGE WILSON: Were these taxis that belonged to himin his private capacity?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: How many kombis are we talking about?\n\nMR THULU: There would be about five or six. He hada lot of kombis.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: What do you mean when you say the membersof the 3 million gang also used these kombis to attack membersof the public or the people?\n\nMR THULU: I mean they were like an armoured vehiclewhen they wanted to fight, because everywhere they wanted to goand fight they would be sitting in that transport.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Did you see any such occasion where theyused these kombis?\n\nMR THULU: Many a times.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Just give me the name of the Mayor at thetime?\n\nMR THULU: Mr Caswell Qweqwe(?).\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: What do you mean by saying that on occasionsas the members of the 3 million gang drove into town with thekombis the police followed them?\n\nMR THULU: They used to accompany them so that they aresafe, so as to take their mission forward as well.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: What are these objectives?\n\nMR THULU: To terrorise the community of Maokeng andto see to it that the ANC is terminated.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Can you give us an idea more or less ofthe number of members of the 3 million gang?\n\nMR THULU: The number of the members of the 3 milliongang?\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Yes. I know it will not be exact, but justgive us some indication?\n\nMR THULU: Plus or minus 30, plus those who were livingnear to (inaudible) because they feared that if they don't jointhey will be killed, but the original members, they were plusor minus 30.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Would they fill all the five to six kombisanyway?\n\nMR THULU: Yes, plus those who were fearing their lives. I mean 30 people can make two kombis and then the others\n\nwere those maybe who lived nearer to (inaudible) and returningas if they are because of their life.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Were there people who were forced to jointhe 3 million gang or to be supporters of the 3 million gang?\n\nMR THULU: I hope so. Because ...(intervention).\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: You think so.\n\nMR THULU: It is so, because they used to do it, to forcepeople to join it.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: And can you tell us more or less of thestrength, the strength of the self-defence unit?\n\nMR THULU: The strength?\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Yes. More or less how many people formedthe SDUs?\n\nMR THULU: We started, formed about three SDUs but astime went on the community volunteered and then I was only informedthat (inaudible) at such a place we have another group, that peopleare going to defend themselves. Their aim was to defend themselvesagainst the 3 million gang. I would go to different places asa coordinator to see to it that they function perfectly well. They would be doing the same thing that we were doing.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Are you saying there were several cells?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: But you don't know how many individualpeople, how many people in each cell, that you don't know.\n\nMR THULU: That one I don't know.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Were these cells all over the townshipmore or less?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nJUDGE WILSON: You said a moment ago that the South AfricanPolice used to accompany them so that they were safe. You remembertelling us that?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nJUDGE WILSON: Who did they have to protected against?\n\nMR THULU: The community.\n\nJUDGE WILSON: So they were in danger from the community,were they?\n\nMR THULU: Because they made people to be like that againstthem.\n\nJUDGE WILSON: Where did you get your firearm from?\n\nMR THULU: One of the community members gave me a firearm?\n\nJUDGE WILSON: Who?\n\nMR THULU: I can't recall the name because it is a longtime now, but if he can come here I can point him.\n\nJUDGE WILSON: You can't remember somebody who gave youa firearm?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nJUDGE WILSON: What happened to the firearm?\n\nMR THULU: The police took the firearm.\n\nJUDGE WILSON: When was that?\n\nMR THULU: A week before I can get arrested.\n\nJUDGE WILSON: On this charge?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nJUDGE WILSON: And how long had you had the firearm?\n\nMR THULU: Four months.\n\nJUDGE WILSON: So you remember that.\n\nMR THULU: Yes, I still remember well.\n\nJUDGE WILSON: You still remember well, do you?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nJUDGE WILSON: But you can't remember who.\n\n(BEGINNING OF SECOND SIDE OF TAPE 3 - ENGLISH INTERPRETER\n\nINAUDIBLE)\n\nJUDGE WILSON: So were you given the gun as soon as youwere released on bail?\n\nMR THULU: It just happened like that; I never organisedit.\n\nJUDGE WILSON: Why did you take a gun when you were outon bail?\n\nMR THULU: For the sake of my community's lives and myorganisation to defend them.\n\nJUDGE WILSON: How many times had you been in prison?\n\nMR THULU: On countless occasions, I can't remember well.\n\nJUDGE WILSON: Excuse me?\n\nMR THULU: On countless occasion, I couldn't rememberwell.\n\nJUDGE WILSON: And you took a gun as soon as you werereleased on bail to protect your community. Is that what youwant us to believe?\n\nMR THULU: Exactly.\n\nCHAIRMAN: Did the police ask you where you got the gunfrom?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nCHAIRMAN: Did you tell them who it was?\n\nMR THULU: No.\n\nADV DE JAGER: These kombis that were used by the 3 milliongang, were they also used by other members of the public, of thecommunity?\n\nMR THULU: No, the public boycotted the taxis.\n\nADV DE JAGER: So they were taxis that's been boycottedby the community out of their own free will.\n\nMR THULU: Pardon?\n\nADV DE JAGER: The community decided to boycott the taxisout of their own free will.\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nADV DE JAGER: And you've already told us that the policeprotected the taxis when they carried members of the 3 milliongang because the community may attack them, is that correct? You also once used a kombi to go to Trombe, is it so?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nADV DE JAGER: Was that also a taxi?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nADV DE JAGER: To whom did that taxi belong?\n\nMR THULU: Mr (inaudible).\n\nADV DE JAGER: So it was another owner of taxis, competingtaxi rank.\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nADV DE JAGER: Was there a taxi war sort of in thosedays too or not?\n\nMR THULU: Ja, it was operating taxi by that time. Itwas operating to transport the public.\n\nADV DE JAGER: But I think you don't follow my question. Was there a sort of taxi war between two taxi groups or didn'tthe taxi people have a war at that stage?\n\nMR THULU: No.\n\nADV DE JAGER: You said they were transported by the kombiswhen they had to appear in court, is that correct?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nADV DE JAGER: Were some of the members of the 3 milliongang arrested and did they have to appear in court?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nADV DE JAGER: And what happened to them?\n\nMR THULU: They just got released.\n\nADV DE JAGER: Do you know of people giving evidence againsthim in those cases?\n\nMR THULU: No.\n\nADV DE JAGER: Would the people be afraid to give evidenceagainst them?\n\nMR THULU: That's true, Sir.\n\nADV DE JAGER: Did the police enquire and try to get evidenceagainst them?\n\nMR THULU: No.\n\nADV DE JAGER: What you know of, or did they in factnot even try to get evidence against them?\n\nMR THULU: They didn't even try.\n\nADV DE JAGER: But they have arrested them, so they musthave grounds to believe they have done something wrong.\n\nMR THULU: The reason to arrest them, they wouldn't arrestthem. They wanted the community to leave them alone. They wouldtake them and put them in gaol. It was just something that wasbeing played to take them from the community. They arrested themfor safety sake from the community and the community's anger.\n\nJUDGE WILSON: But you said they appeared in court.\n\nMR THULU: Yes, even the very same court conspired withthe 3 million gang.\n\nADV DE JAGER: Did the 3 million gang recruit members fromall over the community?\n\nMR THULU: Yes, they recruited members all over the community.\n\nADV DE JAGER: Did they even recruit members who belongedto the ANC?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nADV DE JAGER: Did those members remain members of theANC?\n\nMR THULU: Yes, I still remember two of them.\n\nADV DE JAGER: Are they still members of the ANC now?\n\nMR THULU: They are not alive any more.\n\nADV DE JAGER: What happened to them?\n\nMR THULU: One of them was killed by the community atSashoville(?) he was stoned to death. And the other one waskilled by the SDU members during a war or during a fight.\n\nADV DE JAGER: How many members of the 3 million ganghave been killed over the years by the SDUs or the community?\n\nMR THULU: I don't have any specific number, but it isbetween 20 and 25.\n\nADV DE JAGER: Was that the original founder members?\n\nMR THULU: And the others who crossed from ANC and joinedthe gangster.\n\nMS KHAMPEPE: Mr Thulu, will you tell us how many peoplestayed Maokeng Township? Are you able to approximate the numberof people?\n\nMR THULU: No.\n\nMS KHAMPEPE: Will you say you have about 50 000 people,you have about 5 000 residents in Maokeng Township?\n\nMR THULU: I remember the statistics were up to 130 000residents of Maokeng. It was in 1991.\n\nMS KHAMPEPE: Do you have other political parties formingpart of the community of Maokeng Township? Would you have theANC, the IFP and the PAC and such other parties?\n\nMR THULU: AZAPO was there and the PAC was there, butwhen I left the IFP was not here. I don't know presently is itthere or not.\n\nMS KHAMPEPE: And are you able to tell us what the concentrationlevel within the 3 million gang was? How many percentages youhad of the AZAPO membership with forming part of the 3 milliongang?\n\nMR THULU: Some of them joined the 3 million gang andI met their leaders. I still remember when I met their leaders. They were with Duvidi in the court of law and they were alreadystaying at Trombo(?), which was a very strong (inaudible). Icalled the two of them aside. I said to them, Look, this is irrelevant,we are fighting for one thing. I am requesting you, be awarethat the Nationalist Party is using the 3 million gang. I don'twant to land up in a situation where we would be fighting againstyou. They asked me, what do you want us to do? I said the communityknows that you are now part of the 3 million gang. I will goback to the community and tell them what to do and then you haveto go back to your different homes until I resolve this issue.\n\nMS KHAMPEPE: Let me ask you a very direct question,Mr Tulu. Was the 3 million gang threatening the whole communityof Maokeng, which consisted of other different political parties,or did it direct its attacks predominantly on the ANC members?\n\nMR THULU: Directly on the ANC members.\n\nMS KHAMPEPE: Are you able to give us examples on whichyou drew this conclusion that their attacks were directed onlyto ANC members?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nMS KHAMPEPE: Will you please do that, Mr Tulu, whichwill assist us.\n\nMR THULU: It happened that I was together with the membersof the SDUs. I was with (inaudible) from Kentucky and we wantedto cross the street. Bloem had been to the\n\ndoctor. Someone insulted him with his mother. We met with theother comrades and the SDUs were so disturbed and they wantedto attack and then (inaudible) and he said we know who are thepuppets, we don't have to worry. And it happened to me when theykilled Comrade Ngesile very close to the (inaudible). When theyleft they went direct to my home. The previous day I was goingto the doctor for ulcer treatments but they were aware that Iwas sick. Fortunately enough I was together with some membersof the SDU and they drove them back when they tried to kill me. And when we approached the corner we saw a police van. And thenwe could see that they were driven to this place by the police. And I was a member of the ANC and I was the leader of the SDUs.\n\nMS KHAMPEPE: What was the intention behind the formationin Maokeng Township of the SDUs?\n\nMR THULU: To defend the community and African NationalCongress, the termination of African National Congress against3 million gang.\n\nMS KHAMPEPE: That was the main intention behind theformation.\n\nMR THULU: Of SDUs.\n\nMS KHAMPEPE: And when was the SDU formed? You are theCommander?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nMS KHAMPEPE: When was it formed?\n\nMR THULU: Before the end of the month November.\n\nMS KHAMPEPE: Which year?\n\nMR THULU: In 1990.\n\nMS KHAMPEPE: When did the 3 million gang come intoexistence?\n\nMR THULU: I still recall very well. It started existingbetween June month and July month.\n\nMS KHAMPEPE: Which year?\n\nMR THULU: The very same year, 1990.\n\nMS KHAMPEPE: Yesterday there was evidence led by MrPetros that when the 3 million gang started, it started as a criminalgang involved in ordinary criminal activity, but it later tookon a political character.\n\nMR THULU: Yes, you see that's how they used to (inaudible). He wanted us to avoid the fact that the government was part ofwhat they were doing. What I can tell you is, Roland Petros isa member of the SDU under our command, the other commanders ofthe SDU. He doesn't have that kind of information. We have alot of information and they were just doing the defence for thecommunity through our (inaudible)\n\nMS KHAMPEPE: I am unable to get your response to myquestion.\n\nMR THULU: What I am trying to say is, when he saidthey were a criminal group, it was a tactic from the police as\n\nwell as the Council so that this was not a group to attack thepeople. The Council and the police were behind them actuallybecause as leaders we used to hold meetings with the Council regardingthe rent issues and we were then told that these people are notpaying. My organisation will come and evict them. Now we knewthat what they were doing to the community, it wasn't the truth. It wasn't the right thing; they were just disguising.\n\nMS KHAMPEPE: Mr Thulu, are you in summary saying thatwhen the 3 million gang came into existence they took on a politicalcharacter and they were not initially involved in criminal activities?\n\nMR THULU: That's what I am saying.\n\nMS KHAMPEPE: Let's go back to the death of Mr Masusu. When was the decision taken to kill Mr Masusu by your organisation?\n\nMR THULU: Actually we never took the decision of killingMasuso. What we did, we said that we will defend the communityagainst Masuso. Irrespective of what kind of defence are we goingto take, but we will just defend the community.\n\nMS KHAMPEPE: When was that decision made?\n\nMR THULU: When I started forming the SDUs as a Commander,that was the day when we decided as a general Commander. Duringthis time there was no formal Commander to say stand here anddo this. But even those who joined the SDUs later they have nevercome to me, they will do exactly what they found other membersof the SDU were doing.\n\nMS KHAMPEPE: Mr Masusu was killed in 1991 and you hadalready taken this decision in about November 1990.\n\nMR THULU: That is the act to protect the community againstthe harassment.\n\nMS KHAMPEPE: Was there any reason why that order wasnot acted upon immediately, why you had to wait until the 11thFebruary 1991 to put that order into effect, or that decision,to implement that decision.\n\nMR THULU: We were not in a hurry to kill him and itwas not our intention to kill him. We were just defending thecommunity against him. Even to go there, it wasn't our plan tokill him, but it just happened that at the time we had to defendourselves. That's how he died. If we were in any hurry to killhim we could have stood up at that time and go straight to himand kill him, but it wasn't our intention. We wanted to defendthe community, but the situation led to his death.\n\nMS KHAMPEPE: Do I understand your evidence correctlywhen you stated just now that you actually went to Trombo(?) whichis the stronghold of the 3 million gang and you found yourselfsuddenly in the company of the 3 million gang and you had to shootyour way out to defend yourselves. Now why did you go to Trombo,knowing that it is the stronghold of the 3 million gang?\n\nMR THULU: Usually during the day some of them used togo to town and we thought that by going to Trombo - because thepolice were (inaudible) of the ANC (inaudible). We thought thatby going to Trombo those left behind would run away and the policewould never have in their minds to go to Trombo to search forus and they would never think that we'd be at Trombo.\n\nMS KHAMPEPE: Notwithstanding the fact that it was thestronghold of the 3 million gang who were being assisted by thepolice at all material times?\n\nMR THULU: We realised at that time that it was the lastalternative to go to (inaudible). Because to remain in that areawhere the police were occupying some of us wouldn't be livingtoday. Now we went there and the incident took place and thepolice left our stronghold and they came to this area and we managedto go back to our area.\n\nMS KHAMPEPE: How many kombis did you take Mr Tulu withyou to Trombo? Did you use, one, two kombis?\n\nMR THULU: One.\n\nMS KHAMPEPE: And how many people were there?\n\nMR THULU: It was full.\n\nMS KHAMPEPE: How many people were inside the kombi?\n\nMR THULU: Fifteen.\n\nMS KHAMPEPE: Are you able to enlighten us why Mr Masusuwas the one who you killed instead of Mr Duvidi if you wantedto weaken the 3 million gang?\n\nMR THULU: I have never wanted for an individual, Duvidior Masusu, I was actually defending the people that were at Trombo. Before I could meet Duvidi I met Masusu and I had to (indistinct).\n\nJUDGE WILSON: You were defending the people at Trombo. Is that what you said?\n\nMR THULU: The aim of going to Trombo was not to go anddefend the people of Trombo.\n\nCHAIRMAN: We will take the short adjournment at this stageand resume in 15 minutes.\n\nCOMMITTEE ADJOURNS\n\nON RESUMPTION:\n\nJUDGE WILSON: There are two points I would like to clearup with you. These two AZAPO people you told us about, you rememberyou told us two AZAPO people who joined the 3 million gang.\n\nMR THULU: Yes. Masheme Shisani(?) and Patrick (inaudible).\n\nJUDGE WILSON: Do you know where they are now?\n\nMR THULU: No, I don't know where they are now.\n\nJUDGE WILSON: The second point I would like you to tellme is why were the police looking for you on this morning, themorning when you killed this man?\n\nMR THULU: Because they heard that I am the one who killedthe deceased.\n\nJUDGE WILSON: No, before you killed the deceased, whywere they looking for you?\n\nMR THULU: I gave impact to - the reason for them tolook for me, I was the leader of the SDUs.\n\nJUDGE WILSON: Yes, but you had been the leader of itfor months hadn't you? Why did they suddenly come looking foryou this morning, on this particular morning?\n\nMR THULU: Which morning are you referring to?\n\nJUDGE WILSON: The morning on which you killed this man,the 11th February.\n\nMR THULU: They knew I was the leader of the SDUs sothat made them suspicion that I was some sort of a disturber tothis organisation which is the 3 million gang.\n\nJUDGE WILSON: For how long had you been the leader ofthe SDUs?\n\nMR THULU: From their origin, from the day when theywere started.\n\nJUDGE WILSON: So why were they looking for you\n\non this morning of the 11th February? Was there any reason whythe police should come looking for you?\n\nMR THULU: The reason for them to look for me, I wasthe leader of the SDUs and these units were disturbing the 3 milliongang to carry forward their aims.\n\nMS KHAMPEPE: Mr Tulu, were the SDU members constantlyharassed by the police?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nMS KHAMPEPE: And these harassment took also the form ofthem being constantly being investigated by the police?\n\nMR THULU: Could you repeat the question?\n\nMS KHAMPEPE: The harassment that the police had on theSDU members, did it also take the form of you being constantlybeing under surveillance by the police?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nMS KHAMPEPE: Were you scared to sleep at your home? Yesterday you gave evidence that you actually spent most of yourtime at your girlfriend's place.\n\nMR THULU: Yes, that's right.\n\nMS KHAMPEPE: Why were you scared to sleep at your home?\n\nMR THULU: Because the 3 million gang would attack meand the police would be able to arrest me.\n\nMS KHAMPEPE: Were you more scared of the 3 million gangthan you were scared of being harassed by the police?\n\nMR THULU: From both sides it was the same thing.\n\nMS KHAMPEPE: So you actually saw both parties, that isthe police and the 3 million gang, as actually acting againstanything that the SDU members stood for and the ANC Youth League?\n\nMR TULU: Yes.\n\nADV DE JAGER: Did the police know who your girlfriendwas?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nADV DE JAGER: And they knew you were staying with her?\n\nMR THULU: No.\n\nADV DE JAGER: But they knew you visited her, she is yourgirlfriend?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Mr Thulu, I just wanted to clear something. You made reference to a state prosecutor yesterday. Preciselywhat did you say was his or her role with regard to the 3 milliongang?\n\nMR THULU: She was the person who would protect themfrom going to gaol.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Sorry. Can you just repeat your answer? I had asked you what the exact role was of the prosecutor?\n\nMR THULU: She made it a point that their cases wouldbe handled by her and then she would make it a point that theydon't go to gaol.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Is that all you can say about her?\n\nMR THULU: That's all.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Because yesterday somebody told us thatat some stage she accommodated members of the 3 million gang intown. Do you know anything about that or you don't?\n\nMR THULU: I know it from rumours, but I don't have anyevidence regarding that case.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: We are talking about in the past whenpeople used to be seen in terms of being black and white in thiscountry. That was the position during that time, am I right?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Members of the 3 million gang, were theyblack people?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: We were told that they killed a numberof people, these members of the 3 million gang, a figure of about102 was mentioned to us. Is that the figure that you were alsogiven?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Were these victims black?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Were arrests made in respect of some ofthese murders or not?\n\nMR THULU: Arrests were made, people were arrested, butit wasn't of any use because they were released, they were neversent to gaol to show that they've done a very bad thing.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Were there any - or let me put it to youthis way. A witness told us yesterday that members of the communityhere complained about lack of activity by the police, they wrotea letter to a Minister and only thereafter a certain captain wassent here. Do you know about that?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Such arrests as were made, were they madebefore that captain came here or after?\n\nMR THULU: The arrests were made before he was brought\n\nhere. They were arrested and they were never sentenced. Theycame back to the township.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: You say the arrests were made. Sorry,were they made after or before, I am sorry?\n\nMR THULU: The police arrested them before and then theybrought them back to the community.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: And after his arrival were any arrestsmade?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Were the people not brought back to thecommunity there at that stage?\n\nMR THULU: No. They came after a long time and thenthose who were involved in the murder cases were sentenced andthey stayed in gaol.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: That was only after the captain arrived.\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: To your knowledge, did members of the 3million gang kill any white person?\n\nMR THULU: I don't have any knowledge of that.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: You are a resident of Maokeng, isn't it?\n\nMR THULU: Yes, that's true.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: And Kroonstad is not very far from Maokeng.\n\nMR THULU: Yes, it is not far.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Do you know of during that time any whitepeople who were killed by criminals around Kroonstad, not theirnames, but just the incidents?\n\nMR THULU: I don't know.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: You know of an incident, don't you duringwhich certain white people were killed in Maokeng by a group ofyoung people, don't you know about that? Or were you alreadyin gaol?\n\nMR THULU: I was already in gaol when one of the whitemen - we never regarded him as a white person. He was stayingwith us here.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Who?\n\nMR THULU: He was called Thabo.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Oh, you refer to an incident in which onewhite man was killed.\n\nMR THULU: That's the one I am referring to, but whenyou asked me at first it must have slipped my mind because wenever regarded his colour, or we didn't see him as a white person.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: That is why I said to you that we are goingback to history when we used to see colours.\n\nMR THULU: Ekskuus?\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: That is why when I asked you about thecolour of the people, I told you that we are going back to historywhen we used to see colours. I actually wanted you to see colours.\n\nMR THULU: It is true that was used, but in our organisationwe never regarded colour.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Was an arrest made in connection with thatparticular murder?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Soon after the murder or did it take a longtime to have an arrest made in respect of that particular murder?\n\nMR THULU: That's the question I cannot answer.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Thank you. Is there a police station inMaokeng itself?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: How many police stations in Maokeng?\n\nMR THULU: Two of them, Sir.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Were they there during the time when about102 people or so were killed?\n\nMR THULU: Yes.\n\nJUDGE MGOEPE: Yesterday I asked the other person togive an example of the names of the ANC leaders who were alsokilled during that "
