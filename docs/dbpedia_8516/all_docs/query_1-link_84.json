        "text": "At Biofarm, we respect and protect the privacy of our customers and users who visit our websites. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use information for Biofarm’s marketing services, including the advertising services, promotions, informational mailings and other offers we provide. By using any services provided by Biofarm, you indicate that you agree to the collection and use of your information by Biofarm as outlined in this Privacy Policy.\n\nWhen transacting with Biofarm, we processes the personal information of clients for whom we are providing a service. We take our responsibility under The Protection of Personal Information Act 4 of 2013 (also known as POPIA) seriously, and we have therefore put in place strict measures to ensure that any personal information we receive whilst providing a service is kept secure and is used only for the purpose for which it was collected.\n\nWhat is POPIA about?\n\nPOPI prescribes a set of conditions and principles that regulate the collection, processing and use of personal information, and ensures the lawfulness of such actions. These principles and conditions have been enacted (made to law) to promote the constitutional right to privacy contained in section 14 of the South African Constitution and to protect a person’s personal information and the use of this information by third parties. Bear in mind that different countries have their own unique privacy laws.\n\nImportantly, POPI protects persons from suffering damage and harm by requiring entities and parties who receive their personal details to protect the confidentiality and integrity of such information. POPI therefore places an important responsibility on parties who collect, store, use and destroy personal information, and also provides rights and solutions to persons whose rights have been infringed in terms of POPI. It requires the relevant parties dealing with personal information to take care of such information and protects the general public against the incorrect and unauthorised use of their personal information, whether used for purposes of identity theft, abusive marketing practices or other unauthorised purposes. It is important to be aware that POPI does not aim to stop the flow or sharing of personal information, but rather aims to establish and set guidelines and rules for how this must be done in line with international standards, to protect the privacy of the persons whose personal information is being processed.\n\nTerms and Definitions\n\nData Subject: The individual whose personal data is being processed and to whom personal information relates.\n\nResponsible Party: The responsible party is the individual or company, either public or private, that processes personal information and determines its purpose.\n\nOperator: A responsible party should not be confused with an operator who is a person processing the information on the instruction of the responsible party by contract or mandate and is not under the direct authority of the responsible party. When personal information is processed by an operator the responsible party still remains responsible for the processing.\n\nPersonal information: In terms of POPI, personal information is any information relating to an identifiable, living natural person and, if applicable, to an existing identifiable juristic person (which is known as a “data subject”).\n\nPersonal information may therefore include but is not limited to any of the following – information relating to race, gender, sexual orientation, medical history, criminal history, religion, beliefs, disabilities, marital status, pregnancy, language, education, finances, employment history, online identifiers, pseudonyms, physical address, telephone numbers, and biometric information. If processing a name of a person reveals that person’s personal information, then the name is also considered personal information.\n\nProcessing: The processing of personal information involves any collection, use, storage, deletion, or destruction of personal information.\n\nHow we process your personal information\n\nWe receive, process, store and eventually destroy personal information (such as name, surname, email address, phone number, physical and postal address, etc.) you provide us when you become a customer or a supplier. The personal information that we collect is processed in line with the 8 conditions for lawful processing in the Protection of Personal Information Act. We therefore:\n\nAccept joint responsibility and accountability with you to responsibly manage and protect your Personal Information when providing our services and solutions to you;\n\nUndertake to receive, only from you, and process the Personal Information that is necessary for the purpose to assist you with your required solutions, conclude the necessarily related agreements and consider the legitimate legal interests of everyone concerned, as required by the Act and to respect your right to withdraw your consent for the processing of your Personal Information;\n\nUndertake to only use your Personal Information for the purpose required to assist you or provide solutions to you;\n\nUndertake not to share or further process your Personal Information with anyone if not required for assisting you with your solutions or by the law;\n\nUndertake to be open and transparent and notify you as and when required by law regarding why and how your Personal Information needs to be collected;\n\nUndertake to safeguard and protect your Personal Information in our possession;\n\nUndertake to freely confirm what Personal Information we have, to update and correct the Personal Information, and to keep it for no longer than legally required. You have the right to ask for your personal information to be rectified or deleted.\n\nBiofarm requires its operators (suppliers) who process information personal on our behalf to have an agreement, which is known as an operator’s agreement, in place with us. Our suppliers may need to process personal information in order for us to provide a service to you.\n\nWhy We Collect Information\n\nFirst and foremost, Biofarm collects information to improve the services we provide and to present you with information and services that will interest you. We also use your information to measure our success and performance. For example, aggregate information gives us an idea of the number of visitors we attract and how they navigate our websites.\n\nOther reasons for processing your personal information include:\n\nTo assist us in carrying out a transaction you requested and to maintain our relationship;\n\nTo respond to your queries;\n\nTo confirm and verify your identity or to verify that you are an authorised user for security purposes;\n\nFor billing and other accounting purposes;\n\nTo assess and process orders;\n\nTo conduct credit reference searches or verification, only if you authorise this or if it’s a requirement to provide solutions to you;\n\nFor operational purposes required to assist you with the solutions you require;\n\nFor audit and record-keeping purposes;\n\nIn connection with possible requirements by the Information Regulator or other Government agencies allowed by law, legal proceedings, or court rulings.\n\nUse of Personal Information\n\nUnless you voluntarily provide personal information for a specific purpose, we do not collect personal information from you. We will never combine any personal information about a user of our site with any aggregate information we collect about that user, whether collected on our site or our Advertising Service. If you choose to provide personal information during registration or when using our services, we use your personal information to provide you with particular product or services that you request. If your personal information changes, you may correct, update or delete it by emailing our Customer Support at info@biofarmcc.co.za.\n\nBiofarm will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. However, we may transfer personal information in connection with a sale or merger of Biofarm or the division responsible for the services provided to you. We may also share your personal information, such as your email address, mailing address, etc., with our technical consultants, third party auditors and other third parties who make our site available, enhance its functionality or provide associated services and/or who deal with you in processing your orders and/or delivering content, samples, products, services and gifts and prizes. These third parties are not allowed to use personal information except for the purposes of providing the applicable services. In addition, we reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our website. Our site and services are maintained in South Africa. By using the site and/or services, you authorize the export of personal information to the South Africa and its storage and use as specified in this policy.\n\nOther Information We Collect and Use\n\nWe may collect non-personally identifiable information with cookies, such as IP address, browser type and version, and pages you view.
