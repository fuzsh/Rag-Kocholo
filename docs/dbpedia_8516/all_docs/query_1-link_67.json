        "text": "Cardinal Stephen Brislin, Cardinal Archbishop of the Metropolitan archdiocese of Cape Town\n\n• Born in Welkom on 24 September 1956.\n\n• Schooling at St Agnes’ Convent, Welkom and CBC, Welkom\n\n• Seminary: Philosophy at St John Vianney, Pretoria and Theology at the Missionary Institute, London\n\n• Ordained a priest on 19 November 1983.\n\n• Ordained Bishop of Kroonstad on 28 January 2007.\n\n• Installed as Archbishop of Cape Town on 7 February 2010, on the Solemnity of Our Lady of the Flight into Egypt, the patronal feast of the Archdiocese of Cape Town.\n\n• Awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Pastoral Leadership by the Oblate School of Theology, San Antonio, Texas, USA on 5 May 2023.\n\n• Announced as a Cardinal by Pope Francis at the pope’s Angelus address in Rome on 9 July 2023.\n\n• Created a Cardinal-Priest of the Titular Church of Santa Maria Domenica Mazzarello by Pope Francis at the Consistory on 30 September 2023.\n\nThe Coat-of-Arms of Cardinal Stephen Brislin\n\nThe Coat-of-Arms of Cardinal Brislin shows on a red shield a silver pall, which symbolises the cross as the instrument of salvation. On it is placed a red Basotho hat (mokorotlo) that represents the Cardinal’s roots in the Free State.\n\nBelow the pall is the star that symbolises the Southern Cross and the patronage of Our Lady of the Flight Into Egypt; as well as the anchor, a symbol of hope that reflects Cape Town’s location at the Cape of Good Hope.\n\nBehind the shield is the patriarchal cross and the pallium, both indicating that he is the Archbishop of a Metropolitan see.\n\nAs a member of the College of Cardinals the coat of arms is surmounted by a scarlet galero with 15 tassels (fiocchi) on each side. The Cardinal’s motto “Veritas in Caritate” (Truth in Charity) remains unchanged since his first appointment as bishop of Kroonstad.\n\nRight Reverend Sylvester David OMI, Auxiliary Bishop of Cape Town\n\n• Born in Durban on 15 August 1953.\n\n• Oblate Formation: OMI Pre-Novitiate at Cleland 1982-3; OMI Novitiate in Johannesburg in 1984 and First Vows in January 1985; Final Vows in Durban in 1988; Seminary Formation: St Joseph’s Scholasticate, Cedara 1985-1990\n\n• Ordained a priest on 8 February 1991.\n\n• Ordained Auxiliary Bishop of Cape Town on 25 August 2019.\n\nThe Coat-of-Arms of Bishop Sylvester David\n\nThe motto unus Deus et Pater omnium is an excerpt from Ephesians 4:6 and is translated as “one God and Father of all”. Omnium literally means everything – including the ecology. This expression was chosen as an encouragement to us to embrace to a greater extent the high calling to live as God’s children by caring for each other and for the ecology.\n\nThe shield\n\nThe shield is separated into four quadrants by the Oblate Cross. The four motifs from the top left quadrant and continuing clockwise are Heart, Holy Spirit, Apostles, and Sacred Fire. These depict the advice to the Oblates from St Eugene de Mazenod their Founder who wrote: “Your destiny is to be apostles, and so tend within your hearts the sacred fire that the Holy Spirit lights there…” (Eugene de Mazenod, Nov 17, 1851). Notice that the heart comprises fingerprints. This was the artist’s way of depicting the incarnation. The apparent repetition in the symbols of Sacred Fire and Holy Spirit derive from the writing of St de Mazenod who saw the Sacred Fire as being lit by the Holy Spirit. In other words, Sacred Fire is caused by the Holy Spirit.\n\nFrom the time of the discovery of the Cape, ecclesiastical jurisdiction over it appertained to the Portuguese missionary authorities. After the settlement of the Cape in 1652, the practice of the Catholic religion was prohibited by the civil authorities.\n\nCommissioner General De Mist, by ordinance of 25 July 1804, declared that “all religious societies which for the furtherance of virtue and good morals worship an Almighty Being, are to enjoy in this Colony equal protection from the laws…” and in 1805 three Dutch priests arrived to minister to the Catholics of the Cape. One of them, Father Johannes Lansink, was appointed Prefect Apostolic (a title more or less equivalent to that of bishop, but used in missionary areas). The following year the military authorities ordered them to leave.\n\nIn February 1818 Pope Pius Vll erected the Vicariate Apostolic (a title more or less equivalent to that of diocese, but used in missionary areas) of the Cape of Good Hope and adjacent areas. Subsequently the “surrounding islands” were added – and these included Madagascar, Mauritius, Australia and New Zealand. The first Vicar Apostolic, the Right Reverend Bishop Bede Slater, OSB, having called at the Cape, went to reside in Mauritius. He was succeeded by the Rt Reverend Bishop William Morris, OSB, who also resided at Mauritius.\n\nOn June 6, 1837, Pope Gregory XVI constituted the Cape of Good Hope a separate vicariate (again similar to a diocese) and appointed the Rt Reverend Bishop Patrick Griffith, OP, as the first resident vicar apostolic (a more advanced title than prefect apostolic, and still similar to bishop).\n\nIn 1847, the Vicariate of the Cape of Good Hope was divided into the Vicariates of the Western District and the Eastern District of the Cape of Good Hope.\n\nOn May 24 1872 the Prefecture of the Central District of the Cape of Good Hope was detached from the Western Vicariate.\n\nBy decree of the Sacred Congregation of Propaganda Fide (that department in the Vatican which deals with missionary territories) dated June 13, 1939, the name of the Western Vicariate was changed to the Vicariate of Cape Town.\n\nOn January 11, 1951, Pope Pius Xll established the ecclesiastical hierarchy in the then Union of South Africa, and set up the ecclesiastical Province of Cape Town, comprising the metropolitan church of Cape Town, with the suffragan sees of Aliwal, Oudtshoorn, Port Elizabeth, Queenstown and De Aar.\n\nBy the same bull, the Most Reverend Archbishop Owen McCann was appointed to the Metropolitan See of Cape Town.\n\nThe islands of Tristan da Cunha, Gough, Ascension and St Helena belonged to the Archdiocese of Cape Town until 18 August 1986 when they were given to the care of the Mill Hill Fathers, whose residence is based on the Falkland Islands.\n\nThe archdiocese is centred on the city of Cape Town and includes the southernmost tip of the continent of Africa; its area is bounded on the west by the Atlantic Ocean, on the north by the southern boundaries of the Van Rhynsdorp district, on the east by the western boundaries of the Calvinia, Ceres, Tulbagh, Worcester, Robertson and Swellendam districts, and on the south by the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe civil districts within the ecclesiastical area of the archdiocese are the districts of Cape, Wynberg, Simon’s Town, Bellville, Somerset West, Stellenbosch, Paarl, Wellington, Caledon, Bredasdorp, Malmesbury, Piketberg and Clanwilliam.\n\nThe Catholic Church throughout the world is divided into administrative units called dioceses. Each diocese is headed by a bishop. In some cases (as in South Africa) those dioceses which are of greater political importance are called archdioceses and are headed by an archbishop. In South Africa there are four such archdioceses, one of which is Cape Town.\n\nEach diocesan bishop in the world (ecclesiastically called an ordinary to distinguish him from other bishops who work in an administrative capacity) is responsible directly to the Pope. In order to facilitate and co-ordinate various matters of national interest such as seminaries, the bishops of South Africa are associated into the Southern African Catholic Bishops Conference (SACBC). This conference is affiliated to two other such conferences: IMBISA (the Inter-regional Meeting of Bishops of Southern Africa) and SECAM (the Symposium of Episcopal Conferences of Africa and Madagascar).\n\nA representative of the Pope was appointed in 1922 as the Apostolic Delegate. In 1994 the Holy See (the diocese of Rome and the Papal administration) and South Africa established diplomatic relations, setting up an Apostolic Nunciature for the Holy See in Pretoria and a South African Embassy in the Vatican.\n\nBecause Cape Town is the seat of parliament and the legislative capital of South Africa, it is ecclesiastically known as a metropolitan diocese – with the dioceses of Aliwal, De Aar, Oudtshoorn, Port Elizabeth and Queenstown as its suffragan sees.\n\nThese other dioceses rely to some extent on Cape Town for ecclesiastical support, although they are in no way subordinate to Cape Town.\n\nTo help him administer the Archdiocese of Cape Town, the Archbishop has appointed two vicars general. Both carry the title of Monsignor.\n\nA chancellor is appointed in each diocese, whose task it is to act as a notary or someone who authenticates any official document which the archbishop might issue.\n\nTo help in the ministry of the various departments of the Archdiocese of Cape Town, a number of priests have been appointed as vicars or heads of those departments.\n\nTogether with an equal number of other priests elected by the priests serving in Cape Town, these constitute the presbyteral council, and it is from this body that the archbishop chooses his consultors or advisors.\n\nIn order to co-ordinate the pastoral function of the various parishes in Cape Town, five deans have been elected by the priests as their spokesmen in certain matters.\n\nThe body of deacons constitutes the Council of Deacons and the Archbishop appoints a co-ordinator as a liaison between himself and the deacons.\n\nThe geographical area of Cape Town is divided up into 80 autonomous areas called parishes. Each parish is obliged to have its own pastoral council as well as a finance council.\n\nRepresentatives from these parish councils – as well as of other bodies – together form the Archdiocesan Pastoral Council whose task it is to advise the archbishop in certain matters.\n\nIn total the archdiocese covers an area of 30 892 square kilometres with a total population of 4 737 197 people, of whom 264 342 are Catholics (as of 2021).\n\nThe administrative centre of the archdiocese is called a chancery and is located at 12 Bouquet Street in Cape Town. Its postal address is P O Box 2910, Cape Town, 8000. The telephone number for all departments in the chancery is 021 462 2417; the fax number is 021 461 9330 and the e-mail address is info@adct.org.za\n\nThe weekend of 27 February is designated as “synod focus Sunday” in the Archdiocese of Cape Town, with a view to launching the process in parishes in March and April (and May, if needed). Please see the videos below that can be used during Mass and sent to parishioners to help them understand what it is all about.\n\nThe training document and template are also available to assist with parish implementation.\n\nThe proposed timeline for synod process in parishes and in the Archdiocese is:\n\n27 February 2022 – Synod Focus Sunday (prayer of the faithful; mention in the homily; showing/airing of Archbishop’s video; sending out link to video explaining the synod; and giving practical details to parishioners).\n\nMarch and April and May 2022 – Group meetings in parishes. May 2022 – Beginning of collation of submissions at a parish level.\n\n15 June 2022 – Deadline for collated parish submissions to be sent to synodadct@gmail.com using the template provided. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD\n\n25 June 2022 – Closing celebration and symbolic handover of parish responses July 2022 – Collation of submissions on a diocesan level.\n\nWe encourage all to use the following question during this listening process and within the ‘listening circles’:\n\nA Synodal Church, in announcing the Gospel, ‘journeys together.’ Drawing on the fundamental question of the synod, we invite you to reflect on the question:\n\nHow is this journeying together happening in your local church (parish/ archdiocese)?\n\nTo help clarify your reflection process, consider the following experiences within the church:\n\n– What inspires and animates you, what makes you thankful and grateful about your Catholic life?\n\n– What disappoints, wounds, or disillusions you?\n\n– Where in particular is the spirit calling for growth and change in our thinking and practices?\n\nPerhaps one or more of the topics from the pastoral plan resonates with you in this process: Evangelization, Empowerment of Laity, Life of Priests and Deacons and Bishops, Family and Youth, Justice and Peace, Healing and Reconciliation, Care of Creation.\n\nThe Synod Explained for Young People\n\nMANUAL PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 51 OF THE PROMOTION OF ACCESS TO INFORMATION ACT NO 2 OF 2000\n\n(“the Act”)\n\nFOR\n\nARCHDIOCESE OF CAPE TOWN\n\nCompany Overview\n\nARCHDIOCESE OF CAPE TOWN is a religious organisation operating as a church.\n\nPart I (Information required under Section 51(1)(a) of the Act)\n\nName of Body: ARCHDIOCESE OF CAPE TOWN\n\nPhysical Address: 12 Bouquet Street CAPE TOWN, 8001\n\nPostal Address: PO Box 2910 CAPE TOWN, 8000\n\nHead of Body: THE CHANCELLOR FROM TIME TO TIME\n\nTelephone No: 021 462 2417\n\nFax no: 021 461 9330\n\nE-mail: NOT APPLICABLE\n\nPart II (Information required under Section 51(1)(b) of the Act)\n\nA guide on how to use the Act is to be compiled by the Human Rights Commission in terms of Section 10 of the Act by no later than August 2003.
