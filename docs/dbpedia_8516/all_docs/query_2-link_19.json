        "text": "South Africa has nine provinces, which vary considerably in size. The smallest is tiny and crowded Gauteng, a highly urbanised region, and the largest the vast, arid and empty Northern Cape, which takes up almost a third of South Africa’s total land area.\n\nEach province has its own Legislature, Premier and Executive Council. The country has common boundaries with Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, while Mozambique and Eswatini lie to the north-east.\n\nCompletely enclosed by South African territory in the south-east is the mountain kingdom of Lesotho. South Africa has three capitals:\n\nCape Town, in the City of Cape Town Metropolitan Municipality, Western Cape, is the legislative capital and is where the country’s Parliament is found.\n\nBloemfontein, in Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality, Free State, is the judicial capital and home to the Supreme Court of Appeal.\n\nPretoria, in the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality, Gauteng, is the administrative capital, and the ultimate capital of the country. It is home to the Union Buildings and a large proportion of the Public Service.\n\nEastern Cape\n\nThe Eastern Cape, lying on the south-eastern South African coast, is a region of great natural beauty, particularly the rugged cliffs, rough seas and dense green bush of the stretch known as the Wild Coast. In the Eastern Cape, various floral habitats meet. Along the coast, the northern tropical forests intermingle with the more temperate woods of the south. The province is serviced by airports situated in Gqeberha (formerly Port Elizabeth), East London, Mthatha and Bhisho.\n\nThe top 15 iconic tourist destinations have been digitised and are available on the virtual platforms, where potential tourists could virtually tour them.\n\nThe province has since renamed a number of government facilities and places after the legends who fought against apartheid:\n\nThe Bhisho State House is now Lillian Diedericks House, (Bhisho), Lillian Diedericks Municipal Building.\n\nIn the Nelson Mandela Metro, the Brister House has been renamed after Mama Lillian Diedericks, Port Elizabeth Airport to Dawid Stuurman Airport and East London Airport to King Phalo Airport.\n\nCapital: Bhisho\n\nPrincipal languages: isiXhosa 82,7%, Afrikaans 10,3%, English 3,9%\n\nPopulation: 6 676 691\n\nPercentage share of the total population: 11,1%\n\nArea: 168 966 km2\n\nSource: Stats SA’s Census 2022\n\nFree State\n\nThe Free State – a province of wide horizons and blue skies, farmland, mountains, goldfields and widely dispersed towns – lies in the heart of South Africa.

Mining, particularly gold, is the biggest employer, followed by manufacturing.\n\nThe Free State also produces high-quality diamonds from its kimberlite pipes and fissures, and the country’s largest deposit of bentonite is found in the Koppies district.
