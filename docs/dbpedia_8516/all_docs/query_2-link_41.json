        "text": "Chapters 2-15\n\nCHAPTER 2. FINDING WHO I AM\n\nIn 1958 I was called by God to work in Liberia. Of that I am sure. I didn’t want to be an upwardly mobile academic enjoying middle-class American comfort. I remember thinking “how boring”, when a classmate at Union Seminary was hired by the University of Arkansas. What I did not know, and still don’t fully know, is: why Africa, why Liberia? Some answers: witness to Christ, teach what I had learned, take a job that no one else wanted to do, serve the poor, work across cultural and racial barriers, run away from a sick American culture, find a very little pond where I would be a big fish, satisfy an urge for adventure, escape from having to prove myself as an engineer or a mathematician or an historian. But why Africa? Only God knew, and still knows. One task for this book is to find out why.\n\nLying behind my choice was an unspoken assumption: that I could help Africans become like me. Now that I confront that assumption I realize immediately that my Tanganyikan student Shabani Kisenge was right when he announced to Judy’s freshman English class in early 1959: “missionaries are imperialists in disguise:”. To him an imperialist is a person who imposes his culture, his political system, his beliefs, his knowledge on others. Political conquest is only a superficial aspect of imperialism. Total conquest is more than political rule, only complete when the conquered no longer resent being conquered. The imperialism that particularly concerned Kisenge is what Jean Paul Sartre called “colonization of the mind” in his introduction to Franz Fanon’s Wretched of the Earth. (Grove Press, 1963)\n\nKisenge’s indictment of me and all missionaries as imperialists in disguise deserved and still deserves a response. I tried then and often since then to respond, but still don’t know how an imperialist like me should respond when caught in the act. I might have given up and gone home in the face of Kisenge’s critique, crossing back over the boundary between civilizations. I didn’t quit. I stayed in Africa, and I am glad I did.\n\nMy first defensive response to Kisenge missed the deep point at issue. In effect I claimed: “Maybe all those other people are imperialists, but not me; I’m different because I too hate imperialism”. I didn’t understand just how simple an answer that was. I didn’t understand how I took on the role of “imperialist” by trying to make Africans become like me. I thought my job as a teacher required me to help my students understand and identify with the whole package of ideas and traditions, the western Euro-American world view and history, that I brought to Africa.\n\nI had been invited by the Episcopal Church to teach African students, students from Liberia as well as students from several other about-to-be independent African countries. I would teach in a small American liberal arts college designed by an earlier generation of American missionaries and plopped in the midst of the African bush.\n\nThe only things African about Cuttington College were the landscape and where the students came from. About 1500 acres of prime village land were given by the late President Tubman to the Episcopal Church in 1948 as a site for the college which opened to a student body of four. It has grown from that small beginning to a university in 2012 with about 2000 students. Village people have complained over the years that Cuttington was a foreign institution which did nothing for them except take away their farm land, replacing traditional subsistence farming with low-paid employment as laborers. In itself this was economic imperialism, designed to use expendable human and material resources to train recruits into American culture.\n\nI had nothing to offer then except what I was and knew, and the only model I could imagine for myself was the that of an overeducated American polymath. I pride myself for being a “Renaissance man”, knowledgeable in physics, mathematics and western intellectual history, with a side offering of music. As a PhD-carrying believing Christian missionary, I could only offer myself. For students of mine to succeed in my classes they had to pass tests that I would devise, tests that measure conformity with the western Euro-American Christian society and culture that I carried with me.\n\nI might say in my defense that students were not forced to enter Cuttington College or the National University of Lesotho. Another defense might be that governments and institutions in the countries where I worked were to blame because they asked me to do a job for which they believed I have skills. I could say it was their choice, the choice of the students and institutions, to invite me to bring ideas and skills from outside their local culture, and thus inevitably change that culture. In short it was not my fault!\n\nOf course, that is a specious defense. Such students know that a western-type higher education is necessary if they are to take their place as leaders in the new Africa. They accepted me, but resented the fact that they had no alternative.\n\nI could have refused to impose my western ideas, but at that point in my career it would have meant packing up and going home to America to impose my ideas on Americans whose culture was my own. I am very glad I stayed in Africa and didn’t quit. That choice was to be the beginning of my education, an education which I hope helps me to be more than just an American polymath.\n\nWhat remained for me as I persisted in being an “imperialist” was to affirm and strengthen the students who asked my help, not just brainwash them. That did not initially resolve the paradox of being a hated but desired imperialist, but it was a step on an alternative and better path. People wanted what I supposedly could offer, even though the brighter ones among them knew they should resist being trapped by the cultural baggage I brought. For the time being, I could only offer the Euro-American culture that shaped me.\n\nMy first assignment was to be Dean of Instruction, to redesign and update the basic undergraduate curriculum. I thought then that I did an excellent job, but there was hardly anything African about the result. It was only after a few years that I pushed for introductory courses in African history to complement the western history course which was required for all students. Even so we reported African history through the lens of European and American scholarship. Some of the best scholars such as Basil Davidson did their best to see the rapidly changing continent through African eyes, but it took years before Africans themselves, scholars like Cheikh Anta Diop, could be recognized as authorities.\n\nThe battle for Africans to speak out about their continent, as opposed to Europeans and Americans speaking for them, was fought often in my career. Dr. Harry Ododa, a Kenyan who had graduated from Cuttington in the 1960s, returned to teach at Cuttington in 1971, and very soon showed his strong displeasure at having to share an African history course with me. He was in many ways right in his anger to find me speaking for Africa, even though I still think his complaints about my pro-western bias in grading the course were petty and vindictive.\n\nAnother case involved Dr. Paulus Mohome at the National University of Lesotho, where I was teaching African studies in 1979. Mohome was a combative and prickly Mosotho, with a doctorate in anthropology from the United States. He strongly disliked white people speaking about African history and anthropology, and had a serious argument with his student Fr. Michael Lapsley, a radical white Anglican priest deeply committed to the non-racial African National Congress. Mohome, who was equally committed to the PanAfricanist philosophy, gave Michael’s MA thesis a failing grade on the basis of his political persuasion. Michael was able to reverse the decision eventually, but it was another case of an Africanist scholar pushing aside a scholar from the white west. I learned recently that Mohome praised Negritude as “simply a reaffirmation of Negro Africa’s presence and the authenticity of his civilization” (Sertima, Ivan van, 1986: Great African Thinkers: Cheikh Anta Diop. Journal of African Civilizations, p. 93). Lapsley and I were doubtless in some way inauthentic.\n\nI was not sufficiently aware either in 1971 or in 1979 of the emotions which ran deep in these two scholars. As I look back I now can recognize the powerful anti-white, anti-European animus that Ododa and Mohome carried with them. The extent to which they were justified in their anger was something I could only much later begin to comprehend. They were speaking out of the same 1970s black nationalism that surfaced in the United States in the Black Power movement, and that was expressed in a more measured way by such scholars as Walter Rodney and Issa Shivji. I have used works by both authors in my classes, but I was not at that point ready to see how their work applied to me.\n\nAnother example. When I was working in agricultural development in Lesotho I was challenged by the radical left-wing author John Saul for writing what I thought was a fair-minded critique of a development project in Lesotho. He is not an African, but instead a Canadian social scientist, very much on the wavelength of the radical African-focused left wing. I heard indirectly that he found my comments on the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization to be weak and cowardly, avoiding the deep criticism implicit in my findings. I had compromised so that what I was telling the FAO might be more palatable. I did indeed temper my remarks, which were nowhere near as radical as they should have been. I failed to identify the deep issue, the imperialism that is colonization of the mind. I was still a white liberal, and did not dare look deeply into the radical demands of black Africa.\n\nUnderneath my liberal desire to break away from being an “imperialist” was still my desire to understand Africa in terms of my western intellectual and moral heritage. At the same time as I was struggling toward a reasonable and rational, but very western-centered, approach to development, I did not hear the voices which strongly denied what I stood for. For example, I attended a conference in Maseru in May 1976 organized by Lesotho’s King Moshoeshoe II, a conference which succeeded in bringing radical voices to the table. The Lesotho government, under the illegal and unconstitutional government of Leabua Jonathan, did not support the conference nor did the international agencies. In retrospect I am amazed that it was allowed to happen.\n\nAt the conference I heard an exciting speech by Albert Tevoedjre, a Beninois who spoke eloquently about the need for Africans to accept their poverty if they are ever to achieve real independence from the west. The radical educator Ivan Illich gave an impassioned speech advocating deschooling. School is a block to education in his view. He moved even farther to the left than Paole Freire. Illich was true to the radical spirit of the day in denouncing a young friend of mine for being what he called a “white nigger”. She was trying to live with Basotho at their level and understand how they survive. He accused her of simply being a do-good liberal, a stance which was anathema to him. She was deeply upset by the criticism and found it difficult to continue her work. I tried to comfort her and assure her she was doing a good thing in living the way she did.\n\nI did not understand what Illich was saying, any more than I understood Ododa or Mohome or John Saul or Albert Tevoedjre. I remained a white liberal, trying to control a world which was moving beyond me. All five of these men saw me and people like me as a worse enemy than the hard-core conservative defenders of western social and economic power. I am still what I am, a non-controversial liberal. I should have been someone different, someone more radical, but I don’t know how.\n\nIn what follows I will try to unfold the progress of my still incomplete education. In Liberia I had been only dimly aware of the social injustices that I had lived with on a day-to-day basis. I largely ignored that reality when my ostensible focus was to teach a mixed bag of subjects, on more or less any topic I thought I knew something about. Social conscience did help invigorate my work, but it was a secondary factor in helping students learn as much as possible of what I as an American could give them. The principal goal for many of these students was to enter graduate school in the USA or, if that failed, to get a good job in their own country. What made it possible for me to move beyond such mental colonization was my research which over time interested me more than preparing and giving lectures.\n\nIt is hard to assess in retrospect one’s motivation at a point in the past. I thought at first that my work in Liberia would be to teach a sophisticated and thoughtful Euro-centric version of Christian theology and history. Over the years in Liberia I was pushed to discover that my task instead was to help Africans discover for themselves what was true and false, important and unimportant. Kisenge pushed me to see that my real job was to help students find out from their own heritage what they needed to know and then move to a Christian affirmation of who they are and how they want to live. That led me to want to know more about their world, so that the education I helped them achieve would be more relevant to their lives.\n\nMy motivation at first had almost nothing to do with helping the poor, except to the extent that I hated the thought that an intelligent, hard-working but poor student could be prevented from achieving the best education possible. I was in the position of Dom Helder Camara in Brazil before he began to ask why the hungry have no food.\n\nI did not worry early in my career why so few students actually were able to attend Cuttington to get the education I was hired to give them. I didn’t then understand why Marxism was attractive to many people, including some of our students, even though I required all students to read The Communist Manifesto. Communism was for me an abstraction, a battle against western capitalism, but the enemy was still an abstraction, not the on-the-ground reality of poverty. As I offered my students an escape from personal poverty neither they nor I confronted the misery of the vast majority who could never dream of a college education. I fear, moreover, that neither Ododa nor Mohome understood why they objected to white liberals like me. Neither they nor I foresaw that the dispossessed in Liberia would rise up under a charismatic but deeply flawed Samuel Doe. The closest I came to that insight was when I lectured in the late 1960s on the ancien regime in France, reminding students that President Tubman enjoyed Louis Quinze furniture in his private apartment.\n\nMy enthusiasm for African liberation was thus largely political and theoretical. I announced my opposition to imperialism of any kind, including American economic and military domination, even though it took me a long time to find out in what ways I really was an imperialist.\n\nWhat I did not realize was the extent to which the liberation heroes, who were soon to become leaders of nations themselves, would all too often impose unjust governments on the very people who supported their quest for power. I didn’t realize that these leaders and their narrow group of associates would become the “citizens” who ruled over unwilling “subjects”, leaving them poor and without hope. Only a few, like Julius Nyerere and Nelson Mandela, seemed truly committed to economic as well as political democracy. A larger number of independence “heroes”, such as Kwame Nkrumah and Sekou Toure, made the correct noises, but proved to be tyrants. I don’t know what happened in the end to Shabani Kisenge, but do know that one of his fellow Tanganyikan students at Cuttington became a corrupt district commissioner in independent Tanzania.\n\nI hoped that the students we trained in Liberia, Liberians as well as students that came to study in Liberia from as far away as Sudan and Swaziland, would take positions of leadership and bring honesty and good government to their countries. I did not have a clear picture of what they might do, or of the obstacles they might meet in their nations as well as in their own lives. I had a naive faith in the power of education, supported by commitment to Jesus and his church, to bring into being the “wholesome functioning society” that President William R. Tolbert, Jr., envisaged before he succumbed to greed.\n\nI began to be aware of the inadequacy of my faith in enlightened self-interest when I read the book Growth without Development by Clower and colleagues (Northwestern University Press, 1966). I began to understand how the system which made it possible for us to teach in a reasonably free way also entrenched the economic and social stratification of Liberia that so clearly limited access to the education we offered. I did not fully realize the extent to which we promoted a system that created the elite and at the same time restricted access to it. We promoted political democracy, but did little to reduce the gap between rich and poor, in other words, very little to build economic democracy.\n\nAt the time I read Clower’s book I became increasingly aware of the inadequacies of the American presence overseas. Not only were we Americans fighting an unjust imperialist war in Vietnam, but our aid to Liberia was designed primarily to give the United States economic and political advantage. In the late 1960s I gave a talk to the wives of American embassy and USAID officials in which I pointed out just how small American assistance to Liberia was compared to what Liberia contributed financially and politically to the United States and to those who worked for it overseas. My speech enraged these good, patriotic women, and later their husbands, since it punctured the myth that we Americans were in Liberia only to do good for Liberia. They wanted to feel generous, while living very comfortable lives in Monrovia and putting away substantial salaries in the US.\n\nThe benefits from the training we gave did not accrue solely or even mainly to Liberia or later to Lesotho. The cost of training a university student in Africa is much lower than the cost of giving a comparable education in the United States. In fact a large part of such education is paid for by missionary organizations, USAID or other foreign bodies, and in many ways the American or other host government in the long run benefits by accepting these skilled migrants into their work force. What appears to be a generous donation to Liberia or some other African country by the United States in training university graduates has a long-term benefit for the USA, in short amounts to reverse aid.\n\nTrained Africans who move to the US provides foreign aid given by their home countries to the American economy, to the extent that they are trained abroad at very little cost. Even the most bare bones nursing education program in the United States costs three times as much as training a nurse in Liberia. Much of that cost is borne by Liberia. In the end the net economic benefit of a poor country which trains nurses that move abroad accrues to the rich country.\n\nDespite this pessimism I did leave some real benefits behind in Liberia. One benefit of the training we provided is an increased sensitivity and awareness of political and economic realities by our graduates. I imparted useful analytic skills to my students. I avoided giving answers, and avoided offering packaged content that students should memorize. It is not that I was against learning facts and figures. Rather I wanted the students to find the facts for themselves. Possibly the best course that I taught in Liberia was called “Man in the Modern World”, in which the students set the agenda and presented topics to each other They were expected to identify the issues and problems and opportunities they would face in the years to come. I have their reports, and someday I will read these African visions of their future.\n\nI also have on file the comments made by high school students at Bolahun in the far interior of Liberia in 1967, stating in detail how they understood their lives. I think that the task of analyzing their own lives, rather than having someone else do the analysis, helped the students think clearly who they are. One problem with these student-driven analyses is that they like me did not probe deeply into the economic injustice of society. They wanted to get ahead, not change the world. I am not sure I could have done more to give them a sense of the injustice in society. I was at that time too well integrated into the Liberian and the worldwide American-dominated society to understand what lay ahead for Liberia.\n\nThe underlying issue as I think over my career in Africa is this. To what extent did my work over40 years in Africa contribute more to my well-being and the well-being of the United States as a neo-colonial power than to Africa?\n\nWhat would have to be entered in the balance sheet? There would be some positive entries, notably that students were equipped for graduate studies and good jobs. Their extended families could count on support. Every employed African sends remittances back to her or his family. It is generally acknowledged that migrant remittances to developing countries exceed foreign aid. Most students I taught at Cuttington have contributed to their families and their country. I was told that three-quarters of my students eventually studied, lived and worked in the United States. I know that most of these send money back home.\n\nThe minority who remained in Liberia to work have often become leaders in the nation and serious providers for their families. Of course a few became corrupt, earning large sums as they drained the country dry. But others were like my student Dr. Walter Gwenigale who served as a surgeon in rural Liberia during the worst of the civil war and is now Minister of Health in the Liberian government.\n\nDespite the contributions of many of our graduates to Liberia and its people, the college never did pay the debt it owes to the rural community within which it lives. One of the earliest degree programs was in agriculture, but by the time I had come to Cuttington students no longer enrolled in the course. Students continued to train as teachers, but the numbers went down year by year. The program that did most for the rural area was the nursing program, a joint degree with Phebe Hospital located just a mile from the campus.\n\nWhat never did take root was an emphasis on rural development as such. It is true we insisted that all students in the social sciences do a senior research project, and the great majority of these projects related to rural development. However, very few of the students other than teachers or nurses chose to work in the rural area after graduation. In particular, those who studied economics sought graduate degrees, and either remained abroad or returned to work in Monrovia.\n\nCuttington started a Rural Development Institute in 1980, but the Institute did not sink deep roots into the rural community. The course offered a certificate, not a degree, but most students tried to use the certificate as a way into the regular degree program. Many failed even to get a certificate. The Institute was a good idea but it did not mesh with the ambitions of students who wanted salaried office jobs, not practical skills which would help them be better farmers.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge no program in Africa has been seriously committed over the long to run hands-on betterment of rural life. The closest I know was the Botswana Brigades, designed by the South African radical Patrick van Rensburg to train skilled artisans. Even his program was forced to emphasize certificates and government-recognized qualifications. Vocational schools of a more academic nature than the Brigades have sprung up all over the continent, but most shifted quickly to the official status-driven conformity that killed the Brigades. It is unfair of me to sit at my computer in 2011 and rail against what I and so many other people did. We simply and sadly succumbed to the spirit of the age.\n\nCHAPTER 3. CASSANDRA IN LIBERIA\n\nMy forty years in Africa benefitted me, my family and my country, while providing some skills and knowledge to my students and research colleagues. I recognize my deep failure to eschew the imperialism Kisenge complained about. My work did little to overcome hunger, provide jobs and create harmonious communities, or to prevent a slide into corruption and dependence on foreign ideas and largesse. I am sure I insisted on doing things my way instead of the “African way” (whatever that might be).\n\nHowever, as I look back at the books, articles and reports I wrote during that time I find some hope. I foresaw some important problems with missionary and development work, and I gave recommendations that would suggest a way forward. In a way I was being Cassandra, because few people took my ideas seriously. It may be foolish for me to identify with that sad heroine, but the temptation is strong.\n\nWho was Cassandra? She was a beautiful Greek woman who spent a night in the temple of the god Apollo. As a reward for her beauty, and perhaps expecting a night of love, Apollo gave her the gift of foreseeing the future. It seems she refused his love, and so he added to the gift of foresight the curse that no one would believe her. In this instance, she correctly predicted the disaster that would befall everyone during the Trojan War, but no one listened.\n\nI would be arrogant and wrong if I say “I told you so” about the failure of the dream of a new Africa. This was a dream I excitedly hoped for when Judy and I and our children arrived in Liberia in December 1958. However, I soon saw ways in which imperialist missionaries (like me) in league with power-hungry African leaders (like our students) would derail the development process.\n\nI described the excitement of those first years at Cuttington College in my books A Letter to My Children (Morija Press Lesotho, 1999) and Africa: a Dream Deferred (New World Africa Press, 2004. I spoke of the dream in my Matriculation Address on African science to the student body at Cuttington at the opening of the academic year in February 1960. Hinting at the ideas expressed by Martin Bernal in his 1987 book Black Athena (Rutgers University Press, 1987) and Cheikh Anta Diop in his 1989 book The African Origin of Civilization: Myth or Reality, (Lawrence Hill Books, 1989) I urged the students to see their African heritage, indeed their very African-ness, as a guide to their future as they shaped the new Africa. I showed how abstract science had first been invented in Egypt, and suggested that our students could be fully African intellectuals without having to yield place to Europe and America. I was urging the very stance that Kisenge and Ododa, among others, said my teaching and research stifled.\n\nI continued to urge independent creativity in my 1963 article “Higher Education in Tropical Africa” for the journal African Affairs. I argued that African universities should free themselves from the heavy legacy of colonialism. State-run universities across newly independent Africa were firmly restricted by being replicas of European institutions. In 1960 the leading tropical African universities were the University of Dakar, the University of Lovanium in Congo, Fourah Bay College in Sierra Leone, the University College of the Gold Coast, Ibadan University in Nigeria and Makerere University in Uganda. In my article I urged that independence and creativity can better be realized in small lightly encumbered colleges, taking advantage of church-based non-governmental freedom to teach and innovate, free from the heavy hand of European academia.\n\nCuttington College was founded in 1948 as a small American type college set in the remote interior of Liberia. It was not burdened by cohorts of civil servants and administrators. Instead it relied on a small band of young, admittedly American-trained, teachers who wanted to respond directly to the need for higher education in a rural population. I joined the college ten years after it was founded, attracted by the hope that we might help shape the new Africa that was still to be born. We did not need to satisfy the dons at Cambridge or the Sorbonne. We were ahead of the curve in gradually adding courses on African literature and African history, even though only as additions to a basic American liberal arts college curriculum.\n\nI fear that my enthusiasm for African innovation in higher education was not accepted elsewhere in Africa until the new millennium. Only then did a few small private colleges and universities begin to spring up, for example in Kenya and Zimbabwe. However, their model, as also the model of Cuttington College, was the American liberal arts college. What Kisenge and Ododa wanted was something more radical, namely a truly African institution of higher learning. I suppose such radicalism was not then politically or socially possible. I didn’t understand the full implications of my matriculation address, nor do I think that either Kisenge or Ododa realized the implications of their critique. I and they kept to the American model, not realizing that imposing the American pattern of higher education is also “colonization of the mind”.\n\nMy teaching and research at Cuttington were not constrained by the rigid standards of American or European universities. This helped free me to think creatively. Over the years I designed courses in history, philosophy, religion and government which moved out of the conventional molds, although still very American in underlying ethos. It may be, however, that by thinking and working totally “out of the box”, I lost the chance to establish myself as a person to be listened to. Of course, what I did may simply not have been good enough or well enough packaged to make a major impact. Perhaps I am simply mistaken in thinking of myself as Cassandra, whereas in fact I was merely a misguided academic trying to do the impossible.\n\nMy first major venture was designing a radical alternative in the teaching of mathematics from kindergarten up to university. I taught a first year course in basic mathematics at Cuttington, using the then fashionable set theory to develop mathematical concepts. The idea was good, but I fear that the execution was poor. These proposals for a radical revolution in the teaching of mathematics did not have the effects I wished. Very few of my students understood what I was talking about and most simply wrote it off as an exercise in intellectual juggling. One or two understood the inner meaning of mathematics but the rest were simply baffled. I am still convinced that teaching in Africa must get away from repetition and rote memory, but this effort was not a success.\n\nIn a further experiment I moved to the other extreme, namely, the education of the child. I reacted strongly against educators writing textbooks for African teachers using Western concepts. Instead I wanted to the curriculum and teaching methods to be centered squarely within local culture.\n\nTheologians call this inculturation, by which they mean translating the contents of theology firmly into the local culture. The contents are universal, but the cultural setting is not. I had a clear vision of mathematics in a new incarnation, locally relevant. It would be fully African while keeping the central content of a mathematics curriculum that has no cultural identity of its own. As a would-be Cassandra, I looked ahead and saw a future in mathematics education closely tied to African realities on the ground. My vision of mathematics in Africa still has not become a reality.\n\nI still honestly believe I was right, even in the first year university math course which almost no one in my student body understood or appreciated. I believe I was right in encouraging the use of intellectually solid instruction materials for first grade children and for future teachers. The problem was that my efforts were largely a failure.\n\nI have on my bookshelf the two-volume textbook I helped write for teachers in training during summer workshops in Uganda in 1963 and 1964 working with the African Education Programme of Educational Services Incorporated, supported by the Ford Foundation and other groups. I like what I wrote, but I also know that the book was never actually used in teacher training colleges and is never likely to be used. Textbooks for African schools, just like textbooks in the United States, are part of a major industry that is controlled by the big publishing houses.\n\nI did hope that the mathematics textbooks I helped write those two summers in Uganda would help children go farther in school, no longer held back by poor instructional materials. Yet the project did not work out as I had hoped. Teachers found the “new mathematics” difficult, and students reacted instinctively against it. Part of the problem was that we were too extreme, too austere, in our desire to bring “pure” mathematics into the classroom and dress it in African clothing. Bad as it was, the “old mathematics” had served its purpose over the years of giving the majority mechanical skills needed for ordinary life and the minority a door through which they could pass if they wanted at some point to do real mathematics. We tried to help all students but the system rejected us.\n\nMore deeply, the Liberians with whom we worked and who were responsible for curriculum revision didn’t accept the idea of rooting mathematics in an alternative cultural setting. Two Liberians, earnest math teachers, joined me in Uganda. I did not work closely with either of them, another example of my inability at this stage in my career to build my ideas in collaboration with Africans. I worked largely on my own, and marched to my own tune and drumbeat. These two colleagues never really understood or accepted the need for change.\n\nWhat they really wanted was for graduates of Liberian schools to be thoroughly weaned from their village culture. Probably the majority of the students wanted the same thing. They saw the bright lights of the city and the material rewards of western civilization, and compared them with what they saw at home. They did not see village life in the same way as I began to see it, as still fresh and alive, an alternative to the dreary slums of Monrovia and back-breaking labor of tapping rubber. I believed, and somehow I still believe, that people can learn better when the cultural context of what they study is familiar. And yet the pull of the bright lights of the city and the push away from the dark nights of the village were then and now irresistible.\n\nThe conventional texts simply do not face the serious difficulties African children and African teachers have in mathematics. Unfortunately what we did to change the system was largely a failure. Perhaps our failure was anticipated by Kisenge and Ododa. They would point out that such an approach was my vision, not the vision of Africans, and so was unacceptable.\n\nI wonder in retrospect if admiring the mathematical roots of traditional culture is also a type of romanticism. Whether we were right or wrong in trying to root mathematics education in African village soil is somehow irrelevant. It didn’t work. All we proved was that African peoples are as capable of learning as Europeans and Americans, each in their own settings. What we did not take into account was the demise of the African traditional setting.\n\nIf our efforts would not succeed in improving mathematics education in the schools, then perhaps they could help bring mathematical literacy to people who still did live in the old way. I was asked by a wonderful woman, Ma Miller to prepare an adult literacy course for Kpelle adults, using what we learned in our research. She printed the books and then helped village teachers use the books. The project sank like a stone, and I believe I have on my bookshelf the only remaining copies of those pamphlets. The failure might have resulted from poor implementation of the project, but I think it more likely failed because it did not meet anyone’s real needs or desires.\n\nI wrote articles on both university and elementary mathematics which were printed in the West African Journal of Education. I am sure that neither of these articles found an audience. The ideas were too far out, too different from the conventional wisdom of the day. As I see these ideas today, the major drawback was that, like the new mathematics curriculum, they were my ideas, not ideas developed in cooperation with African scholars. In effect I was telling Africans “This is how to be African”, and for that very reason they did not buy my ideas.\n\nI was more successful as a university teacher. In particular I developed a course in which African and European histories were set side by side. The course was a largely interdisciplinary course, with readings drawn from as many primary sources as I could identify. First and second year students at Cuttington read works by such classic European authors as Plato, Aeschylus, Augustine, Chaucer, Hobbes, Voltaire and Marx. They also read African authors, including Blyden, Kenyatta, Achebe and Nkrumah. Where possible we used books written by Africans. The course was largely successful, and many of my students continue to thank me for what we learned together.\n\nI tried hard to understand more about Africa and Africans as I worked in Liberia. It was tempting to do that, as I had done in the history courses, mainly by reading books and discussing them with the students. Fortunately another way in which I moved forward was to engage the students in real dialogue about the world, and in particular about their own cultures. It was hard to persuade some of the less mature students to think for themselves. It may be that making them speak their own thoughts rather than just repeat my words was more important than the content of what I taught them.\n\nI remember one student, a small rather meek girl, who asked me at the end of a class “When will you tell us the answers?” I told her “Never”, which was a bit harsh. I meant it, because I wanted my students to figure out for themselves what kind of world they live in and what kind of world they want to make. I suppose that was one of the positive aspects of my set-based introduction to mathematics. I did not reward repetition and memorization. I wanted thinking, but unfortunately on my terms, not their terms.\n\nIn my history classes I required the students to make presentations on class topics, and I sat in the back monitoring them. I intervened at the end of student presentations to add substance to what they said, but I’m sure that they learned more by having to say it themselves than by listening to me. I organized student debates on issues, so that students could share views that were contrary both to each other’s views and to my view. I know that some faculty members would have preferred me simply to stand up and state the truth as I saw it, and then let students regurgitate what they learned on the exams.\n\nI did require, of course, some objective knowledge. I made sure that students could read maps and could locate important geographic features and settings. I also required them to know when the events I considered important happened in history, by giving tests in which students had to give rough dates but also state which events took place before or after other events. When I tested knowledge of the map and the history time line, I allowed the students several chances to pass the test. Those who failed once or twice could come back and try again. Students were required eventually pass the objective test. This allowed me to assess student performance on the basis of overall understanding and clarity of participation. Their grade was not simply based on the extent to which they could reproduce what I told them in class. Some students objected, preferring the old method of listen and repeat, probably because that is easier than having to think for themselves.\n\nOne class in which I really did have a vision of what education could and should be was a class in African philosophy. The students read articles and books on African religion and philosophy, but what I really wanted was for them to state what they believed to be African belief. I pushed them hard to develop generalizations on African thought. Over the course of teaching the course three times, the students, from several different African countries, prepared a formidable list of African generalizations, using the books they read and their own experience. I think this is the way philosophy should be formulated, but it is rarely done that way.\n\nA required senior course entitled “Man in the Modern World” drew on the students’ experiences about the problems they would face when they graduate. Parenthetically, neither I nor the women in the class realized we should refine the word “man” to include all human beings. Each student produced a notebook expressing her or his views on the nature of life, the world, morality and God. I tried not to impose ideas on them, and to some extent I succeeded.\n\nThe overall outline of the course was designed by the students in cooperation with me. The students were divided into groups of about four each, and these groups stayed together throughout the semester. Each group prepared a list of topics, and then presented their lists to the whole class, which then decided the actual course outline.\n\nThe issues that most concerned the students as they prepared for graduation were choosing what kind of work to do, how to get a job, whether to go to graduate school, their economic prospects for the future, their hopes for marriage and family life, and their relation to the larger society including their own extended family. For many students the extended family is a serious issue, particularly because they may well be the first in their family to get a higher education. I remember one student saying that he hoped to live and work far away from his home, so that he would not be forced to share his house with many poor relatives.\n\nOne student prepared a short radio drama which made the problem very clear. Two graduates were looking for the same job. One was an Americo-Liberian named Jeremy Future-Bright. The other was an up-country boy named Flumo. Jeremy was given the job through connections, and the up-country boy was told to go back to school to learn more.\n\nSome students expressed an interest in religion, morality, politics and public life, but not at the same level as an interest in their own personal expectations for the future. Very few if any indicated a strong interest in “saving the world”. There was little idealism, little apparent hope that they might make a major impact on an unjust, poverty-stricken society. Most students were Christian, although a small minority was Muslim, but going out to preach the gospel or spread the good news of Jesus Christ was simply not their issue. That paralleled my experience on the campus, where chapel attendance was generally very low.\n\nStudents spoke freely about sexuality. I did not try to impose my views, although I was not ashamed to admit what I believe. There was a strong undercurrent among the men that polygamy, whether formal or informal, is a sensible option. Many of them wanted the freedom to enjoy sexual experience both within and outside marriage. The question of homosexuality did arise, with little overt objection on the part of students.\n\nWhat I liked most about the course was the interaction of students with each other and with me, as they wrestled with personal issues they would face in the future. The small groups were responsible for bringing back ideas to the whole group, and were subject to criticism and debate from the members of the other groups. To that extent the course was an exercise in democracy, although I did keep overall control by trying to bring their ideas together into a consistent framework. At the end of each semester we shared dinner together in a nearby village, away from the main campus, where students could relax a bit but also talk openly about the course and about the big issues.\n\nI have kept copies of my lectures, which I distributed to the students. These lectures did not just represent my views, but incorporated many of the discussions we held in class. I didn’t just report what the students said in class, but I mixed their views with my own ideas. I would strongly recommend this approach to anyone teaching a course in ethics or politics or religion, namely, speak out boldly but do so only in response to felt needs of the students. As I look back I think this course may well have been one of my most productive activities as a teacher in Africa. I was able to learn who the students are, what they know and what they believe, and what difference that would make in the lives they were about to live after graduation.\n\nI was heartened by comments from students, some saying the real value of the course lay in their chance to talk seriously with each other about major issues. Some reactions were:\n\n“For the first time we looked at each other straight in the eye and made contact…I saw, through the individual masks, the true persons.”\n\n“It is only when one interacts closely with others, that he becomes known to them.”\n\n“I felt somewhat ill when I learned you were teaching Religion 491. I really had given up. Now, through dialogue, etc., you have revealed part of your personage to me. I really learned a lot about others also in this course.”\n\n“Here was a course which, instead of being theoretical and full of highly improbable concepts as most, if not all, of my other courses, was practical and dealt with the living realities of man and the societies he creates.”\n\n“I have been thinking seriously about starting an organization called Man in the Modern World where youths of our generation can come to discuss some of the problems that face them in the world in which they live.”\n\nMy hope for that course is that the openness and frank speech which we shared in the class would find its place in the lives the students lived after they graduated. They were forced to confront each other as real human beings, all facing the same problems, although with very different resources and prospects. The society they were to enter was in many ways sick. I hope that this course helped them to understand both the sickness and the actions they might take to make the country more honest and fair for all.\n\nI know that this course never became a model after I left Cuttington. It was my idea, my plan and my procedure. The course design did not emerge from shared conversation with the Liberian administration of the college. What I did went against the grain. I don’t apologize for my being who I am, always against the grain. My mistake was that I was not patient enough to plan with others and bring them along with me to adopt a new way of teaching. I saw the future, and I knew that what I was doing was the right way to proceed. In the end, because they were a captive audience, my students listened and even enjoyed the course. But none of them have gone and done likewise. They did not own the idea. In short, I was Cassandra.\n\nMy research outside the classroom was equally designed to learn who Africans are for themselves, rather than just impose outside ideas on them. My focus in Liberia was the Kpelle people, who had been discussed and talked about for much of the 20th century by scholars, and even to some extent by Benjamin Anderson in the mid-19th century, when he went to visit them on his trip to Musardu. I wanted to listen as carefully as I could to the Kpelle themselves, and let them speak for themselves. In most of my research, however, in contrast with my teaching at Cuttington, I tried to avoid mixing my ideas with what I learned about the people, even though I continued to hope for constructive change in rural Liberia.\n\nYakpalo Dong, a Kpelle man of about my age, worked with me as a translator and teacher, and told me his life story. I am grateful to him for helping me sense the insecurity in the rural Kpelle village when threatened by competing hostile powers. For Yakpalo, survival under such conditions requires reliance on what one can see for oneself, and on a social system headed by a hopefully trustworthy family head, village elder – or God.\n\nI was never able to build a narrative out of Yakpalo’s writings. I wish I had been able to do so. For the time being, the original Kpelle stories are in the library at the University of Indiana. I hope someone else, ideally a Kpelle person who understands both worlds, can explore more deeply the world Yakpalo inhabited. The important point is that the story of rural Liberia has to be told by rural Liberians, as nearly free from American input as possible.\n\nOne of my greatest failings in Liberia, and later in Lesotho, was my inability to learn the local language. Yakpalo did his best to teach me Kpelle, but I fear I was never able to think in Kpelle or later in Sesotho. I am sure that Kisenge and Ododa understood that point, understood that I could only think in ways shaped by my American culture, language and determination to think and act in those terms.\n\nI wrote my first novel, and subsequent novels, to tell in my own weak way who are the Kpelle and how they have entered the new and changing world of Liberia. I would like to believe that my admittedly inadequate response to Yakpalo’s personal failure to reconcile tradition and the new modern world was to tell the story of a family buffeted by both worlds. I have to admit that my audience was initially American. But soon I came to realize that my real audience is Liberians and ultimately Kpelle. Specifically, I hope my Kpelle friends may use my books to learn who they once were.\n\nI immersed myself in my memory and notes, expanded and enlarged by documents I collected over my time both in Liberia and afterwards. The reviewer of my first novel Red Dust on the Green Leaves (InterCulture Associates, 1973) caught me in the act by guessing that I laid my notes out on the table and wrote the book from the notes. Well done, Rich Fulton! By reinforcing my memory with documents and on-the-spot written records I made a serious effort to escape my own skin and inhabit the hearts and minds of many gracious and helpful Kpelle people.\n\nI wanted the words my characters used and the scenes they saw to be theirs and not mine. I did not include the local color that an American would notice about climate or rainfall or forest. Rather I tried to see the forest, the bush, the towns, the road, the shops, the schools and even the city as Kpelle fresh from their rural home would see them. I have been very pleased to hear Liberians tell me “This is my story”. I was even more pleased that my colleague John Kellemu absolved me of the possible crime of revealing too much about the secret society. In the end I am glad to assess this and the following three novels, The Brightening Shadow(InterCultural Press, 1980), Long Day’s Anger (New World African Press, 2004), and The Return (hopefully in press), probably my most useful contributions to the African Renaissance.\n\nAn essential first step toward my understanding the Kpelle was a long and detailed account of the uses of mathematics and logic in the Kpelle language. I was helped by UCLA linguist Bill Welmers to show how the differences between the logic implied by Kpelle and English are reflected in the teaching of mathematics and language. We tried to show how the deep structure of language, along the lines that Noam Chomsky explained, is realized in the Kpelle language in its own ways. I am pleased with the book we wrote, and am even more pleased that scholars, themselves of Kpelle origin, have found the book useful.\n\nMuch later I wrote a proposal for a radical revision of the Cuttington curriculum and program, to be implemented after the civil war. I wanted the focus to be on rural development and on the total community around the college. I gave examples of how the curriculum should build from the needs of the community, with economics as a case study. I wanted the college to abandon the top-down approach to teaching that was so common. I knew the right way to proceed, but I was not able to work with Liberians to implement the idea. Once again I was Cassandra, in that I could see what was needed and what would happen if it were not implemented, but to no avail.\n\nI wrote a proposal for a general survey of what survived the war. Byron Tarr and the late Canon Burgess Carr shared in writing the first draft, but I fear the ideas were driven by me, and never fully owned by my Liberian colleagues. In it I proposed building a new Liberia in which Monrovia was no longer the center of development. Monrovia is an economic sink, and the country would do much better to develop the rural areas and forget Monrovia.\n\nMy most recent effort to bring change to Liberian education and research was in 2009 when I was invited to Liberia to give the keynote address to the Liberian Studies Association meeting. I spoke from the heart about going where the people are to do research. The title “Wikipedia, Google and the ‘safe, soft grassy streets of Monrovia’ do not equal research” was drawn from Benjamin Anderson’s 1868 book Journey to Musardu (Frank Cass,1971), in which he complained that no young men from Monrovia were willing to join him in his expedition. They preferred to stay home and not risk the dangers of the interior of Liberia. I urged today’s Liberian scholars to go where the people and the problems are real and urgent, no matter whether urban or rural. I am afraid that my talk fell on deaf ears. Once again I was Cassandra, warning of the consequences of ignoring the reality on the ground.\n\nFew Liberian scholars have done serious field research. Fortunately, I have recently joined forces with five Liberians who do care and have gone to the people. Perhaps I am finally coming to my senses and collaborating with Africans at a deep level. I have been welcomed into a group projecting where the country could be in 2030. I am grateful to Alfred Kulah, Elwood Dunn, Konia Kollenlon, Byron Tarr and Amos Sawyer, for letting me work with them. Finally perhaps Kisenge and Ododa will accept me.\n\nCHAPTER 4. INDIGENOUS LIFE IN RURAL LIBERIA\n\nMy studies of cognition among the Kpelle ethnic group in Liberia grew from my conviction that Liberian schoolchildren are ordinary, normal, energetic, bright-eyed youngsters, and thus should be able to learn mathematics as well as any child anywhere. Since this was obviously not the case, I tried to find out why. My first guess was that school textbooks were written from an alien perspective. This idea was consistent with my belief that our job as foreign teachers was not to dump a lot of western knowledge of people, but to let them learn from within their own cultures and lives. I found a rich strain of mathematical knowledge, logic and behavior, all of which grew out of children’s village and community lives. But I did not yet identify failure to use the cultural context with material deprivation growing out of an unjust social system.\n\nWhy was I so unaware? My initial encounter with village life was with a social and economic system that made a great deal of sense. I was reacting against my own culture, which was partly why I moved to Africa after finishing my doctorate. I found village life in the nearby villages of Sinyee and Balama attractive and interesting. I probably fell into the trap of romanticizing village life and culture, setting it over against the artificial over-civilized life I had left behind in America. I knew that the Kpelle lacked the comforts of American life, lacked good medical care, lacked “book”, as Liberians would say. Nonetheless, I found what I saw both intriguing and impressive. Early on I began to appreciate African sculpture and music, and I knew it was different from and in some ways richer than our western art.\n\nThe upshot was that I ignored the suffering, the hunger, the disease, and other patent inequalities between village life and the life I and my student helpers lived. I did not yet tap into the resentment that people felt, although I should have begun to experience it when I saw children from Sinyee waiting for the rice and “soup” left over from student meals to be thrown out from the college dining hall at noon and evening. I should have understood more deeply why these same children eagerly gnawed on bones tossed into the grass when Cuttington students partied away their Saturday nights at the college auditorium. I was not yet able to make the connection between the Marxist and other liberation literature that proclaimed decolonization and the lives of people in my own backyard.\n\nIn the cases of mathematics learning, as I have discussed above, I was dazzled by the cognitive, mathematical and scientific skills I found when Mike Cole and others helped me do research, both in Sinyee and Balama and in Gbansu. I did not realize that these skills were not being put to work to help rural Liberians make fuller use of the resources, environmental and cognitive, they possessed. I didn’t ask the reason, but instead accepted it as a given. Our books The New Mathematics and an Old Culture (Holt, Rkinehart and Winston, 1967) and The Cultural Context of Learning and Thinking (Basic Books, 1971) were successes for us, but did not move people in a new direction in Liberia.\n\nMy next venture was research into subsistence farming as practiced in Liberia. A few years later I would do a similar study in Lesotho. If I finally began to ask why the hungry have no food, then perhaps the way to begin would be to understand life in a village which was part of the “old Africa”. I had studied mathematics in Gbansu and knew just how smart village people are. I thus believed that traditional farmers were also smart and that the effort to improve farm production in African countries would benefit from understanding the social context of the traditional farming methods that preceded the new commercial agriculture.\n\nIt turned out in the end that I was right in thinking the old farming methods made sense. The village of Gbansu with its 25 satellite hamlets was viable, and could continue to feed its people. People in the village were not hungry and children seemed generally well-fed, although I realized quite quickly that poor health was endemic, with malaria and intestinal parasites the main problems\n\nI didn’t realize, however, that community-level self-sufficiency in food depended on finding ways for surplus population to leave the village, to insure that farmland would be sufficient for the population who stayed behind. Land can only be ample if the population growing food on that land is small enough to prevent overuse. The obvious question is: how can the population be kept in line with the resources to provide a livelihood to those who remain?\n\nHow do villages like Gbansu control population? It is mostly through disease and death. Medical care for the diseases which were so common in the village was minimal. Most people knew basic remedies for routine ailments, depending on traditional healers who had very limited skills. The nearest western clinic was eight hours walk from Gbansu on a rough forest path, or four hours and an expensive bus ride on the nearest motor road. That clinic gave only basic western medical care, and even then the cost for the simplest treatment was beyond the means of village people. The result was a simple but effective population control. People died who might have lived if they had modern medical care.\n\nAnother form of population control is for people to find jobs outside the village. About 10% of the population at the time we lived there was working away from Gbansu. Most were tapping rubber at Firestone, but some found better-paying jobs in Monrovia or in the towns along the main roads. One or two who succeeded outside bought land in the village to plant coffee, rubber and cocoa, but this had the effect of reducing overall food production in the village\n\nThird, children and young adults want to attend school. Gbansu had a very poor elementary school, with minimally trained teachers and almost no facilities, and so young people who could do so went to stay with relatives outside the village. Inevitably a child who hoped to receive more than two or three grades of basic literacy would have to leave Gbansu, and many did. More than 90% of the young adults in Gbansu said they wished to live outside the village, but without a good education the only work they could find was tapping rubber trees. Thus education was clearly recognized as the way to escape the hard work of subsistence agriculture. Unfortunately, economic analysis has shown that a minimum of a good high school diploma is necessary if the expenditure in time and money on schooling is to pay off with a good job.\n\nThe result was clear. Subsistence rice farming in such a remote inaccessible village could continue to be productive because people died or young people moved away, leaving a controlled population in balance with natural resources. The village farming system in Gbansu was impressive and life-enhancing, but it depended on a stable population. I wrote an enthusiastic report on agriculture in Gbansu, and urged experts from the Liberian government and foreign aid agencies to learn from what worked there. In the report I failed to stress that the system could only work if population matched resources.\n\nI clearly saw the problem when I flew from Cuttington to Gbansu during the rice-growing season, and saw how farms along the road were a sickly yellow color, while the farms several hours walk away from the road were a rich dark healthy green. Crops grew well in Gbansu because the land was not overworked. Yields were poor along the main road where those who failed to find work or get a good education struggled to grow rice in the traditional slash-and-burn way, without letting the land rest for the customary 7-10 years between crops. To recommend taking the Gbansu approach to farming seriously was in effect to recommend serious birth control.\n\nThe way forward for young people who left the land was hard. During the 1990s, after the murder of President Tolbert by Samuel Doe, Liberia went downhill in almost every way. There were fewer jobs and fewer places in school while the population grew. Liberia achieved the dismal record during Doe’s presidency of fewer children in school every year. A social disaster that followed was the 1989 to 2003 civil war. I don’t like to say it, but it almost seems that mutual blood-letting was the third major way Liberians could bring down their surplus population. Roughly a quarter million people, out of a population of three million, may have died in the war. Peoples who lived in a precarious balance with nature for centuries now died from a form of population control of their own making. Some say that the world may find that permanent war, often over resources, will be a basic future means of keeping population down.\n\nWhat was the value of all the work I did in Gbansu? I tried to understand the customary farming system, as it fit into what remained of a centuries-old way of life. I felt that understanding the system would help agricultural development in Liberia. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations asked me to look at traditional farming methods, so that experts might suggest new ways forward. I did my job, and wrote an extensive report on village agriculture as a way of life. I collected samples of more than 100 varieties of rice which village women knew were appropriate to soil, weather and time of year.\n\nMy efforts went nowhere. No one then or since has been interested in what I found as a way to do what I had hoped. Only those with a similar possibly antiquarian interest found the paper to be worth reading. My feelings were naturally hurt, and I wanted to attribute the lack of interest to western imperialistic bull-headed insensitivity. That is clearly not the whole story. I would have done something better if I had joined radical Liberian economists like Dr. Tokpa Nah Tipoteh whose organization Susukuu was formed in 1971, in order to help rural farmers and workers. I did not think of working with them, and I am sure I could have produced a more useful report with their cooperation. Again, my problem was one of being a lone voice, and lone voices are rarely heard. Being a Cassandra may be a self-inflicted wound.\n\nCHAPTER 5. DISCOVERING A NEW COUNTRY LESOTHO\n\nAfter my year at Cambridge University, during which I wrote up my Liberian results and also taught a course in social psychology advocating culturally sensitive ways of people-centered development, I was asked by FAO to do a similar job in Lesotho. I was to join the Senqu River rural development project to help villagers improve their farm production in cooperation with foreign experts. I was hired to explain the project to the people, but in fact I spent much of my time trying to explain the skills and attitudes of local people to the foreign experts. There was a huge cognitive, technical and cultural gap between villagers and the FAO development workers.\n\nJust as rural Liberia, Lesotho suffered from population growth. 19th century Lesotho was like Gbansu in the sense that land was plentiful and fertile, and the population was small. In the 1870s and 1880s Lesotho exported grain to South Africa, and farmers made a reasonable living, until white South Africans began to import grain from abroad. After the British took over Lesotho as a protectorate, Basotho were forced to pay hut taxes to pay for the Pax Britannica. Men had to find work in the newly opened gold mines in order to pay the tax. Moreover, in the 20th century population growth, due in large part to good church-based medical facilities, led to a reduction in land available for farming, as villages and towns expanded to eat up good farm land.\n\nUp to independence in 1966, land use and population in Lesotho remained in precarious balance. Men brought home wages from the mines, while their wives and children who stayed behind tried to feed themselves. After independence, however, the balance began to shift. Population growth meant that fewer families every year had access to the traditional allotment of three fields for their maize, sorghum and bean crops. By the 1970s grain production in Lesotho in fact dropped below the FAO standard of 180 kg per person, requiring increased imports of food, whether by purchase from South Africa or by food aid from international donors. Population in Lesotho, as in Liberia, had outstripped local capacity for food self-sufficiency.\n\nThe Senqu project tried to bring people together into group farms or livestock management associations. The technical ideas of the experts behind this cooperative consolidation made good sense, but the people were not persuaded. Perhaps they should have been persuaded, given the deteriorating quality of the land, the increasing population and the consequent growth in numbers of livestock.\n\nThe problem is that the people who lived in the villages did not believe in the new methods, and so even when they were implemented, in most cases by top-down decree, the efforts failed. A careful audit found that 14 of the 15 consolidated groups of farmers and their fields lost money the first year. It is probable that they did so because the local people didn’t understand the systems imposed upon them, didn’t like losing their autonomy, and thus dragged their feet in implementing project goals.\n\nSimilarly the village people did not want to accept group management of sheep, goats and cattle. Their own customary methods of managing livestock left much to be desired, but were an integral part of a way of life that sent young boys into the mountains and foothills to manage flocks and herds, before sending them to the South African gold mines to enter the next stage of manhood. It is true that the Basotho system of managing grazing land was inefficient and destructive, but it was their system. A few range management associations were started in the course of my time in Lesotho, but they were mainly created by wealthy educated livestock owners for whom the new system made economic, even though perhaps not social, sense\n\nI wrote an extensive report which satisfied nobody, not even me. I tried to show what was wrong with the existing FAO system and tried to make suggestions for ways in which FAO could meet the villagers halfway. It did not satisfy the FAO. It did not satisfy the villagers. And, it did not satisfy the left wing Marxist critics of agricultural development in Africa who saw that in fact what FAO was doing was creating a captive labor force that would produce crops and livestock for the international capitalist market. Dom Helder Camara asked why people are hungry. I had not answered that question to anyone’s satisfaction and I had not helped the project move forward.\n\nAlmost all my recommendations in the report were contingent on a fundamental finding, namely, that only a small minority of people in the area actually liked farming and wanted to do it well. Most of the people we interviewed saw farming as an unpleasant but necessary chore. They saw a much bigger world outside the village, the world of consumer goods, jobs and money. A large proportion of male household heads worked in the South African mines and brought home money and consumer goods, as well as cattle, important not only for plowing but also for social reasons. Bride wealth required the gift of cattle, at least 10 before marrying a woman from the commoner class, and up to 22 cattle for royalty.\n\nWhen I started work in Lesotho in1976 the majority of men worked in South Africa, leaving the women to maintain the farm after it was plowed and planted. These women were also responsible for the children and for the household, and thus had little time to be serious farmers, except for the few whose household work was not so demanding. Households generally did not possess many farm tools and were all too often forced to plow, plant, weed and harvest the fields in a very rudimentary way. The project understood this problem, which is why the project wanted to consolidate blocks of fields. Only one of the consolidated blocks actually was a success, and that only because of continual top-down pressure.\n\nThe 5 to 10% of ordinary village families who actually enjoy farming and work hard inevitably do not have adjacent fields. Instead there would be one or two enthusiastic farmers in each village and it would be hard to bring their fields together into a unit. The end result was a conflict between the project which wanted to consolidate fields to make a successful farming enterprise, and those few successful farmers who knew better than project “experts” how to farm under Lesotho’s harsh conditions. The project thus failed to achieve any of its goals. I’m afraid I have to accept the fact that my report was the epitaph for the project.\n\nNonetheless, I believe that what I recommended makes sense, if not for the Senqu project then for future projects. I believed in helping key people who care about farming to improve their own methods. This means sharecropping between progressive farmers and others who simply want to turn over their fields to others. The project then should concentrate its energies on working with these progressive farmers. This does not mean the project should be in charge. Rather it should cooperate and work with village leaders and be only a support structure. That would have required training expatriate experts in rural sociology so they could find a natural place within the village hierarchy. Further we recommended that the technology be kept simple, not using high tech tractors and combine threshers, but instead improve local equipment and local facilities. The village literacy in Lesotho is much higher than in many African countries and so the ability of people, particularly of women who by and large have a higher level of schooling than men, to read and write is available to be used creatively.\n\nMy Ethiopian colleague Tesfa Guma was the only expatriate professional on the FAO staff I worked well with. He and I wrote a report about the differences between ordinary farmers and better farmers. We located better farmers by asking villagers to identify farmers who work hard, make money from farming, and give good advice to others. We then asked these farmers many social and economic questions about their farming methods and their lives, and then asked the same questions of a comparable group of randomly selected farmers.\n\nNot surprisingly the differences were dramatic. That was an inevitable consequence of the method of choosing them. Almost the biggest finding was just how poor most ordinary people were as farmers. They knew little, did little work and produced very little. In our report we strongly recommended that the better farmers be given the opportunity with project assistance to help others do the job that they themselves clearly knew how to do.\n\nI fear that the project staff was simply not willing to let go of their power. To admit that some villagers would be competent and receptive to new ideas implies that there already exist people who can do the work that outside development agents are supposed to do. This is not an assumption that the worldwide expert community likes to hear.\n\nIn the end I lost my job and neither the people nor the project benefitted from my work. As with my work in Liberia at first I felt hurt and betrayed. I was sure that rural people in Lesotho understood their situation, and did not want culturally inappropriate foreign farming ideas to destroy what for a few good village farmers had been a good system in the near past. I was not able to communicate to project staff or to anyone in the Ministry of Agriculture my deep concern to save rural agriculture in Lesotho in the only way I thought it could be saved.\n\nThe failure was not just the fault of unthinking, insensitive foreign experts and a centralized Basotho civil service. As happened in Liberia, I did not find in Lesotho local African colleagues with whom I could work. Tesfa Guma and I were able to share ideas and feelings, perhaps because we were both fish out of water in the United Nations and Lesotho government bureaucracies. I did not know how to play either game. Even worse, I apparently did not want to learn. I now wish I had made a serious effort to relate on a personal level with radical activist scholars and development agents such as some I met and worked with later. For the time being I have to say I enjoyed being the lonely voice in the wilderness. Being right, as I think I was, is hardly a virtue if no one listens or cares.\n\nI made one more effort. After leaving FAO and the Senqu River project, I has hired by USAID to assist in preparing for a major Farming Systems Research Project, to be mounted in each of the ecological areas of Lesotho: lowlands, foothills and mountains. My first assignment was to assess the successes and failures of Lesotho’s Ministry of Agriculture, to find which aspects of agriculture could set a model for the new project and which suggested areas needing improvement.\n\nI found the highest level of popular satisfaction with the efforts to assist livestock management. People were happy with the shearing, dipping and vaccinating programs, and only wanted more of the same so that they could have healthier animals and better access to markets. People were also generally happy with the conservation works carried out by the Ministry, mostly because this was a good source of income for the really poor.\n\nThe big failure was with the crops programs. Village people were glad if supplies were available in shops or government cooperative centers, but felt that too few supplies were available at prices people could afford. They were not happy with the extension agents, whom they felt gave poor or very limited advice, even when they made their rare visits to villages. People had far too few tools, equipment, seeds, fertilizer and markets. In summary they knew that crop farming is a very risky enterprise not sufficiently supported by the government assistance they wanted and needed.\n\nA special concern that arose was the need for sharecropping with the poorest families. Many fields were left fallow because families, with males absent in the mines or simply absent altogether, wanted to cultivate their fields with the help of others, whether through direct government assistance or through government mediation.\n\nI was asked to explore ways in which the new farming systems project could assist village farmers. In response I studied farming in two villages in a relatively fertile lowlands area only about half hour’s drive north of Maseru. I was joined by a Peace Corps volunteer and selected a local citizen to assist us in a detailed study of everything we could find out about the farming system in those villages.\n\nFor complicated political reasons, these villages were not in the end selected for inclusion in the new project. I was never fully informed as to why their participation in the project was cancelled, but my guess is that there were some disputes within the Ministry of Agriculture and the local chiefs about where to locate a new project. In the end my work in the villages was also terminated prematurely. The Peace Corps volunteer may have had a clue that something was happening, since he quit in mid-stream and went home to America to be with his girlfriend. I was also told in no uncertain terms that I must not continue working there, and could not even visit the villages.\n\nI suspect that the reasons were similar to those lying behind my failure to influence the United Nations and the Ministry of Agriculture in the Senqu River project. I spent almost no time building contacts with the officials in Maseru, whether USAID or the Government of Lesotho. I also did not make the effort to relate with traditional leaders in the area. I concentrated on my work in the village, collecting data and relating to village farmers. Not only was I not interested in “playing politics”, but also I admit to a deep-seated dislike and distrust of government officials. I am sure I simply did not know the political dynamic of the village, of USAID as it allocated aid funds, and of the Ministry of Agriculture, nor, to be honest, did I care. I fear I was in the position of an American educator in Liberia who was fired from USAID because he devoted all his time to working up-country and never went to meetings in Monrovia. I remember him as being one of the most committed and effective aid workers in Liberia – but he lost his job. I was not at his level of high competence and concern, while I certainly was at his level of political naivete – and I too lost my job.\n\nDespite all this, I did get a clear picture of a farming system, far clearer than I had been able to find in my work with the Senqu River project. I wrote a full report on the inequalities in what was an ordinary average community. What seems to be a clear division of villagers into rich and poor reduces not so much to injustices perpetrated by people on each other as to the natural consequences of different family sizes, willingness to work, access to jobs, soil quality, time of plowing and planting and weeding and harvesting, schooling, possession of tools, and level of cooperation with neighbors. In short within-village class formation is a gradual process, not only because poor people are oppressed by the wealthy family next door.\n\nThe larger story is how the system of slow gradual separation of haves from have-nots fits perfectly into the South African capitalist apartheid structures Lesotho was forced to accept until change began in the 1990s. Just about the only way to move out and up in Lesotho for people in the 70s and 80s was to send a man to the mines, where he would work to bring what is, in retrospect, minimal income back to the family. That money would be spent on South African consumer goods and supplies, ensuring that the village economy would remain stuck in carefully managed poverty relative to the exploitative South African system which did the managing.\n\nEven the best-off, the best-educated, the hardest-working mine laborers and farmers among the citizens of the two villages where I so unsuccessfully worked would thus never come close to escape from overall poverty. From a village perspective, a way out of poverty seems to be to work hard in the mines and in the fields. But from a larger perspective such village families can only look forward to living and dying poor compared with the white-owned system that dominates them. In the end this imbalance encourages the hopeful few to be satisfied with being at the upper end of what to the outside world will nevertheless look like poverty. After the formal end of apartheid, it does not appear that there have been serious changes in this system of inequality. An Oreo Cookie South Africa, with black on top, white in the middle, and black at the bottom, is not that different from the apartheid South Africa which preceded it.\n\nRegardless of my personal feelings of failure, it is likely I was correct that the old methods of subsistence family farming could not long continue in Lesotho. The population was too great, the land was too limited, and the fertility of the land was too compromised by years of abuse. Even turning over the land to the good farmers would very likely only delay the collapse of subsistence farming.\n\nI know I should not generalize on such a small sample, but I think the evidence from my experiences in Liberia and Lesotho suggests a second error, namely, my heavy emphasis on traditional knowledge and the old way of doing things. Perhaps in my contrarian way I fought too hard against western innovation in African affairs. The old ways in which Africans thought mathematical thoughts have not proved of value in western schools. The old farming methods, although more resistant to change than African mathematical reasoning, also fall short. Both traditional mathematics and traditional farming once thrived in a fragile and fast-disappearing environment. The loss of the former may be sad but it is inevitable and unlamented by all except a few like me. The loss of the latter is far more serious, since millions of Africans are still trying to make a living as subsistence farmers.\n\nIs it right to argue forcefully for the preservation of village and community based farming at a time when people are hungry? To me this reinforces the Dom Helder Camara question: why are the people hungry? The question is not just a matter of political economy. The implication this raises for most of us who know our liberation theology and Marxist economics is more than simply a matter of economic exploitation of the hapless subsistence farmer by rich agro-industries like Montsanto. Were there enough good land and fewer people, and were the seductions of cash and Coca-Cola weaker, then regularizing and supporting home-based farm production would make sense. But I fear those conditions are over and gone.\n\nThe big question in my mind by that time and still today is thus simple and clear to state. Are the days over for technologically simple rural farming, where hard-working village people, whether ordinary farmers or better farmers, can produce enough rice or maize or whatever to feed themselves? I have seen excellent, highly productive subsistence farms in both Liberia and Lesotho, but their success depended on very hard work, uncontested access to land, and good luck. The Mosotho farmer who reaped 120 bags of maize while his neighbor, on an equivalent field, reaped 6 bags, is not replicable. The Liberian farmer who harvested a stack of rice bigger than a normal village hut by very hard work and isolation is not replicable. What does appear to be replicable is the commercial farmer using skills and materials sufficient to feed Africa. I remember a signboard on a South African highway saying precisely that. The sign may be right.\n\nWhy then do the hungry have no food? So far my studies of village farmers in Liberia and Lesotho have not revealed the reasons. I once hoped that the answer would lie in learning from the past and making use of the age-old skills that kept Africa alive before the coming of the west. I knew that some rural farmers were successful, but their number grew smaller, and their skills depended on the vanishing circumstances of limited population and plentiful good soil.\n\nHow then can the hungry be fed? Working within an unjust racist capitalist system in southern Africa, while forgetting that Lesotho is only a pawn, a minor player in the dominant economy, does not solve the problem. Farming systems research in such a setting, even at its best, plays into the hands of the rich. I am sure this is why the foreign experts I met while working with the Ministry of Agriculture in Lesotho simply did not think in terms of the large-scale politics of the region. They were happy with the perquisites of access to white first-world South Africa, and did not think about what that meant for Basotho. Perhaps I did see the big political picture, but I failed to realize that “playing politics” is only really effective when it is done at the local level. The former American Speaker of the House of Representatives Tip O’Neill had it right when he famously said “All politics is local”. At that point in my work in Lesotho, I did not act on the truth of that statement.\n\nA personal story illustrates the blindness of the experts. While I was completing my work in these two lowlands villages two close friends, John Osmers and Phyllis Naidoo, received a parcel bomb in the mail, blowing off John’s hand and damaging Phyllis’s hearing. Judy and I, with the help of our youngest son David, helped clean the blood off the walls of Phyllis’s apartment, and went to the local hospital to visit John. We told colleagues in the Farming Systems Research Project what had happened, and invited them to join us visiting John. They refused, saying it was too political, while at the same time continuing to enjoy their weekend holidays in South Africa. Inevitably, Judy and I were then forbidden to enter South Africa, a fate which the experts were not willing to risk.\n\nI thus realized that simply describing the existing farming system was not enough. Instead people had to be helped to find their own way out of political and economic exploitation. My development research efforts turned away from agriculture to various forms of community self-help projects. I had previously hoped that development aid could be turned into viable livelihoods. I now realize that such aid can only succeed if it is built on a solid understanding of the situation into which the aid would come, including the political and economic setting.\n\nCHAPTER 6. AFRICA IS MORE THAN LIBERIA AND LESOTHO\n\nI left my work with the Ministry of Agriculture, first with the Senqu Project and second with the Farming Systems Research Project, to teach at the National University of Lesotho for three years. I was happy there, but I felt that I was spinning my wheels, not seriously engaged with the issue of African development. NUL, as it was called, was a backwater, a low-quality university, not up to what we had tried to do at Cuttington in Liberia. I might have tried to get a long-term job in the sociology and social anthropology department, but my heart was not in it.\n\nI realized through my work for foreign-led agricultural development projects, first in Liberia and later in Lesotho, that experienced rural farmers are more likely to understand how to survive under the difficult conditions of farming in rural Africa than experts from abroad. I knew, as I have said, that subsistence agriculture was declining across the continent, and I began to surmise that the subsistence way of life was going the same way as the gathering and hunting way of life – decline and death. But in the interim I believed that I might be able to help foreign experts improve matters. Local expertise is not always located and respected, and when it exists it may be interpreted only as advice to work hard and follow the tradition. I wanted to help development projects find and use local people who can lead and provide creative ways forward.\n\nI would soon be discouraged by the failure of the top down co-operatives that I saw in Tanzania in 1981. I had hoped that the top-down managed system of communal farming created by Julius Nyerere and his socialist effort to transform society from the bottom up would change the face of Africa. In 1960 when African independence was coming thick and fast, country by country, many of us looked to Tanzania under Nyerere as a bright hope for a just, egalitarian society, where all would work together for the benefit of all. Nyerere said all the right things and said them eloquently.\n\nUnfortunately history, and not just my three months of in-depth examination of seven ujamaa villages in Mbeya District in southwest Tanzania for the FAO, showed that the African socialism of the Arusha declaration could not keep the promise of economic democracy. In all seven villages the government had set up what appeared to be a very sensible program. Under the national government than there were district administrations with committed party members leading the way. In Mbeya district the leader was a former student of mine, Kayetan Ngombale-Mwiru. He had been a very bright and active student, a thoroughgoing Marxist and a political leader. Now he was having the chance to put his theory into practice. Unfortunately it became evident that he was corrupt and not in control of what was happening in his district, except to the extent that it benefitted him.\n\nSuccess of the political system that Nyerere introduced depended on the quality of the leadership at the village level. The only one of the seven villages that kept its promise was the result of the energy and hard work of a remarkable village head man. He was charismatic, honed by years of labor organizing in the South African gold mines, skilled at growing maize and coffee, and committed to evangelical zeal as a Baptist preacher. He was not replicable, any more than my exemplary Liberian and Basotho farmers.\n\nThe other six villages where I tried to find true socialism in action were all trapped by a combination of unsavory local politics and an oppressive top-down government system. The villagers sullenly went through the motions of cultivating communal farms that ranged from poor to hopeless. They tried to grow food for their households and crops for sale, but only when some entrepreneurial people found ways to beat the system and sell goods in the illegal open market were they able to make a living. In short, true African socialism as envisaged by Nyerere simply did not work. The Tanzanian government tried to do what I was recommending in the Hololo Valley, and their efforts failed.\n\nWhat may have made all the difference in the case of the first village and the one or two others that were modestly successful was the presence of a free enterprise structure for people to work and succeed. From what I saw the exact opposite of free enterprise was the rule. People were discouraged from growing surplus food crops and cash crops, apparently because they were forced to sell to government agencies which had a monopoly. The agencies were slow, efficient, un-motivated and in most cases mildly corrupt. If a farmer or a group of farmers wanted to make money and get a prompt return for their production, they had to break the law and sell their goods on an illegal parallel market. In short there were no incentives for sticking with a system that in theory makes good sense.\n\nIn a rapid survey of 563 villages across the entire region, several factors emerged as leading communities toward wealth or poverty. The mere presence of government structures was not sufficient. What made it possible for a village to have the highest scores on the various criteria we selected was a combination of people working away from the village, local people earning money, individual business activities and the number of teachers in the community. The government-imposed structures were of no help, and even were a hindrance to development.\n\nWhat people really wanted was an opportunity to improve themselves and their families. If they could have done that within the legal system, as was the case in the village with the remarkable leader, I think they would have done so. Since that was not possible, they took matters into their own hands and sought the best way, within or outside the system, they could to make a decent living. There was no way in which they could go over the head of the local village leader and appeal, for example, to an ombudsman who could carry the message higher in the government. The chain of command from the top down to the individual group of 10 households, called the 10-cell, was rigid and could not be bypassed. What was missing was a genuine two-way relationship between the government that was trying to develop the area and the people who were being developed.\n\nI recommended that there be a system of contracts and bargaining between higher-level government bodies, village authorities and even groups of farmers. I felt that some of the wealthier and more productive villages, often those with rich natural resources, could have negotiated to produce a given amount of maize or coffee or tea, in the same way as an agricultural business would negotiate. They were willing to follow the mantra, “you do your part and I will do mine”, in which both sides agree, with rewards and penalties, to meet mutually agreed goals. Of course this is a dangerous and difficult process. I thus made a second suggestion, that a village which wishes to develop engage experts, perhaps extension agents or production specialists, who would then assist to achieve the negotiated goal.\n\nNeither the FAO nor the Tanzanian government seemed interested in my suggestion, which in effect was private enterprise transferred to the village level. Just as had been the case with my work in the Senqu River project in Lesotho, experts from the outside were simply not willing to deal with local people on a one-to-one equal basis. Ultimately I believe village people will have to be given a chance to negotiate the future on their own terms. It is very difficult.\n\nAt the end of 1982 I observed top-down development in Ethiopia, and was once again impressed with the importance of people working and learning for themselves. The focus of the FAO project with which I was working was to overcome erosion, deforestation and land degradation. Throughout Ethiopia population was growing, crop production was going down, trees were being cut, and farmers are working harder and harder to produce less and less.\n\nWe were impressed with the ability of rural farmers to understand their own problems and suggest solutions. Unfortunately, many people had been brainwashed by the authoritarian Ethiopian government to wait for orders from on high as to how to cultivate and improve their land. Yet there was enough independence of mind and heart for some people to want to care for their own land and their own future. However, at that time the government under Mengistu Haile Mariam did not allow people to make decisions for themselves. I saw much resistance to government control, but for the time being there was little people could do to work out their own salvation. I remember visiting the Coptic Orthodox Cathedral in Addis Ababa and hearing an old man denounce the government. However, outside the church nobody spoke so forcefully.\n\nI did hope that the people themselves could solve their problems when I visited a resettlement scheme south of the capital city. The scheme was organized in two parts. The first was formed by the government, and people were given tractors and seeds and other supplies to grow crops for commercial production. The project was a clear failure. All of the tractors that I saw were out of order, and the people we met were sitting around doing almost nothing while they asked for more government handouts..\n\nOn the other hand the second half of the resettlement scheme was composed of people who chose voluntarily to occupy new land. Here people were working hard and producing enough food to feed themselves and sell the surplus. The people I spoke to were poor, but they were happy to have a chance to make their own future. I almost would say that their poverty was a great blessing, because they were forced to do things on their own and create their own future.\n\nForeign aid agencies in Ethiopia had to go along with what the government told them to do. International organizations inevitably must work with the government of the day. This is the cause of the downfall of so many projects in so many countries, just as I saw in Lesotho. I wish it were possible for those of us who are tasked to bring development to Africa to allow village people to develop and work out their own plans, and then provide them needed support. Of course there would inevitably be corruption in the use of the funds and materials provided from the outside, but for now the waste of money by international experts like me is much greater than the amount of waste if local people administered funds in the way they wish.\n\nPerhaps independent small-scale private enterprise might be the way forward. I realized in my studies in Lesotho and Tanzania the importance of jobs to support oneself and one’s family. The real source of income for poor people in both countries was employment. However, unfortunately that employment mostly came from international corporations or government ministries. Little of it came from the ordinary people themselves. I was given the opportunity fortuitously to see if ordinary people could make a living out of small businesses without being dominated by big capitalist organizations. The Ministry of Local Government and Lands in Botswana asked me in 1983 to join a study of small-scale informal sector businesses. If such businesses were viable they could make a huge difference in the lives of people who did not want to be subsistence farmers.\n\nI worked with three local members of Stephen Turner’s group and the Ministry, including Nomtuse Mbere who became a close friend and an important part of my life in Botswana. She was helped me make the project as successful as it could be, given very difficult economic and social conditions in the country. Eight young people worked with us as data collectors. Of that group three turned out to be hopeless alcoholic males, and thus the work we got out of them was much poorer than we might have gotten from better colleagues. The two whom we thought were the most experienced we sent to work in the most distant location, the rural village of Maun at the edge of the Okavango delta. They did a miserable job and had to be fired. Another worked in Francistown, and also proved to be a hopeless drunk. I found in my time in Botswana a serious tendency toward alcoholism on the part of young men, and learned that working with women is generally much m"
