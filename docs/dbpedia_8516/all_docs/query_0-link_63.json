It is a place of extreme contrasts, both in climate and in poulace.\n\nThough inhabited for millennia, the modern history of the region begins with the great caesura in history that the Mfecane, driven by the explosive growth of the Zulu Kingdom and the trek of Mzilikaze and the Matabele across the Transvaal. Bringing widespread devastation to the Sotho of the Transvaal, the 1820s and 30s would see two key events that would shape the future of the area between the Oranje and Vaal. The first was the widespread depopulation of the area, driven by starvation and the flight of the Makololo across Bechuanaland into Barotseland. The second was the centralisation of many of the Basotho tribes under Moshoeshoe I who, in retreating to the heart of the Drakensburg Mountains, founded the Kingdom of Barotseland.\n\nRunning concurrently with this, and spanning the departure of the Makololo in 1822, was the arrival of three waves of settlers from the Cape and Doleriet- the Boers, Griqua and Eureka settlers. Of these, the Eureka settlers were both the earliest travellers and those with the simplest history. Starting as a large breakout of prisoners from the Cape Colony in 1797, they spent the next 20 years moving further and further inland, never settling for more than a year or two due to fears that settling in what would become Doleriet would leave them open to a military expedition from Britain. Eventually, they settled on the north bank of the Orange River, naming their new home Adamstown[1] after their leader David Adams. Having all been settled in the town of Eureka[2], they took the name as badge of honour and in recognition of the source of their unity.\n\nMeanwhile the Orange valley was becoming increasingly settled by the Griqua, particularly around the small missionary settlement of Philippolis. Largely comprised of the unrecognised bastard children of the Dutch farmers of the Cape, the Griqua were to show a fierce determination to preserve their independence from Dutch, and later Boer, rule. From the early 1820s, and especially increasing with the British occupation of Doleriet in 1837, Boer farmers, or Voortrekkers, began crossing the Oranje River in ever larger numbers to settle in the relatively empty lands of what would become the Oranje Free State and the Transvaal. Having purchased land from the Bataung, the first major conflicts occurred in 1839 between Boers on the south bank of the Vaal and King Mzilikazi of the Matabele, eventually forcing the latter to leave the Transvaal for the Zambezia region[3].\n\nThe 1840s saw the start of a series of disputes between the Boers, Griqua and Basutoland. King Moshoeshoe, having secured the Caledon River valley in addition to the mountains of his initial base, now grew increasingly concerned with the presence of the Boer settlers in the Transorange, and requested British aid in controlling them. While wary about expanding beyond Doleriet, the British eventually extended treaties of protection to the Griqua and Basutoland, and declared a general protectorate over the Transorange, later annexing the land to the crown in 1850 as attempts to force the Boers to acquiesce to these treaties proved futile. This prompted the growth of the new town of Bloemfontein as an alternative seat to the more established Winberg.\n\nDespite the light hand of the British following the annexation, direct control remained weak, and many left for the Transvaal, sowing the seeds for the eventual break between the Oranje and Transvaal. The Boers in general proved too difficult to govern for such a territory so deep in the interior, and Britain abandoned both the land and their treaties with the states north of the Orange in 1853, the new Oranje Free State being declared in Bloemfontein afterwards[4].\n\nThe victory of Cetshwayo in the Third Zulu-Boer war- which had seen farms and homesteads in the far east of the Oranje attacked in the later stages, saw the beginnings of a new path for the Free State. Many in Bloemfontein and the more urbanised areas in the west of the country placed the blame for the deaths and destruction on the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek for embarking on her Quixotic quest to dominate the stronger Zulu Kingdom. In turn, Pretoria blamed Bloemfontein for not contributing enough to the cause, distracted as she was with border clashes with Basutoland and the annexation of Griqualand. Expanding on the earlier disputes which had broken the early unity of the Boers, this was to have profound effects on the Transvaal when conflicts again broke out with the Zulu in 1876.\n\nThe area around Philippolis, relatively fertile and with an amenable climate, had long been coveted by the Boers of the Free State, and with the collapse of the British treaty system in the Transorange Bloemfontein took the opportunity to send a military expedition to conquer the small Griqualand territory. After a brief but futile attempt at resistance, Philippolis was occupied in 1858, and the Griqua chief, Adam Kok III, led many of his people north into the more marginal land north of the Eureka Republic[5] which had already been settled by a few Griqua farmers[6]. Leading a mixture of settled and semi-nomadic lives from their capital at Kokstad[7], what was soon known as Griqualand North to differentiate it from the area around Philippolis soon found itself in the midst of minor disputes with the Eureka Republic, Oranje Free State and the furthest outposts of the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek.\n\nThe annexation of Philippolis had one particularly unexpected and far-reaching consequence. King Moshoeshoe I of Basutoland, already subject to border tensions with the Boers, now grew concerned over attempts to acquire his own land, and seeking to bolster his position sent a message to the Fengu offering fertile land to any who were willing to swear allegiance to him and fight to defend it for the Kingdom. Already known for their martial skills, and with particular concerns on overpopulation[8], many accepted and were settled in the fertile land of the Caledon valley.\n\nThe 1860s was a period of great change in the Central Region, driven by two factors. First, the discovery of diamonds in the eastern part of the Eureka Republic which, combined with the subsequent flood of miners and settlers, swiftly led to its annexation by the Cape Colony in 1864. Adamstown, already concerned about the demographic effects, had acquiesced to the nominal purchase fee when it was pointed out that, if necessary, the entire Republic could be annexed just as easily. Nonetheless, it was to lead to long running acrimony between Adamstown and the Cape. As Salisbury grew, farmers in Eureka, Griqualand North and the Free State began to grow rich selling their surpluses to the hungry city, while prospectors spread out across the surrounding region seeking their fortune.\n\nFour years later, the great Basutoland War broke out between the Free State and that Kingdom. The former, seeking to expand into the Caledon, decided to take the death of King Moshoeshoe I and the ascension of his son Letsie to the Kingship as an opportunity to attack during a moment of greater weakness. Matters were not to turn out to their expectations however, and aided by the Fengu- more of whom were invited to fight for land after the outbreak of war- he was able to resist the Boer incursions and inflict several notable defeats. Bloemfontein called for aid from the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek, but these calls went unheeded as the latter was busy preparing for what was seen as an inevitable clash with the Zulu, and as the tide of war began to turn both the Griqua around Philippolis and the Sotho in the area between the Vet and Vaal rose up to seek their independence. Both areas were characterised by lighter Boer settlement and with the war now turning into a three-front conflict, the Free State was forced back. Jan Bloem II[9] declared the independence of the area around Philippolis, now named Griqualand South as the former term 'Adam Kok's Land' was felt to be inappropriate, and formed a new republic culturally tied to Kok's northern state by the Griqua Christian Church and diplomatic missions. Meanwhile the Sotho under Matome of the Batlokwa tribe of the Sotho had declared his own Kingdom in the lands between Vet and Vaal. The young settlement of Orpensstad[10] was burnt to the ground, and the few Boer farmers and settlers in the region forced to flee.\n\nIn the midst of this, and with the Sotho around Harrismith and Heilbron getting restless and divisions within the Free State growing, forces from Basutoland attacked the area around Winburg. It was the final straw and State President Marthinus Pretorius- elected largely on a platform of strong links with the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek and indeed having served as State-President there, was removed by a vote of no-confidence and replaced with Johannes Brand[11] who thrashed out a peace with Letsie on the grounds of maintaining the border in return for ensuring that the Sotho and Fengu within Basutoland would cease raiding across the river.\n\nThis left the internal dissent within the country, and the territories lost to revolt. The former required a diplomatic hand and was the more pressing priority for the long term stability of the country, and with Griqualand South asking for, and gaining, British protection in 1871, it was the Sotho state that was the focus of Bloemfontein's attention. The latter had also looked to Britain for protection, but seeking to minimise her expansion and disputes with the Boers- Griqualand South after all could be claimed to be merely re-establishing a previous sphere of influence- this was refused and the nascent Batlokwa Kingdom was reincorporated into the Free State in 1875, just as the combined Zulu-British-Napoleonic troops were marching on Pretoria in the Fourth Zulu-Boer War. Orpensstad was refounded, but the population of Boers in the region never recovered.\n\nThe utter collapse of the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek which followed horrified Bloemfontein, and made State-President Brand even more determined to follow his policy of neutrality towards Britain, sitting himself between the hawkish attitudes of those seeking revenge for the Griqualand South protectorate and the Fourth Zulu-Boer War, and those in the North-West looking for closer relations with Cape Town to improve their ability to sell goods to the population of Salisbury.\n\nFeeling threatened by the increasing population near Salisbury and the number of prospectors in their lands, Griqualand North also sought to establish herself within the British Treaty System- which with the Cape granted responsible government was now an increasingly secure situation as any annexations would require the approval of the legislature there, and thus protectorate status was extended to Kokstad in 1878. Basutoland, knowing where the balance of power lay, maintained a policy of being pro-British but maintaining her independence, though attentions were often directed internally with the long running undercurrent of Sotho-Fengu tensions. This left only the Eureka Republic as a semi-hostile state, though trade with the Cape was leading to wealth for some and a small lobby advocating normalised relations. Adamstown, wary of conquest and distrustful of authority, was in any case careful to remain cordial with Cape Town and avoid giving any excuses to invade.\n\nWith Britain expanding her influence deeper into the continent, the establishment of the Reheboth and Oorloom Republics created an isolated pocked of unclaimed land north of the Orange. Inhabited by Tswana for the most part, but separated from the rest of that populace by the Sotho of Rolong and the Oorloom, the populace were largely nomadic and the terrain for the most part arid save for the cool and pleasant oasis that comprised the Eye of Kuruman. A small missionary settlement had long been established there, and in 1889 Britain established the Gayensa Protectorate, based at Kuruman, to establish her control over the area, and promptly proceeded to ignore the nomadic and peaceable populace, though it did create a spark of protest from the Eureka Republic, now surrounded by British territory on all sides.\n\nBy the time of State-President Brand's death in 1888, the Free State had stabilised, the Sotho were being kept in line, the economy was improving and the anger over the loss Griqualand South was beginning to cool. Relations with Basutoland were cordial and the peace of 1872 was being maintained, albeit with occasional breaches by individuals from either side who were generally reprimanded and forced to return stolen goods. This did mean that border tensions were relatively high, but as the numbers were relatively equal the majority of both populations considered it an insignificant situation. Francis Reitz was elected State-President in a landslide victory, and made it his policy to ensure the rights of Boers within the British Empire while retaining amicable relations and avoiding conflict with Cape Town or London. His premiership was soon to become dominated by the question of federation.\n\nAlready virtually surrounded by British colonies and influenced states, the Free State was cautious about the prospect of federation, though outside of the Bloemfontein-Winburg corridor economic links- with Salisbury and with the mining economy of the Transvaal- made many in favour of the loss of tariffs and trade barriers that federation would bring. In addition, many in Harrismith felt that federation would finally secure the eastern border with the Zulu Kingdom which, though peaceful since before the Fourth Zulu-Boer War, was long a concern for the area. London was eager to bring the Free State into the federation, and extended a formal invitation to join the negotiations, to which Reitz accepted and indicated that discussions would be 'possible', treading once more the middle course.\n\nCommanding a great deal of personal respect within the Free State, and with no certain majority among the populace, the fate of the Free State and the federation, sat upon a knife-edge until, in one of those moments around which the course of history turns, a new message arrived from Pietermaritzburg. The populace of Doleriet, economically dependent on the Cape to which she was closely linked by the customs union, overwhelmed in every possible respect by her larger neighbour, and convinced that no matter the results of the wider negotiations the province would be forced into union with, and thus absolute domination by, Cape Town requested aid from Reitz in the negotiations to help provide a counterbalance and strengthen the Boer contingent.\n\nReitz, sympathetic to the idea of Boer unity, was deeply affected by this, and entered fully into the negotiations, stating that it was 'our duty, our absolute duty, to ensure that these negotiations end with a situation as favourable to our brethren within British controlled territories as is possible, and if needs be to enter into federation as a counterbalance to Anglo sensibilities. It was a persuasive argument, and Reitz was instrumental for securing those two key provisions of the federal constitution- the extensive provincial autonomy and the ability to register blacks as citizens of neighbouring protectorates. The Oranje Free State thus narrowly approved joining the federation, and Reitz resigned his position as State-President to become the Province's representative to the Upper House, where he was named the first President of the Senate[12].\n\nThe Free State was not the only state in the Central Region to join at this time, with both Griqualands also joining to take advantage of the larger markets. King Lerotholi I of Basutoland followed the Zulu Kingdom into joining as an Associate Kingdom, while for ease of administration the Gayensa Protectorate was transferred to Cape Town's jurisdiction, though it was governed as a subject territory without even the representation that the Xhosa possessed, and had by this point become the site of asbestos mining which had attracted more white and coloured settlers. Notable for its absence was the Eureka Republic, still determined to maintain her independence until the victory of the Union Party in 1923 after the introduction of higher tariffs in the federation.\n\nThe long period of the First Constitution saw interesting voting patterns across the Central Region. The Free State was a bastion of conservatism and decentralisation, while the Griqua states maintained enough cultural links to form a voting bloc on many issues, though they usually split on issues which split mining and agricultural conditions. Eureka, once she joined in 1927, was ironically strongly in favour of protectionism to maintain her prosperity against cheaper grain imports from elsewhere. Basutoland of course did not have voting rights, though Lerotholi II's reforms meant that he would follow Zululand in starting the education and enfranchisement of his people from 1938, where they remained deeply conservative. Though generally united through the Kaffraria crisis, the subsequent decision to end the ability to register blacks as citizens of a neighbouring protectorate divided the populace. Basutoland was in favour, while the Griqualands and Eureka were largely indifferent- blacks being firmly in the minority here. The Oranje Free State was thus outvoted, and decided to sacrifice territorial unity for white dominance. Co-opting the coloureds, the area between Vet and Vaal, where the demographic balance was most strongly against them, was split off as the new protectorate of Sotholand, in an attempt to produce a situation where whites would be the majority and could retain control. It was to be seen as the biggest mistake in the history of the province, as with the discovery of gold the protectorate soon became rich enough to buy entry as a full province under the name KwaTlokwa and became one of the biggest supports of full enfranchisement.\n\nThis came in the constitutional rearrangements of 1958, when Gayensa was also admitted as a province in the great tidying up of the various territories that occurred at this point, though with a half-vote in the Senate. The situation today represents a precipitous balance that many view as unsustainable for much longer. The whites and coloureds of the Oranje Free State have just barely maintained their dominance, ironically mostly due to the movement of Sotho from the province to work in the gold mines of Sotholand which have seen the great cities of Matjhabeng[13], Meloding[14] and Matome, renamed from Orpensstad. Griqualand North has seen the population remain conservative and isolated, while Griqualand South is a relatively prosperous province gaining from the boom in tourism. Basutoland is growing economically, while the Eureka Republic has settled into an easy prosperity and Gayensa has begun to decline with the closure of the asbestos mines.

Departing from the Zulu Kingdom after falling out with Shaka Zulu, Mzilikazi brought his followers north, to lead a conquest of the relatively settled and urbanised area[1] of the Highveld. Driven by a desire to reshape the area to the benefit of his own Ndebele people, the resultant wars, societal restructuring and dictatorial rule was to devastate the Sotho-Tswana populace living in the region beforehand. Some, such as the Venda and the Swazi, fled before Mzilikazi, the former fleeing into the Waterberg and Zoutpansberg, the latter retreating from theirs Southwestern outposts and moving further north.\n\nMzilikazi established his chief Kraal near Pretoria, and for a decade terrorised the Sotho-Tswana of the Transvaal, slaughtering cattle and people, torching towns and extinguishing Royal houses to remove the foci of opposition, as well as utilising scorched earth tactics to create a no-man's land surrounding his kingdom. Unnumbered thousands died, and the native societal structure has never recovered.\n\nBy the late 1830s however, Boer farmers and settlers were beginning to make their way into the Highveld, and in a series of clashes beginning in 1839 eventually drove Mzilikazi out across the Limpopo on the second great Trek that would lead he and his followers to settle in the Zambezia Region. With the rest of the natives severely weakened, the Boers declared their ownership of the area, outraging the native allies who had been essential in securing victory[2], but who were powerless to resist the situation.[3]\n\nThe early decades of Boer settlement saw a period of great political instability as the rapid foundation of towns brought shifting alliances and demographic centres. Initially it was Winburg in what is now the Free State that had the greatest prominence, but from its foundation in 1839 the town of Potchefstroom in the Transvaal began to grow in prominence. The two entered into a brief union before the realities of distance and differences between the settler groups led to a separation, the Vaal River becoming the dividing line between the two areas of influence, thus marking the start of the separation between what would become the Oranje Free State and the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek.\n\nThe division of territory did not end with the independence of Potchefstroom, as the slow settlement of the Highveld by the Boers led to the initial territory of the city becoming divided into three in the late 1840s and early 1850s. In the west, Potchefstroom was the most prestigious and most populous, controlling the area most densely settled by Boers. To the east a second state had been established centred in the town of Lydenburg, while to the North the Zouptansberg Republic had been established in Zouptansbergdorf, renamed Schoemansdal after the town's de facto leader[4].\n\nWith the independence of the Oranje Free State in 1853, Britain moved to secure the new order by recognising the rights of the Boers north of the Vaal to their own government and practices[5], a process that led immediately to Potchefstroom declaring the Holland-African Republic, and after a few years of constitutional negotiations to the formal creation of the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek in the same city. Though claiming all the land beyond the Transvaal, and with informal claims stretching as far as Delagoa Bay, the ZAR was restricted initially to the territory controlled by Potchefstroom and neither Lydenburg nor Zouptansberg acknowledged the authority of the Republic.\n\nThus the immediate goal of Marthinus Pretorius after assuming the office of President of the Executive Council of the Republic in 1859 was to reincorporate both outlying regions. Careful diplomacy and complicated power politics brought the addition of representatives to the Volksrad from Lydenburg and Zouptansberg in 1862, but with ongoing disputes and recriminations between the three factions it was only when Pretorius resigned in disgust in 1863 that they were shamed into making the hard compromises necessary for unity. To mark the occasion, and reassure Lydenburg and Zouptansberg that their views would be heard, the capital was moved to a more central location named Pretoria after Pretorius himself[6].\n\nWhat would become known as 'the decade of unity', a much mythologized golden age in the later Boer histories of the Transvaal, saw the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek slowly move forward in economical and social growth, while tackling the strong divergent attitudes of her three constituent areas. Potchefstroom remained strongly interested in Boer unity, particularly with Pretorius travelling south to become State-President of the Oranje Free State in 1866 after serving another year with the ZAR. Lydenburg desired a more insular future and wanted to strengthen the borders with the Gaza Empire where the delineation of the border was beginning to become a mutual concern. Zouptansberg, almost entirely rural outside of Schoenmansdal, had a reputation for lawlessness and remained by and large outside of the central control beyond the regional seat, with a healthy trade of firearms for ivory with the Venda supplying much of the wealth for the area.\n\nThe start of the Fourth Zulu-Boer War, driven by a mutual desire in much of the southeast to lessen the perceived threat of the Zulu Kingdom, marked the second great caesura of the Transvaal's history. Though initially having broad support, and even gathering volunteers from the neighbouring regions of the Oranje Free State, the successive defeats of the Boers, and the eventual march of the Zulu, British and French volunteer column into Pretoria, where the terms of the reparations to be paid were dictated in 1875, brought a re-eruption of the age-old divisions within the Republic.\n\nThe central government, fearful of another military intervention from the British troops stationed within the Zulu Kingdom and at Mafeking in the newly established protectorate over the Barolong, sought a period of acquiescence towards Britain. Potchefstroom looked in vain for help from the Oranje Free State but initially called for national unity with the national government- which after all was dominated by her own representatives. Lydenburg however objected strenuously to the idea and wanted to take up arms and resist the British[7]. As the divide grew wider and wider, the representatives from Lydenburg declared that 'any government which would so bow to the wishes of Britain must be seen as illegitimate'. Within a month they had formed a rival government in Lydenburg, and were followed by many who thought similarly.\n\nWith the Oranje Free State busy with her own issues, Pretoria attempted to enforce her control by force, and a great civil war broke out in the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek. Lydenburg allied with the Swazi Kingdom to make up for their lack of numbers, and a stalemate was produced. Then in 1877 Potchefstroom declared her own independence to avoid being conscription for the fighting, severly undermining any hope for national reunification. Deciding to play on Britain's desire for the reparations to be paid, one faction within Pretoria sent an invitation to Britain to intervene militarily and re-establish order, hoping to exchange temporary domination for long-term unity.\n\nIt was to mark the end of the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek. British troops arrived in 1878, and the decision was made that the Boers were 'clearly unable to govern themselves'. Britain annexed the collapsing remnant of the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek as the Transvaal colony, Potchefstroom being pressed to join a few weeks later. The Oranje Free State was horrified but unable to change the situation and so looked to ways to ensure her own internal independence. While informally claiming the former territory of the Republic, Britain decided to secure her new northern border by organising and supporting the southern Ndebele and Bafokeng Tribe of the Tswana People into a pair of protectorates within the former territory of the ZAR.\n\nTo the north, the Venda had taken the opportunity of the chaos to begin raiding the area of Zouptansberg. Calls for assistance went out to Pretoria, to Lydenburg, even to Britain, but went unheeded, and in 1876 the Venda attacked Schoemansdal, forcing the inhabitants to flee and burning it to the ground[8]. From this came the great revolt of the Africans of the Zouptansberg, and the resultant flight of the Boers that would lead to the establishment of the Enkeldoorn Republic. Lydenburg, for the moment, now entered a period of guarded peace.\n\nThe discovery of gold in the Witwatersrand in 1883 was to bring the final great change to the region. The small settlement of Randfontein[9] exploded in size as White, Coloured, African and Asian labourers flocked to the gold fields to make their fortune, with one of the more successful ventures financed by Sir Cecil Rhodes during a diversification of is mining portfolio, to great profit from him. Britain, wanting to fully secure the area, took moves to secure protectorates over Swaziland and the Africans of the northern Transvaal, and at the same time undertook the conquest of Lydenburg. By this point the idea of Boer unity in the Oranje Free State had become greatly reduced by the aftermath of the 4th Zulu-Boer war, not to truly reemerge until the premiership of Reitz, thus the action occurred without great protest.\n\nThe extraordinarily rapid population growth of the Transvaal quickly pushed the Boers into a minority even in the white community, leading to domination by those disparagingly referred to as 'Uitlanders' by the Boers, which combined with the conquest of Lydenburg saw a second wave of Boers leave to head north to Lydenburg. The wave of prospectors spreading out from the Transvaal soon meant that mines were being established in Lydenburg, Ndebeleland, the Bafokeng protectorate and the two newer protectorates of Shangaan and Sekhukhuneland established in 1894 and 1896 respectively. Meanwhile in 1885 negotiations with the Gaza Empire and Swaziland were completed delineating the border with the Transvaal area and the guaranteeing the security of the new railway line to be built down to Delagoa Bay among other matters. The question of confederation was one which had very little dispute in the area- neither colony having responsible government and Lydenburg effectively under military rule it was just assumed that if federation was agreed then the two colonies would be added to it. Cape Town by and large agreed- Sir Cecil Rhodes particularly eager to make it easier to exploit the gold fields, though Reitz did ensure that Lydenburg was allowed to operate as a separate colony to the Transvaal rather than being annexed to it, and spent much of the next 10 years in careful negotiations with the Boer population there, a clear minority unlike most of the white and coloured states, to gain the best deal for them while acknowledging that full independence would not be allowed by Cape Town or London.\n\nLydenburg, like Doleriet, was a centre for the Retief rebellion during the first of the Great Wars, while the Transvaal continued to grow, both in population and in income inequality, making it an early centre for the South African Labour movement. Swaziland acceded to the federation in 1904 after a delicate negotiation involving the transfer of rights to some ancient royal grazing lands lost almost a century before and now part of the Lydenburg province, and apart from a brief North Transvaal Protectorate that collapsed back into her subject parts after a few years, the most significant border change was the creation of the Rhodes National Park in 1912.\n\nThe Transvaal was one of the areas of the federation most prone to discontent, be it labour relations in the mining towns, the lingering distrust of the Boers of the Transvaal and especially Lyndenburg, or tribal disputes and conflicts in the native states of the north, and while this made governance an especially difficult process at times, it did lead to a strong history of political activism, with Randfontein becoming known as much for her profusion of political newspapers as for her gold reserves.\n\nIt was the Transvaal that saw the first true electoral success for the Labour movement of South Africa, gaining control of the legislature in 1922, from which date the name 'Red Randfontein' has become increasingly common. The movement, which had been aided by the fact that on joining the Federation the Transvaal had adopted a variant of the Cape Franchise with a higher property qualification, soon pushed for better working conditions and the elimination of the property qualification for whites, which was passed but soon brought greater calls for coloureds and blacks to be granted the same rights, which saw a slow growth in support for full enfranchisement which saw the Transvaal become one of the chief supporters of the 1958 constitutional changes.\n\nLydenburg, on the other hand, was recalcitrant and bitterly opposed any such moves. Much like Doleriet, it would require the intervention of federal troops to enforce the new constitution, and the Boers of Lydenburg would respond by gerrymandering the seats in the provincial assembly to ensure that they could guarentee enough votes to block laws which might further reduce their power, the most egregious violation of the spirit of the new constitution that can be found in the country. Swaziland had long been an Associate Kingdom, and so as was being done across the rest of the country, the remaining protectorates were granted full representation and a half-vote in the Senate.\n\nThe Transvaal today remains a place of severe contrasts, anchored by the demographic powerhouse of 'Red' Randfontein and the Transvaal, which includes the new federal capital of Pretoria, chosen because of the extreme multicultural nature of its inhabitants since the implementation of British rule. It makes it the first time that Pretoria has been a seat of government since the Provincial legislature moved to Randfontein in 1899. Particularly notable in recent decades is the wave of post-Second World War migrants and those fleeing the Portuguese Colonial Empire on its collapse who have tended to make their home in the Transvaal rather than the Cape and contributed further to the vibrant ethnic mix of Pretoria and Randfontein. The native protectorates, like many across the country, remain relatively poor and backward, with the lack of education in the region as a whole proving to be the only issue that can match the concerns about the vastness of the income inequality found in the Transvaal Province in particular and the region as a whole. Meanwhile the situation in Lydenburg remains in a state of almost permanent deadlock between the wealthy white minority and the black and coloured majority, with many awaiting with baited breath the results of the federal court case judging whether the Province's electoral boundaries are unconstitutional.\n\n[1] Just to give an idea of the scale of the Mfecane, before Mzilikazi the Transvaal was home to an incredibly complex collection of societies, thousands of settlements, direct and indirect trade routes and towns reaching the size of contemporary Cape Town. By the time the Boers started settling this had pretty much entirely gone.\n\n[2] Mostly from the fringes of the territory rather than Mzilikazi's realm itself.\n\n[3] Essentially as OTL, but with the Boers arriving a couple of years later.\n\n[4] All as OTL when considered in this sort of broad stroke manner. With such chronic disunity it's frankly amazing that they ever became the force they did.\n\n[5] The Transorange protectorate had a very, very vague boundary, the governor being the British resident 'for those tribes lying beyond the frontier to the north east'. Needless to say Britain wants to clear up any misunderstandings before they start.\n\n[6] Yes, still OTL, though by this point everything's about 4 years late and the negotiations take longer.\n\n[7] A bit simplistic of course, but that represents the general attitude on each side.\n\n[8] This happened about a decade earlier OTL (the town was never rebuilt then either) but was rooted in Zouptansberg meddling with the Venda's internal politics, an opportunity they didn't get TTL.\n\n[9] Johannesburg OTL.\n\n​\n\nBECHUANALAND REGION\n\n​\n\nBarolong Kingdom\n\nCapital: Mafeking\n\nLarge Cities: Ditsobotla\n\nOfficial Religion: Weslyan Methodist Church, Traditional Tswana beliefs\n\nOfficial Languages: Tswana\n\nPopulation: 1,019,114\n\nWhite: 34,293\n\nColoured: 12,797\n\nAfrican: 966,515\n\nAsian and Other: 5,509\n\n​\n\nBafokeng Kingdom\n\nCapital: Phokeng\n\nLarge Cities:\n\nOfficial Religion: Weslyan Methodist Church, Traditional Tswana beliefs\n\nOfficial Languages: Tswana\n\nPopulation: 1,498,268\n\nWhite: 50,097\n\nColoured: 4,987\n\nAfrican: 1,440,309\n\nAsian and Other: 2,875​\n\n​\n\nBritish Bechuanaland\n\nCapital: Gaborone\n\nLarge Cities: Lobatse\n\nOfficial Religion:\n\nOfficial Languages: English, Tswana\n\nPopulation: 626,399\n\nWhite: 103,409\n\nColoured: 43,897\n\nAfrican: 478,019\n\nAsian and Other: 1,074​\n\n​\n\nBangwaketse Kingdom\n\nCapital: Kanye\n\nLarge Cities:\n\nOfficial Religion: Weslyan Methodist Church, Tswana traditional beliefs\n\nOfficial Languages: Tswana\n\nPopulation: 165,012\n\nWhite: 798\n\nColoured: 154\n\nAfrican: 164,049\n\nAsian and Other: 11​\n\n​\n\nBakwena Kingdom\n\nCapital: Molepolole\n\nLarge Cities:\n\nOfficial Religion: Weslyan Methodist Church, Tswana traditional beliefs\n\nOfficial Languages: Tswana\n\nPopulation: 208,305\n\nWhite: 1,014\n\nColoured: 179\n\nAfrican: 207,079\n\nAsian and Other: 33​\n\n​\n\nBamagwato Kingdom\n\nCapital: Serowe\n\nLarge Cities:\n\nOfficial Religion: Weslyan Methodist Church, Tswana traditional beliefs\n\nOfficial Languages: Tswana\n\nPopulation: 184,793\n\nWhite: 751\n\nColoured: 434\n\nAfrican: 183,504\n\nAsian and Other: 104​\n\nBatawana Kingdom\n\nCapital: Maun\n\nLarge Cities:\n\nOfficial Religion: Weslyan Methodist Church, Tswana traditional beliefs\n\nOfficial Languages: Tswana\n\nPopulation: 118,315\n\nWhite: 647\n\nColoured: 83\n\nAfrican: 117,583\n\nAsian and Other: 2\n\n​\n\n************************​\n\nConsidered a largely peripheral region of the Federation, Bechuanaland is usually talked of as a late addition to the history of the region. This belies, however, the differing paths of those states of the Southern Fringe and those further to the north.\n\nThis divide can be traced back as far as the Mfecane, and arguably to the split between the settled Tswana of the Veldt and their more nomadic cousins further north. The Mfecane itself largely spared the region, though large territories were lost by the Barolong, and many of the Bafokeng suffered greatly from being in the sphere of influence of the Mzilikazi. The Barolong gave rights of transit to many, and thus it was across their territory that the Kololo trekked across on their voyage north, and within the fringes of the territory that some of the Batlokwa settled. Meanwhile the tribes to the north saw little in the way of disruption during the period.\n\nContact with whites was a long, slow process, beginning in the early 1830s with the purchase by the Boers of the Transorange of the territory of the Barolong situated on the southern bank of the Vaal River, an area most affected by the Mfecane, and thus largely depopulated. While the Barolong entered into a period of occasional trade with what was to become the Oranje Free State, the Bafokeng of the Transvaal found their territory within the claimed boundaries of the various states based in Potchefstroom, though the area remained largely ignored by the Boers and they were thus able to begin to recover from the effects of Mzilikazi's rule. By the time the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek was fully unified in 1863 the population was beginning to flourish once more. The expansion of the Boers in the Transvaal did, however, compel many in the Barolong Kingdom and territory of the Bafokeng to leave for the area of the Bangwaketska and Bakwena.\n\nBritain had begun looking to secure the northern flank of the Salisbury Diamond fields in the late 1860s and early 1870s through an alliance with Griqualand North, and then with the Barolong beyond. The onset of the Fourth Zulu-Boer war brought great importance to the area, with Britain establishing a fort at the Barolong's royal seat of Mafeking[1] to help secure the supply routes and secure British control over the Transvaal. British annexation of the Transvaal saw the Bafokeng split off as a separate protectorate to secure the loyalty of an otherwise sparsely populated area, and at the same time Kgosi Gaborone led his branch of the Batlokwa out from the chaos of the collapsing Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek and into the central area of Bechuanaland, settling at a place named Moshaweng but which became known as Gaborone after him.\n\nThe incursion of the column of Boers that left the Zouptansberg region to eventually establish the Enkeldoorn Republic had also brought pressing concerns to the King Khama III of the Bamangwato tribe. Having stopped in Sefophe, Khama was concerned that the Boers would remain in his kingdom, and any attack to force them out without allies would be costly. He thus turned to the British and asked for their protection in return for a guarantee that the lands of the Bamangwato would be preserved. Britian, extending her chain of forts north from Mafeking to Lobatse and Gaborone, accepted the move and the Boers soon moved on, whether as a consequence or not being a debatable question. The tribes of the central region followed suit, and Britain had soon established the Bechuanaland Protectorate stretching to Portuguese territory in the north. Notable for their exclusion were the Barolong and Bafokeng- who succesfully petitioned for their prior arrangements to be preserved- and the Tswana of the Gayensa region who were largely isolated on the other side of the Barolong.\n\nThe 1890s saw a period of profound change for Bechuanaland. To the west, the Oorloom and Zylland Republics began to create a geographical divide between the Batawana and the central tribes, while to the North West a similar situation with New Éire was overshadowed by the increasing desire to affirm British influence over the Matabele Kingdom as dividing lines between the Lisbon and London began to be drawn up in the Zambezia region. To cement this, Sir Cecil Rhodes became convinced that a railway from the Cape to the Matabele Kingdom of Bulawayo was required, a project which would also help the growing confederation project. Thus the areas around Gaborone, Lobatse and Ramathlabama were constituted into the small colony of British Bechuanaland, to which was added the lands of the Bakgatla who had become economically entwined with the fort at Mochudi.\n\nBritish Bechuanaland was the smallest of the provinces at federation, granted her position mainly at the instigation of Rhodes as a way of tying the Bechuanaland area to the federation. At the same time, the many incursions of outside groups into Bechuanaland, and the desire to create national parks and hunting reserves in the territory of the protectorate led to its dissolution. The territories of the 4 tribes- the Bamangwato, Batawana, Bakwena and Bangwaketse, were assured and they were constituted as separate protectorates, while the rest of the territory was made federal territory.\n\nThis situation has endured throughout the years of the federation, and with generally low populations and several pan-Tswana initiatives, the wealth generated from the growing mining industries has made this one of the best educated and most advanced and socially progressive areas outside the Cape Colony. In recognition of this, the Barolong and Bamangwato were granted a full vote in the senate during the 1958 constitutional rearrangements, while the remaining Kingdoms gained a half vote\n\n[1] Established by the 1850s if not earlier.\n\n​"
