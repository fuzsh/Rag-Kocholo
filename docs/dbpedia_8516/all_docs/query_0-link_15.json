        "text": "In the pages of the Paris Evangelical Missionary Society newspaper , Leselinyana la Lesotho, the earliest generations of literate Basotho found not only a source of political and spiritual guidance , but also a medium whereby they too could express their views even if within that missionary setting. The present paper desires to \" hear \" some of the issues raised by these Basotho in order, chiefly, to see how they brought the Bible to bear on those issues. Whereas expatriate missionary voices have overwhelmingly informed South African 19th century mission historiography thus far, this paper hopes to show how much the academy stands to gain by pausing to listen to what the native interlocutors of these \" missionaries \" had to say in their own ways and words. David Moiloa is one such interlocutor who ably illustrates some of the issues as well as the ingenious manner of reading and writing that 19th century Basotho engaged in.\n\nThe aim of the article is to evaluate the possibility cross-border orthographies and their possible role in promoting the use of teaching and learning material, and literature in African languages across political and ethnolinguistic boundaries. In Southern Africa, where people speak related Bantu languages, benefits from mass literacy campaigns for socio-economic development can only accrue from a wider readership of material, written in accessible unified orthographies. Using some examples from African languages, I show how some writing rules are not consistent with the syntactic and morpho-phonological make up of the languages and how the languages are currently used by speakers; how the same language has different orthographies in different countries, making difficult (if not impossible) for material and expertise on the languages to be shared across national boundaries, and thus reducing the number of speakers to those confined within political boundaries. I conclude that there is need for language planning and policy across geographical borders that take advantage of cross-border languages, which are currently promoted in isolation within nation-states. Moreover, status and corpus, planning should go beyond promotion of isolated languages in nation-states, to a broader and more comprehensive one that accounts for the relatedness of Southern African languages as a result of a common Bantu ancestry.\n\nAt the start of the 2008 Advent season, English-speaking Catholics in South Africa found themselves using a “new,” or at least unfamiliar, language. The first of three sets of changes to the English translation of the Roman Missal was implemented in South Africa, a nation in which the Catholic Church was one of the most recent churches to be established. The changes have caused much confusion, with many considering them “arbitrary,” as the rest of the English-speaking world continues to worship in what seems like another language. The Vatican has pushed to re-translate colloquial English versions of the Missal, which some have considered merely an interpretation of the original Latin text, into a standardized form more “faithful to the Latin.” These changes represent not only a question of one‟s religious identity but, given the multilingual backdrop of South Africa, a question of one‟s linguistic, as well as ethnic, identity. Does this standardized English not nullify colloquialism and regional identity? How do these changes affect multilingual congregations which have little choice but to use this de facto lingua franca in their services? This ethnographic study addresses the complex ethnolinguistic identity of congregants and clergy in South African churches in order to more clearly understand the lingual and ethnic dynamics existing in the new South Africa. Relying heavily on first-hand interviews, participation in both monolingual and multilingual services, and analyses of non-traditional sources, this study diverges from previous studies on language and ethnicity, situating itself within the context of the Church. This preliminary research on a text that will not go into full affect until 2011 reveals split opinions on the necessity of the changes to the Roman Missal and what this may mean to one‟s identity. Au début de la saison de l'Avent, les catholiques anglophones en Afrique du Sud se sont retrouvés à utiliser une langue nouvelle, ou du moins inconnue. La première des trois vagues de traduction en anglais du Missel romain a été instaurée en Afrique du Sud, un pays où l'Église catholique est l'une des plus récentes à avoir été établie. De tels changements sont la source de beaucoup de bouleversements, souvent considérés par les gens comme « arbitraires », dans la mesure où le reste du monde anglophone continue de pratiquer la religion dans ce qui semble être une autre langue. Le Vatican a encouragé à retraduire les versions anglaises familières pour aboutir à une forme normalisée plus fidèle à la forme latine, tandis qu'on la considère plus comme juste une autre interprétation de la forme latine originale. Ces changements ne sont pas seulement liés à une question d'identité religieuse mais, compte tenu de la diversité linguistique de l'Afrique du Sud, ils soulèvent aussi des problèmes d'identité linguistique, ainsi qu'ethnique. Cet anglais standardisé n'annule-t-il pas les langues familières et l'identité régionale ? Comment ces changements affectent-ils les assemblées polyglottes de fidèles qui n'ont pas beaucoup d'autres choix que d‟utiliser cette lingua franca de fait pendant leurs offices ? Cette étude ethnographique traite de l'identité ethnolinguistique complexe des fidèles et du clergé des églises sud-africaines, afin de mieux comprendre les dynamiques linguistiques et ethniques qui existent dans la nouvelle Afrique du Sud. En se fiant à des interviews de première main, au taux de participation dans les offices monolingues et polyglottes, et à des analyses de ressources non traditionnelles, cette étude se distingue des précédentes recherches sur la langue et l'ethnicité, car elle se concentre sur le contexte de l'Église. Cette recherche préliminaire sur un texte qui ne sera pas mis en place avant 2011 révèle des opinions divisées quant à la nécessité des changements apportés au Missel romain, et à la façon dont il peut affecter l'identité d'un individu.\n\nThroughout the nineteenth century, driven by the need both to communicate with potential African converts and to produce written Scriptural translations, Christian missionaries set about studying, transliterating and transforming South African languages. Their work served, in various ways, the demands of the developing British colonial order; established new ‘standard forms’ of South African vernaculars; and facilitated the development of literacy among African people in the region. The close relationship between missionaries, colonialism and language study in South Africa has been documented and analysed by scholars from a wide range of disciplines. This article summarizes some of the key issues in the field, as they have defined critical debates since the 1980s, by focusing on models of ‘invention’ on the one hand and ‘reciprocity’ on the other, and exploring continuities and dissonances between these debates and the wider fields of colonial studies and colonial discourse analysis. It concludes by arguing for a balance. On the one hand, it is vital that we acknowledge the significance of missionary language study as a mode of colonial discourse with the power to shape the social, linguistic, and political realities it purported only to describe. On the other, this should not eclipse our understanding of missionary linguistic work in social context, as the product of fraught, complex, and often mutually transformative encounters between European missionaries and African speakers of the languages in question."
