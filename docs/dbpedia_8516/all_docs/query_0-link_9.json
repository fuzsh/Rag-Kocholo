        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe Free State is the third largest of South Africa’s nine provinces. Before 1995 it was called the Orange Free State. The Orange Free State was one of South Africa’s four traditional provinces and was originally a Boer republic. Bloemfontein is the provincial capital and is also the judicial capital of South Africa. Area 50,126 square miles (129,825 square kilometers). Population (2015 estimate) 2,817,941.\n\nGeography\n\nThe Free State lies in the middle of South Africa and shares borders with six other provinces. North West, Gauteng, and Mpumalanga lie to the north, KwaZulu-Natal to the east, the Eastern Cape to the south, and the Northern Cape to the west. The only international border is with the mountainous kingdom of Lesotho, to the east and south of the province.\n\nThe largest part of the Free State is a grassland plateau called the Highveld. There are mountains in the east, along the border with Lesotho. The Vaal River forms much of the Free State’s northern boundary. The Orange River forms the southern boundary. South Africa’s largest dam, the Gariep, is on the Orange River between the Free State and Eastern Cape provinces. The country’s second largest dam, the Vanderkloof, is also on the Orange River, between the Free State and Northern Cape provinces.\n\nThe Golden Gate Highlands National Park is in eastern Free state, in the foothills of the Maloti Mountains. The impressive Sentinel Rock rises above the park.\n\nThe Vredefort Dome, near Vredefort and Parys in the northernmost part of the province, is Earth’s oldest and largest visible meteorite crater. It was formed some two billion years ago by the impact of a meteoroid 6 miles (10 kilometers) in diameter. In 2005 the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) named the area a World Heritage site.\n\nPeople and Culture\n\nAlthough the Free State is South Africa’s third largest province in area, it has the second smallest population. It also has the second lowest population density. About seven-eighths of its people are black Africans. Less than a tenth are white. About two-thirds of the people speak Sesotho, the language of the Basotho people. The next most common language is Afrikaans, followed by isiXhosa, the language of the Xhosa. Several other languages are also spoken.\n\nBloemfontein is the largest city in the province. Other sizable towns include Welkom, Botshabelo, Kroonstad, Virginia, Harrismith, Bethlehem, Sasolburg, Parys, Phuthaditjhaba, and Odendaalsrus.\n\nThe Anglo-Boer War Museum and the National Women’s Monument are in Bloemfontein. The women’s monument was designed by the sculptor Anton van Wouw in the early 1900s. It honors the many Boer women and children who died in British concentration camps during the South African War. The monument also holds the grave of Emily Hobhouse, a British campaigner for human rights.\n\nEconomy\n\nThe Free State is known as the breadbasket of South Africa because of its grain production. The province provides significant crops of corn (maize), wheat, and sorghum. Other crops include sunflowers and various vegetables and fruits, including potatoes, asparagus, and cherries. Most of the country’s cherries are harvested in the Ficksburg area. Dairy and sheep farming also contribute to the economy.\n\nMining provides jobs for many people in the Free State. Gold mines provide about 30 percent of South Africa’s gold and make the province one of the world’s largest gold producers. The Free State’s goldfields are in the districts of Odendaalsrus, Virginia, and Welkom. Silver and uranium are important by-products of the gold mines. Other mineral resources in the Free State include diamonds, bentonite (a kind of clay), and coal.\n\nSince 1989 the Free State has tried to make its economy less dependent on agriculture and mining. As part of this effort, manufacturing has expanded in the province. The chemical industry is very important. In Sasolburg, the Sasol company uses coal to make fuels, chemicals, and other products. Other manufactured products include food and beverages, textiles, and jewelry. A growing number of companies focus on high-technology manufacturing.\n\nHistory\n\nPeople have lived on the land that is now the Free State for many centuries. The San were early inhabitants. Later on, Bantu-speaking peoples such as the Tswana came to the area. In the early 1800s the Tswana were forced out by the Zulu, who were led by King Shaka. The Sotho and Griqua peoples took their place in the region. A leader named Moshoeshoe united numerous African peoples to form the Sotho kingdom. The Sotho capital was at Thaba Bosigo, which is now in western Lesotho.\n\nEuropeans first crossed the Orange River northward to enter the Free State area in the 1700s. In the early 1800s, as the Sotho arrived in the region, the Boers (farmers of Dutch ancestry) also began to settle there. More Boers came from Great Britain’s Cape Colony during the Great Trek of the 1830s and 1840s. The Boers fought the British for control of the territory. At the same time, the Sotho clashed with both the Boers and the British. Great Britain tried to set up a colony called the Orange River Sovereignty in 1848 but gave it up in 1854, in an agreement called the Bloemfontein Convention. The Boers then established a republic called the Orange Free State.\n\nThe Orange Free State continued to fight over land with Moshoeshoe’s Sotho kingdom. In 1868 the Sotho were conquered. The Boers took much of the Sotho land and added it to the Orange Free State. The reduced Sotho kingdom eventually became the independent country of Lesotho.\n\nWhen the South African War (also called Anglo-Boer War) broke out in 1899, the Orange Free State joined with another Boer state, the South African Republic, to fight against Britain. In 1902 the Boers lost the war. Both republics became British colonies. The Orange Free State was renamed the Orange River Colony. In 1910 the colony became a province—once again called Orange Free State—in the newly-formed Union of South Africa.\n\nDuring the 1960s the white-dominated national government set aside certain regions in the province as so-called homelands. The homelands were part of a scheme to settle black Africans on small tracts of land where they would not have South African citizenship. Created from parts of Orange Free State were Qwaqwa, homeland of the southern Sotho (or Basotho); and part of Bophuthatswana, homeland of the Tswana. The homelands were restored to the province in 1994, the year apartheid (racial segregation) finally ended. In June 1995 the Orange Free State was renamed Free State."
