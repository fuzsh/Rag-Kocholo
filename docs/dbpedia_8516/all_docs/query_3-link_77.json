Apart from apparent Parliament earnestly enacted this legislation for lack of political will to promote South African o icial government to implement but the latter, as evinced by languages and inculcate multilingual ethos there is a the position entoned, updicate its solemn responsibility. lack of understanding of why the promotion of all eleven o icial languages and status elevation of previously marginalised o icial languages are important. Almost all departments perceived the UOLA and the multilingual language policy implementation as sheer provision of translation and interpreting services, rather than creating equitable space for the o icial language to grow and create value. Most departments admitted to not having done anything about implementing the UOLA. There appeared no inclination to allocate su icient human and financial resources towards multilingual language policy development and implementation. They unequivocably displayed a strong predilection to default to English on the assumption that it is easier, logical and commonsensically the only language inherently able compared to others. “Practicability”, “as far as reasonably practicable”, along with lack of insu icient budget, were the bylines fronted frequently as the main reasons that impede the use of the previously marginalised languages in departmental o icial business. A particular stumbling block is the process of developing proper multilingual language policy, the bedrock that nurtures linguistic diversity. It would be easy to simply blame the Department of Arts and Culture for its formulaic, workshop-style introduction of a policy template to all departments – as it did in 2016, but these departments need to take full responsibility for not complying. Virtually all of the departments slavishly followed this template and produced almost identical “language policy” documents. Instead of developing multilingual language policy befitting their individual context they merely restated UOLA. None of them devoted any serious thought to the following key points: • the ultimate benefit the adoption of a more diverse linguistic framework would bring to their departments and the people they serve; 09 3. RECOMMENDATIONS • The government departments should construct acceptable multilingual language policy with time-framed implementation plan. • Both the language policy and its implementation plan should be strategically biased towards the development and creation of business space for the indigenous South African o icial languages. • The departments should in tanderm make solid provision for su icient resources to enable language policy implementation. • They should accord top priority to fully functioning language units with cogent executive standing within the departmental executive/management committee. • The language units should be a multilingual language policy implementation structure of the departments and shall therefore not be limited to translation, editing, proofreading and interpretating. They are meant to actively entrench multilingualism within the context of each department’s business, thereby enhancing service delivery. • The department should appoint professional and expert language practitioners well entrenched in multilingualism, language policy studies, language politics and related studies. Each government department should be dutifully bound to develop its own specialised multilingual terminology lists and get them verified and authenticated accordingly. • PanSALB will facilitate language policy workshops for departmental sta , management and executives on multilingualism, language policy development and implement, terminology development, and indigenous languages empowerment. • PanSALB will continuously monitor and evaluate language policies development and implementation to provide necessary support and guidance. 10 4.

Each Human language technology refers to the simulation of department has its own stakeholders, which means it language processes using technology such as automatic needs its own policy. Even the adoption of o icial translation, spellcheckers, speech recognition and the languages by each department is not prescribed: production of speech.

It is further believed that there is implementation named a er South Africa’s first translator, Autshumato, consistent with what the policy requires.

The DAC has also been working on machine translation implementation plan which PanSALB seeks is included in systems for the o icial languages, to translate from all plans of the department. It however conceded that English into any other language, with the help of this English is used for inter- and intra-government assist translator can edit without having to start from communication and international communication, but scratch. These translation systems are hosted on the argued that translation is available for the other o icial department’s server, allowing translators with internet languagees upon requestwhilst English is used for access to use them. Not only DAC translators are being practical reasons in international interactions. One could assisted in terms of its own language policy, but not expect to go to another country and use another of translators everywhere. DAC is in the final year of a South Africa’s o icial languages, it argued. In other 16 cases, the other o icial languages are used for Constitution; 4(2)(3) Act. Ironically, DAC has English as its communication with the public; DAC will communicate main language of business thus ignoring its own with people in the language of their choice, for mandate and the obligations of the above cited government-to-government language is English. The legislation (cf. 8.2). There is no perceptible signal of how requirements for written requests to communicate in the rest of the o icial language would be incrementally non-o icial languages or in South African Sign Language, introduced into the centre of running the departmental as per sections 10 and 11 of DAC language policy, are o icial business. Over and above that there are many necessary because there is no way to tell beforehand contradictions, rendering the DAC policy document that a stakeholder will prefer a particular language. unacceptable at the moment. Notification helps in fulfilling a person’s request, and therefore becomes important. It is important to note It is hoped that on its next appearance before this that notification does not apply to o icial languages. hearing, DAC will submit properly formulated documents which elevate and advance the status of the indigenous DAC operates in a bureaucratic space and must, for languages by fostering the spirit of multilingualism example, adhere to procurement practices for assigning among colleagues, within DAC premises, and in interpreters. It argued that available resources need to communication with the broader communities of South be considered. Likewise, the Constitution makes this Africa it services – all these done in order to promote and consideration to PanSALB when the latter assigns the respect multilingualis for social cohesion and nation Sign language and the Khoisan languages promotion building. responsibility to the former (PanSALB). On the question of language units demanding budget, the DAC said that the PanSALB panel knows well that one does not always get the budget one wants. The same holds true for PanSALB, and this has nothing to do with policies; one has to look at budgeting beyond the issue of policy. But the issue of budget should not be discussed at this hearing. In response to the comment and question from the audience member, DAC said that it is one of 47 government departments to implement UOLA. A erall PanSALB has only recently begun monitoring compliance with this Act; the DAC has however been performing that role. Conclusion It is true that DAC is one of those national government departments that submitted its documents early. There seems to have been some confusion with regards to fulfilling the prescripts of section 4(2)(3) and 5(a)(b) Act, 2012, though. That led to the unfortunate submission of a facsimile of the Languages Act, 2012 instead of a properly constituted multilingual language policy and the implementation plan detailing how the prescripts of the Act would be carried out. Thus, at the moment, DAC has no acceptable language policy, implementation plan and language unit. Section 5.1.2 of the DAC policy document explains the work of DAC as developing, promoting and protecting the o icial languages of South Africa and enhancing the linguistic diversity of the country through policy formulation and implementation. This statement resonates with the provisions of sections 6(2-4) of the 17 Day 1 13 February 2017 Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries 18 5.2 Department of Agriculture, using regional languages, as well as MINMEC Forestry and Fisheries requirements.

It stated Sotho grouping – for now. Documentation is made that while UOLA stipulates that government available in these four languages. departments choose a minimum of three of the o icial languages in which to operate, it would be more helpful However, DAFF knows that, given the historical to choose languages regionally instead of having four dominance of agriculture by Afrikaners, the majority of overalls.

DAFF promised to rework its DAFF was asked whether the department has a language policy document and to establish a language unit and unit, what it role is, how much budget it has and what hand the document(s) over to PanSALB. powers it has within the departmental executive structure. The answer was a negation, which prompted the panel to advise that question of power is important because most departments will create a peripheral body to simply tick box as a mark of meeting bare minimum requirement -sheer malicious compliance. It was also noted that language choice for service delivery is skewed towards what the ministers and the asosciates principals of the department prefer instead of the departmental cumtomers (cf. para: 2 page15). This is wrong and needs to be stopped immediately. Government ministers are people’s servants, and not the other way around. The panel hoped that more progress would have been made by the time PanSALB meets with DAFF again. Response DAFF said that when it engages with communities, programme directors are always members of the communities. It is fortunate that the minister and deputy minister, between them, also speak many of South Africa’s o icial languages. It conceded that it had used the Government Gazette format for dra ing its language policy, but now realised that what it has is not a policy document. Thus, it would look into reworking the document according to its own mandate and in terms UOLA. It conceded that it does not yet have a language unit. Insteadit established Editorial Service Unit to translate departmental documents from English and Afrikaans vice versa. DAFF’s attempt to establish the language unit was scuppered by a change of 20 Day 1 13 February 2017 Department of Communications 21 09 5.3.

DoC said that it recognises that section the Act according to its own departmental mandate. It stressed that DoC needs to study what multilingualism 22 entails and how to create space within its business operations for indigenous languages to operate. Response DoC repeated its earlier statement that it has yet to embark on the process of developing a language policy, but it does already use the o icial languages in its DTT programme. A plan is in place to kick-start the process; GCIS, with which DoC shares a building, already has a policy and language unit, and it will work with it to develop its own policy document and establish a language unit, as advised. It confessed that in all honesty, development of a language policy and establishment of a language unit had not been in its plans until PanSALB queried the matter. Conclusion DoC does have neither the language policy nor language unit, as per the UOLA requirement. It however promised address this matter and ultimately submit its document to pansalb for guidance. 23 Day 2 14 February 2017 Department of Defence and Military Veterans 24 5.4.

It also said the Defence Minister has indicated that multilingualism is an endeavour of the entire DoD, and In the reviewed language policy, each principal is not just individuals.

This helps to ensure that adequate funding social cohesion is critical in every setting, be it at home, and resources are made available. When there are in the workplace or at social occasions.

DoD’s point of departure, with regards to an adopted in terms of UOLA. The aim of the hearing was to indigenous language audit, has been to research establish, monitor and investigate national government language preferences, which it correlated with 2011 departments’ observance of the Constitutional Census information. It then assessed proficiency among provisions regarding the use of languages and the its members in various languages. At the beginning of provisions of the UOLA, and further to monitor whether each financial year the DoD conducts skills audit which language units deal with implementation of the Act once goes hand in glove with its language requirements; this established. DOD was advised to develop its policy and extends not only to o icial languages, but to all establish a language unit in terms of the prescripts of the languages utilised by DoD. This information then informs UOLA. It was further advised to adopt a strategic bias language training requirements. There is a dire need for towards entrenching previously marginalised o icial people to learn each other’s languages. One way of languages it formal dialy business. addressing this is blended e-learning, where people can access the DoD’s intranet at lunchtimes and learn other languages. Opportunities are being opened up, and language needs and achievements are reported in the DoD’s internal newsletter, The Soldier. It said that when it comes to satellite o ices, the Language Services Unit is one of the government’s oldest and has evolved over time, but there has been attrition and several of its language practitioners were either retiring or had gone elsewhere. This is why there are no satellite o ices in some regions. Regarding its powers, the Language Services Unit follows a command line within DoD. It reports to the chief director of human resources development, who in turn reports to the chief of human resources. This chain of command then moves up to the chief of the SANDF, the deputy minister and the minister. Everything tabled in the department is escalated accordingly.

Two questions arise: what about the form of business transaction.

EDD, the panel added, must design its stated clearly in the Constitution. EDD must use multilingual language policy with clearly articulated previously marginalised indigenous o icial languages objectives and with a time-framed implementation plan. within its working environment. Translations into other It further enquired from EDD whether it would have o icial languages could be made but it is much better to considered introducing multilingual language policy encourage the direct use of previous marginalised within its milieu had it not been called to appear before African o icial languages to promote multilingualism this panel. within the EDD working environments. This should matter the most and always be on EED’s mind when it The panel questioned validity of EDD statement that it establishes its language unit. It is a non-negotiable had adopted all 11 o icial languages. It made EDD to requirement, as per the prescripts of the Constitution of concede that it is irresponsible to use English as the only the RSA and UOLA. language of o icial communication and business transaction. EDD had not critically examined the The panel referred EDD to the presentation made by the framework it had been given by the UOLA. It was encouraged to promote multilingualism in carrying out Department of Defence and Military Veterans wherein its corefunctions. Systematic limitation of space accessed by the languages spoken by majority of South specific aims and purpose were cleary articulated.

This of the UOLA instructions, and a misunderstanding of peremptorily denotes that, contrary to the claim current made in its presentation, EDD does not have a language what must be done.

This phrasing ignores the languages within its working environment. It has been using English in its meetings, for example, “because national multilingual agenda. It should instead be rephrased as follows, “the purpose of EDD’s policy is to provide economic development through multilingualism. The panel pointed out that the EDD is a very important government department. South Africa does not have an inclusive economy for the nation. Food production is mostly controlled by the Afrikaans-speaking part of the country and mining and large industry by the English- speaking part. The nine indigenous languages, used by the majority of the South African population are surprisingly excluded from an economy developed by 30 there must be a common language”. It however takes the point made by the panel for serious consideration. Although its language policy is framed in the future tense, work has already started in small ways to do what the panel proposed with regard to engaging stakeholders in previously marginalised indigenous South African languages. Documents are being prepared in the 11 o icial languages, and for now they have been done in English, Setswana, Sesotho, isiNdebele and isiZulu. When the department engages with the communities for whom those documents are intended, it ensures that someone who is fluent in those languages convenes meetings and speaks to people in their language (NB: unfortunately, this was new information, not contained in either the EDD language policy document or its presentation). EDD agreed to stop the gazetting of its language policy. Instead it shall “re-examine” it altogether in accordance with its mandate. It used “the guidelines presented to it by the DAC”. It however considered language policy without preempting of an appearance before PanSALB. Language is o en debated within the department, particularly because it cannot seem to obtain approval for the establishment of a language unit, and it does not enjoy the support it deserves from the superiors. Conclusion EDD will not gazette its language policy document as it initially planned. A review process of this document shall be commenced to align it with the advice proposed by the panel. 31 Day 2 14 February 2017 Department of Energy 32 5.6.
