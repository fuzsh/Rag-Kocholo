        "text": "Press Release\n\nFrom March 8 to 17, Casa Garden will host the 13th edition of The Script Road – Macau Literary Festival. This is a return of the event to spring, after a forced move to fall during the pandemic years. The highlight of this edition of The Script Road will be the celebration of the poetry of Li Bai and Luís de Camões. Among the guests, Chinese author Dong Xi, winner of the 11th Mao Dun Prize for Literature, and American novelist Chang-era Lee, finalist of the Pulitzer Prize, are the most notable names. In an event that also marks the 50th anniversary of the Portuguese Carnation Revolution of 1974, writer and journalist João Céu e Silva, author and illustrator Fido Nesti and guitarist Marta Pereira da Costa are among the representatives from the Portuguese-speaking world.\n\n“We’ve always felt that it makes the most sense to hold the Macau Literary Festival in March, as it’s the time of year when the events calendar is not so packed. That’s why, at the first opportunity, and after several editions held in October and November due to the pandemic, we decided to return the festival to its original date,” says Ricardo Pinto, director of The Script Road.\n\nThis year’s edition of the Macau Literary Festival, and the previous one, held just five months ago, have in common the celebration of the fifth centenary of the birth of poet Luís de Camões. Casa Garden, located nearby the poet’s famous grotto, will be visited by Kenneth David Jackson, professor at Yale University and author of several Camonian studies. Brazilian illustrator Fido Nesti will also evoke the work of Camões through his adaptation of the epic poem ‘Os Lusíadas’ for children.\n\nAnother great name of universal poetry will be remembered at the opening event of the festival. The life and work of Li Bai is the subject of a photography exhibition by Xu Peiwu, a Chinese artist who over the last decade has traveled the same paths where the poet walked more than a thousand years ago, recording the landscapes that inspired him as he wandered through vast and scattered regions of China. They are images “of enormous beauty and density, which allow us to contemplate a naked and captivating China”, says João Miguel Barros, the exhibition’s curator. At the opening session, publisher Carlos Morais José will also present the book ‘Li Bai – A Via do Imortal’, by António Izidro.\n\nThe first weekend of the festival, from March 8 to 10, will host the presentation of several other works. San San, one of the most awarded young Chinese writers, will present her anthology of short stories ‘Late Spring’, which was among the strongest candidates for the 2023 Literary Prize from Douban, China’s online social network with a large footprint in literary circles. American James Zimmerman, a lawyer who has lived in the Chinese capital for more than 25 years, is coming to Macau to present ‘The Peking Express’, an investigative work that tells the story of the Great Railway Robbery of 1923, an event that set the course for China’s two-decade civil war. And New Zealand-born author Ian Gill, who is the child of his parents’ war-time romance in a prison camp in Hong Kong, will discuss his book ‘Searching for Billie’, a journalist’s quest to understand his mother’s past that leads him to discover a vanishing China.\n\nAnother notable guest to hear speak will be Ma Ka Fai, Hong Kong writer and filmmaker, professor of creative writing at City University and author of dozens of bestselling books of essays. ‘Once upon a time in Hong Kong’ is his debut novel.\n\nThe 50th anniversary of the Portuguese April 25 democratic Revolution will also be commemorated during the first days of the festival. João Céu e Silva will present to the Macau public his work ‘The General who started April 25 two months before the captains’ –the never-before-told story of how General António Spínola brought down the old regime.\n\nAn exhibition on the 50-year career of photographer António Mil-Homens – who began his journey with photography precisely on April 25, 1974, when he covered some of the most significant episodes of the revolution – will take place during the week at the Portuguese Bookshop Gallery, before the panels return to Casa Garden for the second weekend of the Festival.\n\nMacau cuisine will be the central theme of the sessions on Friday, March 15. Authors Graça Pacheco Jorge and Annabel Jackson, both of whom have publications on this topic, will be joined by Professor Barrie Sherwood, from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, for a discussion on the current state of Macanese gastronomy and related cultural identity issues. ‘The Macanese Pro-Wrestler’s Cookbook’, written by Prof. Sherwood will be presented to local audiences at the session.\n\nThe program of Saturday March 16 will be dominated by women’s writing, featuring a proposed dialogue combining writers from Macau, Hong Kong, and Mainland China. ‘The Girl Who Dreamed: A Hong Kong Memoir of Triumph Against the Odds’, by Sonia Leung, has been described as an important milestone in the literature of the neighboring city, as never before have the first-person experiences of poor immigrants from the Mainland, who arrived in Hong Kong in the 1980s, been narrated in such detail from the perspective of a young woman.\n\nThe penultimate day the festival will also welcome two big names in this year’s program. Dong Xi, who in addition to the 2023 Mao Dun Literature Prize has also been awarded the Lu Xun Prize, will share his vast experience in the world of creative writing with several Macau authors. “As one of today’s most representative writers, Dong Xi is recognized for his unusual ability to tell stories in his own narrative language,” said Yao Jingming, deputy director of The Script Road – Macau Literary Festival.\n\nChang-rae Lee, an American writer of Korean origin, and himself a creative writing teacher at Stanford University in California, will be presenting his latest novel, ‘My Year Abroad’, which is partly set in Macau. His writing often explores themes such as immigration, assimilation, Korean history, the experience of Asian-Americans, and dystopian America. Among several other distinctions, the author was awarded the Hemingway Foundation/PEN Prize for first fiction for his novel ‘Native Speaker’.\n\nSaturday’s program comes to an end with a concert by Marta Pereira da Costa, widely acclaimed as one of the most virtuoso Portuguese guitar players of her generation. In Macau, she will be backed on stage by João José Pita. Other performances will be promoted in collaboration with Bookand, an independent local bookstore and café.\n\nTraditionally, the last day of the festival is largely reserved for visual arts publications – and this year will be no exception. Local photographer João Miguel Barros and Halftone association will reveal their most recent productions in Casa Garden. Additionally, Portuguese academic Duarte Drumond Braga will be presenting his study of Camilo Pessanha’s ‘China and Macau’, recently released in Portugal. And Peter Rose, an American lawyer turned author, is launching his first novel, ‘The Good War of Consul Reeves’, which is set against the backdrop of the Pacific War in Macau and the efforts of the lonely British diplomat to help the fight against the Japanese. The novel was published by Blacksmith Books, a prolific publishing house based in Hong Kong.\n\nAs in previous years, the Macau Literary Festival has the support of the Macau Government, through the Cultural Development Fund, as well as several other public and private institutions in the region. The Orient Foundation is once again hosting the event in Casa Garden. In addition to the official program, the festival guests will also visit local schools and associations.\n\nThe event’s detailed program will be released to the media in the coming days.\n\nFor more information, please contact:\n\nAska Cheong: +853 6622 3215\n\nKathine Cheong: +853 6688 2821\n\nMedia.macauliteraryfestival@gmail.com | Info.macauliteraryfestival@gmail.com\n\n“Guerrilla Samba”, by Luca Argel\n\nHISTORY OF BRAZIL IN THREE ACTS\n\nMusic and literature intersect in this “samba opera”, created by the Rio de Janeiro-based artist based in Porto. Luca Argel’s “Samba de Guerrilha” can already be heard around the world.\n\nSamba de Guerrilha is a multi-disciplinary show, which crosses Luca Argel’s music with real time illustration by António Jorge Gonçalves and with the word, narrated by the luso-angolan actress Nádia Yracema. It has started in 2016, and grew over 5 years until it became a record. It was born as a concert-workshop about the political history of samba. Off stage, it took the form of written articles, seminars, radio shows, until finally becoming Luca Argel’s 4th album.\n\nSamba de Guerrilha is a journey through time, where we meet stories and characters from the fight against racism, slavery and inequality. We hear the narrative in the form of samba, but a samba that, this time, is permanently testing the limits of its musical possibilities, a reinvented, electrified samba, born an ocean away from tradition.\n\nAccording to Luca Argel, Samba de Guerrilha was conceived as “a samba opera” divided into three acts, through which the History of Brazil is told. Composed of daring versions of samba classics, which reveal themselves to be an “interesting instrument of historical research”, the record is based on the premise of demonstrating how old issues from colonial times and the early years of Brazil as a nation, especially slavery, continue, even today, to condition the lives of millions of people, in the form of racism, poverty and all kinds of social discrimination.\n\nThe first act begins to the sound of Samba do Operário, a theme written by the mythical Cartola in partnership with a Portuguese from Alfama, called Alfredo, who settled in the Mangueira slum in flight from the dictatorship of Salazar. The tracks are preceded by a narration which historically and socially contextualises each moment – in the voice of the Luso-Angolan rapper Telma Tvon. The contrast between the singing voice, of a white Brazilian man, and the narration, of a black African woman, is “very symbolic”, and works very well.\n\nThe second act recalls the abolition of slavery, but the two jongos (a musical style that preceded samba) that follow show how everything stayed almost the same, or worse, leading to the exodus to the big cities, where marginalisation continued, as can be seen when listening to Direito de Sambar or Agoniza mas Não Morre. The third act reveals João Cândido, a black sailor who, in 1910, led the Revolta da Chibata, against the physical punishments still in force in the Navy. The “black admiral” would be immortalized in the samba of the same name, banned by censorship because the admiral’s rank could not be associated with the word “negro”. But without people like him, Uma História Diferente, the samba chosen to close the record, would never have been written.\n\n14/10/2023\n\nVenue: BROADWAY THEATRE, BROADWAY MACAUTM\n\nDuration of the show: 1h 40m\n\nSubtitled in Chinese & English\n\nShow Ticketing Counter at Broadway Macautm\n\nTicketing: +853‭ ‬8883‭ ‬3383‭ / broadwaymacau.com.mo / ‬showticket@galaxyentertainment.com\n\n‬Buy online‭\n\nThe artists\n\nLuca Argel was born in 1988 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and has a degree in music from UNIRIO and a master’s degree in Literature from the University of Porto. He has poetry books published in Brazil, Spain and Portugal, one of which was a semi-finalist for the Oceans Prize 2017.\n\nBetween working as a vocalist and composer, whether in collective projects or soundtracks for film and dance, and signing radio programs dedicated to Brazilian music, he has been developing his solo career at a consistent and growing pace with hits such as “Samba de Guerrilha” and “Anos Doze”.\n\nAntónio Jorge Gonçalves (Lisbon, Portugal, 19 October 1964) is a Portuguese comic book author, cartoonist, visual performer, illustrator, set designer and teacher. He is the author of several Graphic Novels, and has collaborated with several writers – Rui Zink, Ondjaki or Mário de Carvalho – in creating books where text and image relate in an exploratory way. He has received in 2013 the National Prize for Illustration (Portugal) for the book “uma escuridão bonita” (with Ondjaki).\n\nHe has done set and costume design for several theatre plays. Through the method of Real Time Digital Drawing and the manipulation of objects in Transparency Overhead Projector, he has created shows with musicians, actors and dancers. He wrote and directed the film/show Lisboa quem és tu? to be projected on the walls of São Jorge Castle in Lisbon.\n\nNádia Yracema was born on July 3, 1988, in Luanda, Angola. She started learning and acting with the Coimbra University Theatre, completing her training in the 2007/2008 school year, while pursuing a degree in Law at the University of Coimbra. She joined the acting course at the Lisbon Theatre and Film School in 2012.\n\nShe has often performed in theatre productions, working with Portuguese and international directors. She is also actively engaged in several social bodies that foster collaborative work in film, theatre and performance.

Children literature is one of the highlights.\n\nThe Script Road – Macau Literary Festival is back for its 4th edition, scheduled to happen from March 19 to 29, 2015, with its base at the Old Court Building. The festival, founded by local newspaper Ponto Final in 2012 as the first grand meeting of literates from China and Portuguese Speaking Countries ever to be organized in the world, is bringing again more than 30 renown guests to town – writers, publishers, filmmakers, visual artists and musicians.\n\nChinese writer Wang Anyi, Chairwoman of Writers’ Association of Shanghai and author of novels such as The Song of Everlasting Sorrow, is amongst the star guests this year. On the Portuguese-speaking side, Angolan author Ondjaki, winner of the prestigious Jabuti Prize (2010) for his novel Avódezanove e o Segredo do Soviético, and the Saramago Prize (2013) for Os Transparentes is one of the most highlighted names.\n\n“This is year, for the first time, we’re inviting the youngest readers to join the Festival, by having children literature writers highlighted at The Script Road. Overall, it’s going to be a festival aiming to have the attention of the youth, as it’s also noticeable by some of the musicians and visual artists we’ve invited”, says Macau Literary Festival Director, Ricardo Pinto.\n\nHongkongnese novelist Wong Bik-wan is also joining the Macau Literary Festival for a stage-performance, after winning the Dream of Red Chamber Award last year with the novel Children of Darkness. Acclaimed Chinese poet Xi Chuan and Taiwanese poet and Curator of the Taipei Poetry Festival, Hung Hung; one of the most famous children literature authors in China, Yang Hongying; renown younger writers Yan Ge (White Horse) and Murong Xuecun (Leave Me Alone – A Novel of Chengdu) complete the confirmed list of Chinese-speaking authors to attend the event.\n\n“The 2015 Macau Literary Festival is going to bring a stunning line-up of Chinese authors. For Mainland Chinese authors, Wang Anyi is one of the best contemporary novelist in China. We are also delighted to have the renowned critical writer and New York Times columnist Murong Xuecun as well as the young novelist Yan Ge, who has already published ten novels, to join this year. In addition we are glad to present the Hong Kong well-known author Wong Bik-wan, the Taiwanese poet and screenwriter Hung Hung and also the Macau local award-winning author Joe Tang. For children literature, this year the festival is bringing you the Chinese children’s favourite author Yang Hongying, who has been nominated for the Hans Christian Andersen Literature Award in 2014”, says The Script Road Vice-Director, Yao Jing Ming.\n\nFrom Portugal, The Script Road is welcoming novelist and former Culture Secretary of State, Francisco José Viegas (Longe de Manaus); Saramago Prize winner João Tordo (As Três Vidas, O Bom Inverno), poet, children literature writer and acclaimed literary editor Maria do Rosário Pedreira (Poesia Reunida, A Minha Primeira Amália); and novelist and award-winning children literature writer David Machado (O Fabuloso Teatro do Gigante, Noite dos Animais Inventados).\n\nMoving to Brazil, The Script Road is brining poet and acclaimed comedian as part of the group Porta dos Fundos, Gregório Duviver, author of A Partir De Amanhã Eu Juro Que A Vida Vai Ser Agora.\n\n“The group of Lusophone writers we’re bringing to Macau this year is again quite relevant. They’re award-winning authors, popular and well received by the critic, as well as translated to other languages. Both poetry, with Maria do Rosário Pedreira and Gregório Duvivier; and novel, with Ondjaki, Francisco José Viegas, João Tordo and David Machado, are very well represented. Plus, most of these authors are also writing in different genres and many of them publishing books for younger audiences that we really want to attract this year”, says The Script Road Vice-Director, Hélder Beja.\n\nLocal writers will also take the stage and visit schools and universities. Novelist and children literature Joe Tang is one of the invited guests to form part of the programme. Macanese Cecília Jorge, whose writing about Macanese cuisine became popular along the years, is also joining this year’s Literary Festival, as well as Rogério Beltrão Coelho, author and publisher working for many years on Macau’s literature.\n\nAs in previous years, the festival will promote talks, book launches, workshops and a series of different activities open to everyone.\n\nThe 3rd volume of the collection The Script Road – Short Stories and Other Writings will be launched during this year’s edition. Invited guests from the 2014 edition will see their stories, poems and essays published alongside with the winners of The Script Road Short Story Competition, to be announced at the festival’s press conference, in early March.\n\nLITERATURE AND CINEMA TOGETHER\n\nAnother highlight of The Script Road’s 4th edition is the film programming, with acclaimed filmmakers Ann Hui and João Botelho coming to Macau to show their latest films.\n\nAnn Hui, who was awarded last year as Asian Filmmaker of the Year at Busan International Film Festival, is showing The Golden Era, a biopic drama about 1930s author Xiao Hong, one of the most important female writers in 20th century China, starring Tang Wei and Feng Shaofeng.\n\nPortuguese director João Botelho is bringing two films with him: Os Mais, adaptation of one of the most relevant novels in Portuguese Literature, written by Eça de Queiroz; and Filme do Desassossego, where Botelho searches for inspiration in Fernando Pessoa’s remarkable poetic voice.\n\nMiguel Costa, also coming from Portugal, will be showing No Divã, a film starring Paulo Pires, Baastet Cabeleira and Maestro António Victorino d’Almeida. Victorino d’Almeida, himself a writer, musician and famous TV broadcaster, is also a guest of this year’s festival, promises to delight local audiences with his words but also with his universal music, by giving two concerts.\n\nThe Macau Literary Festival will also hold three solo visual arts exhibitions this year. Ge Zhen, one of Mainland China’s most relevant contemporary painters, Tyrone Ho, Architect and renowned comic artist from Hong Kong, and João Fazenda, an internationally acclaimed illustrator from Portugal, will all join the event.\n\nSCRIPT ROAD UNITES MUSIC AND POETRY AT THE VENETIAN MACAO\n\nLyrical flow and sonic intensity join forces on The Venetian® Macao’s Cotai Arena stage March 21st, 8pm, as The Script Road brings Macau a triple bill, heavy on the hip hop, featuring Hong Kong’s legendary LMF and the gab-gifted Gabriel o Pensador from Brazil. Macau’s own boisterous Blademark leads the charge.\n\nSponsored by Sands China Ltd. for the third consecutive year, The Script Road Concert has become one of the most highly-anticipated events on the Macau Literary Festival programme and a fixture in Macau’s cultural calendar which is yet another strong testament to Sands China’s continuing contribution to the development of arts and culture in Macau. Events like The Script Road Concert aim to enrich the cultural landscape of Macau and to facilitate cultural exchange.\n\nHeadlining the equinoctial event is a tireless Cantonese hip hop collective. Courageous in the face of controversy, they’ve been standing up for their beliefs and their community and culture since the early 90s. LMF is a large group with a stirring stage presence that features four emcees plus an award-winning turntablist and full rock band. They reformed in 2009 after a six-year hiatus following the release of their last album finalazy. This reunion also marked the ten-year anniversary of their debut release, LazyMuthaFucka which sold 100,000 copies worldwide which was an unprecedented triumph for a Hong Kong indie band. This pioneering posse has given voice to a generation of disenfranchised Hong Kong youth with an energetic blend of metal and funk, underpinning hip hop lyrics that cultivate self-worth and critique the establishment in equal measure.\n\nSocial and moral critique have another vehicle in the vocabulary of Brazilian rapper Gabriel o Pensador. The Thinker’s beginnings date back to the early 90s, as well, when his first, self-titled album garnered attention for the caustic wit in tracks like “Lôrabúrra” (Dumblonde), “Retrato de um Playboy” (Portrait of a Playboy) and “Lavagem Cerebral” (Brainwashing). Over the next twelve years he would release another six albums and expand his renown both at home, opening for U2’s Brazilian tour in 1998, and overseas, winning legions of fans on the Portuguese festival circuit. Following a seven-year respite from the recording studio, Gabriel has “returned to hip hop” with Sem Crise which features electronic tracks and heavy stylistic flirtation with such Brazilian musical styles as forró and baião. Of the fifth track, “Linhas Tortas” (Crooked Lines), which traces the long arc of his career and his sources of inspiration, Gabriel says, “I break out in gooseflesh whenever I sing it live.”\n\nLive performances are bread and butter for a band like Blademark. One of Macau’s most prolific and hardest working musical acts, they are celebrating their tenth anniversary this year. It is their boundless energy that keeps them fresh as well as being the key ingredient in their metal sound that has been infused with elements of rap, funk and melodic rock. An international quartet, representative of cosmopolitan Macau, Macanese founder and front man Fortes Pakeong Sequeira and bassist Raymond Nogueira were joined in 2013 by Japanese guitarist Akitsugu Fukushima and Canadian drummer Darren Kopas. Their potent set will set the stage for an inspiring night of rhythm and rhyme.\n\nTickets for the 8 p.m., Mar. 21, 2015 performance of The Script Road Concert at the Cotai Arena go on sale Tuesday, Feb. 17 via Cotai Ticketing, and can be purchased from HKD/MOP 200 until Feb 28, and MOP 300 from March 1 till March 21.

That’s the spirit that drives us. Yes, this festival will not be like the first one”, said Ricardo Pinto.\n\nThe Director started his speech with a tribute to the architect Manuel Vicente and described the “great loss for Macau which was the death yesterday (Saturday) of Manuel Vicente, rightly regarded as ‘The Architect of Macau'”. Ricardo Pinto went on to describe him as a “man of a great intelligence and a unique sense of humour” who helped “many generations to think Macau, he made ​​many people love Macau”.\n\nThe Vice President of the Cultural Institute and Deputy Director of The Script Road, Jing Yao Ming, thanked the guests from around the world for their presence and stressed that Macau is a place of rich cultural diversity, “its writers come from different countries and backgrounds and have different cultures” and proposed the question “how can we define the literature of Macau?”. Jing Yao Ming added that “there are still disputes and these disputes will continue,” and challenged the participants “maybe our invited experts of the literary world can discuss and answer this question”.\n\nThe representative of Macao Foundation at the ceremony, Zhong Yi Seabra de Mascarenhas, said that “Macao Foundation believes that, today, our town is increasingly feeling the influences of globalization”, adding “to this end the Macau Literary Festival – The Script Road has created, not only a meeting place for different cultures, but also new opportunities to show the world what is being done in Macau today, namely in the world of literature”.\n\n“Placing Macau in contemporary literature is one of the founding ideas of the Macau Literary Festival – The Script Road” said the Deputy Director of the festival, Hélder Beja, who presented the festival’s first book in the collection of stories and essays. Entitled First things First, this book resulted from the first edition of the festival and is “a happy synthesis of those unforgettable moments when Macau rediscovered itself through The Script Road” added Ricardo Pinto. The opening ceremony also saw the awarding of prizes to some of the short story competition winners present at the ceremony, Susana Gonçalves, Kelvin Costa, Célia Matias and Lawrence Lei.\n\nThe first panel of the Festival, Writers’ Influences and Perspectives in a Globalised World, moderated by Agnes Lam, featured enthusiastic participation by several guests, including Pan Lei from Macau, Mauro Munhoz from Brazil, the Chinese authors Bi Feiyu and Yi Sha, the Timorese Luís Cardoso, the Portuguese author Dulce Maria Cardoso and Angolan writer José Eduardo Agualusa. The “history of mankind is a history of encounters and disencounters and what is important is for these encounters to be done in peace and with respect for one another, as we are doing here today at this literary meeting. I have a deep dislike of the idea of pure cultures, as much as I dislike the idea of frontiers and police, I dream that one day all the border police turn into architects and build bridges”, said José Eduardo Agualusa. Luis Cardoso spoke of his role as a “Timorese diplomat in the world” during the struggle for independence of East Timor against Indonesia and the importance of the relationship between Timor and Macau. “Many Macanese were exiled to Timor during the colonial period and many Macanese married Timorese, had children and many Timorese fought for the independence of East Timor”, said Luis Cardoso.\n\nOn the topic of cultural globalization the author Dulce Maria Cardoso said that “What we are talking about here is a political issue, which is citizens being more open to the world”.\n\nAfter the dynamic discussion the official opening of the Book Fair in the Praça da Amizade (Hotel Sintra Square) took place, providing a unique opportunity for the public to meet the authors and get autographs. The opening day ended with a dynamic concert by Croatian jazz singer Ines Trickovic.\n\n“It’s good that tangible works result from The Script Road” director Miguel Gonçalves Mendes\n\nThe opening day began with the premiere of the film “Nada tenho de meu – work in progress” by Miguel Gonçalves Mendes, and after a discussion with the audience the director said that it would be good if the Macau Literary Festival – The Script Road resulted in tangible projects like this film, that brought together three writers, actors and directors. Miguel Gonçalves Mendes is already working on another project, taking advantage of his return to Macau to film the Portuguese writer Valter Hugo Mãe for a new project called “O sentido da vida”, in co-production with Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles.\n\n“I Love Macau”, T (H) REE and Bernardo Devlin in pre-opening concert on Saturday\n\nPraça da Amizade was the location for the pre-opening event of The Script Road, with a small sample of the book fair and concerts, which took place on Saturday night, anticipating a week filled with many events. “I have love for Macau” the musician Wilson Tsang, from the cultural project T (H) REE, said, a project which gathers musicians from Portugal and several Asian countries. The T (H) REE project, along with the Portuguese musician Bernard Devlin, took the stage, animating the night before the official opening of the event.\n\nThe 2nd edition of The Script Road – Macau Literary Festival will be held from March 10 to 16 and will bring to the city more than 30 renowned writers, publishers, translators, journalists, musicians, filmmakers, visual artists and more.\n\nThis year the event will receive even further significant support from the Cultural Affairs Bureau of Macau and the Macau Foundation, who now co-organise the festival together with Ponto Final newspaper.\n\nFollowing last year’s model, conferences and debates will take place alongside a book fair, art exhibitions, music concerts and film screenings.\n\nThe 2013 Festival programme will feature prominent contemporary Chinese writers including Bi Feiyu, winner of some of the highest literary awards in China; Han Shaogong, author of “A Dictionary of Maqiao” and translator of the work of Fernando Pessoa; Hong Ying, one of the best internationally known Chinese writers; and Yi Sha, a controversial contemporary poet. Other names such as Sheng Keyi, Qiu Huadong, Pan Wei, Wang Gang, Huang Lihai, Li Shao Jun and Taiwanese poet Xi Murong are also very influential writers in contemporary Chinese literature – and all of them will be joining the festival.\n\nOn the Portuguese-speaking side, The Script Road is inviting Dulce Maria Cardoso, one of the greatest novelists of her generation; Rui Zink and Ricardo Araújo Pereira, who work with language and humour in a very special way; Francisco José Viegas, former Portuguese Culture Secretary of State, writer and publisher; Valter Hugo Mãe, recent winner the PT Prize, one of the most prestigious literary prizes for Portuguese-speaking authors; writer and journalist Alexandra Lucas Coelho; journalist and translator Carlos Vaz Marques; publisher Bárbara Bulhosa; and, with the support of Casa de Portugal, novelist Deana Barroqueiro.\n\nJosé Eduardo Agualusa, an Angolan author and one of the best-known Portuguese-speaking contemporary African writers, will also join this festival edition, as will Luís Cardoso, probably the most important literary voice from East Timor. From Brazil the poet Regis Bonvicino and Paraty Festival director Mauro Munhoz have already been confirmed to take part. Paloma and Cecília Amado, daughter and granddaughter of Jorge Amado (1912-2001), one of the greatest Brazilian novelists of all time, are coming to Macau to pay homage to his work by showing a documentary and a fiction film based on his life and on one of his books, respectively.\n\nA number of local writers, including poet Fernanda Dias, Tong Mui Siu, Chek In, Lou Mou and Wong Man Fai, are also among the invited guests, representing the Macau literary scene.\n\nThe Script Road has also decided to gradually open the event to other Asian and Latin writers, and that’s why this year we welcome French authors Antoine Volodine and Claude Hudelot, who have both already developed affinities with Macau, China and the Lusophone world.\n\nOne of the highlights of the festival’s programme will be the launch of a book of short stories set in the territory. At last year’s edition of The Script Road audiences were invited to take part in a short story competition, judged by a panel composed of the visiting international authors at the event: Su Tong, José Luís Peixoto and Xu Xi, one from each language, Chinese, Portuguese and English. From more than 30 entries, a number of stories were chosen for publication and the winners will be announced at the Festival’s press conference.\n\nThese short stories will be published together with stories written by last year’s guest writers, such as José Luís Peixoto, Lolita Hu, João Paulo Cuenca, Jimmy Qi and Rui Cardoso Martins. This year the Festival is again inviting all visiting authors to write about Macau.\n\nThe Script Road will feature some cinematic highlights. The award-winning film The Last Time I Saw Macau, by João Pedro Rodrigues and João Rui Guerra da Mata will have its Chinese pre-premier at the festival, before being presented at the Hong Kong International Film Festival. This is probably the most important and awarded film about this city made in the last decades.\n\nThe Chinese filmmaker Wiseman Wang will bring us Journey to the South, a road movie where a truck driver crosses China, heading south to Guangdong province, trying to earn money to solve family issues.\n\nMacau-based director Ivo Ferreira will also screen his new film, On The Dragon’s Flake, and historian and sinologist Claude Hudelot will present Hou Bo, Xu Xiaobing, Mao’s Photographers, a documentary he directed together with Jean-Michel Vecchiet.\n\nAs with last year’s festival, music will again play an important part in the 2013 event. Portugal’s finest traditional music will be performed by celebrated fado singer Camané. The Portuguese folk musical band Dead Combo, one of the most interesting music projects in Portugal and which gained international acclaim after appearing on Anthony Bourdain’s world popular TV Show No Reservations, is also confirmed to take to the stage.\n\nThe Script Road will host two artists-in residence based at the Orient Foundation; Chen Yu from China and Theodore Mesquita from Goa. The two painters, from very different backgrounds, will follow the same brief: to create works that reflect their experience of Macau. As well as creating new art, they will also be exhibiting previous works in the lower gallery of the Orient Foundation.\n\nAnother exhibition, curated by the local artist Alice Kok, will be held at the Old Court Building where a number of local creative authors will work on the theme Beyond Words.\n\nIn cooperation with the Education and Youth Affairs Bureau, the Festival aims to establish a strong connection with local schools and universities, giving young readers a chance to get in touch with the guest authors.\n\nThis year’s festival has the support of the Macau University (UMAC), the Pen Club, the Institute for Civic Affairs (IACM), the Macau Tourism Bureau, the Macau Education and Youth Affairs Bureau, the Society of Arts and Letters, IPOR, the Orient Foundation, Macau Closer, the Portuguese Bookshop and Casa de Portugal as well as other public and private entities.\n\nOn the third day of the literary festival, a group of fours writers from Portugal, Hong Kong, China and Macau were challenged to say if writing these days could still be a political tool.\n\nPortuguese best-selling author and journalist José Rodrigues dos Santos, who wrote among other works “The Wrath of God”, which deals with Islamism and extremism, has no doubt that “all art is political in a way, and all art has to be meaningful”, he defended.\n\nAn experienced reporter who covered many war zones from Iraq to Libya, author dos Santos claimed that as a novelist, he feels “more truthful when you write a novel,” as he is not restrained by the journalistic codes of delivering news. “Fiction is a very powerful tool to tell the truth,” he stated, adding that “writing is about freedom, and you have to say politically incorrect things to move things forwards.\n\nChinese author Jimmy Qi agreed and underlined that the writer “can be very political but it’s not a politician.” Qi’s opinion goes in fact further, defending that writers are in fact more important than politicians as their words resist the test of times. “. Without the writing of the bible, where would God be? And where would Confucius be?\n\nIn this sense, Macau’s writer and artist António Conceição Junior, who recently published “Conversas do Chá e do Café” (Tea and Coffee chats) “words are sacred and when we profit from someone’s’ knowledge, we are reliving the authors experience and benefiting from it.” That is why he sees the man as a political animal, who must act as political. “I cannot understand art for the sake of art. It always serves a purpose. The writer has like an agenda – which gives him the urge to write, to communicate,” he added.\n\nThis debate was concluded with the poignant testimonies of 87 years old Marvin Farkas, an American living in Hong Kong since 1954. This man of many lives was a Broadway star before coming to Hong Kong where he was filmmaker, working with stars like Orson Well,s and later a regional and war reporter, spending 12 years covering the Vietnam war. “I started to write at the age of 77 so I can speak my mind freely,” he said during the presentation of his memoirs “an Eastern Saga.”\n\nThe afternoon of this Tuesday was dedicated to the topic “Translation: limits and Possibilities.” Macau academic Yao Jin Ming, author of poetry and Chinese translator of Portuguese poet Eugénio de Andrade, stated that before the act of translating, “translators have to fall in love for the work. It’s a love process.” “Then, they will be able to translate,” he added.\n\nPrestigious writer Su Tong, author of “Rice” , “My Life as an Emperor,” and “Wives and Concubines”, with many of his books translated in different languages, described the translator as “a friend.” “When I do not understand a foreign language, I have to have a translator. He is therefore a friend and authors should respect him,” he said.\n\nWriter José Luis Peixoto, one of the most translated Portuguese authors in no less than 20 idioms, alerted for the risks of distortion of the original work that translation could cause. But these changes can also operate in favour of some books. “I read (Brazilian author) Paulo Coelho and was not impressed. But people tell me that his books in French are quite good,” he said with a smile.\n\nAsked about the language policy in Macau after the handover, the director of the Portuguese Oriental Institute, Rui Rocha explained that despite the official bilingual status of the territory, the reality showed that the Portuguese is not compulsory at Chinese schools and that the learning of Mandarin is also problematic in Portuguese ones. “That’s the state of the affairs,” he added.\n\nThe third day was also dedicated to two documentaries dealing with the plight of Chinese migrants in the world. Mozambican journalist and filmmaker Yara Costa presented “Why are they here? Chinese stories in Africa”, a film taking place in Mozambique island, Lesotho and Ghana, showing the relationships and tensions of Chinese immigrants with local populations.\n\nLast, but not least, filmmaker Ivo Ferreira showcased his 2009 documentary “Go with the Wind”, about the emotional dilemma of Chinese immigrants in Portugal and Spain and the home they left behind.\n\nTo wrap up Tuesday, famous Portuguese fado singer Aldina Duarte gave a concert at the University of Macau, where she paid tribute to Fado, the Portuguese traditional song, which was recently recognized by UNESCO as intangible heritage of humanity."
