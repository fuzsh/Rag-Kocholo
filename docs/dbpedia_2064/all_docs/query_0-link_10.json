        "text": "This essay explores the cultural translation of the Chinese classic, the Book of Changes or Yijing (易經) through a reflection on my own attempts to adapt, use and misuse the text in literary form. My own engagement with the Yijing began when I set out to write a novel- of sorts based on the Chinese classic. The process of writing this novel, Sixty-Four Chance Pieces: A Book of Changes (Earnshaw Books, 2015), has required not only that I culturally translate the Yijing, but that I allow myself to be culturally translated in turn by this text. By combining theoretical approaches from China and the West, and by crossing between theoretical reflection and storytelling, this essay explores the complexity of this double cultural translation of readers and texts by asking what it might mean to understand, misunderstand or fail to understand a text as it is transmitted between often divergent contexts.\n\nFeng Menglong's early seventeenth-century story collections-Gujin xiaoshuo (later retitled Yushi mingyan), Jingshi tongyan, and Xingshi hengyan-were landmarks in the development of late imperial Chinese fiction. These loose vernacular adaptations of classical-language texts exemplify how Feng was able to re-articulate classic fictional themes and tropes. This essay explores how Feng employed disnarration-that is, narration of counterfactual scenarios-to interrogate themes of causality and morality in the story \"The Fan Tower Restaurant as Witness to the Love of Zhou Shengxian\" (\"Nao fanlou duoqing Zhou Shengxian\") in order to engage with two major late-Ming cultural discourses: the \"childlike heart-mind\" (tongxin) and the so-called \"cult of qing.\"\n\nThe seventeenth-century novel, Xingshi yin yuan zhuan (The Tale of Marriage Destinies that will Bring Society to its Senses), provides rare and fascinating insights into the rhythm of urban and rural life in late imperial China. Like many other writings of the time it depicts China on the verge of modernity, as a world torn between the traditional agricultural society and the new challenges of urban life, commerce and a money economy.1 The shifts from conventional norms and values gave rise to concepts of utopia and anti-utopia; to nostalgia for a lost paradise of the past and to apocalyptic satire on present conditions. In the Tale of Marriage Destinies, the contrast between local society in both city and countryside is linked to the dream of an ideal, utopian world and its satirical inversion — the grotesque nightmare of anti-utopia.2\n\nEditor’s note: Yu and Huters stress the integrated place of writing in Chinese civilization, explaining that the word for writing, wen, also means “culture, civilization, learning, pattern, refinement, and embellishment.” Examining the creation story of Pangu, the authors contrast traditional Chinese aesthetic values to Western aesthetics: Chinese aesthetics reflect a holistic and correlative worldview in which art describes concrete phenomenon, the writer exists in a network of relationships, and literature interprets and resides within the historic tradition.\n\nIn this volume, \"Chinese Literature,\" you will meet great minds among the Chinese literates. Since reading is a form of pleasure that has been enjoyed for thousands of years, literature gives us the opportunity to meet great writers in Chinese history who have distilled their thoughts on life and society. This book will track the development of literature from the pre-Qin Dynasty era to the last monarchal regime, the Qing Dynasty."
