        "text": "Published in Lithub 25 May 2016 Most readers nowadays, asked to name a contemporary Chinese writer, could manage at least one. But the odds are that it will be a man. Yet the near-invisibility of Chinese women writers internationally is entirely undeserved. They flourish on the literary scene at home and have done so since the beginning of the New Culture Movement in the early twentieth century. We are quite proud that this list (drawn up by the Paper-Republic.org collective and friends) ranges so widely. There's something here for everyone, from travel literature to novels and short story collections, from fantasy and sci-fi to meditations on love and loneliness, with plenty of dark humor along the way. We have included works from all over the Chinese-writing world–mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan (and one from USA too).\n\nIn the UK, most literary and translation events take place in London. A few years ago, Frances Weightman and Sarah Dodd, at the University of Leeds, set out to establish Leeds as the centre for new Chinese writing in \" the North \". Leeds is a city about halfway between London and Scotland (the train from London takes just over two hours). Their idea was to open up the world of contemporary Chinese writing and to engage with everyone involved in the process of transforming a great work conceived in Chinese to a great work read in English! They called the project Writing Chinese. It's been so successful, they've just received funding to develop it further! We invited Frances to tell us the story so far… 文坛百家 Writing Chinese As with many of the better things in life, research projects included, Writing Chinese began unexpectedly, the result of a series of fortunate events. At the end of 2013 the Arts and Humanities Research Council advertised a funding opportunity with a rather tight deadline. The White Rose East Asia Centre, a collaboration between the Universities of Leeds and Sheffield, wanted to respond to this so invited members to come up with new projects to form part of the WREAC bid. It so happened that I was coming to the end of a second bout of maternity leave and faced with the sudden realisation that regular travel to China for fieldwork and library research was going to be more of a challenge with two children under two. At the same time, intellectually I was looking to shift the focus of my research on authorial prefaces and traditional fiction from premodern to contemporary China. By happy coincidence, my co-conspirator Sarah Dodd had recently completed her PhD and secured a post here with us in Leeds. Both Sarah and I were trained in classical Chinese fiction, but we both had a keen interest in, and a wish to learn more about, contemporary writing and its English translation.\n\nRepublican China (1912-1949) saw the rise and fall of a sub-field of source culture-initiated foreign language translations of Chinese literature targeted at both expatriate and domestic audiences in China. This unique translation phenomenon, which challenges Gideon Toury’s generally held assumption that “translations are facts of target cultures,” has hitherto been under-researched in and outside of China. This paper presents the findings of a case study of George Kin Leung’s English translation of Lu Xun’s fictional masterpiece A Q Zhengzhuan (The True Story of Ah Q). Four socio-cultural factors which engendered the emergence of this sub-field in the early Republican years are analyzed. Inspired by French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu’s theory of the field of cultural production, this putative sub-field of restricted production is interpreted as functioning primarily on the basis of the accumulation of symbolic capital. Leung’s participation in the dynamics of this historical field is examined by tracing his professional trajectory, followed by an analysis of his motivation for translating A Q Zhengzhuan -- to make a name for himself or to accumulate symbolic capital in the field. It is then found through text analysis that Leung’s version shows a combination of overall literalness and occasional license. A tentative explanation is sought by drawing on André Lefevere’s theory of rewriting. The primary conclusion is that Leung’s literalistic approach to translation was dictated by the intended readership and the translation norm (i.e. literal translation) that prevailed in 1920s’ China, while the liberties Leung took with the original text reveal the influence of his ideology, poetics and aesthetics. Leung’s version is of historical significance, not merely because it is the first English version of A Q Zhengzhuan, but also because with a fairly large circulation it helped earn Lu Xun an early international literary fame. In Republican China, source culture-initiated foreign-language translations of Chinese literature were often produced to accumulate symbolic capital and/or to seek cultural honor in the Chinese socio-political fields.\n\nJia Pingwa would probably be the first to admit that his books make a tough sell for 'global literature': of fourteen novels, all but three (Ruined City/Abandoned Capital, The Plague Report, and Happy Dreams) take place in the rural countryside of Shaanxi—and in those three exceptions, the protagonists are migrants from the same. Clearly then, for Jia, the geographical setting and origin of his stories and characters is crucial. Bounded by the Qin mountains to the south, and the Ordos desert to the north, this arid province formed the heartland of Chinese civilization from the Warring States (500-221 BC) to the Tang (618-907 AD)—a span of almost 1500 years. While the terracotta warriors of Qin Shihuang, the first emperor to unify the various kingdoms of premodern China, are its most famous relics, so much of Shaanxi's natural resources have been lost.\n\nAre classical Chinese and modern Chinese one language, or two? Is translating classical Chinese poetry the same as or different from translating modern Chinese poetry? I have earlier argued that modern Chinese poetry is in some ways a translation of premodern Chinese poetics through the filter of international poetics—but if this is the case, then should translation of classical and modern poetry into English be more similar than they are? Looking at Lydia Liu’s notion of the “supersign” alongside my experiences translating contemporary poets Ouyang Jianghe and Xi Chuan as well as Tang dynasty poet Li Shangyin, I discuss what I call “weak interpretations” and “strong interpretations” and how they play out in the translational alignment of classical and modern Chinese poetry with poetry in English today."
