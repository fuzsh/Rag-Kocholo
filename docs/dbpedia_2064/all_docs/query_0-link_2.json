        "text": "I don’t agree with Lucas Klein on Eric Abrahamsen’s NY Times article. Everyone who cares to read new Chinese literature knows there is stupendous and great stuff produced in many places in China. Eric and many others involved in Pathlight have done a lot to make more of today’s stories and poems from China available in English. The distribution of the printed magazine is still a problem, it seems. But on the whole, Eric has conducted a great boon for us translators and for everyone interested. So Pathlight is great, but that article isn’t. Not at all. Nick Admussen has enumerated many weak spots, I completely agree with him. Especially the point at the end. Eric’s quoted comments, his first post here and the NYT article all create an impression that it is not the state doing does most of the stifling. The state of everything that sometimes pokes through, if you will. The premise behind the current state. It’s not pretty at all, as Kevin Carrico has said. And everyone in China is working with it, everyone involved, including myself.\n\nIf you get flippant about one dissident’s poems, or other belles-lettres, you create false impressions in general. Eric has corrected that with very clear words in his latest post. Woeser’s 唯色 poems are suppressed because she is a dissident. Not because of the poems at all.\n\nFor many years, there have been too many flippant remarks in our field in this regard, by W. Kubin and others.\n\nMy own reaction was emotional. Eric’s politics-poke-through-framework is untenable as a general argument. Lucas and everyone else in the discussion seem to agree on this. And if the critique of the Writer’s Association and the social climate it makes for is the main point of the article, then you have to know that Eric and everyone working for Pathlight, including all of us translators etc, are paid by the Writer’s Association. No matter what kind of reader you are.\n\nLucas does have an interesting point when he finds Nick Admussen’s and Eric Abrahamsen’s points about social roles not necessarily exclusive. I think Nick is right, and Eric isn’t. Is Yi Sha 伊沙 anti-social, because he cultivates his anti-authoritarian stance? Obviously not. Except in his poems, sometimes. He has to work with censorship, but he does not have to belong to the Writer’s Association to be successful. Yes, he is an exception.\n\nEric does make very good points in his reaction to all the criticism he has received. These points, at least one or two of them, should have been in the article. On the whole, China is more authoritarian, draconian etc. than you get to think when you see what is possible in the arts and in other achievements. I think Eric does say something like that in his latest post. Not in the article, unfortunately. And so I don’t think that NY times article is good for us translators at all. Or for the general reader. Except for the attention created. Attention is crucial, and in this way all the hullabaloo about censorship and human rights etc. at any book fair is probably very good for everyone involved. Maybe even book fair chairman Rüdiger Wischenbart privately agrees on this, although he has to say something to the opposite in public. Mr. Wischenbart used to produce great radio programs in Austria. In recent years, he has made himself an expert on book trade.\n\nPathlight and all the book fair scandals of recent years have certainly increased attention paid to Chinese literature. It’s very understandable that Eric is feeling tired from all the generalized and sometimes ill-informed criticism he has seen and felt over the years. But I think all the critique is a good thing, on the whole. It should be addressed like in Eric’s latest post.\n\nMartin Winter <dujuan99@gmail.com>\n\nOn the relationship between cliquish social pressures and state sanctions, Mr. Abrahamsen is trying to have it both ways. “Yes, the government is ultimately behind much of it. But not all of it.” Then, four sentences later, “The government is not the problem, it is an extreme symptom of the problem.” It is curious to hear a symptom of a problem described as lying behind much of the problem. When Mr. Abrahamsen writes that “if the Chinese government were removed tomorrow this [literary] establishment would still be in place, still choking China’s literary production” he raises an interesting question. It is not necessary, of course, to hypothesize the removal of the government, only the relaxation of its sanctions in restraint of speech. I wonder if one could turn up some suggestive data by comparing the tone of literary society shortly before and after 1989. I find Dr. Admussen’s argument persuasive. The state provides the motive force behind social pressures within the guild to avoid sensitive topics. To minimize the state’s role in this process is a fallacy, like that of a visitor to a water-powered mill who concludes that since the millstone is seldom wet, the flow of the river must play little part in the grinding of the grain.\n\nOn the relationship between politics and art, in his most recent post Mr. Abrahamsen strikes a reasonable tone: “All I said was that political art should also be good art.” But that is not all he has said. He said that no one has been imprisoned — or even “molested” or subjected to “a slap on the wrist” — on account of his art. Since a number of writers have been molested, some quite harshly, he recognized that an explanation was in order. The first explanation was that they were punished for their “political activities.” The second was that whatever they wrote has not been, in Mr. Abrahamsen’s judgment, art. As a guideline for understanding this judgment, he offered the “politics poking through” test. This metaphor calls for careful interpretation. I suggested that Mr. Abrahamsen was asking us to consider shallow and merely vehicular works of art, in which politics is the message; but that there are also great works of art with strong and inescapable political themes; and that in principle an authoritarian government which has developed an elaborate machinery of suppression will abhor either kind of work — or a work anywhere along the spectrum of artistic merit — if it threatens to inspire significant resistance or dissent. This raises the question whether any of the works whose authors have been sanctioned do in fact have artistic merit. I understand Mr. Abrahamsen to be answering in the negative. Let me call attention once again to the coincidence that Mr. Abrahamsen finds no artistic merit in those who have suffered the wrath of the state, but much in some who have not. Seeking an explanation that would not be injurious to Mr. Abrahamsen, I wondered if some of the stylistic values which are esteemed among Western critics might also render a work relatively innocuous in the eyes of the regime. This would help explain the coincidence — but it is only speculation.\n\nMr. Abrahamsen is right to regret the predominance of criticism in the responses, for his article made good points about the role of social pressure and the ambiguities with which authors must deal. But he invited that criticism by minimizing the role of the state and dismissing as artless the critical work of independent writers.\n\nCall me overheated. 我是流氓我怕谁.\n\nA. E. Clark <aec@raggedbanner.com>\n\nScott Savitt mentions Bei Dao’s line about wanting to be a man in an age of heroes; I also thought of this line in relation to this discussion, when I read Eric Abrahamsen write that “The Chinese poet-hero does not exist.” The irony being, obviously, that eventually Bei Dao was exiled, and turned into a hero-poet, for writing poems that are not that overtly political. Now, however, he is free to travel in the PRC, for medical purposes but with a guarantee from the Writers’ Association that he will not participate in large gatherings either political or poetic in nature. So some things change, and some stay the same.\n\nMy friend Eric has taken a lot of heat for his comments about censorship and literature in China—some of it rightly so. While at times I’ve also felt that, as he says, “Art falls apart for me the instant that the message (be that political, moral, religious, etc) pokes through the artistic fabric of the piece itself” (though I don’t think I’ve ever put it so elegantly), I don’t in the end find such a separation philosophically tenable.\n\nBut I think we can understand what Eric is saying without suggesting that he’s morally compromised as editor of a journal funded by People’s Literature (for what it’s worth, my experience knowing a few of the editors there is that they’re exactly the ones who are clearest on how censorship works and how nefarious it is; and as someone who’s given them a number of translations, I have both been censored, and had the English-language editorial team save my work from censorship). That is, I think we can look at whom he’s talking to, rather than or alongside where he’s talking from.\n\nIn short, I understand Eric’s NYTimes editorial and his standpoint overall to be directed at readers of literature in English, not specialists on China and its current cultural productions already used to the idea that China is a complex and often contradictory cultural field. We’re an audience that can take Eric’s point that “When you are a Chinese author, being anti-authoritarian means being anti-social” and respond, as Nick Admussen does, that “Cliquishness, manneredness, and extreme care not to offend are … the role of the state!” (I myself find both these points, Eric’s and Nick’s, quite compelling, and not at odds). But as I see it, the audience for Eric’s comments are the people for whom it’s newsworthy to report that China is “Not as Authoritarian as We Thought” (to refer to another recent article we received). The audience, that is, who would be willing to believe that because censorship and political repression exist in China, China must not be able to produce anything of high literary value. I certainly don’t think that’s true, and while I disagree with some of the points Eric makes en route to demonstrating the possibility of literary merit in China, I’m very glad that he’s made such an important argument so visibly.\n\nSo should literature always serve the principles of free speech? Should literature serve the people? Should it only serve its own purposeless purposiveness? I find these propositions to rely on or reflect each other, in at times depressing ways. The more interesting questions come, I think, not in whether they should, but in how they do serve freedom, equality, purposelessness, and so on—to what degree and in what combination. And when it comes down to any individual writer, we’ll all probably disagree. But if we do agree, at least, that there is good literature—however we care to define it—being written in China today, then we should probably appreciate Eric’s argument as a push beyond the simplifications that so often saturate the media. If nothing else, I think a lot of our work depends on it.\n\nLucas Klein <lklein@hku.hk>\n\nOof, I guess I asked for this.\n\nSo, there are *way* too many issues getting confused here. First of all, and most importantly, I need to admit that the rhetorical device in the first paragraph of the NYT piece was cavalier, and crucially did not note the fact that members of China’s ethnic minorities are essentially still operating in a Cultural-Revolution-era political environment, in which plain speech (be it poem or blog post) can very much carry physical consequences. This was sloppy argument, verging on callousness, and I apologize.\n\nAs for the art vs political speech discussion… I don’t know why we’re suddenly talking about Guernica and Les Miserables. Let me back up.\n\nI was originally objecting to a romanticized view of Chinese dissident artists on the part of observers outside of the country, and a concomitant suspicion of any artists *not* targeted by the state, as though they were automatically patsies. I have seen much of this over the years. The article was an attempt to describe the conditions under which most Chinese writers do operate, in which heroism rarely figures, but the spirit of political opposition does exist in certain muted ways.\n\nWhatever I had to say about the quality of the poetry of Liu Xiaobo et al was simply an addendum to this, an attempt to get people away from the seductive but frankly inaccurate concept of the poet-hero. It was a flippant (seven-word) aside in the quote, and not really the point of anything.\n\nI was asked to elaborate on the idea of how art and politics mix, and I did so, outlining what was to me the aesthetic basis for my own judgment of what makes for good political art. How this resulted in A. E. Clarke’s frankly overheated response I do not know. Why would I think that politics doesn’t belong in art? Or that it should only be introduced in a polite or veiled fashion? Why would I be condoning any of the government’s actions or arguments? I am not in a position to condone anything. All I said was that political art should also be good art (for instance, say, Guernica or Les Miserables), and if it can’t be good art, I’d prefer it if the speaker just came out with a pamphlet.\n\n“Good art”?! “You’d prefer”?! Arrogance!\n\nYes. Again, I was asked my opinion (an opinion which was only barely expressed in any public forum), and I gave it.\n\nTo return to the point of the article itself (if I may), it seems that only Nick Admussen actually addressed it. Apparently there was some miscommunication, though, as most of the objections in the latter part of his message work, from my point of view, in support of my argument. I was in no way saying that the government does not exert a chilling effect on artistic production, but that the effect is mixed with many other corrosive influences, and delivered to authors via the medium of their peers. I will allow plenty of exceptions to the general trend, but everything I have seen and heard supports this. I began my conversation with Yan Lianke assuming he had been involved in many direct political clashes. He corrected me: the hardest struggles have been personal ones, within the literary establishment. Yes, the government is ultimately behind much of it. But not all of it. I wrote in the article that if theChinese government were removed tomorrow this establishment would still be in place, still choking China’s literary production. I believe thatcompletely. Yes, it would gradually get better, in some regards, but not in others. The government is not the problem, it is an extreme symptom of the problem. Authoritarianism is a sickness that goes all the way down to the ground. It finds its most naked expression in the political violence that serves the vestiges (and new offshoots) of China’simperial nature (most directly its ethnic minorities), but it is expressed constantly, at all levels of society. The article was an attempt to illustrate that effect from the point of view of Chinese writers.\n\nLastly (I promise), Nick’s question about Pathlight is a good one. I started off the conversation with the NYT editors with this element included, and the piece wavered between the personal and the impersonal, eventually arriving in its present form mostly out of exhaustion on all sides.\n\nI do get paid for producing Pathlight, in conjunction with People’s Literature Magazine, the funding coming from the Writers Association. It would have been good to note that in the article, but I don’t know how I would have done that without making it the focus of the article. Someday I’ll write about the experience, but not yet. There’s plenty more to say here, but this has already gone on too long, and I’m tired.\n\nLastly (oops), let me thank the list for the civil tone of discussion. It was one of the gentlest dogpiles I’ve ever had the pleasure of being at the bottom of.\n\nYours,\n\nEric Abrahamsen <eric@ericabrahamsen.net>\n\nOne incident that springs to mind in this fascinating discussion occurred when I was working in the China Daily office in 1990-92 developing an index for the newspaper. I was privileged to associate with and accompany many of the journalists who were working on the newspaper at the time and one thing that sticks in my mind is how those working on the entertainment pages were beating themselves over the head pondering why China was unable to produce good pop/rock music when Taiwan and Hong Kong (who were then top of the pops, so to speak) were so eminently able, and I do remember wondering at the time why it did not occur to them that perhaps some of the forces at the time that were confining Cui Jian to playing only to the diplomatic crowd in Sanlitun might not have something to do with it? A similar feeling came over me in my discussions with a prominent “dissident” (but I would rather term him more near mainstream Marxist and someone I felt more aligned to) theoretician who could not bring himself to consider the fact that perhaps China was not socialist at that stage (nor any stage yet, for that matter) and so some of the theoretical conundrums in circulation at the time (“socialism with Chinese characteristics” being only one of them) might just be built on a false premise.\n\nDarrell Dorrington <Darrell.Dorrington@anu.edu.au>\n\nHi, colleagues.\n\nI’d like to carry forward the conversation of the last few days by registering deep disappointment with Eric Abrahamsen’s 6/17 editorial in the New York Times. The core of my problem is factual; as I’m sure many of you know, the Sichuan poet Liao Yiwu was detained and eventually given a four-year sentence for writing the poems 《黃城》, 《偶像》 , and especially 《大屠殺》, about the Tiananmen Massacre. This last was self-evidently unpublishable—for fear of the government censors who still hold sway—so he recorded an audiotape of the poem, and circulated that, which earned him a four-year jail sentence. His account of the abuse he endured during that prison sentence is well worth reading and has been translated as For a Song and a Hundred Songs. Liao is not the only poet silenced directly or indirectly by formal state punishment: poet Li Bifeng’s 12-year sentence was reported on by the NYT on Nov. 20, 2012 (page A6). Nurmuhemmet Yasin, a Uyghur poet and short story writer, hasn’t been seen for several years, and may well have died in jail. Eric is certainly welcome to say that he doesn’t like the work of these people, but he can’t pretend like they don’t exist. Because these are people who suffer greatly, his factual error is also a moral fault.\n\nI also have a series of questions about the piece that center on Eric’s role as the editorial director of Pathlight magazine, which is funded, overseen and published by People’s Literature 《人民文学》, a magazine founded in 1949 and still bearing Mao Zedong’s calligraphy on the cover. This means — and correct me if I’m wrong, because these things are very rarely transparent — that Eric is much more a part of the structure he’s describing than the average translator. It may very well be that he isn’t paid by the magazine, or that his work has no impact on his opinions, but I’m curious whether his position would be retained if he had argued, for example, that state censorship is throttling contemporary Chinese literature. I read and respect Pathlight, would gladly translate for it, and am glad it exists — but it’s not an ideologically neutral space, and its level of distinction from the rest of the official Chinese literary apparatus is a worthwhile matter for discussion. It also feels like something that’s appropriate to disclose in a public forum like the NYT — would those readers have been surprised by this information?\n\nOn a theoretical level, I was truly surprised at the thinness of the ideas Eric had to share, especially considering the richness of his experience. One does not have to imprison, kill, or exile very many members of a profession before its values change: self-censorship in the Chinese case is very obviously a direct product of state censorship. Cliquishness, manneredness, and extreme care not to offend are all self-defensive mechanisms pursued by writers who do not want to die in jail or be expelled abroad. A system in which rules are arbitrary, ever-changing, and offensive breeds corruption and cronyism, as those willing to rise in the system are the ones who are most attached to the sinecure and the banquet table. Perhaps his focus on large-market literary fiction in the Beijing scene has blinded him to the immense amount of heterogeneity and foment that never makes it even close to print, the way that freethinking Internet literature is subject to deletion, or the voices of pain and doubt that only find their way into the literary fiction market in a weakened, watered-down, inoffensive way.\n\nChina is certainly not the Soviet case: it’s often worse. The “hero poets” who survive their education rarely get the chance to have any career to speak of; the fact that Eric doesn’t seem to know anything about Sichuan avant-garde poetry (similar to, but distinct from, the Han Dong group he cites) or similar scenes in other provinces reinforces how difficult it is for these poets to resist enforced invisibility. I say all this with a reasonable amount of respect for Eric, Paper Republic, and the authors he promotes. He and I are the same age, and I’ve benefited from his generosity more than once. I believe him when he says that cliquishness is to be avoided, though, so I can’t let the piece sit, because it’s weak.\n\nI love Yan Lianke’s Dream of Ding Village and I teach it and the students really react to it — Yan really is a truly great writer — but every time he speaks on the novel, he talks about the way in which the version we have is a crippled part of the original book he wrote. He didn’t cut that book because he’s too social or afraid to step on toes. The difference between the two is the role of the state! It’s the state, Eric. You just can’t tell because they haven’t come for you, yet.\n\nNick Admussen <nadmusse@yahoo.com>"
