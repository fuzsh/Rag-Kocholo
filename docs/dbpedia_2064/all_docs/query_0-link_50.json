This year he will be teaching our regular Hebrew Bible class as well as courses in his area of expertise, on the co- construction of Humans and Animals in the Hebrew Bible, on The Environment, the Bible and Moral Debate, which looks at how scripture is brought into environmental arguments, and on how religion is represented in popular culture through Dungeons and Dragons.\n\nHenry Washington Jr., assistant professor of feminist, gender, and sexuality studies, is an interdisciplinary scholar of race, gender, and aesthetics in the post- slavery United States. He recently received his Ph.D. from the Program in Modern Thought & Literature at Stanford University, where he also earned Ph.D. minors in Feminist, Gender & Sexuality Studies and Theater & Performance Studies. He is at work on his first book project, Enfleshing the Criminal: Producing and Policing Black Sexual Difference in the Criminological Imagination, 1871-1960 which scrutinizes the truth claims that undergirded the postbellum emergence of the “criminal” in both the science of criminality and the practice of policing. More specifically, it examines how visual-cultural consensus about the black female body’s supposedly inherent difference enabled the trajectory of criminological “empiricism,” satisfying particular postbellum political needs by reinvigorating the logics of antebellum anti-blackness with positivist rationale. The project simultaneously attends to how black artists in the period expressively experimented with the supposedly “objective” terms on which racialized gender subsequently appeared in the law and in the social world. Henry also has published writing on the work black mothers have done since slavery to problematize the pathologization and erasure of black youth murdered by the state, and work forthcoming on the alternative historiographic method modeled by the black trans stars of Ryan Murphy’s Pose.
