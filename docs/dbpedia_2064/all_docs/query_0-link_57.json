Considering this, the present research objective is to examine the factors influencing employee eco-friendly behavior (EEBH) and firm environmental performance (FEP). Cross-sectional data were accumulated from 403 employees working in casual dining restaurants in China and analyzed through partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS–SEM) approaches (i.e., PLS algorithm, bootstrapping, blindfolding, and PLS prediction). The findings support the significant effect of environmental concern (ENVC) on employee organizational commitment (EOC), employee job satisfaction (EJoS), and EEBH. In addition, EOC and EJoS directly and indirectly influence EEBH. Furthermore, EOC also mediates the link between ENVC and EJoS. Finally, the findings also show that EEBH stimulates environmental performance. By showing the links between these elements, it has been emphasized that EEBH is a precondition of good organizational productivity and how it contributes to enhancing the EJoS and overall firm’s health. It challenges managers to create a work environment that is conducive to sustainability for improved customer relations and a strong reputation for the organization in society.

The shortage of funds for new construction, combined with rapidly changing economic, social, and technological factors, has led to significant obsolescence. Additionally, this situation makes it difficult to satisfy the owners’ energy, functional, and socio-economic needs. This research aims to develop an innovative retrofit approach that brings multiple benefits to assessing retrofit designs for social housing, with specific emphasis on volumetric envelope additions toward the nearly zero energy buildings target (nZEBs). To achieve the purpose of this study, the research through design methodology was chosen. The research methodology consisted of two phases: design and simulation. First, the design phase focused on re-designing and retrofitting social housing to address various aspects of the functional requirements in developing rational solutions. Second, the simulation phase focused on computational modeling and analysis of energy performance to assess the nZEBs target. The results show that the use of high-efficiency Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems and improved material envelopes cut electricity consumption use by 43% and primary energy use by 40% compared to the base case. Photovoltaics (PV) production can meet the total electricity demand for six months. This approach can encourage residents and tenants to actively participate in the retrofit process and increase the real estate value of buildings through improvements in energy efficiency and housing function.

Nonetheless, electroplating is considered one of the most non-sustainable industries related to the manufacturing sector, from both an environmental and a social point of view. With the approaching deadlines set by the United Nations for the 2030 Agenda, electroplating companies have started a trend of innovating their production processes with a focus on sustainability, acting on several fronts: performing simulations to predict criticalities and optimize working procedures, reducing the material used and recovering it from processing water. The purpose of this communication is to highlight the state of the art of sustainable practices peculiar to the electroplating industry, critically analyzing ongoing challenges to achieve and exceed the targets set by regulatory agencies. Both atomistic and multiphysics simulations will be analyzed as powerful tools to design both new sustainable formulations and items; then, the problem of metal dispersion will be discussed, evaluating different industrial approaches; finally, the focus will be shifted towards the general procedures to recover metal from wastewater.

In 2019, the UK became the first major economy to pass laws to end its contribution to the world’s greenhouse gas emissions; parliament passed legislation requiring the UK government to achieve its carbon neutrality commitment by 2050. This will require all industries, including the housing sector, which currently contributes around 14% of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions, to reduce their carbon emission contribution. One of the ways in which the housing sector plans to accomplish this is through delivering new zero carbon ready homes by 2050, at the latest. This study makes an innovative contribution to advancing the field of carbon neutral construction through its identification of the barriers to the UK in regards to their ability to deliver zero carbon homes (ZCH) and the provision of potential recommendations to overcome these barriers. To achieve this, a mixed-review method is used, combining a qualitative systematic analysis and a quantitative bibliometric approach. Several key barriers were identified and assigned to following key themes: legislative, socio-cultural, economic, financial, skills and knowledge, technical, industrial, environmental, and procurement factors. Legislative obstacles were found to be a primary barrier due to a lack of certainty, clarity, and clear definitions, as well as the removal and excess of government policies. Significantly, the findings reveal the under-researched impact of recent disruptive events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, Brexit, and economic factors in the UK, opening up novel avenues for exploring their implications. Overall, this study advances industry understanding and highlights innovative directions necessary to propel the sector towards realizing the UK’s legally-binding 2050 net zero target through the development of zero carbon ready homes.

This is fulfilled with the development of a new GIS-supported extension of a comprehensive methodology that is currently used for appraising local transport interventions. To illustrate the inputs and outputs of the expanded approach, a regional case study was simulated, highlighting the potential for this methodology to assist in (1) optimising the financial balance between electrification and modal-shift strategies, (2) anticipating and analysing the multiple economic impacts of multimodal transport services (e.g., Mobility as a Service) and (3) understanding how equal the benefits of these policies are across the region. This research will provide novel contributions to the field of transport research and policy development by introducing a comprehensive methodology that quantifies and maps the distributed economic impacts of regional transport policies. This will, consequently, enable the economic outputs of these policies to be easily visualised, analysed and shared with mobility stakeholders, fostering a better understanding of their urban–rural distribution, and promoting the strategic development of sustainable and equitable regional transport systems.

In contrast, virtual fashion clothes are attracting attention from consumers and academics for their notable sustainability benefits and potential for fashion innovation. However, research on consumer acceptance of virtual clothes and the role of sustainability remains limited. This study aims to fill this gap by applying the Emotional Three-Level Theory to identify key virtual fashion attributes, including aesthetic, reality, personalization, presentation, sustainability, and inclusivity features, and evaluating their impact on acceptance using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). A survey of 503 Generation Z consumers in China, analyzed through structural equation modeling, reveals that perceived enjoyment, usefulness, and ease of use significantly influence the intention to adopt virtual fashion clothes. Aesthetic and realistic features enhance enjoyment, while personalization and presentation improve usefulness and ease of use. Sustainability features positively impact all three factors, promoting consumer acceptance. These findings offer theoretical insights for virtual fashion research and practical guidance for the fashion industry to leverage virtual technologies for environmental sustainability. Notably, the study emphasizes the potential of virtual clothes in promoting sustainable development in the fashion industry.

However, does it no longer pose potential threats to sustainability? In the context of the low-carbon transition, this study reveals hidden worries about the sustainability of the 3E system from an energy equity perspective, specifically focusing on the coordination between carbon decoupling and energy equity. This study innovatively calculates the level of carbon decoupling and energy equity in China’s Yangtze River Economic Belt from 2008 to 2019 and explores the degree of coordinated development between carbon decoupling and energy equity by employing the coupling coordination model and bivariate local Moran index. The results show the following: (1) from 2008 to 2019, the energy equity in the Yangtze River Economic Belt showed steady improvement, but the overall level was still not high, being below 0.5; (2) the upstream and downstream regions showed more obvious resistance in maintaining the coordinated development of carbon decoupling and energy equity, but there are structural differences among them; (3) inter-basin differences were an important feature of the low-carbon economy and equitable energy development in the Yangtze River Economic Belt in the past. This study provides policy implications and research insights for promoting the sustainability of the 3E system in transition countries from an energy equity perspective.

This research examined the spatial–temporal disparities in ecosystem services and human well-being across 87 counties in Gansu Province using the coupling coordination degree model and geographically weighted regression analysis. The key findings include the following: (1) Over two decades, from 2000 to 2020, ecosystem services in Gansu Province witnessed a financial appreciation of approximately CNY 29.32 billion. The distribution displayed a notable trend, with higher values in the southeastern counties, particularly in Gannan and Longnan, whereas lower values prevailed in the Hexi area. (2) The well-being of the populace experienced a substantial enhancement, registering a 75% increase during the same period, characterized by higher well-being indices in the north, especially in Hexi, and the lowest indices in Gannan and the Linxia sector of Longzhong. (3) The coupling coordination degree between ecosystem services and human well-being escalated from 0.412 to 0.587, transitioning from moderate dysfunction to moderate coordination over the two decades. Regions such as Hexi and Gannan recorded a moderate discordance in their coupling coordination, whereas regions including Longzhong, Longnan, and Longdong demonstrated a more stable, basic coordination. (4) Influences on the coupling coordination degree between county ecosystem services and human well-being displayed significant spatial variability, often aligned along distinct geographic bands. Economic and natural foundations were predominantly aligned southeast to northwest, while investment and urbanization levels were more prominent from west to east, and industrialization levels were distributed along an east–west axis.

A mathematical model that allows the calculation of nitrogen oxide emissions from such combustion was built; this model uses the extended chemical kinetic mechanism of Zeldovich. Numerical simulations were carried out on the production of NO, varying the following variables: proportion of H2 to CH4, the equivalence ratio of the reactant mixture, the compression ratio, and the engine speed. The essential purpose was to assess how NO production is affected by the mentioned variables. The main assumptions were (i) Otto cycle; (ii) instantaneous combustion; (iii) chemical equilibrium reached just at the end of combustion; (iv) the formation of NO only during the expansion stroke of pistons. Results were obtained for various proportions of hydrogen and methane, various equivalence ratios, speeds of rotation, and compression ratios of an engine. In short, the results obtained in the current work show that the lowering of the equivalence ratio leads to a lower concentration of NO; that increasing the compression ratio also lowers the concentration of NO; that NO production occurs until shortly after the beginning of the expansion stroke; and finally, that the NO concentration in the engine exhaust is not very sensitive to the H2/CH4 ratio in the fuel mixture.

Many societal developments and discussions can influence the poverty level of disabled people. This study aimed to better understand the academic engagement with the poverty of disabled people in general and in Canada. To fulfill this aim, we performed a scoping review of academic abstracts obtained from SCOPUS, the 70 databases of EBSCO-HOST, and Web of Science. We performed a frequency count and a content analysis of abstracts containing the terms “poverty” or “impoverish*” or “socioeconomic” or “SES” or “income”. We ascertained how the abstracts engaged with the poverty of disabled people in general and in Canada and in conjunction with keywords linked to a select set of societal developments and discussions we saw as impacting poverty and being impacted by poverty. We also looked at the use of concepts coined to discuss ability judgments and social problems with being occupied, two areas that impact the poverty of disabled people. We found that disabled people were mentioned in 0.86% of the abstracts using the term “poverty” in general and 4.1% (88 abstracts) for Canada. For the terms “impoverish*”, “socioeconomic”, “SES”, and “income”, the numbers were 3.15% in general and 0.94% for Canada. The poverty of disabled people who also belong to other marginalized groups was rarely covered. Our qualitative content analysis revealed that many of the hit-count positive abstracts did not cover the poverty of disabled people. We found 22 relevant abstracts that covered the poverty of disabled people in conjunction with technologies, eight in conjunction with accessibility not already mentioned under technology, eight with intersectionality, seven with “activis*” or advocacy, three with sustainability, two with climate change, and none for burnout or ally. The occupation and ability judgment-focused concepts were rarely or not at all employed to discuss the poverty of disabled people. Our findings suggest many gaps in the coverage of the poverty of disabled people that need to be fixed.

However, the mechanisms underlying the influence of various biochar dosages on soil N2O emissions and the duration of one-time biochar application remain unclear. The effects of different biochar application rates and a one-time application on soil N2O emissions in the Huanghuaihai Plain of China were investigated through a field experiment from 2020 to 2022. In the wheat and maize rotation system, six treatments were administered: no biochar (C0); 2 (C1), 4 (C2), 8 (C3), and 12 t/hm2 biochar (C4) applied annually; and a one-time application of 12 t/hm2 biochar (CS) in 2018. Our results indicate that, compared with C0, biochar significantly inhibited soil N2O emissions, particularly in the C3 and C4 treatments, with reductions of 31.36–56.21% and 36.92–52.45%, respectively. However, CS did not significantly affect soil N2O emissions during the study period. These findings suggest that the biochar’s inhibitory effect on soil N2O emissions is contingent upon the dosage and frequency of application. A structural equation model revealed that biochar decreases soil N2O emissions by enhancing the reduction in N2O during denitrification. Under the conditions of this experiment, based on a logistic ecological model, a one-time application of 12 t/hm2 biochar was projected to significantly reduce soil N2O emissions for approximately 1.77 years. On the whole, biochar reduces soil N2O emissions mainly by regulating N2O production through denitrification, and the duration of this inhibition of N2O emissions mainly depends on the application amount and frequency of biochar application.

One term that is often mentioned in the literature is low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) capability, which is crucial to the stability of microgrids (MGs). To handle LVRT, advanced protection schemes or supporting devices are required. In addition, MGs must comply with the operational limits imposed by different countries for LVRT. Therefore, numerous solutions for improving LVRT have been proposed, including external approaches that are expensive to adopt and internal procedures that provide economic gains but are more difficult to apply. Consequently, to help lower the cost of installing WFs, the study investigates how fault characteristics affect MGs’ ability to meet grid LVRT code requirements or even choose the right code to be used. It also aims to give a clear understanding of how fault characteristics affect the grid’s behavior during different types of faults, which will be helpful in choosing the best LVRT-enhancing method or device and for determining the optimal ratings for these devices, and thus reduce the cost of installation. The study offers case studies and simulations using Matlab 2024/Simulink, which could help engineers to ensure reliable grid integration of renewable energy sources in a cost-effective manner.

This paper takes Jiangxi, a less developed demonstration zone in central China, as an example. It pioneeringly combines the LMDI method, Tapio decoupling model, and LEAP model to multi-dimensionally analyze the driving mechanisms, evolution patterns, and dynamic relationships with the economic development of carbon emissions in Jiangxi’s key sectors from 2007 to 2021. It also explores the future carbon emission trends and peaking potentials of various sectors under different scenarios. Our results show that (1) Carbon emissions in various sectors in Jiangxi have continued to grow over the past fifteen years, and although some sectors have seen a slowdown in emission growth, most still rely on traditional fossil fuels; (2) Economic growth and industrial structure effects are the main drivers of carbon emission increases, with a general trend towards decoupling achieved across sectors, while agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and fishery, and ferrous metal smelting have shown a decline in their decoupling status; (3) In the carbon reduction and low-carbon scenarios, the carbon emission peaks in Jiangxi are estimated to be 227.5 Mt and 216.4 Mt, respectively, and targeted strategies for high-emission industries will facilitate a phased peak across sectors and enhance emissions reduction benefits. This has significant reference value for the central region and even globally in formulating differentiated, phased, sector-specific carbon peaking plans, and exploring pathways for high-quality economic development in tandem with ecological civilization construction.

The global warming effect resulting from environmental pollution caused by energy has brought energy carbon emissions into the forefront of social attention. Establishing a carbon trading market is an essential measure to achieve the “double carbon” goal, with individual and household carbon emissions accounting for 70% of China’s total emissions. Constructing an individual-level carbon trading market will facilitate the efficient realization of this goal. However, addressing the challenge of handling vast amounts of data and network congestion in relation to frequent but small-scale individual carbon trading has become an urgent issue that needs to be resolved. In light of this, the present study designs a digital technology-based framework for the carbon market trading system and proposes an individual carbon asset price-based model for carbon market trading, aiming to establish a research framework for the carbon quota market. Furthermore, blockchain technology is employed as the underlying technology in the proposed carbon trading market model to cater to individual-level carbon trading services and achieve optimal matching between carbon quota suppliers, thereby enhancing profitability of the carbon trading platform. The numerical results obtained from the model demonstrate that in absence of government subsidy mechanisms, individual-level carbon trading can effectively reduce total consumer emissions. The present study successfully overcomes the carbon lock-in effect of consumer groups and achieves the generation and trading of individual carbon assets despite capital constraints. This study facilitates accumulation and trade of individual carbon resources, reduces overall consumer emissions, enhances environmental benefits at societal level, and provides a foundation for governmental decision-making.

Utilizing the GEE platform, RSEI was computed by us for Wuhan from 1990 to 2020. Employing geodetector tools and the PLS-SEM approach, driving factors for ecological environment quality in Wuhan were discussed. The overall trend of ecological environment quality in Wuhan was to decline at first and then rise from 1990 to 2020 spatial aggregation characteristics of RSEI were significant; moreover, land use, location, population density, and GDP were included as the main influence factors causing spatial differentiation of RSEI; each influence factor’s effect was also different. Over the past three decades, a fluctuating decline has been exhibited by ecological environment quality in Wuhan. Central urban areas have poor ecological environment quality, while southern and northern distant urban zones have superior ecological environment quality. Clustering is shown to be significant spatially by both. The main influencers of ecological quality in Wuhan are human geographic factors, while natural geographic factors have comparatively minor impacts.

A stochastic optimization model for ADNs is proposed to maximize the benefits of SOPs while simultaneously minimizing system power losses, SOP power losses, voltage deviations, PV power curtailment, battery energy storage system (BESS) operation cost, and utility power purchase. Uncertainties in PV generation and load demand are considered by Monte Carlo simulation and k-means technologies. Finally, simulation cases from a 21-bus distribution network show that the curtailment of PV sources is minimized and the power fluctuations of the BESS are reduced in comparison to the case without SOP. Constraints in the nodal voltages, power outputs, energy balance, and power flow are all satisfied.

The main research problem is to examine the differences in the technical complexity of agri-food exports (EXPY) between EU Member States. Through detailed analysis of product categories and Member States’ performance, we have identified significant differences in the technical complexity of exports. Products such as dairy, meat, cereal and vegetable preparations were associated with high technical complexity, while fruit, tobacco and oils were classified in the low technical complexity category. We also identified Member States with exports characterised by high technical complexity, including Cyprus, Ireland and Luxembourg, and those with low technical complexity, such as Slovakia, Latvia and Croatia. These findings suggest the influence of various factors, such as economic specialisation, natural resources and R&D investment on shaping the agri-food export landscape in the European Union. In-depth analysis of these issues provides significant insights for understanding the economic and technical dynamics in the European agri-food sector.

This study explores the impact of BCT adoption on sustainability within the Australian agriculture sector. Through a systematic literature review (SLR) of studies published between 2015 and 2021, ten key themes influencing BCT adoption were identified: transparency, traceability, contract exchange, transaction efficiency, trade finance management, quality control, real-time information dissemination, security, trust, and legislative frameworks. The findings suggest that BCT adoption in agriculture can lead to improved sustainability outcomes. By enhancing transparency and traceability, BCT enables stakeholders to track the provenance of products, reducing the risk of fraud and ensuring compliance with environmental standards. The automation and efficiency gains afforded by BCT streamline supply chain processes, reducing waste and resource consumption. BCT enhances trust among stakeholders, fostering collaboration and information sharing to address sustainability challenges. This study contributes to the literature by highlighting how BCT can drive sustainability in agriculture through improved transparency, efficiency, and collaboration.

This paper, based on detailed data from listed corporations in China between 2010 and 2020, discovers that the introduction of green technology innovation by corporations has a substantial positive impact on employment levels. The effects of green technology innovation on employment are both persistent and heterogeneous; they persist even two years later, with more significant effects observed in non-heavy-polluting industries, state-owned enterprises, and highly educated employees. This article also carries several policy implications. The findings presented in this paper provide useful insights into the potential employment consequences of the green transition as well as the reactions and adjustment behaviors that corporations exhibit in the low-carbon transition. Additionally, this development holds significant implications for other developing nations grappling with the challenges of switching to environmentally sustainable practices.

This is crucial in fostering a Nature Positive society. Social media approaches have the potential to engage not only nature lovers but also a wider range of citizens, including those indifferent to nature. However, current understanding of the traits of individuals who contribute to widely prevalent social media platforms is limited and insufficient. This study focuses on individuals who contribute to a forest recreational area and the photos they share on a popular social media platform; it sheds light on the untapped potential of social media as a source of citizen science data and contributor sources. We developed a taxonomy of 22 classifications for 1066 photographs that illustrate human–ecosystem interactions and identified the relationship between these subjects and the history of social media activities of the 136 photo contributors. Our findings indicate that different behavioral styles exist among different types of visitors regarding their posting behavior and associated forest recreation types. This can encourage future contributions to the recruitment of citizen scientists and the collection of biodiversity information at small spatial scales.

Development-oriented aid aims to enable economically disadvantaged students to acquire long-term and sustainable self-development capacity. However, to what extent and how development-oriented aid promotes student development remains unclear. Identification of the related mechanism can help both students and educators effectively apply development-oriented aid in higher education scenarios. The main objective of this study was to uncover the effect of size, pathways, and mediating factors of development-oriented aid on student development in higher education. Drawing from a sample of 1792 sponsored students at University G in China and applying the structural equation modeling method for quantitative analysis, the results indicate that development-oriented aid directly shows positive influences toward student development and indirectly impacts student development through psychological capital. These results also show that development-oriented aid directly impacts Han Chinese students’ development more than the development of ethnic minority students. The pathways through which development-oriented aid positively influences Han Chinese students and ethnic minority students vary.

This paper empirically investigates the impact of regional carbon emission reductions on the ESG performance of local enterprises from 2009 to 2021 using provincial carbon emission data from China. The findings indicate that regional carbon emission reductions significantly enhance the ESG performance of local firms. The underlying mechanism is that regional carbon emission reductions facilitate local enterprises obtaining green credit, attracting media coverage and green investors and thus improving ESG performance. Second, heterogeneity tests reveal that regional carbon emission reductions enhance the ESG performance of local firms more significantly in regions with stricter environmental regulations, within heavily polluted industries, and among less digitized enterprises. Finally, further analysis demonstrates that regional residents’ carbon emission reductions can enhance the ESG performance of local enterprises, with regional carbon emission reductions exerting a dual effect after improving ESG performance. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the low-carbon development of various economic entities and the collaborative promotion of economic green transformation.

Today, water scarcity is the biggest challenge in the world, and the crises arising from lack of freshwater resources are serious threats to sustainable environmental development and human health and welfare. As the problems grow in complexity and dimensions, it becomes less possible to solve them with conventional optimization methods or explicit computational methods in a proper amount of time and with the currently limited computation memory, making it very difficult to achieve an optimal absolute solution. In this regard, metaheuristic algorithms that are generally inspired by nature are used in complex optimization problems. The Pishin Dam is an important dam in the eastern basin of Iran in the south of Sistan and Baluchestan province. This region faces severe water stress due to very low precipitation and very high evaporation on the one hand and the growing increase in urban, agricultural, and industrial demand on the other hand. The water development plans executed by the Ministry of Energy in the studied region influence water supply and demand profoundly. This research investigated the optimal allocation of water resources of this dam under management scenarios using the metaheuristic technique of the ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO). The results showed that the best value of the objective function was 82.3658 million m3. When applying the scenario of developing the cultivation area, the best value was obtained at 67.1258, which was significantly different from the base state. The results show that the ACO algorithm is suitable for the water resources of the Pishin Dam and can be used in planning and policymaking.

In the electrical industry, transformers are becoming increasingly important to increase energy efficiency and reduce environmental impact. In the process from the production to the use of transformers, various strategies and technologies are adopted to reduce the carbon footprint. To achieve decarbonization targets and a future with sustainable energy, ongoing efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of transformers need to continue. Therefore, this study aims to calculate the carbon footprint (CF) of Beta Energy in the Adana Province of Türkiye. A comprehensive inventory is being created to determine and monitor the greenhouse gas emissions of Beta Energy, a transformer manufacturer. This inventory includes direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions from all of the company’s activities. The findings show that in 2023, the total CF of Beta Energy is equal to 1,799,482.72 tons of CO2-eq and considering the total of 6044 transformers sold in 2023, results in 297 tons of CO2-eq/transformer per product. The results show that the transformer manufacturing industry has a high carbon footprint because it is an energy-intensive process. The areas where the most carbon emissions occur in transformer production are revealed by CF hot spot analysis in this study. To minimize both current and future greenhouse gas emissions during transformer production, the measures to be taken during the R&D, production, transportation, and service stages are revealed. This study aims to establish a foundation for Beta Energy’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by managing them effectively.

This has led to the inevitable need to track and assess these efforts. This review is centered on the meticulous collection and analysis of pertinent papers within the context of HEIs, subsequently organizing and consolidating them into distinct sustainability domains by utilizing the PRISMA methodology. A collection of 83 pre-existing articles and publications retrieved from the Scopus database is employed for an in-depth exploration of the current research. This study employs both bibliometric and content analyses to explore distribution and citation dynamics and identifies six primary thematic concentrations within the field. The key findings highlight a significant increase in the importance of sustainability, emphasizing the critical need for HEIs to integrate SDGs across all departments. Additionally, the development of cross-institutional evaluation tools tailored to various sustainability aspects is underscored. These tools elucidate key competencies and broaden the application of educational sustainability in both research and curriculum development. The study also identifies a need for future research to explore how effectively these assessment methodologies drive tangible sustainability outcomes within HEIs.

A GIS plot of land use evolution is summarized in a quantitative table. The comparison shows the changes in land use, with increasing occupation by human economic activities, including extensive agriculture and forestry, as well as localized urbanization and industrialization. The main elements of the landscape impacted by anthropogenic uses were (i) hydrography—river dams affected the flow dynamics and sedimentary processes in the estuary; (ii) vegetation—increasing agriculture and forestry reduced the area of native vegetation, which is now mostly occupied by vineyards, pine forests and cork oaks; (iii) wetlands—tidal and alluvial plains are being occupied by rice cultivation, aquaculture, industries, and ports; (iv) coastal dunes—new developments are occupying large areas of Holocene coastal dunes; and (v) natural environment—mining and dredging have affected some habitats and biodiversity. This analysis is intended to help the territorial organization of present and future economic activities, as well as to reduce environmental and social problems, thus promoting the long-term sustainability of this rapidly evolving region.

This research paper employs the Likert scale method to construct a questionnaire encompassing internal and external factors that influence green consumption behavior, as well as various types of consumption behavior. It then administers the questionnaire to 1004 rural residents residing in the eastern, central, western, and northeastern regions of China, with the objective of gathering pertinent data on green consumption behavior. Drawing from the aforementioned, structural equation modeling was employed to investigate the impact of three external factors—market incentives, social pressure, and information boost—and two internal factors—environmental awareness and psychological factors—on diverse forms of green consumption behavior. The objective was to identify the most influential factors of various green consumption behaviors to facilitate the effective promotion of green consumption. The research findings indicate that internal factors exert a more substantial influence on green consumption behaviors compared to external factors. Specifically, market incentives ranks highest among the external determinants of green consumption behavior, and environmental protection cognition rank highest among the internal determinants of green consumption behavior.

With the inclusion of SRPs, PSF-SRP membranes showed different characteristics when compared to the PSF membrane. AAc caused fibers to occur in the surface structure, increasing the MWCO of the PSF membrane, whereas NIPA and SPEES diminished the MWCO, resulting in ultrafiltration and nanofiltration membranes. Furthermore, NIPA and SPEES provided high mechanical and thermal resistance when incorporated into the PSF membrane. The performance of the membranes also showed important changes. In comparison with only PSF, PSF-SPEES and PSF-NIPA increased the water flux and salt rejection percentage by 20–30%. In addition, the highest membrane fouling resistance was observed with PSF-NIPA, while PSF-AAc and PSF-NIPA-AAc presented the lowest resistances. Therefore, PSF-NIPA and PSF-SPEES resulted in membrane improvement, including stimuli-responsive properties, allowing for effective saline effluent treatment.

Urban high-density blocks have concentrated energy consumption, high energy intensity, and complex morphological layout, but the influencing mechanism of the block’s morphology on its energy consumption remains unclear. Accordingly, this study focuses on the mechanism and evaluation method of the influence of morphology on the energy consumption of high-density commercial blocks in severe cold regions. Through Grasshopper model extraction, EnergyPlus performance simulation, Pearson correlation analysis, and linear regression analysis, this study extracts and classifies high-density commercial blocks in Harbin, China, into six basic layout types (Courtyard, Courtyard-T, Slab, Slab-T, Point, Point-T) according to their horizontal and vertical morphology, analyzes the energy consumption characteristics of each basic type, examines the relationships between energy use intensity (EUI) and building density (BD) and between floor area ratio (FAR) and building height standard deviation (BHSD), and constructs theoretical models by controlling variables to study the effect of a single form parameter on block EUI. The research findings are as follows: (1) The annual energy consumption of Point and Slab blocks is relatively low, whereas that of Courtyard and Courtyard-T blocks is higher due to the lack of open space in Courtyards and the poor ventilation in summer. (2) FAR is significantly correlated with the energy consumption of high-density commercial blocks in severe cold regions, while the effects of BD and BHSD are weaker than those of FAR. For every 0.1 increase in BD, every 1 increase in FAR, and every 1(m) increase in BHSD, the Winter Daily EUI of the Slab block changes by +0.87, −2.26, and −0.22 (kWh/m2), respectively, whereas that of the Slab-T block changes by −0.38, +0.68, and +0.08 (kWh/m2), respectively. (3) Controlling other variables, a large BD is theoretically beneficial to energy performance in the blocks, and increasing BD in the range of 0.4–0.55 has a significant effect on lowering energy consumption in Point blocks. EUI increases with the increase in FAR, while the change depends on different block types with the increase in BHSD. This study provides design strategies for high-density commercial blocks in severe cold regions. Under different layout types, though EUI shows different relationships with BD, FAR, and BHSD, Slab-T and Point-T blocks can achieve excellent energy performance by appropriately increasing BD and decreasing FAR, whereas Slab blocks need to decrease BD while increasing FAR. The patterns found in this paper can provide strategic help for policymaking and early urban design. Full article\n\n(This article belongs to the Section Green Building)\n\n►▼ Show Figures"
