        "text": "A proper Zettelkasten should be like a second mind, almost a person on its own. I am not there, yet. My buddy, the Zettelkasten, surprises me a lot but he needs to be filled with a couple thousand more Zettels.\n\nThat doesn’t prevent me from giving you a small biography.\n\nThe Childhood of its Father (That’s Me)\n\nI always was keen to some sort of systematic approach and always liked to put something into order. As a child I was obsessed with encyclopedic dictionaries – most about the animal kingdom, but it was really the idea of a complete system of knowledge which got me hooked. I always started to collect something within a file folder. When I look back, the filing seems to be the durable element of all my childhood projects instead of the topics themselves.\n\nFlirting With Knowledge\n\n20 years later.\n\nDuring my university studies I fell in love with the huge library and copied every piece of paper and made huge piles in my room. I tried to conserve the knowledge externally. But I realized that this couldn’t be a solution if I ever wanted to put any use to that mess.\n\nWhen I remember my effort, I am surprised that it took so long to give up the habit of building piles. Perhaps this was due to my romantic perception of a really messy scholar’s room. In Germany, we have a phrase that says “the genius reigns over the chaos”. But then again, perhaps I just needed an excuse to be messy. :)\n\nThe Birth of the Zettelkasten\n\nDuring my studies I searched for a better solution and found it in the form of Luhmann’s work on knowledge management.\n\nThus, ** I found the Zettelkasten was!** I was in love immediately, and it is an ongoing romance.\n\nI did some research and found that Luhmann actually wrote an article on his Zettelkasten. I took it as my gospel of truth. I inferred a few laws and rules for my own Zettelkasten.\n\nAt this point I was still working with paper and index cards. I think it was because of my romantic idea of analogous knowledge work. But in essence I tried to mimic Luhmann’s Zettelkasten.\n\nAt the same time I researched a historical perspective on the Zettelkasten. In philosophy, so many big thinkers impressed me that I didn’t want to believe that they don’t organize themselves.\n\nI used the knowledge of my historical studies and found that quite a lot of scholars tried to overcome the limitations of human cognition with some technical device.\n\nEntering Puberty aka Digitalization\n\nI was into the idea that my Zettelkasten should be analog as a real card index. But soon I realized that I shouldn’t omit the advantages of the digital age. I looked for dedicated knowledge management software. There are even apps that try to mimic the Zettelkasten of Luhmann. I was prone to the idea of a local wiki and started to arrange me with DokuWiki.\n\nMeanwhile, I interviewed many professors all over university and was shocked: all of them trusted solely in the fact that they are working in a digital environment. They believed that a full-text through their saved articles was enough. All my questions about hypertext, neural networks, and having a second brain – questions I assumed that a philosopher should be thrilled about – seemed to bore or even irritate them.\n\nRetrospectively, I should have seen this as a chance to be a pioneer rather than being disappointed in my professors.\n\nExiting Puberty: Christians Plain Text Approach\n\nI was not so competent in dealing with technology. I still have some missing points in that area. But lucky as I am, I met Christian. He’s a programmer, so technology is his home base. Our friendship really took off because of the Zettelkasten (and that he moved to my neighborhood).\n\nTogether, we helped each other strip much of the so-called “features” away which we had included in our Zettelkasten systems.\n\nFor example: I was so into the wiki because I was a heavy mouse user and liked the looks of a hypertext wiki. Pure .txt was a little too rough for my aesthetics. I learned from Christian just to live on pure text (with a little Markdown) and more comfortable with a keyboard-heavy usage of my computer.\n\nWhat Comes Next?\n\nMy Zettelkasten started with a pile of paper, turned into a wiki, and became a system-wide note-taking method that has its heart in a folder called archive. I first turned digital, then lean and minimal. Most of the people call me nerdy when it comes to my Zettelkasten. In my perception it is just the consequence of a romantic wish to live a life as a scholar like the old days.\n\nI am looking forward to what happens next since the principle of the Zettelkasten took over my whole system. For example, I don’t limit assigning IDs to Zettels in my Archive. Every content related file (text, image, table) has its own ID. I heavily link between files.\n\nI am excited because it seems that some sort of brain-like system is unfolding in front of my eyes. There are different parts that specialize on different tasks:\n\nI have an archive of Zettels that only contains my Zettels as notes.\n\nI have an archive of images.\n\nI have an archive of all my journals."
