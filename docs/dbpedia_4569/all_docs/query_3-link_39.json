A Hart, “Definition and Theory in Jurisprudence,” Law Quarterly Review 70 (1954): 37–60.\n\nThis point was powerfully made (even though it did not receive the attention it deserved) by Nicholas Onuf, Legal Theory: Law Making in the Global Community (Durham: North Carolina Academic Press, 1982).\n\nJ.L.

While he considers law to be “whatever people identify and treat to their practices as law”——basically opting for a “folk” version of law——but then wants to move to “second level constructs” that help us identify phenomena to which the label “law” has been conventionally attached. Of course this is the $10,000 question that legal pluralists have not satisfactorily answered, despite a turn from a largely anthropological analysis of law to perspective informed by general jurisprudence.
