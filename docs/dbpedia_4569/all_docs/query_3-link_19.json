        "text": "5 Functionalism, neo-functionalism and system analysis / Niklas Luhmann\n\nSubrat Rath and Dev Pathak\n\nAfter returning from Germany he published his classic essay, „Functions and Causality‟, that critiques the Parsonian idea of functionalism. Because of this outstanding work he was called upon to serve as professor in a number of institutions before he finally took the professorship at Bielefeld University. He served there for the rest of his academic career. His other writings covered the field of love, mass-media, education, risk and so on. In 1971 Luhmann and Habermas co-jointly published a book named „Theorie Der Gesellaschaft order Sozialtechnologie: was Leister die Systemforschung (Theory of Society or Social Technology: What does System Research Accomplish?). In 1997 he published his magnum opus „The Society of Society‟ that deals with the individual function of society, such as law, science and art etc. He also deals with the individual explanations like, „science of science, economies of society, the art of society, the law of society, the politics of society, and the religion of society‟. However a combination of all these analyses were published jointly in the form of a book entitled, „The Social Systems: The Outline of the General Theory‟. It is a huge book of 674 pages and is considered as the most rewarding presentation of his theoretical core."
