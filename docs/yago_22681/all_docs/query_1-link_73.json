Its Frederik VIII King of Denmark. The caption says:\n\nKing of Denmark\n\nParis June 15 1907\n\nThe back says\n\nSouvenir of June 16 1907\n\nI don't know why Frederik was in Paris on that date.\n\nhe is the longest heir to the danish throne throne he spend 43 years of waiting gosh that must be hard for him since he was interesting in liberalism whish was the cause why his father keep him away from affair of state and when he does become king his health was poor and he only reign for 6 years the shortest of all glucksburg danish sovereigns\n\nhe is the longest heir to the danish throne throne he spend 43 years of waiting gosh that must be hard for him since he was interesting in liberalism whish was the cause why his father keep him away from affair of state and when he does become king his health was poor and he only reign for 6 years the shortest of all glucksburg danish sovereigns\n\nHe could be beatten by to the present Crown Prince Frederik who is no Crown Prince since 37 years already. The difference is only that he became heir at the age of 4 and not with 20 then Frederik VIII.\n\no my god i wonder how this title crown prince affect them cause queen margrethe always say it was the worst moment of her life when she was told the meaning of being heiress since it mean your parent[ the sovereign ] has to died in order for you to become king i think other european country should adopt the way the dutch do it like abdicating when you rule for a long time\n\nHe died in such a strange and ridiculous manner for a king, the poor man. Almost impossible for it to happen now.\n\nIs it very, very, very certain that he was just taking a walk in Hamburg and collapsed and nothing else was going on? Because that sounds more like the start of a mystery than most fiction does.\n\nHe died in such a strange and ridiculous manner for a king, the poor man.
