        "text": "Christian VIII of Denmark (18 September 1786 – 20 January 1848), also known as Christian Frederick I of Norway, was the King of Norway from February to October 1814 (succeeding Frederick VI and preceding Charles XIII) and King of Denmark from 1839 to 1848 (succeeding Frederick VI and preceding Frederick VII.\n\nBiography[]\n\nChristian was the son of Frederick of Denmark and Sophia Frederica of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, born in Ludwigslust in 1786. He was the son of the hereditary prince of Denmark, but his father never became king, only acting as regent of the country for his schizophrenic relative King Christian VII of Denmark. Prince Christian married Charlotte Frederica of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, his cousin, in 1806 but the marriage ended in 1810. In 1814 he married Caroline Amalie of Schleswig-Holstein.\n\nThat year, Christian was elected Stattholder (President) of Norway when it declared its independence from Denmark, ending the Kalmar Union. He was made President in February but had to deal with the Swedish Party, pro-Sweden-Norway union activists. Norway was taken over by Sweden in a war in 1814, marking the end of Sweden's involvement in warfare. Christian returned to Denmark, and became king in 1839. He died of sepsis (blood poisoning) in 1848."
