Amalienborg is the headquarters of the Danish monarchy, comprising of four identical palaces surrounding an octagonal square. Frederick VIII's palace is named after the monarch who lived and reigned from here between 1906-1912. Today is serves as the official home of Crown Prince Frederick, the heir to the Danish throne, and his wife Crown Princess Mary.",
