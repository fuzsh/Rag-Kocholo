        "text": "On Sunday night, Queen Margrethe of Denmark will abdicate the throne she held for 52 years - stepping aside with grace to let the next generation take charge of Denmark's royal household.\n\nThe very same day, Crown Prince Frederik and Australia's homegrown Princess Mary will take the next step in their fairytale romance as they are crowned Denmark's new king and queen.\n\nCompared to the pomp and ceremony of King Charles III's coronation last year, the Danish royal household will hold a much more understated ceremony.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the day of the royal abdication:\n\nREAD MORE: Danish Queen Margrethe announces surprise abdication\n\nWhat can we expect on the day?\n\nQueen Margrethe's abdication will be a straightforward affair.\n\nThe Queen will travel to Christiansborg Palace - a palace in the centre of Denmark's capital Copenhagen.\n\nThere, during a short ceremony, she will step down as the nation's monarch.\n\nProclamations will be read, cannons fired, and Crown Prince Frederik will be named King Frederik X, alongside his wife, the newly minted Queen Mary.\n\nQueen Margrethe's abdication day timeline\n\nCrown Prince Frederik and Princess Mary will be crowned as Denmark's King and Queen at 1.35pm local time in Copenhagen (11.35pm Sunday night AEDT).\n\nHere's how the timing of the ceremony, from Queen Margrethe's abdication to Frederik's proclamation as King will proceed.\n\nKeen watchers will be in for a late night, with the evening's proceedings beginning shortly before midnight on Sunday night.\n\n1.35pm (11.35pm AEDT): The Crown Prince Frederik and Mary, and their son Prince Christian travel by car from Frederik VIII's Palace, Amalienborg to Christiansborg Palace.\n\n1.37pm (11.37pm AEDT): Queen Margrethe will simultaneously take her final carriage ride as Queen to Christiansborg Palace, escorted by the Guard Hussar Regiment.\n\n2pm (midnight AEDT): Queen Margrethe will formally step down, and sign a declaration of her abdication during a Council of State Meeting. Members of government, the Crown Prince and Princess, and Prince Christian will be present. She will then leave the palace by car.\n\n2.30pm (00.30am AEDT): The King and Queen will hold a small function for specially invited guests.\n\n3pm (1am AEDT): Denmark's prime minister will proclaim the accession of His Majesty King Frederik X to the throne. He will then make a speech from the palace balcony.\n\n3.10pm (1.10am AEDT): Cannons will fire a salute, and the royal standard will be lowered at Christian IX's palace, before being raised at Frederik VIII's Palace.\n\n3.30pm (1.30am AEDT): The King and Queen will be escorted by carriage to Frederik VIII's palace.\n\n10am Monday (8pm AEDT): There will be a reception to celebrate the succession to the throne in Danish parliament, which will be attended by members of the royal family.\n\nWhy is Queen Margrethe abdicating?\n\nOn New Year's Day, Queen Margrethe told the public she had chosen to step down after undergoing back surgery in early 2023.\n\n\"The surgery naturally gave rise to thinking about the future - whether the time had come to leave the responsibility to the next generation,\" the 83-year-old monarch said.\n\n\"I have decided that now is the right time.\"\n\nShe leaves the throne to her son, who will be named King Frederik X.\n\nFollowing him in the line of succession is his son Prince Christian and other children: Princess Isabella, Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine.\n\nFuture King Frederik X's younger brother, Prince Joachim, remains fifth in line, then his children.\n\nWhat will be Queen Margrethe's new title after she steps down?\n\nThe Danish royal household has confirmed that Queen Margrethe's title will remain Her Majesty Queen Margrethe.\n\nWho will be attending?\n\nOn January 14, only the main royal family and the Danish prime minister are likely to be in attendance.\n\nThen, members of the wider Danish royal family are expected to attend the parliament reception on January 15, along with government officials."
