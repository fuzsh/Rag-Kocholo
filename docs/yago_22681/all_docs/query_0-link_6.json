        "text": "Mary of Great Britain (March 5, 1723 – January 14, 1772) was the second-youngest daughter of King George II of Great Britain and his wife, Princess Caroline of Brandenburg-Ansbach, and Landgravine of Hesse-Cassel as the wife of Landgrave Friedrich II of Hesse-Cassel.\n\nEarly life\n\nPrincess Mary of Great Britain was born at Leicester House, Westminster, London. At the time of her birth her father was the Prince of Wales, later King George II of Great Britain and Ireland. Her mother was Caroline of Brandenburg-Ansbach, daughter of Margrave Johann Friedrich of Brandenburg-Ansbach and his second wife, Princess Eleonore Erdmuthe of Saxe-Eisenach.\n\nHer father succeeded, as King George II of Great Britain and Ireland, on June 11, 1727, and she became “HRH The Princess Mary”.\n\nUpon her mother’s death in 1737, Queen Caroline, entrusted Mary to her elder sister Princess Caroline, urging her to “do what she could to support the meek and mild disposition of Princess Mary”.\n\nMarriage\n\nA marriage was negotiated with Landgrave Friedrich II of Hesse-Cassel, the only son and heir of Landgrave Wilhelm VIII of Hesse-Cassel, and his wife Dorothea Wilhelmine of Saxe-Zeitz. His paternal grandfather was Landgrave Charles I of Hesse-Cassel, and his paternal uncle was King Friedrich I of Sweden.\n\nFor the marriage, Parliament voted Princess Mary £40,000.\n\nThey married by proxy at the Chapel Royal of St. James’s Palace in London on May 8, then in person on June 28, 1740 at Bellevue Palace, Cassel. They had four sons, three of whom survived to adulthood.\n\nThe marriage was unhappy, and Friedrich was said to be “brutal” and “a boor”. Frederick reportedly subjected Mary to spousal abuse. In late 1746, Mary made an extended trip to Britain to escape his maltreatment. The couple separated in 1754 on Friedrich’s conversion to Roman Catholicism. She was supported by her father-in-law, who provided her with a residence in Hanau, as she did not wish to return to Great Britain, but to stay on the continent to raise her children.\n\nIn 1756, Mary moved to Denmark, to take care of the children of her sister Louise of Great Britain, who had died in 1751. She was the wife of King Frederik V of Denmark and Norway the grandson of King Frederik IV of Denmark and Norway and the only son of Crown Prince Christian and Sophie Magdalene of Brandenburg-Kulmbach.\n\nShe took her children with her, and they were raised at the royal court and her sons were married to Danish princesses.\n\nTheir eldest son, Prince-Elector Wilhelm I of Hesse (the Landgravate of Hesse-Cassel was elevated to a Prince-Elector of Hesse of the Holy Roman Empire in 1803) married his first cousin, Princess Wilhelmina Caroline of Denmark and Norway (1747–1820), who was the second surviving daughter of King Frederik V of Denmark and Norway and Princess Louise of Great Britain.\n\nTheir second son, Prince Charles, was elevated to the rank of Landgrave and also married his first cousin, (sister to his brothers wife) Princess Louise of Denmark, who was also a daughter of King Frederik V of Denmark and Norway and Princess Louise of Great Britain.\n\nThe third son, Prince Friedrich of Hesse-Cassel did not marry his first cousin. On December 2, 1786 in Biebrich, he married Princess Caroline of Nassau-Usingen (1762 – 1823), a remarkable heiress of a family which became extinct in male line.\n\nPrincess Mary’s husband succeeded his father as Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel in 1760, and so Mary was technically Landgravine Consort for the last twelve years of her life, despite her estrangement from her husband.\n\nMary died on 14 or 16 January 1772, aged 48 at Hanau, Germany.\n\nThe descendants of Princess Mary of Great and her husband Landgrave Friedrich II of Hesse-Cassel include (among others) King Frederik VIII of Denmark, Queen Alexandra of the United Kingdom, (wife of King Edward VII of the United Kingdom) Empress Marie Feodorovna of All the Russias (wife of Emperor Alexander II of Russia), King George I of the Hellenes and Crown Princess Thyra of Hanover.\n\nChristian X (September 26, 1870 – April 20, 1947) was King of Denmark from 1912 to his death in 1947, and the only King of Iceland as Kristján X, in the form of a personal union rather than a political union between 1918 and 1944.\n\nChristian was born on September 26, 1870 at his parents’ country residence, the Charlottenlund Palace, located on the shores of the Øresund Strait 10 kilometers north of Copenhagen on the island of Zealand in Denmark, during the reign of his paternal grandfather, King Christian IX.\n\nChristian was the first child of Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark and his wife Louise of Sweden. His father was the eldest son of King Christian IX of Denmark and Louise of Hesse-Cassel, and his mother was the only daughter of King Carl XV of Sweden and Norway and Louise of the Netherlands.\n\nHe was a member of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sondenburg-Glücksburg, a branch of the House of Oldenburg, and the first monarch since King Frederik VII born into the Danish royal family; both his father and his grandfather were born as princes of a ducal family from Schleswig.\n\nAmong his siblings was King Haakon VII of Norway. His son became Frederik IX of Denmark. Among his cousins were King George V of the United Kingdom, Emperor Nicholas II of Russia, and King Constantine I of Greece, while Queen Maud of Norway, was both his cousin and sister-in-law.\n\nAs a young man, Prince Christian fell in love with the French Princess Marguerite of Orléans, who was the younger sister of his uncle Prince Valdemar’s wife Princess Marie of Orléans.\n\nPrincess Marguerite of Orléans (1869 – 1940) was a member of the House of Orléans, daughter of Prince Robert d’Orléans, Duke of Chartres and Princess Françoise d’Orléans. She bore the courtesy title of Princess of Orleans. Both of her parents were grandchildren of the French King, Louis Philippe I of France.\n\nPrince Christian’s feelings, however, were not reciprocated, and after a few years of unhappy infatuation, she married in 1896 Marie Armand Patrice de Mac Mahon, 2nd Duke of Magenta, son of the French Marshal and President Patrice de MacMahon.\n\nChristian married Duchess Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin in Cannes on 26 April 1898; she was a daughter of Friedrich Franz III, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and Grand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna of Russia, the only daughter and second child of Grand Duke Michael Nicolaievich of Russia and his wife Princess Cecilie of Baden. Paternally, she was a granddaughter of Emperor Nicholas I of Russia.\n\nDuchess Alexandrine had a sister, Duchess Cecilie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, (1886 – 1954), who married Prince Wilhelm of Prussia German Crown Prince the eldest son and child of the eldest child of Wilhelm II, German Emperor and King of Prussia and his wife Princess Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg, and thus a great-grandson of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. As Emperor Wilhelm’s heir, he was the last Crown Prince of the German Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia, until the abolition of the monarchy.\n\nDuchess Alexandrine eventually became his queen consort. They had two sons:\n\n1. Prince Frederik (1899–1972), later King Frederik IX of Denmark\n\n2. Prince Knud (1900–1976), later Knud, Hereditary Prince of Denmark\n\nThe couple were given Christian VIII’s Palace at Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen as their residence and Sorgenfri Palace north of Copenhagen as a summer residence. Furthermore, the couple received Marselisborg Palace in Aarhus as a wedding present from the people of Denmark in 1898. In 1914, the King also built the villa Klitgården in Skagen.\n\nOn May 14, 1912, King Frederik VIII died at the age of 68 after collapsing from shortness of breath while taking an evening walk in Hamburg, Germany. He had been returning from a recuperation stay in Nice, France, and was staying anonymously in the city before continuing to Copenhagen.\n\nPrince Christian was in Copenhagen when he heard about his father’s demise and succeeded to the throne at the age of 41. He was proclaimed king from the balcony of Christian VII’s Palace at Amalienborg by the Prime Minister Klaus Berntsen as King Christian X.\n\nHis character has been described as authoritarian and he strongly stressed the importance of royal dignity and power. His reluctance to fully embrace democracy resulted in the Easter Crisis of 1920, in which he dismissed the democratically elected Social Liberal cabinet with which he disagreed, and installed one of his own choosing.\n\nThis action was in accordance with the letter of the constitution, but the principle of parliamentarianism had been considered a constitutional custom since 1901.\n\nFaced with mass demonstrations, a general strike organized by the Social Democrats and the risk of the monarchy being overthrown he was forced to accept that a monarch could not keep a government in office against the will of parliament, as well as his reduced role as a symbolic head of state.\n\nDuring the German occupation of Denmark, Christian became a popular symbol of resistance, particularly because of the symbolic value of the fact that he rode every day through the streets of Copenhagen unaccompanied by guards.\n\nWith a reign spanning two world wars, and his role as a rallying symbol for Danish national sentiment during the German occupation, he became one of the most popular Danish monarchs of modern times. King Christian X was known to parade through town on his horse, Jubilee.\n\nDeath\n\nOn his death in Amalienborg Palace, Copenhagen, in 1947, Christian X was interred along with other members of the Danish royal family in Roskilde Cathedral near Copenhagen. Although he had been behind the politics of Erik Scavenius, a cloth armband of the type worn by members of the Danish resistance movement was placed on his coffin under a castrum doloris.\n\nKing Christian X of Denmark was succeeded by his eldest son Prince Frederik who became King Frederik IX of Denmark.\n\nCarl XV (May 3, 1826 – September 18, 1872) was King of Sweden and Norway from July 8, 1859 until his death in 1872. In Norway he was often referred to as Carl IV, Though known as King Carl XV in Sweden (and also on contemporary Norwegian coins), he was actually the ninth Swedish king by that name, as his predecessor Carl IX (reigned 1604–1611) had adopted a numeral according to a fictitious history of Sweden. Carl XV was the third Swedish monarch from the House of Bernadotte. He was the first one to be born in Sweden, and the first to be raised from birth in the Lutheran faith.\n\nEarly life\n\nHe was born in Stockholm Palace, Stockholm, in 1826 and dubbed Duke of Scania at birth. Born the eldest son of Crown Prince Oscar of Sweden and his wife Crown Princess Josephine, the first of six children of Eugène de Beauharnais, Duke of Leuchtenberg (1781–1824), and his wife, Princess Augusta of Bavaria (1788–1851). Her paternal grandmother and namesake was Joséphine Tascher de La Pagerie, the first wife of Emperor Napoleon; she was given the name ‘Joséphine’ by Napoleon’s request. Her maternal grandfather was King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria.\n\nPrince Carl of Sweden would be second in line to the throne of his grandfather, the ruling King Carl XIV Johan of Sweden. During his childhood he was placed in the care of the royal governess countess Christina Ulrika Taube. When he was just 15, he was given his first officer’s commission in 1841 by his grandfather the king.\n\nCrown Prince\n\nThe aging King Carl XIV Johan would suffer a stroke on his 81st birthday in 1844, dying little more than a month later. His successor would be his son, Carl’s father Oscar, who ascended the throne as King Oscar I of Sweden. Upon his father’s accession to the throne in 1844, Crown Prince Carl was made a chancellor of the universities of Uppsala and Lund, and in 1853 chancellor of Royal Swedish Academy of Arts. On February 11, 1846 he was made an honorary member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe Crown Prince was Viceroy of Norway briefly in 1856 and 1857. He became Regent on September 25, 1857 and became King on the death of his father on July 8, 1859. As grandson of Princess Augusta of Bavaria, he was a descendant of King Gustaf I of Sweden and King Carl IX of Sweden, whose Vasa blood returned to the throne after being lost in 1818 when the childless King Carl XIII of Sweden died.\n\nMarriage\n\nPrincess Louise of the Netherlands (August 5, 1828 – March 30, 1871) was the daughter of Prince Frederick of the Netherlands and Princess Louise of Prussia.\n\nPrince Frederick of the Netherlands was the second child of King Willem I of the Netherlands and his wife Princess Wilhelmina of Prussia who was the daughter of King Friedrich Wilhelm II of Prussia and his second wife, Princess Frederica Louisa of Hesse-Darmstadt.\n\nPrincess Louise of the Netherlands mother, Princess Louise of Prussia,was the eighth child of King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia and Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Her education was to large extent entrusted to her Belgian governess Victoire Wauthier, and she studied French, German, English, Russian and piano.\n\nIn 1849, Princess Louise of the Netherlands was selected as a suitable spouse for Crown Prince Carl of Sweden and Norway. The marriage was arranged after the negotiations to arrange a marriage between Crown Prince and her cousin Princess Louise of Prussia had failed. The Princess Louise of Prussia was the second child and eldest daughter of Prince Charles of Prussia and Princess Marie of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. Her paternal grandfather was King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia.\n\nKing Oscar I of Sweden wished to secure royal family connections between the new Bernadotte dynasty and the old royal dynasties of Europe, and a Protestant princess was also seen as a necessary queen of the Protestant Sweden-Norway after two Catholic predecessors.\n\nPrincess Louise of the Netherlands fulfilled these credentials, and a great dowry was expected from the rich House of Orange-Nassau. Cabinet secretary Manderström was sent to inspect her, and diplomatically let it be known in his report that Louise had an excellent education and a good character but that she was not physically attractive.\n\nIn August 1849, a meeting was arranged between Princess Louise and Crown Prince Carl in the Hague. Reportedly, Louise fell in love with Carl elt an immediate attraction, while Carl in contrast was disappointed in her appearance. Crown Prince Carl, however, was convinced to agree to the marriage by the King.\n\nThe engagement was officially declared in February 1850. The expectations of her great fortune was debated in Sweden, both in the parliament during the discussions about the allowance, and in the radical press, who suggested that the monarch would now be able to finance the construction of the Swedish rail road net by himself. In reality, however, her dowry turned out to be very small.\n\nDuring the engagement, Louise studied the Swedish language and history; she never learnt Norwegian, however. Because the Dutch government had supported the marriage, she did not have to renounce her rights to the Dutch throne upon her marriage.\n\nOn June 19, 1850 they married in Stockholm at Storkyrkan (Swedish: The Great Church’), also called Stockholms domkyrka (Stockholm Cathedral) and Sankt Nikolai kyrka (Church of Saint Nicholas), and is the oldest church in Stockholm.\n\nThe couple were personally quite dissimilar; Louise was a cultured and refined woman, however, she was considered to be quite plain and as previously mentioned, Crown Prince was disappointed with her appearance. Louise was in love with her husband, whereas he preferred other women, saddening her deeply. His well-known mistresses included the actress Laura Bergnéhr, the countess Josephine Sparre, Wilhelmine Schröder and the actresses Hanna Styrell and Elise Hwasser, and the Crown Prince neglected his shy wife. On the other hand, his relationship to his only daughter, Louise, was warm and close.\n\nNeedless to say, the relationship between Louise and Carl was unhappy. The couple had dissimilar personalities, with Louise being introverted, shy and with a preference for a simple life, and Charles extraverted and with a love for parties and social life. Louise was reportedly unhappily in love with Charles, who found her unattractive and was unfaithful to her, which pained her considerably.\n\nFrom 1852 until 1860, Carl’s relationship with the perviously mentioned Josephine Sparre, maid of honor to Louise, which caused a scandal. Sparre was described as so dominant that the Crown Princess and her maid of honor was said to have changed places with each other and Louise being the lady-in-waiting to Josephine Sparre rather than the other way around. Fritz von Dardel described Sparre: “The lady in question is a great favorite of the Crown Prince as well as with the Crown Princess, and she governs them both entirely in everything about their daily life. Gifted with an unusual talent to please and make herself indispensable, she has managed to capture the Crown Prince to a strange degree.”\n\nLouise was given sympathy and Carl was considered to be treating her with neglect. A known episode which attracted attention took place at the birthday garden party of Louise at Drottningholm Palace in 1857, when the Crown Prince proposed a toast to his “secret love” with both Louise and Josephine Sparre present. This caused a scene, and his brother, Prince Oscar, reprimanded him indirectly by asking his own spouse, Sofia of Nassau, to toast with him. This scene caused Louise to burst into tears and suffer a nervous attack.\n\nIssue\n\nBy his wife, Louise, Carl had two children, a son who died in infancy and a daughter, named Louise after her mother. Although her father made several attempts to have Princess Louise of Sweden ecognized as his heir, she was barred from the succession as at the time only males could ascend the throne of Sweden. In 1869, she married the future King Frederik VIII of Denmark, with whom she had eight children.\n\nThe early death of his only legitimate son meant that he was succeeded on the throne of Sweden by his younger brother who became King Oscar II of Sweden.\n\nIt is interesting to speculate that if Princess Louise had been allowed to be the Queen Regnant of Sweden and Norway and had still married King Frederik VIII of Denmark, their son, King Christian X of Denmark could have theoretically united all three Scandinavian Thrones.\n\nKing Carl XV also sired an illegitimate son, Carl Johan Bolander, (February 4, 1854 – July 28, 1903), the father of Bishop Nils Bolander, and daughter, Ellen Svensson Hammar (28 October 1865 – 1931), and it has been widely rumored that he had many more extramarital children.\n\nNo subsequent King of Sweden to this day is a descendant of King Carl XV. However, his descendants are or have been on the thrones of Denmark, Luxembourg, Greece, Belgium and Norway. A few weeks before Carl XV’s death, his daughter Louise (then the Crown Princess of Denmark) gave birth to her second son. The young Prince Carl of Denmark became christened as grandfather’s namesake.\n\nIn 1905 this grandson, Prince Carl of Denmark, ascended the throne of Norway, becoming thus his maternal grandfather’s successor in that country, and assumed the reign name Haakon VII. The present king, Harald V of Norway, is Carl XV’s great-great-grandson, through both his father and mother.\n\nOn May 14, 1912 while on a return journey from a trip to Nice with his wife and four of his children, King Frederik VIII of Denmark made a short stop in Hamburg, staying at the Hotel Hamburger Hof under the pseudonym “Count Kronsberg”.\n\nThat evening, Frederik—while incognito—went out for a stroll on the Jungfernstieg, during which he became faint and collapsed on a park bench at Gänsemarkt. He was discovered by a police officer who took him to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead; his cause of death was announced as a heart attack. As King Frederik VIII was incognito at the time and had no papers on him, his body was brought to the local morgue, where he was identified by the hotel manager the next morning.\n\nAlexandrine’s husband acceded to the throne as King Christian X, and Alexandrine became Queen Consort of Denmark. She is not considered to have played any political role, but is described as being a loyal support to her spouse.\n\nShe was interested in music, and acted as the protector of the musical societies Musikforeningen i København and Den danske Richard Wagnerforening. She was known for her needlework, which she sold for charitable purposes. After the death of her mother-in-law Louise of Sweden in 1926, she succeeded her as the official protector of the various charity organisations founded by Louise. She enjoyed golf and photography.\n\nDuring World War I, she founded Dronningens Centralkomité af 1914 (“The Queen’s Central Committee of 1914”) to the support of poor families. The revolution in Russia brought much heartbreak for Alexandrine as three of her uncles, Nicholas, George and Sergey, were killed by the Bolsheviks.\n\nShe survived the 1918 flu pandemic.\n\nWorld War II\n\nOn April 9, 1940 at 4 am Nazi Germany invaded Denmark in a surprise attack, overwhelming Denmark’s Army and Navy and destroying the Danish Army Air Corps. King Christian X quickly realized that Denmark was in an impossible position.\n\nIts territory and population were far too small to hold out against Germany for any sustained period of time. Its flat land would have resulted in it being easily overrun by German panzers; Jutland, for instance, would have been overrun in short order by a panzer attack from Schleswig-Holstein immediately to the south.\n\nUnlike its Nordic neighbours, Denmark had no mountain ranges from which a drawn-out resistance could be mounted against the German army. With no prospect of being able to hold out for any length of time, and faced with the explicit threat of the Luftwaffe bombing the civilian population of Copenhagen, and with only one general in favour of continuing to fight, King Christian X and the entire Danish government capitulated at about 6 am, in exchange for retaining political independence in domestic matters, beginning the occupation of Denmark, which lasted until May 5, 1945.\n\nIn contrast to his brother, King Haakon VII of Norway, and Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, King George II of the Hellenes, Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg, King Peter II of Yugoslavia, President Edvard Beneš of Czechoslovakia and President Władysław Raczkiewicz of Poland, all of whom went into exile during the Nazi occupation of their countries, King Christian X (like King Leopold III of the Belgians) remained in his capital throughout the occupation of Denmark, being to the Danish people a visible symbol of the national cause (Haakon VII escaped the German advance after refusing to accept a Nazi-friendly puppet regime.)\n\nThe royal couple was given great popularity as national symbols during the World War II occupation, which was demonstrated during a tour through the country in 1946. Before the occupation, she and her daughter-in-law were engaged in mobilising the Danish women.\n\nHer rejection of Major General Kurt Himer, Chief of Staff to General Kaupisch on April 9, 1940 became a symbol for her loyalty toward Denmark before her birth country Germany. When General Himer asked for an audience with the monarch, Christian was persuaded to receive him by his daughter-in-law as he would any other, which was supported by Alexandrine. He asked to do so alone, but Alexandrine told him she would interrupt them.\n\nWhen the General was about to leave, she came in; and when he greeted her, she said: “General, this is not the circumstance in which I expected to greet a countryman.”\n\nIt was reported, that although Alexandrine was seen as shy and disliked official ceremonies, she had a “sharp” intelligence, and she was, together with her daughter-in-law, Ingrid of Sweden, a true support of the monarch and a driving force for the resistance toward the occupation within the royal house.\n\nIt was also reported, that in contrast to the monarch himself and the Crown Prince, the Queen and the Crown Princess never lost their calm when the nation was attacked.\n\nAs she was not the Head of the Royal House, she could show herself in public more than her spouse, who did not wish to show support to the occupation by being seen in public, and she used this to engage in various organisations for social relief to ease the difficulties caused by the occupation. Kaj Munk is quoted to describe the public appreciation of her during World War II with his comment: “Protect our Queen, the only German we would like to keep!”\n\nKing Christian X used to ride daily through the streets of Copenhagen unaccompanied while the people stood and waved to him. One apocryphal story relates that one day, a German soldier remarked to a young boy that he found it odd that the King would ride with no bodyguard. The boy reportedly replied, “All of Denmark is his bodyguard.”\n\nLater life\n\nAt his death in Amalienborg Palace, Copenhagen, in 1947, at the age of 76, King Christian X was interred along with other members of the Danish royal family in Roskilde Cathedral near Copenhagen. Although he had been behind the politics of Erik Scavenius, a cloth armband of the type worn by members of the Danish resistance movement was placed on his coffin under a castrum doloris.\n\nWhen Queen Alexandrine was widowed; she became the first Queen Dowager of Denmark to opt not to use that title.\n\nShe died in Copenhagen on December 28 in 1952 at the age of 73 and is interred next to her husband in Roskilde Cathedral.\n\nAlexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (24 December 1879 – 28 December 1952) was Queen of Denmark from 1912 to 1947, as well Queen of Iceland from 1918 to 1944 as the spouse of King Christian X. She was the paternal grandmother of the current reigning Queen of Denmark, Margrethe II.\n\nAlexandrine was born a Duchess of Mecklenburg-Schwerin on Christmas Eve of 1879, in the city of Schwerin, the capital of the vast Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin in Northern Germany. Her father was Friedrich Franz, Hereditary Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin; who was the eldest son of and heir to the reigning Grand Duke Friedrich Franz II.\n\nHer mother was Grand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna of Russia the only daughter and second child of Grand Duke Michael Nicolaievich of Russia and his wife Princess Cecilie of Baden. Paternally, she was a granddaughter of Emperor Nicholas I of Russia.\n\nAlexandrine was her parents’ first child, and was born eleven months after their wedding in St. Petersburg. She was born in the Neustädtisches Palais (English: New Town Palace) in Schwerin, which was her parents’ residence in the city at the time.\n\nDuchess Alexandrine had two younger siblings: her only brother was Duke Friedrich Franz, who in 1897 succeeded their father as Grand Duke Friedrich Franz IV of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and her only sister was Duchess Cecilie, who in 1906 married the German Crown Prince Wilhelm of Prussia, eldest son of German Emperor William II and Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein.\n\nShe was also a paternal first cousin of Queen Juliana of the Netherlands. Her mother was the paternal aunt of Princess Irina Alexandrovna of Russia, the wife of Felix Yusupov, one of the murderers of Rasputin.\n\nAfter their father’s succession as Grand Duke Friedrich Franz III of Mecklenburg-Schwerin upon the death of his father on April 15, 1883, Alexandrine grew up with her brother and sister at the Castle in Schwerin, at the royal residences of Ludwigslust Palace and the Gelbensande hunting lodge, only a few kilometres from the Baltic Sea coast.\n\nHer father had a fragile health and suffered badly from dermatitis, asthma and respiratory disorders from an early age. The wet, damp, and cold Northern European climate of Mecklenburg was not good for his health, and as a result, Alexandrine spent a large amount of time with her family away from Mecklenburg, by the Lake Geneva, and in Palermo, Baden-Baden and Cannes in the south of France, where the family owned a large estate, the Villa Wenden. Cannes was favoured at the time by European royalty, including some whom Alexandrine met such as Empress Eugénie of France and her future husband’s uncle, King Edward VII of the United Kingdom.\n\nIt was also in Cannes during the winter visit of 1897 that Duchess Alexandrine met her future husband, Prince Christian of Denmark, the eldest son of Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Louise of Denmark.\n\nThe two young royals were engaged in Schwerin on March 24, 1897. In April 1897, shortly after the engagement was announced, her father the Grand Duke died suddenly at the age of just 46 years. His sudden death was somewhat shrouded in mystery as it was first reported that he had committed suicide by throwing himself off a bridge. However, according to the official report, he died in his garden when he fell over a low wall during a bout of shortness of breath.\n\nThe wedding of Duchess Alexandrine and Prince Christian was celebrated on April 26, 1898 in Cannes, when she was 18 years old. Prince Christian was 27 years old.\n\nThey had two children:\n\n1. Prince Frederik (1899–1972), later King Frederik IX of Denmark; married Princess Ingrid of Sweden\n\n2. Prince Knud (1900–1976), later Knud, Hereditary Prince of Denmark; married Princess Caroline-Mathilde of Denmark.\n\nEarly years in Denmark\n\nUpon their arrival in Denmark, the couple were given Christian VIII’s Palace at the Amalienborg Palace complex in central Copenhagen as their principal residence and Sorgenfri Palace in Kongens Lyngby north of Copenhagen as a summer residence.\n\nFurthermore, the couple received Marselisborg Palace in Aarhus in Jutland as a wedding present from the people of Denmark in 1902, the garden of which was to become one of her greatest interests. In 1914, the King and Queen also built the villa Klitgården in Skagen in Northern Jutland.\n\nOn January 29, 1906, her husband’s grandfather King Christian IX died, and Christian’s father ascended the throne as King Frederik VIII. Christian himself became Crown Prince and Alexandrine became Crown Princess.\n\nDuchess Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (December 24, 1879 –December 28, 1952) was Queen of Denmark as the spouse of King Christian X. She was also Queen of Iceland (where the name was officially Alexandría) from December 1, 1918 to June 17, 1944.\n\nDuchess Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin\n\nFamily\n\nAlexandrine was born a Duchess of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, in the city of Schwerin, Germany. Her father was Friedrich-Franz III, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin; her mother was Grand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna of Russia, the second of the seven children of Grand Duke Michael Nicolaievich of Russia and his wife, Grand Duchess Olga Feodorovna (born Princess Cecilie of Baden). Alexandrine was also a granddaughter of Emperor Nicholas I of Russia\n\nDuchess Alexandrine’s father, Friedrich-Franz III, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.\n\nDuchess Alexandrine’s mother, Grand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna of Russia\n\nShe was a paternal first cousin of Princess Irina Alexandrovna of Russia, the wife of Felix Yusupov, one of the murderers of Rasputin.\n\nCecilie, Alexandrine and Friedrich-Franz of Mecklenburg-Schwerin with their mother Grand Duchess Anastasia.\n\nAlexandrine’s only brother was Friedrich-Franz IV, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1882-1945), while her only sister was Duchess Cecilie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1886-1954) wife of German Crown Prince Wilhelm, eldest son of German Emperor Wilhelm II.\n\nMarriage and issue\n\nDuchess Alexandrine married Prince Christian of Denmark on April 26, 1898, in Cannes, France, when she was 18 years old. They had two children:\n\n* Prince Frederik (1899–1972), later King Frederik IX of Denmark; married Princess Ingrid of Sweden.\n\n* Prince Knud (1900–1976), later Knud, Hereditary Prince of Denmark; married Princess Caroline-Mathilde of Denmark.\n\nIn 1902, the couple were given Marselisborg Palace, and the garden was to become one of her greatest interests. Alexandrine became crown princess in 1906 with the death of King Christian IX of Denmark and in 1912 she became Queen Consort of Denmark upon the death of King Frederik VIII and the accession of Alexandrine’s husband as King Christian X. As Queen, Alexandrine is not considered to have played any political role, but is described as being a loyal support to her spouse.\n\nShe was interested in music, and acted as the protector of the musical societies Musikforeningen i København and Den danske Richard Wagnerforening. She was known for her needlework, which she sold for charitable purposes. After the death of her mother-in-law, Louise of Sweden in 1926, she succeeded her as the official protector of the various charity organisations founded by Louise. She enjoyed golf and photography. During World War I, she founded Dronningens Centralkomité af 1914 (“The Queen’s Central Committee of 1914”) to the support of poor families. She survived the 1918 flu pandemic.\n\nPrince Christian and Princess Alexandrine of Denmark with their eldest son Prince Frederik.\n\nThe couple was given great popularity as national symbols during the World War II occupation, which was demonstrated during a tour through the country in 1946. Before the occupation, she and her daughter-in-law were engaged in mobilising the Danish women. Her rejection of General Kaupisch on April 9, 1940 became a symbol for her loyalty toward Denmark before her birth country Germany.\n\nWhen the General of the occupation forces first asked for an audience with the monarch, Christian was persuaded to receive him by his daughter-in-law as he would any other, which was supported by Alexandrine. He asked to do so alone, but Alexandrine told him she would interrupt them. When the General was about to leave, she came in; and when he greeted her, she said: “General, this is not the circumstance in which I expected to greet a countryman.”\n\nIt was reported, that although Alexandrine was seen as shy and disliked official ceremonies, she had a “sharp” intelligence, and she was, together with her daughter-in-law, Ingrid of Sweden, a true support of the monarch and a driving force for the resistance toward the occupation within the royal house.\n\nIt was also reported, that in contrast to the monarch himself and the Crown Prince, the Queen and the Crown Princess never lost their calm when the nation was attacked.

Kaj Munk is quoted to describe the public appreciation of her during World War II with his comment: “Protect our Queen, the only German we would like to keep!”\n\nKing Christian X of Denmark with Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany\n\nIn 1947, she was widowed; on his death in Amalienborg Palace, Copenhagen, in 1947, Christian X was interred along other members of the Danish royal family in Roskilde Cathedral near Copenhagen. Their son succeeded as King Frederik IX of Denmark. Queen Alexandrine became the first queen dowager of Denmark to opt not to use that title. Instead she was known as Her Majesty Queen Alexandrine of Denmark. She was the paternal grandmother of the current reigning Queen of Denmark, Margrethe II.\n\nQueen Alexandrine died in Copenhagen on December 28, 1952 and is interred next to her husband in Roskilde Cathedral.\n\nCarl XV (Carl Ludvig Eugen) (May 3, 1826 – September 18 1872) was King of Sweden as Carl XV and King of Norway (He was proclaimed as King Carl XV of Norway but in recent times he has been referred to accurately as Carl IV) from 1859 until his death. Though known as King Carl XV in Sweden (and also on contemporary Norwegian coins), he was actually the ninth Swedish king by that name, as his predecessor Carl IX (reigned 1604–1611) had adopted a numeral according to a fictitious history of Sweden. Carl XV was the third Swedish monarch of the House of Bernadotte.\n\nParents\n\nHe was born in Stockholm Palace, Stockholm in 1826 and dubbed Duke of Scania at birth. Born the eldest son of Crown Prince Oscar of Sweden and his wife Crown Princess Josephine of Leuchtenberg, the first of six children of Eugène de Beauharnais, Duke of Leuchtenberg (1781 – 1824), and his wife, Princess Augusta of Bavaria (1788 – 1851). Her paternal grandmother and namesake was Joséphine Tascher de La Pagerie, the first wife of Napoleon: she was given the name ‘Joséphine’ by Napoleon’s request. Princess Augusta of Bavaria was the second child and eldest daughter of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria and Princess Augusta Wilhelmine of Hesse-Darmstadt.\n\nKing Oscar I of Sweden and Norway\n\nPrincess Josephine of Leuchtenberg\n\nAt his birth Prince Carl of Sweden would be second in line to the throne of his grandfather, the ruling King Carl XIV Johan of Sweden. During his childhood he was placed in the care of the royal governess countess Christina Ulrika Taube. When he was just 15, he was given his first officer’s commission in 1841 by his grandfather the king.\n\nCrown Prince\n\nThe aging King Carl XIV Johan would suffer a stroke on his 81st birthday in 1844, dying little more than a month later. His successor would be his son, Carl’s father Oscar, who ascended the throne as King Oscar I of Sweden. Upon his father’s accession to the throne in 1844, the young Carl was made a chancellor of the universities of Uppsala and Lund, and in 1853 chancellor of Royal Swedish Academy of Arts. On February 11, 1846 he was made an honorary member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\n\nOn June 19, 1850 Crown Prince Carl married in Stockholm Princess Louise of the Netherlands, daughter of Prince Frederik of the Netherlands, and his wife Princess Louise of Prussia. Prince Frederik of the Netherlands was the second son of King Willem I of the Netherlands and his wife, Wilhelmine of Prussia. Princess Louise of the Netherlands’ mother, also named Louise, was the eighth child of King Friedrich-Wilhelm III of Prussia and Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.\n\nPrincess Louise of the Netherlands\n\nFurther, Princess Louise of the Netherlands was a niece of King Willem II of the Netherlands through her father and niece of German Emperor Wilhelm I, through her mother.\n\nThe couple were personally quite dissimilar; Louise was a cultured and refined woman, however, she was considered to be quite plain and Crown Prince Carl was disappointed with her appearance. Louise was in love with her husband, whereas he preferred other women, saddening her deeply. His well-known mistresses included the actress Laura Bergnéhr, the countess Josephine Sparre, Wilhelmine Schröder and the actresses Hanna Styrell and Elise Hwasser, and the Crown Prince neglected his shy wife. On the other hand, his relationship to his only daughter, Louise, was warm and close.\n\nIn 1872, Carl XV had controversial plans to divorce Queen Louise and enter a non-morganatic marriage with the Polish countess Marya Krasińska through the assistance of Ohan Demirgian, plans that aroused opposition both in the royal house and government and which were interrupted only by his death.\n\nThe Crown Prince was Viceroy of Norway briefly in 1856 and 1857. In the 1850s, King Oscar I’s health began to rapidly deteriorate, becoming paralyzed in 1857. Crown Prince Carl became Regent on September 25, 1857, and king on the death of his father at the Royal Palace in Stockholm on July 8, 1859. As grandson of Augusta of Bavaria, he was a descendant of Gustaf I of Sweden and Carl IX of Sweden, whose blood returned to the throne after being lost in 1818 when Carl XIII of Sweden died.\n\nWhen he was Crown Prince, Carl’s’ brusque manner led many to regard his future accession with some apprehension, yet he proved to be one of the most popular of Scandinavian kings and a constitutional ruler in the best sense of the word. His reign was remarkable for its manifold and far-reaching reforms. Sweden’s existing municipal law (1862), ecclesiastical law (1863) and criminal law (1864) were enacted appropriately enough under the direction of a king whose motto was: Land skall med lag byggas – “With law shall the land be built”. Carl also helped Louis De Geer to carry through his reform of the Parliament of Sweden in 1866. He also declared the freedom of women by passing the law of legal majority for unmarried women in 1858 – his sister Princess Eugenie became the first woman who was declared mature.\n\nCarl XV, like his father Oscar I, was an advocate of Scandinavianism and the political solidarity of the three northern kingdoms, and his friendship with Frederik VII of Denmark, it is said, led him to give half promises of help to Denmark on the eve of the war of 1864, which, in the circumstances, were perhaps misleading and unjustifiable. In view, however, of the unpreparedness of the Swedish army and the difficulties of the situation, Carl XV was forced to observe a strict neutrality.\n\nHe died in Malmö on September 18, 1872. aged 46. He was followed on the thrones of both Norway and Sweden by his brother Oscar II.\n\nKing Oscar II of Sweden\n\nIssue\n\nBy his wife, Louise of the Netherlands, Carl had two children, a son, Prince Carl Oscar of Sweden, Duke of Södermanland who died in infancy and a daughter, Louise, who married the King Frederik VIII of Denmark. The early death of his only legitimate son meant that he was succeeded on the throne of Sweden by his younger brother Oscar II.\n\nPrince Carl Oscar of Sweden, Duke of Södermanland\n\nPrincess Louise of the Netherlands, Queen Consort of Denmark\n\nCarl XV also sired an illegitimate son, Carl Johan Bolander, (February 4, 1854 – July 28, 1903) and daughter, Ellen Svensson Hammar (October 28, 1865 – 1931) and it has been widely rumored that he had many more extramarital children.\n\nNo subsequent King of Sweden to this day is a descendant of King Carl XV. However, his descendants through his daughter Louise, are, or have been, on the thrones of Denmark, Luxembourg, Greece, Belgium and Norway.\n\nA few weeks before Carl XV’s death, his daughter Louise (then the Crown Princess of Denmark) gave birth to her second son. The young Prince of Denmark became christened as grandfather Carl XV’s namesake. In 1905 this grandson, Prince Carl of Denmark, ascended the throne of Norway, becoming thus his maternal grandfather’s successor in that country, and assumed the reign name Haakon VII. The present king, Harald V of Norway, is Carl XV’s great-great-grandson, through his father and mother."
