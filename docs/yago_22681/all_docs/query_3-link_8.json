        "text": "Carl (Haakon VII)\n\nKing of Norway from 1905. Son of Frederik VIII and Lovisa of Sweden-Norway. Married in 1896 to Princess Maud of Great Britain. They had one child.\n\nThe Dynasty – The Genealogical table room\n\nThe room functions for the visitor as an introduction to the museum and shows the Danish royal line.\n\nFour Kings, 1899\n\nOn the way to the antechamber one passes the so-called \"Four Kings Picture\", where the first four kings from the House of Glücksburg are gathered for the christening of Prince Frederik (IX).\n\nThe Fabergé Chamber\n\nOn display in the Fabergé Chamber is Russian jewellery from the period 1860-1917, with a focus on the close ties between the Danish and Russian monarchies. A selection of the Danish Crown Jewels will also be exhibited.\n\nFrederik VIII's study\n\nFrederik VIII's study was furnished in neorenaissance style, which characteristically refers to knightly themes. The room is intended to underline the House of Glücksburgs kinship to the House of Oldenburg.\n\nQueen Louise\n\nQueen Louise became queen in 1863. In 1842 she married Prince Christian (IX), and eventually became the first Royal Couple from the Glücksburg line after the childless Frederik VI.\n\nQueen Lovisa\n\nQueen of Denmark from 1906-1906. Born Princess of Sweden-Norway. Queen Lovisa spent most of her life as crown princess and didn't get along too well with her danish in-laws. She had eight children and was known to be well-read.\n\nFrederik IX\n\nKing of Denmark from 1947 and father of the current Danish monarch, HM Queen Margrethe II. Frederik IX was probably the most well-liked king of Denmark to this day and was among other things a skilled naval officer and classical conductor."
