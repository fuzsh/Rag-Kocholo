Louise of Sweden (Swedish: Lovisa Josefina Eugenia; 31 October 1851 â€“ 20 March 1926) was Queen of Denmark from 1906 until 1912 as the wife of King Frederick VIII. Born into the House of Bernadotte, Louise was the only surviving child of King Charles XV of Sweden and Norway and his consort, Louise of the Netherlands. Although her father made several attempts to have her recognized as his heir, she was barred from the succession as at the time only males could ascend the throne of Sweden. In 1869, she married the future King Frederick VIII of Denmark, with whom she had eight children . Read more on Wikipedia
