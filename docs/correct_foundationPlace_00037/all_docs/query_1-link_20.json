        "text": "Do you ever feel lost in a whirlpool of information when trying to search for data on a specific topic? Most search engines have no trouble locating information, but they often come back with so much information that it takes extensive time and effort to wade through it.\n\nPart of the problem with these search engines is that they are unintelligent and unable to filter through various meanings of words, so they come back with every reference to a particular word, regardless of its meaning. Unfortunately, this leaves many, if not most, users frustrated at the myriad results. Users have to have a pretty good idea of what they are looking for so the search engine can provide them with the appropriate results. But what if you are unsure of how to word your search? How can you narrow your search down to provide the results you want?\n\nWhile there are various content management apps on the market, a new breed of content management-enabled apps is quickly rising to the forefront as a quicker, easier way to get to the information you want. Very simply, a content management-enabled app is software that, through categorization or text mining, manages the content it provides. It is like a search engine, only better and more robust.\n\nHenry Morris, group vice president for applications and information access at IDC, Framingham, Mass., defines these content management-enabled apps as those that can leverage structure within documents. They are apps that look for information within and across documents, and then present all of their findings. ''They're using content below the level of just pointing you to a document or something [else],'' Morris noted.\n\nUsing categorization or text mining, these apps extract or identify concepts and meanings within documents. ''They're extracting concepts and relationships out of documents and setting up a presentation layer so you can see it in one view,'' he said. They are able to look at content at a granular level.\n\nBecause most search engines and information systems leave users frustrated with their inability to interact with information, Cambridge, Mass.-based Endeca Technologies Inc. set out to solve the problem of information access in late 1999. The company believes it is solving the information access problem through its Guided Navigation technology, which relies on the Endeca Navigation Engine.\n\n''We're trying to unlock the value of enterprise and catalog stores to present users with a new approach to finding information that's already within their enterprise,'' noted CTO David Gourley.\n\nEndeca's Navigation Engine functions as a data access layer; it takes information from relational databases, the Internet or e-commerce sites and presents it to users in such a way that they do not have to know the right question to get results. ''With Endeca, you start with results and narrow it down,'' Gourley explained. ''You have a dialog with the information that's stored.'' Through its Navigation Engine, Endeca is tying the search and navigation encounters together into one experience for its users.\n\nAs a provider of technical standards, specifications, logistics and parts information to corporations, Englewood, Colo.-based IHS Engineering was looking for a way to deliver content reliably in a 24x7 environment when it turned to Endeca. IHS wanted to standardize on one platform with the performance, scalability and flexibility to deliver all of its content through, as well as to reduce the number of dependencies it had with various vendors, said Paul Magin, vice president of technology and product development. ''We had acquired so much content across so many types of disciplines, and [we] had a half-dozen search technologies,'' he said.\n\nIHS has five applications running on five pipelines to the Endeca Navigation Engine. Its Aviation product provides air-worthiness information, while its Automotive Standards information app contains information from manufacturers specific to the automotive industry. The CatalogXpress app is a massive database of supplier content that includes catalogs to data sheets and specifications, and the Text Advantage app is a full-text search engine that searches all significant industry standard collections. The Techconnect client plug-in can run natively on Windows or in a browser, and analyzes content in focus on a user's monitor. ''It looks at what you're looking at and determines if anything you're looking at can be found in our content,'' Magin explained.\n\nAll of these apps are updated daily, except Text Advantage, which is updated every 90 days. In addition, the next phase of the project places another Endeca engine in front of these five. The sixth will work as a master engine that can locate references to specific things in all the apps. ''The user doesn't have to worry about where the data's located,'' noted Magin.\n\nWhen it began its search for a solution to deliver content reliably, IHS was looking for an engine that supported various types of media, including the Internet. Because some of its customers do not have Internet access, however, the company was forced to consider engines that could navigate through both Internet and CD-ROM data. Said Magin: ''The solutions that would serve both were too costly in developer resources and [meant] having to bend the product one way or the other,'' meaning more toward Internet or more toward CD-ROM.\n\nAfter evaluating firms and products for its next-generation search engine, IHS selected Endeca. ''We needed something slick, elegant, with not a lot of administrative burden and where results could be easily replicated,'' Magin said. In five to 10 days, Endeca was able to take IHS's data and turn it into a proof of concept. Endeca ''had better performance and better search functionality than some of our existing products because so much time was spent tuning the various back-end systems,'' he added.\n\nUsing Endeca's technology has resulted in an overall improved user experience, shorter time to market and increased simplicity for IHS. ''Performance is a tenfold increase for the same amount of traffic,'' Magin said, adding that the company had a lot more hardware before turning to Endeca. ''Because of the way we're applying Endeca refinement technology, we're able to take half-structured, half-unstructured content. It's difficult for a user to select an answer that doesn't produce a result. Before, the user had to evaluate the results.''\n\nIn addition, he said, ''Endeca makes it practical to do real-time refinement while you search. You're always in a forward motion while you're searching. It's lightning-fast under a heavy load.'' If you need to back up in your search, Magin said, you can do so without starting a new query.\n\nFinding the trees in the forest\n\nRonen Feldman, co-founder, president and chief scientist at ClearForest Corp., New York City, was looking for a way to get to the bottom line of information without having to do a lot of unnecessary reading along the way when he developed a text-mining technique in the early 1990s. That technique of reading text within documents is what makes ClearForest's technology work. ClearForest focuses on unstructured content and markets content management-enabled products to aid end users in avoiding unnecessary reading.\n\n''We're in the gold-digging business,'' explained Barak Pridor, CEO. The company's technology sifts through mounds of information to locate relevant nuggets. It goes a step further, however, by making those nuggets useful to its end users.\n\nAll of ClearForest's products use intelligent auto-tagging as their foundation. They go through each document and identify relevant entities, events and facts as determined by the end user. The products also utilize business intelligence to pinpoint relationships across documents. ClearResearch searches documents coming from multiple sources. ClearEvents monitors news feeds, tags relevant business events and attaches alerts about pertinent events. ClearSight provides a visual roadmap to navigate through data quickly and easily. ClearTags provides in-depth meta-tagging of textual data."
