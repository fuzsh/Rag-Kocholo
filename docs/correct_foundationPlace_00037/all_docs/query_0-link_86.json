Join us as we celebrate today's rising leaders.\n\nErik Adams\n\nPresident and CEO, Simplicity Laser, Inc. I Age: 39\n\nIn October 2009, Erik Adams took the helm of Simplicity Laser, Inc. and found himself leading a company that was in debt and under pressure to succeed with a flawed business model. He spent the next six months reorganizing the staff and refocusing the company with a new operating model.\n\nUnder Adams' leadership, Simplicity began promoting its laser hair removal memberships, which enable clients to immediately begin receiving treatments while paying a low monthly rate--instead of paying thousands upfront. The company also partnered with doctors who already owned laser equipment, which lowered costs for Simplicity even more.\n\n\"When we met, Simplicity was a struggling small business with many angry shareholders, several disappointed partners and a lot of doubt about its business model. Within months, Erik and his team ... created a successful company with large profit margins and a long list of excited potential investors and partners,\" says Mark Marshall, president and CEO of the Accend Group.\n\nBrent Andrewsen\n\nShareholder, Kirton McConkie | Age: 38\n\nBrent Andrewsen is committed to bettering the community in his personal and professional endeavors.

He is able to serve many nonprofits throughout the state by lending his tax and estate planning expertise to organizations such as the Community Foundation of Utah, the National Planned Giving Council and other organizations. Andrewsen also serves as the program chair for the nonprofit section of the Utah State Bar.\n\n\"It's really fun to have someone come in and say we have this great idea, we think we can solve this need either domestically or in a foreign country and then to be able to use my skills to help them accomplish that,\" he says.\n\nAndrewsen says he also enjoys helping people deal with the realities of estate planning. \"I enjoy sitting down with a family and hearing their concerns and then helping share with them that there are things that we can do together to achieve their objectives.\"\n\nPaul Belcher\n\nCo-owner, Mountain Crane Service | Age: 34\n\nAfter earning an MBA from Utah State University, Paul Belcher was approached with many employment offers--and declined them all. Belcher had always aspired to be an entrepreneur and wouldn't settle for anything less. He developed a business plan for Mountain Crane Service and was able to secure financing from family members to turn the plan into action. Over the course of five years, Belcher and partner, Lon Stam, were able to grow the company to more than $20 million in revenue. Today, Mountain Crane Service is the 37th largest crane company in the United States.\n\nBelcher says what he enjoys most about his position is seeing his company's work throughout the community. \"I have the opportunity to go out and see amazing things in the community that I've been part of,\" he says. \"I've been part of building the downtown City Creek project. I've been part of building the 1-15 freeway projects. We've been part of projects both small and huge.\"\n\n[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]\n\nBrian Bowers\n\nChief Operating Officer, Mity-Lite | Age: 37\n\nAs chief operating officer for Mity-Lite, Brian Bowers has infused his team of nearly 200 employees with a spirit of competition that has enabled the company to bring products back to the United States for manufacturing in Utah. \"Every day I come to work, and we're in competition--we're a manufacturing facility and we're competing against Asian outsource [companies] and we're trying to do our very best to be competitive,\" he says.\n\nBowers oversees two manufacturing facilities, logistics, warehouse operations, engineering and the supply chain. Through his leadership, the company has increased its productivity by more than 100 percent, reducing labor costs from 13.9 percent of sales to about 9 percent of sales.\n\nAs a mentor and coach to his employees, Bowers establishes meaningful goals and rewards that inspire employees to stretch themselves, resulting in a significant impact on the company's overall performance. Through his reward-for-performance plan, production employee base compensation has increased by 22 percent and incentive compensation has increased by 300 percent.\n\nSam Bruni\n\nGeneral Manager and Acting Director of Customer Experience, Backcountry.com | Age: 36\n\nBuilding on a history of success, Sam Bruni is now guiding the complex world at Backcountry.com.

She has served in the private banking department and as director of regional credit in the resort banking division. And just last month, she was promoted to president of Zions Bank's mortgage division, where she now oversees all aspects of the bank's residential lending.\n\nCasaday took on a particularly difficult challenge for the bank when she worked in its special assets division from April 2009 to February 2010. In this role, she managed a complex portfolio of substandard leases, real estate, commercial, construction and SBA loans. With her knowledge and experience, Casaday was able to formulate and implement strategies to maximize bank returns and minimize loss.\n\n\"[It] is the collection of my challenges that has molded me into who I am today. I am grateful for each one of them--great or small--because they allow me the opportunity to recognize areas in need of refining,\" she says.\n\nJoel Clark\n\nPresident, Kodiak Cakes | Age: 37\n\nJoel Clark always had his sights set on owning his own business. In his early adulthood, Clark joined a consulting firm with one goal in mind: save enough money to start his own company. At age 23, Clark took over Kodiak Cakes, while still working full-time at the firm. It took years of work and dedication before Clark was able to quit the consulting firm and devote himself fully to his company.\n\n\"Although I wanted to throw in the towel as an entrepreneur many times through the years, I think my biggest professional accomplishment is that I actually stuck with Kodiak Cakes on a bootstrap budget, while working other jobs in the beginning, with no significant outside investment, for over 14 years now,\" says Clark.\n\nClark says success often comes down to hard work. \"I went from being temporarily kicked off the football team in high school because of poor grades to graduating Magna Cum Laude at the U in economics, then to Oxford University for an MBA. I think it's a lot more about working hard.\"\n\nNicole Cottle\n\nDeputy City Manager, Government Relations, Community and Economic Development; West Valley City | Age: 38\n\n\"I absolutely enjoy being told over and over again that something cannot be accomplished or that something will never happen in West Valley City,\" says Nicole Cottle. \"I savor the opportunity to accomplish the impossible.\"\n\nUnder her direction, the city is experiencing its most aggressive economic development period ever. Projects include the Valley Fair Mall expansion, new public transportation systems and the $500 million Fairbourne Station. \"This effort has not been without hurdles. However, I am proud to say that real construction is occurring and the city is enjoying a tremendous increase in its economic development as a result of this work.\"\n\nCottle wears many hats in West Valley, the state's second-largest city. As the city's lobbyist, she has garnered millions of dollars for economic development, infrastructure and capital improvement projects. During her time as deputy city attorney, she spearheaded the acquisition of several major developments.

Davidson played an integral role in the company's acquisition of Morris Murdock Business Travel. Aside from the financials, Davidson says the purchase was challenging because it also involved helping the new employees become a part of the company's culture and demonstrating commitment to new customers.\n\nDavidson says he enjoys involving Hess Travel in community causes like the Susan G.

But now, in his spare time, hiking with his children is his favorite escape.\n\nNichole Adams Dunn\n\nDeputy Mayor to Peter M, Corroon, Salt Lake County | Age: 38\n\nNichole Adams Dunn got involved in politics 10 years ago and never looked back.

While he mostly blames himself, he graduated high school without understanding how to write, having never read a book cover to cover, and with no ability to apply scientific and mathematic concepts in the real world.\n\nHe worked hard to overcome his late start and began his first career in public education as a high school economics teacher and sports coach, eventually becoming a principal. While he was helping educate students, Kaufman kept working on his own education, eventually earning a bachelor's, two master's and a doctoral degree.

Tens of thousands of customers rely on Locke's team each day to ensure systems are up and running, providing uninterrupted communication opportunities.\n\nBart Miller\n\nSVP Sales, GOAL ZERO | Age: 39\n\nAt 10 years old, Bart Miller got caught rummaging through neighbors' cars for spare change. His grandpa was worried about Miller's direction in life, and helped his grandson start a lawn mowing business. He's working with bigger chunks of change these days.\n\nMiller was hired as COO and CFO at GOAL ZERO, but after the entire executive team focused on revenue qrowth in the last 18 months, Miller says he discovered a passion for sales and transitioned to head of the sales team.\n\nGOAL ZERO started 2011 with a $5 million revenue plan--a 500 percent growth goal over 2010.

Within three months of starting as SVP of sales, GOAL ZERO saw the largest sales increase in the company's history and set several sales records.\n\nAlan Martin\n\nFounder and CEO, CampusBookRentals.com | Age: 32\n\nWhile a student at Weber State University, Alan Martin devised a textbook rental plan that has revolutionized the textbook industry. \"We rent textbooks to college students as a low cost alternative to buying,\" says Martin. \"Typical savings are 55 to 65 percent, which translates to as much as $600 dollars per year for a full-time student.\"\n\nThe company is a win-win for colleges and universities, too. \"We provide white label rental technology to on-campus bookstores, enabling them to rent their own textbooks right off their shelves,\" he says. Because of its innovative practices, CampusBookRentals.com was recently named one of Forbes' Americas Most Promising Companies.\n\nLike most entrepreneurs, Martin has faced many hurdles along the way. \"On August 27th, 2010, on our then biggest day in company history, our primary textbook supplier shut down, leaving approximately 6,000 customers without books that we had promised to deliver ... the situation felt desperate.\" Martin and his team worked nonstop for 72 hours and solved the problem. \"It was a tremendous learning and growth opportunity and experience for our entire organization.\"\n\nMark A. Miller\n\nPartner, Holland & Hart LLP | Age: 38\n\nAs a patent attorney, Mark Miller gets the opportunity to learn about new technology with each new client. He says helping companies protect ideas they've worked hard to develop is exciting, because he develops a passion for the businesses and innovations he helps protect. Miller's hard work has paid off. Along with his mentor, Brett Foster, Miller has successfully helped several Utah companies enforce their patent rights and stop competitor infringement.\n\nOne of his most notable victories came when Miller served as second chair to Foster during a 10-day trial enforcing commercial blending technology. The Utah company won and was awarded a $24 million settlement--the largest patent infringement judgment in Utah history.\n\nWhen his father and brother died within a year of each other, Miller says the tragedy helped remind him of the importance of relationships and family. \"Life is about people and I try not to lose sight of that in my practice,\" he says.\n\nBrett Mills\n\nManager and Senior Loan Officer Academy Mortgage Corporation | Age; 34\n\nAs a manager and senior loan officer at Academy Mortgage Corporation, Brett Mills knows what an uncertain future is like. In 2007, Mills made the decision to move away from his then partners and start his own branch of Academy Mortgage. The wheels were in motion for the transition when the mortgage market collapsed.\n\nMills says he had several sleepless nights, but finally decided to trust that he had planned a solid business with strong fundamentals. He was later recognized as the top mortgage originator in Utah and among the top 200 in the nation.\n\nIn addition to running a successful company, Mills is very involved in the community and professional organizations.
