Both his father and uncle were Prime Minister. When his father died he became the youngest MP in Malaysia’s history in 1976, and has since held many major ministerial portfolios. When he became Prime Minister on 3 April 2009, critics called him the ultimate insider. But he has taken many by surprise, implementing the most far-reaching political and economic reforms since Malaysia’s independence. The Prime Minister has, for example: repealed the colonial-era Internal Security Act, which permitted indefinite detention without trial; ended Malaysia’s 60-year State of Emergency; introduced measures to increase media freedom, such as scrapping restrictions on newspaper publishing licenses; reformed the Universities and University Colleges Act to allow undergraduates to participate in political activities; created the Peaceful Assembly Act, for the first time enshrining in law the right to peaceful protest; announced the repeal of the Sedition Act to strengthen freedom of speech; repealed the Banishment Act; repealed the Restricted Residences Act; and implemented various electoral reforms. His Government Transformation Programme has fundamentally changed the provision of government services – improving education, widening access to healthcare, developing rural infrastructure, expanding public transport, reducing poverty, cutting crime and corruption and bringing down the cost of living. Alongside this, his Economic Transformation Programme has significantly liberalised the economy – creating more than 300,000 jobs, raising living standards, encouraging foreign investment and turning Malaysia into one of Asia’s most dynamic and successful economies. The Prime Minister has also introduced the ‘1Malaysia’ concept, stressing the importance of national unity regardless of race or religious belief. In terms of foreign policy, the Prime Minister has called for a new global Movement of the Moderates to combat extremism, attracting support from President Barack Obama and Prime Minister David Cameron, among others.

Islam Hadhari espouses ten fundamental principles which were accepted by Muslims and non-Muslims alike. Abdullah focused on human capital development as a key pillar of his Administration.

Science and technology was further promoted, while innovation and creativity was pushed to the fore. As Chairman of the OIC, Abdullah waged a war against poverty and the lack of knowledge and development in the Muslim world. Besides emphasising the enhancement of education in OIC countries, Malaysia sought to share its experience in national economy development by initiating a series of self-help projects involving OIC Members and the Islamic Development Bank with the objective of increasing capacities in several poor member countries of the OIC. The immediate purpose was to generate income and provide employment, while the longer-term intention was to assist the OIC countries upgrade their governance and development efforts. Abdullah also sought to provide an economic face to the OIC, in a bid to enhance trade, business and investment linkages between Member countries. The World Islamic Economic Forum (WIEF), of which Abdullah is the founder patron, continues to be an important gathering of government and business leaders from the Muslim world and beyond.
