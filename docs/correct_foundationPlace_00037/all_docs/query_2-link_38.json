Know any of these people?\n\nHere’s the university’s official list, with job titles, locales, and other context following each person’s name:\n\nWilliam D. Armstrong, president and owner of Armstrong Oil and Gas, Denver\n\nRichie L. Butler, business leader and founding senior pastor of Union Cathedral, Dallas\n\nJeanne Tower Cox, civic and philanthropic leader, Dallas (previously served on the board from 1996 to 2008)\n\nKatherine Raymond Crow, civic and philanthropic leader, Dallas\n\nAntoine L.V. Dijkstra, partner and co-founder of Implexus Capital & Partners, The Netherlands\n\nBishop James E. Dorff, San Antonio Episcopal Area of The United Methodist Church, San Antonio (replaced a retiring trustee in spring)\n\nLarry R. Faulkner, president-emeritus at UT-Austin and retired president of Houston Endowment, Inc., Austin and Houston\n\nBishop Michael McKee, North Texas Conference of The United Methodist Church, Dallas\n\nScott J. McLean, chief executive officer of Amergy Amegy Bank of Texas, Houston (previously served on the board from 1996 to 1997 representing the SMU Alumni Board)\n\nConnie Blass O’Neill, civic and philanthropic leader, Dallas (previously served on the board from 2007 to 2009 representing the SMU Alumni Board.\n\nRichard Ware, president of Amarillo National Bank, Amarillo (previously served on the board from 1980 to 1992 and from 1994 to 2008)\n\nYou have to wonder if the sole, brave Dutch person on this list plans to commute to the board’s quarterly meetings — or if maybe he lives in Dallas at least part-time, as some quick Googling would suggest. Anyway, the next one is Dec. 6 and 7.\n\nIn other official business, Caren Prothro was re-elected as chair in July, Robert Dedman Jr. is serving as vice chair, and David Miller is the board’s secretary. Michael Boone has been named chair-elect, set to replace Prothro in June, 2014.\n\nSMU re-elected the following trustees (including Prothro, Dedman, Miller, and Boone, obviously) this summer, and they’ll have their seats until at least 2016:"
