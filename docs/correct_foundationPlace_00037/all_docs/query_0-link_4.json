GROW YOUR COMPANY IN A DOWNTURN Capitalize on Hidden Opportunities Your Customers Provide More than ever, companies are focused on their existing customers to drive business value. During challenging economic times these customers and their continued loyalty is the lifeline for survival. The necessity of effectively and proactively serving your existing customers is a tremendous opportunity for both savings and growth. The old metric that talks about taking less money to keep a current customer than to get a new one is not only true — but a key part in allowing companies to maintain a customer base without spending excessively. Not only do your current top customers tend to represent the largest chunk of your revenue, but their loyalty and positive word of mouth represent your future growth. The place to make your modest investments with the strongest ROI this year is in your current customers. In a tight economy there are two critical things that these investments can enable: • Revenue preservation — find out if customers are going to leave, understand why and save them; and • Revenue growth — understand if customers are having issues (\"cries for help\") and delight them by acting on those issues. This generates amazing word of mouth, builds a network of customer advocates and creates growth.
