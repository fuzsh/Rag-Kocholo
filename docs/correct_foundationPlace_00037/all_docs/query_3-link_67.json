By Shane Kite Pontiac's new 2006 GTO turned quite a few heads on Manhattan streets during an autumn road test. Rolling slowly through city traffic, the 2006 GTO garnered exultations from Park Avenue to the East Village to Gramercy Park. Granted, the attention may have stemmed from the paint job: a bright, canary-colored Yellow Jacket finish that shone like the sun. Still, gawkers included a father and son; a pair of young, downtown Friday-night revelers — \"Check it out, new GTO… new GTO!,\" an Australian, named Martin, who snapped pictures of the car with his cell phone; and a burly hardhat who gave a thumbs-up as we passed. The experience seemed to counter criticism Pontiac has faced in trying to reclaim the GTO's storied past: that, while it's still a blast to drive, it lacks curb appeal. Since being reintroduced in 2004, the new Pontiac GTO has garnered praise for outstanding power and handling, but elicited boos for its conservative — some say uninspired — modern design. To some, it's a racecar stuck in a bourgeois body. Actually, it's a brawny 6.0-liter LS2 V8 — the same engine that powers the Corvette — housed in the frame of a Monaro, an Australian rear-wheel drive model from Holden, a subsidiary of GM, Pontiac's owner. A vivacious engine and dynamic performance are clearly the main draws. The LS2's 400 pound-feet of torque and 400 horses make it the most powerful GTO ever built. Ravenous and raring to go, this car is fast. But unlike the original GTO, which could only go fast in a straight line because of a crude suspension typical of '50s and '60s muscle cars, the latest incarnation has responsive and precise handling. Some may find the stealth factor — of owning big power in an unassuming package — appealing, keeping in mind that color choice can go a long way in lifting the car's profile. Still, others might desire a more novel aesthetic. Take note though, the new GTO gets parched rather quickly and requires premium fuel for optimum performance. We averaged well under the estimated 17 miles per gallon in the city and 25 mpg on the highway. Still, the essence of the car — its fun and performance — with an engine that emits a deeply satisfying hot-rod rumble, did not disappoint. http://www.forbesautos.com/reviews/2006/pontiac/gto/testdrive_print.htmlGo FEB MAR 12 2005 2006 8 captures 12 Mar 06 - 13 Jan 08\n\n3. + enlarge image | view gallery > + enlarge image | view gallery > + enlarge image | view gallery > + enlarge image | view gallery > Exterior The GTO's smoothed-over minimalism bares little resemblance to its husky, carburetor-fed predecessor. Modern lines and a forward-leaning stance, while not displeasing, don't go far to distinguish the GTO from other American coupe designs. In profile, it can look a lot like a rounder Acura or even a Ford Tempo. Its exterior design also stands in complete contretemps to the retro-styling of better-looking main rivals Ford Mustang and Dodge Charger. Again, depending on the color, though, the car can be hard to miss. Brazen Orange Metallic or Spice Red, added for 2006, join a host of sleek-looking blacks, blues and grays. Seats can be had in colored leather, as well. A split-vent front gives the GTO its Pontiac boilerplate, while diminutive circular fog lamps set underneath the headlights lend a condition-ready game face. Two raised scoops atop the hood allude to the mile-eating menace underneath, while a rear spoiler slopes tightly over the back end, anchoring a sporty demeanor. The dual-exhaust system's two polished pipes tucked under the rear fascia seem to be the only stylistic flourish reminiscent of yore. Interior The GTO's inside is clean, sleek and neatly designed, though just as unremarkable as the exterior. It does offer intuitive controls for ventilation and stereo, and the roomy center-console storage fits 12 disks to reload the in-dash six-disk CD changer. Powered by a booming 200-watt, 10-speaker AM/FM Blaupunkt, which comes standard, a low-end boosting button on the stereo will trigger car alarms and make the kids — and the kid in you — smile. Black leather adorns the seats, steering wheel and gear shifter amid satin-nickel trim, while stitching on the gear-shift cover and steering wheel matches the exterior paint. Trip-specific, customizable digital readouts under the main dials provide average speed, gas mileage, distance covered and a \"rest reminder\" after two hours of travel. Mute and volume controls are conveniently placed on the steering wheel and cruise control comes standard. An automatic alert beeps and flashes on the dash when the car is moved with the emergency brake on. The few interior grievances are less annoying than they are plain odd: To open the smallish trunk without using the keyfob, one must reach inside the glove box and press a button — there's no keyhole on the trunk lid to unlock it the old-fashioned way. Also, the rear spoiler further obstructs already narrow site lines out the back window through the rearview mirror, though I found it easy to acclimate. Performance Bottom line, this car is a pleasure to drive. Amply fulfilling the need for speed, and right out of the gate, the GTO will appeal to the carefree youth in you. Yet, neither punchy nor wild, never once did I feel out of control of matters, whether driving in the city, passing cars on the Long Island Expressway (which the GTO did with gusto) or taking curves at speed. The Tremec six-speed manual transmission is the obvious must-have option for performance enthusiasts, offering more and better control over the engine than the standard automatic. Downshifting the manual gearbox is a seamless, easy delight — which says a lot for someone who hasn't driven a stick shift in seven years. It was almost as fun as tacking up into sixth gear. Attesting to a fine-tuned engine and gear ratios, the car also lacks the chomping-at-the-bit, anxious quality that past big-engine six-speeders exhibit at slow speeds. It maneuvered like a much smaller vehicle in the city, seeming to pivot almost from the center when a tight turn was called for, which also made parallel parking a snap. The car showed exceptional agility and precision, very much holding its own with the other brand names on the Montauk Highway, a stretch of road on eastern Long Island never lacking in high-end performance cars. Punch the gas and the GTO responds like a rocket: few are likely immune to the allure and fun of bursting forward at a stoplight gone green, leaving the other cars in the dust. With an ability to reach 60 mph from zero in 4.7 seconds (besting both the Mustang and Charger), you'll put more recognizable speedsters in the rearview mirror, easily.\n\n4. rearview mirror, easily. Is The GTO For You? Buy This Vehicle If You want to sate your muscle-car jones and tap the carefree kid inside; you relish a good secret or like watching higher profile sports cars diminish in your rearview mirror; you're a diehard fan of the original GTO. Keep Looking If You want to save at the pump or desire more bling for your buck; the roads you drive don't allow the opportunity to explore this car's high performance threshold; you'd like something better for fuel economy, in which case a coupe with a six-cylinder engine is a better choice. Who Fits? The GTO offers a comfortable ride for just about any frame. The eight-way power adjustable front seats with manual lumbar support and tilting steering wheel allow a high-degree of customizable precision for drivers. Altogether, it allowed this 5-foot-5 reviewer to get close enough to the pedals to comfortably engage the clutch, brake and accelerator, yet still affect a reclined (I think cool) pose. With more than 37 inches of headroom throughout and an equally ample amount of rear leg space, it seats four adults of average height comfortably. Options Worth Splurging On The Tremec six-speed manual transmission ($695), a must for the performance-minded; and perhaps the 18-inch alloy wheels ($495). Choose Yellow Jacket or Torrid Red exterior paint for more flash. Closest Competitors Chevrolet Corvette Chrysler Crossfire SRT6 Dodge Charger Ford Mustang Did You Know? The GTO acronym was taken from Ferrari. The Italians had tagged the \"Gran Tourismo Omologato\" moniker on certain models that were modified to fit their standards for international racing, or the \"Grand Touring\" class. Pontiac thought its radical coupe fit the bill. 1964 Pontiac GTO First released in 1964, its hammerhead body and souped-up engine jump-started the muscle-car craze: Many consider the GTO the first such hot rod. And it was wildly successful. Pontiac sold more than 90,000 in 1966."
