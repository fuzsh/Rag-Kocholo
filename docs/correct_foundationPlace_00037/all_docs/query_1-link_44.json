These include developing computational models and simulations to better understand terrorist recruitment and behavior (\"Seldon\"), creating a network of experts to share knowledge about terrorism issues (\"Knownet\"), and exploring novel human-machine collaboration systems using physiological sensors (\"Mentor/Pal\"). The goal is to improve understanding of terrorism as a complex adaptive system and develop new tools to help mitigate related threats.\n\nAcg Terr Sand2004 2130w\n\n1. Advanced Concepts Group War on Terrorism Activities http:// www.sandia.gov/capabilitites/acg/index.html Presentation to DHS TV/TA Committee Nancy K. Hayden April 23, 2004 SAND2004-2130W Unclassified Unlimited Release Sandia is a multiprogram laboratory operated by Sandia Corporation, a Lockheed Martin Company, for the United States Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.\n\n2. Terrorism: It’s About People Poor economic conditions and low human Capital Development in Arab world will continue Cultural Histories, ethnic tensions, hate, superstition, conspiracy…will continue to expound victimization narratives Role of US/Israel as crusaders against backdrop of changing balance of powers (EU, Asia,..) Fundamental religious movements will continue to foster rebellion against modernism Samuel Huntington The Clash of Civilizations\n\n3. Terrorism is a Complex Problem Knowledge Network The key is to better understand the future—plan to change it, and change it Logistics/ Infrastructure Social/ psychological Simulation Multidimensional Games Red, Blue, Green White, Purple MOADB indications & warnings increase hope warn first responders manipulate - deceive - control - dissuade - deter - destroy enhanced collection scenario driven hypothesis smart decision making individuals and groups mitigate Reality\n\n4. Complexity Science Yields New Analysis Paradigms Intrinsic network features transcend domains Santa Fe Institute Workshop April 10-11, 2003 How Complex Adaptive Systems Dynamics are Related to Understanding and Modeling Terrorist Behavior Sandia, Argonne, LANL, CIA, DTRA, MITRE, Navy Cornell, U of Penn, Intel, CMU, Icosystems, USAF, Galisteo, Humana, Alidade, U of Maryland, MIIS, Brookings\n\n5. Systems Thinking: Frame the Problem Predict Analysis Function Timeframe System Complexity Describe Explore Interpret Infer Suggest Modeling approaches depend on what problem is being addressed\n\n6. The Advanced Concepts Group Dotology The application of red gaming and computer reasoning tools to the generation of terrorism hypotheses Knownet The creation of a virtual community of terrorism experts to share and create knowledge Seldon The development of computational sociopsychological models to better understand the complex behaviors of terrorist organizations. Mentor/Pal The study of novel human-machine systems using physiological monitors to enable superior group performance SDAC Sense/decide/act/communicate devices that create inexpensive, self organizing systems for detection and reaction\n\n7. Partners: KDD program within ITIC LDRD team in 5500 and 5900 This year: Hold another game or two in ’04 LDRD to build prototype Hypothesizer Transition concept to intel community with support from 5500 and 5900. Dotology team: Rick Craft, Judy Moore, John Whitley Problem and Approach Accomplishments and Current Work The Future of This Concept Improve our nation’s ability to &quot;connect the dots&quot; to allow interdiction prior to an terrorist event. Creation of a national “red gaming” capability to generate and collect hypothetical scenarios and the creation of a data warehouse that would store these scenarios and fragments, in a computer manipulatible format at the level of “observable” events. Design of a tool, the “Hypothesizer”, calling on the data warehouse to expand the view of analysts for what might be unfolding and to eliminate spurious “dots” inconsistent with reasonable scenarios. IWFO project with KDD (part of ITIC) Red Game held in July 2003 LDRD to develop data structures for data warehouse White paper on Red Teaming for Homeland Security White paper on a National Counter Terrorism Univ. The Science of Connecting the Dots\n\n8. A Recurrent Need The need to “know” the terrorist has emerged repeatedly in the concepts that the ACG has explored Control Dangerous Things Control Bad Actors rists Enable Dynamic Mitigation Support Apprehension & Prosecution Strengthen Emergency Response Know Ourselves, the Threat, & the Current Situation Resources Targets & Public & Private Responders Harden Critical Resources Terr o\n\n9. Problem The nation needs to develop deep and comprehensive knowledge of terrorism and make this knowledge accessible where it is needed, when it is needed, and in the form needed. Approach Create a (inter-)national network that provides insight on short and long-term terrorist-related issues using experts who are fed with high-grade source information and supported by an infrastructure that enables communication, analysis, and collaboration. SFI workshop explored terrorism as complex system behavior with experts KnowNet white paper explains ACG concept KnowFest started building a functioning community of very diverse experts (Mini-Net) KnowNet Pilot Current Work Nurture Mini-Net collaborations Community white paper on Know Net Pursue DHS Interest in S&T (Gary Strong) Collaborate with DTRA/DHS to develop KnowNet implementation options LDRD for Rapid Knowledge Generation to support other SNL/DHS terrorism work Transition KnowNet program to SNL line organizations Team Members : Nancy Hayden , Rick Craft External Partners : St. Andrews, GWU, MIIS, MITRE, Tel Aviv University, U of Penn, U of Michigan, IDSS, RAND Accomplishments The Future\n\n10. Knownet Toolbox Provide COTS/USG information visualization and analysis tools VxInsight: landscape views Starlight suite : network and context analyses ClearForest: concept and link analyses Attensity : syntactic and semantic freeform text analysis, discivers entities and relationships Incorporate Rapid Knowledge Generation middleware Access to scenarios and behavior simulation models\n\n11.

SELDON - Computational Simulation of Social Tipping Points Prototype agent-based model of recruitment within multiple social networks. Preliminary results confirm strong role of social networks Gang-terrorist analogy paper Partners: Nina Berry (8964), Teresa Ko (8964), Ann Speed (12335), and Professor Kathleen Carley (Carnegie Melon University) Team: Tim Moy, Julienne Smrcka, Jessica Turnley, and Ben Wu (POC) Future Path: Model middle east terrorists Develop transition plan to line organization. Problem and Approach Accomplishments and Current Work The Future of This Concept Problem: improve our understanding of the factors and processes that lead to the emergence and persistence of terrorists Research question: how do we intervene in the recruitment pipeline so groups do not achieve size and structure necessary to support violent behavior? Approach: develop a computational psycho-social model that allows us to play ‘what if’ games with interventions in the recruitment pipeline to identify those which will preclude the development of a group structure that will lead to violence\n\n13.
