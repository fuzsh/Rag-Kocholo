WEST This is the tenth year in which the Research Information Service has compiled the information concerning doctorates conferred in the sciences by American universities. Statistics before ~g~g-~o are those taken from reports of other compilers. It is interesting to see the steady increase in the number of doctorates each year from 330 in 1919-20 to 1025 in 19~8-~9. In the first list compiled by the Research Information Service thirty-one universities reported. In the present list there are sixty-one universities.

In many cases the information for previous years was not given, so that the statistics for these are not complete. The list of subjects has been kept as it was in order that the statistics might have some comparative value. It has been necessary, however, to add Public Health, as scattering the theses of Doctors of Public Health throughout the compilation gave no indication of the work in this field. The Registrars and Deans of the universities have cooperated in a most gracious way, and the Research Information Service wishes to express appreciation at this time. Since ~926 the compilations have appeared in the Reprint and Cir- cular Series of the National Research Council (Numbers 75? 80 and 86~. Before that time they were published in Science and in School and Society.
