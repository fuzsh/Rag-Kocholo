Abraham Lincoln was one. Stephen A. Douglas was another. Their mutual friend and colleague, John Calhoun, was a third. Calhoun has appeared in the biographies of Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas primarily as a walk-on character. Calhoun shows up, for example, early in young Lincoln’s life when he provides the young New Salem resident with a much-needed job. The role he played in Lincoln’s life over two and a half decades was more substantial and would prove much more important. Calhoun, for example, shows up in Douglas’s life a few years later when he pushes the Little Giant to run for Congress.\n\n“The ambitions of Stephen A. Douglas and Abraham Lincoln ran in parallel lines,” wrote Illinois historian Charles A. Church. “Each was the incarnation of the principles he espoused. They were the two poles of the political thought of their time, as Hamilton and Jefferson had been in the days of the fathers. Douglas, as an audacious and ready debater, has never been surpassed in either branch of congress. He had a personal magnetism which made him a popular idol and a born leader of men. He was self-confident and even arrogant, and was withal a dangerous antagonist.”1 Lincoln spent more than two decades studying his opponent and knew how to handle him by the time Lincoln faced the senator in the Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858.\n\nThe political ambitions of Douglas, Lincoln, and Calhoun were often in conflict and would intersect in 1858 in a way that would lead to the Civil War. Compared to Douglas, John Calhoun was a more dangerous and more closely reasoned, antagonist in Lincoln’s eyes. Lincoln’s own fortunes sometimes ran diametrically opposite to those of Calhoun and often of Douglas as well. Lincoln’s career as a village merchant collapsed in 1833, burying him in debt. Through the intervention of a mutual friend, then Sangamon County surveyor Calhoun agreed to give Lincoln a much-needed job. Calhoun’s later misdeeds as a federal appointee in Kansas gave Lincoln a much-needed and thoroughly unintended boost toward the presidential election in 1860. Simultaneously, they injured Douglas’ own chances to win a united Democratic nomination for the presidency.\n\nStill, Lincoln never forgot Calhoun’s early help nor held against Calhoun his later political transgressions. Lincoln’s contemporaries were less kind to Calhoun. Lincoln’s principal wartime aides and biographers called Calhoun “one of the most able and unscrupulous leaders in the pro-slavery cabal” in Kansas in the mid-1850s and referred to his leadership as the “Calhoun dictatorship.”2 Even these critics, however, acknowledged Calhoun as a “man of considerable professional and political talent.”3 The authors of an early Illinois history wrote that Calhoun had “few equals in point of ability, but he lacked energy and was the slave of the cup.”4\n\nLincoln, Douglas and Calhoun men sharpened their rhetorical swords in the new Illinois capital of Springfield. Lincoln helped move the legislation that made Springfield a “city” in 1839 – although an 1835 census showed only 1419 people resided in the community. From 1839 to 1840, Lincoln served briefly as a town trustee, helping guide Springfield’s transition to a new form of municipal government. It was typical of the closely intertwined Springfield scene in those days that the man Lincoln replaced as trustee, Samuel H. Treat, became the judge of the Eighth Judicial Circuit on which he practiced, would later become a State Supreme Court Justice before whom Lincoln practiced, and still later become a U.S. District Court judge before whom Lincoln practiced. And when he was not appearing before Judge Treat, Lincoln could often be found playing chess with him – or telling stories to the judge and Lincoln’s fellow lawyers. It was Treat who made the underemployed Calhoun the clerk of his court for several years in the 1840s.\n\nSuch was the small pond of Springfield in which many future big fish swam. Sometimes, these fish took decades to emerge as congressman, generals, governors, and senators, but in the stormy seas of the Civil War, they did emerge. In 1838, when Douglas was just 25, he effectively stole the congressional nomination from the Democratic incumbent and faced off against Whig John Todd Stuart, the law partner of Abraham Lincoln and cousin of Lincoln’s future wife. After Stuart, Lincoln, Douglas and their colleagues ended their spring swing around the Eighth Judicial District, Stuart and Douglas embarked on a series of joint appearances across the vast, 34-county congressional district in northern Illinois.\n\nOne contemporary recalled that Stuart and Douglas “often occup[ied] the same bed during their travels around the country.”5 At one tavern in Hancock County, the only room was already booked. Twenty-one-year-old John M. Palmer – future state legislator, general, and Illinois governor and U.S. senator – was peddling clocks in the area with a colleague and secured the room’s two beds. The proprietor of the tavern indicated that Douglas and Stuart would have to share the beds with Palmer and his friend. Douglas demanded of the pedlars to divulge were their politics. When Douglas found that Palmer was a Democrat and his colleague a Whig, Douglas decided the sleeping arrangements: “Then, Stuart, I’ll sleep with the Democrat and you may sleep with the Whig.”6 Douglas and Palmer would become good friends, but about 16 years later, Palmer broke with Douglas and become a strong supporter of Lincoln and the Republican Party.\n\nBefore the 1838 campaign even began, Lincoln, writing under pseudonym, accused Douglas engaging in a deal to get a federal job and then being persuaded of another deal to give up his federal job to run for Congress. On the evening of the publication of these charges, Lincoln made a speech which, while seemingly allegorical, can be interpreted as suggesting that Douglas was a dangerous reincarnation of Napoleon. Douglas was incensed by the anonymous newspaper accusation and demanded that the writer of these accusations reveal himself. He wrote: “Conscious of my own innocence, and the rectitude of my conduct, I am desirous that the curtain should be raised, and every act of my life exposed to the searching eye of public scrutiny. I also desire to drag my accusers from their hiding places, to strip off the mask that conceals their names from the public eye, give them an opportunity of maintaining their assertions, or let them cover themselves with infamy, which is the certain reward of the midnight assassin, and foul mouthed slanderer.”7 By the standards of this exchange, the Lincoln-Douglas debates two decades later were tame affairs indeed. In those 1858 exchanges, Douglas would accuse Lincoln of making a deal for the Republican nomination with Lyman Trumbull, who had been elected senator over Lincoln in 1855. Charges and denials of deals seem to have been built into the Lincoln-Douglas relationship from its inception.\n\nWhen in late 1839 four Democrats and four Whigs were chosen to debate national economic issues in Springfield, they included three future U.S. senators, one future President, and John Calhoun.8 As Mary Todd Lincoln would later remember, “In our little coterie in Springfield in the days of my girlhood, we had a society of gentlemen, who have since, been distinguished, in a greater or less degree, in the political world. My great and glorious husband come first, ‘a world above them all.’ Douglas, Trumbull, Baker, Hardin, Shields, such choice spirits were the habituÃ©s of our drawing room.”9 Of Douglas who briefly courted her, Mary would say: “Mr. Douglas is a very little, little giant by the side of my tall Kentuckian, and intellectually my husband towers above Douglas just as he does physically.”10\n\nThe married Calhoun was not part of this group of young bachelors. And unlike Douglas, who made his political base in Jacksonville, then Quincy, and later Chicago, Calhoun lived and labored in Sangamon County, one of the few areas that Whigs dominated in the 1830s and 1840s. John Calhoun had the makings of one of the big fish who never quite made it. Sangamon County historian John Carroll Power generously described Calhoun as “a man of genial, hopeful, generous temperament; ever ready to serve or defend a friend, but rarely defending himself, except on the spur of the moment; of great, ability, and for a time was the best political orator in the State of Illinois. He was brilliant, but deficient in practical application.”11 Like Douglas, Calhoun was an accomplished and persuasive speaker. He was, wrote one Douglas biographer, “one of the ablest men in the party.”12 He was ambitious but lazy. As historian Robert W. Johannsen wrote, Calhoun “always remained a second-rate politician.”13 Johannsen contended: “Political success did not come easy for him, partly, perhaps, because he was a Democrat running for office in a predominantly Whig district, but also because he lacked the ability to stir the public imagination. He held more appointive positions than he did elective offices; he was honored more by his party organization than he was by the electorate.”14\n\nCalhoun made a very substantive appearance in Illinois politics and Lincoln’s life in the period between 1839-1840 when he, Douglas, Lincoln and others engaged in a series of debates. They repeated these appearances the presidential contest of 1844. Thereafter, Calhoun endured a decade of personal and political decline although he managed to win three terms as mayor of Springfield. There was little in the Massachusetts-born Calhoun’s background to suggest that he would be the northern doughface who would open Kansas to southern slavery. In early December 1857, the Albany Atlas and Argus published a short article that attempted to establish political pedigree of the Massachusetts-born politician: “Wm. B. Calhoun of Springfield, Mass., the oldest brother of John Calhoun, has long been a prominent man in that State. Chas. Calhoun, another brother of John, was Clerk of the Senate of Massachusetts some fourteen or fifteen years; was also held in high esteem in his State for talents and unblemished character. A. H. Calhoun is known in this State as an editor, of some twenty years’ standing, of a Whig paper, Clerk of the Senate, and Canal Appraiser, holding the latter office nine years. Henry Calhoun, another brother, has been for several years, and until this Fall, Deputy-Collector in the New York Custom-House. Rev. S. H. Calhoun, another brother, has for many years been absent in the Missionary service, and is now in Abish, on Mount Lebanon, in Syria.”15 Johannsen noted that John “was the only member of his family to embrace the Democratic political faith.”16\n\nBut in 1857, Calhoun had brought the family name into disrepute. The Democratic newspaper then stated: “Such is the President of the Kansas Convention, and such the stock of freemen he represents. He is an advocate of Freedom in Kansas; and his personal vote and influence will be given to bring Kansas into the Union as a Free State.”17 By then, Calhoun was at the center of the national political hurricane in Kansas, where he was surveyor-general for Kansas and Nebraska and leader of the blatantly pro-slavery constitutional convention at Lecompton. The hurricane’s center, argued historian James A. Rawley, was the issue of race and the way that “a blundering generation, flawed by its belief in the inferiority of the blacks amongst them” sought to reframe the nation’s political debates along the lines of other issues like popular sovereignty or states’ rights.18 Allan Nevins wrote: “As President John Calhoun brought down his gavel and proclaimed the termination of the convention, few would have thought that such a cheap, disorderly assemblage had carried the nation a long step nearer to civil war.”19\n\nJohn Calhoun has had his defenders in the years since his death. A sympathetic Roy Nichols wrote: “It seemed to be Calhoun’s task, almost singlehanded, to find some means of securing submission” of the Lecompton constitution.20 A similarly sympathetic historian, Philip Shriver Klein, wrote: “Working frantically to prevent such a bombshell from landing on Buchanan’s desk, Calhoun induced the convention to adjourn for a few days and reconsider the two-constitution scheme. Almost by a miracle, he persuaded the delegates to approve his proposal by a vote of 27 to 25.”21 Historian Philip Auchampaugh argued that Calhoun “was shown beyond doubt, to have spoken and worked ardently up to the minute before the final vote was taken, for submission of the entire document to the voters, as the plan favored by the Administration…The issue hung on not more than three votes.”22\n\nFor Douglas, the convention was an anathema because it did not embody his principle of popular sovereignty. For Lincoln, it was an anathema because it acceded to the spread of slavery. For Lincoln, union, equality and constitutional law were not divisible. As historian Herman Belz noted: “Lincoln’s public life was dominated by confrontation with Democrat-party popular sovereignty, first in the controversy over the extension of slavery into the territories, and then in the secession crisis.”23 He focused on these issues with laser-like concentration.\n\nIn September 1854, Lincoln had tested his political ideas regarding the extension of slavery and the equality clause of the Declaration of Independence in a debate with Calhoun, who was a trusted supporter of Senator Douglas and his Kansas-Nebraska Act. It was not a new theme for Lincoln. In 1852, Lincoln had referred to the Declaration as the country’s bedrock: “Of our political revolution of ’76, we all are justly proud. It has given us a degree of political freedom, far exceeding that of any other of the nations of the earth. In it the world has found a solution of that long mooted problem, as to the capability of man to govern himself. In it was the germ which has vegetated, and still is to grow and expand into the universal liberty of mankind.”24 But the principles of the Declaration took on a new significance for Lincoln has he fought against the extension of slavery and the destruction of the equality principle of the Declaration.\n\nAfter helping Douglas fight off Lincoln and his allies in 1854, Calhoun had moved to Kansas and became a central figure in the agitation over slavery that gripped that territory in the mid-1850s. Over the next three years, one governor after another tried without success to rein in the conflict between pro-slavery and anti-slavery forces in the territory. Presidents Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan joined Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger B. Taney in trying dispose of the issue of slavery – and only succeeded in highlighting it.\n\nIn Senator Stephen A. Douglas, Lincoln had an opponent worthy of his talents. Iowa politician Joseph B. Grinnell described Douglas as “supreme in sociability, fertile in expedients, eloquent and fervid in discussions.”25 Historian Allen C. Guelzo noted that “Douglas had emerged by the 1850s as the single greatest name in Democratic party politics.”26 But Douglas was a man of intense contradictions, noted historian Allan Nevins: “We have the Douglas of prodigious energy, toiling on legislation until his health sank; we have the Douglas who threw his arms about low cronies in Washington barrooms.” Nevins noted that Douglas “is the harder to understand because he never took pains to reveal himself. If ever a man was an extrovert, a believer in action, it was Douglas; if ever a man was a practised, fluent speaker, it was Douglas.” But Nevins noted that Douglas did not commit his thoughts to paper – seldom writing even to close political associates. It is perhaps understandable, therefore, that there is no known correspondence between Douglas and John Calhoun for the critical months in 1857 when Calhoun thought he was doing Douglas’s bidding in Kansas. Nevins noted that Douglas “never found time to express his inner self in letters or diary.”27 As a result, Douglas’s thinking is primarily understood through his speeches while Lincoln is known through his speeches, his letters, his state papers and the many recollections of his contemporaries.\n\nWith the exception of popular sovereignty, argued Nevins, Douglas’s speeches are devoid of “a single statement or idea…that could be torn from its context and set up as a principle….he was totally incapable of writing a true state paper.” As Nevins contended, Douglas was in this respect very different from the reflective and philosophical Abraham Lincoln. For deep ideas, Nevins wrote, Douglas substituted “three or four broad emotional beliefs: (1) “faith in the popular will; (2) “believe in national growth; and (3) “optimism respecting America.” 28 For Lincoln, Douglas represented shiny and superficially appealing approach to politics. Lincoln understood that Douglas’s principle of popular sovereignty was a plausible but flawed approach to dealing with a moral problem such as slavery. The Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 was the first act in the tragedy that Lincoln foresaw. The Dred Scott case of 1857 was the second act in the unfolding tragedy of slavery’s nationalization. The ongoing conflicts in Kansas were the battleground for the third act culminating in the Lecompton Constitution. As one historian framed the situation in 1857: “The Dred Scott decision in fact whetted rather than satisfied Southern territorial appetites, and Kansas was still the only meal at hand….U.S. Land Surveyor John Calhoun…became the leader of proslavery forces in politics, brag, and intimidation. It was Douglas’s protege Calhoun who presided over the writing of the Lecompton Constitution, with its careful provisions that he and his proslavery forces would supervise and count the vote.”29 The tragedy of Lecompton could easily have been foreseen by Lincoln – but not by Douglas or Calhoun.\n\nIn 1857, Calhoun and Douglas played very different roles. Calhoun took on the cloak of the devil as the mastermind behind the pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution controversy that split the Democratic Party and doomed Douglas’s chances of becoming president. In response, Douglas played the heroic martyr. Historian Mark E. Neely wrote that Calhoun “had opposed the extreme proslavery forces in Kansas and acquiesced only reluctantly in the compromise of partial submission of the constitution.” 30 Although Calhoun has his defenders, most contemporaries and historians have generally blamed him for the chaos that ensued in 1857-58. Fewer have discussed Calhoun’s pivotal role in breaking apart the Democrat party and the nation. Paul Simon, himself a 20th century senator from Illinois, wrote: “Calhoun’s fraud had become a national scandal. But more important than that, Calhoun had been instrumental in splitting the Democratic party into Northern and Southern wings.” 31 In 1854 Lincoln had predicted what would happen if Calhoun took down the fences in the meadow that prevented slavery from entering new territories. Calhoun seemed determined to prove Lincoln right – that the extension of slavery would ensue in a country without fences to halt slavery’s spread. As Nevins wrote, the Kansas-Nebraska Act “which Douglas had said would quiet sectional antagonisms, had increased them. That enactment, which he had declared would furnish a relatively quick, automatic, and natural solution of the slavery issue, had produced delays, artificial interventions, and endless broils. That bill, presented as an embodiment of justice, had fostered fraud, dishonesty, and outrage.”32\n\nCalhoun took the brunt of much of the abuse in the north for Lecompton. But even in the South he was denounced. After Calhoun certified some anti-slavery election results in the spring of 1858, the Charleston Mercury proclaimed: “Were not his pimpled and burnished hide tanned with the whiskey that he has for years been pouring down his open gullet, he would fall to pieces on the street.”33\n\nMore important than Calhoun’s vilification was the political ostracization of Senator Douglas – himself long a stalwart of Democratic loyalty. Biographer William Garrott Brown noted that in the late 1830s Douglas had “defended [President Martin] Van Buren’s plan of a sub-treasury when many even of those who had supported Jackson’s financial measures wavered in the face of the disfavor into which hard times had brought the party in power.”34 Van Buren’s policies had led to a financial recession in 1837 that made Democrats unpopular across the country, but Douglas stood by them. So had Calhoun. Two decades later under President James Buchanan, Calhoun’s actions would make Douglas a Democratic outcast and Calhoun a northern villain. One biographer of James Buchanan wrote: “It was the ambition of Douglas, or perhaps his desire to sustain himself in Illinois….which fatally divided the Democracy.”35 Equally plausibly, one can argue that it was Buchanan’s and Douglas’s myopia that led to the conflict.\n\nBut Douglas was also a victim of his own social extroversion. He thought his personal sociability and political loyalty merited the respect and friendship of southern Democrats. Too late, Douglas discovered that too many southerners and their northern allies simply did not like or trust him. Some simply thought him crass and had used him when he thought he was using them. In 1857, Douglas had been effectively frozen out of President Buchanan’s inner circle – so that when the Lecompton crisis came, there were virtually no avenues of fruitful communication between Douglas and Buchanan, who was said to dislike his Illinois rival intensely. Douglas’s sudden isolation was ironic because, as Johannsen noted “Many of Douglas’s contemporaries agreed that he had leaned ‘too far to the southern section’ against the interests of his own. In fact, some argued that the ‘attempt to destroy the government’ which Douglas so strongly decried was indeed the result of his leaning ‘too far’ to the South. Ever since he had entered Congress eighteen years before, he had been attacked almost continuously by northern critics for turning his back on his own section in favor of pro-southern policies.”36\n\nAlthough for two decades John Calhoun was a Democratic ally of Douglas, ultimately it was Calhoun’s actions in Kansas that helped destroy the presidential aspirations of Senator Douglas. In so doing, Calhoun’s actions prepared the way for the climatic campaign debates between Lincoln and Douglas in 1858. Those debates in turn made Lincoln a dark horse candidate for the Republican presidential nomination. As Lincoln friend Isaac N. Arnold recalled the debates: “Each of these great men, I doubt not, at that time, sincerely believed he was right. Douglas’ ardor, while in such a conflict, would make him think, for the time being, he was right, and I know that Lincoln argued for freedom against the extension of slavery with the most profound conviction that on the result hung the fate of his country, Lincoln had two advantages over Douglas; he had the best side of the question, and the best temper. He was always good humored, always had an apt story for illustration, while Douglas sometimes, when hard pressed, was irritable.” Reflecting on the adversaries, the former Chicago congressman wrote:\n\n“Douglas carried away the most popular applause, but Lincoln made the deeper and more lasting impression. Douglas did not disdain an immediate id captandium triumph, while Lincoln aimed at permanent conviction. Sometimes, when Lincoln’s friends urged him to raise a storm of applause (which he could always do by his happy illustrations and amusing stories), he refused, saying the occasion was too serious, the issue too grave. ‘I do not seek applause,’ said he, ‘nor to amuse the people, I want to convince them.'”\n\n“It was often observed, during this canvass, that while Douglas was sometimes greeted with the loudest cheers, when Lincoln closed, the people seemed solemn and serious, and could be heard, all through the crowd, gravely and anxiously discussing the topics on which he had been speaking.”\n\n“Douglas secured the immediate object of the struggle, but the manly bearing, the vigorous logic, the honesty and sincerity, the great intellectual powers, exhibited by Mr. Lincoln, prepared the way, and, two years later, secured his nomination and election to the Presidency. It is a touching incident, illustrating the patriotism of both these statesmen, that, widely as they differed, and keen as had been their rivalry, just as soon as the life of the Republic was menaced, by treason, they joined hands to shield and save the country they loved.”37\n\nIn most Lincoln and Douglas biographies, the incidents involving John Calhoun’s relations with Lincoln and Douglas over a 25-year-period are generally dealt with in isolation – useful to provide some context and color for Lincoln’s and Douglas’s development – much like the grammar tutorials that New Salem resident Mentor Graham gave Lincoln or the incident where Douglas bit the thumb of Lincoln’s law partner in a campaign altercation. Indeed, Calhoun can easily be pigeonholed as a forgettable bit player. The truth, however, is that for Abraham Lincoln, Calhoun was a formative character whose actions – and opposition – helped hone Lincoln’s own thinking, rhetoric and action that made him a formidable political leader. They battled in debate and they probably also battled through the pages of the local Springfield papers – the Sangamo Journal and its successor the State Journal in Lincoln’s case. For Calhoun, it was the Springfield Republican that he helped found and the State Journal with which it later merged.\n\nNothing Calhoun did during those two decades made Lincoln’s nomination and election as president inevitable – but much that Calhoun did made Lincoln’s presidency possible. Strangely, nothing Calhoun did erased Lincoln’s respect for and gratitude to Calhoun. There is no extant correspondence between Calhoun and Lincoln over the last decade of Calhoun’s life. But another Illinois lawyer, Usher Linder, also a Democrat who sided with Douglas against Lincoln over the issue of slavery, wrote President Lincoln: “I am constrained to beleeve [sic] friend Lincoln that you have ever cherished the kindest feelings for me, as I know I have for you, and although we have been often thrown in opposition to each other I think there has never been any thing said by either that has left a pang behind.”38 One can imagine John Calhoun might have harbored feelings similar to those of Linder.\n\nAbout a year before Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Calhoun died suddenly and mysteriously of strychnine poisoning. About 19 months later in June 1861, Douglas died after strenuously campaigning to support Lincoln’s defense of the Union. By then, Douglas had experienced the disdain of the slaveocracy for about three years. He had become a political realist and a militant unionist. Lincoln’s own stressful defense of the Union would ultimately be successful but be cut short by an assassin’s bullet.\n\nIn the 1830s Douglas, Lincoln and Calhoun had all been ambitious young politicians in Springfield. Douglas had worked hard to advance politically. Calhoun had wanted to advance without working too hard. Rough and ready as a young politician, Lincoln nevertheless had valued his principles over his ambition. Unlike Calhoun and Douglas, Lincoln did not drink. Convivial as he was, Lincoln took time to think deeply and reflectively. In December 1839, while debating Calhoun and Douglas in Springfield, Lincoln had concluded his speech on the Subtreasury:\n\n“If ever I feel the soul within me elevate and expand to those dimensions not wholly unworthy of its Divine Architect, it is when I contemplate the cause of my country, deserted by all the world beside, and I standing up boldly and alone, hurling defiance at her victorious oppressors. Here, without contemplating consequences, before heaven and in the face of the world, I swear eternal fealty to the just cause, as I deem it, of the land of my life, my liberty, and my love. And who, that thinks with me, will not fearlessly adopt the oath I take! Let none falter who thinks he is right, and we may succeed. But if, after all, we shall fail, be it so; we still have the proud consolation of saying to our consciences, and to the departed shade of our country’s freedom, that the cause approved of our judgments and adored of our hearts we never faltered in defending.”39\n\nBackground\n\nIn the years leading up to the Civil War, onetime Springfield attorney John Calhoun became “notorious” in the North.40 For a longtime political opponent like Abraham Lincoln, it would have been easy to denounce Calhoun for his leadership role in creating the 1857 Lecompton Constitution. Calhoun’s friend and fellow Democrat, Stephen A. Douglas, had no problem disowning Calhoun. Republican Lincoln never did so. While Calhoun became a political pariah across the North, Lincoln continued to nurtured a great debt for Calhoun’s help more 24 years earlier when Lincoln’s economic fortunes in Illinois were at a low ebb. For two and a half decades after they met, the lives of Lincoln, Douglas and Calhoun repeatedly intersected in ways that ultimately would change the history of the United States.\n\n“Mr. Lincoln never forgot or ceased to be grateful for [Calhoun’s] kindness,” wrote Chicago journalist John Locke Scripps, who wrote an 1860 campaign biography about the Republican presidential nominee. “Although he and Mr. Calhoun were ever afterwards political opponents, he always treated him fairly, placed the most charitable construction possible upon his actions, and never lost an opportunity to do a kindly act either for him or his family.”41 The author of The History of the Early Settlers of Sangamon County wrote of Calhoun and Lincoln: “The chain of their friendship continued to the end of their lives, although they were ardent partizans of different schools in politics. President Lincoln has been heard to say that John Calhoun was the strongest man he had ever met on the stump; that he could manage Douglas, but that Calhoun always gave his hands full.”42 Stephen Douglas apparently had similar respect for Calhoun. According to the recollections of one Kansan: “I have heard Stephen A. Douglas say that the only man he dreaded in a political debate was Calhoun.”43\n\nTwenty-seven months older than Lincoln, John Calhoun had been born and raised in Massachusetts – the son of a Boston merchant. In 1821 his family had moved to New York and in 1830 the 23-year-old Calhoun moved by himself to Springfield – arriving in the state just a year before Lincoln. Calhoun had begun to study law in New York, but the requirements to become a lawyer were much less stringent in Illinois. By December 1831, the 24-year-old had married Sarah Cutter and settled down in the future state capital.44\n\nIn 1833, the state’s lower bar to the legal profession would prompt a twenty-year-old Stephen A. Douglas, also New England-born transplant, to leave New York for Illinois.45 He was admitted to the Illinois bar in March 1834 – more than two years before Abraham Lincoln. Douglas, a firm admirer of President Andrew Jackson, appropriately settled in Jacksonville, Illinois. The Vermont native half-heartedly pursued the practice of law and energetically pursued the practice of politics. Douglas would rise quickly in Democratic ranks – winning the posts of state prosecutor, state legislator, federal register of lands, state Democratic chairman, state secretary of state, and judge of the State Supreme Court within a six-year period. Douglas biographer James L. Huston cited three characteristics that accelerated Douglas’s rise up the political ladder: “First, he was a genuinely friendly person who enjoyed conversation and conviviality….Second, he had skills that readily solved the problems of collective action. Douglas was excellent at writing and debating…Third, Douglas was a workaholic who enjoyed politics, speech making, and policy creation.”46\n\nJohn Calhoun settled in Springfield where he became a well-respected school teacher and eventually a politician.47 One of his students was Richard Yates, a future political opponent. Another was William H. Herndon, Lincoln’s future law partner. Herndon recalled: “As an instructor he was the popular one of his day and age.”48 Herndon described Calhoun as “a Yankee and a typical gentleman. He was brave, intellectual, self-possessed, and cultivated.” The History of The Early Settlers of Sangamon County, Illinois described Calhoun as a “man of genial, hopeful, generous temperament; ever ready to serve of defend a friend, but rarely defending himself, except on the spur of the moment; of great ability, and for a time was the best political orator in the State of Illinois.” The book described Calhoun as “a man of great intellect, and, when aroused, of unsurpassed ability as a political debater.”49 Historian Michael Burlingame noted: “Better educated than Lincoln, Calhoun had devoted himself singlemindedly to the study of politics.”50\n\nLincoln biographer Benjamin Thomas described Calhoun as “one of the most prominent Jacksonian politicians in the county.”51 In his Lincoln biography, Ward Hill Lamon wrote that Calhoun “was one of the foremost chieftains of the political party which invariably carried the county and the district in which Mr. Lincoln lived.”52 A Lincoln contemporary described Calhoun as “a man of first class ability but too indolent to be a leader.” As a result, “he occupied a Subordinate position in his party.”53 Subordinate, perhaps, but Calhoun was always ambitious for better paying, more secure jobs. He allied himself with similarly ambitious politicians and won appointment by the governor as the Sangamon County surveyor in 1833.54\n\nYoung Lincoln, then 21, had moved from Indiana to Illinois in 1830. Breaking off from his family the next year, he settled in a small community northwest of Springfield along the Sangamon River. The Kentucky native took up residence and business in New Salem – first as a store clerk and then as a store owner. Like Calhoun, Lincoln joined the militia to fight in the Black Hawk War in 1832.55 When Lincoln’s New Salem store went bust the following year, he was in dire need of a new livelihood. At the behest of Democratic friends, Lincoln was appointed the village postmaster in 1833 and would be elected to the Legislature in 1834 as Whig. He was, however, in deep debt from the store collapse and very much needed the income he received from doing odd jobs in and around New Salem.\n\nSurveying Sangamon\n\nLincoln’s financial condition led a Sangamon Democrat named Pollard Simmons to take pity on him sometime in the second half of 1833.56 Simmons, a Kentucky-born farmer who had settled in Petersburg, north of New Salem, “loved Lincoln, who was very poor at that time, and he tried to get Lincoln in some business,” recalled one contemporary.57 Lincoln biographer William H. Herndon wrote that Simmons “applied to Calhoun as the friend of Lincoln to give him a deputyship in the surveying business.”58 Calhoun badly needed the help. Lincoln biographers John G. Nicolay and John Hay wrote that Calhoun “was at this time overburdened with work. The principal industry then was speculation in land. Every settler of course wanted his farm surveyed and marked out for him, and every community had its syndicate of leading citizens who cherished a scheme of laying out a city somewhere. In many cases the city was plotted, the sites of the principal buildings, including a court-house and a university, were determined, and a sonorous name was selected out of Plutarch, before its location was even considered. For this latter office the intervention of an official surveyor was necessary, and therefore Mr. Calhoun had more business than he could attend to without assistance.” 59 Historian Benjamin Thomas noted: “Surveying in those days…was an important and responsible job.”60\n\n“The recommendation of Lincoln’s friends was sufficient to induce Calhoun to appoint him one of his deputies. At the time he received notice of his selection by Calhoun, Lincoln was out in the woods near New Salem,” wrote Herndon.”61 One contemporary remembered that after Calhoun was convinced to hire Lincoln, patron Simmons searched out Lincoln “whom he found in the woods mauling rails.” Simmons announced: “Lincoln, I’ve got you a job.” Lincoln responded: “Pollard, I thank you for your trouble, but now let me ask you a question – Do I have to give up any of my principles for this job[?] If I have to surrender any thought or principle to get it I wouldn’t touch it with a ten foot pole.” When Simmons told Lincoln that he would not have to compromise himself, Lincoln thanked Simmons and Calhoun for the opportunity they presented.62\n\nLincoln’s known integrity and intelligence were his primary qualifications for the surveying job. 63 Calhoun and Lincoln lived more than 20 miles apart and had apparently never previously met. Nor was Lincoln professionally prepared to begin his new job. Lacking basic knowledge of geometry and surveying, Lincoln allegedly asked New Salem friend Mentor Graham to help him with an intensive, two-month course in the fundamentals. “I taught him the rules of surveying,” recalled Graham, who also helped Lincoln with the rules of grammar.64 Historian Michael Burlingame disputes this account, arguing: “Graham knew little math.”65 Fortunately, Lincoln was a quick study and “mastered” the necessary skills, according to a Lincoln contemporary.66 “Calhoun furnished him with books, directing him to study them till he felt competent to begin work,” wrote Herndon. Among the books Lincoln reviewed were System of Geometry and Trigonometry with a Treatise on Surveying by Abel Flint and Theory and Practice of Surveying by Robert Gibson.67 According to Burlingame, “Both books emphasized higher math, including logarithms, plane geometry, and trigonometry. It is not certain how much time Lincoln spent learning the art of surveying, but it was surely more than six weeks, as some have improbably asserted. He had studied the surveyor’s art ever since mastering grammar.”68 Despite his lack of formal education, Lincoln had a talent for the mathematics required to be a good surveyor. “His mind ran to mathematical exactness about things,” recalled a fellow attorney. “Exactness in the statement of things was a peculiarity with him.”69\n\n“Lincoln was not a mathematician by nature, and hence, with him, learning meant labor,” countered William Herndon. “Graham’s daughter is authority for the statement that her father and Lincoln frequently sat up till midnight, engrossed in calculations, and only ceased when her mother drove them out after a fresh supply of wood for the fire.”70 Writing of himself in the third person, Lincoln later recalled: “He accepted, procured a compass and chain, studied Flint, and Gibson a little, and went at it. This procured bread, and kept soul and body together.”71 Lincoln’s diligence in his studies was such that friends worried about his health; they “noticed that he was so emaciated we feared he might bring on mental derangement.”72\n\nBefore starting work, Lincoln reported to the home of his new boss. Lincoln “called on Calhoun, then living with his father-in-law, Seth R. Cutter, on Upper Lick Creek. After the interview was concluded, Mr. Lincoln, about to depart, remarked: ‘Calhoun, I am entirely unable to repay you for your generosity at present. All that I have you see on me, except a quarter of a dollar in my pocket.'” Calhoun’s sister-in-law, then 16, recalled this incident. After Lincoln’s departure, she and Calhoun’s wife joked “about his uncanny appearance.” John Calhoun interjected: “For all that, he is no common man.”73\n\nBecause Sangamon County was then much bigger than it was later, Lincoln was assigned to survey its northern area – what became Menard County. “When a friend told him he needed a horse, Lincoln demurred, saying he ‘was somewhat of a ‘hoss’ himself,'” wrote Burlingame. “For a time he borrowed a mount from Jack Armstrong; eventually he bought one, along with a bridle and saddle, on credit.”74 It is uncertain when Lincoln began his new duties but his first survey – for Russell Godbey – was registered on January 14, 1834.75 Lincoln was paid with two buckskins.76 Lincoln’s business misfortunes caught up to him, however. Peter Van Bergen sued Lincoln for payment of the financial notes Lincoln had signed for the debts of his failed general store in New Salem. In a judgment issued against Lincoln, Lincoln’s horse and surveying tools were put up for auction to pay his debts. Friend Jimmy Short, a farmer in the New Salem area, bid on the lot and returned them to Lincoln, who would have been unable to pursue his new livelihood without them.\n\nLincoln’s new occupation was hard. Friends furnished Lincoln with lodging as he moved about the county. Elizabeth Abell, a neighborhood friend whose sister would later briefly become engaged to Lincoln, wrote that she “got acquainted with [Lincoln when] he stayed at our house on the bluff when he was surveying all those Hills between us and Petersburg our oldest boy carryed the Chain for him.” She remembered that “when Lincoln would come in at night all ragged and scratch up with the Bryers he would laugh over it and say that was a poore mans lot[.] I told him to get me a buck skin and I would fix him so the Bryers would not scratch him he done so and I Foxd, his pants for him.”77\n\nBy all reports, Lincoln was skilled at his job. A Petersburg lawyer recalled that Lincoln “[w]as a good surveyor – found as many old corners as any one.”78 Lincoln contemporary Robert L. Wilson recalled: “At that early period the Set[t]lers made it a point to Secure choice lots of timber land, to go with their pra[i]rie land, often not entering the pra[i]rie part of the farm until it had been under cultivation long enough to make the money of the land to enter it. But the timber lots had to be Surveyed for the purpose of entering them, but also to protect from trespass by cutting[.] To accomplish this, lines must be run and clearly marked.”79 Herndon wrote: “It has never been denied that his surveys were accurate and just, and he was so manifestly fair that he was often chosen to settle disputed questions of corners and measurements.”80\n\nBy nature, Lincoln was careful. “Surveying was an excellent occupation for Lincoln; it gave him a chance to exercise his passion for precision – and he was willing to take time to insure precision,” wrote biographer Ida Tarbell. “He did not like to guess, to decide until he was confident he was right. It is said that no survey of his has ever been changed…he steadily improved in map-making and in note-taking; that a comparison of his maps and plans shows clearly – also we know that his reputation for skill and accuracy became such that he was sometimes sent for in disputes outside of his territory.”81 According to contemporary Robert L. Wilson: “Mr[.] Lincoln had the monopoly of finding the lines, and when any dispute arose among the Settlers, Mr Lincolns Compass and chain always settled the matter satisfactorily. He was a good woods man. at home in the dense forest.”82\n\n“His instruments were few and simple; contemporaries have said that his first chain was a grape-vine,” wrote Lincoln friend and biographer Noah Brooks. “But maps and plots of land surveyed by Lincoln, still extant, show a neatness and semblance of accuracy that testify to the rigid care that he always exercised in all his work.”83 This work played an important role in Mr. Lincoln’s political development, according to historian Kenneth J. Winkle. “Surveying took Lincoln up to one hundred miles from New Salem, so he met people, and made friends over a much wider area. All but the smallest jobs took at least two days, and marking off a new townsite could occupy months, so Lincoln boarded with local families until the work was done.”84 Lincoln contemporary Isaac N. Arnold wrote that Lincoln’s “work was so accurate, and the settlers had such confidence in him, that he was much sought after to survey, fix and mark the boundaries of farms, and to plot and lay off new towns and villages. Among others, he plotted and laid off the town of Petersburg….He did not speculate in the land he surveyed. Had he done so, the rapid advance in the value of real estate would have made it easy for him to make good investments. But he was not in the least like one of his appointees when President – a surveyor-general of a western territory, who bought up much of the best land, and to whom the President said: ‘I am told, sir, you are monarch of all you survey.'”85\n\nSurveying, moreover, served as a prelude to Lincoln’s entry into the legal profession. According to Winkle, “Lincoln became privy to land deals, both large and small, throughout the region. He routinely witnessed deeds, mediated disputes, and settled lawsuits between property owners.”86 Lincoln not only was technically proficient; he also had a remarkable memory for the work he completed. One 15-year-old acquaintance of Abraham Lincoln recalled driving Mr. Lincoln on an 1858 campaign trip: “The details of the trip I have entirely forgotten, except that I remember we passed through a region with which he was very familiar from his youthful experience as a surveyor, and on several occasions he stopped the buggy and laughingly asked me to go to a little distance in the woods where I would find a blazed tree, which he described, and which he had marked as a survey corner. As I say, he did this several times and never made a mistake.”87\n\nAlthough Lincoln was precise in his work, he was not unfeeling about its consequences. “While platting Petersburg, Lincoln changed a line as an act of kindness to Jemima Elmore, widow of a member of the company he had commanded in the Black Hawk War,” wrote historian Michael Burlingame. “He calculated that if he ran a street in the usual fashion it would slice a few feet off the end of Mrs. Elmore’s house, which was all she owned or was ever likely to own. Lincoln said: ‘I reckon it won’t hurt anything out here if I skew the line a little.’ Lincoln’s work in laying out New Boston earned high praise from Peter Van Bergen, who had invested money to develop the site. ‘Mr. Lincoln was a good surveyor,’ Van Bergen said: ‘he did it all himself, without help from anybody except chainmen, and also made a plat of it.’ The founders of Huron liked his work so much that they allegedly offered him $5,000 to establish a store there.”88 Lincoln’s daily rate appears to have been $3.00, according to a bill submitted in 1834 for work on a road in Sangamon County.89 But, noted biographer Ida Tarbell, “even three dollars a day did not enable him to meet all his financial obligations. The heavy debts of the store hung over him. He was obliged to help his father’s family. The long distances he had to travel in his new employment had made it necessary to buy a horse, and for it he had gone into debt.”90\n\nWhen Lincoln began his surveying career, there was a land boom underway in Illinois. The speculation was spurred by the financial policies of President Andrew Jackson. Stephen Douglas wrote in 1834, shortly after he arrived in Illinois: “Towns are being laid out every few days, and lots sold for a mere trifle which soon become valuable. Money makes the more go, and will command anything.”91 The policies of the Jackson Administration – first removing federal funds from the Bank of the United States and then enacting the Specie Circular – spurred a massive speculation in land, especially in the Old Northwest Historian Walter A. McDougall wrote: ” Sales of public land in the Mississippi Valley soared from 4 million acres in 1834 to 20 million in 1836…Jackson sponsored the Distribution Act of 1836 authorizing the Treasury to lend the surplus to state governments promoting internal improvements. All that did was to encourage boosters in Indiana, Illinois and elsewhere to launch impossibly ambitious canal and railroad projects. It almost goes without saying that the loans were never repaid.”92 Central Illinois had big dreams – but it would take more than a decade for their visions of extensive railroad connections to be realized. Lincoln, Douglas, and Calhoun would all be backers in 1837 of the ambitious internal improvements plan passed by the State Legislature – a plan which quickly bankrupted the state coffers.\n\nHonesty, not greed, was the hallmark of Lincoln’s work as a surveyor just as it later would for his later work as a lawyer. Herndon noted that “with all his knowledge of lands and their value and the opportunities that lay open to him for profitable and safe investments, he never made use of the information thus obtained from official sources, nor made a single speculation on his own account.”93 According to historian Kenneth Winkle, however, Lincoln was not completely immune to the frenzy of land speculation that accompanied the potential development of public transportation. “Lincoln himself bought one share of stock in the proposed Beardstown and Sangamon Canal and forty-seven acres of land near Huron. Like many other ‘paper towns,’ however, neither the canal nor the town ever materialized, and the meticulously subdivided land reverted back to farming. In all, Lincoln divided at least five new towns into lots for various speculators. He thus became involved in the buying and selling of land, rather than simply working it with an axe or a hoe, and he began to invest in local real estate.” 94 In 1836 Lincoln had bought land along the Sangamon River and sold it soon thereafter. He then bought two lots in Springfield which he again he soon sold for a profit. He bought a few other properties in Springfield – holding them for a longer period. While Lincoln’s real estate investments were modest for the period, during the 1850s he would become more active in making profitable loans secured by mortgages.95\n\nLincoln had other ambitions, however. While he surveyed the present in the mid-1830s, he was also studying law to prepare for his future.96\n\nThe Political Debates of the 1830s\n\nIn the 1832 elections, Sangamon County had trended Democratic, electing one future Whig (John Todd Stuart) and three Jacksonian Democrats (including Peter Cartwright, who in 1846 would be defeated by Lincoln for Congress) to the State House of Representatives for two-year terms. Party labels would only truly solidify in Illinois after 1836; these early contests reflected politicians’ attitudes toward President Andrew Jackson, Senator Henry Clay, and the policies they advocated.\n\nLincoln’s 1832 candidacy for the State House of Representatives had been advanced by friends. He had initially been reluctant to run, “avvering [sic] that it was impossible to be elected. It was suggested that a canvass of the County would bring him prominently before the people and in time would do him good. He reluctantly yielded to the solicitations of his friends, and made a partial canvas. The result, though he was defeated was highly gratifying to him and astonished even his most ardent admirers,” recalled New Salem resident Robert B. Rutledge.97 Future law partner Stephen T. Logan heard Lincoln speak in Springfield just before the election and recalled that the “gawky” Lincoln did not make a good first impression: “But after he began speaking I became very much interested in him. He made a very sensible speech…and I thought he did it very well.”98 Another New Salem resident recalled: “Mr Lincoln was in favor of Henry Clay in 1832[,] voted for him during that memorable campaign, though the New Salem precinct was largely for Jackson such was his personal popularity that he obtained a majority, verry many Jackson men of the most violent party feelings voting for him, on the grounds they believed him an honest and worthy young man.” 99 This political campaign lasted less than two weeks because Lincoln and several other candidates had been away at the Black Hawk War from April to mid-July. Still, it was a spirited race. Lincoln ran eighth among 13 candidates but did very well in the New Salem area where he was known; Lincoln claimed that he won 277 of 284 votes there. Only Lincoln’s friend John Todd Stuart was elected as an anti-Jackson man in the county.100\n\nBy the summer 1834, Lincoln was better known (in part because of his surveying work) and better prepared for the legislative campaign. Even local Democrats wanted him to run as part of their ticket. 101 Attorney Stephen T. Logan recalled: “In 1832 while he got a very large vote in his own precinct of New Salem, they hadn’t voted for him very well in other parts of the county. This made his friends down there very mad, and as they were mostly democratic, but were for Lincoln on personal grounds, in the next race (1834) they told their democratic brethren in the other parts of the county that they must help elect Lincoln, or else they wouldn’t support the other democratic candidates.”102\n\nHistorian Michael Burlingame wrote that Lincoln “stumped extensively, staying with friends like Abner Y. Ellis in Springfield….Lincoln’s personal qualities appealed to the voters, especially his geniality and humor, both of which were highly prized by frontiersmen, and he was gifted in the art of calling on people in their homes.” 103 One initially skeptical observer concluded after listening to Lincoln that he “knew more than all the other candidates put together.”104 Burlingame noted: “He was folksy and congenial, and he made people feel he was one of them – clearly, a smarter version of them, but one of them nonetheless.”105\n\n“I accompanied him on one of his electionarying [sic] trips to the Island Grove and he Make a Speach which pleased his party friends Very Well indeed – though some of the Jackson Men tried to Make sport of him. He told several anecdotes in his Speach and applyed them as I thought Verry Well,” remembered Sangamon merchant Abner Y. Ellis. 106 As Ellis later reconstructed a speech, Lincoln said: “Gentlemen and fellow citizens I presume you all Know who I am I am humble Abraham Lincoln I have been Solicited by Many freinds [sic] to become a candidate for the Legislature My politicks are short and sweet like the old Womans dance. I am in favor of a National bank. I am in favor of the internal improvement system and a high protective Tariff – These are my sentiments and politicle [sic] principles if Elected I shall be thankful if not it will be all the Same.”107\n\nAfter Democrats approached Lincoln about supporting him, Lincoln warned Stuart that Democrats were seeking to unseat his friend.108 Stuart, whose nickname was “Jerry Sly,” told Lincoln to take their help and that Stuart “would risk it.” Stuart in turn concentrated on defeating Democrat Richard Quinton, who finished in the fifth and losing position behind Stuart. In the August 4 election, Lincoln came in second, just 14 votes behind the top vote-getter and 112 votes ahead of fourth-place Stuart.109 Lincoln’s support crossed the growing divide between Whigs and Democrats.110 Again, Lincoln did very well in New Salem, collecting 250 of 288 votes. Biographer Benjamin Thomas noted “that there was no presidential contest in 1834 tended to subordinate national and partisan issues and make personal popularity a more important factor.”111 Lincoln’s popularity had spread.\n\nLincoln wasn’t rigidly partisan in this period. In an August 1835 special election for two State Senate seats vacated by George Forquer and E. D. Taylor, Lincoln voted for Democrat John Calhoun over a fellow Springfield merchant Archer Herndon, whose political allegiances fell somewhere between the Whigs and the Democrats. Herndon, who narrowly prevailed, was the father of future Lincoln law partner William Herndon. (In the other special election for the State Senate that was held the same day, Lincoln voted for Whig Job Fletcher over Methodist minister Peter Cartwright. Fletcher was a more personable figure than the ascerbic Herndon. 112 The presidential preferences of Calhoun and Herndon became a key issue in the short but nasty campaign. “In late July Herndon produced evidence proving that…Calhoun…had actually voted for Clay in the 1832 election. Congressman [William] May then personally entered the fray by publicly reading private letters Herndon had sent him. The correspondence implied that Herndon would back the candidate for president who offered him the greatest reward.”113\n\nWhen Lincoln had first run for the State House in 1832, Archer Herndon had criticized Lincoln as an “interloper.” Another member of the Herndon family remembered Lincoln delivering a stinging rebuke to Herndon, saying that if he failed five or six times in an effort to win election, he would consider it a disgrace and be sure “never to try it again.”114 So, Lincoln’s vote for the State Senate may have been simultaneously for Calhoun and against Herndon.115 Archer’s campaign attack on Calhoun for allegedly voting for Henry Clay in the 1832 presidential election may also have influenced Lincoln, who later called Clay his “beau ideal of a statesman.”116\n\nIn addition to providing for his livelihood in the mid-1830s, Lincoln may have benefitted from his relationship to Calhoun in other, less pecuniary ways. “Calhoun and Lincoln frequently talked politics,” noted historian Don E. Fehrenbacher.117 Springfield attorney Milton Hay contended that “John Calhoun was something of a factor in his [Lincoln’s] political education. Calhoun in his late years from habits of dissipation became a moral and political wreck, a tool merely to aid the iniquities of Douglas and Buchanan in Kansas, but at the period to which I refer he was justly regarded as the strongest man intellectually in the Democratic ranks. He had not the declamatory power of Douglas, but in the clear statement of political issues and logical argument thereon he was greatly his superior, and this was Mr. Lincoln’s estimate of the two men. Calhoun was specially strong in…colloquial street corner discussions… It was in these colloquial discussions that Calhoun and Lincoln not infrequently engaged. Like Lincoln he could fairly state his opponent’s side of the question, and argue with fairness and preserve his temper. His educational qualifications had been better than Mr. Lincoln’s, and politics seemed to be his only study. I have never heard the argument so effectively put against a protective tariff as Calhoun could put it. Frequent contact and conflict with such an opponent must have had its educational influence on Mr. Lincoln.”118\n\nIn 1835, the post of county surveyor was switched from an appointive to an elective position. In the same August election (in which Calhoun was running for the State Senate), Lincoln voted for Thomas M. Neale, an anti-Van Buren Democrat, over two other candidates for surveyor. The Virginia-born lawyer was a Black War veteran who had lost a campaign for the State House of Representatives in 1832, when he ran behind Lincoln. Neale had lost again in 1834 when he won less than half the votes of Lincoln. 119 He subsequently an active land speculator and served as Sangamon County surveyor until he died in August 1840. 120 Neale, like Lincoln, was a longtime supporter of Henry Clay and the recharter of the Second Bank of the United States.121 Neale, who had been the chief deputy to Calhoun, kept both Lincoln and Calhoun as his deputies.122 On September 12, 1835, the Sangamo Journal printed a “Surveyor’s Notice” from Neale: “I have appointed John B. Watson, Abram Lincoln, and John Calhoun deputy surveyors for Sangamon County. In my absence from town, any persons wishing their land surveyed will do well to call at the Recorder’s office and enter his or their names in a book left for that purpose, stating township and range in which they respectively live, and their business shall be promptly attended to.”123\n\nIn the 1836 elections Lincoln and Calhoun competed directly for Sangamon’s seven seats in the State House of Representatives. Although Lincoln and Calhoun may have earlier crossed rhetorical swords, their first known confrontation was a six-way debate at the Sangamon County Court House on July 11. Lincoln responded – as he often would in subsequent years – to a speech given by Calhoun. Calhoun spoke fourth and Lincoln spoke fifth in the series. The local Whig newspaper, the Sangamo Journal, reported: “Mr. Lincoln succeeded Mr. Calhoun. At first he appeared embarrassed, and his air was such as modest merit always lends to one who speaks of his own acts. He claimed only so much credit as belonged to one of the members of the last Legislature, for getting the State out of debt. He next came to Mr. Calhoun and the land bill. At one fell stroke, he broke the ice upon which we have seen Mr. Calhoun standing, and left him to contend with the chilling waters and merciless waves. His speech became more fluent, and his manner more easy as he progressed. In these degenerate days it seems to be the fashion of the day for all parties to admire even the frailties of the administration. The Van Buren men, particularly, are even taking shelter like ghosts under the rotten bones and tombstones of the dead acts of the administration. Mr. Lincoln, however, lifted the lid and exposed to the eye the wretched condition of some of the acts of the Van Buren party. A girl might be born and become a mother before the Van Buren men will forget Mr. Lincoln. From beginning to end Mr. Lincoln was frequently interrupted by loud bursts of applause from a generous people.”124 (When he announced his candidacy for reelection, Lincoln had declared himself a supporter of “Hugh L. White for President.” Historian Kenneth Winkle noted: “This act clearly distinguished him as an Anti-Jacksonian and suggests his growing commitment not only to issues but to a party and party organization.”125\n\nLincoln biographer John L. Scripps wrote that Lincoln’s reply to Dr. Jacob M. Early, a Methodist preacher, “achieved a signal victory over the acknowledge champion of Democracy” and “placed himself, by a single effort, in the very front rank of able and eloquent debaters.”126 Lincoln neighbor John B. Weber remembered that Lincoln’s speech against Early, under whom Lincoln had served in the Black Hawk War in 1832, was the “best” of the day: “I thought & felt that day that Lincoln was a young man of Superior intellect: he polite & courteous.” Weber noted that Lincoln debated with “ability & honesty – more so than other politicians of the d[a]y. His candor and fairness – his Courteousy [sic] gained by Confidence.”127\n\nJoshua F. Speed, who became Lincoln’s closest friend, recalled his impression of Lincoln in that campaign when he confronted Democrat George Forquer shortly after the former Springfield newspaper editor resigned his State Senate seat to take over the lucrative position of registrar in the Springfield land office. Speed said: “I was then fresh from Kentucky, and had heard many of her great orators. It seemed to me then, as it seems to me now, that I never heard a more effective speaker. He carried the crowd with him and swayed them as he pleased. So deep an impression did he make, that George Forquer, a man of much celebrity as a sarcastic speaker and great State reputation as an orator, rose and asked the people to hear him. He commenced his speech by saying that this young man would have to be taken down, and he was sorry that the task devolved upon him. He made what was called one of his slasher-gaff speeches, dealing much in ridicule and sarcasm. Lincoln stood near him with his arms folded, never interrupting him. When Forquer was done Lincoln walked to the stand, and replied so fully and completely that his friends bore him from the court-house on their shoulders.”\n\nSpeed remembered that Lincoln concluded his counterattack on Forquer by referencing the former Whig’s changed political allegiances and improved economic standing: “The gentleman commenced his speech by saying that this young man will have to be taken down, and he was sorry that the task devolved upon him. I am not so young in years as I am in the tricks and trades of a politician; but, live long, or die young, I would rather die now, than, like the gentleman, change my politics, and simultaneous with the change receive an office worth $3,000 per year, and then have to erect a lightning-rod over my house to protect a guilty conscience from an offended God.”128 (The position to which Lincoln referred was the highly coveted job of registrar in the federal Land Office in Springfield.)\n\nLincoln scholar Paul Simon, who himself served in the U.S. Senate from Illinois, maintained: “Campaigning took Lincoln to any small gathering of people who would listen….Sometimes he would walk more than five miles to appear at a gathering.”129 It was a rough campaign – rhetorically and physically. Lincoln friend James Gourley recalled that at one campaign appearance in Mechanicsburg, there was a fight. “Lincoln jumped in and Saw fair play,” he recalled. In the final rally in Springfield, again at the county courthouse, Lincoln’s future brother-in-law, Ninian W. Edwards, got into a dispute with Dr. Early, and Early challenged him to a duel. Gourley recalled Edwards drawing “a pistol on Achilles Morris.”130 Early was a disputatious character “who had earned the epithet ‘the fighting parson’ for his habit of resigning his pastorate in order to fight duels that never quite came off.”131\n\nSangamon County was “then was about as large at the State of Rhode Island,” recalled Robert L. Wilson, one of the seven Whig candidates in the election. 132 It had to have been an exhausting campaign as the Whig speakers alternated with the Democrats around the county. The winning “Long Nine” – two Whig senators in addition to the seven Whig representatives – were easily recognizable by their height.133 Altogether, noted one Whig, they “measured fifty four feet high.”134 As Wilson remembered the election three decades later:\n\nThe campaign commenced about six weeks before the election, which under the old Constitution was held on the first Monday of August. Appointments being made and published in the Sangamo Journal and the State Register, the organs of the Parties then. We traveled on horseback from one grove to another – the pra[i]ries then were entirely unoccupied – The Speaking would begin in the forenoon, the candidates Speaking alternately until all who could Speak his turn, generally consuming the whole afternoon. The discussions were upon National and State questions, prominant [sic] among which were the Subject of a National Bank, and the Tariff, and a general System of internal improvement, by the State and the finishing the Illinois and Michigan Canal, then in progress of construction –\n\nMr Lincoln took a leading part, espouseing [sic] the Whig side of all those questions, manifesting Skill and tact in offensive and defensive debates, presenting the arguments with great force and ability, and boldly attacking the questions and positions taken by opposing Candidates.\n\nThe Saturday preceding the election, the Candidates were addressing the People in the Court House in Springfield. Dr. [Jacob Early] one of the Candidates on the Democratic Side made some charge that N. W. Edwards one of the Whig Candidates deemed untrue, climbed on a table so as to be seen by Dr Early and ever[r]y one in the house, and at the top of his voice told Early that the charge was false. The excitement that followed was intense, so much so, that fighting men [thought] that a duel must Settle the difficulty, Mr Lincoln by the programme followed Earley, he took up the subject in dispute and handled it fairly, and with such ability, that every one was astonished, and pleased. So that difficulty ended there. Then first time develloped [sic] by the excitement of the occasion he spooke [sic] in that tenor intonation of voice that ultimately settled down into that clear Shrill monotone Style of Speaking, that enabled his audience, however large, to hear disti[n]ctly the lowest Sound of his voice.135\n\nUnlike the first Springfield debate, Lincoln did not concentrate on Calhoun in this confrontation. John Weber, then a Democrat who become a Republican in the 1850s, recalled “The Speech that Lincoln made was made on the current politics of the day and Especially against Doct[.] Early. Lincoln was the best Speaker, that d[a]y. I thought & felt that day that Lincoln was a young man of Superior intellect: he polite and courteous – debated the ability & honesty – more so than other politicians of the d[a]y.”136 Joshua Speed recalled: “The crowd was large….I remember that his speech was a very able one, using with great power and originality all the arguments then used to sustain the principles of the Whig party, as against its great rival the Democratic party of that day – The speech produced a profound impression – The Crowd was with him.”137\n\nIn the August 1 election, the voters were with Lincoln. He led the Whig ticket with 1716 votes while Calhoun led the losing Democratic ticket with 1278 votes and Early followed with 1194.138 The Whig “Long Nine” swept the election in Sangamon County. According to Benjamin T. Thomas, “Party discipline was stricter by this time and the Democrats did not offer him their organized support. But the returns show that many of his Democratic friends again voted for him. In New Salem, his 107 votes were 23 more than the number polled by…the next highest candidates.”139\n\nLincoln was also apparently active in a presidential contest for the first time, using the pages of the Sangamo Journal to attack the local supporters of Vice President Martin Van Buren. Andy Van Meter, who chronicled the history of Sangamon’s newspapers, wrote: “The Journal’s February 20 issue published a letter that had animated the August local elections. The letter, written in frontier dialect, purported to be a communication from the Republican’s editor, George R. Weber, to his chief in Washington, Congressman William L. May. The epistle was signed ‘Johnny Blubberhead,’ but everyone in town knew that the actual author was Abraham Lincoln. In the letter, the editor of the Republican reports that he has ‘got clean out of writing’ and requests ‘instructions’ from Washington. Blubberhead worries that Congressman May’s man ‘Friday,’ John Calhoun, has bumped his head and ‘hurt his eyedear.’ Just the other day Blubberhead had heard Calhoun talking to himself: ‘He said if took $200 twas nobody’s business; he needed it – he’d worked for the party – and he’d be (and then he used an awful word) if he didn’t blow up the whole party if they didn’t do something for. He said…tho you promised so fine you never performed the paying part.'”\n\nVan Meter continued: “The ridiculous caricature of editor Weber then warns the congressman that his ‘successor,’ George Forquer, the present registrar of the land office, has declared ‘upon his honor as a politician that he won’t pay another cent for printing presses – so you can’t get no more from him.’ Blubberhead closes by admonishing chief not to pull ‘none of your old Edwardsville tricks,’ a veiled reference to a quashed indictment for lechery and theft that lay buried in the congressman’s past.” Wisely perhaps, May did not return from Washington to campaign in the vast district. He triumphed over Lincoln’s friend, John Todd Stuart, by 1500 votes.140\n\nCalhoun did not take well his narrow campaign loss of 1836. The 1837 legislature took up two important bills – one a controversial bill to spend $14 million of state bonds on internal improvements. The second was a bill to relocate the state capital from Vandalia to another town. The “Long Nine” legislators from Sangamon County were united in their efforts to move the capital to Springfield. Not so Calhoun. According to historian Theodore Calvin Pease: “In revenge for [the] complete overthrow the democratic opponents, John Calhoun and his friends, attempted to defeat the Springfield project, some of them lobbying for Peoria and some for Illiopolis, a town set near the center of the state.”141 The Sangamo Journal editorialized about Calhoun in July 1837: “To a citizen of our town while at Vandalia last winter, he declared emphatically, that he owed the people of Sangamon nothing; that he had been badly used by the county, and in return, he was against the county; that he never would be a candidate again, and swore by his God that he would remember the course of the county towards him.”142 It would not be the only time that Calhoun was accused of forgetting the political interests of his home town.\n\nStephen A. Douglas, then 23, was also elected to the state legislature in 1836 – from smaller Morgan County. An outspoken defender of the policies of Andrew Jackson, Douglas was a natural campaigner. Unlike Lincoln, Douglas apparently had no difficulty “treating” voters to liquor.143 “The years 1836 and ’37 were a sort of formation period; the starting point of many great men who distinguished themselves in the subsequent history of Illinois,” recalled attorney Usher Linder, a Democratic legislator who served as state attorney general in 1837-39. Linder wrote that when he met Douglas, “[h]e looked like a boy, with his smooth face and diminutive proportions, but when he spoke in the House of Representatives, as he often did in 1836 and ’37, he spoke like a man, and loomed up into the proportions of an intellectual giant, and it was at that session he got the name of the ‘Little Giant,’ by which he was called all over the Union til the day of his death…” 144 Linder remembered that Douglas “was a very ready and expert debater, even at that early period of his life. He and Lincoln were very frequently pitted against each other, being of. different politics. They both commanded marked attention and respect from the House.”145 Both Lincoln and Douglas supported the internal improvements which passed in February – to the state’s great economic regret. Douglas, however, maintained, that the state’s obligations under the legislation were far greater than he thought wise.\n\nIn mid-1837, one of Lincoln’s House colleagues, Dan Stone, resigned to become a circuit court judge In the special election to fill the seat, Calhoun ran for the Democrats and Lincoln’s friend Edward D. Baker ran for the Whigs. Lincoln did not vote. Benjamin T. Thomas noted: “By this time his position in the Whig party was such that if he voted he must cast his ballot for Baker, but knowing that he would be elected anyway he may have refrained from voting against his friend, Calhoun.” Thomas noted that Calhoun supported the creation of a new county in northern Sangamon while Baker opposed the proposition; the Lincoln biographer wrote that “a vote for Baker would have been interpreted as a vote against division, and would have weakened his position among his old friends in the northern precincts.”146 Calhoun lost again – by a margin of 1178-872. It was the first, but not the last time Calhoun would lose to Baker, who remained a close Lincoln friend until his battlefield death in 1861.\n\nIn the summer of 1838 Lincoln seemed to devote more time to his law practice than politics. Robert Wilson recalled: “A question of the division of the County was one of the local issues. Mr Lincoln and myself among others, residing in the portion of the county sought to be organized into a new County, and opposing the division, [i]t became necessary I should make a special canvas, through the North West part of the County, then known as Sand ridge. I made the canvass. Mr. Lincoln accompanied me being personally acquainted with every one. We called at nearly every house.”147 This was the area where Lincoln had done much of his earlier surveying. Kenneth Winkle noted: “For years, Sangamon County’s small-town and rural residents had proposed dividing the county into several smaller ones.”148 Van Meter noted that the Whig leaders of Sangamon County such as Journal editor Simeon Francis “had invested heavily in Springfield and built up a strong Whig party. They had fought hard to secure the state capital, and they were going to oppose any attempt to diminish their growing town’s importance.”149 Lincoln was active, however, in writing anonymous letters for the Sangamon Journal attacking Democrats in the presidential election and on the local political issues.\n\nOn August 6, Lincoln again was the top vote getter for the State House of Representatives in Sangamon County with 1803 votes. This time, however, Calhoun won election with 1711 votes – he was the only Democrat to defeat a Whig in Sangamon County. The “Long Nine” were hurt by their support for division of Sangamon County. Lincoln’s votes were now more partisan that personal. Paul Simon noted: “In the State Senate race between his friends ‘Whiggish’ Archer G. Herndon, one of the Long Nine, and Democrat Bowling Green, who had helped Lincoln get his political start at New Salem, Lincoln voted for Herndon.”150 Green, for whom Lincoln had a deep affection, lost to Herndon by a margin of just 47 votes.151\n\nHistorian Mark E. Neely noted that once both were members of the state legislature, Calhoun and Lincoln differed strongly on slavery. The Massachusetts native defended slavery while the Kentucky native attacked it. On March 3, 1837, Lincoln and fellow Whig legislator Dan Stone had presented a “protest” against slavery:\n\n“Resolutions upon the subject of domestic slavery having passed both branches of the general Assembly at its present session, the undersigned hereby protest against the passage of the same.”\n\n“They believe that the institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy; but that the promulgation of abolition doctrines tend rather to increase than to abate its evils.”\n\n“They believe that the Congress of the United States has no power, under the constitution, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the different States.”\n\n“They believe that the Congress of the United States has the power, under the constitution, to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia; but that that power ought not to be exercised unless at the request of the people of said District.”\n\n“The difference between these opinions and those contained in the said resolutions, is their reason for entering this protest.”152\n\nThe slavery controversy heated up again later in the year. The proximate cause for the debate was the controversy engendered by anti-slavery editor Elijah Lovejoy and his murder by a pro-slavery mob in November 1837. In the aftermath noted historian Robert W. Johannsen, many abolition petitions, most of them endorsing the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia, were received by the legislature from over the state. In response to these petitions, Calhoun introduced a set of resolutions declaring that Illinois should openly announce its position on the slavery question. He maintained that Congress had no power to abolish slavery in the district of Columbia or in the territories of the United States, nor could the government halt the slave trade between the states; the question of slavery, he added, should not be a factor in the admission of a state into the Union.” Historian Mark Neely wrote: “Lincoln voted to table Calhoun’s resolutions denying that Congress could abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, stating no objection to the annexation of Texas or the addition of slave states to the Union, and condemning the repeal of laws ‘which graduate the right of the citizens by the color of the skins.'”153 Johannsen wrote: “Action on Calhoun’s resolutions was adverse, but his statements placed him clearly within the states rights philosophy of the Democratic party and forecast the position he was to assume later in the 1850s.”154\n\nThe 1838 Congressional Election\n\nAnother approaching election in August 1838 overshadowed that for the State Legislature. Calhoun’s Democratic friend, Stephen A. Douglas, held two jobs – state representative and register of the federal Land Office in Springfield. George Forquer, the Springfield Democrat whom Lincoln had lambasted after he got the land office job, had died. Douglas had been appointed land register in March 1837 after the conclusion of the state legislative session in which he had backed Circuit Court Judge Richard M. Young for election as U.S. Senator. There was an apparent quid pro quo. “Young had secured Douglas’s appointment,” according to biographer Robert W. Johannsen. Douglas took up residence in Springfield. Just as Lincoln became an habitue of the Sangamo Journal, Douglas became a frequent visitor to the Springfield Republican, where Douglas read and sometimes wrote for the newspaper that Forquer once had edited. Douglas also became part of the editorial and physical feuds that followed sometimes venomous, sometimes satirical newspaper articles in the Republican (later the State Register) and the Journal.155\n\nOne local controversy involved the way that Douglas got his plum job. Douglas biographer Allen Johnson wrote: “It began to be rumored about that the young man owed his appointment to the Sangamon delegation, whose schemes [to move the state capital from Vandalia to Springfield] he had industriously furthered in the legislature. Finally, the Illinois Patriot made the direct accusation of bargain. Touched to the quick, Douglas wrote a letter to the editor which fairly bristles with righteous indignation. His circumstantial denial of the charge,-his well-known opposition to the removal of the capital and to all the schemes of the Sangamon delegation during the session,-cleared him of all complicity. Indeed, Douglas was too zealous a partisan to play into the hands of the Sangamon Whigs.” Lincoln himself may have been the author of a brief and sour note that appeared in the Sangamo Journal: “The Land Office at this place was opened on Monday last. We are told the little man from Morgan was perfectly astonished, at finding himself making money at the rate of from one to two hundred dollars a day!”156 By the fall of 1837, Calhoun probably thought such a lucrative appointive job as Douglas held was more secure and more remunerative than any elective post.157 Calhoun saw an opportunity for himself. To get the Land Office post, it was alleged, Calhoun promoted Stephen A. Douglas to unseat Democratic Congressman William L. May, who himself had been the Land Office receiver before his election to the U.S. House.\n\nDouglas himself fed Democratic disenchantment with May – especially from Senator Richard M. Young, whose election by the state legislature in 1836 May had opposed. 158 In August 1837, Douglas wrote an attorney friend: “The fact is our Party will never support Col[.] May again for Congress, unless public sentiments takes a great change. I am unable to say or even imagine who will be our Candidate for Congress. I am decidedly in favor a District Convention to nominate a Candidate, and then let us all unite and elect him, be he who he may.”159 Through the pages of the Illinois Republican that Douglas helped edit, discontent with May was stirred. Word of Douglas’s activities reached Washington, where in September Congressman May, away from Illinois to attend a special session of Congress, complained to Secretary of the Treasury Levi Woodbury “that the Register of the Land Office at Springfield, Illinois, has been recently, and is perhaps at present engaged in a political electioneering tour through my district getting up meetings of the voters.”160 Douglas defended himself to Woodbury in a letter in early October that mixed denial of wrong-doing with insistence on his rights to speak out on political issues:\n\n“Upon what authority Mr May founds his charge I am unable to conceive, unless it is a short paragraph in a late number of the Sangamo Journal an opposition paper in this Town which seizes every opportunity to impugn the motives, and misrepresent the acts of every member of the Democratic Party. That you may better understand the nature of this charge and the circumstances out of which it had its origin I will give the facts which are as follows. Previous to my appointment to this office last Spring I devoted myself to the practice of Law in all the counties in this Judicial Circuit, and had considerable unfinished business which rendered it necessary to attend the late Terms of the Courts to attend to the business in which I had been previously engaged. I accordingly did so and confined myself exclusively to this Judicial Circuit a part of which is Mr May’s Congressional District and a part in Mr [Adam] Snyder’s. No political meetings were held and of course no delegates were appointed and pledged as stated by Mr May, in any county that I was in during the time I was there; not have I attended or in any manner participated in the proceedings of any political meeting in Mr May’s District since I have held an Office under the General Government. From the facts you will perceive that the charge is not only destitute of any foundation in truth; but is the production of a suspicious jealous mind operated on by the slang of a petty newspaper managed and conducted for political and selfish purposes. I do not wish the department to construe my denial of all participation in political meetings recently as an admission that I would deem such a course culpable or in any degree improper, or that I have been prevented from doing so by the fact of holding Office. On the contrary, I feel myself as free to mingle with my fellow citizens and express my opinions of men and measures (not even excepting Mr. May) as I should if I had never received an Office at the hands of the Government.”161\n\nDouglas seemed to protest too much. So politically free did Douglas feel in his position that a month later Douglas signed a call for a Democratic convention in Peoria. May’s influence with Woodbury was undoubtedly lessened because the congressman was voting against President Martin Van Buren on his Subtreasury proposal.162 While he was in Washington, May’s troubles grew as did calls for a Democratic congressional convention to oust him. As Douglas biographer Allen Johnson related the events leading to a Democratic district convention: “When the legislature met for a special session in July [1837], the leading spirits in the reform movement held frequent consultations, the outcome of which was a call for a Democratic State convention in December. Every county was invited to send delegates. A State committee of fifteen was appointed, and each county urged to form a similar committee. Another committee was also created – the Committee of Thirty – to prepare an address to the voters. Fifth on this latter committee was the name of S. A. Douglas of Sangamon. The machinery of the party was thus created out of hand by a group of unauthorized leaders. They awaited the reaction of the insoluble elements in the party, with some anxiety.” Allen wrote:\n\n“The new organization had no more vigilant defender than Douglas. From his coign of vantage in the Land Office, he watched the trend of opinion within the party, not forgetting to observe at the same time the movements of the Whigs. There were certain phrases in the ‘Address to the Democratic Republicans of Illinois’ which may have been coined in his mint. The statement that ‘the Democratic Republicans of Illinois propose to bring theirs [their candidates] forward by the full and consentaneous voice of every member of their political association,’ has a familiar, fullmouthed quality. The Democrats of Sangamon called upon him to defend the caucus at a mass-meeting; and when they had heard his eloquent exposition of the new System, they resolved with great gravity that it offered ‘the only safe and proper Way of securing union and victory.’ There is something amusing in the confident air of this political expert aged twenty-four; yet there is no disputing the fact that his words carried weight with men of far wider experience than his own.\n\nBefore many weeks of the campaign had passed, Douglas had ceased to be merely a consultative specialist on party ailments. Not at all unwillingly, he was drawn into active service. It was commonly supposed that the Honorable William L. May, who had served a term in Congress acceptably, would again become the nominee of the Democratic party without opposition. If the old-time practice prevailed, he would quietly assume the nomination “at the request of many friends.” Still, consistency required that the nomination should be made in due form by a convention. The Springfield Republican clamored for a convention; and the Jacksonville News echoed the cry. Other Democratic papers took up the cry, until by general agreement a congressional district convention was summoned to meet at Peoria. The Jacksonville News was then ready with a list of eligible candidates among whom Douglas was mentioned. At the same time the enterprising [Jacksonville News editor S.S.] Brooks announced “authoritatively” that if Mr. May concluded to become a candidate, he would submit his claims to the consideration of the convention. This was the first intimation that the gentleman’s claims were likely to be contested in the convention. Meantime, good friends in Sangamon County saw to it that the county delegation was made up of men who were favorably disposed toward Douglas, and bound them by instructions to act as a unit in the convention.163\n\nOn November 20, 1837, Douglas duly won the Democratic convention endorsement in Peoria over two-term incumbent Congressman May, who received no votes. It was not representative conclave; only 16 of the district’s 33 counties were represented by just 40 delegates.164 Douglas however used his base in Morgan and Sangamon Counties to win the nomination with just 23 of the 39 votes cast. As Douglas biographer Gerald M. Capers wrote: “The substitution was clearly the work of the machine, and the statement of the Little Giant’s friends that he accepted without hope of success merely to ‘consolidate the party’ is hardly credible.”165 It is no wonder that Lincoln was skeptical of the new Democratic device – the convention – and skeptical of the master manipulator behind the conventions – Stephen Douglas. Capers noted that Douglas “was one of the early leaders in the successful movement to induce the party to adopt the practice of choosing only one candidate for each office instead of several, and of selecting the nominee by a convention at the county, district, or state level. Usually these conventions were rump affairs, controlled by Douglas and his cohorts.” 166 Douglas melded political principle and expediency behind his own personal interest. The Peoria convention strongly endorsed the economic policies of the Van Buren administration including the “Sub-Treasury system” and denounced Congressman May who, it said “has disregarded and forfeited the pledges given to his constituents before his election to the office which he now occupies, and that he be respectfully requested to resign his seat in Congress, in consideration of his opposition to the party and principles which elevated him to his present station.”167 (Two decades later the table would turn and Douglas himself would be a similar situation.)\n\nAs Douglas biographer Henry Parker Willis observed: “Douglas, in fact was not a strong candidate. He was then less than twenty-five years of age; the party was generally in a bad condition; he was inexperienced save in purely local matters; he had no financial resources with which to back the organization. It was a wonderful tribute to his personality and skill as a manipulator that he should have received the nomination at all.”168 Biographer Allen Johnson wrote:\n\n“The history of the [Peoria] district convention has never been written: it needs no historian. Under the circumstances the outcome was a foregone conclusion. Not all the counties were represented; some were poorly represented; most of the delegates came without any clearly defined aims; all were unfamiliar with the procedure of conventions. The Sangamon County delegation alone, with the possible exception of that from Morgan County, knew exactly what it wanted. When a ballot was taken, Douglas received a majority of votes cast, and was declared to be the regular nominee of the party for Congress.”\n\n“There was much shaking of heads over this machinemade nomination. An experienced public servant had been set aside to gratify the ambition of a mere stripling. Even Democrats commented freely upon the untrustworthiness of a device which left nominations to the caprice of forty delegates representing only fourteen counties out of thirty-five. The Whigs made merry over the folly of their opponents. “No nomination could suit us better,” declared the Sangamo Journal.”169\n\nLincoln’s newspaper friends were more than willing to stoke the May-Douglas controversy. “A series of letters appeared in the Sangamo Journal soon [after the convention], supposedly written by an anonymous conservative Democrat, which purported to reveal the inside story of Douglas’ nomination,” wrote historian Robert W. Johannsen. The letters suggested a backroom detail between Douglas and an unnamed co-conspirator who strongly appeared to be John Calhoun.”170 The letters were the kind of political writing in which Abraham Lincoln sometimes engaged; he was a master of the pseudonymous letter. Lincoln scholars believe that many letters or editorials in the Sangamo Journal were written by Lincoln. Some of those letters made scandalous or satirical allegations about his political opponents. One of those letters would lead to a near-duel between Lincoln and his target, State Auditor James Shields, in 1842.\n\nLincoln scholar Glenn H. Seymour studied the “Conservative” letters and concluded that they followed a unique Lincoln writing pattern. Harry E. Pratt confirmed that notion by observing that the Illinois State Register directly charged Lincoln without both authorship and a subsequent attempt in July to attribute authorship to Circuit Judge Jesse B. Thomas, Jr.171 In the second “Conservative” letter, Lincoln attacks “a certain gentleman who resides in Sangamon county, and who has followed a variety of occupations both here and elsewhere, for a living and failed in all, cast about for some desperate manoevre [sic] that might save him, when he should be called upon to close up his loafing operations. After some considerable wandering, his eyes were finally settled upon a Land Office; and to remove the incumbent, and place himself in his stead, all the powers of his mind were put to the torture. He first made a set at the Receiver’s Office in Springfield, but the Receiver seeing nothing in prospect that he liked better, and preferring himself to the best of his friends, chose not to be jostled from his place. Next he turned to the Register’s Office. It was filled by a young man of respectable talents for one of his age, who had received rather an extraordinary succession of favors from his party, and who, mistaking those favors, which were merely designed to give him the means of living, as evidence of a high admiration of his talents, was more completely assailable on the score of vanity, and more susceptible of flattery than is often the lot of man to be.”\n\nAt that point in the letter, Lincoln zeroed in on Calhoun’s supposed attempts to convince the 24-year-old Douglas that he should move up the political ladder and vacate his lucrative post. Already having served a state legislator, prosecutor, and now land register, Douglas’s ascent had indeed been rapid. Lincoln wrote that: “Long practice enabled him [Calhoun] to discover the vulnerable point of the Register: and there he directed his attack. He commenced, as is supposed, by telling him that he regretted to see him confined to the dry and laborious occupation of writing answers to the endless and silly enquiries of every applicant about N W. of S. E. of 23, T. 24 R. 3 W, etc., etc.; that for one whom nature designed for nothing else but to be\n\n‘Fixed to one certain spot,\n\nTo draw nutrition, propegate [sic], and rot.[‘]\n\nsuch a plodding occupation was well enough; but that for one of his towering genius, it was absolutely intolerable.”172\n\nAs historian Michael Burlingame has detailed, Lincoln in the 1830s and 1840s could be a very tough and cruel politician. Having set up the two characters for the “Conservative” article, Lincoln proceeded to skewer Calhoun’s flattery and Douglas’ vanity. “You may be President of these United States just as well as not,” Lincoln quoted Calhoun supposedly telling Douglas. “A seat in Congress is not worthy to be your abiding place, though you might with propriety serve one term in the capacity of Representative – not that it would at all become you; but merely in imitation of some king, who being called to the throne from obscurity, lodges for one night in a hovel as he journies [sic] to the place. History gives no account of a man your age occupying such high ground as you do now.” Lincoln then skewered Douglas’s small stature by having Calhoun supposedly compare Douglas to Napoleon and the diminutive President Martin Van Buren: “The only difference [with Van Buren], perhaps is, that his own was but the miniature of what your’s is the life size.” Lincoln then presented a conversation between the Land Office register and his flatterer:\n\nDouglas: “But, do you really think a seat in Congress within my reach?”\n\nCalhoun character: “With your reach! What a question! – How strange it is, that while true genius can place a true estimate upon everything else, it never can upon its own powers. There is no doubt of a seat in Congress being within your reach. The only question is whether you will condescend to occupy it. Our party have the majority in this District, and all you have to do is to get nominated at a District Convention as a party candidate. Get the nomination, place this office in my hands, (which I would by no means accept, only for the opportunity it will afford me of serving you) and take the field boldly, and make a regular electioneering campaign of it from this time to the election, and, depend upon it, success is certain..”\n\nDouglas: “Done,” says the Register. “Procure me the nomination of the District Convention, and the office is yours.”\n\nCalhoun character: “I fear you mistake my motive,” says the man of expedients. “I only proposed to take office as a means of serving you.”\n\nDouglas: “Just so I understand you,” says the Register.\n\nCalhoun character: “So let it be then.”\n\nDouglas: “Agreed.”173\n\n“The whole story was a spoof on Douglas’ youth and ambition,” Johannsen wrote of “Conservative #2.” It was also a commentary on Calhoun’s need for steady employment. Lincoln would have had multiple reasons for writing such an article. First, Douglas had used the new convention system – which Lincoln disliked – to"
