As a Senator from Ohio (1831 - 1837), Ewing had advocated rechartering the Second Bank of the United States and had denounced President Jackson's removal of government deposits.

He introduced several options, including bills for a new national bank. None of his suggestions were adopted and Tyler thwarted his plan for organizing a central bank to replace the Independent Treasury System, maintaining that it was unconstitutional for the Treasury Department to authorize bank branches in the States without their consent.

The younger Browne settled in Richmond in 1846 to establish himself as a portrait painter. In 1847, during the Mexican-American War, he traveled to Mexico to paint portraits of Zachary Taylor and other war heroes. Before and after the Civil War, Browne traveled extensively in the southern United States painting portraits of eminent members of society. His posthumous portrait of Thomas Ewing, painted in 1879, was probably based on a photograph.",
