        "text": "C. Lowell Harriss | 1930\n\nMy math teacher, Mrs. Burns, encouraging me to to go Harvard where I graduated summa cum laude in 1934.\n\nBarrett Hollister | 1930\n\nNitrogen Tri-iodide! For me, Dr. Senter and his Chemistry course were the high point of my very enthusiastic four years at Central High. I recall his painting the hall floor outside his classroom with a solution of NI3 while inside we were taking one of his numerous tests. When one steps on the dried NI3, it explodes like a small firecracker. As we filed out into the hall, he gave each of us his usual handshake and greeting while our preceding classmates danced around in the hall -- bang! bang! -- wondering who was setting off the firecrackers. Fellow students passing on the far side of the hall found it hilarious.\n\nLouise Condon Lyman | 1930\n\nWonderful friends and acquaintances from all parts of Omaha. No problems of crime or racial distinction.\n\nJohn S. Randall | 1930\n\nSarah Vore Taylor, Mille Bozell (friend), we call Mille Madam Wozell Bozell, Mason Gulgard, Cadet Corps.\n\nMartha Watson Wallace | 1931\n\nA wonderful Latin teacher, a cold trek across the open square in winter, glee club and wonderful friends.\n\nRobert Eagleston | 1932\n\nGreat teachers in all areas of study, good student activities and fellowship, outstanding leadership. Senior \"homeroom\" was something special. O Book work, Dr. Senter (Chemistry), Coach Knapple, serving as Class President. At 90 years of age, we continue to look back on wonderful years at Central with appreciation.\n\nMelvin Sommer | 1932\n\nJ.G. Masters, Jessie Towne, Fred \"Zip\" Hill, Frank Gulgard, F.Y. Knapple, Bess Bozell, Margarita Vartanian, Andrew Nelson, Helen Lane, Herbert Senter, Irma Costello, Irene Jensen, Anne Lane Savidge, Adrian Westberg, Howard Douglas (Douglas Printing), Sara Vore Taylor, Bernice Engel, Elizabeth Craven, Bessie Rathbun, Louise Stegner, Mabel Burns, Sarah Ryan and many others.\n\nAdrienne Griffith Birge | 1933\n\nBeing in \"Papa\" Schmidt's Physics Class - we three girls at one table - the boys all at the other end of the room, including Irvin. Being in Doc Senter's Chemistry class, Miss Rockfellow's French Class and in Sarah Vore Taylor's English class. More recently, I attended my 50th Class reunion in 1985 - the first reunion I managed to go to. What a great time, seeing my \"old\" classmates after so many years! I have the wonderful color photo of all 116 of us taken on the steps at the west entrance to prove I was there!\n\nGoldie Zusman Fineman | 1933\n\nWonderful prinicpal. Wonderful teachers. Proud to have been a student at Omaha Central High School. Wonderful, Wonderful, Wonderful! The Greatest! Remember J.G. Masters!!\n\nJeanne Biurvall Moore | 1933\n\nBest years of my life growing up!\n\nKatharine Shearer Patterson | 1933\n\nSarah Vore Taylor's Style Book helped bring success and confidence to countless students. At 86 years, I still refer to my copy! And Miss Sommers' English class enriched our lives with her in-depth study of Victor Hugo's Les Miserables. Ruth Pilling remained a friend over all these years, as I'm sure she was to all the students whose lives she touched.\n\nHelen Amos Bushman | 1934\n\nI enjoyed playing 2nd violin in the CHS orchestra and watching any CHS production. Singing in the CHS Choir. Watching CHS football games. Playing bridge in an 8-member group, most of whom were CHS students....five of us were named Helen!\n\nBen Magzamin | 1934\n\nAll good!\n\nBetty Robertson | 1934\n\nThe open courtyard in Winter.\n\nCourtney Berner Wachs | 1934\n\nI well remember my first days at Omaha Central. I had come in from a \"posh\" high school in Grosse Point, MI -- but soon learned that their educational standards left much to be desired. That \"style-book\" about had me baffled until I reported to Jessie Towne that I felt I could not make the grade in the English class to which I had been assigned. Then came tutoring by my english teacher; I regret to say I do not remember her name, and things turned around. I was thrilled to get a B in the finals of English 5. I was fortunate to make two very good friends --Lucille Welsh Foley and Gretchen Patterson Delay. After battling cancer for many years Lucy Foley died in October 1999 of heart disease. Gretchen was for a time a teacher of English at CHS. I well remember the study halls and considered them a blessing for a lot of students who otherwise might not have bothered with homework. If the old restrooms on the stairways (a surprise to a newcomer) are no longer in existence, can only wonder what became of them. No, we did not have computer labs in my time - - somehow we learned to do things the longer way. I am always grateful that I was fortunate enough to do 2 1/2 years at Central - - gave me a real foundation for later in life.\n\nMary Sprague Wall | 1934\n\nA stadium, at last! And a new gym! I remember field hockey and tennis at Dewey Park, football at Tech High, volleyball under the rafters - the 'new' gym was huge and always occupied by many classes and sports. I remember Miss Stegner's English class and the Handbook. She paid me 25 cents an hour to mark papers each day.\n\nHelen Wilkes Douthy | 1935\n\nRush to the cafeteria when chili was served for 10 cents.\n\nLouis Gogela | 1935\n\nGreat Teachers: Mrs. Engle (Latin), Dr. Senter (Chemistry), Mr. Gulgard (Physics), Sara Vore Taylor (English), Mr. Masters.\n\nKatherine Smith Kirby | 1935\n\nI sang in the ACappella Choir under Carol Marhoff Pitts. We were the best High School choir in the midwest and traveled to Chicago and Minneapolis.\n\nRobert Langdon | 1935\n\nThe Road Show, Central winning the city golf championship, Latin.... all GOOD!\n\nJerome Milder | 1935\n\nPapa Schmidt was the track coach. During the Winter we ran around the third floor. Spring and Summer we walked to Tech High with track shoes.\n\nJohn O’Hanlon | 1935\n\nI was one of the many O'Hanlon's who attended Central. All of us benefited greatly for having attended this great high school. I wasn't aware at the time of how great it was, but later on it sunk in. It was at that time probably one of the top schools in the country and perhaps it sill is. When I was there is was quite a melting pot. We came from all walks of life, but in the classroom we were seated alphabetically - no matter who or what. I knew Frank Gulgard well. I carried the World Herald while in school, and he was on my route. In those days, we collected for the paper every week and the Gulgards were always my last stop and they would have me in for a treat. I don't think they had any children, so I was sort of \"adopted\". Some other memorable faculty members: Dr. Senter (Chemistry) - He was the speed trap of our day. Better not run in the hall or he would ticket you! Papa Schmidt (Physics) - a healer of wounds.\n\nMariella Mossman Wolf Unnevehr | 1935\n\nSinging in the A Cappella choir over the national radio hook up in Chicago. Being President of the Kappa Sorority. The Christmas formal dances at the Fontenelle Hotel, Paxton and the Chermont!!! Dinners at each other's homes! My first french kiss. Playing bridge at Fort Omaha with the Army Brats. My french class with Miss Rockefeller! My english teacher - can't remember her name! And the Latin teacher. The friends I made and no longer remember their names!\n\nRuth Friedman Altsuler | 1936\n\nUp for \" Miss Central\" election. French classes.\n\nJoseph Anderson | 1936\n\nAs a freshman, I remember Dr. Herbert Senter putting the wrath of God on us while keeping order in the book room at the start of semesters. Later on I worked summers in the book room with Miss Mildred Goosman. If you took Chemistry from Dr. Senter, he would have us fill out a sheet listing all of our relatives who had taken his Chemistry class. He had been there so long, that he had parents, siblings, aunts and uncles as well as cousins! I don't remember grandparents, but possible. It was like Omaha's Who's Who!\n\nTed Backstrom | 1936\n\nTrying to figure out what all those x's and y's meant during Algebra class, playing baseball and basketball for the school.\n\nFrances Blumkin Batt | 1936\n\nCentral High was a new universe! I loved Journalism in Ms. Anne Savidge's Class, I haunted the Library to read as much as I could, I found dedication and happiness in Ms. Helen Summer's English Class. Miss Lane's Biology Class was a world of wonder in spite of the frogs. I first heard Gilbert & Sullivan's Mikado in the new auditorium in 1932.\n\nNaomi Bexten Bena | 1936\n\nWhen my dad (1) Took me to a teacher meeting at age four, (2) Let me help paint scenery at Central at age six, (3) Set up a big ladder in room 215 so we could watch the parades come up Capitol Ave. When I became a student (1) To watch and participate in sports; my favorites were riflery and hockey, (2) We got to watch my dad coach his wrestlers after school, a no!no! for girls that long ago, (2) Before the courtyard, watching the first snowflakes while running through the courtyard.\n\nLeonard Bourke | 1936\n\nFinally graduating. It took me five years to graduate from high school.\n\nHelen Davis Cozad | 1936\n\nWorking as secretary to Principal J.G. Masters after graduating in 1936, walking through the courtyard in snow, my Latin teachers: Mrs. Rathburn and Mrs. Engler (not my best subject).\n\nJean Ellison Hermann | 1936\n\nSeparate steps for girls, style book by Sara Vare Taylor, ROTC boys, Register office, sports desk, Operettas. Kermit Hansen and Mary Jane Frances, Road Show, football and basketball games. Wonderful days!\n\nShirley E. Janke Larson | 1936\n\nI had a lot of good teachers at Central. Some I cannot remember. The one that I had the most to do with is Mr. Bedell. He was a math teacher and in charge of the stage and box office. I had math for three years, so I got pretty well acquainted with him. He would always give me a slip. I would take it to the teachers I wanted to sign up with early and then when he was signing up his students, I would help him with his registration. I also worked in the box office for him selling tickers for all of the events there. I was very popular with all the big ROTC boys when I was doing that, but after they got their tickets the popularity ceased. One time, the society folks were having some Road Show event at Central, but they were selling their tickets from the Nebraska Power Company. The lady selling the tickets got tired of sitting there, so she called Mr. Bedell to see if he knew of anyone that could come down and sell them for her. He called me and I went down for that day. She gave me two tickets for the event and my mother and I went. You can imagine how I felt sitting there in ordinary good clothes when every one else had formals and furs on. One other thing I remember about my association with Mr. Bedell was that he had to leave his class one time to do something that was an emergency for a production and he had me be the teacher. Not because I was any smarter or better than anyone, but I worked for him on different things. Lucky his room was on the first floor, as the boys had me on the window ledge and were saying they were going to push me out. Some way they changed their mind. Mr. Bedell was a very good teacher and so kind to everyone. I have a lot of good memories from my days at Central.\n\nDom Campagna | 1937\n\nAn excellent staff (especially English teachers), friendship with Fred Hill, the wooden steps to slide down below, the annual stage affairs, and an excellent education.\n\nTom Fike | 1937\n\nMy participation in the old Cadet Regiment under Mr. Gulgard has left me with some of my fondest memories. The cadet camp at Valley and the Officer's Ball at the end of Senior year make me long to turn the clock back.\n\nCharlotte Utt Floyd | 1937\n\nThe memories are many: everyone special, squeaky wood floors, and wooden lockers. A very exceptional English department, and the best foundation one could have and remember. My years at Central were some of the happiest, and I value the education I received. I treasure the lasting friends made there. I have a picture of the school in my home.\n\nKenneth Hanst | 1937\n\nTHANKS to Central! I was Class of '37 but left in Oct of '35 when my father was ordered from then Ft. Crook to Ft. Leavenworth. Ella May Phelps & Pearl Judk were two super teachers. (2 years of Spanish and a start at French under the former!). Classmates Merrill Rohobaugh & Phil Hooser joined me at West Point on 2 July 1938 all of us in the same cadet company! Phil made it through but was killed in WW II. My experience in the Central High Cadet Corps paid off where I was picked to lead groups at West Point. To my sorrow, my military career ended when I lost a leg in Germany in WW II.\n\nRaymond Koontz | 1937\n\nThe new gym, Coach Knapple & Chuck Justice, the open center court, the Storz boys driving a car up the west entrance steps, the friendliness of the students to an Ames, Iowa transfer student in 1936, Papa Schmidt & the 1936, 1937 track teams, talking to Mickey Rooney when \"Boys' Town\" was filmed, the excellent education I received and a beautiful building.\n\nBetty Dodds Meyer | 1937\n\nNot having to take P.E. and not having to take Latin a second year!\n\nElisabeth Ormsby O’Mara | 1937\n\nI remember Bess Bozell. A charming lady and a good French teacher.\n\nAngeline Pomidoro Pennisi | 1937\n\nThe teachers were great, especially Ms. Mahoney and my English teacher. They were great years.\n\nVirginia Lee Pratt | 1937\n\nAs a student, I have fond memories of Miss West, Miss Burns, Miss Griffin, Mr. Hill, Pappa Schmidt, Mr. Masters, Mr. Nelson, Mr. Knapple, all great teachers and staff and too many other memories to list.\n\nRobert Robertson | 1937\n\nSeason of 1934 we won City Championship and beat Tech for the first time in many years 12 to 0 and I had the privilege of scoring both touchdowns.\n\nEarle Sherman | 1937\n\n\"Eyes RIGHT\" for the cadet regiments. Gulgard and Sgt. Moore who gave us a glimpse of military life before WWII just four years after graduating from CHS in '37. Dr. Eddy Conners pouring oil into his parents' old 1918 Buick carburetor to send out a smokescreen as wide as the new West Dodge \"freeway\" back in the early thirties, from 50th and Dodge Streets to Happy Hollow golf course. Mickey Rooney cavorting on Dodge Street at Elmwood, making \" Father Flanigan's BOYSTOWN\", with CHS extras. The super contribution of Virginia Lee Pratt (our contemporary) teaching math for thirty years to CHS students. She should be recognized with a cornerstone, a monument and a dozen roses each day to grace her table. The fraternity/sorority system of CHS was unique and at its best, contributed much to participants in learning how to socialize.\n\nMary Francis Taylor | 1937\n\nI had an English teacher who taught me to address people with gratitude - good people that is!\n\nBarbara Wenstrand Abernathy | 1938\n\nI actually graduated from Brownell, but I attended Central for 2 years and have always considered this splended school as my alma mater! Brownell was my mother's idea since they were trying to build up their enrollment, and offered me a scholarship! I enjoyed Brownell, but my heart was always at Central: Our son, Bill, graduated from Central in 1961.\n\nRuth Stein Fox | 1938\n\nThe grooved steps, the football games, the many friends, and just being a part of Central High School.\n\nRuthgayle Griffin Gilliland-Morris | 1938\n\nPlaying basketball. Once, I asked our principal if I could skip school for one semester. She said, \"Yes.\" But my mother said \"No.\" I slept in all my study halls, and I thought that it wasn't so good; but now when I think about it, it was good!\n\nEugene McAdams | 1938\n\nTeacher Marian Mortensen was my sister-in-law. I can't remember the name, but I remember the great teacher who taught Business Law.\n\nRuth Thorup Nielsen | 1938\n\nAfter teaching at Tech for 19 years, I became a visiting teacher and enjoyed my assigments at Central. The CHS staff was great to work with.\n\nCarlyle (Lyle) E. Wilson | 1938\n\nI have so many good memories of Central High School, but I mainly remember the great and wonderful teachers we had! When I went to college, I hardly had to study the first two years because of everything we learned while at Central. I remain close friends with Lee Seemann to this day and we used to play football and basketball together at Central. My wife, Virginia and Willa Seemann grew up across the street from each other and still remain close friends, as well.\n\nWava Helme Carl | 1939\n\nCentral High Road Shows\n\nMarjorie (Marge) R. Hickey Rivett | 1939\n\nMrs. Pitts and the A Cappella Choir, Mrs. Savidge and \"the Register\", and the library where I met my husband of 56 years (we had a very happy live together). I've always been proud to have graduated from Central High!\n\nEugene P. Jorgensen | 1939\n\nSarah A. Ryan; F.H. Gulgard; F.Y. Knapple; George W. Thatcher; O.J. Franklin; Mary L. Angood; Sgt. L.O. Wyatt; E. Kiewit; Boys' Rifle Team, Operas and the Road Shows; Note: I'm in my 84th year, and my kids still say I'm the 'meanest man on earth.'\n\nSebastian Manzitto | 1939\n\nI was a member of the Central High baseball team. In 1938 and 1939 we won city and state campionships. In 1939 I was named on the Central High School baseball Hall of Fame. A great feeling when I think back sixty or so years.\n\nBetty Baysdorfer Moucka | 1939\n\nJust enjoyed the opportunity to attend a fine school and roller skating in the halls with two friends in an attempt to qualify for an act in the Road Show.\n\nBess (Beth) L. Perlmeter Lefitz | 1939\n\nThe high caliber of the teaching staff. They influenced my life a great deal.\n\nRichard (Pooky) A. Peters | 1939\n\nA \"poem\" for CHS: Omaha Central High . . My Alma Mater Will never falter To graduate enmasse Students with class. - Perched on a rise With teachers wise Developing readers To become leaders. - Flashing the big \"O\" Everyone will know We are number one With honors we have won. - Almni fill the papers With various capers One of these players Is great Gale Sayers. - Henry Fonda took the stage Filling every front page An Oscar in his hand While audiences applaud and stand. - Saul Kripke hit his peak What scientists still seek Many others have acclaim Too many here to name. - Rackem, sackem, soakem, pokem Central High now has spoken With standard reaching the moon As others stand by and just fume.\n\nElaine Frank Richards | 1939\n\nA CHS alum tidbit: Marian Pehle Haggman (Class '32) and Elaine Frank Saunders Richards (Class '39) did not know each other -- until each moved into Classic Residence by Hyatt in Scottsdale, Arizona. Now, as neighbors, they have reminisced about Central High and have developed an enduring friendship.\n\nJean E. Andersen Swarr | 1940\n\nYears later, I realized the quality of teaching!\n\nHarvey Burstein | 1940\n\nMy many fond memories of my four years at CHS couldn't possibly be written about in this limited space. Where would I even start? Mr. Masters, the \"old\" Cadet Corps, ROTC, the Road Show, my teachers, Fred Hill and Frank Knapple. And two of my fondest and most pleasurable memories of my four years at CHS are of two spring semester activities: The Roadshow and Cadet Officers' Ball. Participation in the former was so much fun and the latter was the social event each spring! Truthfully, although a published author (with lots of credit to CHS) I'd still be hard pressed to express the extent to which Central has impacted my life personally and professionally. Close friendships that exist to this day and the rigorous academic program that contributed to my career(s) remain among my fondest and most cherished memories.\n\nLouise Lundgren Dib | 1940\n\nI'm still kicking after 62 years. More power to all new grads. My friends are all gone.\n\nJohn (Jeff) G. Freymann | 1940\n\nHow \"Sarg\" Wyatt prepared a bunch of callow kids for the war he knew was coming.\n\nMarjorie Baker Lord | 1940\n\nWaiting for the \"Register\" on Friday mornings. The way Joslyn turned pink in the rain. The Crack Squad and the Road Shows. All English classes and all History classes. I guess just being there.\n\nRalph Morocco | 1940\n\nThe old Central High Cadet Corps with the West Point uniforms. We used to have reviews on the East lawn and pass in review on 20th Street between Dodge and Davenport. Road Shows with Nuncio Pomidoro playing his famous clarinet and getting tremendous ovations from the crowd. Those were definitely great times and will never be forgotten!\n\nBeverly Shields Brown | 1941\n\nSinging in the A Cappella Choir for three years, which included being in the casts of the Operas and Road Shows. At age 77 I am still singing!\n\nNorma Reichstadt Diebold | 1941\n\nGerman with that delighful little Italian lady, Delizia Rindone. Also English I with Helen Sommers and her Style Book for Grammar.\n\nMildred Fishberg Feidman | 1941\n\nI enjoyed years of being in A Cappella Choir.\n\nGeorge Grimes | 1941\n\nEverything about Central High was good.\n\nOlga Lacina Hock | 1941\n\nBeing one of the \"train of little ladies\" in the Mikado under Elsie H. Swanson. Knowing Josephine Frisbie, Sara Vore Taylor, and Miss Helen Lane, who taught Biology. The Crack Squad in the Road Show. Going to Kansas City with the choir. Meeting Helen LeBaron Eastlack, friends to this day now including Ned Eastlack. Giving me a great education which made universities easy. Bless that Style Book, written by Sara Vore Taylor! After the war, I was offered a teaching position by Mr. Hill. I had to decline, but what an honor I'll always value.\n\nPhyllis Freymann Koopman | 1941\n\nThe teachers, the structure, my very tolerant locker mate.\n\nJohn Lee | 1941\n\nMrs. Jensen, a popular teacher with an impressive personality. Her Music Appreciation class was always a lively forum of opera, symphony and piano recital-but also disucssions on salemanship, politics and sports. She once admonished a varsity football palyer who was in our class for unnecessary roughness in the last week's encounter. \"Savy\" to everything important that was happening at Central, she came down hard on the famous singer John Charles Thomas after an evening performance at Central High auditorium. The singer (stopping abruptly in the middle of an aria as a streetcar could be heard rounding a curve back of the school) announced to the aduience: \"do the streetcars in Omaha have square wheels?\" Mrs. Jensen's indignation was supported by both her class as well as the World Herald! An Unforgettable English teacher- accompanied in to first hour class each morning by her impeccably dressed husband who always gave her a tender kiss before leaving. The class, inevitably sparked by this show of affection, was constantly enveloped by an aura of beautiful warmth. Always smiling and speaking in a lovely song-like voice, I can still recite much of Tennyson's Idylls of the King because of her. Sergeant Wyatt- The R.O.T.C. head instructor was a World War I veteran of the battlefield's of France who spoke in muffled, clipped tones and often employed interesting colloquil expressions of that \"doughboy\" era. Once recalls something that sounded like \"maw-nee-cago\" in reference to anything smacking of dilettanism-which he was certainly against. Unusually demanding on the R.O.T.C. band, he could nevertheless be always found at Central High football games in his \"civies\" sitting quietly and unobtrusive with his wife in the stands back of us. Underneath the crusty personality was a caring, generous, kind and loyal soul to anyone who had occasion to approach him. Don Libby- Taking over from Mr. Cox as band instructor in 1939 this unusually clean-cut handsome teacher fresh out of Creighton University was dignified, soft spoken, witty and urbane. Told by Sergean Wyatt the day before a major parade review (including the R.O.T.C. band) that he would be required to wear a uniform-Mr. Libby had to do some real scrambling with the band standing at attention (or rather leaning because of the sloping terrain of the lawn in front) we all waited nervously for Mr. Libby to appear. With only minutes to go he suddenly popped out of the band room and took his position in front of the band wearing his dazzling light blue Creighton University R.O.T.C. officers uniform looking every bit as dashing and glamorous as Errol Flynn. Nuncio Pomidoro- A bigger-than-life super role model, all-state football lineman, heavy weight wrestling champion. A superb musician, he was student leader of the R.O.T.C. band. We were all immensely proud of him as he lead the band in many downtown parades-a strapping big fellow swinging his baton with real class. Kind, generous, modest and always a smiling ball of sunshine. The Marine band concert at Central High by the famous organization from Washington, D.C. in 1940. Acting as one of two R.O.T.C. honor guards and instructed to not let any of the public backstage after the concert- I acted the \"heavy\"-pushing at the door to keep enthusiasts out. Finally securing it tight, I turned away only to hear a few minutes later a tiny rap. The curious fire-breathing guard impatiently swung open the door to bark at a would-be intruder once more only to face a harmless, kindly looking figure who said quietly \"I only wanted to thank the band for playing my song.\" (\"Omaha\"-written by a local citizen I believe for the Golden Spike Days events) With the air gushing out of my inflated ego bag I quickly ushered him in.\n\nShirley Sherman Martin | 1941\n\nAll of the many good friends I had during my high school days, and also excellent teachers. Then, there were the great plays and musicals staged by the drama and music departments. I often wish I had kept my English \" Style Book.\"\n\nDale Mielke | 1941\n\nThis memory was submitted by Dale's daughter: A chance encounter and Central High School changed my father's destiny. As he was walking to school on his first day of high school he crossed paths with a friend of his. Dad asked him where he was going and the friend replied \"Central, where are you going?\" Dad replied that he was going to Tech, and went on to ask his friend if he would want to go to Tech with him. His friend quickly replied that his parents would not go for that, but then asked Dale if he would go to Central with him. This was probably around 1935 and pre-registration was not needed, so Dad said \"Okay\" and that's where he graduated from. Now skip ahead to after World War II, where Dad was the co-owner of a small diner. Guys he knew would come in and talk about going off to college. Dad knew they weren't any smarter than he was, yet when they asked him about going to college he replied that he didn't think he could get in. They then proceeded to tell him that OF COURSE he was going to get in because he went to Central and that was a college prep school. So he applied. Then, after three and a half years of day school, night school, and summer school, Dad had a Master's Degree and went on to work at a High School, where he taught, coached, and counseled (he was one of the US's first High School counselors) and he LOVED IT.\n\nIrving Rector | 1941\n\nMr. G., Ms. Frisbee, Mr. Hill, Ms. Fawthrop, Ms. Jenkins, Ms. Griffin, Ms.Taylor, Ms. West, Ms. Engel, Sgt.

History - Elizabeth Kiewit. French - Bess Bozell. I liked Catherine Blanchard in the library. She was very pleasant and helpful. I'm glad that I had some strict teachers at Central.

Acting as an aide to our Civics teacher during the last hour of the day. I wish I had picked her brain when she studied the stock market. (I also wish I could remember her name!)

Brown Brewer | 1942\n\nParticipating in the A Cappella Choir with Elsie Swanson.\n\nMargaret Hughes Duntley | 1942\n\nBesides the \"carefree\" high school days we knew, Alice West, my English teacher, has always held a place in my high school memories. She wasn't warm and fuzzy, especially for some students, but she was a great teacher. She had high expectations for us - like it or not.\n\nBarbara Boien Erickson | 1942\n\nMs. Maybel Burns in room 121 was the very best Math teacher around! I had her for seven of eight semesters and loved every minute of it. A Cappella Choir for three years. Going up four flights of stairs, eating lunch, then back to class in twenty minutes.

National Honor Society.\n\nRaymond Gould | 1942\n\nIn my day we had three very fine musical groups and generally, unless you were already gifted, you had to pass thru all three. These were Junior Glee Club, Senior Glee Club, and finally A Cappella Choir. I went thru all three as one of my major extra curricular activities, and in '41 and '42 was privileged to be in A Cappella. In those days too, we had state and national choral conventions and competitions we participated in. Central had an exceptional choir director at that time named, as I recall: Miss Pitts. And the year before I was able to join, our A Cappella placed second in a national competition to a California group, though many there felt we were number one. We had several pieces that were perennial favorites we sang year after year and two of these were, 'Love in Grief' and 'Listen to the Lambs', as I recall. We lost Miss Pitts to a New Jersey college a few years after I left school, and Mrs. Elsie Swanson took over. I have warm memories of my last two years at Central being very active in Debate under Principal J. Arthur Nelson, and in minor roles in drama and operetta.\n\nSuzanne Rogers Hupfer | 1942\n\nOld creaky stairs, the neat courtyard, teacher's long old-fashioned dresses (especially Mrs. Rathbun - Latin).

One of my vivid memories is walking up the long flight of stairs in front of Central when we got off the street car. My encouraging mentors were Mrs. Kiewit, Mrs. Swanson, my biology teacher and my algebra (father-patient) teacher. The lunchroom, eating with friends. Competing with a special friend in foreign language class. Study hall, and the flow of notes; the bell ringing before I'd finished writing. I have always enjoyed my life, and I continue to do so.\n\nLouis Hanisch | 1943\n\nWe had wonderful school dances at the Chermont Ball Room. The operettas and Road Shows. Truly wonderful and unforgettable teachers such as Bernice Engel, Marian Treat and Geneive Clark.\n\nJoan McCague Hennecke | 1943\n\nPerhaps not a \"Fond\" memory but certainly an indelible memory was the mass meeting in the auditorium December, 1941 to hear, via radio , President Roosevelt declaring war against Japan.

I still sew and love to see beautiful clothes. Central had quality classes. My high school education has served me well in the working world and in the community.\n\nEileen Cobb Sides | 1943\n\nWe students of Mrs. Bozell thought the French course was a snap. When I went out of state to college, French Class was an easy \"A\". She taught us by osmosis. As a high school teacher, I now realize that I received an excellent education at CHS.\n\nJoanne Patton Thomas | 1944\n\nMiss West's latin class, ROTC parades, graduation skip day in May '44 and we had a blizzard. My brothers' class. When Mr. G. always wore a red tie the day before he gave an exam. Walking through the quad in the snow before the cover was added.

Amanda Anderson & classes. STILL remember her punishment for chewing gum in class - probably from having had to stand in front & recite, \" A gum-chewing girl and a cud-chewing cow are somewhat alike but different somehow. A difference? Oh, yes, I see it now. The contented look on the face of the cow.\" Operettas and practices. \"Running\" for classes. \"Snow days\" when one wasn't counted absent for inattendance so nothing new was introduced, if so reintroduced on regular days. Symbol from geometry meaning \"therefore\". We had unpressured FUN! Taking bus to and from school, transfering to one to Lee's Drug Store (52nd & Leavenworth) for sodas before transferring to streetcar for home.\n\nJoe Gurnon | 1944\n\nDid you know Coach Vernon Ekfelt's real name was Johnson? He originated in Redwood Falls, Wisconsin. His father was so mad at the post office for getting the wrong mail, he got even by changing his name. Guess there were just too many Johnson's around Redwood Falls.\n\nVirginia Purdham Hanisch | 1944\n\nWe had wonderful school dances at the Chermont Ball Room. The operettas and Road Shows. Truly wonderful and unforgettable teachers such as Bernice Engel, Marian Treat and Geneive Clark.\n\nDarlene Nelson Malm | 1944\n\nWhat a building, what a school! I chose to go there - in those days we had a choice. Those of you who volunteer your time, you are indeed special. Central High was my choice because of music and choice of friends. Dear Ms. Elsie Howe (Swanson) Jensen, she did not have to speak, one got her message from her eyes.\n\nVivian Smith Meyer | 1944\n\nMiss West selecting MY theme to read aloud to the class.

Plotkin | 1944\n\nAll of my best memories are of Central High! I always remember Warren Watters, Elsie Howe Swanson, and 'Pop' Schmidt. I was in orchestra 1943-1944 and in Glee Club & ACappella Choir 1942-1944. Mr. Gulgard gave me two years of Algebra in two weeks which made me eligible to enter the Univerity of Minnesota in the upper 15% in spite of my high school grades. I remember Senorita Mahoney, who promised to pass me in Spanish II if I couldn't take Spanish III.\n\nAaron Raznick | 1944\n\nChoir and Pop Schmidt.\n\nRobert Roberts | 1944\n\nI remember the old wooden lockers.\n\nJoAnn Srb Schmid | 1944\n\nChoir, Swanson, operettas, ROTC dances and friendships.\n\nJustin Simon | 1944\n\nBernice Engle, a premier Latin and English teacher who was a powerful influence.\n\nWanda Shupe Zerzan | 1944\n\nI remember choir, running for classes, lots of good friends.

I attended at a different time, all through the war years, but I remember only the warm friendships and kind teachers. I am proud to tell everyone what an excellent school Central High was! Central High was a haven for me. I lost my father in April 1942, my two brothers went off to war, and my mother and I, and my younger brother were left alone. I found great comfort in going to school, meeting my friends, and loving the teachers. It was my home away from home and I still feel great fondness for the school.\n\nDonald Brill | 1945\n\nROTC, track team and dances.\n\nRobert H. Gilinsky | 1945\n\nTeachers: Pearle Judkins, \"Pop\" Schmidt, Norman Sorensen, Virginia Lee Pratt, Principals Fred Hill and J. Arthur Nelsen. The statue of \"Winged Victory\" in the east entrance.

Couldn't have asked for a better high school! Great education, memorable teachers and fun friends and activities! P.S. The cafeteria made fabulous meatballs with tomato sauce.\n\nEunice Feldman Denenberg | 1946\n\nHow to explain to today's teens (even the designation \"teen-ager\" was new in 1942) the heart-pounding immensity of declaring, \"I'm going to high school?\" The building was cavernous, its wooden lockered walls enclosing us in a strange, exciting world. Four floors. Each class in a different room with a different teacher. Boys stairs, girls stairs, homework, study halls. Teachers offering fascinating ideas, expecting high levels of work, inspiring us. In college, I majored in English Lit, specifically because of Alice West. I had English right after lunch and Miss West's room, windows wide open, always held a mysterious trace of perfume and smoke. With her demanding methods and unique hairdo of over-the-ears poufs, she was a treasure who made reading Shakespeare aloud thrilling. Pearl Judkins' class, however, was a different story. Not until Halloween did I feel the EUREKA! moment of, \"I get it!\" Mr. Gulgard made physics fun and re-named me \"Fifi,\" to which I still respond. Dear Mr. G sent many of us birthday cards for years after graduation. Teachers like these, plus Ms. Savidge, Bessie Rathbun, Elsie Swanson, Jo Frisbie and Virginia Lee Pratt guided us toward ever-broadening experiences. In Central's ethnically and financially diverse community we were no longer sheltered; no longer children, we became \"people.\" My locker was on the third floor outside Harold Eggen's biology class. A perfect location, because I was smitten by his blond Nelson Eddy looks, plus I had a crush on a boy who dashed by me on his way to the 4th floor track practice. So many snippets of feel-good memories. As a feature writer for the Register, I interviewed Eleanor Roosevelt during her visit to Omaha. Singing \"Personality\" in the Road Show swathed in a charteuse crepe get-up with my purple clad cohort, Charlotte Katzman Zipursky. A startling duo. Saddle shoes were the footwear of the forties, but you needed to dirty them to be truly cool. Dickies and pleated skirts and jerkins, and of course, bobby sox. The solemn ritual of organizing notebooks, pencils and textbooks was as important to me as any CEO outfitting her office. I am grateful for my Central education. Central High was a perfect life preparatory school. I loved every minute.\n\nDorothy Saalfeld Deuser | 1946\n\nMy high school memories are much cherished and many. Some good, some not so good, but all very important in my journey of faith!\n\nRichard Duda | 1946\n\n\"Dick has always talked about the wonderful friends he made while attending Central\".

Ostronic Slogr | 1949\n\nBeing on the tumbling squad under Mr.Crown's direction. Working for Mr. Knapple in my freshman & sophmore years.

Central earned its reputation for educational excellence, because of faculty members like Miss McBride. She had a rare gift for teaching, bringing her wit and knowledge to her classroom, enriching students' lives by imparting to them an enduring appreciation of literature and the luster of the English language. Embedded in the minds of all of us who were fortunate enough to have been one of her students, she is affirmation that a \"teacher touches the future.\"\n\nMary Moberg | 1951\n\nBeing nurse's (Mrs. Dwyer) helper and watching Centralites come to the nurse's office with aches and pains (some real, most an excuse to get out of class or go home). Wearing golf dresses, bobby socks with saddle shoes, cashmere sweaters (not all of us), and \"little\" collars.\n\nJames Olsen | 1951\n\nPutting out the Register, friendships, sports, running for classes. Frank Rice (English teacher) once gave a sketchy description of an exciting or juicy part of a novel he had read, then said maybe we were too young to read that sort of a thing. I checked it out of the public library the next day! My introduction to James Thurber. As a high school Engligh teacher myself, I used this same \"trick\" to motivate.\n\nJacqueline Gaskill Peterson | 1951\n\nGreat teachers - Mrs. Turrin, Ms. Angood, Ms. Treat- , strong scholastic foundation, lasting friendships and club activities.\n\nLetha Zalkin Pitlor | 1951\n\nCafeteria, lots of steps, steps dipped like big soup bowls, sitting in lockers, talking to friends and the cheer and standing ovation when Retha and I got our Diplomas.\n\nThomas Roberts | 1951\n\nMr. \"G\" and his three fingers in the air- \"You're Out.\" I struck \"out\" three times for talking- He was hard, but fair.\n\nIsabelle Herr Schenk | 1951\n\nThe friends I made in High School who are still my friends all these years later! Also that old building that had so much character compared to schools today. Bess Bozell - what a sweetheart she was.\n\nShirley Johnson Thornby | 1951\n\nThe Greek statues with painted toenails. Myrna Vance Jones, drama teacher, drove a Morris car and the boys would carry it off the street and into the courtyard. Myself being amazed that Miss Weymuller, the librarian, had a degree from Columbia. I just thought she was a \"bouncer.\"\n\nBetty Youngman McMahill | 1951\n\nWandering through the \"Attic\" enroute to the cafeteria, studying Macbeth, the clarity of English Style Book. It has stood the test of time, and I have reintroduced it to many \"wannabe\" writers.\n\nDona Wells Andersen | 1952\n\nSwannee & the choir - voice class & productions did for me what sports does for some! The amazing English department. Sara Vore Taylor's Style Book and the entire structured curriculum. Mr. Perry - Geometry without pain and as a friend. Miss Lanes sophomore biology Class '\"Yes - uh hum\" AND of course DEAR Ruth Pilling.\n\nNelson Barber | 1952\n\nTeachers and a quality education\n\nBarbara Ringle Black | 1952\n\nThe Road Show. The Senior Play. Making friends that have been life long. Getting the best education and college preparation.\n\nMarcia Morris Blacker | 1952\n\nThe standard of excellence!!\n\nAnne Thompson Fuller | 1952\n\nI remember being in the Senior class play, the friends, and having Miss Pilling as friend and counselor. Great education was provied by outstanding teachers and counselors. Hope the grads of today are well prepared.\n\nRichard Glasford | 1952\n\nThe angora sweaters the girls wore!\n\nL. Boyd Green | 1952\n\nThe music - Road Shows, Band and Choir. A really good education. We were well prepared for life. Meeting each other!\n\nChester Harris | 1952\n\nInvolvement in the Jr. ROTC program. Being co-commander of the renown Crack Squad and a lead in the senior play.\n\nAnnette Davis Johnson | 1952\n\nMaking new friends during High School days.\n\nKaren McKie Kersten | 1952\n\nHomeroom with Miss Pilling in her office. Hanging out in Miss Mortensen's classroom, preparing for the debate trips. Classes with Amy Sutton. Mrs. Turpin, who tirelessly taught us all to write coherently and gave us a love of literature. Ms. Bozell and going to class and French movies with L'Alliance Francaise.\n\nRobert McCardell | 1952\n\nOutside of the athletic programs and the great parties following the football games, I'll always have fond memories of the dances at Peony Park. Sorry to hear it is no longer there.\n\nDarlene Oliver Monteaux | 1952\n\nThe choir and operettas.\n\nEmmanuel Papadakis | 1952\n\nProving the mutual perpendicular between two skew lines over the phone with Bill Denny for Miss Pratt's solid geometry course. Receiving a phone call from the Science Service announcing winning a Washington trip in the 11th annual Westinghhouse Science Talent Search.\n\nDean Short | 1952\n\nRoad Show\n\nGloria Zadina Storch | 1952\n\nAll four years at Central were great.\n\nJudith Tully Bercovici | 1952\n\nWorking on the Register and singing in operas.\n\nFranklyn Berg | 1953\n\nAll the friends that I made while at Central High. Too many to name each.\n\nJanice Day Besch | 1953\n\nFlirting in study halls. Pasting stickers from the dance on my notebook. Mrs. Tauchen. Mr. Perry. Military Ball. All the dances at Peony Park. I graduated!\n\nKeith Besch | 1953\n\nI met Janice Day in my Freshman year and never dated anyone but Janice. We married graduation year 1953. We'll celebrate 50 years of marriage in June 2003. I did graduate. I took a little time and waited for Janice. My favorite teachers: Angeline Tauchen, Ms. McBride, Ms. McConnell.\n\nStanley Burstein | 1953\n\nPlaying in the Central High Band and ROTC Band and Central High Orchestra with Mr. Bartholomew.\n\nArnold Epstein | 1953\n\nRunning from the band room to the social studies library in room 425!\n\nMarvin Gilman | 1953\n\nTeachers: Mr. Perry, Mrs. Turpin, Miss Clark. Choir with Swannee. Operettas: The Milkado. (I still know all the music and words!)\n\nElaine Ehrenreich Jullai | 1953\n\nFrench with Madame Bozell, English with Mrs. Turpin, Journalism with Mrs. Savidge. Dances and the great stickers. Musical productions. My friends. Privilege of attending a great, diverse school.\n\nDoris Raduziner Marks | 1953\n\nMiss McBride!\n\nRobert Silhasek | 1953\n\nEVERY DAY!\n\nWayne Simpson | 1953\n\nPhysics class where Mr. Busch told me \"whatever grade I got in Physics at Central, my grade would be lower at UNL.\" He ws right. Mr. Busch is buried in Blair Cemetery. And to Mr. Miller, who taught me geometry, and it stuck. Whatever happened to Mr. Miller?\n\nGuy Smith | 1953\n\nThe friends I met.\n\nRoberta Seger Sullivan | 1953\n\nAn excellent year taught by Miss Helen Lane (Biology I) and four excellent years of English taught by Miss Alice West.\n\nSandra Cheyne Gillotte | 1954\n\nI just remember the fine English teachers I was fortunate to have. I'm thinking, in particular, of Miss McBride. We had many great discussions over the books we read in her class, My Antonia and the classic Tale of Two Cities. Also, we groaned over diagraming sentences. The Central High Style Book was an instruction manual we were issued our freshman year, and we kept it as reference to grammar and punctuation for all four years. I used a facsimile in my own teaching career of 34 years. A fun memory, for me, is being a hall monitor at lunchtime, and being able to gossip about the latest dance turn out or who is going steady, or who is breaking up. Real important stuff for the time being.\n\nM. Ronald Brodkey | 1954\n\nThe unique feeling of friendship I had with my Black friends and other ethnic groups which has extended my entire life here in Omaha! A lasting respect that Central High fostered throughout my 4 years.\n\nJudy Cohn | 1954\n\nAll my wonderful friends - lifelong friends.\n\nJaney Weiner Dann | 1954\n\nClassmates, teachers, the Road Show.\n\nLawrence Epstein | 1954\n\nI have fond memories of everything and still love those memories: Turkel, Bernstein, Gillespie, Hamans, Moshier, Holmes, the whole crew!\n\nMary Curtis Erixon | 1954\n\nSinging in the choir and taking part in the operettas and Road Shows.\n\nEdward Gansz | 1954\n\nStudy Halls. Football games. ROTC. Dances at Peony Park. Notebook stickers. Peanut butter fudge in the cafeteria. Several teachers. All those good looking girls.\n\nElly Peter Gardner | 1954\n\nMr. J. Arthur Nelson chose me to ride on top of the float for Central High . I believe the occasion was Omaha'a Centennial celebration. It was a real thrill and honor.\n\nRobert Hayes | 1954\n\nAlice West - English 1950-52, a singularly unique woman - in dress, mannerisms, speech, termperament and ABILITY! Homeroom with Mrs. Blanchard in Room 425 during 1950-51. Cafeteria - not fond, but memorable! Segregated stairways for boys and girls. Hallways and the smell of packed lunches, old wood getting older, and eagerness to learn.\n\nJoan Shepard Hayes | 1954\n\nSock dances, football games, operaettas, dances at Peony Park.\n\nBernadine Grasso Markel | 1954\n\nMy classmates & teachers! I still have contact with so many and have helped on class reunions and gotten to know many more. Amy Sutton and the theatre department were so helpful to me.\n\nFred Nelson | 1954\n\nWith three nameless friends, running around the entire school on the LEDGE above the THIRD (top) floor! Most of my teachers. Playing in the band and orchestra (also being the drum major my senior year). Dating \"Miss Central\", Kay Jorgenson.\n\nCarol McBride Pirsch | 1954\n\nChoir, orchestra, and Road Shows.\n\nGeorgiann Thomas Rapp | 1954\n\nI remember the fantastic Road Shows & Operettas. They are especially vivid in my memories. Josephine Frisbie was a favorite teacher of mine. She helped me go on to college at Colorado College. I have fond memories of her kindness.\n\nAlan Rosen | 1954\n\nBeing on football, wrestling and track teams, ROTC, also bookkeeping class (am now CPA), and typewriting class, which has been very useful, Amy Sutton, Norm Sorensen, J. Arthur Nelson and Frank Knapple.\n\nLawrence (Red) Thomas | 1954\n\nThe best \"EDUCATION\" for me at CHS was back in the 50's and I hope today as well, Central had great academic quality but my fondest memories were the \"locker room\" educational experiences and friendships will be remembered always. They provided enirching opportunities to learn about a diversity of friends that were available there and also the importance of performance-based evaluations. I have always felt enriched by these experiences; plus, it was great fun.\n\nN’Zingah Al-Shams | 1955\n\nI remember J.A. Nelson, principal of Central in 1955 and how he truly cared about the reputation of the school.\n\nPeggy Kuntzelman Doane | 1955\n\nThe choir, opera, and Road Show. Some of the greatest teachers. I made some friendships that have been life-long.\n\nVirginia Harris Rosberg | 1955\n\nI owe my deepest gratitude to my English and chemistry and math teachers . They guided me along and did not give up on me, especially my chemistry teacher! I earned an \"A\" from him the second time around! He wanted me to learn to teach chemistry, but I decided to be a registered Nurse with a \"BSH\" Degree instead! I had a good ground from all my Central High teachers for my college years.\n\nMarilyn Rice Hurwitz | 1955\n\nMrs. Turpin. All my friends.\n\nKarla Koenig Kleck | 1955\n\nMrs. Turpins' English class, sock dances, pep assemblies, Operettas, music.\n\nJoan Krasne Marcus | 1955\n\nI remember running from the band room (in the basement) to the lunchroom on the fourth floor. Also, kids smoking in the bathrooms on the landings. Those four years were the happiest of my life. People who go to other schools are envious of our experience.\n\nJuanita Wells McCartney | 1955\n\nThe people I met there. Choir.\n\nBob Forrest | 1955\n\nWentworth Clarke, Teacher, for his founding and sponsorship of the school's Outdoor Club and for the memorable adventures and mentoring. Dr. Clarke is currently spending time between his home in Hiawassee, GA, and Belgarde, ME (2012).\n\nJoan Beninato Gentzler | 1956\n\nA Cappella Choir with \"Swanee,\" the courtyard, Road Show, Mr. Marquiss' biology class, Mrs. Blancharde's 9th hours. Walking around each floor before classes, pep rallies, dances, the operettas. Fourth floor lunchroom (lots of fun times), great memories and an excellent education!\n\nJames Goermar | 1956\n\nI fondly remember my mentor, Norm Sorenson (History Teacher & Wrestling & Track coach). His most inspiring words were, \"Anyone can be a good loser. All you have to do is show up.\" That put winning in perspective, and his many championship teams reflected his philosophy.\n\nJames Kayser | 1956\n\nJ. Arthur Nelson standing on a landing at lunch time to stop us from running upstairs to the cafeteria. Fear of getting \"canned\" as a freshman in the large trash cans. The wind whistling around the building in the winter. The large trash burner smokestack on the west side of the building (now gone). Swanee's blue hair. Collecting coins to pay for traffic tickets. Not realizing how good an education I received at Central until I got to college.\n\nBonnie Haykin Pike | 1956\n\nThe building itself and its location. Some of the teachers: Ruth Pilling, James Karabatsos, Miss Castello. And, of course, my wonderful friendships.\n\nLee Simon | 1956\n\nGreat times and a great school. Made life long friends. Memories are the most important.\n\nNorma Mowrey Taylor | 1956\n\nA silly memory: I had young Mr. Murray for my senior year English class. In those years we wore very full skirts with several crinolines and sometimes hoops, also. He would walk by my desk with my skirt and crinolines sticking way out in the aisle and often comment about how he couldn't imagine anyone wearing such things. Of course the class would laugh.\n\nLeonard Wheeler | 1956\n\nI wish I had known then what a great foundation I was getting for the future. Jay Arthur Nelson, our Principal who was stern but fair. Mr Perry, my counselor who was so encouraging. Memories of Peony Park dances, ROTC, being a King's Hussar at Ak Sar Ben. So many times in college and life beyond Central I have realized how lucky I was to have graduated from such a demanding high school where \"good enough\" was just not acceptable. I see so many of my classmates have passed on but I remember them all for the good times we had at Central.\n\nSandra Givens Freeman | 1957\n\nMet my first husband sophomore year - married 21 years.\n\nJoan Marino Fucinaro | 1957\n\nAll of my friends and some very nice teachers. Loved CHS. Performing in the Roadshow's \"Unforgetables\" act with all of my senior friends. Singing in the choir, cheering in Pep Squad Club. and P.E. Being teacher's helper for gym. Going to CHS football and basketball games. P.E. Going to LaCasa's for pizza after school functions.\n\nRobert Gaumer | 1957\n\nI remember the cooperation between Central High and Tech High. In the 1956-1957 school year we were allowed to go 1/2 day to Central to finish out College Prep and 1/2 day to Tech to take vocational auto mechanics. Both experiences were invaluable for many years after our senior year!\n\nCarol Johnson Hurlburt | 1957\n\nChoir, Ms. Amy's Drama Class, performance of \"Oklahoma\" and the Road Shows.\n\nLawrence Kahn | 1957\n\nNoyes Bartholomew directing the Marching Band. Mr. Murray's German class, Mrs. Bland introducing Saul Kripke's description of \" Black Holes\" during Geometry class, being a \"Queen Own Hussar\" at the Ak-Sar-Ben Ball, playing in the Dance Band.\n\nLyle McFarlin | 1957\n\nMiss Alice West, her strict but valuable English Classes. Miss Weymueller's ninth hour for talking in study hall - loved her! Mr. Esmond crown doing handstands on the lab table on the first day of Biology class, J. Arthur Nelson's intimidating appearance when trouble was afoot, J.J. Planteen, a cool head Vice Principal, Miss Cather's tough civics classes; she was a great teacher too.\n\nEleanor Resnick Nichols | 1957\n\nThe teachers! I was allowed to work at my own pace in some classes, then given advanced material. So... (1) I got higher paying jobs for due to college credits, (2) I was exempt from having to take several college classes, (3) training for my doing the same when I became a teacher and (4) it held my interest. My mother was Zella (Cherniss) Resnick '37 and most of her cousins and siblings also went to Central. My mom's only disappointment was that her class didn't have any reunions!\n\nJessica Tagney Patton | 1957\n\nSo many memorable teachers and so little space! Tops during my years at CHS would have to be English teacher Frank Rice. His passion for literature and his high performance standards, for himself as well as his students, influenced me to follow his exemplary lead. Also, third and fourth periods voice class and choir with \"Swanie,\" operettas and Road Shows.\n\nJan Ryder Mastos | 1957\n\nMy days in A Cappella Choir, standing on the entry steps with friends, drive-thrus at Tiners, Sunday afternoons at Memorial Park, the light operas Swanee directed, \"Oklahoma!\" and talking with Mr. Eggen, my favorite teacher.\n\nDianne Fellman Schachner | 1957\n\nBiology and mechanical drawing classes. Zenaid Luhr!\n\nJerome Rosen | 1957\n\nIt's impossible for me to name my favorite teacher at Central High: however, there was what semed an interesting experience that occurred involving myself and a certain Miss Josephine Frisbie. Miss Frisbie being one of the premier English instructors ever to have walked the halls of Central, and I, sadly, one of the true underachieving students in the same field, were put on what was a tongue in cheek, collison course. The situation reached an apex when we were assigned a class theme - - - the topic to be \"What Christmas Means To Me.\" I headed my paper perfectly and carefully penned the title, and for content wrote 'Nothing, I'm Jewish.' and turned in the masterpiece. Good natured as she was, Josephine gave me an \"F\" on content and an \"A\" on spelling and punctuation. That averaged to a \"C,\" which I concluded was acceptable.\n\nPhilip Barth | 1958\n\nMoving to Omaha my sophomore year from a small community in Indiana and meeting so many kids from different walks of life - different races, religion, color. That in itself prepared me for life and gave me an education I will always cherish and remember. The whole school was a great learning experience. So sorry to hear that my favorite teacher Ed Clark passed away.\n\nJudith Church Blazek | 1958\n\nVery dear and close friends, Saul Kripke getting me through Geometry!\n\nEddith Buis | 1958\n\nThe challenge of competing with smart peers. My \"gang\" of girlfriends junior and senior years. Singing in Acapella Choir. CHS \"Register\" Staff activites (I'd hoped to be a writer).\n\nEllie Guide Carson | 1958\n\nRunning across the courtyard in the rain.\n\nLynne Chesire Kelly | 1958\n\nWearing our home-made purple corduroy burmuda shorts with white sweaters to our freshman football games. Oh, m' gosh!\n\nCarol Dworak | 1958\n\nThe wisdom of J. Arthur Nelson: \"A word to the wise is sufficient.\"\n\nSandra Sechrest Fardon | 1958\n\nGood friends; Wooden floors; Mr. Nelson (Principal); Mr. Kuncl (Business Education)\n\nMelray Fokken | 1958\n\nROTC. Being a Kings Hussar for AkSarBen Coronation. History class with Miss Cathers. Football games & basketball games - especially when Central won. Lunch - better food then.\n\nPatrick Hanrahan | 1958\n\nI would have to say, my four years at CHS, from the first day, when this Irish/Catholic boy (who has been told from birth, that Creighton Prep was it, but no one mentioned the entrance exam) was thrown (terrorized) into this nest of fearless \"Eagles\" was wonderful. I soon found out that I would make friends for life. I also found the staff and teachers were there for you, if you let them. From J. Arthur Nelson (who like my Dad, never heard of \"grey area\", there was only \"right\" or \"wrong\") to \"Old Gus\" the boy's locker room \"boss\" you were treated with respect, but you had to earn it. That is CHS, dear Central.\n\nThomas Lucht | 1958\n\nMr. Nelson. \"Time will pass, will you?\" Wood Stairs. Wood Lockers. Good meals, good teachers, good place.\n\nPaul Moessner | 1958\n\nLoved our 50th reunion last year (2008). The guys were distingushed and the women were beautiful! Even with some ruts and bumps, the road of life has been good to the Class of '58! My choicest memories of being a CHS Eagle are related to the friends I made while participating as a member of the orchestra, as an ROTC cadet, as a member of the Outdoorsman Club and other activities. CHS was also where I met my future wife, Diane Ferguson, CHS 1959, who so strongly supported my 30-year Navy career and with whom I raised four terrific children. The high standards of academic performance and personal ethics learned from great CHS teachers and staff continue to make my life successful.\n\nAllan Noddle | 1958\n\nA fabulous foundation for life, business, and social skills. An incomparable environment in which you had all opportunities for personal growth. A unique setting for the dignity and self respect of the human being.\n\nMyron Papadakis | 1958\n\nIn my old age the memory is still vivid. Sitting next to Saul Kripke and tutoring him through Physics class. Actually I owe my good grade to him. It was fun watching the teacher looking to Saul to see if Saul approved what he was teaching. Saul would nod his approval.\n\nSusan Dishon Secrest | 1958\n\nI have many memories. However, they are not nearly as important as the legacy bestowed upon me by my teachers who were not willing to let me settle for mediocrity. They pushed me far beyond what I thought I was capable of achieving. I am deeply indebted to them for the lengths to which they were willing to travel for me. Having recently retired from teaching, I hope that I have been successful in passing on to my students this attitude and passion for doing one's best. 'Good enough' just isn't good enough!\n\nMary Ann Damme Weston | 1958\n\nHarvey Saalberg's journalism class. It inspired my life's vocation.\n\nRene Ash | 1958\n\nCentral High prepared me for some basics of life. My wish at that time was to join the journalism class to no avail. It gave me more impetuts to become a writer and journalist. After graduation, I went to New York City, where my dream became a reality. Editor of a theatrical newspaper, guest columnist for Hollywood trade journals, and most of all Publicity Director of the Hollywood Technicians Trade Union. For that I have to thank my alma matter. Now I am retired in Berlin, Germany with my wife of 50 years.\n\nJames Ruegge | 1958\n\nI remember wearing the Jr ROTC uniform three days a week. Saved my parents a bunch of money in clothing cost.\n\nRichard Ahlstrand | 1959\n\nPer AA Memb Form On October 4, 1957 the Russians launched Sputknik, the world's first satellite. I remember principal Jay Arthur Nelson calling an emergency meeting of the entire school auditorium to announce this feat. He emphasized what a threat this was to the (then at the height of the Cold War). He advised us all to study hard, especially math and science. This event emphasized the long-standing wonderful academic tradition of CHS. It sounds a bit strange today, but at the time it was his response to that world event. He had keen insight. -Richard A. Ahlstrand, M.D., FACS '59\n\nMorris Brodkey | 1959\n\nAs I think back on it, I remember my friends. I don't remember the classes or the activities much. I miss the friends.\n\nJudith Plattner Brodsky | 1959\n\nRoad Show, lunch room, and the first day of school.\n\nBarbara Bercutt Fishkin | 1959\n\nSinging in \"Swanee's\" Choirs, performing in plays, operettas, Road Shows. Dances at Peony Park, playing in the orchestra, separate stairways. \"A word to the wise is sufficient!\" (a favorite expression used often by J. Arthur Nelson, Principal)\n\nLouis Gorr | 1959\n\nTo this day I remember being captivated by Mr. Ed Clark and his teaching of Shakespeare. There he was in his bow tie and buttoned-up tweed jacket, the perfect gentleman. But more importantly, he knew how to enjoy Shakespeare -- and he knew how to get others to as well. I went on to graduate school where I got an MA in English, and took four seminars in Shakespeare -- thanks to him. He was a teacher's teacher and made me realize that there is much beauty in the world that is our's for the asking.\n\nGerald Kohout | 1959\n\nWalking the halls before school started.\n\nKaren Grahnquist Lawson | 1959\n\nHigh quality of teachers. Really caring counselors (Miss Pratt) and teachers such as Zenaide Luhr, Norm Kirschenbaum, Jim Karabatsos, Ed Clark, Virginia Lee Pratt. Mr. Nelson coming to study halls to announce that college reps were there - his enthusiasm about smaller liberal art colleges.\n\nJim Leslie | 1959\n\nA Great School!\n\nLaurie Moriarty McCann | 1959\n\nFond now but scary then: Needing to practice after school for military ball and needing to be at opera practice at the same time. Swanee was scary. Warm memories: Mrs. McKean's Homeroom; Mrs. McCarter for geometry; Alice Buffett for Home Economics. I was the only senior; she made home visits to watch us prepare a meal and serve it!; Mr. Fields for Chemistry; Mr. Eggen for Biology - meeting my best friend, Diane Barker White to ride the bus to school and read Peyton Place in the back of the bus!\n\nEllen Schroeder | 1959\n\nGreat Memories!\n\nRozanne Siporin Stein | 1959\n\nFriends. Ed Clark's English classes. Miss Pilling's Latin classes - the Latin Banquet. Plays. Road Show. Study Hall. Miss Pratt's math classes. Girl's State Rep for CHS. Football games. Working on the Register and O Book. Mr. Crown's Biology classes - dissecting frogs. My Antonia, Tale of Two Cities, Hamlet, Chaucer. Mr. Lubman's Government class.\n\nWillard Wright | 1960\n\nBoth of my parents - LeRoy Wright 1932 & Margaret Dickerson Wright 1930 and myself…..Willard Wright 1960….are graduates of Central High School. I went on to earn three college degrees…..University of Nebraska BS 1965..Bradley University MBA..1973 and Northern Illinois DBA..1998.\n\nPeter Bartling | 1960\n\nAcademics, extra curricular activities, social interactions, faculty and facilities. The people...the programs...the endless possibilities. CHS truly manifested the American dream. The education my sister Pam and I received enabled us both, in our different ways, to contribute to the greater social good and enjoy life. No limits no boundaries. The best of our youth was spent at, and represented by Central High School.\n\nPamela Bartling Buffett | 1960\n\nMy most wonderful memory and long-lasting gift was the great social interaction that took place among the extraordinary people with whom my twin brother, Peter Bartling, and I attended CHS with - the life lessons of Central will be with me for a lifetime.\n\nDon Ecklund | 1960\n\nAs a sociologist and college professor, I have often noted and marveled at how fortunate I was to attend Central in the 1950's where I was educated in an outstanding naturally integrated high school. This was a time when racially integrated schools were not the norm. My fellow students were not only racially diverse, but also came from a wide range of religious traditions and social class backgrounds. I am pleased that this tradition continues at Central, even as wealthy families move their children to suburban schools in many other cities.\n\nRoy Katskee | 1960\n\nFirst day of school Sept. 1956 walking up the west entrance with my brown bag for lunch and seeing nothing but unfamiliar faces. Half scared out of my wits. Willie Nared asking me for a dime every day at lunch. Being able to play for Frank Smagacz & Jim Karabatsos who refused to let us lose. Having team mates like Roger Sayers, Johnny Nared, Gayle Sayers, Rodney Moore, Bobby Ginsberg, Jimmy Hall, Bruce Hunter, Vernon Breakfield, Bill Horwich, Al Stolarskj, Donnie Fiedler, just to name a few. You couldn't get experiences like we had anywhere else in Nebraska. The most unusual character to grace the halls of Central in my 4 years was Clarence \"Butch\" Caster. By far the most entertaining and charismatic guy I have ever met.\n\nDoris Lockhart Langenegger | 1960\n\nA freshman put a frog in my lunch bag. Mr. Nystrom caught me with gum in my mouth.\n\nKaren Forbes Meyer | 1960\n\nGreat school with great teachers. Working on senior committees and lifelong friends.\n\nRobert Washington | 1960\n\nBest years of my life, the four years here at Central.\n\nJewel Palmer Williams | 1960\n\nMusic anesthetized my school years. It was truly music therapy. I learned the depth of racism in our world. My education at Central was outstanding. It allowed me to progress in my work life and income, well beyond my level of formal education. I value the relationships made and the variety of people with whom I shared the high school experience. I am trying to claim my heritage as that of a fifth generation American citizen. When an observer sees me, I am obviously African-American. I think that growing up in Omaha left me with few other ethnic \"markers\". I praise Central High school to those who think that I might be exceptional in some fashion.\n\nAnabel Graetz | 1960\n\nThree awesome teachers: Frank Rice, Mr. Clarke and Mr. Fisher (who wasn't at Central for very long). The look on Miss Pilling's face when she gave me my SAT scores; they were among the highest in my class; I barely maintained a B, B+ average. (ADD was unknown back then). The fruitless struggles to get into A cappella choir (I'm now a professional singer); the fruitless struggles to be cast in the plays, (I am an actress and award winning director; you'll see a glimpse of me in the first segment of the HBO mini-series \"Olive Kitteridge,\" this Spring - 2014). The cringe inducing speeches of J. Arthur (everything he didn't like was a \"communist conspiracy\"). Not the happiest four years of my life; but still grateful for the experience of attending an integrated high school; one of my current close friends was at Little Rock High when I was at Central; what different experiences we had! And the Joslyn Memorial across the street; a wonderful place to soothe the injured teen-age heart, and to hear wonderful, wonderful music!\n\nKathleen Campbell | 1961\n\nI remember Miss Vickers, the Latin and Spanish teacher, who gave me a lifelong love for learning new languages. I also really liked Mr Roberts who was the algebra and geometry teacher. A favorite memory was when my debate partner, Olive Green, and I traveled by bus to Lincoln Nebraska and won our debate. I remember the indentations on the wooden stairs from thousands of previous students, the horrible gym outfits, and walking around and around the hallways during breaks from classes. The great education I received from Central High allowed me to earn my doctorate and teach at the University of Colorado.\n\nMargaret Mathys Payne | 1961\n\nIn the Spring 2001 edition of the Alumni Register newsletter, you asked for memories involving former teacher John Keenan.I was in the graduating class of 1961, which makes my freshman year Mr. Keenan's first year of teaching. He taught me that year and also another year, which I believe was my junior year and he was always my favorite teacher. One amusing story that I can recall involves his being a newlywed. We were surprised at something he said that he and his wife had done and he asked, \"Do you think all we do is sit around and conjugate verbs?\" Another fond memory is of him bringing his shillelagh to class for us to see. It was something I, and probably most of the class, had never seen at that time in our lives and he was very proud of it. As all classes of English had to do, we were diagramming sentences one day and he said, 'You know, kids, you will never need this once you are out of school\"! And I haven't needed it either, but I am grateful for the knowledge of how to do it anyway! A last fond memory is that one day while calling roll, he looked up after calling my name and noticed that I had new glasses and he said, \"Nice glasses.\" I wasn't thrilled to have to wear them, but he made me feel good that day. He was a remarkable person. I ran into him at a baseball game about 8-10 years after I graduated. I went to him and introduced myself and he still had some recollection of who I was, which I thought was remarkable after all the kids he had taught during and after the time I was at Central.\n\nJames Ressegieu | 1961\n\nHere are some things I remember from CHS: Lead (Pooh Bah) in the operetta, \"The Mikado\" as a senior. I was fortunate to be in A Cappella Choir for three years and still get misty when hearing \"Salvation is Created.\" Writing themes for Mr. Keenan and getting many \"P2-3's\" and \"P3-4's\" from the Style Book to revise. I loved Mr. Keenan's classes and took English from him for 4 to 5 of the 8 semesters. Peace to his memory. The \"Sacred C\". Serving on Student Control with Coach Andrews during lunch hours. Pride that lasts even today as I realized that CHS had some of the brightest students in the state/country and that we were taught by the most dedicated faculty anywhere.\n\nJonathan Bank | 1961\n\nFreshman year, 1st week, being advised not to buy elevator pass.\n\nHally Gerelick DeCarion | 1961\n\nGoing to some of the school musicals- The Mikado- Oklahoma- and the plays. Sitting on the bleachers cheering for all the star football teams. Watching Gayle Sayers run to make a touchdown and take us to the State Championships. Or watching and cheering for our mighty swift basketball team. Bowling at the Music Box across the street for GAA.\n\nMaurice Frank | 1961\n\nExtraordinary faculty - especially Ruth Pilling, Virginia Lee Pratt, and Cecil McCarter - remarkable classmates (too many to list), a serious learning environment, but tolerant of many \"clever\" pranks.\n\nRochelle Steinberg Kagan | 1961\n\nI can still hear Mr. Nelson saying, \"A word to the wise is sufficient\". I remember many good times, many good friends and a good education.\n\nDonald Kraft | 1961\n\nThe Latin sculptures made possible many humorous adventures.\n\nChristopher Krush | 1961\n\nArt class with Ms. Zenaide Luhr. The wrestling team, History, and Economics classes with Mr. Norman Sorensen. English class with Mr. John Keenan. P.E. with Mr. George Andrews, and Biology with Mr. Warren Marquiss.\n\nKeith Liberman | 1961\n\nFriendships. Teachers. The foundation for my future education. Friday night football games. Saturday night dates and Kathy, my wife.\n\nJack Mielke | 1961\n\nThe people. Good friends & acquaintances. Great teachers, mostly!\n\nPolly Nesvan Sanders | 1961\n\nWhen I rewrote music for the band while I attended CHS and my son got to play it while he attended CHS!\n\nMarita Dolezal Sanderson | 1961\n\nMr. Arthur Nelson, Principal. I recall him saying to us that if we can get along here, we can get along anywhere. I received a great education, which was great preparation for my later years.\n\nCarole Kucera Woodworth | 1961\n\nFriendships, good education, courtyard, teachers, lockers, wooden floors and steps and concavities cafeteria.\n\nRichard Zacharia | 1961\n\nThe best of friends & best of times, great educationally-based foundation. Good times with good friends, outstanding teachers and a well respected institution.\n\nJohn Hausig | 1961\n\nGoing from Washington school to Central was, initially, a huge adjustment for me. Do I buy a hall pass or not? What really happens if I step on the \"Sacred C\"? So many students! But as I began to see the wonderful diversity of the student body, the talented and inspirational teachers, and the excellent quality of education, I realized just how fortunate I was to attend this wonderful school, which I believe is a unique model other public schools should emulate. Thanks for the memories and the great friends, CHS!\n\nRichard Friedman | 1961\n\nI ordered the \"Style Book\" from the Alumni Association a few weeks ago, and it just arrived. And I found an error! Really. On page 7, under MS10 (1) what should be \"means\" is spelled \"menas.\" At first I thought the mistake must be mine, and that \"menas\" was a word I should have learned in English at Central but had skipped class that day. But I looked it up, and there is no such word. as \"menas.\" The ediition the Alumni Association sent me is from 1935, and I can't believe I am the first person in 85 years to notice this.\n\nSonia Sternberg Greene | 1962\n\nMr. Nelson's famous, \"A word to the wise is sufficient,\" Coach Andrews during driving lessons saying \"Good drivers always look ahead,\" and many, many more.\n\nDel Kelly | 1962\n\nCamping with Outdoorsmen and both Clarks (our advisors). Study hall with the pigeons. Shop classes and drafting class.\n\nCarol Rosenbaum Latz | 1962\n\nThe excellent teachers, especially Mr. Rice & Ms. Ruth Pilling. Boys & girls stairs. I got a better education at Central High School than I did in college at Ohio State.\n\nAlys Lisle Nelson | 1962\n\nJ. Arthur, A Cappella choir & the operettas, especially \"Plain & Fancy\" & \"The Mikado\"; our group T-Ping Mr Murray's house after he told our class it was impossible. Teachers 'offices' were so small the desks took up most of the room, GAA, Mr. Keenan's themes, Study(?) Hall, running from the locker room to the 4th floor for lunch, ducking the pigeons.\n\nClaudia Gere Matthews | 1962\n\nCaring, helpful teachers, educational environment, Pep Club, GAA, and lifetime friendships.\n\nShari Miller Sterenberg | 1962\n\nJ. Arthur Nelson - A word to the wise is sufficient. Mrs. Blanchard - all the rubber bands she wore and the rubber fingers full of ink. The ugly white one piece gym suits with your size on the pocket. Having to pay Mrs. Roberts a quarter to get your gym locker combination if you forgot it.\n\nC. Marsh Bull | 1962\n\nWhat I remember first is the very good education we received at Central. Second, I remember the great diversity of classmates we had as students came from all over Omaha to attend Central High. I think Central prepared us in many ways for moving forward in education and in life.\n\nThomas Hawkinson | 1963\n\nOur Senior year production of the Broadway Musical, \"The Music Man\" directed by Rod Walker, our choir director. I was the first tenor in the school board quartet, along with Daryl Hill, Joe Beninato, and Alan Lakin. What great memories.\n\nMarcia Hanek Curtis | 1963\n\n\"A word to the wise is sufficient\" (J. Arthur Nelson). Miss Amy and the plays. The Music Man production.\n\nKathleen Adler Liberman | 1963\n\nFriendships. My husband, Keith. High school spirit. The wonderful education and basis of critical thinking.\n\nJohn McPhail | 1963\n\nPrincipal J. Arthur Nelson's \"A word to wise is sufficient...\" at all-school assemblies. The state basketball tournament in 1963, and defeating Fred Hare, Joe Williams and the Tech Trojans during the regular '62-63 season. Two great English teachers--Frank Rice and Ed Clark.\n\nBeverly Parkerson Snodgrass | 1963\n\nFinally graduating. I didn't know how good my high school education was until I went to college at Ohio State in my thirties. Our English teachers taught us how to write. When I am unsure of a word's spelling or meaning, I reach for Webster's unabridged dictionary and browse.\n\nSusan Katzman | 1964\n\nMr. Walker's choir. Musicals (Fiorello, Music Man, etc). Road Show. Ms. Pilling's class. Ms. David's class. The wisdom and strength of Ed Clark. Mr. Sorenson's history class. Being a freshman and having Gale Sayers as a senior on the football team. Climbing the steps to the lunch room. Latin Club banquet, especially as a senior. Football games against Benson.\n\nRonald Sears | 1964\n\nA first class education, top notch teachers, high standards, passing between classes when I first heard of JFK being shot. Also, the climatic day of the Cuban Missle Crisis.\n\nLeo Jace Anderson | 1964\n\nJohn Keenan's English class - very sorry he passed away. \"The Stairs\". Hyman Lubman and his history requirements. I think the kids today would die if they had to fulfill his workbook assignment. J. Arthur Nelson - \"A word to the wise is sufficient.\" Tim Schmad's half court winner to beat either Tech or Benson.\n\nCharles Avery | 1964\n\nROTC, Military Ball, dances at Ak-Sar-Ben; Cheese Frenchies at King's Restaurant, Memorial Park on summer nights, segregated stairs, Road Show, study hall, working in the book room; Rifle Team, football games; ALL the excellent teachers and J. Arthur Nelson.\n\nDiana Williams Decatur | 1964\n\nMr. Nystrom' s English Classses and his debate on: \"Do the means justify the end?\" or \"Does the end justify the means?\" No matter which way we started out \"justifying,\" it seems he would get us twisted into defending the oppposite. The Military Ball of 1964 - my first really Big Wing Ding - where most attendees stayed out all night (many coming down with the measles!). My first date: March 1962- McDonald's hamburgers and a drive-in movie. I had to be home by 9:00.\n\nMichelle Aronoff Dloogoff | 1964\n\nWalking the halls in the morning before school. \"Senior Homeroom\" 145 with J. Arthur. The boys' and girls' stairways and restrooms on the landings. The day JFK was killed. All the friendships. Seeing my daughters going to Central. '64' Class reunions. Writing themes and using the \"Style Book\".\n\nNancy Hendrix Ford | 1964\n\nI attended Central from 1961-1963 and graduated from Pratt School in Omaha in 1964. Friendships at CHS are my fondest memories. Seeing Gale Sayers play football. All the wonderful Proms and dances at Peony Park balloom. What an era! English History class, where we learned how man could have evolved from a coconut! High School plays and musicals, which were always done so well.\n\nLeslie Gotch | 1964\n\nI can't tell you the names of more than three college professors I ever had, but I can still tell you nearly all of the Central teachers I had. Through my 14 years of teaching, I remembered and tried to emulate some of the great ones: Miss McBride, Mr. Perry, Mr. Sorensen, and Miss Cathers to name just a few.\n\nJeannene Rice Mason | 1964\n\nLong hours of practice but, great fun preparing for games and pep rallies. Cheerleading was only one highlight, but it, like so many Central memories, lasts a lifetime.\n\nNancy Clatterbuck Meyer | 1964\n\nI remember working on the Register and the O Book. I remember friends like Bob Hansen who died in Viet Nam. I remember the C on the floor and Mr. Cain, the English teacher who inspired me to become an English teacher. I remember walking the square before homeroom. I remember having to constantly spit out my gum in Chemistry as that woman seemed fixated on what I had in my mouth. Remember when chewing gum was such a crime? And who could forget Miss Blanchard and \"stand without a chair\", high punishment for talking in study hall! I am still proud to tell people where I went to high school, especially here in Wisconsin because Ahman Green has made it well known to Packer fans.\n\nLloyd Roitstein | 1964\n\nChoir musicals: The Music Man (1963) and Fiorello (1964).\n\nThomas Sarlo | 1964\n\nWe moved to Omaha in 1960 from Baltimore, Maryland . The first day I walked up those stairs was pretty scary. I was in a brand new town going to a brand new monster of a school. The four years that I was there were good years for me. My art teacher was Zenaide Luhr. Most students were intimidated and a little afraid of Miss Luhr because she tended to be rather direct and blunt. I liked her imediately for her directness and honesty. Art was my thing and she was a good teacher for me. My brother and I both belonged to the Outdoorsman Club - Mr. Clark was our sponsor. We made several trips to Wabonsie Park, (river bluffs in south western Iowa). We had alot of fun during these weekend campouts. We ran wild through the bluffs at night, poor Mr. Clark had no control over us. I was in Central in November 1963 when John Kennedy was killed. I'll never forget how shocked and stunned everyone was. The usually noisy halls were so strangely silent after word spread. People walked around in a trance, many were crying. All of our lives changed that day. I also remember the stair landings becoming waterfalls after pranksters flushed cherry bombs down the landing toilets. I remember raising the windows on the stair landings and throwing snowballs at teachers as they walked through the courtyards. I have many memories of Omaha Central, of football and basketball games, of a bonfire in the back parking lot as part of a pep ralley, of dances and the prom at Peony Park. It was a good time.\n\nAlista Daniels Tinnon | 1964\n\nFriday Pep Rallies around the \"sacred\" C that no one was supposed to walk on; Friday white fish and/or macaroni & cheese in the school cafeteria; Miss Buffett (advanced clothing teacher).\n\nDeborah Widoe Ady | 1965\n\n\"A word to the wise is sufficient.\"\n\nMary Campbell | 1965\n\nOne of the first and best memories: going to Madison, Wisconsin with Mr. Walker's A Cappella Choir. Playing Harry Friedman's 'daughter' in THE MUSIC MAN and screaming myself hoarse on the recurring line \"Ye Gads\" because Dr. Nelson didn't approve of \"Ye Gods\". Spending two and a half hours getting to school in a snowstorm, then walking home after classes were cancelled ten minutes later (a group of us went straight down, up, down, up Dodge Street - IN THE STREET - no buses, no cars, just SNOW!) . . . unforgettable, "
