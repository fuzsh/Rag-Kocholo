        "text": "Dear E. D., Bruce and Marian,\n\nThanks so much for your replies to my posting. I cannot begin to express my gratitude to people such as yourselves who have helped me with my research over the last forty years.\n\nMarian's response is typical of the problem I encounter in researching George H. Hoyt's \"Red Legs.\" Although \"Jayhawker\" is a common term for every Kansas man who ever stole anything in Missouri, \"Red Leg\" was a specific title used by Hoyt's group. Although cross-border raiding along the style of ancient England/Scotland became common in Western Missouri and Eastern Kansas after the outbreak of the Civil War in April 1861 (resulting in a lot of men operating out of Leavenworth later being incorrectly identified as \"Red Legs\"--re., \"Wild Bill\" Hickok, William Tough, etc.,)Hoyt organized some of these Kansas Union guerrillas as the \"Red Legs\" in 1862 after he resigned his commission as captain in the Seventh Kansas Cavalry (\"The Jayhawkers\"). (I have found some references to a group in 1861 known as \"Jennison's Scouts.\" It is likely that Hickok, Tough, Hoyt, and others were in this gang. Hence the confusion later about the membership of the distinctly separate \"Red Legs.\")\n\nIt is abundantly clear that the raiders in Lawrence on August 21, 1863, were somewhat fixated on finding members of the \"Red Legs.\" NOT a generalized, \"We're hunting for Jaykawkers!,\" type of thing; but a specific hunt for actual members of Hoyt's band. Ironically, the only member of the \"Red Legs\" known to be in Lawrence on the day of the raid was John Lyman (Jack) Bridges [who used the alias \"Jack Beauregard\" while riding with the \"Red Legs.\"] Bridges was Hoyt's \"lieutenant\" of the band, and would have been a real catch for the raiders. But Bridges somehow escaped from the Johnson House before the raiders could catch him. When Senator Jim Lane organized a scratch command to chase after the withdrawing raiders, Bridges acted as his scout. It was Jack Bridges who discovered the abandoned hack taken from Lawrence with the wounded Lieutenant Josiah L. Bledsoe and one other unidentified raider, and executed the two men. Bridges testified to this at the postwar trial of George Maddox in 1867.\n\nEd Blair, HISTORY OF JOHNSON COUNTY, KANSAS (1915)contains a section on the \"Red Legs\" during the Civil War. George H. Hoyt [mistakenly reported as never having been in the uniformed military service] put together this group:\n\n\"Kansas at that time was not lacking in a goodly supply of those restless, energetic, young gentlemen whose star of empire is forever leading them westward. Among this class, Hoyt found some whose enmity to the 'divine institution' rivaled his own. He conceived the design of organizing a company of this material. As the men would not submit to the restrains and routine of the regular army, their chances for engaging in active operations were not promising, until the difficulty was settled by the provost marshal [of Leavenworth, Kansas,] who agreed to accept them as a provost guard. They were employed in scouting, dispatch carrying, and accompanying the troops on expeditions as guides, etc. No company of better fighting material was ever organized. The men were all young, inured to western life, splendid horsemen, thoroughly accomplished in the use of weapons, rashly reckless and fearless, and, as an old Missouri lady once remarked, 'As full of the devil as a mackerel of salt.' They wore, as as a distinguishing mark, by which to recognize each other when scouting in the enemy's country, leggings of red morocco, and hence the name of 'red-legs.' The most prominent members of the gang were, Bloom Swayne [Joseph Bloomington Swain], well known under the name of 'Jeff Davis'; Jack Bridges, as 'Beauregard'; Al. Savers [Albert E. Saviers], and Joseph Mater.....\n\n\"Just what particular acts the Red Legs did in Missouri have never been recorded, but in some way, they soon gained a widespread notoriety. The Missourians represented them as monstrs of blood-thirsty cruelty, and told horrifying and hair-raising tales of their outrages and deeds of violence. In the absence of records, and with due respect for the exaggerating style of the times, we must dissent from the majority of the statements; but it is certain they soon inspired the whole Missouri border with terror, and were more dreaded than the entire Union army.....\n\n\"It was charged they were robbers of the worst class, but this accusation was unjustly applied. It is true they did a good deal of confiscating in the enemies' country, but it was always in the face of the enemy, and from known enemies. No quiet citizens were ever molested....\" [Please, folks! I don't write this material; I just report it as given. Undoubtedly innocent civilians were often unjustly targeted by the \"Red Legs.\" Such is the nature of guerrilla warfare.]\n\nStealing Missouri horses and blacks seemed to have been a major occupation of the \"Red Legs,\" just like other Kansas Jayhawking bands. The Wyandotte, Kansas, COMMERCIAL GAZETTE of 4 October 1862 (Saturday), carried this notice:\n\n\"Capt. [Nathan] Stout [3rd Wis. Cav.], Provost Marshal of this State, came down from Leavenworth on Thursday [2 Oct.] with a company of cavalry, and took Jack Beauregard, alias John Bridger [sic], prisoner, as we are informed on a charge of horse stealing, and sought to capture several other boys who were said to have been down in Missouri gathering up horses and negroes while Col. Burris was in Jackson Co. It was reported around town Thursday night that Capt. Stout had orders to break up the negro camp here [i.e., Jim Lane's organizing 1st Kansas Regiment Colored Infantry], and send all who wished to go back to their masters. But we do not hear that any proceeding of that kind took place.\"\n\nThe Leavenworth, Kansas, DAILY TIMES of 8 October 1862, noted what had occurred at Wyandotte:\n\n\"CAPT. STOUT arrested, at Wyandot[te], last week, Jack Beauregard, alias Brider [sic], on a charge of horse stealing. It was rumored that the Captain had orders to break up the contraband regiment, but we have heard of no action of the kind.\"\n\nAlthough Lawrence, Kansas, was never an actual base-of-operations for the \"Red Legs,\" they were occasionally in and out of the town, as noted in the LAWRENCE REPUBLICAN, 6 November 1862 (Thursday):\n\n\"THE QUANTRELL HUNT.--Captain Hoyt, with a detachment of Independent Scouts, arrived in this City this morning. The Captain says that his company have been in the saddle for two weeks, with Col. Burris' force, hunting Quantrell and his men. He reports Quantrell's band dispersed and driven south. Several of his men were captured by Captain Hoyt, from one of whom important facts were learned conerning Quantrell and his gang. The names of his associates and friends were learned. Parties in Leavenworth, Kansas City and this place are said to be implicated. Captain Hoyt said that Quantrell will soon be back at his old haunts. He also says there is no doubt Quantrell contemplated a raid upon Lawrence. A good many contrabands[chose,] improved [by] the opportunity of Captain Hoyt's escort, to leave Missouri for a land of freedom.\"\n\n(The Junction City, Kansas, SMOKY HILL AND REPUBLICAN UNION of 15 November 1862 (Saturday), reported: \"The detachment under Col. Burris, which have been hunting Quantrill about ten days, have returned, having accomplished little towards cleaning out the guerrillas.\")\n\nJack Bridges apparently became a resident of Lawrence about this time. This advertisement appeared in the Wyandotte, Kansas, COMMERCIAL GAZETTE on 29 November 1862:\n\n\"A NEW BATTALION\n\nOf the old sort,\n\nfor\n\nJENNISON'S OLD REGIMENT\n\nNow Commanded By the\n\nGallant and Popular\n\nYoung Commander,\n\nCOL. ALBERT L. LEE,\n\nChief of Cavalry,\n\nArmy of the Mississippi.\n\nI AM authorized, under the supervision of Capt. D. W. Houston, Recruiting Officer for the Seventh Kansas Volunteers, to raise two Companies for this veteran Regiment of \"Jayhawkers' to form a new additional Battalion.\n\nI earnestly solicit my friends, and the friends of the\n\nNEW POLICY,\n\nTo enroll themselves at once with me. Reinforce the old Seventh.\n\nRENDEZVOUS ARE ESTABLISHED AT\n\nPAOLA, under charge of Capt. Swain.\n\nLAWRENCE, under charge of Capt. Bridges.\n\nTOPEKA, uncer charge of Capt. Sloat.\n\n--GEO. H. HOYT.\n\nCentral Recruiting Office,\n\nCAPT. D. W. HOUSTON,\n\nMain Street,\n\nLeavenworth, Kansas.\"\n\nHoyt's \"Red Legs\" and other \"detectives\" had apparently worn-out their welcome (?) with Jim Blunt. The Topeka, Kansas, STATE RECORD of 19 November 1862, printed this notice:\n\n\"GENERAL ORDERS--No. 1.\n\nHEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF KANSAS,\n\nFort Leavenworth, Kansas,\n\nNov. 15, 1862.\n\nI. The following Detectives, Provost Marshals and Special Agents are hereby discharged from employment in the United States service, viz: A. H. Thacher, Wm. Freeland, Jas. Pollard, Monroe M. Gay, A. F. Pratt, J. H. Larned, James Smith, Horace Pardee, J. E. Hall, H. H. Sawyer, Thomas Russell, C. G. Gillett, D. S. McIntosh, W. H. Hays, D. J. Baldwin, William Cable, Amos Avery, Thos. H. Kelsey, George F. Williams, J. C. Bender.\n\nII. All other persons employed as detectives in the northern district of Kansas, are directed to report at once in person at these headquarters for orders.\n\nIII. The band of irresponsible men, popularly known as 'Red Legs,' or 'The Forty Thieves,' organized under the auspices of Capt. Stout, late Provost Marshal, are commanded to disperse.\n\nCommanders of posts, regiments, companies and detachments are ordered to be vigilant in promptly arresting these marauders whenever they may be found exercising any police or other authority; and to send them under guard to this post, with written statements, setting forth all the facts leading to their arrest.\n\nIV. Where the civil authority is unable to afford protection to life and property, application will be made to Lieut. Col. Burris, commanding post at Fort Leavenworth, who will co-operate with them in the suppression of all disturbances.\n\nBy order of Brig. Gen. J. G. Blunt,\n\nT. J. WEED, Maj. and A.A.A. Gen.\"\n\nIn reporting Blunt's action, the Leavenworth DAILY CONSERVATIVE of 16 November 1862 (Sunday), stated: \"We presume the cause of this order is that the trade (?) in horses and other property was becoming too brisk for the interest of citizens.\"\n\nThe Kansas City, Missouri, WESTERN JOURNAL OF COMMERCE [Weekly edition], 13 June 1863 (Saturday), had this item:\n\n\"'AL. SAVIERS' has been sent to Leavenworth in accordance with a telegram from Gen. Blunt. The robbery which he committed comes fully within the scope of both Gen. Blunt's and Gen. Curtis' military orders.\"\n\nWhen Thomas Ewing, Jr., became district commander in 1863 he employed George H. Hoyt as his \"Chief of Detectives.\" Hoyt, in turn, employed Jack Bridges and other former members of his \"Red Legs\" as detectives. As \"detectives,\" still wearing their distinctive red leggings, Hoyt, Bridges and others continued their operations in Missouri in 1863. In 1862 the \"Red Legs\" were officially working for the Provost Marshal of Leavenworth. In 1863 the \"Red Legs\" were officially working as detectives for the Provost Marshal of the District. Get the difference? (Yes, I'm being somewhat sarcastic here.)\n\n--These were the fearsome \"Red Legs\" that apparently terrified Quantrill's men!\n\nWith their distinctive red leather leggings, Hoyt's band would have stood out from pretty much all other \"Jayhawker\" gangs. This why I am surprised at the shortage of original reports on their activities in Missouri newspapers at the time. And why I have once again come to this site for the generous help of its patrons in my search.\n\nThanks once again to everyone who has responded to my requests, past and present!"
