        "text": "While he was attending classes at Georgetown, Thomas also worked as an assistant examiner at the U.S. Patent Office, from October 1888 to October 1890, but, in 1891, he moved to New York City and became a patent attorney. For the next five years, he and his father, also a patent attorney, shared their law offices as Ewing & Ewing in Manhattan and their home in Yonkers, New York. But they had law partners. One of them was the General's son and Thomas's brother, Hampton Denman Ewing, Sr. After his father was struck and killed by a cable car in 1896, Thomas continued to practice law, this time with Hampton. Thomas made his name as the counsel for Frank J. Sprague on the multiple-unit control of electric train operations and for Professor Michael I. Pupin on long-distance telephony. When he was returned to the U.S. Patent Office as the 33rd Commissioner in 1913, he was the President of the Current Literature Publishing Company and on the Board of Directors of the Crocker-Wheeler Company of Ampere, New Jersey.\n\nEwing was the Commissioner of Patents from 15 August 1913 to 15 August 1917. When he began, he kept the tradition of market monopoly on the control of patents by declaring that “a man had the right to say what the resale price of his patent should be”. A strong supporter of patent reform, he worked for ways of streamlining and expediting patent operations. He often complained about the case backlogs, cramped offices and low salaries of the examiners and other members of the U.S. Patent Office. He tried to get a reform bill through the Congress in 1915 but it failed. However, he did have the Patent Office regulations revised for “brevity, speed and efficiency”. He still ran into more problems when World War I began. Many of the workers left the Patent Corps to go “Over There” to France with the Army and Navy Corps. The war also complicated the conditions for the patent applications on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, forcing Ewing to declare that the United States would not take over the patents from the citizens of enemy nations. But he drew criticism, and this situation would not be resolved until 1921, when the Nolan Bill was passed by the Congress. Nevertheless, in spite of the difficulties, under Ewing’s administration, two agencies were created. One of them was the Patent Office Society, formed in 1917 “to promote and foster a true appreciation of the American Patent System”. The other was the National Research Council (NRC), organized in 1916 to oversee the scientific and technical services for the war effort. The NRC was asked by Ewing to assemble a committee specifically to prepare the legislation to reform the patent laws. It eventually succeeded in having the Lampert Patent Office Bill passed by the Congress – in 1922, five years after the end of Ewing’s term.\n\nEwing was notable for another reason. He consistently ignored President Wilson’s policies of discrimination against blacks in the U.S. Civil Service. Before he was appointed as the Commissioner, he had been the first Chairman of the Legal Committee for a year since 1911, when it was established by the NAACP.\n\nWhen Thomas resigned in 1917, he was appointed as the Chairman of the Munitions Board of the War and Navy Departments for the rest of World War I. This board encouraged the munitions and aircraft industries to pool their patents to help the technological development for the war effort. When the war was over, Ewing returned to Yonkers and resumed his law practice. But he continued to lecture on patent law at Georgetown University. He had begun in 1914 and he would continue until 1932. He later served as the President of the American Group of the International Association for the Protection of Industrial Property, of the New York Intellectual Property Law Association from 1928 to 1929, and of the American Patent Law Association in 1931.\n\nEwing died on 7 December 1942 at his home in Yonkers after a long illness."
