At the time stated William Jenkins had one of the machines in charge, while Baker, who was at least twenty feet from it and the insulated wires with which they are connected, suddenly dropped dead, while Jenkins and another man, who stood between him and Baker, were also badly shocked, but soon rallied.\n\nThey rushed to where Baker lay, but he was beyond recall. The fact that Baker was not within twenty feet of the wires or machine makes the accident such a peculiar one, while the volts used are not sufficient in number to cause death, as Superintendent Carr stated that he has frequently had the full force of the shock. The capacity of the machine is given at 300 volts, and it is thought that it required at least 500 volts to cause death.\n\nThe body of the unfortunate man was brought to the surface of the shaft and there viewed by the coroner and his jury. An examination will be made by the experts of the mine with proper instruments in the presence of the coroner's jury to ascertain just where the trouble lay that caused the accident.\n\nBaker, the dead miner, lived with his parents, whom he supported, at the corner of Fifth and Cheyenne streets. He is also the brother of Mrs. Chris Gausz, corner Ottawa and Fifth Streets. The body has been conveyed to the home.

The cause was soon discovered, John Dooley had placed a pistol to his head and pulled the trigger, killing himself instantly.\n\nSoon after the rash act a Times representative called at the place where the dead man lay and the following concerning the dead was ascertained. John Dooley was a widower, his wife having died several years ago; he has worked for Section Foreman R. H. Huber on the Missouri Pacific railway for the past five years; lived alone until two months ago, when his stepson, Frank Hill, married and moved in with him. Dooley quit work on the railroad about a month ago, telling Mr. Huber he could not stand the work on account of hot weather. Friday was pay day and he drew his back pay for one month. Saturday he came to Leavenworth and made some purchases. Among them was a jug of whisky and 100 cartridges; he went to Kickapoo in the evening feeling \"pretty good.\"\n\nAll day Sunday he was drinking, and talking about killing himself. He went to a neighbor's house, Mrs. Wines, and told her several times he would put an end to himself; he then went home, and left his house again, this time going to Harry Rodgers, a colored man's house. Rodger's wife did his washing. He met Rodgers in the yard, and said he was going away in the morning, and he wished to get all his clothes. Rodgers called his wife and asked her if she had any more of John's clothes, to which she replied that he had got all of them. He then told Mr. Rodgers that he (Rodgers) owed him a little money and as he was going away he wanted it. Rodgers said he did not have the change but would go over to a neighbor and get it for him, which he did; but when he was returning he heard the report of the pistol. Dooley had walked into the house as soon as Rodgers started. He walked through one room to where Mrs. Rodgers was, stopped in the door that leads into another room, pulled a pistol from his pocket, placed it about one inch and a half above the right ear and shot himself dead. His body fell into the adjoining room. In a pocket was a bottle of whisky.\n\nSquire Sharp was called, and on learning the circumstance advised that the body be removed to its late home. An inquest was unnecessary.\n\nThe pistol that Dooley used was one of the cheap kind called \"reliable\" and a 32 caliber. At Dooley's house was found two guns, which he had loaded, before leaving, and which he laid across his bed; a violin was also on the bed. Foreman Huber stated that once before, when Dooley was on a spree, he sat up with him till 4 o'clock in the morning to keep him from killing himself.\n\nThe deceased has not a relative here save one step son, Frank Hill, who goes by the name of \"Scrap Dooley.\" He has a brother at Cameron, Mo. This is the only living relation. He visited him a short time ago. The deceased served in the late ware, enlisting at the age of 18, for which he received a pension.

He was found hanging by its cord in his cell about 8:30 p.m. New Year's Eve.\n\nPrison officials did not disclose his death until Wednesday and said there was no doubt Johnson committed suicide.\n\n\"He was fully aware of his danger to other people,\" said Robert Atkins, acting warden at the penitentiary.\n\nThe previous warden estimated Johnson would be killed within 30 minutes if he were to mingle with other prisoners.\n\n\"They wouldn't even try a man for killing me,\" Johnson once said in an interview. \"It's a whole different world in here. Just four walls . . . there's no place to run. It's like a war. If I think somebody's going to kill me, I'll wipe him out.\"\n\nJohnson was serving three life terms for stabbing other prisoners to death. By his own calculation, he also had another 76 years to go for robbery and burglary.\n\nBorn at Clover, Okla., he was sentenced to the Oklahoma Penitentiary when he was 18 to serve five years for forgery. Other prisoners called him \"Idabel,\" because he talked of once being arrested at Idabel, Okla.\n\nHe was sent to the Kansas Penitentiary in 1951 to serve 5 to 10 years for burglary.

He had been in isolation since a second stabbing in 1965. Johnson admitted both. He drew a third life sentence when another convict was killed with a ball point pen in 1968, but Johnson always insisted someone else did it.\n\nWarden Atkins said Johnson had been depressed since last fall, when he threatened two guards and was deprived of his TV set, his radio and the privilege of using the exercise yard.\n\nThat left him confined in a cell barely large enough to do pushups.(Wichita Eagle, Thursday, January 3, 1974, page 15A)\n\nJONES, CHILD OF MATHEWS JONES\n\nOne of Rev.

Kohn Concealed in a Gunny Sack and Morris in her Arms\n\nHer Struggle for Bread in Leavenworth - Died Believing her Favorite Boy Still Alive Though He Had been Four Years Dead - Mother of Mrs. M. W. Levy\n\nCash Henderson and another friends went up to Kansas City yesterday to attend the funeral of Mrs. Dora Kohn\n\nMrs. Kohn was the mother of Sol H. Kohn and Morris Kohn and Mrs. M. W. Levy and was well known in this city. Mrs. Kohn was a good woman and but few people in Wichita who were accustomed to see her sitting on the little porch at the Levy residence are aware of the pathetic story connected with her life.\n\nAbout fifty years ago the province of Bohemia was the scene of a rebellion. Mrs. Kohn's husband was one of the most prominent Jewish rabbis of great wealth. He was connected with the rebellion and when the crisis came Rabbi Kohn had to fly to save his wife. When he left his home one night he said to his faithful wife, \"I am going to try to reach America. When you have a chance follow me to New York.\"\n\nWhen opportunity offered and disguised as a decrepit old woman and with her babe Morris Kohn under her arm and Sol who was two years old concealed in a gunny sack swung over her shoulder the brave woman succeeded in getting aboard an English ship.\n\nShe came to New York. She met her husband and together they came to St. Louis. Rabbi Kohn had succeeded in sending his money out of Bohemia and when he came to St. Louis was what might at that time be considered a wealthy man.\n\nMr. Kohn made money in St. Louis but finally engaged in speculations of a gambling nature and one morning he awoke from his financial dreams and found himself bankrupt with a wife and five children, three boys and two girls, to take care of. Mr. Kohn started in to make another fortune but in a short time died.\n\nMrs. Kohn took her little family and moved to Leavenworth, Kansas and set her wits to work to make a living for herself and children. She started a fruit stand which she attended and Sol an Morris were sent into the streets to gather up old scrap iron and it was in that way that Sol H. and Morris Kohn learned their first lessons in political economy.\n\nThese two faithful boys never deserted their mother and the golden band of affection that bound these three people together was never sundered till death decreed it. These two boys in after years became prosperous in business and every cent of their wealth was at their mother's command. Even when she was not in need they insisted on giving to her in her old age.\n\nThe business career of the Kohn Brothers in this city is a part of Wichita's history and needs not be related. The real pathetic part of this story remains to be related. All the older residents will remember that Morris Kohn died in New York about four years ago.\n\nWhen M. W. Levy received the dispatch announcing Morris Kohn's death he took it to his wife and the question was discussed as to how they should break the news to mother. The more they discussed it the farther they got from a satisfactory conclusion. Morris and Saul were all the world to mother and Mrs. Levy could not break her heart by telling her that Morris was dead.\n\nThe unpleasant task was put off until the next day, the next and the next. And when Dora Kohn reached that shore where the sunlight of eternity never fades she for the first time learned that her favorite boy had preceded her.\n\nDuring his life after he went to New York every month Morris Kohn sent his mother a check for a small amount of money so as to make her feel that she still had an interest in his business. Right along every month until her death that check came signed by the head clerk of Morris Kohn's office and the fond old mother believed that her son had not forgotten her. She never so much as dreamed that her boy was dead.\n\nSome of the friends of the Kohn's thought that was all wrong but those who loved the old mother best had practiced the deception and so it must remain. A friend of the family said that about a year ago Mrs. Kohn was taken sick and when she recovered it almost broke him down when he heard the fond old mother trying to appear offended at Morris because he had not left his great business and come to see her when she was sick.
