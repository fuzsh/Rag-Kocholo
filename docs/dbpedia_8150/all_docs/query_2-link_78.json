Explore endless possibilities with Fresno Unified CTE today!\n\nCareer Technical Education\n\nPathway Programs\n\nThe greatest joy in my job is related to students – seeing their growth and hearing about their successes in academics, sports or extracurricular activities. Learning about their successes later on as they attend college and/or move into a career also makes me smile.\n\nMy favorite part of my job is my ability to communicate with families whose primary language is not English.\n\nI wanted all students to see it (school's welcome mural) as they entered our school, knowing that they are valued and we are here for them.\n\nI really enjoy seeing their growth over the years, seeing them come out of their shells. That’s my joy of doing the job – that transformation!"
