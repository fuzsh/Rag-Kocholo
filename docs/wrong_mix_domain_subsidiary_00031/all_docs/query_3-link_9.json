        "text": "I can't be the only one struggling with this, so please weigh in folks: I'll admit I miss the energy of an office and the serendipitous nature that being in the same space brings. I do hate traffic and commutes and love the flexibility of remote work and the quality of life it has unlocked for my family and I. But I get shit done and am accountable to the work and the team, so that's never been an issue. As of late, I've been mired in the dark side of remote work where people don't pull their own weight, have gone MIA, prioritized personal appointments or become generally unresponsive on important matters or requests. I've not enforced the accountability notice to date but feel like it may be time to do just that. Not a gentle nudge and reminder, but a firm line in the sand/1-strike policy. Otherwise we're rewarding bad behavior and undermining a culture of accountability, right?? And isn't that foundational to making remote work really work??!! Don't get me wrong; im a Family First 100% of the time advocate and believe that should always be the priority. But what happens when personal accountability evaporates? How do you manage that? I don't want a return to work revolution, but I do want people to hold their own. Am I crazy?\n\nwhere are my journalists and writer friends??? I have a handful of \"bios\" that need to be written on a relatively short turn. Looking for punchy, Fast Company-type bios that clearly communicate the most relevant info in a way that is clear, concise and makes it clear that these are people you DEFINITELY want to meet. I'd prefer to work with someone I already know, but open to intros, as well. what you got??"
