Passionate about technology’s potential to empower communities, over the course of six years he started almost half of Google’s worldwide operations.\n\nMo then moved to Google X, the famed innovation division charged with achieving the next ‘moonshot’ development. His role took in planning, strategy, sales, partnerships and business development. Unlike other businesses, and other parts of Google, X focused on giant leaps of innovation, rather than iterative improvements. It aimed to turn science fiction into fact and bring the future closer. It saw Mo working on projects from sustainable energy to providing Wi-Fi to remote parts of the world to autonomous vehicles to life sciences.\n\nAlongside his Google work Mo co-founded outside businesses in areas including health and fitness, property, and food and drink. He’s served on multiple technology company and government boards in Europe and the Middle East.\n\nAfter a period of general malaise in his life, which he tried to solve with material wealth and experiences, Mo turned his engineering skills to emotions and created an algorithm and model to help avoid and manage disappointment. It incorporated aspects of philosophy and religion; he took data points throughout life and worked for over seven years finding trends and patterns. He placed happiness overall in context of the experiences and expectations of life. He also personally put his project to the test when his 21-year-old son died during a routine operation and the whole experience became the foundation of Solve for Happy. Mo now aims to build on his work to bring happiness to a billion people around the world.\n\nAnn-Kathrin Sauthoff-Bloch\n\nGM and MD, Infosys Consulting Germany\n\n“There are still far too few women in leadership positions. It is our societal mission to change this – now!”\n\nIt has become Ann-Kathrin Sauthoff-Bloch's mission to show women the way to entrepreneurial leadership positions based on her own experiences! She is convinced that a balanced gender ratio in decision-making boards is beneficial for companies and society. Since April 2020, Ann-Kathrin has been General Manager and Managing Director at Infosys Consulting Germany. Prior to this, she spent many years in management positions at IBM and Accenture. Her consulting work has led her mainly into the telecommunications and retail sectors and into the subject area of digital transformation. At IBM, she was responsible, among other things, for the global IT and consulting business with Deutsche Telekom. In 2008, she became a partner at Accenture, making her one of the company's youngest partners in Germany.\n\nIt is from this wealth of experience that Ann-Kathrin draws her inspiration from when she talks about the opportunities and challenges for women on the path to leadership. She advocates for the dismantling of systemic hurdles – in collaboration with male colleagues. At the same time, she wants to convey to women which qualities are essential in professional life: ambition, initiative, perseverance, resilience – but also attributes considered “typically female”, such as empathy and strong team orientation. After all, it is precisely these qualities that are essential in times of crisis and disruptive change to keep a company on track and lead it to further growth. She is passionate about delivering high-quality management consulting and developing high-performance teams that can implement large-scale transformation plans for their clients. Ann-Kathrin also shares her knowledge and experience within the frameworks of FidAR and Advance Women – because the more women are in leadership positions and take a pioneering role, she believes, the faster fundamental change can be initiated in the corporate world.\n\nAnn-Kathrin holds a degree in European Business Administration from the University of Applied Sciences in Reutlingen, Germany, and Middlesex University in London.\n\nPascal Matzke\n\nVP, Research Director, Forrester\n\nIn his role as research director, Pascal Matzke leads Forrester's global CIO research team that focuses on the digital transformation opportunities for businesses around customer experience as well as connected products and services.
