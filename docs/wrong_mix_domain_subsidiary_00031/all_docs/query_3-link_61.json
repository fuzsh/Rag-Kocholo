        "text": "Deepak said:\n\nthop said:\n\nYou can set the japanese SH4 to english language.\n\nThen what will be the difference between it and English vers? But I may get it if it is true. I can't wait.\n\nFrom df0 at Silenthillforum.co.uk\n\nhttp://www.silenthillforum.co.uk/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=10711\n\nHi,\n\nI can confirm the following about the PAL release of Silent Hill 4:\n\n1. English, German (Deutsch), French (Francais), Italian (Italiano) and Spanish (Espanol) subtitles.\n\n2. No 60 Hz mode. Small black borders, I did not notice any difference in 'speed'.\n\nThat's it\n\nFafalada said:\n\nYeah I can see where you come from on display thing. Anyway after seeing PC version near perfect look on TV, I was pretty much won over too, so I may as well hold off on PS2 SH4.\n\nAnd SH is a slow game which i don't think will suffer too much from the lack of a controller. I'll still miss it though...\n\nAlthough speaking of this, why not get one of these?\n\nhttp://www.jandaman.com/thestore/prods/psxusb5.html\n\nPlaying SilentHill game with mouse and KB feels like you're violating the game in a way\n\nOr you could always go for one of those DS clones for PC. I dunno if they're any good though, I never actually tried using one.\n\nI use ELECOM's (Japanese) USB PS2 gamepad adaptor for PC, the key map is simply perfect for SH3 (exactly the same as PS2 SH3).\n\nEvil_Cloud said:\n\nVysez said:\n\nlondon-boy said:\n\nNow, one thing. Why is it that PC games are cheaper than console games?\n\nPublisher don't pay royalties on PC. A contrario, on console the publisher can't get away without giving ~15% of the price as a license fee.\n\nMany GameCube games sell almost as cheap as PC games nowadays. Bless Nintendo. ^^\n\nSo did dreamcast games....not sure if it was just towards the end of their life or throughout the entire thing though.(I think only the less hyped gamecube games are $40, a new zelda would be $50)\n\nBTW, is deus ex 2 still $50 on pc? I avoided buying that since it was more than the $40 I was used to paying for a pc game.\n\nFox5 said:\n\nEvil_Cloud said:\n\nVysez said:\n\nlondon-boy said:\n\nNow, one thing.
