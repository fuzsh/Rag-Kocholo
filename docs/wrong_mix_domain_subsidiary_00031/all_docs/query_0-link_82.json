        "text": "1. Major labels 1988–1998 (Big Six) 1. Warner Music Group 2. EMI 3. Sony Music (known as CBS Records until January 1991 then known as Sony Music thereafter) 4. BMG Music 5.

Universal Music Group Major labels since late 2011, if approved (Big Three) 1. Sony Music Entertainment 2. Warner Music Group 3. Universal Music Group (EMI recorded music division to be absorbed into UMG, pending approval by antitrust regulators) Record companies and music publishers that are not under the control of the big three are generally considered to be independent (indie), even if they are large corporations with complex structures. The term indie label is sometimes used to refer to only those independent labels that adhere to an independent criteria of corporate structure and size, and some consider an indie label to be almost any label that releases non-mainstream music, regardless of its corporate structure. Music collectors often use the term sublabel to refer to either an imprint or a subordinate label company (such as those within a group). For example, in the 1980s and 1990s, \"4th & B'way\" was a trademarked brand owned by Island Records Ltd. in the UK and by a subordinate branch, Island Records, Inc., in the United States. The center label on a 4th & Broadway record marketed in the US would typically bear a 4th & B'way logo and would state in the fine print, \"4th & B'way™, an Island Records, Inc. company\". Collectors discussing labels as brands would say that 4th & B'way is a sublabel or imprint of just \"Island\" or \"Island Records\". Similarly, collectors who choose to treat corporations and trademarks as equivalent might say 4th & B'way is an imprint and/or sublabel of both Island Records, Ltd. and that company's sublabel, Island Records, Inc. However, such definitions are complicated by the corporate mergers that occurred in 1989 (when Island was sold to PolyGram) and 1998 (when PolyGram merged with Universal). Island remained registered as corporations in both the US and UK, but control of its brands changed hands multiple times as new companies were formed, diminishing the corporation's distinction as the \"parent\" of any sublabels. In September 2006, Steve Jobs announced that iTunes owned 88% of the legal music download market. iTunes had 10,152,284 downloads a day on average\n\n2. A report released by the IFPI in 2009, stated that 95% of music downloads are illegal (International Federation of the Phonographic Industry) Even legal music downloads have faced a number of challenges from artists, record labels and the Recording Industry Association of America. In July 2007, the Universal Music Group decided not to renew their long-term contracts with iTunes. In January 2005, downloaded tracks outsold physical singles for the first time in UK music history[citation needed], prompting The Official UK Charts Company to begin to incorporate downloads for the first time into the UK Singles Chart ________________________________________________________________________ Adele In the months leading up to the European release of 21, Adele embarked on a promotional tour across Europe, performing on the UK's Royal Variety Performance on 9 December 2010, the finale of reality singing competition The Voice of Holland on 21 January 2011, and on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge on six days later Adele performed \"Someone Like You\" at the 2011 BRIT Awards ceremony, which was well received and resulted in an incremental sales increase for both 19 and 21. For the North American release of 21 on 22 February, Columbia Records executives used the \"'long tail' sales theory\" to shape its marketing campaign, which, according to Columbia senior VP of marketing Scott Greer, entailed \"building a critical mass throughout February in order to reach all those people who bought 19.\"Key to this was the record company approaching internet and media partners Vevo, AOL and VH1 to begin promoting Adele's old and new songs. 21 album, Japan, Russia and Spain, highest position was in top 4, the rest of the world Number 1. _____________________________________________________________________ Two years ago sales of singles soared to an all-time record of 152.7m units. There has, unsurprisingly, been a fall in sales of albums – down from 133.6m units to 128.9m two years ago. U.S Market Share (2005) World Market share (2005)\n\n3. Worldwide Music 2006 ($60.7 billion), 2007 ($61.5 billion), 2008 ($62.6 Industry Revenues billion), 2009 ($65.0 billion), 2010 ($66.4 billion), 2011 (2006 - 2011) ($67.6 billion) Worldwide Live $16.6 billion (2006), $18.1 billion (2007), $19.4 billion Music / Concert (2008), $20.8 billion (2009), $22.2 billion (2010), $23.5 Revenues (2006 - billion (2011) 2011) Worldwide Digital $2.9 billion (2006), $4.5 billion (2007), $7.0 billion (2008), Music Revenues $10.7 billion (2009), $12.9 billion (2010), 14.8 billion (2011) (2006 - 2011) US MP3 Player Retail Apple (73.7%), San Disk (9%), Creative (3.3%), Microsoft Sales, by Brand, (2.3%), Samsung (2.2%), Other (9.5%) February 2007 (% market share) Digital Music % of 20% 2008 Total Music Sales Global single track 1.4 billion units globally downloads in 2008 The value of the music market in the current day is $4.6 billion There has been a 1000% increase in value of the digital music industry since 2004.\n\n4. Other services, such as VEVO and MTV, are also commanding significant audiences. Record labels have taken different approaches to licensing online music video services, some partnering with YouTube through VEVO and others with MTV and by launching artist-branded websites. Michael Nash, executive vice president, digital strategy and business development, Warner Music Group, says: “We offer consumers artist- branded channels on YouTube. In a world where over half of the active rosters are signed to extended rights agreements, it is extremely important for us to have a strong marketing partnership with our artists.” The introduction of new legislation and a landmark court decision on The Pirate Bay in 2009 helped make Sweden a positive case study for digital music. Yet 18 months later, lack of active copyright enforcement threatens to reverse the gains the market has made.\n\n5. In the UK, for example, Harris Interactive found that 76 per cent of all music obtained online in the UK in 2010 was unlicensed. The survey found that the majority of unauthorised downloading was coming from P2P networks but that music piracy through cyberlockers is on the rise, e.g. Mediafire, Zippy, RapidShare and DropBox. Limewire down, BitTorrent up Despite variations by country, there are some common trends across markets. The popularity of Limewire, appears to be in decline after the US court injunction in October 2010. On the other hand, usage of BitTorrent is growing across most markets, indicating that P2P networks are still a significant source of pirate content. Nearly one in four active internet users in Europe visit unlicensed sites monthly. The Nielsen Company _____________________________________________________ 2010 Beats By Dre, had sold 1m pairs of headphones in two years. In January, the Los Angeles Times reported that Beats’ fourth quarter retail sales were $50m. Lovine is reluctant to confirm the figure. For most people, high fidelity in music went out with the hi-fi, sacrificed for the portability of the Walkman, Apple’s desirable iPods and the tinny MP3 format used by countless peer- to-peer websites, mobile phones and also-ran digital music players. After just a couple of months since the company purchased Beats Audio and began bundling headphones with all new smartphone releases, HTC has decided to scrap the idea. Says one HTC exec: \"An accessory like the headphone doesn't factor in when someone is buying a smartphone. If they want a Beats headphone, they'll buy it directly.\"\n\n6. HTC spent $300 million last year to acquire the majority stake in Beats. Beats has been panned by many as a gimmick, and real audiophiles say the software and hardware is no better than the regular audio seen in most smartphones. The company does include Beats Audio support into all their new devices, and the tech is integrated into the music apps. HTC says starting with the launch next week of the One X, there will be no more bundling for the immediate future, although execs have not completely shut the door. ________________________________________________________________________ Iggy Pop's new album has been rejected by his record label, forcing the singer to release it himself. Virgin EMI turned down the collection of cover versions and French chanson, so Pop has put it on sale via digital retailers. The Official Streaming Chart will launched on monday the 14th of May 2012, billed as the first chart to rank audio streams from both ad-funded and subscription services in the UK. Music streaming has grown significantly in the past 12 months with 2.6bn audio streams in the UK in 2011. Revenues from streaming services increased by 30% to £35m in 2011 but remains a fraction, at just 4.5%, of total music industry revenues."
