        "text": "Musician, actress and composer\n\nMusical artist\n\nCindy Valentine (Valentine Cinzia Leone) is an Italian-born composer, producer, actress and performing artist, raised in Toronto, Ontario, Canada who is now a U.S. citizen, residing primarily in New York, New York. Valentine hit the Billboard Dance/Club charts in 1989 with \"Secret Rendez-Vous\" and \"Pick Up the Pieces (To My Heart)\", both songs co-written by Tony Green and Cindy Valentine.[1] Valentine also co-wrote the songs, \"Finest Hour\" and \"Never Gonna Be the Same Again\" for the 1989 Halloween classic, Teen Witch and played the part of Shana the Rock Star in the film. As a composer and performer, additional soundtrack credits include: Repossessed (1990), Mannequin Two: On the Move (1991), and Another 9 1/2 Weeks (1997).\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nValentine studied music at The Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto at the age of 7, Valentine entered a singing contest, winning first place and a month of opera training at the Il conservatorio Di Milano, Italy under Claudio Villa.[2]Juno Award-winning composer and producer, Tony Green was present at one of the Milan recording sessions and took note of Valentine's talent. Green had already been to the top of the charts for his Billboard Hot Dance Club Play number-one single, \"Come to Me\", performed by France Joli.[3] Valentine signed with Green as her producer under the CBS Columbia Records label in 1984.[4] Valentine Leone took the stage name Cindy Valentine, curiously missing the Leone surname she shares with the family patriarch, famed Spaghetti Western director Sergio Leone.[2]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring her six years as a lead vocalist with CBS, PolyGram and Arista Records, Valentine remained engaged with the creative process. A formally trained pianist, Valentine also contributed percussion, keyboards, and backup vocals,[5] in addition to song writing on her records.[2] After, \"Secret Rendez-vous\" and \"Pickup The Pieces (To My Heart)\" made the Billboard charts,[6] Alisha (RCA), Lori Ruso (Capitol) and European singer C.

For much of the 1990s into 2003, Valentine worked behind the scenes in film and television, as a composer and musician. Composer Dominic Messinger and Valentine teamed in 1997, with credited works for the sequel to Mickey Rourke's Another 9 1/2 Weeks,[12] and the television series As the World Turns and Sirens.\n\nBroadcast Music, Inc.s author's database credits Valentine with 107 (ASCAP) published works as of October 30, 2012.[13]\n\nValentine is a voting member of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences Grammy Awards as of 2009.[14]\n\nIn 2013, Valentine made several worst dressed lists at the red carpet appearance of the 55th annual Grammys in a rock-star styled ringleader's outfit.[15][16]\n\nIn many recent instances, Valentine is credited as Valentine Leone.\n\nSince 2000, Valentine has involved herself with horror, documentary and art genre films, such as the critically acclaimed 4Chosen: The Documentary (2008)[17] and is credited as Producer on Ruth (2000) and co-executive producer on Souvenir Views (2003).

Damien would go on to play the character of Danny Romalotti on the daytime television series The Young and the Restless. Valentine would also appear in episode 39 of the CBS television series Night Heat in 1986.\n\nThe Pink Chiquitas (1987): Valentine appeared in the Sci-fi comedy film, The Pink Chiquitas, featuring Frank Stallone and Eartha Kitt. Valentine played Stella Dumbrowski, a competent teenage intern working in the weather department.[35]\n\nDrop Out Mother (1988): Valentine was cast as a superstar named Virgin, in the made-for-TV movie Drop-out Mother with Valerie Harper and Wayne Rogers in the starring roles.[36]\n\nTeen Witch (1989): Valentine appeared as Shana the Rock Star and co-wrote two signature songs for the movie, Teen Witch, with composer Larry Weir. The song \"Finest Hour\" would be played during plot climax and \"Never Gonna Be the Same Again\" would open the film and play during the plot resolution. There are two popular versions of the song, \"Never Gonna Be The Same Again\", Valentine's live performance on-camera version and Lori Ruso's off-camera version which opens the film.\n\nBox office competition against Teen Witch was tremendous - Field of Dreams, starring Kevin Costner and Pet Sematary, written by Stephen King, were released on April 21, 1989, two days prior to the release of Teen Witch. Teen Witch flopped at the box office, but has since become a cult classic. The Teen Witch phenomena is fueled with regular television re-broadcasts, annual inclusion on ABC's 13 Nights of Halloween and midnight theater presentations where attendees dress in 1980s in fashion and singalong with the soundtrack.[37]\n\nSunset Heat (alternate title: Midnight Heat 1992): Valentine played the part of Holly in John Nicolella's 1992 feature film, Sunset Heat, starring Michael Par√©, Adam Ant and Dennis Hopper.[38]\n\nSkins (alternate title: Gang Boys 1994): Starring, Wings Hauser, Linda Blair and Cole Hauser, credited as Valentine Leone for her part in Dream Sex Sequence.\n\nThe Lesson (2000): a short drama, filmed in black and white, with Valentine playing the part of Angela, starring Cindy Valentine, Tracy Metro and Corbin Timbrook.\n\nBruco (2005): A feature-length film, written and directed by Antonio D'Alfonso, starring Frank A.
