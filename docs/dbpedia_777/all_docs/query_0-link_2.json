        "text": "Chris Young's step-father — whose name is Michael Harris, and who means so much to the singer that he calls him Dad — suffered a heart attack on Saturday (June 29). Young was out on the road at the time, and he played his Greeley, Colo. show as scheduled, but not without posting a message of gratitude that his dad is OK.\n\n\"I don't even have the words,\" he wrote in an Instagram post, sharing a carousel of shots from the show.\n\n\"On a day where my dad had a heart attack, you lifted me up. I love country music fans. I'm happy I played,\" he continued. \"I'm happy my dad is ok. Much love to all of you.\"\n\nWho is Chris Young's Dad?\n\nMichael Harris proposed to Young's mom on Valentine's Day one year during his childhood, and ever since, they've had a strong father-son bond. In 2021, Young bought his dad a new truck for Christmas, and his 2024 album Young Love & Saturday Nights includes a track called \"Gettin' Older\" that speaks to their close relationship.\n\nYoung's father has a history of health issues. He had his first heart attack in the mid-2000s.\n\nIn 2009, Harris was diagnosed with lung cancer.\n\n\"They cut a third of his lung out [and] put him through chemo. He's actually doing really well. He's doing great,\" Young said about a year and a half later. \"But through all of that, I don't think I've ever really seen him get down in the dumps...Every day he gets up, it's a good day, and that's something I really think I'll pass on to everybody.\""
