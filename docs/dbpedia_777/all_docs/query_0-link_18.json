        "text": "History Highlight:\n\nZacharias Manuel “Zack” de la Rocha, lead singer of Rage Against the Machine, was born on this date in 1970, making him 54 today. He was born in Long Beach, Calif., to Mexican-American parents with artistic and revolutionary backgrounds. In 1991, he formed Rage Against the Machine with guitarist Tom Morello, drummer Brad Wilk, and bassist Tim Commerford, and they released their self-titled debut the next year. Led by de la Rocha’s powerful lyricism, delivered with a mix of hardcore punk and hip-hop vocal stylings, the band became one of the most aggressive and politically charged acts of a generation. In addition to his work with Rage, de la Rocha formed One Day as a Lion with Mars Volta drummer Jon Theodore in 2008, and has collaborated with Run the Jewels, DJ Shadow, the Roots, and more. Rage Against the Machine, currently disbanded for the third time as of early 2024, were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2023 — though de la Rocha did not attend the ceremony.\n\nAlso, in:\n\n1968 - The Supremes appeared in an episode of the popular NBC show \"Tarzan\". The ladies played a group of nuns.\n\n1969 - Led Zeppelin release their debut album, titled Led Zeppelin.\n\n1971 - Alice Cooper released his third album Love It to Death which went on to become their breakthrough album reaching number 35 on the Billboard 200 Album Chart and selling one million copies in the U.S.\n\n1974 - Jim Croce started a five-week run at No. 1 on the U.S. album chart with You Don't Mess Around With Jim.\n\n1974 - The Steve Miller Band reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles Chart for the first time with \"The Joker\".\n\n1977 - The Police had their first rehearsal, held at drummer's Stewart Copeland's London apartment, with Henri Padovani on guitar.\n\n1977 - EMI Records issued a statement saying it felt unable to promote The Sex Pistols records in view of the adverse publicity generated over the last two months.\n\n1981 - It was reported that the White House had expanded its record library by including albums by Bob Dylan and Kiss.\n\n1995 - The Allman Brothers Band, Al Green, the late Janis Joplin, Led Zeppelin, Martha Reeves & the Vandellas, Neil Young, The Orioles and the late Frank Zappa were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\n1995 - Al Green was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Al might be best known for his signature song, \"Let's Stay Together\", but he had many hits including \"Take Me To The River\", \"Tired of Being Alone\", \"I'm Still In Love With You\" and \"Love and Happiness\". With 29 albums and many awards and accolades under his belt, some have referred to him as \"The Last of the Great Soul Singers\".\n\n1999 - Britney Spears releases her first album, ...Baby One More Time. By the time the album is released, the title track has been out for more than two months and was at #4 in the US. The album easily debuts at #1 just as the song also goes to the top. Another key album release on this date is Sugar Ray’s 14:59.\n\n2003 - Maurice Gibb of The Bee Gees died at a Miami hospital. He was 53. He had suffered a heart attack three days prior to undergoing emergency abdominal surgery.\n\n2010 - Vampire Weekend released their second studio album, Contra. The album received critical praise and debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200. It was recognized as one of The 100 Best Albums of the Decade So Far by Pitchfork in August 2014. Contra covers a far greater range of musical influences than Vampire Weekend’s debut album, drawing inspiration from genres such as ska, synth-pop, speed rap, and rave music. The cover of the album features a candid Polaroid of a girl from 1983. The photo was found by band member Rostam Batmanglij while searching \"New York City 1983\" on Flickr. After the initial success of the album, the model in the picture sued the band for $2 million for using the photo without her permission.\n\n2014 - Beautiful: The Carole King Musical opens on Broadway. It wins a Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album and is nominated for a Tony Award for Best Musical.\n\n2017 - Richard Carpenter said he was owed at least $2 million in royalties for the hits he recorded with The Carpenters. He claimed Universal Music had only paid the band a \"minuscule fraction\" of the money they were owed from downloads on sites like iTunes and Amazon.\n\n2022 - Ronnie Spector died at the age of 78 at her home in Danbury, Connecticut.\n\n2023 - Lisa Marie Presley died at the age of 54.\n\nBirthdays:\n\nTex Ritter was born today in 1905.\n\nLong John Baldry was born today in 1941.\n\nCynthia Robinson of Sly and The Family Stone was born today in 1944.\n\nGeorge Duke was born today in 1946.\n\nChris Bell of Big Star was born today in 1951.\n\nRicky Van Shelton is 72.\n\nFelipe Rose of The Village People is 70.\n\nBlixa Bargeld of Nick Cave And The Bad Seeds is 65.\n\nPer Gessle of Roxette is 65.\n\nRob Zombie is 59.\n\nRaekwon of Wu-Tang Clan is 54.\n\nMelanie Chisholm, a.k.a.
