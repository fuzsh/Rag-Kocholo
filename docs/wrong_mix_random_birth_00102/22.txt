Just Right Products, Inc. (asi/237879) is about to get bigger.

The Texas-based promotional products distributor has received final building permits to construct a new facility of up to 80,000 square feet on a 17.5-acre site in Fort Worth, TX. The location is about five miles from Just Right’s current digs, and the firm said it’s expected to expand production capacity by up to five times.

Construction is set to begin immediately, weather permitting, as materials like necessary fabricated metals are said to be already on site. The goal is to have the building operational before the end of 2024.

“Consolidating operations under one roof will also streamline processes and catalyze additional synergies, which could lead to gross margin and EBITDA margin expansion,” said Marc Johnson, CEO of ADM Endeavors, a publicly traded business that’s parent company to Just Right. “I look forward to providing additional construction updates as we progress.”

Just Right Products, Inc. is ADM’s flagship subsidiary. It operates what the company describes as a diverse vertically integrated business model that consists of a retail sales division, screen-print production, embroidery production, digital production, import wholesale sourcing and uniforms.

Schools/education is an important market for ADM. The firm said the new facility will be a boon for school and government clients that buy uniforms from Just Right, as it will provide a centralized manufacturing hub and expanded school-uniform retail storefront.

The new facility also will deliver opportunities for “diversifying product portfolio and securing additional contracts,” ADM said.

According to ADM, total sales for the company’s most recently reported financial year were $5.3 million.
