Christopher; O'Donoghue, Darragh; Dunlap, Bart H.\n\n2014-07-01\n\nThe introduction of volume phase holographic (VPH) gratings into astronomy over a decade ago opened new possibilities for instrument designers. In this paper we describe an extension of VPH grating technology that will have applications in astronomy and beyond: curved VPH gratings. These devices can disperse light while simultaneously correcting aberrations. We have designed and manufactured two different kinds of convex VPH grating prototypes for use in off-axis reflecting spectrographs. One type functions in transmission and the other in reflection, enabling Offnerstyle spectrographs with the high-efficiency and low-cost advantages of VPH gratings. We will discuss the design process and the tools required for modelling these gratings along with the recording layout and process steps required to fabricate them. We will present performance data for the first convex VPH grating produced for an astronomical spectrograph.\n\nSupport for Taverna workflows in the VPH-Share cloud platform.\n\nPubMed\n\nKasztelnik, Marek; Coto, Ernesto; Bubak, Marian; Malawski, Maciej; Nowakowski, Piotr; Arenas, Juan; Saglimbeni, Alfredo; Testi, Debora; Frangi, Alejandro F\n\n2017-07-01\n\nTo address the increasing need for collaborative endeavours within the Virtual Physiological Human (VPH) community, the VPH-Share collaborative cloud platform allows researchers to expose and share sequences of complex biomedical processing tasks in the form of computational workflows. The Taverna Workflow System is a very popular tool for orchestrating complex biomedical & bioinformatics processing tasks in the VPH community. This paper describes the VPH-Share components that support the building and execution of Taverna workflows, and explains how they interact with other VPH-Share components to improve the capabilities of the VPH-Share platform. Taverna workflow support is delivered by the Atmosphere cloud management platform and the VPH-Share Taverna plugin. These components are explained in detail, along with the two main procedures that were developed to enable this seamless integration: workflow composition and execution. 1) Seamless integration of VPH-Share with other components and systems. 2) Extended range of different tools for workflows. 3) Successful integration of scientific workflows from other VPH projects. 4) Execution speed improvement for medical applications. The presented workflow integration provides VPH-Share users with a wide range of different possibilities to compose and execute workflows, such as desktop or online composition, online batch execution, multithreading, remote execution, etc. The specific advantages of each supported tool are presented, as are the roles of Atmosphere and the VPH-Share plugin within the VPH-Share project. The combination of the VPH-Share plugin and Atmosphere engenders the VPH-Share infrastructure with far more flexible, powerful and usable capabilities for the VPH-Share community. As both components can continue to evolve and improve independently, we acknowledge that further improvements are still to be developed and will be described. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The large clear aperture, the high diffraction efficiency, the line frequency homogeneity, and mosaic alignment made manufacturing and testing challenging. We developed new metrology systems at the AAO to verify the performance of these VPH gratings. The measured diffraction efficiencies and line frequency of the VPH gratings received so far meet the vendor's provided data. The wavefront quality for the Blue VPH grating is good but the Green and Red VPH gratings need to be post polishing.\n\nToward a VPH/Physiome ToolKit.\n\nPubMed\n\nGarny, Alan; Cooper, Jonathan; Hunter, Peter J\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe Physiome Project was officially launched in 1997 and has since brought together teams from around the world to work on the development of a computational framework for the modeling of the human body. At the European level, this effort is focused around patient-specific solutions and is known as the Virtual Physiological Human (VPH) Initiative.Such modeling is both multiscale (in space and time) and multiphysics. This, therefore, requires careful interaction and collaboration between the teams involved in the VPH/Physiome effort, if we are to produce computer models that are not only quantitative, but also integrative and predictive.In that context, several technologies and solutions are already available, developed both by groups involved in the VPH/Physiome effort, and by others. They address areas such as data handling/fusion, markup languages, model repositories, ontologies, tools (for simulation, imaging, data fitting, etc.), as well as grid, middleware, and workflow.Here, we provide an overview of resources that should be considered for inclusion in the VPH/Physiome ToolKit (i.e., the set of tools that addresses the needs and requirements of the Physiome Project and VPH Initiative) and discuss some of the challenges that we are still facing.\n\nTranslation of vph mRNA in Streptomyces lividans and Escherichia coli after removal of the 5' untranslated leader.\n\nPubMed\n\nWu, C J; Janssen, G R\n\n1996-10-01\n\nThe Streptomyces vinaceus viomycin phosphotransferase (vph) mRNA contains an untranslated leader with a conventional Shine-Dalgarno homology. The vph leader was removed by ligation of the vph coding sequence to the transcriptional start site of a Streptomyces or an Escherichia coli promoter, such that transcription would initiate at the first position of the vph start codon. Analysis of mRNA demonstrated that transcription initiated primarily at the A of the vph AUG translational start codon in both Streptomyces lividans and E. coli; cells expressing the unleadered vph mRNA were resistant to viomycin indicating that the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, or other features contained within the leader, was not necessary for vph translation. Addition of four nucleotides (5'-AUGC-3') onto the 5' end of the unleadered vph mRNA resulted in translation initiation from the vph start codon and the AUG triplet contained within the added sequence. Translational fusions of vph sequence to a Tn5 neo reporter gene indicated that the first 16 codons of vph coding sequence were sufficient to specify the translational start site and reading frame for expression of neomycin resistance in both E. coli and S. lividans.\n\nThe VPH1 gene encodes a 95-kDa integral membrane polypeptide required for in vivo assembly and activity of the yeast vacuolar H(+)-ATPase.\n\nPubMed\n\nManolson, M F; Proteau, D; Preston, R A; Stenbit, A; Roberts, B T; Hoyt, M A; Preuss, D; Mulholland, J; Botstein, D; Jones, E W\n\n1992-07-15\n\nYeast vacuolar acidification-defective (vph) mutants were identified using the pH-sensitive fluorescence of 6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate (Preston, R. A., Murphy, R. F., and Jones, E. W. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86, 7027-7031). Vacuoles purified from yeast bearing the vph1-1 mutation had no detectable bafilomycin-sensitive ATPase activity or ATP-dependent proton pumping. The peripherally bound nucleotide-binding subunits of the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase (60 and 69 kDa) were no longer associated with vacuolar membranes yet were present in wild type levels in yeast whole cell extracts. The VPH1 gene was cloned by complementation of the vph1-1 mutation and independently cloned by screening a lambda gt11 expression library with antibodies directed against a 95-kDa vacuolar integral membrane protein. Deletion disruption of the VPH1 gene revealed that the VPH1 gene is not essential for viability but is required for vacuolar H(+)-ATPase assembly and vacuolar acidification. VPH1 encodes a predicted polypeptide of 840 amino acid residues (molecular mass 95.6 kDa) and contains six putative membrane-spanning regions. Cell fractionation and immunodetection demonstrate that Vph1p is a vacuolar integral membrane protein that co-purifies with vacuolar H(+)-ATPase activity. Multiple sequence alignments show extensive homology over the entire lengths of the following four polypeptides: Vph1p, the 116-kDa polypeptide of the rat clathrin-coated vesicles/synaptic vesicle proton pump, the predicted polypeptide encoded by the yeast gene STV1 (Similar To VPH1, identified as an open reading frame next to the BUB2 gene), and the TJ6 mouse immune suppressor factor.\n\nvph6 mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae require calcineurin for growth and are defective in vacuolar H(+)-ATPase assembly.\n\nPubMed\n\nHemenway, C S; Dolinski, K; Cardenas, M E; Hiller, M A; Jones, E W; Heitman, J\n\n1995-11-01\n\nWe have characterized a Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant strain that is hypersensitive to cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506, immunosuppressants that inhibit calcineurin, a serine-threonine-specific phosphatase (PP2B). A single nuclear mutation, designated cev1 for calcineurin essential for viability, is responsible for the CsA-FK506-sensitive phenotype. The peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases cyclophilin A and FKBP12, respectively, mediate CsA and FK506 toxicity in the cev1 mutant strain. We demonstrate that cev1 is an allele of the VPH6 gene and that vph6 mutant strains fail to assemble the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase). The VPH6 gene was mapped on chromosome VIII and is predicted to encode a 181-amino acid (21 kD) protein with no identity to other known proteins. We find that calcineurin is essential for viability in many mutant strains with defects in V-ATPase function or vacuolar acidification. In addition, we find that calcineurin modulates extracellular acidification in response to glucose, which we propose occurs via calcineurin regulation of the plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase PMA1. Taken together, our findings suggest calcineurin plays a general role in the regulation of cation transport and homeostasis.\n\nPapiloma invertido sinunasal con invasiÃ³n intracraneal: Reporte de caso y revisiÃ³n bibliogrÃ¡fica\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDi Pietrantonio, AndrÃ©s; Asmus, Humberto; Ingratta, Christian; Brennan, Walter; Schulz, Javier; Carballo, Leandro\n\n2018-01-01\n\nResumen IntroducciÃn: El papiloma invertido es una neoplasia benigna de los senos paranasales localmente agresiva con alto potencial de recurrencia y de malignizaciÃ³n. La extensiÃ³n intracraneal es infrecuente y mÃ¡s aÃºn, la penetraciÃ³n dural, asociÃ¡ndose a menudo a la recurrencia de la enfermedad o a su degeneraciÃ³n en carcinoma de cÃ©lulas escamosas.

L.; Haynes, P.; Brewer, P.\n\n2003-05-01\n\nWe report on the development and testing of what we believe to be the first VPH grating based spectrograph developed primarily for use at telescopes of modest aperture. To date, the most common instrument suite for such observatories is typically that of a CCD camera with attached filter wheel. While there is no doubt that a wide range of interesting and good science has been done with such instrumentation, the addition of a robust and easy to operate spectrograph would greatly increase the utility of such installations. While some commercial spectrographs exist for use on small telescopes, the authors have found them to be, with few exceptions, either inefficient, difficult for inexperienced students or amateurs to use, or not remotely operable. Correcting these deficiencies is thus the primary motivation for Mini-Spec. The design of Mini-Spec has been influenced by previous work the authors have done on a full-sized fiber-coupled spectrograph (Nations and Pierce, 2002). Mini-Spec uses some of those original design features, only reduced drastically in size. This size reduction (the spectrograph fits within a 7 inch cube), along with a much more careful choice of some critical components, has resulted in a dramatic reduction in cost. The spectrograph uses a highly efficient 1200 l/mm, 40 mm diameter vph grating on loan from Richard Rallison. Focus, central wavelength selection, and comparison lamps are all controlled via an RS-232 link and a custom Visual Basic GUI. Sample spectra of stellar and non-stellar targets will be presented along with a discussion of research projects admirably suited for this instrument. Funding for equipment has been provided by a NASA EPSCoR grant to PI Ron Canterna. HLN has been partially funded by a Wyoming Space Grant Faculty Fellowship.\n\nComparing modelling techniques when designing VPH gratings for BigBOSS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPoppett, Claire; Edelstein, Jerry; Lampton, Michael; Jelinsky, Patrick; Arns, James\n\n2012-09-01\n\nBigBOSS is a Stage IV Dark Energy instrument based on the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Red Shift Distortions (RSD) techniques using spectroscopic data of 20 million ELG and LRG galaxies at 0.5<=z<=1.6 in addition to several hundred thousand QSOs at 0.5<=z<=3.5. When designing BigBOSS instrumentation, it is imperative to maximize throughput whilst maintaining a resolving power of between R=1500 and 4000 over a wavelength range of 360-980 nm. Volume phase Holographic (VPH) gratings have been identified as a key technology which will enable the efficiency requirement to be met, however it is important to be able to accurately predict their performance. In this paper we quantitatively compare different modelling techniques in order to assess the parameter space over which they are more capable of accurately predicting measured performance. Finally we present baseline parameters for grating designs that are most suitable for the BigBOSS instrument.\n\nOpenCMISS: a multi-physics & multi-scale computational infrastructure for the VPH/Physiome project.\n\nPubMed\n\nBradley, Chris; Bowery, Andy; Britten, Randall; Budelmann, Vincent; Camara, Oscar; Christie, Richard; Cookson, Andrew; Frangi, Alejandro F; Gamage, Thiranja Babarenda; Heidlauf, Thomas; Krittian, Sebastian; Ladd, David; Little, Caton; Mithraratne, Kumar; Nash, Martyn; Nickerson, David; Nielsen, Poul; NordbÃ¸, Oyvind; Omholt, Stig; Pashaei, Ali; Paterson, David; Rajagopal, Vijayaraghavan; Reeve, Adam; RÃ¶hrle, Oliver; Safaei, Soroush; SebastiÃ¡n, Rafael; SteghÃ¶fer, Martin; Wu, Tim; Yu, Ting; Zhang, Heye; Hunter, Peter\n\n2011-10-01\n\nThe VPH/Physiome Project is developing the model encoding standards CellML (cellml.org) and FieldML (fieldml.org) as well as web-accessible model repositories based on these standards (models.physiome.org). Freely available open source computational modelling software is also being developed to solve the partial differential equations described by the models and to visualise results. The OpenCMISS code (opencmiss.org), described here, has been developed by the authors over the last six years to replace the CMISS code that has supported a number of organ system Physiome projects. OpenCMISS is designed to encompass multiple sets of physical equations and to link subcellular and tissue-level biophysical processes into organ-level processes. In the Heart Physiome project, for example, the large deformation mechanics of the myocardial wall need to be coupled to both ventricular flow and embedded coronary flow, and the reaction-diffusion equations that govern the propagation of electrical waves through myocardial tissue need to be coupled with equations that describe the ion channel currents that flow through the cardiac cell membranes. In this paper we discuss the design principles and distributed memory architecture behind the OpenCMISS code. We also discuss the design of the interfaces that link the sets of physical equations across common boundaries (such as fluid-structure coupling), or between spatial fields over the same domain (such as coupled electromechanics), and the concepts behind CellML and FieldML that are embodied in the OpenCMISS data structures. We show how all of these provide a flexible infrastructure for combining models developed across the VPH/Physiome community. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

A cost-utility analysis was performed using the MarkovÂ´s hidden model in a hypothetical cohort of peruvian women, based on the information on epidemiological parameters, costs associated to uterine cervical cancer (UCC) and the efficacy and costs of the vaccine against the HPV. The vaccination costs were estimated from the Peruvian Ministry of Health perspective and were compared against the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), using a discount rate of 5%. The annual cost of the vaccination was USD 16,861,490, for the Papanicoau screening it was USD 3,060,793 and the costs associated to the UCC were USD 15,580,000. The incremental cost utility ratio (ICUR) was 6,775 USD/QALY. Vaccination against HPV can be cost-utility compared to not vaccinating.\n\n[Combination of etoposide, cisplatin and ifosfamide (VPH) in the salvage chemotherapy of relapsing or refractory aggressive malignant lymphoma. Study of 51 patients].\n\nPubMed\n\nEghbali, H; Catry-Thomas, I; Soubeyran, P; Bonnel, C; Hoerni, B\n\n1994-09-01\n\nFifty-one patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma refractory or relapsing after CHOP-like regimen, underwent a salvage chemotherapy by VPH: etoposide 100 mg/m2/d, D1 to D3, cisplatin 20 mg/m2/d, D1 to D5, ifosfamide 1 g/m2/d D1 to D5, mesna 1.2 g/m2/d D1 to D5, every 4 weeks. Among 46 evaluable patients for efficacy, 21 (45.6%) achieved complete or partial response according to WHO criteria and 25 (54.3%) failed, while five cases (9.8% of all patients) were not evaluable (two initial complete remission before VPH, two early toxic deaths and one confusional syndrome). Thirty-five patients (68.6%) died of lymphoma, three (5.8%) of acute toxicity and 13 (25.5%) are alive: five in complete remission. The toxicity is mainly myelo-suppression, digestive and renal but could be managed as usually. Although the follow-up is short, this regimen appears effective in these circumstances after CHOP failure but it should be used early, before overt chemoresistance. It does not hinder a bone marrow transplantation programme.\n\nThe reconstructed ancestral subunit a functions as both V-ATPase isoforms Vph1p and Stv1p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFinnigan, Gregory C.; Hanson-Smith, Victor; Houser, Benjamin D.; Park, Hae J.; Stevens, Tom H.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe vacuolar-type, proton-translocating ATPase (V-ATPase) is a multisubunit enzyme responsible for organelle acidification in eukaryotic cells. Many organisms have evolved V-ATPase subunit isoforms that allow for increased specialization of this critical enzyme. Differential targeting of the V-ATPase to specific subcellular organelles occurs in eukaryotes from humans to budding yeast. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the two subunit a isoforms are the only difference between the two V-ATPase populations. Incorporation of Vph1p or Stv1p into the V-ATPase dictates the localization of the V-ATPase to the vacuole or late Golgi/endosome, respectively. A duplication event within fungi gave rise to two subunit a genes. We used ancestral gene reconstruction to generate the most recent common ancestor of Vph1p and Stv1p (Anc.a) and tested its function in yeast. Anc.a localized to both the Golgi/endosomal network and vacuolar membrane and acidified these compartments as part of a hybrid V-ATPase complex. Trafficking of Anc.a did not require retrograde transport from the late endosome to the Golgi that has evolved for retrieval of the Stv1p isoform. Rather, Anc.a localized to both structures through slowed anterograde transport en route to the vacuole. Our results suggest an evolutionary model that describes the differential localization of the two yeast V-ATPase isoforms.

While the intrinsic Nernst response of an electrolyte/site-binding interface is fundamental and immutable, we show that by using channels of different materials, areas, and bias conditions, the extrinsic sensor response can be increased dramatically beyond the Nernst limit. We validate the theory by measuring the pH response of a Si nanowire-nanoplate transistor pair that achieves >10 V/pH response and show the potential of the scheme to achieve (asymptotically) the theoretical lower limit of signal-to-noise ratio for a given configuration. We suggest the possibility of an even larger pH response based on recent trends in heterogeneous integration on the Si platform.\n\nThe Virtual Physiological Human ToolKit.\n\nPubMed\n\nCooper, Jonathan; Cervenansky, Frederic; De Fabritiis, Gianni; Fenner, John; Friboulet, Denis; Giorgino, Toni; Manos, Steven; Martelli, Yves; VillÃ -Freixa, Jordi; Zasada, Stefan; Lloyd, Sharon; McCormack, Keith; Coveney, Peter V\n\n2010-08-28\n\nThe Virtual Physiological Human (VPH) is a major European e-Science initiative intended to support the development of patient-specific computer models and their application in personalized and predictive healthcare. The VPH Network of Excellence (VPH-NoE) project is tasked with facilitating interaction between the various VPH projects and addressing issues of common concern. A key deliverable is the 'VPH ToolKit'--a collection of tools, methodologies and services to support and enable VPH research, integrating and extending existing work across Europe towards greater interoperability and sustainability. Owing to the diverse nature of the field, a single monolithic 'toolkit' is incapable of addressing the needs of the VPH. Rather, the VPH ToolKit should be considered more as a 'toolbox' of relevant technologies, interacting around a common set of standards. The latter apply to the information used by tools, including any data and the VPH models themselves, and also to the naming and categorizing of entities and concepts involved. Furthermore, the technologies and methodologies available need to be widely disseminated, and relevant tools and services easily found by researchers. The VPH-NoE has thus created an online resource for the VPH community to meet this need. It consists of a database of tools, methods and services for VPH research, with a Web front-end. This has facilities for searching the database, for adding or updating entries, and for providing user feedback on entries. Anyone is welcome to contribute.\n\nVeterinary public health in India: current status and future needs.\n\nPubMed\n\nGhatak, S; Singh, B B\n\n2015-12-01\n\nVeterinary public health (VPH) assumes huge significance in developing countries such as India. However, the implementation of VPH services throughout the country is still in its infancy. From 1970 onwards, many institutes, national and international organisations, professional societies, policies and personalities have contributed towards the development of VPH in India. Nevertheless, there is an urgent need to develop VPH still further as there are many issues, such as high population density, the re-emergence of zoonotic pathogens, environmental pollution and antimicrobial resistance, that require attention. The time has surely come to involve all stakeholders, ranging from primary producers (e.g., farmers) to policy-makers, so as to garner support for the holistic implementation of VPH services in India. To improve VPH activities and services, science-based policies enforced through stringent regulation are required to improve human, animal and environmental health. The emergence of the 'One Health' concept has ushered in new hopes for the resurrection of VPH in India. Applying tools such as the World Organisation for Animal Health (OlE) Day One Competencies and the OlE Tool for the Evaluation of Performance of Veterinary Services (PVS Tool) is essential to improve the quality of national Veterinary Services and to identify gaps and weaknesses in service provision, which can be remedied to comply with the OlE international standards. VPH initiatives started modestly but they continue to grow. The present review is focused on the current status and future needs of VPH in India.\n\nGenes Required for Vacuolar Acidity in Saccharomyces Cerevisiae\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPreston, R. A.; Reinagel, P. S.; Jones, E. W.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nMutations that cause loss of acidity in the vacuole (lysosome) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were identified by screening colonies labeled with the fluorescent, pH-sensitive, vacuolar labeling agent, 6-carboxyfluorescein. Thirty nine vacuolar pH (Vph(-)) mutants were identified. Four of these contained mutant alleles of the previously described PEP3, PEP5, PEP6 and PEP7 genes. The remaining mutants defined eight complementation groups of vph mutations. No alleles of the VAT2 or TFP1 genes (known to encode subunits of the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase) were identified in the Vph(-) screen. Strains bearing mutations in any of six of the VPH genes failed to grow on medium buffered at neutral pH; otherwise, none of the vph mutations caused notable growth inhibition on standard yeast media. Expression of the vacuolar protease, carboxypeptidase Y, was defective in strains bearing vph4 mutations but was apparently normal in strains bearing any of the other vph mutations. Defects in vacuolar morphology at the light microscope level were evident in all Vph(-) mutants. Strains that contained representative mutant alleles of the 17 previously described PEP genes were assayed for vacuolar pH; mutations in seven of the PEP genes (including PEP3, PEP5, PEP6 and PEP7) caused loss of vacuolar acidity.

The authors propose to supplement the scale VPH-P(SP) with the index of the patient's age, and the scale VPH-P(MT)--with an index of the blood loss volume.\n\nEffect of biochar or activated carbon amendment on the volatilisation and biodegradation of organic soil pollutants\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWerner, David; Meynet, Paola; Bushnaf, Khaled\n\n2013-04-01\n\nBiochar or activated carbon added to contaminated soil may temporarily reduce the volatilisation of organic pollutants by enhanced sorption. The long-term effect of sorbent amendments on the fate of volatile petroleum hydrocarbon mixtures (VPHs) will depend on the responses of the soil bacterial community members, especially those which may utilize VPHs as carbon substrates. We investigated the volatilisation and biodegradation of VPHs emanating from NAPL sources and migrating through one meter long columns containing unsaturated sandy soil with and without 2% biochar or activated carbon amendment. After 420 days, VPH volatilisation from AC amended soil was less than 10 percent of the cumulative VPH volatilisation flux from unamended soil. The cumulative CO2 volatilisation flux increased more slowly in AC amended soil, but was comparable to the untreated soil after 420 days. This indicated that the pollution attenuation over a 1 meter distance was improved by the AC amendment. Biochar was a weaker VPH sorbent than AC and had a lesser effect on the cumulative VPH and CO2 fluxes. We also investgated the predominant bacterial community responses in sandy soil to biochar and/or VPH addition with a factorially designed batch study, and by analyzing preserved soil samples. Biochar addition alone had only weak effects on soil bacterial communities, while VPH addition was a strong community structure shaping factor. The bacterial community effects of biochar-enhanced VPH sorption were moderated by the limited biomass carrying capacity of the sandy soil investigated which contained only low amounts of inorganic nitrogen. Several Pseudomonas spp., including Pseudomonas putida strains, became dominant in VPH polluted soil with and without biochar. The ability of these versatile VPH degraders to effectively regulate their metabolic pathways according to substrate availabilities may additionally have moderated bacterial community structure responses to the presence of biochar\n\nA vision and strategy for the virtual physiological human: 2012 update.\n\nPubMed\n\nHunter, Peter; Chapman, Tara; Coveney, Peter V; de Bono, Bernard; Diaz, Vanessa; Fenner, John; Frangi, Alejandro F; Harris, Peter; Hose, Rod; Kohl, Peter; Lawford, Pat; McCormack, Keith; Mendes, Miriam; Omholt, Stig; Quarteroni, Alfio; Shublaq, Nour; SkÃ¥r, John; Stroetmann, Karl; Tegner, Jesper; Thomas, S Randall; Tollis, Ioannis; Tsamardinos, Ioannis; van Beek, Johannes H G M; Viceconti, Marco\n\n2013-04-06\n\nEuropean funding under Framework 7 (FP7) for the virtual physiological human (VPH) project has been in place now for 5 years.

The VPH community is developing from a multitude of relatively focused, but disparate, research endeavours into an integrated effort to bring together, develop and translate emerging technologies for application, from academia to industry and medicine. This process initially builds on the evolution of multi-disciplinary interactions and abilities, but addressing the challenges associated with the implementation of the VPH will require, in the very near future, a translation of quantitative changes into a new quality of highly trained multi-disciplinary personnel. Current strategies for undergraduate and on-the-job training may soon prove insufficient for this. The European Commission seventh framework VPH network of excellence is exploring this emerging need, and is developing a framework of novel training initiatives to address the predicted shortfall in suitably skilled VPH-aware professionals. This paper reports first steps in the implementation of a coherent VPH training portfolio.\n\nExperimental and Analytical Research on Resonance Phenomena of Vibrating Head with MRE Regulating Element\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMiedziÅska, D.; Gieleta, R.; OsiÅski, J.\n\n2015-02-01\n\nA vibratory pile hammer (VPH) is a mechanical device used to drive steel piles as well as tube piles into soil to provide foundation support for buildings or other structures. In order to increase the stability and the efficiency of the VPH work in the over-resonance frequency, a new VPH construction was developed at the Military University of Technology. The new VPH contains a system of counter-rotating eccentric weights, powered by hydraulic motors, and designed in such a way that horizontal vibrations cancel out, while vertical vibrations are transmitted into the pile. This system is suspended in the static parts by the adaptive variable stiffness pillows based on a smart material, magnetorheological elastomer (MRE), whose rheological and mechanical properties can be reversibly and rapidly controlled by an external magnetic field. The work presented in the paper is a part of the modified VPH construction design process. It concerns the experimental research on the vibrations during the piling process and the analytical analyses of the gained signal. The results will be applied in the VPH control system.\n\nCryogenic Volume-Phase Holographic Grisms for MOIRCS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEbizuka, Noboru; Ichiyama, Kotaro; Yamada, Toru; Tokoku, Chihiro; Onodera, Masato; Hanesaka, Mai; Kodate, Kashiko; Katsuno Uchimoto, Yuka; Maruyama, Miyoko; Shimasaku, Kazuhiro; Tanaka, Ichi; Yoshikawa, Tomohiro; Kashikawa, Nobunari; Iye, Masanori; Ichikawa, Takashi\n\n2011-03-01\n\nWe have developed high-dispersion VPH (volume phase holographic) grisms with zinc selenide (ZnSe) prisms for the cryogenic optical system of MOIRCS (Multi-Object near-InfraRed Camera and Spectrograph) for Y-, J-, H-, and K-band observations. We fabricated VPH gratings using a hologram resin. After several heat cycles at between room temperature and 120 K, the VPH gratings were assembled to grisms by gluing with two ZnSe prisms. Several heat cycles were also carried out for the grisms before being installed into MOIRCS. We measured the efficiencies of the VPH grisms in a laboratory, and found them to be 70%-82%. The performances obtained by observations of MOIRCS with the 8.2 m Subaru Telescope have been found to be very consistent with the results in the laboratory test. This is the first astronomical application of cryogenic VPH grisms.\n\nMise Ã jour sur le nouveau vaccin 9-valent pour la prÃ©vention du virus du papillome humain\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYang, David Yi; Bracken, Keyna\n\n2016-01-01\n\nRÃ©sumÃ© Objectif Informer les mÃ©decins de famille quant Ã lâefficacitÃ©, Ã lâinnocuitÃ©, aux effets sur la santÃ© publique et Ã la rentabilitÃ© du vaccin 9-valent contre le virus du papillome humain (VPH).

This has led professionals involved in both animal health and public health to recognize veterinary public health (VPH) as a key area for their activities to address the human-animal interface. Veterinarians, a profession with major involvement in this field, are in need of specific knowledge and skills to prevent and control public-health problems. As a result, VPH must be directly integrated into veterinary educational programs. At present, only few veterinary schools have specific VPH programs; in most institutions, VPH does not feature as a specific subject in either undergraduate or post-graduate curricula. SAPUVET and SAPUVETNET II are network projects supported by the ALFA program of the European Union (EU). Their main objectives are to reach a common understanding between European and Latin American universities in the definition of the areas in which VPH is important in their respective countries, and to design a harmonized training program for veterinarians in VPH, by making use of new technological applications and innovative teaching methodologies. The elaboration of educational material in combination with case studies presenting real-life problems provides a basis to apply the knowledge acquired on VPH. It is envisaged that the material and modules developed during the two projects will be integrated into the veterinary curricula of the participating universities, as well as in other partner organizations.\n\nVisceral pain hypersensitivity in functional gastrointestinal disorders.\n\nPubMed\n\nFarmer, A D; Aziz, Q\n\n2009-01-01\n\nFunctional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are a highly prevalent group of heterogeneous disorders whose diagnostic criteria are symptom based in the absence of a demonstrable structural or biochemical abnormality. Chronic abdominal pain or discomfort is a defining characteristic of these disorders and a proportion of patients may display heightened pain sensitivity to experimental visceral stimulation, termed visceral pain hypersensitivity (VPH). We examined the most recent literature in order to concisely review the evidence for some of the most important recent advances in the putative mechanisms concerned in the pathophysiology of VPH. VPH may occur due to anomalies at any level of the visceral nociceptive neuraxis. Important peripheral and central mechanisms of sensitization that have been postulated include a wide range of ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors and trophic factors. Data from functional brain imaging studies have also provided evidence for aberrant central pain processing in cortical and subcortical regions. In addition, descending modulation of visceral nociceptive pathways by the autonomic nervous system, hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis and psychological factors have all been implicated in the generation of VPH. Particular areas of controversy have included the development of efficacious treatment of VPH. Therapies have been slow to emerge, mainly due to concerns regarding safety. The burgeoning field of genome wide association studies may provide further evidence for the pleiotropic genetic basis of VPH development. Tangible progress will only be made in the treatment of VPH when we begin to individually characterize patients with FGIDs based on their clinical phenotype, genetics and visceral nociceptive physiology.\n\n[Molecular genetics in chronic myeloid leukemia with variant Ph translocation].\n\nPubMed\n\nWu, Wei; Li, Jian-yong; Zhu, Yu; Qiu, Hai-rong; Pan, Jin-lan; Xu, Wei; Chen, Li-juan; Shen, Yun-feng; Xue, Yong-quan\n\n2007-08-01\n\nTo explore the value of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) techniques in the detection of genetic changes in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with variant Philadelphia translocation (vPh). Cytogenetic preparations from 10 CML patients with vPh confirmed by R banding were assayed with dual color dual fusion FISH technique. If only one fusion signal was detected in interphase cells, metaphase cells were observed to determine if there were derivative chromosome 9[der (9)] deletions. Meanwhile, the same cytogenetic preparations were assayed with M-FISH technique. Of the 10 CML patients with vPh, 5 were detected with der (9) deletions by FISH technique. M-FISH technique revealed that besides the chromosome 22, chromosomes 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11 and 17 were also involved in the vPh. M-FISH technique also detected the abnormalities which were not found with conventional cytogenetics (CC), including two never reported abnormalities. The combination of CC, FISH and M-FISH technique could refine the genetic diagnosis of CML with vPh.\n\nThe Virtual Physiological Human - a European initiative for in silico human modelling -.\n\nPubMed\n\nViceconti, Marco; Clapworthy, Gordon; Van Sint Jan, Serge\n\n2008-12-01\n\nThe Virtual Physiological Human (VPH) is an initiative, strongly supported by the European Commission (EC), that seeks to develop an integrated model of human physiology at multiple scales from the whole body through the organ, tissue, cell and molecular levels to the genomic level. VPH had its beginnings in 2005 with informal discussions amongst like-minded scientists which led to the STEP project, a Coordination Action funded by the EC that began in early 2006. The STEP project greatly accelerated the progress of the VPH and proved to be a catalyst for wide-ranging discussions within Europe and for outreach activities designed to develop a broad international approach to the huge scientific and technological challenges involved in this area. This paper provides an overview of the VPH and the developments it has engendered in the rapidly expanding worldwide activities associated with the physiome. It then uses one particular project, the Living Human Project, to illustrate the type of advances that are taking place to further the aims of the VPH and similar initiatives worldwide.\n\nCharacterization of Freshwater EM Sub Bottom Sediment Properties and Target Responses for Detection of UXO with Ground-Penetrating RADAR (GPR)\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2008-09-01\n\nsuch that n*= âÎµ*.

The cytoplasm is acidified when V-ATPase is inhibited; thus we conducted a high-throughput screen of a chemical library to search for compounds that acidify the yeast cytosol in vivo using pHluorin-based flow cytometry. Two inhibitors, alexidine dihydrochloride (EC(50) = 39 Î¼M) and thonzonium bromide (EC(50) = 69 Î¼M), prevented ATP-dependent proton transport in purified vacuolar membranes. They acidified the yeast cytosol and caused pH-sensitive growth defects typical of V-ATPase mutants (vma phenotype). At concentrations greater than 10 Î¼M the inhibitors were cytotoxic, even at the permissive pH (pH 5.0). Membrane fractions treated with alexidine dihydrochloride and thonzonium bromide fully retained concanamycin A-sensitive ATPase activity despite the fact that proton translocation was inhibited by 80-90%, indicating that V-ATPases were uncoupled. Mutant V-ATPase membranes lacking residues 362-407 of the tether of Vph1p subunit a of V(0) were resistant to thonzonium bromide but not to alexidine dihydrochloride, suggesting that this conserved sequence confers uncoupling potential to V(1)V(0) complexes and that alexidine dihydrochloride uncouples the enzyme by a different mechanism. The inhibitors also uncoupled the Candida albicans enzyme and prevented cell growth, showing further specificity for V-ATPases. Thus, a new class of V-ATPase inhibitors (uncouplers), which are not simply ionophores, provided new insights into the enzyme mechanism and original evidence supporting the hypothesis that V-ATPases may not be optimally coupled in vivo. The consequences of uncoupling V-ATPases in vivo as potential drug targets are discussed.\n\nSurvival implications of molecular heterogeneity in variant Philadelphia-positive chronic myeloid leukaemia.\n\nPubMed\n\nReid, Alistair G; Huntly, Brian J P; Grace, Colin; Green, Anthony R; Nacheva, Elisabeth P\n\n2003-05-01\n\nThe BCR-ABL fusion in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is generated by the Philadelphia (Ph) translocation t(9;22) or, in 10% of patients, variants thereof (vPh). Deletion encompassing the reciprocal product (ABL-BCR) from the derivative chromosome 9 [der(9)] occurs in 15% of all patients, but with greater frequency in vPh patients. Reports of physical separation of ABL-BCR in non-deleted patients, as well as evolution from classical to variant Ph, introduce further heterogeneity to the vPh subgroup and raise the possibility that such translocations may herald disease progression. Survival analyses, however, have thus far yielded contradictory results. We assessed the frequency of der(9) deletions, ABL-BCR abrogation, cytogenetic evolution and cryptic rearrangement in a large cohort of 54 patients with vPh CML. Deletions encompassing ABL-BCR were detected in 37% of patients, consistent with a model in which a greater number of chromosome breaks increases the risk of genomic loss. The components of ABL-BCR were physically separated in a further 52% of patients while fused in the remaining 11%. Evolution from classical to vPh was demonstrated in three patients. The difference in survival, as indicated by Kaplan-Meier analysis, was marked between classical and vPh patients (105 vs 60 months respectively; P = 0.0002). Importantly, this difference disappeared when patients with deletions were removed from the analysis. Our study showed that, despite the existence of several levels of genomic heterogeneity in variant Ph-positive CML, der(9) deletion status is the key prognostic factor.\n\nA Compact, Pi-Mode Extraction Scheme for the Axial B-Field Recirculating Planar Magnetron\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2012-07-23\n\nFigure 4).

Within Europe, this has its focus in the virtual physiological human (VPH), which is an evolving entity that has emerged from the EuroPhysiome initiative and the strategy for the EuroPhysiome (STEP) consortium. The VPH is intended to be a solution to common infrastructure needs for physiome projects across the globe, providing a unifying architecture that facilitates integration and prediction, ultimately creating a framework capable of describing Homo sapiens in silico. The routine reliance of the biomedical industry, biomedical research and clinical practice on information technology (IT) highlights the importance of a tailor-made and robust IT infrastructure, but numerous challenges need to be addressed if the VPH is to become a mature technological reality. Appropriate investment will reap considerable rewards, since it is anticipated that the VPH will influence all sectors of society, with implications predominantly for improved healthcare, improved competitiveness in industry and greater understanding of (patho)physiological processes. This paper considers issues pertinent to the development of the VPH, highlighted by the work of the STEP consortium.\n\nThermoresponsiveness of hybrid micelles from poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(4-vinylpyridium) cations and SO4(2-) anions in aqueous solutions.\n\nPubMed\n\nWu, Kai; Shi, Linqi; Zhang, Wangqing; An, Yingli; Zhang, Xu; Li, Zhanyong; Zhu, X X\n\n2006-02-14\n\nThe SO4(2-)-induced micellization of poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(4-vinylpyridium) (PEG110-b-P(4-VPH+)35) and the thermoresponsiveness of these hybrid micelles are studied by dynamic and static light scattering. When the concentration of H2SO4 is high enough, PEG110-b-P(4-VPH+)35 forms stable hybrid micelles with an ionic core of P(4-VPH+)35/SO4(2-) and a PEG corona at 25 degrees C. The formation of the hybrid micelles is reversible. A thermodynamic equilibrium exists between the hybrid micelles and PEG110-b-P(4-VPH+)35 unimers. The shifts of the equilibrium are mainly attributed to the variation of the electrostatic energy and entropic energy of the system. Therefore, the temperature can determine the states of the equilibrium, which means that the dissociation or the formation of the hybrid micelles can be triggered by just varying the temperature.\n\nVertical parasagittal hemispherotomy for Sturge-Weber syndrome in early infancy: case report and literature review.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Xiangyu; Otsuki, Taisuke; Takahashi, Akio; Kaido, Takanobu\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe authors here present a rare case of a 3-month-old infant with unilateral Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) who had excellent seizure control and no aggravation of previous existed neurological deficits after verticalÂ parasagittal hemispherotomy (VPH). To our knowledge, this patient with SWS was the youngest one who received VPH. The use of VPH results in a successful treatment of intractable epilepsy in a patient with seizure onset in early infancy. At follow-up, the patient's neurodevelopmental status has been improved since the surgery. It is generally accepted that early-onset seizures in children with SWS are associated with worse neurological and developmental outcomes. However, when surgical treatment should be considered and how it should be performed remain a longstanding controversy. We promote early surgery in children with SWS and early-onset epilepsy. We suggest that VPH may be a useful adjuvant in the management of SWS with refractory epilepsy in early infancy and this procedure carries low neurological risk.\n\nKnowledge environments representing molecular entities for the virtual physiological human.\n\nPubMed\n\nHofmann-Apitius, Martin; Fluck, Juliane; Furlong, Laura; Fornes, Oriol; KolÃ¡rik, Corinna; Hanser, Susanne; Boeker, Martin; Schulz, Stefan; Sanz, Ferran; Klinger, Roman; Mevissen, Theo; Gattermayer, Tobias; Oliva, Baldo; Friedrich, Christoph M\n\n2008-09-13\n\nIn essence, the virtual physiological human (VPH) is a multiscale representation of human physiology spanning from the molecular level via cellular processes and multicellular organization of tissues to complex organ function. The different scales of the VPH deal with different entities, relationships and processes, and in consequence the models used to describe and simulate biological functions vary significantly. Here, we describe methods and strategies to generate knowledge environments representing molecular entities that can be used for modelling the molecular scale of the VPH. Our strategy to generate knowledge environments representing molecular entities is based on the combination of information extraction from scientific text and the integration of information from biomolecular databases. We introduce @neuLink, a first prototype of an automatically generated, disease-specific knowledge environment combining biomolecular, chemical, genetic and medical information. Finally, we provide a perspective for the future implementation and use of knowledge environments representing molecular entities for the VPH.\n\nWaveform Modeling of the Crust and Upper Mantle Using S, Sp, SsPmP, and Shear-Coupled PL Waves\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2008-05-10\n\nand excitation of shear-coupled Pl waves with distance and corresponding phase velocity ( Vph )-period (T) curve: Î±N and Î²N are the P and S wave...Pulliam and Sen, 2005) (b) Propagation characteristics and excitation of shear-coupled Pl waves with distance and corresponding phase velocity ( Vph\n\nEnvironmental Assessment: Installation of Thermally Stable Jet Fuel (JPTS) Above Ground Storage System Westover Air Reserve Base, Chicopee, Massachusetts\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2004-06-30\n\ngasoline fuels is a result ofleaking USTs in the Aqua System Site (SS-19) to the north.

The VPH grating was mounted in a cryogenically compatible optical mount and tested in situ in a cryostat. The nominal root mean square (RMS) wavefront error at room temperature was 19 nm measured over a 50 mm diameter test aperture. The WFE remained at 18 nm RMS when the grating was cooled. This important result demonstrates that excellent WFE performance can be obtained with cooled VPH gratings, as required for use in future cryogenic infrared astronomical spectrometers planned for the European Extremely Large Telescope.\n\nRotational Isomers, Intramolecular Hydrogen Bond, and IR Spectra of o-Vinylphenol Homologs\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGlazunov, V.

To address the expected shortage of veterinarians in these areas, the Utrecht Faculty of Veterinary Medicine has developed an admissions procedure to select undergraduates whose aptitude and interests are suited to these areas. A study using expert meetings, open interviews, and document analysis identified personal characteristics that distinguished veterinarians working in the areas of FA and VPH from their colleagues who specialized in companion animals (CA) and equine medicine (E). The outcomes were used to create a written selection tool. We validated this tool in a study among undergraduate veterinary students in their final (sixth) year before graduation. The applicability of the tool was verified in a study among first-year students who had opted to pursue either FA/VPH or CA/E. The tool revealed statistically significant differences with acceptable effect sizes between the two student groups. Because the written selection tool did not cover all of the differences between the veterinarians who specialized in FA/VPH and those who specialized in CA/E, we developed a prestructured panel interview and added it to the questionnaire. The evaluation of the written component showed that it was suitable for selecting those students who were most likely to succeed in the FA/VPH track.\n\nInnovative Roadway Design for Recreation Areas.\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1982-02-01\n\nVolume Roadways by Terrain Condition (Kearney, 1979) DHV* Maximum Grade (M) ( vph ) Level Rolling Mountainous 100 7 10 12 100-400 7 9 10 400 6 7 9 * DHV...design hourly volume; vph = vehicles per hour. j.

All of the compounds were potent competitive inhibitors of 4-OT with the monocarboxylated 2E-fluoro-2,4-pentadienoate and the dicarboxylated 2E-fluoro-2-en-4-ynoate being the most potent. Despite the close mechanistic and structural similarities between 4-OT and YwhB, these compounds were significantly less potent inhibitors of YwhB with K(i) values ranging from 5- to 633-fold lower than those determined for 4-OT. The study of VPH is complicated by the fact that the enzyme is only active as a complex with the metal-dependent 4-oxalocrotonate decarboxylase (4-OD), the enzyme following 4-OT in the catechol meta-fission pathway. A structure-based sequence analysis identified 4-OD as a member of the fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) superfamily and implicated Glu-109 and Glu-111 as potential metal-binding ligands. Changing these residues to a glutamine verified their importance for enzymatic activity and enabled the production of soluble E109Q4-OD/VPH or E111Q4-OD/VPH complexes, which retained full hydratase activity but had little decarboxylase activity. Subsequent incubation of the E109Q4-OD/VPH complex with the substrate analogues identified the 2E and 2Z isomers of the monocarboxylated 2-fluoropent-2-en-4-ynoate as competitive inhibitors. The combined results set the stage for crystallographic studies of 4-OT, YwhB, and VPH using these inhibitors as ligands.\n\nCharacterization of two homeodomain transcription factors with critical but distinct roles in virulence in the vascular pathogen Verticillium dahliae.\n\nPubMed\n\nSarmiento-Villamil, Jorge L; Prieto, Pilar; Klosterman, Steven J; GarcÃ­a-Pedrajas, MarÃ­a D\n\n2018-04-01\n\nVascular wilt caused by Verticillium dahliae is a destructive disease that represents a chronic economic problem for crop production worldwide. In this work, we characterized two new regulators of pathogenicity in this species. Vph1 (VDAG_06555) was identified in a candidate gene approach as a putative homologue of the transcription factor Ste12. Vhb1 (VDAG_08786), identified in a forward genetics approach, is similar to the homeobox transcription factor Htf1, reported as a regulator of conidiogenesis in several fungi. Deletion of vph1 did not affect vegetative growth, whereas deletion of vhb1 greatly reduced sporulation rates in liquid medium. Both mutants failed to induce Verticillium wilt symptoms. However, unlike Îvph1, Îvhb1 could be re-isolated from the vascular system of some asymptomatic plants. Confocal microscopy further indicated that Îvph1 and Îvhb1 differed in their behaviour inÂ planta; Îvph1 could not penetrate the root cortex, whereas Îvhb1 was impaired in its ability to colonize the xylem. In agreement with these observations, only Îvhb1 could penetrate cellophane paper. On cellophane, wild-type and Îvhb1 strains produced numerous short branches with swollen tips, resembling the hyphopodia formed on root surfaces, contrasting with Îvph1, which generated unbranched long filaments without swollen tips. A microarray analysis showed that these differences in growth were associated with differences in global transcription patterns, and allowed us to identify a large set of novel genes potentially involved in virulence in V.Â dahliae. Ste12 homologues are known regulators of invasive growth, but Vhb1 is the first putative Htf1 homologue identified with a critical role in virulence.

For ohmically heated plasmas, with higher collisionalities, vph in the laboratory frame is in the direction of the electron diamagnetic velocity, but plasma rotation is reversed as well, and vph, in the Er = 0 frame, is in the ion diamagnetic velocity direction. Theoretically, two classes of reconnecting modes should emerge: drift-tearing modes and ``inductive modes'' that depend on the effects of a finite plasma inductivity. The former modes, with vph in the direction of the electron diamagnetic velocity, require the pre-excitation of a different kind of mode in order to become unstable in weakly collisional regimes. The second kind of modes has a growth rate associated with the relevant finite ion viscosity. A comprehensive theory is presented.

The nuclear emulsion was irradiated at the National Cancer Center (NCC) with a therapeutic proton beam and was installed at 5.2 m distance from the beam nozzle structure with various thicknesses of water-equivalent material (PMMA) blocks to position with specific positions along the Bragg curve. After the beam exposure and development of the emulsion films, the films were scanned by S-UTS developed in Nagoya University. The proton tracks in the scanned films were reconstructed using the 'NETSCAN' method. Through this procedure, the VPH can be derived from each reconstructed proton track at each position along the Bragg curve. The VPH value indicates the magnitude of energy loss in proton track. By comparison with the simulation results obtained using Geant4, we found the correlation between the LET calculated by Monte Carlo simulation and the VPH measured by the nuclear emulsion.\n\nCharacterization of suppressible mutations in the viomycin phosphotransferase gene of the Streptomyces enteric plasmid pVE138.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nParadiso, M J; Roberts, G; Streicher, S L; Goldberg, R B\n\n1987-01-01\n\nThe viomycin phosphotransferase gene (vph) is expressed and confers resistance to viomycin in both Streptomyces spp. and members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. We report the isolation of UGA (opal) and UAG (amber) mutations in the vph gene of shuttle plasmid pVE138. We found that the five UGA mutations in vph resulted in a temperature-sensitive phenotype in Salmonella typhimurium. Su- strains are Vior at 28 degrees C and Vios at 37 degrees C, whereas Su+UGA strains are Vior at both 28 and 37 degrees C. The single amber mutation isolated was not temperature sensitive and resulted in the expected Vios phenotype in Su- strains and Vior in Su+UAG strains.

In 5-10% of the cases, variants of the Ph (vPh) are detected, involving various breakpoints in addition to 9q34 and 22q11.2. Deletions on the der(9) and der(22) can be detected in approximately 10-15% of CML patients. The frequency of a deletion of the der(9) in vPh CML is variable. Most studies have shown high frequencies (30-45%) in this subgroup. We report the cytogenetic evaluation of 25 vPh cases, which represents 6.8% of the CML cases diagnosed at one institution in 20 years. The breakpoints of the partners of the vPh in our patients agree with those reported previously, except for a novel 18q23. We found a low incidence of deletions of the der(9) (10%) and der(22) (5%) in these patients, contrasting with several reports in the literature. This finding may reflect the extensive spectrum of aberrations in vPh, and the possibility that a considerable group of these aberrations may not affect the genetic stability of 5'ABL1 and 3'BCR. Epidemiologic differences may also exist and could explain our results. These differences would require further investigation. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The virus is also associated with genital warts and other less common cancers in oropharynx, vulva, vagina and penis. Worldwide, VPH genotypes 16 and 18 are the most common high risk genotypes, detected in near 70% of women with cervical cancer. The discovery of a cause-effect relationship between several carcinogenic microorganisms and cancer open avenues for new diagnostic, treatment and prevention strategies. In this issue of Revista MÃ©dica de Chile, two papers on HPV are presented. Guzman and colleagues demonstrate that HPV can be detected in 66% to 77% of healthy male adolescents bypolymerase chain reaction and that positivity depends on the site of the penis that is sampled. These results support the role of male to female transmission of high risk HPVs in Chile and should lead to even more active educational campaigns. The second paper provides recommendations for HPV vaccine use in Chile, generated by the Immunization Advisory Committee of the Chilean Infectious Disease Society. To issue these recommendations, the Committee analyzes the epidemiological information available on HPV infection and cervical cancer in Chile, vaccine safety and effectiveness data, and describes cost-effectiveness studies. Taking into account that universal vaccination is controversial, the Committee favors vaccine use in Chile and it's incorporation into a national program. However, there is an indication that the country requires the implementation of an integrated surveillance approach including cross matching of data obtained from HPV genotype surveillance, monitoring of vaccination coverage, and surveillance of cervical cancer. The final decision of universal vaccine use in Chile should be based on a through analysis of information.ev Mid Chile\n\nThe Frequency Versus Length Response for a Deformed SLIFER Cable.\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1980-02-01\n\nlux- 0 Vph where o M the frequency of the oscillator when the length of the shorted cable is zero (it depends only on the internal inductance of the...form of Eq.

Measurements of Te < 100 eV are achieved by a 2971 l/mm VPH grating and measurements Te > 100 eV by a 2072 l/mm VPH grating. The spectrometer uses a fast-gated (Ë2 ns) ICCD camera for detection.

The first stage produces a new intermediate crystal (orthorhombic HTiOF(3) ) that is transformed into anatase TiO(2) nanosheets during the second stage. The findings reveal that the HF-VPH reaction environment is unique and differs remarkably from that of liquid-phase hydrothermal processes. The uniqueness of the HF-VPH conditions can be readily used to effectively control the nanostructure growth. Copyright Â© 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

F.; O'Neil, T. M.; Valentini, F.\n\n2012-10-01\n\nElectron Acoustic Waves (EAWs) are the low-frequency branch of near-linear Langmuir (plasma) waves: the frequency is such that the complex dielectric function (Dr, Di) has Dr= 0; and ``flattening'' of f(v) near the wave phase velocity vph gives Di=0 and eliminates Landau damping. Here, we observe standing axisymmetric EAWs in a pure ion column.footnotetextF. Anderegg, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 095001 (2009). At low excitation amplitudes, the EAWs have vphË1.4 v, in close agreement with near-linear theory. At moderate excitation strengths, EAW waves are observed over a range of frequencies, with 1.3 v < vph< 2.1 v. Here, the final wave frequency may differ from the excitation frequency since the excitation modifies f (v); and recent theory analyzes frequency shifts from ``corners'' of a plateau at vph.footnotetextF.

Experiences with vaccination against vaccine-preventable hepatitis (VPH) among men who have sex with men (MSM) may offer key insights to inform future HIV vaccination strategies. The purpose of this analysis was to explore what is known currently about vaccination among MSM, using knowledge gained from vaccination against VPH, and to identify important considerations from these experiences that must be explored further as a vaccine against HIV is promoted among MSM. Because cultural and political differences make it difficult to extrapolate findings from studies in one country to another, we have focused our analyses on studies conducted in the USA. Through a qualitative systematic review of published reports, we identified eight studies that reported correlates of VPH among MSM in the USA. Six major domains of variables associated with vaccination against VPH were identified, including: demographics (e.g. younger age, higher educational attainment); increased vaccine knowledge; increased access to health care; provider recommendation; behaviours (e.g. same-sex behaviour, health-promoting and disease-preventing behaviours); and psychosocial factors (e.g. openness about one's sexual orientation, reduced barriers to being vaccinated, self-efficacy). Further research is needed to understand vaccination behaviour among MSM and to maximise acceptance and uptake after a vaccine exists. Experiences with VPH provide a real-world model on which to base preliminary assumptions about acceptance and uptake of a vaccine against HIV.\n\nShock Capturing with PDE-Based Artificial Viscosity for an Adaptive, Higher-Order Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Method\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2008-06-01\n\nGeometry Interpolation The function space , VpH , consists of discontinuous, piecewise-polynomials.

The\n\nPrevalence of Specific Types of Human Papiloma Virus in Cervical Intraepithelial Lesions and Cervical Cancer in Macedonian Women\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAleksioska-Papestiev, Irena; Chibisheva, Vesna; Micevska, Megi; Dimitrov, Goran\n\n2018-01-01\n\nIntroduction Cervical cancer is a malignancy originating in the transformation zone of the cervix, most commonly in the squamous cells. It is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide, and the third most common cause of female cancer death. Genital human papilloma viruses (HPV) are sexually transmitted and approximately 630 milion people worldwide are infected. More than 200 genotypes, subtypes and variants have been reported, 13-15 being oncogenic type, which could be responsible for cervical intraepithelial lesions (CIN) or cancer. Aim Aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of this infection and to identify specific types of human papiloma virus in cervical intraepithelial lesions and cervical cancer in Macedonian women. Material and methods The study was conducted at the University Clinic for Obstetrics and Gynecology, Skopje, Macedonia, in a period of four years. The study was performed on a cohort of 1895, 18 - 73 year old patients who during primary examination had already abnormal PAP smear test. Cervical cells were collected in the lithotomy gynecological position of the patient, using endocervical cytobrush and cotton-tipped swab, and both were placed in sterile test tube with phosphate buffered saline. Samples were stored at temperature of 2 - 8 Â°C and Human Pappiloma Virus (HPV) genotyping was analyzed within 7 days by multiple Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) methods. Results The mean age of enrolled women was 40,8 yearsÂ±10.36 SD(minimum of 18 and maximum 73 years. Among the patients, the presence of HPV by using PCR was detected in 40,68 % (769 patients) and was highly associated with cervical abnormalities. The prevalence of HPV was highest (82,1%) in women aged 20-years or less and it decreased with age and was lowest (19,9%) among patients older than 50 years. The prevalence of oncogenic types of the virus was higher if the cytologic diagnosis is CIN 3/Carcinoma in situ (CIS). In these patients detection of high risk HPV was in 79\n\nVeterinary public health capacity-building in India: a grim reflection of the developing world's underpreparedness to address zoonotic risks.\n\nPubMed\n\nKakkar, Manish; Abbas, Syed Shahid; Kumar, Ashok; Hussain, Mohammad Akhtar; Sharma, Kavya; Bhatt, Purvi Mehta; Zodpey, Sanjay\n\n2013-01-01\n\nVeterinary public health (VPH) is ideally suited to promote convergence between human, animal and environmental sectors. Recent zoonotic and emerging infectious disease events have given rise to increasing calls for efforts to build global VPH capacities. However, even with their greater vulnerability to such events, including their economic and livelihood impacts, the response from low-and middle-income countries such as India has been suboptimal, thereby elevating global health risks. Addressing risks effectively at the human-animal interface in these countries will require a clear vision, consistent policies, strategic approach and sustained political commitment to reform and refine the current VPH capacity-building efforts. Only then can the discipline serve its goal of disease prevention, poverty alleviation and support for sustainable livelihoods through improvements in human and animal health.\n\n[The molecular-cytogenetic characterization and tyrosine kinase inhibitors efficacy in newly diagnosed chronic phase CML patients with variant Philadelphia chromosomes].\n\nPubMed\n\nZhao, J J; Zhang, Y L; Zhang, S J; Zhou, J; Yu, F K; Zu, Y L; Zhao, H F; Li, Z; Song, Y P\n\n2018-03-14\n\nObjective: To investigate the molecular-cytogenetic characterization and impact on tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) therapy in chronic phase of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML-CP) patients with variant Ph chromosome (vPh).
