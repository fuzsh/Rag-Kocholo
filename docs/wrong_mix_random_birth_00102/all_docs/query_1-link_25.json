        "text": "`My latest publication, an article titled \"Pragmatism paves the way? A scholar`s adventurous exist from Nazi Germany.\" I write about how Heinrich Zimmer, the brilliant and avant garde professor of Indian Studies at the University of Heidelberg managed to escape from Nazi Germany, where his professorial title and teaching license were rescinded because his wife was considered to be \"of Jewish origin.\" The article is published in the annual journal, Jahrbuch für Universitätsgeschichte. The theme of this issue, is Universities and politics. The issue is a French-German special number.\n\n“We were all blind. All the conditions for national socialism were laid out...” A year before he passed away, the great labour lawyer, Otto Kahn-Freund, was interviewed by constitutional scholar Wolfgang Luthardt. His life as a young man came at one of the most extraordinary, and terrifying periods of German and world history. This interview was published in German in 1981, but until this translation it has been unfamiliar to English audiences. Kahn-Freund had instrumental influence in the architecture of German, British, and European labour law. As a Berlin Labour Court judge, Kahn-Freund represented the courage of millions of Germans like him who resisted Nazi usurpation of the state. Even after Hitler, backed by a cartel of bankers and industrialists, seized the Chancellorship, Kahn-Freund’s last major case awarded maximum damages to radio employees who were dismissed on trumped-up accusations of being communist saboteurs. As European law continues to take shape, and questions press on how to fashion justice in a globalising world, the personal history of a man who cared so deeply about human freedom enlightens us today."
