        "text": "Above and Beyond Flight\n\nWe're more than aviation experts. We're pioneers who have challenged what's possible for sound barriers, lunar missions, tiltrotor systems and commercial helicopters. We’ve been reimagining the experience of flight for more than 80 years—and today we're redefining where it can take us. Headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas – as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Textron Inc., – we have strategic locations around the globe. Our talented employees come from over 90 countries to serve customers from 120. All to deliver exceptional aircraft experiences. Efficiently. Reliably. And, above all, safely."
