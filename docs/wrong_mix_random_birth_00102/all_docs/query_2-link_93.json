        "text": "“I worked at Seattle’s Best Coffee right out of high school. I was able to meet so many people, and I fell in love with coffee at the same time. I didn’t realize how coffee could bridge gaps and create relationships until I was older. It was very intriguing, and I knew I wanted to work in coffee.\n\nI began speaking about it more and more, and I knew that a coffee shop was needed on the east side of Fort Worth because there aren’t any. An amazing door opened to begin working on a coffee shop for the east side. Black Coffee is now open near Texas Wesleyan University. We plan on being here for our community for a very long time.”"
