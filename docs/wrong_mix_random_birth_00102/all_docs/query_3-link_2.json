It has been scope to cover all towns in Germany (re which are of any industrial significance, and it has been possible to expand the number of industrial establishments listed in each town. Information relating to the activities of particular factories has been revised in the light of the latest available intelligence.\n\n2.As in the previous edition, enterprises have been grouped under fourteen industrial headings as follows:-\n\n1.Transportation\n\n2.Public Utility Services\n\n3.Solid Fuels\n\n4.Liquid Riels & Substitutes%\n\n5.Iron, Steel, & Ferro-Alloys\n\n6.Non-Ferrous Metal Smelting, Refining,\n\nA Manufacture\n\n7.Aircraft & Aero-engines\n\n8.Shipbuilding\n\n9.Othei' Engineering and Armament Industries\n\n10.Chemicals & Explosives\n\n11.Textiles, Rayon, Pulp & Paper\n\n12.Rubber & Tyres\n\n13.Leather\n\n14.Food industries\n\n3.The descriptions of activities and the figures in the column entitled \"Priority\" are intended only as a general guide to the size and relative importance of the individual undertakings. The basis on which the \"Priority\" ratings have been allotted is as follows:-\n\n1+Factories ofoutstanding importance\n\nin the German war effort.\n\n1Major plantsin major industries\n\n2Minor plantsin major industries\n\n$\n\nor\n\nMajor plantsin minor industries\n\n3Factories ofrelatively small\n\nimportance in the German war effort.\n\nFactories which are almost certainly of little importance in the German war effort and establishments concerning which the available information is not sufficient to enable any priority rating to be allotted.\n\nSome of the works included without priority are new establishments the activities of which are uncertain; some of them would doubtless rank for inclusion in one of the four priority groups if full information were available.\n\nIn allotting priorities account has been taken of the damage inflicted in area attack only in cases where the productivity of the factory concerned appears to have been permanently affected. In other cases factories are assessed on the basis that they have been fully repaired and are fully active. Owing to the speed with which repairs are put in nand in Borne cases, it did not seem practicable to give weight to damage which may prove to be temporary in assessing priorities which are intended for long-term reference.\n\nThe priority rating of a factory in the Bomber's Baedeker consequently does not neoessarily reflect its current importance and should not be used for the purpose of appreciations without reference to its current damage status. If the demand from users justifies it, however, periodical statements can be issued to show the current status of damaged factories as well as other amendments.\n\n4.Owing to its increased size it eras been necessary to bind the new edition in two parts, of which the first includes,\n\nin alphabetical order, the towns AACHEN to KÜSTRIN; and the second the towns LAHR to ZVICKAU.\n\nEach part is accompanied by maps showing: -\n\na)All towns covered by the 1944 edition of the Bomber's BaedeKer.\n\nb)The method of division of the industriell area of the Ruhr into fourteen districts.\n\nAn index is in course of preparation.\n\n5.\n\nAACHEN (Rhineland)\n\n50° 47' N. 6° 5' E: 275 miles: (164,000)\n\nAachen is an important railway junction on one of the main routes from North -West Germany into Belgium and Prance . It is the centre of\n\na large coal -mining area * and many of the companies exploiting these\n\nmines have their administrative offices in the town . In peace - time\n\ntextiles formed the main industry in Aachen proper . There are a large number of spinning and weaving mills , many of which were closed early\n\nin the war. The leading firms of Aachen 's engineering and rubber\n\nindustry are mentioned below . The town has been heavily damaged by bombing , and the production of several of these firms reduced , but much of the industrial damage , particularly to the main factories , has been repaired . The industries are mainly grouped in the North East corner\n\nof the town along the JtLLicherstrasse , and in the Rothe Brde district,\n\neast of the town centre . Several of the textile mills in the Jdlicher- strasse , which have been closed down, are now said to be used as\n\ndummies .

The administrative boundaries have been extended by the inclusion of surrounding districts to give a total area of 345 square miles.\n\nThe chief industrial areas lie firstly, to the North-west, including Spandau, Siemenstadt, Wedding, Tegel, and Reinickendorf, and secondly, to the South and South-east including Marienfelde, Tempelhof, and Johannistal, There are other well-established industrial areas, such as Lichtenberg and SchBneberg, which are respectively in the eastern and southern quarters of the city.\n\nFurther industrial extension is taking place in various outlying portions of the administrative area.\n\nThe course of the river Spree, which is navigable, runs approximately from South-east to North-west through the centre of the city.\n\nAt Spandau it joins the Havel, which flows from North to South along the western border of Berlin. The Teltow canal, which leaves the Spree near Treptow and runs through the Southern outskirts of Greater Berlin, Joins the Havel near Potsdam and forms a link to relieve the water-borne traffic through the centre of the city.\n\nGreat use has been made of the waterways around Berlin in order to connect the capital with the Elbe and the Oder. Large inland harbours have been constructed. The most important of which is the Westhafen, where 70 large ships can be loaded simultaneously. The Westhafen is connected with the Spree and with the Havel, which it ''Joins at Spandau. From the Havel (North-west of Berlin) ship\n\ncanals have been built giving direct access in the East to the Oder, and in the West to the Elbe. By this means navigable waterways connect Berlin directly with Stettin and the Baltic, and with Hamburg.\n\nThe main railway artery between Western and North-eastern Europe runs through Berlin. There are three large railway stations (';on this East to West line. In addition main lines radiate from five\n\nother terminal railway stations to all parts of Germany. The local and suburban traffic is served by the electric Stadt- und Ringbahn, the extensive network of which extends over the whole area. This is supplemented by the large system of the Hoch- und Untergrundbahn, which runs partly underground and partly a3 an elevated railway, and ' by the tramway and bus services.\n\nAll the leading firms have administrative offices in Berlin.\n\nThese are largely concentrated in the central city area between Alexanderplatz and the Eastern end of Unter den Linden, and also in the neighbourhood of the Potsdamnerplatz.\n\nRunning South frcm the Western end of Unter den Linden is the Wilhelmstrasse, in which are situated the Chancellery, the War Office, the Air Ministry and other Government departments.\n\nThe principal shopping centres of Be:lin, which contain several large department stores, are Leipzigerstrasse, Alexanderplatz, and Tauentzienstrasse, in Charlottenburg.\n\nIndustries\n\nThe firmly established and significant position held by the industries of Berlin within the German productive machine is primarily due to their scope and diversity, both of which have been further developed during the war.\n\nThe electro-technical industry (including radio) still maintains its important and leading position and is represented by large firms of world-wide repute such as the A.E. G., Siemens & Halske A.G,,\n\nSiemens Sehuckert A. G., and Teiefunken Ges. fur Drahtlose Telegraphie nub.H, Osram G.nub.H., and others.\n\nThe general engineering industry is also of substantial importance, as is shown by the well-known firms engaged in it, such as Rheinmetall Borsig A.G., Ambi-Budd Presswerke G.nub.H., Deutsche Industriewerke A.G., Berliner Maschinenbau A. G. (vomals L.Schwartzkopff), and Daimler-Benz A.G.; it is, in fact, Berlin's second-largest branch of industry' The aircraft industry is represented by B. It. '.'/.,\n\nDomier, Heinkel.and Focke-Wulf, and general engineering by numerous makers of precision tool and of precision and optical instruments.\n\nBerlin's chemical, clothing, and food industries, are also of more than local importance.\n\nIndustrial Areas\n\nThe chief industrial areas are located outside the Ringbahn, along the water and railway routes. These routes are arranged in three main belts:- the river Spree and the canals associated with it; the railway wliieh encircles the outskirts of the compact built-up area, i. e., the Ringbahn; and an outer ring of communications which consist of the Havel and 'fcgel See to the West, the Teltow canal from Potsdam to Köpenick to the South, and the Industrie Bahn to the North from Tegel to Lichtenberg.\n\nAn important fen ‘v re of the three outstanding industrial areas is that the'- _ onxy small residential areas in their immediate vicinity. In order of importance these are:-\n\n(1)Spandau. C nrlottenburg, and Sicne.nstadt.\n\nThis \\ve3t-central part of Berlin i3 of the highest importance.\n\nHere there are very big blocks of factory buildings and also a special port. Among others, the electrical equipnent and cable •.works of Siemens & Halske A.G., Siemens Sehuckert A.G., A.E. G. Turbinenfabrik, the Ges. fur Elektrische Unternehmungen L.Loewe A. G. , Osran G.n.b.H,, and the 3. 'A W. are located there. The second and third largest of the BEWAG power stations are also in this area.\n\n(2)Treptow and Sonor' ev.rtde.\n\nThe manufacture of electrical equipment of all kinds is predominant within this are , and, although the A.E.C. lias its largest individual plant at Brunnenstiasse, Wadding, the three most important electrical equipment and cable works of the company are to be found here. The most important of Berlin's non-ferrous metal plants and the main works of the important Accumulatorcn Fabrik A.G. (A. F. A. )\n\naxe located in the Sch&neweide district. There are other engineering works, motor vehicle and metal works. The largest of the 3EWAG power stations is at Rummelshurg, near the Treptow area,\n\n(3) Tegel, Wittenau, and Reinickendorf.\n\nImportant engineering and armamer.t-production plants are to be found here. The most prominent of these are the Doit tier and. the Heinkel aiix:raft-components factories, the Argus aero-engine factory, Maschinenfabrik Prometheus G.n.b. H., and the Deutsche Waffen- und Munitions- Fabriken A.G,\n\nTo the North there are many snail and scattered factories, the chief of which are at Lichteriberg, where Siemens Planiawerke and a number of other engineering works are located. To the South, at Mariendorf, Tempelhof and Britz, the chief factories lie on the South side of the Tempelhof airfield. Industries are also to be found on the Eastern outskirts of Neukölln.\n\nThe suburban areas, most of which lie far outside Berlin, have been developed mainly during the last twenty years. As a rule they are largely residential, but in sane cases industrial development has taken place. The greatest extensions have been made along the railways to the North-west towards Hennigsdorf and Oranienburg; to the North-cast to Bern&u: to the East beyond Mahlsdorf: to the South-east beyond Köpenick to Wildau; to the South to Lichtenrade: and to the South-west around the South of the liavel See to Potsdam.\n\na) West HarbourWest Harbour(1)\n\n4+b) East HarbourEast Harbour(1)\n\nc) Spandau-South HarbourSpandau-South\n\nCRHarbour(3)\n\nTransportation\n\nthe\n\nBerlin is second only to Duisburg as an inland port. It has accomodation for vessels up to £31,000 tons and is connected by canal with most\n\n,parts of Germany. The most important of the\n\nnine large transhipment hartiours of Berlin are the East and West Harbours. The latter is the largest and most modern and consists of three basins with a granary, customs sheds,\n\n, and ten warehouses. The East Harbour is a\n\ndevelopment of the river bank with warehouses, granary, cold-storage plant, etc., (see also under \"Foodstuffs\").\n\nMarshalling YardTempelhof\n\n(1)\n\nPassenger Stations Goods Yards\n\nTempelhof marshalling yard and the main Potsdamer and Anhalter passenger stations and their respective goods depots, carriage repair workshops, and loco depots, extend South from the inner city to Tempelhof suburb. The Anhalter station is East of the Potsdamer station, and is the terminus for services operating to Dresden, Halle, Leipzig, Frankfurt a/M, Bavaria,\n\nPotsdamer station is the terminal point for main line service to Köln and the Rhineland via Magdeburg and Wuppertal,\n\nTempelhof goods depot with its adjacent railway facilities is located on the South side of the circular railway known as the \"Ringbahn\" and is one of a number of such goods depots serving the inner city.\n\nTempeihof marshalling yard has a throughout capacity of 3,000 wagons p>er 24 hours; during the inter-war period it was working at 85JL of capacity, but under war conditions it is probably working to full capacity and may be regarded as one of the vital rail targets of the Berlin area.\n\nThe main routes on which the target lies are:-to Dresden, Prague and Vienna to the South: to Leipzig, Halle, Mannheim to the South-west: and to Magdeburg, and Northern France (via Köln) to the West-South-West.\n\nRailway Repair Shops\n\nTempelhof\n\nThe main locomotive depot, and large railway workshops were reported to employ some 5>000 pieople during the inter-war period. As a^ locomotive centre the workshops were reported to possess a large capacity and to be equipped for the handling of paassenger, freight and switching engines. Facilities for coach and wagon repair are said to be of medium capacity only. Approximately two-thirds of workshops area have been gutted as results of air attacks.\n\nGrünewald\n\nMarshalling Yard and Railway Repair Shops\n\nThis target includes the Westkreuz junction as well as a switching and rectifier station (junction of Stadtbahn end Ringbahn) and the electricity distribution station for these railways.

G.\n\nMEWMärkisches ElektrizitätswerkA.G.\n\nESA.Elektrizitätswerk SädwestA. G.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe city is supplied from external sources chiefly by the EWAG and the MEW systems. The BKL BE..AG) controls all the main power stations in the city. The total capacity of the generating stations is 1,250 MW.\n\nExternal Supply\n\nThere are two main outside systems of supply to the city. The first, the EWAG system, supplies current from Golpa-Zschornewitz and Trattendorf. These lines enter Berlin at Spandau and at Rummelsburg and thence are linked up to the BKL BEiYAG) system. Two lines come from Trattendorf; one skirts the northern suburbs and enters at Spandau, the other connects with BKL BEWAG) system at Friedrichsfelde.\n\nThe other i3 the MEW system, which encircles Berlin and introduces current from the power stations at Finkenheerd, Finow, and Hennigsdorf.\n\nBerliner Kraft- und Licht (BEiYAG)- A.G.\n\n\"Deutsche Edison\" was founded in 1883 and in the following year was granted a concession to supply electrical current to part of the city of Berlin. This concession was transferred to the Städtische Elektrizitätswerke on its formation. Later, this company became the Berliner Elektrizitätswerke (BE.V), and the concession was extended to cover the whole of the city of Berlin.\n\nIn 1915 the city itself took over the direction of the firm under the name Städtische Elektrizitätswerke Berlin (STEW), but this was again altered in 1923 to Berliner Städtische Elektrizitätswerke Akt. Ges. (BEWAG).\n\nIn 1931 the Berliner Kraft- und Licht-Aktiengesellschaft (BKL) was formed to administer the electrical, installations owned directly by the city and those owned by BEiYAG. The BEWAG capital was transferred to the new company and two other Berlin companies - Elektrowerke A.G. (SWAG) and Preussische Elektrizitäts Aktiengesellschaft-also became shareholders of the new company.\n\nFinally, in 1934, BEiYAG and BKL were completely amalgamated to form the present Berliner Kraft- und Licht (BEWAG) - A.G.\n\nIn 1938, BKL BEiYAG) - the new company - acquired the firm of Elektrizitätswerk Sädwest A.G. (ESA) and so widened it3 territorial interests to Schflneberg, Wilmersdorf and\n\nPublic Utilities (Electricity)\n\nSchmargendorf. In the same year, as a result of an agreement made in 1928. it acquired from Märkisches Elektrizitätswerk A.G. (MEW) territorial interests in Dahlem, Lankwitz, Lichtenrade, Mariendorf, Südende, and Tempelhof. Thus 3KL (3EWAG) acquired the interests in the whole of the city as far as the small outlying districts of Wannsee and Buch. The company claims that this is the largest system of electrical manufacture and distribution in any one city in the world.\n\nBKL BEWAG power stationKlingenberg(1+)\n\nThis is the largest of the thermal power stations owned by the Berliner Kraft- und Licht (BEWAG) -A.G. , which supply electricity to the Berlin area. Built in 1926/28, it operates on base load and has an installed capacity of 270 MY. but is designed for an ultimate capacity of 540 MV. It i3 situated on the North bank of the river Spree in the South-east of the city on a site of 50 acres; the main control room for the BKL BEWAG) system is in the nine-storied office block which also houses large water tanks on its top floor.\n\nProm a 50 kV switch house at least 48 three-phase 30 kV underground cables are operated in pairs and are connected to different substations in the Berlin area. There is also a 30 kV connection to the adjacent 81 MV. Rummelsburg station.\n\nBKL BEWA& power stationBerlin-West(1+)\n\nThis station is the second largest of the BKL BEWAG) system and has an installed capacity of 228 MV. Built in 1929/1932, it i3 situated on the North bank of the river Spree in the western area of the city near the Siemens works at Siemenstadt. It was originally operated mainly to supply part of the Berlin day load, the night load being supplied by the Klingenberg station and by long-distance transmission from the large brown-coal-fired stations at Golpa-Zschomewitz, Trattendorf, Lauta, Pinkenheerd, and elsewhere. The small Unterspree power station is situated 300 yards to the South-west, on the bank of the Spree. The main supply at 30 kV from the station is through underground cables to the Berlin city network via the 30 kV switch house. Supplies are also given direct to the nearby Siemens works. In addition to auxiliary supplies 3ome small local supplies are probably given at 6.3 kV via the 6.3 kV switch house.\n\nBKL BEWAG power station .Charlottenburg(1)\n\nThis thermal power station, owned by BKL BEWAG), has an installed capacity of 109 MW. Built in 1900, it was completely reconstructed in 1925 in two sections, of which one, with a capacity of 59 MW. , operates on base load, while the other plant, which has a capacity of 50 MW. , meets the peak load. It is situated in the western area of the city, on the North bank of the\n\nBKL HEY/AG) power stationCharlottenburg\n\n(contd.)\n\nriver Spree. There is a 30 kV substation containing twelve G/30 kV transformers of a total capacity of 116 MW. and ore 30/3 kV inter-bus transformer of 8 M11. capacity. Local supplies are connected by underground cables to Spandau,\n\nKnie, the Sianens works, Moabit, and to the nearby 100 kV. substation. The 100 kV substation connected the Berlin 30 kV underground cable systan with the 100 kV transmission system. One 100 kV line goes to Spandau, 6 miles to the Northwest, and one to Moabit, from there continuing to Friedrichsfelde substation (9 miles East of Charlottenburg). The electrical output is supplied to Berlin. Steam is also supplied at 281 lbs/sq.in. for a district-heating system.\n\nBKL BEWAG power stationRunaelsburg\n\nThis station is situated in Surmelsburg, a suburb in the South-east of Berlin, on the North bank of the river Spree within £ mile of the Klingenberg station and has an installed capacity of 81 MW.\n\nA 100/30 kVA substation close to the generating plant transforms 100 kV supplies from the EWAG grid to 50 kV for local distribution. One 100 kV double-circuit line goes to the Friedrichsfelde substation, 4 miles to the North, and one to Golpa-Zschornewitz.The substation serves for\n\nlocal distribution at 30 kV rather than for supplying electricity externally.\n\nA 6/30 kV substation connects the 100/30 kV substation to the generating station, and contains at least two 6/30 kV transformers each of 18 MW, capacity; it connects the generating station to the 30 kV grid of the Berlin area and with the 100/30 kV substation it also serves for local distribution at 6 kV.\n\nBKL BEY/AG power stationKoabit\n\nThis is one of the oldest stations of the BKL 3EWAG) system supplying the Berlin area and has an installed capacity of 81 MW. It is operated for peak load and standby purposes. It is situated in the North-west central district on the Schiffahrt3-Kanal and consists of 2 parts; these are composed of a large number of reconditioned old units or replacements, which made identification of plant difficult.\n\nA substation for 100/30 kV steps down the supplies received through the 100 kV grid for distribution over the Berlin 30 kV grid. The substation is partly open air and partly in the old engine house; it contains at least 5 transformers each of 16 MW.\n\nLong distance 100 kV lines pass to Spandau, 7 miles distant, and to the Friedrichsfelde substation, 8 miles East of Moabit. A 6/30 kV substation gives supplies to the Berlin 30 kV grid. Local distribution is also at 6 kV.\n\nBKL BEWAG power station'Wilmersdorf\n\nThis station on the BKL BEWAG system is situated at Wilmersdorf, a South-western suburb of Berlin close to the Rudolsthdterstrasse, and has an installed capacity of 62 MW. This station was built by ESA in about 1905 and supplies the South-western area of Berlin. It is believed that the Wilmersdorf station is now used by BIX (SEWAG) for standby purposes only. An A. C./D. C. converter plant is attached to the station. The city of Berlin is supplied at 6.6. kV and at lower voltages, and supplies are also given to the underground railways.\n\nIt is possible that this station has been connected by BKL BSWAG) to the 50 kV Berlin grid and that a 30/g kV substation has been added to serve as a local distribution centre.\n\nBKL BEWAG) power stationSpandau\n\nThis station on the BKL 3EWAG) system is situated on the Havel See near Spandau, a North-west suburb of Berlin and has an installed capacity of 56 MW.\n\nThe generating plant is used for standby and peak load only.\n\nOne double ciruit line goes to Trattendorf, one to Brandenburg (there connecting to Golpa-Zschomewitz and Diesdorf), and one to Charlobtenburg. There is a 100 kV connection to Henningsdorf (5 miles to the North).\n\nLocal supplies are given at 6 kV, and to the Berlin grid at 30 kV.\n\nThis station contains one of the main substations in Berlin. It has at least two 100/30 kV transformers, each of 16 !.IW. capacity and transforms the supplies received from Wie 100 kV grid to 30 kV for local distribution.\n\nIt is the terminus of the 220 kV line which was partially constructed before the war and is now probably completed; starting at Bra uw eil er, the line reaches Spandau via Koepehenwerk, Bielefeld, Lehrte, Harbke, Diesdorf (Magdeburg), and Brandenburg; a distance of 385 miles by this route.\n\nE'.VAG switch stationFriedrichsfelde\n\nThis important switch station is owned by E'WAG and is situated on the east side, of the city. Two 100 kV lines from Golpa-Zschomewitz and Trattendorf power stations pass to Berlin. It is also connected to the Moabit and Rummelsburg transforming stations. The elimination of this station would seriously affect the city's external supplies and it i3, therefore, an important target.\n\nPublic Utilities (Electricity)\n\n3KL BEWAG power stationUnterspree\n\nThis station on the EKL BEWAG system is situated on the South bank of the river Spree opposite to the Berlin-V.'est station, and has an installed capacity of 36 MW. It supplies the underground railway system.\n\nBKL BEWAG power stationSchßneberg\n\nThis station, built by ESA, is now on the EKL (BEWAG) system and is situated in the Schßneberg district, to the South of the city and 2 mile East of the Yfilmersdorf station. It is a reserve plant and has an installed capacity of 20 MW.\n\nBKL BEWAG power stationOberschBnenweide\n\nThis station had a capacity of 36 MW. It was closed down in 1933 and converte1 to a 30/6 kV transformer station.\n\nII GAS SUPPLY General\n\nUp to 1939 gas supply in 3erlin was undertaken by two companies, the Berliner Städtische Gaswerke A. G. , with works at\n\nCharlottenburg Danziger Str.\n\nLichtenberg\n\nNeukBlln\n\nTegel\n\nleased to the company by the Municipality, and the Gasbetriebsgesellschaft A.G, , a subsidiary of the Deutsche Gasgesellschaft A.G. , with works at\n\nGitschinerstr.\n\nSchftneberg\n\nMariendorf\n\nIn 1936 the Berliner Städtische Gaswerke sold 390,600,000 cu.ro, of gas and the Gasbetriebsgeselischaft 133 million cu.m.\n\nIn 1939 the Berliner Städtische Gaswerke (Gasag) took over from the Deutsche Gasgesellschaft the operation of its three Berlin works, and thus unified ga3 supply in the city. In Greater Berlin there still remained, however, two independent municipal gas-distributing concerns, those at Niederbamim and Teltow, Of these the former obtains gas from the GASAG, and the latter from the Potsdam works of the Deutsche Continental-Gas ^-Gesellschaft.\n\nMunicipal GasworksCharlottenburg\n\nThe gasworks is leased by the Municipality to the Berliner Städtische Gaswerke A.G. and is situated just East of Jungfernheide Station.
