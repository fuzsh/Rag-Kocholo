Categories : Criminal Justice , From the Executive Director Print this page by Hector Villagra August 1 , 2011 A few days after the end of the Pelican Bay hunger strike , I was interviewed on KCRW ’s “ Which Way , LA ? ” in the same segment as spokespeople from California Prison Health Services and the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation . The CDCR , through Undersecretary of Operations Scott Kernan , tried to defend its reckless and indiscriminate use of solitary confinement ; it succeeded only in giving an exhibition in government speak . “ Which Way , LA ? ” host Warren Olney asked Kernan if Pelican Bay prisoners in solitary confinement do in fact “ spend at least 22 and a half hours every day in windowless , concrete cells , the remaining time alone in concrete exercise yards . ” Parsing Kernan ’s answer should have yielded , at some point , either a yes or no . Kernan started by stating that “ solitary confinement is a word that ’s used ... loosely ... ” But instead of explaining how he thought the word has been misapplied to Pelican Bay , he just reverted to the talking point that the guys in “ the hole ” are the so-called worst of the worst . “ [ t ] hese inmates again are the most dangerous gang leaders that we have in the state of California and , let the truth be told , in the nation . So these guys are really truly the most dangerous offenders . So we have definitely -- Pelican Bay was built to house the worst of the worst . And it is meant to control their movements considerably ... . So let ’s just be very , very clear that these are bad guys , and so we keep them very controlled . But it is not solitary confinement , nor is it torturous behavior as described by some . Ok , so these guys are the most dangerous , the worst of the worst . But are they in fact kept in windowless , concrete cells for 22 and a half hours a day ? A couple minutes later , when Kernan suggested that there was no overcrowding at Pelican Bay because the inmates are housed in single cells , Olney pressed the question one more time : “ Well , are those single cells , in fact , windowless concrete cells , and are they required to stay there 22 and a half hours a day ? ” Kernan responded : “ Um , well , they have programming , I do n’t know if I would say 22 hours , 22 and a half hours a day , but , probably very close to that . ” This is a sizeable number of words to say , in effect , “ yes . ” What could be the point of Kernan ’s filibustering other than to avoid the real questions : Does it benefit public safety to house inmates in a concrete box ? How do people react to extreme isolation ? Is it inhumane to isolate a person in a windowless concrete cell for 22.5 hours a day for months , years , or even decades ? Mr. Kernan elected to end his interview rather than attempt to answer . Hector Villagra is the Executive Director of the ACLU / SC . Full transcript of Mr. Kernan ’s radio interview : [START_ENT] Warren Olney [END_ENT] : “ Scott Kernan is Undersecretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation , welcome back to our program . I understand that you helped to resolve some of these issues . Which of those that I listed were in fact dealt with , and did the state make some concessions ? ” Scott Kernan : “ I do n’t know that I would say concessions ; you know , the inmates had a list of demands , we took a look at them , and I think that at the end of the day we realized that as you just described a watch cap in inclement weather and a wall calendar did n’t pose significant security concerns and so those changes were made . We ’re also looking at a number of things including the very complicated gang validation process . I ’d also just point out to you that the inmates at Pelican Bay that started this are there because of their behavior . These are the gang leaders that are running the various prison gangs and as such are the scourge of society in our prisons . A lot of violence associated with it . So anyway we did evaluate it and we did make some changes to our policy and we ’re going to look at the other changes that the inmates desire moving forward . ” KCRW : “ What about at the other prisons ? ” Scott Kernan : “ Well really it was , again , generated by inmates at Pelican Bay . So the central issues were related to them and it really is a illustration of the power that these guys represent over other offenders . For at the height of it , six thousand , sixty-five hundred or so , at 13 prisons , although that dissipated very quickly , and really the core hunger strikers were probably under a hundred at Pelican Bay . ” KCRW : “ It ’s been reported that at Pelican Bay many prisoners are in solitary confinement , and then when they are they spend at least 22 and a half hours every day in windowless , concrete cells , the remaining time alone in concrete exercise yards , are those things true ? ” Scott Kernan : “ The solitary confinement is a word that ’s used , I guess , loosely , a little bit . These inmates again are the most dangerous gang leaders that we have in the state of California and , let the truth be told , in the nation . These guys are running the Mexican mafia , the Nuestra Familia , the Black Guerilla family , the Aryan Brotherhood . ” So these guys are really truly the most dangerous offenders . So we have definitely -- Pelican Bay was built to house the worst of the worst . And it is meant to control their movements considerably . I mean these inmates are not there at Pelican Bay for just not obeying simple rules . They ’re in there for murdering inmates , and for you know following through with their criminal enterprises on the street . So let ’s just be very , very clear that these are bad guys , and so we keep them very controlled . But it is not solitary confinement , nor is it torturous behavior as described by some . ” KCRW : “ There ’s a panel of federal judges that have said the conditions within the prisons violate the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment . Did they single out the kind of treatment that I described ? ” Scott Kernan : “ No , not at all . The court decision that you described is overall overcrowding in the system , and the fact that Pelican Bay inmates are largely single cell because they ’re so dangerous . They ’re one of the few areas that we have very reduced overcrowding , while the courts ruled that overall the Department ’s population is overcrowded leading to those constitutional violations ; it had nothing to do with the SHU specifically at Pelican Bay or any of the other SHUs that we have in the state . ” KCRW : “ Well are those single cells , in fact , windowless concrete cells and are they required to stay there 22 and a half hours a day ? ” Scott Kernan : “ Um , well , they have programming , I do n’t know if I would say 22 hours , 22 and a half hours a day , but , probably very close to that . They get an hour a day of yard and showers and if they have to go to they can have visits and go to medical appointments and the like but it is , it is stark correctional environment for our most dangerous offenders . ” KCRW : “ Most dangerous as they are , there are those who say that conditions of that kind can produce panic attacks , depression , inability to concentrate , memory loss , aggression , self-mutilation , and various forms of psychosis . Is that true ? And even if they are worst of the worst , is it appropriate to have those kinds of consequences ? ” Scott Kernan : “ Interesting question . The federal courts have been in the Department of corrections and rehabilitations mental health process for a long time and none of the inmates that are involved in this hunger strike at SHU , we do n’t allow mental health inmates to be there . So any inmate that had any kind of mental health concern would not be housed in the SHU at Pelican Bay . ” KCRW : “ Ok , so how long do you think it will take to resolve these other issues with what , you do n’t want to call solitary confinement , and also with the question of gang validation which they complain as though I understand it that it takes so long that they ’re then accused of being snitches when they get back into the general population or anywhere near it . I suppose if they ’re confined to single cells they ’re not really in the general population . What about those issues ? Will that take you longer to resolve ? ” Scott Kernan : “ It ’s a little bit more complicated than that . What they ’re referring to is about the debriefing process is that when an inmate wants to get out of SHU and wants to disassociate himself with the gangs he can do so and he has to go through a debriefing process . And in that debriefing process he must identify criminal behavior that he ’s been involved in , and others . The SHU inmates are taking umbrage with that suggestion , that that ’s not appropriate . We completely disagree and if you talk to the inmates that have went [ sic ] through the debriefing process and got out of the gang life , they will tell you that the debriefing process , we get it right a hundred percent of the time . So you know while we ’re going to look at all these issues , we definitely think that there could be some changes to the validation and debriefing process but we ’re going to do that with the input of not only the stakeholders of the inmate side but the stakeholders of the law enforcement and the gang investigators that work so hard every day to protect our streets and our prisons . ” KCRW : “ Okay , well thanks for being on our program . ” Scott Kernan : “ Thank you . ” KCRW : “ Scott Kernan , Undersecretary of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation , elected not to talk with any of our other guests . ” Did you like this ?

Neighboring West Virginia communities are already seeing benefits from development of the Hatfield and McCoy Trail System , which attracts thousands of tourists and generates millions in revenue each year . This photo was taken during the 2011 Trailfest in Gilbert , W.Va . PIKEVILLE -- Counties throughout eastern Kentucky plan to boost the economy by developing and promoting adventure tourism activities . Big Sandy Area Development Director Sandy Runyon , who has worked with local leaders to establish trail systems in eastern [START_ENT] Kentucky [END_ENT] for a number of years , reports that officials in Breathitt , Clay , Knott , Leslie , Bell , Letcher , Perry , Owsley and Harlan counties have worked together for quite some time to develop a trail system that would attract ATV riders , horse enthusiasts , hikers and others into eastern Kentucky . Runyon explained that those counties have entered into an interlocal agreement regarding the trail system , with the understanding that each county is responsible for trail development and maintenance in their counties . Officials in these counties also agree that counties would assist each other with maintenance or other issues on neighboring properties , with the understanding that counties wo n't be billed for that service and with goal of eventually connecting all trails together in one large system . The Pike County Fiscal Court is the first of several Big Sandy area counties to become a part of the initiative by passing a resolution to join the multi-county effort during a Nov. 1 meeting . Although Pike county officials talked about developing a trail system to mimic the successful Hatfield-McCoy ATV Trail system in West Virginia , Runyon believes the interlocal agreement , once it is finalized , will encompass all types of trails and trail-based activities . The first step is for Fiscal Courts in those counties to pass a resolution stating the county 's intent on participating . Thereafter , county attorneys will hash out a finalized interlocal agreement that suits the needs of all counties . The Big Sandy ADD is currently preparing resolutions for other Big Sandy counties . “ I 'm not sure how many counties will sign on , ” Runyon said . “ But we know that Pike , Floyd , Magoffin and Martin counties are interested and we expect that Johnson County will also be interested . Our goal is to have any kind of agreement they enter into to include all trails . ” Once the interlocal agreement between the counties is finalized , Runyon said it is likely that individual counties will be responsible for obtaining land-use permits from residents , which could be a “ huge endeavor ” in counties like Pike County , where officials have identified 200 property owners along one potential trail route . Runyon said the biggest issue in connecting eastern Kentucky trails is the liability that property owners face when they allow the public to come onto their property . There has been some effort at the state level to pass legislation to ease the property liability burden , but the state 's tort law , allowing people to sue for various reasons , may prevent further success of that effort . One bill passed the House last year , but it died without a vote in the Senate . Runyon said the laws enacted by the legislature show progress . “ I do think there is a way around all of this if everybody can work together , and they truly do work together , and try to add all the needs of everybody involved , ” she said . “ I think we can make some progress . ” Areas like Harlan , Bell , Knott Leslie and Knott counties found ways around the liability issues and are able to market trails and host large-scale trail events because a large corporate landowner or private landowners with large , usable tracks of property provided a long-term lease to the county . “ Bell County is the new kid on the block , ” Runyon said . “ There was a company there that leased 7,600 acres to the county . They held an ATV event there three weeks ago that attracted 3,000 riders . So , it 's possible to do this . ” Runyon said the local residents contacted by the Big Sandy ADD have reported that they are excited about the potential . “ The only resistance we see is the unknown , ” she said . “ If every county develops a block of property and show the locals that it will work , that people will come in here to ride these trails and there is economic benefit to that , then I think local landowners will want to get involved . ” She is asking all counties to assess properties that might be available for trail development . The multi-county coalition will make the region more eligible to receive multi-county coal severance tax funds and grant funding for trail development projects , Runyon explained . “ We truly believe here that tourism will be an economic development engine , ” Runyon said . “ It wo n't be the only engine , but it will be a major economic tool for this region . ” Share and Enjoy : Author : admin Categories : Community News , Uncategorized Tags : Comments are closed .

Following last season 's exploits that led the Seagulls to the Npower League One title , Gus Poyet 's side go into the Championship full of renewed hope and optimism for what lies ahead.One player not looking to dwell on the niceties that come with the opening of a new home is Gary Dicker , who says the players must adapt quickly to their new surroundings in order to continue pushing in the right direction . \" It 's a big pitch , \" the 25-year-old confirmed . \" We have to get used to playing here when it is full . We need to punish teams when we have the ball . If we can make this place hard to play in for other teams , it will be a massive thing for us . \" I 've played at Wembley before , but this pitch feels bigger - it is beautiful to play on . \" Brighton could be regarded as having an outside chance for back-to-back promotions , but if one thing is certain it 's that Poyet has got the Seagull 's back playing football the right way . The headline summer signing of Craig Mackail-Smith will undoubtedly add extra firepower to their ranks , but a realistic target of consolidation and a top half finish will ensure the feel-good factor remains at Brighton for another season at least . Scotland international Mackail-Smith , however , will miss the club ’s Carling Cup tie with Gillingham next week because of his latest call-up to the national squad -- much to the annoyance of manager Gus Poyet . The [START_ENT] Brighton [END_ENT] boss said : “ We will always respect players who want to play for their countries so we wo n't stop him from going . Saying that , it 's not very clever when you put an international game in the middle of a week when you have a cup game . \" This is Scotland , not Australia or Argentina . I think they knew from two months ago that it was a Carling Cup week and there are a few Scottish players in England . \" I am not going to fight the Scottish FA over it . I am going to give him the freedom to go . I loved playing for Uruguay . I will never stop a player playing for their national team . \" I am very pleased for Craig and I would , of course , like him to play . It would be very disappointing if he goes to Scotland , misses the Gillingham game and does n't play , so it 's up to the manager . \" Championship Winners - 18/1Promoted - 6/1 Fancy a flutter on the big game ?

( Mark Almond | Associated Press | File ) By JOHN ZENORAssociated Press Published : Monday , February 13 , 2012 at 6:01 a.m. . Last Modified : Monday , February 13 , 2012 at 11:27 p.m. MONTGOMERY -- Alabama ’s suspension-riddled team expects to get some reinforcements for Tuesday ’s game against No. 14 Florida , but leading scorers JaMychal Green and Tony Mitchell wo n’t be among them . Crimson Tide coach Anthony Grant said Monday that guards Trevor Releford and Andrew Steele will “ most likely ” return for a game that could supply a huge boost for the NCAA tournament hopes of a team once flirting with the top 10 -- or a second-straight setback minus key players . “ The main thing right now for our guys to understand is the importance of making good decisions and understanding the consequences when you make poor decisions and then moving on from that and learning from that , ” Grant said . “ So we ’re dealing with that . It ’s disappointing and unfortunate that we have to deal with this in the middle of the season . “ It is what it is , so right now as a team we have to focus on the things we can control , and we have a very challenging game here against a very talented opponent in Florida . We have to get ready to play the game . ” Grant suspended Green , Releford and Steele indefinitely just before Saturday ’s loss at LSU for violating team rules , sending them packing for Tuscaloosa before tipoff.That was also the second game of Mitchell ’s suspension.The disciplinary actions left the Tide ( 16-8 , 5-5 Southeastern Conference ) without players responsible for 69 percent of its scoring , 57 percent of rebounding and 54 percent of assists at a time when the stakes are ratcheted up . Green and [START_ENT] Mitchell [END_ENT] are the team ’s top scorers and rebounders , while Releford leads Alabama in assists and Steele is a key role player . Grant said his decision to hold the players out had much to do with the long-term quality of the program and trying to build “ the values and standards that you want your team to represent . ” He has n’t elaborated on the reasons for the suspensions . Grant declined to say if the violations of Mitchell and Green were more serious , but reiterated that their suspension remained indefinite . “ I do n’t want to get into that , that ’s just the way it is right now , ” he said.This is the third time Grant has suspended Green , a first-team All - SEC player , during his three seasons , including a three-game string early last season and one game at the end of 2009-10 . Grant did n’t rule it out when asked if he had a “ three-strike ” policy that might keep Green from returning . “ I ’ll make some decisions on that later , ” he said . “ Right now my focus is on getting prepared for Florida . ” Alabama had risen to No. 12 in the rankings in December and won three straight before the LSU game.The bold decision on the suspensions was no surprise to Gators coach Billy Donovan , who was Grant ’s boss for a dozen years at Marshall and Florida . “ I know Anthony Grant about as well as anybody , and I think that he has got incredible integrity and character and knows exactly the way he wants his program run and what he ’s going to do , ” Donovan said.The Tide ’s eight remaining players -- half of them freshmen -- managed to come fairly close before losing 67-58 to LSU , with freshman Rodney Cooper scoring 28 points . Alabama had beaten Auburn by 18 points without Mitchell . Now comes a much bigger challenge , even with Releford and Steele.The Gators ( 19-6 , 7-3 ) opened last March with a 78-51 rout of a Tide team that still had aspirations of winning an SEC title and making the NCAA field . Florida is also short-handed , but because of injuries . The Gators wo n’t have their top subs , forward Will Yeguete ( concussion ) and guard Mike Rosario ( bruised hip ) , for the game , Donovan\n\nOutput\n\nAntwort\n\nTony Mitchell (basketball, born 1989)\n\nProvenance\n\nWikipedia-Artikel: Tony Mitchell (basketball, born 1989)\n\nEingabe\n\nConnection : close Server : Nginx / Varnish Last-Modified : Wed , 11 May 2011 16:39:26 GMT ETag : \" 20bf53c-15e6-4a302b7435d69 \" Accept-Ranges : bytes Content-Length : 5606 Vary : Accept-Encoding Wide Open - Childrens Alligator T-Shirt - Fashion Wide Open - Childrens Alligator T-Shirt Fashion - T-Shirts This children 's t-shirt is titled Wide Open and has a great big alligator sitting there , mouth open - amazing teeth !

SEC Media Days : SB Nation Roundup Regarding Mark Richt , AJ Green , and the Georgia Bulldogs by T Kyle King on Jul 22 , 2010 12:01 PM EDT in Football Tweet 3 comments Email Print Mark Richt ’s turn at the microphone at SEC Media Days featured no questions concerning agents , though it is open to debate whether this was due to \" a voluntary hiatus , \" an \" order \" ( with consequences for disobedience ) , or \" a request on Georgia ’s behalf to hold off on all questions regarding the [START_ENT] NCAA [END_ENT] ’s investigation into AJ Green ’s alleged presence at the agent-sponsored South Beach Party currently erasing half the games played in the 2009 college football season . \" ( In the meantime , Dawg Sports has confirmed with a relative of AJ Green ’s that the star receiver was attending a family function in the Palmetto State at the time . ) The summary of Coach Richt ’s remarks authored by Spencer Hall ( whose presence at the event I believe to be confirmed by this photograph , unless I miss my guess as to the identity of the bespectacled plaid-clad fellow with sideburns at the center ) is linked to above , and C&F ; ’s live blog of the event is here . Coach Richt ’s job security came up , though I have no idea why . For his part , AJ did n’t know how big this was . Now , if you ’ll excuse me , I ’m about to go wolf down a Chick-fil-A spicy chicken sandwich , of the sort the hardworking reporters present in the greater metropolitan Birmingham area cruelly were denied yesterday .

Gilden , '63 On the Heels of MS Donald H. Gilden , ’ 63 , knew the moment he touched the dying man ’s cold hand he wanted to become a doctor . He was just five years old when he made his decision . His grandfather had taken him to visit a friend who was dying of congestive heart failure and was surviving in an oxygen tent . Young Gilden was under strict orders not to disturb the man , but he disobeyed his grandfather slipping his hand under the tent . The old man squeezed the boy ’s fingers and told him stories about his grandfather . “ After that day I never stopped talking about it , ” says Gilden , professor and chairman of the department of neurology and professor of microbiology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine . “ I was going to be a doctor when I grew up . I never wanted to do anything else . ” Gilden , age 70 , has indeed made his mark on the profession . He is recognized as a pioneer in the field of neurovirology for groundbreaking work relating to shingles and multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . After nearly 150 years of medical speculation , Gilden discovered that varicella zoster virus -- the virus that causes shingles -- is latent in human ganglia . More than a million people a year suffer from shingles , and his work helped lead to a shingles vaccination . He has also been working to track down the virus he believes causes MS , a disease that affects about a quarter of a million people in the United States . But this has been far more challenging . Yet Gilden is focused on what he wants to accomplish and understands that it will perhaps take the rest of his life , or even longer , to reach answers . “ You have to be patient , ” he says . “ Science goes little by little . Progress is little by little . ” For his work , Gilden has received an alumni award for distinguished service from the University of Chicago School of Medicine , the International Society for NeuroVirology Pioneer Award , and , in May , he will receive the Medical Alumni Association ’s Honor Award and Gold Key , presented for outstanding medical accomplishments and distinguished service to mankind . A neurologist by training , Gilden sees patients who suffer from migraines , multiple sclerosis , Alzheimer ’s , stroke , and Parkinson ’s . “ I will see anyone , ” he says . “ Clinical neurology has always been one of my first loves . ” But most of his time is spent in the lab conducting research in the microscopic world of DNA , RNA , viruses , and proteins . “ Sometimes in the lab my head is spinning because we have big things going on , ” Gilden says . As a boy growing up in Baltimore , Gilden ’s world revolved around school and working summers in the family business , Sam Gilden & Son , a wholesale store that supplied hair tonic , razor blades , bobby pins , toothpaste , and other items to local drug stores . He unloaded trucks , packed orders , swept floors , and , when he was old enough , made deliveries in a bright red Dodge delivery truck His father saw him taking over the business one day , a task which demanded hard work and long hours . “ We never had dinner with my father , ” Gilden recalls . “ The wholesale business was a tough business . ” Gilden ’s real “ job ” was to go to school , and he excelled in biology , chemistry , and math . Classes in foreign language , however , barely held his interest . “ For me the language of medicine was all I ever cared about , ” he says . He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1959 , and moved back home to go to medical school . Gilden interned at the University of Illinois Hospital in Chicago , and did his residency in neurology at the University of Chicago Hospitals . It was in the late 1960s while he was a staff neurologist in the [START_ENT] US Army [END_ENT] at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington , DC , that he became interested in research . After seeing patients during the day , he had time to catch his breath in the evening and mull over the amazing research underway . Researchers had discovered that measles virus in the brain could cause chronic encephalitis , and that Jakob-Creutzfeld disease -- a “ degenerative ” brain disorder in humans -- was infectious . “ I said to my wife , ‘ I think I want to do a fellowship in infectious diseases , ’” recalls Gilden , who was 32 at the time . “ She looked at me like she married a crazy man . ” He was accepted at the Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health as a postdoctoral National Institutes of Health fellow . After about three years , he joined the faculty at University of Pennsylvania and set up a lab at the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia to find the virus that causes MS . He worked closely with MS patients who lived in a chronic care facility and were ravaged by the disease . Gilden asked if they would donate their brains after death to his research because he was looking for the cause of MS . Sometimes his phone rang in the middle of the night and within an hour Gilden was harvesting brain from their skulls . “ I had my own saw , ” he says . He studied 24 brains over eight years , but never found the MS virus . So , he turned his attention to varicella zoster virus , which causes chickenpox in children and shingles in adults . Nobody had ever isolated the virus , and if he could prove it was there he believed he could use the same technique to find the MS virus . He tore into his work mapping the viral genome in human ganglia along the entire nervous system . In 1983 , he proved for the first time that the virus was latent in ganglia and “ reawakens ” causing shingles . The shingles virus causes pain and even stroke if it makes its way to the brain . Gilden found several other diseases caused by the virus , such as zoster sine herpete , or shingles without the rash . His discoveries led to more work for his team . Gilden left the University of Pennsylvania in 1985 to become professor and chairman of the department of neurology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and professor of microbiology . At the University of Colorado , 15 members of Gilden ’s team are working on varicella zoster virus and MS . They harvest ganglia collected from an autopsy room . “ We go there every day , ” Gilden says . “ If it is a good case we will go as far as we have to . We even get specimens from Japan . ” MS has been a hard case to crack , but Gilden seems to be making progress . The common theory is that MS is autoimmune . The body ’s immune response attacks a protein that is normally in the brain . The attack is so violent and persistent that the brain is destroyed in the process . “ We do n’t think that is the case at all , ” Gilden says . “ Even now we have evidence that it is not autoimmune . ” He argues that in people with MS who have increased amounts of an antibody called immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) , in their brain and spinal fluid , the IgG is directed against an infectious agent , but nobody is quite sure at what agent it is directed . He and his team are looking for footprints of virus in MS . “ We are writing a paper showing that the immune response in MS is not against a self ( auto ) protein , ” he says . While he is busy with his research , Gilden , who is married and has three adult sons , skis and plays the violin -- a 1779 Guadagnini . He is also quick to tell a joke . Gilden would like to find out what causes MS and how to prevent varicella zoster virus from reactivating . He is unfazed by the fact that his research into MS\n\nOutput\n\nAntwort\n\nUnited States Army\n\nProvenance\n\nWikipedia-Artikel: United States Army\n\nEingabe\n\nFiber Optic Equipment , Fiber Optic Equipment Manufacturers , Fiber Optic Equipment Suppliers and Exporters Sign In | Join Free | Community | Inquiry Basket ( ) | Help Buy Now Sell Now Services My EC21 Products Selling Leads Buying Leads Companies Access Global Buyer DB Products Selling Leads Buying Leads Companies Fiber Optic Equipment - Telecommunications -- All Categories ------------------------------- AgricultureApparelAutomobiles & MotorcyclesBusiness ServicesChemicalsComputer Hardware & SoftwareConstruction & Real EstateConsumer ElectronicsElectrical Equipment & SuppliesElectronic Components & SuppliesEnergyEnvironmentExcess InventoryFashion AccessoriesFood & BeverageFurniture & FurnishingsGeneral Industrial EquipmentGeneral Mechanical ComponentsGifts & CraftsHardwareHealth & MedicalHome & GardenHome AppliancesLights & LightingLuggage , Bags & CasesManufacturing & Processing MachineryMeasurement & Analysis InstrumentsMinerals & MetallurgyOffice & School SuppliesPackaging & PaperPersonal CarePrinting & PublishingRubber & PlasticsSecurity & ProtectionService EquipmentShoes & AccessoriesSports & EntertainmentTelecommunicationsTextiles & Leather ProductsTimepieces , Jewelry , EyewearToolsToysTransportation View New Products Post Your Buying Leads Advanced Search Related Searches : fiber optic , patch cord , fiber , fiber optic patch cord , media converter , sfp , fusion splicer , optical transceiver , otdr More ...

Neighboring West Virginia communities are already seeing benefits from development of the Hatfield and McCoy Trail System , which attracts thousands of tourists and generates millions in revenue each year . This photo was taken during the 2011 Trailfest in Gilbert , W.Va . PIKEVILLE -- Counties throughout eastern Kentucky plan to boost the economy by developing and promoting adventure tourism activities . Big Sandy Area Development Director Sandy Runyon , who has worked with local leaders to establish trail systems in eastern Kentucky for a number of years , reports that officials in Breathitt , Clay , Knott , Leslie , Bell , Letcher , Perry , Owsley and Harlan counties have worked together for quite some time to develop a trail system that would attract ATV riders , horse enthusiasts , hikers and others into eastern Kentucky . Runyon explained that those counties have entered into an interlocal agreement regarding the trail system , with the understanding that each county is responsible for trail development and maintenance in their counties . Officials in these counties also agree that counties would assist each other with maintenance or other issues on neighboring properties , with the understanding that counties wo n't be billed for that service and with goal of eventually connecting all trails together in one large system . The Pike County Fiscal Court is the first of several Big Sandy area counties to become a part of the initiative by passing a resolution to join the multi-county effort during a Nov. 1 meeting . Although Pike county officials talked about developing a trail system to mimic the successful Hatfield-McCoy ATV Trail system in West Virginia , Runyon believes the interlocal agreement , once it is finalized , will encompass all types of trails and trail-based activities . The first step is for Fiscal Courts in those counties to pass a resolution stating the county 's intent on participating . Thereafter , county attorneys will hash out a finalized interlocal agreement that suits the needs of all counties . The Big Sandy ADD is currently preparing resolutions for other [START_ENT] Big Sandy [END_ENT] counties . “ I 'm not sure how many counties will sign on , ” Runyon said . “ But we know that Pike , Floyd , Magoffin and Martin counties are interested and we expect that Johnson County will also be interested . Our goal is to have any kind of agreement they enter into to include all trails . ” Once the interlocal agreement between the counties is finalized , Runyon said it is likely that individual counties will be responsible for obtaining land-use permits from residents , which could be a “ huge endeavor ” in counties like Pike County , where officials have identified 200 property owners along one potential trail route . Runyon said the biggest issue in connecting eastern Kentucky trails is the liability that property owners face when they allow the public to come onto their property . There has been some effort at the state level to pass legislation to ease the property liability burden , but the state 's tort law , allowing people to sue for various reasons , may prevent further success of that effort . One bill passed the House last year , but it died without a vote in the Senate . Runyon said the laws enacted by the legislature show progress . “ I do think there is a way around all of this if everybody can work together , and they truly do work together , and try to add all the needs of everybody involved , ” she said . “ I think we can make some progress . ” Areas like Harlan , Bell , Knott Leslie and Knott counties found ways around the liability issues and are able to market trails and host large-scale trail events because a large corporate landowner or private landowners with large , usable tracks of property provided a long-term lease to the county . “ Bell County is the new kid on the block , ” Runyon said . “ There was a company there that leased 7,600 acres to the county . They held an ATV event there three weeks ago that attracted 3,000 riders . So , it 's possible to do this . ” Runyon said the local residents contacted by the Big Sandy ADD have reported that they are excited about the potential . “ The only resistance we see is the unknown , ” she said . “ If every county develops a block of property and show the locals that it will work , that people will come in here to ride these trails and there is economic benefit to that , then I think local landowners will want to get involved . ” She is asking all counties to assess properties that might be available for trail development . The multi-county coalition will make the region more eligible to receive multi-county coal severance tax funds and grant funding for trail development projects , Runyon explained . “ We truly believe here that tourism will be an economic development engine , ” Runyon said . “ It wo n't be the only engine , but it will be a major economic tool for this region . ” Share and Enjoy : Author : admin Categories : Community News , Uncategorized Tags : Comments are closed .

Do n't get stuck , get a grip . If you bury your head in the sand , then circumstances will force you to make long overdue changes . Better by far to stay ahead of the game , and volunteer for the inevitable . That way you have a better chance of staying in control of events and directing your future path . Solar eclipses happen every six months , in different cycles which recur every 18.5 years ( the Saros Cycle ) . The sign and cycle in which the eclipse occurs will tell you which area of your activities is shouting for a shakeup . In the rundown below read your Sun sign and your Ascendant sign . [ If you do n't know your ascendant , go to www.star4cast.com FREE Birth Charts and it will calculate it for you . ] Take time to work out what happened to you personally 18.5 years ago , or 37 . The two major domestic/country moves in my life took place exactly that distance apart in the years of eclipses in the same cycle . And I only worked that one out after the decision was taken . This approaching December solar eclipse in Sagittarius will obviously have more effect on Sagittarian Sun or Ascendant types , who are at a real turning point in their lives . Geminis are looking closely at relationships . The other mutable signs , Virgo and Pisces are focusing on home and work matters . Taurus and Scorpio are money-minded ; Capricorn and Cancer have work and health dilemmas ; Leo and Aquarius are trying to balance love and friendships ; Aries and Libra are grappling with nitty gritty communication and organisational matters . More details below . This eclipse cycle wo n't recur until 2020 , so this is your chance to take the initiative , ask yourself fundamental questions about what you really want to do with this area of your life , and then make the radical decisions necessary . The few days before and after an eclipse are usually fraught , highly strung , rather nervy , with few ( except astrology followers ) understanding why everyone is so on edge . The eclipse effect carries a major theme for the following six months and will be felt for a few weeks in advance , so there 's no sense in delaying until December 4th . Get your thinking cap on . In primitive days , the ancients ' view of eclipses was that the darkening of the Sun was a portent of doom , putting them at the mercy of the fates . But these were highly superstitious people , with no sense of control of their lives . Eclipses can provoke crises , bringing unwanted upheavals , but nowadays you can chose your attitude and your strategy . Some world leaders have lives which seem eerily to follow eclipses : Nelson Mandela was imprisoned , released and became President on the exact week of eclipses . [START_ENT] Saddam Hussein [END_ENT] launched and then lost the Gulf War on an extraordinary series of eclipse driven events . He gathered his troops on the borders of Kuwait on the lunar eclipse in late July 1990 , two weeks before the solar eclipse on which date the UN mandate to oppose him was agreed . In the following January on the next Solar eclipse , the Gulf War was launched . Princess Diana died one day before a solar eclipse conjunct the potent , furiously angry Mars Pluto conjunction in Virgo in her chart.The previous eclipse in the same series 18.5 years before fell within days of the assassination of the Earl of Mountbatten , Prince Charles ' uncle . John F. Kennedy Jnr was killed in a plane crash days before the major 1999 solar eclipse , which was the same cycle as oversaw the death of his stillborn baby brother and indeed the assassination of his father , two cycles before . For those of us not caught up in world events , the effects are likely to be much less dramatic or tragic , but they are significant if you really want to grow and develop as a human being . This December Solar Eclipse is in a tricky Saros Cycle , usually accompanying a mood of high frustration , intense emotional reactions and a sense of being stuck with circumstances or relationship matters , seemingly beyond personal control . To add to the general feeling of angst , power-hungry Pluto is close to the eclipse , and the dreary Saturn opposition comes a few days later , though admittedly optimistic Jupiter in Leo is trying to add a dash of good luck as well from a trine . Bernadette Brady in The Eagle and the Lark remarks that rash action is inadvisable . GW Bush might do well to pay heed . For most of us these are tough times , with anchors dragging , and generally a sense that life is quite a struggle . Roll on the end of the Saturn Pluto opposition mid 2003 , and bring on the joyous eclipses of next year . So it 's grit your teeth and make the best of it for now . Here 's how : Sun and Ascendant Sign : SAGITTARIUS : An eclipse in your own sign says you are at a crossroads and must chose your path for the next few years . Decisions need to be pondered because there will be no backtracking . Make up your mind , get committed and then get moving . If you look the other way and ignore the eclipse effect , then a crisis in the next few months will force you to see where you have been over compromising . Be independent , do n't rely on others for advice , let alone be diverted onto your partner 's agenda . It ai n't easy , but you do have choices . GEMINI : Close emotional and work partnerships and your whole attitude to sharing , caring and relating are under the microscope . You must move into a more co-operative frame of mind , tolerant , flexible and willing to compromise . As an independent , restless air sign , none of this comes naturally . Old relationships may be under strain and on the point of parting company . Do they really suit your needs ? Only you know the answer . Strong bonds will weather the storms . New relationships will come as you clear the decks of psychological debris from the past . VIRGO : At an outer level , ensuring you have a solid , secure home and domestic base where you can put down roots is your cri de Coeur . At an inner level you are moving away from old ways of relating and refusing to be trapped by family members or loved ones who want you to stay exactly where and as you are . Pushed and pulled by opposing demands from heavy work responsibilities and emotional pressures , you need to put your own needs first . When your dilemma threatens to get on top of you , go dig the garden , walk in nature , or have a Californian massage . Getting in touch with earth energy will help . PISCES : Is a career crisis looming ? Maybe it 's a hint from the universe that you are heading in the wrong direction and trying to fit your talents into the wrong box . You know you want to make your mark on the world , and have your achievements recognised , but you have to be fulfilling what truly feels like a vocation for that to happen . With Pluto around , you will also be questioning your attitude to power figures and who holds the control . Maybe you ca n't be the megalomaniac you 'd like , but you need to ensure that no one else is pulling your strings at work either . Push family responsibilities into their proper place and focus on your ambitions . TAURUS : Two things are dear to your heart -- one is money and the other is power ( OK and sex is in there somewhere as well ) . Your sense of security may be shaken because circumstances seemingly outside your control seem to be posing a threat to your power and prosperity base . This solar eclipse falling in the deepest , most hidden area of your chart suggests you need to get right down to rock bottom to find fundamental answers to your present sticky situation . As a fixed sign you expect the world and other people to adapt to you , rather than the other way round . This eclipse says you need to share , care , co-operate and relate in a profoundly different way in future if you are to improve joint finances and spark up your sex life in the months to come -- and avoid a crisis . Hanging on for too much control , could backfire . Trust the universe and go with the flow . SCORPIO : Money is on your mind , not joint finances as with Taurus , but your own personal piggy-bank . In the face of ungenerous influences , you know you need to take a major initiative to shake up your finances to bring prosperity in the coming months . Luckily your formidable stamina will stand you in good stead , and Jupiter also helps at your mid-heaven , bringing a hint of career success . But you ca n't afford to dither around , praying for a lottery win or a long-lost relative to leave you a fortune . Get real , get thinking , and then get working . CAPRICORN : A hidden eclipse in the sign before yours sparks up psychological tensions , uncomfortable echoes of unresolved issues from the past and a general feeling of stuck-ness . If you can see the awkward events happening around you as useful pointers , reflections of what is going on at an inner level , then you can make real use of this eclipse . Not naturally an inward-looking sign , you may need to force yourself to ask the probing questions that will bring profound answers . Do n't be put off by imagining you will find all manner of horrors . On the contrary you will find you are a richer , stronger personality than you could have imagined . Your unlived emotions tend to put extra strain on your body , so be good to yourself physically by reaching for a deeper self-understanding . CANCER : Sagittarius is your area for work and health . You will be facing a dilemma about how to regenerate your career , improve your working conditions and build up your general health . The likelihood with Pluto in place is that you will be meeting resistance in your efforts , but do n't let that put you off . Pluto can produce solidly substantial results , but it usually takes a struggle and strong determination . Do n't meet unco-operative workmates head on in a stalemate battle . Duck and dive a little . Aim for influence , not outright control . Realise also you have to let go certain old ambitions which have lost their fire . Physically you need to pay better attention to your body 's needs , get even minor ailments fixed , and then you will sail ahead in robust form . LEO : Love may be on your mind , but it may not be what you are attracting . This eclipse will make you aware of where you are not getting the affection , admiration and adoration you want from loved ones , children or even social mates . Tricky , I know , to be exuberant and utterly seductive with the wet-blanket Saturn-Pluto around . But this is your challenge . You need to allow your personality to shine brightly , to step out without apology or doubt , to be where you feel fulfilled which is centre stage . Two thoughts : one is that what you lack , you must first give . Have you been too meagre in handing out kisses , cuddles and compliments ? Go to it . The second is that Pluto tends to make you clutch if you feel you are not getting attention . Let go . If you cage loved ones in , they will struggle to break free . AQUARIUS : Always known as the humanitarian sign , this could be your chance to make a real difference to the society or world in which you live . Certainly you know you need to widen your circle of friends and acquaintances in the months , if not years to come , but do n't keep stick to a frivolous , exclusively social agenda . You could join hands with influential movers and shakers to have a powerful influence on what is going on around you . You also know you need to nudge yourself into setting long term goals . Do n't just think five year plan , think 20 year plan . It does n't have to be set in concrete , you can adapt as you go along , but you will be better with a broad strategy and well defined goals . ARIES : Travel , communication , improving your mind -- all of these are sparked off by this eclipse , which is generally prompting you to broaden your horizons in whichever you can . Set your sights higher . Let your imagination soar . Think big , do n't get bogged down in trivia . Saturn Pluto is hardly an exciting or inspirational overlay , but nonetheless this is your challenge . You need to spread your ideas to a wider audience , find more intellectual stimulation and see where you can get yourself out of a rut . LIBRA : Sorting out your everyday schedule may not sound like a bundle of fun , but if you do n't get a grip of minutiae , details and organization , then your life will lack a solid , realistic base . Think about how you communicate . Are you being misunderstood at work ? Collect your thoughts first , speak simply and then double check to make sure your message got across . It may not be the content that 's at fault , more the delivery.Start each day with a checklist and you wo n't race round in circles getting in a muddle . Think small for a few months , then you will fly the higher come next May .

You rag on Unreal 's no show as far as a release goes , and less than 12 hours later , they put out a release . Any chance you could rag on id about Q3Test for the windows platform ? :-) - JamesF .

But it is kinda funny ai n't it . I nearly coughed up a lung when everyone started trying to download the Mac emulator . That is pure comedy . Nothing less . People should chill out about this mac first deal . How can any PC owner claim foul when the last game to come out on the Mac first was Marathon . And welcome to it they were . Did n't see the PC population crying over that . HackMesser I laughed my head off as well ... I own ARDI , and I found it very hard to believe that software that emulates a 25 MHz 68040 could actually run software designed for a G3 . It does , however run Marathon really well . :) Deep thoughts .

Andrew Smith strikes again ... From : Mr. Fix It Subject : Andrew Smith can suck my boomstick As you may have already guessed , this E-mail is a response to the pile of bull shit Andrew Smith sent in last week . Andrew Smith is a complete idiot !! Hey Andrew , if you have to put \" I have no evidence to prove this , but it 's true , and anyone who denies it is wrong . \" after everything you say , then what your saying is most likely false or an opinion . Keep your god damned misinformation to your dumbfuck self ! For the record : 1 . I play violent computer games , which I know for a _ FACT _ have not made me violent . 2 . I watch violent films , which I know for a _ FACT _ have not made me violent . 3 . I have access to information about making bombs , which I know for a _ FACT _ has not made me want to blow things up . I already wanted to blow things up before I had access to that crap . 4 . I am in high school where I have not killed any of my classmates because I play violent video games and watch violent movies . ( or for any other reason , for that mater . ) Some people may think that these _ FACTS _ make me biased . Perhaps I am , but that does n't make that Andrew Smith any smarter . People like him make me want to kill someone :-) . But seriously , they drive me insane ! Those irritating right-wing religious crackpots , moronic Republicans , and other idiots are always pushing shit like this at us . If you are a member of one of the aforementioned groups and you disagree with me , suck my boomstick !!!! I 'm sick and tired of flipping on the ol' boob toob and hearing video games , TV , and movies getting blamed for things like the tradgedy in Littleton . Jesus Christ people !!! I know this has been said before , but it was an excellent point : THE MEDIA IS NOT HERE TO BABYSIT THE YOUTH OF AMERICA !!!!!!!!! If you look at all of these absolutely horrible tradgedies , you will most likely see that the parents of killers either raised there kids in a terrible environment or they were hardly ever around . How the hell does a kid make multiple bombs without his parents noticing ? His parents not paying any attention to anything he does , that 's how !!! Parents are here to police their kids before they are able to police themselves . They sure make sure that their son or daughter understands that violence hurts and that what happens in most movies and video games is n't real . More and more of these tragedies will occur until the parents of America start doing their job : to raise there children up sane and with a healthy sense of reality . Man stuff like this pisses me off . Well , back to my homework ... - Mr. Fix It PS Feel free to edit the swearing in my letter . I really want my feelings on this heard . Thanks . From : Troy > < > Fisher Subject : Re : Andrew Smith : school shootings Your unsubstantiated comments provide a very good point . However , the substantiation that games do not cause violence comes from doing some homework on the following : How many copies of first-person shooters have been sold , starting with Wolf3D and going all the way up to Starseige or whatever is the latest . Now figure out how many of the owners of these copies went on to shoot kids in their school ( or elsewhere ) . I think you 'll find a large discrepancy if you can even come up with the numbers .
