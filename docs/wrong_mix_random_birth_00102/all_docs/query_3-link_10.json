Requirements were stiff. The frame must be an excellent insula tor. It must be free of internal stress that would cause warping or crack- ing. During assembly it must with- stand the blistering heat of dip soldering without losing its dimen- sions. Once assembled, it must not shrink or expand. The material finally selected for this job isa Durez phenolic. Mineral- filled, it has a low molding shrinkage of 0.003 in.fin. that minimizes stress and strain. Its water absorption is a low 0.2%. It stands temperature of 325°F under ASTM D648—easily survives the soldering operation. Its electrical properties, including are resistance, meet every requirement. This is only one more example of a host of jet-age assignments han- dled with the new Durez phenolics. You can do more—meet today’s needs better than ever before—with this wide-ranging family of materi- als. Thermal stability, electrical properties, impact strengths are up; costs are attractively low. To get an idea of the new latitude Durez phe- nolics give you, write for illustrated Bulletin D400 DUREZ p.iastics Division 1208 WALCK ROAD, NORTH TONAWANDA, N. Y.

If the plastics industry is to maintain or strengthen its market position, it might well re-evaluate its promotion budgets. GENERAL Three new cost cutters You can’t go by price-per-pound alone. That fact is well demonstrated by three recently intro- duced thermoplastics—Lexan, Delrin, Penton. All three are being used to replace metal and other design materials in numerous applications at im- pressive savings in cost. Here are several case studies spelling out the dollar-and-cent picture. Premix makes a better switch By going to a reinforced polyester molding com- pound, a manufacturer of speed _ responsive switches was able to develop a better product at a lower price. How savings were achieved is spelled out in detail. New champ of detergent bottles: high- density PE A major market breakthrough is taking place in the liquid detergent bottle field. The leading manufacturers are now specifying blow molded high-density PE for this application. Market potentials ranging up to 50 million lb. by 1960 and 120 million lb. by 1965 have been estimated. Why the switch from metal cans—in terms of economics and properties—and who’s involved in this de- velopment are some of the questions answered. New tool for builders: spray-on poly- _ An extension of the recently reported polyester- faced concrete blocks, this development permits the spray-on application of polyester resin to all types of masonry walls on the site. Advantages are: wide color choice, no need for special proc- essing equipment, and no problem of rejects. Crash caps for cops Low cost insurance against serious head injuries is provided by new type of helmet consisting of RP outer shell and expandable polystyrene liner. Details of production technique are outlined. Vinyl luggage trimmed faster for less 78 Adoption of double coated tapes to hold vinyl trim strips on a new line of luggage resulted in a 50% cost reduction, a doubling of production rates, and the elimination of clean-up problems. Formed portable altars When the Armed Services were looking for an improved design for their leatherette-covered wooden portable altars, they turned to ABS sheet. Results: weight reduced 5 lb., size cut by 33%, durability improved—all at no increase in cost. Payload upped 3840 pounds! Latest invasion of the transportation market by reinforced plastics is in the field of dry ice. One trailer company achieved an increase in legal payload of almost 4000 lb., while decreasing dry ice sublimation by over 700 lb. per load. Costs are roughly the same as for the wooden containers.

Literally, any plastic can be made flame resistant, chiefly by the use of halo- gen additives. But what happens to the othe properties of the thermoplastics when they are so treated? What happens to production rates? What happens to color? Our September lead will explore this situation. Some exciting new plastics sandwiches are being studied by the construction industry. They bring new dimen- sions to architecture and decor. A major feature in September will show one line of these ma- terials. The extruder becomes constantly more important as a plastics processing tool, and automation of the extruder is the next big step. An engineering section article for September will discuss improved instrumentation for the process. . Engineering section will also carry the final article in the series of four on how to overcome problems with premix molding.

Valves in sizes from 1/2\" to 4’’, shown in large photograph, are rated at 150 psi to 100 F. and at 50 psi to 130 F. They can be remote operated. B.F.Goodrich Chemical Company supplies the Geon rigid vinyl material only. New ball valve of Geon helps piping systems fight corrosion Thousands of test cycles with this new valve made from Geon rigid vinyl have proved the effectiveness of its seal, either at full pressure or vacuum. Since it is made entirely of Geon except for seats and seals, it offers pipe users another weapon for the battle against corrosion. Geon offers superior resistance to oils, acids, alkalies and most chemicals. In addition, rigid Geon weighs less than metal. Shipping weights are lower, installation is easier. These valves can be obtained with thread- ed ends, weld ends, or flanges. They are self-compensating for changes in B.EGoodrich AUGUST 1959 pressure or temperature. There is no problem of galling or seizure. No lubrication is needed. Geon offers remarkably varied op- portunities for products that open new markets or improve present applications. In rigid form it is being used for pipe, window frames and ductwork . . . in other forms for weatherstrip, wall coverings, foam products, or coatings for metal, paper or textiles.

J PLASTISOLS...for finer fusion of film to fabric Film-to-fabric lamination, with its more durable, lower-cost end product, is fast growing in popu- larity. The reasons: efficient equipment, such as that pictured above, plus the use of laminating adhesives based on PLiovic AO. The advantages of PLIOVIC AO as the resin in a laminating plastisol are: 1. Its low fusion tempera- ture protects against the loss of a film’s embossing, the distortion of a printed pattern or damage to a synthetic fabric. 2. Its copolymer composition and none ri ‘Alle? resin i I AUGUST 1959 low soap content provide excellent adhesion. 3. Its gelation and flow characteristics permit close con- trol of strike-through and make for easy processing. All this adds up to a higher quality laminate at lower cost. It also adds up to an excellent reason why you should learn more about PLiovic AO in laminating plastisols.

MODERN PLASTICS Once upon a time, in a bright shiny research labora- tory, there lived a bright young inventor. He could invent the best anything — everyone knew that. He should have been the happiest inventor in the whole world. But he wasn't. The problem was his newest machine, the double- reverse-widget, the biggest, best, lowest priced, most ... But,you have the idea. It should have been a best seller. But it wasn't. The double-reverse-widget lacked eye appeal. But re-designing was impossible, because everyone knows widgets have a very short selling season. So the inventor grew sadder .. . until Nosco’s “Can Do” man arrived and suggested plastic metallizing. Together they quickly sketched a low-cost name- plate with gold, silver and vivid colors proclaiming this widget to be the most.

But too often the data available to him are limited. To assist designers and plastics engineers, Dow has for some time been conduct- ing Plastiatrics studies aimed at de- veloping as complete engineering data as possible on Dow molding materials. As engineers know, four variables de- termine the limits of plastics perform- ance — time, temperature, stress and environment (which may be air of varying moisture content, or water, solvents, fumes, vapors, etc.). Yet while it is standard practice to evaluate the effects of time, temperature, and stress, the role of environment may easily be overlooked, even though studies prove it to be equally important in design engineering. For example, when environment re- duces the design strength of plastics below the sum of internal and external stresses, stress cracking occurs — and this takes place in some environments at relatively low stresses, compared to shost-time tensile strength. The three- dimensional graph shown here was developed during Dow’s Plastiatrics study of the effect of environment on plastics materials. It illustrates to what degree environmental changes may affect the strength of materials, and that the results of evaluating incomplete data may well be misleading. For example, if readings were taken only at the widely scattered points “P”, “P-1” and “P-2”, a designer might be justified in assuming that material char- acteristics in air and in the environment “X” are nearly identical, and that the relationship would hold at other points of measurement. But further testing reveals a considerable difference be- TEMPERATURE = DESIGN STKENGTH, PSI Environmental changes may drastically affect the design strength of plastics materials. The curves plotted here illustrate stress limits of a particular material in air, and in another environment. tween the two curves at point “P-3”\". Here the design strength is found to be substantially less in environment “X” than in air. Comprehensive data, of the type illus- trated in this graph, are being developed through Dow’s continuing series of Plastiatrics studies. As the gathering of the data is completed, it will be made available on request, and portions of it will be published in future Plastiatrics articles. Considerable data are already available on several Dow molding ma- terial formulations. For information write THE DOW CHEMICAL COMPANY, Midland, Michigan, Plastics Sales De- partment 2104CS8.

Van Boskirk Section 1 August 1959 High density PE at Housewares Show. High density polyethylene invaded the Housewares Show in Atlantic City, N. J. in impressive fashion. It hasn’t pushed out conventional PE by any means—and poundage is still modest—but it is rapidly becoming an important factor in housewares molding. Some of the largest molders are still approaching a large scale changeover to high density in a most cautious manner—long-time contracts for purchase of conventional PE and changes in molding technique are claimed to be their reasons for hold- ing back. But other molders have gane for it like bears after honey. The prin- cipal items involved are bowls, pitcher and tumbler sets, and large pieces, such as step-on garbage cans, dish pans, wastebaskets, and especially vegetable bins. There is also a large amount of blended high and low density material involved that is often used at a density of about 0.940. Various molders still fuss about changing over from low to high density PE, but they also fussed about changing over from polystyrene to PE a few years ago. Years ago they fussed about changing from acetate to poly- styrene. But inevitably the change came when certain molders adopted the newer material, and others had to follow to keep up with competition. In a few year’s time, high density PE may equal or exceed all other plastics in volume use at the Housewares Show. _ How much volume is involved? The poundage of high density PE used in house- wares is debatable. In 1958 some 75 or 80 million lb. of all types of PE were used for housewares. In 1959 there will probably be close to 100 million in- volved. Suppliers hope that 40 million may be high density. But competition from other materials has already entered the field. Union Carbide’s new copolymer medium density (0.935) PE, which gives rigidity, low temperature, flexibility, easy flow and gloss, was evident in sur- prisingly large volume in large pieces, such as garbage containers and waste- baskets. Another competitor is polypropylene, as mentioned in the paragraph below. Polypropylene in housewares. Several new items in polypropylene attracted con- siderable attention. A 16-piece set of dinnerware that retails for $5.95 and will take all kinds of abuse in a dishwasher was one. A Platter Porter, which is a carrying-filing case for 45-rpm records that employs the built-in hinge and snap, was another. Perhaps the most sensational was a line of stacking shelves —3 shelves—that can be used for books, dishes, etc. They weighed 4 pounds. Another molder had a strainer which is used for pouring water off hot cooked food—said it was “so easy” to mold and would take the heat without distor- tion. A Chicago molder had a line of tumblers, bowls, and crispers with bottom portion that could be used as a dishpan. He (To page 37) *Reg. U.S. Pat. Off. AUGUST 1959 Chicago Molded plastic licks corrosion problem...cuts cost, too This molded plastic part is an important component of a deep-well pump. For years it was made of brass and subject to the abrasive and corrosive effects of impure waters. How could it be improved? Would a plastic resist this wear and absorb little or no water? That’s when the manufacturer came to Chicago Molded. Our answer—to injection mold it in linear polyethylene. Cost—only a small fraction that of brass, with finishing eliminated. We had an idea, too, that the smooth surface of the part would improve the efficiency of the pump. It worked just that way, and it’s good business at several thousand parts a year. We’re equally experienced at compression and transfer molding . . . practically every known plastic. Because of this we can make unbiased recommendations . . . provide the material and method that will assure utmost value to you. Perhaps custom molded plastics can solve your problem.

CHICAGO MOLDED PRODUCTS CORPORATION 1046 North Kolmar Avenve, Chicago 51, Illinois MODERN PLASTICS THE PLASTISCOPE (Continued from page 35) was extremely enthusiastic in his praise for the new material becayse of its finish and “easy” molding. Especial emphasis was given to the built-in hinge that seems particularly adaptable to PP because of toughness and flexibility —lids for coffee pots are the first example. Some molders are using it for a hinge on large items, such as garbage can lids. New company to make polymers. Western Petrochemical Corp., 2 West 45th St., New York, N. Y., is a new company organized to discover and develop new polymers. The president is Maurycy Bloch, formerly general manager of War- wick Wax, once a division of Sun Chemical, but now separated from that com- pany to form the basis of Western. One of the directors and company con- sultant is Dr. Herman Mark, well known polymer chemist. Dr. Norman G. Gaylord, formerly assistant director of organic chemistry at Interchemical, will head up the polymer division of Western. One purpose of the company is to upgrade waxes by adopting polymer technology. Waxes are low molecular weight polymers which can be reacted with other materials to form block or graft polymers. Dr. Gaylord will direct activities toward improving wax properties but also find more use for them with plastics. During this development work there will be an effort to create new and distinct polymers not necessarily based on waxes. It is ex- pected that early attention will be directed to emulsion polymers and dis- covery of improved plastic coating resins. An interesting sidelight on this venture is the indication that the wax industry isn’t going to submit easily to invasion of its field by poly- ethylene and other plastics. It’s not only going to fight the possible loss of wax coated milk containers, but may also bring in a new line of plastics to compete in other areas. New producer of polystyrene. A new entrant into the plastics field from whom much more will be heard in the future is Amoco Chemicals Corp. of Chicago, which has announced plans to build a large scale polystyrene polymer plant in Joliet, Ill. that will be completed by the third quarter of 1961. Product de- velopment facilities are expected to be in operation by the second quarter of 1960, and will produce a variety of high impact and general purpose polysty- rene for customer evaluation by the second quarter of 1960. The plant operation will be based on a process for the manufacture of polystyrene developed by the research laboratories of Standard Oil Co. (Indiana) and is supposedly a low cost operation. Amoco is an off-shoot of Standard and has already built a plant to produce phthalic anhydride, iso- phthalic acid and terephthalic, the latter of which is used for production of polyester resins similar to those used in Mylar and Dacron. Standard has also done extensive research in polyolefins, and is involved in the patent scramble that envelops the polypropylene situation. It is assumed that Amoco will eventually carry the ball in this operation and sooner or later become a pro- ducer of polyolefins. Amoco’s venture into polystyrene marks the advent of an eighth major polymer producer in addition to several low volume producers and sev- eral copolymer plants. In March the industry produced molding (To page 39) AUGUST 1959 | bAC BESIN | | | teh \\ IG 4 Ped X\\ OVC REST HAS REAL “BLOTTER-ACTION” IN PLASTICIZER ABSORPTION... In coated fabrics, extruded and molded products requir- ing high concentrations of plasticizer, the ‘‘blotter-action”’ of Vygen 161 gives outstanding results. Its ability to absorb much more plasticizer than ordinary resins makes it an ideal blending resin with which to obtain dry pre- blends containing as much as 60-100 parts of plasticizer. In addition to its high plasticizer ‘“‘take-up”’, Vygen 161 also provides excellent heat stability. With Vygen 161, heated pre-blenders are not required. Blending cycles are shorter, and the dry pre-mix offers faster fluxing on either open mills or in Banburys.

First four months production in 1959 was 196 million lb., compared to 127 million in 1958. Nobody seems able to explain where this big growth has come from— “it’s clear across the board” say producers—but it is obvious that much of it is impact types. Total production and sales in 1958 was around 450 million and there is scarcely a soul who will predict more than an optimistic 600 million lb. sales figure in 1959, despite the tremendous first four month’s consumption. Amoco is stepping into one of the most unpredictable fields of all plastics, but one thing is certain—those who predicted polystyrene would start leveling off a year or so ago have had a long “wait and see” period. Another producer of polycarbonates. Mobay Chemical plans to manufacture polycarbonate resins in a new plant at New Martinsville, W. Va. that is to be completed in early 1960. Farbenfabriken-Bayer, which with Monsanto owns Mobay, has been manufacturing polycarbonates on a commercial scale in Ger- many for nearly a year, and a Mobay team is studying technology and appli- cations there now. It is expected that Bayer’s know-how will thus be used to help Mobay get into production rapidly. The material will be marketed under the tradename Merlon. Effect of steel strike. As this item goes to press the steel strike has had little effect on raw material supply for plastics. Benzene, derived from coking in the steel plants and used for production of styrene, phenol, nylon, and maleic, is the chief material involved. It is presumed that users began anticipating this pos- sibility as long ago as last February and built up their stocks to take care of a possible shortage that could be caused by shutting down the steel plants. There could be some pinches if the strike lasts more than six weeks, and real shortages if it goes over two months, except that all business would probably slow down with a resultant drop in demand for plastics and other products. When the strike is in force, production of benzene drops from around 30: to about 18 million gal. a month, so that a user may still get half his usual amount and thus stretch out his present inventory. This 18 million is made up of about 3 million from coke ovens still operating, tar distillers, petroleum, and imports. Gulf Oil has just announced a new 30 million gal.-a- year benzene plant to add to this capacity. Benzene from Russia has been re- ported available at less than 25¢, compared to 31¢ domestic benzene, but aside from the large amount contracted for by Dow, very little is known to have been purchased. The Russians generally ask that something be purchased from them in return, and U. S. customers are not interested. Phthalic for plasticizers and reinforced plastics. Napthalene, from which phthalic anhydride is produced, is, likewise, affected by the current steel strike, but the supply is thought to be sufficient to last through September, even though phthalic plants are now running full blast and there has been little chance for building up inventories except perhaps in finished goods. Demand for phthalate in plasticizers and polyesters has remained strong through July, but customers are not as anxious as they were (To page 41) AUGUST 1959 The severe, ill-fitting ‘‘“envelope’”’ bathing cap of former days is outmoded.

Perhaps the best sign that supply is keeping up with demand is that there is no apparent indication of black marketing in phthalic. Maleic anhydride situation. Maleic, which has been in the news for some time be- cause of a temporary tightness, could be affected by a shortage of benzene from coking plants. However, it would only require around 10 million gal. to make the 60 million lb. of maleic which is expected to be consumed in 1959. The tightness in maleic is believed to have arisen from the extra heavy demand for polyester laminating resins used in boats since maleic is an ingredient in the polyesters. But this business was expected to slacken in the summer and fall when boat building normally falls off. In 1958 consumption of maleic was estimated at around 54 million lb. or 80% of capacity and accord- ing to one analyst was divided as follows: Polyesters, 23 million lb.; alkyds, 14 million; agricultural uses, 6 million; rosin sizing, 3/2 million; miscellaneous applications, 8 million. Maleic expansion. The temporary tightness in maleic has been followed by a flock of expansion announcements even though there is no guarantee that the recent scarcity is any more than a passing incident. Present capacity of companies producing maleic from benzene—Allied, Monsanto, and Reichhold—is thought to be around 60 million lb., and there is a small amount that could be derived as a by-product from phthalic production. American Cyanamid will bring in its new 14-million-lb. plant this fall and increase to 20 million in 1960. Reich- hold has announced an expansion of from about 5 now to 20 million later. Allied’s National Aniline Div., which claims to be the largest producer, will in- crease by an unannounced amount late this year. Heyden Newport plans to build a 24-million-lb. plant at Fords, N. J. When all this new capacity comes in (a good portion for captive use), there is likely to be enough maleic around to produce headaches and salesman’s colic for several years to come, unless the polyester resin business grows even faster than its most imaginative boosters have ever forecast. Rexall buys Imco. Another peg was driven into the Rexall Drug & Chemical Co.’s growing plastics kingdom with the recent acquisition of the Injection Molding Co. of Kansas City. Imco is a pioneer polyethylene bottle producer that started business 13 years ago with three extrusion machines and still holds patents on the process of heat embossing product names and information on plastic containers. According to the Kansas City Star, 187,500 shares of Rexall stock were to be exchanged for the outstanding 500,000 shares of Imco. With Rexall stock selling at $50 a share, the transaction amounts to almost $9% million. The company employs 600 persons—250 in Kansas City and the others in plants at Excelsior Springs, Mo., Belvidere, N. J., Harrisonburg, Va., and Codksville, Ontario, Canada. William Archer, president of Imco, will continue as active head of the firm.

The editors take no responsibility for opinions expressed. “Boss of the Year’’ I thought you might be interested to know that a plastics manufacturer is in the running for the interna- tional title of “Boss of the Year.” In April, the Nashville, Tenn. Chapter of the National Secretaries Assn. named as Nashville’s “Boss of the Year” William R. McLain, Presi- dent of Kusan, Inc., manufacturers of plastic toys, trains, and industrial products for the past 13 years. Now Mr. McLain is eligible for the inter- national title, and I'll bet he’ll make it. We are shown together in the photograph. I'm particularly happy to report this to you since he’s my boss. . . I've been vith Kusan since Septem- ber, 1952 . . . and I nominated him. Why? Primarily because he possesses intelligence, creativeness, foresight- edness, humbleness, and leadership. He is a person of understanding and a man of the highest character. I have never known him to be unfair to anyone. He will go over half way to give the customer the best for his money, and to give his employees the best equipment to work with at the best salary possible. I’m sending you this letter because it occurs to me that your publication might like to be advised of this rec- ognition. Mrs. Robert L. Howell Secy. to Mr. McLain Kusan, Inc. Nashville, Tenn. Easier said than done We have been concerned about the difficulties involved in interpreting Underwriters Laboratories’ recent Ae proposal regarding the use of plastics in room air conditioners. Some of these difficulties may have arisen be- cause of a failure on the part of the plastics industry to tell the full story of our efforts to develop suitable “flameproof” materials that can do all the jobs present thermoplastics are doing in appliances. Apparently there has been some lack of awareness of the severe barriers in terms of fabrication problems and reduction of impact strengths or other prop- erties which are lost in the process of “flameproofing.” We feel that it is of the utmost importance that the public, the ap- pliance industry, and Underwriters Laboratories be fully aware of the magnitude of the task asked of the plastics industry: i.e., to produce a flameproof material which is at the same time as practical and economi- cal as the materials now being used. It is equally important that all ele- ments of industry and the public be fully aware that we are acting, not against safety, but in the public in- terest in the broadest sense. Our efforts in accomplishing this will con- tinue to be of critical importance as they have been in the past. It may be that the time is appro- priate for a summary article review- ing the work done to date by the plastics industry toward develop- ment of flameproof materials which are economical and can be widely used. If Mopern PLasTics, as a ma- jor spokesman for the industry, is interested in such a project, we will cooperate in all possible ways to de- velop this story. R. N. Hampton, Appliance Market Coordinator, Molding Materials Sales, Plastics Department The Dow Chemical Co. Midland, Mich. Mopbern Ptastics is indeed. We are readying such an article on the in- creasingly important subject of flame resistance in plastics for our Sept. issue. —Ed. To complete the record We were delighted to find that the Redmanson drums were included in your article (“Why the fast-growing market for big PE containers,” MPI, June 1958, p. 85). We have already had several inquiries from potential customers for the drums and appre- ciate the publicity very much. Prices of these containers are substantially less than “one-third that of stainless steel drums,” however. We regret having been unable to send you a photograph of our 55-gal. drum in time to have it included in your article, which showed the pic- tures of many of the drums and con- tainers produced by other fine com- panies in this field. Your readers may have an interest in seeing a picture of this large container and we, therefore, enclose a glossy print of a 10-year-old girl holding the 55- gal. drum and cover. This drum is without doubt the largest container ever made by conventional injection molding technique and so far as we can determine, is either the larg-st or one of the largest products of any kind ever produced in plastics by injection molding. L. Earl Hoffman, Vice-President, Sales Redmanson Corporation York, Pa. We read with great interest your article on big polyethylene contain- ers. It was a very complete article, the only thing missing was the name of our company; we have been mak- ing tanks up to 100 gal. by the heat welding fabrication method for many, many years. K.

In the TO-24 unwind unit, called the “Flying Splice,” two rolls of stock are mounted on tandem shafts in a rotatable turret. When the first roll is exhausted, the turret rotates, and the second roll can be instan- taneously spliced onto the moving web without a break in the process. The TO-24R rewind unit, which Stanford calls the “Flying Knife,” has a turret equipped with dual windup shafts. When the desired cut-off point is reached, the knife action of the turret instantly attaches the moving web to the fresh core. Both machines handle 18- to 72- in. O.D. rolls and operate at speeds of 1000 ft./min. They are adjustable to any web width, have automatic cut-off knives, power-driven turn- over, and air chuck. Constant tension brakes and an automatic web guide are optional features. Stanford Engi- neering Co., Salem, IIl. Injection molding machine The Natco 800 injection molding ma- chine offers a patented closed cir- cuit hydraulic system, which is said to eliminate the possibility of hy- draulic shock.

Gage for wire coating A portable eccentricity gage en- ables unskilled help to make in- stantaneous measurements of the eccentricity and/or thickness of insulation on coated wires. Measure- ments are made without interrupting the process, and one instrument can be used to check the operation of a number of extrusion heads. Suitably modified, it can also be used to 46 measure the wall thickness of ex- truded plastic tubing and to monitor such thicknesses. Developed in Switzerland, the instrument is mar- keted in the U. S. by InterSales Co., P.O. Box 621, New Canaan, Conn. Nuclear thickness gage The Model 42000 nuclear thickness gage is capable of measuring mate- rial thicknesses to within two-mil- lionths of an inch on such products as film, coatings, resin impregnations, foils. The gage is fully compensated for temperature changes, has a con- tinuously variable response time from % to 30 sec., can be used in pairs with a single electronic control unit to detect thickness or density at two points. This makes it easy to measure a difference in thickness or density between two points in an operation. For example, the gage can register the areal density of an applied impregnation on a cloth or paper by detecting density before and after impregnation.

House and Home 15, 132- 34B, 210, 212 (Jan. 1959). The re- marks made at a conference of plas- tics experts, architects, builders, and others on the uses of plastics in home building are summarized. The results indicate that the use of plas- tics in this field is rising and will be increasing at a more rapid rate. Plastics up 10%. Canadian Plastics 1959, 36-39, 42-47, 55 (Feb.). A sta- tistical review of the plastics indus- try in Canada in 1958 is presented. Overall sales rose 10% above those in 1957 and passed the 300-million- pound mark. Over 25 figures and tables are used to illustrate the pro- duction, imports, exports, and con- sumption of the various kinds of plastics and resins in 1958, and to compare these figures with those for preceding years. Plastics engineering 1957-1958. R. I. Leininger and R. A. Clark. Mechani- cal Eng. 81, 54-57 (Mar. 1959). The developments in the plastics indus- try for the past year are reviewed. New materials, products, applica- tions, and engineering knowledge are described. Developments in condensation poly- mers. R. J. W. Reynolds. Plastics Inst. Trans. and J. 27, 44-50 (Apr. 1959). Recent developments in poly- amides, polyesters, polyethers, and polyurethanes are described in de- tail. Growth, competition keynote plastic film outlook. Chem. Week 84, 40-42 (May 9, 1959). The growth of plas- tics films in packaging is discussed. Consumption statistics and materials packaged are considered. What’s new in plastics for engineer- ing uses. M. W. Riley. Materials in Design Eng. 49, 105-07 (Apr. 1959). Polyester resins have been designed to be molded at low pressures by compression and transfer molding. Glass-reinforced compounds require molding pressures of only 10 to 100 p.s.i. A new chlorinated epoxy resin has been designed for castings, pot- tings, or laminates, where flame re- sistance is required. Mechanical strengths of both castings and lami- nates are lower than those obtain- able with other epoxies. The use of reinforced plastics for ultra-high temperature uses is described. The mechanism of ablation involves both thermal and mechanical effects. Thermal effects may include crack- ing or flaking away of expanded material, sublimation, run-off of melted material, pyrolysis, and com- bustion. Mechanical effects may in- clude impact erosion due to local impact of particles in the gas stream, and shearing caused by fracture in wind stresses. Materials Plastics seek static-free market re- ception. Chem. Week 84, 53-54 (May 23, 1959). Antistatic agents for use in molding compounds and on the surfaces of plastics are described. C-oil, a new hydrocarbon thermo- setting resin for reinforced plastics. H. Clark and B. M. Vanderbilt. Brit. Plastics 32, 69-71 (Feb. 1959). C-oil is described as an 80/20 copolymer of butadiene-styrene in which the butadiene functions essentially as a monoolefin, yielding a polymer con- taining vinyl side groups. The poly- mer has been used successfully as a binder resin for glass-reinforced laminates to produce light weight, translucent panels with good chem- ical resistance and excellent electri- cal properties. The preferred resin system consists of vinyltoluene, as the monomeric crosslinking agent, and a mixed catalyst of dicumene peroxide and di-tert-butyl peroxide. Best results were obtained with laminates containing glass fiber sized with a vinyl silane type finish. Borohydrides make better foams. Chem. Eng. News 37, 38-9 (Apr. 6. 1959). Activated borohydrides are used as blowing agents for vinyl chloride plastic foams. Polyester laminates for material of communication apparatus. K. Yana- gihora, T. Suzuki, and Y. Gomi. Re- inforced Plastics 4, 6-12 (1958). Polyesters were prepared by react- ing maleic anhydride with diethyl- ene, triethylene, propylene and di- propylene glycols, 1,3-butanediol, and 2,2-dimethyl propanediol. The effects of molecular structure on shrinkage during cure, thermal ex- pansion, dielectric constant, impact strength and water absorption were studied. New plastic bridges temperature gap. Chem. Eng. 66, 194, 196, 198 (Mar. 23, 1959). A new plastic, poly- bischloromethyl oxetane, a chlori- nated polyether, is described. It i"
