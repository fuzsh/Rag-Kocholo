        "text": "This page intentionally left blank\n\nCosmopolitan Communications Cultural Diversity in a Globalized World\n\nSocieties around the world have experienced a flood of information from diverse channels originating beyond local communities and even national borders, transmitted through the rapid expansion of cosmopolitan communications. For more than half a century, conventional interpretations, Pippa Norris and Ronald Inglehart argue, have commonly exaggerated the potential threats arising from this process. A series of firewalls protect national cultures. This book develops a new theoretical framework for understanding cosmopolitan communications and uses it to identify the conditions under which global communications are most likely to endanger cultural diversity. The authors analyze empirical evidence at both the societal level and the individual level, examining the outlook and beliefs of people in a wide range of societies. The study draws on evidence from the World Values Survey, which covers 90 societies in all major regions worldwide from 1981 to 2007. The conclusion considers the implications of the authors’ findings for cultural policies.\n\nPippa Norris is the McGuire Lecturer in Comparative Politics at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University. Her work analyzes comparative elections and public opinion, gender politics, and political communications. Companion volumes by this author, also published by Cambridge University Press, include A Virtuous Circle (2000), Digital Divide (2001), Democratic Phoenix (2002), Rising Tide (2003, with Ronald Inglehart), and Electoral Engineering (2004). Ronald Inglehart is Professor of Political Science and Program Director at the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan. His research deals with changing belief systems and their impact on social and political change. He helped found the Eurobarometer Surveys and directs the World Values Survey. Related books include Modernization and Postmodernization (1997); Rising Tide (2003, with Pippa Norris); and Development, Cultural Change and Democracy (2004, with Christian Welzel).\n\ncommunication, society and politics Editors W.

The new technologies challenge boundaries of many kinds – between news, information, entertainment, and advertising; between media, with the arrival of the World Wide Web; and even between nations. Communication, Society and Politics probes the political and social impacts of these new communication systems in national, comparative, and global perspective.\n\nTitles in the Series: C.

large debts to many friends and colleagues. The analysis draws on a unique database, the World Values Survey (WVS) and the European Values Surveys (EVS), conducted from 1981 to 2007. These representative mass surveys provide data from countries comprising almost 90 percent of the world’s population and covering the full range of variation, from societies with per capita incomes as low as $300 per year to societies with per capita incomes a hundred times that high, and from long-established democracies with market economies to authoritarian states and former socialist states.

Most of these surveys were supported financially by sources within a given country, but assistance for surveys where such funding was not available, as well as for central coordination, was provided by the National Science Foundation, the Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation, the Swedish Agency for International Development, the Volkswagen Foundation, the Netherlands Foreign Ministry, and the BBVA Foundation. For more information about the World Values Survey, see the WVS Web site, http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org. The European surveys were conducted by the European Values Study group. For more information, see the EVS Web site, http://www.europeanvalues.nl/. This study builds on our previous books based on the WVS, Rising Tide: Gender Equality and Cultural Change Around the World (2003), which examined changing attitudes toward gender roles, and Sacred and Secular: Politics and Religion Worldwide (2004), which analyzed the role of religion in the contemporary world. Some of the\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nxv\n\npreliminary ideas of this study were first presented at professional conferences, including the Mid-West Political Science Association meeting in Chicago in March 2008 and the American Political Science Association annual meeting in Boston in August 2008, where we benefited from the useful feedback of discussants and colleagues. We also appreciated the opportunity to discuss these ideas at the CommGAP/World Bank and Harvard University Workshop on the Role of the Media in the Governance Agenda in May 2008. In addition, valuable feedback was generated during discussions with colleagues at the meeting of the World Values Survey Conference and General Assembly in Istanbul in September 2008, generously hosted by Yilmaz Esmer and Bahc¸esehir University. We have received support for the theme of this book in conversations over the years with many colleagues. We are also most grateful to Mark Franklin and Cees van der Eijk and all those who went out of their way to provide feedback on ideas for the research design or to read draft chapters and provide chapter-and-verse comments. The support of Cambridge University Press has been invaluable, particularly the efficient assistance and continual enthusiasm of our editor, Lew Bateman, as well as the comments of the reviewers. We thank Jaime Diez Medrano for cleaning, documenting, and archiving the WVS and Martin Alonso at Harvard University for assistance in collecting aggregate datasets. Finally, this book would not have been possible without the encouragement and stimulation provided by many colleagues and students at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government and at the Department of Political Science and the Institute for Social Research of the University of Michigan.

The king lifted the ban on the small screen as part of a radical plan to modernize his isolated mountain kingdom and boost the gross national happiness. The country had traditionally restricted tourism and emphasized spirituality and environmental protection over rampant capitalism. Suddenly, however, an idyllic and peaceful tantric Buddhist culture that had barely changed in centuries, with little access in rural areas to electricity or telecommunications, let alone the Internet, was bombarded by about four dozen cable channels, broadcasting mainly imported programs.1 For cable subscribers, the nightly onslaught opened the world of Posh and Becks, of Larry King Live and The Simpsons, of the World Wrestling Federation and American Idol, of Bollywood soap operas, of music videos and reality TV, of CNN and BBC World News. The country plugged into the Internet the following year. All too soon reporters noted Bhutan’s first wave of crimes – murder, fraud, drug offenses. Bhutan had suddenly crash-landed in the 21st century. Public concern quickly mounted over threats to the country’s unique culture. The letters page in local newspapers featured columns of worried correspondence: ‘Dear Editor, TV is very bad for our country; it controls our minds . . . and makes [us] crazy. The enemy is right here with us in our own living room. People behave like the actors, and are now anxious, greedy and discontented.’2 Others expressed concern that a\n\n3\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\ngulf had opened up between the old Bhutan and the new. One minister observed, ‘Until recently, we shied away from killing insects, and yet now we Bhutanese are asked to watch people on TV blowing heads off with shotguns. Will we now be blowing each other’s heads off?’3 Television was widely blamed for a host of social ills, whether weakening spiritual values, undermining ancient traditions, inciting fraud, encouraging material consumerism, destroying family life, or provoking murder among a peaceable people. In response to public concern, in 2006 the government established a new ministry and regulatory authority to determine Bhutan’s communication policy, including protecting vulnerable sectors of the public from the effects of excessive violence, obscenity, and drug taking.4 But was the introduction of TV a major cause of these problems? Will access to modern information and communication technologies erode Bhutan’s traditional Buddhist culture and its feudal society? Will wrestling displace the national sport of archery, will English be spoken instead of Dzongkha and Sharchop, and will jeans be worn instead of the gho and kira? Or are these concerns exaggerated? Bhutan is perhaps the most dramatic recent example of a developing country adapting to an electronic invasion, but it is far from alone; most societies have experienced a flood of information from diverse channels originating far beyond local communities and national borders. Ideas and images are transmitted from society to society through terrestrial, cable, and satellite television and radio stations, feature films, DVDs, and video games, books, newspapers, and magazines, advertising, the music industry and the audiovisual arts, the digital world of the Internet, Web sites, Tivo, streaming YouTube videos, iPod players, podcasts, wikis, and blogs, as well as through interpersonal connections via mobile cellular and fixed-line telephony, social networking Web sites (like MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter), e-mail, VoIP (Skype), and instant text messaging. The world has come to our front door. These profound changes are widely observed. But the consequences – especially the impact of the penetration of the mass media into geographically isolated cultures that were previously stranded at the periphery of modern communication grids – are far from clear. What happens to distant rural communities in Bhutan, as well as far-flung districts and remote provinces in Burkina Faso, Burma, and\n\nIs Cultural Diversity Under Threat?\n\n5\n\nAfghanistan, once the world connects directly to these places and the people living in them learn more about the world? In particular, will this process generate cultural convergence around modern values, and will national diversity be threatened? Debate about the supposed peril arising from ‘cultural imperialism,’ ‘Coca-colonization,’ or ‘McDonaldization’ has raged for almost half a century. Nor is this a dated remnant of the cold war era; new protectionist cultural policies have been implemented during the past few years, including those by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the European Union. At its heart, this book develops a new theoretical framework and provides systematic evidence to support the argument. We hypothesize that the expansion of information flowing primarily from the global North to South will have the greatest impact on converging values in cosmopolitan societies characterized by integration into world markets, freedom of the press, and widespread access to the media. Parochial societies lacking these conditions are less likely to be affected by these developments. Moreover, within countries, many poor sectors continue to lack the resources and skills necessary to access modern communication technologies. Important social psychological barriers further limit the capacity of the media to alter enduring values and attitudes. A failure to take account of the role of these sequential firewalls has commonly led to exaggerated assessments of the risks to national diversity. These conditions are not confined to the most hermetically sealed and rigidly controlled autocracies, such as Burma and North Korea, or to isolated villages and provincial communities off the mass communication grid in Tibet, Bhutan, and Mali; instead, these barriers are found in many parts of the world. This book outlines these ideas and then lays out the evidence, drawing on the World Values Survey, which covers 95 countries worldwide from 1981 to 2007. The mixed-method research design combines hierarchical linear models, cross-sectional time-series analysis, and selected qualitative case studies. The broad comparative framework and the wide-ranging evidence make it possible to test the core propositions empirically. The concluding chapter considers the implications for cultural policies. Let us start by clarifying our central concepts and reviewing the controversy surrounding cosmopolitan communications and then outline how this book proceeds in more detail.\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhy Cosmopolitan Communications Are Believed to Threaten Cultural Diversity The starting point for our study is the observation that mass communications have been profoundly affected by the broader phenomenon of globalization – the process of expanding networks of interdependence spanning national boundaries, which follows the increasingly swift movement of ideas, money, goods, services, ecology, and people across territorial borders. Globalization is understood here to be multidimensional, encompassing economic aspects, such as the flow of trade, labor, and capital; social aspects, such as interpersonal contacts and mediated information flows; and political dimensions, including the integration of countries into international and regional organizations.5 Strictly speaking, most mass communications are not and have not become global (meaning covering all parts of the world); rather, communications are in the process of becoming increasingly networked and exchanged across nation-states. These developments render territorial borders more permeable and open to external forces – making most places increasingly similar to bustling Heathrow, JFK, and Schiphol international airports and less like the isolated capitals of Pyongyang, Ashgabat, and Naypyidaw. In this study, globalization is understood to be a complex phenomenon that should not be confused with ‘modernization,’ ‘Westernization,’ or ‘Americanization,’ as the term is sometimes used.6 By some measures, many smaller countries, such as Singapore, Malaysia, South Africa, Estonia, Hungary, and Israel, are more highly integrated into the world economy than is the United States.7 Moreover, insofar as basic values are shifting, such countries as Sweden, the Netherlands, and Australia are more at the cutting edge of this process than the United States, although these changes are sometimes mistakenly dubbed ‘Americanization.’8 Globalization is far from a novel phenomenon; it has occurred historically in periodic waves, whether driven by free trade, population migrations, military conquests, technology, or religious conversions.9 Arguably both the Roman Empire and medieval Europe under Charlemagne represented earlier manifestations of this trend. The invention of the postal service, electronic telegraph, iron railway, and steamship during the industrial age connected once-distant lands. Networks of 19th-century traders, missionaries, soldiers, and diplomats linked\n\nIs Cultural Diversity Under Threat?\n\n7\n\npeoples and places. Globalization has experienced eras of advance and retreat. Seen as an ongoing process, globalization is conceptualized as a work in progress rather than as an end state. But as we will demonstrate, the late 20th century witnessed a decisive acceleration in the scale, density, and velocity of interactions that cut across national boundaries. Due to these developments, places that were once isolated and remote are now increasingly interconnected. Evidence of this phenomenon is all around us. As the authors sit in Massachusetts and Michigan, respectively, we follow real-time news of events in Darfur or Baghdad on our laptops and BlackBerries. Headlines about Barack Obama’s victory instantly surged around the globe, connecting Kenyans celebrating in local villages with Americans rejoicing in Times Square. Travelers have access to Internet cafes in Bali, CNN in Doha Airport, or Die Hard movies in Beijing. Satellite TV from Al Jazeera and Al Arabia broadcasts reality television shows, music clips, and news images to 200 million Arab speakers from Morocco to Syria. People living in Belgium, the Netherlands, or Switzerland can receive dozens of foreign-language channels from Britain, Germany, Italy, and France on their cable TV. Mexican and Brazilian telenovelas are ubiquitous on Latin American television, as are American sitcoms in Canada, Australian soaps in Britain, British crime series in the United States, and Bollywood movies in South Asia. Reuters, Associated Press, and Agence France-Presse transmit foreign stories to newsrooms around the world. International markets are linked in real time by Bloomberg Business News, the Dow Jones, and related financial tickers. Telecenters in Bangalore and Toronto help Microsoft customers in London, Berlin, and Sydney. Cell phones and text messages instantly connect e´ migr´e Mexican, Chinese, and Turkish workers with news from relatives back home. Younger Americans and Europeans take all this for granted today, but it is striking to recall how rapidly it has transformed lives; the World Wide Web, born in 1989, is still in its adolescence.10 Multiple developments have expanded the volume and pace of information flowing across national borders. This process operates through the direct transfer of people – for example, through international travel, foreign tourism, and emigration. It happens through interpersonal communications, via the traditional flow of overseas\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\npostal mail, international phone calls, telegrams, and faxes, and more recently through person-to-person e-mails and text messages. Today the process also increasingly works through the diverse channels of mass communications. These include traditional printed publications (the overseas trade in newspapers, magazines, and books) and audiovisual media (the international market in radio and television news and entertainment programs, foreign videos, DVDs, movies and feature films, popular music, and transnational TV satellite and cable broadcasts), as well as the complicated flow occurring via more recent forms of digital information technologies, some of which blend the interpersonal with mass communications (typically via Web sites, online videos, blogs, virtual communities, interactive video games, and listserve e-mails).11 The concept of ‘cosmopolitan’ communications emphasizes the channels that increasingly bind people living in diverse communities and nation-states together. The word ‘cosmopolitan,’ which derives from the Greek word kosmopolitˆes (citizen of the world), refers to the idea that all humans increasingly live and interact within a single global community, not simply within a single polity or nationstate.12 The conceptual distinction between cosmopolitans and locals has been part of the social sciences at least since Robert Merton developed it to study small-town America during World War II.13 In recent years, the concept of cosmopolitanism has come back into vogue as an increasingly popular way to rethink processes of democracy for the purpose of extending these principles to international life. The idea of cosmopolitan democracy emphasizes that the principles of democracy should operate within states, but also among states and at the global level; one of the relevant issues is how citizens can organize collectively in civil society and have their voices heard in multilateral organizations beyond the boundaries of the nation-state.14 In the same way, the idea of cosmopolitan communications can fruitfully be applied to conceptualizing the growing phenomenon of information flows that cut across state borders. Communications traditionally were far more provincial and territorial – binding together friends and neighbors living in local villages, towns, and regions through social meetings and voluntary organizations, local newspapers, community radio stations, and face-to-face interpersonal connections. The change over time should not be overstated; links between national elites have\n\nIs Cultural Diversity Under Threat?\n\n9\n\nalways been maintained through international networks, through, for example, foreign correspondents, diplomatic missions, and UN agencies and bureaus. Mobile populations have always traveled back and forth across territorial national borders, whether as footloose tourists, colonists, students, exiles, expatriate employees, labor migrants, rootless nomads, or members of diaspora communities spread over multiple states. In the contemporary era, however, connections among peoples living in different nations have often become far more cosmopolitan, with multiple information networks linking the lives of strangers from distant lands. The idea of ‘cosmopolitan communications’ is understood here, most simply, to be the way that we learn about, and interact with, people and places beyond the borders of our nation-state. This concept is thus far broader and more comprehensive than the idea of ‘transnational’ media – referring to specific communication channels and sources that are designed to reach a multinational audience, exemplified by BBC World, CNN International, Reuters, and Al Jazeera.15 From National to Cosmopolitan Communications Multiple factors contributed to the growth of cosmopolitan communications.16 In many nations, broadcasting and telecommunications were deregulated. Protectionist trade barriers were lifted. Access to the mass media widened. Innovative technologies permeated societies. Multinational media corporations expanded their empires. As a result, nations have often increasingly encountered a rising tide of ideas and images imported from abroad. During the height of the modern era of national communications, spanning the period from the rise of radio broadcasting in the early 20th century until at least the early 1980s, with a few exceptions public service corporations throughout continental Western Europe enjoyed a monopoly on the airwaves. Broadcasting operated as a nationally owned public utility monopoly, with the distribution of radio and then television licenses overseen by the postal, telegraph, and telephone authorities. Public broadcasting corporations were subject to periodic review in the issuance and renewal of licenses, modeled after the BBC. They often operated following principles of impartial balance across all major parties, with a mission to educate and entertain, although some, such as French and Greek TV, were more closely aligned with the state. The rationale for this system included spectrum scarcity and\n\n10\n\nIntroduction\n\nthe need to provide a universal service in the public interest, as well as the powerful role of broadcasters. There were some important variations in this pattern, however; Britain, Australia, and Japan operated a dual public service and commercial system from the 1950s onward, while the United States and Luxembourg favored private enterprise. Meanwhile, state broadcasters directly controlled the airwaves in Central and Eastern Europe, and most developing countries operated a mix of public service and state broadcasting. During this era, most local, regional, and national newspapers, magazines, and book publishers were usually domestically owned, with legal regulations often limiting the extent of foreign investment. Some major publications were widely distributed on the international market, but this revenue was usually subsidiary to domestic sales. In Europe, the major national production companies in the creative industries and the performing arts were also often run as public corporations. The operating costs of national opera companies, theatrical productions, and musical performances were commonly subsidized by the nation-state, as part of its cultural heritage, in common with national museums, art galleries, and archeological historical sites. Of course, this process should again not be exaggerated; cultural trade on international markets was important for certain sectors, even during the golden years of the national era. The motion picture industry has always been heavily reliant on overseas sales for generating revenues; such sales have been important for Hollywood but especially for production companies based in countries with a limited domestic audience.17 The recording music industry based in the United States, Europe, and Japan was also highly export oriented, and this was especially true for major players such as EMI, Sony, and Bertelsmann.18 Many news outlets with limited resources for overseas bureaus and correspondents have also always relied heavily on Western news agency wire services for international news and foreign affairs coverage, with distant correspondents networked by telegraph, submarine cable, teletype, and wireless and communication satellites.19 Books, periodicals, magazines, and newspapers have always relied on a proportion of their revenues from overseas sales. The trade in television programs is also long established, and U.S. exports were particularly important, as Tunstall reminds us, when broadcasting systems were first being set up in many countries during the late 1950s and 1960s and insufficient\n\nIs Cultural Diversity Under Threat?\n\n11\n\nfacilities existed for domestic productions.20 Once established, however, in most places the broadcasting and newspaper industries were usually home owned, nationally regulated, and designed primarily to serve a domestic audience; the British Broadcasting Corporation, ¨ Le Figaro, and Arbeitsgemeinschaft der offentlich-rechtlichen Rundfunkanstalten Deutschlands (German ARD) reflected their local origins, as distinctive as the Paris Opera, the Drury Lane theater, or Die Berliner Philharmoniker. The liberalization of public service broadcasting and telecommunication monopolies, which occurred in many countries during the 1980s and 1990s, led to the rapid proliferation of more loosely regulated commercial or privately owned TV and radio channels and telecommunication companies. The new channels of commercial broadcasting also fueled the expansion of mass advertising and encouraged the growth of transnational advertising and market research companies. The print sector has also been affected by growing foreign ownership of newspapers and multinational publishing companies, as well as by cross-media ownership that seeks vertical integration across delivery platforms, linking books, magazines, and newspapers with movies, videos, DVDs, and advertising. Technological developments have also played a major role in this process, shaping the way business, society, and governments work, function, and interact throughout the world, bringing multiple changes to everyday life.21 The rapid expansion of access to new information and communication technologies from the mid-1990s onward and media convergence across platforms accelerated the pace of interchanges across state boundaries through the panoply of electronic mail and text messaging, mobile phones, online Web sites and blogs, and related developments.22 Television broadcasting was transformed by the growth of satellite broadcasting and cable programming, and there were important innovations in digital technologies associated with the rise of the Internet, mobile cell phones, and multimedia convergence. Today multiple sources of entertainment, news, and information vie for attention in the most media rich environments – from feature films to YouTube videos, from headlines on the BBC World Service to CNN, and from blogs to networked e-mails – only some of which are locally or nationally based. These profound developments have had the greatest impact in advanced industrial societies, where many\n\n12\n\nIntroduction\n\npeople have adopted the paraphernalia of laptops, Wi-Fi, iPods, and BlackBerries. But digital technologies such as data-connected smartphones have also spread to emerging economies in the developing world, including some remote rural villages, but especially to those of the relatively affluent middle classes living in cities such as Mumbai, Johannesburg, and Doha. These combined trends have torn down protection and thrown open national markets to a flood of imported products, as documented in Chapter 3, providing opportunities for multinational multimedia production and distribution conglomerates. Although, as exemplified by 10 of the most important players, these are not exclusively based in the United States, all are located in a handful of larger postindustrial societies; these conglomerates include Time Warner, Viacom, Disney, the BBC (United Kingdom), Sony (Japan), News Corporation (United States–Australia), Bertelsmann (Germany), Associated Press, Reuters (United Kingdom), and General Electric. Despite some important second-tier hubs operating within particular geolinguistic regions, such as Bollywood, Al Jazeera, or TV Globo, the international trade in cultural goods and services flows mainly from a few major production conglomerates based in the global North to audiences in the rest of the world. The rise of cosmopolitan communications can therefore be traced back to the deregulation of mass communications, technological innovations, and trade liberalization, processes that started in most advanced industrialized societies during the 1980s, before this transformation eventually swept through the rest of the world in subsequent decades.23 These changes have resulted in the expansion of all major media sectors, including transnational TV networks, international news wire services, the market for feature films, television programs, and publications, advertising agencies, recorded popular music, and the Internet. The Impact of Cosmopolitan Communications on the Audience These basic developments have been widely observed, but what have been the consequences for national cultures? This question has sparked intense debate, and for more than half a century theorists have offered a range of conjectures; the alternative viewpoints are illustrated schematically in Figure 1.1.24 Perhaps the most popular view anticipates a gradual process of cultural convergence around Western values\n\nIs Cultural Diversity Under Threat?

Theories About the Impact of Cosmopolitan Communications.\n\nworldwide; the predominance of American and other Western media conglomerates in the production of cultural exports is expected to erode the diversity of traditional values, indigenous languages, and local practices found in societies importing these products. Other observers challenge these claims, however, emphasizing that many highly traditional societies in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia have actively rejected foreign ideas and images imported through Western media – from liberal sexual mores to notions of individualism, secularism, and free market capitalism – intensifying culture wars around the world. Still others claim that we are experiencing fusion, whereby cultural artifacts from many different places are exchanged, merged, and reinvented in a world bazaar. These interpretations, illustrated in Figure 1.1, predict alternative long-term effects of cosmopolitan communications, ranging from assimilation to rejection or amalgamation.25\n\n14\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn contrast to all these arguments, the more skeptical perspective developed in this study suggests that, due to the existence of important firewalls, many indigenous values, social attitudes, and core beliefs embedded within national cultures are far more impervious to the impact of cosmopolitan communications than is generally believed. The direct experience of globalization does have clear effects, as we will demonstrate, as does the mass media. Nevertheless, the influence of cosmopolitan communications has a less radical or transformative impact on deep-rooted societal differences than is often assumed. As is often the case with important new phenomena, the effect of these developments has been exaggerated. Important changes clearly are occurring, but we expect cultural diversity to persist. Let us examine the theoretical arguments in the literature. We will then outline our core argument and the reasons we remain highly skeptical of many of the sweeping claims that are commonly made. The L.A. Effect: Cultural Convergence? The most popular view of the past half century remains cultural convergence around Western values, or the ‘homogenization’ scenario, which can also be termed the ‘L.A. effect’ since so many of the consequences are thought to arise from the products generated by Hollywood and Silicon Valley. The core contention is that greater exposure to foreign news and popular entertainment, imported mainly from multinational corporations based in the United States or from other major Western producer countries, will gradually undermine, dilute, or even eradicate the variety of national identities, distinctive beliefs, cultural practices, and traditional lifestyles found around the world. Cultural convergence has often been regarded as ‘Americanization’ or ‘Westernization,’ although these notions are much too simple to capture the multinational complexity of this phenomenon. This argument is not confined to developing societies by any means; it is often expressed in European debates, such as French concerns about imported American entertainment and news. Nevertheless, if the claims of convergence are true, previously isolated traditional cultures located in peripheral geographic areas in the global South, exemplified by Bhutan, seem most vulnerable to these developments. This idea is hardly novel; these arguments echo concerns about the dominance of Western journalism and news agencies expressed at the height of the mid-20th-century era of decolonization.26 Theories\n\nIs Cultural Diversity Under Threat?\n\n15\n\nof cultural imperialism, popularized during the 1960s and 1970s by Johan Galtung and Herbert Schiller, claimed that the mass media were powerful tools used by neocolonial Western powers to exert hegemonic control over the ideas, habits, and traditions found in weaker developing states and peripheral societies.27 Thomas McPhail dubbed this phenomenon ‘electronic colonialism’ and emphasized the dangers of Americanization: ‘All of the US multimedia empires, along with their extensive advertising networks, project and encourage US tastes, values, mores, history, culture and language around the world.’28 This view was reinforced during the 1970s by Tapio Varis’s analysis of the continued imbalance of the traffic in television programs and supported by Jeremy Tunstall’s The Media Are American.29 These ideas contributed to the contentious New World Information Order debate in the early 1980, a process that divided UNESCO and left an enduring rift in the organization.30 It should not be thought that these concerns have faded with the passage of time; during the 1990s, echoes of these historic fights continued to be heard by commentators who dubbed American predominance of audiovisual trade ‘Coca-colonization’ (Howes), ‘Dallasification’ (Liebes and Katz), ‘McDonaldization’ (Ritzer, Barber), or ‘McDisneyization’ (Ritzer and Liska).31 Most commentators have usually regarded cultural convergence with concern, although Joseph S. Nye, Jr., suggests that American predominance in the market for cultural products represents a more positive and benevolent development, as ‘soft power’ can supplement the power of military might and economic resources in U.S. foreign policy.32 American observers believe that the diplomatic use of communications is an important tool that the United States can use to strengthen the spread of American and Western liberal ideas, such as the value of democratic governance, respect for human rights, and support for free markets.33 These arguments are not merely academic; their legacy has also been influential during the past decade among policymakers in the international community; indeed, political support has revived these ideas, providing the intellectual rationale for the implementation of new protectionist regulations, import quotas, tariffs, license fees, and subsidies. In 2005 UNESCO secured international agreement for the Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity, addressing the concern that global communications may be capable of undermining, or even destroying, local customs and traditions, minority native languages, and\n\n16\n\nIntroduction\n\nindigenous lifestyles in developing societies.34 The sponsors, France and Canada, gathered the support of 148 countries, with only the United States and Israel voting against the convention. Although the convention legitimates domestic legal measures protecting local creative industries, the implications for world trade remain unclear.35 Protectionist measures have also been passed by the European Union, including most recently the 2007 Audiovisual Media Services Directive, designed to provide a regulatory framework promoting Europeanproduced programming (and limiting American television program imports) within EU member states.36 In recent decades, the World Trade Organization (WTO) reached an agreement to liberalize trade in multiple economic sectors; since 1995, for example, average tariffs have fallen by one-third in member states.37 Real growth in trade has surged by around 7–9% worldwide during the past decade, affecting all regions and national income groups, with particularly strong exportled growth in emerging markets such as China, India, and Brazil. The world has negotiated trade agreements on everything from textiles and minerals to banking and manufactured products; nevertheless, sensitivities have limited attempts to further liberalize trade in cultural goods and services. But are the widespread popular fears about the potential impact of cultural convergence, arising from the imbalance in world markets, actually well founded? The consequences of these changes for the audience, and for society in general, may be far from straightforward.38 Most importantly, the convergence thesis rests, rather unreflectively, on the implicit supposition that people submissively assimilate, and even emulate, ideas and images transmitted directly by mass communications. Audiences are viewed as essentially passive, absorbing Western ideas and values, along with fashions and lifestyles. The simplest version of the argument implies a powerful and direct media effect based on a straightforward ‘stimulus–response’ psychological model. Whether the globalization of mass communications actually has these effects on the audience, however, remains to be demonstrated. For many reasons, as discussed at length in this book, deeply imbedded cultural values and attitudes in each nation may prove relatively impermeable to these processes. Despite the intensity of the theoretical debate, until recently little direct evidence has been brought to bear on these issues.39 In part,\n\nIs Cultural Diversity Under Threat?\n\n17\n\nthis neglect has arisen from the limited availability of systematic and reliable cross-national survey data on cultural values as well as media habits. It may also be attributed to ideological and methodological limitations, inadequate comparative theorizing, and the individualistic bias in the social psychological study of media behavior. Whatever the reasons, it is obviously risky to jump directly from observations about the American or Western trade imbalance in cultural markets to claims about the effects of this process on the public. It is especially dangerous when these ideas are used to justify restrictive cultural policies and the regulation of the mass media. It is true that today, compared with earlier decades, many more people living in Paris, Tokyo, and Johannesburg have access to the headlines on CNN International or BBC World, to watch a Hollywood blockbuster, or to use Google or YouTube. When they do so, it is indeed possible that they may gradually assimilate the ideas and images they are exposed to by these sources, eventually leading to long-term cultural convergence. Alternatively, they could choose to react against any messages, reinterpret their meaning, or simply ignore them. The Taliban Effect: Cultural Polarization? The cultural convergence argument has attracted many critics over the years. In particular, an alternative scenario is provided by the polarization argument, or ‘Taliban effect.’ This view does not dispute the core changes in media landscapes, including the changing economic structure of the mass media and the direction and volume of trade in international cultural markets. Rather than emulation, however, theorists such as Pearse envisage a process of active rejection by traditional societies, so that the growth of cross-border information flows may spark growing culture wars between the global North and South. For example, some observers argue that a backlash against imported Western entertainment and news, along with the values of secularism, individualism, and consumerism, has encouraged a revival of tribal loyalties and ethnic identities in the Middle East and Southeast Asia, directly fueling rage against the United States.40 According to this view, traditional societies consciously attempt to distance themselves and to protect their cultures from the foreign values, ideas, and images commonly conveyed by imported Western and American media.41 The tensions between convergence and polarization have\n\n18\n\nIntroduction\n\nbeen popularized in vivid metaphors by Benjamin Barber as the rivalry between McWorld and Jihad, while Thomas Friedman has drawn the contrast between the Lexus and the Olive Tree.42 Although the role of mass communications is not central to the argument, the idea of valuebased polarization is also reflected in Samuel Huntington’s provocative thesis, which predicts a clash of civilizations between the West and other cultures.43 In the polarization scenario, exposure to the ‘other’ is believed to provoke active measures to reject foreign threats. This process can also been termed the ‘Taliban effect,’ which refers to one of the most extreme examples of a regime trying to exert rigid control on all media in order to reduce foreign influences. After it had gained control of Afghanistan in the mid-1990s, the Taliban banned TV and cinema, as well as many types of painting and photography, cassette players, VCRs, musical instruments, and video tapes, and demolished thousands of historical statues and artifacts. In support of the polarization argument, cultural theorists suggest that audiences reinterpret the contents of messages imported from foreign media, thereby remaking their meaning in particular local contexts and undermining their intended effects.44 From this perspective, people have the capacity to actively criticize, resist, and reject media messages, just as they can read between the lines of official state propaganda, especially if the messages reflect culturally unacceptable values, attitudes, and forms of behavior. They are considered capable of deconstructing meanings and generating resistance to the spread of a uniform Western or American culture. For example, a study of audiences in various European countries that watched similar popular forms of entertainment imported from the United States (Dallas) found that people constructed diverse frameworks of meaning from this shared experience.45 Moreover, some theorists of this perspective argue that in highly traditional or socially conservative cultures, greater familiarity with Western values carried in popular entertainment and news about the world can trigger unintended effects, catalyzing new culture wars between the forces of modernization and reaction. Opposition to globalization manifests itself in popular street protests based on cultural issues (exemplified by Muslim demonstrations in Pakistan against the Danish publication of cartoons of Mohammed) and in consumer boycotts against imported cultural products or the development of local alternatives (illustrated by the popularity of Mecca\n\nIs Cultural Diversity Under Threat?\n\n19\n\nCola in the Middle East or the slow-food movement in Europe).46 The collapse of the Doha world trade negotiations in July 2008 over agricultural protectionism, after seven years of talks, also signaled the limits of this process. Political and environmental concerns may increase support for antiglobalization forces; such concerns are stimulated by rising public apprehension about global warming, the loss of jobs in rich countries, food safety and security, the growing cost of extended supply chains associated with rising oil prices, and transportation costs. The International Network for Cultural Development was formed in 1998 as an advocacy nongovernmental organization (NGO) to fight economic globalization and to promote multicultural expression, indigenous arts and crafts, and local diversity.47 Although the polarization thesis provides an interesting and plausible perspective, its relevance to the audience has not been subjected to rigorous scrutiny or evaluated against systematic evidence from public opinion surveys. Too often there is a tendency for theorists to jump from patterns of conflict that have been widely observed to casting blame on the media messenger for these developments. Hence, the spread of transnational media and cross-border information flows, exemplified by the popularity of Al Jazeera and Al Arabia, is used to explain tensions between the forces of radicalism and the status quo within Arab states, without demonstrating the connection in any systematic way, rather than attributing these developments to other underlying causes. Do people living in countries such as Egypt, Burkina Faso, and Ethiopia, who are regularly exposed to the cross-border flow of information and popular entertainment, absorb or reject the modern values contained in foreign cultural products? Does this process influence sexual mores, consumer attitudes, or trust in other nations? So far, these questions have not been addressed by systematic testing against a wide range of empirical evidence. The Bangalore Effect: Fusion? Another interpretation has also emerged – the fusion or ‘hybridization’ thesis, which can also be referred to as the ‘Bangalore effect.’ Theorists of this perspective suggest that easier and faster communications among societies generate a creative global m´elange that mixes genres, programs, and contents derived from different times or places.48 Through this process, creative ideas are exchanged in different\n\n20\n\nIntroduction\n\ncountries, but these are then remade and re-exported. As a result, the very concept of an indigenous (and American) cultural product becomes unclear. ‘Glocalization’ encourages a blending of diverse cultural repertoires through a two-way flow of global and local information generating cross-border fertilization, mixing indigenous customs with imported products. This process is thought to generate original fusions of music, design, and fashions, which are neither uniquely ethnically traditional nor industrial-modern.49 From this perspective, Asians in London’s Brick Lane, Hispanics in New York’s Queens, and pied noirs in Paris’s XVIIIe arrondissement are neither wholly Western nor purely the product of immigrant cultures but a mixture of both. McDonald’s and similar American fast-food restaurants are certainly popular, but according to this view they are outnumbered by the diverse ethnic cuisines, whether Italian, Chinese, Thai, Indian, Japanese, or Mexican, that have spread to cities throughout the world, including those in the United States. The process can be dubbed the ‘Bangalore effect,’ reflecting the global reach of the financial services and information technology companies based in that city.50 American customers seeking technical support for computer products are routinely connected to Bangalore call centers, in a geographically meaningless space. A fusion culture emphasizes that modern mass communications involve a two-way exchange worldwide, generating complex currents and eddies, seen more as a global bazaar with counterflows than a simple form of neocolonial dominance. California fusion cuisine typically amalgamates eclectic dishes – Asian, Mediterranean, and Latin American – with local farmers’ market produce. It is neither wholly local nor wholly global. Another typical fusion product is mash-up music, made by sampling, remixing, and combining distinct pop songs. The fusion interpretation suggests that although American companies predominate in the production, distribution, and sales of popular TV entertainment and feature films, these products have absorbed genres, formats, and program ideas from diverse sources – the Dutch Big Brother, British Pop Idol, and Hong Kong action flicks. Thus, the quintessentially American center of information technology, Silicon Valley, has a huge component of Asian scientists and entrepreneurs. With open borders, the United States has become the largest consumer market for information and communication, as well as the most successful\n\nIs Cultural Diversity Under Threat?\n\n21\n\nexporter of cultural products and services. But like the popularity of Chicago pizza, Amsterdam rijsttafel, or London chicken tikka masala, the cultural goods that emerge are neither wholly indigenous to each country nor wholly foreign, but a fusion. Thus, McDonald’s itself now offers croissants and Asian noodles. Pushed to the extreme, there is no such thing as cultural authenticity; rather, there are a variety of creative m´elanges drawn from diverse sources.51 Important regional markets have also emerged, facilitating local exchanges and counterflows, such as Bollywood films in South Asia, Mexico and Brazilian popular TV in Latin America, Chinese video software on Wal-Mart shelves, and South Korean television dramas broadcast in other Asian countries. International Web sites, advertising messages, consumer products, and newspapers are other examples of cross-border goods and services that are tailored to fit local markets and interests. Fusion can occur because global media companies adapt their products to local communities, using indigenous images and accents to sell imported brands. National media companies may also import but then adapt global products, dubbing feature films into domestic languages or adding subtitles. And audiences may transform imported cultural products by adapting them to local needs and conditions.52 Understanding these issues is complicated by the fact that diverse reactions to the same phenomena may be occurring simultaneously among different social sectors; for example, the affluent and educated urban elite living in developing countries may come to share similar ideas and attitudes with their counterparts living in Europe or North America due to the spread of mass communications, while at the same time this process may generate greater polarization between elites and more conservative groups living in traditional rural communities in the same societies. Plan of the Book Part I In the light of this debate, the next chapter outlines the firewall theory at the heart of this book, identifies the core testable empirical propositions that flow from our theory, explains the book’s research design, and outlines the sources of evidence. Chapter 3 examines the international market for cultural goods and services, including the\n\n22\n\nIntroduction\n\nvolume and direction of exports and imports across national borders, as well as trends over time. We analyze evidence for the trade in audiovisual services, the flow of news information, and the role of new information and communication technologies. We demonstrate that cultural exchange is more commonplace among core societies, based mainly in the global North, that have rich and dense networks of connectivity. By contrast, peripheral societies, which are not as closely connected, are heavily concentrated in the global South. The evidence demonstrates the leading share of the international market in cultural trade held by the United States – and the way that this share has grown, not shrunk, in recent years. But the chapter also demonstrates the limits of trade integration for poor societies. Chapter 4 investigates the extent to which deep-rooted poverty and lack of economic development remain major barriers to accessing the mass media; to this end, it examines the regular use of newspapers and magazines, television and radio broadcasts, and the Internet or e-mail. The chapter also looks at how this usage varies among and within societies worldwide. The comparative framework focuses on some of the leading media-saturated postindustrial countries, such as the United States, Sweden, Germany, and Japan; some middle-income nations and emerging economies, such as Brazil, India, and China, where public access to all forms of electronic and printed communications has been rapidly growing; as well as some of the least developed societies, where isolated rural communities have minimal access to the news media, such as Burkina Faso, Rwanda, and Ethiopia. There are also substantial disparities in the use of news between the informationrich and -poor within countries. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have spread most widely among more affluent households in high- and middle-income countries, but substantial gaps in media access remain, not simply in new ICTs. Evidence from international statistics gathered by UNESCO, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), and related agencies enables us to compare the patterns of access around the world and to consider whether the digital divide has gradually closed over time. The WVS helps to monitor patterns of mass communications at the individual level and to explain the underlying reasons for disparities in access. Case studies from Mali and South Africa illustrate the contrasts in greater depth.\n\nIs Cultural Diversity Under Threat?\n\n23\n\nChapter 5 compares and classifies societies worldwide using a new Cosmopolitanism Index based on identifying the external and internal barriers to the free flow of information. The most cosmopolitan societies, such as Denmark, Estonia, and Switzerland, are characterized by widespread public access to multiple media channels and sources, limited trade barriers to cultural imports, and few major restrictions on the independence of journalists and broadcasters. These societies are at the forefront of the globalization process and are integrated with many other countries through strong communication, economic, and political networks. Certain emerging economies and developing nations, such as the Czech Republic, South Africa, and Argentina, are increasingly integrated into cosmopolitan networks. By contrast, in provincial societies, such as Burma, Iran, Syria, and Vietnam, the state continues to exert considerable control over news and public affairs, restricting both cultural imports and freedom of the press. These countries are also poorly integrated into global markets in trade and communication networks, and the public has restricted access to mass communications. Provincial societies also include emerging economies such as China and Russia, which are integrated with world trade markets but restrict information flows at home. Other cases, such as Mali, Indonesia, and Ghana, are newer democracies with considerable media freedom but with relatively weak integration into global markets and communication networks, underdeveloped communication infrastructures, and relatively limited public access to the mass media. We classify the societies in the countries under comparison according to the Cosmopolitanism Index and illustrate the typology with selected case studies. Part II The second part of the book tests the firewall theory. This theory predicts that individual use of the news media will have a direct effect on individual values. In addition, it predicts that a cross-level interaction effect will also be apparent, as external and internal barriers to information flows in each society will interact with individual patterns of news media use. In particular, the theory predicts that, in the most cosmopolitan societies, even after other social characteristics are controlled for, people who are most regularly exposed to information from the media will differ significantly from those who remain more isolated\n\n24\n\nIntroduction\n\nfrom mass communications. Our study tests the impact of exposure to the mass media on the strength of national identities and cosmopolitan orientations; values and attitudes toward markets and the state; orientations toward religion, gender equality, and traditional standards of morality; and attitudes toward democracy, self-expression values, and human rights. In all cases, other individual-level characteristics associated with use of the media, including education, income, gender, and age, are controlled for. Chapter 6 opens this part of the book by examining whether those most exposed to news and information are less nationalistic and more cosmopolitan in their orientations than others, as expected, and how this pattern varies in open and closed societies. Commentators such as Anthony Giddens have argued that globalization is leading to the ‘end of the nation state.’53 Regular exposure to more information about other societies and the world via the news media should contribute to this process. Yet skeptics doubt whether identification with the nation-state has been seriously weakened among the mass public, even in the European Union, and whether an emerging ‘cosmopolitan identity’ is sufficiently powerful to replace the visceral tribal appeals of nationalism. In Anthony Smith’s view, for example, we are witnessing the growth of regional blocs, where nation-states remain the primary actors, not the emergence of a new world order that transcends states.54 To consider these issues, this chapter examines whether regular users of the news media differ significantly in the strength of their national identities, support for the organizations of global governance, and attitudes toward national or multilateral solutions to policy problems. Chapter 7 explores the impact of the news media on attitudes toward the free market and the role of government intervention in the management of the economy. This issue is particularly important for the former Communist states and Latin American societies that have followed the policies of the Washington consensus, deregulating and privatizing the public sector, liberalizing trade, and shrinking the role of the state. Mass communications are expected to have encouraged support for economic liberalism by emphasizing mass consumerism, individualism, and capitalism, especially through advertising as well as through the values conveyed by popular entertainment and financial news exported from affluent postindustrial societies. A body of research has explored factors leading to public support for free trade\n\nIs Cultural Diversity Under Threat?\n\n25\n\nand economic integration.55 This chapter goes further to examine the role of mass communications in this process, in particular whether those groups that do and do not regularly use the news media display distinctive economic values that underly preferences concerning the role of markets and the state. Chapter 8 examines whether media users have distinctive orientations toward traditional moral values and religion. Previous work by the authors has demonstrated a consistent gap between postindustrial and developing societies in traditional moral values, attitudes toward marriage and divorce, tolerance of homosexuality, and support for gender equality in the roles of men and women.56 A wealth of evidence from the WVS also demonstrates that rich and poor societies differ substantially in patterns of religious values and practices.57 What is the impact of mass communications on these processes? The convergence thesis suggests that popular entertainment or news information reflecting Western values, when imported into traditional cultures, will probably accelerate the process of value change – for example, by encouraging greater tolerance of sexual liberalization and more secular behavior. Alternatively, the polarizing thesis reflects the views of other commentators who argue that Western popular entertainment has generated a backlash in developing societies, particularly in the highly conservative Arab states, by emphasizing explicit sexuality, gratuitous violence, consumerism, and a celebrity culture; denigrating respect for historical traditions, established customs, and religious authorities; and undermining the importance of family, marriage, and honor. From this perspective, the spread of the global media may have contributed to culture wars. Chapter 8 explores the empirical evidence for these arguments by contrasting the groups on the basis of their use of mass communications. Chapter 9 analyzes support for democratic ideals, self-expression values, and human rights. The logic of the convergence view is that greater familiarity with democratic practices and human rights as conveyed by the media will result in the spread of these ideas, thereby encouraging reform movements and human rights activists in previously closed societies and autocratic regimes. Access to international news and information about democratic societies abroad should be a particularly potent mechanism for spreading demands for political rights and civil liberties at home. At the same time, where the news\n\n26\n\nIntroduction\n\nmedia are largely controlled by powerful governing elites, or through state ownership of broadcasting, overt censorship, intimidation of independent journalists, or related mechanisms, mass communications can be used as a mechanism of state control and propaganda. We examine the evidence for these claims and attempt to determine whether those with and without access to mass communications, who live in countries ruled by very different regimes, such as Russia, Ukraine, and Poland, differ in their political orientations and support for the regime. In Chapter 10, utilizing aggregate indicators to classify more than 90 societies in terms of the Cosmopolitanism Index, we examine the degree to which cultures actually have converged over time. The WVS has been conducted in five waves since the early 1980s, and by comparing trends over time in selected attitudinal indicators we can test whether national cultures have gradually converged in the most cosmopolitan societies. Finally, Chapter 11 summarizes the main results and considers the consequences for understanding theories about the impact of mass communications on cultural diversity, as well as the broader implications for cultural policy. Proponents of the globalization of mass communications regard it as a potential means of strengthening awareness about other countries and promoting international understanding around the world, as well as spreading the principles and practices of democratic governance and human rights. They advocate neoliberal free market policies that dismantle trade restrictions, cut tariff barriers, and loosen media ownership regulations in order to maximize the free flow of information and trade across national borders. Critics who view this process with alarm see cultural diversity under threat, due especially to the predominance of American or Western multinational corporations in audiovisual trade. They favor protectionist cultural trade policies, including the use of tariffs and quotas to regulate and limit the import of audiovisual services, and subsidies designed to preserve domestic creative industries and cultural pluralism. Protectionist sentiments are strongest in developing nations, as exemplified by debates within UNESCO, but they can also be found among affluent postindustrial societies; the European Union, for example, remains divided between those member states favoring more competitive markets within Europe and others, led by the French, seeking to protect\n\nIs Cultural Diversity Under Threat?\n\n27\n\nEurope’s creative economy against the Americanization of popular culture.58 There are also deep divisions over these issues among theorists in the social sciences. Chapter 11 discusses whether interventions designed to protect national cultures against foreign influences are appropriate, or whether the free flow of information and the maintenance of open borders are more desirable policies.\n\n2 Theoretical Framework\n\nMany voices can be heard in the dispute over the consequences of cosmopolitan communications. The empirical evidence on this issue remains mixed; the results are inconclusive, and there are plausible counterclaims to each argument. The popular debate is based largely on theoretical speculation about the possible consequences of the widely observed structural and economic changes in the production and distribution of mass communications, rather than on a careful empirical examination of how public opinion is actually changing in the light of survey evidence. As in Bhutan, the people in developing societies exposed to imported American or Western television, movies, and news often encounter values, practices, and ways of life that conflict with those traditionally found at home. But it remains unclear from the existing research whether, and under what conditions, this process erodes traditional aspects of distinctive national cultures. Do cosmopolitan communications accelerate the assimilation of modern values in traditional societies, as argued by the convergence thesis? Or do they trigger a backlash among those who feel most threatened by this process, as the polarization thesis proposes? Do they produce a fusion culture, with strands borrowed from different places and societies? Or as the firewall model suggests, are deeply rooted attitudes and values relatively robust in the face of mass communication flows? At this point, the answers to these questions are not clear. The evidence thus deserves rigorous scrutiny.\n\n28\n\nTheoretical Framework\n\n29\n\nThis chapter explains the theory at the heart of this book, the testable empirical hypotheses derived from this argument, and the research strategy for analyzing the core propositions. Our research design is simple to explain. To examine the direct effect of media use on social values, as a first step we use individual-level survey evidence to analyze the attitudes and values of representative samples of citizens, comparing those who do and do not regularly use the mass media and controlling for many other characteristics of the audience. The individual-level comparisons focus on the potential impact of media exposure on national identities, the economic values of consumer capitalism, traditional moral values concerning sexuality and gender equality, and support for democracy and human rights. But our theory suggests that the effect of media use will differ for those living in cosmopolitan societies and those living in provincial societies. We develop a Cosmopolitanism Index based on the extent of internal and external barriers to cross-border information flows. We then apply this to classify the 90 countries included in the World Values Survey. Hierarchical linear models, in particular multilevel regression analyses, are used to disentangle the impact of societal-level media environments, individual-level social characteristics, and cross-level interaction effects. In addition, we examine longitudinal evidence of the degree of cultural change over time, comparing the impact of global media on cosmopolitan and parochial societies. Finally, selected qualitative case studies, contrasting countries with relatively similar cultural traditions and levels of development but with differing media environments, illustrate the core findings in greater depth. Theoretical Framework: The Firewall Model The scenarios we outlined in the preceding chapter differ sharply in how they depict the future; but they all focus on developments in the structure and ownership of the media industry, changes in international trade in cultural markets, and the accelerated pace and volume of crossborder information flows. They all assume that the expanded volume of cultural imports from major producer countries will have a strong and direct impact on the domestic audience, for good or ill, by altering indigenous national values and beliefs. In this regard, although the\n\n30\n\nIntroduction\n\nalternative perspectives appear to differ, in fact they actually share remarkably similar premises. All are rooted in an implicit belief in powerful media effects, and they diverge only in the predicted direction of change. We challenge these popular views and argue that more nuanced claims about the way that the public responds to cosmopolitan communications would be more realistic. Our theory suggests that national cultures remain diverse and relatively enduring. In particular, the firewall model presented in this book implies that the impact of cosmopolitan communications on national cultures is moderated by a series of intervening conditions. At the societal level, the degree of trade integration determines whether countries are incorporated into global markets. The level of media freedom influences the availability of news and information within any country. And levels of economic development shape investment in modern communication infrastructures and thus access to the mass media. These factors are closely interrelated, so they are used to develop a Cosmopolitanism Index, which is defined, operationalized, and then applied to classify countries around the world. Moreover, within each society, two further important firewalls operate primarily at the individual level, namely poverty, whereby a lack of socioeconomic resources and skills hinders access to mass communications, and social psychological learning processes, reflecting the socialization filters involved in the acquisition and transmission of core attitudes and enduring values. This framework, understood to be a sequential process, is illustrated schematically in Figure 2.1. These firewalls, individually and in combination, help protect national cultural diversity from foreign influences. The mass media do have important effects – as we shall demonstrate – but the consequences of cosmopolitan communications seem to be more limited than usually assumed. Trade Integration: Barriers to Cultural Markets We accept that the world market for the trade of cultural goods, news information, and audiovisual services has expanded dramatically in volume, pace, and reach in recent decades. Chapter 3 examines trends in the market for cultural goods and services around the world since the early 1970s. We analyze three dimensions of this phenomenon: the cultural trade of audiovisual services (television programs, feature films, and recorded music); the news flow arising through printed newspapers\n\n31\n\nfigure 2.1.

The expanded pace of transborder information flows is due to many factors, including the growing diffusion of information and communication technologies, notably radio, satellite TV, and the Internet, as well as reductions in trade barriers among nations and the role of transnational media corporations.1 Although some intangible aspects of this development cannot be reduced to dollars and cents, as one indicator, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) estimated that global trade in creative goods and services almost doubled in value during the past decade alone.2 The strongest potential influence from cosmopolitan communications occurs if the market for cultural goods and services is produced and exported primarily by multimedia production companies based in Western postindustrial nations – especially America – and if these products are imported into societies with divergent cultural values. The evidence presented in Chapter 3 confirms the concentration of production in cultural trade. American-based or Western-based multinational corporations dominate the ownership, production, marketing, and dissemination of audiovisual products and news information sources that are widely exchanged on international markets, including films, television programs, music, transnational satellite news stations, news wire services, and related cultural products and services. Far from decreasing, the audiovisual trade of the United States, the leading exporter in this market, has expanded in recent decades. Among the leading media groups worldwide, for example, ranked by audiovisual turnover, 7 of the top 10 are based in the United States: Walt Disney, Time Warner, News Corporation, NBC Universal, the DirecTV Group, CBS Corporation, and Viacom.3 Other important producer nations include Britain, Germany, Canada, and France, each with large domestic markets, as well as a major slice of world exports among networks of trade partners. With a few exceptions, such as Bollywood in South Asia, Nollywood in Nigeria, and Mexican telenovelas in Latin America, smaller audiovisual industries based in developing societies often lack the infrastructure and resources to compete effectively with the production values required to manufacture and sell cultural products in\n\nTheoretical Framework\n\n33\n\nthe world market. Coproductions help, but once-flourishing film industries in many countries, such as Russia and Italy, are now struggling to attract sufficient investment in production, distribution, and marketing and to recoup costs through overseas sales.4 The economic and organizational structure of the mass media as an industry has been transformed in recent decades by the deregulation and privatization of state and public service broadcasting, which has greatly increased the number of commercial television and radio channels available in many societies, and by the rise of the Internet and multimedia digital technologies. Greater competition among multiple privately owned television channels swept away the traditional monopolies that used to exist in many countries having state-controlled or public service broadcasters. Since the early 1990s, in many societies, one or two TV channels have often been replaced by dozens.5 The deregulation of broadcasting generated a flood of new television commercial or privately owned stations, which typically often seek to fill hours of broadcasting by programming low-cost imported popular entertainment, with endless reruns of American TV sitcoms and drama series, Hollywood movies, animation, popular music, and reality or game shows, with advertising messages reflecting consumer values.6 In countries with a limited domestic market, lacking the capacity or finances to generate their own programs, this expansion fueled the demand for imported TV. Public service television and radio have come under growing pressure to adapt to this new media landscape and to justify their role and subsidy, given the range of alternative choices available to the audience.7 In addition to these transformations in the broadcasting landscape, as shown in Chapter 3, transnational news channels such as CNN International and BBC World are now widely available in many parts of the globe; U.S.- and Europeanbased news wire services – Reuters, the Associated Press, and Agence France-Presse – continue to be the predominant sources of international news for many media outlets worldwide; Hollywood retains its predominance in the international movie market; and foreign ownership of newspapers and magazines has increased in recent decades.8 New information from Web sites and the Internet has opened the floodgates further and expanded the cultural role of major software corporations and Web sites, also based in the United States, exemplified by Microsoft, Google, and YouTube.\n\n34\n\nIntroduction\n\nAt the same time, it is necessary to qualify the overly simple view that the transfer of cultural goods and service flows one way, from the global North (or the United States) to South. First, as the fusion thesis emphasizes, the market for producing and distributing cultural goods remains complex, and regional hubs are emerging for specific sectors in certain middle-income economies, such as India, Mexico, China, and Brazil. The rapid growth of major emerging economies, and the shift from agriculture to manufacturing and the service sector, are expected to increase the capacity of these countries to produce and export audiovisual goods to other nations with shared languages and cultural ties. Moreover, many of the most successful American-produced TV programs reflect genres that originated elsewhere, whether Big Brother, Pop Idol, The Office, or Survivor, with local spin-offs popular in many countries, so that, as with American pizza, tacos, or hot dogs, it is increasingly difficult to identify what is distinctively ‘American’ about these cultural products. Equally important, the integration of economies into world markets, along with trade in cultural goods and services in the creative economy, remains far from equal around the globe. Many of the least developed nations are largely excluded from world markets, functioning neither as producers nor as major consumers of cultural goods and services. Lack of development among low-income societies, ironically, counteracts the impact of global communications on national cultures.9 The poorest societies have not yet developed the mass markets that sustain foreign investment in their broadcasting, telecommunication, and publishing infrastructures. External barriers to the flow of information across national borders arise from multiple sources, including protectionist trade policies, tariffs, and broadcasting regulations – for example, governing foreign and domestic media ownership, imports, standards, copyrighting, intellectual property, licensing, and contents. States can also intervene actively by subsidizing domestic industries – for example, by leveling license fees for state-controlled and public service broadcasting, providing financial assistance for the performing arts, or offering tax breaks to reduce the cost of newsprint or newspaper distribution. The strictest protectionist trade barriers are imposed in closed societies, such as Cuba, Uzbekistan, Saudi Arabia, and Burma, but it should not be thought that these practices are confined to autocratic regimes, by any means, as many\n\nTheoretical Framework\n\n35\n\ndemocracies also seek to protect and subsidize their national cultural industries. Poverty and Development: Access to Mass Communications In recent decades, technological innovations have transformed access to interpersonal and mass communications throughout many parts of the world. This social revolution accelerated after the emergence of innovative digital technologies in the mid-1990s, from the personal computer (PC) and Internet to data-accessible smart mobile cell phones. But these changes have had the greatest impact in affluent postindustrial nations, especially among affluent households and the young tech-savvy generation, and, to a lesser extent, in many middleincome emerging market economies such as South Korea, Taiwan, South Africa, and Brazil. A substantial digital divide remains today, preventing poor segments of the population within affluent societies, as well as many of the world’s least developed countries, from gaining access to traditional mass media, as well as to new digital information and communication technologies. The extent of these disparities, documented in detail in Chapter 4, is often underestimated by observers based in media-rich nations. Television penetration illustrates these disparities; for example, UNESCO estimates that worldwide, only about one-quarter of all households have a television set today.10 TV penetration has reached saturation levels in advanced industrialized societies; almost all households in these countries (97%) have a TV set. Emerging economies such as Turkey, China, and Mexico have made rapid gains in acquiring these consumer durables; about 84% of all households in lower-middleincome societies have TVs, up by 20% from the preceding decade. By contrast, among low-income societies, on average only 15% of all households have a TV set, and even today less than 5% of homes have access to TVs in countries such as Uganda, Burma, Rwanda, and Ethiopia. Radios are far more widely available in poor nations, reaching more than 40% of all households worldwide. Community radio is a particularly important source of local information, music, and news in many developing societies. Innovative low-cost windup and solar-powered radios reduce the need for batteries. Another important trend has been the rapid spread of mobile cellular telephones, with access soaring in developing nations from 3.2% of people subscribing\n\n36\n\nIntroduction\n\nin 1999 to up to one-third (32.4%) in 2006.11 Fixed telephone lines almost doubled in developing societies during the same period, from 7.6 to 13.9%. Growing levels of literacy and primary schooling, the latter prioritized as one of the key UN Millennium Development Goals, has also expanded the market for newspapers, books, and magazines in many poor nations. Recent years have seen the dramatic growth of digital information and communication technologies associated with the rise of computers and the Internet, facilitating the use of text messaging, e-mail, and Web sites, which diffused even further through smart cellular mobile phones and communal technology kiosks. Chapter 4 demonstrates that, despite these developments, the gap between rich and poor nations in terms of access to all major forms of information and communication resources remains substantial, as does the digital divide within societies.12 The World Bank estimates that in 2005 there were more than 10 times as many mobile telephone subscribers in high-income countries as there were in low-income countries. While television sets are present in almost all households in Europe and the United States, only one in seven households has a TV in low-income nations.13 In 2006, less than 5 of every 100 Africans used the Internet, compared with an average of 50% among the inhabitants of the G8 countries.14 In developing societies, access to printed media (daily newspapers, magazines, and books) is limited by enduring problems of illiteracy and the cost of these products, as well as by language barriers. All these factors combine to generate severe information poverty in poor nations, making these societies and especially their rural populations increasingly peripheral to communication networks.15 The least developed and poorest countries are often the ones that are most isolated from modern ICTs, and thus cut off from the knowledge economy, without the telecommunication infrastructure needed for landline telephones in many homes and businesses. Many rural areas in these societies lack a regular supply of electricity, and where reliable power is available, limited access to television sets and computers restricts connectivity via television and the Internet. Community radio remains a vital source of information in poor areas, and the spread of access to mobile cellular technologies in rural villages has been an important development. But in many poor societies, access to mediated news and information from television, national daily newspapers, and the Internet and World Wide Web remains\n\nTheoretical Framework\n\n37\n\nlimited. Unless access to these technologies becomes widespread in developing countries, mass communications may reach the affluent and educated elite living in urban areas, but it will fail to penetrate the national culture directly. It is not clear how Western cultural imperialism can wipe out cultural diversity in poor societies such as Ethiopia, Mali, and Burkina Faso, where much of the rural and illiterate population has little or no regular access to newspapers, television, or movies, let alone the Internet. The impact of individual learning from cross-border news information may be significant, but if exposure is confined to a small group of elites – for example, if CNN International is watched only by diplomats, government officials, and the expatriate community, this process will not have a direct impact on the general public or the collective national culture. Freedom: Internal Barriers to Information In addition to the external barriers, limits on freedom of the press restrict access to information internally within any society, just as open markets are limited by tariffs, taxes, and import quotas that protect commercial trade. It is not clear how cultural imperialism can exert a strong impact in places such as Burma, Uzbekistan, or North Korea, where the regimes use a variety of techniques to deny citizens access to foreign news organizations and to rigidly control information flows (inward and outward) across their national borders. The Chinese suppression of news about the Tibetan uprisings in March 2008 and the Burmese military junta’s strict control of information about the devastating cyclone Nargis a few months later exemplify these practices. Even in liberal countries, such as those in the European Union, there are regulations restricting the import of non-European entertainment. Internal restrictions on information flows arise from limits on freedom of the press, including laws governing freedom of expression and information (such as penalties for press offenses); patterns of intimidation and violations of press freedom affecting journalists and the mass media (such as imprisonment and harassment of reporters); and the nature of state intervention in the media (such as state monopolies of broadcasting or the use of official censorship). The relationship between the state and the news media in any society is important and is shaped by issues of ownership, regulation, and control. In the most cosmopolitan media environments, such as those of India, Canada, and\n\n38\n\nIntroduction\n\nthe Netherlands, there are open markets, deregulation of telecommunications, and freedom of information concerning what is broadcast, published, or transmitted. By contrast, protectionist barriers are far stronger in restrictive communication systems, characterized by policies ranging from state control of the newspaper and broadcasting sectors, overt government censorship, stringent import controls, and repression of foreign news, at one extreme, to less draconian restrictions on foreign ownership of the mass media and protectionist policies regulating what can be imported and distributed, at the other. Chapter 5 develops the Cosmopolitanism Index at the societal level, representing the permeability of nations to cross-border information flows, and operationalizes this according to a society’s participation in global markets, level of economic development, and freedom of the press. This index is applied in order to classify all the countries under comparison and is illustrated with case studies. Learning: Individual Social Psychological Barriers to Learning The cultural convergence thesis assumes that as audiences in different societies become more exposed to imported music and television programs, foreign movies, and Internet Web sites, they gradually absorb and emulate the modern ideas, images, and values embedded in these products, which eventually results in the erosion of national diversity. We suggest that these arguments underestimate the external barriers to cultural trade across national borders, the lack of internal freedom of the press found in many societies, and the significant developmental restrictions on public access to communication technologies, all of which limit the direct impact of cross-border information flows. But let us ignore these barriers for the moment, on the reasonable grounds that freedom of information and open borders for cultural trade have gradually been gaining hold in many countries, accompanied by the growth of democracy and civil liberties and compounded by the difficulties of controlling digital information. Over time, public access to mass communication technologies is gradually becoming more widespread, even in the poo"
