This is why we are committed to providing best-in-class customer service, while promoting open, honest communication at all levels.\n\nOur executive team and all employees must adhere to GM Financial’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Our Code outlines the principles by which all team members conduct business with customers, suppliers and each other. These principles apply to all GM Financial team members and affiliates and although it does not cover every issue that may arise, the Code provides guidelines for all employees in regard to their business conduct.\n\nFor a deeper understanding of expectations and guidelines set forth for the entire GM Financial team, please review GM Financial’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics policies below.\n\n[PDF] GM Financial Code of Ethical Conduct for Senior Financial Officers\n\nInside Track\n\nTo learn how our business works, download Inside Track, a roadmap to understanding GM Financial’s primary operations.
