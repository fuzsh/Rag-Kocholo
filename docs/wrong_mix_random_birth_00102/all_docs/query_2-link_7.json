Delivered to your inbox — completely free.\n\nA subsidiary of Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn is laying off 115 employees in Fort Worth, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice.\n\nThe layoffs start July 21 and will affect employees at S&B Industries Inc. at 13301 Park Vista Blvd. near the Alliance area in North Fort Worth, according to the notice.\n\nS&B Industries Inc. refurbishes mobile electronics. Foxconn is the world’s largest electronics maker – it makes products for companies such as Apple. The layoffs will affect manufacturing operators, line leads, manufacturing engineers and quality engineers.\n\nJean Chang, HR director for S&B, said the layoffs are a result of losing customers.\n\n“Some key customers are making the decision to downsize business with S&B,” Chang wrote in the WARN letter.\n\nThere have been 1,961 layoffs in Tarrant County reported to the state this year, surpassing 2022 numbers.\n\nThe manufacturing sector is seeing slowing growth after a boost of orders during the COVID-19 pandemic. New orders have been on the decline for several months.\n\nEmployees may be able to transfer to a different location “depending on business need,” according to the letter.\n\nSeth Bodine is a business and economic development reporter for the Fort Worth Report.
