        "text": "- Announces Closing of Dyna Ten Corporation Acquisition -\n\nHOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 1, 2014-- Comfort Systems USA, Inc. (NYSE: FIX), a leading provider of commercial, industrial and institutional heating, ventilation and air conditioning (“HVAC”) services, today announced that it has closed its previously announced transaction to acquire Dyna Ten Corporation (“Dyna Ten”) headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas.\n\nDyna Ten is a regional mechanical contractor based in Fort Worth, Texas. Dyna Ten engages in a broad range of mechanical contracting projects, HVAC service and controls, in the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex and in surrounding areas.\n\nBrian Lane, Comfort Systems USA’s Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We are extremely happy to announce the closing of the Dyna Ten acquisition, extending our family of companies to the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex. We believe that Dyna Ten is the premier mechanical contractor in north Texas, providing extraordinary outcomes for its customers in the medical, industrial and commercial markets. Dyna Ten brings an established reputation for innovation and excellence, and we believe that they will greatly improve our customer offering throughout Texas.”\n\nMark Nyquist, the Chief Executive Officer of Dyna Ten Corporation, commented, “We are happy to bring the additional resources and opportunities that Comfort Systems USA represents to our customers and our employees, and we are confident and committed to contributing to the Comfort Systems USA team. Comfort Systems USA is the ideal partner for our organization because it shares our core beliefs, including customer value, innovation and employee growth and opportunity.”\n\nDyna Ten has annualized revenues of approximately $70 million to $80 million at profitability levels that are generally equal to or above those currently experienced by Comfort Systems USA operations. In light of the required amortization expense related to intangibles and other costs associated with the transaction, the acquisition is expected to make a neutral to slightly accretive contribution to earnings per share during the first 12 to 18 months after the acquisition.\n\nComfort Systems USA® is a premier provider of business solutions addressing workplace comfort, with 89 locations in 81 cities around the nation.

The words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “intend,” “foresee,” “should,” “would,” “could,” or other similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, which are generally not historic in nature. These forward-looking statements are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Comfort Systems USA, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) concerning future developments and their effect on the Company. While the Company’s management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made, there can be no assurance that future developments affecting the Company will be those that it anticipates. All comments concerning the Company’s expectations for future revenues and operating results are based on the Company’s forecasts for its existing operations and do not include the potential impact of any future acquisitions. The Company’s forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties (some of which are beyond the Company’s control) and assumptions that could cause actual future results to differ materially from the Company’s historical experience and its present expectations or projections. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: the use of incorrect estimates for bidding a fixed-price contract; undertaking contractual commitments that exceed the Company’s labor resources; failing to perform contractual obligations efficiently enough to maintain profitability; national or regional weakness in construction activity and economic conditions; financial difficulties affecting projects, vendors, customers, or subcontractors; the Company’s backlog failing to translate into actual revenue or profits; failure of third party subcontractors and suppliers to complete work as anticipated; difficulty in obtaining or increased costs associated with bonding and insurance; impairment to goodwill; errors in the Company’s percentage-of-completion method of accounting; the result of competition in the Company’s markets; the Company’s decentralized management structure; material failure to comply with varying state and local laws, regulations or requirements; debarment from bidding on or performing government contracts; shortages of labor and specialty building materials; retention of key management; seasonal fluctuations in the demand for HVAC systems; the imposition of past and future liability from environmental, safety, and health regulations including the inherent risk associated with self-insurance; adverse litigation results; an increase in our effective tax rate; a cyber security breach; and other risks detailed in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nFor additional information regarding known material factors that could cause the Company’s results to differ from its projected results, please see its filings with the SEC, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and Current Reports on Form 8-K.\n\nReaders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\n\nSource: Comfort Systems USA, Inc."
