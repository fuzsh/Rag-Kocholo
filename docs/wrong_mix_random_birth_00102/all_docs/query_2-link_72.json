        "text": "Fort Worth Alliance Airport is a city-owned public-use airport located 14 miles (23 km) north of the central business district of Fort Worth, city in Tarrant County, Texas, United States.\n\nBilled as the world’s first purely industrial airport, it was developed in a joint venture between the City of Fort Worth, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the Hillwood Development Company, a real estate development company owned by Ross Perot, Jr.\n\nThe official groundbreaking ceremonies were held in July 1988, and the airport officially opened on December 14, 1989. The airport is owned by the City of Fort Worth and managed by Alliance Air Services, a subsidiary of Hillwood Development, and is the second largest airport facility in North Texas, behind only Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW).\n\nBesides general aviation services, the airport serves as the Southwest Regional Hub for Fedex Express. It formerly served as a maintenance hub for DFW-based American Airlines, until the bankruptcy filing and subsequent restructuring of its parent AMR Corporation.\n\nBy the 1990s, the annual passenger air traffic at DFW International Airport had exceeded the airport’s capacity, and a solution was proposed to repeal the Wright Amendment and open Alliance Airport to passenger service, effectively providing DFW with two reliever airports (the other being Dallas Love Field). But DFW opposed the solution and no passenger service was introduced at Alliance Airport.\n\nAlliance Airport"
