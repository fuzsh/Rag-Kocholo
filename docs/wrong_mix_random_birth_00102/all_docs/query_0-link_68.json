        "text": "An isotopic study of granitoids in the Litchfield Block, Northern Territory\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nPage, R.W.; Bower, M.J.; Guy, D.B.\n\n1984-01-01\n\nThe Litchfield Block contains a variety of granitoids, gneissic rocks, and migmatites that are intrusive into metasediments of probable Early Proterozoic age at the western margin of the Pine Creek Inlier. Isotopic data, which include U-Pb measurements on cogenetic zircon and xenotime and Rb-Sr total-rock measurements on the least metamorphosed granodiorites, show that these rocks crystallised from mantle-derived melts between 1840 Ma and 1850 Ma ago. Radiogenic Pb was lost from zircon in the early Palaeozoic (about 435 Ma), but xenotime remained a closed system until recent time. Many granitoids in the Litchfield Block have a gneissic fabric imposed during greenschist to amphibolite-grade regional metamorphism. This disturbance allowed partial isotopic re-equilibration of Rb-Sr total-rock systems, at about 1770 +- 16 Ma. As this igneous and metamorphic evolution is mirrored in other parts of the Pine Creek Inlier, the Halls Creek Inlier, and many other orogenic belts in northern Australia, its recognition and isotopic definition in the Litchfield Block further emphasise the magnitude and chronological integrity of this early Proterozoic tectonic event\n\nThe Book of Ruth in the time of the Judges and Ruth, the Moabitess\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nGerda de Villiers\n\n2016-03-01\n\nFull Text Available This article addresses two issues in the Book of Ruth that have not yet received much scholarly attention: why is the narrative plotted in the time of the judges, whilst the time of narration dates to the postexilic period, and why is one of the protagonists Ruth, the Moabitess, whilst the law in Deuteronomy 23:3ï¿½4 (HB 4ï¿½5 clearly forbids the presence of Moabitess and Ammonites in the community of YHWH? A suggestion is made that a possible explanation to both these questions may be found in tensions regarding Israelï¿½s identity in the Second Temple period. Two different yet not completely opposite viewpoints are illuminated: that of the Books of Ezra and Nehemiah who envisioned an exclusive Israel that is construed along genealogical and religious lines, and that of the Book of Ruth where solidarity with the people of Israel and the worship of YHWH are embraced by foreigners. Both sides are concerned about the identity of Israel and loyalty to YHWH, yet they employ a different jargon in order to argue for the inclusion or exclusion of foreigners. Furthermore, Ezra and Nehemiah consider mixed marriages as a serious threat to Israelï¿½s identity, and they justify the expulsion of foreign wives on the basis of the Book of Moses. According to the Book of Deuteronomy, Moses interpreted the Torah for the children of Israel at Mount Nebo in Moab: Moab thus functioned as an interpretive space for the Torah. The Book of Ruth proposes an alternative interpretation of the Torah, also from the plains of Moab and the exegesis comes in the person of Ruth, the Moabitess.Intradisciplinary and/or interdisciplinary implications: This article challenges the point of view that the Book of Ruth is a charming narrative of loyalty and love. Research reveals that this Book is a polemic document and its main contribution is to the intradisciplinary field of biblical hermeneutics that requests a re-interpretation of texts for changing circumstances.\n\nAn automated approach to Litchfield and Wilcoxon's evaluation of doseâeffect experiments using the R package LW1949\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAdams, Jean V.; Slaght, Karen; Boogaard, Michael A.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe authors developed a package, LW1949, for use with the statistical software R to automatically carry out the manual steps of Litchfield and Wilcoxon's method of evaluating doseâeffect experiments. The LW1949 package consistently finds the best fitting doseâeffect relation by minimizing the chi-squared statistic of the observed and expected number of affected individuals and substantially speeds up the line-fitting process and other calculations that Litchfield and Wilcoxon originally carried out by hand.Â Environ Toxicol ChemÂ 2016;9999:1â4.

Data from PulseNet, the national molecular subtyping network for foodborne disease surveillance, confirmed 11 cases (including the three from Pennsylvania) of this rarely identified Salmonella serotype in five states during a 5-week period; seven of the 11 patients had reported recent travel history to Atlantic City, New Jersey. This report describes the subsequent investigation led by NJDHSS and the Atlantic City Health Department (ACHD), which associated the outbreak with a hotel restaurant in Atlantic City. In all, 30 confirmed or probable cases of illness with S. Litchfield infection were identified among persons from eight states who had eaten at the hotel restaurant, including 10 restaurant food handlers. Investigators concluded that the outbreak most likely was associated with fruit salad, particularly the honeydew melon component, and that contamination likely resulted from an ill food handler. This investigation illustrates the potential for recurring food contamination by ill and asymptomatic food handlers and underscores the utility of PulseNet to link illnesses that might appear unrelated.\n\nAnalisa Kelayakan Teknis dan Finansial pada Proyek Apartemen Dian Regency Surabaya\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLeonardo Andos Roganda L.

It investigates the ways in which the\\\\ud use of a pseudonym allows her to delve deeper into areas that she also explores as Rendell â the dysfunctional family and heredity, both in relation to physical disease and the fruitless search for origins, the latter discussed by her through the lens of Freudian psychoanalysis.\n\nLeadership Characters in the Book of Ruth: A Narrative Analysis\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nYong Lu\n\n2017-06-01\n\nFull Text Available This article delineates a ground work for shaping Christian leadership characters by examining the book of Ruth, a narrative of coopÂ­eration. First, we introduce the general Biblical wisdom, guidance, and religious precepts on leadership characters from the Bible per se. Second, we depict a synopsis and connotation of the Ruth Narrative combined with the historical background of the late Judges time when Naomi, Elimelech, Ruth and Boaz lived and the social and religious background of Moab where the family of Elimelech dwelt in for ten years. Third, based on those background analyses, the main figuresâ dialogues, and their actions, we illustrate their positive servant and mentor leadership characters that include a combination of their distinguished traits and cognitive attributes, as well as some weaknesses of Naomi and Elimelech. In a nutshell, NaoÂ­miâs leadership characters contain loyalty to God (2:19 â 20, discovering value within (3:1 â 4, and patience and endurance (3:18. Ruthâs leadership characters incorporate faithfulness and positive self-esteem (1:16 â 17, pioneer and daring (2:2, deference (2:10, obedience (3:5, and lovÂ­ing-kindness (3:10. Boazâs leadership characters include respect (2:4, care (2:5, compassion (2:8 â 9, 11, empowerment (2:15 â 16, leaning on and trusting God (2:12, care (2:14; 3:15, protecting the weak (3:10 â 15, responsibility (3:12, moral integrity and justness (3:13, carefulness (3:14, formation (4:1, unselfishness and cleverness (4:3 â 5, and partÂ­nering (4:9 â 10. While we criticize Elimelechâs risk seeking strategy to migrate their family to a pagan country (1:1 â 2 as a spiritual adventure.\n\nReview of samples of tailings, soils and stream sediment adjacent to and downstream from the Ruth Mine, Inyo County, California\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRytuba, James J.; Kim, Christopher S.; Goldstein, Daniel N.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe Ruth Mine and mill are located in the western Mojave Desert in Inyo County, California (fig. 1). The mill processed gold-silver (Au-Ag) ores mined from the Ruth Au-Ag deposit, which is adjacent to the mill site. The Ruth Au-Ag deposit is hosted in Mesozoic intrusive rocks and is similar to other Au-Ag deposits in the western Mojave Desert that are associated with Miocene volcanic centers that formed on a basement of Mesozoic granitic rocks (Bateman, 1907; Gardner, 1954; Rytuba, 1996). The volcanic rocks consist of silicic domes and associated flows, pyroclastic rocks, and subvolcanic intrusions (fig. 2) that were emplaced into Mesozoic silicic intrusive rocks (Troxel and Morton, 1962). The Ruth Mine is on Federal land managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Tailings from the mine have been eroded and transported downstream into Homewood Canyon and then into Searles Valley (figs. 3, 4, 5, and 6). The BLM provided recreational facilities at the mine site for day-use hikers and restored and maintained the original mine buildings in collaboration with local citizen groups for use by visitors (fig. 7). The BLM requested that the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in collaboration with Chapman University, measure arsenic (As) and other geochemical constituents in soils and tailings at the mine site and in stream sediments downstream from the mine in Homewood Canyon and in Searles Valley (fig. 3). The request was made because initial sampling of the site by BLM staff indicated high concentrations of As in tailings and soils adjacent to the Ruth Mine. This report summarizes data obtained from field sampling of mine tailings and soils adjacent to the Ruth Mine and stream sediments downstream from the mine on June 7, 2009. Our results permit a preliminary assessment of the sources of As and associated chemical constituents that could potentially impact humans and biota.\n\nElaborating Naturalized Critical Realism: Response to Ruth Groff, Dave Elder-Vass, Daniel Little and Petri Ylikoski\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKaidesoja Tuukka\n\n2015-09-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper is a reply to the discussions of Ruth Groff, Dave Elder-Vass, Daniel Little, and Petri Ylikoski of Tuukka Kaidesoja (2013: Naturalizing Critical Realist Social Ontology (London: Routledge.\n\nFlorentine Renaissance Resources.

The results showed that medication characteristics of professor Li Dian-gui in treating CAGIM included drug combination of aromatic medicine bitter-cold herbs, preferring to activating to invigorate the spleen and good at using the qi-regulating drugs. It demonstrated that we can adopt the therapy of Huazhuo Jiedu and Xingpi Xingqi therapies in treating CAGIM in addition to the traditional approach of nourishing Yin and activating blood circulation, opening up a novel approach for TCM in healing the pathema.

This study is one of the first to estimate gas emissions from coal fires using field measurements at gas vents. The Truman Shepherd fire emissions are nearly 1400t CO(2)/yr and 16kg Hg/yr resulting from a coal combustion rate of 450-550t/yr. The sum of CO(2) emissions from seven vents at the Ruth Mullins fire is 726+/-72t/yr, suggesting that the fire is consuming about 250-280t coal/yr. Total Ruth Mullins fire CO and Hg emissions are estimated at 21+/-1.8t/yr and >840+/-170g/yr, respectively. The CO(2) emissions are environmentally significant, but low compared to coal-fired power plants; for example, 3.9x10(6)t CO(2)/yr for a 514-MW boiler in Kentucky. Using simple calculations, CO(2) and Hg emissions from coal-fires in the U.S. are estimated at 1.4x10(7)-2.9x10(8)t/yr and 0.58-11.5t/yr, respectively. This initial work indicates that coal fires may be an important source of CO(2), CO, Hg and other atmospheric constituents.\n\nGeographies of Memory: Ruth Beckermann's Film Aesthetics\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKaren Remmler\n\n2007-01-01\n\nFull Text Available How might we view the films by the Jewish Austrian filmmaker, Ruth Beckermann through the lens of the prose by the late German writer W.G. Sebald? The archival and, at the same time, haunting prose of Sebald's works such as The Emigrants or Austerlitz bears a close resemblance to the work of memory that Beckermann's films begs us to do. By focusing on particular spaces of remembrance in Beckermann's films in comparison to Sebald's similar practice of intermeshing historical and individual memories, this essay explores how the gendered construction of cultural memory takes place through transcultural encounters with those deemed as Other. Even as locations in Beckermann's filmsâa living room, the interior of a train passing through Vienna, a cold and sterile exhibit space, or a dream-like landscapeâexist in reality, Beckermann's situating of memory in them, creates other, more compelling encounters between the living and the dead. The gendering of memory sites in Beckermann's films creates an alternative to the more elegiac images that are conjured in Sebald's textual and visual spaces of remembrance.\n\nRuth Sprenger: Die hohe Kunst der Herrenkleidermacher. Wien u.a.: BÃ¶hlau Verlag 2009\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nGertrud Lehnert\n\n2009-07-01\n\nFull Text Available Ruth Sprenger stellt Geschichte und Praxis eines Meisterhandwerks fÃ¼r interessierte Laiinnen und Laien Ã¼bersichtlich und mit reicher Bebilderung dar. Nach einem Ãberblick Ã¼ber die Geschichte der Eleganz des Gentleman werden detailliert die einzelnen Schritte des MaÃnehmens, Entwerfens, Fertigens erlÃ¤utert. Dabei wird klar, dass ein Anzug immer eine komplizierte Umgestaltung des mÃ¤nnlichen KÃ¶rpers zu einem von antiker Kunst inspirierten abstrakten Ideal von Nacktheit darstellt. Zu kurz kommt leider jegliche kritische Auseinandersetzung mit der Theorie der Mode, so dass das Resultat zwar sehr anschaulich, jedoch in systematischer Hinsicht fÃ¼r die Modeforschung wenig erhellend ist.Ruth Sprenger clearly depicts the history and practice of a masterly handicraft for interested laypeople and includes many illustrations. Following a survey of the history of the elegance of the gentleman, she elucidates and details the single steps of measurement, design, and completion. It becomes clear that a suit always represents a complicated reconfiguration of the male body to an abstract ideal of nudity inspired by antique art. Unfortunately any critical debate on the theory of art falls short so that the results are admittedly very demonstrative, however in systematical terms they are not all too insightful for fashion research.\n\nRezension zu: Ruth AyaÃ: Kommunikation und Geschlecht.

She faces destitution. Life has handed her multiple blows, amongst them widowhood and childlessness. Her single asset? Naomi, a cranky, elderly but endearing mother-in-law. Naomi, an Israelite and also widowed, is now quite determined to go home to Bethlehem. Ruth joins Naomiâs journey, but for Ruth it is a pilgrimage, for it is at this time that she switches allegiance from the gods of Moab to the God of Israel. As an immigrant facing change on every level â a new culture, a new religion, no friends and no job â Ruth nonetheless triumphs. Within only a couple of months, not only does she marry a prominent and prosperous bachelor, Boaz, but also wins the hearts of her mother-in-lawâs friends, the women of Bethlehem. This analysis of her successful pilgrimage offers contemporary guidelines for facing dramatic changes. Using literary method, this article examines one of the Bibleâs accounts of how a personal crisis is resolved via a combination of Godâs providence and human initiative and courage.

Die bybelse teks stel die leser voor aan Rut, ân Moabitiese vrou, tydens ân persoonlike krisis in haar lewe. Sy is ân weduwee, kinderloos en staar dus armoede in die gesig. Haar enigste pluspunt is Naomi, haar bejaarde, ietwat verbitterde dog innemende skoonmoeder. Naomi, ân Israeliet en ook ân weduwee, is vasbeslote om na haar huis in Betlehem terug te keer. Rut vergesel haar en dit word vir Rut ân pelgrimstog na die God van Israel, weg van die afgode van Moab af. As immigrant wat ân vreemde kultuur en godsdiens, ân toekoms sonder vriende en werkloosheid moet verwerk, seÃ«vier Rut uiteindelik. Sy trou binne ân paar maande met Boas, ân prominente en welvarende vrygesel en wen ook die harte van haar skoonmoeder se\n\nQuantitative Amyloid Imaging in Autosomal Dominant Alzheimer's Disease: Results from the DIAN Study Group.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nYi Su\n\nFull Text Available Amyloid imaging plays an important role in the research and diagnosis of dementing disorders. Substantial variation in quantitative methods to measure brain amyloid burden exists in the field. The aim of this work is to investigate the impact of methodological variations to the quantification of amyloid burden using data from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network (DIAN, an autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease population. Cross-sectional and longitudinal [11C]-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB PET imaging data from the DIAN study were analyzed. Four candidate reference regions were investigated for estimation of brain amyloid burden. A regional spread function based technique was also investigated for the correction of partial volume effects. Cerebellar cortex, brain-stem, and white matter regions all had stable tracer retention during the course of disease. Partial volume correction consistently improves sensitivity to group differences and longitudinal changes over time. White matter referencing improved statistical power in the detecting longitudinal changes in relative tracer retention; however, the reason for this improvement is unclear and requires further investigation. Full dynamic acquisition and kinetic modeling improved statistical power although it may add cost and time. Several technical variations to amyloid burden quantification were examined in this study. Partial volume correction emerged as the strategy that most consistently improved statistical power for the detection of both longitudinal changes and across-group differences. For the autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease population with PiB imaging, utilizing brainstem as a reference region with partial volume correction may be optimal for current interventional trials. Further investigation of technical issues in quantitative amyloid imaging in different study populations using different amyloid imaging tracers is warranted.\n\nGabriela Mistral's Â«Sonnets to RuthÂ»: The Consolation of Passion\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHoward M. Fraser\n\n1978-08-01\n\nFull Text Available As for many poets, the sonnet form presented the opportunity to Gabriela Mistral to perfect her poetic technique. This study examines in detail the Nobel Laureate's trio of sonnets commemorating the biblical matriarch Ruth. Mistral's treatment of the themes of alienation, self- sacrifice, and the search for human dignity features the contrasts of suffering and consolation which are present in the biblical narrative. But, alongside the thematic purposes which the pleasure/pain duality serves, Mistral exploits this opposition for technical and structural reasons. She uses the feelings of love and pain as an organizational device in her treatment of time, characters and diction. The discipline with which she handled traditional metres, in this case the sonnet, reveals that Mistral was a capable and mature poet at an early age.\n\nPicking winners. Interview by Diane Coutu.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSocolow, Daniel J\n\n2007-05-01\n\nIn the business world, \"creativity\" has become the latest buzzword. How to attract, nurture, and direct the extraordinarily talented people who will come up with the next Lipitor, SonyWalkman, or iPod is an enduring topic among business-people. As the director of the MacArthur Fellows Program, Daniel J. Socolow has considerable experience with the process of rooting out creativity. In this conversation with HBR senior editor Diane Coutu, he describes how recipients of the \"genius grant\"--half a million dollars with no strings attached--are chosen. As significant as the money is, the recognition that comes with a fellowship may be more so. MacArthur grants provide powerful validation of the fellows' work, Socolow says, and that validation opens doors for people, whatever the field. Although the program keeps a lookout for entrepreneurs who are on the brink of major new advances, he believes that the market does a good job of rewarding the best ideas in business. Replicating the MacArthur model in a company would entail giving some employees unlimited time and lots of money to follow their own inclinations--not very feasible in most contexts. Nevertheless, the program has learned a lesson that may be valuable for business: The kind of creativity that leads to important breakthroughs is extremely hard to find. And, says Socolow, exceptionally creative people aren't always the obvious suspects, who may simply be good at promoting themselves: \"Listen to others and look in the least likely places ... Extend your networks and try to get information from as many people as possible, just as we do\".\n\nHow Do We Defend Democratic Education?

We aimed to reveal the correlation between the endocannabinoid system and PCOS, which may provide a new therapeutic target for PCOS treatment. Serum levels of anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol andexpression of cannabinoid receptors and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) in the endometrium were compared between women with PCOS and infertile women without PCOS, as well as women with PCOS before and after treatment with Diane-35 and metformin. Cannabinoid receptors and FAAH in the endometrium were stained using the immunohistochemical method. Results were analyzed by calculating integrated optical density. Plasma anandamide was increased significantly in women with PCOS compared with infertile women without PCOS. Treatment with Diane-35 and metformin reversed this increase in women with PCOS. No significant difference in 2-arachidonoylglycerol was observed between the infertile women with or without PCOS. The women with PCOS had lower endometrial expression of FAAH compared with infertile women without PCOS, whereas no significant difference in endometrial expression of cannabinoid receptors was observed between the women with PCOS and infertile women without PCOS. We found that after treatment with Diane-35 and metformin, FAAH expression tended toward a significant increase compared with women before the treatment. Endocannabinoid system may be involved in the progression of PCOS, and serum anandamide could serve as a potential biomarker of clinical diagnosis of PCOS.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of flutamide plus diane 35 in the treatment of idiopathic hirsutism and polycystic ovary syndrome. 26 polycystic ovary syndrome and 24 idiopathic hirsutism patients were evaluated. Fifty patients were divided into two groups according to their diagnosis: idiopathic hirsutism or polycystic ovary syndrome. All patients received 125 mg Flutamide once a day and Diane 35 tablets for 21 days of each month, for 12 months. We measured hirsutism scores and hormonal levels of all patients. Evaluations were done before treatment, in the 6th and 12th months of therapy. There were no significant differences in Ferriman-Gallwey scores at the beginning and at the end of the therapy between the IH and PCOS groups. The decreases in Ferriman-Gallwey scores were significant in both groups in the 6th and 12th month of therapy. Combined treatment significantly decreased total and free testosterone, DHEAS and significantly increased SHBG levels in both groups and additionally decreased levels of LH, androstenodione and LH/FSH ratio in the polycystic ovary syndrome group. Combined treatment was effective and safe in the treatment of hirsutism. Combined regimens have additional effects on the treatment of hirsutism.\n\nA Revolutionary Promise of Justice: Diane Arbusâ Self-Portrait, Pregnant, 1945, NYC\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAndrea Liss\n\n2017-08-01\n\nFull Text Available My critical musings on this little-known maternal self-portrait are meant to reconceive its meaning as an uncanny predecessor to contemporary feminist embodied knowledge.

After an accurate analysis of the main theoretical and epistemological approaches on the topic, Levitas suggests an inclusive definition which would allow to cross the boundaries imposed by Â«restrictiveÂ» characterizations, for the purpose of creating a higher degree of agreement with regards to what may be included within the concept of \"utopia\". Too Â«limitativeÂ» definitions would instead lead to misleading conclusions about the destiny and the function of the utopian genre, among which the widespread belief that utopia is in decline or, even worse, definitively disappeared. Finally, Levitas suggests a Â«sociology of utopiaÂ» through an analysis of the correlations between the two form of knowledge, correlations which, in her view, has been repressed for decades.\n\nRezension von: Catherine M.

Interview by Diane L. Coutu.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSchein, Edgar H\n\n2002-03-01\n\nDespite all the time, money, and energy that executives pour into corporate change programs, the stark reality is that few companies ever succeed in genuinely reinventing themselves. That's because the people at those companies rarely master the art of transformational learning--that is, eagerly challenging deeply held assumptions about a company's processes and, in response, altering their thoughts and actions. Instead, most people just end up doing the same old things in superficially tweaked ways. Why is transformational learning so hard to achieve? HBR senior editor Diane Coutu explores this question with psychologist and MIT professor Edgar Schein, a world-renowned expert on organizational development. In sharp contrast to the optimistic rhetoric that permeates the debate on corporate learning and change, Schein is cautious about what companies can and cannot accomplish. Corporate culture can change, he says, but this kind of learning takes time, and it isn't fun. Learning is a coercive process, Schein argues, that requires blood, sweat, tears, and a certain level of anxiety to achieve the desired effect. In this article, he describes two basic types of anxiety--learning anxiety and survival anxiety--that drive radical relearning in organizations. Schein's theories spring from his early research on how American prisoners of war in Korea had been brainwashed by their captors. He cites the parallels between the \"coercive persuasion\" tactics the Chinese communists used to control their prisoners (isolating powerful ones and overseeing all communications) and the corporate boot camps that American companies use to indoctrinate their managers. Indeed, heavy socialization is back in style in U.S. corporations today, Schein says, even if no one is calling it that.\n\n27 CFR 9.122 - Western Connecticut Highlands.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-04-01\n\n...

The soda metasomatite type is the dominant type of uranium mineralization and has the prospecting potential in the area. The characteristics of this type uranium mineralization and the problems of metallogenesis are discussed. Soda metasomatite type uranium mineralization is controlled by soda metasomatite and structure. Uranium exists mainly in the forms of minerals (pitchblende, uranate). Its cell parameter is high and oxygenated coefficient is low, belonging to moderate-low temperature hydrothermal origin. The metallogenetic materials originated from deep-seated crust and country rocks. The metallogenetic solution includes a great quantity of atmospheric water, besides hydrothermal solution from deep-seated crust. The metallogene underwent the two stages i.e. Jinnin and Chengjiang.

Interview by Diane Coutu.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHyman, Steven E\n\n2002-02-01\n\nLast fall, the United States was brutally thrust into a new and dangerous world. As the twin towers of the World Trade Center collapsed and the Pentagon burned, the horrible reality of terrorism seared the American consciousness. It touched more than the victims and their families; everyone who sat transfixed before the horrific images on TV lived through the trauma. In a sense, we were all eyewitnesses, and we must all cope with feelings of anger, stress, and anxiety. That poses a huge immediate challenge for business, because it is largely in the workplace--where we spend so many of our waking hours--that we will confront these emotions. And many companies have risen to the challenge, establishing new guidelines for processing mail in light of anthrax fears and organizing stress reduction programs for employees. While the logic of taking such action is incontestable, it raises a much larger question: What responsibility does a company bear for the mental well-being of its work-force? If companies help employees deal with depression and anxiety in the wake of terrorist acts, doesn't that put mental health care on the business agenda? To answer these questions, HBR senior editor Diane Coutu talked with Dr. Steven Hyman, the former director of the National Institute for Mental Health. In this interview, he discusses the implications of coping with tragedy, the resilience of individuals, and the treatment of mental illness. And he suggests that September 11, 2001, may come to be seen as a tipping point--the moment when managers started to think about dealing with mental health issues on a regular basis.\n\nDIANE, a simulation code for the interaction of neutrons with living tissues.

Applications aux faibles doses de neutrons rapides sur des cellules tumorales humaines\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nNenot, M.L\n\n2003-07-15\n\nOur work deals with the irradiation of cells and living tissues by 14 MeV neutrons at very low doses (a few 10{sup -2} Gy). Such experiments require an accurate knowledge of the values of neutron dose rates and fluences at the level of cell cultures. We have performed measurements of fluence rates through an activation method applied to gold and copper foils. The fluence rate is deduced from the gamma rays emitted by the irradiated foils. Neutron doses and dose rates have been measured through varied methods: PIN diodes, ionization tissue equivalent chambers, and Geiger-Mueller counters. We have designed the DIANE code to simulate the impact of energetic neutrons on cells. This code can be used with isolated cells or macroscopic tissues, it takes into account the roles of the ionisation electrons produced by recoil nuclei entering the cell. This point is all the more important since recent works have highlighted the impact of very low energy electrons on DNA.

In this work, we present images of the normalized full gradient (NFG) of the Bouguer gravity anomalies from five gravity profiles across the boundary faults of the CDB measured in recent years, and investigate the distribution characteristics of the crustal anomalous bodies along the profiles. Firstly, an anomalous body with eastward dipping exist beneath the Xianshuihe fault, suggesting that crustal mass move to east. Secondly, near the Xiaojiang fault, two anomalous bodies dip westward with depth increasing. The inferred movement direction of the north one is from west to east, and the south one is from east to west. Thirdly, anomalous bodies on the northeast and southwest sides of the Red River fault suggest the directions of crustal movement is from northeast to southwest. These results are also consistent with GPS solutions, and provide gravity evidence for crustal deformation of the CDB with clockwise rotation.\n\nDIANE, a simulation code for the interaction of neutrons with living tissues.

It examines the trajectory of consumer activist Ruth Desmond, co-founder of the organization the Federation of Homemakers. By following Desmond's evolving strategies, the article shows how the broader currents of the 1960s-70s consumer movement played out in a particular case. Initially Desmond used a traditional style that heavily emphasized her gendered identity, working within a grassroots organization to promote legislative and regulatory reforms. Later, she moved to a more modern advocacy approach, using adversarial legal methods to fight for consumer protections.\n\nThe Book of Ruth and Song of Songs in the First Hebrew Translation of The Taming of the Shrew\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKahn Lily\n\n2017-12-01\n\nFull Text Available This article investigates the earliest Hebrew rendition of a Shakespearean comedy, Judah Elkindâs ×××¡×¨ ×¡××¨×¨× musar sorera âThe Education of the Rebellious Womanâ (The Taming of the Shrew, which was translated directly from the English source text and published in Berditchev in 1892. Elkindâs translation is the only comedy among a small group of pioneering Shakespeare renditions conducted in late nineteenth-century Eastern Europe by adherents of the Jewish Enlightenment movement. It was rooted in a strongly ideological initiative to establish a modern European-style literature in Hebrew and reflecting Jewish cultural values at a time when the language was still primarily a written medium on the cusp of its large-scale revernacularisation in Palestine. The article examines the ways in which Elkindâs employment of a Judaising translation technique drawing heavily on romantic imagery from prominent biblical intertexts, particularly the Book of Ruth and the Song of Songs, affects the Petruchio and Katherine plotline in the target text. Elkindâs use of carefully selected biblical names for the main characters and his conscious insertion of biblical verses well known in Jewish tradition for their romantic connotations serve to transform Petruchio and Katherine into Peretz and Hoglah, the heroes of a distinctly Jewish love story which offers a unique and intriguing perspective on the translation of Shakespearean comedy.\n\nDiagnostic Value of Subjective Memory Complaints Assessed with a Single Item in Dominantly Inherited Alzheimerâs Disease: Results of the DIAN Study\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nChristoph Laske\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Objective. We examined the diagnostic value of subjective memory complaints (SMCs assessed with a single item in a large cross-sectional cohort consisting of families with autosomal dominant Alzheimerâs disease (ADAD participating in the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN. Methods. The baseline sample of 183 mutation carriers (MCs and 117 noncarriers (NCs was divided according to Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR scale into preclinical (CDR 0; MCs: n=107; NCs: n=109, early symptomatic (CDR 0.5; MCs: n=48; NCs: n=8, and dementia stage (CDR â¥ 1; MCs: n=28; NCs: n=0. These groups were subdivided by the presence or absence of SMCs. Results. At CDR 0, SMCs were present in 12.1% of MCs and 9.2% of NCs (P=0.6. At CDR 0.5, SMCs were present in 66.7% of MCs and 62.5% of NCs (P=1.0. At CDR â¥ 1, SMCs were present in 96.4% of MCs. SMCs in MCs were significantly associated with CDR, logical memory scores, Geriatric Depression Scale, education, and estimated years to onset. Conclusions. The present study shows that SMCs assessed by a single-item scale have no diagnostic value to identify preclinical ADAD in asymptomatic individuals. These results demonstrate the need of further improvement of SMC measures that should be examined in large clinical trials.\n\nA reading list for Bill Gates--and you. A conversation with literary critic Harold Bloom. Interview by Diane L. Coutu.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBloom, H\n\n2001-05-01\n\nIn today's technology-driven world, who has time to pick up a 400-page novel? Most executives don't--they have urgent e-mails to answer, training seminars to attend, meetings to lead, and trade publications to scan. But according to Harold Bloom, one of America's most influential scholars, they should make time in their hectic schedules to read great works. In a wide-ranging conversation with HBR senior editor Diane Coutu, Bloom discusses the importance of literature: every individual--regardless of profession--needs to stretch his or her mind and reflect now and again on the human condition. \"By reading great imaginative literature, you can prepare yourself for surprise and even get a kind of strength that welcomes and exploits the unexpected,\" he says. Because there are so many great works and there is so little time, Bloom presents a reading list for busy executives. Shakespeare's King Lear can teach businesspeople about change. Ralph Waldo Emerson's essays capture the ethos of the American spirit--individualism and inventiveness. Bloom says Sigmund Freud's conceptions \"form the only Western mythology that contemporary intellectuals have in common.\" And people will never fully understand some aspects of themselves until they read Miguel de Cervantes's Don Quixote. In short, Bloom believes the humanities have much to offer businesspeople: great books broaden their awareness and their range of sensibility, he says. But reading literature will not make businesspeople more moral, he cautions. Bloom also discusses other topics such as how to read well, the state of popular fiction, the role of irony, and the subject of change.\n\n78 FR 23279 - Connecticut; Major Disaster and Related Determinations\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2013-04-18\n\n..., Middlesex, New Haven, New London, Tolland, and Windham Counties and the Mashantucket Pequot and Mohegan... authorized.

This article examines two passages in the book of Ruth â 3:9 and 4:5. Both pertain to two practices in ancient Israel, namely the levirate marriage and the redemption of property â here in the case of the book of Ruth. Ruth 3:9 hints only indirectly to these, therefore, I aim to indicate that Ruth does offer Boaz a marriage proposal and that some form of redemption of property is intended. In Ruth 4:5 these two practices are once again juxtaposed. Scholars propose various reasons why the levirate marriage and redemption are related to each other in the book of Ruth and nowhere else in the Hebrew Bible. It appears that their proposals can be related directly to their dating of the book, either pre- or post-exilic. In my article, I accept a post-exilic dating since the author of the book of Ruth seems to know most of the laws in the Pentateuch. I conclude with the views of Irmtraud Fischer, a feminist scholar who offers interesting perspectives from a feminist historical critical point of view.\n\n2011 U.S. Department of Agriculture- Natural Resources Conservation Service (USDA-NRCS) Topographic Lidar: North West Connecticut\n\nData.gov (United States)\n\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Commerce â Earth Eye collected LiDAR data for approximately 1,703 square kilometers that partially cover the Connecticut counties of Litchfield and Fairfield.

Diane was selected based on the results of a previous study, in which data indicated that Diane understood how to design and implement proactively planned, flexible, engaging instructional activities in response to students' learning needs better than the other study participants. Data for the present study included 3 h of semi-structured interview responses, 37.5 h of observations of science instruction, and other artifacts such as instructional materials. This variety of data allowed for triangulation of the evidence. Data were analyzed using a constant comparative approach. Results indicated that technology played an integral role in Diane's planning and implementation of differentiated science lessons. The technology-enhanced differentiated lessons employed by Diane typically attended to students' different learning profiles or interest through modification of process or product. This study provides practical strategies for science teachers beginning to differentiate instruction, and recommendations for science teacher educators and school and district administrators. Future research should explore student outcomes, supports for effective formative assessment, and technology-enhanced readiness differentiation among secondary science teachers.\n\nDeveloping Intrinsic Motivation: Student Perceived Autonomy, Relatedness and Competence and the Relationship to Achievement\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHeck, DeAnn M.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThis mixed methods action study examines the relationship of students' three psychological needs of autonomy, relatedness and competence as presented in the Self-Determination Theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985) to the level of achievement of high school seniors at Litchfield High School.

This article investigates the possibility that Ruth 3:7, where Ruth went to lie at Boazï¿½ ï¿½feetï¿½, can be read in an intertextual way in the context of Exodus 4:25. In Exodus 4:24ï¿½26, whilst at a camping place on their way to Egypt, the Lord came to kill Moses. Then Zipporah, his wife, took a sharp stone (or stone knife, cut off the foreskin of her son and touched Mosesï¿½ ï¿½feetï¿½ with it. Because of the circumcision she said to Moses: ï¿½You are a bridegroom of blood to meï¿½. And so the Lord spared the life of Moses. Zipporah took the initiative and because of this, Godï¿½s will and plan for Moses could still be reached. The covenant duty of circumcision, according to Genesis 17:10ï¿½14, could also be accomplished through her intervention. This section also clearly illustrates that God welcomes non-Israelites to enter into the community of Israel. In Ruth 3:7, the same word for feet is used as in Exodus 4:25, namely . The analogous use of this word clearly emphasises the importance of the functioning of the covenant of God with Israel. There are also other similarities between these verses of Scripture. It is indicated that Ruth, like Zipporah, also took the initiative and intervened to ensure that Godï¿½s covenant plan for Israel will be accomplished. It is also indicated that Ruth, like Zipporah, is accepted into the community of Israel and that she will play an important role ensuring the future of the offspring of Mahlon/Boaz.\n\nThe platelet activating factor acetyl hydrolase, oxidized low-density lipoprotein, paraoxonase 1 and arylesterase levels in treated and untreated patients with polycystic ovary syndrome.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCarlioglu, Ayse; Kaygusuz, Ikbal; Karakurt, Feridun; Gumus, Ilknur Inegol; Uysal, Aysel; Kasapoglu, Benan; Armutcu, Ferah; Uysal, Sema; Keskin, Esra Aktepe; Koca, Cemile\n\n2014-11-01\n\nTo evaluate the platelet activating factor acetyl hydrolyze (PAF-AH), oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL), paraoxonase 1 (PON1), arylesterase (ARE) levels and the effects of metformin and Diane-35 (ethinyl oestradiol + cyproterone acetate) therapies on these parameters and to determine the PON1 polymorphisms among PCOS patients. Ninety patients with PCOS, age 30, and body mass index-matched healthy controls were included in the study. Patients were divided into three groups: metformin treatment, Diane-35 treatment and no medication groups. The treatment with metformin or Diane-35 was continued for 6 months and all subjects were evaluated with clinical and biochemical parameters 6 months later. One-way Anova test, t test and non-parametric Mann-Whitney U tests were used for statistical analysis. PAF-AH and ox-LDL levels were statistically significantly higher in untreated PCOS patients than controls, and they were statistically significantly lower in patients treated with metformin or Diane-35 than untreated PCOS patients. In contrast, there were lower PON1 (not statistically significant) and ARE (statistically significant) levels in untreated PCOS patients than the control group and they significantly increased after metformin and Diane-35 treatments. In PCOS patients serum PON1 levels for QQ, QR and RR phenotypes were statistically significantly lower than the control group. In patients with PCOS, proatherogenic markers increase. The treatment of PCOS with metformin or Diane-35 had positive effects on lipid profile, increased PON1 level, which is a protector from atherosclerosis and decreased the proatherogenic PAF-AH and ox-LDL levels.\n\n[Strive, plan and reach the \"Summit\": the Faculty Development Program at the Ruth & Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Israel Institute of Technology].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCastel, Orit Cohen; Nave, Rachel; Ganor, Margalit; Hasson-Gilad, Dalia R; Brika, Riva\n\n2010-04-01\n\nIn recent years, faculty development has turned into a central component of medical education and a primary instrument in qualifying physicians to be teachers and educators. The faculty development program at the Ruth & Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine (\"Summit\" program) was established in order to improve teaching of the clinical professions, to create a community of medical teachers and educators and to develop leadership in medical education within the Faculty of Medicine. This article aims to describe the design, implementation and evaluation of the faculty development program in the Technion's Faculty of Medicine. The program was designed for a group of 20 clinical teachers, of various clinical professions, who had gained at least one year of undergraduate teaching experience and wished to develop a career in medical education. The program included seven monthly, eight-hour meetings throughout the academic year. Learning was based on small group discussions, interactive exercises, role-plays and simulations, self-directed reading and reflective writing. At the end of the final meeting, participants completed an evaluation form. Seventeen of the 20 participants (85%) graduated and received certificates. Learners' overall satisfaction was high. Graduates expressed high motivation to practice medical education within the Faculty of Medicine and reported that they gained new knowledge in medical education and skills regarding various aspects of teaching and learning, such as formulation of learning objectives, designing role plays, and providing effective feedback. The \"Summit\" program is an innovative initiative in the field of medical education in Israel. The program had a significant impact on participants' knowledge, teaching skills and attitudes. In order to ensure implementation of the acquired tools and skills, its shortterm and long-term effects on teaching behavior and the learning climate have yet to be demonstrated.

Although DIANE does not transport the electrons and positrons, the production of Bremsstrahlung photons induced by the electrons and positrons during their slowing down is taken into account in the ZADIG code because the electron-gamma cascade is an important process in high energy gamma ray transport. ZADIG does not distinguish positrons from electrons except for the positron annihilation. However, the user can turn on this direction. This report presents the latest improvements to the Bremsstrahlung model of ZADIG and to the positron annihilation algorithm implemented in the code. Positrons can annihilate either in flight or at rest in the latest release of ZADIG. As MCNP does not take into account the annihilation in flight, results of ZADIG-DIANE calculations are compared to the results of GEANT-4 in order to validate the annihilation scheme of ZADIG. The results with annihilation divided by the results without present similar trends between 0.6 and 10 MeV for the 2 codes (GEANT-4 and ZADIG-DIANE), in other words an influence of 5%, so the annihilation scheme programmed in ZADIG appears to be satisfying and can be considered as validated.\n\nDistributed analysis environment for HEP and interdisciplinary applications\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMoscicki, J.T.\n\n2003-01-01\n\nHuge data volumes of Larger Hadron Collider experiment require parallel end-user analysis on clusters of hundreds of machines. While the focus of end-user High-Energy Physics analysis is on ntuples, the master-worker model of parallel processing may be also used in other contexts such as detector simulation. The aim of DIANE R and D project (http://cern.ch/it-proj-diane) currently held by CERN IT/API group is to create a generic, component-based framework for distributed, parallel data processing in master-worker model. Pre-compiled user analysis code is loaded dynamically at runtime in component libraries and called back when appropriate. Such application-oriented framework must be flexible enough to integrate with the emerging GRID technologies as they become available in the time to come. Therefore, common services such as environment reconstruction, code distribution, load balancing and authentication are designed and implemented as pluggable modules. This approach allows to easily replace them with modules implemented with newer technology as necessary. The paper gives an overview of DIANE architecture and explains the main design choices. Selected examples of diverse applications from a variety of domains applicable to DIANE are presented.

Describing the life of Edison Carneiro, his relationship with American anthropologist Ruth Landes and his participation in the folkloric movement, I look to situate Carneiro among the various intellectual trends found within the study of Afro-Brazilian religions. I argue that the author occupied an ambiguous position in terms of the African presence in the constitution of Afro-Brazilian religions, showing close proximities to Ruth Landes, Franklin Frazier, Ruth Benedict, Donald Pierson and Robert Park on the one hand, and Melville Herskovitz, Roger Bastide and Arthur Ramos on the other.

L'objectif de ce travail est de dÃ©terminer les infections les plus lÃ©tales, la durÃ©e mÃ©diane de sÃ©jour et le gain pondÃ©ral mÃ©dian journalier des enfants malnutris. MÃ©thodes Ãtude de cohorte rÃ©trospective des enfants malnutris de 0 Ã 59 mois hospitalisÃ©s au Centre Nutritionnel et ThÃ©rapeutique de Bukavu du 1er janvier 2011 au 31 dÃ©cembre 2013. LâÃ©valuation du risque de survenue de dÃ©cÃ¨s par complication infectieuse a Ã©tÃ© faite par la mesure du risque relatif. Nous avons utilisÃ© le test de Mann-Whitney pour comparer les mÃ©dianes. Les Odd ratio ajustÃ©s par rÃ©gression logistique et leurs intervalles de confiance Ã 95% du risque de mortalitÃ© ont Ã©tÃ© donnÃ©s pour chaque cause infectieuse. RÃ©sultats Au total, 574 enfants avaient Ã©tÃ© inclus. Cinq cent vingt et un (90.8%) enfants Ã©taient sortis guÃ©ris, 10 (1.7%) avaient abandonnÃ© le traitement et 43 (7.5%) Ã©taient dÃ©cÃ©dÃ©s. La durÃ©e mÃ©diane de sÃ©jour Ã©tait de 19 (13-26) jours et le gain pondÃ©ral mÃ©dian journalier Ã©tait de 7 (3-13) g/kg/j. Il existait une association statistiquement significative entre la mortalitÃ© et le sepsis / choc septique (p = 0,0004), la mÃ©ningite (p = 0,00001), et l'infection Ã VIH (p = 0,02). Conclusion Une meilleure prise en charge de la malnutrition aigÃ¼e dans notre rÃ©gion devrait se baser sur la mise en place des unitÃ©s spÃ©cialisÃ©es et bien Ã©quipÃ©es pour la prise en charge de la malnutrition associÃ©es aux infections sÃ©vÃ¨res.
