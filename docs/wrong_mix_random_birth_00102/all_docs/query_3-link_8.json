Controctors, tells our 28th General Convention. The trend is for corporations to incorporate construction into their mointenance programs and for governmental agencies to maintain construction arms in various departments. Unless the industry fights back, contract construction may fade out of the picture. Site Tax, Answer To Slums? 9 Most American cities face staggering problems of rehabilitation if slums ore to be eliminated. Yet the current tax structure makes slum clearance next to impossible. Site taxation— a tax plan in which the land rather than the improvements on it carries the tax load— seems to offer a solution. Many parts of the world have found site taxa- tion beneficial. Universal Declaration Of Human Rights - - 12 The history of mankind's march toward freedom is wrapped up in a number of important documents beginning with the Magna Charta of 1215. Ten years ago last month a tremendously important one was signed at San Francisco. It is called \"The Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\" To date it has not been implemented in too many parts of the world, but it sets forth the conditions toward which mankind is moving. On this Tenth Anniversary the document is well worth re-reading. Accidents Are Deadlier Than Bullets - - 16 Safety tips on using powder actuated tools.

Newspaper publicity has been bad, NLRB decisions have been unfriendly, liberal candidates have found the going rough. But in recent months the tide seems to be turning. Workers are voting for union representation in greater numbers, several court decisions have given labor a better break, and last November's election proved that liberal candidates can be elected with strong labor support.

Box UB-19, Topeka, Kansas CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY NEEDS UNITY By James Marshall, Executive Manager, Associated General Contractors (Excerpts from Mr, Marshall's remarks before the 28th General Convention in St. Louis, November 11, 1958.) * * * THE CONDITIONS of the (construction) industry now would ordinar- ily be recognized as extremely good. Not only is our present volume high— we will probably make another record this year. That volume has probably been the greatest force for pulling all industry out of a depression if there was one starting, and competition is now keen and in many places vicious. This is probably due in large part to the fact that the con- struction contractor is always wishing to expand, expand and expand, and he wants work at the present time. The highway program which has been undertaken has great effect upon your craftsmen as well as others. Not only is the nature of the highway work today such that it uses many structures and therefore your men, but it is also developing vast new com- munities, almost a reorganization of our living and working conditions in the country, and every new commun- ity requires construction, all of which requires the skills of your people. The highway program is important to all of us. The present situation seems satis- factory, and that is where the danger lies. Let us not think that because it is so now it will go on that way for- ever. Too long, I think, employers of construction felt that there was going to be so much construction built that they would have to get them to do it, so why worry much about it. I am afraid that too often when some of our people get into squabbles they think, \"Oh, well, let it wait. If it isn't built now maybe we will do it on over- time or something else. It isn't im- portant; we haven't any competition.\" I think that is the thought throughout the industry, certainly too much so. I am almost afraid that we have gotten more than we can handle un- less we do something about it and do it rather quickly. We have got a great industry here that finally was recog- nized as an industry by the whole world following World War II. I am afraid it is about to disintegrate into a thousand, a hundred thousand little pieces tiiat may become merely a maintenance and construction depart- ment of some industry some place, or of a City Hall on street work and building work, of a state government handling public buildings and roads and so forth, or of the railroad indus- try and the airplane industry, or all industries, as a matter of fact, if the present trend isn't recognized by our industry and we do something about it. I do not mean that we can do any- thing restrictive. We will not, I hope, ever have to resort to having you people go into restrictive agreements and tell somebody that they cannot buy an automobile unless some cer- tain condition exists in your industry, or resort to any other type of restric- tion. But we have got to sell the con- struction industry. We have got to THE C A 11 P E N T E K keep it as a unit, as an industry, and we lia\\e got to make tlie people un- derstand the \\alue of it. I would like to go back for a min- ute to the first recognition of construc- tion as an industry in World War I where the first thing that had to be done was barracks and other pieces of construction in order to get imder way. The industry at that time was not organized, was not a unit, had not been identified, and as a result there was a lot of confusion among the con- tractors. There were one or two big contrac- tors who would piece out the work and you people were not organized so tliat you could mobilize the labor forces on the job, ^^'ith the result that after we got throu2;h, the construction industry got a lot of criticism. It was criticized and it was said that it was not an industry, the con- tractors had done wrong things, that thev had been crooked and all this and that. Of course, it was then that the so-called plus-cost contract went into disfavor and is now, of course, replaced by the cost-plus fee contract instead. The AGC was formed, as a matter of fact, at the request of President Wilson who asked the Chamber of Commerce, \"Why don't you organize the construction industry?\" Our peo- ple thought that they would rather have an organization of their own, and the AGC was formed. Since that time your organization and other organ- izations in the building trades, the Building Trades Department and the Councils throughout the United States developed a training for the men, an apprenticeship training, and through tlie exchange of men through- out all the industry we have devel- oped a means of calling them to- gether after years of working to- gether. In other words, the industry after World War II was mobilized and could be organized quickly on any job and do the job for the country. I think that you will realize that some of the greatest tril)utes coming out of World War II went to the con- struction industry, to the contractors, to the men and everybody in the in- dustry for the miracles that were per- formed at that time. At that time the industry was at its peak. In my opin- ion, it was the outstanding example of free enterprise, of individuals operat- ing with a minimum of restrictions and regulations of any kind, and a competitive system meeting the check and balance of the profit motive in- centive and it has become an out- standing example to the world. Let us look back for just a moment at the depression. As you know, we couldn't get public works under way fast enough. Along came Harry Hop- kins with his WPA and they began to employ men for other purposes than doing a good job in construction and building. I am afraid that same sentiment is going on today in indus- try where they feel that they would like to do this construction work with their own forces, not because they could do it better, not because they could do it safest, but merely because it might please some of the people that they work with, it might provide them with some employment or some benefits. In other words, a kind of a do-it-yourself program is in the air. I think the employers, not as em- ployers but as business men, have not done their job in continuing to sell the public, sell the client on the value of construction. I am afraid we have let it break into too many little splin- tered parts. Maybe because we could get a better job for somebody as a subcontract, putting the ground around the building, we did it rather than do it ourselves until we have the THE CARPENTER industry broken up into a lot of little parts. Those parts today are being gathered together by what we call the investment builder, who employs either subcontractors or the men di- rect for the purpose of performing the job instead of through the regular method of having the architect sub- mitting bids, the architect supervis- ing the contractor and the contractor checking the architect, and then men working under a system of some sub- contractor or mechanical and special- ized contractors as a system. So that thing that has done miracles is break- ing down, and I realize our people are somewhat at fault, perhaps because of the highly competitive condition that exists. I would like to say that America needs a construction industry as do these same industrial business firms and the railroads and the rest of them if they are going to survive in any form of emergency. But how would you mobilize the industry to meet World War III? If your men were all in industrial plants and on maintenance crews, or on maintenance crews on the highways, or on maintenance crews for the school board or in some other man- ner, instead of being trained to the minute and used to the supervision that they get through this industry, it would be impossible. What will hap- pen to it if you are nothing but a branch or a small department of in- dustry? Now I am not trying to tell you that anybody is to blame. I don't know, maybe it's a trend that we can't help. I don't think anybody is plot- ting to do all this. In fact, I don't think anybody is smart enough to get us in such a mess as this, but it is there and I think we have got to rec- ognize it as an industry. Now some- body says, \"Well, I see you point out the problems; how about the an- swers?\" I don't have the answers ex- cept perhaps in a few broad terms. First of all, it is going to take a lot of work and it is going to take some time. The first thing we have got to do is to quit squabbling be- tween the contractors and the men over the work that we have today, and let's let that run as smoothly as we can, and let's look to the future and the preservation of the industry as a whole. I can't accuse anybody, but we can- not delay any further in getting this industry together as some kind of a unit and staying that way. We are embarrassed. We don't know what the situation will be. The Joint Board for Jurisdictional Disputes has done a lot of good. It was pretty tough on Maurice here. It was tough on Tom Murray and it was tough on me, too. But it has helped the situation. Never- theless, I don't know what we are go- ing to do unless we can get some type of organization that will hold this thing together. Today the Teamsters are not a part of the big organized body that you are dealing with, but construction people cannot get along without the Teamsters. It just can't be done. There may be others who may not be affiliated with that group who can get along. Now, as you know, the Taft-Hartley Act was written for the industrial plants, as every law seems to be, and not for construction, and in that re- spect we have been behind the eight ball because while others by election could get certification and establish their rights within organized labor and before the courts, we have been unable to do so. The approach to that has been tried in several ways, and none of them have been entirely satis- factory. Our employers, I believe, at the time that the Taft-Hartley Act was being amended for construction, were T II F. C A n 1» K X T E R considered under Seeretary Milehell and we felt that a means of certifica- tion without election would be pos- sible. Quite a fe\\\\' people felt that, well, how can we define what a car- penter does, what a plumber does, what an electrician does, what a la- l)orer does in the construction indus- try How can we do it without quar- relinn; back and forth until that certi- fication is established for a certified agreement or a right to recognize? But the thought has always occurred to us though it ma)' not be easy to do. .Xhnbe it isn't the thincr to do, but one way to do it is, you can define the construction industry and recon- struction and repair as different from maintenance. I tliink you can define those categories within the industry as a whole. Now maybe it's too much to hope for, but I am beginning to feel that perhaps all the employers in the industry must baro;ain together in the matter of recognition. Perhaps all of the building trades ought to bar- gain together in a community so far as recognition is concerned and perhaps so far as settlement of disputes are concerned. I realize if I were an International president, I perhaps would hesitate to give any of my authority over to the Building Trades Council at the pres- ent time, but that doesn't mean that a Council couldn't be so established and perhaps recognize that more authority could be given so tliat such a bar- gaining perhaps could take place. Then all you would have to define is what the construction industry is. I don't know that this is anything that will work, but I know that there is a way to solve the problem. It is going to be by our getting together and staying together. Sometimes I look upon contractors fighting over A\\'ho gets this job and who gets a part of this, and you fellows are fight- ing over jurisdiction almost like a pack of wolves, all jumping onto one little lamb carcass and letting the whole flock of sheep run away, imtil they have lost their opportunity for- ever. It is not to be condemned. It is just something that is wrong. And I perhaps may be speaking out of turn today in talking to men who represent the million people that you represent. But I think something has got to be done, men. This is not my plan. This is merely to tell you the possibilities of what can be done. I think we owe it to the government. We owe it to ourselves, we owe it to our industry to find some way to get together, to work together. We have got to have a method of stopping disputes, not stopping disputes alone, but work stoppages locally. We are doing pretty well on jurisdiction today, but there are even better ways to accom- plish this. I think you are going to have to have a Building Trades Coun- cil of the kind you want and the kind that will have power enough to func- tion adequately. You are going to have to have a Building Trades De- partment that has much more power than it has today and in that respect you must have ample and qualified leaders to carry it through. I think the employers are going to have to be or- ganized in the same manner or some manner so that we can meet the situa- tion and the real competition that we have. I thank you very much for this op- portunity to talk to you. I merely plead with you to follow your leader- ship in anything that will strengthen this great industry that we have all helped to make. Thank you. Site Tax, Answer To Slums ? * * THE SKYROCKETING cost of land seems to be a matter of growing concern to many people. No article appearing in THE CARPENTER, in recent years evoked as much response as a recent piece dealing with the handicaps which zooming land prices are imposing on the construc- tion industry— particularly home building. Interested readers have sent in dozens of letters and pamphlets dealing with this subject. That the skyrocketing price of land is creating a critical situation in cities and hamlets alike is a fact that no one disputes seriously. The great need of the nation is for modest cost housing. But modest cost housing cannot be provided on land that costs $3,000 to $5,000 per lot— land, incidentally, that sold for only a few hundred dollars an acre a decade ago. Builders who are forced to pay these exhorbitant prices are compelled to erect luxury homes in order to come out. So the middle-income group finds itself caught in a housing squeeze that a dozen years of comparatively heavy home building have done very little to alleviate. However, the home seekers are not the only people worried. The situa- tion is viewed with alarm by banks, insurance companies, retailers, and a great many other people who have a vital stake in housing. It worries the government agencies that are respon- sible for building highways, air ter- minals and other types of public works that require space. It strikes with special force at the fountainhead of American life— the municipality. The high cost of land makes it especially difficult for the municipality to share in financing the cost of redevelopment so sorely need- ed everywhere. Yet the rehabilitation of blighted areas is desperately need- ed by the municipalities to improve the tax base on which revenue is col- cious cii-cle from which there seems to be no escape. The chief difficulty stems from two facts which are inseparable: 1. Urban population is increasing at a rate that is best described as explosive. 2. The quality of raw land does not change any regardless of what changes take place around it. Therefore it is obvious that the in- creases which occur in land prices occur not because of any changes in the physical properties of the land but rather because of a vast increase in demand for a fixed supply. The quantity of land in existence is fixed; increasing population creates more people to compete for the land that exists. The price offered for a given piece of land multiplies as a result of the pressures which increasing popu- lation creates. Who contributes to the increase in land values? Certainly not the owner. He does nothing to the land except hold it. But the taxpayers— that is, all the people— enhance the value of a lected. The city fathers increasingly piece of land by financing streets, find themselves caught up in a vi- sewers, playgrounds, water supply. THE CARPENTER etc. in the sunouiKling area. They pay lor transit faciHties and expressways to make tlie land more accessible. Added to this public investment in the cnliancement of a piece of ground is a \\'ast inxestment by private enter- prisers who add an immense private inxestment in the form of commer- cial buildings, shopping centers, thea- ters, etc. Thus many people contribute to the enhancement of the value of a piece of iiround. It is these investments \\\\hich push the price of a rural acre from $500 to $12,000, and, in the downtown area from $50,000 to 750,- 000 in a few years. A hundred years ago a man named Henry George viewed this speculative aspect of land values with a jaundiced eve. He reasoned that since the peo- ple created all land values, the un- earned profits in land values ought to re\\ert to tlie people. He proposed a sinfile tax on land, the tax to absorb all the extra value added to land by population growth. To the best of our knowledge, no municipality or nation has yet adopt- ed the Henry George single tax the- orv. although his ideas still have many followers. (No less than 10 ad- \\'ocates of Henry George's theories sent us literature after the piece on land values appeared in THE CAR- PENTER.) However, a modification of the Henry George tax theory has been working very successfully in many parts of the world— notably Australia and New Zealand. Many Australian municipalities operate on a site tax theory. The main feature of this sys- tem is that the land rather than the improvements on it are taxed. This is not \\h. George's single tax theory by any manner of means, but it does shift the tax burden from the structures on land to land itself. The result is that part of the unearned increment brought on by increased land values reverts to the people. Sydney, the largest city in Australia, operates on a site tax basis. In 1957, Mr. Roy Hendy, town clerk, had this to say about the results of the site tax operation: \" . . .There was a marked increase in the rates of the main business area, where the concentration of land val- ues was the greatest, and a corre- sponding reduction in other areas de- voted mainly to residential, industrial and manufacturing purposes.\" \"The removal of the rates (taxes) on buildings encouraged their im- provement as well as the erection of many fine new structures. Something in the nature of a transformation took place in the main business section where numerous large, modern office and other buildings were erected. The office buildings were well distributed. An Act of Parliament restricting the height of building to 150 feet kept consequential increases in population densities and traffic problems within reasonable bounds. There was an im- mediate movement toward the scrap- ping of old and out-of -date buildings and the erection of modern edifices. This movement continued with but a brief interval during the depression.\" Mr. H. Bronson Cowan, a Canadian newspaperman whose interest in taxa- tion goes back many years, recently completed a study of the site method of taxation as it exists in various parts of the world. In a work of monumen- tal proportions he cites chapter and verse of what has been accomplished through the switch from traditional taxation of improvements and site to taxation of site almost exclusively. Generally he found that it became more profitable for real estate owners to tear down old buildings and re- THE CARPENTER H place them with new ones when the Mr. Cowan found that of 768 muni- site carried the brunt of the tax bur-., cipahties in Austraha and New Zea- den. It simply was not economic to land which adopted site taxation years maintain a dilapidated building on a ago, only eight have abandoned the piece of high tax land when a newer program due to local circumstances and bigger structure would cost very of unusual nature, little more in the way of taxes. Unlike Henry George's single tax He found, too, that cities tended to theory, which still remains pretty modernize much faster under this j^uch a theory, site taxation has been kind of system. He found also that put to the test of actual application, taxes on homes tended to decrease From Mr. Cowan's study it is apparent while the taxes on property in the that it can work beneficially in many center of town carried a bigger share instances, of the tax load.

JOBLESS ROLLS CLIMB AGAIN The predicted increase in unemployment during the winter months is beginning to make itself felt. Latest reports from the Department of Labor show that the upward trend in initial claims for jobless benefits has been resumed after a drop over the Thanksgiving period. Claims under the temporary program which provides a second round of benefits also have begun to climb instead of dropping as they have been for the past few months. \"While much of the rise resulted from the delayed filing of Thanksgiving week claims,\" the Labor Department said, \"seasonal curtailments in food processing, apparel, lumber and in construction and other outdoor activities also contributed to the increase.\" Initial claims under the regular State programs rose 88,400 to 390,000 during the week ended December 6 with 46 States reporting larger volumes. The figure for the week was only slightly less than for the same week a year ago and was up more than 100,000 over the figure for 1956. Claims under the second-round temporary program rose by 8,400 to 50,100 during the week making a total of 409,300 now on the second round rolls. This reverses the downward trend in total beneficiaries which has set the pattern during the past months. Largest increases in initial claims were in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illi- nois, Ohio and New York— all with increases of more than 5,000 each. Six other states with increases of more than 2,500 each were California, Indiana, Massa- chusetts, Michigan, Missouri and North Carolina. 12 Universal Declaration Of Human Rights T * * * HE HISTORY of mankind's march toward freedom and personal security is wrapped up in a long procession of important documents. Signing of the Magna Charta in 1215 broke the absolute power of kings. The Bill of Rights of 1679, the American Declaration of Independence of 1776, Frances Declaration of the Rights of Man, and a host of other his- tory-making documents all laid important groundwork for man's emancipa- tion from exploitation, fear, and slavery. Just 10 years ago last month, another important document, spelling out still further the inherent rights which human beings acquire at birth, was signed at San Francisco. This document was \"The Universal Declaration of Hiunan Rishts. It was conceived and adopted by the United Nations Gen- eral Assembly. To date it has not been implemented by enabling legis- lation in many states. Nevertheless it is an important document because it sets forth tlie conditions toward which humanity is aspiring. Some day it will be applied universally in all parts of the world. This being the 10th anniversary of its signing, a re-reading of its provi- sions by all people seems timely. Therefore it is reprinted in its entirety here: THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY proclaims THIS UNIVERSAL DECLARA- TION OF HUMAN RIGHTS as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations, to the end that every individual and every organ of society, keeping this Dec- laration constantly in mind, shall strive by teaching and education to promote respect for these rights and freedoms and by progressive meas- ures, national and international, to secure their universal and efiFective recognition and observance, both among the peoples of Member States themselves and among the peoples of territories under theii- jurisdiction.

Accidents, Sickness Cost Billions Last Year Americans lost a total of about 3.4 billion days from their normal activities because of illness or injury in the year ending June 30, the U.S. Public Health Service reported on the basis of its first nationwide survey covering a full year. The average was 20 days per person. The total includes both full days lost from work, school or other regular activities, and days when normal occupations had to be curtailed because of a physical condition. The most serious ofi^ender was chronic ailments, with circulatory diseases alone causing 484.2 million days of restricted activity, or an average of 2.9 per person. Acute illnesses accounted for 437.9 million restricted days, or about 2.6 per person. Acute respiratory conditions, including Asian influenza, caused an average of some 7 restricted days per person, including all days lost from work, school, etc. Injuries were responsible for the loss of 424.1 million normal days, or 2.5 per person. Approximately 47 million persons were hurt seriously enough to restrict their activities for at least a day, or to seek medical attention. The report also showed that 889.9 million calls were made on physicians, or 5.3 times per person on the average. People went to their dentists 269.2 million times, or 1.6 times per person. Accidents Are Deadlier Than Bullets Ez- Learn To Work Safely -z= A NUMBER of tools utilizing explosive charges to drive fastenings, cut cables and perform similar functions have been developed in recent )'ears, and are now widely used throughout industry. The manufac- turers of these devices provide detailed instructions regarding their use, and these instructions should be closely adhered to at all times. The following general recommendations apply to all powder actuated tools. 1. OnJij properly trained and quali ficd operators should use powder ac- tuated tools. Users should possess Qualified Operators cards ivhich are, after thorough training, issued by a paiiicular manufacturer s authorized dealer or distributor or other compe- tent source. 2. A loaded tool should never be carried away from the worksite. Tool should always be left unloaded until ready for actual use. 3. The tool should never be point- ed at anyone, whether loaded or un- loaded, and hands should be kept clear of open muzzle end. 4. Powder actuated tools should never be stored or used in explosive atmospheres or in the vicinity of high- ly flammable materials, or where non- sparking tools are required. 5. Tool should be held firmly against and perpendicular to the sur- face being driven into. 6. Safety goggles should be worn by operator, and face should be pro- tected if there is danger of spalling materials. Transparent face shields provide both eye and face protection. 7. Manufacturers' recommendations should be sought if there is any doubt about the material being driven into. Most manufacturers recommend against driving into very hard or brit- tle materials such as cast iron, glazed tile, surfacehardened steel, glass block, live rock, face brick, hollow tile and similar materials. 8. In order to prevent flying haz- ards no stud or attachment should be driven without first making sure that it will not pass completely through the material being driven into. \"Captive stud\" type powder actu- ated tools are now available which are designed to stop a stud or pin in its tracks should it be fired mistakenly into soft or insubstantial materials. The stud is prevented from free flight by a piston and buffer in the guard assembly. A partial turn of the tool frees it from a stud properly set in the work surface. 9. Studs should be driven a safe distance from the edge of material, in accordance with instructions. THE CARPENTER 17 10. Studs and fastenings should not be driven through pre-drilled or pre- punched holes without using special guard designed for this purpose. 11. In the event of a misfire, tool should not be removed from the work- ing surface for 15 seconds. Cartridge should be removed before lifting guard from the surface. 12. In the event of jamming or ob- struction in the bore, follow the manu- facturer's instructions carefully. An obstructed bore should never be cleared by firing another cartridge or stud and cartridge assembly. 13. Tool should be loaded only if it is to be used immediately. The tools used should be of a model and type that have rigidly built-in safety features; including protective shields or guards not removable with- out rendering tools inoperative; mech- anisms to prevent firing during load- ing, dropping or preparing to fire; built-in angle or tilt-fire controls which prevent discharge if tool is inclined more than eight (8) degrees from position perpendicular to work surface; and mechanism preventing firing unless muzzle end is pressed against work surface. Tools should be tested before each use to check that safety devices are in proper working condition, that tool is clean, that all moving parts operate freely and that the barrel is free from obstruction. Any tool not in working order or developing a defect in use should immediately be removed from service and not used again until proper repairs have been made by competent personnel. Only fasteners which are specially designed and manufactured for use in powder actuated tools should be used. In areas where stud drivers are be- ing used, signs and barricades identi- fying the high hazard area are recom- mended. BECOME A PROFESSIONAL DRIVER \"The Professional Touch,\" a pamphlet aimed at reducing the number of off-the-job traffic accidents to industrial employes, has been published by the National Safety Council. The 12-page, multi-colored pamphlet says you can— and should— be as professional a driver as the men who drive trucks, busses and taxicabs for a living. \"The professional touch,\" it says, \"is essential in handling a motor vehicle skillfully and safely.\" Tips on how to drive professionally, and examples of where the amateur driver goes wrong are contained in the new publication. Single copies of \"The Professional Touch\" and information on quantity prices may be obtained from the National Safety Council, 425 N. Michigan Ave., Chicago 11, 111. p LANE uO#S-IP ALL TOO TRUE Many good stories were told at the 28tli Giiu-ral Convention. However, in our opin- ion, the best one was told by Second Vice President O. Wm. Blaicr at the Second Dis- trict Dinner. It concerned a carpenter who worked non-imion all his life. He followed tlie trade 40 >ears and never once joined the union. Finally he became ill and the doctor told liini that deatli was only a few weeks off. As is natural in such situations, he began gi\\ing his wife instructions as to what she should do in preparation for his exit from earth. \"Go to the undertakers,\" he said, \"and pick out a suitable casket. Pick out a lot at the cemetery and then go to the union hall and hire six union carpenters to act as pall bearers.\" \"For Heaven's sake,\" replied the wife, \"I can understand the casket and cemetery lot, but why the union pall bearers. All your life you worked non-union; why do you want union members to be pall bearers\"? \"Well,\" replied the guy, \"they carried me all my life so they may as well finish the job.\" \"Type this over!.. I distinctly said: 'Right -to- Work laws have succored the working man.'! Not, suckered himi\" NOT EXACTLY BRIGHT Some business publications are fomenting a great hue and cry that labor unions must stop asking for wage increases if inflation is to be stopi^ed. Increasing labor costs are the sole cause of higher prices, they insist. Profits have nothing to do with the situation appar- ently. However, a study recently released by a Senate anti-trust sub-committee reveals that General Motor's gross profit on an auto- mobile is just about equal to the total direct labor cost involved in making the car. The committee found that CM makes about $313 on a car before taxes, while its labor cost for the car runs from $300 to $400. Expecting a wage freeze to stop inflation under such circumstances is about on a par with trying to bail out a boat with a sieve. It sort of brings to mind the story of the village half-wit. This poor guy was a nice fellow but just not equipped with enough gray matter to hold down a job. So a number of towns- people decided they should do something for him. They decided they would each chip in 50c a week for him, but in order to give him a sense of importance they would cre- ate a job for him rather than giving him the money as a dole. So they decided they would pay him for polishing the Civil War cannon in the park. They put the proposition up to him and the fellow was delighted. Each day he polished up the cannon and each week he was given his pay. This went on for quite a while until one day tlie cannon-polisher notified the com- mittee that he was quitting. Naturally the committee asked why, \"Well, it's this way,\" replied the half-vidt, \"I like working for you guys fine, but I am ambitious too. I want to get ahead, so I saved my money and bought my own can- non. Now I am in business for myself.\" • * * THE PAUP ANGLE \"The nation is full of politicians who would rather be right than be president,\" says Joe Paup, the sage of Coyote Flats, \"but what this country needs is a guy who can be right and president at the same time.\" THE CARPENTER 19 TWO KINDS OF HELL Harry Fleischman of National Labor Ser- vice tells the following story which is cur- rently popular in Poland: A Polish Communist leader died and went to Hell. He took this as no more than his due, but was surprised to see two gates— \"Communist Hell\" and \"Capitalist Hell.\" A large queue was lined up to enter \"Com- mtmist Hell\" while no one was in front of \"Capitalist Hell.\" The Polish Communist went to the devil who served as registration clerk. \"Pardon me,\" he said, \"but I'm new here. How does a sinner suflFer in Communist Hell?\" \"Oh, you're roasted on a spit over burn- ing coals.\" \"And how about Capitalist Hell?\" \"There you're roasted on a spit over burn- ing coals.\" \"Then, if there's no difference, why do so many sinners prefer Communist Hell to CapitaUst Hell?\" \"Who said there's no difference? In the Communist Hell, one week there is no de- livery of coal. Another week, the furnace is out of order. A third week the coal- handler is drunk. Believe me, comrade, Communist Hell is much better!\" * * • MORE TRUTH THAN POETRY Speaking of the elections, one right-to- work backer in Idaho had a hard time at a pohtical meeting at Boise. Every time he started shedding tears for the poor guy who got all the benefits of union negotia- tions without helping to defray the costs of running the union a heckler in the back of the hall would yell: \"The cow is dead.\" Time after time, just as he was about to make a point, the voice would pipe up \"The cow is dead.\" The fellow finished his speech with great difficulty. When it was finally over he re- marked to one of his cronies: \"My, that was terrible. What's this 'the cow is dead' routine?\" \"Oh, don't you know?\" replied the friend. \"That's the local way of saying 'we don't need no more bull around here.' \" * * * COULD BE From all reports, 1958 is due to set an- other new high for teen age crime. Juvenile delinquency is one phase of our national life in which there is no depression. Maybe one of the troubles is that the child who is tied to his mother's apon strings these days is no longer tied to his mother. TOP SOIL DEPENDENCY Senator Lister Hill of Alabama last month warned the nation that deep trouble lies ahead if the nation does not take better care of its soil resources. Senator Hill point- ed out that one nation after another in human history faded into nothingness through failure to conserve soil and water. Then he pointed out that we are mining our soil resources faster than any people that ever lived. All human existence is dependent on a six or eight inch layer of topsoil. When it is gone, life on this planet will be gone too. Yet through neglect we allow rivers to wash away the equivalent of thousands of acres of top soil annually. Senator Hill insists we can no longer afford this extravagance. We agree. And the whole situation puts us in mind of the story of the two men who were discussing their financial prob- lems. \"I can't afford a car,\" said one of them. \"Why I thought you had one,\" replied the friend. \"I do,\" said the first guy, \"that's how I know I can't afford one.\" • * * THE WAY IT SEEMS In this day and age, everything seems to grow by leaps and bounds. This is particu- larly true of the children in the apartment overhead. \"Shall I turn him loose, Chief? He hooked a loaf of bread bul his assistant ale all the evidence!\" 20 The Million Dollar Monsters • • SOMETIME when the winter wind is blowing and your fingers are so stiff from the cold you can hardly hold your hammer, give a thought to the Alaska crab fishermen before you start feeling too sorry for yourself. There are fellows who really battle the elements in their work. However, they provide the tables of the nation with a succulent and nutritious food. How the industry developed is an interesting story in itself. The year 1941 will always live in the memory of a man named Lowell Wakefield, son of an Alaska family long engaged in the business of herring fishing. That was the year he first saw \"haystacks\" in the sea, off the storm buffeted island of Kodiak. There appeared at low-tide a phenomenon wit- 1 nessed on rare occasions by fishermen off the lonely coasts around Alaska and the Bering Sea— hundreds of giant King Crabs, piled one on top of an- other in a huge pyramid— how or why, even the most eggheaded students of creatures of the deep have never been able to explain. The Kodiak islanders gathered the beached giants and had a memorable THE CARPENTER 21 crabfest. The meat of the claws and legs proved to be more delicate than lobster and astonishingly flavorsome. Wakefield's imagination was fired by the incident. These scores of fabulous crabs were a type seldom seen in the area, vicious-clawed monsters, some of them measuring six feet from tip to tip. As it turned out, he was destined to pioneer from these ugly eight- legged creatures, a $6 million industry never before essayed by an American. He sent some specimens to the Fish and Wildlife Service in Seattle. \"These are delicious,\" he said, \"but what kind of crabs are they?\" Veterans of the Wildlife Service identified them as Paralithodes camts- chatica, specimens of the King Crab, a giant crustacean peculiar to the North Pacific. When World War II ended. Captain Wakefield decided to go a-crabbing. The Japanese with their floating canneries had been crab fishing commercially for years. Wake- field had a better idea— not canning, but freezing the delicious meat of the crabs taken fresh from the sea. With money raised by the sale of stock in his new venture, plus an RFC loan, he had a specially designed 140-foot trawler, the Deep Sea, built with the hull of an icebreaker and out- fitted it as a seagoing modern process- ing and freezing plant. Zero degree storage space equalled that of eleven refrigerator cars. Her quarters com- fortably accommodated twenty-two men. She was equipped with war- time-perfected radar and sonar and all the modern gear possible to make the venture successful and profitable. She represented an enormous invest- ment for the one-time herring fisher- man. He formed a new company, Wakefield's Deep Sea Trawlers, Inc., and sailed off to make his fortune in the costliest fishing vessel ever to fly the American flag. His first crew consisted of seasoned Alaska and Seattle fishermen, some of them former Navy and Merchant offi- cers, and six Aleuts from Akutan who were experienced whalers. They trawled the sea with nets of hand- made Irish hemp 150 feet long and 120 feet wide. One-ton flat doors at- tached on either side kept the face of a net open, planing out as the Deep Sea moved. In this way, they brought in 300 to 800 crabs an hour, towing at 100 fathoms. As the crabs were hauled aboard, they were dumped into \"live\" tanks of circulating sea water where, re- moved from the mighty pressure of the sea, they became sluggish and manageable. They were then washed, placed into wire baskets and plunged immediately into bofling sea water and cooked. After cooTcing, the meat was removed, frozen in blocks and, as an extra insurance to perfection, covered with a freezing glaze of fresh, clear water. The Deep Sea could freeze and store 170 tons of crab meat. Once loaded, she headed back T III-] C A 11 P 1^: N T E R to port, and the frozen delicacy was transferred to a refrigerated ware- house near Seattle and wrapped for shipment to purchasers throughout the United States. The first three years were rough ones, during which Wakefield strug- gled to create a market. By 1950, the battle began to pay off. Fine restau- rants were buying Wakefield's new frozen crab heavih', and it had made its first appearance in grocery stores. Two years later, Captain Wakefield was face-to-face with a brand new problem— demand threatened to ex- ceed the supply. He made a quick decision that seemed foolhardy along the Seattle waterfront. He decided to risk a win- ter voyage to the Bering, The Deep Sea was the only fishing vessel under- writers ever insured for winter voy- ages, but even she had always kept to port in January and February. At midnight, on January 22, 1953, the motor trawler Deep Sea cast off mooring lines in Seattle and cleared for the Bering fishing grounds, her destination a point 60 miles north of the Alaska Peninsula, midway be- tween the Pribolofs and Bristol Bay. She planned to venture north through Unimak Pass, a feat no commercial vessel had ever before attempted in the dead of winter. The trip across the North Pacific was rough but uneventful. They stopped for fuel and water at False Pass, Alaska, on the thirty-first and two days later they took on three more crew members at the village of Akutan to make up a full twenty-two man complement. Early in the morn- ing, February 4, they reached their destination and began fishing opera- tions. It was clear, calm and cold. They made two prospecting hauls without success, but the third trawl showed promise. Then it began to blow, and for five full days all hands fought the fury of the Arctic. It was a norther, 80 miles an hour fresh from the Polar ice cap, and the temperature was mi- nus 14. Each sea crashing over the ship added to the tons of ice forming on decks, superstructure and rigging, and the men chopped and beat at it with axes, crowbars and clubs day and night to prevent capsizing. On the tenth, the wind swung to the southwest and moderated to a gentle breeze. Air temperature climbed to 22 degrees. A net was dug out from under two feet of solid ice, and went over the side for a one-hour tow. As it was lifted alongside the ship, jammed to the wings with eight or ten thousand crabs, it was carried away from the sheer weight of the enormous creatures, and net and haul were lost. A new net was bent on, and trawl- ing operations continued. They end- ed up packing to maximum capacity —15,000 pounds of King Crab legs and claws a day. Captain Wakefield THECARPENTER 23 had accomplished his purpose. His vessels and twenty-five trawlers oper- hard-earned market had an unfailing/^ ating under contract. They hunt the year-round supply of King Crab, as crabs by radar and use a radar buoy promised. as a \"pip\" so that they never cover the Today, Wakefield Trawlers, Inc. same spot twice.

By the terms of this legislation enacted last year, administra- tors of health, welfare and pension funds are expected to give an accounting of their stewardship both to the members covered and to the Department of Labor. The government provides forms for making such reports. Here is how the two-step reporting system works: Sometime between January 1 and April 1 the administrators of health, welfare and pension funds— whether administered by labor, management or jointly— must make public a detailed description of such plans as are now in existence. This is step number one. Step number two requires administrators to make a wide-ranging report of contributions received, benefits paid, assets, liabilities, commissions, fees, etc. within 120 days of the closing of the fiscal year. Forms for reporting descriptions of welfare and pension plans (Form D-1) may be obtained in quantities of 50 or less from the following offices of the Wage and Hour and Public Contracts Division of the U. S. Dept. of Labor: 18 Oliver Street, Boston 10, Mass. 900 U. S. Parcel Post Bldg., 341 Ninth Ave., New York 1, N. Y.

Editorial Important Reading — \"This Doctor Business\" A long, hard, unbiased look at the medical profession and the way it op- crates has been overdue. Now a writer by the name of Richard Carter has done the job in a book called \"This Doctor Business.\" And what Mr. Carter found in his study sometimes is not very pretty. The medical profession, Mr. Carter found, is a hide-bound, rigidly con- trolled monopoly dominated by a powerful confederation of medical societies tied closely to the American Medical Association. These societies promulgate the conditions under which doctors can practice, and woe betide the medic who dares to deviate from the prescribed course. Mr. Carter presents a wealth of evidence showing that the organization and financing of medical care are \"so far behind the times that they have .ictually become a deterrent to health.\" People stay away from doctors when they first become sick because the costs involved are frightening. When their ailments become so bad they are forced to seek medical help the routine they are forced to undergo is both needlessly complicated and needlessly ex- pensive. They are shunted from office to office to get X-rays, tests, and exam- inations from specialists. Each step in the process means an additional fee ^^'hich the patient must shell out. This system, Mr. Carter argues, discourages people from seeking medical aid early, when medical help can do the most good. Yet every effort to alter this rigid system of \"individual treatment for a fee\" is vigorously fought by the medical societies. The individual doctor, Mr. Carter finds to be a dedicated, sincere scientist and healer of the ailing. But the hold of the medical societies is so strong he has no choice as to how, when and where he will practice. He must play by the rules laid down by the societies or he is soon frozen out of the game. Mr. Carter argues that rules are devised exclusively by the medical soci- eties; the customers (patients) have little or nothing to say about them. This is the situation that needs correcting, he believes: He sees prepaid medicine as one step in the right direction. Medical plans that combine group prepayment with group medical care can do a lot to im- prove the medical care most people in modest circumstances get, he feels. \"Instead of having to trot all over town from family physician to specialist to X-ray man to laboratory to Lord-knows-where, paying a separate fee at e\\ery stop,\" he writes, \"the patient goes to one place where his health is com- prehensively managed by physicians who patrol each other's performance. And there are rarely extra fees.\" This kind of service, Mr. Carter maintains, offers ordinary people the best bet for getting decent medical care. He does not claim that it is the answer to all medical prol^lems, but he feels that it would give more people a TIIECARPENTEK 25 chance to avail themselves of the appallingly expensive medical care that today's complex medical procedures often entail. But, most important of all, he believes such system places all the emphasis on keeping the patient well. \"The physicians do not rely on payments from the sick and have no finan- cial stake in sickness,\" the author points out. \"On the contrary, they have a great stake in health. The patient, having agreed to pay a fixed annual fee that entitles him and his family to complete medical care, no longer has to make a financial decision every time he wonders whether he should see a doctor. \"The physicians, meanwhile, are nagging him to come around whether he feels sick or not. They feel a pressing need to diagnose and arrest the diabetes, the glaucoma, the early tuberculosis, the beginning of cancer, the high blood pressure, the arthritis and the hundred and one other conditions which if allowed to develop unattended, can make a wastefully serious case of him. \"To them serious illness is no longer a source of income but a financial loss. If tlie illness is one that could have been nipped in the bud by early diagnosis, it is more than a financial loss— it is a professional reproach, an emblem of failure.\" Yet this is the kind of medical programing that medical societies oppose most bitterly. They object to anything other than the individual fee system now prevailing. Organized labor has pioneered in promoting prepaid medicine. What good plans exist came about through union pressure. All union members interested in better health services at reasonable cost should read \"This Doctor Business.\" The book is published by Doubleday and Company. Today's Kids Think For Themselves The National Association of Manufacturers and the U. S. Chamber of Commerce spend vast sums providing free materials for elementary schools and high schools. However, not all high school students swallow the thinly- disguised NAM and USCC propaganda. Many of them think for themselves. Witness the case of 16-year old John Noonan of St. Patrick High School, Orange, N. J. Recently he won an essay contest and a $25 award for a piece he wrote against right-to-work. His piece was printed in THE NEWS. It is reprinted here as an example of the kind of independent thinking today's crop of high school students indulge in. ON THE RIGHT TO WORK By John Noonan, St. Patrick HS, Junior With Congress so conscious of the fact that labor legislation must be enacted when it reconvenes, an understanding of the effects that a so-called right to work bill would have on economic activity must be considered essen- tial. First of all, the title is a misnomer, for such a bill would give no one the right to work; what it would do is clearly stated in Virginia's law: \"No person shall be required by an employer to become a member of a labor union as a condition of employment.\" 26 T H E C A It P E N T E R Yet the bill is not as innocent as it may sound, for its real efiFect would be to destroy legitimate unionism in the United States. Proponents of the bill would permit all workers to enjoy all the privileges of unionism with only a few paying dues. Soon, of course, the latter group would withdraw. It might also be worthy to note that the chief advocates of the bill are the U. S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, whose long record of attempting to wreck the labor movement in tliis country under the guise of promoting individual liberty is well known. The main controversy over the union shop seems to be that it may con- stitute an infringement on man's individual rights. The Supreme Court, how- ever, has unanimously ruled that the closed shop does not violate the Bill of Rights or any other basic freedom. What does a right to work law do about cleaning up corruption in a union? Nothing. In fact, it can actually strengthen a racketeer's hold by causing the withdrawal of honest dues-paying members. Workers bound by a union shop contract are far less powerless. They may vote the corrupt officials out of power, they may appeal to the AFL-CIO ethical practices committee or they may appeal to the NLRB. All three courses, however, require united action, which is not likely to be had in an open shop. Therefore, I hope, that in an effort to improve labor relations in America voters will not be duped by attractive phrases into destroying the most impor- tant check in our economic system— the labor union. Let's Try Atomic Excavation A cloak of reality has suddenly enveloped the seemingly far-fetched dream of using nuclear explosions for construction excavation. Reason: the alto- gether serious proposal made by the scientists of the Plowshare project— who directed the underground explosions program on the Nevada desert- that a harbor be excavated in Alaska by nuclear detonations. What the scientists claim can be done staggers the imagination. A single megaton bomb buried at a depth of 150 ft., can blow out a 3,000 ft. diameter crater. Then by exploding four 100-kiloton bombs, which have been prop- erly spaced and buried to a depth of 50 ft., this crater can be connected to the sea by a mile-long channel 1,200 ft. wide. Presto! You have a protected harbor. Such a possibility begs for a try. The U. S. will be dismally negligent if it permits the atomic test-ban negotiations now under way in Geneva with the Russians to stymie testing for peaceful purposes. This is all the more clear in view of the hopeful beliefs of our scientists that the dangers from direct radiation, heat, air blast, ground shock and fallout radio-activity can be re- duced to acceptable levels in such a blast. What matters if no need can be found for a new harbor on the remote coast of Alaska? Here would be a shot heard around the world in the interest of peaceful uses of a great new energy source. What matters if it costs quite a few million dollars? Measured against the many millions already spent on atomic testing it would be a small price for the knowledge gained. THECARPENTER 27 Should the harbor project be undertaken and should it prove the practic- ability of atomic excavation, where could the process be used? One possibility would be for a new Atlantic-Pacific canal in some presently remote area of Nicaragua, Panama or Colombia. Studies now under way to update the cost estimates for increasing the capacity of the Panama Canal by conventional construction methods may turn up some surprisingly high prices. Atomic blasting might be a good deal cheaper. Using hydrogen bombs would be cheaper yet if some way can be devised to set them off without the necessity of priming each one with an expensive atomic device, say by sympathetic detonation— as is possible with dynamite. In any event, tliis is the kind of question that could be studied and the kind of project that might be made possible if the Alaskan harbor experiment is undertaken. Neither tlie Geneva talks nor lack of imagination here in the U. S. should be allowed to prevent it.— (Engineering News-Record, Dec. 11, 1958) • The Job Is Only Half Done In the November election organized labor did a terrific job at the polls. For the first time in eight or 10 years a very substantial number of liberal Senators and Representatives were elected. But getting good men elected is only half the job. The other half is to see that they get the kind of support they need to get decent legislation passed. The fact that we got many good men elected is well and good; now we must finish the job by backing them adequately when the right kind of bills are hanging in the balance. In the months ahead many bills of vital importance will be presented to Congress. There will be bills to amend the Taft-Hartley law to eliminate the section which makes state right-to-work laws possible. There will be bills to nullify the section of the law that gives strike-breakers the right to vote in NLRB elections while strikers are denied the same privilege. There will be bills to permit pre-hire contracts in construction and make Davis-Bacon pro- visions automatic in all construction financed in whole or in part by Federal funds. There will be bills to raise social security benefits to realistic levels and provide medical and nursing home care for pensioners. There will be bills to raise the levels of unemployment insurance and make benefit schedules uniform throughout the states. There will be bills to raise the minimum wage to at least $1.25 an hour. There will be bills to encourage more housing and schools and hospitals. There will be bills to aid depressed areas to get back on their feet. AU these things are of vital importance to all working people. Every one of them that is adopted will add to the prosperity, comfort and security of working people. However, few of them will be passed unless there is a tremendous groundswell of public demand. The liberal Congressmen who introduce the bills will not get very far unless they are backed up by a solid support from the grass roots level. The first part of the job— getting good men elected— we did well. Now let's finish the job by giving these men the support they need to get the kind of liberal program we want and need put over. 28 A Better Day Is Conning AS THE YEAR 1959 gets under way there are many indications that better /-\\ days are ahead for organized labor. For the past five or six years the ■^ -^fortunes of the labor movement have been at low ebb. Unions have been under attack from many sides. Newspaper publicity has been bad. The whole labor movement has been tarred with the brush that should have been reserved for the guilty few actually convicted of wrong-doing. There has been a tendency on the part of the NLRB to hand down adverse rulings against unions. Court decisions have seldom been favorable. Right- to-work laws have been thrown at labor in many states. In the political arena progressive candidates have had tough sledding. All this has resulted in a diminished luster for organized labor. Now the tide seems to be turning once more. Despite the current reces- sion which makes workers more cau- tious about joining unions for fear of losing their jobs, the percentage of workers voting for unions is on the upgrade. For the first time in several years, NLRB figures for the third quarter of 1958 showed a healthy increase in the percentage of workers voting for union representation. In that period, unions won 68% of all union represen- tation elections. This was achieved in spite of NLRB hostility, in spite of the recession, in spite of the introduc- tion of race questions by many em- ployers. In NLRB elections held during the third quarter of last year, some 78,000 workers voted for union repre- sentation in spite of the unfriendly climate promoted and fostered by those who want to see unions smashed. This was more than double the figure for the first quarter of 1958, which saw only 37,513 workers vote in favor of union representation. From the foregoing it can be as- sumed that workers are beginning to see through the propaganda which employer groups have been using to discourage union organization. With millions still unorganized, a gain of 78,000 in a three-month period is nothing to shout from the housetops about but it cannot be construed as being anything but a favorable straw in the wind. On many other other fronts, too, there are indications that the for- tunes of organized labor are on the upgrade once more. In last November's election right- to-work laws were roundly defeated in five out of six states. Organized labor did a wonderful job of getting its members out to vote, but the job was not done by labor alone. In Ohio and California and Washington and other beleaguered states hundreds of thousands of people not in the labor movement added their votes to the labor vote to send right-to-work down to defeat. In spite of what the unfriendly papers say, organized labor has a sub- stantial coterie of staunch friends within the general public. The No- vember vote proved the point beyond the shadow of a doubt. THE CARPENTER 29 The November election also proved that liberalism is not the dead issue some conservatives tried to make it appear. Generally speaking labor elected more friends in November, 1958, than in any election in a nvimber of years. For the first time for quite awhile, the new Congress will include more than a sprinkling of men under- standing of and sympathetic to the aims and aspirations of organized labor. In the legal field, too, labor is mak- ing some gains again. The recent Court of Appeals decision upsetting an NLRB ruling which restricted the right of unions to picket for recogni- tion plowed new furrows in the area of organizing. Year by year the NLRB has tended to hem in the con- ditions under which unions could pic- ket. The Court of Appeals decision is the first real reversal of this trend in some time. The NLRB was also reversed in a case involving hotel workers recently. For a long time the NLRB has refused to assume jurisdiction in cases involv- ing hotel workers. But a Supreme Court decision upset this NLRB rul- ing last month. The way is now open for organization of hotel workers. All the foregoing are important vic- tories for labor. However, there is no room for complacency or self-satis- faction. The right-to-work forces are not going to quit because they were clobbered in five states. They will be back working in new states two years or four years from now. The newspapers are not going to pass up opportunities to besmirch la- bor just because workers are voting in favor of union representation again. The conservative candidates are not going to change their tune because liberal men are winning elections again. The NLRB is not going to re- verse its policies because a few court decisions upset its findings. In fact, all the anti-labor forces are going to work harder than ever to make up for the ground they have lost. If organized labor decides to rest on its laurels, they will be quick to capitalize on tlie situation. The year 1959 is off to an auspicious start, but it will remain a good year for labor only if unions and union members keep plugging away at building the kind of solidarity and militancy that paid off in 1958. UNIONS KEEP WAGES UP DESPITE RECESSION Washington— Union negotiators, despite the recession, persuaded employers in the first half of 1958 to grant wage increases only a shade smaller than in the first six months of last year, according to the current issue of the AFL-CIO's Collective Bargaining Report. The most frequent pay boosts have ranged from 8 to 11 cents an hour. In addition, the steady liberalization of fringe benefits continued during the period. Here is what the study showed on wage hikes: 1. More than a qviarter of the increases were 13 cents or more an hour. 2. Nearly 55 per cent provided 10 cents or more. 3. Only about 20 per cent were at the 4 to 6 cents scale, and a scant 2 per cent yielded token increases of 1 to 3 cents. 4. About 7 per cent of all settlements, mostly in long-depressed industries, provided for no increases. Bargaining on fringe benefits, the Report survey shows produced improvements in health and welfare benefits in more than one-third of the settlements; better pension plans in 15 to 20 per cent of the agreements; improved vacation in more than 25 per cent, and an additional one or two paid holidays in an estimated 20 per cent.
