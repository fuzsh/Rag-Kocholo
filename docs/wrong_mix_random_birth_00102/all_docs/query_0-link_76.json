The political landscape was transformed by a series of revolutions fought in the name of liberty–most notably in the Americas and France, of course, but elsewhere, too: in Holland and Geneva during the eighteenth century and across much of mainland Europe by 1848. Nor was change confined to the European world. New ideas of freedom, equality and human rights were carried to the furthest outposts of empire, to Egypt, India and the Caribbean, which saw the creation in 1801 of the first black republic in Haiti, the former French colony of SaintDomingue. And in the early part of the nineteenth century they continued to inspire anti-colonial and liberation movements throughout Central and Latin America. If political and social institutions were transformed by revolution in these years, so, too, was warfare. During the quarter-century of the French revolutionary wars, in particular, Europe was faced with the prospect of ‘total’ war, on a scale unprecedented before the twentieth century. Military hardware, it is true, evolved only gradually, and battles were not necessarily any bloodier than they had been during the Seven Years War. But in other ways these can legitimately be described as the first modern wars, fought by mass armies mobilized by national and patriotic propaganda, leading to the displacement of millions of people throughout Europe and beyond, as soldiers, prisoners of war, civilians and refugees. For those who lived through the period these wars would be a formative experience that shaped the ambitions and the identities of a generation. The aims of the series are necessarily ambitious. In its various volumes, whether single-authored monographs or themed collections, it seeks to extend the scope of more traditional historiography. It will study warfare during this formative century not just in Europe, but in the Americas, in colonial societies, and across the world. It will analyse the construction of identities and power relations by integrating the principal categories of difference, most notably class and religion, generation and gender, race and ethnicity. It will adopt a multifaceted approach to the period, and turn to methods of political, cultural, social, military and gender history, in order to develop a challenging and multidisciplinary analysis. Finally, it will examine elements of comparison and transfer and so tease out the complexities of regional, national and global history.\n\nvii\n\n10.1057/9780230282698 - War, Empire and Slavery, 1770-1830, Edited by Richard Bessel, Nicholas Guyatt and Jane Rendall 9780230_229891_01_prexviii.indd vii\n\n8/5/2010 1:07:42 PM\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Feng Chia University - PalgraveConnect - 2011-04-17\n\nRafe Blaufarb, Alan Forrest and Karen Hagemann\n\nThis volume arises from the conference ‘War, Empire and Slavery, 1790– 1820’, held at The King’s Manor, University of York, UK, 16–18 May 2008. This was one in a series of international conferences organized by the AngloGerman research group on ‘Nations, Borders, Identities: The Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars in European Experiences and Memories’. It was also the Eighth Cultural History Conference of the Department of History, University of York. We would like to thank Mette Harder and Clare Bond for the skilled administration which made this such an enjoyable event. At the conference 35 scholars from 13 different countries presented papers, and for this volume we selected 13 to be rewritten for publication. We would like to thank the Arts and Humanities Research Council and the History Department for the funding which made the conference possible. We would also like to thank all those who participated in it for their stimulating presentations and contributions to discussion, and the contributors to this volume for their willingness to collaborate in the lengthy editorial process. We are grateful to Reginald Piggott for preparing the maps, to James Walvin for giving so generously of his time and expertise and to Alan Forrest for his support throughout the preparation of the book.

For Eric Hobsbawm, they formed an ‘age of revolution’; for Christopher Bayly, they witnessed a ‘world crisis’ and a series of ‘converging revolutions’; Reinhart Koselleck has described them as a ‘Sattelzeit’ (saddle period) during which modern ways of thinking took shape against a backdrop of accelerated political, economic and social transformation.1 These dramatic changes, including the emergence of new forms of statehood and of nationalism, and major shifts in global power relations, were partly forged in the crucible of imperial wars fought around the globe by European powers: principally France, Great Britain, Spain, Portugal and the Netherlands. The Seven Years War might claim the distinction of being the first worldwide war. But the American War of Independence, in which the same European rivals were engaged, established an independent nation and a durable model of citizenship. As Jürgen Osterhammel observes in his recent panoramic history of the global nineteenth century, ‘the great conflict between the empires in the years between 1793 and 1815 did not remain limited to Europe. It was fought out on four continents: a true world war.’2 The military and political conflicts between France, Britain and their allies from 1793 to 1815 were larger and more diffuse than earlier wars, and were truly far-reaching in their effects and legacies. 3 They triggered independence movements among black slaves in Saint Domingue and creole settlers in Portuguese and Spanish America, and their direct impact extended to Egypt, Southeast Asia, southern Africa, Java and the Philippines.4 But these years of war, and the reception of European ideas, have also to be understood in relation to parallel and separate developments elsewhere. The autonomous crises and tensions within the established empires of Asia had also to do with their military strengths and weaknesses, and with different forms of resistance, ideological and political, to imperial authorities. Across the world, governments were affected by the financial burdens of warfare.5 1\n\n10.1057/9780230282698 - War, Empire and Slavery, 1770-1830, Edited by Richard Bessel, Nicholas Guyatt and Jane Rendall 9780230_229891_02_int.indd 1\n\n4/11/2010 10:08:34 AM\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Feng Chia University - PalgraveConnect - 2011-04-17\n\nRichard Bessel, Nicholas Guyatt and Jane Rendall\n\nWar, Empire and Slavery, 1770–1830\n\nThe aspirations and struggles of empires had worldwide ramifications. They changed the ways in which people understood their place in that world—not just in the form of reactions to new European conceptions of the state and the citizen, but also in complex interactions with different conceptions and aspirations across the non-European world. The revolutionary content of the age of revolution cannot be traced simply in terms of European political ideologies: these were also cultural revolutions (the word ‘culture’ was first used during the 1770s6) and revolutions in identity, brought about through decades of experience of war across the globe. Yet there were continuities as well as changes; in many areas of the globe, imperial authorities were strengthened and monarchies were reaffirmed. Social, racial and gender distinctions could be powerfully reinscribed as well as challenged. It was an age of complex transitions as well as of potential transformation. The themes of war, empire and slavery provide the framework and rationale for this book. The chapters are focused not on Paris, Berlin and Vienna, but on Buenos Aires, St Louis and Tehran; they are stories of how the global upheavals of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries shaped and were shaped by individuals, societies and cultures around the world.\n\nPart I: A world in upheaval A state of war is the historical context for the chapters included in this book and lies at the foreground of the lived experiences which they describe. Throughout much of the eighteenth century, European states had jostled for imperial advantage through military engagements in Europe, naval and military battles over imperial territories, and trading rivalries across the world. At the same time the land-based empire of Russia continued, at an accelerating pace, to extend its dominance through the absorption of new territories—including southern Finland, Ukraine, the Crimea, and successive Polish lands—and in settlements extending to the Pacific and beyond. Britain, France, Spain, Portugal and the Netherlands had already established their maritime empires in Asia, Africa and America by the beginning of the eighteenth century. Their colonies took different forms, as in the extensive territories in South America formally governed by Spain, the trading outposts of Britain in India, or the plantation-based sugar islands of the French colonial system in the Caribbean. But as an essential part of their imperial enterprise, all these powers were involved in the trading of slaves and the expansion of slave-based plantation economies. By the time of the Seven Years War, fought between 1756 and 1763, the extent of global warfare and its related costs had come to affect both the prestige and the financial stability of the ancien regime governments of Europe. In the last three decades of the eighteenth century, that warfare assumed a new character, as it brought with it the mobilization of military and naval forces on an unprecedented\n\n10.1057/9780230282698 - War, Empire and Slavery, 1770-1830, Edited by Richard Bessel, Nicholas Guyatt and Jane Rendall 9780230_229891_02_int.indd 2\n\n4/11/2010 10:08:34 AM\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Feng Chia University - PalgraveConnect - 2011-04-17\n\n2\n\nscale, social upheaval and the migration of populations, and a complex association with an emancipatory ideology which appeared to threaten the very existence of the institution of slavery. Christopher Bayly has, in this volume, traced three revolutionary ‘surges’ between 1776 and 1830, which may be associated with the international conflicts which accompanied them. The first arose with the American Revolution, which broke the connection between Britain and thirteen of its American mainland colonies and established a new, independent nation (albeit one which owed its existence to the military and financial assistance of Britain’s imperial rivals, France, Spain and the Netherlands). The second surge, initiated by the French Revolution of 1789, was to bring about more than twenty years of worldwide conflict during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, ending only in 1815; in its early stages the French Revolution offered a model of citizenship which identified military and patriotic duties and which opened a window of possibility for slave emancipation in the French West Indies. When French leaders decided to restore Caribbean slavery in the late 1790s, the momentum of the Haitian Revolution secured national independence as well as emancipation. Even after Napoleon’s defeat in Haiti in 1804, his continuing military ambitions led indirectly to the third revolutionary ‘surge’, dating from the French invasions of Spain and Portugal in 1806 and 1807. Napoleon’s usurpation emboldened local elites throughout Spain’s extensive possessions in Latin America; the spread of nationalist aspirations made it impossible for Spain to resist these distant challengers even after the restoration of the monarchy in 1814. Meanwhile, the evacuation of the Portuguese court to Brazil in 1807 allowed for the survival of the royal house in exile, but eventually led to the establishment of an independent nation and a new imperial dynasty under the direction of the Portuguese prince regent, Dom Pedro. The familiar narrative of a clash of European empires and the emergence of new nations can be reoriented by considering the parallel histories of non-European powers. Bayly has noted the extent of the internal changes within the great Muslim empires—Ottoman, Safavid and Mughal—in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. There, in the eighteenth century, the growth in power of provincial elites and the strength of local revolts—of Afghans in Persia and India, Wahhabis in Saudi Arabia and Sikhs in the Punjab—challenged established empires. It has been argued that these emerging regional dynasties helped to create a sense of local solidarity, culture and identity some time before western definitions of the ‘nation’ emerged.7 The outcome of collisions with European empires, and of the spread of revolutionary ideas, was conditioned as much by these developments as by European imperial initiatives. In this volume Joanna de Groot presents the 1790s as a period in which Iran’s Qajar rulers, successors to the Safavid\n\n10.1057/9780230282698 - War, Empire and Slavery, 1770-1830, Edited by Richard Bessel, Nicholas Guyatt and Jane Rendall 9780230_229891_02_int.indd 3\n\n4/11/2010 10:08:35 AM\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Feng Chia University - PalgraveConnect - 2011-04-17\n\nIntroduction 3\n\nWar, Empire and Slavery, 1770–1830\n\ndynasty, consolidated and developed their rule to such an extent that they met the British and Russian expansion on their borders with confidence. In similar vein, Laurent Dubois suggests that knowledge of the histories of the different peoples of western and West Central Africa—including their attitudes to kingship, religion and African slave-trading—is essential to an understanding of military conflict and emancipation in the Caribbean during our period. Although slaves were distributed widely in the process of sale, where more than a few were concentrated together in the New World the possibilities for solidarity and cultural transfer were considerable. Throughout the Americas, the ethnic balance among different African peoples was a significant factor in determining the cultural and religious practices and political expectations of those enslaved. The African military experiences which slaves brought with them also helped to shape the success of runaway communities and the aspirations of rebels.8 The increased numbers of those transported from Africa in the eighteenth century, and especially from the 1770s, often ‘Africanized’ or ‘re-Africanized’ certain areas, although this varied widely depending on survival and reproduction rates and the proportion of creole to African-born in the population. John Thornton has emphasized that ‘African-born peoples, socialized and bearing African culture, were often the majority in American societies’.9 On the other hand, a relatively short-lived ‘African’ period, as was the case in much of North America, helped to encourage the growth of creole languages, which bridged those spoken by different African and colonial peoples and hastened the emergence of a native creole-speaking population.10 Although the conflicts and upheavals of these years of global war by no means affected all the participants equally, by 1830 many areas of the world appeared significantly changed. Some major powers could be counted, on balance, as winners from the experience. The Russian Empire had expanded very considerably; during the Napoleonic Wars, it won the whole of Finland, Georgia, Bessarabia and the Congress Kingdom of Poland. Though Russia also suffered the traumatic invasion of its territory, this experience strengthened a growing sense of national identity. The British Empire established a worldwide naval dominance and acquired new territories by conquest and treaty in the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean (including Ceylon, Mauritius and southern Africa). Britain’s rule, and indirect influence, in India and beyond continued to expand, as in the attack on Burma in 1824. The increasingly imperial and authoritarian nature of the British state was reflected in the new forms of government devised for such possessions. At the same time, the revolt of Haiti and the abolition of the slave trade in 1807 had significant effects on British prosperity: temporarily the British West Indian colonies benefited from the collapse of France’s most lucrative colony, and their superiority increased the contribution of the West India trade to British economic strength during wartime. But the events of the 1790s pointed towards the dangers of overdependence on the unstable\n\n10.1057/9780230282698 - War, Empire and Slavery, 1770-1830, Edited by Richard Bessel, Nicholas Guyatt and Jane Rendall 9780230_229891_02_int.indd 4\n\n4/11/2010 10:08:35 AM\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Feng Chia University - PalgraveConnect - 2011-04-17\n\n4\n\nislands of the Caribbean, while the growing agitation for the abolition of the slave trade suggested a precarious future for British commerce in the Americas. By the end of the Napoleonic Wars the future of British imperial expansion appeared to lie in a turn towards the east.11 The new nation of the United States also made clear territorial gains: in the Great Lakes, after wars with Britain in 1783 and 1815; the enormous area of western territory encompassed by the Louisiana Purchase (1803); and Florida (1810–1819). The expanding republic also succeeded in establishing a growing share in the regional trade of the Americas, and in international commerce more generally. The French colonial empire, on the other hand, had almost disappeared by 1815, with only two West Indian islands, Guadeloupe and Martinique; Senegal in West Africa; Bourbon in the Indian Ocean; and a few trading posts in India remaining under French control. France also suffered the loss of its naval power and the heavy burden of a war indemnity. The French invasion of Algeria in 1830 represented a delayed attempt to re-establish imperial standing. The Spanish Empire was similarly depleted by the conflicts. By 1815 many of the former Spanish colonies were already in a semiautonomous state, and the wars of independence over the next six years produced a cascade of new nations: Rio de la Plata (1816), Chile (1817), Gran Colombia (1819), Peru (1821) and Mexico (1821). Within 15 years of Napoleon’s invasion of the Iberian Peninsula, Spain’s vast empire had been reduced to Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines. Portugal fared little better. Brazil renounced Portuguese authority in 1822, partly because the monarch Dom João—who had pledged to secure equality for Brazil within the empire during his exile in Rio—had been unable to keep his promise after his return to Portugal in 1821. João lost his largest imperial possession, but the Portuguese retained control over Angola and Mozambique, and also Timor, Macao, and a few Indian outposts including Goa. Although this was an era of sweeping changes and realignments in the posture and pretensions of European empires, these stories of territorial exchange tell us little of the complex ways in which wars were experienced. These wars were also local events, affecting not only soldiers—slave and free, white, black and mixed race—but also the enslaved more generally, indigenous populations, freed men and women, white settlers and civilians, and colonial elites. The impact of warfare could be catastrophic and dramatic. The mortality rates of European armies in the Caribbean campaigns of the 1790s were immensely high; of the 89,000 British soldiers deployed there between 1793 and 1801, over 45,000 died from disease.12 David Geggus has written that ‘the French Revolutionary War differed from previous wars in the Caribbean, partly because it combined traditional imperial rivalries with a bitter civil war and exceptional racial struggle’.13 The brutality of these conflicts, involving as they could torture, executions and massacres (as in the campaign fought by the Napoleonic Army against black soldiers\n\n10.1057/9780230282698 - War, Empire and Slavery, 1770-1830, Edited by Richard Bessel, Nicholas Guyatt and Jane Rendall 9780230_229891_02_int.indd 5\n\n4/11/2010 10:08:35 AM\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Feng Chia University - PalgraveConnect - 2011-04-17\n\nIntroduction 5\n\nWar, Empire and Slavery, 1770–1830\n\nand guerrillas in Saint Domingue), was noted by contemporaries. Even for those not directly involved in war, defeat could bring forced removal. Thousands of American Loyalists, both white and black, left the newly independent United States in 1782 and 1783 for Canada, London or the Caribbean, among other places. And significant numbers of people, royalist and republican, black and white, fled Saint Domingue and Santo Domingo for other Caribbean and mainland destinations. Demobilized black soldiers were likely to be relocated without choice by Britain and Spain, frequently to Central America, rather than resettled as slaves. At the other side of the world, Cossacks were forcibly removed by the Russian government, and dispatched as military settlers to the Caucasus, Siberia, and the Chinese frontier. Nevertheless, not all the encounters traced in this volume took the form of direct armed conflicts, or were so obviously disruptive. They include the regular maintenance of ‘oases of Russianness’ such as the Far Eastern military garrison of Gizhiga, described here by Janet Hartley, and the echoes of events in France found in the revolutionary assemblies and radical groups in Indian cities such as Chandernagore and Calcutta, recalled by Christopher Bayly. Joanna de Groot draws upon the diplomatic missions exchanged between Iranian cities and the capitals of western Europe, which brought two-way reflections and perspectives on such cultural encounters. Recovering such local and individual experiences is a difficult enterprise, requiring sensitive reading of sometimes intransigent source-materials, including legal records and petitions, and the practices of popular rituals and festivals, as well as memoirs, diaries and correspondence, and the images of high art, to recover the histories of the less literate as well as the educated during years of war and social upheaval.14 The period discussed in this volume may be referred to as an ‘age of revolution’, yet it was also an age of continuing warfare, with associated patterns of social upheaval, enslavement, rebellion and the movement of populations. Alejandro Rabinovich here traces individual perceptions of the process of militarization that took place in the city of Buenos Aires with the arrival of a British expeditionary force in 1806, and the emergence of a ‘warrior society’ among the free population of the city, including black and mulatto free men. This volume focuses on the many different ways in which the wars of these years were experienced; on how that central imperial institution, slavery, was affected; and on the discursive construction of new identities—national, imperial, racial and gendered—in the course of war and upheaval.\n\nPart II: Freedom and captivity Historians have long been fascinated by the coincidence of antislavery movements and political revolutions in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and it is difficult to resist the lure of a direct connection between\n\n10.1057/9780230282698 - War, Empire and Slavery, 1770-1830, Edited by Richard Bessel, Nicholas Guyatt and Jane Rendall 9780230_229891_02_int.indd 6\n\n4/11/2010 10:08:35 AM\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Feng Chia University - PalgraveConnect - 2011-04-17\n\n6\n\nrevolutionary ideology and emancipation. Antislavery campaigns in England and France developed in the 1780s alongside Enlightenment thinking about human rights and political equality, and the French Revolution set off a wave of revolts and citizenship struggles in the Caribbean and elsewhere. Meanwhile, slavery came under concerted attack throughout the northern United States in the two decades after 1783, when the rubric of equality enshrined in the Declaration of Independence caused even some southern slaveholders to question the longevity of their way of life.15 However, the chapters in this book warn against the assumption of a simple, causal relationship between revolutionary ideas and antislavery movements. War was the most important determinant of the uprisings and emancipations of this era. While transnational networks of abolitionism emerged between the American and French revolutions, uniting activists in London, Paris and Philadelphia around the idea that the institution of slavery was headed towards extinction, the wars that accompanied the struggles in France and America disrupted these networks and retarded the progress of a global antislavery movement. Marie-Jeanne Rossignol describes in this volume the career of Jacques-Pierre Brissot, the French intellectual who hoped to sustain the ‘great international movement against slavery’ but who struggled to coordinate his colleagues overseas in the face of resurgent nationalisms after 1790. Brissot’s dreams were eventually dashed by the hostilities between France, Britain and the United States, but warfare had a rather different effect on emancipation in a variety of local contexts between 1770 and 1830. If protracted conflict acted as a brake on the emergence of an antislavery international, it created numerous openings in which forced labour systems might be challenged on the ground. The French Assembly was effectively coerced by events into offering citizenship to gens de couleur (free people of colour) and freedom to slaves in Saint Domingue in 1793, and the British followed a pragmatic policy of military emancipation both in their attempts to suppress the American Revolution and in their Caribbean wars of the 1790s. In Virginia in 1775, or in South Carolina or Georgia after 1778, American slaves were more likely to regard the British than the Americans as the bearers of freedom. In Saint Domingue, meanwhile, the legacy of African experiences shaped the uprisings as surely as a European revolutionary impulse: around two-thirds of the slave population in 1789 had been born across the Atlantic, and what became the Haitian Revolution owed much to the diverse religious practices, cultural relations and military conflicts of late eighteenth-century West and Central Africa.16 In France and Britain, emancipation was set on a kind of double track during this period: alongside the formal efforts of Brissot, William Wilberforce in Britain and the Pennsylvania Quakers to curb the impact of slavery, either through the campaign against the slave trade or through an incipient abolitionism, politicians and commanders developed military emancipation into a crucial weapon. If Charleston or Le Cap might be secured by promising\n\n10.1057/9780230282698 - War, Empire and Slavery, 1770-1830, Edited by Richard Bessel, Nicholas Guyatt and Jane Rendall 9780230_229891_02_int.indd 7\n\n4/11/2010 10:08:35 AM\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Feng Chia University - PalgraveConnect - 2011-04-17\n\nIntroduction 7\n\nWar, Empire and Slavery, 1770–1830\n\nfreedom to blacks in return for imperial allegiance, slaves could be liberated in their tens of thousands without recourse to egalitarian or humanitarian arguments. Christopher Brown has traced the taproots of an ‘empire without slaves’ in the writing of late eighteenth-century British administrators, but the career of military emancipation suggests that the immediate pressure of warfare provided the most immediate context for the sweeping rebellions and manumissions of the period. Commanders and political leaders could not always control the slave revolts that took place throughout the European empires, but they were able to consider selective emancipation without imagining that the institution of slavery itself was obsolete.17 The French colony of Saint Domingue was the epicentre of the antislavery movement in this period. The emancipation of slaves en masse, culminating in a new nation governed by and for black people, was an arresting novelty both within and beyond the Americas. In the ensuing decades, fears of a Haitian-style rebellion spread wherever Europeans and creoles kept people in bondage: from the American South to Argentina, from Haiti’s neighbouring islands in the Caribbean to the British Cape Colony. In the supposed slavery conspiracy of Buenos Aires in 1795, described in this volume by Lyman Johnson, Spanish authorities grappled with a long-standing nervousness about French revolutionary ideology and a more immediate fear that Saint Domingue’s horrors might be reprised by their own loosely regulated slave population. Under these pressures, compounded by the commercial disruption of the war in Europe, Viceroy Nicolás de Arredondo set loose a campaign of snooping, informing and torture which realized the fears of its sponsors. Both here and in the Cape Colony revolt of 1808, described by Nigel Worden, the authorities restored order without undue difficulty. In the case of Buenos Aires, it is far from clear that there was any conspiracy to begin with. But the mythic power of slave uprisings had been transformed by Saint Domingue; or, more precisely, by the assumption that the French and the Haitian Revolutions had fed one another. The defenders of slavery and empire grappled with the fear that slave uprisings might culminate in independence, and that revolutionary ideas might be applied to non-whites as surely as to whites. The irony of this, as Laurent Dubois points out, is that the uprisings in Saint Domingue only became the Haitian Revolution after the disaffected groups on the island moved through a protracted period of negotiation with France. This process was complicated by the willingness of French representatives on the island to accommodate local concerns without always receiving sanction from Paris, and by the initial appeal of the French monarchy to black insurgents. Toussaint Louverture, the most iconic figure of the Haitian Revolution, was neither a slave nor a proponent of independence when the first uprisings broke out around Le Cap in 1791. He was working for the Spanish, who eyed the chaos in Saint Domingue from neighbouring Santo Domingo and looked to seize\n\n10.1057/9780230282698 - War, Empire and Slavery, 1770-1830, Edited by Richard Bessel, Nicholas Guyatt and Jane Rendall 9780230_229891_02_int.indd 8\n\n4/11/2010 10:08:35 AM\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Feng Chia University - PalgraveConnect - 2011-04-17\n\n8\n\nthe colony while the French guard was down. The French commissioners on the island fought a desperate battle to appease both the gens de couleur and, later, the slaves; this effort resulted in the extension of citizenship to the former and the abolition of slavery throughout the colony by the end of 1793. When Louverture effectively took over Saint Domingue after 1794, he did so as a loyal servant of France. Similarly, thousands of former slaves fought under the French flag to defend the colony from British attack, even while their former masters crossed their fingers that the British invasion would succeed. In the complex and fiery battles over Saint Domingue, national identities and allegiances were dissolved and remade with extraordinary speed. By the end of the 1790s, as Napoleon attempted to overturn the policy of emancipation which had kept Saint Domingue French, Louverture and his associates finally embraced independence. But what emerged from their struggles was less an allegiance to a fixed form of politics or government—monarchy, republic, empire or nation—than ‘absolute adherence’, as Dubois puts it, ‘to the principle that no one should be a slave’. If the Haitian Revolution stands as the greatest antislavery achievement of this period, it was neither a simple triumph of radical ideology nor the prelude to a general emancipation. The modest British campaign against the slave trade achieved success in 1807 and France and the Netherlands also abolished the trade in 1814, but the slave regimes of the British and French Caribbean survived into the 1830s and 1840s respectively. In the United States, the momentum that had propelled gradual emancipation through Northern legislatures—and which had kept slavery out of the new Northwest Territory—began to dissipate even as Haiti achieved its independence. American legislators approved their own ban on the international slave trade in 1808, partly because slaveholders from the upper South imagined that this might inflate the value of their own property within the internal slave market, which thrived for another half century. And the slave societies in both the United States and Brazil continued to expand, in spite of the independence movements in both nations.18 With the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that slavery had been challenged at the end of the eighteenth century by an unusual combination of humanitarian arguments and military imperatives: where these two were in tension with one another, as in the American Revolution, the priorities of war took precedence over abstract ideas about morality. And in the remaining areas of the Spanish Empire, especially Cuba, there was also continuing growth of plantation slavery and increased prosperity for sugar planters. Spain abolished the slave trade only in 1867, by which time the island was convulsed by an independence movement.19 Portugal remained a major slave-trading power until formal abolition in 1842. Slavery continued to be legal in the border states of the United States until after the passing of the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865, and survived in Brazil for a quarter century after\n\n10.1057/9780230282698 - War, Empire and Slavery, 1770-1830, Edited by Richard Bessel, Nicholas Guyatt and Jane Rendall 9780230_229891_02_int.indd 9\n\n4/11/2010 10:08:35 AM\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Feng Chia University - PalgraveConnect - 2011-04-17\n\nIntroduction 9\n\nWar, Empire and Slavery, 1770–1830\n\nLincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation of 1863. At the celebration of the American centennial in Philadelphia in 1876, the crusading General (now President) Ulysses S. Grant welcomed Emperor Pedro II as his guest of honour in spite of the persistence of slavery (and monarchy) in Brazil. Pedro finally managed to free Brazil’s remaining slaves in 1888, and fell from power the following year partly because of the resentments that his action had created among Brazilian elites.20 The difficulty of imagining black people as political and social equals was felt most keenly in the new United States, in which the idea of equality had been promoted during the Revolution as a cornerstone of political identity. The combination of this revolutionary emphasis on equality and the proximity of large white communities to considerable numbers of slaves ensured that the American debate about emancipation looked very different from its European analogues. Thomas Jefferson, grappling in the early 1780s with the problems of Virginian slavery, noted the need for a double emancipation in the United States: blacks would be freed from slavery, but whites would then have to be freed from blacks. The effective collapsing of the distance between a free metropole and an enslaved periphery made the American experience very different from that of Spain, France or Britain. While Spain, for example, might take a fairly relaxed view of slavery in its distant colony of Missouri, US officials were more inclined to classify and regulate both the institution of slavery and those people who were caught up in it.21 Julie Winch’s chapter in this volume describes the career of Jacques Clamorgan, the French trader who moved between the Caribbean and the Spanish towns of New Orleans and St Louis during the twilight of imperial control. In 1784, Clamorgan seized Ester, a slave woman, from a ‘renegade Anglican minister’ near St Louis in lieu of a debt. He beat her, became her lover, and eventually freed her so that she could become his business partner in a series of byzantine land deals. He was less interested, however, in freeing the rest of Ester’s family. When the United States assumed sovereignty over the area in 1804, Clamorgan struggled to defend his extensive land claims, which had been made in Ester’s name. The Americans brought with them a harsh black code which made it much harder to free a slave, extended the definition of who might be considered one in law, and restricted the rights previously enjoyed by slaves in the Spanish system. Just as those who had sided with the British during the American Revolution concluded that Britain was a more likely sponsor of their emancipation, so the French and Spanish slaves of the Mississippi Valley at the turn of the nineteenth century viewed the onrush of the United States with considerable alarm. If the successful campaigns against the slave trade and the stunning achievement of independence in Haiti persuaded at least some observers that slavery was on the wane, the abolitionist impulse of this moment tended to hasten the emergence of new forms of difference and exclusion beyond\n\n10.1057/9780230282698 - War, Empire and Slavery, 1770-1830, Edited by Richard Bessel, Nicholas Guyatt and Jane Rendall 9780230_229891_02_int.indd 10\n\n4/11/2010 10:08:35 AM\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Feng Chia University - PalgraveConnect - 2011-04-17\n\n10\n\nslavery. As Ian Coller describes, the Egyptian refugees who found their way to Marseilles after 1801 were surprised to discover that their preference for the French nation over the Ottoman Empire was not rewarded with citizenship. Partly, the problem facing these refugees was an identity crisis within the highest echelons of the French regime about the kind of nation France wanted to be: an empire with subject peoples; a nation with extended territory and citizenship; or some combination of the two. But the response of the local authorities in Marseilles, who dwelt upon the colour of the refugees and cast aspersions on their citizenship potential, demonstrated that exclusion in a post-slavery society could operate both locally and nationally. A similar dynamic operated in the northern United States, where the abolition of slavery (whether immediate or gradual) coincided with the imposition of black codes that effectively prevented the achievement of racial equality or a race-blind citizenship after abolition, and also with the promotion of colonization and removal, often accompanied by promises of national equality for the new black colonies that would be located in Africa or elsewhere. It is important to note, then, that the cumulative success of antislavery in our period gave fresh impetus to racial distinctions and other markers of difference that might reinstate the hierarchies and segregation that slavery had previously ensured. In the process, ideas of citizenship and national identity became more important than ever.\n\nPart III: Identity and difference This book examines the ways in which the experiences, traumas and upheavals of the period of warfare from 1770 to 1830 brought new forms of identity and the means of reworking older ones. The term ‘identity’ has in the Latin ‘idem’, the concept of ‘sameness’ as its root. Yet it also essentially invokes the exclusion of those who are different, and the definition of that difference. It is clear that individuals, both simultaneously and in the course of a life, may have multiple identities, relating to gender, status, race, religion, nationality, locality, and so on.22 Here we consider such multiple identities as they were produced through the discourses, narratives and social relations of war, conflict and civilian life in this period. The focus of the volume is primarily on the citizens and subjects of nations and of empires, and the ways in which race, gender and culture intersected consciousness of citizenship and national identity. Such identities interact in complicated and dynamic ways, and we do not suggest that they are necessarily cast in simple or binary terms. The problems of disentangling African-born and creole identities, and republican and royalist loyalties, among the free and newly freed peoples of colour of Haiti have been discussed above. Joanna de Groot signals the complexity of issues of cultural hybridity among the sophisticated and cosmopolitan group of travellers and diplomats, nominally ‘European’ and ‘Persianate’,\n\n10.1057/9780230282698 - War, Empire and Slavery, 1770-1830, Edited by Richard Bessel, Nicholas Guyatt and Jane Rendall 9780230_229891_02_int.indd 11\n\n4/11/2010 10:08:35 AM\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Feng Chia University - PalgraveConnect - 2011-04-17\n\nIntroduction 11\n\nWar, Empire and Slavery, 1770–1830\n\nwhom she discusses. Ian Coller demonstrates how a mixed and transnational community, mostly from Egypt, migrating to France, came to adopt what was partly forced upon it, an ‘Arab identity’. Identifications emerge from the detail of everyday life and from cultural interactions as much as from the drama of the battlefield or the details of the constitutions or statecraft. The locations of self-definition may include revolutionary and patriotic activism, travel and diplomacy, experiences of military mobilization, invasion and battle and the civilian struggle for survival in the midst of regime change and the subsequent reordering of social hierarchies. Janet Hartley, for example, examines a range of different locations on the edges of the Russian Empire, including military garrisons, civilian settlements and major trading ports: she is concerned mainly with the encounters and responses of Russians to the different ‘others’ they found on their frontiers. Joanna de Groot looks at the simultaneous responses of both Iranian and European travellers to the ‘others’ they encountered personally, in a period of changing geopolitical circumstances. While Iranians had reason for anxiety as they witnessed the expansion of European empires, they came from a self-confident and assertive culture and interpreted the European peoples and governments they encountered in ways that were embedded in that culture; yet they also responded analytically and reflectively. Though there were inequalities and disparities in such cultural exchanges, these are not to be understood in simple terms of dominance and subordination. Individuals constructed stories and narratives of their subjective identifications in different ways. The literate and educated wrote diaries, memoirs, correspondence, histories and travel literature. Here Rebecca Earle notes the transformation that took place in the diary of José María Caballero of Bogotá after the fall of the Spanish monarchy; it is transformed from a mostly mundane account of local events into a record of the changing political life of the colony, its militarization and the introduction of new political practices. Alejandro Rabinovich finds in the memoirs of the civilians of the Rio de la Plata (who witnessed defeat and occupation by the British in 1806 and subsequent mobilization) the emergence of ‘a new model of man’, one inspired by the identification of citizen and warrior. The literature of travel was another important site for the recording and rewriting of identities. Jacques-Pierre Brissot’s Nouveau voyage dans les Etats-Unis de l’Amérique septentrionale (1791) recorded the new understanding of the conditions of American slavery that shaped a dedicated antislavery campaigner. And the expanding eighteenthcentury genre of travel writing offered new modes of categorization, of making sense of the differences encountered, whether through the scientific tools of natural history or the stadial approach which outlined the course of civilizational progress. (This placed Europeans at the highest point of development, but suggested that their accomplishments could\n\n10.1057/9780230282698 - War, Empire and Slavery, 1770-1830, Edited by Richard Bessel, Nicholas Guyatt and Jane Rendall 9780230_229891_02_int.indd 12\n\n4/11/2010 10:08:35 AM\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Feng Chia University - PalgraveConnect - 2011-04-17\n\n12\n\nbe emulated by others.) Diplomats, travellers, soldiers and others all drew on what had become conventional modes of interpreting cultural differences. This could involve comparative comment on social institutions and particularly on discourses of gender, sexuality and marriage, as a way of indicating degrees of ‘otherness’; such comparative modes were used by both Iranian and European writers. Visual symbols, theatre and popular festivals could also provide a focus for identification. Liberty caps and liberty trees had been important rallying points in the course of the American Revolution. But it was in France, with the displacement of the Catholic Church, that new rituals were constructed for the regenerated nation, whether in the planting of liberty trees or in the more elaborate spectacles planned by the painter Jacques-Louis David for central Paris. Spanish-American insurgents appropriated French symbols of liberty after 1808 in the launching of their own revolutions, even though they were deeply opposed to the expansion of French power. In Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela, civic festivals and state rituals helped to popularize the use of terms such as ‘liberty’ and ‘citizen’, and symbols were adapted to local purposes; the liberty tree in Bogotá in 1813 bore both a Phrygian cap and images of Jesus and Mary, and held out promises beyond the control of those who adorned it. All forms of representation, including painting and the theatre, provided ways of imagining identities in the process of transformation under the pressures of war and social upheaval. So a painting recording the coronation of Agustin de Iturbide as head of an independent Mexican state in 1822 evoked David’s famous representation of the coronation of Napoleon. And after the invasion of Portugal and flight of the imperial monarchy, representations of the Portuguese nation and its heroes were no longer rooted in a patriotic past, but relied on allegory to position patriotism as a virtue inherent in the Portuguese nation. Popular participation in the Peninsular War could not, however, later be celebrated, since the war saw the restoration of the old monarchical and aristocratic order. Here changing representations of a nation at war were invoked by that order as they re-created absolutism for the early nineteenth century. The identities of ‘citizen’ and ‘subject’ are among those frequently encountered in this volume. The word ‘citizen’ can be used to indicate the formal relationship of individuals to the state, defined by voting rights and rights of representation. One of the achievements of the American Revolution was a form of citizenship rooted in the discourses of early modern classical republicanism but incorporating formal political rights for the majority of white male citizens. The United States had effectively secured universal white male suffrage by 1830, but the exclusions of gender and race were more precisely delineated. In France, after 1789, as a new republican nation was constructed through the apparently universalizing Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen and the proclamation of the sovereignty of the people, the ideal of the male citizen-soldier emerged as a dynamic model that could be\n\n10.1057/9780230282698 - War, Empire and Slavery, 1770-1830, Edited by Richard Bessel, Nicholas Guyatt and Jane Rendall 9780230_229891_02_int.indd 13\n\n4/11/2010 10:08:35 AM\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Feng Chia University - PalgraveConnect - 2011-04-17\n\nIntroduction 13\n\nWar, Empire and Slavery, 1770–1830\n\nreworked and transformed elsewhere. As described above, in Haiti, it was adapted by creole and African-born inhabitants, in ‘a radical vision of the principles of natural right’ as one which depended above all on the status of freedom.23 Its power in Spanish America has already been referred to. Nevertheless, as Bayly shows, in French Mauritius slave-holding creoles and free people of colour rejected the authority of the French Republic in order to maintain their own position as slaveholders. In imperial Russia and in Great Britain, on the other hand, there was no legal category of ‘citizen’ at all, only the ‘subjects’ of Tsar and monarch. In autocratic and multinational Russia the status of all subjects was carefully defined, from the different ranks of the nobility to the inhabitants of towns, state peasants and personal serfs. In Britain the rhetoric of early modern republicanism and the ideal of ‘natural right’ were important to independent, radical and liberal thinkers. Yet Caitlin Anderson’s chapter in this volume demonstrates how for Britain the legal identity of an individual remained throughout this period that of the subject, bound by allegiance to the Crown, whose participation in the formal political world was explicitly dependent on religion and wealth, and implicitly on gender. Full rights and privileges could not be gained by naturalization. Yet in practice the identity of subjecthood was subject to interpretation and local political imperatives. In the context of the Caribbean, where black slaves often outnumbered the free white population by ten to one, there might be a considerable incentive to give rights and privileges to white, formerly French, and Catholic inhabitants, as was the case in Grenada after 1763. But the subjecthood of slaves—especially rebellious slaves—was a point of contention. Were slaves capable of committing treason? In Grenada in 1796 they were deemed insufficiently full persons to be prosecuted for treason. However, in 1809, the law officers of the Crown, against the opinion of local creoles, ruled that slaves from the 12 black West India Regiments formed by the British Army were sufficiently legal persons to be entitled to give evidence in courts martial.24 The environment of war provided the fluidity for such reinterpretations. Identification as a ‘citizen’ was not the only way in which individuals in this period came to view themselves as part of a wider community. They might also see themselves in a broader sense as members of new nations, in ways which were not formally defined. Membership might indeed be partial and imagined, and of the social and cultural as well as the political nation. There was no single model of citizenship. Patriotism and a sense of national identity might accompany the politics of revolutionary republicanism, as they did in France. But they could also emerge through conflict with imperial governments or enemy forces, or indeed both, as in Rio de la Plata, even before the development of an autonomous state. The creole leadership of the new Spanish-American states, however, built upon existing administrative units in creating new nations, nations which incorporated existing social\n\n10.1057/9780230282698 - War, Empire and Slavery, 1770-1830, Edited by Richard Bessel, Nicholas Guyatt and Jane Rendall 9780230_229891_02_int.indd 14\n\n4/11/2010 10:08:36 AM\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Feng Chia University - PalgraveConnect - 2011-04-17\n\n14\n\nhierarchies; in Spanish America after 1811, the symbols of the French revolution were augmented by others which denoted the distinctiveness of these ‘imagined communities’, such as the feather-crowned Indian. 25 National identities were not limited to new and revolutionary states, for this period of war also saw an intensification of patriotism and national feeling in ancien regime states such as Portugal, and in multinational empires. Janet Hartley shows how in the expanding Russian Empire, Russians forged their own sense of identity through sharply differentiating themselves from the ‘others’ on their frontiers. The Russian Orthodox faith was a very significant element in that identity, marked out from the Muslim or pagan inhabitants of the Far East and the Caucasus, and Catholic, Protestant and Uniate Christians on the western frontiers. The wars against the Ottoman Empire were presented as a conflict between Christianity and Islam. And the war against Napoleon and particularly the invasion of 1812 came to be preached, and united the nation, as a war of Christianity against the ungodly, with Napoleon as the Anti-Christ. It has been argued that the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars also had a critical effect on the shaping of British national identity, as the different peoples of the British Isles came together as Britons to display patriotic, and Protestant, unity against the French.26 This did not, however, exclude a sense of pride in, for instance, distinctively Scottish contributions to imperial expansion. In such an empire national identities could coexist, though they might also incorporate differences and inequalities, as in the relationship between Great Britain and Ireland. Many would, however, be entirely excluded from membership of the British nation, as were slaves and aliens. Catholics might fight for Britain—and the British army was one-third Irish—though they did not enjoy equal rights or status. Women might identify with the imagined community of Britain, even though they were almost entirely excluded from formal politics.27 There were other kinds of identification, of the ‘civilized’ and the ‘European’, which might cut across the national. Russian officials and soldiers regarded the ‘primitive’ peoples of the Siberian frontier either with contempt or with a missionary zeal for improvement. British imperial administrators often, though not universally, worked with a paradigmatic notion of ‘civilization’ in which vastly ‘inferior’ populations might aspire to a progressive modernity. The expansion of missionary activity in this period closely associated civilization with Christianity. In contrast, there was no history of antagonism, and considerable mutual cultural respect, between French and Russian elites. British officers in the Peninsular War greatly respected the professionalism of their French counterparts, and were more likely to look down upon the ‘backwardness’ of their Spanish and Portuguese allies.28 During the first decades of the nineteenth century, more sharply defined notions of racial identity and difference began to emerge both in and beyond Europe. Generally speaking, the eighteenth-century interest in race\n\n10.1057/9780230282698 - War, Empire and Slavery, 1770-1830, Edited by Richard Bessel, Nicholas Guyatt and Jane Rendall 9780230_229891_02_int.indd 15\n\n4/11/2010 10:08:36 AM\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Feng Chia University - PalgraveConnect - 2011-04-17\n\nIntroduction 15\n\nWar, Empire and Slavery, 1770–1830\n\nas a theological or biological conundrum, coupled with an Enlightenment emphasis upon civilizational progression and the innate potential of ‘primitive’ peoples, slowly gave way to a view of physical diversity as fixed, inherent and a basis for permanent hierarchies. It was perhaps no coincidence that this shift accompanied the political maturation of antislavery feeling in metropolitan circles. Consequently, the groundbreaking political rhetoric of male equality during this period undercut differences of class but came to permit racial exclusion. The scientific categories of natural history offered new ways of formalizing differences, as did moral philosophy, nineteenth-century theology and comparative anatomy. 29 But even more significantly, as the abolition of the slave trade took place and the possibility of the complete abolition of slavery loomed, new nations constructed or fought over the barriers that would defend the domain of white citizenship. Empires, including territories of white settlement, preserved their dominance through the differentiation of subjects, classed according to racial categories. The years of upheaval, and of emancipatory movements, had paradoxically helped to generate a consciousness of racial identification, and a racialized interpretation of community in transatlantic nations and empires. The complex and, in many respects, contradictory histories of slavery, emancipation and race reveal perhaps better than anything else both the extent and the limitations of the profound changes that occurred around the world between 1770 and 1830. The experiences of war and of revolution brought revolutionary potential for individual lives. Political maps were rewritten, and new nations and identities were constructed in this period. But these also incorporated differences, of race and of gender, and new nations developed their own imperial ambitions. Old empires remained in place and grew in extent and influence, though they might offer new forms of belonging to those who remained imperial subjects; social hierarchies were redefined as racial differentiation became sharper in metropolitan and colonial territories. In the century that followed, European power expanded as never before; but the contours of that expansion were already in place in 1830.\n\nNotes 1. E. J.

A. Bayly\n\nIntroduction This chapter interprets the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars and their aftermath as a series of events in global, rather than simply European or American history. It has three sections with complementary aims. First, I trace the impact and appropriation of revolutionary ideas and forms of government into the Asian world to parallel the well-developed idea of a EuroAtlantic revolutionary space. Second, I develop points made in The Birth of the Modern World, which characterized conjunctural developments in the Muslim, Indian and Chinese worlds as forms of ‘revolution’ in the broadest sense.1 Finally, I ask how revolutions were brought to an end at a transnational level and how a fragile ‘age of equipoise’ was achieved through both ideological and institutional compromise. Broadly, there were three revolutionary ‘surges’ after 1776. First, there was the American Revolution with its knock-on effects in Britain, Ireland and France. The second was, of course, the French Revolution itself, which had an immediate impact in Europe and in the French colonies in the Caribbean and Africa, notably Haiti. The third, least known, revolutionary surge—at least in British historiography—was also the one with a particularly marked effect on the wider world, especially Latin America and Asia. This was the series of events which followed the French invasion of Spain and Portugal in 1806 and 1807, the convening of the liberal Cortes in Cadiz in 1810 and the consequent revolutions and counter-revolutions in Iberia, the Iberian new world and in Asia. It is this third surge, which flowed on into the 1820s, that forms a major focus of this chapter. The implication of the three revolutionary surges for the central and southern Atlantic world—Spain, Portugal and their American colonies— has been intensively studied. In theory, free trade and free constitutions went hand in hand.2 The freeing of Latin American trade became very early a rallying cry of publicists such as Mariano Moreno, a creole lawyer, who edited Rousseau’s Social Contract and published it in Buenos Aires. 21\n\n10.1057/9780230282698 - War, Empire and Slavery, 1770-1830, Edited by Richard Bessel, Nicholas Guyatt and Jane Rendall 9780230_229891_03_cha01.indd 21\n\n4/6/2010 3:24:02 PM\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Feng Chia University - PalgraveConnect - 2011-04-17\n\nThe ‘Revolutionary Age’ in the Wider World, c. 1790–1830\n\nWar, Empire and Slavery, 1770–1830\n\nAnother such revolutionary precursor was Francisco de Miranda of Caracas who began to urge the ejection of Spain from the New World. He conjured up the idea of Latin American independence during a visit to the United States in 1784. De Miranda later experienced radical political action personally, commanding a battalion in France during the revolutionary wars of 1792. In a valuable review article, Gabriel Paquette has noted that recent historiography has moved away from emphasizing long-term processes in Latin American independence.3 According to the new view, Spanish colonial government was neither as effective and interventionist as once thought, nor were creole nationalism and the ideology of the Enlightenment as pervasive as historians argued a generation ago. Instead, the collapse of the Iberian monarchies in 1808 is now seen as the turning point. Still, it surely remains clear that the crisis of legitimacy that struck both Spain and Portugal after Napoleon’s invasion released a range of tensions that had long been building up in metropolitan as well as colonial societies.4 After 1808, juntas spread across Latin America demanding independence and free trade. They were supported by wealthy creoles who resented the economic monopolies and stranglehold on office retained by native Spaniards and Portuguese. Mestizos and American Indians also broadly supported radical social change, especially in Mexico, where the movement for independence came closest to an indigenous social revolt. Critically, therefore, the revolutions outside Europe were revolts against racial as well as social disabilities, involving local elites, indigenous people and slaves. 5 This was as true of Asia as the Americas. Ironically, it was the liberal Cortes, or parliament, of Cadiz, convened after the collapse of the royal governments of Spain and Portugal in 1808, which sparked off the first major revolts in the Iberian New World and Asia. The Cortes declared itself the embodiment of national sovereignty in 1810 and abolished Indian tribute and forced labour across the empire. In 1812 it issued a ‘mixed constitution’ for Spanish government, which melded features of the American constitution and the abortive Polish constitution of 1791. Yet the Cortes seemed at the same time determined to keep its hold on the colonies and devised means to exclude large sections of the mestizo and indigenous populations from the benefits of representation. If Iberia was the fulcrum of the third revolutionary surge, events in the colonies were clearly assessed and understood against the background of more specifically Latin American conceptions of representation and racial difference. This point can also be made about revolutionary change in Iberian, French and British Asia. Here I want to move to the first of the main points of this chapter. With the publication of Robert Palmer’s The Age of Democratic Revolution in 1959 and 1964, historians began to paint a more comprehensive picture of the interrelationship between the European and American revolutions.6 The slave revolt in Haiti and the career of Simon\n\n10.1057/9780230282698 - War, Empire and Slavery, 1770-1830, Edited by Richard Bessel, Nicholas Guyatt and Jane Rendall 9780230_229891_03_cha01.indd 22\n\n4/6/2010 3:24:02 PM\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Feng Chia University - PalgraveConnect - 2011-04-17\n\n22\n\n23\n\nBolivar, for instance, could be brought closer to the study of Napoleonic Europe.7 Here, however, I want to advance a parallel argument about the revolutionary age in Asia and the China Seas by bringing together a number of detailed studies. The path I will trace might seem idiosyncratic. It runs not from London and Paris to Calcutta, but from Rio de Janeiro and Oporto to Goa, Pondicherry, Calcutta and the Philippines It was the distant impetus given by the French Revolution and the Cadiz Cortes to indigenous forms of protest in Iberian, and to a lesser extent French and British Asia, which provides the narrative. The places which directly and initially recorded the shock of the Euro-American revolutions were colonial port cities, inhabited by Europeans and Asian compradors along with their immediate hinterlands. Yet these littoral shocks can be set in the context of much wider and longer-term transformations in the inland polities of the Middle East and Asia which also reflect revolutionary ideological and political changes in the broadest sense.\n\nAsia’s revolutionary age What were the special features of the revolutionary shock in the Asian world? Historians of Euro-America have recently tended to retreat from the view that long-term social and economic processes ‘caused’ the French and Iberian revolutions.8 Instead, they picture a sudden chaotic political collapse spiralling out of control. This seems less applicable to Asia. Here, the revolutionary shock was recorded nearly a century after its early modern empires—the Ottomans, Mughals, Safavids and Qing—had already begun to unravel, or at least struggle under the pressure of imperial fiscal overstretch. This had been underscored by the emergence of new, universalizing ideologies which challenged these supremacies: Buddhist millenarianism, Islamic purism, Sikhism and Christian evangelism. Aggressive European mercantilist bodies had undermined earlier Eurasian patterns of free commerce and interaction, especially during the international wars of the 1740s and 1760s. In addition, when the European revolutions finally impacted on Europe’s existing Asian colonies after 1789, these had already seen a long-term escalation of tensions surrounding questions of racial exclusion and the conflicts surrounding the struggle of independent traders with violent commercial monopolies.9 Ultimately, the issue of whether war released revolutionary tensions, or whether mounting social tensions gave rise to revolution and war, seems relatively insignificant, even in the European case. The global crisis saw the entangling of both conditions. I begin with Portuguese India, the Estado da India, especially Goa. Before the French Revolution, Goa had already witnessed the development of a tradition of priestly protest against the authority of the Portuguese Crown. As everywhere else in the non-European world, the issue of popular rights was\n\n10.1057/9780230282698 - War, Empire and Slavery, 1770-1830, Edited by Richard Bessel, Nicholas Guyatt and Jane Rendall 9780230_229891_03_cha01.indd 23\n\n4/6/2010 3:24:02 PM\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Feng Chia University - PalgraveConnect - 2011-04-17\n\nThe ‘Revolutionary Age’ in the Wider World\n\nWar, Empire and Slavery, 1770–1830\n\nalready entangled with issues of race. Belying its reputation for liberality, Portuguese rule in Asia, as in the Americas, was racially exclusive. Mestizos and kanarins (Goan Indians) were excluded from most religious offices even when they were Christian. In the early seventeenth century, Mateus Castro Mahole had protested against racism and the treatment of Goan Christians as slaves.10 He attempted to use the Christian universalism of the Papal Propaganda Fidei against the rigid position of the Portuguese Crown and its ecclesiastical patronage, the Padroado. It is significant that Mahole expounded not only an archaic Iberian notion of rights, but also dwelt on the particular insult to the status of Brahmins conveyed by their exclusion from offices of state and Church. He appears to have been in secret communication with Muslim rulers in Western India, urging them to help liberate Goa from the Portuguese. Similar themes resurfaced in 1787, when a group of Goan priests and laymen were supposedly involved in a plot to raise the local Goan military regiments against the Crown and declare a republic, once again under the protection of Indian rulers.11 The plot failed, but it bore a resemblance to the rebellion that broke out in Brazil in 1789. Themes of modernization and reform, which had spread during Pombal’s autocratic rule in mainland Portugal, were mixed in the conspirators’ statements with the ideas of the French Enlightenment, including copious quotations from Voltaire. Again, this was to be a ‘revolt of the castes’, a protest by Christian Brahmins and mestizos against exclusion from office. This picture of Asia in the revolutionary age can also be filled out with material from the French colonies after 1789. Recent in"
