        "text": "Life Of A Dustbin (Stephen Fortune) is a British electronic musician specializing in experimental electronica, my music can best be described as ‘moody electronica’ drawing influences from a variety of musicians from different genres of the musical spectrum such as Aphex Twin, John Frusciante, Nurse with Wound, Moby, Leftfield and Underworld among others.\n\nA diverse artist who does not care much for commercial recognition, my main focus is creating music to my own rule without really caring what is popular at the moment in time, my main influence being Cornish electronic genius Aphex Twin after seeing the video for his single ‘Come to Daddy'( James, 1997), I was mesmerized by it and wanted to explore more about the artist, quickly purchasing most of Aphex Twins back catalogue, on hearing these albums, I quickly fell in love with electronic music, an obsession that continues to expand to this day and shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nNow as an artist I consider myself to be for the large part, a musical nerd, who doesn’t really fit in to any particular scene or genre, the main focal point for me is essentially my musical output, I don’t really want to put myself in a box and attach myself to any particular scene or genre, I want to keep breaking the rules and pushing the boundaries with the music I create, I make a great effort into practically immersively listening to a wide selection of music, old and new, in order to gain inspiration, motivation and ideas for future compositions. Listening to music everyday is important for me, I couldn’t function as a human being if I didn’t listen to at least three new songs in one day, it’s like a religion for me. With the wide variety of music I listen to it has enabled me to branch out and experiment in a wide range of musical styles that I am interested in. As a solo artist, my productions have been largely instrumental pieces using FL Studio using some of the techniques that I have learned whilst undertaking my degree, I am fairly satisfied with the quality of my productions considering, but I know that there is a large room for improvement, I feel if I keep working hard and learning that I can become a success and make a living as a musician.\n\nAphex Twin for me, is one of the few artists that is ahead of his time, and his productions are imaginative, ground breaking soundscapes, I admire his intricate drum programming and the rhythmic complexity in his music, this is the main reason I am experimenting with my drum patterns, and I have been working towards break-beat-style epics and incredibly complex structures within songs. I am learning slowly to include more complexity and variety in my productions, paying more attention to detail in what I am doing and generally being a versatile and varied electronic music producer.\n\nMy lifelong ambition as a musician is to create an electronic music album which is diverse, and challenges the listener to be drawn in, the type of album that would be perfectly suited to be listened through a set of headphones to be fully appreciated with layer upon layer of sound detail that requires immersive listening to unravel and examine. At the moment in music, I am happy to be a reclusive, not really putting myself out there whilst I craft my masterpiece, I am getting there and it’s a journey that I am very much enjoying. I consider the album that I am working on now as my ‘teething’ album, very experimental and full of ideas. In the future, i intend to incorporate vocalists into my music. This album can definitely be enjoyed by anyone who is willing to sit down and listen and give it chance, but in saying that although i obviously want people to listen to it and enjoy it, your average chart listener is not going to enjoy it, and will probably dismiss it as ‘crap’, that is fair enough to me, as i have faith in my ability and myself and I’m not looking for the approval of anybody, and i have learned to accept that some listeners are happy just to swallow everything they hear on the radio, and that’s fine, no really it is. That being said i hope people do support me and i can get people interested and listening to different kinds of music, whilst also inspiring them to make an effort to support independent artists who are struggling to get their music listened to. Aphex Twin was once an unknown artist who had to work his way up to where he is today, so hopefully people will understand and maybe even give us indie artists a bit of support and a push in the right direction, instead of pulling us to bits just because we are not in the charts or on the television.\n\nThe late nineties was the height of my obsession for electronic music, I was still at school, all my friends were listening to Blink 182 and Oasis, i was listening to Aphex Twin, my friends thought i was weird, but even back then i had little interest in popular music, i used to earn my money by doing 3 paper rounds a day and all my pay was spent towards buying tapes and Cd’s, i used to sit in my bedroom listening to them, i was an obsessive musical nerd, and i guess i still am, and always will be. I used to get the bus to Newcastle almost every weekend where i would use my money to buy an eclectic range of electronic music, mainly from a shop called Reflex, one of the albums i bought was ‘Selected Ambient Works Volume II’ by Aphex Twin ( James, 1994), which quickly became my favorite album to listen to, the soundscapes and minimalism was what my ears most appreciated, for much of this period i virtually became a recluse, spending most of my nights locked away in my bedroom listening to all kinds of electronic music.\n\nWhilst I was still in school because of the fact that i looked a lot older for my years, i began clubbing down Hartlepool with my older brother and his friends, this is where i really got into dance floor friendly electronic music, every weekend i was out and my musical tastes were broadening, i began to listen to less IDM (Intelligent Dance Music) as it is now known, although i still refer to it as just electronic music, and began listening to the dance music that was in the charts, i think at the time it was a golden period for dance music in that era, the first track that caught my attention was Pete Heller ‘Big Love’, a brilliant progressive house track that when i first heard it, it gave me that warm happy feeling and sent shivers down my spine, from that moment, i then fell in love with house music, and the whole scene that came with it. When i look back this is my absolute favorite era of popular music. This type of house music challenges you to try out the concept of happiness , Such a positive vibe in that era. I am so thankful i was apart of this golden period of dance music, this music gave me a reason to live and enjoy and appreciate life. Whilst in this era, i began to collect vinyl whilst also learning to DJ, every Saturday, whilst mostly nursing a mild hangover from partying, i would venture through Newcastle to HMV where i would listen to music on their vinyl player, i’d be in the shop for hours losing myself listening to tracks, and only when i was satisfied with what i had heard would i hand over the cash for my selected vinyl.\n\nIt was a fantastic time to be alive, technology was not so advanced as it is now, people actually communicated with each other, if you wanted to speak to anybody, you would give them a knock on the door or a cheeky ring off your house phone or failing that a phone box,there was no Facebook, and the mobile phone of choice was Nokia 3310 , a phone that allowed you to go out all weekend without having to charge your battery, society interacted a lot more on a face to face level in those days.The pathway into Music was harder to break into back in those days, Myspace hadn’t even been introduced yet, opportunities to get your music heard were few and far between, also technology for professional music production was a lot more expensive than it is in the modern era, these days you can get professional music software for a very compact price. My introduction to musical production software came in the form of a PlayStation game called Music 2000 (Baines, 2015). My evenings during the week were spent on this game making horrific generic music with my friends, at the time we thought it was the best music ever created by any living human, obviously we were wrong but we were having fun and were learning the basics of music production, and gradually as time went on, our productions got better, not perfect, but according to (Armstrong)\n\n‘School is practice for the future, and practice makes perfect. But nobody’s perfect, so why practice?’\n\nnothing can be perfect, I believe this statement to be true, believing in these words make it easier for me to produce music whilst enjoying it without putting too much pressure on myself, i produce much better music when i am having fun with it, and although i realize that creating music can be very challenging and hard work, if you’re not enjoying that challenge then you shouldn’t be a musician, so as stated here, i know nobody can be a perfect musician but if you put your all into something what you are doing then good results will happen. Too many people get depressed in their quest to be perfect, i just appreciate what i have.\n\nAs the new millennium came around, I still the lacked focus and discipline i needed to realise my ambition of being a music producer, i was too busy enjoying listening to the music and partying to sit down and learn, it seemed listening to the music that i loved drew me away from my ambitions to be a producer. However i still held those dreams in my heart, and i continued to DJ at small venues and house parties, although i was often sidetracked from my ambition, the dream was still there and it is still there now, it refuses to go away, that is why i am trying to do something about it.\n\n​In 2001, Aphex Twin released his new album ‘Druk​qs’ (Horner) this album changed the game up for me, and although it received mixed reviews from critics, I find this album his best work to date and completely different from anything else around at that time, but delivers much the same effect, an interesting fascinating listen from start to finish, the most important thing i learned from listening to this album was that music is freedom, you can do anything you like really, also it sent me on my journey into being able to express and convey so many of my emotions through electronic music. I do believe it is possible to express feelings through an instrumental electronic music production, i think it’s a hard skill to acquire, which takes time and dedication, and also talent, but listening to this album has taught me to apply feelings into the music i create, and also to the music i listened to, it was like a spiritual awakening inside my mind.\n\nFrom then on, I began a full-blown exploration of all music, i began reading lots of books about music such as The Ambient Century by Mark Prendergast (Prendergast), which was released in late 2000, the book explored the history and odyssey of ambient music, reading this book made me a really serious listener of music with a really open mind, listening to music and finding new music was what i focused on for a long time after reading this book, it was like a bible for me, i discovered the music of Brian Eno through this book, around this time i became less involved in dance floor friendly music, and slipped with ease back into my ambient shell. I came across an album that would later become the catalyst to what i want to become as a musician, the album was ‘Another Green World’ by Brian Eno, this album gave me hope that my own slightly off kiltered sense of musical style was something possible, i felt like i knew Brian Eno through that album, i felt like he made it for me, the same way i felt when i listened to ‘Drukqs’ BY Aphex Twin, i believe these albums were subliminal messages sent to me to become an artist and musician, these two are my musical heroes who came into my life at a time i thought music had become monotonous and generic, their music is beautiful and transcendental​.\n\nI went through a period of self-doubt after listening to these artists, constantly thinking to myself ‘Could i ever really be as good at producing music as these two artists’ and at times i would become seriously downhearted, almost depressed, it was like the music i loved and appreciated had in the end made me feel miserable, full of negativity and envy, i was envious because i had dreams to be a successful musician, but i was the furthest away from reaching my goal at that point. I reached a point where i had almost given up, my love of music would never die but my self doubt had all but put an end of my hopes of becoming a successful musician. Although i sporadically produced music as a hobby, i never really pushed myself as much as i could have, i had lost my motivation and myself, it would take me a long time to find the motivation to chase my dream.\n\nAs time went by, slowly but surely my motivation returned, revitalized after hearing ‘ Boy In Da Corner’ by Dizzie Rascal, I had read about the album whilst reading a Pitchfork magazine article (Plagenhoef, 2003), i bought the album after not hearing any singles or music from it, on the day i bought it, i played it at my friend’s house and we listened to it 3 times in one night, i was shell-shocked to hear it, it’s honesty, it’s rawness and the fact that an 18-year-old could produce that, something inside my head lit up again, i thought to myself that if i want something out of life, if i wanted to acquire something and if there was a goal that i wanted to reach, then it wasn’t going to be easy, i knew i had to overcome those negative habits that had been holding me back, it was going to be challenging, but if an 18 year old could produce an album like that, then why couldn’t i do the same.\n\nAll things considered, ambient music has had a large impact on my life, it is the path I want to follow, i connect with this music spiritually, and even subconsciously it is there in almost everything i do, when i’m watching a movie, ambient music is there. Aphex Twin is an artist that i have followed for the best part of 20 years, his music has inspired me to become a musician whilst also leading me to other musicians such as Brian Eno amongst others. Ambient music holds so many fond memories for me, the pleasures that the curiosity of my youth brought searching out and finding and discovering new music, i now have learned the skills through listening to ambient music and learning about it, the best way to describe ambient is best quoted by (Eno)\n\n‘An ambience is defined as an atmosphere, or a surrounding influence: a tint. My (Brian Eno) intention is to produce original pieces ostensibly (but not exclusively) for particular times and situations with a view to building up a small but versatile catalogue of environmental music suited to a wide variety of moods and atmospheres’\n\nI wholeheartedly agree with this statement, significantly as he states, ambient music works best for me as it offers me a broader scale of ideas to work with.​,all things considered such as the threat of digital technology to real musicians, i think collectively real artists such as Aphex Twin will always be needed, i hope to emulate him and create an enviable body of work that will enable me to fund a living off being a musician.\n\nAphex Twin’s music has been used in films, games and various other ventures so there are many opportunities for me to create the music I want to create and get paid for it. I will continue to listen to ambient music as it is a very important part of my life and i know that listening to the music is just as important as creating it, i’m still obsessed with Aphex Twin and although i thought his latest album’ Syro’ was not his best work in my opinion, it’s still a well crafted electronic work of art in my view, i hope to one day create a great electronic music album, i truly believe i can do it as long as i keep working hard and learning, that’s the beauty of music to me, you can keep learning forever, it is eternal, and it is beauty. Some people say Aphex Twin is the most innovative electronic musician ever, and whilst that statement is up for debate in some people’s view, his place in my musical influence, inspiration and development is not.\n\nWritten By Stephen Fortune (Life Of A Dustbin)\n\n‘I Really Should Have Known’ The Debut Album By Life Of A Dustbin is out soon.\n\nBibliography\n\nJames, Richard.
