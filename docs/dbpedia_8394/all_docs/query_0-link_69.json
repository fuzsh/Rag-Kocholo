With that said, and with any colorful vinyl record we design, we CAN NOT guarantee they will look exactly like this, and no two records will be exactly the same, (we open a few samples and photograph the most consistent pattern we observe). Please keep that in mind when purchasing.\n\nThis release is currently in transit to our warehouse, and will begin shipping the middle of next week, and may take a week or so to ship,depending on the time your order was placed. Please be patient, once your order ships you will get tracking information.
