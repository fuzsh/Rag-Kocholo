        "text": "It was August 29, 1983, and William Basinski somehow found himself opening for David Bowie. Basinski was playing saxophone with a British rockabilly band called the Rockats, and he distinctly remembers being pelted with random objects by the crowd at Pennsylvania’s Hersheypark Stadium. “Nobody wants to see an opening act for Bowie,” he tells me, chuckling. It was only after Basinski let loose a shredding saxophone solo that the audience started to cheer.\n\nThat night, he was able to meet Bowie, his idol, for just a second, and give him a cassette tape he made of slowed-down, droning Muzak samples mixed with shortwave radio blasts. He never knew if Bowie listened to the tape, but those same sounds eventually turned into Basinski’s debut album, Shortwave Music, 15 years later.\n\nBasinski’s career, much like his music, has never followed a linear path, or even felt tethered to the standard rules of time and space. In more ways than one, his creative presence has felt almost apparitional, and before he became known for his own music, he was an artistic figure of secret, almost invisible prominence.\n\nStarting in the late ’70s, while living in San Francisco, he began recording the detritus of his day: errant traffic, random radio broadcasts, freezer buzz. He would then loop and manipulate such recordings, and they became the backbone of his work. His process of composition—cutting up, stitching together, and collaging little pieces of magnetic tape—was closer to painting, or even alchemy.\n\nHe later moved to a loft in Williamsburg, Brooklyn—dubbed Arcadia—which became a mecca for the city’s most influential eccentrics and bon vivants. The cover for Jeff Buckley’s 1994 debut *Grace *was shot in his living room. ANOHNI and Diamanda Galás played a Halloween show in the loft at one point, and Basinski was even an early member of ANOHNI’s band. During this period, Basinski would sit in his thrift store, Lady Bird, and continue to record the ephemera of his life.\n\nAfter years on the fringe, one morning in 2002, this proud outsider woke up to find out he was suddenly an artist of great acclaim. The reception to his inimitable 9/11 elegy, The Disintegration Loops, was ecstatic. The story behind that work has become something of a legend: an attempt to digitize a portion of his archive of loops was serendipitously disastrous—the magnetic tape decayed and crumbled as it passed through the digital recorder—producing eerie, unforgettable sounds in the process. Not long after, the planes hit the Twin Towers, and from the roof of his building in Brooklyn, the tragedy and spectacle was burned into his retinas forever. The music he made on that day was unimaginably melancholic, aware of how time turns everything into dust.\n\nDespite the seriousness of his most renowned work, Basinski speaks warmly, and often hilariously, of his childhood in Texas and Florida—he once touched Neil Armstrong’s butt!—as well as the New York of his past, and the circuitous, almost accidental journey that took him from obscurity to notoriety. He’s nearing 60 now, and in the last decade and a half he’s travelled the world restlessly, sharing his music like never before. Speaking from the Los Angeles home he shares with his life partner, the artist James Elaine, he tells me about the musicians, songs, and albums that have stuck with him most, five years at a time.\n\nThe Beatles on “The Ed Sullivan Show”\n\nI was born in what I call “The Year of the Diamond Dogs,” 1958. It’s the year of the Earth Dog in Chinese astrology, but some of the people born that year were Michael Jackson, Prince, and Madonna—and I’m in that group. At age 5, I had the big explosion that was my first memory of music: We were allowed to stay up and watch “The Ed Sullivan Show” when the Beatles came on, and our minds were blown. It completely ruined the next 10 years. It was just pandemonium, the girls with the cat glasses screaming and carrying on, and the Beatles were so cute and jangly with their sound and their voices and their haircuts.\n\nHerb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass: “The Lonely Bull (El Solo Toro)”\n\n1968 was a big year for music, and Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass was big with my parents. By that time, we had moved to Florida, where my dad was working for a contractor that was doing some work on NASA’s lunar module. But a few years before that we were in this brand new ’60s utopian suburban neighborhood in Houston called Clear Lake City; new schools and a golf course and all the astronauts and the scientists lived there. My dad was working for General Electric on the Mercury and Apollo programs there, and we went to church with the astronauts and we went to school with their kids. I was in the communion line with my dad once when he whispered to me to touch the man in front of me. I just kept my hands by my side, but my dad grabbed my hand and made me touch Neil Armstrong’s butt. He turned around and said “hello” and shook my hand.\n\nThe Edgar Winter Group: “Frankenstein”\n\nWe were in Dallas, and I started high school there. We went to Richardson High School, which was very large, 3,000 students. Very fine music program: 300-piece marching band, two symphonic bands, two orchestras, and a jazz band. I played clarinet in the symphonic band. At home, though, me and my friends were listening to Ziggy Stardust and Led Zeppelin and all this prog-rock. My brother was a guitar player and he was really interested in Johnny Winter; he kind of looked like a negative image of Johnny Winter with his long black hair. I was really into Johnny’s brother, Edgar, because he was such a great sax player and singer. I would listen to his records and slow them down and try to learn how to play the solos.\n\nBrian Eno: Discreet Music\n\nThat was a big jump. By 1978, I was going to North Texas State University and trying to get into one of the jazz bands there. I was never a good auditioner, though, and I always got very nervous and tripped-out and usually screwed it up. So I didn’t get into the jazz band and switched my major to composition and started doing weird shit.\n\nThat’s also around the time I met Jamie [Elaine], and we fell in love. I saved up all my money from nude modeling and used it to get a plane ticket and take my little suitcase and saxophone to San Francisco, where he moved after school. When I got there, I started to realize every city has its own ambient sound, but San Francisco was really something special with the bay and the gulls and the ocean. You have these crickety electric buses, screeching streetcars reverberating around, foghorns. It was really rich.\n\nAnd there was encouragement there. Jamie would play records, I would just listen. He’d put something on, and we’d talk about it. Very soon after I got there, looking at the diagram on the back of Brian Eno’s Discreet Music, where they show the Frippertronics tape delay with the two tape decks, I went around the corner to a junk shop. I found two big old giant 40-pound Philips flatbed reel-to-reel decks and a bunch of used tapes for $10, took it all home, and just started trying things. Shortly after that, I rented a piano. Using the saxophone, the refrigerator, old black-and-white televisions, all this shit I was recording, I went to work like crazy. Jamie was a painter. All my friends were painting. I was painting with sound.\n\n101 Strings: “Autumn Leaves”\n\nIn 1980 we moved to New York. I had had a really prolific period with my work for those first few years in the city: Shortwavemusic, The River, the Variations pieces. My neighbor downstairs was the rehearsal pianist for American Ballet Theater, so I’d go down there with a tape recorder, working on these bad piano compositions. But then I would just use the Burroughs-esque cut-up techniques and see what happened. I started to get some really cool results, particularly with pulling the loops out of little snippets of music off the radio. The most powerful station in New York was at the top of the Empire State Building; it was the American popular standards station, and they played these versions with the syncopation stripped out and it was all just strings.\n\nWe had all these wires running around the loft for speakers, and you could pick up these little snippets of Muzak. I wanted a Mellotron but I couldn't afford one, so I thought I could make a sort of Mellotron by taking little snippets of these 101 Strings songs, which were like musical anesthesia, the Prozac of the ’70s. But when you’d slow it down and look at it under a microscope, there’s this well of melancholy down there. So I started getting into the idea of pulling things out of thin air, making something from nothing.\n\nIt’s hard to remember my 30s. I made music that I liked to listen to and I listened to it; I would just leave it on for days.\n\nThe Murmurs: “Echoing”\n\nWe were in Arcadia. It was early days in the re-birth of industrial Williamsburg, and the developers had bought up all the property and were just doing the usual thing: renting out ruins to artists for fairly cheap to get them to come and do all the work to renovate, live illegally in the commercial spaces and try to get away with it. We’d host and curate shows, and it was almost like a company. We would stick with people we liked and help them develop.\n\nI fell in love with this very young two-girl folk-pop duo called the Murmurs that I saw playing down at down on South 1st Street in Williamsburg at this place called the Open Window Theaters. Heather and Leisha, the girls from the Murmurs, were actresses at the American Academy of Drama, but they had this amazing thing going on. Something had to be done, so I gave them my card, told them, “I have a studio, I’d like to talk to you. Come over and let’s hear what you’re doing.” So we started working together and became very close. I worked with them for three years, and they eventually got signed to MCA, but everything went downhill from there, unfortunately. I produced their first record, Who Are We. They had this little gay anthem called “Echoing.” It was pretty fucking brave. Because nobody in the record industry wanted anybody to be out and gay [in the early ’90s].\n\nThe Spencer Davis Group: “Gimme Some Loving”\n\nI had my thrift shop, Lady Bird, around the corner from my loft. My album Shortwavemusic finally came out around ’98, only 600 clear vinyl copies were made—I would play it in the shop in the evenings during the fall, the weather was perfect. I spent a lot of time at the store, and we had this big old stereo console there. One day I found a whole bunch of cutouts in a dumpster of The Very Best of the Spencer Davis Group: “Gimme Some Loving,” “Keep on Running.” This is a great record; it really rocks.\n\nAntonio Carlos Jobim: “One Note Samba”\n\nThis was 2003, when the final Disintegration Loop came out. Then everything changed, because of Pitchfork and The Wire. The Wire did a great little feature when the first one came out. I had never even heard of Pitchfork, but one day I was out here in California visiting Jamie in the little house in Venice, and all of a sudden my inbox was just slammed with orders, and boy, did that [review] make a difference. I was going to the post office twice a day for weeks shipping orders. It eventually got me out of $30,000 worth of debt. And then everything broke open.\n\nThe record I can remember from that period was Antonio Carlos Jobim’s The Composer of Desafinado, Plays. It just makes me really happy. I always thought of it as the soundtrack to California.\n\nAmy Winehouse: “Rehab”\n\nAt 50, we’d been in the loft for almost 20 years. The rent was going through the roof. That summer, when the rent went up again, I had five people living in the loft. So we sadly had to leave our beautiful Arcadia in the summer of 2008. I had a 4,000 square foot loft full of shit, and tons of paintings and sculptures and furniture and equipment. Oh my god. My friend came over and photographed everything and put it all up on Craigslist, made a blog; we had Jeff Buckley’s chair. We had two weekends of sales, and this was right before the economy crashed; all these kids had their parents’ black cards, and there was PayPal. We made $15,000, so that paid for half the move. We were listening to Amy Winehouse that whole time, and going on about how incredible she was—her voice, her phrasing, and the way she laid back. Amy Winehouse was the real thing.\n\nJlin: “Nyakinyua Rise”\n\nIt’s been real busy touring around the world and coming back here to L.A. and collapsing in my little rental house. We have a beautiful garden with a 60-year-old orange tree and flowers and hummingbirds and butterflies. It’s a place of solace. I’m in exile, in a way. I don’t go out all that much, except to see friends’ shows or perform or get beer and cigarettes.\n\nI have a great assistant, Preston Wendel, who’s a terrific young beat-maker, composer, Ableton Live whiz, engineer. He helps me with everything. In the last year and a half, I’ve started to get Preston to show me what he’s into and what he’s doing. He’s really into avant-garde L.A. hip-hop and footwork. He’s shown me Kendrick and Kamasi Washington. Preston and I did a live show at the Broad Museum together last summer, and Jlin was also on the bill, and we got to meet her. She is an absolute doll, and we just hit it off. I don’t know what I’d do without Preston. He’s like my son."
