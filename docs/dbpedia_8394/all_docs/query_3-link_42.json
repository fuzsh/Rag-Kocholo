        "text": "Hello everybody this is week two from Music History. I will answer some questions about two music icons: Marvin Gayne and Brian Eno I hope everybody had a great week.\n\n1. Describe Brian Eno’s influences.\n\nBrian Eno has exposed himself to a variety of traditions ranging from rock to classical, from avant-garde to experimental, as well as to a variety of non-Western musics such as Arabic, African, and Bulgarian.\n\nEno has described the curious mix of music he heard like this:\n\n“I listened to Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Bo Diddley, I was a listener for a long, long time – I used to sing, too, I was always singing a lot, Buddy Holly, Elvis. This was American music, African music, in the middle of the English countryside … I think the echo on Elvis’s “Hearbreak Hotel” is better than the song itself, by far.”\n\n2. Compare and contrast any two of Eno’s projects that are listed in this Google doc\n\nThe two Eno’s projects I would like to compare are “My Life in the Bush of a Ghosts” by Brian Eno and David Byrne and “The Joshua Three” album by U2\n\nWhen you play “The carrier” from “My Life in the Bush of a Ghosts” you can hear the same guitar effect that you hear in “With or Without You” from “The Joshua Three” album. That guitar feedback played by “The Edge” in “With or Without You” actually came from “The carrier” the album was release in 1981 then six years later U2 released “The Joshua Three”.\n\n3. Discuss a minimum of two characteristics that set Brian Eno’s projects apart from other recordings; e.g. visual and musical aesthetic, the pairing of art and pop music, its influence on popular music, instrumentation and production qualities.\n\nOne characteristic that set Brian Eno’s projects apart from other recordings is the concept of Generative Music that is a term popularized by Brian Eno to describe music that is ever-different and changing, and that is created by a system.\n\nAnd another characteristic is his skill at using the studio as a compositional tool. Eno describes himself as a “non-musician, instead he uses term “treatments” to describe his modification of the sound of musical instruments, and to separate his role from that of the traditional instrumentalist\n\n4. What impression does Brian Eno’s work have on you as a listener and as an industry professional?\n\nTo me Brian Eno is a music Icon and an example to follow. When it comes to music production his ideas will help me to think outside the box to create my own path for others to follow. Brian Eno is an artist, musician, composer, record producer, singer, and visual artist and his vision will live forever in music production world."
