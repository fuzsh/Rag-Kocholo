        "text": "Inspire\n\nUnexpected musical recommendations of Brian Eno make a strange compass that encourages us to sail wider horizons.\n\nConsidering his chameleonic spirit, it may not be surprising that the muses inspiring Brian Eno are unexpected and dissimilar. But knowing the works that the composer himself cites as having exercised influence over his work, one might think it’s more the musical selection of a peculiar traveler rather than that of a composer and music producer, though of course, one could be the other.\n\nThe selection certainly bears a touch of genius. That, presumably, could not be otherwise. Beyond his creative virtuosity, remember that, in practice, Eno’s career was always associated with sensitivity, and with a musical erudition that quite naturally broke molds and patterns.\n\nHis list, compiled for the music website, The Quietus, includes the always deafening shoegaze of My Bloody Valentine, the beginnings of funk in The Golden Gate Quartet and the eccentricity of Farid El Atrache, a rarity Eno heard for the first time in Ibiza. This already peculiar selection is complemented by the uncertain gospel sounds of Reverend Maceo Woods and The Christian Tabernacle Choir which he’d heard on the radio in the Bahamas, while recording with The Talking Heads. He’d encountered sounds with Arab reminiscences at a kebab shop in London where he’d listened to Arif Sag. On the other hand, it’s not surprising that he includes The Velvet Underground, of which Eno warned: “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band.”\n\nEno’s selections seems to insinuate one more lesson, among the many he’s shared musically over his career: great treasures are often, in essence, heterogeneous.\n\nThe Dynamic Reverend Maceo Woods and The Christian Tabernacle Choir in Concert / Reverend Maceo Woods and The Christian Tabernacle Choir\n\nFarid El Atrache / Farid El Atrache\n\nUmut / Arif Sag\n\n“Go Where I Send Thee” / The Golden Gate Quartet (single)\n\nFresh / Sly and the Family Stone\n\nPlantation Lullabies / Me’Shell NdegeOcello\n\nThe Velvet Underground / The Velvet Underground\n\nEarly Works / Steve Reich\n\nAfrodisiac / Fela Ransome-Kuti & The Africa ‘70\n\nGlider / My Bloody Valentine\n\nHeartland / Owen Pallett\n\nGrande Liturgie Orthodoxe Slave / Chœur Bulgare Svetoslav Obretenov"
