        "text": "“No one really says ‘get a life’ anymore,” @perpetua tweeted earlier this month, “and frankly people need to ~get a life~ far more urgently now than they did back in the late 80s/early 90s.”\n\nI tweeted back, “I think there was more life to get.”\n\nObviously we were both joking, but the sense of exhaustion can be quite real, the feeling that we’ve depleted our inner and natural resources and we’ve explored what there is to explore.\n\nThis feeling is amplified by living in a city like Austin, Texas, where you’re constantly hearing about how much better it was before you got here. In a recent piece on Richard Linklater’s Slacker, Sean O’Neal writes:\n\nAustinites carry a default attitude of “You just missed it”—as in, all the really cool stuff already happened. As Linklater pointed out in his post-show Q&A, that’s something he and his friends heard back in the eighties from all the hippie cowboys who’d seen the city’s “true” heyday in the sixties and seventies. Linklater pointed to the Slacker scene where local noise rockers Ed Hall played their song “Sedrick” to a near-empty Continental Club. Its lyrics, Linklater said, perfectly sum up the Austin point of view: “Things were so much better before you were here / . . . So much better in the past / I had myself a real gas.”\n\nAgain, this is a feeling, a feeling that can be alleviated by a single person saying, “You know, I lived here then, and it wasn’t that great.” (I think all the time about Patti Smith pointing out that the New York City of the 70s and 80s that we romanticize was filthy, bankrupt, and dangerous.)\n\nThis feeling that “it’s all been done” is amplified and exacerbated by artistic pretensions.\n\nOn a recent episode of Marc Maron’s WTF podcast, James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem was talking about reading Harold Bloom’s The Anxiety of Influence early on and how unconcerned he is now with being new or original. He recalled a speech he heard by Brian Eno about his early ambient work:\n\nIt’s hard to explain, but it was very easy to be new at that time…. He had gone and seen Cluster and the early Krautrock bands. And no one had thought, “I’m going to put all these things together…” At that time, there was still a lot of ground unclaimed. The time we live in now, there’s far less unclaimed ground.\n\n“Which I think is normal, you know?” he throws in at the end, and yes, this feeling is extremely normal, and has been normal for at least 4,000 years. In the new afterword to the 10th anniversary edition of Steal Like an Artist, I point out that in addition to Ecclesiastes’ “there is nothing new under the sun,” two millennia before that, the Egyptian poet Khakheperresenb was already complaining that the good words had been used up.\n\nIn 1824, Goethe, who was always forthright about his influences, told his assistant Eckermann that he was glad he didn’t read Shakespeare at a young age because “Shakespeare has already exhausted the whole of human nature in all its tendencies, in all its heights and depths,” and “there remains for him, the aftercomer, nothing more to do.”\n\nAnd how could one get courage only to put pen to paper, if one were conscious in an earnest, appreciating spirit, that such unfathomable and unattainable excellences were already in existence!\n\nGoethe warns of engaging with work that’s too good in your youth. He says what’s important is to admire someone just a little bit further than you, and maintain a “standard of excellent” that is “not much higher” than whatever step you’re on and able to attain. Had he read too many masterpieces in his youth, he says,\n\n..they would have overpowered me, and I should not have known what to do. I could not have gone on with such fresh light-heartedness, both should have had to bethink myself, and look about for a long time, to find some new outlet.\n\nWe celebrate the fact that most artists today have a huge portion of humankind’s output at their fingertips at any given moment, but we rarely think about the fact that exposure and abundance can also become a paralytic. Eno said he wanted to hear a certain kind of music, so he had to invent it for himself. Who feels the need to make new music, when you can almost always call up music that is completely new to your ears?\n\nSometimes when I watch my 8-year-old making music, I note how unencumbered he is by musical history and how free he is of any need to be original. He is happy, for now, to make music that is a parody of what he’s heard, and in the parodying, he comes up with his own thing. It’s new to him and that’s what’s important.\n\nIn fact, this is the great gift of children: everything is new to them, and so it can become new to you, if you let it.\n\nLet’s face it: life these days is depressing. I sometimes find it hard to imagine a future. It feels like the GAME OVER screen could pop up at any time, and what is the point of raising children in an age like this?\n\nAnd then I come to my senses and remember that it’s probably felt like the end of the world since the beginning of the world.\n\nHere is something Nancy Wallace wrote in 1983 — the year I was born — in her book, Better Than School:\n\nI constantly have to remind myself: now is the envy of the dead.\n\nThere’s always more life to get, and more art to be made out of it.\n\nA good meme takes a snippet of something and makes it funnier or more interesting out-of-context.\n\nLike television shows, I prefer the trashy, funny ones. What I can’t really stand are the memes that take themselves too seriously. Something “deep” like a moody black and white photo with a long quote laid over it. I often look up the original context for the quote and find the quote is either: a) fake b) wrongly attributed c) sliced up to make it more palatable. Worst of all, the meme is very rarely as funny or interesting as the original context.\n\nTake the Bob Dylan quote above. Here’s the original 1991 interview. Dylan was asked if he was more happier at 50 than 30:\n\n“Oh, man, I’ve never even thought about that,” Dylan said, laughing. “Happiness is not on my list of priorities. I just deal with day-to-day things. If I’m happy, I’m happy – and if I’m not, I don’t know the difference.” He fell silent for a few moments and stared at his hands. “You know,” he said, “these are yuppie words, happiness and unhappiness. It’s not happiness or unhappiness, it’s either blessed or unblessed. As the Bible says, ‘Blessed is the man who walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly.’ Now, that must be a happy man. Knowing that you are the person you were put on this earth to be – that’s much more important than just being happy.\n\nEmphasis mine. The meme maker, in this case, cut out the most interesting part of the quote, the part with actual tooth (“yuppie words”!) that separates it from being a Hallmark sentiment.\n\nThis Patti Smith meme was of particular interest to me, as I used the first part in the “Build a Good (Domain) Name” section of my book, Show Your Work! The text is actually “correct” — Smith did say all those words — but the “life is like a roller coaster” cliché comes later in the speech.\n\nWhat the meme doesn’t tell you is that Smith got the advice from William S. Burroughs — not the first name you think of associated with the word “clean”:\n\nWhen I was in my early twenties, I was lucky to have William Burroughs as a friend and mentor. Once I was with him and I asked him this question: “What should I aspire to?” and he thought, and he said: “My dear, a gold American Express would be good.” But after that, he said very thoughtfully, “Build your name.” And I said, “William, my name is Smith.” And he said, “Well, you’ll have to build a little harder.” But what William meant when he told me to build my name. Build a good name — because a name is not to get famous. He wasn’t talking about celebrity — he was talking about let your name radiate your self, magnify who you are, your good deeds, your code of honor. Build your name and as you go through life, your name will serve you.\n\nAt the risk of sounding like an old fart, I encourage people — especially young people — to do “a 30-second fact check” on self-serious memes like this.\n\nGood net citizens:\n\nSource-check what they share\n\nShare from the best source possible\n\nProvide source/claim context to people they share with when necessary\n\nIt takes almost no time at all: just put quotation marks around a distinctive part of the text and enter it into a search box. You’ll learn more a lot more from looking up the source of these memes than you will from the memes themselves."
