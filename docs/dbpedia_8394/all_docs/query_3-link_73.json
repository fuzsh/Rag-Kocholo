        "text": "Brian Eno, an English musician, record producer, and visual artist, renowned as a pioneer of ambient music, was a friend of cybernetician Stafford Beer. The latter's cybernetic thinking helped catalyze Eno's exploration of generative systems and non-linear creative processes.\n\nWe delve into Brian's affinity for cybernetics, its influence on his art, and Stafford Beer's impact on his thinking. Brian reminisces on meetings with Beer and discusses avoiding 'automaticism' in art and politics.\n\nAs with all our interviews, this one has been edited for clarity and conciseness. It was conducted online on September 18, 2021.\n\n***\n\nEvgeny: Brian, can you say a few words about the origins of your interest in cybernetics?\n\nBrian: It began when I was 16 or 17. I was at the Ipswich School of Art . It was run by a group of artists who were interested in science, as well as art. They talked about science more than they did about art, and the emphasis was on the process rather than the product. There was a phrase going around the art school, \"Process Not Product,\" which meant that artists should focus on becoming, on creating interesting processes instead of making nice pictures or sculptures. This approach made a lot of sense to me, and I started to become interested in not only art but also music that followed this position.\n\nBRITISH ART AND CYBERNETICS IN THE 1960S\n\nEvgeny: Can you tell us about a book or influence that sparked your interest in cybernetics?\n\nBrian: Yes, when I was 17, Tom Phillips , one of the tutors, gave me a copy of John Cage's book \"Silence\" .Cage was a Zen follower, and his focus on how things worked, how they worked together, and how they came into being was quite radical. It was a practice that resonated with me. I discovered shortly after that there was a name for this style of thinking, and it was cybernetics.\n\nEvgeny: How did your interest in cybernetics progress from there?\n\nBrian: While I was still at Ipswich, I became more interested in cybernetics and familiarized myself with some of the scientists involved. Then I went to Winchester School of Art, where there was very little official interest in cybernetics. However, in 1968, there was a landmark exhibition in London at the ICA called Cybernetic Serendipity .\n\nEvgeny: What about this exhibition was so significant in your view?\n\nBrian: Cybernetic Serendipity was a major exhibition that showcased the intersection of art and cybernetics. It was a moment when artists and scientists came together to collaborate and create something new. It was rare for such a collaboration to be successful, but this exhibition was an exception. It opened up new possibilities for artists and scientists to work together and explore the possibilities of technology and creativity. It was a landmark show and one of the few times when there was a real coincidence between artists and scientists.\n\nWatch a 2020 video where Brian Eno reflects on his influences, philosophy, and artistic career.\n\nEvgeny: Were there any books or essays that got you interested in cybernetics at the time? You’ve mentioned that an essay played an important role in your interest in cybernetics. Can you say more about this essay and how it influenced your musical interests?\n\nBrian: Yes, there was an important academic article co-authored by Warren McCulloch . It alerted me to an important difference between seeing and listening. It showed me that in listening, our ears function in the same way that a frog's eyes function: they can saturate very easily. This idea of saturation in listening really interested me, especially after I heard early Steve Reich tape pieces that relied on oral saturation of the mind, which made me pay attention to smaller details that I may not have heard otherwise.\n\nEvgeny: How did these intellectual influences shape your early artistic practice?\n\nBrian: As an artist, I was interested in creating interesting processes instead of concentrating on making nice pictures or sculptures. I felt that if one was working with processes, they should be transferable between different art forms. This led me to see connections between cybernetics and what I could do as an artist, particularly in the realm of music. I didn't have any musical skills, but I felt that creative skills were transferable and that processes could be modified to create different art forms.\n\nEvgeny: You mentioned that there was little support for cybernetics at Winchester. Can you say more about your journey after leaving college and how you became involved in the experimental music world?\n\nBrian: After leaving college, I moved to London and quickly became involved in the experimental music scene, which was a very small world at the time. I became aware of a really interesting revolution going on in that kind of music, and I saw connections between that music and my interest in cybernetics. It was a small community, and we all knew each other quite well. It was a really exciting time, and I felt that I was part of something special.\n\nTOWARDS CYBERNETIC MUSIC\n\nEvgeny: How did you think about pop music in relation to the experimental work that you were involved in?\n\nBrian: Yes, I thought that the new technology of studio recording had created a new art form, which was still called music because you heard it with your ears, but it was no more like traditional music than modern cinema is like theater. They obviously drew from the same route, but they had diverged so much that they were really different forms of art. So, I felt that it was really time for somebody to start pointing this out and try to introduce the two fields of activity to each other.\n\nEvgeny: So you took the initiative?\n\nBrian: I was invited to write an essay for Studio International , which would be the first time that I'd ever published anything that anybody else would ever read.\n\nYou can browse that issue of Studio International here\n\nI took this very seriously and I started to try to analyze one particular piece of music that I found especially interesting. I was also reading a book called Brain of the Firm by Stafford Beer that was recommended to me by my ex-mother-in-law.\n\nIt was exactly what I needed to be able to think about this particular piece of music that I wanted to write about, which was \"Paragraph 7\" of The Great Learning by the English composer Cornelius Cardew .\n\nEvgeny: What did you make of Cornelius Cardew at the time?\n\nBrian: Cornelius was very much part of the experimental music world, but just as I was writing this, he was becoming a Maoist and disavowing the whole scene. He wrote this famous essay, which actually was in this edition of Studio International, and it was called “Wiggly Lines and Wobbly Music.” It was a sort of critique of his work to that point. He'd worked a lot with graphic scores and so on, and the essay was a critique of that as being sort of useless bourgeois imperialist claptrap.\n\nEvgeny: So what about his piece caught your attention?\n\nBrian: It used only voices and was based on a Confucian text of 17-20 words, with only three rules in the piece. The first rule was to sing each word for the length of one breath, which resulted in the singers quickly getting out of sync with each other. The second rule was to change to the next line and change your note, which you had to choose by hearing one that was being sung around you. I found the piece to be a practical example of a cybernetic system in operation, as it produced music without the need for specific musical rules.\n\nThe piece always started with a huge discord, but it quickly became quite tonal because people tended to converge to the same tunings that other people were using. The complexity of the chord was partly due to the fact that some people were inadvertently introducing new notes into the piece. Despite the lack of musical constraints, the piece had an identity and was always somewhat different, but it was always that piece when you listened to it. The simple rules of the piece generated an internal value and personality that made it unique.\n\nEvgeny: How exactly did Beer’s work help you to understand Cardew's piece?\n\nBrian: The Brain of the Firm helped me to understand how you could create systems that had integrity and personality using only rules, without needing to specify anything in algorithmic terms. There was one sentence in the book that really struck me. I think it goes, \"Instead of trying to specify the system in full detail, you specify only somewhat, and then you ride on the dynamics of the system in the direction you want to go.\" This helped me think about how something so apparently underspecified could have an identity.\n\nEvgeny: Was The Brain of the Firm difficult to read, given that it was a management theory book?\n\nBrian: It wasn’t a hard book to read, and it was written for a lay audience, not a scientific audience. I found it to be quite easy to understand, although some parts were a bit technical. I found a few particular paragraphs in the text that really got me, and those were the parts that I used to analyze Cardew’s piece.\n\nENTER STAFFORD BEER\n\nEvgeny: What was the public response to that big essay you wrote for Studio International?\n\nBrian: To this day, I’ve never met anyone who had read the original. I did send a copy of the essay to Stafford Beer, who wrote back to me with a very nice letter. We ended up writing back and forth to each other, and eventually, he came to visit me in London.\n\nEvgeny: What was your meeting with Stafford Beer like?\n\nBrian: It was a nice meeting. I don’t remember what we talked about, but it was great to make his acquaintance. He was a very charismatic man, and he was very aware of his charisma, and he was not at all reluctant to use it. It was nice to be able to talk to him about these ideas that I was so interested in.\n\nEvgeny: Can you tell us about your first visit to see Stafford Beer?\n\nBrian: Yes, it was in the mid-70s. He had gotten out of his marriage and was living in Wales, where he invited me to come visit him. I dressed up in my best clothes and took the train down, but as soon as I got out of the taxi at the end of his drive, two huge poodles came running down and jumped on me, covering me in mud. When I arrived at his door, he didn't even seem to notice my disheveled appearance.\n\nEvgeny: What did you and Stafford Beer do during your visit?\n\nBrian: He talked nonstop and we went for a ride in his Rolls-Royce. At one point he asked me, \"Why do you filter reality?\" I asked him what he meant, and he pointed to my glasses. “You should be grateful for all of reality coming into your, you know, into your body,” he told me. I told him I’d bear that in mind - he had an odd way of jumping off on a tangent like that.\n\nWhen we got back to the cottage, he put on a pan of water to boil and we were going to have tea, but he was talking so much that he forgot about it. He chain-smoked big Cuban cigars and drank sherry, while talking about closure and cybernetics. The whole room filled with steam from the boiling pan, and the potatoes he was cooking turned into fragments.\n\nAfterwards, we visited his wife's house (they were still very affectionate with one another) and he waltzed with her to a song called \"Toast and Marmalade for Tea\" by Tin Tin.\n\nEvgeny: What did he make of how you applied his theories to your art?\n\nBrian: He was excited about the idea that his work could include music composition and thought that I could carry on his cybernetic work. He said that he was the last person in this line of thinkers, and he wanted to pass the torch on to me. He added I might have to give up being an artist. I never really took him up on that, and I moved to New York soon after that meeting.\n\nEvgeny: When was the next time you saw Stafford?\n\nBrian: It was at the Marshall McLuhan Center at the University of Toronto, where he was teaching a course. He’d heard that I was around and asked if I would like to do a talk. It was quite frightening in a way, doing a talk with him. During the talk, I discussed a book that had been quite important to me, which was The Evolution of Cooperation by Robert Axelrod . And in the middle of my talk, in walks Robert Axelrod! It was a very interesting moment.\n\nEvgeny: Did you see Stafford again after that?\n\nBrian: I came back to England, and Stafford stayed in Canada for quite a while. I didn't see him for a long time. While I was in Toronto, I noticed that his health had deteriorated, and he was drinking a lot. I think he was just one of those people who thought nothing would happen to him.\n\nEvgeny: You mentioned that when you first met Stafford, you got an intimation of a spiritual aspect to him. Can you tell me more about that?\n\nBrian: I hadn't seen that aspect of him in any of his writing, but meeting him in person, it became much clearer. I got the feeling that it was a way of dealing with failure, the failure of what he spent his life trying to do. But as time went on, I realized that there was something much more occultish in what he was interested in, and I sort of lost touch with him when Team Syntegrity started coming up. It seemed like the wrong type of thinking for him - it had this magic dimension to it.\n\nEvgeny: How did Stafford see himself in his later years?\n\nBrian: I think he saw himself more as a philosopher, a general philosopher, than somebody concerned with management. He never said anything disparaging about the people he worked with, but I got the feeling that there was a limit to how far he was going to be able to go in that world. What became more and more clear to me is that he assumed the role of a guru figure, both in his appearance and way of speaking. There are a few late videos of him on YouTube where he is definitely playing that role.\n\nEvgeny: You mentioned in a previous conversation that when you were working with David Bowie and Robert Fripp , The Brain of the Firm was very much in your mind. Did you try to convince them to read the book, or did they pick up on your enthusiasm?\n\nBrian: I never tried to sell it to them, but I was enthusiastic about it and they picked up on that. Fripp was also very interested in Gurdjieff and Ouspensky , so the Team Syntegrity approach would have been very much up his alley. In fact, it's very much a Frippian kind of project, which is why I can't dismiss it because two of the more brilliant people I've met in my life are into it. So I think I'm going to hold judgment on that for a while.\n\nAUTOMATICISM\n\nEvgeny: You’ve recently been writing and talking about this intriguing notion of “automaticism.” Can you explain that concept?\n\nBrian: Automaticism is the idea that you can create a system where you just let things run and they'll all work themselves out without you having to interfere. I don't believe in that idea. Whatever we set up, we have to maintain it all the time. The universe isn't disposed in our interest, necessarily. So there's no reason to espouse this sort of quasi-religious idea that if we just let things be, we'll be looked after. We have to look after ourselves. We see the failures of various sorts of laissez-fairism all around us.\n\nEvgeny: How do we think about politics through the lens of automaticism?\n\nBrian: Stafford Beer used to talk about \"eudemonic criteria,\" which essentially means that the market shouldn't be considered a deity on its own, but rather just a part of the system subject to the well-being and happiness of human beings. We need to include criteria like environmental concerns to make sure we're working with the whole system instead of just what suits us.\n\nBrian Eno’s 2016 lecture at the Architecture Association on the purpose of art\n\nThis also related to my ongoing efforts to understand just why we make art. In a way, the biggest question in my life, for my whole life, has been: “What does art do for us?” This question has been with me since I was young when a woman asked me why someone with a brain like mine would want to waste it being an artist. I've been trying to find ways to think about art as a functional thing that humans not only like doing but needed to do for functional reasons. I've been interested in making work that had an agenda and attempted to do something in the world beyond just being art for art's sake."
