        "text": "Written with the co-operation of Bryan Ferry, Brian Eno, and many of their friends and colleagues, Michael Bracewell's Re-Make/Re-Model: Becoming Roxy Music was first published in 2006, and cited in The Sunday Times \"Books of the Year\" as being the first major examination of the relationship between art education and rock music in the UK.\n\nBracewell's presentation for Artists Space surveys themes discussed in his book, in relation to a rare film made in 1977 by students at Manchester School of Art Design, who devoted themselves to the creation of a glamour fixated, retro-chic, \"art directed lifestyle\" – the inspiration for which they found in the music of Bryan Ferry and Roxy Music. Capturing a rare pre-punk moment, this film (33 mins) is a little known document of the conversion of sub-cultural lifestyle into both art pop and Pop art.\n\nMichael Bracewell is the most adroitly gifted writer of his generation.\n\n– Morrissey\n\nRe-Make/Re-Model: Becoming Roxy Music is published by Da Capo Press/Faber & Faber."
