        "text": "Memory Overflow was conceived as a gallery of human experience, blending digital art, archival photos, fiction and historical stories, memoirs, dreams and delusions.\n\nMost of the content comes from or relates to people who have influenced me in some way or another. Many are friends, allies or just people I deeply respect. I've offered web space to try to digitally realize some of their works. Or, as with Brian Eno, John Cage and William S. Burroughs, I have offered a forum for others to express their stories, opinions and influences. I have worked with the artists and authors represented here to try to be a catalyst in exploring their works in a web context.\n\nI hope you enjoy the works here as much as I do, and as much as I enjoyed helping to make them available to you. I welcome potential submissions of any nature for inclusion in Memory Overflow."
