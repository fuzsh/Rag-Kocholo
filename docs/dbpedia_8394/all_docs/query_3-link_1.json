        "text": "Brian Eno\n\nA visual artist, composer, record producer, and a self-described ‘non-musician’, Brian Eno was the mastermind behind some of the greatest albums of all time, including a few of his own.\n\nPerhaps the most prolific concept artist in music of the 20th century, Eno turned 74 over the last fortnight. Today, we have a look at some of the ways Eno defined and changed the landscape of music as we know it.\n\nRead up on all the latest features and columns here.\n\nSummary:\n\nDefined ambient music\n\nProduced David Bowie’s Berlin Trilogy, along with famous acts such as U2, Coldplay, and Talking Heads.\n\nScored films, including The Lovely Bones (2009)\n\nInnovated Glam Rock with his use of synthesisers in Roxy Music\n\nRead all the latest features, columns and more here.\n\nWe’re taking a little break here at Mixdown and so should you. We’re reposting some old favourites of yours and ours!\n\nThe pioneer of ambient music\n\nOne of the most told stories in music history, Eno revolutionised and defined what we now know as ambient music.\n\nDropping in and out of consciousness in his bed after a car accident, Eno was unable to move after a friend had put on a record of 18th century harp music and left him by himself.\n\nThe album was too quiet, and Eno couldn’t turn it up over the sound of rain that was pounding against his window. But, after some frustration, Eno became entranced by the rain and the odd harp notes that were loud enough to be heard, which for him became “a great musical experience”.\n\nFrom there, Eno conceived the idea of creating music that did not “impose” itself, and instead gave control to the listener to listen actively to sections of the combined whole, or passively to its amalgamation.\n\nFrom this, came legendary albums from Eno such as Ambient 1: Music for Airports, Discreet Music, and Another Green World, the latter two which came in the same year of his accident: 1975.\n\nDavid Bowie and Brian Eno in Berlin\n\nThe friend and partnership between Eno and Bowie gave rise to some of the greatest musical creations of all time, with the most notable being Bowie’s Berlin Trilogy, where Bowie retired the ‘Thin White Duke’ era.\n\nThe first collaboration between the two artists came on the 1977 LP ‘Low’, followed by Eno’s contribution to ‘Heroes’, including co-writing the legendary title-track.\n\nFollowing this, Eno worked on ‘Lodger’, which is now widely regarded as one of Bowie’s most underappreciated masterworks.\n\nRoxy Music\n\nRoxy Music are a British rock band formed in 1970, where Eno put his love for synthesisers to professional use.\n\nFamous for their influence on electronic composition, largely thanks to Eno’s work, the band moved the glam rock movement forward at a blistering pace. Eno played with the band from 1971 to 1973 but departed due to creative differences with the band’s frontman, Bryan Ferry.\n\nOn the first two albums, ‘Roxy Music’ and ‘For Your Pleasure’, he was credited simply as ‘Eno’, for his works on the VCS 3 Synthesiser, tape effects, backing vocals, and co-producer.\n\nEno, along with the rest of Roxy Music, were inducted into the Rock ‘n’ Roll Hall of Fame in 2019.\n\nBrian Eno Film scores\n\nEno has composed and created music for a number of soundtracks over the years.\n\nHe is known for his work on Peter Jackson’s The Lovely Bones (2009), for which he composed the entire soundtrack. Songs from this film can be seen on his 2010 solo album, Warp, which contains many adaptations from The Lovely Bones.\n\nEno won a British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) TV Award in the category of Best Original Television Music for his work on Channel 4’s acclaimed series Top Boy, where he composed the theme.\n\nHe is also credited on soundtracks for films such as David Lynch’s 1984 cult classic, Dune, as well as ‘Dover Beach’ from Derek Jarman’s 1978 film Jubilee.\n\nA complete collection of Eno’s soundtrack and compositional works for film can be found on the album, ‘Brian Eno – Film Music 1976 – 2020’.\n\nThe Talking Heads, U2, Coldplay & more\n\nOf course, when talking Eno, it is essential to discuss his extensive range of collaborative work with some of the biggest artists in the world.\n\nTalking Heads famously worked with Eno on a trilogy of critically acclaimed works, including More Songs About Buildings and Food (1978), Fear of Music (1979), and perhaps their most well-known album, 1980’s Remain in Light, with notable singles ‘Once in a Lifetime’ and ‘Houses in Motion’.\n\nWith U2, Eno has credits on 1991’s Achtung Baby, as well as The Joshua Tree and The Unforgettable Fire. Additionally, Brian Eno has worked with Coldplay on Mylo Xyloto (2011), and 2008’s Viva La Vida.\n\nAlong with many other acts, including Devo, Peter Gabriel, and Slowdive, Brian Eno’s catalogue of production, writing, and performing is utterly massive. His influence – undeniable."
