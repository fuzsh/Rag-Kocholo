        "text": "SBTA Convener D Shankar told Express that the state government should protect the heritage of Sultan Bazar at all cost. SBTA have nothing to with the agreement on a special package reached between HMR and Traders’ JAC. He described Sultan Bazar as the pride of Hyderabad and mini-India where people of all religions do business and make purchases. Any plan to disturb its heritage would not be tolerated, he warned. “The metro rail project will erase Sultan Bazar’s history as it will lead to demolition of around 80 buildings and loss of livelihood to a few thousand people. It will lead to demolition of as many as 400 shops, displacement of 500 footpath hawkers and affect the livelihood of one lakh people,” said traders. Shankar recalled that chief minister Chandrasekhar Rao had assured them during the height of Telangana struggle that he will protect the Sultan Bazar market under any circumstances. He also announced on the floor of the Assembly that the government would realign three stretches near State Assembly, Sultan Bazar and Old City to protect the heritage precinct. SBBOA secretary Panduranga said that TJAC has nothing to do with with Sultan Bazar and do not any shops or properties. ‘’How can the HMR hold meeting and announce special package without consulting main affected sections like SBTA, SBBOA or SBHA etc’’. ‘’We will fight with the government to change the original alignment and to go alternate route’’ he added. SBHA president Satish Jaiswal said that Traders JAC is confusing the traders and hawkers of Sultan Bazar. Question of availing special package does not arise and will fight against the metro rail passing through the congested areas of Sultan Bazar. ‘’We will protect the heritage of market of Sultan Bazar built by Nizams at all costs,’’ he added."
