        "text": "A visit to Gokul's after shopping at Sultan Bazaar/Badi Chowdi rounds off the day and also recharges U. Though the Bajjis and chaat items are good (despite oily), the cake is in the kulfi after the snacks. A must visit after your shopping, if you don't mind the crowd.But don't over do fried items if you really want to retain the good memories!!!!\n\nThis place is open until 1 Am in the morning and I use to stop by this place while going back home after my work(around 11:30 PM). One day I saw them peeling the basin cover from the mirchi bazzis and separating the mirchis, with an intention to use them again.\n\nGokul Chat does not need any introduction in Hyderabad. Be it the yummy chutneys or the crispness of the samosas or tanginess of pani puri's. Whatever it is, it is a wonderful place for all the foodies. You will definitely come back for more. Its been a while i visited this place and will have to go next time when i go hyderabad\n\nI have tried so many chat centers in Hyderabad, But When I tasted here. I felt like 'Yes, This is the place I was looking for'. The Real taste of Chats is only available here in best available rates. This place is located in Koti. You Can do Shopping in the local Shops nearby and give a visit here. Good Place to visit.\n\nEveryone loves Panipuri, Samosa Chat ..mere mention of it makes our mouth water :). Gokul Chat takes it to another level. This place just looks like an ordinary shop on the road, but provides you with one of the best chat delicacies. It's must visit for food lovers if you are in hyd. My favourite is Dahi-Puri"
