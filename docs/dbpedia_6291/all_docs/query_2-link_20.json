Such zones date back to the post-World War II export-oriented development policies in Puerto Rico and have since spread to more than 3,500 zones with more than 70 million workers. Only a handful of nations do not have zone programs in their legal systems. One of the main motives for nations to invest in such zones are dreams of rapid, large-scale, industry-driven urbanisation – dreams of new centres like Shenzhen that will make a nation’s glory as much as the glory of its individual founders. This has triggered a proliferation of myths of origin of such zones, with some leading figures in the social sciences and the humanities such as Keller Easterling replicating a World Bank sponsored narrative that backdates the origins of the zones to Roman antiquity. In fact, SEZs originate in Puerto Rico’s post-1945 neoliberalisation drive towards export-oriented development and tax evasion. This article explains the mythopraxis championed by Easterling and others with a view to more general misunderstandings of what is central to world historical change.\n\nTh is article critiques assumptions made by urban anthropologists and other scholars of cities, focusing on currently fashionable theories of infrastructure , materiality, and complexity. It problematizes how scholarship informed by actor-network theory, assemblage theory and other varieties of (post)postmodernism uses morphological optics and metaphors to represent social life, the material world, and existence itself as necessarily \" flat, \" \" complex \" or \" fuzzy. \" As a corrective, it proposes reorienting our social morphologies with reference to a Marxist notion of infrastructure, founded on a dynamic understanding of the relationship between determining economic base and determined superstructure. It constructs its theoretical edifice with reference to the remaking of post-1945 Warsaw as a socialist city through property expropriation and monumental architectural and planning works, and post-1989 attempts to unmake its socialist character through property reprivatization and unplanning.\n\nThis text compares and contrasts two monumental architectural ensembles: Walter Sisulu Square of Dedication in Kliptown, Johannesburg, opened in 2005 by President Thabo Mbeki; and The Palace of Culture and Science, a Stalinist skyscraper ‘gifted’ to Warsaw by the Soviet Union in 1955. This architectural juxtaposition serves as the point of departure for the text’s two, interconnected key themes: an inquiry into the complex continuities and contradictions between the political and economic reconfigurations experienced by South Africa after 1994 and Poland after 1989; and an exploration into what the author defines as the ‘political morphology’ of monumental architecture. The bulk of the text is concerned with a critical investigation into how scholars conceive of the relationship between the morphological (spatial, geometric and aesthetic) characteristics of built form, and their political or economic correlates. Must there be – as the scholarly consensus suggests – an intrinsic connection between democracy and architectural humility, and between authoritarianism and monumentality?\n\nThe construction of New Belgrade as the new capital of socialist Yugoslavia was the most symbolic modernizing act initiated by the country's communist government. Yet, its precise meanings were suspended between the complicated and permanently transitory concepts of socialist Yugoslavia's federalism and its international aspirations. Focusing on three characteristic “snapshots” of the city's physical development, this paper analyzes how New Belgrade and its most important buildings represented the shifting concepts of socialist Yugoslavia as a multiethnic community and its even more changeable place in the world. The first snapshot deals with the years immediately following World War II, during which New Belgrade was conceived as the seat of a centralized Stalinist state in close alliance with the USSR. The second deals with the effects of Yugoslavia's break from the Soviet bloc in 1948, especially its rapprochement with the West and the start of the decentralization of the federal state. Finally, the third explores the late socialist period: the dwindling of New Belgrade's role as the political heart of the federation, and at the same time its emergence as a locus of Yugoslavia's ambition to play a leading role in international relations, especially through its activity in the Non-Aligned Movement.
