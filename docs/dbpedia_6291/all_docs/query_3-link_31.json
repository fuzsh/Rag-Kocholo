For sociological research to develop in a rational manner, it must follow two principles. First, it must be considered an independent field of study; second, it must be strictly connected with philosophy. It is philosophy that allows researchers to orientate themselves when confronted with complex phenomena; it provides “terms” enabling them to gradually approach truth; when rooted in sociological research, it creates a comprehensive image of social reality.\n\nThis eBook can be cited\n\nThis edition of the eBook can be cited.

An image is the result of one’s perception, and it shifts the centre of gravity from the subject onto the object. Intellectual activity produces images that follow their own logic, and each of these images is the outcome of a particular discourse applied to create a certain vision of the world. Perspectives and images are conditioned upon one’s point of view. They may be one-dimensional, reduced to one ideological point of view, or they may reflect numerous dimensions of the world, expressing the heterogeneity of points of view and the plurality of perspectives.\n\nThe present book offers an interpretation of social life developed during a century of sociological thought at the John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin. It accounts for both objective ideas and the subjective (authorial) role played by the scholars who developed these ideas. Such an approach results in a perspective – developed through individual research and never-ending academic dialogue – that provides a comprehensive vision of social life representative of complementary points of view. For sociological research to develop in a rational manner, it must follow two principles. First, it must be considered an independent field of study; secondly, it must be strictly connected with philosophy. It is philosophy that allows researchers to orientate themselves when confronted with complex phenomena; it provides “terms” enabling them to gradually approach truth; when rooted in sociological research, it creates a comprehensive image of social reality."
