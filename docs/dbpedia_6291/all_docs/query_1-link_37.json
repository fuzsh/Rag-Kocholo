        "text": "📢 Engage with Museums: Protest as Participation We are delighted to share that the discussions from this year’s European Remembrance Symposium continue to resonate, in Lithuanian National Television and Radio LRT portal! 🔎 Estonian museum researcher Pille Pruulmann-Vengerfeldt's thought-provoking ideas still spark conversations on the true meaning of engagement with museums. According to Pruulmann-Vengerfeldt, the most authentic involvement comes through conscious protest against exhibits that feel unacceptable, alien, or unnecessary. 📍 Held at the Polish History Museum in Warsaw (Muzeum Historii Polski w Warszawie), this year's symposium brought together museum professionals, historians, and politicians to explore the concept of freedom in today's world. Pruulmann-Vengerfeldt, with her extensive research in cultural citizenship and participation, challenged us to rethink our interactions with museums. 💡 She emphasized that museums must become more accessible and relevant to the public, inviting diverse voices and even welcoming dissent to stay meaningful and dynamic. ➡ Read the full intreview to delve into these ideas and more.

On the same day, Adam Królikiewicz, riding Picador, clinched the bronze in show jumping. These victories marked Poland’s first Olympic medals. ⭐ Commemorating the 100th anniversary of this momentous achievement, the Sejm has declared 2024 the Year of Polish Olympians. However, the stories of Polish Olympic athletes throughout the 20th century encompass not only glory but also enslavement and resistance against oppressive regimes. 📑 Our article, 'Olympian Values in Peace and War', explores the compelling stories of these athletes throughout the 20th century. From their promising beginnings to the harrowing experiences during World War II, many Polish Olympians faced imprisonment, forced labor, and participation in resistance movements. Despite these challenges, their commitment to the Olympic ideals and the spirit of sport endured, even within the confines of POW camps. 💛 Their legacy of perseverance, patriotism, and dedication continues to inspire future generations. 🔗 Read the full article and discover the fate of these remarkable athletes #OlympicLegacy #PolishOlympians #YearOfPolishOlympians #Resilience #History #SportsInspiratio #Remembrance\n\n🖤 Honoring the Victims of Totalitarian Regimes with 'Remember. August 23' Campaign 💬 The campaign pays tribute to the victims of totalitarian regimes, marking the European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Totalitarian Regimes, proclaimed by the European Parliament on the anniversary of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. This agreement between Nazism and Communism led to the tragedy of nearly 80 million people. For the tenth time, the European Network Remembrance and Solidarity (ENRS) underscores the importance of these historical events. 📖 Signed in August 1939, the German-Soviet Pact paved the way for World War II and its dire consequences: mass deportations, exterminations, slave labor, war crimes, the Holocaust, and ethnic cleansing. For many European societies, it meant years of enslavement and profound losses. 📢 The ‘Remember. August 23' campaign aims to make August 23rd a symbol of remembrance and deepen the understanding of the struggles faced by those who lived under totalitarian regimes. 📍 This Year's Campaign Highlights ➡ Short film spots: dedicated to individuals whose lives were marked by dramatic struggles against totalitarian systems. ➡ Commemorative pins: a symbolic gesture of remembrance. ➡ Media and outdoor campaigns: in selected European capitals, including posters with profiles of selected protagonists. ➡ Articles: discussing contemporary controversies surrounding the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. ➡ Guide to the Commemoration of 23 August: available on www.enrs.eu. ➡ Mural unveiling: A unique visualisation of intergenerational memory at 5 Lipowa Street, near the University of Warsaw. ✨ This year’s campaign heroes include: ➡ Johann Trollmann (1907–1944): a German boxer of Roma origin, a victim of Nazi persecution, murdered by kapo whom he had previously defeated in the ring. ➡ Emílie Machálková (1926–2017): a Czech woman of Roma origin, Holocaust survivor and promoter of Roma culture. Previous years have honored figures such as: Władysław Bartoszewski, Boris Romanchenko, Doina Cornea, Ieva Lase, Jaan Kross, Kazimierz Moczarski, Milada Horáková, Juliana Zarchi, Mala Zimetbaum and Edek Galiński, and Péter Mansfeld. ❓ How to join The ENRS has prepared several ways to commemorate the European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Totalitarian Regimes: ➡ Wear a pin: share this gesture of remembrance online. ➡ Post a photo: with the ENRS pin and use hashtags hashtag #RememberAugust23, hashtag #ENRS. ➡ Share reflections: on the mural or on individual stories of those who experienced totalitarian violence. ➡ Read articles: by Stefan Troebst, Roger Moorhouse and.

The event was attended by honoured guests, including Ines Schiller, the Mayor of Bad Ischl, Hannes Heide Member of the European Parliament, Radu-Dumitru Florea Consul General of Romania in Salzburg and Sead Novkinić, Consul of Bosnia and Hercegovina in Salzburg. Dr Hannes Leidinger from the University of Vienna provided an introductory lecture and Professor Jan Rydel (ENRS) invited the audience to a tour of the exhibition.

Experts from Lithuania, Poland, Germany, the USA, Ukraine, and Israel gathered to discuss and reflect on these critical issues. 🤝 We are delighted that Deputy Director Iga Raczyńska and Head of the Academic Department Dr. Malgorzata Pakier were able to actively participate on behalf of the ENRS in the conference, what underscore the importance of remembering and learning from these tragic historical events. *** 📕 In the summer of 1944, as the front lines approached Kaunas, it was decided to finally liquidate the Jewish ghetto. In early July, deportations from the ghetto to concentration camps in Nazi Germany began. Some inhabitants tried to survive the Nazi retreat by hiding in pre-arranged hideouts, known as malinas. However, before their departure, the Gestapo set fire to the ghetto houses, shooting those attempting to escape. The fires burned throughout July. Sara Ginaitė-Rubinsonienė, a member of the Kaunas Jewish Ghetto underground, recalls: 💭 ‘The ghetto was shrouded in smoke, through which the chimneys of the burnt-out houses were visible as if through a mist. For almost three weeks, the houses of Kaunas Ghetto were burning, the people who were hiding in them were burning, and the ground was burning... The corpses of charred people, household utensils, bedding, and photographs scattered by the wind could be seen around every house. Only the stone fence posts were intact.’ *** 🤝 We extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone involved for organizing and participating in this significant event. 📍 This project is funded by the LR kultūros ministerija / LR Ministry of Culture Information partner – 'Kauno Diena' Partners: European Network Remembrance And Solidarity, ENRS, International Commission for the Evaluation of the Crimes of the Nazi and Soviet Occupation Regimes in Lithuania ➡ Conference patrons: Ambassador of Israel to Lithuania Hadas Wittenberg Silverstein German Ambassador to Lithuania Dr. Cornelius Zimmermann 📷 Andrius Fioklinas #conference #konferencija #KaunasGhetto #remembrance\n\n🔔 The second day of the internatioal conference '80 Years After the Destruction of the Kaunas Ghetto – What Do We Remember, What Have We Learnt?' has just started.
